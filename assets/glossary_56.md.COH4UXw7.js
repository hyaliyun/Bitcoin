It is currently in operational service with the Pakistan Armed Forces. The Abdali program was conceived and originally designed by SUPARCO in the 1990s. The program's first derivative was originally designed as the two-stage version of the Hatf-I, essentially a solid-propellant stage was attached to the bottom of a Hatf-I. However, the program was canceled in 1994, likely due to the purchase of the M-11 missiles from the People‚Äôs Republic of China. In 1995, SUPARCO successfully persuaded and designed a new module for the Abdali program which was started the same year. Design and specification Its accuracy is sufficient for use against military targets such as bases or airfields. It is carried on a road mobile Transporter-Erector-Launcher (TEL) vehicle. The use of solid propellant and the TEL vehicle make the missile easy to store, transport and fire. The Abdali-I has a range of 150 km‚Äî190 km and an accuracy of 100m‚Äî150m CEP. It is equipped with an inertial guidance system with terminal guidance. It can be equipped with a variable payload up to 500 kg, and can carry single HE explosive or cluster sub-munition warheads. It has a launch weight of 1,750 kg. It uses a single-stage solid propellant engine and has a length of 9.75m and a width of 0.56m. Development history and current status  Originally, the Abdali program was conceived in 1987 and designs of the missiles were adopted by the Space and Upper Atmosphere Research Commission, but it never got the adequate funds for the program. In 1993, the Pakistan government took initiatives and considerations on acquiring M-11 missiles from China for a quick deployments. However, the international pressure and the MTCR's tight monitoring of prevention of any transfer of missile technology led to a denial from China to export the M-11 missiles to Pakistan. After being rebuffed due to international pressure, the Space Research Commission officials reached out to the government and presented convincing arguments to Prime Minister Benazir Bhutto on the feasibility of Abdali program. With the backing of the Prime Minister Benazir Bhutto, the SRC began the development of the Abdali program, as its features closely related to the M-11 missiles. A new design was conceived in 1997 by the SRC and continues to developed till 2000s. On 28 May 2002, the Abdali‚ÄìI was first successfully test fired from Sonmiani Test Range and reached its designated range of 110mi (180km). The Pakistani military information source, the ISPR noted the test trial as \\"successful\\" and concluded its testing \\"for now\\". Further and additional tests were conducted on 2005 and 2006.Pakistan tests the Hatf II/Abdali missileJane's Strategic Weapon Systems Abdali is currently deployed and under production.Pakistan Missile Update - 2003 Concurrently, the Abdali-I was again tested out from the TEL system and continues to reach its range of 110mi (180km). Its last tests were conducted on 13 February 2013, the Abdali-I was test fired. Upon being developed by the SRC, the missile's name was traced in the remembrance of the Pashtun King Ahmed Shah Abdali whose dynasty founded the Durrani Empire. Pashtun Emperor Ahmed Shah Abdali was noted to have been in frequent conflict with India.

Toponym Kilmahog is supposedly derived from the Scottish Gaelic, _Cille MoCh√πig_ , meaning cell of Chug (a church dedicated to Saint Chug). Although a medieval chapel was located at Kilmahog, the identity of Chug is not authentically known. Place name scholars have proposed that this could be Saint Cuaca from Meath in Ireland. Alternative evidence suggests that this Saint is the sixth century Saint Machutus (who may have originally been named Mahagw). Geography Kilmahog lies on the Garbh Uisge, also known as the \\"River Leny\\", at the junction of the Trossachs and Lochearnhead roads. The village today consists of a few houses and two woollen mill retail facilities (the Trossachs Woollen Mill and the Kilmahog Woollen Mill,Edinburgh Woollen Mills in Kilmahog ) with farm land to the north and forestry to the south. One of the woollen mills retains a working loom. There is a local pub, near the site of the old chapel, called The Lade Inn, and the Scottish Real Ale shop, which aims to stock all bottled Scottish ales. The \\"lade\\" is a man- made diversion from the river that was used to power the watermills. Nearby, Samson's Putting Stone sits precariously on Bochastle hill. Local legend has it that the stone came to be there as a result of a putting competition between a family of giants. The winner of the competition was Samson who lived on Ben Ledi (other versions of the legend mention Ben Lawers). A modern interpretation is that the stone is a glacial erratic carried from the Glen Dochart region and left there when the ice retreated at the end of the last ice age. History South of Kilmahog the remains of an ancient hillfort can be seen at Dunmore overlooking Loch Venachar. The fort is semi-oval in shape and occupies a defensive position on a low hill. It was likely a large defended structure visible from some distance. Excavations have revealed a well in the inner area and signs of vitrified stonework. Although the fort remains undated it was likely to have been founded no later than the Iron Age and may have been in use until the Middle Ages. Today only the remains of the ramparts are visible. Nearby, the remains of first century Roman ramparts attributed to the campaigns of Agricola can be seen at Bochastle in the fields to the east of the former railway. The fortification was constructed during the Flavian occupation in Scotland around 80 CE and it may have served as a northern fort of the Gask Ridge frontier. It was situated to overlook the approach to Loch Katrine and the Pass of Leny. The fort was likely in use for a few years at most and only the earthworks are visible today. Kilmahog used to be the site of St. Chug's chapel, after which it is named. Ecclesiastical letters record a chapel at Kilmahog in 1239 as a mensal church of the Bishop of Dunblane. All that remains of the chapel is a small burial ground with stones dating back to the late 17th century. Kilmahog was the site of an early 19th-century toll house and later a tweed mill. The former Callander and Oban Railway line passed through Kilmahog; the trackbed is now part of the National Cycle Network (route 7) and the Rob Roy Way. The village sits at the Northern point of a loop known as the Trossachs Bird of Prey Trail.

It is located at 84 Laurel Avenue, Franklin Township in Somerset County, New Jersey. The house was originally located on the hillside east of the Millstone River at Rocky Hill. It has been moved within southern Franklin Township several times, and is now closer to Kingston than to Rocky Hill. The residence is a featured part of the Millstone River Valley Scenic Byway. The oldest portion of the house was built as a two-room, two-story saltbox style house ; a kitchen and additional rooms were added on in the early 1760s, expanding with the Berrien family. The first reference to the house as \\"Rockingham\\" does not appear until a 1783 newspaper advertisement to sell the house, a name given most likely in honor of the Marquess of Rockingham. It was added to the National Register of Historic Places on December 18, 1970 for its significance in military and social history. With Additional documentation was approved on January 11, 2010, after the house was moved in 2001. John Berrien John Berrien was a surveyor and land agent from Long Island whose business brought him into the Millstone River valley in the 1730s. In 1735, he purchased the small house that overlooked the river. Berrien eventually became a judge, first in Somerset County before eventually being named to the Supreme Court of New Jersey. His first wife, Mary Leonard of Perth Amboy died in 1758 without bearing children; the next year, he married Margaret Eaton, whose father founded Eatontown, New Jersey. Together John and Margaret had six children, four boys and two girls. John Berrien drowned in the Millstone River in 1772, leaving his estate in the hands of his wife. He is buried in Princeton Cemetery. George Washington George Washington, painted by William Dunlap during Washington's stay at Rockingham. General George Washington stayed at Rockingham from August 23, 1783 to November 10, 1783. He was invited to the area by Congress, who were headquartered in Nassau Hall in Princeton while awaiting the news of the signing of the Treaty of Paris to officially end the Revolutionary War. Washington was accompanied by three aides-de-camp, a troop of between twelve and twenty-four life guards, his servants and, until early October, his wife Martha Washington. He spent his time at Rockingham entertaining Congress and other local figures until word of the end of the War reached him on October 31. On November 2, Washington composed his Farewell Orders to the Armies of the United States at Rockingham, a document dismissing his troops and announcing his retirement from the Army. House sold In 1802, Margaret Berrien sold the house to Frederick Cruser, who continued the expansion of the house. Storage space and servants sleeping quarters were added to the kitchen wing, a second-story balcony added to the front of the house, and the roofline raised to accommodate a third-story attic. The Cruser family occupied Rockingham until 1841. The house changed hands many times until the 1890s when the property was bought by the Rocky Hill Quarry Company. Moves=1897 move The first move of the house was in 1897 to remove it from the Rocky Hill Quarry Company property in Rocky Hill. Kate McFarlane and Josephine Swann helped create the Washington Headquarters Association of Rocky Hill, which raised the money to purchase the structure and move it away from the quarry. In August 1897, the house was opened to the public. In 1935, ownership was turned over to the state of New Jersey. 1956 move By 1956, the quarry had expanded and the house again was too close to active quarrying. Rockingham was moved a half mile eastward along County Route 518. 2001 move The house made its final move in 2001.

Smyth born at Maryborough, Victoria, took up umpiring in 1947 when injury ended his fast bowling career, and umpired four Test matches between 1962 and 1966. His first match was between Australia and England at Melbourne on 29 December 1962 to 3 January 1963, won by England by 7 wickets. Smyth's partner in this match was Colin Egar. Smyth stood (again with Egar) in the first Test match played by Pakistan in Australia, at Melbourne on 4 December to 8 December 1964, a match drawn when Australia required only 78 further runs with 8 wickets in hand. This was Ian Chappell's debut match. Smyth's last match, also against England at Melbourne with Egar as his colleague, took place exactly three years after his first, on 30 December 1965 to 4 January 1966, resulting in a draw. He continued to umpire at lower levels until 1972. On retirement, Smyth became a long-term President of the Victorian Cricket Association Umpires' Association, adviser to the panel of VCA umpires, and lecturer on the Laws of Cricket, providing precise explanations of the complex code. He was awarded the Order of Australia in 2002 for his services to cricket. Smyth died in Melbourne at the age of 91.

The parish is in the Diocese of Broken Bay. The parish has two separate and distinct communities, based around the two churches: Our Lady Help of Christians (OLHC) Catholic Church at Epping, and St. Gerard Majella Catholic Church at Carlingford. The current Parish Priest is Father Peter Dowd, with Father Joey Frez as the Assistant Priest.  History  The original church building at Epping had the foundation stone laid on 19 May 1907. Up until 1950, Carlingford residents had been a part of the Epping parish, but then the boundaries changed, putting them in Rydalmere Parish ‚Äì a long way away. This emphasised the need for Carlingford residents to have their own church. Father Stephen Ford of St Mary's, Rydalmere, celebrated the first mass in the Carlingford Scout hall. At an evening meeting at the Scout hall some time later, the decisions was made to purchase the burnt-out shell of a Presbyterian church from Campsie for 90 pounds. This was to be situated on Housing Commission land on the corner of Evans Road and Pennant Hills Road, opposite the Carlingford Bowling Club. Extensions to what became Our Lady of the Way church were completed in March 1956, with mass celebrated by Father Ford of Rydalmere. Four years later, Father Robert Nolan was made priest of the new parish of Dundas/Carlingford, but when the five-year lease with the Housing Commission expired in 1962, the church had to be dismantled. The congregation began to look for new premises. On 13 May 1962, the first mass of St Gerard's catholic Church was held in a disused building of the Pennant Hills Wireless Station, located on the north-eastern corner of North Rocks and Pennant Hills Roads, which had been decommissioned in 1959. An old shed was converted into a church. On 3 May 1963, St Gerard's became a separate parish, with Father Nolan transferring from Dundas to become the first parish priest. The St. Gerard Majella Catholic Primary School was opened by the Sisters of Mercy in September, 1964. A new Church building at Carlingford was completed in 1972 and Father Nolan continued as Parish Priest until his retirement in 1978. Father Finian Egan, V.F., was then appointed in his place. From 2000, Carlingford and Epping Parishes began to share many staff and resources, including a priest. On 1 July 2007, the two Parishes reunited to form the Catholic Parish of Epping and Carlingford. However, in the one parish, there remain two separate and distinct communities based around the two churches (which are both of equal status): OLHC at Epping and St Gerard's at Carlingford. In May 2010, allegations of sexual abuse made against Father Finian Egan were raised on the Australian Broadcasting Corporation's The 7:30 Report. These offenses were alleged to have occurred during his time at St Gerard's, and an investigation by the Church upheld the allegations.

Excerpt from The Squash Rackets Association Handbook 1950-51 Affiliated Associations and Overseas Reports Australia \\"The year was without doubt the most outstanding in the history of the association, being dominated by the visitof Mahmoud Kerim, holder of the British and Egyptian open championships and accepted as the finest squash rackets player in the world at present. The Egyptian S.R.A. made the very generous offer of a contribution of half the cost of the return air fare and the Gezira Sporting Club, to which Karim is attached, strongly supported the idea and granted him leave of absence for the tour. Although an outlay of over 500 pounds would be involved and the associations funds at the time stood at about 80 pounds, the executive in inviting Karim were certain of the support of squash followers and of the considerable value in every way of the visit to the game here in Australia. The outcome exceeded even the optimistic expectations of the executive. The presence of this outstanding player created tremendous interest in the sporting world and gave great impetus to the game. Karim played a number of exhibition games in Victoria and New South Wales and won both the professional and open championships of Australia. The Australian championships were conducted in Victoria on the courts of the South Yarra Club. In the final of the Professional Championship, G.J Watson had an excellent opportunity of scoring over our visitor M.A.Karim, when he led eight-three in the fifth game of the final of the professional championship. Karim, however, staged a thrilling finish to win the match. The results were: M.A.Karim (Egypt) beat G.J.Watson (Australia), 4-9,9-0,4-9,9-2,10-8. Karim gave an outstanding display in taking the title from Watson.\\" Following the game, Karim presented his winning racket to Eric Vincent, secretary of this association, who was instrumental in arranging the visit of Karim to Australia. Coaching career After retiring as a player, Karim moved to Montreal, Quebec, Canada, and became a squash coach. He moved back to Egypt at the age of 72 and became Director of Squash at the Gezira Club. Karim died on September 9, 1999 at the age of 83.

In the , Alexandra Headland had a population of 3,958 people. Geography Alexandra Headland is located between Maroochydore CBD and Mooloolaba. The suburb consists of several restaurants, a bowling alley, resorts and the shortest beach in the Maroochy district. The Alexandra Headland Surf Life Saving Club has a building next to the beach. History The rocky headland between the estuaries of the Maroochy and Mooloolah Rivers was once known as Potts Point, named after overseer John Potts employed by William Pettigrew. Potts lived on the land from 1880 to 1890, when it was used to transport timber between Cotton Tree and Mooloolah River by bullock. It was renamed Alexandra Headland in honour of Queen Alexandra, wife of King Edward VII, in 1901. The area was formerly part of William Pettigrew's property. The land was purchased in 1864 at the first land sale in the Maroochy District. Over the next 30 years it was used as Pettigrew's base for his timber business. The area was fenced as a paddock for the bullocks used to haul logs from Cotton tree across Potts Point to the timber depot at Mooloolaba (n√©e Mooloolah Heads). Pettigrew built his house \\"Coolaluthin\\" and his overseers house \\"Wongotha\\" on the Headland. Thomas O'Connor purchased all of Pettigrew's land at both Maroochydore and Mooloolaba in 1903. The land was subdivided and sold as allotments along the ocean front and Buderim Road in August 1915. It was during this time that the name Alexandra Headland was popularised. Seaside cottages were built on the Headland during the 1920s. These were mostly built by the local residents from Woombye and Palmwoods. Plans for O'Connors hotel, 1916 In 1916 O'Connor proposed to develop the Alexandra Residential Hotel on 36 acres behind the main surfing beach on the corner of Alexandra Parade, Main Buderim Mountain Road (now Buderim Avenue) and Edward Street. The architect was Thomas Ramsay Hall. It was constructed between 1923 and 1928. This was the first fully integrated resort complex on the Maroochy coast. The endeavour proved unsuccessful and was sold to the Presbyterian Church. With the ensuing upgrading of transport services and roads as well as further land sales saw the continued progress of Alexandra Headland as a holidays resort. The Headland now boasted a holiday resort with all facilities, including a patrolled surf beach on its northern edge. In the , Alexandra Headland had a population of 3,958 people. Demographics * In the , Alexandra Headland recorded a population of 3,958 people, 51.9% female and 48.1% male. * The median age of the Alexandra Headland population was 45 years, 7 years above the national median of 38. * 68.6% of people were born in Australia.

The film was directed by Don Siegel. It features a number of scenes shot in locations in San Francisco during the late 1950s including shots of the Embarcadero Freeway (then still under construction) and the Sutro Baths. Plot An international drug- smuggling racket plants heroin on unsuspecting American tourists traveling in Asia, so that the dope can pass through customs undetected. Two psychopathic killers, Dancer (Eli Wallach) and Julian (Robert Keith), and their driver McLain (Richard Jaeckel) then collect the contraband, murdering several people along the way. Lt. Ben Guthrie (Warner Anderson) leads the police hunt for the criminals. The head of the heroin ring is a person known only as \\"The Man\\" (Vaughn Taylor) The story begins when an American tourist disembarking in San Francisco from a cruise ship returning from China has his bag stolen by a cabbie. As the cabbie takes off at high speed, he strikes and kills a police officer. The cab later crashes and the cabbie is killed. A police investigation discloses that the cab driver is a heroin addict, and attention is drawn to a heroin smuggling ring. Dancer and Julian have instructions to retrieve the heroin from the unsuspecting tourists and deliver it to a drop point at Sutro's Museum (a real San Francisco location until it burned down in 1966) where the bag containing the heroin is to be left inside an antique ship's binnacle. Dancer and Julian are instructed by their contact, Staples, that they must make the drop and be gone before 4:05 PM. But when it turns out that two of the tourists‚ÄîDorothy Bradshaw and her young daughter, Cynthia‚Äîhad unknowingly disposed of the heroin, Dancer and Julian are in a bind: if they drop off the bag with a large portion of the heroin missing, their lives may be in danger. Dancer and Julian decide that instead of leaving the bag and departing the premises by 4:05, Dancer will stay, meet The Man and explain why the shipment is short. Dancer and Julian also kidnap Dorothy and Cynthia and bring them to Sutro's so they can back up the story. They surprise The Man, who turns out to be a cripple in a wheelchair. But when Dancer meets The Man and explains himself, The Man has an unexpected reaction: he tells Dancer that \\"nobody ever sees me,\\" and that because Dancer has seen him, \\"you're dead.\\" It is implied that this is connected with the fact that he is in a wheelchair, and sensitive about his disability. The Man slaps Dancer across the face with the bag and Dancer, enraged, pushes The Man off a balcony, killing him. Meanwhile, the San Francisco police have spotted the getaway car with Julian, McLain, and the kidnapped Dorothy and Cynthia. When Dancer exits Sutro's, a high speed car chase ensues, filmed in the area of The Embarcadero. When the car becomes trapped at a barrier on the Embarcadero Freeway, there is a shootout between Dancer and the police. Cast * Eli Wallach as Dancer * Robert Keith as Julian * Warner Anderson as Lt.

Reception Paul Mavis, reviewing the Sony Choice Collection release of The Lineup for Movies & Drinks, wrote, \\"A violent, truly sick noir that, despite the outdated clothes and the cars and the now-tame mayhem, seems startlingly modern, The Lineup holds up very well today, registering as one of director Siegel‚Äôs best early efforts.\\" Preservation The Lineup was preserved by the Academy Film Archive, in conjunction with Sony Pictures, in 1997.

The area features a tourist resort, Obudu Cattle Ranch, which hosts an annual mountain running competition called the Obudu Ranch International Mountain Race. The town of Obudu is downstream from the Obudu Dam, which has caused acute scarcity of drinking water in the dry season. The town is approximately 17 kilometers away from Bebi AirportSkyVector - BEB NDB and is a 6-hour drive from Calabar, the capital of Cross River.  Geography  The Obudu Local Government Area is bordered to the north by Vandeikya of Benue State, to the east by the commune of Akwaya in the Republic of Cameroon, and to the south and west by the Local Government Areas of Boki and Bekwarra. The local government headquarters is located in Bette clan, with the Bette-Bendi occupying the central position, and the Ukpe-Alege occupying the southern reach of the geo-cultural spread. The Obanlikwu, Utanga-Becheve, and Utugwang now form an independent Obanlikwu Local Government Area.  History = Early history in Africa  The Obudu geo-cultural area is home to six clans: Bette, Obanlikwu, Bendi, Utuwang, Ukpe-Alege, and Utanga-Becheve, all of which thrived as independent villages with a strong culture of kinship. The origins of the Obudu people are unknown, although it is likely they migrated from somewhere to the east and reached the location they inhabited by the 18th century. The most popular tradition of migration, the Ulanga Legend, points to Ulanga, a mountain peak in the present day village of Amandakureke, in Utanga- Becheve clan as a secondary, or perhaps, tertiary dispersal center. There is a relative consensus in traditions across families that they were displaced at Ulanga by the invasion of a group referred to as Igenyi. This was described as a light-skinned people with soft bunching hair, clad in long-flowing gowns, armed with spears, mounted on horses, and with a large following of black servants.AFR Stoddart, ‚ÄúIntelligence Report on Bette-Bendi Clan‚Äù (Obudu District, Ogo Prof CSE 1/85/4674. File No. Ed 8850A NAE) 7. Extant literature suggests that these could have been Fulani, the Chamba, or Portuguese slave raiders, all three of whose imperialist expeditions in sub-Sahara are recorded to have peaked in the 18th and early 19th century.Anthony Ikpe Ugbe, ‚ÄúObudu Resistance to Colonial Rule ‚Äì 1930‚Äù (BA thesis, University of Calabar, 1986). Another narrative suggests that progenitors of Obudu arrived at a place remembered as Onikal in the Cameroon country, before proceeding to Ulanga, from where the Igenyi dispersed them. Traditional accounts of the Bendi clan report they stayed briefly at Ukwel Unokel (translated as Mountain Unokel), before proceeding to Ulanga, the point of dispersal. It is likely that both Onikal and Ukwel Unokel allude to the same location. Other recollections suggest a shared origin between them, and their Bekwarra neighbors, whom they regard as historical \\"brothers\\". This possibility is reinforced by several cultural commonalities, including mutually intelligible dialects.UJ Ugi, \\"Warfare in Pre-Colonial Betteland\\" (Academic Seminar, Nigerian Defence Academy Kaduna, 2017). In the light of the foregoing, if as believed, the Bekwarra had a powerful connection with the ancient Kwararaffa Empire, it is probable that the displacement referred to in Obudu traditions of migration correlates with the disintegration of Kwararaffa in the 18th century and spreading of its population. What appears to be a disparity in these recollections could be easily reconciled to derive plausible primary and secondary points of dispersal. At any rate, the mild variation in mutually intelligible dialects of its clans suggests splinter group movement, separate migratory experiences, and marginal variance in time of arrival. What, however, seems incontrovertible is that the Obudu clans had taken ownership of the area they inhabited by the 18th century, having emigrated from an easterly Bantu homeland.P.A. Talbot, The Peoples of Southern Nigeria: A Study of their History, Ethnology and Language with an Abstract of the 1921 Census Vol.IV, (London: Cas, 1969) 88-89.  Modern history  With the advent of British colonialism, the six Obudu clans were formally integrated into the then Ogoja province of the Eastern Region of Nigeria. After Nigeria's independence in 1960 and the local government review commission in 1976, Obudu became an autonomous local government council. It has since remained one of the eighteen local government areas of Cross River State. Cross River recruited foreign qualified teachers for Model School, in Obudu Local Government Area.

It had a population of 215 at the 2010 census. History When the American colonies were successful in defeating the British in the U.S. Revolutionary War, some British Loyalists fled the country, traveling to the closest Crown territory, The Bahamas. Following the American Revolution, British Loyalists resettled to Man-O-War Cay. It is one of the early Loyalist settlements in The Abacos. Beginning in 1798, its residents started farming. Early 19th century settlers Benjamin and Eleanor Albury account for 70% of the island's current Alburys. On September 1, 2019, Hurricane Dorian made landfall on Man-O-War Cay in the Abaco Islands after 16:00 UTC with winds of 185 mph (295 km/h) and wind gusts up to 225 mph (360 km/h), tying Dorian with the 1935 Labor Day hurricane as the strongest landfalling Atlantic hurricane on record. There are reports of major damage throughout the islands which has been described as \\"catastrophic damage\\" and \\"pure hell.\\" In the days following the storm, CNN reported that 90% to 100% of all buildings on Man-O-War Cay had sustained damage. Geography This island is about long, but relatively narrow, often less than 100 metres between the harbor and beach side of the island. A section of island called \\"The Narrows\\" by visitors and \\"The Low Place\\" by locals is exceptionally narrow, with a beach on both sides separated by a roadway built into the rock formation between them, less than 10 metres across. The harbor side of the island faces Marsh Harbour, and a beach side runs the length of the opposite shore. Wreckage of the first USS Adirondack, which ran aground in August 1862, is strewn on the reef just northeast of Man-O-War. Governance Man-O-War Cay is represented in Parliament by The MP (Member of Parliament) for the South Abaco constituency, Mr. James Albury. Currently, Man-O-War's representatives on the Hope Town District Council, (which also includes two other neighboring Cays) are: Mr. Jeremy Sweeting and Mr. Arthur Elden. Mr. Jeremy Sweeting serves as the Chief Councillor for their District. Economy The island is notable for its boat building history. William H. Albury was renowned in the country for his boat building skills. He built his first schooner at the age of 14. Albury died in 1972, but the boat building on the Cay still lives on. The last big boat built by the William H. Albury Ship Yard was the Esperanto. The Esperanto was later renamed The William H. Albury in his honor. Today, boat building consists primarily of fiberglass boats, as opposed to wooden vessels. A number of workers commute each day from Marsh Harbour. There are two small grocery stores, a marina, a boat yard, a few gift shops, a hardware and lumber store, two restaurants and a bakery. Golf-carts are rented by several companies (the narrow roads, often unpaved outside of the town centre, only permit the use of golf-carts or other small vehicles). No liquor is sold on the island. During the summer some local houses are rented by vacationing families. Abaco Dinghies built by Joseph Albury on Man- O-War Cay, 2010 The home builders of Man-O-War are known throughout the Bahamas for building homes that \\"are built like ships, but bolted to the land.\\" All the rafters and structure are joined together in a manner similar to ship construction and resist hurricanes very well. Several of the local boat builders still make the occasional \\"Abaco Dinghy\\" in their native woods of Madeira mahogany and other Bahamian hardwoods. They are today considered works of art and sought after by those who appreciate fine old world wooden vessels. Transport Public travel to Man-O-War Cay is available via ferry from Marsh Harbour. Community Most of the residents are in some way or another related to the Albury family. The people are very conservative, and still hold deep affection and loyalty to the British Crown. The majority of the residents are avid church-goers. The island has four churches, one Non- denominational, one Pentecostal, one Methodist, and one Plymouth Brethren. The island has very little crime and is considered clean and well kept. Sport The diving, snorkeling and water sports around the island are available. ReferencesFurther reading *Albury, Haziel L.

It is described as a \\"beer and pretzels game\\". The board in Wiz-War is made up of individual segments that form a labyrinth that the players must navigate. The layout is different each time the game is played and can also be modified by players during gameplay. Wiz-War uses cards to represent (among other things) spells cast by players. Publication history Tom Jolly starting designing Wiz-War in 1983. After several rejections and redesigns he self-published and hand-assembled the first edition of Wiz-War, selling the game through his company Jolly Games. The first edition has low production value, consisting of photocopied typewritten rules, simply designed two-by-three-inch cards, hand-silkscreened cardboard boards, and photocopied chits, all contained in a clear plastic Ziploc bag. The second, third, and fourth editions feature higher production values and a brown box featuring cover art by Jolly. Jolly also self-published two expansions starting in 1988 and 1991, respectively. Wiz-War was then published by Chessex under license from Tom Jolly. Their fourth edition was mostly unchanged from Jolly's fourth edition. The fifth edition was released in 1991 and featured the same box as the previous edition but updated contents. The sixth edition, published in 1993, featured a new larger blue box, new cover and token art by Phil Morrissey, and updated rules. The third expansion with a purple box but the same cover art by Morrissey was also released during this time. The seventh edition, published in 1997, retained the packaging of the sixth edition but updated the contents again. Chessex and Jolly renewed their publishing agreement in 2000 and in 2002 announced an eighth edition would be released, but the release was delayed for many years. Meanwhile, the 7th edition of Wiz-War was allowed to go out of print. In 2009 Jolly announced that he had canceled the contract with Chessex and had reached an agreement to republish the game with Fantasy Flight Games. Fantasy Flight Games released the eighth edition in 2012 with modified rules and completely redone artwork, game pieces, and packaging. Fantasy Flight Games also released two expansions for their edition of the game: Malefic Curses and Bestial Forces. The first expansion added an additional board segment, more content, and allowed another player to join in. The second expansion added three schools of magic, several summonable monsters, and also additional content. All Wiz-War products from Fantasy Flight Games have since gone out of print and are no longer available. On August 22, 2019, Tom Jolly announced via his Twitter that Steve Jackson Games was going to produce the 9th edition of Wiz- War. This was confirmed on October 9th, 2019 via the Steve Jackson Games official website. They formally announced they had acquired the rights to publish their own edition of Wiz-War with an announcement of an artist to be confirmed later. Phil Foglio was signed to produce the art and Steve Jackson Games confirmed they would release the game via Kickstarter to gauge interest. Gameplay An example of an elaborate homemade wood Wiz-War board. This board configuration includes a seventh homemade board segment allowing for larger games. Wiz-War is a turn-based board game for 2‚Äì4 players that takes place in a dungeon. Each player is a wizard, represented on the board by a cardboard wizard token, and starts the game on a particular segment of the board. The center of this segment is the player's home base. Each player has two treasures, also represented by tokens, located in that player's segment. The object of the game is to steal two treasures from opponents while retaining two. If a player successfully steals a treasure but in the meantime loses a treasure to another player, then the player is no further ahead and must start again to try to steal two more treasures. A player who loses both of their treasures is out of the game. A player wins by either placing two treasures belonging to other players on home base in addition to retaining 4 total treasures or by eliminating all other players. Cards are dealt to each player to represent spells that may be cast, objects (both magical and mundane) that may be used, and other actions that may be taken by that player. These cards are generally discarded when used and can be replenished throughout the game. Each player begins the game with fifteen life points that can be lost in a variety of ways. A player who loses all life points is out of the game. The relative simplicity of the game is deceiving; turns can be structured in a highly complex and sophisticated way to take maximum advantage of the cards in a player's hand and avoid interference by other players. Reception In April 1990, Ken Rolston of Dragon magazine called the first edition \\"a cheap-and-cheerful\\" game with \\"fairly primitive components\\". He liked the \\"fast, interesting play with lots of action and entertainment\\", and concluded that \\"It's an ideal game for killing an idle hour.\\" In January 1993, Lester Smith of Dragon magazine liked the fifth edition of the game published by Chessex in 1993. His only criticism was of the cards, which he thought were of poor quality and therefore unlikely to stand up to repeated play, saying \\"the game strikes me as just a bit pricey, considering its components. ... if you like fast-paced, cutthroat, back-stabbing, fang-snapping ... games (at least on occasion), and if you can find other such people to play as well, then the Wiz-War game comes highly recommended.\\" In December 1993, Allen Varney of Dragon magazine reviewed the Chessex's fifth edition, saying, \\"It's a kick, it's a hoot, it's a blast! ... Creative, savvy, elegant in its way, and utterly fearless in inventing bizarre effects, the game achieves a goofy charm.\\" Wiz-War was chosen for inclusion in the 2007 book Hobby Games: The 100 Best. John Wick called Wiz-War \\"an exercise in cutthroat strategy\\" and \\"a damn funny game that will make you cry.\\" ReferencesFurther reading * External links *Tom Jolly's Wiz-War page * *A review of Wiz-War *A review of Wiz-War with photographs of the atypically elaborate board included with the \\"Classic Edition\\". * Category:Board games introduced in 1985 Category:Fantasy board games Category:Board games with a modular board ","title":"Wiz-War"},{"id":"3584888","text":"Plan of the Osireion at Abydos The Osirion or Osireon is an ancient Egyptian temple. It is located at Abydos, to the rear of the Mortuary Temple of Seti I. It is an integral part of Seti I's funeral complex and is built to resemble an 18th Dynasty Valley of the Kings tomb. It was discovered by archaeologists Flinders Petrie and Margaret Murray, who were excavating the site in 1902‚Äì03. The Osirion was originally built at a considerably lower level than the foundations of the temple of Seti, who ruled from 1294‚Äì1279 BC. While there is disagreement as to its true age, Peter Brand says it \\"can be dated confidently to Seti's reign\\".Brand, Peter J.

In the 2016 movie, he is played by Toby Jones. In 2019, he is played by Kevin McNally for the remake of three 'missing' episodes. Mainwaring is the bank manager and Home Guard platoon commander, in the fictional seaside town of Walmington-on- Sea during the Second World War. He has become widely accepted and regarded as a classic British comic character owing to the popularity of both Dad's Army and Lowe's portrayal of him. Many of his quotes, such as, \\"You stupid boy!\\", are engrained in British pop culture. In a 2001 Channel 4 poll Captain Mainwaring was ranked 21st on their list of the 100 Greatest TV Characters. Personality Mainwaring was born in 1885 to Edmund Mainwaring and is a pompous, blustering figure with an overdeveloped sense of his importance, fuelled by his social status in Walmington-on-Sea as the bank manager and his status as Captain and commander of the local Home Guard volunteer unit. He became commander of his home guard unit by saying that he had served as a captain in the last British conflict, despite serving 'somewhere in the Orkneys' during the Great War and only being deployed to France in 1919, the year after the armistice was signed. He was later officially designated as the Captain by the GHQ, in the episode \\"Room at the Bottom\\", after his brief reduction in rank. Despite his claim to be the son of a master tailor, it is revealed that his father was a poor draper and a heavy drinker, as is his profligate brother, Barry, who is a travelling salesman specialising in novelty toys. He has many redeeming qualities: he is essentially brave, loyal and industrious, generally kind-hearted beneath the bluster and unfailingly patriotic. Mainwaring believes in following rules and orders, sometimes to a ludicrous degree and is class-conscious and a snob. Being educated at the local Grammar School ‚Äì as a scholarship student ‚Äì he considers himself middle class and looks down on anyone he considers beneath him, which may be because he struggled to rise above his working class background. He claims to be the son of a successful tailor in Eastbourne, but Lance Corporal Jones reveals that Mainwaring's father was actually a poor draper who sold badly-made workmen's trousers and Barry Mainwaring confirms this. \\"If I had a title I'd be on the board of directors at the bank!\\" he shouts at Sergeant Wilson when the latter gains a title in the episode \\"The Honourable Man\\". Despite his arrogance being encouraged by his status as the bank manager (having started as a clerk and working his way up to assistant chief clerk, chief clerk and eventually manager), Mainwaring reveals in the same episode that he considers it a mere \\"tinpot branch\\" and his career is at a seemingly permanent standstill, as revealed in A. Wilson (Manager)?: whenever he applies for promotions he is always turned down due to his unimpressive background. Mainwaring's pomposity and snobbery work against him, as he is frequently dependent on those in the Home Guard that he considers beneath him, such as Sergeant Wilson, his chief clerk at the bank with whom he shares an antagonistic friendship and Private Walker, a black-marketeer who interrupts during Mainwaring's lectures with a quip or a sly revelation that Mainwaring is benefiting from underhand deals. Mainwaring is particularly jealous of Wilson, who is more relaxed and charming and possesses combat experience that Mainwaring does not and takes every opportunity to remind his sergeant who is the senior. As a bank manager, he is efficient if ruthless and stingy; as a military commander he can at first glance be seen as barely competent, confused by the 24-hour clock, his plans often resulting in chaos. Mainwaring nonetheless managed to pull a group of local shopkeepers \\"up by their bootstraps\\" to become some kind of fighting unit. Mainwaring has no combat experience, which causes tension with the other members of the Home Guard, particularly Wilson, who was a decorated Captain in the Royal Artillery (Mons, Gallipoli) during the First World War. Mainwaring did, however, serve in the Army of Occupation in France, \\"during the whole of 1919 ‚Äî somebody had to clear up the mess.\\"Webber, Perry, Croft p. 132 He volunteered to enlist in 1914 but was rejected with poor eyesight. (During the Second World War, John Le Mesurier, who played Wilson, had been a captain while Arthur Lowe was a Sergeant Major. Lowe tried to enlist in the Merchant Navy prior to the Second World War but was also rejected with poor eyesight.) Despite his shortcomings as a leader, Mainwaring considers himself an excellent military tactician. His height and background are frequently mocked as indicating a Napoleon Complex and often referred to by his nemesis, ARP Warden Hodges. In one episode, \\"A Soldier's Farewell\\", Mainwaring dreams he is Napoleon Bonaparte and is thwarted at the Battle of Waterloo by a Duke of Wellington resembling Wilson.Webber, Perry, Croft p. 198 His pomposity and conviction of his prowess mean that Mainwaring yearns to be in control of any situation and he behaves in an arrogant manner; for instance in the first episode he organised the Home Guard unit and appointed himself commanding officer despite lack of experience and qualifications (and had to wait until the episode \\"Room at the Bottom\\" before he received his commission).Webber, Perry, Croft p. 182 Mainwaring's patriotism can lead to xenophobia (he is not keen on the French, because they are emotional and smell of garlic, the Russians, because of their former alliance with Germany and their communism, the Americans because of their late entry into the war and the fact that many of them have German names, the Italians because of their opera and being the enemy and the Germans for obvious reasons). Mainwaring often refers to Hitler and the Germans as if he is leading his own personal war, insisting that \\"In fact I do wish he'd have a go ‚Äì I'm spoiling for a fight\\" in \\"Asleep in the Deep\\", regarding his desire in an air raid to get out of a bunker and face the attacking Germans (who are in planes and beyond his reach). Mainwaring's position as captain of the Home Guard is a great source of pride and he dislikes being reminded that he is merely a volunteer, part-time soldier. In particular, in the episode \\"My British Buddy\\" he is chagrined when Wilson tells an American colonel that the Home Guard are not real soldiers. Mainwaring's patriotism and eagerness to see combat tend to make him overconfident, and \\"I don't want to hear any of that sort of talk, Wilson\\" is a common response when Wilson points out problems. Mainwaring sees all regular British servicemen (\\"Our Boys\\") as exceptionally brave and resourceful, while seeing the Germans as inept and cowardly. Mainwaring's character flaws, however, are presented in a comical rather than a spiteful manner and there is often a sympathetic subtext to his own personal neuroses; it is apparent several times that he devotes his energies to his Home Guard unit for a sense of comradeship and purpose lacking in other parts of his life, such as his career and marriage. On one occasion when his men spurned a parade to play darts against the ARP he expressed bewilderment, saying coming to the platoon is \\"the highlight of my day\\". It is frequently implied that he is trapped in a loveless and unhappy marriage to Elizabeth, his unseen wife, who is domineering, neurotic and withholding of affection. For example, in the 6th series episode 6 \\"If the Cap Fits...\\" Mainwaring reveals he learned to play the bagpipes on his honeymoon in Scotland because \\"there was nothing else to do\\". Captain Mainwaring's home address was 23 Lime Crescent, Walmington-on-Sea and he lived there with his wife. In the episode, \\"My Brother and I\\", Mainwaring admits to Wilson that he had a lonely childhood, without friends and devoted to schoolwork, whereas his brother, Barry, was always popular. It is revealed in \\"Absent Friends\\" that Captain Mainwaring and his wife have a pet cat called Empress. In \\"The King was in his Counting House\\", it is revealed that Captain Mainwaring and his wife have three goldfish. In The Royal Train, Mainwaring reveals he has wanted to drive a train ever since he was a child and that dream comes true. Mainwaring has several redeeming qualities, notably a deep concern for the welfare of the men under his command. His bravery and courage cannot be denied: he is willing to endanger himself for his country and platoon and to take the risks that he orders his men to undertake. In one episode, \\"The Battle of Godfrey's Cottage\\", the platoon thinks the Germans have invaded and Mainwaring, with his men, fights what they think is the German army but turns out to be other members of the platoon. He also clears bricks from a bombed-out corridor which could have fallen at any moment. Mainwaring insists he work in the most dangerous position even though in drawing lots he had picked the safest (\\"Asleep in the Deep\\"). He also places the safety of his country above his own interests. In \\"Command Decision\\", Mainwaring is prepared to relinquish control so that the platoon could gain rifles, arguing that the defence of the country is more important than his ego.Webber, Perry, Croft p. 48 In addition he is prepared to \\"march in the ranks as Private Mainwaring\\" when he is briefly decommissioned as he had never actually been made an officer, implying that he was merely overzealous rather than a control freak. He hates conscientious objectors; he sees them as abnormal as they do not want to fight for their country, as shown when he discovers Private Godfrey was a conchie. However, when he learns Godfrey served at the Battle of the Somme and risked his own life (and received injuries) crawling into No Man's Land to save several men, earning him the Military Medal, he changes his opinion of Godfrey. Mainwaring says he can't understand why Godfrey doesn't wear the medal. Mainwaring is also capable of acting decisively and independently, although not always with the best of results. In \\"A Man of Action\\", Walmington is cut off when a bomb damages the railway and waterworks. Mainwaring imposes martial law and takes power from the Mayor. Under his law people need permits to take a bath and looters will be shot. He changes position when this power is taken from him by an official from GHQ, describing such an act and the imposition of martial law as \\"monstrous\\".Webber, Perry, Croft p. 136 Mainwaring often claims to know something, only to be proven wrong almost immediately. Men under him, however, are mostly devoted to him. At heart, he is a kind-hearted man with a deep- rooted sense of duty. Mainwaring has nearly had two affairs. One is in Mum's Army with a woman called Fiona Gray who joins the Home Guard when they recruit female soldiers. The two start meeting in cafes all over the town. Gossip starts about them and Mrs Gray leaves by train. Another is with a bus conductress in \\"A Soldier's Farewell\\" whom Mainwaring compliments and defends when she is being flirted at. At the end of the episode, when Mainwaring dreams he is Napoleon, he dreams that the bus conductress is Marie Walewska (Napoleon's mistress). In War Dance, Mainwaring claims to have been very vexed at Mrs Mainwaring and gave her a \\"good dressing down\\" when she burnt some sausage rolls. He turns and it is revealed he has a black eye. Mainwaring claims he did it on the wardrobe door, but it was obviously done in a domestic dispute. Walker later jokes, asking if Mrs Mainwaring has a rolling pin. Dad's Army ends with the Second World War still in progress, Mainwaring giving Mrs Fox away when she marries Corporal Jones, because her father is dead. As shown at the start of the first episode, set in 1968, Mainwaring, who was born in 1885, would have been 82 years old then and 60 at the end of the Second World War. In a radio sequel to Dad's Army, It Sticks Out Half a Mile, which is set in 1948 (three years after the Second World War ended), it is revealed that Mainwaring spent two years manufacturing cuckoo clocks in Switzerland. However, the first episode of Dad's Army shines light on Mainwaring's future: briefly set in the then present-day 1968, it features Mainwaring as guest of honour at the launch of Walmington's \\"I'm Backing Britain\\" campaign,Webber, Perry, Croft p. 134 where he is referred to by Wilson as a magistrate, alderman and chairman of the Rotary Clubs for both Walmington and Eastgate. A series of Barclays Bank adverts featured George Mainwaring retiring from his position at the bank, to be succeeded by Pike, to whom Mainwaring nevertheless refers to as 'stupid boy'. Mainwaring appears in one with his granddaughter on their way to her wedding, notwithstanding the fact that in the closing scene of \\"Absent Friends\\", he tells the platoon that his marriage has been childless. Relationship with Sergeant Wilson Mainwaring's class pretensions stand in contrast to his Sergeant, who is genuinely upper middle class. Mainwaring is often bitter about Wilson's wealthy upbringing; being raised by a nanny, a father who held a career in \\"the City\\", and having attended public school, believing it made him \\"wet\\", while his own grammar school background is a positive attribute (Mainwaring went to Eastbourne Grammar School and Wilson went to Meadow Bridge public school). Mainwaring is an inverted snob who believes that it is the class system that prevents his promotion to the higher echelons of the Bank. By contrast, Wilson seems to have no social ambitions at all, is down to earth and easy going and seems amused by Mainwaring's hostility. Ironically, when Mainwaring tries to ingratiate himself with local potentates and dignitaries, they often turn out to be far more interested in talking to Wilson ‚Äì much to Mainwaring's chagrin. This feeds Mainwaring's sense of social inferiority. This comes to a head when in \\"The Honourable Man\\" Wilson inherits a courtesy title and becomes the Honourable Arthur Wilson. Whilst Wilson resented this, Mainwaring became infuriated and did everything in his power to demonstrate that he outranks Wilson, even going to the lengths of telling Wilson when he was allowed to smoke. While believing Wilson to be involved in some kind of orchestrated social conspiracy against him, it transpires that Mainwaring's inverted snobbery goes as far as doing all he can to hold Wilson back from promotion by writing negative reports on him to Head Office ‚Äì as we discover in \\"A. Wilson (Manager)\\". He often rants about how society will be different \\"after the war\\", and is often disdainful of the upper classes and their pretensions. In \\"Wake Up Walmington\\", Mainwaring raves about how after the war, the country will be run by professionals, by people who've worked like him, but does not approve of Hodges being Chief ARP Warden because he is a greengrocer. Mainwaring is generally ill at ease in social situations that require him to communicate with people on an equal social level and this is probably the main reason for his lack of promotion. Mainwaring is prudish and repressed and can be judgmental about people who do not share his moral outlook.Webber, Perry, Croft pp. 131‚Äì132 Contrastingly Wilson is portrayed as flirtatious with women and has slightly more bohemian ideas about sexual morality (as he is in a secret relationship with Private Pike's mother.) We discover in \\"When You've Got to Go\\" that Mrs Mainwaring was the daughter of the (fictional) suffragan Bishop of Clegthorpe and her parents look down on Captain Mainwaring for \\"marrying beneath her\\"; which may go some way to explaining Mainwaring's extreme class consciousness and slight prudery. Mainwaring talks up his own social background by claiming that his father was a \\"Master Tailor\\" but in \\"My Brother and I\\" his brother reveals that he merely owned a draper's shop. On occasion Mainwaring has even described some of Wilson's ideas as \\"Bolshie\\" (i.e. Bolshevik), when he says something along the lines of \\"Let's have none of your Bolshie ideas here!\\". Despite their various issues with each other, Mainwaring and Wilson do have moments during the series where they reach a sort of understanding, if not actual friendship. In the episode \\"Boots, Boots, Boots\\", Mainwaring tells Wilson that he considers him a friend and that he actually admires how Wilson handles the men \\"quietly and subtly\\". In the episode \\"Something Nasty in the Vault\\", Mainwaring and Wilson bond during their time trapped in the bank's vault while holding an unexploded (and potentially unstable) German bomb that was dropped during an air raid, with Mainwaring even going so far as to scratch Wilson's nose for him when it began to itch and Wilson couldn't reach it. And at the end of the episode \\"War Dance\\", a drunken Mainwaring bonds again with Wilson, as they both have been kicked out of their homes by their respective partners that evening and are forced to sleep in Mainwaring's Home Guard office at the church. Catchphrases * \\"You stupid boy!\\" ‚Äì his most famous line, to Pike, on average a couple of times an episode. * \\"Is that you, Jones?\\" ‚Äì usually uttered when Jones has donned some outlandish disguise. * \\"I think you're entering the realms of fantasy there, Jones\\" ‚Äì often his response to some of Jones' more fanciful plans or ideas. * \\"Just testing you Wilson\\" ‚Äì often said when Wilson points out an obvious flaw in one of Mainwarings' plans or he corrects one of his factual errors. * \\"Ah, just waiting to see who'd be the first one to spot that\\" ‚Äì whenever a member of the platoon makes a good suggestion that he's missed, or spots an obvious flaw in one of his plans. * \\"Oh, there's no time for that sort of thing\\" or \\"There's not time for all this red tape\\" ‚Äì usually to Wilson if his deputy is pointing out that permission ought to be obtained first. * \\"Hello ... Elizabeth?\\" ‚Äì when answering telephone calls from his wife Elizabeth, in an almost sheepish and low voice. * \\"Don't be absurd\\" / \\"How dare you!\\" ‚Äì usually in response to a statement that contradicts Mainwaring's delicate British sensibilities. * \\"Come away, Wilson\\" ‚Äì always in response to one of Hodges' tantrums. * \\"Let's not have any of that sort of talk here\\" ‚Äì whenever a member of the platoon makes a comment even slightly criticising the British or a positive comment about the Germans. * \\"Good, good- What!\\" ‚Äì When told some bad or distressing news which he, at first, does not recognise or comprehend at once. * \\"This is war, you know!\\" / \\"Don't you know there's a war on?\\" ‚Äì whenever a platoon member (usually Wilson or Godfrey) trivialises an aspect about the war. * \\"That's a typical shabby Nazi trick!\\" ‚Äì whenever he hears of something that the Nazis are formatting against him and his men. * \\"Oh no, my men wouldn't do a thing like that.\\" ‚Äì his pro forma denial of any accusation against his men. * \\"We're not savages, we're British!\\" ‚Äì Mainwaring uses this remark when a member of the Platoon attempts some sort of vandalism or damage to achieve a goal. An example is in Menace from the Deep where the Platoon are trapped on a pier overnight with no food. Mainwaring makes the Platoon win the chocolate from a machine fairly when breaking the glass would allow them easy and convenient access to the only nutrition available to them.Webber, Perry, Croft p. 140 * \\"Stop talking in the ranks!\\" ‚Äì said when Mainwaring wants silence. Tributes Statue of Captain Mainwaring, erected in Thetford in June 2010The British sitcom Goodnight Sweetheart paid tribute to Dad's Army in episode one of its second series in 1995, \\"Don't Get Around Much Any More\\". Here, lead character Gary Sparrow ‚Äì a time-traveller from the 1990s ‚Äì goes into a bank in 1941 and meets a bank manager named Mainwaring and his chief clerk named Wilson, both of whom are in the Home Guard. When he hears the names Mainwaring and Wilson, Gary begins singing the Dad's Army theme song. In June 2010, a statue of Captain Mainwaring by sculptor Sean Hedges-Quinn was erected in the Norfolk town of Thetford, where most of the TV series Dad's Army was filmed. The statue shows Captain Mainwaring sitting upright on a simple bench in Home Guard uniform, with his swagger stick across his knees. The statue is mounted at the end of a winding brick pathway with a Union Flag patterned arrowhead to reflect the opening credits of the TV series and the sculpture has been designed so that one can sit next to Captain Mainwaring and have one's photo taken. Other Portrayals In the 2016 film based on the sitcom, Mainwaring is played by Toby Jones. In 2019, the three episodes of Dads Army that are missing from the BBC archives were re-made by UKTV Channel GOLD, in which actor Kevin McNally took on the mantle of Captain Mainwaring.

It is one of the most important railway lines in New Zealand and was one of the first to be built, with construction commencing in the 1860s. At Christchurch it connects with the Main North Line to Picton, the other part of the South Island Main Trunk. Construction Construction of the Main South Line falls into two main sections: from Christchurch through southern Canterbury to Otago's major city of Dunedin; and linking the southern centres of Dunedin and Invercargill, improving communication in southern Otago and large parts of Southland. Construction of the first section of the line began in 1865 and the whole line was completed on 22 January 1879. Christchurch-Dunedin section The Canterbury provincial government built and opened the first public railway in New Zealand, the Ferrymead Railway, on 1 December 1863. A line south to connect with major South Canterbury centres, northern Otago and Dunedin was desired, and on 24 May 1865 construction of what was then termed the Canterbury Great South Railway began. The Canterbury Provincial Railways were broad gauge, , significantly wider than the gauge that later became New Zealand's uniform gauge. The first section of the line was opened to Rolleston on 13 October 1866. Beyond Rolleston, three routes south were considered: * A route well inland to cross major rivers in narrower places. * A coastal line through fertile country. * A compromise between the two, following the most direct route and crossing major rivers at more reasonable places than the coastal route. The third option was chosen and the line was built through an at times relatively barren part of the Canterbury Plains towards Rakaia. By the time the line reached Selwyn in October 1867, 35 km from central Christchurch the provincial government was so short of finances that construction was temporarily halted. In 1870, Julius Vogel announced his \\"Great Public Works Policy\\" and placed a high priority on the completion of a line between Christchurch and Dunedin. The act of parliament that established the nation's uniform gauge as granted Canterbury an exemption, permitting it to extend its gauge line to Rakaia, which was done on 2 June 1873. Soon after this, the provincial government recognised the need to conform with the uniform gauge and the broad gauge was phased out by 6 March 1876. Construction not only progressed south from the Christchurch end and north from Dunedin, but also from the intermediate ports of Timaru and Oamaru in both directions. Construction was swift through the 1870s, and on 4 February 1876, Christchurch was linked with Timaru. Just under a year later, on 1 February 1877, the line was complete all the way from Christchurch to Oamaru in north Otago. At the southern end, the Dunedin and Port Chalmers Railway opened on 1 January 1873, the first gauge line in New Zealand. Most of this line became part of the Main South Line, with construction progressing north from a junction at Sawyers Bay, leaving the final two kilometres to become the Port Chalmers Branch. A difficult hillside climb out of Dunedin was encountered, with construction taking a significant length of time. For this reason, the line from Dunedin met that advancing south from Oamaru at Goodwood, midway between Palmerston and Waikouaiti, some 310 kilometres south of Christchurch but only 57 kilometres north of Dunedin. The construction south from Oamaru included the creation of two short branch lines along the way, the Moeraki Branch and the Shag Point Branch. On 7 September 1878 the route from Christchurch to Dunedin was opened in its entirety. Dunedin- Invercargill section The railway from Dunedin to Clutha was one of the first railways to be built under Vogel's \\"Great Public Works Policy\\". Authorised by the Railways Act 1870 at a cost of ¬£5,000 per mile, the line was the first major line constructed to gauge. Construction was rapid, and the first 10 km section south from Dunedin to Abbotsford opened on 1 July 1874. On 1 September 1875 the line opened to Balclutha; the major town of the lower Clutha River region and 84 kilometres from Dunedin. At the Invercargill end, construction was swift. The first 17 km to Woodlands opened on 11 February 1874, but the whole section to Gore was not completed until 30 August 1875 as a hill cutting at Edendale caved in several times. In December 1875 the lines to Winton and Bluff were narrowed from the standard gauge in two days. Undulating countryside necessitated heavier earthworks to Balclutha, completing the route from Dunedin to Invercargill, and construction was completed on 22 January 1879. An opening function was held at Invercargill. The Commissioner of Railways, Mr Conyer injured himself in a fall at Gore. As the line from Dunedin to Christchurch had been finished on 7 September 1878, a rail link was opened all the way from Invercargill to Christchurch, thus completing the Main South Line. Operation=Passenger services For much of New Zealand's railway history, the passenger service from Christchurch to Dunedin was the flagship of the railway. What is regarded as the country's first \\"express\\" run on 6 September 1878 was a special train hauled by the new Rogers K class locomotive \\"Washington\\". Leaving Christchurch at 6 am the train arrived at Dunedin at 6.40 pm; there was a breakfast with the Governor and other official guests at Oamaru, passengers were left behind at intermediate stops, and the train was assisted by the Double-Fairlie \\"Josephine\\" between Oamaru and Seacliff (where the engine was left for fitters as Ben Verdon the \\"K\\" driver made \\"Josephine\\" do too much of the work). When trains began to run between Christchurch and Invercargill in a day in November 1904, the main passenger services on the Dunedin-Invercargill section were essentially an extension of the Christchurch-Dunedin trains. When the line was completed in the late 19th century, trains took 11 hours to travel from Christchurch to Dunedin and were usually headed by steam engines of the original J class or the Rogers K class, except on the hilly section south of Oamaru where the T class was used. In 1906, the A class was introduced and maintained an eight- hour schedule, though they soon handed over duties to the superheated AB class of 1915. The introduction of the J class and JA class in 1939 and 1946 respectively was the final development in steam motive power, and they took just 7 hours 9 minutes to haul the \\"South Island Limited\\" express from Christchurch to Dunedin. During their heyday, these steam-hauled expresses were famous for the speeds they attained across the Canterbury Plains along a section of track near Rakaia nicknamed the \\"racetrack\\". They were replaced on 1 December 1970 by the Southerner, headed by DJ class diesel-electric locomotives. Steam engines continued to operate Friday and Sunday night expresses, and they were the last steam passenger trains in New Zealand. This makes New Zealand unusual, as steam saw out its final days on quiet, unimportant branch lines in most countries, while the last regular services operated by New Zealand's steam engines were prominent express passenger trains. This was because the trains' carriages were steam heated, so separate steam heating vans with boilers were required. So on 26 October 1971, an express from Christchurch to Invercargill became the last regular service in New Zealand to be hauled by a steam locomotive. The Southerner ran to an even faster schedule than the \\"South Island Limited\\". The journey between Christchurch and Dunedin was initially cut to just 6 hours 14 minutes, and by utilising two DJs north of Oamaru and three south, the schedule was further cut to 5 hours 55 minutes. Part of these gains resulted from the Southerner not carrying mail, while the South Island Limited was slowed down by handling mail. When many branch lines were open, local passenger services and \\"mixed trains\\" of both passengers and freight were a regular sight on the Main South Line as they made their way to their branch destination, but such trains were progressively cancelled during the 20th century and ceased to exist entirely a number of decades ago. An evening railcar service operated in the middle of the 20th century and took 6 hours 10 minutes between Christchurch and Dunedin: it was cancelled in April 1976. The Main South Line was used in Dunedin to provide commuter services both north to Port Chalmers and south to Mosgiel. In the days of steam, AB, B, and BA classes operated suburban trains, though railcars were used on occasion until 1967. In 1968 commuter services were dieselised and operated by the DJ class, or sometimes the DI class and DSC class. The Port Chalmers services lasted 11 more years and were cancelled in late 1979, followed by the Mosgiel services in December 1982. Between 1908 and 1914, the line to Mosgiel was double-tracked because of the commuter traffic, but it has been converted back to single track since the end of commuter services. On 10 February 2002, the Southerner was withdrawn as it was claimed to no longer be economic to operate. As of January 2020, only two regular passenger services utilise small portions of the Main South Line: between Christchurch and Rolleston by the TranzAlpine before it heads along the Midland Line to Greymouth; and the only passenger trains to use Dunedin Railway Station are those operated by Dunedin Railways, which is as of May 2020 is mothballed. Freight services DSG 3127 with a shunt of empty timber wagons at Lyttelton Until the 1960s, there was little focus on long- distance freight between the major centres. Instead, the Main South Line was used to feed its many branch lines, with the majority of goods trains being local services between regional areas and major centres or harbours in Christchurch (Lyttelton), Timaru, Oamaru, Dunedin (Port Chalmers), and Invercargill (Bluff). A good example of how regionalised this traffic was comes from the Dunedin-Invercargill portion of the line. North of Clinton were five branches whose traffic essentially ran to and from Dunedin/Port Chalmers, while south of Clinton were four branches whose traffic essentially ran to or from Invercargill/Bluff. As this short-distance local traffic declined in the 1950s and 1960s and branch lines closed, long-distance freight increased, with through services between the major centres rising to prominence. The concentration of exports on fewer ports and the development of containerisation spurred on long-distance freight, and the first freight train from Christchurch to Invercargill was introduced in December 1970 on a 16-hour schedule. Today, to meet the demands of modern business and to compete with road transportation, operations continue to be enhanced, and much traffic comes in the form of bulk cargo from large customers. Although passenger services no longer exist, the future of long-distance bulk freight on the line appears secure and the Main South Line is an important link in New Zealand's transport infrastructure.

The complex outcrops at the exposed western end of the Capricorn Orogen, a 1,000 km-long arcuate belt of folded, faulted and metamorphosed rocks between two Archean cratons; the Pilbara craton to the north and the Yilgarn craton to the south. The Gascoyne Complex is thought to record the collision of these two different Archean continental fragments during the Capricorn Orogeny at 1830‚Äì1780 Ma. The Gascoyne Complex is separated from the Yilgarn Craton to the south by a major fault, the Errabiddy Shear Zone. To the east and northeast rocks of the complex are overlain unconformably by fine-grained Mesoproterozoic sedimentary rocks of the Edmund Basin and Collier Basin (formerly known as the Bangemall Basin). Several inliers of granite within these sedimentary basins also belong to the Gascoyne Complex. To the west, the Gascoyne Complex is overlain unconformably by sedimentary rocks of the Phanerozoic Carnarvon Basin. To the north, schist of the Gascoyne Complex probably pass with decreasing intensity of metamorphism into metamorphosed sedimentary rocks of the upper Wyloo Group. The Gascoyne Complex is divided into two parts, the 1840‚Äì1620 Ma northern and central Gascoyne Complex, and the 2005‚Äì1970 Ma Glenburgh Terrane in the southern Gascoyne Complex. The two are separated by a major east-southeast trending fault, the Chalba Shear Zone. Rocks of the Glenburgh Terrane do not outcrop at surface north of the Chalba Shear Zone, but it is unclear as to whether or not rocks of this terrane floor all or part of the central and northern Gascoyne Complex. The Gascoyne Complex has been shaped by four orogenies, the most important and widespread of which were the 1830‚Äì1780 Ma Capricorn Orogeny and the 1680‚Äì1620 Ma Mangaroon Orogeny. Both of these orogenies were marked by extensive folding, faulting and metamorphism, and were accompanied by the intrusion of large volumes of granite referred to as supersuites. The effects of the oldest orogeny, the 2005‚Äì1960 Ma Glenburgh Orogeny, although known only from the southern end of the complex, reflect a period of substantial granite magmatism and intense deformation and metamorphism. The Neoproterozoic Edmundian Orogeny mainly consists of the reactivation of earlier formed faults in the Gascoyne Complex, along with folding and faulting of the overlying Edmund and Collier basins.  Glenburgh Terrane  In this section the component rock units of the Gascoyne Complex, and the orogenies that shaped the complex, are discussed in order of decreasing age.  Halfway Gneiss  This rock unit is exposed only in the Glenburgh Terrane at the southern end of the Gascoyne Complex. The gneiss is a composite of c. 2540 Ma granites and c. 2000 Ma granites that were together deformed and metamorphosed during the Glenburgh Orogeny. Although the c. 2540 Ma granites are Archean in age, they are younger than any known granites from the Yilgarn Craton to the south. The c. 2000 Ma component of the Halfway Gneiss overlaps with the age of the Dalgaringa Supersuite (2005‚Äì1960 Ma), and probably represents an intensely deformed portion of the supersuite.  Moogie Metamorphics  The Moogie Metamorphics consist of schist and gneiss, which represent deformed and metamorphosed sandstone, siltstone and shale, and carbonate rocks. This rock unit is known only from the Glenburgh Terrane. These rocks were first deformed during the 2005‚Äì1960 Ma Glenburgh Orogeny, when they were also intruded by granites of the Dalgaringa Supersuite.  Dalgaringa Supersuite  The Dalgaringa Supersuite comprises sheets, dykes and veins of 2005‚Äì1985 Ma foliated and gneissic tonalite, granodiorite, quartz diorite and monzogranite, intruded by a large pluton of c. 1975 Ma mesocratic and leucocratic tonalite. The oldest, and possibly most abundant, rock type is a mesocratic, foliated to gneissic diorite to tonalite, which is typically pegmatite banded. At any given locality this rock type is intruded by several granite phases, typically in the following order: foliated biotite monzogranite and leucocratic tonalite, then biotite granodiorite and monzogranite and, finally, biotite monzogranite, syenogranite and pegmatite.  Central and northern Gascoyne Complex = Morrissey Metamorphics  The Morrissey Metamorphics are a group of metamorphic rocks dominated by pelitic and psammitic schists derived from the metamorphism of shales and sandstones. This unit also includes some metamorphosed mafic igneous rocks and carbonate rocks. The sedimentary precursors to the Morrissey Metamorphics were deposited after about 1840 Ma, and were deformed and metamorphosed at amphibolite facies during the 1830‚Äì1780 Ma Capricorn Orogeny, before being intruded by granites of the Moorarie Supersuite at 1810‚Äì1780 Ma.  Pooranoo Metamorphics  The Pooranoo Metamorphics are a sequence of biotite-muscovite-quartz- plagioclase+/-sillimanite schists and gneisses with an interpreted psammitic and pelitic (sedimentary) protolith. They have attained a peak of amphibolite facies, within the sillimanite grade. The Pooranoo Metamorphics were deposited at the end of the Capricorn Orogeny. The maximum depositional age of the Pooranoo Metamorphics is contrained by detrital zircon dates of 1680 +/- 14 Ma derived from arenaceous metasediments. The Pooranoo Metamorphics are intruded by granites of the Durlacher supersuite, which has been dated at 1680 Ma. The metamorphic grade of the Pooranoo Metamorphics varies, with two belts of different metamorphic character and timing during the Mangaroon orogeny recognised. These are divided by the Ti Tree Creek Lineament, a multiply reactivated fault which bisects the Gascoyne Complex. : North of the Ti Tree Creek Lineament the Pooranoo Metamorphics and Durlacher granites endured Abukuma Facies Series low-pressure, high-temperature Sillimanite grade metamorphism, with a date of 1680-1675 Ma returned from zircons : South of the Ti Tree Lineament, the Pooranoo Metamorphics and Durlacher granites endured a high-pressure, high-temperature Barrovian Facies Series metamorphic event, typically reaching garnet grade. This occurred at 1665 - 1650 Ma.  Granitic intrusive suites = Moorarie Supersuite  The Moorarie Supersuite consists of voluminous granites intruded across the Gascoyne Complex at c. 1830‚Äì1780 Ma and are syntectonic with the Capricorn Orogeny. The granites are predominantly biotite granites. The Moorarie Supersuite includes granites of the Minne Creek batholith which include a molybdenum-tungsten mineralised leucocratic granite porphyry.  Durlacher Supersuite  The Durlacher Supersuite is a granite suite which was intruded into the Gascoyne Complex during the Mangaroon Orogeny. It is composed of two suites of granites * A northern belt of S-type (two-mica) granites (the Minnie Creek Suite) * A southern belt of S-type and I-type granites Most intrusions of this age are heavily sheared orthoclase porphyroclastic granites. Geochronology on the granites is sparse, but has constrained the intrusions to 1680 to 1620 Ma, which is syntectonic to post-tectonic with the Mangaroon Orogeny.  Peripheral units  Several fold and thrust belts and sedimentary basins are peripheral, and potentially related, to the Gascoyne Complex. Between approximately 2000-1800 Ma, on the northern margin of the Yilgarn Craton, the c. 1890 Ma Narracoota Volcanics of the Bryah Basin formed in a transverse back-arc rift sag basin during collision. Culmination of the cratonic collision resulted in the foreland sedimentary Padbury Basin. To the east the Yerrida and Earaheedy Basins were passive margins along the Yilgarn's northern margin. The c. 1830 Ma phase of the Capricorn Orogeny resulted in northeast- southwest deformation of the Bryah-Padbury Basin with flood basalts in the Yerrida Basin. The Gascoyne Complex rocks, namely the Yarlarweelor Gneiss are thrusted eastward onto the upper rock units of the Bryah Basin and the whole succession of the Padbury Basin. The Yerrida Basin was affected by this wast- west compression adjacent to the Goodin Fault. This event is incongruous with the c. 1830 Ma Capricorn Orogeny, is strike-slip to oblique-slip in nature and is most likely the Mangaroon Orogeny.

History  Lao New Year is a popular English name for a traditional celebration known in Laos as \\"Pi Mai\\" or \\"Songkran\\" (in Lao language). Lao New Year widely celebrated festival in Laos. The festival is also celebrated by the Lao in Australia, Canada, France, the UK and the US.. Lao New Year takes place in April, the hottest time of the year in Laos, which is also the start of the monsoon season. Lao New Year takes place at virtually the same time as the new year celebrations of many countries in South Asia such as Bangladesh, Cambodia, China (Dai People of Yunnan Province), India, Myanmar, Nepal, Thailand, and Sri Lanka.  Festival dates  The official festival lasts for three days from 14 to 16 April, although celebrations can last more than a week in towns such as Luang Prabang. The first day is the last day of the old year. Houses and villages are properly cleaned on the first day. Perfume, water and flowers are also prepared for the Lao New Year. The second day of the festival is the \\"day of no year\\", a day that falls in neither the old year or the new year. The last day of the festival marks the start of the new year. In Laos, Lao New Year is a government holiday, with state offices closed during those three days.  Traditions = Water  Pi Mai celebration, flour throwing Water is used for washing homes, Buddha images, monks, and soaking friends and passers-by. Students first respectfully pour water on their elders, then monks for blessings of long life and peace, and last of all they throw water at each other. The water is perfumed with flowers or natural perfumes. Some people prefer flowers in the water to give a pleasant smell, as well as adding cologne/perfume. Over the years another tradition has developed with Lao New Year: people will smear or throw cream (shaving cream or whipped cream) or white powder on each other during the celebrations.  Sand  Sand is brought to the temple grounds and is made into stupas or mounds, then decorated before being given to the monks as a way of making merit. There are two ways to make the sand stupas. One way is to go to the beach, and the other way is to bring sand to the vat, or temple. Sand stupas are decorated with flags, flowers, white lines, and splashed with perfumed water. Sand stupas symbolize the mountain, Phoukhao Kailat, where King Kabinlaphr√¥m's head was kept by his seven daughters.  Animals  Another way to make merit at this time is to set animals free. The Lao believe that animals need to be free. The most commonly freed animals are tortoises, fish, crabs, birds, eels and other small animals.  Flowers  Flowers are gathered to decorate Buddha images. In the afternoons people collect fresh flowers. Senior monks take the younger monks to a garden filled with flowers, where they pick flowers and bring back to the wat to wash. People who didn't participate in the flower picking bring baskets to wash the flowers so the flowers can shine with the Buddha statues. In the evening lao people usually go to the temple to worship the Buddhas.  Beauty pageant  There is an annual beauty pageant in Luang Prabang to crown Miss Pi Mai Lao (Miss Lao New Year). There are many beauty pageants in Laos, but the old capital Luang Prabang is known for its Nangsangkhan pageant. There are seven contestants, each one symbolizing one of King Kabinlaphr√¥m's seven daughters.  Music and dance  During Lao New Year, there are many spectacles including traditional Lao music and social dancing, molam, and lamv√¥ng (circle dancing). During the daytime many people go to the temple to worship, hoping to have a healthier and happier life in the new year. During the evening, people of all ages go to the temple for entertainment. A greeting ceremony of Lao New Year in Ban Thasala muang Khamkeut, Bolikhamsai Province.  Greetings  In greetings there are several ways to wish someone a happy Lao New Year. The most common expressions are s√¥k di pi mai, souksan van pi mai or sabaidi pi mai, which can be translated into English as \\"Happy New Year\\".

This allows the fabricated deck both to directly bear vehicular loads and to contribute to the bridge structure's overall load- bearing behaviour. The orthotropic deck may be integral with or supported on a grid of deck framing members, such as transverse floor beams and longitudinal girders. All these various choices for the stiffening elements, e.g., ribs, floor beams and main girders, can be interchanged, resulting in a great variety of orthotropic panels. Decks with different stiffnesses in longitudinal and transverse directions are called 'orthotropic'. If the stiffnesses are similar in the two directions, then the deck is called 'isotropic'. The steel deck-plate-and-ribs system may be idealized for analytical purposes as an orthogonal-anisotropic plate, hence the abbreviated designation ‚Äúorthotropic.‚Äù Discussion The stiffening elements can serve several functions simultaneously. They enhance the bending resistance of the plate to allow it to carry local wheel loads and distribute those loads to main girders. They also increase the total cross-sectional area of steel in the plate, which can increase its contribution to the overall bending capacity of the deck (i.e. the deck plate acts as a top flange in a box or I beam girder). Finally, the stiffeners increase the resistance of the plate to buckling. The same structural effects are also true of the concrete slab in a composite girder bridge, but the steel orthotropic deck is considerably lighter, and therefore allows longer span bridges to be more efficiently designed. Resistance to use of an orthotropic deck relates mainly to its cost of fabrication, due to the amount of welding involved. In addition, it must be prefabricated rather than assembled on site, which offers less flexibility than in-situ concrete decks. Orthotropic decks have been prone to fatigue problems and to delamination of the wearing surface, which, like the deck, is also often of a very thin material to reduce weight. Invention A German Engineer Dr. Cornelis of MAN Corporation was issued German patent No. 847014 in 1948. MAN's design manual was published in 1957 in German. In 1963 AISC published their manual based on North American design practices. Orthotropic deck bridges Thousands of orthotropic deck bridges are in existence throughout the world. Despite the savings and advantages (up to 25% of total bridge mass can be saved by reducing deck weight, as the weight reductions extend to cables, towers, piers, anchorages, and so forth), the US has only about 60 such bridge decks in use . About 25% of orthotropic in the US are in California, including the San Mateo-Hayward Bridge, which is one of the first major bridges in the US to be built using an orthotropic deck. Some very large cable-supported bridges, plus current record span (cable-stayed bridges and suspension bridges) would not be feasible without steel orthotropic decks. The longest or record span box girder, slant-leg bridges; arch bridges; movable bridges and two Norwegian floating bridges all use orthotropic decks. The Millau Viaduct a cable-stayed bridge of Millau, France has the largest orthotropic steel deck area of any single bridge. The lower total gross weight of the superstructure allowed bridge launching from both ends of the Millau Viaduct. The Akashi Kaiky≈ç Bridge's orthotropic deck allowed the Japanese to build the longest span at about , or 50% longer than the Golden Gate Bridge. Orthotropic decks permit a very shallow deck depth which reduces the steepness of approach gradients and hence their costs. The form is also widely used on bascule and other moveable bridges where significant savings in the cost of the mechanical elements can be made where a lighter deck is used. The El Ferdan Railway Bridge across the Suez Canal of Egypt is the record span bridge. The Erasmus Bridge has an orthotropic deck for both its cable-stayed bridge and bascule span. The Danziger Bridge of New Orleans is a very large vertical lift bridge. Bridge deck replacements Underside of wider 2000-2001 orthotropic replacement deck of Lions Gate Bridge It is possible to refit a bridge originally designed with a concrete or non-structural deck to use a lighter orthotropic deck, which has been done to preserve or extend the load-carrying life of key or landmark bridges around the world. It was first utilized in North America in 1975, on the Lions Gate Bridge in Vancouver, which was completed in 1938 with exceptionally light design. The original concrete deck of the North Viaduct of the Lions Gate Bridge was replaced with a lighter and wider orthotropic deck, carried out in sections using a series of short closures of the bridge. A quarter century later, an even more ambitious orthotropic replacement of the entire original suspended structure of the main suspension portion of the Lions Gate Bridge was undertaken 2000-2001 and completed without interruption in peak-hour traffic, resulting in the 63-year old bridge, not designed for durability, getting a new lease of life. From 1982 to 1986, the Golden Gate Bridge was refitted with an orthotropic deck Another notable example, San Francisco‚Äôs Golden Gate Bridge, completed in 1937, originally used a concrete deck. Salt carried by fog or mist reached the rebar, causing corrosion and concrete spalling.

The -long, two-lane north-south road is a popular truck route connecting SR 70 in Fort Pierce to the south and U.S. Route 1 (SR 5) between Viking and Florida Ridge to the north. While urbanization is encroaching upon SR 713 north of SR 68, most of SR 713 passes through woodland interspersed with orange groves. Near the southern terminus is Fort Pierce Jai-Alai. Route description SR 713 begins as Kings Highway at the intersection between SR 70 and an interchange with Florida's Turnpike (exit 153) and heads north. North of the SR 614 intersection, it veers to the northeast and changes names to Turnpike Feeder Road. The road terminates at US 1 just south of the St. Lucie-Indian River county line. History According to a 1960 map prepared by the State Road Department (forerunner to Florida Department of Transportation), Kings Highway had a State Road 607 designation‚Äîat the same time as Emerson Road (current SR 607) and Indrio Road (part west of Kings Highway is now SR 614), with Angle Road being SR 607A at the time. Prior to the completion of Interstate 95 in Florida in the early 1980s, it was commonly used to \\"bridge the gap\\" between Florida's Turnpike (SR 91) and the Interstate highway. As sections of I-95 were completed between SR 60 near Vero Beach and SR 70 in Fort Pierce between 1978 and 1980, the common methodology of using SR 713 to travel between I-95 and the Turnpike evolved: *Until early 1978, northbound motorists turned west onto Indrio Road (SR 614) and north onto Emerson Road (SR 607). After of Emerson Road, northbound motorists turned west onto SR 60, which connected with I-95 six miles (10 km) from SR 607. *When a nine-mile (14 km)-long section of I-95 opened in 1978, northbound motorists stayed on Indrio Road (SR 614) after turning left from SR 713. The then-new I-95 interchange was three miles (5 km) to the west of SR 713 on Indrio Road. *When an additional six miles (10 km) of I-95 were opened in late 1978, motorists were directed eastward on SR 68 from SR 713 to connect with I-95. Most stayed with this route after a -long section (to SR 70) was opened in early 1979, even though Florida Department of Transportation posted signs encouraging them to avoid SR 713 altogether and use SR 70. The final segment of I-95 to be finished in Florida (Stuart to Palm Beach Gardens) was finally opened in 1987.

He received his higher education at Oberlin College and for a year studied law at Harvard Law School. Career Nunn's house in Telluride In 1880, Nunn moved to Telluride, Colorado, where he started a law practice and dealt in real estate. By 1890 he had become involved in gold mining, journalism, and banking within the small community. His bank, the First National Bank of Telluride, was the only bank in the county at the time. In order to help his mining operations prosper, Nunn financed the world‚Äôs first A/C power plant used for industrial purposes (mining), the Ames Hydroelectric Generating Plant. This plant, built by George Westinghouse, became part of the Nunn‚Äôs Telluride Power Company which would later become part of Utah Power and Light. Nunn continued investing in the power industry and helped design the Ontario Power Plant in Niagara Falls, Ontario. To staff the power plants Nunn created a work study program called the Telluride Institute, headquartered near the Olmsted Power Plant, located in the Provo Canyon near Orem, Utah. Upon completion of the course the graduates were sent on to gain further education through the issuance of scholarships. Many of these students went on to study at Cornell University, where they resided at Telluride House, managed by Telluride Association, which Nunn founded. Nunn was forced to sell his portion of Telluride Power in 1912 due to disagreements with other stockholders, which led to the closure of the Olmsted educational site and the suspension of the Telluride Institute program. Accomplishments The Telluride Association at Cornell (and in time elsewhere) remained, and still remains, in existence. Its mission eventually expanded to encompass a variety of intellectually intense residential houses for college students, summer programs for high school students, scholarships, and other activities, all coeducational. Finally he founded Deep Springs College in 1917, a highly regarded two-year college built on the \\"Swinging T Ranch\\" in the remote Deep Springs Valley, California. The college is similar in style to the Telluride Institute, in that students must work while completing their academic requirements and are engaged in a significant measure of self-governance. The New Yorker described the style of education Nunn established at Deep Springs as \\"a novel form of education, a mix of Christian mysticism, imperialist elitism, Boy Scout-like abstinence, and Progressive era learning-by-doing, with an emphasis on leadership training and the formation of strong character.\\" He financially supported American zoologist Charles Otis Whitman's work.Crease, Mary R.S.

He briefly served as Emperor Hui's regent after overthrowing the usurper Sima Lun in 301. He was the fourth of the eight princes commonly associated with the War of the Eight Princes. Early career Sima Jiong was the son of Sima You, Prince Xian of Qi, the younger brother of Jin Dynasty's founder Emperor Wu, making him Emperor Hui's cousin. Sima You's abilities were so highly regarded by both his father Sima Zhao and the officials that, at times, he was considered as the proper heir, first for Sima Zhao, then for Emperor Wu. After Emperor Wu therefore exiled him from the capital Luoyang in 282, he died in 283. Sima Jiong, as the oldest son of his wife Consort Jia, inherited his post, and complained to Emperor Wu about doctors' misdiagnosis. (The doctors, who had thought that they would gain Emperor Wu's favor if they informed him that Prince You was healthy (so that he could indeed go to his principality), had minimized the illness that Prince You was suffering.) As an imperial prince, Sima Jiong had a sizable number of troops under his command. When Sima Lun overthrew Emperor Hui's domineering wife Empress Jia Nanfeng in 300 after she murdered Emperor Hui's crown prince Sima Yu, Sima Jiong was a participant of the coup ‚Äî despite that Empress Jia was his half-maternal-aunt, given that his mother had a hatred with Empress Jia. But Sima Jiong did not receive great rewards afterwards. He therefore resented Sima Lun. Sima Lun, seeing his resentment, tried to appease him by giving him an important military command‚Äîof Xuchang (Ë®±Êòå, in modern Xuchang, Henan). Role in overthrowing Sima Lun Map showing the Wars of the Eight Princes After Sima Lun usurped the throne in 301, he became concerned about Sima Jiong and also Emperor Hui's brother Sima Ying the Prince of Chengdu and distant cousin Sima Yong the Prince of Hejian, each of whom had strong independent commands. He sent his close associates to serve as their assistants. Prince Jiong refused and declared a rebellion to restore Emperor Hui. Prince Ying, Sima Ai the Prince of Changshan (Emperor Hui's brother), and Sima Xin (Âè∏È¶¨Ê≠Ü) the Duke of Xinye (the son of a granduncle of Emperor Hui) all declared support for Prince Jiong. Prince Yong initially sent his general Zhang Fang (ÂºµÊñπ) with intent to support Sima Lun, but then heard that Princes Jiong and Ying had great forces, and so declared for the rebels instead. Sima Jiong's forces initially were stuck in a stalemate against Sima Lun's, but after a major victory Sima Ying's forces scored against another win of Sima Lun's troops, Sima Lun's troops collapsed, and Sima Jiong and Sima Ying's forces approached Luoyang. Sima Lun was captured by officials in Luoyang who declared for the rebellion as well, and forced to issue an edict returning the throne to Emperor Hui. He was then forced to commit suicide. Sun and other associates of Sima Lun were executed. Some thought that a power balance that Emperor Wu had hoped for at his death might be restored, as Princes Jiong and Ying were each given regent titles (and awarded the nine bestowments, in one rare case where the nine bestowments were not signs of an impending usurpation, although Prince Ying declined the bestowments), and many talented officials were promoted into important positions. However, the Princes Jiong and Ying were actually apprehensive of each other's power, and Prince Ying decided to yield the central government regency to Prince Jiong at the time and return to his defense post at Yecheng (ÈÑ¥Âüé, in modern Handan, Hebei). As regent Sima Jiong became arrogant based on his accomplishments. He had his sons created princes, and ran the matters of the central government from his mansion, rarely visiting the emperor or attending the imperial meetings. He enlarged his mansion to be as large as the palace, and he entrusted matters to people who were close to him, and would not change his ways even when some of his more honest associates tried to change his behavior. When Emperor Hui's grandson Sima Shang (Âè∏È¶¨Â∞ö) died in childhood, leaving Emperor Hui without male descendants by 302, Sima Ying was considered the appropriate successor, but Sima Jiong chose to bypass him by recommending the seven-year-old Sima Qin (Âè∏È¶¨Ë¶É) the Prince of Qinghe (Emperor Hui's nephew and the son of his brother Sima Xia (Âè∏È¶¨ÈÅê)) as the crown prince, with intent to easily control the young Crown Prince Qin. Sima Jiong became suspicious of Sima Yong the Prince of Hejian‚Äîbecause Sima Yong had initially wanted to support Sima Lun, until he saw that Sima Lun's cause was hopeless. Sima Yong knew of Sima Jiong's suspicion, and started a conspiracy; he invited Sima Ai the Prince of Changsha to overthrow Sima Jiong, believing that Sima Ai would fail; his plan was then to, in conjunction with Sima Ying, start a war against Sima Jiong. Once they were victorious, he would depose Emperor Hui and make Sima Ying the emperor, and then serve as Sima Ying's prime minister. In winter 302, Sima Yong declared his rebellion, and Sima Ying soon joined, despite opposition from his strategist Lu Zhi (ÁõßÂøó). Hearing that Sima Ai was part of the conspiracy as well, Sima Jiong made a preemptive strike against Sima Ai, but Sima Ai was prepared and entered the palace to control Emperor Hui. After a street battle, Sima Jiong's forces collapsed, and he was executed. His sons Sima Chao (Âè∏È¶¨Ë∂Ö) the Prince of Huailing, Sima Bing (Âè∏È¶¨ÂÜ∞) the Prince of Le'an, and Sima Ying (Âè∏È¶¨Ëã±, note different character from the Prince of Chengdu) the Prince of Jiyang were stripped of their titles and imprisoned. In 305, Sima Jiong's accomplishments were remembered, and his sons were released; Sima Chao was created a minor prince. After Emperor Huai became emperor, he further restored most of Sima Jiong's titles and awarded him a posthumous name. When Emperor Huai was later captured by Han Zhao's emperor Liu Cong, Sima Jiong's sons were captured and executed by Han Zhao forces, and Sima Jiong was left without descendants.

Unusually talented and independent, Mr. Lucas dropped out of Bronx Science High School after the New York City teachers‚Äô strike of 1968 and pursued a career in music.\\" Career Early in his career, Lucas was an R&B; and jazz guitarist, playing with Billy Paul in the early 1970s and then with Miles Davis from 1972 to 1976. It was in Davis' electric band (one that included Pete Cosey, Michael Henderson and Al Foster) that Lucas met percussionist Mtume, who would later become his production partner. The two joined singer Roberta Flack's band in 1976, and toured with her for several years. Following his stint as a touring jazz guitarist, Lucas shifted his focus to songwriting and producing, where he gained both fame and critical praise, at first working as part of a production team with percussionist James Mtume. The two would later go on to write and produce hits for a number of artists, including Stephanie Mills, Phyllis Hyman, Lou Rawls, the Spinners and Roberta Flack. As the 1970s came to a close, Lucas branched out and began to write and produce material by himself. In addition to his own instrumental record (1978), \\"Survival Themes\\", one of his first solo projects was Madonna's 1983 self-titled debut album, including the song \\"Borderline\\". Lucas produced the majority of the album, which sold more than five million copies. Lucas later worked with Rebbie Jackson, Randy Crawford, and The Four Tops on his own. The Four Tops' 1985 \\"Magic\\", included the single \\"Sexy Ways\\" and \\"Maybe Tomorrow\\", a duet between Levi Stubbs and Phyllis Hyman. Lucas was also a member of the short-lived group Sunfire, who released one album in 1982. Lucas produced their single \\"Young Free and Single\\". In 1986, Lucas founded the Jersey City recording studio Quantum Sound. Clients of the studio included the Pet Shop Boys, Jodeci, Jeff Buckley and Sepultura. Personal life and death Lucas's daughter, Lisa Lucas, is executive director of the National Book Foundation. A longtime resident of Montclair, New Jersey, Lucas died of heart disease in New York City, at the age of 65.

History In the late 1970s, FDOT started to put into motion a sequence of events that ultimately resulted in the removal of dozens of miles of roadway from the State maintenance list to county maintenance. Entire State Roads disappeared as their FDOT designations were replaced by County Road signage, while other State Roads had only parts become County Roads (usually with no change in the numbering). In the 1970s, State Road 78 extended from Pine Island Center, near Pine Island Sound on the Gulf Coast to the northernmost part of Lake Okeechobee. In the 1980s, two sections were transitioned to county maintenance: * The westernmost six miles (from Pine Island Center to Cape Coral), also known as Northwest Pine Island Road, became County Road 78. It runs from CR 767 (Stringfellow Road) on Pine Island east over the Matlacha Bridge onto the mainland in northwest Cape Coral, where it connect to SR 78. * North River Road (22 miles of zigzagging road along the north bank of the Caloosahatchee River from SR 31 near Babcock Ranch to SR 29 near LaBelle) was also converted to County Road 78. Brief concurrencies with both SR 31 and SR 29 were also removed. County Road 78A County Road 78A is a spur road off of State Road 78 between Cape Coral and North Fort Myers locally known as Pondella Road. It provides a quicker way for motorists traveling east on CR 78 to access Downtown Fort Myers. The road was known as SR 78A before 1980.

Carroll. Shot in both VistaVision and Technicolor, the film was a Paramount Studios production. The screenplay was written by Ranald MacDougall, based on the play My Three Angels by Samuel and Bella Spewack, which itself was based upon the French play La Cuisine Des Anges by Albert Husson. Mary Grant designed the film's costumes. Plot Three convicts ‚Äì Joseph, Albert and Jules ‚Äì escape from prison on Devil's Island in French Guiana just before Christmas and arrive at a nearby French colonial town. They go to a store managed by the Ducotel family, the only one to give supplies on credit. While there, they notice its roof is leaking, and offer to fix it. They do not actually intend to, but decide to remain there until nightfall, when they will steal clothes and supplies and escape on a ship waiting in the harbor. As they wait, they find that the small family of Felix, Amelie, and daughter Isabelle, is in financial distress and offer their services to hide the trio's all-too- sinister ruse. Joseph even gets to work conning people and falsifying records to make the store prosperous. However, the three felons begin to have a change of heart after they fix a delicious Christmas dinner for the Ducotels made mostly of stolen items. Tensions heighten after store owner Andre Trochard arrives from Paris with his nephew Paul, whom Isabelle fancies. The Trochards plan on taking over the store, which they perceive is unprofitable due to its use of credit. It turns out that Paul is betrothed to another woman, to Isabelle's dismay. Before any action can be taken, both men are bitten by Albert's pet viper, Adolphe, and die nearly instantly. Isabelle finds another love, and the family is happy as the convicts finally ready for their postponed escape. However, while waiting on the docks for their boat to arrive, the threesome reconsiders. Judging that the outside world is likely to be worse than that of the prison, they decide to turn themselves back in. As they walk toward it at film's end halos appear over their heads...followed by one above the cage of Adolphe.

As their name suggests, they are enemies of Superman. Pre-Crisis on Infinite Earths In Pre-Crisis continuity, the Squad originated as the Superboy Revenge Squad, debuting in Superboy #94 (January 1962); the Superman Revenge Squad subsequently appeared in Action Comics #286 (March 1962). Both Squads are composed of aliens from the planet Wexr II, whom Superboy had prevented from achieving galactic conquest. The Squad later grows to include members from other planets, all of whom are sworn enemies of Superman. Many of the Squad's plans to destroy Superman use psychological warfare, including red kryptonite-induced nightmares,\\"The Jury of Super- Enemies!\\", Action Comics # 286 (March 1962) hypnotising Superman into committing destructive acts,\\"Superman Goes Wild!\\", Action Comics #295 (Dec. 1962) and tricking Superman into revealing his secret identity.\\"The End of Clark Kent's Identity!\\", Action Comics #313 (June 1964) They transferred the intelligence of a Superman robot into a super-powered body, making him Wonder Man, and hoping he would destroy Superman with some kryptonite that he was given and to which he was invulnerable. However he realised their plot and, with Superman, threw the ship with such force it would take years for the two members to break free, but Wonder Man then told Superman that his body would soon die. Once they lured Superman into following them to 1,000,000 AD, where he lost his powers and was trapped on the Earth, due to the Sun having turned red by then. He used a miniature Kandorian rocket left in his Fortress of Solitude, after shrinking himself with red kryptonite, to travel back to his own time. They appeared briefly in the first Superman Red/Superman Blue (July 1963) storyline, they were about to attack the Earth after teaming up with Brainiac, but, in that moment, the anti-evil rays Superman developed struck them and they reformed. In their earliest appearances the Squad members appeared hooded in order to keep their identities a secret. Later versions of the Squad wore modified versions of Superman's costume, with the S-shield made of kryptonite and their heads shaved bald in tribute to Lex Luthor. In one of their appearances during Crisis, in DC Comics Presents #87 (November 1985), the Squad sends Superman into a parallel universe, where he meets Superboy- Prime, the sole superhero of Earth-Prime. Although Revenge Squad members went nameless in several stories, those who were identified include leader Rava and Scout 627 (Action Comics #287); Dixo and Vagu (Action Comics #295); Dorx and Krit (Action Comics #380); Dramx-One, Fwom, Jumrox, Klakok, Nryana (Superman #366); Nakox (Superman #367); and Tydru (Superman #368). Post-Crisis on Infinite Earths In Adventures of Superman #543 (February 1997), a new version of the Revenge Squad is introduced. The new Squad is established by Morgan Edge, who assembles various characters with a grudge against Superman and attempts to frame Lex Luthor as their leader. Members include: *Morgan Edge *Maxima *Barrage *Riot *Misa *Anomaly In Action Comics #736 (August 1997), Edge assembles another version of the team, with the same purposes. Members include: *Morgan Edge *Baud *Barrage (only returning field member) *Parasite *Rock Post-Infinite Crisis, Lex Luthor constructs a new team as part of the \\"Superman: Last Son\\" storyline. Superman himself joins the team to fight against General Zod's army of evil Kryptonians. Members include: *Metallo, now armed with several kinds of Kryptonite, including gold. *Parasite *Superman *Lex Luthor *Bizarro  DC Rebirth  Following 2016's Superman Reborn events, a new Superman Revenge Squadron appeared after restructuring the reality introduced in 2011's The New 52, being recruited by a restored Eradicator and Hank Henshaw who regained his status as Cyborg Superman, of which it is formed as follows:Action Comics #977, 978, 979 and 980 (April-May 2017) ;Provisional Members: * Blanque * Metallo * Hank Henshaw (Cyborg Superman I) * Eradicator II * Mongul (starting with Action Comics #978). * General Zod References in other comics A Batman Revenge Squad appeared in World's Finest Comics #175 (May 1968) with Cash Carew, Barney the Blast, and the Flamethrower dressed in similar costumes to Batman with purple in place of gray and their symbol was a skull with bat wings. When Guy Gardner fought the Eradicator after Superman's death, he calls himself a \\"One-Man Superman Revenge Squad.\\" A group of villains including Gizmo, Magenta, Girder, the Thinker, and Cyborgirl were known as the Cyborg Revenge Squad.Cyborg #3 In other media * A version of the Superman Revenge Squad appears in the Justice League episodes \\"Hereafter\\" (Parts 1 and 2). While the members are largely different as they consisted of Metallo, Kalibak, Livewire, Weather Wizard (usually a Flash villain), and Toyman, their goal remains the same. After the other members are defeated by the Justice League, Toyman blasts Superman with an enormous energy cannon, apparently killing him. Flash prevents Wonder Woman from avenging Superman when she was about to punch a hole in Toyman's head. It is later discovered that Toyman's energy cannon had actually sent Superman 30,000 years into the future. Superman wandered the post-apocalyptic future Earth, until he returned home with help from immortal villain Vandal Savage, who was repentant for causing Earth's destruction with a weapon he stole from Ray Palmer. * A version of the Superman Revenge Squad appeared in Superman 64. In this game, it consists of Lex Luthor, Darkseid, Parasite, Brainiac, Metallo, and Mala. * The name Superman Revenge Squad was adopted by Nosferatu D2 frontman Ben Parker for his solo recordings.http://audioantihero.bandcamp.com/track/were-here-for-duration- livehttp://music.thedigitalfix.com/content/8909/superman-revenge-squad- interview.html FootnotesExternal links * Supermanica entry on the pre-Crisis Superman Revenge Squad * another good entry from supermanhomepage Category:Comics characters introduced in 1962 Category:DC Comics supervillain teams ","title":"Superman Revenge Squad"},{"id":"3585088","text":"State Road 507 (SR 507) is a , four-lane highway serving Melbourne and Palm Bay, Florida.

Production Undercurrent was only director Vincente Minnelli's second dramatic film, the first being The Clock, which starred his wife at the time, Judy Garland. Minnelli's specialty was in directing the kind of glossy musicals that M-G-M's Arthur Freed unit turned out. Because he trusted producer Pandro S. Berman's judgement in regard to the film's star, Katharine Hepburn - who had already signed on to do the film - Minnelli accepted the assignment; Berman had produced alice Adams and Stage Door with Hepburn when they both worked for RKO Pictures. Berman and Minnelli would go on to make Madame Bovary (1949), Father of the Bride (1950), and other successful films together. Metro-Goldwyn-Mayer paid David O. Selznick $25,000 and RKO $75,000 for the use of Robert Mitchum. Mitchum was working on two other films at the same time, Desire Me (1947) and The Locket (1946), which prompted director Vincente Minnelli to wonder if that was how Mitchum maintained his sleepy-eyed look.Passafiume, Andrea (ndg) \\"Undercurrent (1946)\\" TCM.com Hepburn was opinionated about her colleagues. She wasn't impressed by Mitchum, an opinion she did not hide, and, at least at first, was not happy about Minnelli being the director of the film. Hepburn's self-assurance made Minnelli nervous, but the two grew to be good friends, a fact which annoyed Robert Taylor, who was afraid that the film would become a showcase for Hepburn. He changed his mind, though, after realizing that Minnelli's direction was helping to improve his performance. The musical motif featured in the film is an excerpt from Johannes Brahms' Symphony No. 3. Reception=Critical response Variety magazine lauded the film and wrote, \\"Undercurrent is heavy drama with femme appeal...Hepburn sells her role with usual finesse and talent. Robert Mitchum, as the missing brother, has only three scenes, but makes them count for importance.\\"Staff (1946) review Variety. Last accessed: March 29, 2008. Critic Bosley Crowther of The New York Times also liked the film and wrote, \\"However, that is Undercurrent-‚Äîand you must take it upon its own terms, which are those of theatrical dogmatism, if you hope to endure it at all. If you do, you may find it gratifying principally because Miss Hepburn gives a crisp and taut performance of a lady overcome by mounting fears and Mr. Taylor, back in films from his war service, accelerates a brooding meanness as her spouse. You may also find Robert Mitchum fairly appealing in a crumpled, modest way as the culturally oriented brother, even though he appears in only a couple of scenes. And you may like Edmund Gwenn and Jayne Meadows, among others, in minor roles.\\"Crowther, Bosley (November 29, 1946) review The New York Times. Last accessed: March 29, 2008. More recently, critic Dennis Schwartz wrote, \\"Director Vincente Minnelli...known mostly through his upbeat MGM musicals, changes direction with this tearjerker femme appealing romantic melodrama, that can also be viewed as a heavy going psychological film noir (at least, stylishly noir through the brilliantly dark photography of Karl Freund)...Though overlong and filled with too many misleading clues about which brother is the baddie, the acting is superb, even though both Katharine Hepburn and Robert Mitchum are cast against type (a weak woman and a sensitive man). It successfully takes on the theme from Gaslight.\\"Schwartz, Dennis (May 13, 2006) review Ozus' World Movie Reviews. Last accessed: March 29, 2008.

He was the fifth of the eight princes commonly associated with the War of the Eight Princes. Of the eight princes, he alone received praises from historians, for his attempt to reform government and his courtesy to his developmentally disabled brother, Emperor Hui. According to the Book of Jin, Sima Ai was a strong and resolute man and was seven chi and five cun tall (approximately 1.84 metres). Sima Ai was Emperor Wu's sixth son, born of the same mother as Sima Wei the Prince of Chu. He was created the Prince of Changsha in 289. When his father died in 290, Sima Ai was praised by many for his display of filial piety. When Sima Wei, at the command of Emperor Hui's wife Empress Jia Nanfeng, killed the regents Sima Liang the Prince of Ru'nan and Wei Guan, Sima Ai participated, and subsequently, when Empress Jia claimed that Sima Wei had forged the edict and executed him, Sima Ai was demoted to the lesser title of Prince of Changshan. Despite this, during the next few years, he received renown for his decisiveness, talents, and humility. When Sima Lun the Prince of Zhao usurped the throne in 301, Sima Ai was at his principality, and he led his own troops to join the forces of his brother Sima Ying the Prince of Chengdu against Sima Lun. Once Sima Ying and Sima Jiong the Prince of Qi were able to defeat and overthrow Sima Lun and restore Emperor Hui, Sima Ai, for his accomplishments, was restored to his original title as the Prince of Changsha. After overthrowing Sima Lun, Sima Jiong became the regent‚Äîas Sima Ying, who was initially named coregent with him, declined and returned to his stronghold of Yecheng. He became arrogant and extremely controlling, and failed to pay even basic courtesies to Emperor Hui. He also became suspicious of Sima Yong the Prince of Hejian (the grandson of Emperor Hui's great-granduncle Sima Fu the Prince of Anping), because Sima Yong had initially wanted to support Sima Lun, until he saw that Sima Lun's cause was hopeless. Sima Yong knew of Sima Jiong's suspicion, and started a conspiracy; he invited Sima Ai to overthrow Sima Jiong, believing that Sima Ai would fail; his plan was then to, in conjunction with Sima Ying, start a war against Sima Jiong. Once they were victorious, he would depose Emperor Hui and make Sima Ying the emperor, and then serve as Sima Ying's prime minister. In winter 302, Sima Yong declared his rebellion, and Sima Ying soon joined, despite opposition from his strategist Lu Zhi (). Hearing that Sima Ai was part of the conspiracy as well, Sima Jiong made a preemptive strike against Sima Ai, but Sima Ai was prepared and entered the palace to control Emperor Hui. After a street battle, Sima Jiong's forces collapsed, and he was executed. Sima Ai became the effective regent, but in order to reduce opposition, he submitted all important matters to Sima Ying, still stationed at Yecheng. As regent, he paid attention to reforming the government, and he saw the importance of formally honoring Emperor Hui while maintaining resemblance to impartial governance. He continued to try to share power with Sima Ying. However, in fall 303, Sima Yong, dissatisfied that his plan did not come to fruition, persuaded Sima Ying to again join him against Sima Ai. While Sima Yong and Sima Ying had overwhelming force, their forces could not score a conclusive victory against Sima Ai. Sima Ai made overtures to try to achieve peace with Sima Ying, but after negotiations, those efforts failed. Sima Yong's forces were about to withdraw in spring 304 when Sima Yue the Prince of Donghai, the grandson of a great-granduncle of Emperor Hui, believing that Sima Ai could not win this war, arrested him and delivered him to Sima Yong's general Zhang Fang (), who executed Sima Ai cruelly by burning him to death. (Before he was executed, Sima Ai was able to write a touching letter of farewell to Emperor Hui.) As Sima Ai cried out in pain, even Zhang's forces were mourning for his fate.

His full name or last name standing alone is often used to refer to a cue stick made by him. Arriving in the U.S. in 1924, he worked at various carpentry and toy and furniture making jobs. He was an avid pool player and purchased a pool room with a business partner in 1959 and thereafter started making cues as gifts for friends which quickly blossomed into a business when others wanted to purchase them. Balabushka turned out approximately 1,200 handcrafted cues during his 16-year cue-making career, spanning from 1959 to his death in 1975. His cues are highly valued collectors items, made more so after being prominently featured in Martin Scorsese's 1986 film, The Color of Money. Balabushka cues are generally separated into three distinct classes and time periods related to what Balabushka was using in cue construction: The Titlist blank era (1959‚Äì1966), the Burton Spain blank era (1966‚Äì1971) and the Gus Szamboti blank era (late 1960s‚Äì1975). There are date overlaps between forearms. So you could have a 1974 Titlist, or 1973 Burton Spain. Original Balabushka cues with verified provenance may realize tens of thousands of dollars at auction. Life and career=Early life George Balabushka was born in Russia on December 9, 1912 and immigrated to the United States in 1924 at 12 years of age. His family, parents Anton and Natalie and younger sister Mary, settled in New York City. Although originally named Gregori, according to Balabushka he was given a new first name, George, by immigration officials when he was processed through Ellis Island. Employment Balabushka's first job was as a wooden toy designer and maker, working for the Educational Equipment Company, then located at 71 West 23rd St., in Manhattan, which made building blocks for nurseries and schools. Thereafter he built children's furniture for the Playtime Woodworking Company located on Greenwich Village's Jane Street. While on the job, Balabushka lost his middle finger to a band saw. Using a wooden mold, he made himself a replacement plastic finger of such craftsmanship that even his friends did not realize his loss until long after the incident. As Balabushka's carpentry skills deepened he began building accordions and other detailed carpentry pieces on his own time. In 1949, Balabushka applied for patent on a folding leg bracket mechanism he invented, which was granted in 1951., May 22, 1951. Retrieved on May 2, 2009. Marriage and children While working at Playtime Woodworking he met a woman named Josephine, his future wife, who then lived directly across the street from the toy company. They were married in 1941, and bought a home in Brooklyn several years later. Josephine and George had two sons, Gregory and George, both named after their father. Josephine was not just a source of love and stability but was the rock that allowed Balabushka the ability to hone his craft. According to the writers of The Billiard Encyclopedia, \\"Josephine's limitless patience and strong sense of independence would afford George the time and solitude necessary that a great artist needs in order to perfect his craft.\\" Transition to cuemaker Balabushka was an avid billiards player, especially of the game of straight pool, taking part in competitions and spending time with well-known practitioners of the sport. In 1959, he purchased a Brooklyn-based pool hall with partner, Frank McGown, which was located at 50th Street and 5th Avenue. While running the room, he began repairing cues as a hobby, and soon the idea was sparked to design and manufacture his own line of pool cues. By the end of 1959, Balabushka had made a number of cues, most of which were given to friends as Christmas gifts. As this practice went on, he began receiving orders for his cues. His first cues were conversions of the popular Brunswick-Balke-Collender Company manufactured \\"Titlist\\" cues, which were one-piece cues; that is, they had no in the middle that would allow a player to the cue into two sections for ease of transport. At the time he started, there were very few private cuemakers, the industry being dominated by large manufacturers. Cuemaking career and death Between 1959 and 1962, Balabushka handcrafted between 20 and 30 cues per year on a part-time basis. Because of the relative dearth of private cuemakers and the excellence of his product, Balabushka's name quickly became known amongst professional players. By the end of 1962, Balabushka was receiving more orders for cues than he could fill given his time constraints. Balabushka accordingly sold his interest in the pool room, converted his garage into a carpentry shop, and by 1964 was building cues full-time, while continuing to hone his cuemaking abilities. Unlike many of the large manufacturers of the day, Balabushka's emphasis was on playing ability and fine craftsmanship, reflecting the values he had held during his years in the woodworking business. He was an innovator in cue construction, cue finishes and cue design. Balabushka's cues were not the elaborately decorated attempts at building art that became a mainstay of the cue market starting in the 1980s and onward. Rather, most Balabushka cues are relatively plain and without grand ornamentation flourishes. Many of his trademark construction techniques have become standard in the industry, such as the use of Irish linen for wrap material and block style checkered-pattern ringwork above a cue's wrap, commonly employing alternating ebony and ivory, pieces which are eponymously named \\"Bushka rings.\\" George Balabushka died in 1975 at the age of 62. He was posthumously honored as the first inductee into the American Cuemakers Association Hall of Fame in February, 1993. In 2004, he was inducted into the Meritorious Service category of the Billiard Congress of America's Hall of Fame. A pool cue and its major parts. Cue details There are three distinct classes of cues produced during different time periods related to what Balabushka was using in cue construction: The Titlist blank era (1959‚Äì1966), the Burton Spain blank era (1966‚Äì1971) and the Gus Szamboti blank era (Late 1960s -1975). There are date overlaps between forearms. So you could have a 1972 Titlist, or 1974 Burton Spain. The \\"blanks\\" referred to are the bottom () portion of a cue where the splicing of various hardwoods has been completed but the cue has not yet been turned on a lathe to produce the final shape, and certain features have not yet been added such as a , , , and any inlays. While blank variety is the defining demarcation between one Balabushka cue and another, there are some shared features spanning Balabushka's fleeting 16-year career. Cue forearms were characteristically made with straight-grained maple, based on Balabushka's belief that a single-direction maple grain provided superior integrity to that of curly maple or birdseye maple. He used stainless steel joints and delrin butt caps almost exclusively. A small number of his cues feature ivory joints and ivory butt caps, making them highly valued collector's items. Balabushka used a distinguishing reddish-brown bumper, and employed Cortland Irish linen for many of his wraps, with the highly sought after leather wrap a rare departure for him and a distinct value enhancer. Unless a different length was specified, Balabushka made all his cues to a standard 57¬Ω inches in length. In addition to Bushka rings, various other decorative rings were commonly incorporated, including various colored plastics (often marbleized), and silver and contrasting wooden rings. For decoration, Balabushka often inlaid small mother-of-pearl dots and notched diamonds. Series of window-shaped maple pieces commonly adorned Balabushka butt sleeves, with each window usually featuring one burl for its aesthetic effect. Some other features common to many other cuemakers' lines from the same era are notably absent or mostly absent from Balabushka's, including ivory inlays and the signing of his cues. A long-standing controversy exists over what finish Balabushka used. One side argues that he used an oil finish on all his cues, while the other insists that his later cues were coated with a spray lacquer. Titlist era When Balabushka first started repairing cues while working at his pool room, he started converting into custom cues. Many of these house cues were made by Brunswick. When he started building his own cues in 1959, he used blanks purchased from Brunswick for their \\"Titlist\\" cue line; the same used in the construction of the house cues he had been converting. Many of the fine cuemakers working during the same era as Balabushka did likewise, including Frank Paradise (Paradise cues), Eugene Balner (Palmer cues, named after Arnold Palmer) and Ernie Gutierrez (Ginacue), all following in the footsteps of earlier master cuemaker, Herman Rambow. Building a full spliced blank from scratch was an expensive and painstaking process, and the large manufacturing facilities of Brunswick turned out good quality blanks, with beautiful points, veneers and sound construction. In Balabushka's case, his entire workshop consisted of a single lathe and other woodworking equipment in the confines of his modest garage, and building his own full-splice butts would have been prohibitively difficult and expensive for him. Burton Spain era Balabushka used Titlist blanks until 1966 when he was contacted by Chicagoan Burton Spain. Spain had recently begun making handmade spliced blanks and was supplying them to Balabushka's closest rival, Frank Paradise. Spain had become fascinated by splicing technology when he came upon a Titlist cue split down the middle in 1965 and set out to perfect and even improve on the Titlist splice. Spain's original intent was to be predominantly a cuemaker in his own right using his proprietary spliced blanks. However, by 1966 Spain's superior blanks were in high demand and he instead turned to making blanks for other cuemakers full-time, which he continued until 1970. Balabushka took Spain up on his offer after seeing the quality of his splices. Buying from Spain also had the advantage that he was able to have Spain customize the blanks to his specifications. During this period Balabushka began incorporating more elaborate details into his cues, including the eponymous Bushka rings innovation. Many later cuemakers would install Bushka rings both above the wrap and on the butt sleeve below the wrap. Balabushka used them only above the wrap, which is believed to have aided him in keeping the higher on the cue. In 1970, Spain sold his cue business to tool and die maker John Davis, who had been assisting Spain for a number of years. Balabushka continued buying blanks from Davis until 1971. Gus Szamboti era In the late 1960s Balabushka met Penndel, Pennsylvania, native Gus Szamboti at a tournament. Szamboti had been working for RCA as a draftsman and designer, but RCA layoffs were common at the time, and he had started designing and selling pool cues as a more stable job path. Though he too started production with Titlist blanks as well as blanks manufactured by WICO of Chicago, Szamboti later began making his own. Balabushka was very impressed with Szamboti's blanks and, in addition to the two men becoming fast friends, he became Szamboti's first customer, buying blanks from him for $18 apiece. Balabushka cues from the Gus Szamboti era are typified by straight grained maple forearms bearing four ebony points, with four veneers included, normally colored black, green, white and mahogany, or sometimes with an orange veneer in place of mahogany. Balabushka cues from this era, spanning the last five years of his life, are considered the finest of his career as a class. There have been unconfirmed rumors that some few cues made during this period included splices made by Balabushka himself. Prominence It is estimated that Balabushka produced between 1,000 and 1,200 cues during his lifetime. However, by the mid-1960s, forged Balabushka cues started circulating in the market, as he was already recognized as the premier cue maker of the era, referred to as \\"the Stradivarius of cuemakers\\". Balabushka and his cues achieved much wider recognition after being prominently featured in Martin Scorsese's 1986 film, The Color of Money (the sequel to the classic 1961 film The Hustler). In the film, Tom Cruise‚Äôs character, Vincent Lauria, is presented with a beautiful cue by Paul Newman's character, Fast Eddie Felson. Vincent takes the cue, his reverence obvious, and whispers \\"A Balabushka...\\" After this, Balabushka's name became associated by the general public with highly valued and rare cues. The cue actually used in the film was, however, not a genuine Balabushka, but a Joss Cues model J-18 (renamed the N-07), custom-made to look like a Balabushka.Commercial information about the Joss N7 model pool cue The filmmakers feared that any cue used might get damaged during filming; especially in light of a scene set in a pool room where Cruise's character rapidly whirls the cue around in time to the song Werewolves of London. An original Balabushka was thus considered too valuable to be risked in the production. Original Balabushka cues with verified provenance may realize tens of thousands of dollars at auction. In 1994, for example, a Balabushka was purchased by a collector for $45,000. In a 1998 Syracuse Herald-Journal article a collection of thirty original Balabushkas cues and six Gus Szamboti cues was estimated to be worth 2 million dollars, the cues said to be the equivalent in the cue collecting world of Rembrandts and van Goghs respectively. There are, however, many fake Balabushka cues in existence. Complicating matters, in the 1980s with the permission and license of his surviving family, a line of Balabushka replicas began to be manufactured in large quantities by the Adam Custom Cue Company.Peter Tascarella, who had been Balabushka‚Äôs old friend, took over the shop after his death in 1975. Tascarella cues is the authority of authenticating Balabuska cues.

He lives and works in New York City; Tivoli, New York; Hydra, Greece; and Eagles Mere, Pennsylvania. Life Marden's Briarcliff Manor childhood home Brice Marden, For Pearl, 1970, 96 1/2 x 98 3/4 x 2 1/8 in, Glenstone He was born as Nicholas Brice Marden Jr. in Bronxville, New York and grew up in nearby Briarcliff Manor. He attended Florida Southern College, Lakeland from 1957 to 1958, and receiving his BFA from the Boston University, School of Fine and Applied Arts in 1961. Marden earned his MFA from the Yale School of Art and Architecture (1963), where he studied with Esteban Vicente, Alex Katz, Jon Schueler, Jack Tworkov, Reginald Pollack, Philip Pearlstein, and Gabor Peterdi. Among his fellow students were the future artists Richard Serra, Chuck Close, Vija Celmins, Nancy Graves, Gary Hudson and Robert Mangold. As he studied art, Marden was also immersed in the Cambridge folk music world. His first wife, Pauline Baez, whom he married in 1960, is Joan Baez's sister. He met Bob Dylan and Pete Seeger and lived for a while at Joan Baez's house in Carmel, California.Barbara Isenberg (October 15, 2006), For Marden, seeing is creating Los Angeles Times. It was at Yale that Marden developed the formal strategies that would characterize his drawings and paintings in the proceeding decades: a preoccupation with rectangular formats, and the repeated use of a muted palette. In his early work of the 1960s and 1970s, he used simplified means, typically monochrome canvases either alone or in series of panels, diptychs or triptychs. These include the works The Dylan Painting, 1966; \\"1986\\" (now in the collection of San Francisco Museum of Modern Art); 1969's Fave (the Jack S. Blanton Museum of Art, University of Texas at Austin); and Lethykos (for Tonto), 1976 (The Museum of Modern Art, New York). Career=Early years Marden relocated to New York in 1963, where he came into contact with the work of Jasper Johns while employed as a guard at the Jewish Museum in New York during the museum's Johns's 1964 retrospective. The following summer Marden traveled to Paris where he began to make compressed charcoal and graphite grid-patterned drawings. Marden's graphic works are a corollary to his paintings, and he would transfer ideas into even his most recent paintings and drawings. Marden made his first monochromatic single-panel painting in the winter of 1964.Brice Marden Solomon R. Guggenheim Museum, New York. It was also in Paris that he admired the work of Alberto Giacometti and Jean Fautrier, although masters such as Francisco de Zurbar√°n, Diego Vel√°zquez, and √âdouard Manet have also informed Marden's artistic practice. In 1966, at Dorothea Rockburne's suggestion, Marden was hired by Robert Rauschenberg to work as his assistant. Prior to that he had worked at Chiron Press as an assistant to Steve Poleskie. That same year he had his first solo show in New York at the Bykert Gallery, which exhibited the first of his classic oil-and- beeswax paintings. Mature work In the late 1960s and early '70s, a moment when painting was widely considered moribund, Marden gained international fame as the master of the monochrome panel.Roberta Smith (October 20, 1991), Brice Marden Moves Ahead by Turning Back The New York Times. In 1971, Brice and his wife, Helen Harrington, visited the Greek island of Hydra, to which they have returned every year since. The couple bought their first home there in 1973.Ted Loos (October 29, 2006), A Subtle Sense of Place The New York Times. The light and landscape have greatly influenced Marden's work (see, for instance, the five Grove Group paintings, 1972‚Äì1980; Souvenir de Gr√®ce works on paper, 1974‚Äì1996). Executed in oil on marble fragments, he made a total of 31 paintings on marble on Hydra.Brice Marden: Paintings on Marble, May 8 - June 27, 2004 Matthew Marks Gallery, New York. Marden‚Äôs early monochromatic paintings exist as single panels, diptychs and triptychs. In each of the four Red Yellow Blue paintings (1974), the artist painted slabs of dense yet nuanced color on three adjoined canvas panels, using oil paint mixed on the spot with melted beeswax and turpentine and applied with a knife and spatula.Brice Marden: Red Yellow Blue, January 17 - February 23, 2013 Gagosian Gallery, New York. He gradually increased the number of panels, arranging them into post-and-lintel configurations. After preparing designs for stained-glass windows for Basle Cathedral in 1977, he became interested in expressing in his paintings the conditions of colour and light in architecture. Between 1981-87, Marden made a total of 31 paintings on marble, all of them produced in Hydra.Paintings on Marble, May 8 - June 27, 2004 Matthew Marks Gallery, New York. In 1977, Marden traveled to Rome and Pompeii, where he strengthened his interest in Roman and Greek art and architecture, which would influence his work of the late 1970s and early 1980s. In 1983, Marden and family traveled to Thailand, Sri Lanka, and India; the artist became fascinated by the art, landscape, and culture of parts of Asia. Marden has subsequently incorporated numerous elements of certain Asian traditions into his work, making them one key to his process (the Shell Drawings, 1985‚Äì87). A visit in 1984 to the exhibition Masters of Japanese Calligraphy, 8th-19th Century, encouraged Marden to use form, a predominant influence in his recent work‚Äîwhich can be seen in his acclaimed Cold Mountain series, both paintings and works on paper, 1989-1991. Combining airy, calligraphic scaffoldings of line with whitish or palely tinted backgrounds, these 9-by-12-foot paintings were the biggest Marden had made to that point. In 2000, Marden embarked on The Propitious Garden of Plane Image, the longest two of which measure 24 feet.Brice Marden: Prints, 1983 - 1998, November 14, 2010 - February 6, 2011 Danforth Museum of Art. Writing in The New Yorker in 2006, the critic Peter Schjeldahl described Marden as \\"the most profound abstract painter of the past four decades\\". Exhibitions Marden has participated in hundreds of group exhibitions, and has also been the subject of numerous one-person shows and retrospectives. His first solo show in New York was held at the Bykert Gallery in 1966. In 1972, his work was showcased at Documenta 5 in Kassel.Brice Marden Guggenheim Collection. His first museum show was the 1975 retrospective at the Solomon R. Guggenheim Museum, in New York. In 1991, Marden was a participant in the Connections series of the Museum of Fine Arts, Boston, for which the artist juxtaposed about three dozen of his abstract canvases and works on paper and marble with works from the permanent collection by the likes of √âdouard Manet, Paul Gauguin, Goya, James Ensor, and Francisco de Zurbar√°n.Michael Kimmelman (April 14, 1991), Brice Marden Reveals His Connections The New York Times. Other solo exhibitions include ‚ÄúBrice Marden: Cold Mountain‚Äù Dia Center for the Arts, New York (1991, traveled to Walker Art Center, Minneapolis; the Menil Collection, Houston; Museo Nacional Centro de Arte Reina Sofia, Madrid; and St√§dtisches Kunstmuseum, Bonn, Germany) and ‚ÄúWork Books 1964‚Äì1995,‚Äù Staatliche Graphische Sammlung, Munich (1997, traveled to Kunstmuseum Winterthur, Switzerland; Wexner Center for the Arts, Columbus, Ohio; Fogg Art Museum, Harvard University, Cambridge, Massachusetts; Hirshhorn Museum and Sculpture Garden, Washington, D.C.; Miami Art Museum; and the Carnegie Museum of Art, Pittsburgh). In the fall of 2006, New York's Museum of Modern Art, New York, presented \\"Brice Marden: A Retrospective of Paintings and Drawings\\". The MoMA called the exhibition \\"an unprecedented gathering of [Marden's] work, with more than fifty paintings and an equal number of drawings, organized chronologically, drawn from all phases of the artist's career.\\"Brice Marden: A Retrospective The show traveled to the San Francisco Museum of Modern Art in early 2007, and finally to Berlin's Hamburger Bahnhof, Museum f√ºr Gegenwart in the summer of that year. Originally, Marden was not enthusiastic about the idea. The works were divided into two periods: from the mid-sixties to the mid-eighties and then the mid-eighties up to the present. It allowed the artist to reassess his previous works and focus on future works. Honors In 1988, Marden became a member of the American Academy of Arts and Letters. In 2000, Brown University awarded the artist an honorary degree of Doctor of Fine Arts. Art market Marden has been represented by the Gagosian Gallery since 2017. He had previously worked with Matthew Marks Gallery for more than twenty years.Robin Pogrebin (January 12, 2017), Brice Marden Joining Gagosian Gallery The New York Times.

Personal In 1960, Brice Marden married Pauline Baez (sister of Joan) and together they had a son, Nicholas. The marriage to Pauline ended a few years later and by 1968 he was remarried to artist Helen Marden. Together with Helen Marden, they have two daughters, Mirabelle and Melia. Brice Marden's son, Nick Marden, is a punk musician who participated in the New York punk scene of the 1970s and '80s. The Mardens' daughter, Mirabelle Marden, was a proprietor of Rivington Arms, an art gallery in New York. She is also a photographer.Sokol, Brett (2006-12-17), \\"The Marden Family\\".

Today, the artist keeps a Manhattan studio in a 10th-floor penthouse duplex on West Street with around 5,000 square feet of space and one two-story window looking onto the Hudson River. The Mardens bought an estate in Tivoli, New York, called Rose Hill, in 2002. At its center is a stately 1843 main house on a cliff overlooking the Hudson River. The studio was carved out of an old carriage house and has been converted into a large, light-filled space with western and northern exposures. At Rainbow Farms, the family's 400-acre summer residence in Eagles Mere, Pennsylvania since 1991, an old barn was converted to a third workspace with almost no natural light. On Hydra, Marden and his wife traded up houses (as they did elsewhere), moving into the current one in 1989. In 2006, the couple bought a fifth property, Golden Rock Inn, on the Caribbean island of Nevis, with plans to build yet another studio there.Paul O'Donnell (January 10, 2012), Helen and Brice Marden's Caribbean Hotel Garden Design.

The building has been recognised as historically significant by the Heritage Council of Victoria and is listed on the Victorian Heritage Register. It no longer operates as a fire station but holds the Fire Services Museum of Victoria. Construction of the station was begun in 1891 and the station opened on 3 November 1893, as the headquarters and city fire station for the newly formed Metropolitan Fire Brigade. It was designed by architecture firms Lloyd Taylor & Fitts, and Smith & Johnson, who both won the competition, and combined to produce this striking Australian Queen Anne style building. The building contained living quarters, stables, workshops, and offices. A watchtower was initially manned 24 hours a day. Firefighters lived on the premises until the 1970s. In 1972 a new station was begun next door, designed by Bates Smart McCutcheon in the Brutalist style, with the fire trucks now exiting onto Gisborne Street instead of Victoria Parade. The new building and refurbished old station was opened on 8 March 1979. Parts of the old building are still used for offices, while the Fire Services Museum of Victoria now occupies the majority of the bottom floor of the old station. The Museum contains exhibits pertaining to the old MFB Board, the Chief Fire Officer, a showcase of fully refurbished fire appliances, a display of international firefighting garments and a dedication to the MFB's sister firefighting organisation, the Country Fire Authority.

She graduated from the University of California, Irvine in 1981, and moved to New York to be an artist. While working as a real estate agent, she met Ted Ammon when she called him after he failed to keep an appointment for an apartment she was to show him. They married in 1986 and adopted a twin boy and girl from Ukraine, whom they named Greg and Alexa. They were about to finalize their divorce in October 2001 when Ted Ammon was found beaten to death in his Long Island home. As he had failed to change his will, Generosa inherited the bulk of his estate. According to an inventory filed with the New York State Surrogates Court, Ammon's estate was valued at $97 million shortly after his death. The document, compiled by his executors, J.P. Morgan Chase & Co. (JPM ), detailed Ammon's assets to the last penny. J.P. Morgan took the unusual step of challenging Generosa as co-executor of his estate. Later years and death Just four months after the murder, on January 15, 2002, she married her boyfriend, Daniel Pelosi, an unlicensed electrician whom she met when he showed up at the doorstep of her Manhattan townhouse because he was told she was hiring workers for a remodeling job. While dying of breast cancer, she was offered immunity from prosecution to testify against Pelosi before a grand jury, but refused. She cut Pelosi out of her will, but gave him a $2 million legal settlement which he used for legal expenses. Generosa died of cancer on August 22, 2003. She left her estate to her two children, Alexa and Greg; however, their inheritance was only $1 million each \\"after taxes, attorneys‚Äô fees and funds lost to Pelosi‚Äôs squandering.\\" Generosa appointed Kathryn Mayne, the children's nanny, as her children's legal guardian. She also bequeathed a life interest in the house where Ammon was murdered to Mayne to raise the twins. In 2005, however, full custody of the twins was awarded to Ted's sister, Sandra Williams. Pelosi was convicted of Ammon's murder on December 13, 2004, and was sentenced to 25 years to life in prison.

Biography  Moe Goodman, who would later adopt the name Martin, was the oldest son of 17 recorded children of Isaac Goodman (b. 1872) and Anna Gleichenhaus (b. 1875). His parents were Jewish immigrants who had met in the United States after separately moving from their native Vilna, Lithuania, then part of Russian Empire. The family lived at different homes in the New York City borough of Brooklyn.Bell, Vassallo, p. 290. As a young man, Moe traveled around the country during the Great Depression, living in hobo camps.Daniels, Marvel. p. 18Bell, Vassallo, p. 12  Pulp magazines and Timely Comics  Circa (approximately) late 1929, future Archie Comics co-founder Louis Silberkleit, then circulation manager at the magazine distribution company Eastern Distributing Corp., hired Goodman for his department, assigning him clients that included publisher Hugo Gernsback. Goodman later became circulation manager himself, but the company went bankrupt in October 1932.Bell, Vassallo, p. 15. Goodman then joined Silberkleit and other investors as part owner of Mutual Magazine Distributors, and was named editor of Silberkleit's new sister company, the publisher Newsstand Publications Inc., at 53 Park Place, also known as 60 Murray Street, in Manhattan.Bell, Vassallo, p. 16. Ro, in his 2004 book, p. 7, states Goodman Uncanny Tales (May 1940), bearing Goodman's Red Circle logo Goodman's first publication was the Newsstand Publications pulp magazine Western Supernovel Magazine, premiering with cover-date May 1933.Bell, Vassallo, p. 17. After the first issue he renamed it Complete Western Book Magazine, beginning with cover-date July 1933. Goodman's pulp magazines included All Star Adventure Fiction, Complete Western Book, Mystery Tales, Real Sports, Star Detective, the science fiction magazine Marvel Science Stories and the jungle-adventure title Ka-Zar, starring its Tarzan-like namesake. These were published under a variety of names, all owned by Goodman and sometimes marked as \\"Red Circle\\". In 1937, returning from his honeymoon in Europe, Goodman and his wife had tickets on the Hindenburg, but were unable to secure seats together, so they took a plane instead, avoiding the Hindenburg disaster. In 1939, with the emerging medium of comic books proving hugely popular, and the first superheroes setting the trend, Goodman contracted with newly formed comic-book \\"packager\\" Funnies, Inc. to supply material for a test comic book, Marvel Comics #1, cover-dated October 1939 and published by his newly formed Timely Publications.Postal indicia in issue, per Marvel Comics #1 [1st printing] (October 1939) at the Grand Comics Database: \\"Vol.1, No.1, MARVEL COMICS, Oct., 1939 Published monthly by Timely Publications, ... Art and editorial by Funnies Incorporated ...\\" It featured the first appearances of the hit characters the Human Torch and the Sub-Mariner,Writer-artist Bill Everett's Sub-Mariner had actually been created for an undistributed movie-theater giveaway comic, Motion Picture Funnies Weekly earlier that year, with the previously unseen, eight-page original story expanded by four pages for Marvel Comics #1. and quickly sold out 80,000 copies. Goodman produced a second printing, cover-dated November 1939, that then sold an approximate 800,000 copies.Both figures per researcher Keif Fromm, Alter Ego #49, p. 4 (caption) With a hit on his hands, Goodman began assembling an in-house staff, hiring Funnies, Inc. writer-artist Joe Simon as editor, and Timely's first official employee. Goodman then formed Timely Comics, Inc., beginning with comics cover-dated April 1941 or Spring 1941.\\"Marvel : Timely Publications (Indicia Publisher)\\" at the Grand Comics Database. \\"This is the original business name under which Martin Goodman began publishing comics in 1939. It was used on all issues up to and including those cover-dated March 1941 or Winter 1940‚Äì1941, spanning the period from Marvel Comics #1 to Captain America Comics #1. It was replaced by Timely Comics, Inc. starting with all issues cover-dated April 1941 or Spring 1941.\\" Timely Comics became the umbrella name for the several paper corporations that comprised Goodman's comic-book division, which in ensuing decades would evolve into Marvel Comics.\\"Timely Publications became the name under which Goodman first published a comic book line.

Art by Frank R. Paul. In 1941, Timely published its third major character, the patriotic superhero Captain America by Simon and artist Jack Kirby. The success of Captain America #1 (March 1941) led to an expansion of staff, with Simon bringing freelancer Kirby on staff and subsequently hiring inker Syd Shores \\"to be Timely's third employee.\\"Ro, p. ??? Simon and Kirby departed Timely after 10 issues of Captain America, and Goodman appointed his wife‚Äôs cousin, Stan Lee, already there as an editorial assistant, as Timely's editor, a position Lee would hold for decades. With the post-war lessening of interest in superheroes, Goodman established a pattern of directing Lee to follow a variety of genres as the market seemed to trend, such as romance in 1948, horror in 1951, Westerns in 1955 and Kaiju monsters in 1958. He could be highly derivative In this regard, such as ordering the title character of Patsy Walker, America's #1 Teenager to have similar crosshatching in her hair as that of Archie Comics' popular Archie Andrews. The name \\"Timely Comics\\" went into disuse after Goodman began using the globe logo of the newsstand-distribution company he owned, Atlas, starting with the covers of comic books dated November 1951. This united a line put out by the same publisher, staff and freelancers through 59 shell companies, from Animirth Comics to Zenith Publications.Marvel Indicia Publishers at the Grand Comics Database Throughout the 1950s, the company formerly known as Timely was called Atlas Comics. Red Circle The Red Circle Magazine logo. Goodman, whose business strategy involved using several corporate names for various publishing ventures, sometimes attempted branding his line with the logo \\"Red Circle,\\" which comics historian Les Daniels calls \\"a halfhearted attempt to establish an identity for what was usually described loosely as 'the Goodman group' ... a red disk surrounded by a black ring that bore the phrase 'A Red Circle Magazine.' But it appeared only intermittently, when someone remembered to put it on [a pulp magazine's] cover.Daniels, Marvel: Five Fabulous Decades of the World's Greatest Comics, p. 21 Historian Jess Nevins, conversely, writes that, \\"Timely Publications [was how] Goodman's group [of companies] had become known; before this, it was known as 'Red Circle' because of the logo that Goodman had put on his pulp magazines. ... \\" The Grand Comics Database identifies 21 Goodman comic books from 1944 to 1959 with Red Circle, Inc. branding,Marvel : Red Circle Magazines, Inc. (Indicia / Colophon Publisher) at the Grand Comics Database. and one 1948 comic under Red Circle Magazines Corp.Marvel : Red Circle Magazines Corp. (Indicia / Colophon Publisher) t the Grand Comics Database.  Magazine Management and Lion Books  As the market for pulp magazines waned, Goodman, in addition to comic books, transitioned to conventional magazines‚Äîpublished through a concern dubbed Magazine Management Company at least as far back as 1947Bell, Vassallo, p. 39‚Äîand in 1949 founded Lion Books, a paperback line. Goodman used the name Red Circle Books for the first seven titles plus an additional two later. Most were novels, but there was a smattering of mostly sports-oriented nonfiction. Goodman eventually developed two lines, the 25¬¢ Lion and the 35¬¢ Lion Library. New American Library bought Lion in 1957, and several Lion titles were reprinted under its Signet label. Authors that Lion published included such notables as Robert Bloch, David Goodis and Jim Thompson. The first Lion editor was Arnold Hano.Hano in  Marvel Comics  In mid-1961, following rival DC Comics' successful revival of superheroes a few years earlier, Goodman assigned his comics editor, Stan Lee, to follow the trend again. He said, \\"Stan, we gotta put out a bunch of heroes. You know, there's a market for it.\\" Lee's wife suggested that Lee experiment with stories he preferred, since he was planning on changing careers and had nothing to lose. In response, Lee and artist Jack Kirby created The Fantastic Four #1 (cover-dated Nov. 1961), giving their superheroes a flawed humanity in which they bickered, worried about money and behaved more like everyday people than noble archetypes. That series became the first major success of what would become Marvel Comics. The newly naturalistic comics changed the industry. Lee, Kirby, such artists as Steve Ditko, Don Heck, Dick Ayers, John Romita Sr., Gene Colan, and John Buscema, and eventually writers including Roy Thomas and Archie Goodwin, ushered in a string of hit characters, including Spider-Man, Iron Man, the Hulk, Daredevil, and the X-Men. In fall 1968, Goodman sold Magazine Management to the Perfect Film & Chemical Corporation. Goodman remained as publisherDaniels, Marvel. p. 139 until 1972, which included supporting Lee's decision to disregard the Comics Code Authority's disallowance of an The Amazing Spider-Man anti-drug themed story-arc requested by the US Department of Health, Education and Welfare, which discredited the censor.Cronin, pp. 110‚Äì111. Two years later he founded a new comics company, Seaboard Periodicals, which published under a new Atlas Comics imprint and is known to collectors as \\"Atlas/Seaboard Comics\\".Jeff Rovin interview in It shut down the following year. Perfect Film & Chemical renamed itself Cadence Industries in 1973, the first of many post-Goodman changes, mergers, and acquisitions that led to what became the 21st-century corporation Marvel Entertainment Group.  Men's magazines  Goodman's Magazine Management Company also published such men's adventure magazines as Bachelor, For Men Only, Male, Stag and Swank, edited during the 1950s by Noah Sarlat. As well, there was such ephemera as a one-shot black-and-white \\"nudie cutie\\" comic, The Adventures of Pussycat (Oct. 1968), that reprinted some stories of the sexy, tongue-in-cheek secret-agent strip that ran in some of his men's magazines. Marvel/Atlas writers Stan Lee, Larry Lieber and Ernie Hart and artists Wally Wood, Al Hartley, Jim Mooney and Bill Everett and \\"good girl art\\" cartoonist Bill Ward contributed. By the late 1960s, these titles had begun evolving into erotic magazines, with pictorials about dancers and swimsuit models replaced by bikinis and discreet nude shots, with gradually fewer fiction stories. Another division, Humorama, published digest-sized magazines of girlie cartoons by Ward, Bill Wenzel and Archie Comics great Dan De Carlo, as well as black-and- white photos of pin-up models including Bettie Page, Eve Meyer, stripper Lili St. Cyr and actresses Joi Lansing, Tina Louise, Irish McCalla, Julie Newmar and others. Abe Goodman, a relative, headed this division. Titles included Breezy, Gaze, Gee-Whiz, Joker, Stare, and Snappy. They were published from at least the mid-1950s to mid-1960s. In addition to men's adventure magazines and Humorama, Goodman also published many other magazines covering a plethora of topics including several male-oriented glossy 5\\" √ó 7\\" digests in the early to mid-1950s (e.g. Focus, Photo, and Eye) prior to the development of Humorama, as well as many romance, film and television, sports and other general interest magazines spanning several decades. Personal life Goodman was married to Jean Davis, with whom he had children Iden, Charles, and Amy. He died June 6, 1992, at his home in Palm Beach, Florida, aged 84. Note: Obituary erroneously states Goodman \\"invented such popular characters as Captain America and Spiderman \\", that his company's first hero was Captain America, and that he retired in 1968. Son Charles, known as \\"Chip\\", founded his own publishing company that produced 80 magazines in home, fitness, pornography and other niches, before dying of pneumonia in 1996, aged 55.

It was formed in 1939 and has seen active service in World War II, East Timor, the War on Terrorism and the 2003 Gulf War. The squadron became known to the public through its participation in the Great Southern Ocean rescues of wrecked sailors, such as Tony Bullimore and Isabelle Autissier. History=Second World War No. 11 Squadron was established on 25 September 1939 at RAAF Base Richmond,Roylance, Air Base Richmond, p.125 equipped with two Supermarine Seagulls and two Short Empire flying boats.Barnes, The RAAF and the Flying Squadrons, p. 69 The squadron's first commanding officer was Flight Lieutenant James Alexander. In late September, the squadron deployed to Port Moresby in New Guinea where it monitored Japanese shipping movements in the region. In mid-1940, the squadron received another two Empires as it sought to expand its operations to places such as Thursday Island and Bougainville. The squadron was re-equipped with six Catalina aircraft in 1941, before transferring some of its aircraft to No. 20 Squadron RAAF. In late November, the squadron helped search for survivors from HMAS Sydney following its battle with the German auxiliary cruiser Kormoran, but was unsuccessful. Upon the outbreak of war with Japan in December 1941, No. 11 Squadron began flying long range patrol missions across the South West Pacific area; these would continue throughout the war and would sometimes be up to 20 hours in duration. It suffered its first loss on 8 December when one of its aircraft crashed on take-off in Port Moresby; all six crew members were killed. On 12 January, the squadron launched an attack on the Japanese airbase at Truk, but it was cancelled due to bad weather. Further raids were undertaken throughout the next couple of months around Rabaul and patrols were undertaken along the north coast of New Guinea during which the squadron lost one aircraft shot down and several others were damaged in attacks or in accidents.Barnes, The RAAF and the Flying Squadrons, pp. 69‚Äì70 The squadron also flew evacuation missions, repatriating military personnel and civilians back to Australia as the Japanese attacks intensified. In May, following the Japanese air attacks on Port Moresby, the squadron was withdrawn to Australia, arriving in Bowen, Queensland, from where it flew reconnaissance sorties in support of Allied naval operations during the Battle of the Coral Sea. Throughout the remainder of the year, the squadron undertook anti- submarine and anti-shipping patrols, and several bombing missions in New Guinea during which one Catalina was lost.Barnes, The RAAF and the Flying Squadrons, p. 70 A No. 11 Squadron Catalina being beached for maintenance in 1943 The squadron moved to Cairns, Queensland in November 1942, and began to interdict Japanese supply convoys moving between Lae and Finschhafen. In early March 1943, aircraft from No. 11 Squadron took part in the surveillance of the Japanese convoy which was destroyed in the Battle of the Bismarck Sea. In April 1943, No. 11 Squadron began conducting offensive mine-laying operations, which it continued until the end of the war. The squadron's most notable achievement in this role was the mining of Manila harbour in December 1944,Barnes, The RAAF and the Flying Squadrons, pp. 70‚Äì71 which required three aircraft to fly over in the RAAF's longest mission of the war. An incident in which a US Navy Wildcat mistook a No. 11 Squadron Catalina for a Japanese aircraft resulted in the adoption of what became the modern RAAF Roundel. At the time, RAAF aircraft were using the RAF roundel and the USN aircraft mistook this for the Japanese red circular aircraft marking. The aftermath led to the removal of the red colour from the centre of the roundel, which remained as the standard RAAF roundel in the Pacific for the remainder of the war. Post-war, the standard RAF roundel was reinstated, while the current roundel consisting of the blue outer ring surrounding a red kangaroo in motion was adopted in June 1956. The squadron spent the final months of the war conducting mine laying operations, including Balikpapan Harbour. After Japan surrendered in August 1945, its focus shifted to humanitarian efforts, air dropping supplies to Allied personnel in prisoner-of-war camps, and repatriating newly liberated POWs back to Australia. These operations occupied the squadron until the end of 1945; it was withdrawn back to Australia after that and officially ceased to exist on 15 February 1946.Barnes, The RAAF and the Flying Squadrons, p. 71 Casualties during the war amounted to 102 personnel killed. Post-war On 1 July 1948, No. 11 Squadron was re-formed at RAAF Base Rathmines, drawing personnel and aircraft from the former Search and Rescue Wing. At this time it operated Catalinas again, undertaking search and rescue and courier tasks. In September that year, the squadron lost one aircraft in a crash on Lord Howe Island during a night navigation exercise, which resulted in the deaths of seven of the nine crewmembers.Barnes, The RAAF and the Flying Squadrons, p. 72 The squadron ceased operations on 1 May 1950 and was briefly disbanded between then and 1 November 1950, when it re-formed at RAAF Base Amberley in Queensland, operating modified Lincoln heavy bombers. Two weeks later, the squadron was transferred to RAAF Base Pearce in Western Australia, from where it conducted patrols over the Indian Ocean. It was re- equipped with Lockheed P-2 Neptune aircraft throughout 1951‚Äì53, sending crews to the United States to fly the aircraft back, and in May 1954 the squadron relocated to RAAF Base Richmond. An AP-3C of No. 11 Squadron in 2016 Neptunes from the squadron flew around the world in February 1957 as part of Operation Westbound. In 1959, the squadron's Neptunes were flown to the United States and upgraded with jet engines; one aircraft was lost in a crash near RAAF Base Richmond early that year, resulting in the deaths of the entire crew. In February 1964, the squadron returned to the search and rescue role when it helped search for survivors following the Melbourne‚ÄìVoyager collision. The following year, the squadron deployed five aircraft as escorts when HMAS Sydney was dispatched to South Vietnam carrying equipment and troops including the 1st Battalion, Royal Australian Regiment and the Prince of Wales's Light Horse as part of Australia's contribution to the Vietnam War. The last squadron's last Neptune flight took place in late 1967. In February 1968, No. 11 Squadron moved to RAAF Base Edinburgh where it re-equipped with P-3B Orion aircraft over the next six months, dispatching crews to the United States to retrieve the aircraft. From early 1981, the squadron's aircraft were dispatched regularly to RAAF Base Butterworth in Malaysia as part of No. 92 Wing. Between 1984 and 1986, the old model Orions were replaced with P-3Cs. No. 11 Squadron continues to operate in the maritime patrol and surveillance roles. In this role, the squadron has taken part in several high-profile rescues of wrecked sailors in the Great Southern Ocean, including those of Tony Bullimore and Isabelle Autissier. In 1999, the squadron supported the Australian-led intervention into East Timor as part of Operation Warden. Between 2003 and 2013, the squadron's aircraft deployed to the Middle East as part of No. 92 Wing's commitment to Operations Catalyst, Falconer and Slipper. One of the squadron's main roles during these operations was the provision of \\"over-ground surveillance\\", providing real-time reconnaissance information to Coalition ground troops in Iraq and Afghanistan, under the direction of ground controllers. A No. 11 Squadron P-8 Poseidon in 2018 In May 2015, it was announced that the squadron would begin transitioning from Orions to Boeing P-8 Poseidons. The first aircraft was delivered in November 2016 and as of June 2017 the squadron was operating three P8As. Twelve aircraft were being operated by December 2019. In April 2018, an 11 Squadron P-8A Poseidon was deployed to Japan to conduct maritime surveillance to prevent sanctions evasions by North Korea. In October 2019, an 11 Squadron P-8A Poseidon was deployed to the Middle East in support of a US-led International Maritime Security Construct, which includes forces from the US, Saudi Arabia, Bahrain and the UK. In January 2020, during the devastating and unprecedented Australia wide bush fires, an 11 Squadron P-8A Poseidon was utilised under the Emergency Defence Assistance to the Civil Community role as a surveillance asset for Operation Bushfire Assist.

It is ranked in the top five policy analysis schools in the United States. It is located on the University's main campus in Hyde Park. In addition to policy studies and policy analysis, the school requires its students to pursue training in economics and statistics through preliminary examinations and course requirements. Further, Harris Public Policy takes part in curricular interactions with the University-at-large, with students cross-enrolling in courses at the Booth School of Business, Law School, School of Social Service Administration, and the Graduate Division of the Social Sciences. The school's namesake is businessman Irving B. Harris, who made a donation that established the Harris School in 1986. In 2014, Harris Public Policy received two gifts totaling $32.5 million for a physical expansion. A former residence hall designed by architect Edward Durell Stone was renovated and renamed The Keller Center, housing the Harris School of Public Policy as of 2019. The Keller Center's Forum provides a venue for speakers and open work space. History The Harris School of Public Policy was predated by the Committee on Public Policy and The University of Chicago Center for Policy Study. The Center on Public Policy, established in 1966, was a research center and so did not offer degrees. The Center hosted fellows and conferences and published research in the field of public policy, primarily urban studies and urban journalism. The Committee on Public Policy was formed to offer master's degrees to students interested in policy studies. The Committee, formed of professors employed by different academic divisions, began offering classes in 1976 to a small group of one-year Master's students who had applied internally from other graduate divisions within the University of Chicago. The Committee's long term viability was called into question for reasons including the small demand for one year master's degrees in public policy and weak administrative support for such a small program. Over the next three years the Committee began offering two year degrees, joint BA/MA degrees and PhDs, but it continued to be threatened by weak administrative support and unstable funding. In 1986 a committee of Deans recommended the Committee should secure a better endowment and become a professional school or be dissolved. At that time Irving Harris pledged $6.9 million in order to create the public policy school, a figure he later raised to $10 million. In 1988 the Harris School of Public Policy opened in the former American Bar Association Building which it has shared with affiliates including NORC at the University of Chicago and the Bulletin of the Atomic Scientists. Curriculum The Harris Public Policy offers the following full-time professional master's degree programs: * Master of Public Policy (MPP), a two-year program * Master of Science (MS) in Computational Analysis and Public Policy, a two-year program offered with the Department of Computer Science * Master of Science (MS) in Environmental Science and Policy, a two-year program offered with Argonne National Laboratory * Master of Arts (MA) in Public Policy, a 9-month program * Master of Arts (MA) in Public Policy with Certificate in Data Analytics, a 12-month program * Master of Arts (MA) in Public Policy with Certificate in Research Methods, a 15-month program Further, the school offers a Ph.D. program in public policy.

He served as head football coach of University of Pittsburgh from 1989 to 1992 and at the University of Southern California (USC) from 1998 to 2000. Hackett was quarterbacks coach or offensive coordinator for the San Francisco 49ers, Dallas Cowboys, Kansas City Chiefs, Cleveland Browns, New York Jets, Tampa Bay Buccaneers, and Oakland Raiders. Hackett began his college coaching career at his alma mater, the University of California, Davis, in 1969, assisting the freshmen in the first year and then directing them to a 13‚Äì0 mark over the next two seasons under College Football Hall of Fame coach Jim Sochor. He then was an assistant at University of California, Berkeley for four years (1972‚Äì1975), the first season as a graduate assistant, the next as the receivers coach and the final two as the quarterbacks coach. Then, at age 29, he moved to USC for five years (1976‚Äì1980) as an assistant coach under John Robinson. Hackett then began in the NFL as offensive coordinator for the Cleveland Browns (1981‚Äì82), followed by a stint as quarterbacks/receivers coach for the San Francisco 49ers (1983‚Äì85)‚Äîduring which he coached Joe Montana in the 1984 Super Bowl victory‚Äîand as offensive coordinator for the Dallas Cowboys (1986‚Äì1988). From 1989 to 1992 Hackett was the head football coach at the University of Pittsburgh. He replaced Mike Gottfried, whom he had served as offensive coordinator, just prior to the 1989 John Hancock Bowl, which resulted in a Pittsburgh victory over Texas A&M.; Hackett then moved back to the NFL as offensive coordinator for the Kansas City Chiefs from 1993 to 1997. He was instrumental in acquiring his quarterback from the 49ers, Joe Montana, to play for the Chiefs from 1993‚Äì1994. The Chiefs made the playoffs four of five seasons, ranking fifth in offense in his last year. Hackett moved back to college football as head coach at USC from 1998 until 2000, prior to Pete Carroll taking over. During the first season he guided the Trojans to the Sun Bowl, losing in a major upset to TCU. Hackett's final two years at the school were difficult, as the fans and alumni base turned against him.T. J.

After leaving USC, Hackett again returned to the NFL, serving as the offensive coordinator for the New York Jets from 2001 to 2004. He was then the Tampa Bay quarterbacks coach from 2005 to 2007. From 2008 to 2010, Hackett worked as the quarterback coach for the Oakland Raiders, after which he retired from coaching. Hackett is married and has two sons, David and Nathaniel.

Early days Witchfynde were formed in Derbyshire, England, in 1974, by bass guitarist Richard Blower and vocalist Neil Harvey. Richard Blower discovered Montalo (Trevor Taylor) in a band called Atiofel. When Richard left the band in 1975, they reformed Witchfynde with lead guitarist Montalo, bassist Andro Coulton and drummer Gra Scoresby, and soon recruiting vocalist Steve Bridges. The band released their first single, \\"Give 'Em Hell\\" in 1979 and released its first full-length album, also entitled Give 'Em Hell, on Rondelet Records in 1980. A major attribute to success may have originated by the frequent airplay on the Friday Rock Show, hosted by Tommy Vance on BBC Radio 1. The band gained some exposure by touring the United Kingdom with Def Leppard in the summer of 1980. The band's sound incorporated a mix of influences, such as progressive and hard rock, with various aspects of the heavy metal sound as well as prominent use of satanic imagery. Second album and change of musical direction In 1980, the band released their second album Stagefright. Like their debut, it was recorded at Fairview Studios in Willerby, East Riding of Yorkshire, and is considered their most experimental work to date. During the period the album was released, bassist Andro Coulton was replaced by Pete Surgey. Departure from Rondelet Records Around the time of the band's second release, the relationship with their label Rondelet Records became increasingly strained, to the point where the label withdrew the band's funding. This made things very difficult for Witchfynde and eventually led to the departure of vocalist Steve Bridges. The band then recruited new singer Luther Beltz and began working on third album Cloak and Dagger; it was released on the small label Expulsion Records, but owing to bad production and the fact the label went bankrupt shortly after the album's release, it did not receive good promotion. Mausoleum Records, fourth album and split The band signed a deal in 1984 with Mausoleum Records to release their fourth album Lords of Sin. During the recording of the album, bassist Pete Surgey left the band and was replaced by Edd Wolfe, who had played in one of Luther Beltz's former bands; however, by the time the album was released he was replaced by Al Short, who played in the band Race Against Time. Although the band considered the album their strongest to date, it received very bad reviews from critics, with the final blow delivered when Mausoleum Records went bankrupt; as the result of the album's bad promotion, the band became totally disillusioned with the music business and split up. Reunion, 1999‚Äìpresent In October 1999, Montalo, Gra and Luther began to discuss the possibility of a reunion, owing to a resurgence of interest in the band after the release of the Best of Witchfynde CD in 1996, which sold well. Pete Surgey rejoined the band on bass. However, during rehearsals Luther Beltz announced that he no longer wanted to participate in the reunion; the band replaced him with vocalist Harry Harrison, a longtime fan of the band that was introduced by Pete Surgey. The band then began to work on their fifth album The Witching Hour, which they released on Edgy Records in 2001. Their first three albums were re-released by Cherry Red and Lemon Recordings. A new Best Of album was released in 2007 by Lemon Recordings. The band then began work on their sixth studio album called Play It to Death, which they recorded at Bandwagon Studios and released in July 2008. Towards the end of 2008, owing to Harry Harrison's ill-health and other commitments, Luther Beltz returned to front the band for the Play It to Death UK Tour. July 2014 saw the addition of second guitarist Tracey Abbott from Overdrive, which created a more solid and powerful sound. Witchfynde played the Metalcova Festival in Barcelona on 28 November 2015.

In the , Eight Mile Plains had a population of 15,322 people. Geography Eight Mile Plains is south-southeast of the Brisbane central business district. Bulimba Creek forms the northern and western boundary of the suburb. The Gateway Motorway forms the north-eastern boundary and the Pacific Motorway forms the south-eastern boundary. Dominant natural features of the area include Bulimba Creek. Before white settlement the area was home to a diverse range of plants and animals. There are also areas of remnant bushland in the suburb and a small number of market gardens. The Brisbane Technology Park is an initiative of the Queensland Government developed to provide a catalytic environment for established and emerging knowledge-intensive, technology-based companies.  History  The name of the Aboriginal clan formerly occupying this area is uncertain. According to one source they are likely to have been the Chepara clan of Eight Mile Plains who spoke Turrbal. The Yerongpan of Oxley Creek who are said to have claimed the area from Brisbane to Ipswich. Another source claims they were the Yagarabal, who ranged from Brisbane to the Logan River and west to Moggill Creek. The Aborigines used a trail which later became Logan Road. This trail bisected many creeks including the Mimosa Creek and Bulimba Creek watercourse. The name Eight Mile Plains was given early in its settlement, and refers to the area's flat topography and the distance () to One Mile Swamp (now Woolloongabba). In 1861, over in the nearby Coopers Plains area had been proclaimed the Brisbane Agricultural Reserve. In 1864 this was extended by a further and the Eight Mile Plains Agricultural Reserve was formed. It comprised the current suburbs of Sunnybank, Sunnybank Hills, Runcorn, Kuraby, Eight Mile Plains and parts of Coopers Plains, Algester and Stretton. Eight Mile Plains Hotel, circa 1905 (now The Glen Hotel) Charles Baker bought land in the area in 1863. He obtained a publican's licence for Baker's Hotel on 12 December 1865. Joseph Baker takes over the licence in 1869 and changes the name to Eight Mile Plains Hotel. In 1875 the hotel became a Cobb & Co staging post. In 1927, two Scottish sisters Mary-Jane McCamey and Emma O‚ÄôSullivan took over the hotel and changed its name to ‚ÄúThe Glen‚Äù, because the undulating countryside reminded them of the area in Scotland where they were born. The O'Sullivan family introduced wood chopping competitions at the hotel, including a cross saw event with one end being taken by a woman (known today as a Jack and Jill competition). These events attracted huge crowds and led to the formation of the Queensland Axeman's Association which continues to operate wood chopping competitions throughout Queensland and send teams to national and international events. As at 2019, The Glen Hotel contains to trade making it one of the longest continuously trading hotels in Queensland. The Eight Mile Plains Provisional School opened on 7 June 1869 in Charles Baker's paddock on Logan Road between Levington Road and the Glen Hotel. The school building was erected by Baker at his own expense. There were approximately 15 students at that time. However, the school was poorly located on the outskirts of the area and the building was in poor condition and by 1875 there was local agitation for a new building to house the 80 students in a more central location. In June 1880 tenders were called to erect a new school building made of hardwood. In 1896 it became Eight Mile Plains State School. In September 1883, 231 allotments of \\"Logan Railway Estate\\" were advertised to be auctioned by John Cameron. A map advertising the auction illustrates the proximity of the estate to the Logan Railway Line. Between 1902 and 1904 the Anglican, Catholic, Lutheran and Methodist communities in the area decided to construct a church on Millers Road that would be shared between them with each denomination holding their services in the church according to a roster until such time as each denomination established its own church. This arrangement continued until it was only the Anglican faith still using the building, when it then became St Paul‚Äôs Anglican Church. Electricity was extended to the district in 1936. St Johns Lutheran Church, 2013 St Johns Lutheran Church was officially dedicated on Sunday 9 December 1951 by Pastor M. Lohe, president of the Lutheran Church in Queensland. The brick church was built entirely by the volunteer labour of 30 men of the congregation with the work starting in October 1949 and mostly done on Saturdays. Pastor Lohe laid the foundation stone on 2 April 1950. The church had seating for 150 people with a further 50 people in the separate choir loft. The church was designed by farmer Reg Waldman who also supervised the construction; he was also the church's organist. The building was not complete at the time of its dedication as the tower has only reached but the plans were for it to reach including a belfry. The building was completed in 1976 with the erection of the spire. In 1958 a new school was constructed to service the area. Warrigal Road State School opened on 30 January 1979. The word Warrigal means \\"Dingo\\" in the local Aboriginal language. Originally Eight Mile Plains extended beyond the Brisbane City boundary along the Pacific Highway (Logan Road) into the northern part of Albert Shire (now Logan City). In the 1970s, this southern part of Eight Mile Plains, along with the southern part of Rochedale and Springwood became the new suburb of Underwood. Part of Eight Mile Plains within the Brisbane boundary was renamed Rochedale. Eight Mile Plains Special School opened on 25 August 1980; it closed on 31 December 1997. Brisbane Technology Park opened in 1986.History . Brisbane Technology Park. Retrieved 30 July 2014. The park is located on a site that is only 12 minutes from the Brisbane CBD.About BTP> . Brisbane Technology Park. Retrieved 30 July 2014. The Queensland Clunies Ross Centre for Science and Industry opened at the Technology Park in 1997. In October 2014 a petition was made by 380 residents to excise the north-eastern part of Eight Miles Plains bounded by the Pacific Motorway and Bulimba Creek to create a new suburb to be called Wishart Outlook, the name given to the area by its developers in the 1990s. However, other residents are opposed to the change.  Heritage listings  Eight Mile Plains has a number of heritage-listed sites, including: * 24 Levington Road: St Johns Lutheran Church *2497 Logan Road: Hughesville *17 Millers Road: United Protestant Church Hughesville Hughesville, 1908 Hughesville is the heritage-listed residence located on the corner of Logan and Padstow Road. The timber single- storied home was erected in 1892‚Äì93 by Alfred (Fred) Hughes (a local horse dealer) on land owned by Richard Hughes and reputedly given to this son, Richard, as a wedding gift when he married Elizabeth Magee in 1891. Hughesville survives as illustration of a past way of life, and of a particular residential type - the quintessential Queensland house of the late colonial period. It is significant for its intactness, cohesive character, aesthetic appeal and landmark position. The house has a strong community association, being for many years a principal landmark along the old Pacific Highway to the Gold Coast, demarcating the outskirts of Brisbane. In the late 1990s, it was used in one of the beer advertisements in Queensland. The land has now been subdivided and a few townhouses have been built behind the house. The house itself has been converted into a business establishment. Hughesville was listed on the Queensland Heritage Register in 1992.  Transport  Eight Mile Plains is connected to Brisbane CBD and Gold Coast and by the Pacific Motorway and to the Sunshine Coast via the Gateway Motorway. It is connected to the Translink public transport network via Eight Mile Plains busway station on the South-East Busway.  Education  Eight Mile Plains State School is a government primary (Prep-6) school for boys and girls at 480 Underwood Road (). In 2017, the school had an enrolment of 271 students with 30 teachers (25 full-time equivalent) and 21 non-teaching staff (14 full-time equivalent). It includes a special education program. Warrigal Road State School is a government primary (Prep-6) school for boys and girls at 314 Warrigal Road (). In 2017, the school had an enrolment of 1283 students with 91 teachers (80 full-time equivalent) and 55 non-teaching staff (34 full-time equivalent). It includes a special education program. There are no secondary schools in Eight Mile Plains. The nearest secondary schools are in the neighbouring suburbs of Runcorn, Sunnybank and MacGregor. Demographics According to the , Eight Mile Plains recorded a population of 15,322 people, 50.5% female and 49.5% male. The median age of the Eight Mile Plains population was 34 years of age, 4 years below the Australian median. 43.4% of people living in Eight Mile Plains were born in Australia, compared to the national average of 66.7%; the next most common countries of birth were China 12.2%, Republic of Korea 6.4%, Taiwan 4.9%, India 5.3% and New Zealand 3.1%. 42.7% of people spoke only English at home; the next most popular languages were 19.1% Mandarin, 7.3% Korean, 6.3% Cantonese, 3.1% Punjabi, 1.6% Hindi. Eight Mile Plains includes the largest Korean Australian community of any suburb in Queensland, numbering 1,150 individuals and making up 6.1% of the suburb's population. Notable residents * Charles Baker. In 1857 Charles Baker bought land from a sheep herder named Wilson. Fox hunting developed on the Baker property and he also turned his hand to construction, building a hotel. In 1868 he became the postmaster at Eight Mile Plains. His services were called upon when the Cobb and Co. services started a regular run through Eight Mile Plains to the Logan and Nerang River settlements. * Sam Langford. Brigadier Sam Langford owned a large parcel of land which was known as the 'wire paddock'. In 1932 it was the first farm to be fenced in this way. He later divided his property into 60 and lots and sold them. The sites became housing estates. *Estelle Thomson, naturalist and botanical illustrator. *Kym Tollenaere, Australian softball catcher See also * Eight Mile Plains busway station ReferencesFurther reading * * External links *Ourbrisbane.com suburb profile Archived at the Wayback Machine * University of Queensland: Queensland Places: Eight Mile Plains Category:Suburbs of Brisbane ","title":"Eight Mile Plains, Queensland"},{"id":"3585356","text":"was a Japanese literary critic and a professor of Russian literature at Waseda University.

The line is still operational today. Construction and early history Built by the Dunedin and Port Chalmers Railway Company Limited during 1872, the line was approved by and constructed under the auspices of the Otago Provincial Council, not the central government. It was built to the recently adopted national track gauge of , and it was the first line in the country with that gauge to open, on 1 January 1873. The line was formally opened by Sir George Bowen, former Governor of New Zealand, on a farewell trip prior to his transfer to Victoria.Otago Witness, 31 March 1898, \\"Chronological Index of the Settlement of Otago: 1873\\", accessed 13 October 2007. Not long after opening, the central Government purchased the Dunedin and Port Chalmers Railway Company for ¬£150,000, with the transaction completed in May 1873. Otago Provincial Council was abolished along with the other provincial councils of New Zealand in 1876. The first locomotive to run on the line ‚Äì and the first gauge locomotive to operate in New Zealand ‚Äì was the E class Josephine, a double Fairlie steam locomotive.Eric Heath and Bob Stott, Classic Steam Locomotives of New Zealand (Wellington: Grantham House, 1993), 24. Local popularity ensured the locomotive was retained beyond its retirement from service on in 1917 and is preserved today in the Otago Settlers Museum in Dunedin.Weka Pass Railway, E 175 Josephine , accessed 12 June 2007. Much of the Port Chalmers line is now part of the Main South Line from Christchurch to Dunedin. When the first section of the mainline, from Dunedin to Waitati, opened in December 1877 a junction was established at Sawyers Bay. The section from Dunedin to Sawyers Bay became part of the Main South Line, while the remaining two kilometres to Port Chalmers became the Port Chalmers Branch. In 1880 the line was vested in the newly established New Zealand Railways Department, and the private company dissolved.  Operation = Passenger services  Suburban passenger services were run from Dunedin on the line for over 100 years, but ceased at the end of 1979. These were usually locomotive-hauled carriage trains, but infrequently, RM class Vulcan railcars were used too. Occasional passenger services were operated by Dunedin Railways to meet cruise ships and carry tourists through the scenic Taieri Gorge on the preserved portion of the Otago Central Railway, but these services have been mothballed since mid-2020.  Freight services  The main reason for the lines existence is freight to and from the port, and as the shipping industry has changed, so has the traffic on the line. It has evolved from nineteenth century imports of supplies and exports of produce from rural Otago's farms and businesses into today's long- distance containerised freight. The line remains an important link in New Zealand's transport infrastructure and trains are operated by KiwiRail. The Taieri Gorge Railway recently sought a contract to haul logs from a location in the Taieri Gorge to Port Chalmers, but insufficient subsidies meant the venture would not have been cost efficient.Simon Hartley, \\"Costs Rule Out Rail in the Long Run\\", Otago Daily Times, 12 June 2007. In 2012 KiwiRail once again sought subsidies from the Otago Regional Council to move logs through the port, noting that there were annually 450,000 tonnes of logs in the area south of Dunedin available for processing. The volume of logs equated to 15,000 truck movements inwards. For up to $1.5 million, connecting the site to the Main South Line would reduce truck movements by 7,500 each year, KiwiRail submitted. It estimated 400,000 tonnes of logs (about 13,000 log truck movements) were sent to Port Otago each year and better opportunities to transfer logs to and from rail could reduce truck traffic on State Highway 88 by up to 6500 movements annually. KiwiRail also noted it had increased its Otago operations, carrying 320,000 tonnes, up from 150,000 tonnes in 2010. This was mainly due to increases in freight dispatched by Fonterra from its Edendale and Mosgiel operations.  Motive power  Motive power has often been provided by shunting locomotives rather than larger mainline engines. At the start of the twentieth century, small tank locomotives such as members of the FA class were used.Joe McNamara and Gordon Whiting, \\"Southland Locomotive Memories\\", New Zealand Railway Observer (April‚ÄìJune 1958), 59. However, in the 1960s, as diesel locomotives replaced steam locomotives on the main lines, large engines such as members of the AB class operated the suburban trains to Port Chalmers.David Leitch, Steam, Steel and Splendour (Auckland: HarperCollins, 1994), 129‚Äì30.

The National Assembly may propose laws and is required to approve all legislation. History The National Assembly was established through reforms of the Colony of Niger's Constituent Council during the French colonial period. It operated from 1958, through independence in 1960, until the 1974 Nigerien coup d'√©tat. During the course of military rule (1974‚Äì1991) a consultative body (the High Council of the Republic of Niger) was reformed to become analogous to a National Assembly. This functioned as a caretaker National Assembly during the Constitutional Convention period of the Second Republic (1991‚Äì1993) and was reconstituted as the National Assembly in the Third Republic (1993‚Äì1996). Following the 1996 Nigerien coup d'√©tat the National Assembly was again suspended, and reinstituted in 1997 under the Fourth Republic. Again, following the 1999 Nigerien coup d'√©tat, the National Assembly was suspended, but this time was reconstituted within the year under the Fifth Republic. (1999‚Äìpresent)Myriam Gervais.

Iain Frame. Routledge (2006) 2009 dissolution of assembly On 27 May 2009, the assembly was dissolved by Tandja Mamadou after his plan to hold a referendum was rejected by the Constitutional Court. Although the court and the National Assembly had only a non-binding advisory role over Tandja's referendum plan, statements by MNSD-Nassara's coalition partners CDS-Rahama indicate the MNSD Prime Minister of Niger, as well as the President, would be open to a censure motion in the assembly. According to the 1999 constitution, the President is limited to stand for reelection once: Tandja's second five-year term ends 22 December 2009. The purpose of the proposed referendum was to scrap the Constitution of the Fifth Republic, creating a new Sixth Republic prior to the November Presidential elections. Constitutionally, the articles dealing with presidential terms (article 36) may not be revised by any method (article 136). According to Tandja, the people of Niger want him to stay because he has boosted the economy of Niger. The opposition described this act as dictatorship, calling for protests: a continuation of demonstrations which began in December 2008. Powers Under the Constitution of the Fifth Republic (18 July 1999), the National Assembly has oversight of the executive in voting on legislation, overriding a Presidential veto, voting no confidence in the Prime Minister, and the reserved right of nominating the Prime Minister. As well, the Assembly has recourse to publicly investigate the executive through committee hearings, hearing in plenary sittings, commissions of enquiry, formal parliamentary questions, \\"Question Time\\", and Interpellations. There is no formal parliamentary ombudsman oversight of government.Riccardo Pelizzo, Rick Stapenhurst. Tools for Legislative Oversight: An Empirical Investigation. World Bank Policy Research Working Paper 3388, September 2004 Under a presidential system of government briefly instituted in 2009‚Äì2010, the National Assembly had no power over the selection of the Prime Minister and could not hold a vote of no confidence in the government; however, it also could not be dissolved by the President. As part of the constitutional change, the introduction of a Senate was planned, at which point the National Assembly would have become the lower house of a bicameral parliament.Page on 2009 election at IPU-PARLINE website. However, all the changes proved abortive, as President Mamadou Tandja, who had orchestrated them, was ousted in a February 2010 coup. Mahamadou Issoufou was elected in the 2011 Election and the National Assembly's powers were restored. Composition The current National Assembly, formed following elections held on 21 February 2016, has 171 members, up from 113 members in 2003, elected for a five-year term.

Hence C-A, not C-B, represents a 7:4 interval in septimal meantone. :*A ‚âà B *C ‚Äî G ‚Äî D ‚Äî A ‚Äî E ‚Äî B ‚Äî F ‚Äî C ‚Äî G ‚Äî D ‚Äî A *C ‚Äî ‚âàG ‚Äî ‚âàD ‚Äî ‚âàA ‚Äî ‚âàE ‚Äî ‚âàB ‚Äî ‚âàF ‚Äî ‚âàC ‚Äî ‚âàG ‚Äî ‚âàD ‚Äî =B The meantone tuning with pure 5:4 intervals (quarter-comma meantone) has a fifth of size 696.58 cents . Similarly, the tuning with pure 7:4 intervals has a fifth of size 696.88 cents . 31 equal temperament has a fifth of size 696.77 cents , which does excellently for both of them, having the harmonic seventh only 1.1 cent lower, and the major third 1.2 cent higher than pure (while the fifth is 5.2 cent lower than pure). However, the difference is so small that it is mainly academic.  Theoretical properties  Septimal meantone tempers out not only the syntonic comma of 81:80, but also the septimal semicomma of 126:125, and the septimal kleisma of 225:224. Because the septimal semicomma is tempered out, a chord with intervals 6:5-6:5-6:5-7:6, spanning the octave, is a part of the septimal meantone tuning system. This chord might be called the septimal semicomma diminished seventh. Similarly, because the septimal kleisma is tempered out, a chord with intervals of size 5:4-5:4-9:7 spans the octave; this might be called the septimal kleisma augmented triad, and is likewise a characteristic feature of septimal meantone.  Chords of septimal meantone  Septimal meantone of course has major and minor triads, and also diminished triads, which come in both an otonal, 5:6:7 form, as for instance C-E-F, and an inverted utonal form, as for instance C-D-F. As previously remarked, it has a septimal diminished seventh chord, which in various inversions can be C-E-G-B, C-E-G-A, C-E-F-A or C-D-F-A. It also has a septimal augmented triad, which in various inversions can be C-E-G, C-E-A or C-F-A. It has both a dominant seventh chord, C-E-G-B, and an otonal tetrad, C-E-G-A; the latter is familiar in common practice harmony under the name German sixth. It likewise has utonal tetrads, C-E-G-B, which in the arrangement B-E-G-C becomes Wagner's Tristan chord. It has also the subminor triad, C-D-G, which is otonal, and the supermajor triad, C-F-G, which is utonal. These can be extended to subminor tetrads, C-D-G-A and supermajor tetrads C-F-G-B.  11-limit meantone  Septimal meantone can be extended to the 11-limit, but not uniquely. It is possible to take the interval of 11 by means of 18 fifths up and 7 octaves down, so that an 11:4 is made up of nine tones (e.g. C-E). The 11 is pure using this method if the fifth is of size 697.30 cents, very close to the fifth of 74 equal temperament. On the other hand, 13 meantone fourths up and two octaves down (e.g. C-G) will also work, and the 11 is pure using this method for a fifth of size 696.05 cents, close to the 696 cents of 50 equal temperament. The two methods are conflated for 31 equal temperament, where E and G are enharmonic.  External links  *Composing in Meantone, Xenharmony.

Early life and education Goodman was born into an English Jewish family. Goodman noted that \\"[t]he family practised little beyond a Sabbath-eve dinner each Friday, an annual family Seder and occasional attendance at services in Bevis Marks synagogue.\\" Goodman's paternal grandfather was the secretary of the London congregation of the Iberian Jews for many years. Goodman was educated at Trinity College, Oxford, (B.A.) where he studied classical language and literature, ancient history and philosophy (Literae Humaniores). He completed his Doctor of Philosophy (DPhil) degree in 1980: his doctoral thesis was titled State and society in Roman Galilee, AD 132-212. In 2010 he was awarded the degree of DLitt. Academic career Goodman began his academic career as a research fellow, holding the Kaye Junior Research Fellowship at the Oxford Centre for Postgraduate Hebrew Studies from 1976 to 1977. He was then a lecturer in ancient history at the University of Birmingham from 1977 to 1986.'GOODMAN, Prof. Martin David', Who's Who 2017, A & C Black, an imprint of Bloomsbury Publishing plc, 2017; online edn, Oxford University Press, 2016; online edn, Nov 2016 accessed 16 Aug 2017 In 1986, Goodman was elected a Fellow of Wolfson College, Oxford. He was awarded the Title of Distinction of Professor of Jewish Studies by the University of Oxford in 1996. From 2014 to 2018, he was the President of the Oxford Centre for Hebrew and Jewish Studies. He has edited the Journal of Roman Studies and the Journal of Jewish Studies. He is past President of the British Association for Jewish Studies, past secretary of the European Association of Jewish Studies, and he is a fellow and governor of the Oxford Centre for Hebrew and Jewish Studies. Research and teaching Goodman teaches Roman history and Jewish history. He has written extensively on Jewish history in the Graeco-Roman period, including the religious and political conditions of the Jews, and their interactions with other peoples of the Roman Empire. Honours and awards In 1996, Goodman was elected Fellow of the British Academy (FBA). In 2010, he was made an honorary fellow of Trinity College, Oxford.

Weinstein, professor emeritus at Howard University describes the work as a \\"page turner\\" because of its clarity and style. Weinstein also notes that Goodman has provided a huge number of primary sources. Rose Mary Sheldon offers a more critical review. Recognising his expertise in both Roman and Jewish history, Sheldon comments that while the text is clear and logical it uses minimal footnotes and is aimed towards a general audience. Sheldon also claims that Goodman's arguments in favour of a lack of conflict between Romans and Jews between 6-60 CE \\"do not hold water\\". Sheldon does conclude that Goodman has written an accurate historical survey of Roman-Jewish relations. Publishers Weekly observes that Goodman has backed his account with archaeological evidence and ancient commentary with the result of producing a \\"scholarly tour de force\\". Its criticism is that Goodman has given more space to Romans than Jews. Jay Freeman in Booklist holds Goodman's work to be a \\"definitive account\\" for historians of both the Roman and Jewish worlds. Freeman also states that Goodman has convincingly illuminated the role of the Jewish-Roman conflict in shaping relations between Jews and Christians. David Noy of the University of Wales, Lampeter describes in The Journal of Roman Studies that the picture portrayed in the book is a \\"compelling one\\". However, Noy criticizes Goodman's over reliance on Josephus. Erich S. Gruen gives a highly positive review and recommends this book for it \\"demands attention\\" because it is a \\"sweeping survey\\" thst aims to reach an audience beyond academia. Describing Goodman as \\"too good a historian\\" he observes that Goodman has approached the subject in a \\"masterly fashion\\". Gruen's conclusion is that Goodman is committed to \\"thorough and scrupulous\\" scholarship.

It was published by New York University Press in 2002 () and reissued in paperback (). Summary The book uses the Nazi occultism covered in Goodrick-Clarke's 1985 book The Occult Roots of Nazism to trace similar phenomena in the post-war West. According to the author, movements with such interests are particularly prevalent in the English-speaking world. Because the occultism found in the SS can be traced to Ariosophy, which emerged from the v√∂lkisch movement, Goodrick-Clarke coins the term \\"neo-v√∂lkisch\\" for the groups he covers in the book. These groups are defined by \\"concerns with white identity and ethnicity\\" and in many cases take interest in \\"esoteric themes of Aryan origins, secred knowledge and occult heritage\\". Subjects surveyed include American and British neo-Nazism, the writings of Julius Evola and Francis Parker Yockey, Savitri Devi's and Miguel Serrano's Esoteric Nazism, belief in Nazi UFOs, neo-Nazi Satanism, Christian Identity, the World Church of the Creator and Nordic Racial Paganism. Reception Publishers Weekly called the book a \\"comprehensive inquiry\\" which \\"adds to our knowledge of the broad, frightening tentacles of Nazi ideology\\".

The aircraft also carried seven Afghans who had completed pro bono medical treatment at hospitals in Europe and the United States. No sooner had the C-5 reached its parking spot than a fire broke out in the aircraft‚Äôs right wheel well. Technical Sergeant William A. Wray, the flight engineer, quickly determined that the blaze had resulted from a brake fire fueled by grease and hydraulic fluid. No Pakistani firefighting support was immediately available, so Sergeant Wray rushed to the cargo compartment and grabbed a Halon fire extinguisher. He returned on the run to the wheel well and commenced spraying fire retardant on the blaze.200 The C-5, which contained 70,000 pounds of fuel, was parked next to a ground- refueling receptacle. Using three fire extinguishers, two of them handed to him by other crewmembers, Wray could extinguish the blaze for intervals of only a few seconds because the fire re-ignited as soon as the retardant dissipated. With complete disregard for his own safety, Sergeant Wray fought the fire for five minutes until the Pakistani firefighters reached the scene. An inadvertent discharge of a chemical fire retardant by the Pakistanis temporarily blinded Wray and burned his face. Sergeant Wray was treated at a local clinic but returned a short time later to prepare the C-5 for its scheduled departure at daybreak.201 According to Colonel F.

The building in the center in this photo is the site of this historic meeting. Thousands of years before Europeans arrived, a large portion of south east Florida, including the area where Miami, Florida exists today, was inhabited by Tequestas. The Tequesta (also Tekesta, Tegesta, Chequesta, Vizcaynos) Native American tribe, at the time of first European contact, occupied an area along the southeastern Atlantic coast of Florida. They had infrequent contact with Europeans and had largely migrated by the middle of the 18th century. Miami is named after the Mayaimi, a Native American tribe that lived around Lake Okeechobee until the 17th or 18th century. In 1566, Pedro Men√©ndez de Avil√©s was sent by the Spanish monarchy to remove the French from Florida who had already established several colonies. Although Men√©ndez left behind two Jesuit missionaries in an attempt to convert the Tequesta to Roman Catholicism, the tribe were indifferent to their teachings. The Jesuits returned to St. Augustine after a year. Fort Dallas was built in 1836 and functioned as a military base during the Second Seminole War. The Miami area was better known as \\"Biscayne Bay Country\\" in the early years of its growth. The few published accounts from that period describe the area as a wilderness that held much promise. The area was also characterized as \\"one of the finest building sites in Florida\\". After the Great Freeze of 1894, the crops of the Miami area were the only ones in Florida that survived. Julia Tuttle, a local landowner, convinced Henry Flagler, a railroad tycoon, to expand his Florida East Coast Railway to Miami. On July 28, 1896, Miami was officially incorporated as a city with a population of just over 300. Miami prospered during the 1920s, but weakened when the real-estate bubble burst in 1925, which was shortly followed by the 1926 Miami Hurricane and the Great Depression in the 1930s. When World War II began, Miami played an important role in the battle against German submarines due to its location on the southern coast of Florida. The war helped to increase Miami's population to almost half a million. After Fidel Castro rose to power in 1959, many Cubans emigrated to Miami, further increasing the population. In the 1980s and 1990s, various crises struck South Florida, among them the Arthur McDuffie beating and the subsequent riot, drug wars, Hurricane Andrew, and the Eli√°n Gonz√°lez affair. Despite these, Miami remains a major international, financial, and cultural center. The city's name is derived from the Miami River, which is ultimately derived from the Mayaimi people who lived in the area at the time of European colonization. Though spelled the same in English, the Florida city's name has nothing to do with the Miami people who lived in a completely different part of North America.  Early settlement  The earliest evidence of Native American settlement in the Miami region came from about 10,000 years ago.Parks, Arva Moore. Miami: The Magic City. Miami, Fl: Centennial Press, 1991. p 12. The region was filled with pine hardwood forests and was home to plenty of deer, bear, and wild fowl. These first inhabitants settled on the banks of the Miami River, with their main villages on the northern banks. These early Native Americans created a variety of weapons and tools from shells.Wilkinson, Jerry. \\"Prehistoric Indians.\\". Retrieved January 29, 2006. When the first Europeans visited in the mid-1500s, the inhabitants of the Miami area were the Tequesta people, who controlled an area covering much of southeastern Florida including what is now Miami-Dade County, Broward County, and the southern parts of Palm Beach County. The Tequesta Indians fished, hunted, and gathered the fruit and roots of plants for food, but did not practice any form of agriculture. They buried the small bones of the deceased, but put the larger bones in a box for the village people to see. The Tequesta are credited with making the Miami Circle.  16th to 18th centuries: Early Spanish settlement  In 1513, Juan Ponce de Le√≥n was the first European to visit the Miami area by sailing into Biscayne Bay. He wrote in his journal that he reached Chequescha, which was Miami's first recorded name,Parks, p 13 but it is unknown whether or not he came ashore or made contact with the natives. Pedro Men√©ndez de Avil√©s and his men made the first recorded landing in this area when they visited the Tequesta settlement in 1566 while looking for Avil√©s' missing son, who had been shipwrecked a year earlier.Parks, p 14 Spanish soldiers, led by Father Francisco Villareal, built a Jesuit mission at the mouth of the Miami River a year later, but it was short-lived. By 1570, the Jesuits decided to look for more willing subjects outside of Florida. After the Spaniards left, the Tequesta Indians were left to fight European-introduced diseases, such as smallpox, without European help. Wars with other tribes greatly weakened their population, and they were easily defeated by the Creek Indians in later battles. By 1711, the Tequesta had sent a couple of local chiefs to Havana to ask if they could migrate there. The Spanish sent two ships to help them, but their illnesses struck, killing most of their population.Parks, p 14-16 In 1743, the Spaniards sent another mission to Biscayne Bay, where they built a fort and church. The missionary priests proposed a permanent settlement, where the Spanish settlers would raise food for the soldiers and Native Americans. However, the proposal was rejected as impractical and the mission was withdrawn before the end of the year.Sturtevant, William C. (1978) The Last of the South Florida Aborigines, in Jerald Milanich and Samuel Proctor, Eds., Tacachale: Essays on the Indians of Florida and Southeastern Georgia during the Historic Period. Gainesville, Florida, The University Presses of Florida.  18th to 19th centuries: Early non-Spanish settlement  In 1766, Samuel Touchett received a land grant from the British government of in the Miami area. The grant was surveyed by Bernard Romans in 1772. A condition for making the grant permanent was that at least one white settler had to live on the grant for every of land. While Touchett wanted to place a plantation on the grant, he was having financial problems and was never able to develop it.Braund, Kathryn E. Holland (1999), Bernard Romans: His Life and Times, in Romans, Bernard (1999). A Concise Natural History of East and West Florida, Modernized reprint of 1775 edition, Tuscaloosa, Alabama and London: The University of Alabama Press. . p 6, 56, 354 Cape Florida Lighthouse, the oldest-standing structure in Miami, built in 1825 Fort Dallas, built in 1836 The first permanent European settlers in the Miami area arrived around 1800. Pedro Fornells, a Menorcan survivor of the New Smyrna colony, moved to Key Biscayne to meet the terms of his Royal Grant for the island. Although he returned with his family to St. Augustine after six months, he left a caretaker behind on the island. On a trip to the island in 1803, Fornells had noted the presence of squatters on the mainland across Biscayne Bay from the island. In 1825, U.S. Marshal Waters Smith visited the Cape Florida Settlement (which was on the mainland) and conferred with squatters who wanted to obtain title to the land they were occupying.Blank, Joan Gill. 1996. Key Biscayne. Sarasota, Florida: Pineapple Press. . pp. 19, 27. On the mainland, the Bahamian \\"squatters\\" had settled along the coast beginning in the 1790s. John Egan had also received a grant from Spain during the Second Spanish Period. John's son James Egan, his wife Rebecca Egan, his widow Mary \\"Polly\\" Lewis, and Mary's brother-in-law Jonathan Lewis all received 640-acre land grants from the U.S. in present-day Miami. Temple Pent and his family did not receive a land grant, but nevertheless stayed in the area.Parks, Arva Moore. Miami, the Magic City. Miami: Community Media, c2008. p. 18-24. Treasure hunters from the Bahamas and the Keys came to South Florida to hunt for treasure from the ships that ran around on the treacherous Great Florida reef, some of whom accepted Spanish land offers along the Miami River. At about the same time, the Seminole Indians arrived along with a group of runaway slaves. In 1825, the Cape Florida Lighthouse was built on nearby Key Biscayne to warn passing ships of the dangerous reefs. In 1830, Richard Fitzpatrick bought land on the Miami River from Bahamian James Egan. He built a plantation with slave labor where he cultivated sugarcane, bananas, maize, and tropical fruit. In January 1836, shortly after the beginning of the Second Seminole War, Fitzpatrick removed his slaves and closed his plantation.Black, Hugo L., III. \\"Richard Fitzpatrick's South Florida, 1822‚Äì1840, Part II: Fitzpatrick's Miami River Plantation.\\" In Tequesta, no. XI (1981). The area was affected by the Second Seminole War, where Major William S. Harney led several raids against the Indians. Fort Dallas was located on Fitzpatrick's plantation on the north bank of the river. Most of the non-Indian population consisted of soldiers stationed at Fort Dallas. The Seminole War was the most devastating Indian war in American history, causing almost a total loss of native population in the Miami area. The Cape Florida lighthouse was burned by Seminoles in 1836 and was not repaired until 1846. After the Second Seminole War ended in 1842, Fitzpatrick's nephew, William English, re-established the plantation in Miami. He charted the \\"Village of Miami\\" on the south bank of the Miami River and sold several plots of land. When English died in California in 1852, his plantation died with him.Parks, Arva Moore. Miami, the Magic City. Miami: Community Media, 2008. p. 36-38. The Miami River lent its name to the burgeoning town, extending an etymology that derives from the Mayaimi Indian tribe. In 1844, Miami became the county seat, and six years later, a census reported that there were ninety-six residents living in the area.History of Miami-Dade county retrieved January 26, 2006 The Third Seminole War lasted from 1855 to 1858, but was not nearly as destructive as the previous one. However, it did slow down the rate of settlement of southeast Florida. At the end of the war, a few of the soldiers stayed and some of the Seminoles remained in the Everglades. From 1858 to 1896, only a handful of families made their homes in the Miami area. Those that did lived in small settlements along Biscayne Bay. The first of these settlements formed at the mouth of the Miami River and was variously called Miami, Miamuh, and Fort Dallas. Foremost among the Miami River settlers were the Brickells. William Brickell had previously lived in Cleveland, Ohio, California, and Australia, where he met his wife, Mary. In 1870, Brickell bought land on the south bank of the river. The Brickells and their children operated a trading post and post office on their property for the rest of the 19th century.Carr, Robert S. \\"The Brickell Store and Seminole Indian Trade.\\" In The Florida Anthropologist, v. 34, no. 4 (December 1981).McMahon, Denise, and Christine Wild. \\"William Barnwell Brickell in Australia.\\" In Tequesta, no. LXVII (2007) Other settlements within Miami's city limits were Lemon City (now Little Haiti) and Coconut Grove. Settlements outside the city limits were Biscayne, in present-day Miami Shores, and Cutler, in present-day Palmetto Bay. Many of the settlers were homesteaders, attracted to the area by offers of of free land by the United States federal government.  1890s: Fast growth and formation  Julia Tuttle, the founder of Miami The Barnacle Historic State Park, or the Barnacle, built in 1891, is the oldest house in its original location in Miami. In 1891, a Cleveland woman named Julia Tuttle decided to move to South Florida to make a new start in her life after the death of her husband, Frederick Tuttle. She purchased 640 acres on the north bank of the Miami River in present-day downtown Miami. She tried to persuade railroad magnate Henry Flagler to expand his rail line, the Florida East Coast Railway, southward to the area, but he initially declined.Parks, Arva Moore. Miami, The Magic City. Miami: Community Media, c2008. p. 81. In December 1894, Florida was struck by a freeze that destroyed virtually the entire citrus crop in the northern half of the state. A few months later, on the night of February 7, 1895, the northern part of Florida was hit by another freeze that wiped out the remaining crops and the new trees. Unlike most of the rest of the state, the Miami area was unaffected. Tuttle wrote to Flagler again, asking him to visit the area and to see it for himself. Flagler sent James E. Ingraham to investigate and he returned with a favorable report and a box of orange blossoms to show that the area had escaped the frost. Flagler followed up with his own visit and concluded at the end of his first day that the area was ripe for expansion. He made the decision to extend his railroad to Miami and build a resort hotel.Wiggins, Larry. \\"The Birth of the City of Miami.\\" In Tequesta, number LV (1995), p. 10-12. On April 22, 1895, Flagler wrote Tuttle a long letter recapping her offer of land to him in exchange for extending his railroad to Miami, laying out a city and building a hotel. The terms provided that Tuttle would award Flagler a tract of land for the city to grow. Around the same time, Flagler wrote a similar letter to William and Mary Brickell, who had also verbally agreed to give land during his visit. While the railroad's extension to Miami remained unannounced in the spring of 1895, rumors of this possibility continued to multiply, fueling real estate activity in the Biscayne Bay area. The news of the railroad's extension was officially announced on June 21, 1895. In late September, the work on the railroad began and settlers began pouring into the promised \\"freeze proof\\" lands. On October 24, 1895, the contract agreed upon by Flagler and Tuttle was approved. Collins Bridge, the first bridge to connect Miami to Miami Beach. With the railroad under construction, activity in Miami began to pick up. Men from throughout Florida flocked to Miami to await Flagler's call for workers of all qualifications to begin work on the promised hotel and city. By late December 1895, seventy-five of them already were at work clearing the site for the hotel. They lived mostly in tents and huts in the wilderness, which had no streets and few cleared paths. Many of these men were victims of the freeze, which had left both money and work scarce. On February 1, 1896, Tuttle fulfilled the first part of her agreement with Flagler by signing two deeds to transfer land for his hotel and the of land near the hotel site to him. The titles to the Brickell and Tuttle properties were based on early Spanish land grants and had to be determined to be clear of conflict before the marketing of the Miami lots began. On March 3, Flagler hired John Sewell from West Palm Beach to begin work on the town as more people came into Miami. On April 7, 1896, the railroad tracks finally reached Miami and the first train arrived on April 13. It was a special, unscheduled train and Flagler was on board. The train returned to St. Augustine later that night. The first regularly scheduled train arrived on the night of April 15. The first week of train service provided only for freight trains; passenger service did not begin until April 22. On July 28, 1896, the incorporation meeting to make Miami a city took place. The right to vote was restricted to all men who resided in Miami or Dade County. Joseph A. McDonald, Flagler's chief of construction on the Royal Palm Hotel, was elected chairman of the meeting. After ensuring that enough voters were present, the motion was made to incorporate and organize a city government under the corporate name of \\"The City of Miami\\", with the boundaries as proposed. John B. Reilly, who headed Flagler's Fort Dallas land company, was the first elected mayor. Initially, most residents wanted to name the city \\"Flagler\\". However, Henry Flagler was adamant that the new city would not be named after him. So on July 28, 1896, the City of Miami, named after the Miami River, was incorporated with 502 voters, including 100 registered black voters.Muir, Helen. 1953. Miami, U.S.A. Coconut Grove, Florida: Hurricane House Publishers. Pp. 66‚Äì7. The blacks provided the primary labor force for the building of Miami. Clauses in land deeds confined blacks to the northwest section of Miami, which became known as \\"Colored Town\\" (today's Overtown).Dunn, Marvin. Black Miami in the Twentieth Century Gainesville, Fl: University Press of Florida, 1997. p 57-64  Twentieth century = 1900s to 1930s: The Magic City  University of Miami, founded in 1925. Dade County Courthouse, built in 1928, is the tallest building built in the 1920s. The Miami River in 1935. Miami experienced a very rapid growth up to World War II. In 1900, 1,681 people lived in Miami, Florida; in 1910, there were 5,471 people; and in 1920, there were 29,549 people. As thousands of people moved to the area in the early 20th century, the need for more land quickly became apparent. Until then, the Florida Everglades only extended to three miles (5 km) west of Biscayne Bay. Beginning in 1906, canals were made to remove some of the water from those lands. Miami Beach was developed in 1913 when a two- mile (3 km) wooden bridge built by John Collins was completed. During the early 1920s, the authorities of Miami allowed gambling and were very lax in regulating prohibition, so thousands of people migrated from the northern United States to the Miami region. This caused the Florida land boom of the 1920s, when many high-rise buildings were built. Some early developments were razed after their initial construction to make way for larger buildings. The population of Miami doubled from 1920 to 1923.Parks, p 107 The nearby areas of Lemon City, Coconut Grove, and Allapattah were annexed in the fall of 1925, creating the Greater Miami area. However, this boom began to falter due to building construction delays and overload on the transport system caused by an excess of bulky building materials. On January 10, 1926 the Prinz Valdemar, an old Danish warship on its way to becoming a floating hotel, ran aground and blocked Miami Harbor for nearly a month.Muir, Helen. Miami, U.S.A. New York: Henry Holt and Company, 1953. p. 160. Already overloaded, the three major railway companies soon declared an embargo on all incoming goods except food. The cost of living had skyrocketed and finding an affordable place to live was nearly impossible.Parks, p 120 This economic bubble was already collapsing when the catastrophic Great Miami Hurricane in 1926 swept through, ending whatever was left of the boom. The Category 4 storm was the 12th most costly and 12th most deadly to strike the United States during the 20th century.Great Miami Hurricane. Retrieved January 27, 2006. According to the Red Cross, there were 373 fatalities, but other estimates vary, due to the large number of people listed as \\"missing\\". Between 25,000 and 50,000 people were left homeless in the Miami area. The Great Depression followed, causing more than sixteen thousand people in Miami to become unemployed. As a result, a Civilian Conservation Corps camp was opened in the area.Parks, p 131-132 During the mid-1930s, the Art Deco district of Miami Beach was developed. Also during this time, on February 15, 1933, an assassination attempt was made on President-elect Franklin D. Roosevelt. While Roosevelt was giving a speech in Miami's Bayfront Park, Giuseppe Zangara, an Italian anarchist, opened fire. Mayor Anton Cermak of Chicago, who was shaking hands with Roosevelt, was shot and died two weeks later. Four other people were wounded, but President-elect Roosevelt was not harmed. Zangara was quickly tried for Cermak's murder and was executed by the electric chair on March 20, 1933 in Raiford, Florida. Also in 1933, the Miami City Commission asked the Miami Women's Club to create a city flag design. The flag was designed by Charles L. Gmeinder on their behalf, and adopted by City Commission in November 1933. It is unknown why the orange and green colors were selected for the flag. One theory is that the colors were inspired by the orange tree, although the University of Miami was already using the colors of orange and green for their sports teams since 1926. In 1937 the local Ku Klux Klan raided La Paloma, an LGBT nightclub. After the non-lethal raid the nightclub became a site of a more solidified LGBT community and resistance against conservative sexual laws.  1940s: World War II  Flagler Street in Downtown Miami 20 minutes after surrender during World War II. Pan Am's terminal at Dinner Key in 1944 during World War II By the early 1940s, Miami was still recovering from the Great Depression when World War II started. Though many of the cities in Florida were heavily affected by the war and went into financial ruin, Miami remained relatively unaffected. Early in the war, German U-boats attacked several American ships including the Portero del Llano, which was attacked and sunk within sight of Miami Beach in May 1942. To defend against the U-boats, Miami was placed in two military districts, the Eastern Defense Command and the Seventh Naval District. In February 1942, the Gulf Sea Frontier was established to help guard the waters around Florida. By June of that year, more attacks forced military leaders in Washington, D.C. to increase the numbers of ships and men of the army group. They also moved the headquarters from Key West to the DuPont building in Miami, taking advantage of its location at the southeastern corner of the U.S. As the war against the U-boats grew stronger, more military bases sprang up in the Miami area. The U.S. Navy took control of Miami's docks and established air stations at the Opa-locka Airport and in Dinner Key. The Air Force also set up bases in the local airports in the Miami area. In addition, many military schools, supply stations, and communications facilities were established in the area. Rather than building large army bases to train the men needed to fight the war, the Army and Navy came to South Florida and converted hotels to barracks, movie theaters to classrooms, and local beaches and golf courses to training grounds. Overall, over five hundred thousand enlisted men and fifty thousand officers were trained in South Florida. After the end of the war, many servicemen and women returned to Miami, causing the population to rise to nearly half a million by 1950.  1950s to 1970s.  First Cuban wave = Map of Miami in 1955 Following the 1959 Cuban revolution that unseated Fulgencio Batista and brought Fidel Castro to power, most Cubans who were living in Miami returned to Cuba. Soon after, however, many middle class and upper class Cubans moved to Florida en masse with few possessions. Some Miamians were upset about this, especially the African Americans, who believed that the Cuban workers were taking their jobs. In addition, the school systems struggled to educate the thousands of Spanish-speaking Cuban children. Many Miamians, fearing that the Cold War would become World War III, left the city, while others started building bomb shelters and stocking up on food and bottled water. Many of Miami's Cuban refugees realized for the first time that it would be a long time before they would get back to Cuba.Parks, p 153‚Äì155 In 1965 alone, 100,000 Cubans packed into the twice daily \\"freedom flights\\" from Havana to Miami. Most of the exiles settled into the Riverside neighborhood, which began to take on the new name of \\"Little Havana\\". This area emerged as a predominantly Spanish-speaking community, and Spanish speakers elsewhere in the city could conduct most of their daily business in their native tongue. By the end of the 1960s, more than four hundred thousand Cuban refugees were living in Dade County. In the 1960s and 1970s, the Attorney General's authority was used to grant parole, or special permission, to allow Cubans to enter the country. However, parole only allows an individual permission to enter the country, not to stay permanently. To allow these immigrants to stay, the Cuban Adjustment Act was passed in 1966. This act provides that the immigration status of any Cuban who arrived since 1959 who has been physically present in the United States for at least a year \\"may be adjusted by the Attorney General to that of an alien lawfully admitted for permanent residence\\" (green card holder). The individual must be admissible to the United States (i.e., not disqualified on criminal or other grounds). = Civil Rights Movement = Miami Modern Architecture or MiMo, a style that originated in Miami in the 1950s as seen in the Bacardi Building in Midtown, built in 1963 and dedicated as a historic site in 2009. Although Miami is not really considered a major center of the Civil Rights Movement of the 1950s and 1960s, it did not escape the change that occurred. Miami was a major city in the southern state of Florida, and had always had a substantial African American and black Caribbean population. On August 7 and 8, 1968, coinciding with the 1968 Republican National Convention, rioting broke out in the black Liberty City neighborhood, which required the Florida National Guard to restore order. Issues were \\"deplorable housing conditions, economic exploitation, bleak employment prospects, racial discrimination, poor police- community relations, and economic competition with Cuban refugees.\\". Overcrowding due to the near-destruction of the black Overtown neighborhood was also a factor. During the 1970s, Miami was a news leader due to the response to a Dade County ordinance protecting individuals on the basis of sexual orientation. Opposition to this ordinance, which was repealed, was led by Florida orange juice spokeswoman, Anita Bryant. In December 1979, police officers pursued motorcyclist Arthur McDuffie in a high-speed chase after McDuffie made a provocative gesture towards a police officer. The officers claimed that the chase ended when McDuffie crashed his motorcycle and died, but the coroner's report concluded otherwise. One of the officers testified that McDuffie fell off of his bike on an Interstate 95 on-ramp. When the police reached him he was injured but okay. The officers removed his helmet, beat him to death with their batons, put his helmet back on, and called an ambulance, claiming there had been a motorcycle accident. Eula McDuffie, the victim's mother, said to the Miami Herald a few days later, \\"They beat my son like a dog. They beat him just because he was riding a motorcycle and because he was black.\\"Miami Herald, December 27, 1979 pg 1B. A jury acquitted the officers after a brief deliberation. After learning of the verdict of the McDuffie case, one of the worst riots in the history of the United States, the Liberty City Riots of 1980, broke out. By the time the rioting ceased three days later, over 850 people had been arrested and at least 18 people had died. Property damage was estimated at around one hundred million dollars.\\"Reliving the nightmare of the McDuffie riots\\" Miami Herald, dtd September 15, 2002. Retrieved January 28, 2006. In March 1980, the first black Dade County schools superintendent, Dr. Johnny L. Jones, was convicted on grand theft charges linked to gold-plated plumbing. His conviction was overturned on appeal and, on July 3, 1986, the state attorney Janet Reno announced that Jones would not be retried on these charges. However, in a separate case, he was convicted on misdemeanor charges of soliciting perjury and witness tampering and received a two-year jail sentence.Dunn, p 256-261  1980s and 1990s  Later immigration = Cuban refugees arriving in crowded boats during the Mariel Boatlift crisis. The Mariel Boatlift of 1980 brought 150,000 Cubans to Miami, the largest transport in civilian history. Unlike the previous exodus of the 1960s, most of the Cuban refugees arriving were poor, some having been released from prisons or mental institutions to make the trip. During this time, many of the middle class non-Hispanic whites in the community left the city, often referred to as the \\"white flight\\". In 1960, Miami was 90% non-Hispanic white, but by 1990, it was only about 10% non- Hispanic white. In the 1980s, Miami started to see an increase in immigrants from other nations, such as Haiti. As the Haitian population grew in Miami, the area known today as \\"Little Haiti\\" emerged, centered on Northeast Second Avenue and 54th Street. In 1985, Xavier Suarez was elected as Mayor of Miami, becoming the first Cuban mayor of a major city. In the 1990s, the presence of Haitians was acknowledged with Haitian Creole language signs in public places and ballots during voting. Another major Cuban exodus occurred in 1994. To prevent it from becoming another Mariel Boatlift, the Clinton Administration announced a significant change in U.S. policy. In a controversial action, the administration announced that Cubans interdicted at sea would not be brought to the United States but instead would be taken by the Coast Guard to U.S. military installations at Guantanamo Bay or to Panama. During an eight-month period beginning in the summer of 1994, over 30,000 Cubans and more than 20,000 Haitians were interdicted and sent to live in camps outside the United States. On September 9, 1994, the United States and Cuba agreed to normalize migration between the two countries. The agreement codified the new U.S. policy of placing Cuban refugees in safe havens outside the United States, while obtaining a commitment from Cuba to discourage Cubans from sailing to America. In addition, the United States committed to admitting a minimum of 20,000 Cuban immigrants per year. That number is in addition to the admission of immediate relatives of U.S. citizens. On May 2, 1995, a second agreement with the Castro government paved the way for the admission to the United States of the Cubans housed at Guantanamo, who were counted primarily against the first year of the 20,000 annual admissions committed to by the Clinton Administration. It also established a new policy of directly repatriating Cubans interdicted at sea to Cuba. In the agreement, the Cuban government pledged not to retaliate against those who were repatriated. These agreements with the Cuban government led to what has been called the Wet Foot-Dry Foot Policy, whereby Cubans who made it to shore could stay in the United States ‚Äì likely becoming eligible to adjust to permanent residence under the Cuban Adjustment Act. However, those who do not make it to dry land ultimately are repatriated unless they can demonstrate a well-founded fear of persecution if returned to Cuba. Because it was stated that Cubans were escaping for political reasons, this policy did not apply to Haitians, who the government claimed were seeking asylum for economic reasons. Since then, the Latin and Caribbean-friendly atmosphere in Miami has made it a popular destination for tourists and immigrants from all over the world. It is the third-biggest immigration port in the country after New York City and Los Angeles. In addition, large immigrant communities have settled in Miami from around the globe, including Europe, Africa, and Asia. The majority of Miami's European immigrant communities are recent immigrants, many living in the city seasonally, with a high disposable income. = Growth as a global city = Southeast Financial Center, the tallest skyscraper built in the 1980s office boom In the 1980s, Miami became one of the United States' largest transshipment point for cocaine from Colombia, Bolivia, and Peru.Awash in a Sea of Money Miami-New Times (2005), by Rebecca Wakefield, retrieved August 7, 2006. The drug industry brought billions of dollars into Miami, which were quickly funneled through front organizations into the local economy. Luxury car dealerships, five-star hotels, condominium developments, swanky nightclubs, major commercial developments and other signs of prosperity began rising all over the city. As the money arrived, so did a violent crime wave that lasted through the early 1990s. The popular television program Miami Vice, which dealt with counter-narcotics agents in an idyllic upper-class rendition of Miami, spread the city's image as one of the Americas' most glamorous subtropical paradises. Miami was host to many dignitaries and notable people throughout the 1980s and '90s. Pope John Paul II visited in November 1987, and held an open-air mass for 150,000 people in Tamiami Park.Miami officials who met Pope John Paul II share world's grief (2005), by Ana Rodriguez-Soto, retrieved February 1, 2006. Queen Elizabeth II and three United States presidents also visited Miami. Among them is Ronald Reagan, who has a street named after him in Little Havana.Parks, p 202 Nelson Mandela's 1989 visit to the city was marked by ethnic tensions. Mandela had praised Cuban leader Fidel Castro for his anti-apartheid support on ABC News' Nightline. Because of this, the city withdrew its official greeting and no high-ranking official welcomed him. This led to a boycott by the local African American community of all Miami tourist and convention facilities until Mandela received an official greeting. However, all efforts to resolve it failed for months, resulting in an estimated loss of over US$10 million.Dunn, p 347 = 1990s = Miami area.

Several financial scandals involving the Mayor's office and City Commission during the 1980s and 1990s left Miami with the title of the United States' 4th poorest city by 1996. With a budget shortfall of $68 Million and its municipal bonds given a junk bond rating by Wall Street, in 1997, Miami became Florida's first city to have a state appointed oversight board assigned to it. In the same year, city voters rejected a resolution to dissolve the city and make it one entity with Dade County. The City's financial problems continued until political outsider Manny Diaz was elected Mayor of Miami in 2001.

In 2000, the Eli√°n Gonz√°lez affair was an immigration battle in the Miami area. The controversy concerned six-year-old Eli√°n Gonz√°lez who was rescued from the waters off the coast of Miami. The U.S. and the Cuban governments, his father Juan Miguel Gonz√°lez, his Miami relatives, and the Cuban-American community of Miami were all involved. The climactic stage of this prolonged battle was the April 22, 2000, seizure of Eli√°n by federal agents, which drew the criticism of many in the Cuban-American community. During the controversy, Alex Penelas, the mayor of Miami-Dade County at the time, vowed that he would do nothing to assist the Bill Clinton administration and federal authorities in their bid to return the six-year-old boy to Cuba. Tens of thousands of protesters, many of whom were outraged at the raid, poured out into the streets of Little Havana and demonstrated. Car horns blared, demonstrators turned over signs, trash cans, and newspaper racks and some small fires were started. Rioters jammed a 10-block area of Little Havana. Shortly afterwards, many Miami businesses closed, as their owners and managers participated in a short, one-day boycott against the city, attempting to affect its tourism industry. Employees of airlines, cruise lines, hotels, car rental companies, and major retailers participated in the boycott. Eli√°n Gonz√°lez returned to Cuba with his father on June 28, 2000. In 2003, the controversial Free Trade Area of the Americas negotiation occurred. It was a proposed agreement to reduce trade barriers while increasing intellectual property rights.

Summary The title of the album is a reference to a name Rea's UK record label (Magnet) had considered christening him with to make him sound more attractive commercially. The album peaked at number forty-nine on the Billboard Hot 200, and charted for 12 weeks. It was awarded a gold album on October 26, 1978. The first single lifted from the album, \\"Fool (If You Think It's Over)\\", remains his biggest hit in the United States, peaking at number twelve on the Billboard Hot 100, charted for 15 weeks, and reaching number one on the Adult Contemporary Singles chart, and charting for 18 weeks. Unlike many of Rea's other singles, \\"Fool...\\" was not a great success on the UK Singles Chart, failing to chart on its first release and only reaching number thirty when re-released later in 1978 to capitalise on its U.S. success. This success was also helped by being played extensively by Radio Caroline, as it was dedicated to the British Home Office, who were trying to put the station off the air. The following single \\"Whatever Happened To Benny Santini?\\" peaked at number seventy-one on the Hot 100 chart, and charted 4 weeks. Whatever Happened to Benny Santini? was produced by Gus Dudgeon, who is perhaps most famous for producing most of Elton John's album output in the 1970s.

Early life Boyden was born at his family's homestead in Foxborough, Massachusetts. His maternal grandfather was a missionary in Japan and his great grandfather Otis Carey was the president of the Foxborough Bank and the Foxboro Branch Railroad. Headmaster of Deerfield Academy Frank Boyden attended Amherst College, and graduated with the class of 1902. Soon after graduation Boyden secured a position as headmaster of Deerfield Academy, at that time a public school, largely financed by the town of Deerfield, with an enrollment of fourteen boys and girls.McPhee, John (1966). The headmaster : Frank L. Boyden, of Deerfield (1st pbk. ed.). New York: Noonday Press. . Boyden's style of leadership was characterized by strong personal relations with the boys, largely built through competitive sports teams. His mentorship of students became the characteristic elan of the school. Boyden kept his desk in the hallway of the Main Building so as to keep the pulse of the school. As headmaster, he became known for taking in students who had been expelled from other schools. Boyden, who had seen his work at the school as a steppingstone to law school, remained the school's headmaster for sixty-six years. Through the years Deerfield joined the ranks of elite private schools such as Exeter and Andover. Boyden's efforts as headmaster resulted in a revival of the town of Deerfield. Henry and Helen Flynt were parents of a boy student at the academy. Boyden invited them to serve on the school's board and later to participate in town improvement efforts. The Flynts purchased and renewed numerous properties in the town of Deerfield. His leadership was not without controversy. It is said that he converted the public school to a private school because he was alarmed by the changing demographics of the town of Deerfield which was seeing an influx of Polish immigration. Boyden was replaced after his retirement in 1968 by David M. Pynchon. Personal life Boyden married Helen Sears Childs on June 29, 1907. She was a 1904 graduate of Smith College, which awarded her a Doctorate of Humane Letters in 1934. Boyden enjoyed driving through the Deerfield Valley in one of his several horse-drawn buggies. He was a delegate to the Republican National Convention from Massachusetts in 1960.  Legacy  A chair, the Frank L. Boyden Professor of Political Economy, exists at the University of Massachusetts Boston. Boyden Hall and Boyden Gym, on the campus of the University of Massachusetts Amherst, are named in his honor. Boyden was profiled by John McPhee (Deerfield, Class of 1949) in The New Yorker in an article later expanded into a book, The Headmaster: Frank L. Boyden, of Deerfield.

Discrimination is defined to include failing to make reasonable adjustments for the person. Complaints made under the Act are made to the Australian Human Rights Commission. Background to the legislation At the time of the Act's enactment, a variety of anti-discrimination acts for people with disabilities already existed in the different state legislatures, some dating back to the early 1980s. All states and territories except Tasmania and the Northern Territory had anti-discrimination laws in place, and these two places had legislation under consideration. There were three reasons given for enacting a federal law: *Standardise the scope of rights offered around the country *Implement the Australian Government's obligations as a signatory to international declarations on the rights of people with disabilities. *Enable regulation of discriminatory practices of Commonwealth authorities. Productivity Commission report In 2004, the findings of the Productivity Commission's enquiry into the Act were published.\\"Review of the Disability Discrimination Act 1992\\", 30 April 2004, Productivity Commission. The Commission found that while there was still room for improvement, particularly in reducing discrimination in employment, overall the Act had been reasonably effective. In addition, the Commission found that people with a disability were still less likely than other people to finish school, have a TAFE or university qualification, and be employed. They are more likely to have a below average income, be on a pension, live in public housing and in prison. The average personal income for people with a disability is 44 per cent of the income of other Australians. Significant cases=Maguire v Sydney Organising Committee for the Olympic Games (2000) This case, brought by Bruce Maguire, concerned the website of the Sydney 2000 Olympics, and the inability of those with vision impairments to efficiently use the website. In its decision, the Commission found that the Sydney Organising Committee for the Olympic Games (SOCOG) had discriminated against the complainant in contravention of s 24 of the Act, \\"in that the web site does not include ALT text on all images and image maps links, the Index to Sports cannot be accessed from the Schedule page and the Results Tables provided during the Games on the web site will remain inaccessible.\\" The commission also dismissed SOCOG's claim that modifying its website to meet the requirements would cause it unjustifiable hardship and established that such hardship cannot be used to avoid liability for breaching s 24 of the Act. SOCOG was ordered to render the website accessible by 15 September 2000.

A Bandera monumental about to be raised in El Z√≥calo, M√©xico City The banderas monumentales (Spanish for \\"monumental flags\\") are a collection of tall flagpoles containing large flags of Mexico located throughout Mexico. They are part of a program started in 1999 under President Ernesto Zedillo that is currently administered by the Secretariat of National Defense (Secretar√≠a de la Defensa Nacional). The main feature of these monuments (though not the biggest, see below) is a giant Mexican flag flying off a 50-meter-high (160-ft) flagpole. The size of the flag was and it was flown on a pole that measured high. In the time after the decree was issued, many more banderas monumentales have been installed throughout the country in various sizes. Many of the locations were chosen due to significant events in Mexican history that occurred there.  The 1999 decree  On July 1, 1999, President Zedillo officially started the flag program by issuing a decree that was published in the government register Official Journal of the Federation. While the formation of the flag project was one aspect of the decree, the overall aims of the law were to promote the flag, the Coat of Arms and the national anthem to instill a sense of patriotism into the Mexican population. Zedillo also used the timeframe of 1995 until 2000 to promote Mexican culture and history. Finally, this decree allowed the governors of each state to display more conspicuously the national symbols (S√≠mbolos Patrios) throughout their state.  The flag program  The deployment of banderas monumentales was outlined by Zedillo in a two-point program. The first point consisted of selecting the location for the monumental flags, of which the first were: *Those in the military base Campo Marte, in downtown, and in the San Jer√≥nimo roundabout in Mexico City *Tijuana, Baja California *Ciudad Ju√°rez, Chihuahua *Veracuz, Veracruz *Iguala, Guerrero The first two deployments were in M√©xico City, Mexico's capital. The next two were in Tijuana and Ciudad Ju√°rez, along the northern border with the United States. Veracruz is Mexico's main seaport in the Gulf of Mexico. Finally, Iguala was where the flag of the Three Guarantees (Bandera de las Tres Garant√≠as) recognized as Mexico's first flag, was created. The second point in the program accounted for the creation of a standard size for the flags and the poles they would be raised on. Zedillo's official decree stated that the flag sizes will be in height by in width. The flag size is close to the 4:7 ratio as stated in Article 3 of the Law on the National Coat of Arms, Flag and Anthem (Ley sobre el Escudo, la Bandera y el Himno Nacionales). The flagpoles were to have a height of . There have been smaller flags called banderas semi-monumentales installed for schools, smaller communities and other locations where logistics complicate the flying a giant flag. The flags are greatly smaller than its those outlined in the 1999 decree, but have the advantages that are cheaper and easier to take down than the monumental flags. Monumental flags are costly to construct and require a group of nearly twenty people to raise and lower them.  Biggest flags  The biggest monumental flag in Mexico is the one located in Monterrey (northeast) with a pole height of and a flag measuring , built to quadruple the size of the other monumental flags. It is located at the top of the Cerro del Obispado (Bishopric Hill) at an altitude of above sea level and it weighs . It was inaugurated on the D√≠a de la Bandera (Flag Day), February 24, 2005. Another flag with similar proportions is located in the city of Dolores Hidalgo, Guanajuato, the Cradle of Mexican Independence. This one was inaugurated on September 15, 2000 and it is at an altitude of above the sea level, on a very small military base.  Current locations  Since the construction of the first monumental flags other cities throughout the country have also deployed their own. They are mostly located in state capitals, historical towns and cities with important economic activity. * Monterrey, Nuevo Le√≥n * Dolores Hidalgo, Cuna de la Independencia Nacional, Guanajuato * Quer√©taro, Quer√©taro * M√©xico City, Federal District (three locations): **Z√≥calo, in the city center. **Campo Militar Marte (1 km northwest of Los Pinos) **San Jer√≥nimo * Iguala, Guerrero * Tonal√°, Jalisco * Piedras Negras, Coahuila * Tijuana, Baja California * Chihuahua, Chihuahua * Ciudad Ju√°rez, Chihuahua * Veracruz, Veracruz * Morelia, Michoac√°n * Tehuac√°n, Puebla * San Luis Potos√≠, San Luis Potos√≠ * El Calvario, Toluca * Cuautla and Cuernavaca, Morelos * Culiac√°n and Mazatl√°n, Sinaloa * M√©rida, Yucat√°n * Canc√∫n, Quintana Roo * Naucalpan, Estado de M√©xico * Nuevo Laredo, Tamaulipas * Ciudad Victoria, Tamaulipas * Tampico, Tamaulipas * Celaya, Guanajuato * Irapuato, Guanajuato * Ensenada, Baja California * Acapulco, Guerrero * San Miguel de Allende, Guanajuato * Cozumel, Quintana Roo The Tijuana, Ciudad Ju√°rez and Nuevo Laredo flags overlook the United States border and can be clearly seen from the U.

Wilhelmj was considered a child prodigy; when Henriette Sontag heard him in 1852 at seven years old, she said, \\"You will be the German Paganini\\". In 1861, Franz Liszt heard him and sent him to Ferdinand David with a letter containing the words \\"Let me present you the future Paganini!\\".Grove's Dictionary of Music and Musicians, 5th ed, 1954, reprinted 1966, Vol. IX, p. 297 His teachers included: Ferdinand David, for the violin, Moritz Hauptmann, for music theory and composition, and Joachim Raff for composition. A personal friend of Wagner, he led the violins at the premi√®re of Der Ring des Nibelungen in Bayreuth in 1876. He visited Australia in 1881, playing in the old Freemasons' Hall, but though appreciated by those who attended his concerts, their number was not sufficient to make the tour a financial success. It was not until introduced to London audiences by Jenny Lind in 1886 that Wilhelmj became a \\"household name\\". He has become famous for his late nineteenth century arrangement of the second movement of J. S. Bach's Orchestral Suite No. 3 for violin and piano, known as Air on the G String and for his re-orchestration of the 1st movement of Niccol√≤ Paganini's Violin Concerto No.1 in D major Op. 6 (1883/1884).Ivry Gitlis plays Paganini-Wilhelmj Violin Concerto No.1 (rec.1950) From 1894 on he was a Professor of violin at the Guildhall School of Music and Drama.

Wilhelmj owned a Stradivari 1725 violin from 1866 until his retirement, which later came to be known by his name.

The parade first took place in 1987, as the Lord Mayor of Westminster's Big Parade. The parade was renamed in 1994, and for 2000 only it was called the Millennium Parade. Organisation The London parade is the biggest New Year's Day street event of its kind. It attracts around a million spectators, and there is ticket-only seating at various points along the route. Parade route 2009 parade: Prospect Marching Knights in Trafalgar Square The parade route is two miles (3.2 km) long. Before 2010 it began at Parliament Square in Westminster, continuing along Parliament Street and Whitehall to Trafalgar Square. It then continued along Cockspur Street and Regent Street. The final section was along Piccadilly and the parade ended at Green Park. In 2010 the parade route was reversed to \\"appease US television broadcasters\\" and to \\"give the American audience the best views of the capital's landmarks, such as the Elizabeth Tower of the Palace of Westminster (The Houses of Parliament, also known as Big Ben) and Trafalgar Square\\". The revised route started at the Ritz Hotel, along Piccadilly to Piccadilly Circus, down Regent Street, then along Pall Mall to Trafalgar Square, then along Whitehall to Parliament Square. Participants The parade is used to raise funds for charities in London and representatives from each of the 32 London boroughs are encouraged to take part as a \\"borough entry\\", judged as part of the event.

It was developed at the turn of the 20th century by Belgian lawyers Paul Otlet and Henri La Fontaine. The Mundaneum has been identified as a milestone in the history of data collection and management, and (somewhat more tenuously) as a precursor to the Internet. In the 21st century, the Mundaneum is a non-profit organisation based in Mons, Belgium that runs an exhibition space, website and archive which celebrate the legacy of the original Mundaneum. History The Mundaneum was created in 1910, following an initiative begun in 1895 by Belgian lawyers Paul Otlet and Henri La Fontaine, as part of their work on documentation science. Otlet first called it the Palais Mondial (\\"world palace\\"), and it occupied the left wing of the Palais du Cinquantenaire, a government building in Brussels. Otlet and La Fontaine organized an International Conference of International Associations which was the origin of the Union of International Associations (UIA). Otlet regarded the project as the centrepiece of a new 'world city'‚Äîa centrepiece which eventually became an archive with more than 12 million index cards and documents. Some consider it a forerunner of the Internet (or, perhaps more appropriately, of systematic knowledge projects such as Wikipedia and WolframAlpha) and Otlet himself had dreams that one day, somehow, all the information he collected could be accessed by people from the comfort of their own homes. An English pamphlet published in 1914 described it: The Mundaneum was originally housed at the Palais du Cinquantenaire in Brussels (Belgium). This was originally renamed Palais Mondial, before the name Mundaneum was adopted. Otlet commissioned architect Le Corbusier to design a Mundaneum project to be built in Geneva, Switzerland in 1929. Although never built, the project triggered the Mundaneum Affair, a theoretical argument between Corbusier and Czech critic and architect Karel Teige. In 1933, with Otlet's agreement, Otto Neurath founded the Mundaneum Institute as a branch in The Hague in 1933, which became central to his activities when he moved to the Netherlands as a refugee following the defeat of the Austrian Social Democratic Party in the Austrian Civil War. In 1936 the Mundaneum Institute launched the International Encyclopedia of Unified Science. Later years and museum Entrance of the current Mundaneum (Mons, Belgium). When Nazi Germany invaded Belgium in 1940, the Mundaneum was replaced with an exhibit of Third Reich art, and some material was lost. The Mundaneum was reconstituted in a large but decrepit building in Leopold Park. It remained there until it was forced to move again in 1972. The Mundaneum has since been relocated to a converted 1930s department store in Mons (Wallonia), where the existing museum opened in 1998. On August 23 2015, a Google Doodle depicting the Mundaneum filing cabinets was released. The Doodle was meant to pay tribute to the creators of the Mundaneum as pioneers of open information.

Martin, \\"Superhero Role- Playing Games\\" in Gina Ren√©e Misiroglu and David A. Roach, The Superhero Book: The Ultimate Encyclopedia Of Comic-Book Icons And Hollywood Heroes. Visible Ink Press, 2004, (pp. 512-515). Other than sharing the same licensed setting, DC Heroes is unrelated to the West End Games DC Universe or the more recent Green Ronin Publishing DC Adventures game. DC Heroes was critically well received. Gameplay The game system in DC Heroes is sometimes called the Mayfair Exponential Game System (or MEGS). DC Heroes uses a logarithmic scale for character attributes. For example, a value of 3 is double a value of 2 and four times a value of 1. The scale allows characters of wildly different power levels to co-exist within the same game without one completely dominating a given area. For example, although Superman is many orders of magnitude stronger, Batman is capable of surviving a straight brawl with him for a short period. Conflicts are resolved using an Action Table and two ten-sided dice. The die-rolling system involves re-rolling any double result (the same number on both dice), so that any result is possible. Depending on the result on the Action Table, play moves to a Results Table to determine the degree of success if an action succeeds. Characters have a set of Attributes, Powers, and Skills. Attributes are the nine qualities every character has. Powers and Skills reflect innate ability or training. Attributes are divided into three categories (Physical, Mental, and Spiritual) and three attribute types (Action, Effect, and Resistance). For example, when Superman punches someone, he uses Dexterity to see if he connects, Strength to see how hard he hits, and the opposing character's Body to see how much damage he did. The value of a Power usually serves as both Active Value (AV) and Effect Value (EV) resisted by the target's Resistance Value (RV). All actions taken, even against inanimate objects, use that system. For example, investigators use AV and EV against a RV to determine the quality of information their efforts gather. Hero Points, which are used as experience points, can be spent during play to influence Action Table Results. Hero Points are also used in the creation of original characters. As in other points-based games, abilities cost a certain number of Hero Points to buy and improve. Because the power level of characters in the DC Universe varies, characters are built using varying amounts of Hero Points depending on the scale of the campaign. Features Some of DC Heroes' notable design features include: * A unified scale (\\"Attribute Points\\" or APs) measuring weight, distance, time, volume, money, and information. This allows for quickly evaluating the feasibility and impact of many actions, even at non-intuitive scales. For example, your Strength in APs minus the weight of an object in APs is the APs of distance you can throw that object. * An exponential progression of Attributes Points‚Äîa score of 4 corresponds to twice the quantity of a score of 3, a score of 5 is twice as good as a score of 4 and thus four times as good as score of 3, etc. This rapid progression intends to handle both Superman and Jimmy Olsen without using huge numbers but without drowning the differences between characters. * A 3√ó3 grid of physical, mental and mystical/social character stats expressing precision, force, and resilience in each area. * Action resolution based on 2d10 (re-rolling doubles) and two universal tables. * A list of broad Advantages, Drawbacks, and Skills that covers most characters. * A list of powers describing concrete effects rather than abstract game concepts and with a streamlined depiction of super-speed. * A system of Hero Points spent by characters to enhance their actions. This expresses endurance, willpower, narrative immunity, luck, and/or story flow. * A simple system of Subplots formalizing character(s)-specific stories that run parallel to the main intrigue ‚Äî romance, secret identity problems, day job matters, mysterious pasts, power complications, good or bad luck, and/or public image problems. * A simple system of Genre to change the texture of the game system depending upon whether players want silly Silver Age stories or gritty Iron Age stories. * Technological and magical inventions, social conflict, special tactics and combat maneuvers, improvised one-off use of powers, and other less distinctive subsystems. History Mayfair Games published the first edition in 1985. At the same time, DC released Crisis on Infinite Earths, which reshaped the DC universe. As a result, the game included both Silver Age and pre-Crisis writeups alongside new, post-Crisis write-ups. Mayfair released a simplified version of DC Heroes called The Batman Role-Playing Game in 1989 to coincide with the Batman film. The second edition of DC Heroes, published in 1989, was a boxed set which contained a \\"Read This First\\" introductory booklet, a \\"Rules Manual,\\" an introductory adventure \\"Exposed,\\" and a \\"Background/Roster Book\\" with game statistics for almost 250 DC characters. The set also contained the gamemaster's screen, an \\"Action Wheel\\" for resolving gameplay, two decks of cards with statistics for DC Comics characters, and dice. The rules incorporated material from the Batman Role-Playing Game and the Superman Sourcebook. These materials also included rules for advantages, drawbacks, and gadgetry. The third edition, published in 1993, further refined the rules and revamped the point costs of various abilities. Since the release coincided with the Death of Superman and Reign of the Supermen story arcs, it included ratings for the four variant versions of Superman from that story arc. Blood of Heroes Mayfair Games licensed the rights to the Mayfair Exponential Game System to another company, Pulsar Games, which later released the Blood of Heroes role-playing game without a license to use DC Comics' setting. New characters were created specifically for the Blood of Heroes universe. The setting included with the game is a 1990s-style superhero world with a heavy influence of occult and magical beings, which accounts for the much more detailed magic system included in the game. A subsequent edition, Blood of Heroes: Special Edition, incorporated many rule tweaks and much new material.  Reception  In the September 1985 edition of Dragon, Jeff Grubb found the rules of the first edition complex but well-written and well- presented, calling them \\"a very user-friendly set of rules that are enjoyable to read without making the reader lose track of what they are teaching.\\" Grubb concluded that only experienced roleplayers were ready for this game, saying, \\"This is the best product I have yet seen from Mayfair Games.DC mythos. But lest the point be lost, let‚Äôs say it again: This is not an easy or an introductory game... Come into it with some background in role-playing.\\" In the Sept-Oct 1985 edition of Space Gamer (Issue No. 76), Allen Varney reviewed the first edition, commenting that \\"at least the game survives its editing, and it turns out to be an innovating, thoughtful, respectable superhero RPG. Occasionally it's simplistic, but always by design. It is not realistic, but it closely simulated the unreality of the comics. This is a good game for superhero fans who are put off by the intricacy of Champions, the clumsiness of Villains and Vigilantes, and the juvenility of Marvel Super Heroes.\\" In the May 1986 edition of White Dwarf (Issue 77), Marcus Rowland found the rules complex, saying, \\"New players won't find it so easy to use, but shouldn't find it totally incomprehensible.\\" Rowland gave the game an above average overall rating of 8 out of 10. Stewart Wieck reviewed DC Heroes Role-Playing Game for White Wolf #20, rating it 4 out of 5 overall, and stated that \\"I liked the DC Heroes game before, but I find this new version to be excellent. The care taken in the preparation of this game (excluding the adventure) is wonderful. DC Heroes also includes more high quality components than any game ever produced.\\" In the January 1991 edition of Dragon, Allen Varney reviewed the second edition of the game, and praised the revised rules, stating that the game \\"combines broad combat options with speed of play. It quantifies noncombat interaction, such as interrogation, better than any game I know. Its AP system shows true ingenuity and, in the second edition, improved realism.\\" However, Varney criticized the game's rules for building gadgets, saying that the second edition was \\"Mayfair's third try at gadgets, and the rules still don't work.\\" Varney concluded his review with \\"if you find other superhero RPGs too slow or complex for your taste -- and if you don't mind one-table systems -- use the DC HEROES rules as a fast-paced superheroic combat system for your own campaign world.\\" Awards DC Heroes RPG won the H.G. Wells Award for Best Roleplaying Rules of 1985.

It left the Main South Line between Oamaru and Dunedin and served Port Moeraki between 1877 and 1879. Construction and operation In 1873, English contractors John Brogden and Sons began constructing a 41.6 kilometre long section of the Main South Line, and their contract included a 2.47 kilometre branch to Port Moeraki. In November 1876, a section of the Main South Line was opened from Oamaru to Hillgrove, and it was here that the Moeraki Branch left the main line. It climbed down an unstable and steep hillside to the sea at Port Moeraki, with a viaduct necessitated. The stability problems with the land became very evident when the viaduct had to be rebuilt before the line was even opened. The line was finally finished and opened for use on 15 January 1877. Trains ran daily every day of the week except Sundays. Local interests envisaged that Port Moeraki, an old whaling station, would become the primary port for north Otago, but it could not compete with Oamaru, especially when a breakwater was installed in Oamaru, and stability problems plagued the railway line. Services were regularly delayed by slips and it was not abnormal for the line to be closed for repairs. The difficult terrain and Port Moeraki's diminished significance meant that the line's continued existence could not be justified and in October 1879, it was closed and the rails were removed. Today, Port Moeraki is a small fishing village. The branch today Evidence of closed railways often diminishes or disappears entirely, so it is surprising that remnants of a line closed over a hundred years have actually been noted to still exist. The embankment from which the branch curved away from the Main South Line is visible from both the railway and nearby road, and although obscured by vegetation, other embankments and cuttings can still be seen. Remnants of the Millers Bay viaduct have so far survived the sea and can still be seen at the foot of the cliff beside which the railway once ran. It is possible to walk along the formation of some of the branch's path.

The end-around is a play in American football in which an end or wide receiver crosses the backfield towards the opposite end of the line and receives a handoff directly from the quarterback. The receiver then may proceed to do one of two things: he either runs the ball towards the line of scrimmage in order to gain yardage, or more rarely, attempts to pass to another eligible pass receiver. Both versions of the end-around are uncommon and can be considered trick plays. The play can also be combined with a Statue of Liberty play. The end-around should not be confused with an end reverse, in which the receiver takes a handoff from a player who has already taken a handoff from the quarterback. End-arounds are usually preferred to reverses in the NFL; although they are less convincing, they offer lower risk. End-arounds offer less chance of a fumble, as there is only one handoff rather than two. Also, end-arounds require less time to complete, thus reducing the chance of a large loss of yardage. Fly sweep A variation of the end around is the fly sweep or jet sweep. Whereas in the end around the receiver crosses the backfield after the snap, in the jet sweep, the receiver goes in motion and the quarterback calls for the snap just as the receiver passes him. The fly sweep is commonly seen at the high school and college level, but not as often at the professional level due to the defensive linemen generally being faster and thus able to stop the play for minimal or no gain, or even a loss. Fake end-around A derivative of the end-around has the quarterback hand off to a running back, then pretend he still has the ball, and is giving it to the wide receiver circling behind the action. This causes the defenders who should be covering the end around to 'stay at home' and not participate in pursuing the actual ball carrier, and desensitizes the defense to the threat of the actual end-around play when it is run. The player executing the fake may be called the \\"ghost\\". Another variation has the quarterback fake the end- around handoff, then either run with the ball himself in the other direction, or pass to a receiver, including the one to whom the fake was made. This is a form of play-action pass; some of the pass rushers may slow down the attack on the quarterback because of the fake, allowing more time for the receivers to get open. Often, a team will alternate between running an actual end-around and running a fake end-around on a large percentage of running plays. This technique is intended to increase the effectiveness of the play as the game develops, due to defenders becoming much more hesitant to commit either way. Early on the play may not be as effective, but gradually the defenders may lose their aggressiveness and thus the play can be relied on for a decent gain late in the game. History Some attribute the play's invention to Amos Alonzo Stagg. References Category:American football plays ","title":"End-around"},{"id":"3585700","text":":See other places named Hrobice.

Biography  He was born at Lucca, of a patrician family, and died archbishop of that city. At the age of sixteen he entered the Congregation of Clerics Regular of the Mother of God and made his profession in 1710. Except for some journeys made for purposes of study, his whole life, until his appointment as Archbishop of Lucca (1765), was spent in his religious home. In 1758, after a sojourn at Rome, where he had been received by Cardinal Passionei, there was question of elevating him to the Sacred College, but his collaboration in an annotated edition of the famous Encyclop√©die displeased Clement XIII. It should be remarked that the notes in this edition were intended to correct the text. Three years after his elevation to the episcopate he was smitten with an attack of apoplexy which left him suffering, deprived of the power of motion, until his death. His long career was filled chiefly with the re-editing of erudite ecclesiastical works with notes and complementary matter. His name appears on the title-pages of ninety folio volumes and numerous quartos. An indefatigable worker, widely read and thoroughly trained, his output was chiefly of a mechanical order, and unoriginal because hurried. His task was most often limited to inserting notes and documents in the work to be reproduced and sending the whole result to the printer, a process which resulted in numberless shortcomings. The only work worth mentioning that is all Mansi's own is his Tractatus de casibus et censuris reservatis, published in 1724, which brought him into difficulties with the Index Librorum Prohibitorum. The rest are all annotated editions. In 1726 there was Jo. Burch. Menckenii De Charlataneria eruditorum declamationes duae cum notis variorum; from 1725 to 1738, an annotated Latin translation of the three works of Dom Calmet‚Äîthe Dictionnaire de la Bible, Prol√©gom√®nes et Dissertations, and Commentaire litt√©ral. The best-known publication of Mansi is his vast edition of the Councils, Sacrorum Conciliorum nova et amplissima collectio (31 vols., folio, Florence and Venice, 1758‚Äì98), which was stopped by lack of resources in the middle of the Council of Florence of 1438. The absence of an index renders it inconvenient, and in a critical point of view it leaves an immensity to be desired. Mansi saw only fourteen volumes of it published, the others were finished from his notes. In 1748 he began to publish the first volume of a collection which was presented as a supplement to that of Coleti; the sixth and last volume of it appeared in 1752. The collection has been reprinted: in Paris by H. Welter, (1901-1927); and in Graz by the Akademische Druck- und Verlagsanstalt in 1960. The 1901 edition has been digitized by the University of Michigan Law Library.

High country is a New Zealand term for the elevated pastoral land of the South Island and - to a lesser extent - North Island. This terrain, which can be compared loosely with the outback of Australia, high veldt of South Africa and pampas of Argentina, lies in the rain shadow of the country's mountain ranges and tends to be extensively farmed land with a continental climate consisting of low rainfall, cold winters and hot summers. Livestock farmed in these regions include sheep and - increasingly - deer and alpaca, and a major ground- covering plant of the area is tussock. Regions of New Zealand closely associated with the high country include Central Otago and the Mackenzie Basin in the South Island, and parts of the North Island Volcanic Plateau. Much of the land is at a high altitude (hence its name), with the majority of the high country being more than 600 metres (2000 feet) above sea level. The land is marked with geological features associated with glaciation from the last ice age, with deep finger-shaped lakes such as Lake Wanaka and Lake Tekapo. Some high country stations grazed by leasehold farmers are up for tenure review, a process of turning it into freehold or conservation land.

It was once the location of a whaling station. In the 1870s, local interests believed it could become the main port for the north Otago area and a railway line, the Moeraki Branch, was built to the settlement and opened in 1877. However, the port could not compete with Oamaru and the lack of traffic as well as stability problems caused by difficult terrain led to the closure of the railway in 1879 after only two years of operation. The village is best known for the nearby Moeraki Boulders. Name 'Moeraki' is usually translated as 'sleepy sky'. There are other places with the same name or versions of it, all along the path from the Polynesian homeland, Hawaiki. History The south side of the Moeraki Peninsula has an Archaic (moa hunter) MƒÅori site at Waimataitai lagoon, which Atholl Anderson dated as 13th century, placing it in the second wave of New Zealand's early human occupation. Gavin McLean tentatively linked its occupants to Waitaha, conventionally the third iwi, or tribe, to arrive in southern New Zealand, after Kahui Tipua and Te Rapuwai. Waitaha's expedition leader was RƒÅkaihaut≈´. However, as McLean notes, 'Waitaha' is also a name simply used to designate all the peoples preceding KƒÅti Mamoe and KƒÅi Tahu, the last two arrivals before the European. It is safe to say Waimatatai is a 'Waitaha' site in that broad sense but there are no specific families it can be linked to. The Moeraki peninsula terminates to the south in Kartigi Point ('Katiki' in modern standard MƒÅori) where there was a pƒÅ (fortified settlement) of the Classic period of MƒÅori culture. Its traditional name was Te Raka-a-hineatua. According to tradition it was built by Taoka, a well known fighting chief of the late 17th to early 18th centuries, who also built fortresses at the Ashburton River and near Timaru. Shortly after it was built it was attacked by a party from Kaikoura who were successfully repulsed by Taoka in the battle known as Te Hakopa. Taoka was also in battle with chiefs further south at Huriawa (modern Karitane Peninsula), Mapoutahi (modern Goat Island Peninsula) and Pukekura (modern Taiaroa Head). Taoka's principal opponent was Te Wera. Jill Hamel has reported there were terraces, the best developed of any southern pƒÅ, and rectangular houses with stone fireplaces. Radio carbon dating has confirmed it was occupied in the 18th century. It used to be said Moeraki, like many other places on the east coast, was not a site of permanent occupation in pre-European times, but a major study, published in 1996, shows that is unlikely. Moeraki was traversed during the Sealers' War, also known as the War of the Shirt, in 1814. In that year a party of eight men under Robert Brown including two other Europeans and five lascars, or Indian seamen, came up the east coast from Stewart Island/Rakiura looking for a group of lascars who had absconded from the Matilda, Captain Samuel Fowler. According to the Creed manuscript, discovered in 2003, they camped for the night by their boat at 'the Bluff eight miles from Moeraki' to the north. However they were observed and attacked by MƒÅori. Two of the sealers escaped and fled to Bobby's Head and Goodwood, south of Moeraki, taking two days to get there and where they were later killed and eaten. They will have passed Moeraki going north and fleeing south. John Hughes, accompanied by W.I Haberfield and other men from the Weller brothers' Otago whaling station, established a whaling station in Moeraki Bay, Onekakara, on Boxing Day, December 26, 1836. Since that time European occupation has been continuous. When Hughes and his men arrived there were only nine MƒÅori living in the area, under Takatahara. In 1838 a large group arrived under Matiaha Tiramorehu and settled, in close proximity to the whalers. Many of the latter married MƒÅori women. Haberfield later maintained alcohol was absent at Moeraki, in striking contrast to more southerly stations, especially the one at Otago. The bay at Moeraki showing fishing boats After 1839 whaling dwindled and ceased by the late 1840s, although there was later a brief revival. Even so, some of the whalers stayed. There were European visitors in the early 1840s. After the Otago Association's settlement based at Dunedin further south in 1848 a Moeraki sheep run was leased by 1852. A 'Hundred' was declared in 1860, opening the area to closer rural settlement. From 1854 Moeraki Bay served as a port for North Otago starting the period of rivalry with the one at Oamaru described above. It was over by 1879. Since then Moeraki has been a fishing village, farming centre and coastal resort. Culture Moeraki Marae is located at Moeraki. It is a marae (meeting ground) of NgƒÅi Tahu and its Te R≈´nanga o Moeraki branch, and includes the Uenuku wharenui. Notable residents and visitors In the late 1890s Frances Hodgkins (1869‚Äì1947) who became New Zealand's best regarded expatriate artist, regularly visited Moeraki to paint local Maori. A number of those works are now in the collection of the Dunedin Public Art Gallery, Dunedin. Keri Hulme lived in Moeraki in the 1980s while she wrote her Booker Prize‚Äìwinning novel 'The Bone People'. Fleur Sullivan, the founder of the well-known Oliver's restaurant in Clyde, Central Otago, moved to Moeraki in the late 1990s and set up her distinctive waterside restaurant 'Fleur's Place'.

A. van Tilburg bequeathed his collection of Eastern and European ceramics, furniture, paintings, graphic works, carpets and metal ware to the University of Pretoria on 19 November 1976. This collection includes Chinese ceramics dating from 2000 BC, furniture dating from 1100 AC, several European paintings and vases from the Kangxi Emperor's personal collection. Examples of Chinese ceramics from the Qin (221-206 BC), Han (202 BC ‚Äì AD 220), Tang (AD 618-906), Song (AD 960-1279), Ming (1368-1644) and Qing (1644-1912) dynasties can be seen in this collection. There are also examples of Japanese Arita and Imari porcelain and Annamese (Vietnamese) ceramics, as well as 63 examples of early Delft earthenware. It includes plates, garnitures and flowerpots. In addition, there are three panels with 50 17th-century Delft tiles. Among the older pieces in the collection of Tang funerary wares there is a beige amphora with dragon handles, a typical polychrome figure of Ch'I-t'ou with an animal head and a 'three-colour' (green/brown/yellow) phoenix head pilgrim's flask. There are Tang lokapala tomb guardians of Fang-Hsiang standing on a reclining bull. These guardians are made partly in human and partly in animal form, and kept evil spirits away from the tombs of the dead. One of the Tang wares is a dark brown early pot, which was originally given to a Taoist monastery by Emperor Taizong of the Tang dynasty to commemorate his victory over the Eastern Turks in AD 630. The Van Tilburg Collection contains a representative collection of Song wares: many Celadons, a few Ding wares, nine Cizhou wares and a few Junyao wares. Celadons are characterised by the semi-translucent green glaze, which varies in colour from a pale grey-green to a deep olive-green. Junyao wares are unmistakable due to their blue, purple and crimson colours. There are seven Junyao items in the collection. This collection contains 550 pieces of Ming porcelain, of which 323 pieces are underglaze blue-and-white. There are 40 large Ming Swatow chargers and many smaller objects such as bowls, flasks, plates and cups. Examples of Chenghua (1465-1487), Hongzhi (1488-1505), Zhengde (1506-1521), Jiajing (1522-1566) and Wanli (1573-1619) wares are found in the Collection. Noteworthy Kangxi (1662-1722) and Qianlong (1736-1795) pieces are the large blue-and-white porcelain chargers, the underglaze red pots and blue-and-white ritual stand with two side vases. There are numerous polychrome Kangxi 'Famille verte' and Qianlong 'Famille rose' plates in the collection. The collection holds a pair of 'Famille noire' pots which belonged to the Kangxi Emperor. There are also a number of Imperial Japanese pieces in the collection, among them a blue-and-white Arita gendi with Arabian ormolu mouldings, an early 19th-century blue-and-white Arita charger decorated with a floral still life and pomegranates, a large blue-and-white vase decorated with priests and flowers, and many polychrome pieces of Japanese porcelain, such as a number of Imari tea sets and plates and a Kakeimon plate from about 1650 decorated with eight panels and a landscape. The Van Tilburg Collection has many Swatow pots, bowls, plates and chargers representing all the different decoration styles. There has been speculation that Van Tilburg's collection may have been plundered from Jewish families during World War II. There was a lot of negative publicity around the donation to the university and a court case in the Netherlands during the 1970s.

She earned her law degree from Boston University Law School and practiced law as a staff attorney for the Legal Aid Society and in the office of the Mayor of New York City.American Civil Liberties Union of South Carolina Activism ;Anti- pornography movement and anti-censorship movements In the late 1970s, Kaminer worked with Women Against Pornography, where she advocated private consciousness-raising efforts and opposed legal efforts to censor pornography. She contributed a chapter to the anti-pornography anthology, Take Back the Night, wherein she defended First Amendment freedoms and explained the dangers of seeking legal solutions to the perceived problem of pornography. She opposed efforts by Catharine MacKinnon and Andrea Dworkin to define pornography as a civil rights violation.

The archaeological collection comprises ceramics, metals, trade glass beads, indigenous beads, clay figurines, and bone and ivory artefacts as well as an extensive research collection of potsherds, faunal remains and other fragmentary material. The University of Pretoria established a permanent museum in June 2000, thereby making the archaeological collection more widely available for public access and interest beyond the confines of academia. The archaeological site of Mapungubwe The archaeological site of Mapungubwe [pronounced: Mah-POON-goob-weh], is located on the borders of Zimbabwe and Botswana in the Limpopo Province, and is situated near the confluence of the Shashe and Limpopo Rivers in southern Africa. It is here along these major rivers that the rise of complex Iron Age societies first began at the site of Schroda, a Zhizo/Leokwe community (AD 900 - AD 1000). Thereafter, a shift in regional economic and socio-political changes gave rise to the new nearby settlement of K2 (AD 1030‚ÄìAD 1220). A ruling class emerged and thus the first southern African state came into being at Mapungubwe Hill (AD 1220 - AD 1290). These sites collectively form the core area of a World Heritage Site, recognised for both its natural and cultural landscape that are considered to be of outstanding universal value. The discovery in 1932 was first attributed to the van Graan family. Mapungubwe Hill however had already been discovered in the early 1890s by an explorer named Fran√ßois Lotrie. Local knowledge of Mapungubwe has also been recorded from oral histories, thus supporting ethnographic and historical evidence about the awareness of Mapungubwe as a sacred hill. Evidence suggests that Mapungubwe therefore cannot be regarded as belonging to any single individual, but is rather symbolically associated with various groups of people. The combination of archaeological research, historical records and oral traditions does nonetheless expand the understanding of pre-colonial societies and their settlement in and around Mapungubwe over periods of time. The collection Interior of the Mapungubwe gold gallery Close-up of the golden rhinoceros of Mapungubwe The discovery of gold artefacts on Mapungubwe Hill in 1932 served as a catalyst for detailed academic research early in 1933 after the University of Pretoria had secured research rights from the government. Large- scale excavations were undertaken between 1933 and 1940, until research was disrupted by the outbreak of World War II. Intermittent excavations followed in the 1950s, which were then continued by more thorough stratigraphic excavations throughout 1960s up to the late 1990s. Over decades, these excavations and scientific findings were largely held within academia and rarely reached public knowledge. The collection was assembled over 80 years of excavations by the University of Pretoria, although minor collections of Mapungubwe material are housed at several other institutions throughout South Africa. In 2003, with the declaration of Mapungubwe by UNESCO as a World Heritage Site, a suspension was placed on all excavations at Mapungubwe, a decision which is still in place as of 2016. The Mapungubwe Collection is on public display at both the University of Pretoria Museums as well as the Mapungubwe Gold Collection new Javett-UP Arts Centre which opened its doors on 24 September 2019.

Tobacco use has predominantly negative effects on human health and concern about health effects of tobacco has a long history. Research has focused primarily on cigarette tobacco smoking. Tobacco smoke contains more than 70 chemicals that cause cancer. Tobacco also contains nicotine, which is a highly addictive psychoactive drug. When tobacco is smoked, nicotine causes physical and psychological dependency. Cigarettes sold in underdeveloped countries tend to have higher tar content, and are less likely to be filtered, potentially increasing vulnerability to tobacco smoking related disease in these regions. Tobacco use is the single greatest cause of preventable death globally. As many as half of people who use tobacco die from complications of tobacco use. The World Health Organization (WHO) estimates that each year tobacco causes about 6 million deaths (about 10% of all deaths) with 600,000 of these occurring in non- smokers due to second hand smoke. In the 20th century tobacco is estimated to have caused 100 million deaths. Similarly, the United States Centers for Disease Control and Prevention describes tobacco use as \\"the single most important preventable risk to human health in developed countries and an important cause of premature death worldwide.\\"\\"Nicotine: A Powerful Addiction .\\" Centers for Disease Control and Prevention. Currently, the number of premature deaths in the U.S. from tobacco use per year outnumber the number of workers employed in the tobacco industry by 4 to 1. According to a 2014 review in the New England Journal of Medicine, tobacco will, if current smoking patterns persist, kill about 1 billion people in the 21st century, half of them before the age of 70. Tobacco use leads most commonly to diseases affecting the heart, liver and lungs. Smoking is a major risk factor for heart attacks, strokes, chronic obstructive pulmonary disease (COPD) (including emphysema and chronic bronchitis), and several cancers (particularly lung cancer, cancers of the larynx and mouth, bladder cancer, and pancreatic cancer). It also causes peripheral arterial disease and high blood pressure. The effects depend on the number of years that a person smokes and on how much the person smokes. Starting smoking earlier in life and smoking cigarettes higher in tar increases the risk of these diseases. Also, environmental tobacco smoke, or secondhand smoke, has been shown to cause adverse health effects in people of all ages. Tobacco use is a significant factor in miscarriages among pregnant smokers, and it contributes to a number of other health problems of the fetus such as premature birth, low birth weight, and increases by 1.4 to 3 times the chance of sudden infant death syndrome (SIDS). Incidence of erectile dysfunction is approximately 85 percent higher in male smokers compared to non-smokers. Several countries have taken measures to control the consumption of tobacco with usage and sales restrictions as well as warning messages printed on packaging. Additionally, smoke-free laws that ban smoking in public places such as workplaces, theaters, and bars and restaurants reduce exposure to secondhand smoke and help some people who smoke to quit, without negative economic effects on restaurants or bars. Tobacco taxes that increase the price are also effective, especially in developing countries. The idea that tobacco use caused some diseases, including mouth cancers, was initially, in the late 1700s and the 1800s, widely accepted by the medical community. In the 1880s, automation slashed the cost of cigarettes, and use expanded. From the 1890s onwards, associations of tobacco use with cancers and vascular disease were regularly reported; a metaanalysis citing 167 other works was published in 1930, and concluded that tobacco use caused cancer. Increasingly solid observational evidence was published throughout the 1930s, and in 1938, Science published a paper showing that tobacco users live substantially shorter lives. Case-control studies were published in Nazi Germany in 1939 and 1943, and one in the Netherlands in 1948, but widespread attention was first drawn by five case-control studies published in 1950 by researchers from the US and UK. These studies were widely criticized as showing correlation, not causality. Follow up prospective cohort studies in the early 1950s clearly found that smokers died faster, and were more likely to die of lung cancer and cardiovascular disease. These results were first widely accepted in the medical community, and publicized among the general public, in the mid-1960s.  History =Pre-cigarette Concern about health effects of tobacco has a long history. The coughing, throat irritation, and shortness of breath caused by smoking have always been obvious. During Early Modern times, West African Muslim scholars knew the negative health effects of smoking tobacco. The dangers of tobacco smoking were documented in the Timbuktu manuscripts.Djian, Jean-Michel (24 May 2007). Timbuktu manuscripts: Africa‚Äôs written history unveiled . Unesco, ID 37896. Pipe smoking gradually became generally accepted as a cause of mouth cancers following work done in the 1700s. An association between a variety of cancers and tobacco use was repeatedly observed from the late 1800s into the early 1920s. An association between tobacco use and vascular disease was reported from the late 1800s onwards. Gideon Lincecum, an American naturalist and practitioner of botanical medicine, wrote in the early 19th century on tobacco: \\"This poisonous plant has been used a great deal as a medicine by the old school faculty, and thousands have been slain by it. ... It is a very dangerous article, and use it as you will, it always diminishes the vital energies in exact proportion to the quantity used ‚Äì it may be slowly, but it is very sure.\\" The 1880s invention of automated cigarette-making machinery in the American South made it possible to mass-produce cigarettes at low cost, and smoking became common. This led to a backlash and a tobacco prohibition movement, which challenged tobacco use as harmful and brought about some bans on tobacco sale and use. In 1912, American Dr. Isaac Adler was the first to strongly suggest that lung cancer is related to smoking. In 1924, economist Irving Fisher wrote an anti-smoking article for Reader's Digest which said \\"...tobacco lowers the whole tone of the body and decreases its vital power and resistance ... tobacco acts like a narcotic poison, like opium, and like alcohol, though usually in a less degree\\". Reader's Digest for many years published frequent anti-smoking articles. Prior to World War I, lung cancer was considered to be a rare disease, which most physicians would never see during their career., cited in With the postwar rise in popularity of cigarette smoking, however, came an epidemic of lung cancer. Early observational studies From the 1890s onwards, associations of tobacco use with cancers and vascular disease were regularly reported. In 1930, Fritz Lickint of Dresden, Germany, published a metaanalysis citing 167 other works to link tobacco use to lung cancer. Lickint showed that lung cancer sufferers were likely to be smokers. He also argued that tobacco use was the best way to explain the fact that lung cancer struck men four or five times more often than women (since women smoked much less), and discussed the causal effect of smoking on cancers of the liver and bladder. More observational evidence was published throughout the 1930s, and in 1938, Science published a paper showing that tobacco users live substantially shorter lives. It built a survival curve from family history records kept at the Johns Hopkins School of Hygiene and Public Health. This result was ignored or incorrectly explained away. An association between tobacco and heart attacks was first mentioned in the 1930; a large case‚Äìcontrol study found a significant association in 1940, but avoided saying anything about cause, on the grounds that such a conclusion would cause controversy and doctors were not yet ready for it. Official hostility to tobacco use was widespread in Nazi Germany where case-control studies were published in 1939 and 1943. Another was published in the Netherlands in 1948. A case-control study on lung cancer and smoking, done in 1939 by Franz Hermann M√ºller, had serious weaknesses in its methodology, but study design problems were better addressed in subsequent studies. The association of anti-tobacco research and public health measures with the Nazi leadership may have contributed to the lack of attention paid to these studies. They were also published in German and Dutch. These studies were widely ignored. In 1947 the British Medical Council held a conference to discuss the reason for the rise in lung cancer deaths; unaware of the German studies, they planned and started their own. Five case-control studies published in 1950 by researchers from the US and UK did draw widespread attention. The strongest results were found by \\"Smoking and carcinoma of the lung. Preliminary report\\", by Richard Doll and Austin Hill, and the 1950 Wynder and Graham Study, entitled \\"Tobacco Smoking as a Possible Etiologic Factor in Bronchiogenic Carcinoma: A Study of Six Hundred and Eighty-Four Proved Cases\\". These two studies were the largest, and the only ones to carefully exclude ex-smokers from their nonsmokers group. The other three studies also reported that, to quote one, \\"smoking was powerfully implicated in the causation of lung cancer\\". The Doll and Hill paper reported that \\"heavy smokers were fifty times as likely as non-smokers to contract lung cancer\\". Causality The case-control studies clearly showed a close link between smoking and lung cancer, but were criticized for not showing causality. Follow-up large prospective cohort studies in the early 1950s showed clearly that smokers died faster, and were more likely to die of lung cancer, cardiovascular disease, and a list of other diseases which lengthened as the studies continued The British Doctors Study, a longitudinal study of some 40,000 doctors, began in 1951. By 1954 it had evidence from three years of doctors' deaths, based on which the government issued advice that smoking and lung cancer rates were related (the British Doctors Study last reported in 2001, by which time there were ‚âà40 linked diseases). The British Doctors Study demonstrated that about half of the persistent cigarette smokers born in 1900‚Äì1909 were eventually killed by their addiction (calculated from the logarithms of the probabilities of surviving from 35‚Äì70, 70‚Äì80, and 80‚Äì90) and about two thirds of the persistent cigarette smokers born in the 1920s would eventually be killed by their addiction. Public awareness In 1953, scientists at the Sloan-Kettering Institute in New York City demonstrated that cigarette tar painted on the skin of mice caused fatal cancers. This work attracted much media attention; the New York Times and Life both covered the issue. The Reader's Digest published an article entitled \\"Cancer by the Carton\\". On January 11, 1964, the United States Surgeon General's Report on Smoking and Health was published; this led millions of American smokers to quit, the banning of certain advertising, and the requirement of warning labels on tobacco products. These results were first widely accepted in the medical community, and publicized among the general public, in the mid-1960s. The medical community's resistance to the idea that tobacco caused disease has been attributed to bias from nicotine-dependent doctors, the novelty of the adaptations needed to apply epidemiological techniques and heuristics to non- infectious diseases, and tobacco industry pressure. The health effects of smoking have been significant for the development of the science of epidemiology. As the mechanism of carcinogenicity is radiomimetic or radiological, the effects are stochastic. Definite statements can be made only on the relative increased or decreased probabilities of contracting a given disease. For a particular individual, it is impossible to definitively prove a direct causal link between exposure to a radiomimetic poison such as tobacco smoke and the cancer that follows; such statements can only be made at the aggregate population level. Tobacco companies have capitalized on this philosophical objection and exploited the doubts of clinicians, who consider only individual cases, on the causal link in the stochastic expression of the toxicity as actual disease. There have been multiple court cases against tobacco companies for having researched the health effects of tobacco, but having then suppressed the findings or formatted them to imply lessened or no hazard. After a ban on smoking in all enclosed public places was introduced in Scotland in March 2006, there was a 17 percent reduction in hospital admissions for acute coronary syndrome. 67% of the decrease occurred in non- smokers.  Health effects of smoking  delphic analysis regarding 20 popular recreational drugs. Tobacco was ranked 3rd in dependence, 14th in physical harm, and 12th in social harm. Smoking most commonly leads to diseases affecting the heart and lungs and will commonly affect areas such as hands or feet. First signs of smoking related health issues often show up as numbness in the extremities, with smoking being a major risk factor for heart attacks, chronic obstructive pulmonary disease (COPD), emphysema, and cancer, particularly lung cancer, cancers of the larynx and mouth, and pancreatic cancer. Overall life expectancy is also reduced in long term smokers, with estimates ranging from 10 to 17.9 years fewer than nonsmokers. About one half of long term male smokers will die of illness due to smoking. The association of smoking with lung cancer is strongest, both in the public perception and etiologically. Among male smokers, the lifetime risk of developing lung cancer is 17.2%; among female smokers, the risk is 11.6%. This risk is significantly lower in nonsmokers: 1.3% in men and 1.4% in women. A person's increased risk of contracting disease is related to the length of time that a person continues to smoke as well as the amount smoked. However, even smoking one cigarette a day raises the risk of coronary heart disease by about 50% or more, and for stroke by about 30%. Smoking 20 cigarettes a day entails a higher risk, but not proportionately. If someone stops smoking, then these chances gradually decrease as the damage to their body is repaired. A year after quitting, the risk of contracting heart disease is half that of a continuing smoker. The health risks of smoking are not uniform across all smokers. Risks vary according to the amount of tobacco smoked, with those who smoke more at greater risk. Smoking so-called \\"light\\" cigarettes does not reduce the risk.  Mortality  Smoking is the cause of about 5 million deaths per year. This makes it the most common cause of preventable early death. One study found that male and female smokers lose on average of 13.2 and 14.5 years of life, respectively. Another found a loss of life of 6.8 years. Each cigarette that is smoked is estimated to shorten life by an average of 11 minutes. At least half of all lifelong smokers die earlier as a result of smoking. Smokers are three times as likely to die before the age of 60 or 70 as non-smokers. In the United States, cigarette smoking and exposure to tobacco smoke accounts for roughly one in five, or at least 443,000 premature deaths annually. To put this into context, ABC's Peter Jennings (who would later die at 67 from complications of lung cancer due to his life-long smoking habit) famously reported that in the US alone, tobacco kills the equivalent of three jumbo jets full of people crashing every day, with no survivors.Never Say Die, an ABC News special by Peter Jennings 6/27/1996 On a worldwide basis, this equates to a single jumbo jet every hour. A 2015 study found that about 17% of mortality due to cigarette smoking in the United States is due to diseases other than those usually believed to be related. It is estimated that there are between 1 and 1.4 deaths per million cigarettes smoked. In fact, cigarette factories are the most deadly factories in the history of the world. See the below chart detailing the highest-producing cigarette factories, and their estimated deaths caused annually due to the health detriments of cigarettes.

The primary risks of tobacco usage include many forms of cancer, particularly lung cancer, kidney cancer, cancer of the larynx and head and neck, bladder cancer, cancer of the esophagus, cancer of the pancreas and stomach cancer. Studies have established a relationship between tobacco smoke, including secondhand smoke, and cervical cancer in women. There is some evidence suggesting a small increased risk of myeloid leukemia, squamous cell sinonasal cancer, liver cancer, colorectal cancer, cancers of the gallbladder, the adrenal gland, the small intestine, and various childhood cancers. The possible connection between breast cancer and tobacco is still uncertain. Lung cancer risk is highly affected by smoking, with up to 90% of cases being caused by tobacco smoking.Pesch, B., Kendzia, B., Gustavsson, P., J√∂ckel, K.-H., Johnen, G., Pohlabeln, H., ‚Ä¶ Br√ºning, T.

Risk of developing lung cancer increases with number of years smoking and number of cigarettes smoked per day.United States Department of Health & Human Services. Reducing the Health Consequences of Smoking: 25 Years of Progress. A Report of the Surgeon General. From http://profiles.nlm.nih.gov/ps/retrieve/ResourceMetadata/NNBBXS Accessed: Nov 2012 Smoking can be linked to all subtypes of lung cancer. Small-cell carcinoma (SCLC) is the most closely associated with almost 100% of cases occurring in smokers.Kalemkerian, G. P., Akerley, W., Bogner, P., Borghaei, H., Chow, L. Q., Downey, R. J., ‚Ä¶ Hughes, M. (2013). Small Cell Lung Cancer: Clinical Practice Guidelines in Oncology. Journal of the National Comprehensive Cancer Network : JNCCN, 11(1), 78‚Äì98. This form of cancer has been identified with autocrine growth loops, proto-oncogene activation and inhibition of tumour suppressor genes. SCLC may originate from neuroendocrine cells located in the bronchus called Feyrter cells. The risk of dying from lung cancer before age 85 is 22.1% for a male smoker and 11.9% for a female smoker, in the absence of competing causes of death. The corresponding estimates for lifelong nonsmokers are a 1.1% probability of dying from lung cancer before age 85 for a man of European descent, and a 0.8% probability for a woman.  Pulmonary  Since establishing causation through experimental trials was not possible due to ethical restrictions, a lengthy study was conducted in order to establish the strong association necessary to allow for legislative action against tobacco consumption. In smoking, long term exposure to compounds found in the smoke (e.g., carbon monoxide and cyanide) are believed to be responsible for pulmonary damage and for loss of elasticity in the alveoli, leading to emphysema and COPD. Chronic obstructive pulmonary disease (COPD) caused by smoking, is a permanent, incurable (often terminal) reduction of pulmonary capacity characterised by shortness of breath, wheezing, persistent cough with sputum, and damage to the lungs, including emphysema and chronic bronchitis. The carcinogen acrolein and its derivatives also contribute to the chronic inflammation present in COPD.  Cardiovascular disease  Smoking can cause atherosclerosis, leading to coronary artery disease and peripheral arterial disease. Tobacco stains on primarily the second and third fingers of a heavy smoker Inhalation of tobacco smoke causes several immediate responses within the heart and blood vessels. Within one minute the heart rate begins to rise, increasing by as much as 30 percent during the first 10 minutes of smoking. Carbon monoxide in tobacco smoke exerts negative effects by reducing the blood's ability to carry oxygen. Smoking also increases the chance of heart disease, stroke, atherosclerosis, and peripheral vascular disease. Several ingredients of tobacco lead to the narrowing of blood vessels, increasing the likelihood of a blockage, and thus a heart attack or stroke. According to a study by an international team of researchers, people under 40 are five times more likely to have a heart attack if they smoke. Exposure to tobacco smoke is known to increase oxidative stress in the body by various mechanisms, including depletion of plasma antioxidants such as vitamin C. Recent research by American biologists has shown that cigarette smoke also influences the process of cell division in the cardiac muscle and changes the heart's shape. The usage of tobacco has also been linked to Buerger's disease (thromboangiitis obliterans) the acute inflammation and thrombosis (clotting) of arteries and veins of the hands and feet. Although cigarette smoking causes a greater increase in the risk of cancer than cigar smoking, cigar smokers still have an increased risk for many health problems, including cancer, when compared to non-smokers. As for second-hand smoke, the NIH study points to the large amount of smoke generated by one cigar, saying \\"cigars can contribute substantial amounts of tobacco smoke to the indoor environment; and, when large numbers of cigar smokers congregate in a cigar smoking event, the amount of ETS [i.e. second-hand smoke] produced is sufficient to be a health concern for those regularly required to work in those environments.\\" Smoking tends to increase blood cholesterol levels. Furthermore, the ratio of high-density lipoprotein (HDL, also known as the \\"good\\" cholesterol) to low-density lipoprotein (LDL, also known as the \\"bad\\" cholesterol) tends to be lower in smokers compared to non- smokers. Smoking also raises the levels of fibrinogen and increases platelet production (both involved in blood clotting) which makes the blood thicker and more likely to clot. Carbon monoxide binds to hemoglobin (the oxygen-carrying component in red blood cells), resulting in a much stabler complex than hemoglobin bound with oxygen or carbon dioxide‚Äîthe result is permanent loss of blood cell functionality. Blood cells are naturally recycled after a certain period of time, allowing for the creation of new, functional red blood cells. However, if carbon monoxide exposure reaches a certain point before they can be recycled, hypoxia (and later death) occurs. All these factors make smokers more at risk of developing various forms of arteriosclerosis (hardening of the arteries). As the arteriosclerosis progresses, blood flows less easily through rigid and narrowed blood vessels, making the blood more likely to form a thrombosis (clot). Sudden blockage of a blood vessel may lead to an infarction (stroke or heart attack). However, it is also worth noting that the effects of smoking on the heart may be more subtle. These conditions may develop gradually given the smoking-healing cycle (the human body heals itself between periods of smoking), and therefore a smoker may develop less significant disorders such as worsening or maintenance of unpleasant dermatological conditions, e.g. eczema, due to reduced blood supply. Smoking also increases blood pressure and weakens blood vessels.  Renal  In addition to increasing the risk of kidney cancer, smoking can also contribute to additional renal damage. Smokers are at a significantly increased risk for chronic kidney disease than non-smokers. A history of smoking encourages the progression of diabetic nephropathy.  Influenza  A study of an outbreak of an (H1N1) influenza in an Israeli military unit of 336 healthy young men to determine the relation of cigarette smoking to the incidence of clinically apparent influenza, revealed that, of 168 smokers, 68.5 percent had influenza, as compared with 47.2 percent of nonsmokers. Influenza was also more severe in the smokers; 50.6 percent of them lost work days or required bed rest, or both, as compared with 30.1 percent of the nonsmokers. According to a study of 1,900 male cadets after the 1968 Hong Kong A2 influenza epidemic at a South Carolina military academy, compared with nonsmokers, heavy smokers (more than 20 cigarettes per day) had 21% more illnesses and 20% more bed rest, light smokers (20 cigarettes or fewer per day) had 10% more illnesses and 7% more bed rest. The effect of cigarette smoking upon epidemic influenza was studied prospectively among 1,811 male college students. Clinical influenza incidence among those who daily smoked 21 or more cigarettes was 21% higher than that of non-smokers. Influenza incidence among smokers of 1 to 20 cigarettes daily was intermediate between non-smokers and heavy cigarette smokers. Surveillance of a 1979 influenza outbreak at a military base for women in Israel revealed that influenza symptoms developed in 60.0% of the current smokers vs. 41.6% of the nonsmokers. Smoking seems to cause a higher relative influenza-risk in older populations than in younger populations. In a prospective study of community- dwelling people 60‚Äì90 years of age, during 1993, of unimmunized people 23% of smokers had clinical influenza as compared with 6% of non-smokers. Smoking may substantially contribute to the growth of influenza epidemics affecting the entire population. However the proportion of influenza cases in the general non-smoking population attributable to smokers has not yet been calculated.  Mouth  Dental radiograph showing bone loss in a 32 year old heavy smoker. Perhaps the most serious oral condition that can arise is that of oral cancer. However, smoking also increases the risk for various other oral diseases, some almost completely exclusive to tobacco users. The National Institutes of Health, through the National Cancer Institute, determined in 1998 that \\"cigar smoking causes a variety of cancers including cancers of the oral cavity (lip, tongue, mouth, throat), esophagus, larynx, and lung.\\" Pipe smoking involves significant health risks, particularly oral cancer. Roughly half of periodontitis or inflammation around the teeth cases are attributed to current or former smoking. Smokeless tobacco causes gingival recession and white mucosal lesions. Up to 90% of periodontitis patients who are not helped by common modes of treatment are smokers. Smokers have significantly greater loss of bone height than nonsmokers, and the trend can be extended to pipe smokers to have more bone loss than nonsmokers. Smoking has been proven to be an important factor in the staining of teeth. Halitosis or bad breath is common among tobacco smokers. Tooth loss has been shown to be 2 to 3 times higher in smokers than in non-smokers. In addition, complications may further include leukoplakia, the adherent white plaques or patches on the mucous membranes of the oral cavity, including the tongue.  Infection  Smoking is also linked to susceptibility to infectious diseases, particularly in the lungs (pneumonia). Smoking more than 20 cigarettes a day increases the risk of tuberculosis by two to four times, and being a current smoker has been linked to a fourfold increase in the risk of invasive disease caused by the pathogenic bacteria Streptococcus pneumoniae. It is believed that smoking increases the risk of these and other pulmonary and respiratory tract infections both through structural damage and through effects on the immune system. The effects on the immune system include an increase in CD4+ cell production attributable to nicotine, which has tentatively been linked to increased HIV susceptibility. Smoking increases the risk of Kaposi's sarcoma in people without HIV infection. One study found this only with the male population and could not draw any conclusions for the female participants in the study.  Impotence  The incidence of impotence (difficulty achieving and maintaining penile erection) is approximately 85 percent higher in male smokers compared to non-smokers. Smoking is a key cause of erectile dysfunction (ED). It causes impotence because it promotes arterial narrowing and damages cells lining the inside of the arteries thus leading to reduce penile blood flow.  Female infertility  Smoking is harmful to the ovaries, potentially causing female infertility, and the degree of damage is dependent upon the amount and length of time a woman smokes. Nicotine and other harmful chemicals in cigarettes interfere with the body's ability to create estrogen, a hormone that regulates folliculogenesis and ovulation. Also, cigarette smoking interferes with folliculogenesis, embryo transport, endometrial receptivity, endometrial angiogenesis, uterine blood flow and the uterine myometrium. Some damage is irreversible, but stopping smoking can prevent further damage.FERTILITY FACT > Female Risks By the American Society for Reproductive Medicine (ASRM). Retrieved on Jan 4, 2009 Smokers are 60% more likely to be infertile than non-smokers. Smoking reduces the chances of in-vitro fertilization (IVF) producing a live birth by 34% and increases the risk of an IVF pregnancy miscarrying by 30%.fertility services: a commissioning aid ‚Äì June 2009, from the Department of Health UK  Psychological  American Psychologist stated, \\"Smokers often report that cigarettes help relieve feelings of stress. However, the stress levels of adult smokers are slightly higher than those of nonsmokers, adolescent smokers report increasing levels of stress as they develop regular patterns of smoking, and smoking cessation leads to reduced stress. Far from acting as an aid for mood control, nicotine dependency seems to exacerbate stress. This is confirmed in the daily mood patterns described by smokers, with normal moods during smoking and worsening moods between cigarettes. Thus, the apparent relaxant effect of smoking only reflects the reversal of the tension and irritability that develop during nicotine depletion. Dependent smokers need nicotine to remain feeling normal.\\" = Immediate effects = Users report feelings of relaxation, sharpness, calmness, and alertness. Those new to smoking may experience nausea, dizziness, increased blood pressure, narrowed arteries, and rapid heart beat. Generally, the unpleasant symptoms will eventually vanish over time, with repeated use, as the body builds a tolerance to the chemicals in the cigarettes, such as nicotine. = Stress = Smokers report higher levels of everyday stress. Several studies have monitored feelings of stress over time and found reduced stress after quitting. The deleterious mood effects of abstinence explain why smokers suffer more daily stress than non-smokers and become less stressed when they quit smoking. Deprivation reversal also explains much of the arousal data, with deprived smokers being less vigilant and less alert than non-deprived smokers or non- smokers. Recent studies have shown a positive relationship between psychological distress and salivary cotinine levels in smoking and non-smoking adults, indicating that both firsthand and secondhand smoke exposure may lead to higher levels of mental stress. = Social and behavioral = Medical researchers have found that smoking is a predictor of divorce. Smokers have a 53% greater chance of divorce than nonsmokers. = Cognitive function = The usage of tobacco can also create cognitive dysfunction. There seems to be an increased risk of Alzheimer's disease, although \\"case‚Äìcontrol and cohort studies produce conflicting results as to the direction of the association between smoking and AD\\". Smoking has been found to contribute to dementia and cognitive decline, reduced memory and cognitive abilities in adolescents, and brain shrinkage (cerebral atrophy). Most notably, some studies have found that patients with Alzheimer's disease are more likely not to have smoked than the general population, which has been interpreted to suggest that smoking offers some protection against Alzheimer's. However, the research in this area is limited and the results are conflicting; some studies show that smoking increases the risk of Alzheimer's disease. A recent review of the available scientific literature concluded that the apparent decrease in Alzheimer risk may be simply because smokers tend to die before reaching the age at which Alzheimer normally occurs. \\"Differential mortality is always likely to be a problem where there is a need to investigate the effects of smoking in a disorder with very low incidence rates before age 75 years, which is the case of Alzheimer's disease,\\" it stated, noting that smokers are only half as likely as non-smokers to survive to the age of 80. Some older analyses have claimed that non-smokers are up to twice as likely as smokers to develop Alzheimer's disease. However, a more current analyse found that most of the studies, which showed a preventing effect, had a close affiliation to the tobacco industry. Researchers without tobacco lobby influence have concluded the complete opposite: Smokers are almost twice as likely as nonsmokers to develop Alzheimer's disease. Former and current smokers have a lower incidence of Parkinson's disease compared to people who have never smoked, although the authors stated that it was more likely that the movement disorders which are part of Parkinson's disease prevented people from being able to smoke than that smoking itself was protective. Another study considered a possible role of nicotine in reducing Parkinson's risk: nicotine stimulates the dopaminergic system of the brain, which is damaged in Parkinson's disease, while other compounds in tobacco smoke inhibit MAO-B, an enzyme which produces oxidative radicals by breaking down dopamine. In many respects, nicotine acts on the nervous system in a similar way to caffeine. Some writings have stated that smoking can also increase mental concentration; one study documents a significantly better performance on the normed Advanced Raven Progressive Matrices test after smoking. Most smokers, when denied access to nicotine, exhibit withdrawal symptoms such as irritability, jitteriness, dry mouth, and rapid heart beat. The onset of these symptoms is very fast, nicotine's half- life being only 2 hours. The psychological dependence may linger for months or even many years. Unlike some recreational drugs, nicotine does not measurably alter a smoker's motor skills, judgement, or language abilities while under the influence of the drug. Tobacco withdrawal has been shown to cause clinically significant distress. A very large percentage of schizophrenics smoke tobacco as a form of self-medication. The high rate of tobacco use by the mentally ill is a major factor in their decreased life expectancy, which is about 25 years shorter than the general population. Following the observation that smoking improves condition of people with schizophrenia, in particular working memory deficit, nicotine patches had been proposed as a way to treat schizophrenia. Some studies suggest that a link exists between smoking and mental illness, citing the high incidence of smoking amongst those suffering from schizophrenia and the possibility that smoking may alleviate some of the symptoms of mental illness, but these have not been conclusive. In 2015, a meta-analysis found that smokers were at greater risk of developing psychotic illness. Recent studies have linked smoking to anxiety disorders, suggesting the correlation (and possibly mechanism) may be related to the broad class of anxiety disorders, and not limited to just depression. Current and ongoing research attempt to explore the addiction-anxiety relationship. Data from multiple studies suggest that anxiety disorders and depression play a role in cigarette smoking. A history of regular smoking was observed more frequently among individuals who had experienced a major depressive disorder at some time in their lives than among individuals who had never experienced major depression or among individuals with no psychiatric diagnosis. People with major depression are also much less likely to quit due to the increased risk of experiencing mild to severe states of depression, including a major depressive episode. Depressed smokers appear to experience more withdrawal symptoms on quitting, are less likely to be successful at quitting, and are more likely to relapse.  Pregnancy  A number of studies have shown that tobacco use is a significant factor in miscarriages among pregnant smokers, and that it contributes to a number of other threats to the health of the fetus. It slightly increases the risk of neural tube defects. Environmental tobacco smoke exposure and maternal smoking during pregnancy have been shown to cause lower infant birth weights. Studies have shown an association between prenatal exposure to environmental tobacco smoke and conduct disorder in children. As well, post-natal tobacco smoke exposure may cause similar behavioral problems in children.  Drug interactions  Smoking is known to increase levels of liver enzymes that break down drugs and toxins. That means that drugs cleared by these enzymes are cleared more quickly in smokers, which may result in the drugs not working. Specifically, levels of CYP1A2 and CYP2A6 are induced: substrates for 1A2 include caffeine and tricyclic antidepressants such as amitriptyline; substrates for 2A6 include the anticonvulsant, valproic acid.  Multigenerational effects  Other harm  Protein AZGP1 Studies suggest that smoking decreases appetite, but did not conclude that overweight people should smoke or that their health would improve by smoking. This is also a cause of heart diseases. Smoking also decreases weight by overexpressing the gene AZGP1 which stimulates lipolysis. Smoking causes about 10% of the global burden of fire deaths, and smokers are placed at an increased risk of injury-related deaths in general, partly due to also experiencing an increased risk of dying in a motor vehicle crash. Smoking increases the risk of symptoms associated with Crohn's disease (a dose- dependent effect with use of greater than 15 cigarettes per day). There is some evidence for decreased rates of endometriosis in infertile smoking women, although other studies have found that smoking increases the risk in infertile women. There is little or no evidence of a protective effect in fertile women. Some preliminary data from 1996 suggested a reduced incidence of uterine fibroids, but overall the evidence is unconvincing. Current research shows that tobacco smokers who are exposed to residential radon are twice as likely to develop lung cancer as non-smokers. As well, the risk of developing lung cancer from asbestos exposure is twice as likely for smokers than for non- smokers. New research has found that women who smoke are at significantly increased risk of developing an abdominal aortic aneurysm, a condition in which a weak area of the abdominal aorta expands or bulges, and is the most common form of aortic aneurysm. Smoking leads to an increased risk of bone fractures, especially hip fractures. It also leads to slower wound-healing after surgery, and an increased rate of postoperative healing complication. Tobacco smokers are 30-40% more likely to develop type 2 diabetes than non- smokers, and the risk increases with the number of cigarettes smoked. Furthermore, diabetic smokers have worse outcomes than diabetic non-smokers.  Benefits  In addition to the numerous documented negative health effects of smoking, several types of \\"smoker's paradoxes\\" (cases where smoking appears to have specific beneficial effects) have been observed. Smoking may prevent Parkinson's disease.  Mechanism = Chemical carcinogens  Smoke, or any partially burnt organic matter, contains carcinogens (cancer- causing agents). The potential effects of smoking, such as lung cancer, can take up to 20 years to manifest themselves. Historically, women began smoking en masse later than men, so an increased death rate caused by smoking amongst women did not appear until later. The male lung cancer death rate decreased in 1975 ‚Äî roughly 20 years after the initial decline in cigarette consumption in men. A fall in consumption in women also began in 1975 but by 1991 had not manifested in a decrease in lung cancer-related mortalities amongst women. Smoke contains several carcinogenic pyrolytic products that bind to DNA and cause genetic mutations. Particularly potent carcinogens are polycyclic aromatic hydrocarbons (PAH), which are toxicated to mutagenic epoxides. The first PAH to be identified as a carcinogen in tobacco smoke was benzopyrene, which has been shown to toxicate into an epoxide that irreversibly attaches to a cell's nuclear DNA, which may either kill the cell or cause a genetic mutation. If the mutation inhibits programmed cell death, the cell can survive to become a cancer cell. Similarly, acrolein, which is abundant in tobacco smoke, also irreversibly binds to DNA, causes mutations and thus also cancer. However, it needs no activation to become carcinogenic. There are over 19 known carcinogens in cigarette smoke. The following are some of the most potent carcinogens: * Polycyclic aromatic hydrocarbons are tar components produced by pyrolysis in smoldering organic matter and emitted into smoke. Several of these PAH's are already toxic in their normal form, however, many of then can become more toxic to the liver. Due to the hydrophobic nature of PAH's they do not dissolve in water and are hard to expel from the body. In order to make the PAH more soluble in water, the liver creates an enzyme called Cytochrome P450 which adds an additional oxygen to the PAH, turning it into a mutagenic epoxides, which is more soluble, but also more reactive. The first PAH to be identified as a carcinogen in tobacco smoke was benzopyrene, which been shown to toxicate into a diol epoxide and then permanently attach to nuclear DNA, which may either kill the cell or cause a genetic mutation. The DNA contains the information on how the cell function; in practice, it contains the recipes for protein synthesis. If the mutation inhibits programmed cell death, the cell can survive to become a cancer, a cell that does not function like a normal cell. The carcinogenicity is radiomimetic, i.e. similar to that produced by ionizing nuclear radiation. Tobacco manufacturers have experimented with combustion less vaporizer technology to allow cigarettes to be consumed without the formation of carcinogenic benzopyrenes. Although such products have become increasingly popular, they still represent a very small fraction of the market, and no conclusive evidence has shown to prove or disprove the positive health claims. * Acrolein is a pyrolysis product that is abundant in cigarette smoke. It gives smoke an acrid smell and an irritating, tear causing effect and is a major contributor to its carcinogenicity. Like PAH metabolites, acrolein is also an electrophilic alkylating agent and permanently binds to the DNA base guanine, by a conjugate addition followed by cyclization into a hemiaminal. The acrolein-guanine adduct induces mutations during DNA copying and thus causes cancers in a manner similar to PAHs. However, acrolein is 1000 times more abundant than PAHs in cigarette smoke and is able to react as is, without metabolic activation. Acrolein has been shown to be a mutagen and carcinogen in human cells. The carcinogenicity of acrolein has been difficult to study by animal experimentation, because it has such a toxicity that it tends to kill the animals before they develop cancer. Generally, compounds able to react by conjugate addition as electrophiles (so-called Michael acceptors after Michael reaction) are toxic and carcinogenic, because they can permanently alkylate DNA, similarly to mustard gas or aflatoxin. Acrolein is only one of them present in cigarette smoke; for example, crotonaldehyde has been found in cigarette smoke. Michael acceptors also contribute to the chronic inflammation present in tobacco disease. * Nitrosamines are a group of carcinogenic compounds found in cigarette smoke but not in uncured tobacco leaves. Nitrosamines form on flue-cured tobacco leaves during the curing process through a chemical reaction between nicotine and other compounds contained in the uncured leaf and various oxides of nitrogen found in all combustion gasses. Switching to Indirect fire curing has been shown to reduce nitrosamine levels to less than 0.1 parts per million. Sidestream tobacco smoke, or exhaled mainstream smoke, is particularly harmful. Because exhaled smoke exists at lower temperatures than inhaled smoke, chemical compounds undergo changes which can cause them to become more dangerous. As well, smoke undergoes changes as it ages, which causes the transformation of the compound NO into the more toxic NO2. Further, volatilization causes smoke particles to become smaller, and thus more easily embedded deep into the lung of anyone who later breathes the air.  Radioactive carcinogens  In addition to chemical, nonradioactive carcinogens, tobacco and tobacco smoke contain small amounts of lead-210(210Pb) and polonium-210 (210Po) both of which are radioactive carcinogens. The presence of polonium-210 in mainstream cigarette smoke has been experimentally measured at levels of 0.0263‚Äì0.036 pCi (0.97‚Äì1.33 mBq), which is equivalent to about 0.1 pCi per milligram of smoke (4 mBq/mg); or about 0.81 pCi of lead-210 per gram of dry condensed smoke (30 Bq/kg). Research by NCAR radiochemist Ed Martell suggested that radioactive compounds in cigarette smoke are deposited in \\"hot spots\\" where bronchial tubes branch, that tar from cigarette smoke is resistant to dissolving in lung fluid and that radioactive compounds have a great deal of time to undergo radioactive decay before being cleared by natural processes. Indoors, these radioactive compounds can linger in secondhand smoke, and greater exposure would occur when these radioactive compounds are inhaled during normal breathing, which is deeper and longer than when inhaling cigarettes. Damage to the protective epithelial tissue from smoking only increases the prolonged retention of insoluble polonium-210 compounds produced from burning tobacco. Martell estimated that a carcinogenic radiation dose of 80‚Äì100 rads is delivered to the lung tissue of most smokers who die of lung cancer. Smoking an average of 1.5 packs per day gives a radiation dose of 60-160 mSv/year, compared with living near a nuclear power station (0.0001 mSv/year) or the 3.0 mSv/year average dose for Americans. Some of the mineral apatite in Florida used to produce phosphate for U.S.A. tobacco crops contains uranium, radium, lead-210 and polonium-210 and radon. The radioactive smoke from tobacco fertilized this way is deposited in lungs and releases radiation even if a smoker quits the habit. The combination of carcinogenic tar and radiation in a sensitive organ such as lungs increases the risk of cancer. In contrast, a 1999 review of tobacco smoke carcinogens published in the Journal of the National Cancer Institute states that \\"levels of polonium-210 in tobacco smoke are not believed to be great enough to significantly impact lung cancer in smokers.\\" In 2011 Hecht has also stated that the \\"levels of 210Po in cigarette smoke are probably too low to be involved in lung cancer induction ...\\"  Oxidation and inflammation  Free radicals and pro-oxidants in cigarettes damage blood vessels and oxidize LDL cholesterol. Only oxidized LDL cholesterol is taken-up by macrophages, which become foam cells, leading to atherosclerotic plaques. Cigarette smoke increases proinflammatory cytokines in the bloodstream, causing atherosclerosis. The pro-oxidative state also leads to endothelial dysfunction, which is another important cause of atherosclerosis.  Nicotine  Nicotine molecule Nicotine, which is contained in cigarettes and other smoked tobacco products, is a stimulant and is one of the main factors leading to continued tobacco smoking. Nicotine is a highly addictive psychoactive chemical. When tobacco is smoked, most of the nicotine is pyrolyzed; a dose sufficient to cause mild somatic dependency and mild to strong psychological dependency remains. The amount of nicotine absorbed by the body from smoking depends on many factors, including the type of tobacco, whether the smoke is inhaled, and whether a filter is used. There is also a formation of harmane (a MAO inhibitor) from the acetaldehyde in cigarette smoke, which seems to play an important role in nicotine addiction probably by facilitating dopamine release in the nucleus accumbens in response to nicotine stimuli. According to studies by Henningfield and Benowitz, nicotine is more addictive than cannabis, caffeine, ethanol, cocaine, and heroin when considering both somatic and psychological dependence. However, due to the stronger withdrawal effects of ethanol, cocaine and heroin, nicotine may have a lower potential for somatic dependence than these substances. About half of Canadians who currently smoke have tried to quit. McGill University health professor Jennifer O'Loughlin stated that nicotine addiction can occur as soon as five months after the start of smoking. Ingesting a compound by smoking is one of the most rapid and efficient methods of introducing it into the bloodstream, second only to injection, which allows for the rapid feedback which supports the smokers' ability to titrate their dosage. On average it takes about ten seconds for the substance to reach the brain. As a result of the efficiency of this delivery system, many smokers feel as though they are unable to cease. Of those who attempt cessation and last three months without succumbing to nicotine, most are able to remain smoke-free for the rest of their lives. There exists a possibility of depression in some who attempt cessation, as with other psychoactive substances. Depression is also common in teenage smokers; teens who smoke are four times as likely to develop depressive symptoms as their nonsmoking peers. Although nicotine does play a role in acute episodes of some diseases (including stroke, impotence, and heart disease) by its stimulation of adrenaline release, which raises blood pressure, heart and respiration rate, and free fatty acids, the most serious longer term effects are more the result of the products of the smouldering combustion process. This has led to the development of various nicotine delivery systems, such as the nicotine patch or nicotine gum, that can satisfy the addictive craving by delivering nicotine without the harmful combustion by-products. This can help the heavily dependent smoker to quit gradually, while discontinuing further damage to health. Recent evidence has shown that smoking tobacco increases the release of dopamine in the brain, specifically in the mesolimbic pathway, the same neuro-reward circuit activated by drugs of abuse such as heroin and cocaine. This suggests nicotine use has a pleasurable effect that triggers positive reinforcement. One study found that smokers exhibit better reaction-time and memory performance compared to non-smokers, which is consistent with increased activation of dopamine receptors. Neurologically, rodent studies have found that nicotine self-administration causes lowering of reward thresholds‚Äîa finding opposite that of most other drugs of abuse (e.g. cocaine and heroin). The carcinogenity of tobacco smoke is not explained by nicotine per se, which is not carcinogenic or mutagenic, although it is a metabolic precursor for several compounds which are. In addition, it inhibits apoptosis, therefore accelerating existing cancers. Also, NNK, a nicotine derivative converted from nicotine, can be carcinogenic. It is worth noting that nicotine, although frequently implicated in producing tobacco addiction, is not significantly addictive when administered alone. The addictive potential manifests itself after co-administration of an MAOI, which specifically causes sensitization of the locomotor response in rats, a measure of addictive potential.  Forms of exposure = Second-hand smoke  Posted sign to avoid passive smoking in York University, Toronto, Ontario, Canada Second-hand smoke is a mixture of smoke from the burning end of a cigarette, pipe or cigar, and the smoke exhaled from the lungs of smokers. It is involuntarily inhaled, lingers in the air hours after cigarettes have been extinguished, and may cause a wide range of adverse health effects, including cancer, respiratory infections and asthma. Non-smokers who are exposed to second-hand smoke at home or work are thought, due to a wide variety of statistical studies, to increase their heart disease risk by 25‚Äì30% and their lung cancer risk by 20‚Äì30%. Second-hand smoke has been estimated to cause 38,000 deaths per year, of which 3,400 are deaths from lung cancer in non-smokers. The current US Surgeon General's Report concludes that there is no established risk-free level of exposure to second- hand smoke. Short exposures to second-hand smoke are believed to cause blood platelets to become stickier, damage the lining of blood vessels, decrease coronary flow velocity reserves, and reduce heart rate variability, potentially increasing the risk of heart attack. New research indicates that private research conducted by cigarette company Philip Morris in the 1980s showed that second-hand smoke was toxic, yet the company suppressed the finding during the next two decades.  Chewing tobacco  Chewing tobacco has been known to cause cancer, particularly of the mouth and throat. According to the International Agency for Research on Cancer, \\"Some health scientists have suggested that smokeless tobacco should be used in smoking cessation programmes and have made implicit or explicit claims that its use would partly reduce the exposure of smokers to carcinogens and the risk for cancer. These claims, however, are not supported by the available evidence.\\" Oral and spit tobacco increase the risk for leukoplakia, a precursor to oral cancer.  Cigars  Like other forms of smoking, cigar smoking poses a significant health risk depending on dosage: risks are greater for those who inhale more when they smoke, smoke more cigars, or smoke them longer. The risk of dying from any cause is significantly greater for cigar smokers, with the risk particularly higher for smokers less than 65 years old, and with risk for moderate and deep inhalers reaching levels similar to cigarette smokers. The increased risk for those smoking 1‚Äì2 cigars per day is too small to be statistically significant, and the health risks of the 3/4 of cigar smokers who smoke less than daily are not known and are hard to measure. Although it has been claimed that people who smoke few cigars have no increased risk, a more accurate statement is that their risks are proportionate to their exposure. Health risks are similar to cigarette smoking in nicotine addiction, periodontal health, tooth loss, and many types of cancer, including cancers of the mouth, throat, and esophagus. Cigar smoking also can cause cancers of the lung and larynx, where the increased risk is less than that of cigarettes. Many of these cancers have extremely low cure rates. Cigar smoking also increases the risk of lung and heart diseases such as chronic obstructive pulmonary disease.  Hookahs  A common belief among users is that the smoke of a hookah (waterpipe, narghile) is significantly less dangerous than that from cigarettes. The water moisture induced by the hookah makes the smoke less irritating and may give a false sense of security and reduce concerns about true health effects. Doctors at institutions including the Mayo Clinic have stated that use of hookah can be as detrimental to a person's health as smoking cigarettes, and a study by the World Health Organization also confirmed these findings. Each hookah session typically lasts more than 40 minutes, and consists of 50 to 200 inhalations that each range from 0.15 to 0.50 liters of smoke. In an hour-long smoking session of hookah, users consume about 100 to 200 times the smoke of a single cigarette; A study in the Journal of Periodontology found that water pipe smokers were marginally more likely than regular smokers to show signs of gum disease, showing rates 5-fold higher than non-smokers rather than the 3.8-fold risk that regular smokers show. According to USA Today, people who smoked water pipes had five times the risk of lung cancer of non-smokers. A study on hookah smoking and cancer in Pakistan was published in 2008. Its objective was \\"to find serum CEA levels in ever/exclusive hookah smokers, i.e. those who smoked only hookah (no cigarettes, bidis, etc.), prepared between 1 and 4 times a day with a quantity of up to 120 g of a tobacco-molasses mixture each (i.e. the tobacco weight equivalent of up to 60 cigarettes of 1 g each) and consumed in 1 to 8 sessions\\". Carcinoembryonic antigen (CEA) is a marker found in several forms of cancer. Levels in exclusive hookah smokers were lower compared to cigarette smokers although the difference was not as statistically significant as that between a hookah smoker and a non-smoker. Also, the study concluded that heavy hookah smoking (2‚Äì4 daily preparations; 3‚Äì8 sessions a day; >2 hrs to ‚â§ 6 hours) substantially raises CEA levels. Hookah smokers were nearly 6 times more likely to develop lung cancer as compared to healthy non-smokers in Kashmir (India).  Dipping tobacco  Dipping tobacco, commonly referred to as snuff, is also put in the mouth, but it is a flavored powder. it is placed between the cheek and gum. Dipping tobacco does not need to be chewed for the nicotine to be absorbed. First-time users of these products often become nauseated and dizzy. Long-term effects include bad breath, yellowed teeth, and an increased risk of oral cancer. Users of dipping tobacco are believed to face less risk of some cancers than are smokers, but are still at greater risk than people who do not use any tobacco products. They also have an equal risk of other health problems directly linked to nicotine, such as increased rate of atherosclerosis.  Prevention  Education and counselling by physicians of children and adolescents have been found to be effective in decreasing tobacco use.

Smoking has therefore been studied more extensively than any other form of tobacco consumption. In 2000, smoking was practiced by 1.22 billion people, predicted to rise to 1.45 billion people in 2010 and 1.5 to 1.9 billion by 2025. If prevalence had decreased by 2% a year since 2000 this figure would have been 1.3 billion in 2010 and 2025. Despite dropping by 0.4 percent from 2009 to 2010, the United States still reports an average of 17.9 percent usage. As of 2002, about twenty percent of young teens (13‚Äì15) smoked worldwide, with 80,000 to 100,000 children taking up the addiction every day, roughly half of whom live in Asia. Half of those who begin smoking in adolescent years are projected to go on to smoke for 15 to 20 years. Teens are more likely to use e-cigarettes than cigarettes. About 31% of teenagers who use e-cigs started smoking within 6 months, compared to 8% of non-smokers. Manufacturers don't have to report what is in e-cigs, and most teens either say its just flavoring, or don't know. The WHO states that \\"Much of the disease burden and premature mortality attributable to tobacco use disproportionately affect the poor\\". Of the 1.22 billion smokers, 1 billion live in developing or transitional nations. Rates of smoking have leveled off or declined in the developed world. In the developing world, however, tobacco consumption was rising by 3.4% per year as of 2002. The WHO in 2004 projected 58.8 million deaths to occur globally, from which 5.4 million are tobacco-attributed, and 4.9 million as of 2007. As of 2002, 70% of the deaths are in developing countries. The shift in prevalence of tobacco smoking to a younger demographic, mainly in the developing world, can be attributed to several factors. The tobacco industry spends up to $12.5 billion annually on advertising, which is increasingly geared towards adolescents in the developing world because they are a very vulnerable audience for the marketing campaigns. Adolescents have more difficulty understanding the long-term health risks that are associated with smoking and are also more easily influenced by \\"images of romance, success, sophistication, popularity, and adventure which advertising suggests they could achieve through the consumption of cigarettes\\". This shift in marketing towards adolescents and even children in the tobacco industry is debilitating to organizations' and countries' efforts to improve child health and mortality in the developing world. It reverses or halts the effects of the work that has been done to improve health care in these countries, and although smoking is deemed as a \\"voluntary\\" health risk, the marketing of tobacco towards very impressionable adolescents in the developing world makes it less of a voluntary action and more of an inevitable shift. Many government regulations have been passed to protect citizens from harm caused by public environmental tobacco smoke. The \\"Pro-Children Act of 2001\\" prohibits smoking within any facility that provides health care, day care, library services, or elementary and secondary education to children in the US.Elementary and Secondary Education  Environmental Tobacco Smoke  Pro-Children Act of 2001  Non- Smoking Policy for Children‚Äôs Services  Section 4303 On May 23, 2011, New York City enforced a smoking ban for all parks, beaches, and pedestrian malls in an attempt to eliminate threats posed to civilians by environmental tobacco smoke.

Besides documents, photos, paintings and tools the exhibits are mainly bronze maquettes and casts of Van Wouw's sculptural work. Anton van Wouw (1862‚Äì1945) Anton van Wouw was born in Driebergen, near Utrecht in the Netherlands on 26 December 1862. He had a thorough training in academic sculpture in Europe, initially through evening classes at the Rotterdam Academie under the guidance of the Flemish architect and artist, Vieillevoye, but later also in the studio of the Belgian sculptor, Joseph Graven (1836‚Äì1877). During his student days he undertook visits to Brussels and Paris to view the galleries there. The experience which he gained early in his life as a stucco-worker had a definite influence on his preference for the art of modelling. African Studies by Anton Van Wouw Anton van Wouw Museum Anton van Wouw in Rome, c. 1896‚Äì1899 When Anton van Wouw arrived in South Africa from the Netherlands, he was twenty-eight years old. Here he met the indigenous people of the country for the first time. His rendering of Africans shows a perceptual awareness. Not only does Van Wouw show the anatomical characteristics of the African, but he created these studies of the indigenous people with dignity and understanding. Spirit and culture come to the fore in these works. Van Wouw modelled from life and his subjects are shown in different moods and situations. A serene and pensive mood is evident in his bronze sculpture, entitled The Thinker (1935). With his chin resting on his hand, the subject seems unaware of the world around him, lost in his own thoughts. A happy and joyful mood is created in the bronze work The Laughing Basutu (1936). With his arms folded over his chest and head turned to the right, the subject seems happy and lively. The play of light on the features adds to the liveliness of the work. In the bronze work The Shangaan (1907) we see a reserved person. He looks slightly down, the brow is furrowed and arms tightly crossed over his chest as if he is cutting himself off from the onlooker. In The Sleeping African of 1907, the subject is totally relaxed, fast asleep with mouth open and head slightly tilted to the right. The arms are lightly folded. In contrast to this work, The Shangaan seems tense and worried. Calmness, serenity and almost a regal element are present in Zulu (1907). A striking contrast is evident in the texture of hair and beard, as well as the smooth skin. The man seems undisturbed by trivialities. He looks ahead with eyes cast slightly down, proud to be a Zulu. Van Wouw created the African in his everyday activities as seen in The Hammer Worker (1911). The worker is busy hammering at a rock and is almost encircled by rock. The figure seems to ‚Äògrow‚Äô out of the rock. The Skapu Player (1907) shows the African in a seated position relaxing while he plays his music. The Mieliepap Eater (1907) shows the African preparing his food in a typical pose. He sits stirring his food in the three-legged pot. The Hunter Drinking (1907) shows the lithe body as nature‚Äôs child. The same horizontal composition is present in The Dagga Smoker (1907). With dignity and respect, Van Wouw sculptured King Khama, head of the Bamangwatu. The wise old man stares ahead with tired eyes. Old age and experience are evident in this work of Van Wouw. The model for The Bushman Hunter was well known to Van Wouw. He actually worked for Van Wouw who studied his build and movements. Van Wouw often played bow and arrow games with him. His understanding of the small Bushman is quite evident in this work. History of the Van Wouw House The Van Wouw House, now the property of the University of Pretoria, was the last home and studio of the sculptor Anton van Wouw (1862-1945). The stand on which the house was built initially belonged to a Mr J Brookes. The stand changed ownership three times and was sold to Van Wouw in 1937. He commissioned the architect Norman Eaton to build a house for him on the southern property. The Van Wouw House, which was completed in 1938, shows the personal style that Norman Eaton had already developed at the time. The house was designed both as residence and studio. The unity between the building and the environment is conspicuous. Van Wouw was a great lover of nature and a keen gardener and commissioned Eaton to design a residence with an affinity between architecture and nature. An ornamental pool, and later on a lush garden, contributed to this link between home and nature. The house itself was built with face brick, has a thatch roof and wooden window frames with shutters. Terracotta tiles and wooden floors add further to its charm. The sound of water in the fishpond, climbing plants and lush gardens link the dwelling to the surrounding landscape. From the large south-facing veranda, one has a lovely view to the south. Van Wouw moved into his new home early in 1939 and lived there until his death on 30 June 1945. Professor and Mrs S F Oosthuizen of the University of Pretoria then occupied the house until 1973. During the 25th Annual General Meeting of the Rembrandt Group on 16 November 1973, Dr Anton Rupert announced that a sum of money equal to the selling price of the property had been given to the University of Pretoria to purchase the Van Wouw House. Through this gesture, this valuable and exceptional house became the property of the University. Dr Rupert officially handed over the house to the University on 21 May 1974.

Biography Van Wouw decided to move to the developing city of Pretoria at the age of 28 and waited for ten years to receive his first commission. This was from financier Sammy Marks to create a monumental statue of Paul Kruger, which stands on Church Square. During his time spent in the wilderness he developed a great admiration for the Boer nation. This also influenced his artistic development a great deal. He identified with the struggles and hopes of these people and this commitment was reflected in his work. Anton van Wouw House, Pretoria A great deal of his work, although representational, captures the rugged and emotional essence of his subjects. One of his most notable pieces of work is the figure of a woman used in the Women‚Äôs Monument near Bloemfontein. He collaborated on this with the architect Frans Soff. He was also responsible for the less successful figure of a woman incorporated into the Voortrekker Monument near Pretoria, a powerful bust of General Christiaan de Wet and the statue of Louis Botha in Durban. He also portrayed indigenous peoples and among these smaller sculptures some of his finest work can be found. They are much less formal than his larger work and are appealing in their vivid and lifelike facial expressions. Works Woman and Children, completed in 1938. This bronze statue honouring the role the Voortrekker women played in the Great Trek was van Wouw's last commission. The sculpture is located at the base of the Voortrekker Monument in Pretoria, stands 4.1 meter tall and weights 2.5 ton. The casting was done by Renzo Vignali in Pretoria.

It is a single-stage liquid fuel missile system and a longer ranged variant of the Ghauri-I. The development of Ghauri-II took place in a direct response to India's Agni II. It was developed by increasing the length of the motor assembly and using improved propellants.Missiles of the World Pakistan‚Äôs Long Range Ballistic Missiles: A View From IDEAS The Ghauri‚ÄìII enjoyed distinction of being Pakistan's longest range missile until its limit was exceeded by the successful launch of the Shaheen-II which was tested in 2004. Design The Ghauri-II missile has a maximum range of . It is 18.0 m in length, has a diameter of 1.35 m and a launch weight of 17,800 kg. Its payload is a single separating warhead weighing 1,200 kg, or as low as 750 kg for use at its maximum range. This may used to carry a 250 kg warhead of a 15 to 30 kt yield nuclear, HE or sub-munition warhead. The missile uses a single-stage liquid propellant rocket motor. The Ghauri-II design improves accuracy by an employing mechanisms that spin the single booster stage and warhead combination approximately 10 seconds before the termination of the powered flight phase at 110 seconds.Federation of American Scientists At this point, the warhead is then separated from the booster stage to fly on a re-entry trajectory that remains stable to its target, greatly enhancing the missile's accuracy. With the addition of GPS targeting the warhead accuracy is further enhanced. Like most Pakistani missile systems, transporter erector launcher (TEL) vehicles are used to transport and launch Ghauri II. Developments and tests The development of Ghauri-II took place in 1993 at the Khan Research Laboratories (KRL) after the government issued orders and released funds for it. After heavy reengineering and subsequent reverse engineering led the improvements of Ghauri-II, and synergizing expertise from various strategic organizations allowed the Ghauri project to continue into Ghauri II and III missiles, whose ranges were intended to reach more deeply into India. Unlike Ghauri-I, the development on the second variant was kept extremely secretive and very few officials, including its chief designer, knew about the existence of the program. The Ghauri-II was launched in a direct response to India's development on Agni-II and the project took place at the KRL. The development on Ghauri-II remains extremely secretive and very few details were made to public in 1999. On 11 April 1999, India announced to the hold the tests for the Agni-II, prompting Pakistan's reaction. On 14 April 1999, the Ghauri-II was test fired from a Tilla-Jagun Test Range. Pakistani news media inccorrectly broadcast the news that it was a re-test of the Ghauri-I; this was contradicted by Prime Minister Nawaz Sharif on 14 April 1999. The Ghauri- II was launched at 1035hrs local time (0535 GMT) and its spaceflight hit a target 1150km away near the coastal town of Jiwani on the Balochistan coast. The test was described as \\"successful\\", and the missile had taken the spaceflight more than 620mi (997.93 km) in 12 minutes after being fired from a site in the central province of Punjab. The Ghauri-II enjoyed its distinction of being the longest range missile in service with Pakistan military, until its limit was exceeded by the successful launch of the Shaheen-II in 2004.

The song was a staple of live shows from the 1987‚Äì89 world tours in support of A Momentary Lapse of Reason and was one of the songs in rotation during the 1994 tour in support of The Division Bell. The song was resurrected by David Gilmour on his 2006 On an Island Tour for one night only. Live recordings exist on Delicate Sound of Thunder (1988) and Live in Gdansk (2008). Music and lyrics The song has often been described as a protest song and is one of the more political tracks Pink Floyd released after the departure of Roger Waters. The main concept came from Anthony Moore, but David Gilmour has stated that he re-wrote the last verse of both \\"On the Turning Away\\" and \\"Learning to Fly\\". Musically, it has been called a power ballad. Guy Pratt has said about its musical structure (referring to the fact that he had to guide Phil Manzanera and Steve DiStanislao through a completely unplanned performance of it in 2006: \\"The song only has five chords in it, but they don't necessarily show up where you think they will.\\" It has also been noted for being one of Pink Floyd's rhythmically most complex songs, constantly alternating between various time signatures. Some reviewers have described it as Celtic sounding. Release Released as the second single from the album, it reached number one on the Billboard Album Rock Tracks chart in early 1988. In the United Kingdom, the song charted at number 55 on the UK Singles Chart. Video The music video for the track featured a live recording and concert footage filmed during the band's three night run at The Omni in Atlanta, Georgia in November 1987 directed by Lawrence Jordan (who has directed concert films for Rush, Mariah Carey, and Billy Joel). Promotional videos for \\"The Dogs of War\\" and \\"One Slip\\" also used footage of this concert. The video made it to number nine on MTV's Video Countdown in January 1988.

This type of contest is controversial because it often leads to massive amounts of link spamming as participants try to boost the rankings of their pages by any means available. The organizing body of a SEO competition may hold the activity without promotion of a product or service in mind; or they may organize a contest in order to market something on the Internet. Participants can showcase their skills and potentially discover and share new techniques for promoting websites. History= Early 00s Contests  The first recorded SEO Contest was Schnitzelmitkartoffelsalat by German webmasters, started on November 15, 2002, in the German-language usenet group de.comm.infosystems.www.authoring.misc.Message-ID In the English-language world, the nigritude ultramarine competition created by DarkBlue.com and run by SearchGuild is widely acclaimed as the mother of all SEO contests. It was started on May 7, 2004, and was won two months later by Anil Dash. On September 1 of the same year, webmasters were challenged to rank number 1 on Google in three months' time for the search phrase seraphim proudleduck. In the first quarter of 2005, people were competing for the term loquine glupe, spawning web sites ranging from shampoo advertising to holiday resorts. The page that won in the end looked rather boring, and used many questionable techniques like \\"keyword stuffing\\" and \\"domain age\\". Internationally, in 2005, two major contests took place in Europe. In Germany the Hommingberger Gepardenforelle (, literally Cheetah Trout of Hommingberg, but neither the fish nor the place actually exist) by the computer magazine c't spawned almost 4 million results; its goal was to find out how search engines rank sites. In Poland almost at same time the Polish SEO community organized the msnbetter thangoogle contest. It topped the 4 million but failed to reach its goal to promote SEO in Poland and to get search engines companies' attention for the Polish market. Some current and pending contests are listed below. A competition ran from January 1, 2006, to March 1, 2006, and carried the term redscowl bluesingsky, another set of made-up words. It was sponsored by SEOLogs. Shoemoney won this contest, and since he contributed the winner's money, he donated it to the runnerup. Since then, SEO contests have become a part of some academic classes. In 2008 Luis von Ahn at Carnegie Mellon University created a contest for his students. In 2010 Adam Wierman picked it up at Caltech.  2010s: Corporate SEO Contests  Recently, web development companies such as Wix have run SEO competitions. The most recent of these is set to end in December 2019 with two SEO agencies trying to rank for the term \\"Wix SEO\\". One agency is using a Wix site, and the other using a site of their choice. The contest resulted in Marie Haynes Consulting Inc, an SEO agency from Ottawa Canada, winning the $25,000 prize . Tactics Some webmasters resort to spam, while others use white-hat optimization techniques, like providing good content covering the competition, or optimizing page titles. Most SEO contests expect people to optimize a single web page for a non- existent phrase of two silly words. This is to keep existing web sites from getting a head start and to make sure that regular internet searchers will not be shown contest pages when searching the web for other information. Rules and limitations can make it harder to benefit from the ranking algorithm of the targeted search engine. The January 2006 Redscowl Bluesingsky contest issued by seologs.com was open for domains created after the start of the competition only. This meant that the contestants could not benefit from the ranking advantage old web sites have over new ones. Also, it was expected that the Redscowl Bluesingsky game would be won by a domain made up entirely of the search words, such as \\"redscowl-bluesingsky.com\\", which would attract natural links and be likely to benefit from the simplicity of the URL. Another special rule that fits well with the \\"purpose\\" of SEO contests today is the obligation to \\"link back\\" to the organizing body, often a search engine optimization site. Since a web document's ranking on major search engines like Yahoo!, Google, or MSN Search is mainly determined by internet hyperlinks pointing to that document, forcing webmasters to link to a web site is quite a powerful way to increase its web presence. A good example is the contest announced by V7N (using the phrase v7ndotcom elursrebmem) and its counterpart by WebGuerrilla. While the first of these originally required the contestants to link to V7N forums, the second forbids its players to do just that. Instead, a special link to Google engineer Matt Cutts' blog is imperative. Because of this rivalry, both the rules and prize money on both these SEO contests were updated regularly up until the official start date on January 15, 2006.

Facts Daniel's debut album is the first of its kind for a Malaysian Chinese singer, consisting of songs in 3 languages widely spoken in Malaysia. The first 8 songs are in Mandarin, while the 9th and last songs are in English and Malay respectively. It is believed to be the very first Mandarin album to include romanized Pinyin lyrics for those whose native tongue is not Mandarin. Fly È£õ is the Mandarin version of the last and only Malay song in the album, Mimpi. The latter song was sung by Daniel himself during the Grand Finale of Malaysian Idol 2. Heaven Knows is an existing English song sung by Rick Price. It is also one of the three songs sung by Daniel during the Grand Finale of Malaysian Idol 2, aside Mimpi and Angin Malam (Angin Malam is recorded in Danell's 2nd album Unavoidable Ë∫≤‰∏çÈÅé.

It is a Latin word. The agger was an embankment that gave Roman roads the proper draining base. Basically the agger is a ridge that supports the road surface. The agger was constructed by excavating the line of the road, building a firm foundation, refilling and compressing the soil, adding more soil from digging drainage ditches or fosses on one or both sides of the road, then surfacing with graded layers of stone and cobbles. The material used to build the aggers was dug from lateral ditches. Once the material was dug out of the ditches that were known as \\"scoop ditches,\\" they were used as the storm drain for that road. These ditches could also be used for soldiers to hide in if they ever were under attack from enemies. On the most important road routes, the agger could be high and wide. Along less important routes the road is occasionally set directly on the levelled ground surface with stones laid to provide drainage with the lateral ditches barely visible. The material was usually found locally, though the Romans would not hesitate to bring in the material from other places if they could find no suitable stone. The course of a Roman road can often be traced today by the distinctive line of the agger across the landscape.Ivan Margary, Roman Roads in Britain, John Baker 1973, 3rd ed. Introduction pp 18-22 A well-known example is the Agger Servianus, a part of the Servian walls of Rome, which protected the city on its most vulnerable side, the Campus Esquilinus. It consisted of a double rampart bearing formidable fortifications.

Shulman calls select Toronto Blue Jays telecasts on Sportsnet and hosts a baseball-themed podcast, Swing and a Belt with Dan Shulman. He also serves as a play-by-play announcer for ESPN's men's college basketball coverage (with Jay Bilas), select regular season Major League Baseball games, and post-season MLB coverage on ESPN Radio. Previously, Shulman served as the play-by-play announcer for ESPN's Sunday Night Baseball (with Aaron Boone and Jessica Mendoza), a position he resigned from at the conclusion of the 2017 season. Education Born in Toronto, Ontario, Shulman graduated from the University of Western Ontario in actuarial science but moved into a career in sports broadcasting. Broadcasting career=Early career Shulman began his broadcasting career at the University of Western Ontario, becoming a main voice of university football and basketball for the Western Mustangs on CHRW radio in London, Ontario, and later at radio station CKBB in Barrie, where he volunteered for the local community television station. During the early 1990s, he was hired by the Fan 1430 (a sports radio station in Toronto now known as Sportsnet 590 The Fan) and would go on to host Prime Time Sports. He worked for CTV in its coverage of the 1994 Winter Olympics from Lillehammer, Norway, covering hockey, and the 1994 World Championships of Basketball. TSN In 1995, he became the play-by-play voice on TSN for their broadcasts of Toronto Blue Jays baseball games alongside former Blue Jays catcher Buck Martinez. Shulman remained with the network for seven years, during which time he also worked as the network's secondary play-by-play voice for NHL hockey and lead announcer for NBA basketball. He also covered CHL games and backed up host Dave Hodge on TSN Inside Sports. Until 2007, Shulman continued to work with Buck Martinez for TSN during the World Series, filing daily reports. In 2011, he returned to TSN as an analyst and contributor. ESPN Shulman began working part-time for ESPN while still employed by TSN. In 2001, he moved to ESPN full-time to cover sporting events like baseball and college basketball. ESPN signed Shulman to a five-year contract extension in 2007 and assigned him to call NBA games for the network. Shulman remains the network's lead announcer for NCAA basketball. On July 27, 2007, Shulman called Barry Bonds's 754th home run for ESPN. From 2002 to 2007, he served as the lead play-by-play announcer for ESPN Radio's MLB coverage, teaming with Dave Campbell to call the network's Sunday Night Baseball broadcasts as well as the All-Star Game, Home Run Derby, and select postseason games. In 2008, Gary Thorne succeeded Shulman as the lead Sunday Night Baseball voice; however, Shulman once again teamed with Campbell to call that year's All-Star and postseason events and continued to fill in on occasional regular season broadcasts. Shulman also teamed with Orel Hershiser to call Monday Night Baseball for ESPN television from 2008 to 2010 and with Hubie Brown to call ESPN NBA coverage from 2007 to 2012. On December 1, 2010, Shulman, Hershiser, and Bobby Valentine were named as ESPN's new Sunday Night Baseball crew for the 2011 MLB season. During the Sunday Night Baseball telecast between the New York Mets and Philadelphia Phillies on May 1, 2011, Shulman announced live to the ESPN audience that Osama bin Laden had died, a moment that has been compared to Howard Cosell's report of John Lennon's assassination on Monday Night Football in 1980. Shulman told USA Today that he had learned of bin Laden's death from Valentine, who himself received the news via text. \\"I talked to the producer in the truck and asked if they knew what was going on. Or maybe they asked me,\\" said Shulman. \\"I couldn't just say something on-air because of a text, I needed corroboration. It all happened in about 30 seconds.\\" Shulman also teamed with Orel Hershiser and Bobby Valentine for the ESPN Radio broadcast of the 2011 World Series won in 7 games by the St. Louis Cardinals over the Texas Rangers. That same year, he teamed with Dick Vitale for the broadcast of the Indiana‚ÄìKentucky rivalry on December 10, 2011. His call for the game-winning three-pointer by Christian Watford was \\"Jones... Watford for the win‚Ä¶ YES! YES!\\" with Vitale screaming \\"Unbelievable!\\" shortly after. Shulman was named 2011 National Sportscaster of the Year by the National Sportscasters and Sportswriters Association, the first Canadian-born announcer to be so honoured. On July 3, 2017, Shulman announced in a Sports Illustrated interview that he would step down from Sunday Night Baseball at the conclusion of the 2017 season, seeking to adjust his role at ESPN so he could spend more time with his family in Toronto. He will still participate in ESPN Radio coverage of the MLB postseason, and ESPN's college basketball coverage. Sportsnet In addition to his continued work with ESPN, on November 19, 2015, Shulman announced he would be joining the Sportsnet broadcast team for upwards of 30 Toronto Blue Jays games during the 2016 and 2017 seasons. In March 2018 it was announced that he would be joining the Sportsnet Radio network for select Blue Jays games, in addition to calling up to 50 games on Sportsnet television. In April 2018, Shulman teamed up with Sportsnet to air the podcast Swing and a Belt with Dan Shulman where every week, he covers a different topic related to baseball and interviews different people such as Mike Trout and Aaron Boone. Personal life Shulman is Jewish and has participated in the Maccabiah Games. Shulman had three sons with his wife, Sarah; the couple has since divorced. In July 2017, he announced that he was ending his Sunday Night Baseball duties in part due to his remarriage.

It was the site of many extravagant buildings as well as baths and gardens. The Campus Esquilinus was also the site of executions and burials, though it was eventually turned into a park by Augustus.  Location  The Campus Esquilinus was the area of flat ground outside the Servian Walls and the double rampart of the Agger, between the Querquetulan Gate and the Colline gate. The name referred in particular to the area of the Esquiline Hill that lay outside the portas Esquilina during the end of the Republic and the rise of the Empire. Though its exact location is not known, it is likely that the Campus Esquilinus was located in via Labicana, and included present day Piazza Vittorio Emanuele and the area north of it.Platner, Samuel Ball. ‚ÄúCampus Esquilinus.‚Äù A Topographical Dictionary of Ancient Rome. Completed and revised by Thomas Ashby. London: Oxford University Press, 1929. The part of the Esquiline Hill that contained the Campus Esquilinus was very decorative. The hill itself was covered with many elegant gardens, including the Horti Pallantiani, Horti Maecenatis and Horti Lamiani. Along with gardens, the hill was also the site of many lavish buildings.Bunson, Matthew.\\"Mons Esquilinus.\\" Encyclopedia of the Roman Empire. New York NY: Facts on File, Inc., 1994.  Structures  During the Great Roman Fire of 64 AD, the imperial residence on the Palatine Hill, the Domus Transitoria, burned down. The emperor Nero, who never enjoyed the Domus Transitoria, took this opportunity to construct his elaborate Golden House (Domus Aurea), which was completed in 68 AD and stretched from the Palatine Hill to the Esquiline Hill. Because of the popularity of the Esquiline Hill, the Flavians decided to construct the Baths of Titus right by the Domus Aurea. Later, from 104-109 AD, the even more elaborate Baths of Trajan were built by the architect Apollodorus atop the hill. These public baths were not only used as a place for bathing, but also as a location for social gatherings. The baths contained much of the Domus Aurea, and together they were the largest Roman structures built at the time..  Functions  The main purpose of the Campus Esquilinus was as a burial site. A praetor's edict forbade cremation of bodies and dumping of manure or carcasses within the area of the Campus Esquilinus.(The carcasses mentioned in the edict were most likely from animals used for chariots, various Roman games, or simply wild beasts.\\"Notes On Supplementary Plates CV-CVIII.\\" Greece & Rome 20 (1951): 95-97. JSTOR.) Because of these rules, the Campus Esquilinus became a location for human burials. The Campus Esquilinus contained part of early Rome's necropolis, which was mainly a place of burial for paupers, but was a burial site for wealthier Romans as well. Executions also took place at the Campus Esquilinus. Eventually though, the emperor Augustus took control of the Campus Esquilinus and remade it as a park.

When lactogenesis occurs, under the influence of hormones, the milk is moved to the nipple by the action of smooth muscle contractions along the ductal system to the tip of the nipple. They are also referred to as galactophores, galactophorous ducts, mammary ducts, mamillary ducts or milk ducts. Structure Lactiferous ducts are lined by a columnar epithelium supported by myoepithelial cells. When a woman is not lactating, the lactiferous duct is frequently blocked by a keratin plug. This plug helps to prevent bacteria from entering the duct in non-lactating women. Prior to 2005, it was thought within the areola the lactiferous duct would dilate to form the lactiferous sinus in which milk accumulates between breastfeeding sessions. However past studies have shown that the lactiferous sinus does not exist. Function The columnar epithelium plays a key role in balancing milk production, milk stasis and reabsorption. The cells of the columnar epithelium form tight junctions which are regulated by hormones and local factors like pressure and casein content. Prolactin and/or placental lactogen are required for tight junction closure while progesterone is the main hormone preventing closure before birth. Clinical significance The majority of breast diseases either originate from lactiferous ducts or are closely related. The high susceptibility to benign and malignant diseases is in part a consequence of the cycling hormonal growth stimulation resulting in a high cell turnover and accumulation of defects and complicated hormonal equilibrium which is highly sensible to disturbance. * most breast cancers arise from the ductal epithelium (see ductal carcinoma in situ) * phyllodes tumor and intraductal papilloma of the breast * mastalgia is frequently caused by an imbalance of breast secretion in the lobules and resorption in the ducts * nonpuerperal mastitis is frequently caused by a similar mechanism in combination with an infection * duct ectasia is similar and overlapping with the above mentioned * subareolar abscess and squamous metaplasia of lactiferous ducts * most forms of fibrocystic breast changes and cysts are thought to originate from lactiferous ducts Lactiferous Duct Dysmorphia (LDD) Lactiferous Duct Dysmorphia (LDD) is the deformity or abnormality in the shape or size of a milk duct negatively affecting milk flow (also known as Milk Duct Dysmorphia).

Friedrich Emmanuel von Hurter = Life  Friedrich Emmanuel von Hurter (born at Schaffhausen, 19 March 1787; died at Graz, 27 August 1865) was a Swiss Protestant cleric and historian who converted to Roman Catholicism. From 1804 to 1806 he attended the University of G√∂ttingen, and in 1808 was appointed to a country parish. The appearance in 1834 of the first volume of the life of Pope Innocent III, on which he had been working for twenty years, caused a profound sensation in both Catholic and Protestant circles, and was soon translated into French, English, Italian, and Spanish. Hurter was chosen in 1835 antistes of the clergy in the Canton of Schaffhausen, and later president of the school board, in which capacities he laboured with great zeal. During many years his manifest sympathy and intimacy with the Catholic clergy, including the Archbishop of Freiburg and the papal nuncios to Switzerland, and his disinterested efforts to assist Catholics roused the antagonism of his colleagues who took the first pretext to let loose a storm of abuse against Hurter. As a result, he resigned his dignities in 1841, lived in retirement for three years, and in 1844 went to Rome, where on 16 June he made his profession of faith before Gregory XVI, his conversion being the signal for renewed attacks. In 1846 he was appointed imperial counsellor and historiographer at the Court of Vienna, and took up the task assigned him, the life of Emperor Ferdinand II, which, however, was withheld from the press by the court censors, but appeared later at Schaffhausen. The Revolution of 1848 involved the loss of Hurter's position at Court, to which, however, he was restored in 1852. Till his death he laboured for the spread of Catholic religion, especially in connexion with the foreign mission field; he was also in close touch with the greatest scholars of the day. He was appointed by the pope a commander of the Order of St Gregory, and was a member of the academies of Rome, Munich, Brussels, and Assisi.  Works  In addition to his Leben Innocenz III (4 vols., Hamburg, 1834‚Äì42), Hurter was the author of Denkw√ºrdigkeiten aus dem letzten Dezennium des 18. Jahrhunderts (1840); Geburt and Widergeburt (Schaffhausen, 1845‚Äì46), an autobiography; Geschichte Kaiser Ferdinands II. und seiner Eltern (Schaffhausen, 1850‚Äì65); Philipp Lang, Kammerdiener Kaiser Rudolfs II.

Heinrich von Hurter  Heinrich von Hurter (born at Schaffhausen, 8 August 1825; died at Vienna, 30 May 1895) was the son of the preceding. He was ordained to the priesthood in 1851, and later appointed to a benefice at Vienna. Besides volumes of sermons, his writings include the principal biography of his father, Friedrich von Hurter und seine Zeit (2 vols., 1876), as well as Konzil und Unfehlbarkeit (1870) and Sch√∂nheit und Wahrheit der katholischen Kirche (9 vols., 1871‚Äì78).  Hugo von Hurter  Hugo Adalbert Ferdinand von Hurter, younger son of Friedrich (born at Schaffhausen, 11 January 1832; died 10 December 1914 at Innsbruck) was a distinguished Roman Catholic theologian. He was ordained priest in 1855. From 1849 to 1856 he studied at the Collegium Germanicum in Rome, where he was made doctor of philosophy and theology. In 1857 he entered into the Society of Jesus, and after a brief residence in the college at Baumgarten was appointed in 1858 to the theological faculty of the University of Innsbruck as professor of dogmatic theology (professor emeritus after his retirement in 1903). Between 1887 and 1890 he was also Rector of the Jesuits' college in Innsbruck (the \\"Nicolaihaus\\", predecessor of the better- known Collegium Canisianum).

It usually consists of 10 nodes symbolizing different archetypes and 22 lines connecting the nodes. The nodes are often arranged into three columns to represent that they belong to a common category. The nodes are usually represented as spheres and the lines are usually represented as paths. The nodes usually represent encompassing aspects of existence, God, or the human psyche. The lines usually represent the relationship between the concepts ascribed to the spheres or a symbolic description of the requirements to go from one sphere to another. The nodes are also associated to deities, angels, celestial bodies, values, single colors or combinations of them, and specific numbers. The columns are usually symbolized as pillars. These pillars usually represent different kinds of values, electric charges, or types of ceremonial magic. It is usually referred to as the Kabbalistic tree of life in order to distinguish it from other concepts with the same name. In the Jewish Kabbalah, the nodes are called sephiroth. The diagram is also used by Christian Cabbala, Hermetic Qabalah and Theosophy. The diagram is believed to be derivable from the flower of life. Scholars believe that the concept of a tree of life with different spheres encompassing aspects of reality traces its origins back to Assyria in the 9th century BC. The Assyrians also assigned values and specific numbers to their deities similar to those used by the later Jewish Kabbalah. The beginnings of the Jewish Kabbalah are traced back by scholars to the Medieval Age, originating in the Book of Bahir and the Book of Zohar. However, the first historical instance of the modern diagram appeared centuries later in the cover of the Latin translation of Gates of Light in the year 1516. Scholars have traced the origin of the art in the Porta Lucis cover to Johann Reuchlin.  Evolution  The first historical instance of the modern tree of life was designed by Johann Reuchlin. Paolo Riccio's son, Hyeronomius, had actively exchanged letters and shared his father's work with Reuchlin before publication. Thus, in the year 1516, Reuchlin's diagram came to appear on the cover of the Paolo Riccio's Latin translation of Joseph Gikatilla's Gates of Light. The diagram only had 17 paths and, at the time, the concepts of 10 spheres and 22 letters were still distinct in the literature. In 1573, a version sketched by Franciscus Zillettus appeared in Cesare Evoli, De divinis attributis. This version introduced several innovations that would reappear in later versions: all the spheres were of the same size, the lines became wide paths, the spheres were aligned into 3 distinct columns, Malkuth was connected to three spheres, and astrological symbols for the known celestial bodies were used in conjunction with the Hebrew names to label the spheres. However, it also had only 17 paths, albeit distributed differently. Reuchlin's version was reprinted in Johann Pistorius' compilation of 1587. Finally, several versions from unknown artists introducing 21 and 22 paths appeared in the posthumous print editions of Moses Cordovero's Pardes Rimonim between 1592 and 1609. However, the diagrams with 22 paths lacked consistency with each other and none of them had the 22 letters. Between 1652 and 1654, Athanasius Kircher published his own version of the tree in Oedipus Aegyptiacus. Kircher might have designed his diagram in a syncretic attempt to reconcile several distinct ideas. This heavily annotated version, self-termed Sephirotic System, introduced more innovations: abstract concepts, divine names, the 22 Hebrew letters for each path, and new astrological symbols. Between 1677 and 1684, Christian Knorr von Rosenroth published Kabbala Denudat. He designed several new versions of the tree of life, introduced the first version with 11 spheres, placed Daath between Kether and Tiphareth, and attempted to derive the tree of life from elemental geometry. Consequently, to modern day, two versions are widely circulated: one where Malkuth has 1 path, owing to Reuchlin's original; and another where Malkuth has three paths, owing to several later versions; both having 22 paths in total, corresponding each to a Hebrew letter, owing to Kircher's syncretism. With the resurgence of occultism in the 19th century, many new versions appeared, but without major innovations. In the 20th century, Aleister Crowley might have resurfaced the idea of Daath as an 11th hidden sphere between Kether and Tiphareth in his book Liber 777, syncretizing the concept with Kircher's symbols and von Rosenroth's diagrams. With the discovery of new planets, people might have tried to introduce more astrological symbols to their own versions of the diagram. As a result, there is no general agreement about the position of Uranus, Neptune and Pluto. However, in particular, it has been noted that Pluto bears resemblance with Daath: Pluto is a former planet, the last traditional celestial body to be discovered, and Daath is a hidden sphere, the last to be introduced. In the 21st century, enthusiasts might have rushed to attribute these collaborative works spanning centuries and involving several people through complex interactions to single authors. Thus, sometimes, the version where Malkuth has 3 paths is termed the Tree of Emanation, and the version where Malkuth has 1 path is termed the Tree of Return.  Interpretations = Chassidist  A pattern inspired by the tree of life in a window in the thumb The tree of life based on the depiction by Robert Fludd in the Deutsche Fotothek According to Chassidist Kabbalist scholars, the tree of life is to be interpreted in the following way: * The tree represents a series of divine emanations of God's creation itself ex nihilo, the nature of revealed divinity, the human soul, and the spiritual path of ascent by man. In this way, Kabbalists developed the symbol into a full model of reality, using the tree to depict a map of creation. * The symbolic configuration is made of 10 spiritual principles, but 11 can be shown, since \\"Keter\\" and \\"Da'at\\" are interchangeable. * The tree of knowledge of good and evil is equivalent to the 10 spheres seen from the last sphere of the diagram (\\"Malkuth\\"), and the original tree of life is equivalent to the 10 spheres seen from the middle sphere of the diagram (\\"Tiferet\\"). * Kabbalists believe the tree of life to be a diagrammatic representation of the process by which the universe came into being. * On the tree of life, the beginning of the universe is placed in a space above the first sphere (named \\"Keter\\" or \\"crown\\" in English). It is not always pictured in reproductions of the tree of life, but is referred to universally as Ain Soph Aur (\\"Ein Sof\\" in Hebrew or \\"endless light\\" in English). * To Kabbalists, it symbolizes that point beyond which our comprehension of the origins of being can't go. It is considered to be an infinite nothingness out of which the first \\"thing\\", usually understood among Kabbalists to be something approximating \\"energy\\", exploded to create a universe of multiple things. * Kabbalists also don't envision time and space as pre-existing and place them at the next three stages on the tree of life. * First is \\"Keter\\", which is thought of as the product of the contraction of \\"Ein Sof\\" into a singularity of infinite energy or limitless light. In the Kabbalah, it is the primordial energy out of which all things are created. * The next stage is \\"Chokhmah\\" (or \\"wisdom\\" in English), which is considered to be a stage at which the infinitely hot and contracted singularity expanded forth into space and time. It is often thought of as pure dynamic energy of an infinite intensity forever propelled forth at a speed faster than light. * Next comes \\"Binah\\" (or \\"understanding\\" in English), which is thought of as the primordial feminine energy, the supernal mother of the universe which receives the energy of \\"Chokhmah\\", cooling and nourishing it into the multitudinous forms present throughout the whole cosmos. It is also seen as the beginning of time itself. * Numbers are very important to Kabbalists, and the Hebrew letters of the alphabet also have a numerical value. Each stage of the emanation of the universe on the tree of life is numbered meaningfully from one (\\"Keter\\") to ten (\\"Malkuth\\"). Each number is thought to express the nature of its sphere. * The first three spheres, called the \\"supernal\\" spheres, are considered to be the primordial energies of the universe. The next stages of evolution on the tree of life are considered to exist beyond a space on the tree, called the \\"Abyss\\", between the \\"supernals\\" and the other spheres, because their levels of being are so distinct from each other that they appear to exist in two totally different realities. The \\"supernal\\" spheres exist on a plane of divine energy. This is why another correspondence for \\"Binah\\" is the idea of suffering because the \\"supernal\\" maternal energy gives birth to a world that is inherently excluded from that divine union. * After \\"Binah\\", the universe gets down to the business of building the materials it will need to fulfill its evolution and be creating new combinations of those materials until it is so dense that, by the stage of \\"Malkuth\\", the initial pure limitless energy has solidified into the physical universe. * Since its energies are the basis of all creation, the tree of life can potentially be applied to any area of life, especially the inner world of man, from the subconscious all the way to what Kabbalists call the higher self. * But the tree of life does not only speak of the origins of the physical universe out of the unimaginable but also of man's place in the universe. Since man is invested with mind, consciousness in the Kabbalah is thought of as the fruit of the physical world, through whom the original infinite energy can experience and express itself as a finite entity. * After the energy of creation has condensed into matter, it is thought to reverse its course back up the tree until it is once again united with its true nature: \\"Keter\\". Thus, the Kabbalist seeks to know himself and the universe as an expression of God and to make the journey of return by means of the stages charted by the spheres, until he has come to the realization he sought.

Early life Mabel Ganson was the heiress of Charles Ganson, a wealthy banker from Buffalo, New York, and his wife, Sarah Cook. Raised to charm and groomed to marry, she grew up among Buffalo's social elite, raised in the company of her nursemaid. She attended Saint Margaret‚Äôs Episcopal School for girls until the age of sixteen, then went to school in New York City. In 1896, she toured Europe and attended the 'Chevy Chase' finishing school in Washington, D.C. Her first marriage, in 1900 at the age of 21, was to Karl Evans, the son of a steamship owner. They were married in secret since Charles Ganson did not approve of Evans, and were later re-married in Trinity Church before Buffalo society. They had one son, but Karl died in a hunting accident two-and-a-half years later, leaving her a widow at 23. In the spring of 1904, an oval portrait of her in mourning dress was painted by the Swiss-born American artist Adolfo M√ºller-Ury for her paternal grandmother, Nancy Ganson of Delaware Avenue, Buffalo. Her family sent her to Paris after she began an affair with a prominent Buffalo gynecologist. In November, 1904, she married Edwin Dodge, a wealthy architect. She was also actively bisexual in her early life and frankly detailed her physical encounters with women in her autobiography Intimate Memories (1933).Faderman, Lillian, Odd Girls and Twilight Lovers: A History of Lesbian Life in Twentieth-Century America, Penguin Books Ltd, 1991, page 83. Florence Between 1905 and 1912 the Dodges lived near Florence at her palatial Medici villa, the Villa Curonia in Arcetri where she entertained local artists, in addition to Gertrude Stein, her brother Leo, Alice B. Toklas, and other visitors from Paris, including Andr√© Gide. A troubled liaison with her chauffeur led to two suicide attempts: the first by eating figs containing shards of glass; the second with laudanum. New York and Provincetown In mid-1912, the Dodges (by this time increasingly estranged), returned to America where Dodge set herself up as a patron of the arts, holding a weekly salon in her new apartment at 23 Fifth Avenue in Greenwich Village. Often in attendance were such luminaries as Carl Van Vechten, Margaret Sanger, Emma Goldman, Charles Demuth, \\"Big Bill\\" Haywood, Max Eastman, Lincoln Steffens, Hutchins Hapgood, Neith Boyce, Walter Lippmann, and John Reed. Van Vechten took Dodge as the model for the character \\"Edith Dale\\" in his novel Peter Whiffle. Anthropologist Raymond Harrington introduced Dodge and her friends to peyote in an impromptu \\"ceremony\\" there.Luhan, Mabel Dodge (1936) Movers and Shakers. New York: Harcourt, Brace and Company. She was involved in mounting the Armory Show of new European Modern Art in 1913 publishing and distributing in pamphlet-form a piece by Gertrude Stein entitled \\"Portrait of Mabel Dodge at the Villa Curonia\\", which increased her public profile. She sailed to Europe at the end of June 1913. John Reed (Jack) ‚Äî worn out from having recently organized the Paterson Pageant ‚Äî traveled with her. They became lovers after arriving in Paris, where they socialized with Stein and Pablo Picasso before leaving for the Villa Curonia, where the guests included Arthur Rubinstein. At first this was a very happy time for the couple, but tensions grew between them as Reed became uncomfortable with the affluent isolation, and Dodge saw his interests in the world of people and achievements as a rejection of her. They returned to New York in late September, 1913. In October, Reed was sent to report on the Mexican Revolution by Metropolitan Magazine. Although Dodge followed him to the border town of Presidio, she left after just a few days. Between 1914 and 1916, a strong connection developed between the intelligentsia of Greenwich Village and Provincetown and, in 1915, Dodge arrived there with painter Maurice Sterne. While in Provincetown, John Reed helped to organize The Provincetown Players, and Dodge experienced a rivalry with Mary Heaton Vorse. In 1916, Dodge became a nationally syndicated columnist for the Hearst organization, relocating to Finney Farm, a large Croton estate. Sterne, who was to become Dodge's third husband, lived in a cottage behind the main house, while Dodge offered Reed the third floor of the house as a writing studio. Although he moved in for a short period, the situation became untenable; Dodge and Sterne married later that year. Santa Barbara During this period Dodge also began spending long periods of time in Santa Barbara, California, where her friend Lincoln Steffens had relatives. (Lincoln Steffens' sister Lottie was married to local rancher John J. Hollister). Taos In 1917 Dodge, her husband, and Elsie Clews Parsons moved to Taos, New Mexico, where she began a literary colony. On the advice of Tony Lujan, a Native American whom she would marry in 1923, she purchased a property. Lujan set up a teepee in front of her house, drumming each night in an attempt to lure her to him. Although Sterne bought a shotgun with the intention of chasing Lujan off the property, unable to use it, he instead took to insulting Dodge. In response, she sent him away, although she supported him financially until the time of their divorce four years later. D. H. Lawrence, the English author, accepted an invitation from her to stay in Taos, arriving with his wife, Frieda, in early September, 1922. He had a fraught relationship with his hostess, however, later writing about it in his fiction. Dodge later published a memoir about the visit entitled, Lorenzo in Taos (1932). Editor and book designer Merle Armitage also wrote a book about this time in New Mexico. Taos Quartet in Three Movements was originally to appear in Flair Magazine, but the magazine folded before its publication. This short work describes the tumultuous relationship of D. H. Lawrence, his wife Frieda, artist Dorothy Brett and Mabel Dodge Sterne. Armitage took it upon himself to print 16 hardcover copies of this work for his friends. Richard Pousette-Dart executed the drawings for Taos Quartet that was published in 1950. In New Mexico, Dodge and Lujan hosted a number of influential artists and poets, including Marsden Hartley, Arnold Ronnebeck, Louise Emerson Ronnebeck, Ansel Adams, Willa Cather, Walter Van Tilburg Clark, Robinson Jeffers and his wife Una,Mabel Dodge Luhan Una and Robin Berkeley, CA: Bancroft Library, 1976 Florence McClung, Georgia O'Keeffe, Mary Hunter Austin, Mary Foote, Frank Waters, Jaime de Angulo, Aldous Huxley, Ernie O'Malley and others.Lois Palken Rudnick.

Americana, as defined by the Americana Music Association (AMA), is \\"contemporary music that incorporates elements of various mostly acoustic American roots music styles, including country, roots rock, folk, gospel and bluegrass resulting in a distinctive roots-oriented sound that lives in a world apart from the pure forms of the genres upon which it may draw. While acoustic instruments are often present and vital, Americana also often uses a full electric band.\\" Etymology The phrase \\"Americana\\", in its current meaning, to describe the culture of the United States of America, was coined in 1841. Despite the genre's most common name, it is not practiced solely by artists from the United States, as numerous artists from Canada are also prominent in the genre.Annie Zaleski, \\"25 Country and Americana artists you might not know are Canadian\\". The Boot, September 5, 2018.

Chapter 48, \\"The Sadies Look South\\". although this is not a widely recognized synonym elsewhere. Americana as a radio format Americana as a radio format had its origins in 1984 on KCSN in Northridge, California. Mark Humphrey, a contributor to country/folk Frets magazine, hosted a weekly radio show called \\"Honky Tonk Amnesia\\" which played \\"country, folk, honky tonk, cajun, dawg, blues, and old-time music\\", a combination that the country music station KCSN advertised as \\"Americana\\". The format came into its own in the mid-1990s as a descriptive phrase used by radio promoters and music industry figures for traditionally-oriented songwriters and performers.

Morphology=Adult insects Adult Roesel's bush-crickets are medium-sized Tettigoniid between 13‚Äì26 mm in length. They are normally brown or yellow, often with a greenish shade and a rarer green form also sometimes occurs. An identifying feature is the yellow-green spots along the abdomen, just behind the pronotum, along with a matching margin along the border of the pronotum. This margin is entire, unlike the bog bush-cricket. Males and females can be easily differentiated, as the females have a long sword-like ovipositor at the end of their abdomen, which the males lack. Female Macropterous form Macropterous form Both male and female adults are normally brachypterous. However, a macropterous form, f. diluta (described by Charpentier 1825) also exists. These have much longer wings, and usually make up less than 1% of the total population, but in some populations occur in much higher numbers, usually in areas where the bush-cricket's range has recently expanded to. They are more common in long, warm summers where populations reach higher densities. It has also been suggested that a very localised hostile environment may also produce a higher level of macropterous forms. The macropterous form is a dispersal phase, and it provides the advantage of reaching new, more favourable habitats, within which there is a lower density of Roesel's bush-crickets residing. Well established populations tend to be more highly brachypterous, as high dispersal ability is correlated with lower fecundity in Orthoptera. Life history Roesel's bush-crickets have only one generation every year. In the summer and autumn, the sword-like ovipositor of the female adult is used to cut open plant stems (usually grasses) and lay the egg pods within. They emerge in May as nymphs. These must go through five or six instars before becoming adults. The final instar may be the most important in determining whether the insect develops as a brachypterous form or a macropterous form. It has been suggested that production of macropterous forms may be due to juvenile hormone (JH) degradation in the final instar, which leads to a shorter period of JH presence within the nymph. This allows more flight muscle and wing production during metamorphosis. Adults tend to emerge in late June to early July. When the climate is mild enough, some can still be found at the end of October. Brachypterous forms disperse through the environment by walking along roadside grasses and ditches. Ecology and vegetation preferences Vegetation structure and species both influence bush cricket distribution. Grass length is one of the key structural factors, as shorter grasses leave the bush crickets more at risk from predation and environmental disturbance, whereas longer grasses block out light. The height of grassland is also important in song propagation, and a higher position for stridulation is essential for many bush crickets as grasslands have a hampering effect on noise. Sward height preferences change depending on the time of year. Roesel's bush-crickets have a preference for ungrazed grasses, with tall swards, which are a component of its diet. Other parts of their diet are grass seeds and smaller insects. They also have a preference for humidity, and thus require grasslands which remain reasonably undisturbed. Due to its affinity for tall grasses, they can be found in a variety of habitats, including long swards at the edges of roads, field borders and pastures. Range Roesel's bush-cricket is commonly found throughout southern and central Europe, as well as further North, in Finland, Latvia and Sweden. Its native range stretches from west Europe to western Siberia. Status in Britain Roesel's bush-cricket is native to Great Britain and Ireland. It is becoming one of the most commonly found Orthoptera in the British Isles, and makes up about 16% of records. It used to be found uniquely on the inland side of saltmarshes, and in coastal regions around estuaries, on the North Sea coast. It is becoming increasingly common in southeast England, as well as spreading further north. Over the past 50 years it has ranged further to the west, and large numbers have settled in areas of urban wasteland, especially near railways. It is generally found below 100 metres altitude. Extension to the species range has increased substantially since 1985. Presence in North America Despite being native to Europe, Roesel's bush-cricket has made its way into North America. It was first reported in Montreal and Ville St. Laurent by Urqhart and Baudry (1953) in Canada. Since then its range has increased in Ontario and Quebec, and into the United States as far as Illinois. It has been forecasted that Roesel's bush- cricket will disperse even further across eastern Canada and the United States, more likely limited to areas where grasslands are left relatively untouched across the year so as to allow the eggs to hatch. Song Male adults start to sing (or stridulate) in July to attract females of the same species. Stridulation occurs for a long time (with only very brief pauses), whilst the weather is hot and sunny. The song is characteristic of the species which allows for easy identification by experts. The song consists of continuous penetrating buzzing, at a high pitch. The sound is similar to that of Savi's warbler, or the hiss of overhead electricity wires. During the day, the male bush cricket moves to locations within the flora that lie in the sun, in an attempt to achieve the peak temperature for stridulation.

(1936-2006)\\". Parapsychological Association. Biography Walker was born in Birmingham, Alabama.\\"The Physics of Consciousness: The Quantum Mind and the Meaning of Life\\". Publishers Weekly. He received his Ph.D. in physics from the University of Maryland in 1964. He received over a dozen patents and published more than a hundred papers in scientific journals. Walker said he had undergone a Zen enlightenment experience in 1966 while walking in a field at the University of Maryland. This led him to reassess quantum mechanics, finding its indeterminacy incomplete. He worked at the Ballistic Research Laboratories of the US Army's Aberdeen Proving Ground in Maryland. He wrote several articles which appeared in the Journal of Arthur M. Young's \\"Institute for the Study of Consciousness\\" ( founded in Berkeley in 1972). These papers greatly interested Nick Herbert and Saul-Paul Sirag, who invited him to talk to the Fundamental Fysiks Group in the mid-70s. In 1981, Walker founded the Walker Cancer Research Institute, a nonprofit organization based in Aberdeen, Maryland, which funds public awareness of the risk of cancer and research for a cure. Evan Harris Walker died, aged 70, on August 17, 2006, at Harford Memorial Hospital in Havre de Grace, Maryland. Writings Walker promoted the charge that Albert Einstein \\"stole\\" special relativity from his first wife, Mileva Mariƒá. (This claim has not been accepted by mainstream historians of science.) [Pais (1994), pp. 1‚Äì29; Holton (1996), pp. 177‚Äì193; Stachel (2002), p. 26-38; 39-55; Martinez, (2005), pp. 49‚Äì56.] Walker believed that a quantum observer theory could explain paranormal phenomena. In 1979, Walker and Richard Mattuck published a parapsychology paper proposing a quantum explanation for psychokinesis. Physicist Victor J. Stenger wrote that their explanation contained assumptions, not supported by any scientific evidence. According to Stenger their paper is \\"filled with impressive looking equations and calculations that give the appearance of placing psychokinesis on a firm scientific footing... Yet look what they have done. They have found the value of one unknown number (wavefunction steps) that gives one measured number (the supposed speed of PK-induced motion). This is numerology, not science.\\"Stenger, Victor J. (1990). Physics and Psychics: The Search for a World Beyond the Senses. Prometheus Books. pp. 248-250. Martin Gardner noted that Walker's parapsychological work was not supported by any scientific evidence and his quantum mechanical calculations to explain paranormal phenomena and God were an example of pseudoscience.Gardner, Martin. (1981). Parapsychology and Quantum Mechanics. In Science and the Paranormal: Probing the Existence of the Supernatural. Edited by George O. Abell, Barry Singer. Scribner. pp. 56-69. In the late 1990s Walker wrote 'The Fabric of Reality', about half of that work was published as The Physics of Consciousness. The book shows how an observer collapses the wave state and actualizes reality from the probability field of the quantum mechanical process responsible for the creation of human consciousness. Walker expanded on that with 'The Magic of Mind' which remained unpublished at the time of his death.

The bandwidth-delay product was originally proposed as a rule of thumb for sizing router buffers in conjunction with congestion avoidance algorithm Random Early Detection (RED). A network with a large bandwidth-delay product is commonly known as a long fat network (shortened to LFN). As defined in RFC 1072, a network is considered an LFN if its bandwidth-delay product is significantly larger than 105 bits (12,500 bytes). Ultra-high speed local area networks (LANs) may fall into this category, where protocol tuning is critical for achieving peak throughput, on account of their extremely high bandwidth, even though their delay is not great. While a connection with 1 Gbit/s and a round-trip time below 100 Œºs is no LFN, a connection with 100 Gbit/s would need to stay below 1 Œºs RTT to not be considered an LFN. An important example of a system where the bandwidth-delay product is large is that of geostationary satellite connections, where end-to-end delivery time is very high and link throughput may also be high. The high end-to-end delivery time makes life difficult for stop-and-wait protocols and applications that assume rapid end-to-end response. A high bandwidth-delay product is an important problem case in the design of protocols such as Transmission Control Protocol (TCP) in respect of TCP tuning, because the protocol can only achieve optimum throughput if a sender sends a sufficiently large quantity of data before being required to stop and wait until a confirming message is received from the receiver, acknowledging successful receipt of that data. If the quantity of data sent is insufficient compared with the bandwidth-delay product, then the link is not being kept busy and the protocol is operating below peak efficiency for the link. Protocols that hope to succeed in this respect need carefully designed self-monitoring, self-tuning algorithms. The TCP window scale option may be used to solve this problem caused by insufficient window size, which is limited to 65,535 bytes without scaling.

It left the main line about nine kilometres north of Palmerston at the small settlement of Shag Point to provide railway access to a nearby supply of coal. It was built in 1879 and ran until 1934. Construction and operation Authorisation was granted to build the line in 1878 and was built wholly to serve the Shag Point Coal Company, whose engineer supervised construction in 1879. Records exist of traffic using the line in June that year, though the official opening was not held until 18 August. The line was roughly three kilometres in length and it was shunted when required by passing freights on the Main South Line. Traffic declined as the 20th century began, and on 1 April 1908, the New Zealand Railways Department (NZR) stopped serving the line. This, however, was not the end for the branch. It passed into the ownership of the Shag Point Coal Company, who privately operated the line for a quarter of a century. At different points during this time, the company owned two small ex-NZR tank locomotives. Activity picked up in the 1920s but then the Great Depression began and the mine did not survive. The mine closed in 1934 and therefore so did the line. The branch today Little remains of this line. The rusted remains of the local wharf are clearly evident, and the line approached this wharf through a cutting. Evidence of the line's formation can be seen near where it met the Main South Line at Shag Point station. Part of the formation has been re-used as a road serving some houses in the small fishing village.

In general, passenger airline trijets are considered to be second-generation jet airliners, due to their innovative engine locations, in addition to the advancement of turbofan technology. Other variations of three-engine designs are trimotors, which are aircraft with three propellers (driven by piston engines or turboprops).  Design  One issue with trijets is positioning the central engine. This is mostly accomplished by placing the engine along the centerline, but this still poses difficulties. The most common configuration is having the central engine located in the rear fuselage and supplied with air by an S-shaped duct; this is used on the Hawker Siddeley Trident, Boeing 727, Tupolev Tu-154, Lockheed L-1011 TriStar, and, more recently, the Dassault Falcon 7X. The S-duct has low drag, and since the third engine is mounted closer to the centerline, the aircraft will normally be easy to handle in the event of an engine failure. However, S-duct designs are extremely complex and costly. Furthermore, the central engine bay would require structural changes in the event of a major re-engining. For example, the 727's central bay was only wide enough to fit a low-bypass turbofan and not the newer high-bypass turbofans which were quieter and more powerful. Boeing decided that a redesign was too expensive and ended its production instead of pursuing further development. The Lockheed Tristar's tail section was too short to fit an existing two-spool engine as it was designed only to accommodate the new three-spool Rolls-Royce RB211 engine, and delays in the RB211's development, in turn, pushed back the TriStar's entry into service which affected sales. The McDonnell Douglas DC-10 and related MD-11 use an alternative \\"straight-through\\" layout, which allows for easier engine installation, modification, and access. It also has the additional benefit of being much easier to re-engine. However, this sacrifices aerodynamics compared to the S-duct. Also, as the engine is located much higher up than the wing-mounted engines, engine failure will produce a greater pitching moment, making it more difficult to control. The placement of the remaining two engines varies. Most smaller aircraft, like the Hawker Siddeley Trident, the Boeing 727 and the Tupolev Tu-154 have two side-mount engine pylons in a T-tail configuration. The larger widebody Lockheed TriStar and DC-10/MD-11 mount an engine underneath each wing. Preliminary studies were done on the TriStar to reuse the fuselage and wing for a twinjet design though these never materialized due to Lockheed's lack of funds. Additionally in the late-1990s Boeing, which had taken over McDonnell Douglas, considered removing the tail engine from the MD-11 to make it a twinjet but ending up instead ending its production altogether, as the 767 and 777 would have cannibalized it.  Advantages and drawbacks  One major advantage of the trijet design is that the wings can be located further aft on the fuselage, compared to twinjets and quadjets with all wing-mounted engines, allowing main cabin exit and entry doors to be more centrally located for quicker boarding and deplaning, ensuring shorter turnaround times. The rear-mounted engine and wings shift the aircraft's center of gravity rearwards, improving fuel efficiency, although this will also make the plane slightly less stable and more difficult to handle during takeoff and landing. (The McDonnell Douglas DC-9 twinjet and its derivatives, whose engines are mounted on pylons near the rear empennage, have similar advantages/disadvantages of the trijet design, such as the wings located further aft and a more rearward center of gravity.) Trijets are more efficient and cheaper than four-engine aircraft, as the engines are the most expensive part of the plane and having more engines consumes more fuel, particularly if quadjets and trijets share engines of similar power, making the trijet configuration more suited to a mid-size airliner compared to larger quadjets. However, higher purchase prices, primarily due to the difficulty and complexity of mounting the third engine through the tail, will somewhat negate this advantage. Due to their added thrust, trijets will have slightly improved takeoff performance compared to twinjets if an engine fails. Because takeoff performance for aircraft is usually calculated to include an extra margin to account for a possible engine failure, trijets are better able to take off from hot and high airports or those where terrain clearance near the runway is an issue. Unlike twinjets, trijets are not required to land immediately at the nearest suitable airport if one engine fails (this advantage is also shared with quadjets). This is advantageous if the aircraft is not near one of the operator's maintenance bases, as the pilots may then continue the flight and land at an airport where it is more suitable to perform repairs. Additionally, for trijets on the ground with one engine inoperative, approval can be granted to perform two- engine ferry flights. Prior to the introduction of ETOPS, only trijets and quadjets were able to perform long international flights over areas without any diversion airports. However, this advantage has largely disappeared in recent years as ETOPS-certified twin-engined aircraft are able to do so as well. The biggest obstacle trijets face today is operating costs, primarily fuel efficiency, as a three-engine design almost certainly consumes more fuel than a comparable two-engine design. This also greatly increases the difficulty of marketing a new trijet aircraft today, especially for passenger service. However this was worth the trade-off between 1970 and the 1990s when trijets and twinjets shared engines of similar output, such as when the DC-10, MD-11, Boeing's 767, and Airbus's A300, A310, and A330 were all powered by the General Electric CF6, and the additional power from the third engine gave the DC-10/MD-11 advantages in longer range and/or heavier payload over the A300/A330 twinjet. Since the 1990s, with further advancements in high-bypass turbofan technology, large twinjets have been equipped with purpose-designed engines like the Boeing 777's General Electric GE90, allowing twinjets to perform the same tasks as most trijets and even many quadjets but more efficiently.  History  The McDonnell Douglas MD-11, a stretched and redesigned successor to the DC-10, is the most recent trijet design produced for commercial aviation service. A Tupolev Tu-154M operated by Rossiya Airlines for the Russian government The Dassault Falcon 900 business jet The first trijet design to fly was the Tupolev Tu-73 bomber prototype, first flown in 1947. The first commercial trijets were the Hawker Siddeley Trident (1962) and the Boeing 727 (1963). Both were compromises to meet airline requirements; in the case of the Trident, it was to meet BEA's changing needs, while the 727 had to be acceptable for three different airlines. Although collaboration between the manufacturers was considered, it did not come about. Early American twinjet designs were limited by the FAA's 60-minute rule, whereby the flight path of twin-engine jetliners was restricted to within 60 minutes' flying time from a suitable airport, in case of engine failure. In 1964, this rule was lifted for trijet designs, as they had a greater safety margin. For second-generation jet airliners, with the innovations of the high-bypass turbofan for greater efficiency and reduced noise, and the wide-body (twin- aisle) for greater passenger/cargo capacity, the trijet design was seen as the optimal configuration for the medium wide-body jet airliner, sitting in terms of size, range, and cost between quadjets (four-engine aircraft) and twinjets, and this led to a flurry of trijet designs. The four-engine Boeing 747 was popular for transoceanic flights due to its long-range and large size, but it was expensive and not all routes were able to fill its seating capacity, while the original models of the Airbus A300 twinjet were limited to short- to medium-range distances. During this period, different jet airliners shared engines of similar output, such as when the McDonnell Douglas DC-10, Airbus A300, and Boeing 767 were powered by the General Electric CF6, the additional power from the third engine gave the DC-10 advantages in longer range and/or heavier payload over the A300 and 767 twinjets. Thus trijet designs such as the DC-10 and L-1011 TriStar represented the best compromise with medium- to long-range and medium size that US airlines sought for their domestic and transatlantic routes. As a result of these trijet wide-bodies, as well as the popularity of the Boeing 727, in their heyday of the 1980s trijets made up a majority of all such US jet airliners. From 1985 to 2003 the number of such planes in service had sunk from 1488 to 602. The number of twinjets, on the other hand, had more than quadrupled in the same period.Table 1-13: Active U.S. Air Carrier and General Aviation Fleet by Type of Aircraft Bureau of Transportation Statistics Both Lockheed and McDonnell Douglas were financially weakened competing in the widebody market, which led to Lockheed ending production of the L-1011 in 1984 after producing only half the units needed to break even, while a number of fatal DC-10 crashes also slowed its sales. In 1984 Boeing ended production of the 727, as its central engine bay would require an extremely expensive redesign to accommodate quieter high-bypass turbofans, and it was soon supplanted by Airbus with their A320 and Boeing with their 737 and 757. Further advancements in high-bypass turbofan technology and subsequent relaxation in airline safety rules made the trijet and even the quadjet nearly obsolete for passenger services, as their range and payload could be covered more efficiently with large twinjets powered with purpose-designed engines such as the 777's General Electric GE90. During the 1980s, McDonnell Douglas was the only Western manufacturer to continue development of the trijet design with an update to the DC-10, the MD-11, which initially held a range and payload advantage over its closest medium wide-body competitors which were twinjets, the in-production Boeing 767 and upcoming Airbus A330. McDonnell Douglas had planned a new trijet called the MD-XX, which were lengthened versions of the MD-11. The MD-XX Long Range aircraft would have been capable of traveling distances up to and had a wingspan of . The project was canceled in 1996, one year before McDonnell Douglas was acquired by Boeing. Boeing ended production of the MD-11 after filling remaining customer orders since the MD-11 would have competed with the 767 and 777. A study to remove the MD-11's tail-mounted engine (which would have made it a twinjet) never came to fruition as it would have been very expensive, and the MD-11 had very little in common in terms of design or type rating with other Boeing airliners. In contrast to McDonnell Douglas sticking with their existing trijet configuration, Airbus (which never produced a trijet aircraft) and Boeing worked on new widebody twinjet designs that would become the A330 and 777, respectively. The MD-11's long-range advantage was brief as it soon was threatened by the A330's four-engine derivative, the A340, and the 777. The only other notable trijet development during the 1980s was in the Soviet Union, where the Tupolev Tu-154 was re-engined with the Soloviev D-30 engine as well as a new wing design and entered serial production from 1984 as the Tu-154M. With the exception of the Dassault Falcon 7X, Falcon 8x, and Falcon 900, no manufacturer now produces three-engine airliners.  Current status  Modern engines have extremely low failure rates and can generate much higher shaft power and thrust than early types. This makes twinjets more suitable than they were before for long-haul trans-oceanic operations, resulting in eased ETOPS restrictions; modern wide-body twin-engine jets usually have an ETOPS 180 or even (in the case of the Boeing 777 and 787) ETOPS 330 rating. As such, having more than two engines is no longer considered necessary, except for very large or heavy aircraft such as the Boeing 747, Airbus A380 (over 400 seats in a mixed-class configuration), Antonov An-124, and An-225, or for flights through the Southern Hemisphere, primarily to and from Australia (which has not yet adopted the ETOPS 330 standard), where the most direct route for some flights is over Antarctica. Today, both narrow-body and wide-body trijet production has ceased for almost all commercial aircraft, being replaced by twinjets. As of 2016, the Falcon 7X, 8X, and 900 business jets, all of which use S-ducts, are the only trijets in production. Some old models, such as the 727, Tu-154, DC-10, and MD-11, have found second careers as cargo aircraft, as well as limited charter, governmental, and military service. The most widely used trijets are the DC-10 and the MD-11, mostly operated by UPS Airlines and FedEx Express in cargo service. For private and corporate operators, where fuel efficiency is often less important than for airlines, trijets may still be of interest due to their immunity from ETOPS and the ability to take off from shorter runways. As a result, a sizeable number of trijets, such as 727s and newly built Dassault Falcons, are in use by private operators and corporate flight departments.  Future of trijets  Airbus filed a patent in 2008 for a new, twin-tail trijet design, whose tail engine appears to use a \\"straight\\" layout similar to the MD-11, but it is unknown if and when this will be developed or produced.Airbus files patent for new trijet design, FlightGlobal.com, Retrieved 2008-12-11. However, the proposed Boeing X-48 blended wing body design, Lockheed's N+2 design study, and Aerion AS2 supersonic business jet also have three engines. The AS2 is currently taking orders and a wooden mockup has been constructed. Boom Technology's planned Overture supersonic transport (SST) airliner is planned to use three engines, with the third engine installed in the tail with a Y-shaped duct and air intakes on both sides of the rear.

It is a museum focused on design, fashion and applied arts. The museum collection consists of over 50,000 objects. The majority of the collection consists of handicraft and design products from Sweden and Europe and arts and crafts from Japan and China. The museum also holds a very fine collection of fashion from the 20th and 21st centuries, including many haute couture garments from Paris and other famous fashion designs from all over the world. Today, the R√∂hsska Museum mainly collects contemporaneous material and the museum seeks to achieve a dialogue with its users on contemporary phenomena and expression. History The R√∂hsska Museum was founded in 1904. The financial foundation was a donation from the estate of Wilhelm R√∂hss in 1901, and in the ensuing years, further donations were made by people including his brother, August R√∂hss. The original building, clad in red, hand-made brick was designed by architect Carl Westman in the National Romantic style. In 1916 the museum was opened to the public. The museum's first curator was Axel Nilsson, who also participated in the construction of the museum.

It was negotiated during the Uruguay Round of the General Agreement on Tariffs and Trade, and entered into force with the establishment of the WTO on January 1, 1995. History=Origins The idea of replacing agricultural price support with direct payments to farmers decoupled from production dates back to the late 1950s, when the twelfth session of the GATT Contracting Parties selected a Panel of Experts chaired by Gottfried Haberler to examine the effect of agricultural protectionism, fluctuating commodity prices and the failure of export earnings to keep pace with import demand in developing countries. The 1958 Haberler Report stressed the importance of minimising the effect of agriculture subsidies on competitiveness and recommended replacing price support with direct supplementary payments not linked with production, anticipating discussion on green box subsidies. Only more recently, though, has this shift become the core of the reform of the global agricultural system.Agricultural Subsidies in the WTO Green Box, ICTSD, September 2009. Historical context By the 1980s, government payments to agricultural producers in industrialised countries had caused large crop surpluses, which were unloaded on the world market by means of export subsidies, pushing food prices down. The fiscal burden of protective measures increased, due both to lower receipts from import duties and higher domestic expenditure. In the meantime, the global economy had entered a cycle of recession, and the perception that opening up markets could improve economic conditions led to calls for a new round of multilateral trade negotiations. The round would open up markets in services and high-technology goods, ultimately generating much needed efficiency gains. In order to engage developing countries, many of which were \\"demandeurs\\" of new international disciplines, agriculture, textiles, and clothing were added to the grand bargain. In leading up to the 1986 GATT Ministerial Conference in Punta del Este, Uruguay, farm lobbies in developed countries strongly resisted compromises on agriculture. In this context, the idea of exempting production and \\"trade-neutral\\" subsidies from WTO commitments was first proposed by the United States in 1987, and echoed soon after by the EU. By guaranteeing farmers continued support, it also neutralised opposition. In exchange for bringing agriculture within the disciplines of the WTO and committing to future reduction of trade-distorting subsidies, developed countries would be allowed to retain subsidies that cause \\"not more than minimal trade distortion\\" in order to deliver various public policy objectives. Three pillars The Agreement on Agriculture constitutes of three pillars‚Äîdomestic support, market access, and export subsidies. Domestic support The first pillar of the Agreement on Agriculture is \\"domestic support\\". AoA divides domestic support into two categories: trade-distorting and non-trade- distorting (or minimally trade-distorting). The WTO Agreement on Agriculture negotiated in the Uruguay Round (1986‚Äì1994) includes the classification of subsidies by \\"boxes\\" depending on consequences of production and trade: amber (most directly linked to production levels), blue (production-limiting programmes that still distort trade), and green (minimal distortion).\\"Agriculture Negotiations: Background Fact Sheet\\", World Trade Organization. While payments in the amber box had to be reduced, those in the green box were exempt from reduction commitments. Detailed rules for green box payments are set out in Annex 2 of the AoA. However, all must comply with the \\"fundamental requirement\\" in paragraph 1, to cause not more than minimal distortion of trade or production, and must be provided through a government- funded programme that does not involve transfers from consumers or price support to producers. The Agreement on Agriculture's domestic support system currently allows Europe and the United States to spend $380 billion a year on agricultural subsidies. The World Bank dismissed the EU and the United States' argument that small farmers needed protection, noting that more than half of the EU's Common Agricultural Policy subsidies go to 1% of producers while in the United States 70% of subsidies go to 10% of its producers, mainly agribusinesses. These subsidies end up flooding global markets with below-cost commodities, depressing prices, and undercutting producers in poor countries, a practice known as dumping. Market access Market access refers to the reduction of tariff (or non-tariff) barriers to trade by WTO members. The 1995 Agreement on Agriculture consists of tariff reductions of: *36% average reduction - developed countries - with a minimum of 15% per-tariff line reduction in next six years. *24% average reduction - developing countries - with a minimum of 10% per-tariff line reduction in next ten years. Least developed countries (LDCs) were exempt from tariff reductions, but they either had to convert non-tariff barriers to tariffs‚Äîa process called tariffication‚Äîor \\"bind\\" their tariffs, creating a ceiling that could not be increased in future. Export subsidies Export subsidies are the third pillar. The 1995 Agreement on Agriculture required developed countries to reduce export subsidies by at least 36% (by value) or by 21% (by volume) over six years. For developing countries, the agreement required cuts were 24% (by value) and 14% (by volume) over ten years. Criticism The Agreement has been criticised by civil society groups for reducing tariff protections for small farmers, a key source of income in developing countries, while simultaneously allowing rich countries to continue subsidizing agriculture at home. The Agreement was criticised by NGOs for categorizing subsidies into trade-distorting domestic subsidies (the \\"amber box\\"), which have to be reduced, and non-trade-distorting subsidies (blue and green boxes), which escape discipline and thus can be increased. As efficient agricultural exporters press WTO members to reduce their trade-distorting \\"amber box\\" and \\"blue box\\" support, developed countries' green box spending has increased. A 2009 book by the International Centre for Trade and Sustainable Development (ICTSD) showed how green box subsidies distorted trade, affecting developing country farmers and harming the environment. While some green box payments only had a minor effect on production and trade, others have a significant impact. According to countries' latest official reports to the WTO, the United States provided $76 billion (more than 90% of total spending) in green box payments in 2007, while the European Union notified ‚Ç¨48 billion ($91 billion) in 2005, around half of all support. The EU's large and growing green box spending was decoupled from income support, which could lead to a significant impact on production and trade. Third World Network stated, \\"This has allowed the rich countries to maintain or raise their very high subsidies by switching from one kind of subsidy to another...This is why after the Uruguay Round the total amount of subsidies in OECD countries have gone up instead of going down, despite the apparent promise that Northern subsidies will be reduced.\\" Moreover, Martin Khor argued that the green and blue box subsidies can be just as trade-distorting‚Äîas \\"the protection is better disguised, but the effect is the same\\".TWN Statement on Agriculture at the UN ECOSOC High-Level Session\\" TWN, July 2003 At the 2005 WTO meeting in Hong Kong, countries agreed to eliminate export subsidy and equivalent payments by 2013. However, Oxfam argued that EU export subsidies comprise for only 3.5% of its overall agricultural support. United States, removed export subsidies for cotton which only covers 10% of overall spending. \\"WTO agreement a betrayal of development promises\\" , Oxfam December 2005 on 18 July 2017 India and China jointly submitted a proposal to the World Trade Organization (WTO) calling for the elimination ‚Äì by developed countries ‚Äì of the most trade-distorting form of farm subsidies, known in WTO parlance as Aggregate Measurement of Support (AMS) or 'Amber Box' support as a prerequisite for consideration of other reforms in domestic support negotiations. Mechanisms for developing countries During the Doha negotiations, developing countries have fought to protect their interest and population, afraid of competing on the global market with strong developed and exporting economies. In many countries large populations living in rural areas, with limited access to infrastructure, farming resources and few employment alternatives. Thus, these countries are concerned that domestic rural populations employed in import-competing sectors might be negatively affected by further trade liberalization, becoming increasingly vulnerable to market instability and import surges as tariff barriers are removed. Several mechanisms have been suggested in order to preserve those countries: the Special Safeguard Mechanism (SSM) and treatment of Special Products (SPs). Special Safeguard Mechanism A Special Safeguard Mechanism (SSM) would allow developing countries to impose additional safety measures in the event of an abnormal surge in imports or the entry of unusually cheap imports. Debates have arisen around this question, some negotiating parties claiming that SSM could be repeatedly and excessively invoked, distorting trade. In turn, the G33 bloc of developing countries, a major SSM proponent, has argued that breaches of bound tariffs should not be ruled out if the SSM is to be an effective remedy. A 2010 study by the International Centre for Trade and Sustainable Development simulated the consequences of SSM on global trade for both developed and developing countries. Special Products At 2005 WTO Ministerial Conference in Hong Kong, WTO members agreed to allow developing countries to assign or make appropriate list of products for tariff lines as Special Products (SPs) based on \\"food security, livelihood security and rural development\\".International Centre for Trade and Sustainable Development and Food and Agriculture Organization, \\"Indicators for the Selection of Agricultural Special Products: Some Empirical Evidence\\", ICTSD Information Note Number 1.

It can also refer in a general sense to everyone whom the da‚Äòwah (invitation to Islam) has not reached in an uncorrupted manner and live in ignorance of the teachings of Islam. In Arabic the term used was \\"conveyance of the message\\" (, '). Afterlife Accordingly, the people of the period are judged differently on the Day of Judgement. There is a difference of opinion between scholars of Islam on their afterlife. The rationalist Mu'tazilites believed that each person would be legally responsible (, ') to reject polytheism and idolatry, and believe in an All- Powerful God. Failure to do so warranted damnation for eternity. The Ash'aris believed that those who did not receive the message would be forgiven, even idolaters. Their premise was that good and evil is based upon revelation; in other words, good and evil are defined by God. Therefore, in the absence of revelation, they cannot be held accountable. Abu Hamid al-Ghazali categorized non-Muslims into three categories: * 1. People who never heard of the message, who live in far away lands, such as the Byzantines (\\"Romans\\"). These will be forgiven. * 2. People who were exposed to a distorted understanding of Islam and have no recourse to correct that information. These too will be forgiven. * 3. People who heard of Islam because they live in neighboring lands and mix with Muslims. These have no hope of salvation. He also wrote about non-Muslims who have heard a distorted message: \\"The name of Muhammad has indeed reached their ears, but they do not know his true description and his character. Instead, they heard from the time they were young that a deceitful liar named Muhammad claimed to be a prophet. As far as I am concerned, such people are [excused] like those who the call of Islam has not reached, for while they have heard of the Prophet‚Äôs name, they heard the opposite of his true qualities. And hearing such things would never arouse one‚Äôs desire to find out who he was.\\" Imam Nawawi, an Ash'ari, said in his commentary Sharh Sahih Muslim that those who are born into idolatrous families and die without a message reaching them are granted paradise based upon the Qur'anic verse 17:15: \\"We do not punish a people until a messenger comes to them.\\" According to ibn Taymiyyah, these people who did not receive the message in this world will be tested in the next life. Shi'a View Ayatollah Mahdi Hadavi Tehrani, a prominent Shi'a scholar, coined a unique term, \\"jahil-e-Qasir\\" (literally \\"inculpable ignorant\\") for non-Muslims who are excused for remaining outside of Islam. These are non-Muslims who have not received the message, or it has been presented to them in a distorted, incomplete, or untruthful manner (such as the mainstream media or by sinful Muslims). Such people will attain salvation if they are truthful to their own religion, whatever it may be. Salafi View Muhammad Nasiruddin al-Albani, a salafi scholar, stated on this matter: ‚ÄúThe term Ahl al-Fatrah refers to everyone whom the dawah (message of Islam) has not reached in a correct manner as it came in the Shariah‚Ä¶ Such people will not be punished on the Day of Judgement [for their disbelief in this world]. It is quite possible for People of the Interval to exist in every time period, whether before [the revelation of the final message of] Islam or after. The message has to have reached them in its pristine purity, without any distortions. In cases where the dawah reaches people in a mutilated form in which its essential components; its fundamental principles of belief, have been substituted, I am the first to say that the dawah has not reached them.‚Äù See also * Goy * Fasiq * Kafir * Mu'min * Munafiq * Muslim * People of the Book * Righteous Gentiles * Shirk (Islam) ReferencesExternal links * \\"What if I never heard about Islam?,\\" On Islam Category:Judgment in Islam Category:Islam and other religions Category:Islamic terminology ","title":"Ahl al-Fatrah"},{"id":"3586101","text":"Elizabeth Jean Beattie is a former Australian politician. She was a Labor Party member of the Victorian Legislative Assembly from 1999 to 2014. She represented the electorate of Yuroke from 2002; she previously represented the abolished electorate of Tullamarine. She was the Parliamentary Secretary assisting the Premier on Multicultural Affairs and Veteran Affairs in the Brumby Labor Government. Beattie was born in the Melbourne suburb of Richmond. Prior to entering politics, she worked as an office manager for the Australian Services Union from 1994 to 1996, and as a building manager at Melbourne Trades Hall from 1996 until her election to parliament in 1999. She was also involved in her party's local branches, serving as president of the Labor branch in Sunbury from 1993 to 1998. Beattie was preselected as the Labor candidate for Tullamarine for the 1999 state election, opposing outspoken conservative Bernie Finn. Finn had won the seat, in a traditionally Labor area, in the huge Labor defeat of 1992, and been re-elected in 1996. She won the seat, and served for five terms before retiring from politics at the 2014 Victorian state election.

It was created in 1959 by two soldiers, Private First Class Manfred Bass, sculptor and designer, and Private First Class Karl H. Van Krog, his assistant. The model for the statue was Eugene Wyles, an officer candidate and ten-year Army veteran. It depicts a 1950s-era infantry soldier charging forward and gesturing for others to follow. Originally called The Infantryman, the statue was installed on Eubanks Field on May 3, 1960. In 1964, it was renamed Follow Me and moved in front of Infantry Hall. Some students and graduates of the U.S. Army Infantry School call the statue Iron Mike, after Lieutenant General John W. \\"Iron Mike\\" O'Daniel, but most soldiers use the term Iron Mike to refer to the Airborne Trooper statue at Fort Bragg, North Carolina. Reverse of the statue In 2004, a new bronze version was cast and the original statue was moved to the front of the National Infantry Museum. \\"Follow Me!\\" is also the US Army Infantry motto, attributed to Maj.

Hartley was born in Southern Cross, Western Australia and before his involvement in left-wing politics, he was a Young Liberal and was active in the University of Western Australia's Liberal Club. He also edited the student newspaper. Service in the RAAF in the early 1950s, combined with the Suez crisis and the Split in the Labor movement, radicalised Hartley and he joined the ALP in 1956. After this, he combined his journalism with his new politics, becoming co-editor of the ALP's WA newspaper, the Western Sun. Hartley lost his position as State Secretary when formal intervention in the Victorian branch by the Federal ALP Executive led to the replacement of the Victorian Central Executive of the Party in October 1970. He remained a leading figure within the Victorian ALP's Socialist Left faction until his expulsion in 1986. He was a radio broadcaster from 1978 to 1995 on community radio 3CR with a left-wing programme called Par Avion. He gained later public attention following his involvement with Gough Whitlam and David Combe in attempts to raise large sums of money for the Labor Party from the Iraqi Ba'ath Party (later led by Saddam Hussein) in 1975, and for his outspoken views on a variety of issues, particularly the Middle East conflict. Hartley died in Geraldton, Western Australia, aged 75.

A twinjet or twin-engine jet is a jet aircraft powered by two engines. A twinjet is able to fly well enough to land with a single working engine, making it safer than a single-engine aircraft in the event of failure of an engine. Fuel efficiency of a twinjet is better than that of aircraft with more engines. These considerations have led to the widespread use of aircraft of all types with twin engines, including airliners, fixed-wing military aircraft, and others. Aircraft configurations As of today, there are three most common configurations of twinjet aircraft. The first, common on large aircraft such as airliners, has a podded engine usually mounted beneath, or occasionally above or within, each wing. The second has one engine mounted on each side of the rear fuselage, close to its empennage, used by many business jets. In the third configuration both engines are within the fuselage, side-by-side, used by most fighters since the 1960s. Later fighters using this configuration include the Su-27 'Flanker', the F-15 Eagle, and the F-22 Raptor. History The first twinjet to fly was the German fighter prototype Heinkel He 280, flying in April 1941 with a pair of nacelled Heinkel HeS 8 axial-flow turbojets. The twinjet configuration was used for short-range narrow-bodied aircraft such as the McDonnell Douglas DC-9 and Boeing 737. The Airbus A300 was initially not successful when first produced as a short-range widebody, as airlines operating the A300 on short-haul routes had to reduce frequencies to try and fill the high-capacity aircraft, and lost passengers to airlines operating more frequent narrow-body flights. However, thanks to the introduction of ETOPS rules that allowed twin-engine jets to fly long-distance routes that were previously off-limits to them, Airbus was able to further develop the A300 as a medium- to long-range airliner to increased sales; Boeing launched its widebody twinjet, the Boeing 767, in response. In the 1980s the Boeing 727 was discontinued, as its central engine bay would require a prohibitively expensive redesign to accommodate quieter high-bypass turbofans, and it was soon supplanted by twinjets for the narrow-body market; Airbus with the A320, and Boeing with the 757 and updated \\"classic\\" variants of the 737. During that decade only McDonnell Douglas continued development of the trijet design with an update to the DC-10, the MD-11, which initially had a range advantage over its closest medium wide-body competitors which were twinjets, the in-production Boeing 767 and upcoming Airbus 330. In contrast to McDonnell Douglas sticking with their existing trijet configuration, Airbus (which never produced a trijet aircraft) and Boeing worked on new widebody twinjet designs that would become the Airbus A330 and Boeing 777, respectively. The MD-11's long range advantage was brief as it was soon nullified by the Airbus A330's four-engine derivative, the Airbus A340, and the extended-range Boeing 767-300ER and Boeing 777-200ER. The Boeing 737 twinjet stands out as the most produced jet airliner. The Boeing 777 is the world's largest twinjet, and the 777-200LR variant is the world's longest range airliner. Other Boeing twinjets include the 767, 757 (out of production but still in commercial service) and 787. Competitor Airbus produces the A320 family, the A330, and the A350. Some modern commercial airplanes still use four engines (quad-jets) like the Airbus A380 and Boeing 747-8, which are classified as very large aircraft (over 400 seats in mixed-class configurations). Four engines are still used on the largest cargo aircraft capable of transporting outsize cargo, including strategic airlifters. There are plans to revive production of six-engine giants like the Antonov An-225 Mriya. Efficiency Twin-jets tend to be more fuel-efficient than trijet (three engine) and quad-jet (four engine) aircraft. As fuel efficiency in airliners is a high priority, many airlines have been increasingly retiring trijet and quad-jet designs in favor of twinjets in the twenty-first century. The trijet designs were phased out first, in particular due to the more complicated design and maintenance issues of the middle engine mounted on the stabilizer. Early twinjets were not permitted by ETOPS restrictions to fly long-haul trans-oceanic routes, as it was thought that they were unsafe in the event of failure of one engine, so quad-jets were used. Quad-jets also had higher carrying capacity than comparable earlier twinjets. However, later twinjets such as the Boeing 777, Boeing 787 and Airbus A350 have matched or surpassed older quad-jet designs such as the Boeing 747 and Airbus A340 in these aspects, and twinjets have been more successful in terms of sales than quad-jets. In 2012, Airbus studied a 470-seat twinjet competitor for the B747-8 with lower operating costs expected between 2023 and 2030, revived after Boeing launched the 777X in November 2013, while then-CEO Fabrice Br√©gier preferred to focus on product improvement rather than all-new concepts for 10 years. It would have a 10-abreast economy like the 777; its 565 m2 (6,081 sq ft) wing, slightly more than the 747‚Äì8, would have an 80 m (262 ft) span, as wide as the A380, for a MTOW compared to for the 777X, with a composite structure for an operating empty weight of , and a range at Mach 0.85. ETOPS When flying far from diversionary airports (so called ETOPS/LROPS flights), the aircraft must be able to reach an alternate on the remaining engine within a specified time in case of one engine failure. When aircraft are certified according to ETOPS standards, thrust is not an issue, as one of the engines is more than powerful enough to keep the aircraft aloft (see below). Mostly, ETOPS certification involves maintenance and design requirements ensuring that a failure of one engine cannot make the other one fail also. The engines and related systems need to be independent and (in essence) independently maintained. ETOPS/LROPS is often incorrectly thought to apply only to long overwater flights, but it applies to any flight more than a specified distances from an available diversion airport. Overwater flights near diversion airports need not be ETOPS/LROPS-compliant. Introduction to transoceanic flights Since the 1990s, airlines have increasingly turned from four-engine or three-engine airliners to twin-engine airliners to operate transatlantic and transpacific flight routes. On a nonstop flight from America to Asia or Europe, the long-range aircraft usually follows the great circle route. Hence, in case of an engine failure in a twinjet (like Boeing 777), it is never too far from an emergency landing field in Canada, Alaska, eastern Russia, Greenland, Iceland, or the British Isles. The Boeing 777 has also been approved by the Federal Aviation Administration for flights between North America and Hawaii, which is the world's longest regular airline route with no diversion airports along the way. Other advantages On large passenger jets, the cost of the engines makes up a significant proportion of the plane's final cost. Each engine also requires separate service, paperwork, and certificates. Thus, having two larger engines as opposed to three or four smaller engines will significantly reduce both the purchase and maintenance costs of a plane. However, relative costs of two engines is double the cost of one engine. Regulations governing the required thrust levels for transport aircraft are typically based upon the requirement that an aircraft be able to continue a takeoff if an engine fails after the takeoff decision speed is reached. Thus, with all engines operating, trijets must be able to produce at least 150% of the minimum thrust required to climb and quad-jets 133%. Conversely, since a twinjet will lose half of its total thrust if an engine fails, they are required to produce 200% of the minimum thrust required to climb when both engines are operating. Because of this, twinjets typically have higher thrust-to-weight ratios than aircraft with more engines, and are thus able to accelerate and climb faster.

There is a cluster of related ideas, and many philosophers use the terms differently. On one common usage: * Two values (for example, freedom and security) are incommensurable when they cannot be 'traded off' against each other: for example, if there is no set amount of freedom that would compensate for a certain loss of security, or vice versa. * Two options or choices are incommensurate or incomparable if and only if: it is not true that one is better, that the other is better, or that they are exactly equally good. This page is concerned almost entirely with the second phenomenon. For clarity, the term 'incomparable' is used.  Trichotomous Comparisons and Small Improvement Arguments  In terminology due to Ruth Chang, the three trichotomous comparisons are betterness, worseness, and equal goodness. For example, one artist, drawing, or cup of coffee might be better or worse than another, or precisely equally as good as it. When two items are incomparable, none of the trichotomous comparisons holds between them (or at least it seems that way). The clearest way of arguing that two options are incomparable is a small improvement argument. The purpose of such examples is to show that none of the trichotomous comparisons apply. Here is an example. Suppose that (for you, taking everything into account), a certain job as a professor and a certain job as a banker are such that neither seems better than the other. The professor job offers more freedom and security, and the banking job offers more money and excitement. But we might say that though they are good in different ways, they are just too different to be compared with one of the trichotomous comparisons. Let's suppose that this means that the banking job is not better, and the professor job is not better. This seems to rule out two of the three trichotomous comparisons. But what about the third? Might the jobs be exactly equally good? The small improvement argument is supposed to show that they could not. Suppose for the sake of argument that they are precisely equally good. Suppose also that in order to tempt you, the bankers offer you a tiny pay rise, perhaps 5 cents a year. This new banking job (often called 'banking+') is clearly better than banking, albeit only by a tiny amount. You could (under normal circumstances) never rationally choose banking over banking+: they are the same in every way, except that the latter pays more. Here is the crux of the small improvement argument: if banking is exactly equally as good as professor, and banking+ is better than banking, then banking+ must be better than professor. But this seems very implausible: if banking and professor were so different that we could not say that professor is better, and we could not say that banking is better, then how could adding 5 cents a year to a huge salary make the difference? This seems to show that one of our assumptions was incorrect. Defenders of incomparability will say it is most plausible that it is the assumption that banking and philosophy are equally good that is incorrect. So they conclude that this assumption as false, and thus that none of the trichotomous comparisons apply.  Theories of Incommensurability  There are four main philosophical accounts of incommensurability/incomparability. Their task is to explain (or explain away) the phenomenon, and the small improvement argument. Some philosophers are pluralists about the phenomenon: they think that (for example) genuine incomparability might be the correct account in some cases, and parity in others. One way to understand the difference between the theories is to see how they respond to the small-improvement argument.  Epistemicism about incomparability  One possibility is that this is all a mistake: that there is no genuine incomparability, and when it seems like none of the three trichotomous comparisons apply, in fact one of them does but we do not know which. This is where the small-improvement argument goes wrong: one of the trichotomous comparisons does apply between banking and philosophy. According to this view, apparent incomparability is merely ignorance. An advantage of this account is that the various puzzles surrounding incomparability dissolve rather quickly. Choice between incomparable options is no more than choice between options when we do not know which is better. The main objection to this kind of view is that it seems very implausible, for similar reasons to epistemicism about vagueness. In particular, it is hard to see how we could be ignorant of the kinds of facts involved in incomparability.  Genuine Incomparability  Joseph Raz has argued that in cases of incomparability, no comparison applies. Neither option is better, and they are not equally good. On this view, the small-improvement argument is sound.  Parity  Ruth Chang has argued that (at least some of the time), options may be comparable even if they are not trichotomously comparable. She does this by denying that the three trichotomous comparisons are the only ones on offer. She defends the existence of a fourth comparison, which she calls 'parity'. Luke Elson has criticised this argument, claiming that the apparent possibility of parity is really an artefact of the vagueness of the (trichotomous) comparisons involved.  Incomparability as Vagueness  Finally, a set of philosophers led by John Broome has argued that incomparability is vagueness. This theory says that it is vague or indeterminate which trichotomous comparison applies. The argument for this position is complex, and how 'incomparability as vagueness' is to be understood depends on one's theory of vagueness. But the main idea behind the theory is fairly simple. What is the precise minimum number of grains of sand needed to count as a heap, or hairs required to count as non-bald? If there is no precise number, only a rough range, then these are instances of vagueness. On one set of theories of vagueness, it is indeterminate how many heaps or hairs are required. Perhaps our language simply does not specify a sharp boundary. In the small-improvement argument, the incomparability as vagueness view might say that it is indeterminate whether banking is better or worse than philosophy, or precisely equally good. One taxonomic complication is distinguishing the view that incomparability is vagueness, combined with epistemicism about vagueness, from epistemicism about incomparability.  Philosophical Implications of Incomparability  Incomparability has figured prominently in several philosophical debates concerning moral and rational action. In general, incomparability can add complications to any view according to which one ought to do the best thing that one can, or the better of two options. If the options are incomparable, it may be that neither is better. (Depending on which view of incomparability is true.)  Morality  Consequentialists think that the morally right thing to do is what promotes the most overall good. But if two actions produce incomparable outcomes, it may be that neither is better. The topic of incommensurability has also frequently arisen in discussions of the version of natural law theory associated with John Finnis and others.  Rational Choice  Joseph Raz has argued that incommensurability undermines the 'rationalistic' view of human action according to which distinctively rational action is doing what one has most reason to do.'Incommensurability and Agency' in the Chang book. Philosophical reflection about practical reason typically aims for a description of the principles relevant in answering the question, \\"What is to be done in this or that circumstance?\\" On one popular view, answers to this question can be found by comparing the relative strengths of the various values or norms in play in some given situation. For example, if one is trying to decide on some nice afternoon whether they should stay in to do work or go for a walk, on this view of practical reason they will compare the merits of these two options. If going for a walk is the better or more reasonable course of action, they should put aside their books and go for a stroll. The topic of incommensurability‚Äîand the topic of incomparability in particular‚Äîis especially important to those who advocate this view of practical reason. For if one's options in certain circumstances are of incomparable value, he or she cannot settle the question of what to do by choosing the better option. When the competing options are incomparable, then by definition neither is better than the other.

Her acting career spanned the decades immediately before, during, and after World War II. Her tremendous commercial success and wide fan base before the war led to her being considered the original superstar of Philippine movies. Her stage name, Carmen Rosales, was taken from her hometown of Carmen, Rosales, Philippines. Early life Januaria Constantino Keller was born in Carmen, Rosales, Pangasinan, Insular Government of the Philippine Islands of the US to Pantale√≥n Keller Rosles, her father who was of Swedish ethnicity and Filipina mother, Pilar Constantino y de la Cruz. Pilar Constantino y de la Cruz was born April 13, 1872, in Quingua, Bulacan, Captaincy General of the Philippines, Spanish East Indies of the Spanish Empire. Acting career Rosales' film debut was in the 1938 movie Mahiwagang Binibini, based on the Zarsuela play of Atang dela Rama, Ang Kiri. When her friend brought her to Quisumbing, he rejected the young woman for not having the bearing of an actress. Nonetheless, Rosales became one of the most famous Filipina actresses in the 1940s and 1950s, rivalling Rosa del Rosario at the box-office. She is famous for her sweet voice and numerous recordings. Rosales made her debut in Ang Kiri (The Flirt) produced by Diwata Pictures. She starred in her first leading role opposite Jose Padilla Jr in Arimunding-Munding (1939). She became the most bankable star in Sampaguita Pictures. In 1949, she became the highest-paid movie star when LVN Pictures offered her the unprecedented sum of P45,000 to team up again with Rogelio dela Rosa in Kampanang Ginto, followed by Camelia, then Sipag at Yaman with Jose Padilla, Jr. and Batalyon Trece with Jaime dela Rosa. Among her unforgettable roles included the spurned lover of Rogelio dela Rosa in Maalaala Mo Kaya (1954) and a club-singer in Ang Tangi Kong Pag-ibig. She received her first Famas Award in 1954 for her role in Inspirasyon opposite Van de Leon. She was similarly awarded in 1960 for playing a strict matron in Estela Mondragon. She garnered fame playing a hacendera in Pablo Gomez's version of MN. Her last public appearance was in Inday Badiday's Eye to Eye.  World War II guerrilla activities  Rosales' husband Ramon was killed by Japanese forces early in the Japanese Occupation of the Philippines during World War II. As a result, she decided to join a guerrilla group and fight the Japanese. She joined the Hukbong Bayan Laban sa Hapon forces, and became a sharpshooter. She was known for wearing a false mustache during guerrilla raids, in an effort to disguise herself. The original \\"queen of Philippine movies\\" Arguably, she was the \\"queen of Philippine movies\\" in the 1940s. The films in which she was top-billed aided in the popularity of emerging actresses like Gloria Romero, Amalia Fuentes and Susan Roces, who all became movie queens themselves decades later.  Death  She died on December 11, 1991 of kidney malfunction in Mandaluyong City, Philippines. Legacy A barrio in Rosales, Pangasinan was named after her. It is now currently divided into two barangays, Carmen East and Carmen West.

He was based in Abadi√¢nia, Brazil, where he ran the Casa de Dom In√°cio de Loyola, a \\"spiritual healing center\\". He has received media coverage on CNN, ABC news and the Oprah Winfrey show, amongst others. James Randi and Joe Nickell have exposed his healing procedures as involving nothing more than carnival tricks, and there is no evidence that the benefits that have been reported by patients are anything more than placebo effects. In 2018, after over 600 accusations of sexual abuse, he turned himself in to police. In December 2019 he was sentenced to 19 years and four months for the rapes of four different women. On 20 January 2020, Faria was sentenced to an additional 40 years in prison for rape against 5 women.https://www1.folha.uol.com.br/cotidiano/2020/01/joao- de-deus-e-condenado-a-40-anos-de-prisao-em-regime-fechado.shtml This is the third conviction of the accused.

Faria has no medical training and describes himself as a \\"simple farmer\\". He completed two years of education and spent a number of years travelling from village to village in the states of Goi√°s and Minas Gerais. Abadi√¢nia Faria says he was told by his spirit guides that he must expand his work to reach more people and spiritist medium Chico Xavier told him he should go to the small Goi√°s town of Abadi√¢nia to fulfill his healing mission. Around 1978, when Jo√£o first performed healings there, he just sat outdoors in a chair near the main road where people began to arrive seeking cures for their illnesses and conditions. Gradually the numbers increased to thousands per day and he developed his centre, Casa de Dom In√°cio de Loyola. The Casa de Dom In√°cio de Loyola has since been visited by millions of people seeking healing. He also owns a nearby cattle ranch, which covers about 1,000 acres and is valued at over 2 million reais. Much of his income comes from selling passionflower preparations, the single herb prescribed by Faria to cure a variety of ailments. The company which bears Jo√£o Teixeira Faria's initials, JTF Ltda., markets the drug and is registered in the name of his wife, Ana Keyla Teixeira, and his driver and employee Abadio da Cruz. In 2015, Faria was diagnosed with an aggressive stomach cancer. In August 2015, a doctor of conventional medicine, Raul Cutait, extracted a malignant tumor of 6 cm - a gastric adenocarcinoma. The surgery and follow-up of 5 months of chemotherapy took place at the Hospital S√≠rio-Liban√™s in S√£o Paulo. Faria did not report these facts to the public, originally saying he was being hospitalised for a stomach hernia. Claims of spiritual healing powers Jo√£o on stage after performing a \\"psychic surgery\\" Faria regularly prescribes meditation and walks to a nearby waterfall as part of treatment. The Casa also sells herbs, blessed items and artefacts such as magic triangles. It was estimated by 60 Minutes Australia in 2014 that these sales earn Faria over $10 million per year. When called for a spiritual surgery by Faria, patients are offered the choice of \\"visible\\" or \\"invisible\\" operations. If they select an \\"invisible\\" operation (or are younger than 18 or older than 52) they are directed to sit in a room and meditate. Faria says that spiritual physicians can perform surgery on the actual patient via a surrogate when the actual patient is unable to make the trip. A very small percentage of people choose a \\"visible\\" operation where Faria operates without traditional anesthetic. Instead he says he uses \\"energized\\" mineral water and the spiritual energies present, the latter of which are provided by groups of volunteers who meditate in a separate room called the \\"current room\\". These practices, such as inserting scissors or forceps deep into a nose and scraping an eye without an anesthetic or antiseptics, have been scrutinised by medical authorities and skeptical investigators such as James Randi, who has called for Faria to stop victimizing people with stunts and trickery. Faria tells people not to stop taking their medicine and says not everyone he serves will be cured. Often the treatment includes capsules containing pure passion flower that he says carry special blessed spiritual energy to support the individual's healing process. Faria has undergone trials and scrutiny of his work. He has been arrested several times for practicing medicine without a licence and has been jailed once. Outside Brazil Faria has travelled to other countries to perform healing ceremonies called Live Events. Gail Thackray, Casa Medium, said in her book Spiritual Journeys: Visiting John of God that the main entities that incorporate in Brazil are the same ones at Live Events, along with thousands of other entities doing healing work. Because of the medical laws around the world, blessed water is prescribed instead of herbs. It is available for about $3 a bottle. Everyone who receives a spiritual intervention must drink this blessed water. Media coverage=ABC news report On 14 July 2005, the American Broadcasting Company (ABC) ran a news report about Faria on Primetime Live. The programme featured five people with various medical conditions, including chronic fatigue syndrome, Lou Gehrig's disease and an inoperable brain tumour. Each patient saw Faria and ABC claimed that in three of the cases there had been an improvement. A young female athlete who had been paraplegic was shown beginning to move her legs. ABC's update on the five subjects, while not mentioning subject Mary Hendrickson, indicated that one subject is making either slow progress or none at all, two are worse, and one shows improvement. Subject David Ames died from complications on 16 July 2008. Despite undergoing Faria's psychic surgery and being declared cured, Lisa Melman's breast cancer got progressively worse. She stated the tumor had grown and became painful. She continued to suffer and died in 2012.Lisa Melman Obit, March 2012 http://www.sajr.co.za/docs/default- source/pdf/2012/2012-03/16-march-2012.pdf?sfvrsn=2 Skeptic James Randi spent about an hour in New York being interviewed and taped for the report. Randi later criticised ABC for having cherry-picked his comments to show more credibility for Faria than was justified. Randi gave scientific explanations for all the activities observed. Randi revealed the natural explanations for activities ranging from putting forceps in the nose, random cutting of the flesh, 'scraping' of the eyeball, the subsequent absence of infection, and other activities one by one as age old parlor tricks. However, he was dismayed that none of his critical comments were shown in the final segment. This was cut down to under 20 seconds of screen time. The Oprah Winfrey Show 2010 Show 'Leap of Faith: Meet John of God On 17 November 2010, Susan Casey wrote in O Magazine about her trip to see Faria in Brazil and was subsequently covered on The Oprah Winfrey Show. The article was entitled \\"Leap of Faith: Meet John of God\\". The show was entitled \\"Do You Believe in Miracles?\\". In both, she discusses her need to deal with the traumatic loss of her father. After he suddenly died in 2008, Casey experienced a \\"tsunami of grief\\" that she says she couldn't escape from. She wondered if Faria could help heal her grief. She met him twice and later stated, \\"Three hours went by like 20 minutes, and it was blissful--it was like I was floating.\\" Casey claims she was able to speak with her dead father. \\"It was very real,\\" she says. \\"More of a vision than I had ever had before. ... I got this feeling like I shouldn't be sad, that everything was okay.\\" While Casey stated that the whole experience sounds unusual, she said that she is \\"not a woo-woo person\\" and that Faria helped her find healing. Casey stated that she was a neutral observer. Jeff Rediger, a psychiatrist from Harvard Medical School in Boston, was provided as a \\"skeptic\\". Rediger was astonished to discover bleeding from his torso after \\"invisible\\" surgery. The show did not provide scientific or medical explanations for the procedures performed. In depth critical investigative reports followed the broadcast. 2013 Oprah's Next Chapter: 'John of God' On 17 March 2013, Oprah's Next Chapter, Season 2, Episode 116, aired a televised show entitled 'John of God'. Oprah traveled to Brazil to meet and talk with Faria. She also interviewed Magnus Kemppii, from Sweden, about his 'surgery', and five Americans who hope to be cured from their ailments. In December 2018, Faria was accused of sexual abuse, rape and pedophilia by more than 200 women. After the allegations became public, Oprah deleted the interviews from her site and released a note stating that she hopes justice will be served.. CNN coverage On the 22 December 2010, episode of CNN's AC360, Sanjay Gupta interviewed two of the commentators Oprah Winfrey had sent to meet Faria. Critical investigative reports followed the broadcast. 2014 60 Minutes Australia Faria's first visit to Australia and a 'Live Event' scheduled 22‚Äì24 November 2014 at the Sydney Showground in Sydney Olympic Park garnered much media attention. After visiting Faria at his \\"Casa\\" in Abadi√¢nia, Brazil, the Australian 60 Minutes television program aired a critical investigative report on 25 October 2014, examining Faria's healing treatment practices, the amount of money being made and raising questions about sexual assault allegations against him. The two-part program hosted by reporter Michael Usher was a follow-up to Liz Hayes' 1998 investigation of Faria. In Part 1 of the follow-up, reporter Michael Usher revealed that a woman declared as cured of breast cancer by a spirit entity channeled by Faria died in 2003. A woman in a wheelchair with multiple sclerosis, who in the 1998 report said she visited Faria with the expectation of walking again, didn't feel any effect, is still in a wheelchair, and suffered a deterioration in her condition. Her trip to the Casa cost $5,000. Usher reported that none of the other people (forty Australians) who made the pilgrimage that Hayes joined for investigation improved. Usher's report said that some of the thousands in Faria's audience hope to receive \\"spiritual surgery\\" from him. In an extended interview, emergency medicine specialist Dr. David Rosengren personally examined and reported these practices as horrendous and barbaric, saying: \\"‚Ä¶ the modern medical world could not condone this behavior in any way whatsoever\\". The possibility of Faria coming to Australia had also concerned the Australian Medical Association.The Australian, cited in John of God In Part 2 of his report, Usher stated that there were two deaths in recent years at the Casa that warranted investigations, but no one was charged. He also reported that in 2010, when Faria visited Sedona, Arizona, the police department investigated him because a woman said he took her hands and placed them on his genitals. The case never went to court; one of his associates encouraged the woman to drop the allegations. The Catholic Church, through its representative Rev. Brian Lucas, issued an televised verbal warning, stating \\"John of God doesn't have any official affiliation with the Catholic Church\\". He cautioned all to be very skeptical of people seeking publicity with claims of miracles and faith healing, more so when there is a lot of money involved. 2016 Montreal Gazette On 22 July 2016, The Montreal Gazette published a report on John of God, \\"Brazilian 'healer' John of God leads cancer patients by the nose\\", by columnist Joe Schwarcz, accompanied by a video report from 'Dr Joe's' The Right Chemistry series. Schwarcz is an author and a professor at McGill University in Montreal, Quebec. He is the director of McGill's Office for Science & Society, which aims to demystify science for the public. The report starts by detailing Faria's life history as a medium and psychic surgeon. It then examines his practice and supposed treatments, such as the 'Up Your Nose' surgery to treat cancers. Schwarcz also criticised Faria's choices of treatment for his own health problems. 2018 sexual abuse allegations, arrest and 2019 guilty verdict and 19 year imprisonment sentence Twelve women initially alleged that Faria abused them. The case was reported in media outlets in Brazil and around the world. The number of claims led to the Prosecution Office of the State of Goi√°s creating an e-mail address and phone line to receive all accusations towards the medium. In 30 hours, more than 200 complaints were received, from 9 different states, including two claims from outside of Brazil. Claims were reported by the prosecution's office as having potential to be the biggest sexual scandal in the history of Brazil, overwhelming the Roger Abdelmassih scandal. Claims allege abuse of victims as young as 14 years old, as well as a woman that revealed having being abused for three days. In 11 December, four days after the \\"Conversa com Bial\\" show, the number of sexual abuse complaints against the medium had reached 206, in multiple Brazilian states, leading to Faria limiting his appointments at Casa Dom In√°cio de Loyola. Questioned by reporters, the medium only said \\"I'm innocent\\" and walked away amid the protection of people around him. On 12 December 2018, the public prosecutor of the Brazilian state of Goi√°s called for the arrest of Faria after allegations of sexual abuse. On 16 December 2018, Jo√£o de Deus surrendered himself to the police near the city of Abadi√¢nia, in the state of Goi√°s, Brazil. The number of sexual abuse accusations has reached 600, and, as of May 2019, he was in a hospital after having been transferred there from prison in March 2019. On 19 December 2019 he was sentenced to 19 years and four months for the rapes of four women. He is facing additional cases related to 10 sex crimes.https://www.smh.com.au/world/south-america/brazilian-spiritual-healer- john-of-god-jailed-for-rapes-20191220-p53lz3.html His own daughter, Dalva Teixeira, 49, stands among the accusers and called him a \\"monster\\" and alleged she was beaten and raped by the medium until she ran away when she was 14 years old.

It has been said that his vault contains multiple unreleased albums and over 50 fully produced music videos that have never been released, along with albums and other media. The following is a list, in rough chronological order, of the most prominent of these unreleased works. Many were later released and circulated among collectors as bootlegs. The Rebels Before Prince formed The Time, he considered using his backing band as a side-project called The Rebels. The 1979 project was a group effort, with songs being written and sung by the various members (only Bobby Z and Dr. Fink did not sing). Andr√© Cymone and Dez Dickerson each contributed material and a few numbers were sung by Gayle Chapman. Instead of making something that sounded similar to his R&B; solo output, Prince wanted go into more rock elements of songs such like \\"I'm Yours\\" and \\"Bambi\\". The project was eventually shelved feeling that the whole thing sounded too generic, but two of the songs composed by Prince were re-recorded and released much later: \\"If I Love U 2 Night\\" by Mica Paris (and later by Prince's wife-to-be Mayte Garcia) and \\"You\\" (renamed \\"U\\") by Paula Abdul. The original Prince guide vocal for \\"If I Love U 2 Nite\\" appeared by mistake on the rare Mica Paris Stand for Love EP, of which only a handful exist. From 10‚Äì21 July 1979, the band recorded nine tracks together at Mountain Ears Sound Studio, Boulder, CO, USA: * \\"Too Long\\" * \\"Disco Away\\" * \\"Thrill You or Kill You\\" * \\"You\\" * \\"If I Love You Tonight\\" * \\"The Loser\\" * \\"Hard to Get\\" * Untitled instrumental by Dez Dickerson * Untitled instrumental by Andr√© Cymone No further sessions under the name \\"The Rebels\\" are known to have taken place. The Second Coming The Second Coming was planned to be a documentary film and live album from Prince's Controversy Tour directed by Chuck Statler, that was shot on the 7 March 1982 concert at Bloomington, Minnesota. The tour was professionally filmed, with a storyline between songs, but the project was abandoned, likely due to Prince's schedule producing The Time and Vanity 6. The title comes from a prerecorded a cappella intro to the tour, immediately preceding the song \\"Uptown\\".

It was directed by Brian Thomson, an Australian production designer of the original stage versions of The Rocky Horror Show and Jesus Christ Superstar, and scripted by Keith Williams (concept writer for music videos by Phil Collins, Ray Parker, Jr., and Donna Summer), with a cast comprising Ricky Nelson (as \\"Mr. Christian\\"), Edy Williams and Buck Henry. Shot in a Los Angeles film studio in 1985, and produced by British video firm Limelight, the video never went beyond the rough-cut stage. The songs featured on the film are \\"Happy Birthday, Mr. Christian\\", \\"Sex Shooter\\", \\"Blue Limousine\\" and \\"Ooo She She Wa Wa\\". The plot introduced three lingerie clad widows gathered to listen the reading of Mr. Christian's will and testament which leaves them nothing and encourages them to work. The imagery and set is very 1960's revamped into 1980's colorful graphic trends. The scenes show prominent neon words such as 'FILL' at a gas station for \\"Blue Limousine\\", where Brenda Bennett has the main vocal role, 'EAT' at a diner for \\"Ooo She Wa Wa\\", where Susan Moonsie leads while the two others find themselves struggling in front of piles of dirty dishes to wash. The part featuring Apollonia in the leading role features the word 'BUY' in a supermarket set. The Flesh The Flesh was a project of live jam sessions recorded in late 1985 to early 1986. The project was abandoned when Prince began work on Parade although a small instrumental portion of a track called \\"Junk Music\\" made it into the film Under the Cherry Moon. A circulating outtake from these sessions is titled \\"U Got 2 Shake Something\\". The Flesh was a kind of precursor to Madhouse. All the tracks were jazz-funk instrumentals. The songs were recorded in 3 sessions soon after Christmas 1985 at Sunset Sound. The first session was on December 28 '85: Prince, Eric Leeds, Sheila E. and Levi Seacer, Jr. recorded 8 tracks: * \\"Slaughterhouse\\" * \\"U Just Can't Stop\\" * \\"Run Amok\\" * \\"Mobile\\" * \\"Madrid\\" * \\"Breathless\\" * \\"High Calonic\\" * \\"12 Keys\\" Prince was so pleased with the results that they all returned to the studio 2 days later to record another 3 tracks: * \\"U Gotta Shake Something\\" * \\"Voodoo Who\\" * \\"Finest Whiskey\\" On January 5 '86, Prince, Eric, Sheila and Levi returned to the studio once more, this time with Wendy & Lisa, and Wendy's brother, Jonathan Melvoin. They recorded another 6 tracks: * \\"Groove In C Minor\\" * \\"Slow Groove In G Major\\" * \\"Groove In G Flat Minor\\" * \\"Junk Music\\" * \\"Up From Below\\" * \\"Y'all Want Some More\\" On January 22 '86 Prince assembled an album by \\"The Flesh\\" entitled Junk Music which consisted of the following tracks: ;Side one *\\"Junk Music\\" ;Side two *\\"Up From Below\\" *\\"Y'all Want Some More\\" *\\"A Couple Of Miles\\" \\"Junk Music\\" was originally about 45 minutes long, but was edited down to 20 minutes for the album (a little of it can be heard in Under The Cherry Moon during the scene where Christopher Tracy races Mary) . \\"A Couple Of Miles\\" was an instrumental that Prince recorded on December 26 '85 (he also recorded \\"Can I Play With U\\" in the same session), Eric Leeds added some saxophone to it on December 30. The album was shelved due to the fact that Prince's time was taken up with other projects (Under The Cherry Moon, Parade and The Family). Prince liked the idea of releasing an instrumental jazz-funk album under a pseudonym. He finally got round to it in '87, but renamed the project Madhouse and ditched the old Flesh tracks in favor of fresh new recordings. Prince and the Revolution: Dream Factory Dream Factory was a single, then double LP project recorded with The Revolution from 1986. Revolution albums, the entire band was invited into the studio and contributed to most of the original tracks, so it meant that the songs would either be full band performances, solo recordings by Prince or largely recorded by Prince with certain members contributing, namely Wendy Melvoin and Lisa Coleman. Many of the tracks would later be incorporated into Crystal Ball (see below) or be released through other outlets over the years.

This album cover is attributed to The Flesh rather than Prince and The Revolution. Camille Camille is an unreleased album by Prince, recorded in 1986. The album was planned to consist of 8 tracks recorded by the singer in a feminine, sped up vocal. The album was to be released under the name Camille (who would not be pictured on the cover) and not as a Prince album. The album was canceled weeks prior to its release and most of the tracks were incorporated into the unreleased album Crystal Ball, which evolved into Sign o' the Times . Most of the music has been released officially in some form or another, however, one song, \\"Rebirth of the Flesh\\" remains unreleased in its original form. In 2001, a live rehearsal of \\"Rebirth of the Flesh\\" recorded with the Sign o' the Times band was released on Prince's website. This version, however, had profanity edited from the lyrics. Side one * \\"Rebirth of the Flesh\\": Prince recorded this song at Sunset Sound on October 28, 1986, on the same day as \\"Rockhard in a Funky Place\\". When the Camille album was shelved, the song was slated for inclusion on Prince's next album project, Crystal Ball. It was going to be the opening track segueing into \\"Play in the Sunshine\\". The NPG Music Club made a 1988 Lovesexy Tour rehearsal recording available in September 2001, marking the point at which all the Camille tracks have now been officially released in some form, although the original studio version only circulates on bootlegs. * \\"Housequake\\": significantly remixed for Sign \\"‚òÆ\\" the Times. * \\"Strange Relationship\\": Reworked from the Dream Factory sessions and released unedited on Sign \\"‚òÆ\\" the Times. * \\"Feel U Up\\": This outtake was recorded in November of 1981 and was taped in a different session sequence from \\"Irresistible Bitch\\". Both songs were re-recorded later. \\"Feel U Up\\" was re-recorded on October 27, 1986 and the lyrics of both recordings are very similar. The track was finally released in 1989 as the B-side of \\"Partyman\\". Side two * \\"Shockadelica\\": Originally written (unsolicited) by Prince in response to Jesse Johnson's then-forthcoming album titled Shockadelica (1986) because that album had no song to match/complement what Prince felt was such a great album title. \\"Shockadelica\\" was later included as a B-side of \\"If I Was Your Girlfriend\\". * \\"Good Love\\": Later released on the Bright Lights, Big City film soundtrack in 1988, then compiled on Crystal Ball. * \\"If I Was Your Girlfriend\\": released with an added intro on Sign \\"‚òÆ\\" the Times. * \\"Rockhard in a Funky Place\\": Included on The Black Album (1987) project, which was ultimately released in 1994. Two other songs were credited to Camille after the album project was abandoned. The first was \\"Scarlet Pussy\\", which was released as the B-side of the 1988 single \\"I Wish U Heaven\\" featuring a black label with the artist Camille credited in deep peach. The song was also submitted for Sheila E's upcoming 4th album, however the album went unreleased. Also, \\"U Got the Look\\", which appeared on Sign \\"‚òÆ\\" the Times and was also released as a single. The video was recorded in France while Prince was on tour and the video was later added into the film Sign \\"‚òÆ\\" the Times. Prince would later resurrect the character of Camille for the 1988 Lovesexy tour. Within the show, Camille sang in a low tone, with Prince's vocal filtered to sound lower. Prince has used this technique on numerous occasions, uncredited to Camille. Prince confirmed in the Lovesexy tour book that Camille is the creator of The Black Album. Crystal Ball Crystal Ball was a 3-LP set to be released in 1986, The set was to consist of various tracks from 1985‚Äì1986. Although several Dream Factory tracks were incorporated, this set was to be marketed as a solo album by Prince. Warner Bros. Records balked at the album's length so Prince begrudgingly trimmed it to the 2-LP Sign \\"‚òÆ\\" the Times, which many still consider to be his best album (although Purple Rain was his most successful). The album is notable for two reasons; it was the last studio album to be recorded with The Revolution and the events said to have surrounded its recording led to the resignation of both Wendy & Lisa, effectively dissolving Prince's band until the creation of the New Power Generation.

The album has never materialized. Some of the tracks were altered (in fact, only 21 \\"The Dopamine Rush\\") and reused on Eric Leeds's Times Squared album released in 1991. A totally different version of 24 was recorded with members of The New Power Generation and Eric Leeds in 1993, but this also was not released, with the exception of the track \\"17\\" of the 1-800-NEW-FUNK compilation album. Some of the tracks were on the rare \\"The Versace Experience\\" cassette. Both versions of the album circulate on the internet.

The album was abandoned when Sheila E. left Paisley Park Records in early 1989, and most of the album's tracks remain unreleased. The only track from the album to have been released is \\"Scarlet Pussy\\" (credited to Camille), which was included as the b-side of \\"I Wish U Heaven\\". The album included a cover of Donny Hathaway's \\".The Ghetto\\". Two other tracks were resurrected for later projects, however. In mid-September, 1993, \\"Latino Barbie Doll\\" was tried out for Mayte during initial sessions for her solo debut album, and was included on an initial configuration of the album, titled Latino Barbie Doll, before being removed from later configurations as the album developed into Child of the Sun. During the A Celebration week in June, 2000, computer screens at Paisley Park Studios offered names of a selection of tracks which users could vote on for inclusion on Crystal Ball Volume II; \\"3 Nigs Watchin' a Kung Fu Movie\\" was included on the list and was chosen by fans, the project was ultimately abandoned. Track listing Side one * \\"3 Nigs Watchin' a Kung Fu Movie\\" * \\"It's a Hard Life\\" (includes no Prince input) * \\"Chicken Legs\\" (includes no Prince input) * \\"Knucklehead\\" * \\"Latino Barbie Doll\\" Side two * \\"Soul Company\\" * \\"Day After Day\\" (includes no Prince input) * \\"Girl Power\\" * \\"The Ghetto\\" * \\"Scarlet Pussy\\" The Time: Corporate World An unreleased studio album by The Time, recorded in Summer 1989 and planned for release in November, 1989. Like previous albums by The Time, all tracks featured Prince heavily as unique writer and musician, with Morris Day adding vocals as the only member of the band to appear on the album. The album was submitted to Warner Bros., and planned for release on 14 November 1989, with \\"Nine Lives\\" planned as the first single. Warner Bros. stopped the release, however, feeling that other members of the band should be brought in to contribute to the album. Following a meeting with Prince, the band members Jesse Johnson, Monte Moir, Terry Lewis and Jimmy Jam began contributing songs to the album without input by Prince, as well as revising \\"Chocolate\\" and \\"Jerk Out\\" (composed by Prince); the resulting album became The Time's fourth album Pandemonium. Of the tracks included on Corporate World, three tracks were kept for Pandemonium: \\"Donald Trump (Black Version)\\", \\"Data Bank\\" and \\"My Summertime Thang\\". Four other tracks were kept as The Time's contribution to Prince's twelfth album Graffiti Bridge: \\"Love Machine\\", \\"Shake!\\", \\"The Latest Fashion\\" and \\"Release It\\". \\"Murph Drag\\" was included on NPG Ahdio Show #3 in 2001, but was not available as a separate track. Only \\"Nine Lives\\" and \\"Corporate World\\" have not been released in any form.

The album shared some tracks with Graffiti Bridge and was to be a house music album; the title track was finally released in 1999 slightly remixed on a new album of the same name. Track listings 27 October 1988 configuration The specific sequence of tracks are unknown, but tracks known to have been included are: * \\"The Voice Inside\\" * \\"Melody Cool\\" (an updated version with Mavis Staples lead vocals was released on Graffiti Bridge) * \\"Rave unto the Joy Fantastic\\" (an edited and reworked version released on Rave Un2 the Joy Fantastic) * \\"God is Alive\\" * \\"If I Had a Harem\\" * \\"Stimulation\\" * \\"Still Would Stand All Time\\" (a version with background vocals overdubs by The Steeles over Prince's original background vocals was released on Graffiti Bridge) * \\"Elephants & Flowers\\" (an other version with different verses was released on Graffiti Bridge) * \\"Big House\\" * \\"We Got the Power\\" (sampled in Batdance Bat Mix) No details are known about the sequence, other than that \\"The Voice Inside\\" is known to have segued into \\"Melody Cool\\". 27 November 1988 configuration # \\"Rave unto the Joy Fantastic\\" # \\"If I Had a Harem\\" # \\"The Voice Inside\\" # \\"Melody Cool\\" # \\"Stimulation\\" # \\"Elephants & Flowers\\" # \\"God is Alive\\" # \\"Still Would Stand All Time\\" Mid-January 1989 configuration # \\"Rave unto the Joy Fantastic\\" # \\"If I Had a Harem\\" # \\"Good Judy Girlfriend\\" (a re-recording by Carmen Electra was released on her only album Carmen Electra) # \\"Pink Cashmere\\" (released on The Hits/The B-Sides) # \\"Electric Chair\\" (released on Batman) # \\"Am I without U?\\" # \\"God is Alive\\" # \\"Still Would Stand All Time\\" (released on Graffiti Bridge) # \\"Moonbeam Levels\\" (released on Prince 4Ever) Flash In 1989, Prince formed a new band called Flash / MC Flash (both names were considered for use), featuring Margie Cox (of Ta Mara and the Seen) as lead singer. In July, Cox recorded 25 songs written by Prince for a planned album. No M.C. Flash album or singles were ever released. The only songs to be released as a result of Prince and Cox's work together was her cover of Prince's \\"Standing at the Altar\\" for his 1994 compilation album 1-800-NEW-FUNK, and the B-side of that single, \\"Whistlin' Kenny\\". Track listing Side one * \\"R U There?\\" * \\"Brand New Boy\\" * \\"Warden in the Prison of Love\\" * \\"Bed of Roses\\" * \\"Good Man\\" * \\"Whistlin' Kenny\\" Side two * \\"We Can Hang\\" * \\"Curious Blue\\" * \\"Girls Will Be Girls\\" * \\"Good Body Every Evening\\" The Tora Tora Experience At the height of his troubles with Warner Bros. Records in 1994, Prince contributed under the moniker Tora Tora on the NPG's Exodus album. Happy with this pseudonym, a full album was recorded, but it remains unreleased. Very little is known about this project, but it was mentioned on the 1995 \\"Sampler Experience\\" cassette by the tracks \\"(Lemme See Your Body) Get Loose!\\" a remix of \\"Loose!\\" from Prince's 1994 Come album. The Undertaker This recording was made in a continuous single live- in-the-studio pass in collaboration with NPG drummer Michael Bland and bassist Sonny T.. Prince originally intended to give this live CD away free with 1,000 copies of Guitar Player magazine in 1994 (uploading an original The Undertaker CD to iTunes, shows the year 1995 as the year the CD was \\"released\\"), but he was reportedly barred by Warner Bros. from doing so. Copies were leaked and bootlegged. The songs were guitar-heavy versions of rock and blues numbers, including a cover of The Rolling Stones' \\"Honky Tonk Women\\" and new recording of \\"Bambi\\" (originally from 1979's Prince). The title track was a cover of a song previously given to Mavis Staples, while \\"The Ride\\", \\"Zannalee\\", and \\"Dolphin\\" would all be re-recorded future releases. A video recording of the performance was released in Europe (on VHS and Laserdisc) with small edits throughout the performance and \\"Dolphin\\" replaced by the audio track from the official video of the song from The Gold Experience. Track listing # \\"The Ride\\" ‚Äì 10:54 # \\"Poor Goo\\" ‚Äì 4:26 # \\"Honky Tonk Women\\" ‚Äì 3:00 # \\"Bambi\\" ‚Äì 4:49 # \\"Zannalee (prelude)\\" ‚Äì 0:44 # \\"The Undertaker\\" ‚Äì 9:50 # \\"Dolphin\\" ‚Äì 3:40 Heart Was worked on in 1994. Nothing is known about the album, although it is believed to contain acoustic tracks (it is not known if there is any overlap between this project and The Truth, recorded two years later and released in 1998). \\"Live\\" \\"Live\\" is an unreleased multiple-disc album, offered to Warner Bros. in January 1995. Little is known about the contents, other than it contained live tracks recorded on tours between 1987 and 1993: the Sign o' the Times Tour, the Lovesexy Tour, the Nude Tour, the Diamonds and Pearls Tour, and the Act I and Act II tours. It was supposed to contain four discs, but it is unknown if the material was arranged chronologically or in another way. The album is unrelated to the \\"Live\\" single planned for release the previous year, and The Live Experience album planned for release later in 1995, both of which were planned to be credited to and contained live tracks recorded in 1994 and 1995 consecutively.

Little is known about the contents, other than it contained live tracks recorded at the 8 June 1995 show at Glam Slam, Miami Beach, FL, USA (celebrating Prince's 37th birthday; his second as O(+>). Specific tracks are not known, and it is not known how many discs were planned, or whether the contents were arranged chronologically or sequenced another way. The album is unrelated to the \\"Live\\" single planned for release the previous year (which contained tracks recorded in 1994), and the \\"Live\\" album planned for release earlier in 1995 (which was planned to be credited to Prince and contained live tracks recorded between 1987 and 1993).

It was mentioned by Mayte in an interview with Uptown magazine in July, 1995, and it is possible that she was mistaken in naming the album, and it was in fact Emancipation (or that Emancipation was briefly known as New World, even though the name Emancipation had already been used). Very little is known about the album, although Mayte described it as a \\"techno\\" album, and is believed to have included both \\"New World\\" and \\"Mr. Happy\\", both of which were later released on Emancipation. The Vault ‚Äì Volumes I, II and III \\"The Vault ‚Äì Volumes I, II and III\\" is a series of three albums announced on 22 December 1995 during a press release announcing that Prince had given notice to Warner Bros. of his desire to terminate his contract. The albums, to be credited to Prince, were to serve as the fulfillment of his contract, which intended to follow by releasing Emancipation. They are believed to be three separate single-disc albums, but as they were only mentioned once on a press release, with no distinction between the three volumes, they are listed here together. As both Chaos and Disorder and The Vault... Old Friends 4 Sale were submitted to Warner Bros. in April 1996, the common assumption has been that these albums made up two of the volumes of The Vault ‚Äì Volumes I, II and III. Seven tracks included on the two releases (\\"Dinner with Delores\\", \\"I Rock, Therefore I Am\\", \\"Into the Light\\", \\"I Will\\", \\"Dig U Better Dead\\", \\"Had U\\" and \\"Sarah\\") were recorded between February and April 1996, however, after the press release announcing The Vault ‚Äì Volumes I, II, and III, indicating that some changes took place before the formation of Chaos and Disorder and The Vault...Old Friends 4 Sale. Tracks believed to have been included on The Vault ‚Äì Volumes I, II, and III include the following: * \\"Chaos and Disorder\\" * \\"I Like It There\\" * \\"The Same December\\" * \\"Right the Wrong\\" * \\"Zannalee\\" * \\"The Rest of My Life\\" * \\"It's About That Walk\\" * \\"She Spoke 2 Me\\" * \\"5 Women\\" * \\"When the Lights Go Down\\" * \\"My Little Pill\\" * \\"There Is Lonely\\" * \\"Old Friends 4 Sale\\" * \\"Extraordinary\\" It is likely that several more tracks were included, but no details are known. It is possible, however, that the project was announced in the press release without any corresponding albums completed (indicated by the generic title \\"The Vault ‚Äì Volumes I, II and III\\"), and that the project was never completed before work on Chaos and Disorder and The Vault...Old Friends 4 Sale took over. Prince and Mayte: Happy Tears With the pregnancy of Prince's then-wife Mayte Garcia, Prince was inspired to make and announce a children's music album called Happy Tears, credited to Prince and Mayte. The album was supposed to have been released November 1996. The album was going to include a book of children's stories with it, also credited to Prince and Mayte. To promote the album, Prince guest-starred on the show Muppets Tonight and performed the only song confirmed that would have been included on the album, \\"She Gave Her Angels\\", which remained unreleased until inclusion on the Crystal Ball set. The album was likely canceled because of Prince's son's death one week after birth. The Dawn The Dawn was to be the first Prince album after Emancipation, but it was shelved in 1997. The album was at that point slated to be the accompanying soundtrack to a film of the same name, but because of the box office failure of Graffiti Bridge, this wasn't possible. An acoustic version of the title track can be found on The Truth. Prince had often thought of releasing an album called The Dawn at many points during his career. The earliest known incarnation of 'The Dawn' was from 1986, and seems to have been some kind of musical (an idea that eventually resurfaced as 'Graffiti Bridge'). Another incarnation of 'The Dawn' was assembled around 1994, soon after Prince changed his stage name to an unpronounceable symbol. This time the content was made from tracks that would later surface on Come and The Gold Experience. The last known incarnation of the album was assembled in 1996/1997, this time it came very close to release, and was even advertised on the back of the free cassette single of \\"The Holy River\\" that was given away at Borders stores in 1997. Tracks believed to have been included on the 1994 album Triple album. Combined tracks which had been previously included on 1993 configurations of Come, along with tracks that would later be released on The Gold Experience and Chaos and Disorder, along with various NPG Operator segues, although the exact track listing is not known. * \\"Come\\" * \\"Endorphinmachine\\" * \\"Space\\" * \\"Pheromone\\" * \\"Loose!\\" * \\"Papa\\" * \\"Dark\\" * \\"Dolphin\\" * \\"Poem\\" (later edited and renamed \\"Orgasm\\") * \\"Race\\" * \\"Strays of the World\\" * \\"What's My Name\\" * \\"Interactive\\" * \\"Solo\\" * \\"Zannalee\\" * \\"The Most Beautiful Girl in the World\\" * \\"Now\\" * \\"Ripopgodazippa\\" * \\"Shy\\" * \\"Gold\\" * \\"319\\" * \\"Billy Jack Bitch\\" * \\"Chaos and Disorder\\" * \\"Right the Wrong\\" * \\"Acknowledge Me\\" * \\"Listen 2 the Rhythm\\" (later renamed \\"The Rhythm of Your ‚ô•\\") * \\"Hide the Bone\\" * \\"Love 4 1 Another\\" (later renamed \\"New World\\") * \\"Days of Wild\\" Other tracks not included on any configuration of Come, The Gold Experience or Chaos and Disorder that may have been considered for inclusion here include the following: * \\"Strawberries\\" * \\"Dream\\" * \\"Laurianne\\" * \\"Dance of Desperation\\" * \\"I Wanna Be Held 2 Night\\" * \\"Emotional Crucifixion\\" * \\"The Ride\\" * \\"Poorgoo\\" * \\"Calhoun Square\\" * \\"It's About That Walk\\" (later released on The Vault: Old Friends 4 Sale) * \\"Slave 2 the Funk\\" All tracks listed here are speculative, however. Tracks believed to have been included on the 1996/1997 album * \\"Welcome 2 the Dawn\\" (an acoustic version was later released on The Truth) * \\"The Most Beautiful Girl in the World (Mustang Mix '96)\\" Mayte: Scorpio Announced by Love4OneAnother.com in 1998, it was due to include some tracks from her debut album Child of the Sun, as well as some newly recorded tracks. It is not known if the album was completed before it was abandoned, however, and the project may have been interrupted by Prince and Mayte's marital issues in late 1998 and early 1999. The title of the album comes from Mayte's astrological sign of the Zodiac. Born on 12 November 1973, she is a Scorpio. Nothing is known about which tracks were intended for the album, but the manufacture in 1998 of the single \\"Rhythm of Your ‚ô•\\" (later sold in 2005 on Mayte's website) indicates that \\"The Rhythm of Your ‚ô•\\" (possibly renamed \\"Rhythm of Your ‚ô•\\") was planned for inclusion. Beautiful Strange Worked on in mid-to-late 1998. Little is known about the album, although it is thought that the album would have been planned for release around the same time as the Beautiful Strange TV film broadcast in late October, 1998. Unlike the TV special, which was mostly a lengthy interview and live footage, the album is thought to be a full studio recording. Only two tracks are known to have been planned for inclusion on the album: \\"Beautiful Strange\\" and \\"Twisted\\", a cover version of a track originally written as an instrumental by Wardell Gray in 1949, before having lyrics added by Scottish jazz singer Annie Ross in 1952 and being released as a single (later included on the album King Pleasure Sings/Annie Ross Sings, the same year). Prince carried around a lyric book titled Beautiful Strange during the first few weeks of the One Nite Alone... Tour in 2002, and lyrics to \\"Twisted\\" were seen inside. The contents of the remainder of the lyric book, and of the album, are unknown, and it is not known how complete the album was before it was abandoned to work on the Prince and the Revolution album Roadhouse Garden, and the album Rave Un2 The Joy Fantastic. While Prince's version of Twisted remains unreleased, \\"Beautiful Strange\\" was broadcast as a lyric video during the Beautiful Strange TV film broadcast (released the following year on the Beautiful Strange home video), and a reworked version was released in 2001 on the Rave In2 The Joy Fantastic remix album (marking the only track to be included on the album that had not been included on Rave Un2 The Joy Fantastic). Prince and the Revolution: Roadhouse Garden In 1998, Prince announced a comeback album of Prince & the Revolution that consisted of unreleased songs. It was most likely never released because of a dispute with the original Revolution members. One of the mentioned songs, \\"Splash\\" was released on Prince's website. According to former Revolution keyboardist Dr. Fink, Prince asked for Wendy and Lisa's input on the album, but he didn't offer any compensation, so they declined his offer. Later, when people asked about the Roadhouse Garden album, his reply was \\"Ask Wendy and Lisa\\". The specific sequence of tracks is unknown, but tracks believed to have been included are as follows: * \\"Roadhouse Garden\\" * \\"Witness 4 The Prosecution\\" * \\"Splash\\" * \\"All My Dreams\\" * \\"In A Large Room With No Light\\" * \\"Empty Room\\" * \\"Wonderful Ass\\" New Funk Sampling Series Unreleased 7-CD set containing over 700 brief samples of hooks, beats and sounds from tracks recorded by Prince, planned for musicians and DJs to sample. The set was planned for sale for a one-time fee of $700, with no additional royalties necessary for use of the tracks. Website Love4OneAnother.com announced on 28 March 1999, that had commissioned the set, but nothing else was known until an advertisement and some details were posted on NPGOnlineLtd.com in late May, 2000. Prince then played a short video promoting the set at a party at Paisley Park Studios, Chanhassen, MN, USA, on 16 September 2000 (am). The set was split over seven volumes, subtitled \\"Bass\\", \\"The Human Voice\\", \\"Guitar\\", \\"Keyboards\\", \\"Loops & Percussion\\", \\"Sound FX\\" and \\"Orchestral\\". A promotional advertisement for the set mentioned that samples were included from \\"Kiss\\", \\"Raspberry Beret\\", \\"When Doves Cry\\", \\"Erotic City\\" and \\"Days of Wild\\". Little else is known about the set. Crystal Ball 2 This was a follow up to the 1998 outtake album Crystal Ball. Fans who attended Prince's Paisley Park Studios during June 2000 were given the opportunity to vote for their favorite outtakes out of a list of 23 and 17 were selected. For unknown reasons it was never produced. The tracks included the following: * \\"3 Nigs Watchin' a Kung Fu Movie\\" * \\"Adonis & Bathsheba\\" * \\"American Jam\\" * \\"Come Electra Tuesday\\" (not selected) * \\"Electric Intercourse\\" * \\"Everybody Wants What They Don't Got\\" * \\"Evolsidog\\" * \\"Eye Wonder\\" * \\"Girl\\" (not selected) * \\"Girl o' My Dreams\\" * \\"Gotta Stop (Messin' About)\\" (not selected) * \\"If It'll Make U Happy\\" (not selected) * \\"Katrina's Paper Dolls\\" * \\"Kiss\\" (Unreleased Xtended Version) * \\"Love & Sex\\" * \\"Lust U Always\\" * \\"Others Here with Us\\" * \\"She's Just a Baby\\" (not selected) * \\"Strange Way of Saying Eye Love U\\" * \\"Turn It Up\\" * \\"U're All Eye Want\\" * \\"Xtra Lovable\\" : On top of the selected tracks, \\"What Should B Souled\\" and \\"Wonderful Ass\\" were also thought to be included for the album. DVD Another little-known project that was due to be released at the same time as Crystal Ball II was an accompanying Crystal Ball DVD. This was to contain music videos made for tracks off both volumes of the Crystal Ball albums. A Celebration A Celebration is an unreleased album by Prince, announced on NPG Ahdio Show # 4 (released 15 May 2001). The announcement stated that Prince was in negotiations with a major record store chain to distribute the album, said to contain 20 \\"remastered re-recordings\\" of Prince's greatest hits, along with \\"at least four brand new songs\\". This album was not released, however (likely due to the Warner Bros. release of The Very Best of Prince in July, 2001). It is not known which songs would have been included on the album, and how much the track list overlapped with the setlists used on the brief A Celebration tour, which was likely initially intended to promote the album, but was cancelled after only six concerts (partly to avoid the appearance of supporting The Very Best of Prince, and partly because of Prince wanting to spend time with his father, whose health was ailing at that point). It is possible that one of the new tracks was \\"U Make My Sun Shine\\", which had already been released as a single, but this is purely speculative. It is possible that one of the \\"remastered re-recordings\\" included on the album would have been \\"1999: The New Master\\", which had been released as a single in 1999, but during the years following the end of the year 1999 Prince viewed the song as \\"retired\\" (not playing it live), making its inclusion unlikely. When 2 R in Love: The Ballads of Prince Announced for voting as the next Prince release during the A Celebration week in June 2000. Ballads collection. Full track list and sequencing is unknown, but it is known to include * \\"Do Me, Baby\\" * \\"Insatiable\\" * \\"Scandalous!\\" * \\"Adore\\" * \\"When 2 R in Love\\" The Hot X-perience In 2000, a vinyl maxi single was announced. It would contain new club remixes of \\"Hot wit U\\" featuring Eve. On July 19, 2000, DJ Wolf played some unreleased mixes, likely from The Hot X-perience, at a club known as The Front in Minneapolis, Minnesota: * \\"Hot wit U\\" (Nasty Girl remix) * \\"Hot wit U\\" (hip-hop version) * \\"Underneath the Cream\\" * \\"So Far, So Pleased\\" (club/dance mix; includes portions of \\"Rave un2 the Joy Fantastic\\") * \\"Hot wit U\\" (club/dance mix) \\"Underneath the Cream\\" was later released on Prince's website and an edit of the Nasty Girl Remix was released on the remix album Rave In2 the Joy Fantastic. High In 2000, High was fully complete and ready to release in the summer of 2000, but the album was never released. A video was recorded for the song \\"U Make My Sun Shine\\", a duet with Angie Stone, and it was also released as a single. A video was also made for \\"Daisy Chain,\\" featuring Prince playing basketball in his own court at Paisley Park, and \\"When Eye Lay My Hands on U\\". Most songs were distributed individually via his NPG Music Club. \\"Silicon,\\" \\"Daisy Chain\\" and \\"Golden Parachute\\" were also included on the internet-only The Slaughterhouse project. Prince released The Rainbow Children instead. Track listing # \\"Supercute\\" # \\"Underneath the Cream\\" # \\"Golden Parachute\\" # \\"When Will We B Paid?\\" # \\"The Daisy Chain\\" # \\"Gamillah\\" # \\"High\\" # \\"My Medallion\\" # \\"U Make My Sun Shine\\" # \\"When Eye Lay My Hands on U\\" NPG: Peace During the \\"Hit and Run Tour\\" in 2001, an NPG single from what was billed as the forthcoming new NPG album, 'Peace' was sold. It featured the title track, \\"Peace\\" coupled with \\"2045: Radical Man\\". The album remains unreleased, while \\"2045: Radical Man\\" was given to Spike Lee for his Bamboozled soundtrack. Instead, \\"Peace\\" and \\"2045: Radical Man\\" were later released on the internet-only release of The Slaughterhouse. A full track list is not known, if it was ever completed. The album was believed to include: * \\"Peace\\" * \\"2045: Radical Man\\" Possibly: * \\"The Daisy Chain\\" * \\"Gamillah\\" * \\"Northside\\" Untitled Kevin Smith-directed documentary In the summer of 2001, writer/director Kevin Smith contacted Prince to gain permission to use \\"The Most Beautiful Girl in the World\\" for a scene in his movie Jay and Silent Bob Strike Back. Although he was denied permission, he agreed to film a documentary of reactions, questions and answers during one of Prince's fan weeks at his recording studios, Paisley Park. Most of the footage comes from five sessions of Prince and Smith discussing music with fans. The footage still resides in Prince's vault, while some was used to promote The Rainbow Children album and as background video at some of his live concerts. Smith described the experience in his 2002 live video An Evening with Kevin Smith; according to An Evening with Kevin Smith 2: Evening Harder, Prince was intending to edit the film into a promotional movie for Jehovah's Witnesses. Madrid 2 Chicago A new album was announced for 2001. Two songs entitled \\"Madrid 2 Chicago\\" and \\"Breathe\\" were distributed via the NPG Music Club, but the full album remains unreleased. In All My Dreams During mid-2001/2002 artwork was posted on NPG Music Club for an album called \\"In All My Dreams\\". Because of the title, it was assumed that it included the Dream Factory outtake \\"All My Dreams\\". Nothing else is known, and the album has never materialized Last December Announced in the \\"One Nite Alone...\\" tour book in March 2002, the title is a track from The Rainbow Children. The album has never materialized. The Very Best of O(+> Announced in the \\"One Nite Alone...\\" tour book in March 2002. Nothing else is known about the album, although from the title it seems likely that the album was a compilation of tracks recorded while Prince used the symbol \\"Love Symbol\\" as his name (from 1993 to 2000), although, given licensing, it seems likely this would be restricted to master tracks owned by Prince, rather than by Warner Bros. (eliminating tracks used on The Gold Experience and Chaos and Disorder). Alternatively, it may have included some re-recordings of tracks which had been originally released by Warner Bros., but all information about the album is speculative. The title may have been in response to Warner Bros.' release of The Very Best of Prince, released in late July, 2001, seven months before this album was announced. The Chocolate Invasion In 2003 it was announced that the members-only tracks from the first years of the NPG Music Club would be released in a 7-CD boxed set containing: * C-Note * Xpectation * One Nite Alone... ‚Äì solo piano & voice * The Chocolate Invasion ‚Äì Trax from NPGMC Volume 1 * The Slaughterhouse ‚Äì Trax from NPGMC Volume 2 * \\"The Glam Slam\\" club mix * \\"The War\\" In November 2003, a problem with manufacturing was reported, and the project was put on hold. The only albums that have become available on CD in limited editions before were \\"The War\\", available through 1-800-NEW-FUNK in 1998 and One Nite Alone..., sent to NPG Music Club members in 2002 as part of the annual subscription. Furthermore, all albums have been made available for download (in some cases with tracks varying very slightly) via the NPG Music Club at various stages. An excerpt of \\"The Glam Slam Club Mix\\" was possibly part of NPG Ahdio Show #11 and available as a free download in December 2001, C-Note and Xpectation were free downloads for members in January 2003 and became available in the NPG Music Club store in 2004, together with One Nite Alone..., The Chocolate Invasion and The Slaughterhouse. 3121 film Near the end of 2005, Prince had written and produced for the singer Liza Hernandez (also known as Liza Lena) and, according to the Panamanian news site Prensa.com, \\"Has maintained a good friendship since they filmed together the film 31-21,\\" and was, according to the site, supposed to be released in April 2006. There are references to the film on a few Prince forums, which, unfortunately for the sake of authenticity, only refer back to quotes from unofficial, unknown, or expired sources. There are no references to the film found on either Prince's official newsletter 3121.com or in the Internet Movie Database. The cover of the 3121 CD reads '3121 ‚Äì The Music', further fuelling speculation of a 3121 movie. In April 2011, a fully produced trailer for the movie leaked on the net and stated that the movie is \\"Coming Soon\\". 3121 movie also has appearances from DJ Rashida and actress Jennifer Gordon. Aftermath After the film was shelved, it was reorganized as a new film named LotusFlow3r T√°mar: Milk & Honey In 2005 and early 2006, with a planned release in Spring 2006, during the 3121 sessions, Prince and T√°mar worked on her debut album. Originally titled Beautiful, Loved & Blessed, it was renamed Milk & Honey. Originally, it was going to be released with Prince's 3121, but it was postponed before being cancelled altogether. However, it got a tiny release in Japan before the cancellation. \\"Beautiful, Loved & Blessed\\" was later included in a slightly different form on Prince's 3121, \\"Holla & Shout\\" was also available as a promotional single, and the song \\"Kept Woman\\" was later re-recorded by Bria Valente for her debut album Elixer. Track listing # \\"Closer 2 My Heart\\" # \\"Milk & Honey\\" # \\"Can't Keep Living Alone\\" # \\"Holla & Shout\\" # \\"Kept Woman\\" # \\"Holy Ground\\" # \\"Beautiful, Loved & Blessed\\" # \\"Redhead Stepchild\\" # \\"All Eye Want Is U\\" # \\"First Love\\" # \\"Sunday in the Park\\" # \\"Beautiful, Loved & Blessed\\" (reprise) The L/C In 2011, Andy Allo posted some songs by Prince and herself on her Facebook account. She has posted a live version of Prince performing \\"Stratus\\" and an acoustic version of \\"Guitar\\". On that acoustic version of \\"Guitar\\", there was meta-data attached to it. The information saying it is from a project called The L/C featuring Prince and Andy Allo. In November 2015 Prince streamed an acoustic album, Oui Can Luv, featuring Prince and Andy Allo on Tidal for a very short time. It featured the acoustic version of \\"Guitar\\". Possible track listing: *Guitar (Acoustic Version) *Oui Can Love *Love Is A Losing Game *I Love U In Me Montreux live concert Announced in 2013 via a promotional video at the website 20pr1nc3.com, but not materialized.

Their success coloured locomotive development in New Zealand until the end of steam. History tender. In 1877, the new Chief Mechanical Engineer of the NZR, Allison D. Smith required additional motive power for the fledgling Government system. It had been intended to order more J Class locomotives which were of English design. However, Mr Smith was adamant American locomotives would be much more suitable for New Zealand's conditions. His argument won (see Vogel railways), and an order was placed with the Rogers Locomotive Works of New Jersey, for two tender locomotives with a wheel arrangement of 2-4-2. The initial two Rogers locos were ordered prior to Smith‚Äôs appointment as Locomotive Engineer on 10 April 1877 (he had been manager of the Wellington section), and were ordered through New York consulting engineer Walton Evans. The locomotives were described by R.D. Grant as having the design hallmarks of Roger's Superintendent William H. Hudson, with his truck design innovations and his patented compensated springing throughout from the front bissel truck to the driving wheel springs and to the rear swinging truck. Upon their arrival to New Zealand, the locomotives created quite a stir with their bar frames, Gothic style wooden cabs, locomotive bell, ornate embellishments and, rakish appearances which were at odds with the traditional English locomotive appearance in New Zealand at the time and were described by journalist Charles Rous-Marten as \\"a watch with all its works outside\\". One Christchurch paper suggested that they needed a glass case to protect them from the weather. They looked flimsy because of the bar frames rather than the heavier plate frames of the Js. In addition, this first pair, K 87 \\"Lincoln\\" and K 88 \\"Washington\\", reputedly wore a kaleidoscope of colours ‚Äì green, blue, yellow, red, purple, and gold in addition to their Russian Iron boiler jackets. The Baldwin and Rogers locomotives reflected the styling adopted in the 1870s by American builders with elements from the Renaissance Revival and Neo-Baroque architectural styles, and with Islamic Moorish (from Alhambra) influences. Bold colours and painted decorations were used. New Zealand‚Äôs Early American Locomotives: The Design, Art and Architecture of the K, T and O Class Locomotives Part 2 by David Fletcher: \\"New Zealand Railfan\\", March 2015 pages 33-49: Volume 21 No 2  In service  After arrival in the South Island at Lyttelton, the locomotives were quickly put into service. K 87 \\"Lincoln\\" quickly distinguished itself by hauling the first bogie-carriage passenger train, and both the locomotives soon earned a reputation as fast and free runners, with mild coal consumption. K 88 \\"Washington\\" hauled the first train between Christchurch and Dunedin in 1878 on the just-completed Main South Line, assisted by the Double Fairlie \\"Josephine\\" south of Oamaru until \\"Josephine\\" had to be taken off the train due to mechanical issues - caused by how K 88 was being driven by its driver. Six more of the class was ordered from the Rogers Locomotive Works, numbered from 92 through 97 before K's 87 and 88 had entered service - the former being ordered in January 1878 while the latter entered service in March 1878, such was Allison Smiths faith in the type of engine he had ordered. Allison Smiths faith was well placed with railway authorities regarding the first two K's as \\"infinitely superior to the English locomotives\\" in operation during the same period. The second batch of locomotives entered service in the South Island and contained almost no differences to the first two, albeit they were not given names and there is no record of them wearing the same kaleidoscope livery (it is likely K 87 and K 88 had been repainted by this time also). In 1883, due to its design characteristics, the K class was the only class of engine officially permitted to run at 35 miles per hour in ordinary service. As more powerful locomotives arrived on the railway system, increasingly of American origin from Baldwin, the K class became relegated from the top expresses and cascaded down to express trains on secondary lines. Two of the K's, K 93 and K 96, were transferred to the North Island during this time. Beginning just after 1900 the class started receiving new NZR-built boilers to replace their Rogers- built wagon-top boiler. The South Island locomotives gained boilers of a Belpaire design, while the North Island pair received round-top boilers. All the new boilers were pressed to 160psi, an increase over the original boiler's 130psi. By this time all the locomotives had received Westinghouse brake equipment also. It was during this time that some of the K class, having been relegated to the Kingston-Gore branch, began earning a reputation for the Kingston-Invercargill express train which earned the name \\"Kingston Flyer\\".  Withdrawal and disposal  The days of the K class in service were over during the 1920s. Both the North Island examples, plus K 87 \\"Lincoln\\" had been withdrawn as early as 1922. The others managed to linger on for a few more years yet, with the last two, K 92 and K 95, not withdrawn until 1927. As was customary at the time, the locomotives were set aside pending disposal, whatever form that may have taken. All remaining South Island class members lasted long enough to be dumped as embankment protection, something which began in 1926.  Preservation  Three of the Rogers K class have so far been exhumed and entered into preservation. The first and most notable of these locomotives is K 88 Washington, which was exhumed from its river grave by the Southland Vintage Car Club on 19 and 20 January 1974. There were a number of loose plans regarding the locomotive's future but these came to nothing. The locomotive wreck was threatened with being pushed back into the river until The Plains Vintage Railway & Historical Museum came up with ambitious plans to restore it back to working order. Beginning in July 1974, they achieved this goal in on the 7 November 1981 proving that the restoration of exhumed locomotives was possible. It was recommissioned on the 25 November the following year. However, on 24 September 1987 the boiler of K 88 (which was the boiler that it had been recovered from the Oreti River with) was condemned, and it was not until 30 March 2002 that K 88 was once again in working order, this time with a new Belpaire-style all-welded boiler and wearing an interpretation of the kaleidoscope colours. The other two locomotives exhumed so far are K 94, exhumed by a private owner and moved to The Plains Railway on 21 April 1986. It is in storage in an un-restored state with no active plans for restoration. And K 92, recovered in 1985 by the Fiordland Vintage Machinery Club for their Museum's railway venture on the shores of Lake Te Anau. Partially restored in Te Anau the venture fell through before the locomotive had been fully completed and subsequently the locomotive was put up for sale, with the restoration being completed in Dunedin. Purchased by Colin Smith in 1998, the locomotive's restoration was completed and it is intended to recreate the old \\"Kingston Flyer\\" trains of the early 1900s at the Waimea Plains Railway. While waiting for the railway to be completed, K 92 has visited a number of railways in the South Island, with some of the more notable visits being those to the Kingston Flyer, an old haunt for K 92 where it triple headed with the two AB class locomotives resident there, and also a visit to the Plains, home of K 88, where both locomotives were used together extensively.

The ACGME's member organizations are the American Board of Medical Specialties, American Hospital Association, American Medical Association, Association of American Medical Colleges, American Osteopathic Association (AOA), American Association of Colleges of Osteopathic Medicine (AACOM), and the Council of Medical Specialty Societies each of whom appoints members to the ACGME's board of directors. In 2014, the ACGME, the American Osteopathic Association (AOA) and the American Association of Colleges of Osteopathic Medicine (AACOM) announced an agreement to pursue a single, unified accreditation system for graduate medical education programs in the United States beginning in 2015. Plans call for the ACGME to accredit all osteopathic graduate medical education programs by July 1, 2020. Projects The Clinical Learning Environment Review project promotes patient safety, quality during changes in care, appropriate supervision of care, managing fatigue of residents, and increasing the professionalism of physicians. By June 30, 2020, all US residency programs will be ACGME-accredited. Before this date, only MD residencies were ACGME-accredited, while DO residencies were AOA-accredited. Outcome Project The Outcome Project began in 2001 with a set of assessments for measuring physician competence. By 2009, it was recognized that ACGME measurements could not reliably be evaluated independently of each other and instead should be used together and with other measurements. The ACGME introduced milestones in internal medicine, pediatrics, and surgery for assessing progress of residents toward the six identified competencies. Milestones can be evaluated by numerous methods ranging from direct observation of clinical encounters to medical simulation. Awards Awards handed out by the ACGME include the David C Leach award and Palmer award.http://www.insidedukemedicine.org/announcements/turner-gets-acgme-award/ Many of the awardees have notably earned multiple national level awards including both ACGME and American Medical Association award recognition.

He was a watchmaker who built complete watches by hand (including the case and dial). But it was his creation of the coaxial escapement for which he is most remembered. The movement, which theoretically removed the need to add a lubricant, has been used by Omega in most of their collections since 1999 except of the Speedmaster Moonwatch. A yellow gold chronograph pocket watch made by George Daniels, the Space Traveller's Watch I, ranks as one of the 20 most expensive watches ever sold at auction, fetching ¬£ 3,615,000 (US$ 4.561 million as of July 2019) in London on 2 July 2019. Early career Daniels was born in Sunderland in 1926. His mother was unmarried so she fled London and travelled north. After Daniels was born he and his mother returned to London, where she married Daniels' father.George Daniels: A Master Watchmaker and His Art by Michael Clerizo In 1944, Daniels entered the British Army; he already had an interest in watches and did some repairs for army friends. On leaving the army in 1947 with a gratuity of ¬£50, he bought some tools and got a job as a watch repairer. From studying horology at night classes, he became a Fellow of the British Horological Institute. After a decade of hard work, Daniels opened his first watch repair and cleaning shop in 1960 in London. Becoming interested in the works of the notable early 19th-century French watchmaker Abraham-Louis Breguet, he soon became the 1960s' leading expert on Breguet and was often involved in advising on his work. Rise to prominence His friend named Sam Clutton introduced Daniels to the upscale timepiece market and convinced him that he had a future in expensive handcrafted watches. In 1969, Daniels constructed ‚Äì for ¬£2,000 ‚Äì his first pocket watch for Clutton. When his friend showed the piece to fellow collectors, it created great interest. Five years later, Daniels bought the watch back for ¬£8,000. In 2012, it sold at auction in the United States for $285,000. Throughout his career, Daniels made signature timepieces for personally selected customers, stating \\"I never made watches for people if I didn't care for them.\\" The watches, which cost tens of thousands of pounds, took more than 2,500 hours to make. His signature was to give them clear and clean dials with subsidiary dials interwoven with the main chapter ring. Coaxial escapement The coaxial escapement was created by George Daniels in 1974. During the quartz crisis, George Daniels accepted a commission from American industrialist and watch collector Seth G. Atwood to create a timepiece that would fundamentally improve the performance of mechanical watches. After much experimentation, Daniels had designed a new type of watch escapement by 1974. The mechanism, which was first unveiled in 1976 as the Atwood watch and patented in 1980, was called the coaxial escapement. Its design avoided the need to add oil to the escapement because the mechanism operated with very low friction. Traditional escapements had to use lubricants but this eventually caused problems with accuracy as oil thickened over time. However, the coaxial escapement used radial friction instead of sliding friction, making lubricants theoretically unnecessary. In practice a small mount of lubrication is used on the impulse and locking surfaces of the pallet stones. Daniels' mechanism has since been described by some as the most important development in horology in the past 250 years. Although the horological industry was first introduced to the concept in 1976, Daniels' escapement was met with scepticism and lack of interest. It was not until the 1980s that Swatch Group chairman Nicolas Hayek adopted the concept, using it in his upmarket Omega brand. The company unveiled ‚Äì to great acclaim ‚Äì its first automatic watch using Daniels' coaxial escapement at the 1999 Basel Watch and Jewellery Fair. Later life The Grand Complication watch of 1987 Daniels, who was a member of the Swiss Acad√©mie Horlog√®re des Cr√©ateurs Ind√©pendants', continued to make watches well into later life. In total he created 37 handmade watches completely by himself and a 50-piece wristwatch series in conjunction with independent watchmaker, Roger W. Smith, using a basic Omega movement.Thomson, Curtis D. (14 October 2002) Roger W. Smith: Isle of Man - The Millennium Watch . www.tp178.com. Retrieved 26 March 2015 By the time of his death he is said to have \\"completed 24 of the most extraordinary and technically advanced watches ever made\\". His mechanical watches were more accurate than quartz watches, with some losing less than a second per month. Daniels, who was a Master of the Clockmakers' Company of London, was given their Gold Medal, a rare honour.Master watchmaker Dr. George Daniels, 1926 ‚Äì 2011 Omegawatches.com. 24 October 2011, Retrieved 26 March 2015 He also received the Gold Medal of the British Horological Institute, the Gold Medal of the City of London and the Kullberg Medal from the Stockholm Watchmakers' Guild. In 2006, to celebrate his work and his 80th birthday, Sotheby's and Bobinet (the antique watch dealer) held a retrospective exhibition of his work, featuring every watch Daniels had made, except one which is held by the British Museum. He was given an Award of Doctor of Science honoris causa by City University London in 2007.

It is located in the Perth suburb of Coogee, south-south-west of the city centre and south of Fremantle. It extends westward into the Indian Ocean. The coastal waters immediately to the north of the point are known as Owen Anchorage, while to the south is Jervoise Bay. Woodman Point marks the northern extent of Cockburn Sound. Woodman Point is contained completely within the Woodman Point Regional Park, a regional park with recreational facilities including parklands, playgrounds, jetties, and a caravan park; and historic sites including a World War II prisoner-of-war camp and World War II munitions bunkers. History Woodman Point was named after Thomas Woodman who accompanied Captain James Stirling on the 1827 HMS Success expedition which explored the upper reaches of the Swan River. When Stirling returned in 1829 with the first settlers for the Swan River Colony, Woodman Point would have been one of the first mainland landmarks sighted by the new arrivals. Woodman Point Quarantine Station In the 1880s a quarantine station was established there to isolate immigrants from the community whilst being cleared of smallpox, bubonic plague and Spanish influenza which was ravaging Europe, the Americas and Asia. The facility continued to be used intermittently as a quarantine station until about 1979 when it closed. The buildings, including dormitories and administration buildings as well as the crematorium were placed in the Register of the National Estate in 1999. The dormitories and most other buildings are currently in use for school and other groups and now known as Woodman Point Recreation Camp.  Racecourse  Early accounts of horse racing in the Swan River Colony indicate that Woodman Point was always a favourite location for racing enthusiasts, with the first races being run there in 1833. By the mid 1880s, a regular carnival of events had grown around the unofficial racecourse, and Fremantle residents would come down by steam boat or private yacht to spend the day watching the races and picnicking. The course was taken over by the Fremantle Jockey Club in 1894, granted a 99-year lease in 1899, and run with varying degrees of success until 1900, when the club lapsed. During this time the racecourse was kept in excellent condition, with the 3-furlong straights levelled over a width of 66 feet and planted with couch grass. It was watered by a windmill and reticulation, and the club had built a bird cage of 24 stalls. For years racing enthusiasts had been requesting that the existing railway line to Robbs Jetty be extended to Woodman Point for ease of access, but to no avail. This eventually led to the decline of the area as a popular racecourse. In 1903 the State Government decided to resume the racecourse land for a new explosives magazine, as it was by then considered to be abandoned. Only then was the railway line extended.  Other uses  Woodman Light, a lighthouse built in 1902, is located just beyond the eastern boundary of the reserve. The light is on a small hill to the East side of Cockburn Road and nearby are stone cottages used to house the lighthouse keepers. In 1966 the State Electricity Commission (now Western Power) built a wastewater treatment plant at Woodman Point. It was replaced by another plant in a new location also at Woodman Point in 1984. Munitions site The munitions bunkers, located in a munitions reserve East of the quarantine station, were actively used for that purpose until the 1980shttp://pandora.nla.gov.au/pan/34313/20060325-0000/www.heritage.wa.gov.au/register/PDF_Files/U-Z%20Reg/Woodman%20Pt%20Mun%20Mags%20%28P%29.pdf Heritage registration of Munitions site when the facility was de-commissioned and moved to Karnup, southeast of Rockingham. By that time the Navy had also established its own facility at HMAS Stirling on Garden Island. Railway line A dedicated railway spur line to service the munitions reserve originally ran parallel to Cockburn Road past Coogee Beach to South Fremantle and then to the inner harbour of the Port of Fremantle which was a major allied naval base during World War II. Removal of the munitions reserve was necessary before nearby land was developed into the residential suburb now known as Coogee. In the 1980s, a proposal to create a tourist railway operations centre at Woodman Point was proposed, but it never eventuated.

She won fourteen national titles (outdoor; as well as seven indoor) in Bulgaria, and is still the Bulgarian record holder in the 800 metres. International career She was born in Sofia, and represented the clubs CSKA and Septemvrisko Zname during her career. In the 1970s and 1980s she was a prolific competitor at the European Indoor Championships. She finished sixth at the 1975 European Indoor Championships, clocking in only 2:20.3 seconds, but then won the gold medal at the 1976 European Indoor Championships. She edged out countrywoman Lilyana Tomova with 0.4 seconds, and Bulgaria almost managed a gold-silver-bronze constellation, but Ivanka Bonova lost the bronze medal to Gisela Klein. She won another gold medal at the 1979 European Indoor Championships, 0.3 seconds ahead of Anita Wei√ü, and finished sixth at the 1982 European Indoor Championships. She also won the 800 metres event at the 1979 IAAF World Cup. In winning her medals at the 1976 and 1979 European Indoor Championships, she was a part of a strong tradition of Bulgarian 800 metres runners, who won medals at the European Indoor Championships in 1972, 1973, 1975, 1976, 1977, 1978 and 1979. Other than Shtereva, these medals were taken by Svetla Zlateva (1972), Stefka Yordanova (1973), Rositsa Pekhlivanova (1975), Lilyana Tomova (1976) and Totka Petrova (1977, 1978). Shtereva also competed in the Olympic Games twice, in 1976 in Montreal and 1980 in Moscow. Both times she competed in both 800 and 1500 metres. In the 1976 Olympic 800 metres event she started by finishing second in the initial heat with 2:01.02 minutes, then second in the semi-final with 1:57.35 minutes. In the final she won the silver medal behind Soviet Tatyana Kazankina (gold) but ahead of East German Elfi Zinn (bronze). Kazankina set a new world record of 1:54.94 minutes, while Shtereva clocked in 1:55.42 minutes. The previous world record was 1:56.0 minutes, achieved by Valentina Gerasimova in June the same year. In the 1976 Olympic 1500 metres event Shtereva reached the final as well, after a fourth place in the heat and a second place in the semi-final. In the final round she finished fourth with 4:06.57 minutes, despite having clocked in 4:02.33 minutes in the semi-final. Kazankina won the gold again; Shtereva was 0.48 seconds too late for the bronze medal. In the 1980 Olympic 800 metres event she achieved similar results in all the three rounds. She first ran in 1:58.83 minutes to finish third in round one, and in 1:58.87 minutes to finish fourth in the semi-final. In the final she ran in 1:58.71 to finish seventh. In the 1980 Olympic 1500 metres event she ran in 4:08.25 minutes in the first round, better than in the equivalent round of the 1976 Olympics, but this time it was not enough to progress from the heats. She later finished seventh in the final at the 1982 European Championships. Domestic titles Shtereva became Bulgarian champion in the 400 metres in 1974, 800 metres champion in 1974, 1976, 1979, 1981, 1982, 1985, 1986, 1988 and 1989, 1500 metres champion 1980, 1985 and 1986 and 10,000 metres champion in 1986. In the 800 metres she established a long- standing championship record with her 1:57.2 minutes, achieved in 1979. After Shtereva's last national championship victory in the 800 metres, the hegemony was taken over by Petya Strashilova who won every year but one (1996) between 1990 and 1998. She also became Bulgarian indoor champion in the 800 metres in 1974, 1976, 1979, 1980 and 1987, in the 1500 metres in 1976 and 1987 and in the 3000 metres in 1986. She achieved championship records all three events, with 2:01.1 minutes, 4:09.80 minutes and 9:06.61 minutes respectively; the two latter times were beat in 2000 by Daniela Yordanova, with 4:08.53 minutes and 8:52.90 minutes respectively. Personal bests The times achieved by Shtereva at the 1976 Summer Olympics, 1:55.42 in the 800 metres and 4:02.33 in the 1500 metres, remained her personal best times.World women's all-time best 800m (last updated 2001)World women's all-time best 1500m (last updated 2001) She still holds the Bulgarian record in the 800 metres.Bulgarian Records (last updated 31 December 07)) She also had 2:33.8 minutes in the 1000 metres, achieved in July 1976 in Sofia,World women's all-time best 1000m (last updated 2001) 4:30.26 minutes in the mile run, achieved in June 1988 in Bratislava,World women's all-time best 1 mile (last updated 2001) 9:00.38 minutes in the 3000 metres, achieved in August 1978 in Thessaloniki,World women's all-time best 3000m (last updated 2001) and 15:37.49 minutes in the 5000 metres, achieved in May 1985 in Budapest.World women's all-time best 5000m (last updated 2001) References Category:1955 births Category:Living people Category:Sportspeople from Sofia Category:Bulgarian female middle- distance runners Category:Olympic athletes of Bulgaria Category:Olympic silver medalists for Bulgaria Category:Athletes (track and field) at the 1976 Summer Olympics Category:Athletes (track and field) at the 1980 Summer Olympics Category:Medalists at the 1976 Summer Olympics Category:Olympic silver medalists in athletics (track and field) Category:Universiade medalists in athletics (track and field) Category:Universiade bronze medalists for Bulgaria Category:Medalists at the 1975 Summer Universiade ","title":"Nikolina Shtereva"},{"id":"3586363","text":"Vele≈°√≠n () is a town in the South Bohemian Region of the Czech Republic.

(Camera in Hand, How About You, What are you Seeing?), better known and advertised as C√°mara en Mano, is an Argentine reality-type television show. In the show, interviewers stage and record spontaneous interviews with celebrities.https://www.clarin.com/ediciones- anteriores/ver-mirar_0_rJbg4mvJRte.html History \\"C√°mara en Mano\\" debuted in November 2005 on Argentina television network Telef√©. The show is a reality-type show, where various interviewers, some of which had already reached show business fame in Argentina and others which hadn't, attend different events with celebrities involved or film different types of adventures, always carrying a small, hand-held camera. Most of the times, celebrities are recorded without being aware that they will be shown on television, although some famous people have recognized the interviewers instantly. President N√©stor Kirchner went as far as saying that he watched the show when he spotted a C√°mara en Mano interviewer after a political rally. Former President Carlos Menem has also been interviewed. Famous international singer Sandro spotted one of C√°mara en Mano's interviewers near his private swimming pool. Not knowing he was being filmed for a television show, he accepted to talk to the interviewer and answered questions from behind his house's fence. The person who interviewed Sandro that day was Lucia Maciel, a regular interviewer who is also an actress, having participated in various Argentine telenovelas, including Resistir√© with Celeste Cid. Maciel has interviewed many celebrities for C√°mara en Mano. She was given a kiss on the cheeks by Enrique Iglesias during a press conference she covered for the daily show. She also held a moke sparring session with women's boxing world champion Marcela Acuna, and was at Buenos Aires' famous Luna Park, Buenos Aires recording a kick-boxing world title fight. Other famous people who have appeared in C√°mara en Mano are male boxing world champion Jorge Castro, actor Facundo Arana and fashion model Jessica Cirio. Not all celebrities have been kind to C√°mara en Mano interviewers: on the December 30, 2005 telecast of the show, a video of an Argentine politician injuring a \\"C√°mara en Mano\\" reporter by closing a car door and getting the interviewer's hand jammed between the car and its door, was shown. This interviewer required a quick visit to a local hospital's emergency room, and had his hand inmobilised with a first aid product. The C√°mara en Mano team also filmed a video during an airplane flight each of the members of Camara en Mano's cast took to Uruguay, to play a friendly soccer match with a Uruguayan team. C√°mara en Mano's host is Matias Martin. He has admitted that the show is, according to him, a hybrid between two other similar Argentine shows of the past, Teikirisi (pronounced \\"take it easy\\") and C√°mara Testigo (Witness Camera), both of which enjoyed success in South America. It could be said that the show's trademark is Martin's phrase at the end of each of C√°mara en Mano's programs, when he asks, aloud, the question that is actually part of the show's official name, ¬øY vos, que ves??? (\\"and you, what do you see?\\").

It was negotiated during the Uruguay Round of the General Agreement on Tariffs and Trade (GATT), and entered into force with the establishment of the WTO at the beginning of 1995.Timothy J. Miano, \\"Understanding and Applying International Infectious Disease Law: U.N. Regulations During an H5N1 Avian Flu Epidemic\\" 6 Chi-Kent J. Int'l & Comp. L. 26, 42-48 (2006). Broadly, the sanitary and phytosanitary (\\"SPS\\") measures covered by the agreement are those aimed at the protection of human, animal or plant life or health from certain risks.Peter Van den Bossche and Werner Zdouc, The Law and Policy of the World Trade Organization: Text, Cases and Materials (Cambridge University Press, 2013) 834. Under the SPS agreement, the WTO sets constraints on member-states' policies relating to food safety (bacterial contaminants, pesticides, inspection and labelling) as well as animal and plant health (phytosanitation) with respect to imported pests and diseases. There are 3 standards organizations who set standards that WTO members should base their SPS methodologies on. As provided for in Article 3, they are the Codex Alimentarius Commission (Codex), World Organization for Animal Health (OIE) and the Secretariat of the International Plant Protection Convention (IPPC). The SPS agreement is closely linked to the Agreement on Technical Barriers to Trade, which was signed in the same year and has similar goals. The TBT Emerged from the Tokyo Round of WTO negotiations and was negotiated with the aim of ensuring non-discrimination in the adoption and implementation of technical regulations and standards.Kasturi Das, 'Coping with SPS Challenges in India: WTO and Beyond', (2008) 11(4) Journal of International Economic Law, 971-1019, 973-974, 973 History and framework As GATT's preliminary focus had been lowering tariffs, the framework that preceded the SPS Agreement was not adequately equipped to deal with the problems of non-tariff barriers (NTBs) to trade and the need for an independent agreement addressing this became critical.Das, 'Coping with SPS Challenges in India: WTO and Beyond',973-974. The SPS Agreement is an ambitious attempt to deal with NTBs arising from cross-national differences in technical standards without diminishing governments prerogative to implement measures to guard against diseases and pests.Tim Buthe, 'The globalization of health and safety standards: delegation of regulatory authority in the SPS Agreement of the 1994 agreement establishing the World Trade Organization' (2008) 71(1) Law and Contemporary Problems, 219-255 Main provisions * Article 1 ‚Äì General Provisions - Outlines the application of the Agreement. * Annex A.1 ‚Äì Definition of SPS measures. * Article 2 ‚Äì Basic Rights and Obligations. Article 2.2 - requires measures to be based on sufficient scientific analysis. Article 2.3 - states that Members shall ensure that their sanitary and phytosanitary measures do not arbitrarily or unjustifiably discriminate between Members where identical or similar conditions prevail, including between their own territory and that of other Members. Sanitary and phytosanitary measures shall not be applied in a manner which would constitute a disguised restriction on international trade. * Article 3 ‚Äì Harmonization. Article 3.1- To harmonize sanitary and phytosanitary measures on as wide a basis as possible, Members shall base their sanitary or phytosanitary measures on international standards, guidelines or recommendations, where they exist, except as otherwise provided for in this Agreement, and in particular in paragraph 3. Article 3.3 ‚Äì allows Members to implement SPS measures higher than if they were basing them on international standards where there is a scientific justification or the Member determines the measure to be appropriate in accordance with 5.1-5.8. * Annex A.3 ‚Äì outlines the standard- setting bodies. * Article 5 ‚Äì Risk Assessment and Determination of the Appropriate Level of SPS Protection. Article 5.1 - Members shall ensure that their sanitary or phytosanitary measures are based on an assessment, as appropriate to the circumstances, of the risks to human, animal or plant life or health, taking into account risk assessment techniques developed by the relevant international organizations. * Annex A.4 ‚Äì outlines risk assessment process. * Article 5.5 - each Member shall avoid arbitrary or unjustifiable distinctions in the levels it considers to be appropriate in different situations, if such distinctions result in discrimination or a disguised restriction on international trade. Article 5.7‚Äì echoes the 'Precautionary Principle' where there is no science available with which to justify a measure.Marrakesh Agreement Establishing the World Trade Organization, opened for signature 15 April 1994, 1867 UNTS 3 (entered into force 1 January 1995) annex 1A ('Agreement on Sanitary and Phytosanitary Measures') at https://www.wto.org/english/tratop_e/sps_e/spsagr_e.htm Cases Some of the most important WTO 'cases' regarding the implementation of SPS measures include: * EC ‚Äì Hormones (Beef Hormone Dispute) (1998)Appellate Body Report, EC Measures Concerning Meat and Meat Products (Hormones), WTO Doc WT/DS26/AB/R, WT/DS48/AB/R, AB-1997-4 (Jan 16, 1998) at https://www.wto.org/english/tratop_e/dispu_e/cases_e/ds26_e.htm * Japan ‚Äì Agricultural Products (1999)Appellate Body Report, Japan ‚Äì Measures Affecting Agricultural Products, WTO Doc WT/DS76/R, 61 (October 27, 1998) at https://www.wto.org/english/tratop_e/dispu_e/cases_e/ds76_e.htm * Australia ‚Äì Salmon (1999)Appellate Body report, Australia ‚Äì Measures Affecting Importation of Salmon, WTO Doc WT/DS18/R/AB (20 October 1998) at https://www.wto.org/english/tratop_e/dispu_e/cases_e/ds18_e.htm * Japan ‚Äì Apples (2003)Appellate Body report, Japan-Measures Affecting the Importation of Apples, WTO Doc WT/DS245/AB/R (26 November 2003) at www.wto.org/english/tratop_e/dispu_e/cases_e/1pagesum_e/ds245sum_e.pdf Genetically modified organisms In 2003, the United States challenged a number of EU laws restricting the importation of Genetically Modified Organisms (GMOs) in a dispute known as EC-Biotech,Panel Report, European Communities ‚Äì Measures Affecting the Approval and Marketing of Biotech Products, WTO Doc WT/DS291, WT/DS292/R, WT/DS293/R (2006) arguing they are \\"unjustifiable\\" and illegal under SPS agreement. In May 2006, the WTO's dispute resolution panel issued a complex ruling which took issue with some aspects of the EU's regulation of GMOs, but dismissed many of the claims made by the USA. A summary of the decision can be found here. Hormone-treated beef Another prominent SPS case is the hormone-treated beef case. In 1996, the United States and Canada challenged before the WTO Dispute Settlement Body (DSB) a number of EU directives prohibiting the importation and sale of meat and meat products treated with certain growth hormones. The complainants alleged that the EU directives violated, among other things, several provisions of the SPS Agreement. The EU contended that the presence of the banned hormones in food may present a risk to consumers' health and that, as a consequence, the directives were justified under several WTO provisions authorizing the adoption of trade-restrictive measures that are necessary to protect human health. In 1997 and 1998, the WTO adjudicating bodies admitted USA and Canada claims and invited the EU to bring the directives into conformity with WTO law before end of May 1999. EU did not comply and the DSB authorized the USA and Canada to take countermeasures against the EU. The countermeasures took the form of increased custom duties applied by the USA and Canada on certain EU products, including the notorious Roquefort cheese. In 2004, while the ban on hormone-treated meat was still in place, the EU initiated before the DSB new proceedings seeking the lifting of the countermeasures applied by the USA and Canada. EU alleged that it had collected new scientific data evidencing that the banned hormones may cause harm to consumers. According to the EU, the new scientific data provides sufficient ground for the ban on hormones, which may no more be sanctioned by the countermeasures imposed by the USA and Canada. As of January 2007, the proceedings initiated by the EU were still pending. Interaction with other World Trade Organization instruments While Article 1.5 of the TBT precludes the inclusion of SPS measures from its ambit, in EC-Biotech, the panel recognised that situations could arise where a measure is only partly an SPS measure, and in those cases, the SPS part of the measure will be considered under the SPS Agreement.Simon Baughen, International Trade and the Protection of the Environment (Routledge-Cavendish, 2007) 53. If a measure conforms with SPS, under Article 2.4 of the SPS Agreement, it is assumed that the measure falls within the scope of GATT, Article XX(b). Criticism=Economic considerations Trade in the products subject to SPS-type measures have the potential to result in significant economic gains for national economies.Matthew Arthur, 'An Economic Analysis of Quarantine: The Economics of Australia's Ban on New Zealand Apple Imports' (Paper presented at the New Zealand Agricultural and Resource Economics Society Conference, Nelson, August 24‚Äì25, 2006) 2 Favouring economic concerns over other important public health policy issues, however, is something that requires close scrutiny by governments and the international community.Markus Wagner, 'Law Talk v. Science Talk: The Languages of Law and Science in WTO Proceedings' (2011) 35 Fordham International Law Journal 151-200, 194-198 The SPS Agreement reflects the precautionary principle ‚Äì a principle which allows them to act on the side of caution if there is no scientific certainty about potential threats to human health and the environment. Under Article 5.7 Members who enact provisional measures are obligated to seek further information on possible risks and review the measure 'within a reasonable period of time'. The Appellate Body in Japan‚Äì Measures Affecting Agricultural Products, stated that the length of a 'reasonable period of time' is to be assessed on a case-by- case basis.Appellate Body Report, Japan ‚Äì Measures Affecting Agricultural Products, WTO Doc WT/DS76/R, 61 (October 27, 1998 Under SPS rules, the burden of proof is on the complainant country to demonstrate that a measure violates Article 2.2 and Articles 5.1-5.8 before it can be regulatedSimon Baughen, International Trade and the Protection of the Environment (Routledge- Cavendish, 2007) 54 even though scientific evidence can never be conclusive and it is not possible to test for all health risks that could arise from importation of a certain product.William Kerr and Jill Hobbs, 'Consumers, Cows and Carousels: Why the Dispute over Beef Hormones is Far More Important than its Commercial Value' in Nicholas Perdikis and Robert Read (eds), The WTO and the regulation of international trade : recent trade disputes between the European Union and the United States (Edward Elgar Publishing Limited, 2005) 193 Impact on developing countries It is important that the views of developing countries are incorporated into the standard-setting process as the effect of exporting countries enacting SPS measures can be damaging to developing economies. This is partly due to these states not possessing the technology and resources needed to readily comply with certain SPS requirements.Das, 'Coping with SPS Challenges in India: WTO and Beyond',973-974, 1006 Impact of consumer pressure on adherence Some commentators pose that the WTO's assumption that trade liberalisation enhances consumer welfare, has resulted in the SPS Agreement being ill-equipped to deal with trade restrictions put in place by governments responding to protectionist pressure from consumers.Kerr and Hobbs, , 'Consumers, Cows and Carousels: Why the Dispute over Beef Hormones is Far More Important than its Commercial Value', 191-192. This was most noticeable in the Beef Hormones Dispute where, although the science pointed to the relative safety of the growth hormones in question, European consumers pressured governments to ban the import of hormone-treated beef.Tracey Epps, 'Reconciling public opinion and WTO rules under the SPS Agreement' (2008) 7(2) World Trade Review, 359-392, 360 See also * Codex Alimentarius *

Christened simply George Hunter, he adopted the name Leslie in San Francisco, and Leslie Hunter became his professional name. Showing an aptitude for drawing at an early age, he was largely self-taught, receiving only elementary painting lessons from a family acquaintance. He spent fifteen formative years from the age of fifteen in the US, mainly in California. He then returned to Scotland, painting and drawing there and in Paris. Subsequently, he travelled widely in Europe, especially in the South of France, but also in the Netherlands, the Pas de Calais and Italy. Hunter painted a variety of still-lifes, landscapes and portraits, and his paintings are critically acclaimed for their treatment of light and the effects of light. They became popular with more progressive critics and collectors during his lifetime and have grown to command high prices since his death, becoming among the most popular in Scotland.  Biography = Early life  Hunter was born in Rothesay, at 7 Tower Street, on the Isle of Bute on 7 August 1877. He was the youngest child of five, born to William and Jeanie (n√©e Stewart) Hunter. George, as he was then known, showed an aptitude for drawing when very young and when he was about thirteen, his mother arranged for him to have painting lessons with a lady acquaintance. In February 1892, Hunter's elder sister Catherine died. Shortly after, in March, another elder sibling, James, also died. Both were in their early twenties. It is thought they may have been victims of an influenza pandemic. William, the father, and Jeanie, seem already to have contemplated emigrating, because a home had been sold. Evidently, the tragic deaths sealed the matter, and the remaining family departed for California via New York on 1 September 1892, aboard the SS Ethiopia.  Emigration to California and move to San Francisco, leaving parents  Hunter was fifteen when he emigrated with his parents and two surviving siblings to California. Initially, he lived with his family on an orange grove, 50 miles east of Los Angeles. He continued sketching and loved the climate, but showed little interest in farm management. Hunter began making a living in 1896, primarily as a newspaper and journal illustrator. He mixed with significant literary figures such as Bret Harte and Jack London, who were associated with the San Francisco Bohemian Club. Hunter provided illustrations for Overland Monthly. In 1899, a full-page black and white drawing for Overland Monthly is signed G. Leslie Hunter, the first recorded occasion of his use of \\"Leslie.\\" In 1902, Hunter became part of a group of artists that included Maynard Dixon and Arthur Putnam. They desired independence from the hierarchies of the establishment art world and, together, they formed the California Society of Arts as an alternative to the conservative San Francisco Art Association. Clearly, Hunter had a completely different artistic exposure compared with others of the Scottish Colourists group, such as John Duncan Fergusson or Samuel John Peploe. Hunter was at this stage quite a successful American graphic artist, considering his young age. \\"Sunset, The Pacific Monthly\\", was another journal commissioning his work and altogether, Smith & Marriner catalogue over two hundred publication and book illustrations commissioned from Hunter.  Beginnings in fine art  Figures in conversation, √âtaples, one of the paintings from 1914 in which Hunter established his style In 1904, Hunter made a visit to Paris, funded by his earnings as an illustrator. He was inspired by the numerous artistic experiences there, and became fully resolved to take up oil painting. When he returned to San Francisco in 1905, he began preparing for his first solo exhibition, which was to be held the following year. However, Hunter's early work was destroyed in the fire that followed the 1906 San Francisco earthquake, and he returned to Scotland shortly afterwards, settling in Glasgow. Initially he continued to make his living there primarily as an illustrator. His oil painting began with still lifes on black backgrounds, influenced by the Dutch style. In 1908, whilst back in Paris, Hunter met Alice Toklas, whom he had known previously in San Francisco. She took him to see the art collection at 27 rue de Fleurus, that was being started by Gertrude Stein and her brother Leo Stein. The collection included wildly-coloured Fauve works by Matisse, and early works by Picasso. Toklas wrote that the pictures shocked Hunter profoundly, and he wished he had never gone to see the them. Nevertheless his consciousness had been jolted. Hunter began to achieve limited success after a trip to the Etaples art colony in northern France in 1914. Here, inspired by French art and the local landscape, he began to develop the style and ability that would later identify him as a colourist.See his \\"Beach figures\\" and the related \\"Figures in Conversation\\". However, the onset of the First World War forced him to return to Scotland, where his work became noticed by Alexander Reid of Reid & Lefevre. In 1915, Hunter held his first one-man exhibition with Reid in Glasgow. Hunter's work at this stage of his career focused primarily on still lifes, inspired by Chardin, Kalf and Manet. During the 1920s, Hunter began to be associated with a group of three other artists: John Duncan Fergusson, F. C. B. Cadell, and Samuel Peploe. The four of them became known as the Scottish Colourists, although the term was not used until 1948, by which time only Fergusson was still alive.  European travel and return to Fife  In 1922, Hunter began to make a series of trips to mainland Europe, where he visited Paris, Venice, Florence and the Riviera. Fergusson accompanied him on a number of these visits. Hunter's visits abroad produced a large number of paintings and his style changed noticeably in this period of European travel as he began using dabs of colour placed instinctively to portray underlying form. When Hunter returned from his first series of trips abroad, in 1922, he settled in Fife, on the east coast of Scotland and, between 1924 and 1927, he remained in Scotland, dividing his time between Fife and Glasgow. His paintings from this period include a number inspired by views of Loch Lomond, and these landscapes increasingly took inspiration from the work of C√©zanne to create colourful and atmospheric compositions. In 1925, Hunter's work was displayed at an exhibition in Leicester Square in London, along with works by Peploe, Cadell and Fergusson. Walter Sickert, in his introduction to the exhibition, wrote that \\"Hunter uses the refractory ... to inspired ends on normal and traditional lines\\". Hunter travelled again to the South of France on a number of occasions between 1927 and 1929, and based himself at Saint-Paul-de-Vence. He sent paintings back to Reid to be exhibited in Glasgow and London, but he spent a great deal of time sketching and his output of finished oil paintings was low. One exhibition in London had to be postponed due to a lack of paintings. The France trips culminated in 1929 with a critically acclaimed exhibition at the Ferargil Galleries in New York.  London, ill-health and death  However, shortly after returning to the French Riviera in 1929, Hunter suffered a severe breakdown, forcing his sister to bring him home to Scotland in September. He recovered, and began to paint a number of portraits of his friends, including one of Dr Tom Honeyman, the Director of the Glasgow Art Gallery and Museum from 1939 until 1954. Honeyman, at the time an art dealer, had assisted Hunter in developing his career, and painting the portrait may have been a gesture of thanks. In 1930 he embarked upon a series of drawings and watercolours of Hyde Park, which were due to be exhibited in London. Hunter hoped to move to the city permanently, as he found it livelier than Glasgow and the art market was more secure. However, his health deteriorated and he began to suffer badly from stomach pains. He died in Glasgow in the Claremont Nursing Home on 7 December 1931, aged 54. The cause of death was cardiac failure due to blood poisoning, following an unsuccessful gall bladder operation. A member of Glasgow Art Club, work by Hunter was included in the club's Memorial Exhibition of 1935, in memory of those of its members who had died since the First World War.Glasgow Herald article 9 April 1935 ‚Äò‚ÄôGlasgow Art Club ‚Äì Memorial Exhibition Opened‚Äô‚Äô Retrieved 17 August 2011  Popularity  Hunter's paintings were popular with critics during his lifetime, and he had successful exhibitions in Glasgow, London and New York. Shortly before his death, the Glasgow Herald commented that while Hunter was already \\"well known as a painter of landscape and still-life,\\" his move to portrait painting would \\"cause a good deal of interest and discussion.\\" Many years after his death, solo exhibitions of Hunter's paintings were still held and, in 1953, the display of a selection of watercolours and paintings in Glasgow attracted numerous visitors. The art critic of the Glasgow Herald described the \\"varied and uneven genius\\" of the painter, and praised one painting as having been executed with \\"such a freedom and economy of touch one cannot well see how any amount of extra thought or technical application could have bettered it.\\" Paintings by Hunter have gone on to sell for large sums in the early 21st century, with one painting described as the \\"star lot\\" in a Bonhams auction in June 2010 selling for ¬£144,000. Another painting was sold in June 2010 for ¬£78,000. Nick Curnow, head of pictures at Lyon & Turnbull, said of it \\"This is a very special painting, so typical of Hunter.\\"  Style  Hunter focused for much of his life on landscapes and on still lifes, working in both pen and ink and oil on canvas. His still lifes of fruit are particularly distinctive, but he also painted a variety of landscapes, especially of Scotland and France. In his earlier paintings, Hunter was influenced by C√©zanne to produce domestic landscapes. Later, however, in common with the other members of the Scottish colourists movement, he was heavily influenced by contemporary French artists like Monet and Matisse, and his paintings began to make bolder and more energetic use of colour. Hunter particularly strove to capture in his paintings the effects of light, and would repeatedly paint the same objects or locations under a range of lighting conditions. His brush style was influenced by the French avant garde and, especially in his later work, is described by art critics as '\\"open and free\\" and \\"energetic\\".

He was nominated for the Nobel prize in literature eight times.  Life  He was born Emilius Jakob Frida in Louny.Register of births, 1853 He lived ten years with his uncle, a pastor near Kol√≠n. Here he attended the first years of primary school from 1857 to 1861), and the briefly in Kol√≠n from 1861 to 1862. He studied at a grammar school in Slan√Ω from 1862, where he was a classmate of V√°clav Bene≈° T≈ôeb√≠zsk√Ω, also in Prague and in 1872 graduated from Klatovy. Guided by his uncle's example, Vrchlick√Ω joined after graduating from the Prague Archbishop's seminary. But in 1873, he transferred to the Faculty of Arts of Charles- Ferdinand University in Prague, where he studied history, philosophy and Romance philology. During his studies he studied with historian Ernest Denis. His first literary work was printed by editor Sofie Podlipsk√°. In Prague, he formed friendships with Zikmund Winter, Josef V√°clav Sl√°dek and Alois Jirasek. They formed the group Lum√≠rovci. From 1875, he worked as a secretary and tutor to the sons of noble family Montecuccoli-Laderchi, first in Merano near Modena, and later Livorno. After returning briefly he worked at the pedagogical institute in Prague in Manor Street. Through the intercession of Leopold, Count von Thun und Hohenstein, in 1877 he was appointed secretary of the Prague Czech Polytechnic, and later became a professor of modern science and was awarded an honorary doctorate. In 1901 he, along with Antonin Dvorak, was knighted, and Austrian Emperor Franz Joseph I. appointed him a member of the Upper House of the Imperial Council in Vienna. Vrchlick√Ω defended the requirement of universal suffrage. He was a member of the Royal Academy of Padua, a member of the Polish Society of Paris and also an honorary citizen of many Czech towns. In 1893 he was appointed professor of European literature at Charles University. He was also a member of the Czech Academy of Sciences and Arts (appointed by the Emperor 20 April 1890). At that time (1903‚Äì1904) he also became acquainted with Milan Rastislav ≈†tef√°nikPRECL√çK, Vratislav.

He also wrote epic poetry, plays, prose and literary essays and translated widely from various languages, introducing e.g. Dante, Goethe, Shelley, Baudelaire, Poe, and Whitman to Czech literature. He was one of the main voices in Lum√≠r magazine from 1851. Vrchlick√Ω's life was the subject of a 1997 novel, Za trochu l√°sky.... Critical reputation During and even after his life, Vrchlick√Ω was never universally positively acknowledged. His foreign orientation became a source of criticism in the late 1870s, he was deemed to be overlooking local thematic and, in effect, the needs of the Czech national life. Eli≈°ka Kr√°snohorsk√° recognized his poetic talent, but had objections to the romantic utilization of foreign sources, which, in her view, didn't contribute to the fight for national independence. At the beginning of the 1890s, a time when he was considered to be the greatest Czech poet and received numerous official awards, he came into conflict with the younger generation of poets and literary critics, who saw his works as superficial, lacking in originality and heavy with clich√©s. He was viewed as a symbol of the past, which he took very hard.. Examples of these critics are (the three years older) Tom√°≈° Garrigue Masaryk, who only viewed him as a good translator, and F. X. ≈†alda. Only in the last period of his artistic creation, when he managed to once more create unconventional verse, was he acknowledged by the younger generation of S.K.Neumann and K.Toman. The generation following (e. g. Viktor Dyk, Lev Blatn√Ω and Jaroslav Seifert) subsequently fully understood the merit of his work. Today he is often viewed as one of the greatest Czech poets of all times. Works Vrchlick√Ω's expansive work contains about 270 volumes, including over 80 poetry collections and 50 plays. His poetry collections and dramas are a prime example of formal perfection, yet quite readable. Vrchlick√Ω tried to prove that Czech is a language that can express everything. He wanted to write poetry that would be comparable to other European works and move the Czech literature to a higher level. PoetryLyric poetry= Vrchlick√Ω's early poetry expresses his perception of life through natural motifs. It deals with love experiences, youthful pessimism and artistic self- doubt. His reflections are shown in natural imagery, his poems praise the ideals of art and beauty. It is represented mainly by the collections: * Z hlubin (1875) - mainly love poetry * Vittoria Colonna (1877) - praise of love and work of aging Michelangelo * Rok na jihu (1878) - natural and love poetry * Symfonie (1878) - reflection and loneliness Romantic and intimate poetry forms an important part of Vrchlick√Ω's work. This poetry, initially full of pagan mythology, later very personal, has woman at its focal point. He convincingly expressed all subtleties of romantic relationship and marital and family happiness. It is represented by: * Eklogy a p√≠snƒõ (1880) * Dojmy a rozmary (1880) * Pout√≠ k Eldor√°du (1882) * Co ≈æivot dal (1883) * Jak t√°hla mraƒçna (1885) * ƒåarovn√° zahrada (1888) * Dni a noci (1889) Some of his collections contain very complicated stanza forms, which he used to enrich Czech poetry. Complex composition is very notable in: * Hudba v du≈°i (1886) ‚Äì a combination of sestinas with oriental ghazals and ballades. * Moje son√°ta (1893) * Zlat√Ω prach (1886 a 1897) ‚Äì collection consisting of two parts written in different periods, the main form is rondeau Collections of sonnets form a separate category, which he wrote throughout his life. There is no common theme, but all depict his feeling and emotions: * Sonety samot√°≈ôe (1885) * Nov√© sonety samot√°≈ôe (1891) * Posledn√≠ sonety samot√°≈ôe (1896) 1890s works share a common theme of Vrchlick√Ω's existential crisis and express the feelings of melancholy, pessimism, disillusionment and resignation: * Ho≈ôk√° j√°dra (1889) * Brev√≠≈ô modern√≠ho ƒçlovƒõka (1891) * Bodl√°ƒç√≠ z Parnasu (1893) * ·∫∫ morta (1894, 1893) * Okna v bou≈ôi (1894) * P√≠snƒõ poutn√≠ka (1895) * Ne≈æ zmlknu docela (1895) * Pavuƒçiny (1897) * Skvrny na slunci (1897) Vrchlick√Ω's late works show calm, balance and a new belief in the meaning of life and work. After the previous weakening of creativity his poetry became less pathetic and hasty. The verse is simpler and more melodic. * Fanf√°ry a kadence (1906) * Kor√°lov√© ostrovy (1908) * Strom ≈æivota (1909) =Epic poetry= * Zlomky epopeje (1878 ‚Äì 1906) Duch a svƒõt, the first collection belonging to Zlomky epopeje Freely composed cycle of both epic and lyric poems which tries to depict the advancement of humanity and path towards humanism. The vast poetry collections which contain all most all of Vrchlick√Ω's epic poetry are not chronologically sorted. Prose Vrchlick√Ω wrote prose only occasionally and mostly short stories. * Pov√≠dky ironick√© a sentiment√°ln√≠ (1886) * Barevn√© st≈ôepy (1887) * Nov√© barevn√© st≈ôepy (1892) * Loutky (1908) ‚Äì autobiographical Drama His plays were written for the National Theatre in Prague, which was constructed in his thirties (1881).

Its first President was Prime Minister U Nu, who started a Burmese translation job at Judson College (now University of Yangon). The purpose was to translate world culture, literature, education for the Burmese public. In 1963 the society was absorbed into the Ministry of Information's Printing and Publishing Enterprise as the Sarpay Beikman Literature House, and the mandate was extended to encourage local writers and to print and publish books of all types. The society presents the annual Sarpay Beikman Manuscript Awards and Burma National Literature Awards for excellent new unpublished and published writing in various categories. Early years After independence the Burmese Translation Society decided that independent Burma need a Burmese Encyclopedia and began the project to compile one in May 1948. Initially, they wanted to translate Sir John Hamilton's encyclopedia into 10 volumes. Shortly after this (in 1949), they stopped direct translation and completed the project with Burmese related articles including facts on the arts and sciences. Volume No. 1 was printed in 1954; the last volume (No. 15) was completed and printed in 1976. The first five volumes were printed in England, but after that the society started using its own press in Rangoon, After that, yearly volumes of updates were published. In 1951, a translation with pictures of a history of the years 1900 to 1950 was printed in the Netherlands. Then in 1957, Lu Htu Thekpan, comprising 30 volumes for science technologies, were initiated for publishing. They helped the Ministry of Education with the publication of text books for schools. The Burmese Translation Society did not only translate books but also encouraged many other forms of Burmese culture and literature activities. The Society established a free library in Rangoon 1956. By 2011 the library had 50,000 book titles in the main section and another 12,000 book titles in the reference section. In March 2011 a branch of the Sarpay Beikman Library was established in Mandalay. Sarpay Beikman Sarpay Beikman House in Yangon, now owned by Ministry of Communications and Information Technology The Burma Translation Society was renamed \\"Sarpay Beikman\\" (Palace of Literature) in 1963 when it was absorbed into the Ministry of Information. The government chose the organization as the vehicle for funding and executing policy in the areas of educational writing and serious literature. The mandate of the Sarpay Beikman was to \\"improve and enrich the general knowledge of all the nationals of the Union\\". The management board was to compile outstanding work of foreign literature and other branches of knowledge for translation into Burmese or other indigenous languages. It was to print and publish these works at the lowest possible price. Textbooks were subject to approval by the government, and had to be in line with socialist policy. The Management Board decided that in addition it would award prizes for good fiction and research in Burmese literature and fine arts and would sponsor seminars and training courses on writing, book production, journalism and librarianism. Sarpay Beikman would also produce and distribute all sorts of written material, run a book club, run a bookshop in Rangoon to sell government publications including its own publications, and open a public reading room and lending library. Sarpay Beikman tends to concentrate on educational works rather than fiction, with the exception of children's books for which there is demand that is unfilled by private publishers. The society also published the English-language magazine Open Mind, renamed to Spectrum after 1962. With declining numbers of English readers in the country, it was decided to launch a Burmese version, but with articles geared to the interests of Burmese readers. Sarpay Beikman also arranged large meetings where a leading scholar or writer would present an extensive survey of the discussion topic, and then other speakers could question the speaker, comment or make their own contribution. There proven highly popular, so much so that secondary speakers sometimes had to be drawn by lot. Following the seminar the society publishes a book with the main contributions. Awards The society began to present the Sarpay Beikman Awards (K. 1000) in 1949. They were renamed the Literary Fine Art Awards in 1962 and the National Literary Awards in 1965. The awards were presented to authors who submitted manuscripts in categories such novel, translation, general literature, general knowledge, short story, poems, and dramas. The prizes were awarded annually, and the manuscripts published. Entries had to comply with five general principles: the works must support or at least agree with the ruling party aims, foster Burmese culture, promote patriotism, help build character and advance ideas and contribute useful knowledge. A first, second and third prize was awarded in each category where there were suitable entries, which was not always the case. From 1970 a new system was started. Unpublished works were submitted in competition for the Sarpay Beikman Manuscript Awards. However, the National Literary Awards, one per category, were selected from books that had been published in the previous year. Although 12 awards could be given, the selection committee usually chose fewer, since it is often not possible to find a publication that meets the guidelines, particularly in the \\"novel\\" category. In recent years the genres covered by Sarpay Beikman Manuscript and National Literary Awards have been gradually extended and the number of awards increased. Relatively few translators are honored. In 2008 no translation prize was given at all. This may in part be due to financial constraints, in part to censorship and interference in what is translated by the military regime.

It is distinguished from recklessness because, on a subjective basis, there is foresight but no desire to produce the consequences. But the perennial problem has always been the extent to which the court can impute sufficient desire to convert recklessness into intention. The original rule was objective. DPP v Smith(1961) AC 290 changed this by saying that the test was that a person was taken to foresee and intend the natural and probable consequences of his or her acts. Parliament reacted with s 8 of the Criminal Justice Act 1967 to restore the position originally at common law. In Frankland v The Queen,[1987] AC 576 Lord Ackner held DPP v Smith to be incorrect insofar as it required objective foresight in determining intention of murder, saying that the common law reflected s 8 of the 1967 Act. Given that s8 of the Criminal Justice Act 1967 now entitles a jury to draw reasonable inferences from all the evidence, Wien J. said in R v Belfon(1976) 3 All ER 46 that: > Foresight and recklessness are evidence from which intent may be inferred > but they cannot be equated...with intent. Thus, when as in R v Moloney(1985) 1 All ER 1025 the defendant gets into an argument with his stepfather about who could load a shotgun and fire quickest, in the argument the stepfather was shot dead and Moloney was charged with murder. Lord Bridge held there was no rule that foresight of probable consequences was equivalent to, or alternative to, the necessary intention for a crime of specific intent. (Moloney established that a person can have intention, where they did not want the result but merely foresaw it.) rather, the question of foresight of consequences was a part of the law of evidence. Lord Bridge gives the example of a man boarding a plane which he knows to be bound for Manchester. He \\"conclusively demonstrates\\" his intention to go there. It is not merely evidence from which such intention may be inferred. In the rare case where it may be necessary to direct a jury by reference to foresight of consequences, two questions arise: > (a) was death or very serious injury a natural consequence of the > defendant's voluntary act? (b) did the defendant foresee that consequence as > being a natural consequence of his act? If the answer to both questions was in the affirmative, an inference could be drawn that the defendant had intended that consequence. What was a \\"natural\\" consequence? > ...in the ordinary course of events a certain act will lead to a certain > consequence unless something unexpected supervenes to prevent it... [and] > the probability of the consequence taken to have been foreseen must be > little short of overwhelming before it will suffice to establish the > necessary intent. The issue then focused on the probability that the particular harm will result from what is done. In R v Hancock & Shankland(1986) 1 ALL ER 641 Lord Scarman puts it: > ..the greater the probability of a consequence the more likely it is that > the consequence was foreseen and if that consequence was foreseen, the > greater the probability is that it was also intended. In R v Nedrick(1986) 83 Cr. App. R. 267 the Court of Appeal through Lord Lane summarised the law as follows: > ...if the jury are satisfied that at the material time the defendant > recognised that death or serious harm would be virtually certain (barring > some unforeseen intervention) to result from his voluntary act, then that is > a fact from which they may find it easy to infer that he intended to kill or > do serious bodily harm, even though he may not have had any desire to > achieve that result...Where the charge is murder and in the rare cases where > the simple direction is not enough, the jury should be directed that they > are not entitled to infer the necessary intention unless they feel sure that > death or serious bodily harm was a virtual certainty (barring some > unforeseen intervention) as a result of the defendant's actions and that the > defendant appreciated that such was the case. After Lord Steyn's judgment in R v Woollin(1998) 4 All ER 103 (HL) (affirmed in R v Matthews & Alleyne [2004]) it is clear that, based on R v Moloney, foresight of death or grievous bodily harm as a mere probability is insufficient. This confirms R v Nedrick subject to the substitution of \\"infer\\" for \\"find\\". > Where the charge is murder and in the rare cases where the simple direction > is not enough, the jury should be directed that they are not entitled to > find the necessary intention unless they feel sure that death or serious > bodily harm was a virtual certainty (barring some unforeseen intervention) > as a result of the defendant's action and that the defendant appreciated > that such was the case. It is clear that Lord Steyn intended that a virtual or moral certainty test should necessarily lead to a finding of intention. But by phrasing the guidelines in terms of what the jury are not entitled to do, the clarity of the direction is compromised. He may have felt that the jury are entitled to indirectly infer but not directly find intention. It would have been better expressed as a positive; i.e. \\"if the jury are sure that the defendant foresaw death or grievous bodily harm as a virtual certainty this equals intention\\". Nevertheless, it seems that \\"a result foreseen as virtually certain is an intended result\\", It is not clear that Lord Steyn intended the above meaning. Parliament required that the jury not be directed to find intention, and Lord Steyn cannot have intended to contravene Parliament's wishes. Where the jury are sure that the defendant foresaw the required level of harm to be a virtual certainty this is evidence which the jury may consider in consideration of whether the defendant personally intended this harm. Double effect In medical cases the doctrine of double effect can be used as a defence. As was established by Judge Devlin in the 1957 trial of Dr John Bodkin Adams, causing death through the administration of lethal drugs to a patient, if the intention is solely to alleviate pain, is not considered murder even if death is a potential or even likely outcome.Margaret Otlowski, Voluntary Euthanasia and the Common Law, Oxford University Press, 1997, pp. 175-177 Proposals for reform In 1978, the Law Commission of England and Wales published a Report on the Mental Element in Crime and proposed a revised definition of intention (to apply to all intention-based offences): :a person should be regarded as intending a particular result of his conduct if, but only if, either he actually intends that result or he has no substantial doubt that the conduct will have that result\\". In 1980 the Criminal Law Revision Committee, in its Report on Offences Against the Person, rejected a test based on knowledge of a high probability that death will result from one's actions. This was felt to be unsatisfactory because a test expressed in terms of probability was so uncertain in result. However, the Committee felt that it would be too narrow to confine intent to cases where the accused desires a certain result, preferring to include cases where the accused knows a particular result will follow. Therefore, according to the Committee a person intends a result when he: :(i)...wants the particular result to follow from his act, or :(ii)...though he may not want the result to follow, knows that in the ordinary course of things it will do so. In 1985, The Law Commission Report on Codification of the Criminal Law proposed the following definition of murder: :A person who kills another: ::(a) intending to kill; or ::(b) intending to cause serious injury and being aware that he may kill; [or ::(c) intending to cause fear of death or serious injury and being aware that he may kill] :is guilty of murder. The definition of intention provides that someone \\"intends\\" a result when: :...he wants it to exist or occur, is aware that it exists or is almost certain that it exists or will exist or occur. In 1993, the Law Commission revisited the definition of 'intention' proposing that: :[A] person acts....'intentionally' with respect to a result when: :(i) it is his purpose to cause it; or :(ii) although it is not his purpose to cause that result, he knows that it would occur in the ordinary course of events if he were to succeed in his purpose of causing some other result. In 2006 the Law Commission‚Äôs made its most recent recommendation on the meaning of intention (Murder, Manslaughter and Infanticide (Report No. 304 HC 30) at para 3.27): \\"We recommend that the existing law governing the meaning of intention is codified as follows: :(1) A person should be taken to intend a result if he or she acts in order to bring it about. :(2) In cases where the judge believes that justice may not be done unless an expanded understanding of intention is given, the jury should be directed as follows: an intention to bring about a result may be found if it is shown that the defendant thought that the result was a virtually certain consequence of his or her action\\" References Further reading  *Kaveny, C.M., Inferring Intention from Foresight, (2004) LQR 120. *The Law Commission of England and Wales, Report on the Mental Element in Crime, Law Commission Report No. 89, (1978) *Criminal Law Revision Committee of England and Wales, Offences Against the Person Cmnd 7844, 14th Report, (1980) *The Law Commission of England and Wales, Codification of the Criminal Law, Law Commission Report No. 143, (1985) *Norrie, A., Oblique Intent and Legal Politics, (1989) CLR 793. *Pedain, A., Intention and the Terrorist Example, (2003) CLR 549. *Smith, J.C., R v Woollin (1998) CLR 890.

Biography Conybeare was born in Coulsdon, Surrey, the third son of a barrister, John Charles Conybeare, and grandson of the geologist William Daniel Conybeare. He took an interest in the Order of Corporate Reunion, an Old Catholic organisation, becoming a Bishop in it in 1894. Also in the 1890s he wrote a book on the Dreyfus case, as a Dreyfusard, and translated the Testament of Solomon and other early Christian texts. As well, he did influential work on Barlaam and Josaphat. He was an authority on the Armenian Church. From 1904 to 1915 he was a member of the Rationalist Press Association, founded in 1899. One of his best-known works is Myth, Magic, and Morals from 1909, later reissued under the title The Origins of Christianity. This has been read both as strong criticism of the Jesus myth theory, making Conybeare a supporter of the historical Jesus; but also as an attack on aspects of orthodox Christianity itself. He returned later in 1914 to make a direct assault on leading proponents of the time of the Jesus-myth theory. He died in 1924 aged 68 and is buried in Brompton Cemetery, London.

A member of the Royal College of Surgeons, fellow of the Royal Society and a Freemason, Charles was a homoeopath and surgeon, with an interest in medical astrology, vegetarianism, improved care for the mentally ill and the cessation of vivisection. Biography Born in Westminster, London, he was the son of court tailor Richard David Pearce (1780‚Äì1820) and Sarah 'Sally' Bouchet (1777‚Äì1855). His mother was of Huguenot descent, her father and brother being noted Southwark brassfounders. Charles married a woman ten years his senior named Elizabeth Eagles at St. George's, Hanover Square, the daughter of a Pimlico carpenter and sister of James Eagles, Shoreditch organ builder, who restored the great instrument in Canterbury Cathedral, in addition to furnishing a number of new churches in Tasmania and Australia. Together, Charles and Elizabeth had four children. Charles was a Philosophical Instrument maker in 1840, the year his second son Alfred John Pearce (1840‚Äì1923) was born. Alfred would become a celebrated medical astrologer and popular almanacist, ‚Ä≥the immortal Zadkiel‚Ä≥,North British Daily Mail ‚Äì 19 October 1888, page 4.‚Ä≥the world-famed Prophet‚Ä≥,London Daily News ‚Äì 12 October 1904, page 6. who worked in collaboration with his father as his assistant in the early 1870s.Patrick Curry, \\"Pearce, Alfred James (1840‚Äì1923)\\", Oxford Dictionary of National Biography, Oxford University Press, 2004 accessed 17 Aug 2007 Alfred would become an initiate of the Hermetic Order of the Golden Dawn.Hermetic Order of the Golden Dawn: Biographies of Members https://zenodo.org/record/1101071#.XoMe5tNKhpU Charles Thomas Pearce lived for some time at St. Dunstan's Villa, Regent's Park, the home of his sponsor, Sir Richard Rawlinson Vyvyan (1800‚Äì1879), Tory politician, Fellow of the Royal Society, a geologist and a metaphysician. Charles was \\"for some years engaged with him in scientific experiments and researches on light, heat, and magnetism.\\" Notes taken by Charles whilst thus \\"engaged with Sir R. Vyvyan ... in researches on the magnetism of the Moon's rays,\\" were later recorded in a volume entitled \\"The Weather Guide Book\\", published by Charles's son, Alfred John Pearce, in 1864. In 1849, as a medical student, Charles patented an \\"Apparatus for obtaining light by electric agency,\\" a system published in various journals, including the \\"Repository of Arts\\" (vol.14, page 193) and the \\"Mechanics' Magazine\\" (vo.51, page 189), as well as being registered at the Enrolment Office. It was also in 1849 that he was acquitted of a charge of manslaughter brought by the reformer Thomas Wakley, (an appointed coroner) after his brother David Richard Pearce's death from cholera. The prosecution dropped the case during trial after a judge concluded the death was unrelated to Pearce's attempt, authorised by another physician, to treat it by homoeopathy.Central Criminal Court, 27 Oct.., The Times, 29 October 1849 The homoeopathic community raised two hundred pounds for Pearce's defence, and Pearce's barristers argued that the \\"indictment was merely an attack on the homeopathic system\\". Charles published his arguments against smallpox vaccination in several books including Essay on Vaccination (1868), and campaigned vigorously for the better treatment of the mentally ill. His own wife, Elizabeth Eagles (1805‚Äì79), died with \\"religious mania\\" in the Peckham House Lunatic Asylum. In 1868, Charles patented \\"an invention of improvements in the means of disinfecting or deodorizing rooms, buildings, and ships, applicable also in other purposes.\\" His principal purpose was to find a way to preserve meat and thereby bring to an end the cruel transport of livestock on long ship journeys. This same year, he was elected a fellow of the Royal Society. From 1872‚Äì76, he ran a Hydropathic & Homeopathic Clinic at 'Woodstock House', 19, Nottingham Place, York Gate, Marylebone, in London, until it was closed by a well-publicised scandal involving a fraudulent patient, named Frank Hans Hamilton, and Charles's matron ‚Äì whom, it was intimated in court, had borne his child. In 1878, he founded the Hydropathic Establishment & Sanatorium at Durleston Park, on the cliffs above Swanage, Dorset, with his much younger mistress, Annie Kay, who went by the pseudonym of 'Mrs. Agnes Ann Parker'. Charles Thomas Pearce died on 9 May 1883, at a villa called 'Lessie', in Avenue Road, Torquay, on the Devonshire coast. He is the maternal 3-great grandfather of British author and charity-founder David Charles Manners.http://sueyounghistories.com/archives/2009/04/04/charles-thomas- pearce-1815-1883/https://davidcharlesmanners.wordpress.com/2017/03/25/the- orphic-circle/ Publications * 1853, Diarrh≈ìa and Cholera: their hom≈ìopathic treatment and prevention briefly described, Northampton. * 1858, \\"The Medical Practitioners Bill: a brief analysis of its oppressive and unconstitutional clauses, addressed to the Earl of Derby\\", J.

Aboriginal deaths in custody is a political and social issue in Australia. It rose in prominence in the early 1980s, with Aboriginal activists campaigning following the death of 16-year-old John Peter Pat in 1983. Subsequent deaths in custody, considered suspicious by families of the deceased, culminated in the 1987 Royal Commission into Aboriginal Deaths in Custody (RCIADIC). The final RCIADIC report, published in 1991, did not find higher rates of death of Aboriginal people compared to non-Aboriginal people; however, it did highlight deficiencies in care, both systemic and individual, and disproportionate rates of imprisonment due to historical and social factors. , Aboriginal people maintain a disproportionate level of exposure to the justice system and incarceration in Australia. One of the recommendations of the RCIADIC was that statistics and other information on Aboriginal and non-Aboriginal deaths in custody should be monitored nationally on an ongoing basis, by the Australian Institute of Criminology (AIC). As Australian census and prison statistics include both Aboriginal and Torres Strait Islander people, the counts have included both groups, as Indigenous Australians. Deaths have continued since 1991: between 1991 and June 2020 there have been at least 437 Indigenous deaths in custody (both prison and police). While the majority of deaths occurring in prison custody have been of natural causes (58%), hanging deaths accounted for 32%, but the latter have shown a marked decrease in recent years. Indigenous people are now less likely than non- Indigenous people to die in prison custody. Of deaths in police custody, the total between mid-1991 and mid-2016 was 146, with 47% attributed to accidental death (with most of these happening under police pursuit). 21% were attributed to natural causes, with self-inflicted deaths accounting for 19%. There is, however, a number of cases in which calls have been made for greater scrutiny, as avoidable deaths, such as those of Ms Dhu, Tanya Day, David Dungay and Rebecca Maher. Additional protests focussing on Aboriginal deaths in custody, accompanied by renewed media attention, were triggered by the killing of George Floyd in the US as part of the June 2020 protests in Australia. Aboriginal deaths in custody and high incarceration rates were originally absent from the Australian Government's \\"Closing the Gap\\" strategy. As part of a 2018 pivot to a new phase, the Council of Australian Governments (COAG) drafted targets to reduce Aboriginal custody rates by 2028. Background=Royal Commission into Aboriginal Deaths in Custody Concern about the high number of Aboriginal people who had died in custody in the 1980s led to the establishment of the Royal Commission into Aboriginal Deaths in Custody (RCIDIAC) in 1987, to investigate and report upon the underlying social, cultural and legal issues behind the deaths, including allegations of mistreatment of prisoners which may have led to their deaths. It ran from 1987 to 1991, investigating the period between 1 January 1980 and 31 May 1989, producing its final report in April 1991. The 1988 Australian Institute of Criminology publication, Aboriginal Deaths in Custody, says \\"The issue of Aboriginal deaths in prisons and holding cells is particularly complex\\". The report looks at the cases identified by RCIADIC by April 1988. Criminologist Duncan Chappell, in his introduction to the report, writes that while the \\"problem of death in custody is by no means limited to Aboriginals\\", the \\"problem of Aboriginal deaths in custody is linked to fundamental issues which go beyond matters of criminal justice. It would be unfortunate if, by focusing on the criminal justice system, we lost sight of the profound social, cultural and economic problems which confront Aboriginal people\\". At the time of RCIADIC, there was no ability to compare Aboriginal with non-Aboriginal deaths in custody because the information was not available from state and territory governments. At that time, the greatest number of Aboriginal deaths in custody had occurred in Western Australia and Queensland, half of the victims were under 28 years old, and the most common cause of death was hanging. More detailed analysis was needed, for instance into the different factors operating in police custody compared with correctional facilities. The term \\"death in custody\\" was defined in the RCIADIC report to include people under arrest (in police custody) or during the process of attempted detainment (including under police pursuit); on remand (pre-trial detention), in prison or juvenile detention after sentencing, or attempting to escape from police or prison custody. RCIADIC concluded that the deaths were not caused by deliberate killing by police and prison officers, but that \\"glaring deficiencies existed in the standard of care afforded to many of the deceased\\". It reported that \\"Aboriginal people died in custody at the same rate as non-Aboriginal prisoners, but they were far more likely to be in prison than non-Aboriginal people\\", and that child removal (leading to what has since been dubbed the Stolen Generation) was a \\"significant precursor to these high rates of imprisonment\\". Many other historical and social factors were considered, showing a complex network of reasons as to why Aboriginal people were imprisoned at a higher rate. A 2018 review by Deloitte commissioned in December 2017 by the then Indigenous Affairs Minister, Nigel Scullion, found that only 64% of the recommendations had been fully implemented. It reported that 14% were \\"mostly implemented\\", 16% were \\"partly implemented\\" and 6% not at all. It also found that monitoring of deaths in custody had decreased nationwide, and the quality of data on police custody was \\"an ongoing issue\\". Prison safety had increased, but more staff were needed for mental and other health issues of Aboriginal prisoners. Regular in- cell checks, particularly in police watch houses, were still deficient in some jurisdictions. Disproportionate rates of imprisonment Aboriginal and Torres Strait Islander people made up approximately 3.3% of the Australian population (798,365) in the 2016 Australian census. As of June 2018, the total Aboriginal and Torres Strait Islander population in Australia aged 18 years and over was approximately 2 percent, while Indigenous prisoners accounted for just over a quarter (28%) of the adult prison population. This means that Indigenous adults are 15 times more likely to be imprisoned than non- Indigenous adults. The rate of imprisonment of Indigenous Australians almost doubled during the time between 1991 and 2018. Indigenous youth are 26 times more likely to be placed in detention. According to the Australian Institute of Health and Welfare, in the June quarter of 2019 there was an average of 949 young people in detention per night: 90% of these were male, and 63% not yet sentenced. Aboriginal or Torres Strait Islander youths made up over half (53%) of the number. In the four years preceding June 2019, there were no clear trends shown in any of the statistical measures. PDF The Attorney-General for Australia commissioned the Australian Law Reform Commission (ALRC) in October 2016 to examine the factors leading to the disproportionate numbers of Aboriginal and Torres Strait Islander peoples in Australian prisons, and to look at ways of reforming legislation which might ameliorate this \\"national tragedy\\". The result of this in-depth enquiry was a report titled Pathways to Justice ‚Äì Inquiry into the Incarceration Rate of Aboriginal and Torres Strait Islander Peoples, which was received by the Attorney-General in December 2017 and tabled in Parliament on 28 March 2018. The report listed 13 recommendations, covering many aspects of the legal framework and police and justice procedures, including that fine default should not result in the imprisonment. Summary report PDF Full report PDF Qualified improvement in death rate Overall, the rate of Indigenous deaths in custody has reduced since 1991, lower than the rate of death of non-Indigenous people, which the AIC attributes to improved care by police and corrective services. However the rate of imprisonment of Indigenous people has climbed steeply, which is related to the higher number of deaths when compared with the 10 years examined by the RCIDIAC (99 in 10 years, compared with about 437 in 29 years). Non-Indigenous people have died in custody in greater numbers and at a higher rate than Indigenous people, since 1991; however, with the much higher numbers of imprisonment of Indigenous people, there are more deaths as a proportion of their total population. Issues in WA Attorney-General for Western Australia, John Quigley, said in June 2020 that there was \\"systematic discrimination\\" against Indigenous people in the Western Australian justice system. Statistically, Indigenous people were far more likely to be stopped and questioned by police than non-Indigenous, more likely to be arrested if charged by police and less likely to get bail. Imprisonment of Indigenous people in WA was 4.1 per cent, compared with 2.6 nationally. The number of Indigenous adults going to prison, and young people being held in detention was still increasing, although the rate of imprisonment had slowed. He said that legislative reforms were being planned. WA has a higher number of Aboriginal deaths in custody since 1991 than any other state or territory. On 17 June 2020 reforms to the legislation relating to jail sentences for unpaid fines, long a bone of contention, spurred on by the death of Ms Dhu and finally introduced into Parliament in September 2019, was passed in WA. Between 1 July 2018 and 30 June 2019, 430 people spent time in custody for unpaid fines. Under the new legislation, most fine defaulters will do community service if they fail to pay, with imprisonment a last resort, by order of a magistrate only. The change was recommended by RCIADIC in 1991. Definition The RCIDIAC's Recommendation No. 6 in its final report stipulated that \\"death in custody\\" includes at least the following categories when considering post-death investigations: (Also here ) The Police Association of South Australia proposed a change to the legal definition in June 2020. PASA President Mark Carroll said that police were only involved in \\"very few\\" of these cases, with most of them occurring through natural causes, suicide or violence between prisoners, and that several had occurred when the subjects had tried to flee from police and come to harm, including fatal car crashes. However this idea was opposed by the Aboriginal Legal Rights Movement (ALRM) and the opposition (Labor) Aboriginal Affairs spokesperson Kyam Maher, who said that it was important to keep consistency in the statistics for comparison purposes. Statistics=Sources Statistics on deaths in custody are extracted from different sources; there is no single authoritative list of deaths in custody, of any race. Under Australia's federal system, each state or territory has responsibility for criminal justice in their jurisdiction. Those held in prison custody (including institutions such as remand) are the responsibility of a state or territory department overseeing correctional services; youth detention centres are overseen by a variety of types of departments (such as human/community services or youth justice), and those occurring in police custody during operations are the responsibility of each state or territory's police force, or alternatively the Australian Federal Police. The Australian Institute of Criminology (AIC) uses data from the National Deaths in Custody Program (NDICP), as laid out in Recommendation 41 of the final report of the RCIADIC. (Where other sources for the statistics quoted below vary from the RCIADIC definition given above, or need further clarification, this is noted.) Historical 1980‚Äì1989: The National Report (1991) of the Royal Commission into Aboriginal Deaths in Custody (RCIADIC) included a list of the deaths investigated by the Commission, i.e. those occurring between 1980 and 1989. 1989‚Äì1996: A 1996 report prepared by prepared for the Aboriginal and Torres Strait Islander Commission reported 96 Aboriginal deaths in custody in the seven years following the period examined by the RCIADIC, with a peak of 22 in 1995. A change in the definition of a death in custody in 1989 meant that only deaths in institutional settings (such as on remand, in prisons and youth detention centres), rather than police pursuit, could be examined when comparing the figures between the Royal Commission and post-Royal Commission periods. 1990‚Äì1999: A report comparing the number and circumstances of Indigenous deaths in custody during the 10-year period examined by RCDIAC with those in the following 10 years, found that the average annual rate of deaths has decreased from 4.4 deaths per 100,000 persons to 3.8 deaths per 100,000 people. As a proportion of all deaths in custody, those of Indigenous people had decreased from 21% to 18%. As a proportion of all deaths in custody, deaths in police custody (all races) had decreased, while prison deaths had increased. 2001‚Äì2011: A 2013 Monitoring Report by the AIC found that both Indigenous and non-Indigenous rates of deaths in custody had decreased in the ten years preceding 2011, including eight years in which the Indigenous rate of deaths in prison had been lower than non-Indigenous. Looking at police custody, those in institutional and close contact settings had been decreasing (attributed to better training of police and design improvements in holding cells), while \\"operational deaths\\" (such as pursuits) had shown an overall increase since the early 1990s, but some reduction between 2003 and 2011. 2013‚Äì2015: In the two years between 1 July 2013 and 30 June 2015, there was a total of 115 deaths (of all races) in prison custody, with over 70% of these due to natural causes, and 34 in police custody and related operations. 22% of the prison deaths and 19% of those in police custody were of Indigenous people. 2015‚Äì2017: In a Statistical Report looking at prison deaths between 2015 and 2016, the AIC reported that death rates of Indigenous prisoners \\"[had] been consistently lower than death rates of non-Indigenous prisoners since 2003‚Äì04\\". The death rate in 2015‚Äì2016 was 0.18 and 0.23 per 100 respectively, and in 2016‚Äì2017, 0.14 and 0.18 per 100 respectively. 1979‚Äì2018: The AIC's National Deaths in Custody Program report: Deaths in custody in Australia 2013‚Äì14 and 2014‚Äì15, published in April 2018, reported a total of 2,608 deaths (of all races) in custody since 1979‚Äì80, with 1,600 deaths of those in prison and 985 in police custody. (In addition, 18 deaths had occurred in youth detention facilities and five in other justice facilities, but these were excluded from analysis in this report.) Of those 2,608 deaths, 500 had been Indigenous and 2,104 non-Indigenous people. 1990‚Äì2004: A report spanning 25 years summarised the trends in deaths during this period. Compared with the RDDIAC period (1980‚Äì1989), in which the majority of deaths (61%) occurred in police custody, during this 15-year period most of the deaths occurred in prison custody (63%). Deaths in police custody had decreased, while the number of deaths occurring during police operations increased, but the latter deaths were mostly of non-Indigenous persons. \\"While the number of deaths of non-Indigenous prisoners has consistently exceeded deaths of Indigenous prisoners, the rate of Indigenous prisoner deaths exceeded the rate of non-Indigenous prisoner deaths in just over half of the 15 years since RCIADIC, reflecting the general over- representation of Indigenous persons in the prison population.\\" 1991‚Äì2016: A 2019 AIC Statistical Bulletin, looking at 25 years of data since the Royal Commission (1 July 1991 to 30 June 2016), found that: * With reference to prison custody, \\"Indigenous people are now less likely than non-Indigenous people to die in prison custody\\" including a decrease in the rate of hanging deaths. Death from natural causes was the most prevalent cause, at 58% (140), followed by hanging, at 32% (78); 5% (12) were due to drugs and/or alcohol, and 4% (9) were due to external trauma. from mid-2003 to mid‚Äì2016, deaths due to natural causes surpassed hanging deaths. Deaths in prison custody had decreased overall for both Indigenous and non-Indigenous people. *With reference to police custody, it was not possible to calculate rates of death due to lack of reliable data, but there was no clear trend over the reference period based on raw numbers. The number of deaths in police custody in each year was \\"relatively small\\", with a total of 146 Indigenous deaths over the 25-year period. The largest number occurred in 2002‚Äì03 and 2004‚Äì05 (11 each), and the lowest in 2013‚Äì14 (1). As to the manner of death, 47% (68) of Indigenous deaths in police custody were classified as accidental with 57% (39) of these during motor vehicle pursuits and 19% (13) during another type of pursuit. Natural causes accounted for 21% (31), self-inflicted deaths 19% (28), \\"justifiable homicide\\" 7% (10) and \\"unlawful homicide\\" 5% (8). 56% (82) of Indigenous deaths were classified as deaths in which officers were not in close contact, while the remaining 44% (64) were deaths in which officers were in close contact with the deceased. This proportion was reflected similarly in the stats for non-Indigenous deaths in police custody (333 and 262 respectively). Current totals and analyses 1991‚Äì June 2020: A total of at least Indigenous 437 deaths in custody have been recorded since 1991. 2008‚ÄìJune 2020: The Guardian's Deaths Inside database, tracking all Indigenous deaths in custody between 1 January 2008 and 5 June 2020, was created by Guardian Australia reporters, using all available data available from coronial and other sources. It also includes all deaths that occurred in the presence of police officers, including those caused by self-inflicted injuries. It also includes deaths occurring during a police pursuit or traffic intercept by police. The total number is of deaths recorded is 164, with Western Australia recording the highest number for a state or territory (54). Of the total, 72 deaths were attributed to medical issues; 23 to self-harm and 23 to traffic accidents. Further analysis of the data showed that agencies \\"failed to follow all of their own procedures in 41% of cases where Indigenous people died\\"; and in the cases of 38% of Indigenous deaths, required medical care at some point was not given. In 42% of all deaths in custody (all races), \\"mental health or cognitive impairment was a factor\\", but Indigenous people with a diagnosed mental condition, including brain injury and foetal alcohol syndrome, did not receive the required care in 49% of cases. Another finding was that Indigenous women fared worse than men in terms of receiving all appropriate medical care and the authorities following procedures. Responses In Australia, all deaths in custody trigger an inquest. By August 2018 it was found that there had been a lack of action on recommendations arising from inquests, including the recommendations made as part of the 1987 Royal Commission into Aboriginal Deaths in Custody. Over half of the Indigenous people who died in custody since 2008 had not been found guilty, as 56% were on remand, died while fleeing police or during arrest, or were in protective custody. Most were suspected of non-indictable offences, which typically carry sentences of less than five years. Custody Notification Scheme Custody Notification Schemes (CNS) have been set up in several states and territories. Implementation of a CNS has been shown to bring about a dramatic reduction in the numbers of Aboriginal deaths in custody. In October 2016, the federal government offered funding for the first three years to the remaining states and territories which had not yet legislated a mandatory CNS; by July 2020, only Queensland and Tasmania had not yet introduced such legislation. Publicity and community action Since the killing of George Floyd and the protests that followed in the US in the first week of June 2020, Aboriginal deaths in custody have come into focus again. The last day of National Reconciliation Week was marked by a candlelight vigil in Brisbane's Musgrave Park on 3 June 2020, with 432 candles lit for the each of the Aboriginal deaths in custody since the 1991 end of the Royal Commission into Aboriginal Deaths in Custody, and an extra one for George Floyd. Protests planned in major cities on 6 June 2020 were met with differing responses by government and police in each state, owing to the social distancing and other restrictions imposed during the COVID-19 pandemic in Australia. Closing the Gap The federal government's Closing the Gap strategy since 2008, which aims to reduce disadvantage among Indigenous Australians, had not addressed justice issues during the first 10 years of its existence, and only achieved very limited success in other areas. Draft targets for 2019 created by the Council of Australian Governments (COAG) in December 2018 included one called \\"Justice (including youth justice)\\". This target aims to \\"Reduce the rate of Aboriginal and Torres Strait Islander young people in detention by 11-19% and adults held in incarceration by at least 5% by 2028\\", and the outcome of the target is that \\"Aboriginal and Torres Strait Islander people are not overrepresented in the criminal justice system\\". The new targets and an overhaul of the Closing the Gap framework were now being led by Indigenous people, with the project still under way as of February 2020, when the 12th Closing the Gap report was published. The Minister for Indigenous Australians, the Hon. Ken Wyatt, said in early June 2020 that law reform alone cannot solve the justice problem: \\"We're working to address the factors that contribute to high incarceration rates\\". As one example, Wyatt cited the Western Australian law which includes imprisonment as a punishment for not paying a fine. One of the RCIDIAC recommendations for state governments had been to review the offence of \\"public drunkenness\\" as well as imprisonment for unpaid fines, as these played a large part in the number of Indigenous people in custody. The Victorian and Western Australian governments indicated these laws might soon be overturned, years after two women had died in custody in each state while being held for one of these reasons (Tanya Day and Ms Dhu), and WA effected the change on 17 June 2020. Senator Mick Dodson, one of the Commissioners on the RCIDIAC, said in parliament that for too long there had been \\"nice words\\" and \\"good intentions\\", but there had been a lack of \\"action and commitment\\" to keeping Indigenous people out of prison. Individual cases and findings=Notable incidents *John Pat, a 16-year-old boy killed in Western Australia in 1983. Chapter 5: An Aboriginal death in custody: The case of John Pat *Kingsley Richard Dixon, a 19-year-old who died in Adelaide Gaol in 1987, one of two cases which sparked the Royal Commission. *David Gundy, an Aboriginal man who died aged 29, in Marrickville, Sydney, New South Wales, on 27 April 1989 *Cameron Doomadgee, a 2004 death in custody on Great Palm Island, Queensland. *Ms Dhu, an Aboriginal woman who died in 2014 in South Hedland, Western Australia. *David Dungay, who died aged 26 in Long Bay Hospital at Long Bay Correctional Centre in Sydney in 2015. Dungay had diabetes and schizophrenia, and died after being held down by five guards who had asked him to stop eating biscuits, while being injected with a sedative by a prison nurse. A coronial inquest in November 2019 found that none of the guards should face disciplinary action, saying that their \\"conduct was limited by systemic efficiencies in training\\", but the professional conduct of the nurse should be reviewed by the Nursing Board. *Rebecca Maher, a Wiradjuri woman, found dead in Maitland, New South Wales police cell in July 2016, after being arrested for public intoxication. The coroner found that she would have survived if police had followed procedures. This was the first time an Aboriginal person had died in custody in NSW or the ACT since the Custody Notification Service was implemented. When Maher was taken into protective custody by police for being intoxicated, police were only obliged to call the CNS if an Indigenous person was taken into custody for an offence, not if they were detained as an intoxicated person, so they did not alert the CNS at the Aboriginal Legal Service (NSW/ACT). As a result of the coronial inquest into her death, in October 2019 the NSW government implemented a change to extend the CNS to cover police custody of intoxicated persons. *Wayne Fella Morrison, a 29-year- old Wiradjuri, Kokatha and Wirangu man died in the Royal Adelaide Hospital on 26 September 2016, after being held at Yatala Labour Prison and put in the back of a van, hooded and cuffed and with four prison guards, after an altercation. He was pulled unresponsive from the back of the van and taken to hospital, where he died three days later. The state ombudsman's report in September 2020 said that Robinson was failed by the Department for Correctional Services (DCS), and recommended that it apologise to Robinson's family. He also recommended that the use of body-worn video cameras for prison officers should be mandatory. DCS has adopted 16 of 17 recommendations, with the last one under review, apologised to the family, and formed an agreement with Aboriginal Legal Rights Movement whereby all Aboriginal prisoners admitted to the Adelaide Remand Centre are able to access to the Aboriginal Visitors Scheme. A coroner's inquest is ongoing . *Tane Chatfield, aged 22, who died at Tamworth Correctional Centre in on 22 September 2017. In August 2020 it was found by the coroner that he had committed suicide, but she criticised the inadequate care that he was given by the senior nurse in the hour before his death. * Tanya Day, who fell into a coma in a police cell in Melbourne and later died in hospital in December 2017. In April 2020 a coroner referred the case to prosecutors for further investigation, stating that her death was preventable. On 27 August 2020 Victoria Police announced that they would not be laying charges against any officers, after receiving advice from the Office of Public Prosecutions. Other cases and commentary Suvendrini Perera, a member of the working party that reported to the West Australian Attorney-General on the coronial findings into the death of a Wongai elder who died in the back of a police van in Perth in 2008, wrote of \\"a culture of racism, cronyism and cover-up\\" evident within the Australian criminal justice system, targeting Aboriginal people as well as Sudanese Australians and asylum seekers.

It was last renegotiated during the Uruguay Round of the General Agreement on Tariffs and Trade, with its present form entering into force with the establishment of the WTO at the beginning of 1995, binding on all WTO members.  Purpose The TBT exists to ensure that technical regulations, standards, testing, and certification procedures do not create unnecessary obstacles to trade. The agreement prohibits technical requirements created in order to limit trade, as opposed to technical requirements created for legitimate purposes such as consumer or environmental protection. In fact, its purpose is to avoid unnecessary obstacles to international trade and to give recognition to all WTO members to protect legitimate interests according to own regulatory autonomy, although promoting the use of international standards. The list of legitimate interests that can justify a restriction in trade is not exhaustive and it includes protection of environment, human and animal health and safety.  Structure of the agreement on technical barriers to trade The TBT Agreement can be divided into five parts. The first part defines the scope of the Agreement which includes \\"[a]ll products, including industrial and agricultural\\" but not sanitary and phytosanitary measures. The second part sets out the obligations and principles concerning technical regulations. The third part addresses conformity and assessments of conformity. The fourth part deals with information and assistance, including the obligation of nations to provide assistance to each other in drafting technical regulations. Lastly the fifth part provides for the creation of the Committee on Technical Barriers to Trade and sets out the dispute settlement procedures.  Scope of application According to Art.1, this agreement covers all industrial and agricultural products, with the exception of services, sanitary and phytosanitary measures (as defined by Agreement on the Application of Sanitary and Phytosanitary Measures) and \\"purchasing specifications prepared by governmental bodies for production or consumption requirements of governmental bodies\\" (Art. 1.4). The scope of the TBT consists of substantive scope (what measures are included), personal scope (to whom the measures apply), and temporal scope.  Substantive scope There are three categories of substantive measures found in Annex 1 of the TBT; technical regulations, standard, and conformity assessment. The Appellate Body in EC- Asbestos held these to be a limited class of measures. =Technical regulation: annex 1.1= A technical regulation is a document stipulating conditions that is mandatory. The measures may include terminology, symbols, packaging or labelling requirements, and may apply to a product, process or production method. The Appellate Body in EC-Sardines found there to be a three-step test for determining whether a measure is a technical regulation: :a) The measure applies to an identifiable product or group of products; :b) It lays down one or more characteristics of the product; and :c) Compliance with the product characteristic is mandatory. If a measure is found to be a technical regulation, it will be regulated by Article 2 TBT. =Standard: annex 1.2= A standard is a document approved by a recognized body that stipulates guidelines or characteristics that are not mandatory. It may include terminology, symbols, packaging or labelling requirements, and may apply to a product, process or production method. Standards are distinct from technical regulation in that they are not mandatory. Despite being voluntary, producers often have no choice but to comply with them for commercial practicality.Eric R. Lowe, \\"Technical Regulations to Prevent Deceptive Practices: Can WTO Members Protect Consumers from [un] Fair-Trade Coffee and [Less-Than] Free-Range Chicken?\\" (2014) 48(3) Journal of World Trade, p. 593‚Äì628. Standards are guided by Article 4 TBT and Codes of Good Practice. =Conformity assessment: annex 1.3= A conformity assessment is a direct or indirect procedure used to determine the fulfillment of requirements in a technical regulation or standard. Conformity assessments may include sampling, testing, and inspections. The rules for conformity assessment are outlined in Articles 5, 6, 7, 8 and 9 TBT. Issues of scopeDetermining whether a measure is a technical regulation or a standard= Whether a measure is a technical regulation as opposed to a standard centers on whether it is \\"mandatory.\\" The Panel and Appellate Body in Tuna-Dolphin GATT Case (I and II) held that the US labeling measures for dolphin-safe tuna was a technical regulation. The requirements were not compulsory for the sale of tuna in the US, however the requirements were compulsory for dolphin-safe certification. The Appellate Body stated that because the US provided no other methods of obtaining the dolphin-safe label, the requirement was binding, and therefore mandatory. It appears from this decision that measures that attempt to obtain a monopoly over a specific label will be deemed technical regulations, but the test is ultimately on a case-by-case basis.Laurens J. Ankersmith, Jessica C. Lawrence, \\"The future of environmental labelling: US-Tuna II and the scope of the TBT\\" (2012) 39(1) Legal Issues of Economic Integration, p. 127-147. This decision has been criticised for construing the term \\"mandatory\\" too broadly, rendering the distinction between technical regulations and standards meaningless.Keigan Tyler Mull, \\"Making sense of \\"mandatory\\" measures in the TBT Agreement: why the majority panel's determination in U.S. Tuna II rendered the distinction between technical regulations and standards to be meaningless\\" (2013) 25(2) Georgetown International Environmental Law Review, p. 367-387. =Application to non-product related processes= Labels such as \\"free- range,\\" \\"organic,\\" or \\"fair trade,\\" denote a quality in the product that has no tangible effects. Whether labels regarding non-product related process (\\"NPRP\\") are technical regulations is the subject of controversy. Annex 1.1 states that technical regulations apply to \\"product characteristics or their related process and production methods\\", implying that this does not extend to NPRPs. However the second sentence of Annex 1.1 and 1.2 omits the word \\"related\\", suggesting that technical regulations may apply to labelling. Some academics argue that sentence 2 is read in context of sentence 1, and should therefore be given narrower scope. The Panel in Tuna-Dolphin GATT Case (I and II) did not clarify this issue, but held in that case that the dolphin-safe labeling was a technical regulation by reason of the second sentence. Accordingly, it may be assumed that labeling of NPRP-PPM products now fall under the scope of technical regulations.  Key principles & obligations= Non-discrimination Members must ensure that technical regulations and standards do not accord treatments less favorable to imported products compared to the ones granted to like products of national origin or creating in any other country, as established respectively in Art. 2.1 and Annex 3.D. This principle applies also to conformity assessment procedures, that have to \\"grant access for suppliers of like products originating in the territories of other members under conditions no less favorable than those accorded to suppliers of like products of national origin or originating in any other country in a comparable situation\\" (Art. 5.1 and 5.1.1).  Avoidance of unnecessary barriers to trade Article 2.2 obliges Members not to create unnecessary obstacles to international trade and, on this basis, to ensure that \\"technical restrictions are not more trade restrictive than necessary to fulfil a legitimate objective\\". The Article provides an inclusive list of legitimate objectives including national security requirements and the protection of animal or plant life or health. However Article 2.5 provides that where technical standards are for the purpose of one of the legitimate objectives listed in Article 2.2 and in accordance with relevant international standards they are presumed not to violate Article 2.2. (PDF here.)  Harmonization around international standards When international standards exist, members shall use them as a basis for their technical regulations, standards and conformity assessment procedures, unless their use seems inappropriate or ineffective in certain circumstances (for example, for climatic or technological reasons) for achieving the pursued objective (Art. 2.4, 5.4 and Annex 3.D).  Notification requirements The TBT Agreement also obliges States to notify each other of proposed technical barriers to trade. To give States the opportunity to raise their concerns before the measures come into force, members must allow reasonable time for Members to make comments, discuss their comments and to have their comments considered. Members must notify each other in relation to proposed TBT provisions when the following three conditions are satisfied: * The measure must be a technical regulation or an evaluation of a conformity assessment procedure. * There must either be no relevant international standard or, if there is, the measure must not conform to it. * The technical regulation must have a considerable effect on international trade. These criteria are broader than any of the obligations regarding the content of technical regulations which ensures that any issues which will subsequently be litigated can be identified at the earliest stage possible. However, in the case of \\"urgent problems of safety, health, environmental protection or national security\\" Article 2.10 provides an alternate procedure to expedite the process.  Other informations= Adjudication of disputes Under Article 14.1 disputes regarding the TBT Agreement are to be resolved by the Dispute Settlement Body in accordance with Articles XXII and XXIII of GATT. This requires parties to undergo the same consultation process as they would for issues arising under GATT and allows disputes involving issues arising under both the TBT Agreement and GATT to be resolved simultaneously. In spite of this very few cases concerning the TBT Agreement have been brought to the Panel. The following list is an overview of the mechanisms that promote the TBT's mission: A. All TBT members are required to establish \\"enquiry points\\" also known as \\"TBT Window\\" ‚Äì offices that provide information about the country's technical regulations, test procedures, and adherence to various international standards. B. A technical assistance program helps developing countries meet international standards and helps them get involved in the establishment of such standards.

Stanton World War II Constituted in 1921, the 2nd Cavalry Division was not activated until April 1941. As part of the Protective Mobilization Plan, the division was reserved for activation at Fort Riley, Kansas, but due to manpower constraints it never reached full strength. The 2nd received the appropriate number of cavalry regiments, but units providing the organic support and service troops remained unfilled. The first divisional activations came in October 1940, with the organization of the 3rd Cavalry Brigade and the assignment of the 2nd Cavalry Regiment and 14th Cavalry Regiment. The 4th Cavalry Brigade activated during February 1941 with the 9th Cavalry Regiment and 10th Cavalry Regiment as its cavalry regiments. These last two regiments, the only two available for assignment, were black units. The division, therefore, was unique to Army structure at that time, a racially mixed unit. Split between Fort Riley and Camp Funston, Kansas, neither post having adequate facilities for the division's horse cavalry, personnel shortages continued, and divisional elements were activated using provisional assets. General Millikin, the 2nd Cavalry Division commander in June 1941, envisioned a combined use of mechanized and horse cavalry within the division. During July, Troop A, 2n Reconnaissance Squadron, was formed provisionally as a mechanized divisional element. The division, now organized with horses, scout cars, jeeps and motorcycles, spent most of the rest of the summer training with its new equipment. The 2nd Cavalry Division participated in the Second Army Maneuvers of late August as a component of the Red Forces facing the VII Corps' Blue Army. Given the task of capturing Arkansas and Louisiana, the 2nd's mission ended on 9 September with divisional elements at Chatham, Louisiana. During the next week the division became part of a second training operation. This time the division served with the Second Army's Red Force, now challenging the Third Army's Blue Force. Second Army's first goal was to defeat and remove the Blue Forces from southern Louisiana, and then to keep the enemy from capturing Shreveport. At the close of these maneuvers the 2nd Cavalry Division returned to Kansas, having prevailed with Blue Forces still forty miles from the city. By 2 November the division possessed a number of its organic support troops, although most were still functioning in a provisional status. The end of the month found the division involved in another set of training maneuvers. The operation, \\"PRACTICE BLITZKRIEG,\\" was based in Kansas and finished with the 2nd Cavalry Division's capture of Topeka. The exercise ended when the divisional military police unit seized the governor who feigned a surrender of the state. The surprise attack on Pearl Harbor triggered fears of assaults on the west coast and invasion threats from south of the border. A new emphasis was placed on the continent's western defenses and the division deployed its 3rd Brigade to Arizona. General Coulter, the brigade commander, was also given command of the Southern Land Frontier Sector of the Western Defense Command. Under him the 2nd Cavalry, stationed at Phoenix, and the 14th Cavalry, at Tucson, patrolled the Mexican Border for the next seven months. Meanwhile, the 4th Cavalry Brigade, still at Camp Funston, continuing an endless cycle of training. Constantly called on to provide cadres for new units, the 9th and 10th Cavalry routinely lost veteran personnel and received untrained recruits. During the spring of 1942 a War Department decision to increase the number of armored divisions within the United States Army resulted in the planned conversion of the 2nd Cavalry Division. White troops in the 3d Brigade were used in the formation of the 9th Armored Division. The 2nd and 14th Cavalry were inactivated and their personnel transferred into the newly formed 2nd and 14th Armored Regiments, both elements of the new armored division. On 15 July 1942 the 2nd Cavalry Division was inactivated. The 4th Cavalry Brigade with its Black regiments, however, remained active. The activation of the 9th Armored Division created logistical problems at Fort Riley and Camp Funston. The installations that had accommodated a single division were now home to a division and an additional cavalry brigade. Consequently, the 4th Cavalry Brigade Headquarters and the 10th Cavalry relocated to Camp Lockett, California. The 9th Cavalry, although still assigned to the brigade, moved to Fort Clark, Texas. As the number of Black personnel entering the Army rose, the need for segregated units for these soldiers to join also increased. In November 1942 the War Department directed that the 2nd Cavalry Division would be reactivated, and that two new Black regiments would be assigned. It was also announced that the 2nd, now the Army's third Black division, would remain divided between Texas and California. Construction was started at both posts since neither had the facilities to support an entire division. The work completed, the 2nd Cavalry Division activated on 25 February 1943 with headquarters at Fort Clark. The 9th and 27th Cavalry, active at the Texas post, were the assigned troops of the 5th Cavalry Brigade. The 10th Cavalry and the 28th Cavalry, located at Camp Lockett, made up the 4th Cavalry Brigade. Filled using recruits straight from the induction centers, the 2nd Division spent most of the spring and summer of 1943 training its soldiers. The division provided these men with their basic training as well as instruction in cavalry operations. The divisional training as a whole, however, would not be tested. Stating that there was no intrinsic need for a second cavalry division, the War Department had devised a plan to use the 2nd Cavalry Division personnel to form needed service units. Black community leaders, reacting against the criticism of the performance of Black soldiers in combat units, protested the possible conversion of the division. The debate over the capabilities of Black units continued but the decision concerning the status of the 2nd Cavalry Division was already made. The War Department ordered the division to be shipped overseas where the conversion would take place. During January 1944 the 2nd Cavalry Division was dismounted and shipped back east for deployment abroad. Arriving at Oran, North Africa, on 9 March 1944, elements of the division were gradually inactivated until the 2nd Cavalry Division itself ceased to exist on 10 May 1944. The division was never engaged in combat, and was instead assigned to construct airfields for the Tuskegee Airmen in North Africa and perform garrison and supply duties there. The division also provided replacement troops for the all-Black 92nd Infantry Division which was heavily engaged in combat in Italy.

Bahru Zewde writes, \\"Few people before or after him have demonstrated such superb mastery of the Amharic language. Few have ventured with such ingenuity into the hidden recesses of that language to come out with a wealth of vocabulary and idiom one scarcely thought the language possessed. Af√§warq is nonetheless a controversial figure for having supported the Italians during both the First and Second Italo-Abyssinian Wars.Richard Pankhurst Graziani: The Aftermath in The Secret History of the Italian Fascist Occupation, 1935‚Äì1941, 9. Addis Tribune (Addis Ababa)  Biography  Af√§warq was born in Zeg√© on the southern shore of Lake Tana. He received a traditional education from the church of Ura Kidana Mehrat under the direction of his grandfather Manher Denqe, whom Bahru Zewde describes as \\"a noted scholar.\\" He also practiced painting in the traditional Ethiopian style.Bahru Zewde, Pioneers, p. 52 Af√§warq was also related to the Empress Taytu Betul, and it apparently was through her that he was introduced to Emperor Menelik II's court sometime after 1880. It was there he came to the attention of the Italian diplomat Count Pietro Antonelli, who was impressed with his artistic abilities and enabled him to study in Italy. Af√§warq left for Italy September 1887, was admitted to the International Institute in Milan, where he attended classes in painting at the Albertina Academy of Fine Arts. During his studies in Milan he was called to be the official interpreter for the Ethiopian delegation headed by then Dejazmach Makonnen Wolde Mikael. Af√§warq later claimed that it was he who pointed out the infamous discrepancy between the Amharic and Italian versions of article XVII of the Treaty of Wuchale.Bahru Zewde, Pioneers, pp. 52f He returned to Ethiopia, arriving in Addis Ababa 11 July 1890, at a time when his Italian connections only made the Empress disfavor him. Af√§warq's relationship with Taytu only worsened, so he was relieved when he was asked in September 1894 to escort two men to Neuchatel in Switzerland where they had been enrolled at the International School. By this time Af√§warq had also married the daughter of Alfred Ilg by an Ethiopian wife. It was while in Switzerland that Af√§warq first sided with Italy over his homeland, crossing over to Italy with his two charges and putting all three at the service of the Italian authorities. The Italians quickly sent them to the war front; they arrived at Massawa 6 January 1896, but despite Italian plans and intentions nothing of consequence came of this misadventure, and the three men were at Asmara when the Italians were defeated at Adwa.Bahru Zewde, Pioneers, pp. 53f Af√§warq returned to Italy, and the next 16 years, as Bahru Zewde states, witnessed \\"some of the most important literary and intellectual accomplishments of his career. These included a work on Amharic grammar, an Italian-Amharic conversation manual, the satirical Guide du voyageur, and the novel L…ôbb W√§ll√§d Tarik, published in Rome in 1908, widely considered the first novel in Amharic,Admassu, Yonas. 2003. \\"Af√§warq G√§br√§ Iy√§sus.\\" In Encyclopaedia Aethiopica: A-C: Vol. 1, edited by Siegbert Uhlig, 122‚Äì124.

He also worked with the Italian Ethiopicist Francesco Gallina at this time.Bahru Zewde, Pioneers, p. 54 In 1912, Af√§warq moved to Eritrea where he established an import-export business. On the death of Emperor Menelik, he attempted to ingratiate himself with his successor, Emperor Iyasu V, by writing poems lauding the young man; when Iyasu was deposed in a coup four years later, writes Bahru Zewde, \\"With the amazing dexterity for volte-face that was to be the hallmark of his career and character, Af√§w√§rq composed an equally condemnatory poem on Iyyasu.\\"Bahru Zewde, Pioneers, p. 55 This latter tactic apparently succeeded in reconciling him with the new authorities, for in 1917 or 1918 he was back in Addis Ababa. By 1922 he had become the Nagadras of Dire Dawa in 1922, then between 1925 and 1930 Afaworq served as president of the special court that heard cases involving foreigners and Ethiopians. He was appointed charge d'affairs in Rome for the Ethiopian government, a position which Bahru Zewde notes that, due to \\"his known predilection for the Italians and his record of treason\\" might not have made him the best candidate for this position, but Bahru goes on to quote the American representative in Ethiopia, Addison E. Southard, who observed Haile Selassie wanted \\"to get rid of Afawork locally who has the reputation for being an obstreperous and fire-eating old gentleman with potentialities for stirring ... trouble.\\" Regardless of his deeper allegiances, Afawork found himself in a difficult situation, being forced to rely on the Italian Ministry of Foreign Affairs to send his telegrams home.Bahru Zewde, Pioneers, p. 56 He returned to Ethiopia shortly before the beginning of the Second Italo- Abyssinian War, but upon the Italian forces entering Addis Ababa he acquiesced to their rule, christening 5 May 1936 as the beginning of the \\"Era of Mercy\\" for Ethiopia. Despite his loyalty to the Italian cause, in the backlash that followed the attempt on Graziani's life he was arrested and deported to Italy. He was not allowed to return to Ethiopia until 1938, after which he served usefully enough to be made Afa Qesar (\\"Mouthpiece of the Caesar\\") 9 May 1939. However, upon Haile Selassie's return to Ethiopia, Afaworq was arrested by the restored Ethiopian government, tried for treason, and sentenced to death‚Äîa sentence subsequently commuted to life imprisonment. He was exiled to Jimma where Afaworq, by then blind, died.  Works  * ·àç·â• ·ç° ·ãà·àà·ãµ ·ç° ·â≥·à™·ä≠ ·ç¢ (L…ôbb W√§ll√§d Tarik) [A Heart-Born Story].

The J class was the first class of locomotive in New Zealand to have a tender; all previous classes were tank engines.  Introduction  The first batch built consisted of six locomotives built by the Avonside Engine Company and they entered service in 1874 in Canterbury. Ten more were built in 1879, with a dozen more from Vulcan Foundry in 1883. However, one was lost at sea while being delivered, and a replacement was built the following year.  Service  They spread beyond Canterbury and could also be found working in Auckland, Waikato, and Hawke's Bay. The J class worked well whether it was pulling a long goods train or operating important passenger services in the early days of the Main South Line, but as traffic increased, it was superseded by more powerful locomotives and in 1917-18, four members of the class were converted to 2-6-2 tank engines (the NZR WA class) to perform shunting duties in yards.  Withdrawals  By 1935, all 32 original J class locomotives had reached the end of their usefulness and were discarded, and none survived to be preserved.  Surviving relics  Although none were preserved, relics of J class locomotives can still be seen to this day at sites where NZR dumped withdrawn equipment. A locomotive dump at Oamaru had five J class engines dumped there, Js 15, 82, 83, 116, and 117, although most of these were removed from the seawall by protection works carried out by ONTRACK in 2008‚Äî2009. This dump was also the location of WA 120, which was one of the J's rebuilt as tank engines. Elsewhere, J 61 was dumped without cylinders at Branxholme and other miscellaneous components, large and small were dumped in other dump site locations.

Based in the Parisian suburbs, the group held regular meetings at the home of the Duchamp brothers in Puteaux and at the studio of Albert Gleizes in Courbevoie.Le Salon de la Section d'Or, Octobre 1912, Mediation Centre Pompidou Active from 1911 to around 1914, members of the collective came to prominence in the wake of their controversial showing at the Salon des Ind√©pendants in the spring of 1911. This showing by Albert Gleizes, Jean Metzinger, Robert Delaunay, Henri le Fauconnier, Fernand L√©ger and Marie Laurencin (at the request of Apollinaire), created a scandal that brought Cubism to the attention of the general public for the first time. The Salon de la Section d'Or,Exhibit catalog for Salon de \\"La Section d'Or\\", 1912. Walter Pach papers, Archives of American Art, Smithsonian Institution held October 1912‚Äîthe largest and most important public showing of Cubist works prior to World War I‚Äîexposed Cubism to a wider audience still. After the war, with support given by the dealer L√©once Rosenberg, Cubism returned to the front line of Parisian artistic activity. Various elements of the Groupe de Puteaux would mount two more large-scale Section d'Or exhibitions, in 1920 and in 1925, with the goal of revealing the complete process of transformation and renewal that had transpired since the onset of Cubism. The group seems to have adopted the name \\"Section d'Or\\" as both an homage to the mathematical harmony associated with Georges Seurat, and to distinguish themselves from the narrower style of Cubism developed in parallel by Pablo Picasso and Georges Braque in the Montmartre quarter of Paris. In addition, the name was to highlight that Cubism, rather than being an isolated art-form, represented the continuation of a grand tradition; indeed, the golden ratio, or golden section (), had fascinated Western intellectuals of diverse interests for at least 2,400 years.Jeunes Peintres ne vous frappez pas !, La Section d‚ÄôOr: Num√©ro sp√©cial consacr√© √† l‚ÄôExposition de la \\"Section d‚ÄôOr\\", premi√®re ann√©e, n¬∞ 1, 9 octobre 1912, pp. 1-2.Jeunes Peintres ne vous frappez pas !, La Section d‚ÄôOr: Num√©ro sp√©cial consacr√© √† l‚ÄôExposition de la \\"Section d‚ÄôOr\\", premi√®re ann√©e, n¬∞ 1, 9 octobre 1912, pp. 1-7, Biblioth√®que Kandinsky History The Puteaux Group (an offshoot of la Soci√©t√© Normande de Peinture Moderne) organized their first exhibition under the name Salon de la Section d'Or at the Galerie La Bo√©tie in Paris, October 1912.

Delaunay expanded to include several other artists; Alexander Archipenko, Joseph Csaky, Roger de La Fresnaye, Juan Gris, and Jean Marchand, who were virtually unknown to the public before the Salon des Ind√©pendants of 1911, began to frequent Puteaux and Courbevoie. Franti≈°ek Kupka had lived in Puteaux for several years in the same complex as Jacques Villon.Peter Brooke, Albert Gleizes, Chronology of his life, 1881-1953, English version of a text which first appeared in C. Briend et al: Le Cubisme en majest√©, Albert Gleizes, exhibition catalogue, Mus√©e Picasso, Barcelona; Mus√©e des Beaux-Arts, Lyon, 2001 Francis Picabia was introduced to the circle, perhaps by Guillaume Apollinaire (usually accompanied by Marie Laurencin) with whom he had recently become friendly. Most importantly was the contact established with Metzinger and the Duchamp brothers, who exhibited under the names of Jacques Villon, Marcel Duchamp and Duchamp-Villon. The opening address was given by Apollinaire. The participation of many of these artists in the formation of Les Artistes de Passy in October 1912 was an attempt to transform the Passy district of Paris into yet another art-centre; a further sign of a growing emphasis on communal activity that would culminate in the Section d'Or exhibit.The History and Chronology of Cubism, p. 5 Origins of the term Marcel Duchamp, 1912, Nude Descending a Staircase, No. 2, oil on canvas, , Philadelphia Museum of Art. Exhibited at the Salon de la Section d'Or, 1912, Armory Show, 1913, New York The idea of the Section d'Or originated in the course of conversations between Gleizes, Metzinger and Jacques Villon. The group's title was suggested by Villon, after reading a 1910 translation of Leonardo da Vinci's A Treatise on Painting by Jos√©phin P√©ladan. P√©ladan attached great mystical significance to the golden section (), and other similar geometric configurations. For Villon, this symbolized his belief in order and the significance of mathematical proportions, because it reflected patterns and relationships occurring in nature. Jean Metzinger and the Duchamp brothers were passionately interested in mathematics. Jean Metzinger, Juan Gris and possibly Marcel Duchamp at this time were associates of Maurice Princet,Peter Brooke, private communication an amateur mathematician credited for introducing profound and rational scientific arguments into Cubist discussions. The name 'Section d'Or' represented simultaneously a continuity with past traditions and current trends in related fields, while leaving open future developments in the arts. Art historian Daniel Robbins argued that in addition to referencing the mathematical golden section, the term associated with the Salon Cubists also refers to the name of the earlier Bandeaux d'Or group, with which Albert Gleizes and other former members of the Abbaye de Cr√©teil had been deeply involved.Roger Allard, Sur quelques peintre, Les Marches du Sud-Ouest, June 1911, pp. 57-64. In Mark Antliff and Patricia Leighten, A Cubism Reader, Documents and Criticism, 1906-1914, The University of Chicago Press, 2008, pp. 178-191, 330 Salon de la Section d'Or, 1912 Special issue dedicated to the Exhibition of the Section d'Or, first year, no.1, 9 October 1912 The 1912 Salon de la Section d'Or was arguably the most important pre-World War I Cubist exhibition. In the previous year the Cubists and a large number of their associates had exhibited at the Galerie de l'Art Contemporain (rue Tronchet, Paris) under the auspices of the Soci√©t√© Normande de Peinture Moderne. This exhibition had received some attention in the press (l'Autorit√© and Paris Journal), though due to the diversity of the works presented it had been referred to as an exposition des fauves et cubistes. The Salon de la Section d'Or, however, was generally accepted as being entirely Cubist in nature. Over 200 works were displayed, and the fact that many of the artists showed artworks representative of their development from 1909 to 1912 gave the exhibition the allure of a Cubist retrospective. Albert Gleizes, 1912, Harvest Threshing (Le D√©piquage des Moissons), oil on canvas, 269 x 353 cm, National Museum of Western Art, Tokyo Though the Salle 41 Cubists had been surprised by the highly impassioned reactions generated by the 1911 Salon des Ind√©pendants showing, they appear to have been eager to attract as much attention as possible with the Salon de la Section d'Or. The inauguration was held from nine until midnight, for which the only precedent was the opening of the 1903 Salon d'Automne. Invitations were widely diffused prior to the show, and many of the guests had to be turned away on opening night (9 October 1912). Lectures by Apollinaire, Hourcade and Raynal were advertised, and a review, La Section d'Or, was published to coincide with the Vernissage; with contributions by Guillaume Apollinaire, Roger Allard, Ren√© Blum, Olivier Hourcade, Max Jacob, Maurice Raynal, Pierre Reverdy, Andr√© Salmon, Andr√© Warnod and others.La Section d'Or, Num√©ro sp√©cial, 9 Octobre 1912 The fact that the 1912 exhibition had been curated to show the successive stages through which Cubism had transited, and that Du \\"Cubisme\\" had been published for the occasion, indicates the artists' intention of making their work comprehensible to a wide audience (art critics, art collectors, art dealers and the general public). Undoubtedly, due to the great success of the exhibition, Cubism became recognized as a tendency, genre or style in art with a specific common philosophy or goal: a new avant-garde movement.

Despite a general interest in mathematical harmony, whether the paintings featured in the celebrated Salon de la Section d'Or exhibition used the golden ratio itself in their compositions is difficult to determine.William A. Camfield, Juan Gris and the Golden Section, Art Bulletin, 47, no. 1, March 1965, 128-34. 68 Analysis by Christopher Green suggests that Juan Gris made use of the golden ratio in composing works that were likely shown at the exhibition.Christopher Green, Juan Gris, Whitechapel Art Gallery, London, 18 September - 29 November 1992 ; Staatsgalerie Stuttgart 18 December 1992-14 February 1993 ; Rijksmuseum Kr√∂ller-M√ºller, Otterlo, 6 March - 2 May 1993, Yale University Press, 1992, pp. 37-38, David Cottington, Cubism and Its Histories, Barber Institute's critical perspectives in art history series, Critical Perspectives in Art History, Manchester University Press, 2004, pp. 112, 142, Art historian David Cottington writes: > It will be remembered that Du \\"Cubisme\\", written probably as these paintings > were being made, gestured somewhat obscurely to non-Euclidean concepts, and > Riemann's theorems; as Linda Henderson has shown, these references betray > not an informed understanding of modern mathematics but a shaky hold on some > of their principles, culled (indeed plagiarised) from Henri Poincar√©'s La > Science et l'Hypoth√®se. The authors themselves had little clear idea of how > such mathematics related to their art, except as a vague synecdoche for > \\"modern science\\". Camfield writes that the use of the golden section at La Section d'Or is rather tentative: > A few of these paintings were moreover based on simple geometrical > compositions. Yet, not a single artist there displayed a serious commitment > to geometrical proportions with the one exception of Juan Gris. [...] > Although all of the Puteaux artists were interested in mathematics (Marcel > Duchamp, interview with the author, April 4, 1961), neither Marcel Duchamp > nor Jacques Villon, who suggested the title for \\"La Section d'Or\\"Dora > Vallier, Jacques Villon, Paris, 1957, pp. 60-62 believes that the golden > section was actually used in their paintings. And in Du \\"Cubisme\\" Gleizes > and Metzinger chastise those painters who would rely on mathematics for > certitude. Camfield says that neither of the paintings he analyses \\"can be definitively identified with \\"La Section d'Or\\" paintings\\", only that the \\"stylistic evidence\\" places them in that period and they \\"would almost certainly have been shown\\" there. From the titles, dates and previous exhibitions listed in the 1912 Salon de la Section d'Or catalogue, many painting have since been identified, for example, Les Baigneuses (The Bathers) and Le go√ªter (Tea Time), La Femme au Cheval (Woman with a horse), and many more works by Gleizes, Metzinger and others. The main exception is for the works of Juan Gris, since no titles are given for his submissions in the catalogue. However, it is now known, from published correspondence between the artist and the dealer L√©once Rosenberg that 13 paintings by Gris were shown, most of which have been identified by their titles, dates, and dimensions. Albert Gleizes exhibited Les Baigneuses (The Bathers) at the 1912 Salon de la Section d'Or (catalogue no. 40). The proportions of the canvas correspond exactly to the golden rectangle (a ratio of 1 to 1.618 ¬± 0.01). This work has a rare dimension of 105 x 171 cm. Gleizes, as most artists at the time, generally used standard format chassis (stretchers), which are not golden rectangles.List of standard format stretchers in France, French Wikipedia In Du \\"Cubisme\\" it was argued that Cubism itself was not based on any geometrical theory, but that non-Euclidean geometry corresponded better than classical, or Euclidean geometry, to what the Cubists were doing: \\"If we wished to relate the space of the [Cubist] painters to geometry, we should have to refer it to the non-Euclidean mathematicians; we should have to study, at some length, certain of Riemann's theorems.\\" The 1912 compositions of Juan gris, according to art historian Christopher Green, were often \\"modular and regular... easily fitted to the demands of Golden Section composing in the pictures of the summer, such as Man in a Caf√© and The Watch.\\" The \\"synthetic and analytic were visibly fused. In the Golden Section paintings... he laid the grids like systems of fault-lines across things, faut-lines on either side of which view- points switch.

Works by Robert Delaunay and Andr√© Lhote are seen to the left and right respectively, amidst works by others The Section d'Or group founded by some of the most prominent Cubists was in effect an homage to Georges Seurat. Within the works by Seurat‚Äîof caf√©s, cabarets and concerts, of which the avant-garde were fond‚Äîthe Cubists' rediscovered an underlying mathematical harmony: one that could easily be transformed into mobile, dynamical configurations.Robert Herbert, Neo-Impressionism, New York: The Solomon R. Guggenheim Foundation, 1968 Whereas C√©zanne had been influential to the development of Cubism between 1908 and 1911, during its most expressionistic phase, the work of Seurat would attract attention from the Cubists and Futurists between 1911 and 1914, when flatter geometric structures were being produced. What the Cubists found attractive, according to Apollinaire, was the manner in which Seurat asserted an absolute \\"scientific clarity of conception.\\" The Cubists observed in his mathematical harmonies, geometric structuring of motion and form, the primacy of idea over nature (something the Symbolists had recognized). In their eyes, Seurat had \\"taken a fundamental step toward Cubism by restoring intellect and order to art, after Impressionism had denied them\\" (Robert Herbert, 1968). The golden section does not govern Georges Seurat's Parade de Cirque (Circus Sideshow) geometric structure. Modern consensus is that Seurat never used the 'divine proportion'. Parade is divided horizontally into fourths and vertically into sixths. The 4 : 6 ratio corresponds to the dimensions of the canvas (one-half times wider than its vertical dimension). The ratio of Seurat's painting/stretcher corresponded to a ratio of 1 to 1.502, ¬± 0.002 (as opposed to the golden ratio of 1 to 1.618). The compositional axes in the painting correspond to basic mathematical divisions (simple ratios that appear to approximate the golden section).Robert L.

With the Salons dominated by a return to classicism, Albert Gleizes attempted to resuscitate the spirit of the Section d'Or in 1920 but was met with great difficulty, despite support by Fernand L√©ger, Alexander Archipenko, Georges Braque, Constantin Br√¢ncu»ôi, Henri Laurens, Jacques Villon, Raymond Duchamp-Villon, Louis Marcoussis and L√©opold Survage.Daniel Robbins, 1964, Albert Gleizes 1881 - 1953, A Retrospective Exhibition, Published by The Solomon R. Guggenheim Foundation, New York, in collaboration with Mus√©e National d'Art Moderne, Paris, Museum am Ostwall, Dortmund.Section d‚ÄôOr (Golden Section), 1920 Gleizes' organizational efforts were directed towards the re-establishment of a European-wide movement of Cubist and abstract art in the form of a large traveling exhibition; the Exposition de la Section d‚ÄôOr. The idea was to bring together a collection of works that revealed the complete process of transformation and renewal that had taken place.Albert Gleizes, The Epic, From immobile form to mobile form, in Peter Brooke, Texts by Gleizes It was not the success he had hoped for. Cubism was seen as pass√© for emerging artists and other established artists such as Marcel Duchamp and Picabia, although Gleizes, on the contrary, felt that only its preliminary phase had been investigated.Daniel Robbins, Museum of Modern Art, New York, MoMA, Albert Gleizes, Grove Art Online, 2009 Oxford University Press In addition to Cubists works (which already represented a wide variety of styles), the second edition of the Section d'Or held at the Galerie La Bo√©tie from 5 March 1920 included De Stijl, Bauhaus, Constructivism and Futurism.La Section d'Or, Kubisme.info It was the revival of the Section d'Or which ensured that Cubism in general would become Dada's preferred target.Christopher Green, 1987, Cubism and its Enemies: Modern Movements and Reaction in French Art, 1916-1928.

Owned and developed by SM Prime Holdings, the largest mall chain owner and developer in the Philippines, it has a land area of , a gross floor area of approximately , and offers for conventions and social functions. The area attracts a daily average foot traffic of about 200,000 people. It is currently the fourth largest shopping mall in the Philippines and the fourteenth in the world. When it opened in 2006 it was the largest shopping mall in the Philippines until SM City North EDSA was redeveloped in 2008, and was relegated to third place by the expansion of SM Megamall from 2011 to 2015 when SM Seaside City Cebu opened to the public before returning to this spot in 2017. Following the mall's opening in 2006, it caused several smaller shopping malls nearby to close, such as Pearl Plaza and Uniwide Coastal Mall both in Paranaque. Construction SM Mall of Asia during its earlier years, October 2007 The mall is the centerpiece project of SM Prime at the SM Central Business Park, where five one-story buildings serve as the company's corporate offices (the sixth building being occupied by TeleTech Holdings, Inc. as their flagship site in the country). The SM Mall of Asia's design team includes Arquitectonica, design architect; Architect Robert Carag Ong, Architect of Record, GHT Services, project manager, and Hilmarc's Construction Corp. (for the South Parking Building, Main Mall, and Entertainment Mall), and Monolith Construction Development Corp. (for the North Parking Building), general contractors. The mall would have opened before Christmas Day of 2005 but had been delayed due to hitches in the delivery of construction materials. Frequent rains in the last quarter of 2005 also delayed the turnover of mall space to tenants. SM Prime decided to move the opening date to March 3, 2006. On February 27, 2006, local newspaper Manila Standard Today, reported that a team of Pasay City engineers found huge cracks underneath the structure, which was causing the structure to vibrate. When questioned about the inspection, the Pasay City Engineering Department denied making any statement regarding defects in the Mall of Asia. Engineer Edwin Javaluyas, Pasay City engineering officer, in his letter to SM Prime Holdings Inc., said he never stated that the city hall's engineering department inspected the Mall of Asia on February 23, 2006. SM Prime, however, decided to move the opening to May 21 of that year. Jeffrey Lim, corporate information officer of SM Prime Holdings, emphasized that a rescheduling of the mall's opening was made to give the company an opportunity to allow more tenants to open shops and denied that the change was due to structural defects.\\" The mall was officially inaugurated by President Gloria Macapagal-Arroyo with a special screening of Everest in the San Miguel Coca-Cola IMAX Theater. The movie was shown three days after Philippine tri-athlete Leo Oracion reached the treacherous mountain's summit. Layout The Mall of Asia consists of four buildings interconnected by walkways; the Main Mall, the Entertainment Mall, and the North and South Parking Buildings.

The South Parking Building houses the mall's official The SM Store, while the mall's supermarket, the SM Hypermarket is located at the North Parking Building. These parking buildings are equipped with elevators and escalators (since 2016) which allows fast access to parking levels.

The cult of Serapis was pushed forward during the third century BC on the orders of Greek Pharaoh Ptolemy I Soter of the Ptolemaic Kingdom\\"Sarapis\\" in The New Encyclop√¶dia Britannica. Chicago: Encyclop√¶dia Britannica, Inc., 15th edn., 1992, Vol. 10, p. 447. in Egypt as a means to unify the Greeks and Egyptians in his realm. A serapeum ( serapeion) was any temple or religious precinct devoted to Serapis. The cultus of Serapis was spread as a matter of deliberate policy by the Ptolemaic kings, who also built the immense Serapeum of Alexandria. Serapis continued to increase in popularity during the Roman Empire, often replacing Osiris as the consort of Isis in temples outside Egypt. Serapis was depicted as Greek in appearance but with Egyptian trappings, and combined iconography from a great many cults, signifying both abundance and resurrection. Though Ptolemy I may have created the official cult of Serapis and endorsed him as a patron of the Ptolemaic dynasty and Alexandria, Serapis was a syncretistic deity derived from the worship of the Egyptian Osiris and ApisYoutie, H. 1948. ‚ÄúThe Kline of Serapis‚Äù. The Harvard Theological Review, vol 41, pp. 9‚Äì29. and also gained attributes from other deities, such as chthonic powers linked to the Greek Hades and Demeter, and benevolence linked to Dionysus. There is evidence that the cult of Serapis existed before the Ptolemies came to power in Alexandria: a temple of Serapis in Egypt is mentioned in 323 BC by both Plutarch (Life of Alexander, 76) and Arrian (Anabasis, VII, 26, 2). The common assertion that Ptolemy \\"created\\" the deity is derived from sources which describe him erecting a statue of Serapis in Alexandria: this statue enriched the texture of the Serapis conception by portraying him in both Egyptian and Greek style. In 389, a Christian mob led by Pope Theophilus of Alexandria destroyed the Serapeum of Alexandria, but the cult survived until all forms of pagan religion were suppressed under Theodosius I in 391. Name and origins This pendant bearing Serapis's likeness would have been worn by a member of elite Egyptian society. Walters Art Museum, Baltimore. The name of the deity is derived from the syncretic worship of Osiris and the bull Apis as a single deity under the Egyptian name wsjr-·∏•p. This name was later written in Coptic as Userhapi. \\"Sarapis\\" was the most common form in Ancient Greek until Roman times, when \\"Serapis\\" became common.Consulting the unabridged Lewis and Short Latin lexicon shows that \\"Serapis\\" was the most common Latin version of the name in antiquity: On the Internet Archive.E.g.

The most renowned serapeum was in Alexandria.\\"Of the Egyptian sanctuaries of Serapis the most famous is at Alexandria\\", Pausanias noted (Description of Greece, 1.18.4, 2nd century AD), in describing the Serapeion at Athens erected by Ptolemy on the steep slope of the Acropolis: \\"As you descend from here to the lower part of the city, is a sanctuary of Serapis, whose worship the Athenians introduced from Ptolemy.\\" Under Ptolemy I Soter, efforts were made to integrate Egyptian religion with that of their Hellenic rulers. Ptolemy's policy was to find a deity that should win the reverence alike of both groups, despite the curses of the Egyptian priests against the gods of the other previous foreign rulers (e.g. Set, who was lauded by the Hyksos). Alexander the Great had attempted to use Amun for this purpose, but he was more prominent in Upper Egypt, and not as popular in Lower Egypt, where the Greeks had stronger influence. The Greeks had little respect for animal-headed figures, and so a Greek-style anthropomorphic statue was chosen as the idol, and proclaimed as the equivalent of the highly popular Apis.According to Sir J.G. Frazer's note to the Biblioteca of Pseudo-Apollodorus, 2.1.1: \\"Apollodorus identifies the Argive Apis with the Egyptian bull Apis, who was in turn identified with Serapis (Sarapis)\\"; Pausanias also conflates Serapis and Egyptian Apis: \\"Of the Egyptian sanctuaries of Serapis the most famous is at Alexandria, the oldest at Memphis. Into this neither stranger nor priest may enter, until they bury Apis\\" (Pausanias,Description of Greece, 1.18.4). It was named Userhapi (i.e. \\"Osiris-Apis\\"), which became Greek Sarapis, and was said to be Osiris in full, rather than just his ka (life force). History Bronze votive tablet inscribed to Serapis (2nd century) The earliest mention of a Sarapis occurs in the disputed death scene of Alexander (323 BC).Reported from Arrian, Anabasis, VII. 26. Here, Sarapis has a temple at Babylon, and is of such importance that he alone is named as being consulted on behalf of the dying king. The presence of Sarapis in Babylon would radically alter perceptions of the mythologies of this era: the unconnected Babylonian god Ea (Enki) was titled ≈†ar Apsi, meaning \\"king of the Apsu\\" or \\"the watery deep\\", and perhaps he is the one meant in the diaries. His significance in the Hellenic psyche, due to its involvement in Alexander's death, may have also contributed to the choice of Osiris-Apis as the chief Ptolemaic god. According to Plutarch, Ptolemy stole the cult statue from Sinope in Asia Minor, having been instructed in a dream by the \\"unknown god\\" to bring the statue to Alexandria, where the statue was pronounced to be Sarapis by two religious experts. One of the experts was of the Eumolpidae, the ancient family from whose members the hierophant of the Eleusinian Mysteries had been chosen since before history, and the other was the scholarly Egyptian priest Manetho, which gave weight to the judgement both for the Egyptians and the Greeks. Plutarch may not be correct, however, as some Egyptologists allege that the \\"Sinope\\" in the tale is really the hill of Sinopeion, a name given to the site of the already existing Serapeum at Memphis. Also, according to Tacitus, Serapis (i.e., Apis explicitly identified as Osiris in full) had been the god of the village of Rhakotis before it expanded into the great capital of Alexandria. High Clerk in the Cult of Serapis, Altes Museum, Berlin The statue suitably depicted a figure resembling Hades or Pluto, both being kings of the Greek underworld, and was shown enthroned with the modius, a basket/grain-measure, on his head, since it was a Greek symbol for the land of the dead. He also held a sceptre in his hand indicating his rulership, with Cerberus, gatekeeper of the underworld, resting at his feet. The statue also had what appeared to be a serpent at its base, fitting the Egyptian symbol of rulership, the uraeus. With his (i.e. Osiris's) wife Isis, and their son Horus (in the form of Harpocrates), Serapis won an important place in the Greek world. In his 2nd-century AD Description of Greece, Pausanias notes two Serapeia on the slopes of Acrocorinth, above the rebuilt Roman city of Corinth and one at Copae in Boeotia.Pausanias 2.4.5 and 9.24.1. Serapis figured among the international deities whose cult was received and disseminated throughout the Roman Empire, with Anubis sometimes identified with Cerberus. At Rome, Serapis was worshiped in the Iseum Campense, the sanctuary of Isis built during the Second Triumvirate in the Campus Martius. The Roman cults of Isis and Serapis gained in popularity late in the 1st century when Vespasian experienced events he attributed to their miraculous agency while he was in Alexandria, where he stayed before returning to Rome as emperor in 70. From the Flavian Dynasty on, Serapis was one of the deities who might appear on imperial coinage with the reigning emperor. The main cult at Alexandria survived until the late 4th century, when a Christian mob destroyed the Serapeum of Alexandria in 385. The Theodosian decree of 380 implicitly included the cult in its general proscription of religions other than approved forms of Nicene Christianity.

Its original members were Mikel Erentxun (former singer in \\"Aristogatos\\"), Diego Vasallo and Juan Ram√≥n Viles (former members of \\"Los Dalton\\"). Nowadays, it mainly consists of Mikel and Diego. The group's style was based on an acoustic and simple pop-rock with a touch of rockabilly in great contrast with the more radical rock played in the area at the time. After being signed by Grabaciones Accidentales, S.A. they contributed with two songs (Mi Amor and B√©same Mucho) to the new bands compilation La √∫nica alternativa (The Only Alternative). In 1985 the group recorded its first album, Por Tierras Escocesas (Around Scottish Lands), and Canciones (Songs) a year later, both produced by Paco Trinidad. The songs were immediately successful and gave the group big popularity. After even more successful El Grito del Tiempo (Cry for our Times, 1987) and Grabaciones Olvidadas (Forgotten Recordings, a compilation of B-Sides, 1989) it became a duo and recorded the double album Autobiograf√≠a (Autobiography), with collaborations by Black and Sam Brown among others. The album was nominated for a Grammy Award for Best Latin Performance in 1991. The group later also had several hits such as Esos Ojos Negros (\\"Those Black Eyes\\").

COMLEX-USA is the most common pathway by which osteopathic physicians (D.O.s) apply for medical licensure, and is accepted in all 50 states. The 3-digit standard scores of COMLEX-USA Level 1, Level 2- Cognitive Evaluation (CE), and Level 3 have a range of 9-999 and a mean of 500. Most candidates score between 250 and 800. 400 is the minimum passing score for COMLEX-USA Levels 1 and 2; 350 for COMLEX-USA Level 3.  COMLEX-USA Level 1  COMLEX- USA Level 1 is typically taken after completion of the second year of medical school. The exam consists of 400 questions administered in one day and consists of two, four-hour exam sessions separated by a 40-minute break. Each of the four-hour sessions allows a ten-minute break which is no longer subtracted from the time allotted for the respective four-hour sessions since the 2017 NBOME policy change. Candidates are expected to know the basic mechanisms of health and disease process. The mean score for the COMLEX-USA Level 1 is approximately 500-540 (for first time test-takers), with a standard deviation of about 85 (although this may vary slightly from year to year). Specifically, level one covers basic medical sciences, including: *Anatomy *Behavioral Science *Biochemistry *Microbiology *Osteopathic Principles and Practice *Pathology *Pharmacology *Physiology *Public Health  COMLEX-USA Level 2  COMLEX-USA Level 2, taken during the third or fourth year of medical school, consists of two parts: Level 2-Cognitive Evaluation (CE) and Level 2-Performance Evaluation (PE). Level 2-CE requires candidates to demonstrate knowledge of clinical concepts and medical decision-making. The mean score for the COMLEX-USA Level 2 CE is approximately 540 (for first time test-takers), with a standard deviation of about 100 (although this may vary slightly from year to year). The examination is problem-based and symptoms- based, integrating the clinical disciplines of: *emergency medicine *family medicine *internal medicine *obstetrics/gynecology *osteopathic principles *pediatrics *psychiatry *surgery Level 2-PE was introduced in 2005. It is a one-day, seven-hour clinical skills examination and utilizes standardized patients (actors trained to present clinical symptoms) to test clinical skills. The exam is graded either pass or fail unlike the other COMLEX exams. Testing sites are available in Conshohocken, PA, and in Chicago, IL. Candidates must complete 12 standardized patient encounters, each 14 minutes in duration. Following each encounter, candidates have 9 minutes in order to type a SOAP note. Candidates are strongly encouraged to make full use of the allotted time for each encounter to ensure thoroughness in both components of an encounter. Scoring for the COMLEX-USA Level 2 PE is on a pass/fail basis only. Candidates must demonstrate proficiency in: *history taking and physical examination skills *integrated differential diagnosis and clinical problem solving *written communication and synthesis of clinical findings (SOAP note format) *osteopathic principles and/or osteopathic manipulative treatment  COMLEX-USA Level 3  The final examination, COMLEX-USA Level 3, is typically taken after starting a residency program and covers the clinical disciplines of medicine, including: *emergency medicine *family medicine *internal medicine *obstetrics/gynecology *osteopathic principles *pediatrics *psychiatry *surgery Beginning in September 2018, this exam will be a two-day computer-based examination consisting of up to 550 multiple choice questions, and up to 30 additional clinical decision-making cases. The mean score for COMLEX-USA Level 3 is approximately 550 (for first-time test takers), with a standard deviation of about 125. USMLE comparison Many osteopathic medical students apply to ACGME-accredited residencies with COMLEX scores alone. Based on data from recent results of the COMLEX-USA examination, for level 1 and level 2, a score of 500-540 is considered the 50th percentile with scores falling slightly under and over this mark to be considered similarly. A score of 600 is historically considered to be around the 80th percentile.

It is a harmless (benign) hyperplasia of melanocytes which is linear in its spread. This means the hyperplasia of melanocytes is restricted to the cell layer directly above the basement membrane of the epidermis where melanocytes normally reside. This is in contrast to the \\"nests\\" of multi-layer melanocytes found in moles (melanocytic nevi). Because of this characteristic feature, the adjective \\"lentiginous\\" is used to describe other skin lesions that similarly proliferate linearly within the basal cell layer.Random House Webster's Unabridged Dictionary.

Freckles have a relatively normal number of melanocytes but an increased amount of melanin. A lentigo has an increased number of melanocytes. Freckles will increase in number and darkness with sunlight exposure, whereas lentigines will stay stable in their color regardless of sunlight exposure. Treatment Lentigines by themselves are benign, however one might desire the removal or treatment of some of them for cosmetic purposes. In this case they can be removed surgically, or lightened with the use of topical depigmentation agents. Some common depigmentation agents such as azelaic acid and kojic acid seem to be inefficient in this case, however other agents might work well (4% hydroquinone, 5% topical cysteamine, 10% topical ascorbic acid).

Chlorothalonil-containing products are sold under the names Bravo, Echo, and Daconil. It was first registered for use in the US in 1966. In 1997, the most recent year for which data are available, it was the third most used fungicide in the US, behind only sulfur and copper, with used in agriculture that year.PESTICIDE USE IN U.S. CROP PRODUCTION: 1997 National Center for Food and Agricultural Policy, 1997. Including nonagricultural uses, the United States Environmental Protection Agency (EPA) estimates, on average, almost were used annually from 1990 to 1996.Reregistration Eligibility Decision for chlorothalonil, US EPA, 1999. Uses Chlorothalonil use in the US in pounds per square mile in 2002 (USGS data) In the US, chlorothalonil is used predominantly on peanuts (about 34% of usage), potatoes (about 12%), and tomatoes (about 7%), although the EPA recognizes its use on many other crops. It is also used on golf courses and lawns (about 10%) and as a preservative additive in some paints (about 13%), resins, emulsions, and coatings. Chlorothalonil is commercially available in many different formulations and delivery methods. It is applied as a dust, dry or water-soluble grains, a wettable powder, a liquid spray, a fog, and a dip. It may be applied by hand, by ground sprayer, or by aircraft. Mechanism of action Chlorothalonil reduces and thereby deactivates glutathione. Its mechanism of action is similar to that of trichloromethyl sulfenyl fungicides such as captan and folpet. Toxicity=Acute According to the EPS, chlorothalonil is a toxicity category I eye irritant, producing severe eye irritation. It is in toxicity category II, \\"moderately toxic\\", if inhaled (inhaled 0.094 mg/l in rats.) For skin contact and ingestion, chlorothalonil is rated toxicity category IV, \\"practically nontoxic\\", meaning the oral and dermal is greater than 10,000 mg/kg. Chronic Long-term exposure to chlorothalonil resulted in kidney damage and tumors in animal tests. Carcinogenic Chlorothalonil is a Group 2B \\"possible human carcinogen\\" (N.B. : in the Group 2A of International Agency for Research on Cancer IARC are the \\"probable human carcinogen\\" substances), based on observations of cancers and tumors of the kidneys and forestomachs in laboratory animals fed diets containing chlorothalonil.

Rohr \\"The Fungicide Chlorothalonil is Nonlinearly Associated with Corticosterone Levels, Immunity, and Mortality in Amphibians\\" Environ Health Perspectives, 2011, Online: 4 April. Contaminants Common chlorothalonil synthesis procedures frequently result in contamination of it with small amounts of hexachlorobenzene (HCB), which is toxic. US regulations limit HCB in commercial production to 0.05% of chlorothalonil. According to the EPA report, \\"post-application exposure to HCB from chlorothalonil is not expected to be a concern based on the low level of HCB in chlorothalonil. 2,3,7,8-Tetrachlorodibenzodioxin being one of the most potent carcinogens known is also a known contaminant\\".

Pesticide Action Network North America, Oct 2007. and Prince Edward Island, as well as in groundwater in Long Island, New York and Florida. In the first three cases, the contamination is presumed to have come from potato farms. It has also been detected in several fish kills in Prince Edward Island. The main breakdown product of chlorothalonil is hydroxy-2,5,6-trichloro-1,3-dicyanobenzene (SDS-3701). It has been shown to be 30 times more acutely toxic than chlorothalonil and more persistent in the environment. Laboratory experiments have shown it can thin the eggshells of birds, but no evidence supports this happening in the environment. In 2019, a review of the evidence found that \\"a high risk to amphibians and fish was identified for all representative uses\\", and that chlorothalonil breakdown products may cause DNA damage. Around the same time, research indicated chlorothalonil and other fungicides to be the strongest factor in bumblebee population decline.

Hordern was a member of the Hordern family, well known as retailers in Sydney. Career Hordern was born in North Sydney, New South Wales and made his debut in first-class cricket by taking 8 for 81 for New South Wales‚Äîand 11 wickets in the match‚Äîagainst Queensland in December 1905. He then moved to the United States to pursue his studies. While a student of dentistry at the University of Pennsylvania, he toured England in 1908 and Jamaica in 1908-09 with the Philadelphian cricket team. He played 17 first class matches for Philadelphians, and it was during his time in America that he perfected his googly. Hordern returned to Australia in 1910. Owing to the foresight of Warren Bardsley, he found his way back into the state side immediately. After picking up 43 wickets in six matches in the 1910-11 season, he convinced the Australian selectors to follow Bardsley's lead. Chosen for the Fourth Test of the 1910/11 series against South Africa, he took fourteen wickets at an average of 21.07 in his two Tests in this series, including 5 in the second innings on debut, and 32 wickets at 24.37 against England in the following season. In the England series, he had match figures of 12 for 135 in the first Test at Sydney, assisting Australia to their only win of the series. In the final game, also at Sydney, he took 10 for 161. By this time, he was being called the best bowler of his type in the world. Hordern's priority in life was his medical career. This, along with the controversy surrounding the selection of the team to tour England in 1912, restricted his career. He participated in only 35 first-class matches between 1905 and 1913. He died at age 55 in Darlinghurst, New South Wales. Publications *Googlies: Coals from a Test-Cricketer's Fireplace (Angus & Robertson: Sydney, 1932).

Bahru Zewde observes that his career \\"stands out as the great success story ... of the early twentieth-century intellectuals,\\" then continues, \\"His prolific literary record, his influence with Tafari-Hayla-Sellase and his ascent in the bureaucratic hierarchy were all characterized by an unchequered progression.Bahru Zewde, Pioneers of Change in Ethiopia (Oxford: James Currey, 2002), p. 70 Edward Ullendorff concurs in this evaluation, describing his oeuvre as \\"a considerable and distinguished literary output.\\"Ullendorff, The Ethiopians: An Introduction to the Country and People, second edition (London: Oxford University Press, 1960), p. 156 John Spencer, who met Heruy in early 1936, described him as \\"a short, rotund, white-haired man ... with a goatee and a caf√© au lait complexion. His corpulent build and backward-leaning stance suggested a Santa Claus, except for his black cape and the absence of a sparkle in his eyes. He was remarkably ponderous and deliberate (qunin), in his movements, perhaps reflecting the importance which he assigned to his position as foreign minister and to the reputation which he had earned among Ethiopians for his writings on Ethiopian history.\\"John Spencer, Ethiopia at Bay: A personal account of the Haile Selassie years (Algonac: Reference Publications, 1984), p. 14  Career  Heruy Wolde Selassie in Imperial Japan (1931) Born Gebre Masqal in the region of Merhabete, Heruy received his initial education in the traditional manner at local churches until his father died when he was 13. He found a living working as deacon to a big landlord in return for food and clothing until he achieved an appointment as clerk to Dejazmach Bashah Abboye, the governor of Selale. Continuing in other clerical positions, he eventually came to the notice of the priests of Saint Raguel on Mount Entoto, who rekindled his desire for learning.Bahru Zewde, Pioneers, p. 71 He joined the school attached to that church, where he was taught by the Ethiopian Orthodox priest Mamher Walda Giyorgis. According to Bahru Zewde, it was Walda Giyorgis who gave him his name \\"Heruy\\" (Amharic \\"precious\\"). Not satisfied with a traditional education, Heruy cast his eyes further afield and learned English at the Swedish mission school in Addis Ababa then picked up some French working with a French veterinary team.Bahru Zewde, \\"Heruy's \\"Ya- Heywat Tarik\\" and Mahtama-Sellase's \\"Che Balaw\\": Two Perceptions of a Biographical Dictionary\\", History in Africa, 23 (1996), p. 391 Regent Ras Tefari (later Emperor Haile Selassie) appointed Heruy in 1916 to serve as administrator of Addis Ababa.[Citatation Needed] He was a member of Ethiopia's first delegation to the League of Nations (7 August 1922) and part of the retinue that accompanied the Regent on his tour of Europe in 1924.Haile Selassie, My Life and Ethiopia's Progress: The Autobiography of Emperor Haile Sellassie I, translated from Amharic by Edward Ullendorff (New York: Frontline Books, 1999), vol. 1 pp. 77, 84. By the early 1930s, he was promoted to Foreign Minister, and held that office at the beginning of the Second Italo- Ethiopian War. A diplomatic mission to Japan in 1931 left him sufficiently impressed to argue for strengthened ties between the two nations. He hoped that by modeling their military training and modernization on Japan they could remain independent. This hoped proved illusory and the pro-Ethiopian aspect of the Japanese military fully accepted alliance with Italy soon after the war with that country began.Heruy's visit to Japan is discussed by J. Calvitt Clarke, \\"Ethiopia's Non-Western model for Westernization: Foreign Minister Heruy's mission to Japan, 1931\\" Heruy joined his Emperor in exile, although he had been one of three members of the council who had voted against Haile Selassie leaving Ethiopia to address the League of Nations in Geneva. Heruy died at Fairfield House,Anthony Mockler, Haile Selassie's War (New York: Olive Branch, 2003), p. 392 and was buried in the city of Bath where the Royal Household lived in exile at Fairfield House, before his body was eventually returned to Ethiopia.Shawn Sobers, 'Footsteps of the Emperor', HTV West 1999 Haile Selassie, who described Heruy in his autobiography as \\"brilliant and strong-willed\\", included the following words in his elegy at Heruy's funeral: : My colleague and friend Herui, as you depart after successful completion of your service to your country, if I fail to say 'you are great', your works would give the lie to my words. Although the storm generated by wicked people destabilized the world and buffeted you, it did not defeat you. Yet you had to obey the rule of the Great and Kind Lord. We are all subject to this eventually.Haile Selassie I, My Life and Ethiopia's Progress, Haile Sellassie I, King of Kings of Ethiopia: Addis Abeba, 1966 E.C. translated by Ezekiel Gebissa, et. alia, (Chicago: Frontline Books, 1999), vol. 2 p. 73  Intellectual importance  Selassie was known for his support for, and informal association with, the broader and loose 'Young Japanisers'. The grouping refers to an Ethiopian school of thought that arose in the early Twentieth Century which compared Ethiopia to Japan, and favored modernization that was similar to the Meiji Restoration; other intellectuals included Heruy's friend Tekle Hawariat Tekle Mariyam and G√§bre-Heyw√§t Bayk√§da√±.Discussed by Bahru Zewde in his A History of Modern Ethiopia, second edition (Oxford: James Currey, 2001), p. 110. More than most, Heruy saw similarities between Japan and Ethiopia. These included that both had longstanding imperial lines, both had had \\"roving capitals\\", and both had resisted the West. He believed that Ethiopia and Japan needed to be more aware of each other as they both resembled each other in his opinion. That being said he recognized Japan was the more prosperous of the two and had more successfully modernized. His 1932 work Mahidere Birhan: Hagre Japan (\\"The Document of Japan\\") spelled out this philosophy. Heruy's only novel, the first written and published since Afawarq Gabra Iyasus's Lebb Wallad Tarik, is Addis Al√§m (\\"The New World\\"), published in 1932. As Jack Fellman explains, \\"The plot of the 80-page novel is basically simple, the narrative proceeds quickly and vividly with few complications, and the language is clear and concise. No foreign words are used.\\" It recounts the life of one Awwaqa, who is born in Tegulet, which Heruy describes as a remote and backward village. He desires to be educated and succeeds in going to France by taking service with a visiting Frenchman. While in Paris Awwaqa studies languages and sciences, but after eight years feels homesick and returns to Tagulat. Once he returns, however he finds his family and friends cannot tolerate his new \\"revolutionary\\" foreign ideas. The novel continues expands the theme of the conflict between Awwaqa's modern European ideas and Ethiopia's more traditional ones. Addis Alam ends on an optimistic note, \\"perhaps as befitting a pioneering work\\" writes Fellman, with a compromise solution proposed by the Ethiopian Church meets and recognizes the benefits of the western world and the need to change at least some aspects of Ethiopia's traditional ways.Jack Fellman, \\"Ethiopia's Second Novel\\", Research in African Literatures, 25 (1994), pp. 181-182 His son, Sirak Heruy, who was educated at Victoria College in Alexandria and Oxford University, translated Samuel Johnson's Rasselas into Amharic.Bahru Zewde, Pioneers, p. 87 Writings Heruy Welde Sellase published 28 books, which include the following: *Y√§-h…ôyw√§t tarik (Biographie): b√§h ∑ala z√§m√§n l√§min√§su l…ô«ß«ßoƒçƒç mastaw√§qiya [History of Life (Biography): A Guide for Future Generations] Addis Abeba: E.C. 1915 (= AD 1922/1923) *W√§da«ße l…ôbbe [My Friend, my Heart].

Usage Deltamethrin is a highly effective insecticide. It is used, among other applications, for the production of Long-lasting insecticidal nets (LLINs), which, along with indoor residual spraying (IRS), are the main vector control strategies recommended by the World Health Organization (WHO) for the management of malaria. https://scholar.google.com/scholar_lookup?title=World%20Malaria%20Report%202015&publication;_year=2015 Deltamethrin belongs to a group of pesticides called synthetic pyrethroids. This pesticide is toxic to aquatic life, particularly fish, and therefore must be used with extreme caution around water. Although generally considered safe to use around humans, it is still neurotoxic to humans. Deltamethrin is able to pass from a woman's skin through her blood and into her breast milk, although breastfeeding remains safe under prevailing conditions. It is an allergen and causes asthma in some people. Production Deltamethrin is a pyrethroid composed of a single stereoisomer, of a possible 8 stereoisomers, selectively prepared by the esterification of (1R,3R)- or cis-2,2-dimethyl-3-(2,2-dibromovinyl)cyclopropanecarboxylic acid with (alpha,S)- or (+)-alpha-cyano-3-phenoxybenzyl alcohol or by selective recrystallization of the racemic esters obtained by esterification of the (1R,3R)- or cis-acid with the racemic or (alpha-R, alpha-S, or alpha-R/S)- or + or ‚àí alcohol. Malaria control Deltamethrin plays a key role in controlling malaria vectors, and is used in the manufacture of long-lasting insecticidal mosquito nets. It is used as one of a battery of pyrethroid insecticides in control of malarial vectors, particularly Anopheles gambiae, and whilst being the most employed pyrethroid insecticide, can be used in conjunction with, or as an alternative to, permethrin, cypermethrin and organophosphate-based insecticides, such as malathion and fenthion. Resistance to deltamethrin (and its counterparts) is now extremely widespread and threatens the success of worldwide vector control programmes. Resistance to deltamethrin Resistance has been characterised in several insects, including important vectors of malaria like the mosquito Anopheles gambiae as well as non-disease carrying pests like bed bugs. Mosquitoes Methods of resistance include thickening of the cuticle of the insect to limit permeation of the insecticide, metabolic resistance via overexpression of metabolizing cytochrome P450 mono-oxygenases and glutathione-S-transferases, and the knockdown resistance (kdr) sodium channel mutations which render the action of insecticides ineffectual, even when co-administered with piperonyl butoxide. Characterization of the different forms of resistance among mosquitoes has become a top priority in groups studying tropical medicine due to the high mortality of those who reside in endemic areas. Bed bugs Two mutations, the valine to leucine mutation (V419L) and the leucine to isoleucine mutation (L925I) in voltage-gated sodium channel Œ±-subunit gene, have been identified as responsible for knockdown resistance to deltamethrin in bed bugs. One study found that 88% of bed bug populations in the US had at least one of the two mutations, if not both, meaning that deltamethrin resistance among bed bugs is currently making this insecticide obsolete.  Poisoning = In humans  Since deltamethrin is a neurotoxin, it temporarily attacks the nervous system of any animal with which it comes into contact. Skin contact can lead to tingling or reddening of the skin local to the application. If taken in through the eyes or mouth, the most common symptom is facial paraesthesia, which can feel like many different abnormal sensations, including burning, partial numbness, \\"pins and needles\\", skin crawling, etc. There are no reports indicating that chronic intoxication from pyrethroid insecticides causes motor neuron disease. Recently, in South Africa, residues of deltamethrin were found in breast milk, together with DDT, in an area that used DDT treatment for malaria control, as well as pyrethroids in small-scale agriculture. There are no antidotes, and treatment must be symptomatic, as approved by a physician. Over time, deltamethrin is metabolized, with a rapid loss of toxicity, and passed from the body. A poison control center should be contacted in the event of an accidental poisoning. A 2015 study conducted in Brittany, France found a negative correlation between deltamethrin exposure (measured through the presence of a metabolite in urine) and cognitive scores in infants.  In domestic animals  Cases of toxicity have been observed in cattle following use of agricultural deltamethrin preparation in external application for tick control. It has also commonly known as having severe poisoning effects on the cattle which is vulnerable to the pyrethroid.

The Province later on expanded its presence in East Asia, Africa and the Americas in the 20th century to help build and serve communities. It was considered to be largest province in the whole Augustinian Order, with more than 300 affiliated Augustinian friars working in The Philippines, Spain, Tanzania, India, Venezuela, Peru, Costa Rica, El Salvador, Honduras, and China, according to a 2018 statistic from the Province. The Province was formally merged with three other Spanish Augustinian Provinces during the 186th Ordinary General Chapter of the Order of Saint Augustine in Rome on 16 September 2019 to create a unified Spanish Augustinian Province of St. John of Sahagun, a move which aims to restore the Augustinian Order in Spain, which has been in decline prior to the decision. The Spanish Exploration In 1565, Adelantado Miguel L√≥pez de Legazpi arrived in the Philippines at the head of an expedition sent by Viceroy Lu√≠s de Velasco of New Spain to discover islands west of the Moluccas upon the orders of Philip II of Spain. Enlisted to guide the perilous voyage was the famed navigator Andr√©s de Urdaneta (b. 1498 - d. June 3, Mexico, 1568), an Augustinian friar. Although a veteran of previous voyages across the Pacific, Father Urdaneta was reluctant to take part in the expedition, let alone command it. When he declined the offer to lead, the responsibility fell upon the shoulders of Legazpi. Already in his sixties and in poor health, Father Urdaneta considered himself retired as a navigator especially after having earlier turned his back on the world by joining the Augustinian Order in Mexico. But when King Philip II of Spain ordered the viceroy to \\"prepare a fleet of discovery\\" of the western islands near the Moluccas and wrote Father Urdaneta a letter asking him to guide the voyage, he felt compelled to obey for \\"the glory of God and the expansion of our faith.\\" The Spanish Crown between 1525 and 1542 had sent several expeditions to strengthen its claim on the Moluccas, but none of these voyages ended in a permanent Spanish presence in the Philippines. Having ascended to the Spanish throne, Philip II ordered his men to concentrate their efforts on the Philippines, a move that was also meant to avoid further conflict with the Portuguese, the main Spanish rival in this frenetic period of the Age of Discovery. Augustinians: First Catholic Missionaries in the Philippines If the greatest missionary work of the Augustinian Order has been displayed in the Philippines, it is because they were the first Catholic missionaries there. Father Andres de Urdaneta and four other Augustinians‚ÄîFathers Mart√≠n de Rada (b. 1533 - d. 1578), Diego de Herrera, Pedro de Gamboa and Andr√©s de Aguirre‚Äîstarted a successful apostolate in Ceb√∫ as soon as they landed in 1565. Legazpi founded the first Spanish settlement there in a spot where his men had stumbled upon a statue of the Child Jesus in a burnt hut. He named the place Villa del Sant√≠simo Nombre de J√©sus in honor of the Holy Child. The Spaniards considered it miraculous to have found the statue, a gift from Ferdinand Magellan to the wife of the rajah of Cebu after her conversion to Catholicism in 1521. Father Urdaneta returned to Mexico and decided to stay after being dissuaded by his family and friends. Meanwhile, hardships brought about by lack of food, harsh living conditions and probing attacks mounted by the Portuguese from the Moluccas forced Legazpi to set sail for Panay island, where he replenished his supplies and planned for a definitive voyage to Luzon that would eventually lead to over 300 years of Spanish colonial rule in the Philippines with the establishment of Manila on June 24, 1571 as the capital of the new Spanish colony. Formation of a New Province Tomb of the Adelantado Miguel L√≥pez de Legazpi in San Agustin Church, Intramuros, Manila. Under the leadership of Father Alfonso Gutierez, 24 Spanish Augustinians in 1575 landed in the islands and, with the guidance of both Fathers Herrera and Rada, worked very successfully, at first as itinerant preachers. Their missionary zeal played a pivotal role in the evolution of the archipelago into today's only Catholic nation in Asia. In Manila, the Augustinians had been given a piece of land within the walled city of Intramuros to build a church and a monastery. The first provincial chapter of the Province of the Most Holy Name of Jesus of the Philippines was held at San Agustin Church on 03 May 1572, which elected Fray Martin de Rada, OSA as the province's first prior provincial. In 1575, then Prior General of the Order, Fr. Tadeo de Perusa, issued a decree formally establishing the new Augustinian Province in the Philippines which was to be known as the Province of the Most Holy Name of Jesus of the Philippines (Santisimo Nombre de Jesus de Filipinas). To provide a steady source of missionaries to the Philippines following the founding of the province, a seminary was created in Valladolid, Spain. San Agust√≠n Church and Monastery served as the province's headquarters for more than 300 years. It is closely tied to the history of the Philippines for it was here where the Augustinians had planned and carried out the evangelization of the country and had first introduced Western ideas to the natives while serving as a vanguard of resistance against the state. Father Rada, for example, denounced abuses committed by Spanish authorities against the local population and reported these to Philip ll. His vigorous advocacy for justice has earned him a place in history as the \\"Defender of the Natives.\\" A key document in this matter was his Parecer del Provincial fray Mart√≠n de Rada, agustino, sobre las cosas de estas tieras (\\"Opinions of Provincial Father Martin de Rada, augustinian friar, about the things of this land\\"), dated at Manila, 21 June 1575. It is also where the Adelantado Miguel L√≥pez de Legazpi is buried. The missionaries of the Province have given the world valuable descriptive works on Asian countries and their peoples especially in the early days of Western presence in what was then the inscrutable East. Included in this key Augustinian contribution are Father Cipriano Navarro's important work on The Inhabitants of the Philippines and a monumental work in six volumes by Father Manuel Blanco titled Flora de Filipinas (Madrid, 1877--). Both works are priceless contributions to literature and learning. World-renowned botanist Father Blanco had built a botanical garden for his plant experiments in Intramuros that became the basis for his internationally acclaimed book. In Luzon, the Augustinians embarked upon the evangelization of native settlements and subsequently built churches in Calumpit, Malolos, Hagonoy, Bigaa, Guiguinto and Quingua in the province of Bulacan and in Lubao, Betis, Macabebe, Bacolor, San Fernando and Apalit in province of Pampanga. Economic, Social and Cultural Labors in Asia and Beyond Since 1565 until the present, more than 3,000 Augustinian missionaries have dedicated themselves to apostolic, social, and cultural labor in the Philippines, China and Japan. The Augustinian missions in the Philippines have provided missionaries for the East since their first establishment. In 1603 some of them entered Japan, where several were martyred, and in 1653 others reached China, where in 1701 the Order had six missionary stations. Father Rada was one of those who visited China, and he reported extensively on his findings and impressions about the country. He is considered to be the first ambassador of the Philippines to China during colonial times. Before the Philippine Revolution of 1896, the Augustinians administered over four hundred schools and churches in the islands scattered across the archipelago. In 1904 they established the University of San Agustin in Iloilo City that eventually emerged as the largest Augustinian educational institution in the world in terms of student population and the only Augustinian university in the Asia-Pacific region. They have also served as the custodians of the Santo Ni√±o Shrine in Cebu City, which houses the centuries-old image of the Child Jesus recovered by Legazpi's men in 1565, within the Basilica del Santo Ni√±o de Cebu. On 12 August 1879, Pope Leo XIII, in the Breve Ex debito Pastoralis Officii, entrusted to the Augustinians of the Province of the Philippines the Mission of Northern Hunan in China. According to historical records, the Augustinians were able to establish main mission stations in three different areas: in Changteh (present-day Changde), Lichow (present-day Lixian) and Yochow (present-day Yueyang). Because of the effort of the Augustinians and the faithful of Northern Hunan, the mission was elevated to the Apostolic Vicariate of Northern Hunan in September 19 of the same year, which later on became the Apostolic Vicariate of Changteh on 03 December 1924. On 11 April 1946, the Apostolic Vicariate became the Diocese of Changde, under the Ecclesiastical province of Changsha. Several Augustinians from the Province of the Philippines also served as local ordinaries ever since 1879, like Fray Elias Suarez, OSA, Fray Saturnino de la Torre Merino, OSA, Fray Luis Perez Perez, OSA, Fray Agustin Gonzalez, OSA, Fray Juvencio Juan Hospital de la Puebla, OSA (before he resigned in 1917 to enter the Carthusian Order in 1919), Fray Angel Diego Carbajal, OSA and Fray Gerardo Faustino Herrero Garrote, OSA. Fray Michael Yang Gaojian, OSA, former superior of the Augustinians in China in the 1950s, was also consecrated as bishop of the Diocese of Changde but without any papal mandate. He entered the Augustinian Order in 1931, was ordained priest in 1938 and was consecrated as bishop by the Chinese Patriotic Catholic Association (CPCA) in October 1958. The Province in 1968, also reestablished the Augustinian presence on the Indian subcontinent, which passing Augustinian missionaries first reached by way of Goa in 1542. Incidentally, these four men‚ÄîFathers Jeronimo de Santisteban, Nicolas de Alvarado, Sebastian Reina (or de Trasierra), and Alfonso de Alvarado‚Äîonce they had returned to Spain, became the first four priests and members of a religious order to have sailed entirely around the world. From its houses in Spain and its missions in the Philippines, the Province in the past had deployed missionaries to Brazil, Colombia, Peru, and Venezuela. At present, it is also actively involved in training and sending missionaries to Tanzania. The Province of the Philippines: A Prolific Mother Throughout its lifetime, the Province of the Most Holy Name of Jesus of the Philippines became a prolific mother to other Augustinian circumscriptions worldwide who were in need of additional help for administering the faithful. Being the biggest province in the Order, the province helped and gave aid to the Province of Brazil, Province of Castille, Province of the Holy Name of Jesus of Spain, and the Provinces of Nuestra Se√±ora de Gracia de Colombia and Nuestra Se√±ora de Gracia de Peru, which enabled these provinces to revitalize itself. But the most famous province born out from the Province of the Philippines is the Augustinian Province of Santo Ni√±o de Cebu, which is based in the Philippines. The Province of Santo Ni√±o de Cebu and The Augustinian Vicariate of the Orient At the turn of the twentieth century, the Province of the Most Holy Name of Jesus of the Philippines decided to shift its missionary activities to newer territories, such as Peru, Colombia, and Venezuela. As a logical consequence of this move, the presence of the province in the country was reduced to a Vicariate in 1926, the Augustinian Vicariate of the Philippines, to retain the presence of the Spanish province in the country, which moved its provincial seat from the Convento de San Agustin in Intramuros to the Casa Provincial de Andres de Urdaneta in Madrid. The Augustinian presence in the country was then reduced to a minimum. To compensate for this loss of manpower, the remaining Augustinians intensified the recruitment and formation of Filipino candidates. And as the number of the latter increased and their preparedness adequately established, the idea of creating a new Province came to be seriously considered. Plans for the organization of such a Province began in 1974 when the Regional Assembly of the Philippine Augustinian Vicariate asked for the creation of a Vice-Province in the islands. Though the plan was not realized, it was again revived by a group of Filipino Augustinians at a meeting in the Basilica Minore del Santo Ni√±o in Cebu on April 29, 1981. The plan this time was for the creation of a new Province. The move to create a new Province, which would be called the Province of Sto. Ni√±o de Cebu-Philippines, was officially endorsed by the Regional Assembly of the Augustinian Vicariate of the Philippines at the closing of its sessions on August 19, 1981, in the Monastery of San Agustin, Intramuros, Manila, and by the Provincial Chapter of the Province of the Most Holy Name of Jesus of the Philippines, held in Valladolid, Spain on July 17, 1982. The proposal was overwhelmingly approved by the members of the 174th General Chapter held in Rome on September 15, 1983, and the new province was canonically established on December 25, 1983. The province of Cebu was officially formed on September 13, 1983, inside the Istituto Patristico Augustinianum in Rome during the 174th General Chapter of the Augustinian Order, where ninety-three delegates approved the creation of the first indigenous Augustinian province in Asia after over 400 years of control by Spanish religious leaders. But even before the erection of the new province, the Spanish Province of the Most Holy Name of Jesus of the Philippines and the Order at large decided to create a new vicariate, The Augustinian Vicariate of the Orient, to continue the historical, traditional and cultural identity of the Spanish province in the country. The new name of the vicariate was also seen as fitting for its new mission, which is to propagate the Good News of Jesus Christ and to evangelize people in Eastern and Southeastern Asia and to reconnect with the mission in China and India. Two communities in the country were retained to the Vicariate of the Orient when the new province of Cebu was founded: San Agustin Church in Intramuros, Manila and Colegio San Agustin in Makati City, while 2 other communities in India and 1 parish church in Hunan were also given to the Vicariate. All other Augustinian communities in the Philippines during this time were given to the Province of Cebu. As a consequence of the birth of the new province, the Province of the Philippines also had to rename itself as the Province of the Most Holy Name of Jesus of the Philippines of Spain to differentiate itself from the new Filipino Province of Cebu. Circumscriptions of the Province of the Most Holy Name of Jesus of the Philippines of Spain Below is an updated list of all the circumscriptions that are dependent to the Province of the Most Holy Name of Jesus of the Philippines of Spain of the Order of Saint Augustine: * The Circumscription of Spain (Spain) * The Augustinian Vicariate of the Orient (Philippines and China) * The Augustinian Vicariate of Our Lady of Grace (India) * The Augustinian Vicariate of Iquitos (Peru) * The Augustinian Vicariate of Venezuela (Venezuela) * The Augustinian Delegation of Tanzania (Tanzania) * The Augustinian Delegation of Centroamerica The Union of Augustinian Provinces of Spain The Province of the Most Holy Name of Jesus of the Philippines of Spain was formally merged with three other Spanish Augustinian Provinces (Province of Castille, Province of the Sacred Heart of Jesus of Matritense, and Province of the Most Holy Name of Jesus of Spain) during the 186th Ordinary General Chapter of the Order of Saint Augustine in Rome on 16 September 2019 to create a unified Spanish Augustinian Province of St. John of Sahagun, a move which aims to restore the Augustinian Order in Spain, which has been in decline prior to the decision. As a consequence to the unification of these provinces, some of the province's circumscriptions or dependents have been elevated, like the Augustinian Vicariate of the Orient, which has been elevated as The Augustinian Province of the Philippines (a new, separate province from the Province of Cebu), and the Delegation of Tanzania, which has been elevated as The Augustinian Vicariate of Tanzania.

He was a pioneer of the Bible Christian movement in North America having sailed from Cornwall in 1846. Early life His parents were Paul Moyle Robins, a tin mine manager and Agnes Rule. In the spring of 1819 he was converted to the Bible Christian church by Ann Cory. In 1823 he filled a vacancy as a minister in the Ringsash circuit, and against his father's wishes decided on a life as a BC minister. His brother Matthew Robins would also later become a BC minister. Marriage On 5 September 1831 he married Ann Vickery in Brighton, Sussex, another Bible Christian itinerant minister. They had 2 children Sampson Paul Robins, born on 27 January 1833 in Faversham, Kent and Samuel Frederick Vickery Robins born 6 January 1836 in Kings Brompton, Somerset. Sampson became a Bible Christian minister for one year, before changing to the teaching profession. North America On 16 January 1846 it was decided to send three additional ministers to North America - one to Wisconsin, one to Ohio and an additional minister for Upper Canada. Paul Robins, along with William Hooper and Henry Ebbett were selected to travel to North America. Paul Robins and family, William and Rebecca Hooper and Henry Ebbett all traveled together aboard the Voluna. A copy of Paul Robins journal of the trip has been passed down in the family. After a number of years working on various circuits, he was moved to Bowmanville where he established the Book Room. His wife Ann died there in 1853. In 1854 he was one of the Canadian ministers sent back to England to help negotiate the creation of the separate Canadian conference. Death He died in Bowmanville, Ontario on 27 April 1890 and was buried in Providence Cemetery.

The official name is Penitentiaire Inrichting Over-Amstel, although it is also known as Penitentiaire Inrichting De Stadspoort or Penitentiaire Inrichtingen Amsterdam. Bijlmerbajes is part of the Custodial Institutions Agency (Dienst Justiti√´le Inrichtingen, DJI) of the Dutch Ministry of Justice within the Dutch criminal justice system. The building was designed as a humane prison without bars over the windows and was opened in 1978. However it turned out that the glass of the windows was not completely unbreakable, so bars were retroactively fitted, known as lamellen. The complex consists of 6 towers with small divisions. The towers are connected by a tunnel through the prison, known as the 'Kalverstraat'. The main entrance to the prison is from the Spaklerweg metro station. The alliterative name Bijlmerbajes was presumably acquired because the tower complex was constructed at the same time as highrise construction in the neighbouring Bijlmermeer, with bajes a Dutch slang term for \\"prison\\". Towers The six towers each operate as a separate prison, each with a different type of prisoners and/or function. The towers are connected via the 260 meter long central corridor Kalverstraat. Besides the six towers there are also six outside areas (one for each tower), three gymnasiums or sport-centres, a small religious building functioning as church and mosque. A central front building houses some central functions such as the kitchen, visitor reception rooms, the entry processing department and the offices. Each tower has 14 floors. Each department or pavilion has two floors connected via open stairs. Vertical transport between the pavilions and the four shared floors is possible via lifts. Two large lifts are used by the prisoners and a special small lift is only available for staff. In normal circumstances staff and inmates never share a lift. Emergency stairs are provided on two locations: one set next to the lifts and another shaft is built on the other end of each tower. Many activities take place on the remaining four floors, away from the pavilions. Examples are: working in the workshops on the ground-floor, library, training or education, yard-time, doctors office etc. The total floorspace of the complex is 84.860 m2Details PI Overamstel on site of Rijksgebouwendienst. Visited 15 February 2009 The six towers are: Note: HvB stands for Huis van bewaring which is the term for a prison for people awaiting sentencing or people convicted to a jailtime up to 6 months. Criminals convicted to a longer sentence than 6 months are moved to a prison, but often this last term is used for an HVB as well. Het Schouw A standard HvB with five pavilions. Three of them offer cells with more than one prisoner (meermans cel), one standard pavilion with only single person cells and one special care unit for prisoners needing more or special attention. The special care unit has extra facilities and trained staff to house persons that need extra care, such as prisoners with psychological problems or drug- addicts. Het Schouw offers a standard day program between 09:00 and 16:00. In the afternoon activities like sport, recreation, library, receiving visitors and yard-time. Optional prisoners can earn some money (approximately 20 Euros per week) by performing simple work in the workshop. In HvB's work is optional, but people not working remain locked up in their cell during working hours. The HvB is named after a bend in the River Amstel which is nearby the complex.

De Weg is primarily used for repeating offenders (veelplegers). The five pavilions each with 24 cells. Three of these 24 can hold multiple prisoners (normally two prisoners), the other 21 are small cells for one prisoner. For communal use each pavilion has a shared area for recreation, a kitchen and communal showers. The day program is roughly the same as in Het Schouw DJI website about De Weg . Website of the Custodial Institutions Agency. Visited 12 February 2009 Demersluis Demersluis is also a HvB. It can hold 125 prisoners. The five pavilions are divided into: * one providing multi-person (2) cells * two reserved for so called arrestanten. Arrestanten are people who have failed to pay their fines or who didn't show up when sentenced to do community work. * two (half) pavilions offer a specialized program for addicts who want to use their time behind bars to fight their addiction problems. * the last pavilion houses a National department for dangerous prisoners. Prisoners who are deemed too dangerous to stay in a normal HvB can be detained in this section. The program offered in the normal departments is comparable with Het Schouw. The prisoners following the program to fight their addiction follow a special program. The HvB is named after a former sluice or locks between the River Amstel and the former Zuiderzee (now IJsselmeer). This name was chosen because this tower was original used as the central entrance-tower. All incoming prisoners were housed here before being placed in one of the remaining towers. Demersluis could thus be seen as a sluice between the outside world and the (rest of the) prison. DJI website about Demersluis . Website of the Custodial Institutions Agency. Visited 12 February 2009 De Schans Centre for stelselmatige daders ‚Äì ISD. Criminals convicted of several‚Äîrelatively light‚Äîcrimes within a five-year period can be sent to an ISD. These offenders commit many relatively small crimes and earlier prison sentences didn't stop them re-offending. Many of these prisoners are drug addicts who commit their crimes to finance their habit. People convicted to the ISD program can be locked up for a period of two years, even when the normal sentence for that crime is much shorter. The relative new ISD punishment was set up to protect the society for a longer period from these criminals and offer special treatment to these criminals.Information about ISD, website of the Custodial Institutions Agency.

Het Veer is a national crisis facility to accommodate people with severe psychological problems. Het Veer can accommodate 66 prisoners; 60 male and 6 female. Some 300 prisoners are sent to Het Veer each year. Het Veer is the only facility where patients can receive forced depot medication as it is the only place with 24/7 medical staff. On arrival in Het Veer (in most cases transferred from another prison that couldn't handle the prisoner) the patient will be observed for some time. During this period the staff will decide about an individual treatment program and all effort is given to calm down the patient. When the patient is stabilized he will be treated for his problems until he is ready to return to a normal facility or to go to a special centre (outside or within the justice system).

Like most other organophosphates, its mode of action is via cholinesterase inhibition. Due to its relatively low toxicity towards humans and mammals, fenthion is listed as moderately toxic compound in U.S. Environmental Protection Agency and World Health Organization toxicity class.HSDB.

Uses  Fenthion is a contact and stomach insecticide used against many biting insects. It is particularly effective against fruit flies, leaf hoppers, cereal bugs, stem borers, mosquitoes, animal parasites, mites, aphids, codling moths, and weaver birds. It has been widely used in sugar cane, rice, field corn, beets, pome and stone fruit, citrus fruits, pistachio, cotton, olives, coffee, cocoa, vegetables, and vines. Based on its high toxicity on birds, fenthion has been used to control weaver birds and other pest-birds in many parts of the world. Fenthion is also used in cattle, swine, and dogs to control lice, fleas, ticks, flies, and other external parasites.USEPA. (2001). Interim Reregeistration Eligibility Decision for Fenthion.

Amid concerns of harmful effects on environment, especially birds, Food and Drug Administration no longer approves uses of fenthion. However, fenthion has been extensively used in Florida to control adult mosquitoes. After preliminary risk assessments on human health and environment in 1998 and its revision in 1999, USEPA issued an Interim Reregistration Eligibility Decision (IRED) for fenthion in January 2001. The EPA has classified fenthion as Restricted Use Pesticide (RUP), and warrants special handling because of its toxicity.ASTDR. (2005). Toxicologic Information about Insecticides Used for Eradicating Mosquitoes (West Nile Virus Control). Department of Health and Human Services: Agency for Toxic Substances and Disease Registry. Available at http://www.atsdr.cdc.gov/consultations/west_nile_virus/fenthion.html Accessed April 25, 2009. Some common trade names for fenthion are Avigel, Avigrease, Entex, Baytex, Baycid, Dalf, DMPT, Mercaptophos, Prentox, Fenthion 4E, Queletox, and Lebaycid. Fenthion is available in dust, emulsifiable concentrate, granular, liquid concentrate, spray concentrate, ULV, and wettable powder formulations.  Synthesis  Fenthion can be synthesized by condensation of 4-methylmercapto-m-cresol and dimethyl phosphorochloridothionate.  Health effects  Fenthion exposure to general population is quite limited based on its bioavailability. Common form of fenthion exposure is occupation related, and occurs through dermal contact or inhalation of dust and sprays. Another likely means of contamination is through ingestion of food, especially, if it has been applied quite recently with fenthion. So far, ingestion is the most likely severe poisoning case on humans and animals. To avoid this, crops applied with fenthion should be allowed enough degradation time before harvesting. Normally, two to four weeks time is enough depending upon the type of crop. Fenthion poisoning is consistent with symptoms of other organophosphate effects on human health. Primarily, the effect is cholinesterase inhibition. Acute toxicity Acute poisoning of fenthion results in miosis (pinpoint pupils), headache, nausea/vomiting, dizziness, muscle weakness, drowsiness, lethargy, agitation, or anxiety. If the poisoning is moderate or severe, it results in chest tightness, breathing difficulty, hypertension, abdominal pain, diarrhea, heavy salivation, profuse sweating, or fasciculation. Chronic toxicity Chronic effect of fenthion has not been reported.  Environmental effects  Despite short half-life in the environment, fenthion toxicity is highly significant to birds and estuarine/marine invertebrates. Even though some parts of the world use fenthion to control pest birds, such as weaver bird, many non-targeted wild birds are victim of fenthion poisoning. Acute symptoms of fenthion poisoning in birds include tearing of the eyes, foamy salivation, lack of movement, tremors, congestion of the windpipe, lack of coordination in walking, and an abnormally rapid rate of breathing or difficult breathing. Fenthion has been found toxic to fishes and other aquatic invertebrates. Bees are also found to be greatly affected by fenthion contamination.  Degradation in nature  Photodegradation and biodegradation are common mechanisms of fenthion degradation in the environment. In the atmosphere, vapor phase fenthion reacts rapidly with photochemically produced hydroxyl radicals, and its half-life is about 5 hours. In soil and water, photodegradation is again predominant mechanism if there is enough presence of sunlight. Under normal aquatic environment, half-life of fenthion in water is 2.9 to 21.1 days. It may be photodynamically, chemically or biologically degraded. The degradation mechanisms can be hydrolysis, oxidation, and/or alkylation-dealkylation, which are dependent on the presence of light, temperature, alkali, or enzymatic activity. In soil, fenthion degradation ranges from four to six weeks and it occurs through photodegradation as well as anaerobic or non-photolytic organisms. However, soil particles strongly adsorb fenthion making it less susceptible to percolate with water through the soil.  Regulation =India Fenthion was used in India for more than 30 years as a larvicide for control of mosquito larvae. The compound was on the review list of Central Insecticide Board in India and they decided to ban the product due to high toxicity for usage. The product cannot be manufactured in India after January 2017. The government of India has released the Gazzetta notification with that effect of banning many toxic insecticides such as fenthion and DDVP.http://www.indianemployees.com/gazette- notifications/details/draft-order-banning-of-pesticides-order-2016  Australia  Fenthion and dimethoate were widely used to combat the Queensland fruit fly (Bactrocera tyroni), a species that has caused more than $28.5 million a year in damage to Australian fruit crops. However, it was banned in 2011 due to safety concerns. Other insecticides and control techniques are being investigated to control the spread of this pest.

PƒÅ·πáini quotes ten ancient authorities whose texts have not survived, but they are believed to have been VyƒÅkara·πáa scholars. VyƒÅkara·πáa is related to the fourth Vedanga called Nirukta. VyƒÅkara·πáa scholarship has dealt with linguistic analysis to establish the exact form of words to properly express ideas, and Nirukta scholarship has focussed on linguistic analysis to help establish the proper meaning of the words in context. Etymology VyƒÅkara·πáa () means \\"separation, distinction, discrimination, analysis, explanation\\" of something.Damien Keown (2004), A Dictionary of Buddhism, Oxford University Press, , Article on Vyakarana It also refers to one of the six Vedangas, or the Vedic field of language analysis, specifically grammatical analysis, grammar, linguistic conventions which creates, polishes, helps a writer express and helps a reader discriminate accurate language. The word VyƒÅkara·πáa is also found in Mahayana sutras and first millennium Mahayana Buddhist texts, but with a different meaning. VyƒÅkara·πáa, in these Buddhist texts, means a prediction or prophecy by a Buddha to a Bodhisattva who has just embarked on the path, that he will achieve enlightenment and be a buddha. History VyƒÅkara·πáa emerged as a distinct auxiliary field of Vedic study in ancient times. Its aim was to prevent sloppy usage and transmission of the Vedic knowledge, states Howard Coward ‚Äì a professor emeritus at the University of Victoria and the founding editor of the Journal for Hindu-Christian Studies. VyƒÅkara·πáa helped ensure that the Vedic scriptures of Hinduism and its message of \\"Sabda Brahman\\" (explanation of metaphysical truths through words) that Vedic Rishis had realized by their efforts, remains available to all in a pristine form. In Indian traditions, VyƒÅkara·πáa has been one of the most important sciences, one extensively studied over its history, and that led to major treatises in the philosophy of language. PƒÅ·πáini and YƒÅska, two celebrated ancient scholars of VyƒÅkara·πáa, are both dated to several centuries prior to the start of the common era, likely the 5th-century BCE. However, both of them cite prior scholars and texts, which though lost to history, imply that the field of VyƒÅkara·πáa was an established and developed science of language before them. Between the two, Yaksa may be the older one and more known for Nirukta (etymology) ‚Äì the fourth auxiliary field of Vedic studies, but the evidence for him preceding PƒÅ·πáini is scanty and uncertain. In terms of dedicated treatise on VyƒÅkara·πáa, PƒÅ·πáini is the most recognized ancient Hindu scholar, and his A·π£·π≠ƒÅdhyƒÅyƒ´ (\\"Eight Chapters\\") is the most studied extant ancient manuscript on Sanskrit grammar. PƒÅ·πáini's fame spread outside India, and the reverence for ancient PƒÅ·πáini in northwest India is mentioned in Chinese texts of Xuanzang ‚Äì the 7th-century traveller and scholar.Frits Staal (1972), A Reader on the Sanskrit Grammarians, Massachusetts Institute of Technology Press, reprint by Motilal Banarsidass (1985), . The study of grammar and the structure of language is traceable to the Rigveda, or 2nd millennium BCE, in hymns attributed to sage Sakalya. Sakalya is acknowledged by PƒÅ·πáini's works. The literary evidence that the science of VyƒÅkara·πáa existed in Vedic times abound in the Brahmanas, Aranyakas and Upanishads, states Moriz Winternitz. The extant manuscripts of PƒÅ·πáini and Yaksa suggest that the Vedic age had competing schools of grammar. One school, for example, held that all nouns have verbal roots, while another held that not all nouns have verbal roots. However, it is unclear how, who or when these ancient Vedic theories of grammar originated, because those texts have not survived into the modern era. Pre-PƒÅ·πáinian schools There were many schools of Sanskrit grammar in ancient India, all established before the mid 1st-millennium BCE. PƒÅ·πáini's A·π£·π≠ƒÅdhyƒÅyƒ´ , which eclipsed all other ancient schools of grammar, mentions the names of ten grammarians. quote: \\"PƒÅ·πáini himself mentions several grammarians as having preceded him, such as Apisali, Kasyapa, Gargya, Galava, Cakravarmana, Bharadvaja, Sakatayana, Sakalya, Senaka, and Spho·π≠ayƒÅna. The Unadi-sutras are thought by some to be anterior to PƒÅ·πáini.\\" Also discusses the differences in opinions on interpreting Vedic texts, as given by Aurnabhava, Aupamanyava, Agrayana, Katthakya, Kautsa and Shakapuni ‚Äì all mentioned as \\"anterior to YƒÅska\\" on p. 169A·π£·π≠ƒÅdhyƒÅyƒ´ 6.1.92, 6.1.123-130, 5.4.112, 8.4.51-67, etc. (annotated in list)). Some of these pre-PƒÅ·πáinian scholars mentioned by PƒÅ·πáini include Apisali, Kasyapa, Gargya, Galava, Cakravarmana, Bharadvaja, Sakatayana, Sakalya, Senaka and Spho·π≠ayƒÅna. The works of most these authors are lost but we find reference of their ideas in the commentaries and rebuttals by later authors. YƒÅska's Nirukta is one of the earlier surviving texts, and he mentions ≈öƒÅka·π≠ƒÅyana, Krau·π£·π≠uki, GƒÅrgya among others. Post-PƒÅ·πáinian schools PƒÅ·πáini's A·π£·π≠ƒÅdhyƒÅyƒ´ is the most ancient extant manuscript on VyƒÅkara·πáa. It is a complete and descriptive treatise on Sanskrit grammar in aphoristic sutras format. This text attracted a famous and one of the most ancient commentary (bhƒÅ·π£ya) called the MahƒÅbhƒÅ·π£ya. The author of the MahƒÅbhƒÅ·π£ya is named Pata√±jali, who may or may not be the same person as the one who authored Yogasutras. The MahƒÅbhƒÅ·π£ya, or \\"Great Commentary\\", is more than a commentary on the A·π£·π≠ƒÅdhyƒÅyƒ´, it is the earliest known philosophical text of the Hindu grammarians. Non-Hindu texts and traditions on grammar emerged after Pata√±jali, some of which include the Sanskrit grammar by the Jain author Jainendra and the CƒÅndra grammar by the Buddhist Candragomin. Later Indian scholars simplified PƒÅ·πáini rules, and trimmed his compilation of sutras to essential 1,400 from comprehensive 4,000, eliminating those they felt were too difficult and complicated or those narrowly concerned with Vedic language. Non-Hindu traditions, such as Jainism and Buddhism, developed their own VyƒÅkara·πáa literature, but all of them are dated to the 1st-millennium CE, all of them condensed PƒÅ·πáini, accepted and flowered largely from his theories of VyƒÅkara·πáa. The 5th-century Hindu scholar Bhart·πõhari has been the next most influential VyƒÅkara·πáa thinker, wherein he presented his philosophy of grammar and how language affects thoughts. His theories on \\"philosophical problem of meaning\\", contained in the VƒÅkyapadƒ´ya, has been unique, states Howard Coward. Bhart·πõhari is considered to be a major architect of the \\"spho·π≠a theory\\" of meaning, in the Hindu traditions. Bhart·πõhari ideas were widely studied, but challenged as well in the last half of the first millennium, particularly by the ritual-driven, Mƒ´mƒÅ·πÉsƒÅ school of Hindu philosophy and by Dharmakirti of Buddhism. The Advaita Vedanta school of Hinduism defended the ideas of Bhart·πõhari. About the seventh century, the KƒÅ≈õikƒÅv·πõttƒ´ co-authored by Jayaditya and Vamana, and the tenth century studies of Helaraja on VyƒÅkara·πáa were the next major milestone. These Hindu texts were not only commented in Hindu tradition, but were the foundation of works of the Buddhist Jinendrabuddhi who is known for his grammar insights in Buddhist literature. The most studied VyƒÅkara·πáa scholars of early and mid-second millennium are Ksirasvamin, Haradatta, Maitreya Rakshita, and Kaiyata. The modern era VyƒÅkara·πáa scholars have included Bhattoji Dikshita, Konda Bhatta and Nagesha Bhatta. Location In terms of the place of VyƒÅkara·πáa scholarship over South Asian history, from ancient to 16th-century, Kashmir, Kerala, Nepal, Andhra Pradesh, Varanasi and Bengal have been influential, but the location of many VyƒÅkara·πáa scholars is unknown. Texts PƒÅ·πáini's text A·π£·π≠ƒÅdhyƒÅyƒ´ is in sutras format, has eight chapters, and cumulative total of 4,000 sutras. These rules are preceded by a list of fourteen groups of sounds, in three sections called the Shiva-sutra, Pratyahara-sutra and Maheshvara-sutra. The A·π£·π≠ƒÅdhyƒÅyƒ´ groups the rules of language, for clear expression and understanding, into two, the verbal (Dhatupatha) and the nominal bases (Ganapatha). The text consists of an analytical part covered in the first five chapters, and a synthetic part found in the last three chapters. The A·π£·π≠ƒÅdhyƒÅyƒ´ manuscript has survived with sets of ancillary texts (appendices) whose dates of composition and authors are contested. The main text is notable for its details and systematic nature, syntactic functions and arranging the sutras in an algorithmic fashion where the grammar rules typically apply in the order of sutras. The A·π£·π≠ƒÅdhyƒÅyƒ´ sutras were widely studied and a subject of the bhƒÅ·π£ya (review and commentary) tradition of Hinduism. The oldest emendation and commentary on the A·π£·π≠ƒÅdhyƒÅyƒ´ is attributed to KƒÅtyƒÅyana (~3rd century BCE), followed by the famous MahƒÅbhƒÅ·π£ya of Pata√±jali (~2nd century BCE) which has survived into the modern age. Other commentaries on the A·π£·π≠ƒÅdhyƒÅyƒ´ likely existed, because they are cited by other Indian scholars, but these texts are believed to be lost to history. Discussion PƒÅ·πáini writes that the Anjna (popular usage of a word) is the superseding authority, and the theoretically derived meaning of a word must be discarded and instead superseded by that which is the popular usage. The artha (meaning) of a shabda (word) is established by popular usage at the time the text was composed, not by etymological theory nor historical usage nor later usage. A sentence is a collection of words, a word is a collection of phonemes, states PƒÅ·πáini. The meaning of Vedic passages has to be understood through context, the purpose stated, keeping in mind the subject matter being discussed, what is stated, how, where and when. The A·π£·π≠ƒÅdhyƒÅyƒ´ tradition of Sanskrit language, with some reservations, accepts the premise that all words have verbal roots, and that words are created by affixing fragments to these roots. However, PƒÅ·πáini asserts that it is impossible to derive all nouns from verbal roots. The A·π£·π≠ƒÅdhyƒÅyƒ´ is primarily focussed on the study of words, how words are formed, and their correct architecture. However, it does not exclude syntax. PƒÅ·πáini includes the discussion of sentence structure. The text, state Howard and Raja, describes compound word formation based on syntactic and semantic considerations, such as in sutra 2.1.1. =What is a correct sentence?= PƒÅ·πáini asserts that a proper sentence has a single purpose, and is formed from a group of words such that, on analysis, the separate words are found to be mutually expecting each other. A sentence, states PƒÅ·πáini, must have syntactic unity, which includes mutual expectancy (Akansha) of the words and phonetic contiguity (Sannidhi) of construction. PƒÅ·πáini adds semantic fitness (Yogayata), but not tacitly. He accepts that a sentence can be grammatically correct even if it is semantically inappropriate or a deviant. =What does a word mean?= The A·π£·π≠ƒÅdhyƒÅyƒ´ describes numerous usage of words, and how the meaning of a word is driven by overall context of the sentences and composition it is found in. The popular usage and meaning of a word at the time the text was composed supersedes the historical or etymologically derived meanings of that word. A word has the conventional meaning at the time the text was composed, but it is not so when it is quoted (cited or referred to) from another prior art text. In the latter case, the Sanskrit word is suffixed with iti (literally, thus), wherein it means what the prior text meant it to be. YƒÅska asserted that both the meaning and the etymology of words is always context dependent. =Syntax, verbs and words= VyƒÅkara·πáa in the Hindu traditions has been a study of both the syntax structure of sentences, as well as the architecture of a word. For instance, PƒÅ·πáini asserts that grammar is about the means of semantically connecting a word with other words to express and understand meaning, and words are to be analyzed in the context they are used. KƒÅtyƒÅyana is quoted in Pata√±jali's MahƒÅbhƒÅ·π£ya on VyƒÅkara·πáa as asserting the nature of a sentence as follows: Similarly, Sayana asserts the scope of VyƒÅkara·πáa to be as follows: A word that is a verb is concerned with bhava (to become), while a noun is concerned with sattva (to be, reality as it is). Sattva and bhava are two aspects of the same existence seen from the static and dynamic points of view. Verbs according to VyƒÅkara·πáa indicate action in a temporal sequence while nouns are static elements, states K Kunjunni Raja. Pata√±jali's MahƒÅbhƒÅ·π£ya Pata√±jali's 2nd-century BCE MahƒÅbhƒÅ·π£ya is another important ancient text in VyƒÅkara·πáa scholarship. It is not a full commentary on everything PƒÅ·πáini wrote in A·π£·π≠ƒÅdhyƒÅyƒ´, but it is more a commentary on KƒÅtyƒÅyana's text on grammar called Varttikas, as well as the ideas of Vyadi. While KƒÅtyƒÅyana's additions have survived, Vyadi have not. The KƒÅtyƒÅyana's text reflects an admiration for PƒÅ·πáini, an analysis of his rules, their simplification and refinement. The differences between the grammar rules of PƒÅ·πáini and of KƒÅtyƒÅyana may be because of historical changes to Sanskrit language over the centuries, state Howard Coward and K Kunjunni Raja. Bhart·πõhari's VƒÅkyapadƒ´ya The VƒÅkyapadƒ´ya of Bhart·πõhari is a treatise on the philosophy of language, building on the insights of prior VyƒÅkara·πáa scholarship. According to Bhart·πõhari, states Scharfstein, all thought and all knowledge are \\"words\\", every word has an outward expression and inward meaning. A word may have a definition in isolation but it has meaning only in the context of a sentence. Grammar is a basic science in the Hindu traditions, explains Scharfstein, where it is externally expressed as relations between words, but ultimately internally understood as reflecting relations between the different levels of reality. Word is considered a form of energy in this Hindu text, one with the potential to transform a latent mind and realize the soul. Language evolves to express the transient material world first, and thereon to express feelings, the human desire for meaning in life and the spiritual inner world. Roots of words In YƒÅska's time, nirukta \\"etymology\\" was in fact a school which gave information of formation of words, the etymological derivation of words. According to the nairuktas or \\"etymologists\\", all nouns are derived from a verbal root. YƒÅska defends this view and attributes it to ≈öƒÅka·π≠ƒÅyana. While others believed that there are some words which are \\"Rudhi Words\\". 'Rudhi\\" means custom. Meaning they are a part of language due to custom, and a correspondence between the word and the thing if it be a noun or correspondence between an act and the word if it be a verb root. Such word can not be derived from verbal roots. YƒÅska also reports the view of GƒÅrgya, who opposed ≈öƒÅka·π≠ƒÅyana who held that certain nominal stems were 'atomic' and not to be derived from verbal roots Influence The VyƒÅkara·πáa texts have been highly influential on Hindu philosophies. The concept of a sentence (vakya) defined by PƒÅ·πáini, for instance, influenced and was similar to Jaimini, the later era founder of Mƒ´mƒÅ·πÉsƒÅ school of Hindu philosophy. However, ritual-focussed Mimamsa school scholars were generally opposed to central ideas of the Hindu Grammarians, while others Hindu schools such as Vedanta championed them. PƒÅ·πáini's work on VyƒÅkara·πáa has been called by George Cardona as \\"one of the greatest monuments of human intelligence\\".

An Australian international and New South Wales State of Origin representative , he played club football in the National Rugby League for the Canberra Raiders, Brisbane Broncos (with whom he won the 2000 NRL Premiership) and Penrith Panthers (with whom he won the 2003 NRL Premiership and Clive Churchill Medal) and, finally, the St. George Illawarra Dragons. Playing career A Woden Valley Rams junior, Priddis started his career with the Canberra Raiders, winning the club's rookie of the year award in his debut season. He was selected to represent New South Wales in the Super League Tri- series and also Australia in the post-season Trans-Tasman Super League test match. He later moved to the Brisbane Broncos and played at in the club's 2000 NRL grand final victory over the Sydney Roosters. Having won the 2000 NRL Premiership, the Broncos traveled to England to play against 2000's Super League V Champions, St Helens R.F.C. for the 2001 World Club Challenge, with Priddis playing at hooker in Brisbane's loss. Moving to the Penrith Panthers, in the 2003 NRL grand final, Priddis won the Clive Churchill Medal in the 18-6 victory over the Sydney Roosters. He scored one try and set up both other tries for winger Luke Rooney, whilst making 47 tackles. After this match he became the only Panther to have played in two successful Grand Finals, having won with Brisbane in 2000. No hooker had previously won the Clive Churchill Medal since it was instigated in 1986, though one other (Shaun Berrigan, in 2006) has won it since. As 2003 NRL premiers, the Panthers travelled to England to face Super League VIII champions, the Bradford Bulls in the 2004 World Club Challenge. Priddis played at and scored Penrith's sole try in their 22-4 loss. In 2009, Priddis was re-united with his former coach at the Broncos, Wayne Bennett, after they both transferred to the Dragons. Despite being advised by Dragons coach Wayne Bennett to retire at the end of the 2009 season, Priddis went on to make his 300th NRL appearance in 2010. While Priddis played a very important role in the team's success after taking over from Nathan Fien, who suffered a broken leg in Round 1 which kept him out most of the season, he did not play in the 2010 NRL Grand Final. By not playing in the Dragons' victorious Grand Final squad, he missed a golden opportunity to have won three Grand Finals at three clubs, a feat not achieved since Glenn Lazarus did so with the Broncos, Canberra Raiders and Melbourne Storm.

Hammershus Hammershus is a medieval era fortification at Hammeren on the northern tip of the Danish island of Bornholm. The fortress was partially demolished around 1750 and is now a ruin. It was partially restored around 1900. History Ruins of Hammershus Anton Eduard Kieldrup (1848) Hammershus was Scandinavia's largest medieval fortification and is one of the largest medieval fortification in Northern Europe.Bornholm Museum It is situated in the Baltic Sea above sea level. The fortification was erected in the 13th century and consists of the base castle residence and features a grand tower called the \\"mantel\\" tower. Hammershus Fortress features a perimeter wall around the castle grounds. During a number of successive struggles between the kings of Denmark versus the Archbishopric, the fortress served as a refuge for the Archbishops including Bishop Jens Grand. It was conquered by the king's army on a number of occasions, e.g. 1259, 1265, 1319, and 1325. In 1521, it was taken by king Christian II, who used it to imprison Bishop Jens Andersen Beldenak of Funen. The fortress was conquered by forces of L√ºbeck the same year. In 1658, Hammershus was occupied by Swedish forces, but a rebellion on the island terminated the Swedish rule. The rebels, led by Jens Pedersen Kofoed, shot the Swedish commandant Johan Printzenski√∂ld, and the Danish peasants traveled to Copenhagen to return the island to the king of Denmark. Corfitz Ulfeldt and his wife Leonora Christina were imprisoned in Hammershus 1660-1661\\\\. In 1743 Hammershus was abandoned as a stronghold. The remains were preserved in 1822. Since the major excavation and restoration work in the late 1800s, there has been a continuous maintenance of the ruins. Description Visitors to Hammershus have views of the coastline and the sea surrounding Bornholm. South of the castle is a deep valley, water filled hollows, and dense forest. There are a number points before arriving at castle where enemies could be stopped. The castle was built with box-like rooms surrounded by rings of fortifications. Each provided an additional layer of protection from invaders. Two natural spring ponds provided fresh drinking water on the side of the castle. Art Because of the unusual light on Bornholm, and because it has only four hours of darkness in summer, many of Denmark's earliest artists chose to paint views of Hammerhus. One of the most notable is by Anton Eduard Kieldrup from 1848, which is on display at the Bornholm Art Museum.

This is typically done by bending or twisting the head or upper body into abnormal positions. Commonly, spinal locks might strain the spinal musculature or result in a mild spinal sprain, while a forcefully and/or suddenly applied spinal lock may cause severe ligament damage or damage to the vertebrae, and possibly result in serious spinal cord injury, strokes, or death. Spinal locks and cervical locks are forbidden in IBJJF Brazilian jiu-jitsu competitions,http://ibjjf.org/wp-content/uploads/2015/04/RulesIBJJF_v4_en- US.pdf amateur MMA,http://www.abcboxing.com/ABC%20Amateur%20MMA%20Unified%20Rules.pdf multiple forms of no Gi Jiu Jitsu,http://ibjjf.org/wp- content/uploads/2015/04/RulesIBJJF_v4_en-US.pdf Judo, and other martial arts.https://www.usgrappling.com/rules/ However, professional MMA and some Brazilian jiu-jitsu competitionshttp://www.grapplersquest.com/event-rules do permit spinal locks and, particularly, neck cranks, and such moves are trained in various MMA and Brazilian jiu-jitsu schools. Spinal locks can be separated into two categories based on their primary area of effect on the spinal column: spinal locks on the neck are called neck cranks, and locks on the lower parts of the spine are called spine cranks. Neck crank Neck crank techniques from the supine position A neck crank (sometimes also referred to as a neck lock, and technically known as a cervical lock) is a spinal lock applied to the cervical spine causing hyperextension, hyperflexion, lateral hyperflexion, hyperrotation or extension-distraction. This happens either through bending, twisting or elongating. A neck crank is typically applied by pulling or twisting the head beyond its normal ranges of rotation. Neck cranks are usually banned from sports competitions, with notable exceptions in combat sports such as submission wrestling and mixed martial arts, where they are used as submission holds or as a guard passing technique. Can opener The can opener (in Judo referred to as kubi-hishigi) is a hyperflexing neck crank that can be applied from the opponent's guard or from a mounted position, by grabbing the opponent's head using the hands, and forcing it towards the chest of the opponent. If applied effectively in a competition it may force the opponent to submit. This may also refer to a type of neck compression employed from a rear mount position in which the back of the thumbs are used to drive into the neck starting from the high trapezius muscle toward the sternocleidomastoid muscles, causing severe discomfort, and even submission. As of 2006, this is permitted in shiai as long as the judoka's thumbs remain straight, and not bent. Its most common uses are to open up an opponent's chin for shime-waza or as a diversionary tactic. Cattle catch The cattle catch (also referred to as reverse crucifix, iron cross or stocks) is a hyperflexing neck crank involving trapping the opponent's hands and forcing the head towards his or her chest. The technique is performed with the opponent lying on his or her back, and the combatant performing the neck crank perpendicularly face-down in a side mount position above the head of the opponent, with the opponent's head resting towards his armpit. The combatant traps one arm using the legs, and the other using the arms. By using the pinned arms and legs as a point of leverage, the combatant can forcefully crank the head towards the opponent's chest. Crucifix neck crank The crucifix neck crank is similar to the cattle catch, but involves the combatant performing the neck crank being mounted on the opponent. Both of the opponent's arms are controlled, and the opponent's head is held in the armpit. By cranking the body upwards while keeping a tight hold on the opponents arms, the opponents head is forced towards his or her chest. Both the cattle catch and the crucifix neck crank are colloquially referred to simply as the crucifix, which often leads to confusion with the traditional crucifix position. Twister The twister (a similar move in wrestling is known as a guillotine) is a sideways body bend and neck crank, which involves forcing the head towards the shoulder while controlling the body, hence causing lateral hyperflexion of the cervical spine. The technique involves tension in several body parts, and depending on the flexibility of the recipient, can also involve pain in the knees, abdominals and torso. The twister is often confused as being a spine crank since it involves a degree of lateral non-cervical spinal flexion. The main pressure is however on the cervical spine, hence making it a neck crank. It is performed from a back mount single vine ride position, where the top man has one \\"hook\\" threaded through the bottom man's legs and secured behind the ankle. The top man then pulls the bottom man's opposite arm behind his own head and grabs hold of his opponent's head, pulling it down to his shoulder.

A spine crank is applied by twisting or bending the upper body beyond its normal ranges of motion, causing hyperextension, hyperflexion, or hyperrotation of the spine. In martial arts, spine cranks are generally rarer techniques than neck cranks because they are more difficult to apply. Twisting or bending the upper body to apply pressure to the spinal column requires large amounts of leverage compared to twisting or bending the head. One of the most well known spine cranks is the boston crab, which is usually depicted in pro-wrestling context. Similarly to neck cranks, spine cranks are illegal techniques in most combat sports, excluding some submission wrestling and mixed martial arts competitions, where they are used as submission holds. Even if allowed, spine cranks are very rarely featured because of the difficulty of applying them. Jonno Mears is the only man to have ever won a mixed martial arts bout with a Boston crab, which he achieved in 2017.http://www.bjpenn.com/mma-news/videos/fighter-fcc-19-boston-crab- submission-mma-wwe-pro-wrestling-chris-jericho-walls/ See also * Armlock * Leglock * Small joint manipulation * Wristlock References=Main references * Bernard, Thomas.

Eil Malk is part of the Rock Islands, a group of small, rocky, mostly uninhabited islands in Palau's Southern Lagoon, between Koror and Peleliu. There are about 70 other marine lakes located throughout the Rock Islands. Millions of golden jellyfish migrate horizontally across the lake daily. Jellyfish Lake is connected to the ocean through fissures and tunnels in the limestone of an ancient Miocene reef. However the lake is sufficiently isolated and the conditions are different enough that the diversity of species in the lake is greatly reduced from the nearby lagoon. The golden jellyfish, Mastigias cf. papua etpisoni, and possibly other species in the lake have evolved to be substantially different from their close relatives living in the nearby lagoons.  Lake stratification  Stratification diagram Jellyfish Lake is stratified into two layers, an oxygenated upper layer (mixolimnion) and a lower anoxic layer (monimolimnion). The oxygen concentration in the lake declines from about 5 ppm at the surface to zero at 15 meters (at the chemocline). Stratification is persistent and seasonal mixing does not occur. The lake is one of about 200 saline meromictic lakes that have been identified in the world. However most of these lakes are of freshwater origin. Permanently stratified marine lakes are unusual, but on Eil Malk and on other nearby islands there are eleven other apparently permanent stratified marine lakes. The stratification of the lake is caused by conditions which prevent or restrict the mixing of water vertically. These conditions include: #The lake is surrounded by rock walls and trees which substantially block the wind flow across the lake that would cause mixing. #The primary water sources for the lake (rain, runoff and tidal flows through tunnels) are all close to the surface. #The lake is in the tropics where seasonal temperature variation is small, and so the temperature inversion that can cause vertical mixing of lakes in temperate zones does not occur. The oxygenated layer extends from the surface to about . All organisms that require oxygen live in this layer including the jellyfish, a few species of fish and copepods. This layer is somewhat turbid. Visibility is limited to about . The salinity of this layer down to about is affected by rain and runoff, and below this, salinity levels are unaffected by freshwater inputs. Aerial view of Jellyfish Lake, looking out to sea The lake is connected to the sea via three tunnels that lie near the surface. The tunnels channel tidal water in and out of the lake. Tide levels in the lake are damped to about a third of the lagoon tidal levels. The tidal peaks are delayed from the lagoon tidal peaks by about 1 hour and forty minutes. Biologist William Hamner estimated that about 2.5% of the lake's volume is exchanged during a tidal flow. However, because the tidal water enters at the surface, the lower anoxic layer is largely unaffected by tidal flows. The anoxic layer extends from about below the surface to the bottom of the lake. The oxygen concentration in this layer is zero. The hydrogen sulfide concentration rises from about zero at the top of this layer to over 80 mg/liter at the bottom of the lake. The top three meters of this layer contains a dense population of bacteria, at least one species of which is a purple photosynthetic sulfur bacterium. This bacterial layer absorbs all sunlight so that the anoxic layer below the bacterial plate is dark, but transparent. Hamner estimated the visibility to be about 30 meters. The anoxic layer also contains high concentrations of ammonia and phosphate which are almost completely absent from the upper layer. The anoxic layer is potentially dangerous for divers, who can be poisoned through their skin. This risk is mitigated as scuba diving equipment is not allowed in the lake, thus limiting the depths to which individuals may dive.  Age of the lake  Jellyfish Lake is around 12,000 years old. This age estimate is based on the depth of the lake (about 30 meters), an estimate of the thickness of the sediment (at least 20 meters) and the rising sea level since the end of the last ice age. About 12,000 years ago, the sea level had risen to the point that sea water began to fill the Jellyfish Lake basin.  Jellyfish species  Golden and spotted jellyfish comparison. Note the loss of spots, color and greatly reduced clubs in the golden jellyfish from Jellyfish Lake Two species of scyphozoan jellyfish live in Jellyfish Lake, moon jellyfish (Aurelia sp.) and the golden jellyfish (Mastigias sp.).  Golden jellyfish  The golden jellyfish are most closely related to the spotted jellyfish (Mastigias papua) that inhabit the nearby lagoons. They are similar to the spotted jellyfish in that they derive part of their nutrition from symbiotic algae (Zooxanthellae) that live in their tissues and part of their nutrition from captured zooplankton. However, the golden jellyfish are morphologically, physiologically, and behaviourally distinct from the spotted jellyfish. They are easily distinguished from the spotted jellyfish by the almost complete loss of spots on the exumbrella and the almost complete loss of their clubs, an appendage attached to the oral arms. Marine biologist Michael Dawson proposed that the golden jellyfish that inhabit Jellyfish Lake be classified as a subspecies (Mastigias cf. papua etpisoni) of the spotted jellyfish living in the nearby lagoons. The species identification is uncertain (denoted by cf. in the name) because the Mastigias papua local to Palauan lagoons may be only one of several cryptic species that make up the M. papua group, and in the future, the M. papua local to Palau may be identified as a separate species from other M. papua. He also proposed that the jellyfish living in four other Palauan marine lakes were distinctive enough to deserve recognition as unique subspecies.  Moon jellyfish  The moon jellyfish were identified as Aurelia aurita by Hamner. However, since the release of that report in 1981, genetic testing has been done on specimens of Aurelia collected from locations throughout the world. The results of that testing indicate in addition to the three named species of Aurelia there are at least six other cryptic species in the genus. Three of the cryptic species identified were from Palau. One of these cryptic species is common to four of Palau's marine lakes with jellyfish populations including Jellyfish Lake. Hence, the most accurate designation for the moon jellyfish in Jellyfish Lake (as of February 2001) is Aurelia sp. Despite the close proximity of Palau's moon jellyfish cryptic species, Dawson and Jacobs stated that the molecular data suggested that they had not interbred for millions of years.  Quotidian migration = Golden jellyfish  Map of Eil Malk with Jellyfish Lake in the eastern part of the main island The golden jellyfish migration pattern is as follows: * Night - For about 14 hours a day the jellyfish make repeated vertical excursions between the surface and the chemocline in the western basin possibly to acquire nitrogen and other nutrients from near the chemocline for their symbiotic algae. * From early morning to about 0930 - The jellyfish move from center of western basin to the eastern basin * From early afternoon to about 1530 - The jellyfish move from eastern basin to near western end of lake * As the sun sets - The jellyfish move briefly eastward from western end to western basin where they remain through the night The golden jellyfish rotate counter- clockwise as they swim at the surface, presumably to provide even exposure to the sun for the symbiotic algae in their bodies. The Jellyfish Lake golden jellyfish migration pattern is similar to Mastigias sp. in other Palauan marine lakes and coves which all migrate west to east in the morning. However the migration patterns in other Palauan coves and marine lakes are less well defined than that of the Jellyfish Lake golden jellyfish. The east to west migration in all of these other lakes (except for Clear Lake on Eil Malk) does not begin until the late afternoon. Hamner and Dawson proposed that the difference is caused by evolutionary change driven by the jellyfish-eating anemones (Entacmaea medusivora) that inhabit the eastern regions of Jellyfish Lake and Clear Lake. The jellyfish instinctively avoid shadows and in the morning with the shadows on the eastern end the jellyfish also avoid the anemones. By moving east to west in the early afternoon the jellyfish avoid the time of day when the setting sun would eliminate shadows on the lake in the eastern end and thereby avoid the anemones in the afternoon.  Moon jellyfish  The moon jellyfish do not have an organized horizontal migration pattern. At night they migrate to the surface presumably to feed. The copepods that make up a significant portion of the moon jellyfish diet in Jellyfish Lake also migrate to the surface at night.  Jellyfish die-off = Golden jellyfish  Beginning in about the fall of 1998, a precipitous decline in the golden jellyfish medusa population was detected in Jellyfish Lake. By December 1998, the medusa population had declined to zero. Based on their extensive investigation of the disappearance of the golden jellyfish medusae, Dawson et al. determined that the most likely cause was an El Ni√±o weather event that raised the water temperature, with the result that the symbiotic algae (Zooxanthellae) that live within the golden jellyfish medusae and the syphistomae (scyphozoan polyps) could not survive. In January 2000, the golden jellyfish medusae were observed in Jellyfish Lake for the first time since April 1999. By May 2012, the medusae population had returned to pre-decline levels. Dawson et al. also surveyed the golden jellyfish populations in three other Palauan marine lakes. They found significant changes in the medusa population in two of these lakes, Clear Lake on Eil Malk and Goby Lake on Koror. The golden jellyfish population in Big Jellyfish Lake, Koror did not seem to be affected. The reason for this was not clear, but Big Jellyfish Lake experienced lower temperature increases than the other lakes and there was experimental evidence that the golden jellyfish medusa from Big Jellyfish Lake were more tolerant of higher temperatures. Although Clear Lake did not seem to have experienced the complete medusa population die-off that Jellyfish Lake did in 1998, the golden jellyfish medusae in Clear Lake are not always present. When conditions are not favorable for the short lived medusa stage or for syphistomae strobilation, the medusae disappear in Clear Lake. The medusa population is reestablished by syphistomae strobilation when conditions are favorable for strobilation and medusae again. A significant reduction in the Jellyfish Lake medusa population had also been noted in 1987. This was previously attributed to turbulence generated by scuba diving that caused disturbance of the toxic layer. However, given that it occurred within the time frame when an unusually high sea surface temperature had been detected, it might reasonably be surmised that a rise in water temperature was the most likely cause of the 1998 die-off.  Moon jellyfish  The moon jellyfish exhibited unusual damage in the 1998 time frame; however, the population seemed no smaller than usual.  Tourism  A swimmer snorkeling in Jellyfish Lake. Tourists are required to obtain a pass to access Jellyfish Lake. The Rock Islands/Jellyfish Lake pass is $100 and is valid for 10 days. Snorkeling in Jellyfish Lake is a popular activity for tourists to Palau. Several tour operators in Koror offer trips to the lake. Eil Malk island is approximately a 45-minute boat ride from Koror. The lake is accessed by a short trail from the beach on Eil Malk to the lake. Scuba diving by tourists in the lake is not allowed. Two reasons are put forward for this: * The bubbles from scuba tanks can harm the jellyfish if they collect beneath their bell. * The anoxic layer that begins at about 15 meters contains high concentrations of hydrogen sulfide which can be absorbed through the skin of a diver which can lead to death. Jellyfish Lake is currently the only one of Palau's marine lakes open to tourists.Urbina, Ian. \\"In Palau, Taking the Bait to Swim With Jellyfish.\\" www.nytimes.com. The New York Times. Retrieved 20 January, 2016  Safety considerations  Although both species of jellyfish living in the lake have stinging cells (nematocytes), they are not in general powerful enough to cause harm to humans. It has been reported that it is possible to notice the stings on sensitive areas like the area around the mouth. Saltwater crocodiles are native to Palau but there has only been one death attributed to them in recent times and they are generally not considered a threat to divers. The hydrogen sulfide in the anoxic layer is a serious risk to scuba divers entering this layer. The gas can be absorbed through the skin. In 1977, the maximum safe threshold level for hydrogen sulfide was set at 10 ppm. The concentrations exceed that by eightfold at the bottom of the anoxic layer. However, the hydrogen sulfide concentration down to the chemocline at about is reported to be zero, and if the anoxic layer is avoided, the hydrogen sulfide in the lake does not pose a risk for snorkelers.

Cricket Principally played as a wicketkeeper, \\"Barlow\\" Carkeek was also a stolid, defensive left-hand batsman. He played for Victoria for 10 years from 1903 to 1914, and was rated as steady rather than spectacular. He toured England in 1909 as the second wicketkeeper to Sammy Carter and returned in 1912 as first choice on the tour that was blighted by the dispute between Australia's leading Test players and the Australian Board of Control and the consequent unavailability of many players. It was on this tour that he played his six Test matches, three each against England and South Africa in the Triangular Tournament. He scored only 16 runs and took just six catches. Australian rules football A blacksmith by trade, Carkeek also played 26 top-class Australian rules football games, kicking 8 goals, for Essendon in the Victorian Football League (VFL) from 1903‚Äì1905. He also played for Richmond in the Victorian Football Association (VFA) before and after his stint with Essendon. He left Essendon after the fourth home-and-away match of the 1905 VFL season; he returned to Richmond, and played in the 1905 Richmond winning VFA Grand Final Team.He was also a regular member of the Richmond Team that won the VFA Premiership in 1902; however, in 1902, the premiership was simply awarded to the team at the top of the ladder at the end of the season ‚Äî thus, no \\"Grand Final\\" match was played in 1902.

He played first-class cricket for New South Wales from 1908 to 1912. Life and career Sid Emery, nicknamed \\"Mad Mick\\" by his teammates, was an unusually fast leg-spin and googly bowler who spun the ball prodigiously, making his bowling erratic and unpredictable.The Oxford Companion to Australian Cricket, Oxford, Melbourne, 1996, p. 162. In 1909-10 he opened the bowling for New South Wales and took 7 for 28 and 5 for 85 against Victoria in the Sheffield Shield. He toured New Zealand with the Australian side later that season, playing in all six first- class matches, including two against New Zealand, and taking 22 wickets at an average of 16.13. He was also a hard-hitting lower-order batsman who scored 58 not out in an hour and then in the second innings 80 not out in 46 minutes for New South Wales against the touring South Africans in 1910‚Äì11. When several of Australia's leading players refused to go on the tour of England in 1912, Emery was one of those chosen to replace them. In his first match on the tour, against Northamptonshire, he opened the bowling and took 5 for 52 and 7 for 58. A week later, against Surrey, he took 6 for 54 and 5 for 81. Australia won both matches easily. He played in two Tests against England and two against South Africa during the tour, but with little success, and finished the tour with 67 first-class wickets at an average of 23.89.Jack Pollard, Australian Cricket: The Game and the Players, Hodder & Stoughton, Sydney, 1982, p. 337. An English journalist described his bowling as \\"puzzling\\" and \\"weird\\", noting that his full toss was one of his most dangerous deliveries because the amount of spin he imparted to the ball made its trajectory difficult for the batsman to read. Emery was also a member of the Australian team that toured North America between May and September 1913. He played no further first-class cricket after the tour. The Australian Test leg-spin bowler Arthur Mailey considered Emery one of the best natural spin bowlers he had seen, and described him as \\"a wild relentless fellow with the strength of Hercules\\". He added: \\"When Alf Noble told him he would be a great bowler if he could control his 'googly', Emery answered, 'I'd be a great man if I could control myself.'\\"Arthur Mailey, 10 for 66 and All That, Phoenix, London, 1958, pp. 107, 111. The English Test batsman C. B. Fry described Emery as the world's \\"best-worst\\" bowler. A. G. Moyes wrote that \\"Emery on his day was a devastating bowler. He bowled his bosies faster than any other man I have seen, and when he found his length was as close to unplayable as any bowler within memory, but the trouble was that he did not find it, or keep it, often enough.\\"A. G. Moyes, Australian Cricket: A History, Angus & Robertson, Sydney, 1959, p. 322. Emery worked for the Sydney Tramways, retiring in April 1950 owing to failing eyesight.

The BBC chose Wijemanne to occupy a seat assigned to a Commonwealth broadcasters at the Coronation of Queen Elizabeth on 2 June 1953 at Westminster Abbey. Wijemanne was invited by the British Council to reply to the toast of the Commonwealth proposed by the Chancellor of the Exchequer Mr Richard Mauldling at the Coronation Civic dinner at North Garnet. Director Commercial Service of Radio Ceylon In 1955 the Government of Ceylon made Livy Wijemanne the Assistant Director of the Commercial Service of Radio Ceylon, he became the first Ceylonese Director of Radio Ceylon in 1956, succeeding Clifford R. Dodd. Wijemanne worked very closely with the Australian administrator, Clifford Dodd who came to Radio Ceylon under the Colombo Plan. Dodd changed the face of the Commercial Service of Radio Ceylon turning it into an international brand - he was ably supported by Livy Wijemanne who recruited some of Ceylon's best talents - they were trained by Dodd and Wijemanne and were Ceylon's pioneering professional broadcasters. Millions of listeners tuned into Radio Ceylon. The station was the most popular radio station in South Asia in the 1950s and 1960s. Radio Ceylon ruled the airwaves in South Asia, the station was by far the most popular brand name in the Asian region and people listened to Radio Ceylon from Pakistan to Burma - sometimes the station was picked up by listeners as far as the United States of America. Sri Lanka Broadcasting Corporation In January 1984 Livy was appointed Chairman of the Sri Lanka Broadcasting Corporation. Livy Wijemanne died in Colombo on Sunday 24 November 2002 aged 85 years.

She was featured regularly on Dutch television where she hosted several shows. Millecam also appeared in several Dutch movies and released two albums. Her death of breast cancer in 2001 caused nationwide controversy as she had refused treatment that could possibly have saved her life. In doing so, she was advised by Dutch healing medium Jomanda. Biography Millecam was born in The Hague and later moved to Boxmeer. She received her professional training at the Maastricht Academy of Dramatic Arts. Millecam became famous after appearing in popular television shows like Ook Dat Nog (based on the BBC program That's Life!) and Buitenlandse Zaken, a political satire. She was named \\"most popular Dutch television personality\\" by Dutch broadcasting company TROS, beating popular star Linda de Mol twice in a row. In 1994 she had her own show, The Sylvia Millecam Show, and several years later Miss Millecam, both on RTL 4. Millecam posed for Playboy twice, first in 1989 and again in 1994. Illness and death Statue of Sylvia Millecam in Boxmeer. In 1999 Millecam was diagnosed with possible breast cancer. Her condition was confirmed in 2000. Before this, possibly unrelated, Millecam had suffered ruptured breast implants. Although she visited several medical doctors, in the end she decided to forgo regular treatment and instead sought second opinion help from paranormal and alternative healers. One of these was the Dutch medium Jomanda, at the time Holland's most famous New Age guru. Millecam's condition steadily worsened, and she was eventually admitted to Nijmegen University hospital at a time when the tumor had grown beyond medical treatment. Two days later she died in hospital, after receiving the last rites. On 19 June 2007, three physicians who had advised alternative therapy to Millecam, were prohibited from working as physicians, two of them permanently, the other for one year.

It has an enrollment of approximately 1,000 full and part-time students including both traditional and non-traditional students.http://www.hn.psu.edu/Information/quickfacts.htm History Penn State Hazleton's origins trace back to 1934 during the depths of the Great Depression. Since this was a time when many people could not afford to go to college, the college came to the people. At the request of Hazleton's community leaders, a community survey was completed by the Pennsylvania State College's extension services to determine the actual extent of the need and community support for a center. Hazleton was one of 14 communities to request a center, and only four requests were fulfilled. In September 1934, the Hazleton Undergraduate Center opened with 47 full-time and 60 part-time evening students. The freshman and sophomore students began their studies in Hazleton and completed their degree at Penn State's University Park campus in State College or another institution. Over the next several years, the center was housed in various locations‚Äîfirst in the upper floors of the Markle Bank Building on Broad and Wyoming Streets, then in the former Broad Street School. To accommodate the influx of men and women returning from service in World War II, additional space was leased in the A.D. Thomas Elementary School and the former Walnut Street School. A permanent home came in December 1948 when the college purchased in Sugarloaf Township which, for nearly 25 years, had served as the residential estate of local coal baron Eckley B. Markle. Known as ‚ÄúHighacres,‚Äù the site consisted of four buildings that gave the college the space it so desperately needed. The estate, built by Alvan Markle Sr., featured a 32-room fieldstone mansion with every modern convenience available at the time, as well as domestic staff quarters, a greenhouse, and five formal gardens. Markle‚Äôs mansion quickly became the administration building and, at various times during its life, has housed offices, classrooms, the library, health services, a kitchen, and a dining room. The domestic staff's quarters were transformed into the library, dormitory and infirmary. The greenhouse became the botany laboratory, and a new building, known today as Laurel Cottage, served as the chemistry laboratory.http://www.psu.edu/ur/archives/intercom_2002/Jan17/hazleton.html Over the years, many new facilities were added to Penn State Hazleton. Today, the administration building is the most recognized Penn State Hazleton structure, serving as one of the symbols of the campus. Recently, the island in the semi-circular driveway became the home to another Penn State icon - the Nittany Lion statue, a three-fourth‚Äôs scale replica of the original at University Park. Through gifts and purchases, Penn State Hazleton now consists of of land, with the historic structures standing side-by-side with new and modern academic buildings, a manicured garden, a scenic overlook/picnic area, and a number of nature trails.http://www.hn.psu.edu/Information/about.htm?cn711 Athletics Penn State‚ÄìHazleton teams participate as a member of the United States Collegiate Athletic Association (USCAA).

After Charles Lindbergh's crossing of the Atlantic Ocean, aviation became the focus of several comic strips. Tailspin Tommy (debuting in 1928) was the first, but it was soon followed by others, including Skyroads.Skyroads at Don Markstein's Toonopedia Archived from the original on June 4, 2017.18 months of Sky Roads strips Skyroads was created by aviation pioneer Lester J. Maitland and Lt. Dick Calkins, an ex-Army Air Service pilot who was already drawing the Buck Rogers comic strip. Like Buck Rogers, it was syndicated by the John F. Dille Co. (later known as the National Newspaper Syndicate). Maitland and Calkins continued to collaborate on Skyroads until 1933, when Calkins' assistant, Russell Keaton, took over the writing and artwork. Keaton remained until 1939, when it was taken over by Leonard Dworkins (using the pseudonym \\"Leon Gordon\\"). Characters and story Unlike other serialized comic strips, Skyroads did not have a single focal character over the course of its printing run. Instead, it focused on aviation as a whole, telling different stories with a different set of characters every few years. Three distinctive periods appeared over the publication history of Skyroads, each with its own defined set of characters. The first featured were Ace Ames and Buster Evans who owned and operated the Skyroads Unlimited transport company. This duo was followed by Hurricane Hawk and then Speed McCloud. Clipper Williams, a member of the Flying Legion, soared into air adventures with his kid sidekick, Tommy. Eventually, the Flying Legion became the focus instead of Clipper Williams, a plot situation that remained until the series concluded in 1942. Radio and books Pin promoting both comic strip and newspaper. On February 13, 1939, the Mutual Broadcasting System began a radio adaptation of Skyroads that ran four months and came to a conclusion on May 19. Two Better Little Books were published (1936, 1939) with the Skyroads characters. A brief return occurred in the 1960s with reprints in a saddle-stitched magazine format by publisher Edwin Aprill. However, only one volume was published by Aprill.

Kundt's tube is an experimental acoustical apparatus invented in 1866 by German physicist August Kundt for the measurement of the speed of sound in a gas or a solid rod. The experiment is still taught today due to its ability to demonstrate longitudinal waves in a gas (which can often be difficult to visualise). It is used today only for demonstrating standing waves and acoustical forces. How it works The tube is a transparent horizontal pipe which contains a small amount of a fine powder such as cork dust, talc or Lycopodium. At one end of the tube is a source of sound at a single frequency (a pure tone). Kundt used a metal rod resonator that he caused to vibrate or 'ring' by rubbing it, but modern demonstrations usually use a loudspeaker attached to a signal generator producing a sine wave. The other end of the tube is blocked by a movable piston which can be used to adjust the length of the tube. The sound generator is turned on and the piston is adjusted until the sound from the tube suddenly gets much louder. This indicates that the tube is at resonance. This means the length of the round- trip path of the sound waves, from one end of the tube to the other and back again, is a multiple of the wavelength Œª of the sound waves. Therefore, the length of the tube is a multiple of half a wavelength. At this point the sound waves in the tube are in the form of standing waves, and the amplitude of vibrations of air are zero at equally spaced intervals along the tube, called the nodes. The powder is caught up in the moving air and settles in little piles or lines at these nodes, because the air is still and quiet there. The distance between the piles is one half wavelength Œª/2 of the sound. By measuring the distance between the piles, the wavelength Œª of the sound in air can be found. If the frequency f of the sound is known, multiplying it by the wavelength gives the speed of sound c in air: :c = \\\\lambda f \\\\, The detailed motion of the powder is actually due to an effect called acoustic streaming caused by the interaction of the sound wave with the boundary layer of air at the surface of the tube. Further experiments By filling the tube with other gases besides air, and partially evacuating it with a vacuum pump, Kundt was also able to calculate the speed of sound in different gases at different pressures. To create his vibrations, Kundt stopped the other end of the tube with a loose fitting stopper attached to the end of a metal rod projecting into the tube, clamped at its center. When it was rubbed lengthwise with a piece of leather coated with rosin, the rod vibrated longitudinally at its fundamental frequency, giving out a high note. Once the speed of sound in air was known, this allowed Kundt to calculate the speed of sound in the metal of the resonator rod. The length of the rod L was equal to a half wavelength of the sound in metal, and the distance between the piles of powder d was equal to a half wavelength of the sound in air. So the ratio of the two was equal to the ratio of the speed of sound in the two materials: :\\\\frac {c_\\\\text{metal}}{c_\\\\text{air}} = \\\\frac {f \\\\lambda_\\\\text{metal}}{f \\\\lambda_\\\\text{air}} = \\\\frac {\\\\lambda_\\\\text{metal}}{\\\\lambda_\\\\text{air}} = \\\\frac {L}{d}\\\\, Reason for accuracy A modern version of the Kundt's tube experiment, used in a South American university physics class. Instead of a transparent tube with powder in it to reveal the nodes, this uses microphones mounted in the tube. The piston (right center) is moved back and forth. When the microphone's position is at the nodes of the wave the sound pressure goes to zero. The sound power from the microphones is recorded on the chart recorder (center rear). A less accurate method of determining wavelength with a tube, used before Kundt, is simply to measure the length of the tube at resonance, which is approximately equal to a multiple of a half wavelength. The problem with this method is that when a tube of air is driven by a sound source, its length at resonance is not exactly equal to a multiple of the half-wavelength. Because the air at the source end of the tube, next to the speaker's diaphragm, is vibrating, it is not exactly at a node (point of zero amplitude) of the standing wave. The node actually occurs some distance beyond the end of the tube. Kundt's method allowed the actual locations of the nodes to be determined with great accuracy.

Hewitt as a rival to the large American and Swiss watch companies. It failed in 1910. History Until the late 19th century, Prescot had been the centre of the watchmaking trade in England. The workers produced watch parts in small workshops attached to their cottages and were paid by piece work. By 1889 the American System of Watch Manufacturing meant that the Waltham Watch Company and others could produce watches at a much lower price and the town fell into decline. In 1889 a company was formed and eventually a large factory was built to create complete watches under one roof. The products produced had more in common with earlier American designs than traditional English fusee watches. Because of economies of scale the Lancashire Watch Company struggled to compete with the larger American and Swiss factories. It could not make a profit and went bankrupt in 1910. Thomas P Hewitt's watch was sold at Christies Auction in 1995 fetching $215,000, purchased by Robbie Dickson; a well-known historical watch collector.

From April 1971 to March 1975 she was a founding cast member of Young Talent Time. She started her solo singing career with a cover version of \\"He's a Rebel\\" (March 1974), which peaked at No. 25 on the Go-Set Australian Singles chart. At the Logie Awards of 1974 she won Best Teenage Personality and followed with the Queen of Pop Award in October ‚Äì both ceremonies were sponsored by TV Week. She repeated both wins in the following year. As an actress Byrne appeared in the Australian musical theatre versions of Cats (July 1985 to mid-1987), Les Mis√©rables (November 1987 to May 1988, December 1989 to June 1990) and Sunset Boulevard (October 1996 to June 1997). Her solo album, Caught in the Act (April 1991), peaked at No. 2 on the ARIA Albums Chart and was certified gold. In 2006 Byrne published her autobiography, Not Quite Ripe: A Memoir. Career=Early career as pop singer In 1969 Debra \\"Debbie\\" Byrne made her television debut on Brian and the Juniors, a children's variety and talent quest, which was hosted by Brian Naylor. She stayed with the show for 12 months until it finished late in 1970. In April 1971 she became an original cast member on Young Talent Time, another children's talent quest, which was hosted by Johnny Young. Byrne proved to be a popular cast member: in March 1974 she won the Logie Award for Best Teenage Personality and the TV Week Queen of Pop Award in October. In March 1974, before leaving the Young Talent Time regular cast, Byrne released her first solo single, \\"He's a Rebel\\", a cover version of the Phil Spector-produced 1962 hit by the Crystals. It peaked at No. 25 on the Go-Set Top 40 Australian Singles chart, and reached No. 1 on the Melbourne charts. Her debut album, She's a Rebel (1974), was produced by Young, with session musicians including Russell Dunlop on drums (ex-Aesops Fables, SCRA, Ren√©e Geyer and Mother Earth, Johnny Rocco Band), Tim Partridge on bass guitar (Company Caine, Mighty Kong, Kevin Borich Express), Mark Punch on guitar (Johnny Rocco Band, Ren√©e Geyer Band) and Terry Walker on guitar and backing vocals (the Strangers, Pastoral Symphony). Byrne's follow-up single was a second Crystals cover, \\"Da Doo Ron Ron\\" (January 1975), backed by the track, \\"Boogie Man\\". In that year she won both the Logie Award for Best Teenage Personality and the TV Week Queen of Pop Award for a second time. In September 1975 Byrne travelled to London to record at Abbey Road Studios with Cliff Richard producing. While in London, she made public and TV appearances, including on The Cliff Richard Show. Byrne's first Australian television guest appearance as a featured solo artist was on The Graham Kennedy Show at the age of fifteen. Since then she has made a guest appearance on every major Australian Tonight show and was a regular performer on the Australian Broadcasting Corporation (ABC) series, The Saturday Show. In 1978 she merged singing with acting for the first time on the ABC's Follies series. From August 1980 Byrne co-starred alongside John Farnham in their own series, Farnham and Byrne. Craig Walsh of The Australian Women's Weekly previewed a segment for a rock 'n' roll themed episode, \\"[its] staging promises to make the series the smash hit of 1980, say the producers\\" with Byrne declaring \\"I've just discovered I can dance better than I thought.\\" Cornerstone In late 2018, Byrne announced and debuted her new band Cornerstone with Dion Hirini (guitar), Chris Paraha (bass), Vashti Sevill (keyboard), and Nick Karasavvidis (drums). Career stall and come-back in leading roles  Byrne's career stalled between 1980 and 1985 due to her heroin addiction, for which she undertook rehab at Odyssey House. A further stumbling block occurred when a sex tape of her and a former partner was stolen and leaked to the media. In mid-1985, Byrne recorded her second solo album, The Persuader, which was produced by Peter Dawkins. She issued the single \\"The Persuader\\" in August, but neither single or album charted.. She made a successful and highly publicised career comeback in 1985 with the starring role as Kathy McLeod, opposite Matt Dillon, in the feature film, Rebel. She was nominated for an AFI Award for Best Actress in a Lead Role for the performance. Byrne sang lead vocals on nine of ten tracks on Rebel: Original Motion Picture Soundtrack (1985). Theatre roles From July 1985 to mid-1987 she portrayed Grizabella in the original Australian musical theatre production of Cats, initially at Sydney's Theatre Royal. In July 1987 she featured in Jerry's Girls in Sydney and then Melbourne, in October. She took the role of Fantine in the original Australian cast of Les Mis√©rables from November in that year. She reprised that role on a various artists' album, The Complete Symphonic Recording of Les Mis√©rables (1988), which featured the best performers from worldwide productions. The album won a Grammy Award for Best Musical Theater Album. She also recorded a little-known ecological song, \\"Nature's Lament\\", with the Australian cast of Les Mis√©rables. On 25 January 1988 Byrne performed at the Sydney Entertainment Centre in the Royal Bicentennial Concert for the Prince and Princess of Wales. Byrne was also portraying Fantine that evening at the Theatre Royal: she was required to \\"dash between her dying and ghost scenes of Les Mis√©rables to sing a finale anthem\\" at the Australian Bicentenary celebration. Her backing group for the concert comprised 1500 children. In December 1989 Les Mis√©rables, with Byrne continuing her role as Fantine, began its run at Princess Theatre in Melbourne. Byrne released her third solo album, Caught in the Act, in April 1991, which peaked at No. 2 on the ARIA Albums Chart and was certified gold. It is a \\"collection of show tunes\\" including, \\"I Dreamed a Dream\\" and \\"Memory\\". At the ARIA Music Awards of 1992 it was nominated for Best Adult Contemporary Album. In April 1994 she released her next contemporary album, Sleeping Child, for which she co-wrote tracks with Pete Bowman, Paul Kelly, Paul Norton and Tom Kimmel; she also co-produced the album with Mark Moffatt. Session musicians were Moffatt, Jack Jones (of Southern Sons) and Mark Punch (Ren√©e Geyer Band) on guitars; Joe Creighton (The Revelators) on bass guitar and Alex Pertout on percussion. It includes songs about her children, relationships, sexual abuse, substance dependence, loss and grief. During mid-1995 Byrne starred in the role of April in Hot Shoe Shuffle for the Auckland and Sydney seasons. When the original leading lady, Rhonda Burchmore, left to have a baby, Byrne was asked to fill-in by the choreographer-director, David Atkins. However, she \\"could not tap, and she had to learn for the show after previously only doing selected steps in the musical Jerry's Girls and Atkins's last show, Dancing Dynamite.\\" From October 1996 she played Norma Desmond, opposite Hugh Jackman as Joe Gillis, in the first Australian production of Sunset Boulevard. The show \\"was struck by a number of setbacks even before opening night.\\" Byrne had suffered back problems, \\"it seemed the show would be cancelled.\\" Brian Stacey, the musical director and arranger, was killed in a hit-and-run accident on the eve of its opening night. The show's Melbourne run finished in June 1997. In May 1997 Byrne released her fifth studio album, New Ways to Dream. Andrew Gans of Playbill opined that \\"it is a wonderful recording. Byrne has a throbbing voice that is one of the most emotional sounds you'll encounter. To me, the late Nancy LaMott's voice always sounded full of 'warmth'; similarly Byrne's voice sounds full of warmth plus a life of 'battles won and lost.'\\" She performed a duet with Jackman on a medley of Stephen Sondheim's \\"No One Is Alone\\" and \\"Children Will Listen\\" from his musical play, Into the Woods. Gans felt the duet was \\"another highlight\\" as \\"the two create a moving, mini-drama.\\" In mid 2019, she played Beggar Woman in Sweeney Todd: The Demon Barber of Fleet Street opposite Anthony Warlow and Gina Riley. Television roles Byrne has appeared on television dramas: The Flying Doctors (as Anthea Griffin, 1991), Police Rescue (as Maria Mellick in 1991, as Tricia Mellick in 1992), Home and Away (44 episodes as Julia Bowman, 1992), Law of the Land (as Jen Jardine, 1993), State Coroner (as Tracy Dabovich, 1998) and The Secret Life of Us (four episodes as Peta, 2002). Cabaret and concert performances Byrne's live cabaret, Caught in the Act Again, commenced during mid-1999, it included both show tunes and some original material. The first half was \\"a little too low- key, mostly because the songs all have a similar, slow, acid-jazzy tempo\\" according to Fiona Scott-Norman of The Age. She was backed by John McAll on piano and Don Hirini as backing vocalist; she also co-wrote some material, including \\"I Don't Make the Rules\\", with Hirini. Caught in the Act Again earned a Green Room Award nomination for Best Cabaret Performance and Best Musical Arrangement. Her cabaret work includes writing, directing, choreographing and starring in Girls, Girls, Girls from May to June 2002. The show also starred Wendy Stapleton and Lisa Edwards (replaced by Nikki Nicholls) as a tribute to the Supremes, Cilla Black, Dusty Springfield, Patsy Cline and Lulu. In 2002 it won the Herald Sun Best Cabaret Award. The shows had sold out before they opened. In subsequent years Byrne, Stapleton and Nicholls periodically resumed Girls, Girls, Girls. Since 1972 Byrne has been a regular performer at the Christmas Eve Carols by Candlelight concert at Melbourne's Sidney Myer Music Bowl. At the 2005 concert she performed a duet of Silent Night with her five-year-old daughter, Lucille, who was making her professional stage and television debut. In late 2006 her autobiography, Not Quite Ripe: A Memoir, was published on Pan Macmillan. She described how the book took her four years to write, \\"On and off. I wrote and I didn't write.\\" Byrne reprised her role of Grizabella in the ExitLeft production of Cats, which was staged at the Derwent Entertainment Centre in Hobart in late-October 2007. 2009‚Äìpresent: stage and television roles In April 2009 Byrne played the role of Sue Barnes in Metro Street at its world premiere in Adelaide and its subsequent tour to South Korea, with an appearance at the Daegu International Musical Festival (see Daegu) in June. From 29 July 2010 to April 2011 she played the role of the Bird Woman in the original Australian production of the stage musical, Mary Poppins at Melbourne's Her Majesty's Theatre. She reprised the role in its Sydney run at the Capitol Theatre. From May to June 2012 Byrne played the role of Claire Christie in the Nine Network's Tricky Business. From February to March 2014 she appeared on a dramatised crime biography, Fat Tony & Co., portraying Judy Moran, wife of Lewis Moran who was part of the Carlton Crew which were involved in the Melbourne gangland killings. Fat Tony & Co. focused on the rise and fall of convicted drug mastermind, Tony Mokbel, and is an offshoot to the first series of Underbelly (February‚ÄìMay 2008). Byrne described her portrayal of Moran \\"You'd be surprised what I wear as Judy that's from my own wardrobe [...] There's a definite air of the theatrical about her and a lot of what I saw Judy wearing ... I thought she wore some really nice clothes. Everything she wore was so over the top.\\" In 2016 she took the role of Carlotta Campion in a concert version of Follies at the Melbourne Recital Hall for a limited run of three performances in May. In August she worked with Vika Bull in their Carole King tribute show, Tapestry. In late 2016, Byrne appeared on the third series of ABC comedy, Upper Middle Bogan. From 2017 through to 2019, she toured with Vika Bull in their Carole King tribute show 'Tapestry'. In mid 2019, she is set to play the Beggar Woman in a production of Sweeney Todd: The Demon Barber of Fleet Street opposite Anthony Warlow and Gina Riley. Personal life Debra Ann Byrne was born on 30 March 1957 in Fitzroy to Norman Owen Byrne (born ca. 19282014) and Verna Alice n√©e Reid (ca. 19301980). She was the fifth of six children, her siblings are Lynda, Cheryl, Sandra (ca. 19511970), Peter and Robyn. Norman worked as an engineering foreman; he became violent when drunk. According to Byrne she was sexually abused by her maternal grandfather, Ken Reid, from a young age until 13. In 1993 Byrne dropped the usage of \\"Debbie\\" as her first name. During her stint in Young Talent Time Byrne had a sexual relationship with \\"Michael\\", an on-set boom-camera operator: she was under-age and he was more than ten years older. She later recalled, \\"I didn't feel protected at all. The attitude was, 'It's over now, it's finished', but this was personal and embarrassing and humiliating and distressing ... Parents need to be aware that even now, with the best protections in place, there's going to be someone who cares more for the product than the child. No law can change that.\\" In February 1975 she was hospitalised due to \\"a nervous collapse brought on by a strenuous touring campaign.\\" Her support slot on a tour for United States singer, Gene Pitney, was taken up by Samantha Sang. Byrne described how \\"I was drinking, smoking, barely eating, and spending a lot of time in hotel rooms fighting anxiety and depression.\\" By October 1978 Byrne was married to David John Dudley (born ca. 1956) and the couple lived in Elwood. In that month the pair were cleared of drugs charges; Byrne declared that \\"she knew of some entertainers who had 'come to grief' by being associated with drugs. She had been to one or two parties where drugs were being used but she did not mix with that section of the entertainment industry.\\" Later she recalled meeting Dudley at a party where her \\"latest boyfriend was an everyday dope smoker and I loved the freedom the drug gave me.\\" They had a daughter together, Arja. Her marriage to Dudley broke-up in 1980 and her mother died in that year. Debra gave birth to her second daughter, Lauren, who was fathered by director Chris Webb. During 1987 while rehearsing for her role of Fantine in the Australian theatre production of Les Mis√©rables, Byrne met fellow actor, Neil Melville. By June 1989 the couple were planning their wedding. Byrne and Melville separated in November 1996 and later divorced. Byrne's performances as Norma Desmond on Sunset Boulevard from October 1996 to June 1997 were interrupted by \\"her frequent and sudden absences from the show [which] were partially blamed for the show's lack of success\\" despite \\"great critical notices.\\" She had attempted suicide late in 1997 and was being treated by a psychiatrist to feel \\"more focused and driven than ever before.\\" She was diagnosed with clinical depression and undertook a course of prescription medication. In March 1998 she told Peter Ford of Playbill that \\"Nobody ever bothered to investigate if that was my major problem, when finally I had a label for my troubles it was a great relief.\\" Byrne was the domestic partner of French musician, Ced Le Meledo, with whom she collaborated on the live show, Paris-Melbourne. They had one daughter together, Lucille Le Meledo (b. 12 July 2000). The couple separated in 2006. Her daughter eventually made her theatrical debut in 2011 as the title role in Annie. In that same year her autobiography, Not Quite Ripe: A Memoir, was released and described by her publisher as \\"the real story of her gritty, sometimes perilous existence as she chased her career, became addicted to heroin and finally rehabilitated herself\\". As of 2019, she lives in Melbourne with her daughter Lucille and two of her grandchildren.

The son of a Methodist minister, he played cricket for Australia and also Australian rules football in the Victorian Football League (VFL). He was educated at Wesley College, Melbourne. Park also served in the Australian Imperial Force in World War I. Football career Park started his senior VFL career at University, making his debut in 1912. He had an immediate impact as the club's leading goal kicker with 22. Park's 53 goals in the 1913 VFL season was bettered only by Fitzroy's Jimmy Freake with 56. ::Little interest was manifested in the meeting of Richmond and University at Richmond [Cricket Ground on 13 August 1913], the local men displaying more knowledge and better tactics than the students, and winning handsomely. The real concern in the game centred in the doings of Roy Park, the students' goal sneak, a great favourite on all grounds. Notwithstanding that his side has not won a game, Park's success has been phenomenal, his judgment standing out among his comrades' like an oasis in a desert. After the match the opposition supporters, who were carried away by the boy's marvellous accuracy [in kicking five goals], rushed the ground and carried him in shoulder high ‚Äî a unique tribute in these degenerate days. ‚Äî The Australasian, 6 September 1913.A Popular Goal-Kicker, The Australasian, (Saturday, 6 September 1913), p.25. Park had medical studying commitments at Melbourne University in 1914, leaving him free for few games, but still managed to kick 36 goals for the season that was University's last in the VFL competition. In 1915 Park played with VFL club Melbourne, where he kicked 35 goals in 13 games, but was suspended for four matches for striking Gerry Balme of St Kilda, despite three witnesses coming forward to say that Park had not hit the player at all. Park refused to play football again after his suspension, ending his VFL career with 146 goals in 57 matches. However, following the end of the war, Park returned to football, playing with Footscray Football Club‚Äîhe was conducting his medical practice in Footscray at the time‚Äîwho were then a member of the Victorian Football Association (VFA).Atkinson, p. 39. In the 1920 VFA second semi-final, Park won the match for Footscray against North Melbourne Football Club with a dramatic kick that dribbled through for a goal with less than ten seconds left on the clock.Atkinson, p. 40. World War I A registered medical practitioner, Park enrolled in the Australian Army Medical Corps of the Australian Imperial Force on 12 July 1917. Upon enrolling, Park was given the rank of captain and left Australia on 4 August 1917 aboard the HMAT Themistocles. He served with the 5th Field Ambulance Unit and was mentioned in dispatches in the London Gazette on 11 July 1919 and in the Commonwealth of Australia Gazette on 30 October 1919. Park returned safely to Australia on 2 June 1919 after the conclusion of World War I. Cricket career Park was a cricket prodigy at Wesley College. His schoolmate Robert Menzies, future Prime Minister of Australia, recalled reading Shakespeare behind the school practice nets, \\"so that he could partake of the bard whilst watching Park bat.\\"Haigh. Park played for South Melbourne Cricket Club in the Victorian Cricket Association (VCA), and starred as a right-handed opening batsman, including a 315-run opening partnership with future Australian Test captain Bill Woodfull, for many years a club record.The Argus, \\"Club honours Dr Roy Park\\", 9 March 1953, p. 12. He became the youngest man to lead the batting averages for Melbourne Cricket Club. He was chosen as part of Warwick Armstrong's 1914/15 Australian team for a stillborn tour of South Africa: > At Melbourne, Park had been one of the youngsters sent to the \\"special net\\" > for Armstrong's attention. Armstrong had been impressed, Park awestruck, > later crediting Armstrong with \\"most of my cricket brains\\". They were an odd > sight in partnership, like a planet and its satellite, but their simpatico > was deep. During the match against South Australia, for example, Park joined > his captain with an hour left of the second day and shared a thunderous > stand. Over lunch on the third day, with Park 226 and himself 101, Armstrong > recalled his own eight-year-old record score for Victoria: \\"Parky, you > haven't far to go to beat my 250. I promise to do my best to stop there > while you make them.\\" Park did not make it, but always remembered the > gesture. Park also notched up some fine performances for Victoria, and soon earned a Test call-up in the 1920‚Äì1921 season. He was unsuccessful in his debut against England at the Melbourne Cricket Ground (MCG), making a first-ball duck in his only innings, and bowling a single over of off-spinners which went for nine runs. He was said to have been called late during the night for medical duties, and not to have got any sleep before his debut. He never played Test cricket again. Legend has it that his wife, who was watching in the stands, dropped a stitch in her knitting as he prepared to face his first ball, bent down to retrieve it at the moment of delivery, and thus missed his entire Test career. At first-class level, he made 2514 runs at an average of just under 40, scoring nine centuries, with a highest score of 228. Following his retirement from cricket, Park held numerous administrative positions, including the South Melbourne delegate to the VCA and Victorian selector. In 1953 a memorial plaque honouring Park was unveiled in South Melbourne by the Mayor of South Melbourne. Park's son-in-law, Ian Johnson, who married his daughter, Lal, was a captain of the Australian cricket team and a member of The Invincibles.

Cricket career A very fast bowler with the ability to cause problems even on docile pitches, Ted McDonald was the unexpected bowling sensation of the 1921 Australian tour to England. He and Jack Gregory caused something approaching panic among the England batsmen: John Evans' knees were allegedly knocking together when he went out to bat, and Andy Ducat was bowled when part of his bat, broken by McDonald's pace, hit the wicket. Where Gregory was able to swing the ball both ways, McDonald imparted vicious movement off the wicket. Like later fast bowling pairs, they were devastating in combination, taking 46 wickets in the series. McDonald played a few matches for Victoria before the First World War, but came to prominence immediately after it with eight wickets in an innings in a state match. He was picked for three Test matches in the 1920‚Äì21 series against England, which Australia won 5‚Äì0, but had little success, his six wickets costing 65 runs each. In England the following summer, though, he was an instant success, taking eight wickets in the first Test at Trent Bridge and contributing significantly to the victories at Lord's and Headingley that won the series. McDonald was named as a Wisden Cricketer of the Year in 1922 for his exploits of the previous summer. After the England tour, McDonald played in three Tests against South Africa in the 1921‚Äì22 series in South Africa. Those, however, were his last Tests ‚Äì all of his Test cricket was contained within the calendar year of 1921 ‚Äì as he then took up an engagement as a professional with the Lancashire League club Nelson. By 1924, McDonald had qualified to play for Lancashire, initially, because of his League commitments, in midweek games only. Again, he was a sensation. In his first full season, 1925, he took 205 wickets, and in the five seasons from 1926 to 1930, Lancashire won the County Championship four times, the most successful period in the county's history. In all, he took 1053 wickets for Lancashire. His value to the county was recognised in the award of a benefit in 1929, an unusually fast reward, for he had been playing county cricket for only five seasons. McDonald's first-class career ended fairly suddenly. His form dipped in 1930, though he still took more than 100 wickets, but in 1931, he lost form almost entirely, taking just 26 wickets all season and being left out of the county team for half the matches. At the end of the season, he went back to the Lancashire League with Bacup. Australian rules football McDonald also played Australian rules football for Launceston, and for Essendon Football Club (two matches in 1912) and Fitzroy Football Club (46 matches from 1913 to 1919). Death McDonald died at the age of 46, when his car collided with another near Bolton, England, on the morning of 22 July 1937.Great Bowler Passes: Tragic End of Ted McDonald, The Sporting Globe, (Wednesday, 28 July 1937), p.12.E.A.

Despite his short stage career, lasting from 1919 to 1935, Fleta has been described as one of the most significant Iberian opera singers of the 20th century. Among the important international venues at which he sang were La Scala, Milan, (in 1923-26) and the New York Metropolitan Opera (in 1923-25). Additionally, in 1926, he had the honour of creating the role of Calaf in Puccini's posthumously-premiered final opera, Turandot, at the insistence of La Scala's principal conductor, Arturo Toscanini. But this taxing dramatic role took him to the limit of his resources and he did not attempt it again. Fleta made his operatic debut in Trieste in 1919, having previously studied voice at the Madrid conservatory. Successful engagements in Rome followed, leading to his La Scala and Met debuts. He quit the Met in acrimonious circumstances, however, and the resultant legal action stopped him performing again in the United States. He was celebrated during his best years for the finesse with which he used his rich, flexible voice. The most notable aspect of his performance style was the nimbleness of his bel canto technique. This enabled him to produce spectacular messa di voce and pianissimo effects. Unfortunately, Fleta's singing became increasingly self-indulgent as his career progressed. By the late 1920s, as recordings show, his voice had deteriorated badly, with his vibrato loosening to an undesirable extent. Fleta died in straitened circumstances in 1938. He nonetheless left a legacy of sometimes fascinating records, many of which are available on CD reissues.

Citing: The two types of PEEP are extrinsic PEEP (PEEP applied by a ventilator) and intrinsic PEEP (PEEP caused by an incomplete exhalation). Pressure that is applied or increased during an inspiration is termed pressure support.  Intrinsic PEEP (auto)  Auto (intrinsic) PEEP ‚Äì Incomplete expiration prior to the initiation of the next breath causes progressive air trapping (hyperinflation). This accumulation of air increases alveolar pressure at the end of expiration, which is referred to as auto-PEEP. Auto-PEEP develops commonly in high minute ventilation (hyperventilation), expiratory flow limitation (obstructed airway) and expiratory resistance (narrow airway). Once auto-PEEP is identified, steps should be taken to stop or reduce the pressure build-up. When auto-PEEP persists despite management of its underlying cause, applied PEEP may be helpful if the patient has an expiratory flow limitation (obstruction).  Extrinsic PEEP (applied)  Applied (extrinsic) PEEP is usually one of the first ventilator settings chosen when mechanical ventilation is initiated. It is set directly on the ventilator. A small amount of applied PEEP (4 to 5 cmH2O) is used in most mechanically ventilated patients to mitigate end- expiratory alveolar collapse. A higher level of applied PEEP (>5 cmH2O) is sometimes used to improve hypoxemia or reduce ventilator-associated lung injury in patients with acute lung injury, acute respiratory distress syndrome, or other types of hypoxemic respiratory failure.  Complications and effects  Positive end-expiratory pressure can contribute to: * Decrease in **systemic venous return, cardiac output, cardiac index **pulmonary capillary wedge pressure (PCWP), preload, arterial blood pressure * Increase in: **Intrathoracic pressure, RV afterload (CVP and PAP) **lung functional residual capacity *Pulmonary barotrauma can be caused. Pulmonary barotrauma is lung injury that results from the hyperinflation of alveoli past the rupture point. * The effects of PEEP on intracranial pressure (ICP) have been studied. Although PEEP is hypothesized to increase ICP due to impedance of cerebral blood flow, it has been shown that high PEEP does not increase ICP. *Renal functions and electrolyte imbalances, due to decreased venous return metabolism of certain drugs are altered and acid-base balance is impeded. History John Scott Inkster, an English anaesthetist and physician, is credited with discovering PEEP. When his discovery was published in the proceedings of the World Congress of Anaesthesia in 1968, Inkster called it Residual Positive Pressure.

This Run DMC-branded Adidas running shoe illustrates the increasing market power of rappers, who became a valuable brand. The innovations of Run-D.M.C., LL Cool J, and new school producers such as Larry Smith, and Rick Rubin of Def Jam Recordings, were quickly advanced on by the Beastie Boys, Marley Marl and his Juice Crew MCs, Boogie Down Productions, Public Enemy, and Eric B. & Rakim. Hip hop production became denser, rhymes and beats faster, as the drum machine was augmented with the sampler technology. Rakim took lyrics about the art of rapping to new heights, while KRS-One and Chuck D pushed \\"message rap\\" towards black activism. Native Tongues artists' inclusive, sample-crowded music accompanied their positivity, Afrocentricity and playful energy. During the golden age of hip hop, samples were heavily used. The ability to sample different beats, riffs and patterns from a wide variety of sources gave birth to a new breed of producers and DJs who did not necessarily need formal musical training or instruments, just a good ear for sound collages. These samples were derived from a number of genres, ranging from jazz, funk and soul to rock and roll. For example, Paul's Boutique, the Beastie Boys' second studio album, drew from over 200 individual samples, 24 of which were featured on the last track of the album. Samples and sound bites were not limited to just music. RZA of the Wu-Tang Clan, a hip hop collective formed in the 1990s, sampled sound clips from his own collection of 1970s kung-fu films to bolster and frame the group's gritty lyrical content. Many of the sample-laden albums released during this time would not be able to receive legal clearance today.McLeod, Kembrew & Kuenzli, Rudolf E. \\"Crashing the Spectacle: A Forgotten History of Digital Sampling, Infringement, Copyright Liberation and the End of Recorded Music.‚Äù Culture Machine. The era also provided some of the greatest advances in rapping technique. Kool G Rap, referring to the golden age in the book How to Rap said, \\"that era bred rappers like a Big Daddy Kane, a KRS-One, a Rakim, a Chuck D... their rapping capability and ability ‚Äì these dudes were phenomenal\\".Edwards, Paul, 2009, How to Rap: The Art & Science of the Hip-Hop MC, Dave Shewring, Chicago Review Press, p. vii. Many of hip hop's biggest artists were also at their creative peak. Allmusic said the golden age \\"witnessed the best recordings from some of the biggest rappers in the genre's history... overwhelmingly based in New York City, golden age rap is characterized by skeletal beats, samples cribbed from hard rock or soul tracks, and tough dis raps... rhymers like PE's Chuck D, Big Daddy Kane, KRS- One, Rakim, and LL Cool J basically invented the complex wordplay and lyrical kung-fu of later hip-hop\\". In addition to lyrical self-glorification, hip hop was also used as a form of social protest. Lyrical content from the era often drew attention to a variety of social issues including Afrocentric living, drug use, crime and violence, religion, culture, the state of the American economy, and the modern man's struggle. Conscious and political hip hop tracks of the time were a response to the effects of American capitalism and former President Reagan's conservative political economy. According to Rose Tricia, \\"In rap, relationships between black cultural practice, social and economic conditions, technology, sexual and racial politics, and the institution policing of the popular terrain are complex and in constant motion. Even though hip hop was used as a mechanism for different social issues it was still very complex with issues within the movement itself.Rose, Tricia. Black Black Noise: Rap Music and Black Culture in Contemporary American. Hanover: Wesleyan U, 1994. Print. There was also often an emphasis on black nationalism. Hip hop scholar Michael Eric Dyson stated, \\"during the golden age of hip hop, from 1987 to 1993, Afrocentric and black nationalist rap were prominent\\",Dyson, Michael Eric, 2007, Know What I Mean?, Westview Press, p. 64. and critic Scott Thill described the time as \\"the golden age of hip hop, the late '80s and early '90s when the form most capably fused the militancy of its Black Panther and Watts Prophets forebears with the wide-open cultural experimentalism of De La Soul and others\\".Scott Thill, \\"Whiteness Visible\\" AlterNet, May 6, 2005. Stylistic variety was also prominent; MSNBC said that in the golden age, \\"rappers had an individual sound that was dictated by their region and their communities, not by a marketing strategist,\\" the Village Voice referred to the golden age's \\"eclecticism\\",Mosi Reeves, \\"Easy-Chair Rap\\", Village Voice, January 29th 2002. and Ben Duinker and Denis Martin of Empirical Musicology Review wrote that \\"The constant flow of new, boundary- pushing Golden Age album releases exemplifies this era's unprecedented stylistic fluidity.\\"https://emusicology.org/article/view/5410/4799  Time period  A Tribe Called Quest at a 2009 show. AllMusic writes, \\"Hip-hop's golden age is bookended by the commercial breakthrough of Run‚ÄìD.M.C. in 1986 and the explosion of gangsta rap with NWA in the late 80s and Dr. Dre and Snoop Doggy Dogg in 1993.\\" However, the specific time period that the golden age covers varies among different sources. The New York Times also defines hip-hop's golden age as the \\"late 1980s and early 90s\\".Jon Caramanica, \\"Hip- Hop's Raiders of the Lost Archives\\", New York Times, June 26, 2005 Ed Simmons of The Chemical Brothers said, \\"there was that golden age of hip-hop in the early 90s when the Jungle Brothers made Straight Out the Jungle and De La Soul made Three Feet High and Rising\\"Will Hodgkinson, \\"Adventures on the wheels of steel\\", The Guardian, September 19, 2003. (though these records were in fact made in 1988 and 1989 respectively). MSNBC called the 1980s the \\"Golden Age\\" of hip-hop music. The Guardian states, \\"The golden age of hip-hop, from 1986 to 1993, gave the world an amazing number of great records,\\" and also describes the period in November 1993, when A Tribe Called Quest and Wu-Tang Clan released albums, as \\"The Next Golden age.\\" The golden age is described by scholar Mickey Hess as \\"circa 1986-1994.\\"Hess, Mickey., 2007, Icons of Hip Hop [Two Volumes] [2 volumes]: An Encyclopedia of the Movement, Music, and Culture (Greenwood Icons), Greenwood Publishing Group, p. 341.

Will Lavin of uDiscover Music states \\"It's generally accepted that the Golden Age occurred from the mid '80s and mid '90s; it was then that all the elements of the culture ‚Äì breaking, graffiti art and DJing ‚Äì broke cover to enter the mainstream.\\"https://www.udiscovermusic.com/in-depth-features/hip- hop-heroes-the-golden-age/ Music critic Tony Green, in the book Classic Material, refers to the two-year period 1993‚Äì1994 as \\"a second Golden Age\\" that saw influential, high-quality albums using elements of past classicism ‚Äì drum machines (Roland TR-808), drum samplers (Akai MPC60, E-mu SP-1200), turntable scratches, references to old school hip hop hits, and \\"tongue- twisting triplet verbalisms\\" ‚Äì while making clear that new directions were being taken. Green lists as examples the Wu-Tang Clan's Enter the Wu-Tang (36 Chambers), Nas's Illmatic, De La Soul's 1993 release Buhloone Mindstate, Snoop Doggy Dogg's Doggystyle, A Tribe Called Quest's third album Midnight Marauders and the Outkast debut Southernplayalisticadillacmuzik. Dart Adams of Festival Peak described this \\"2nd Golden Era\\" as spanning 1992 to 1996, and cites the release of Puff Daddy and Mase's \\"Can't Nobody Hold Me Down\\" in 1997 as being the start of mainstream rap's \\"Jiggy Era\\".https://festivalpeak.com/independent-as-fuck-20-essential-underground- hip-hop-releases-from-1997-db1c5206a99e According to copyright, music, and pop culture scholars Kembrew Mcleod and Peter DiCola, the golden age of hip-hop sampling spans from 1987‚Äì1992. Artists and record labels were not yet aware of the permanence of hip-hop culture in mainstream media, and did not yet accept it as a legitimate institution. They believe the ruling made in Grand Upright Music, Ltd. v. Warner Bros. Records Inc. marked the end of the golden age of hip hop and its sampling practices.DiCola, Peter & Mcleod, Kembrew. Creative License: The Law & Culture of Digital Sampling. Duke University Press. 2011. Juice Crew Marley Marl in Nottingham, England in 1999. Notable hip hop producer and innovator, Marley Marl, formed the Juice Crew hip hop collective. Marl also founded Cold Chillin' Records and assembled various hip hop acts, including MC Shan, Big Daddy Kane, Biz Markie, Roxanne Shant√©, Kool G Rap & DJ Polo, and Masta Ace. His Juice Crew collective was an important force in ushering the \\"golden age\\" era of hip hop, with advances in lyrical technique, distinctive personalities of emerging artists like Biz Markie and Big Daddy Kane, and attaining crossover commercial success for hip hop music. Marley Marl's first production was an \\"answer record\\" to \\"Sucker MCs\\" in 1983 entitled \\"Sucker DJs\\" by Dimples D. Soon after came 14-year-old Roxanne Shant√©'s answer to UTFO's \\"Roxanne Roxanne\\", \\"Roxanne's Revenge\\" (1985), sparking off the huge wave of answer records known as the Roxanne Wars. More disses (insults intended to show disrespect) from Shant√© followed: \\"Bite This\\" (1985), \\"Queen of Rox\\" (1985), introducing Biz Markie on \\"Def Fresh Crew\\" (1986), \\"Payback\\" (1987), and \\"Have a Nice Day\\" (1987).Shapiro, p. 196 Boogie Down Productions Shante's \\"Have a Nice Day\\" had aimed some barbs at the principal two members of a new group from the Bronx called Boogie Down Productions (BDP): \\"Now KRS-ONE you should go on vacation with that name soundin' like a wack radio station, and as for Scott La Rock, you should be ashamed, when T La Rock said \\"It's Yours\\", he didn't mean his name\\". Boogie Down Productions had manufactured a disagreement with the Juice Crew's MC Shan, releasing \\"South Bronx\\" and \\"The Bridge is Over\\" in reply to his \\"The Bridge\\" and \\"Kill That Noise\\" respectively.Coleman, p. 84‚Äì85. KRS-One considered Run-D.M.C. the epitome of rap music in 1984 and had begun to rap following their lead.Coleman, p. 76 He has also said that BDP's approach reflected a feeling that the early innovators like Run-D.M.C. and LL Cool J were by 1986 tainted by commercial success and out of touch with the streets.Coleman, p. 86. Boogie Down's first album Criminal Minded (1987) admitted a reggae influence and had KRS-One imitating the Beatles' \\"Hey Jude\\" on the title track. It also contained two tales of grim street life, yet played for callous laughs: \\"The P Is Free\\", in which KRS speaks of throwing out his girl who wants crack cocaine in exchange for sex, and \\"9mm Goes Bang\\", in which he shoots a drug dealer then cheerfully sings \\"la la la la la la\\". Songs like these presaged the rise of an underground that matched violent lyrics to the hardcore drum machine tracks of the new school. The cover of Criminal Minded was a further reflection of a move towards this sort of radical image, depicting the group in a half-light, holding firearms.Coleman, p. 88 The next album By All Means Necessary (1988) left that element behind for political radicalism following the murder of Scott La Rock, with its title and cover alluding to Malcolm X. KRS-One became involved with the Stop the Violence Movement at this time. Boogie Down Productions, along with Run-D.M.C. and Public Enemy, associated the new school as rap music with a strong message.Jackson, Derrick Z. \\"Welcome to the School of Rap Music It's in Session Now, And There Are Some Positive Lessons\\", Boston Globe, August 13, 1989. Eric B. and Rakim Eric B. & Rakim appeared with the Marley Marl produced \\"Eric B. Is President\\" and \\"My Melody\\" on Zakia Records in 1986. Both tracks appeared on Paid in Full (1987). Just as Boogie Down Productions had, the pair reflected changes in street life on their debut's cover, which depicted the two wearing large gold chains and surrounded by money. Like Criminal Minded, the sampling prevalent in the album cemented James Brown's status as a hip hop source, while Rakim's allusions showed the growing influence of mystic Islam-offshoot The Nation of Gods and Earths in hip-hop. The music was minimalist, austerely so, with many writers noting that coupled with Rakim's precise, logical style, the effect was almost one of scientific rigour. The group followed Paid in Full with Follow The Leader (1988) (on which they were open-minded enough to sample The Eagles), Let The Rhythm Hit 'Em (1990) and Don't Sweat The Technique (1992). Rakim is generally regarded as the most cutting-edge of the MCs of the new school era.Neal, Mark Anthony. \\"...And Bless the Mic for the Gods: Rakim Allah\\", PopMatters, November 19, 2003. Retrieved on July 2, 2008. Jess Harvell in Pitchfork in 2005 wrote that \\"Rakim's innovation was applying a patina of intellectual detachment to rap's most sacred cause: talking shit about how you're a better rapper than everyone else.\\" Christgau in the Village Voice in 1990 wrote of Rakim's style as \\"calm, confident, clear. On their third album, as on their phase-shifting 1986 debut,\\" he continues, \\"Eric B.'s samples truly are beats, designed to accentuate the natural music of an idealized black man's voice.\\"Christgau, Robert. Consumer Guide, Village Voice, 1990. Retrieved on July 2, 2008. Looking back at the late eighties in Rolling Stone in 1997, Ed Moralez describes Rakim as \\"the new-school MC of the moment, using a smooth baritone to become the jazz soloist of mystic Afrocentric rap.\\"Morales, Ed. \\"Rakim: The 18th Letter/The Book of Life\\", Rolling Stone, November 10, 1997.

Bum Rush the Show on Def Jam in 1987.Coleman, p. 351 It debuted the Public Enemy logo, a circle of hatted b-boy in a sniper's cross-hairs, was replete with battle rhymes (\\"Miuzi Weighs a Ton\\", \\"Public Enemy #1\\"), social-political fare (\\"Rightstarter (Message to a Black Man)\\" and anti-crack messages (\\"Megablast\\"). The album was a critical and commercial success, particularly in Europe, unusually so for a hip hop album at that time.Coleman, p. 354 Bumrush the Show had been recorded on the heels of Run-D.M.C.'s Raising Hell, but was held back by Def Jam in order for them to concentrate on releasing and promoting the Beastie Boys' License to Ill. Chuck D of Public Enemy felt that by the time their first record was released, Boogie Down Productions and Rakim had already changed the landscape for how an MC could rap. Public Enemy were already recording their second album It Takes a Nation of Millions to Hold Us Back (Def Jam, 1988) when Bumrush hit stores. Gangsta rap The underground sound, centered on urban violence, that was to become gangsta rap, existed on the East Coast soon after Run‚ÄìD.M.C. had inaugurated the new school of hip hop. Philadelphia's Schoolly D self-released \\"Gangsta Boogie\\" in 1984, and \\"P.S.K. What Does It Mean?\\"/\\"Gucci Time\\" in 1985, leading to Saturday Night (Schoolly D, 1986, Jive, 1987).Coleman, p. 406‚Äì407 The West Coast, which became the home of gangsta rap, had Toddy Tee's influential Batteram mixtape in 1985,Cross, p. 26‚Äì28 and Ice-T's \\"Six in the Morning\\" in 1986Cross, p. 24‚Äì5 before N.W.A's first records, leading to the hugely successful Straight Outta Compton in 1988.Cross, p. 33‚Äì36 Native Tongues Developments in the New York new school continuum in this climate were represented by the Native Tongues groups‚ÄîThe Jungle Brothers, De La Soul, A Tribe Called Quest, Queen Latifah, Chi-Ali, and Monie Love‚Äîalong with fellow travellers like Leaders of the New School, KMD and Brand Nubian.Wang, Oliver. \\"Howl\\", LA Weekly, June 28, 2000.

Their music was sample-crowded, more open and accessible than their new school predecessors.

In total, DSU consists of about 500 highly trained police officers. The centralized 50 operator small assault team of the intervention unit of the DSU is deployed in cases of terrorism, kidnappings, hostage taking and other forms of serious crime. DSU performs emergency responses, high-risk arrests and searches, observation operations, undercover operations and more. Chief commissioner Eric Li√©vin, one of the DSU's former commanders, states that \\"a criminal dealing with the DSU, has a better chance of surviving than another; they try to use a minimal level of violence/force, and yet try to attain a maximum level of efficiency.\\" History The original DSU was created within the former Rijkswacht/Gendarmerie in 1972 in the aftermath of the Munich massacre and was called Group Diane. In 1974 the name was changed from Diane to SIE (also outside Belgium, ) or ESI (, also known as ). In 2001, all Belgian police forces (municipal, judicial and Rijkswacht/Gendarmerie) were reformed into the integrated police structured on two levels, the local police and the federal police. The SIE/ESI took the form of the Directorate of special units (DSU), which was part of the newly created federal police. In 2007 the DSU was integrated into the Office of the General Commissioner (CG) and its name was changed to CGSU. Due to an optimization reform within the federal police that started in 2014, the special units were moved from the Office of the General Commissioner to the General directorate of the judicial police (DGJ), one of the three general directorates resorting under the Office of the General Commissioner. This was deemed more logical because of the operational and judicial nature of the assignments of the federal police's special units. Subsequently, the name and abbreviation was changed (back) to \\"Directorate of the special units (DSU)\\". The DSU was deployed to hunt down suspects responsible for bombing the Brussels metro and airport with one suspect apprehended. Its manpower in 2012, consist of 450 police officers and 62 civilians. Organisation The DSU is one of the four central directorates of the General directorate of the judicial police (DGJ), which is responsible for criminal investigations and anti-crime operations. The DSU consists of centralised units and decentralised units. The centralised units are called the \\"special units\\" and consist of: * the Intervention unit * the Observation unit * the Undercover team (UCT) * the National technical support unit (NTSU) These are all stationed in a police caserne in Etterbeek. There are four decentralised units, called \\"Protection, observation, support & arrest platoons\\" (POSA), spread over the country: * POSA Gent * POSA Antwerpen * POSA Charleroi * POSA Li√®ge Overall control of the DSU lies with the Ministry of Internal Affairs, but depending on circumstances the unit can be deployed under operational control of the Ministry of Justice. Prior to 1994 the unit was commanded by the Ministry of Defense. Two more specialised units also exist, one team has six trained police dogs for detecting the presence of explosive materials or ammunition, the other one is the Disaster Victim Identification (DVI) team, which was created in 1978 after the Los Alfaques disaster. They've been involved in the Herald of Free Enterprise disaster, the Buizingen rail disaster in 2010 and a bus accident in 2012 in Switzerland. Tasks DSU provides ongoing support to the federal and local levels in the areas of: * Intervention and arrest (hostage and barricaded suspect situations) * Provision of expertise and advice * Special investigative techniques * Specialized technical support * Support of specialised means (divers, climbers, snipers, maritime operation, etc.) * Support of the European Anti-terrorism organisation 'Atlas' with the possibility of deployment abroad Weapons DSU operators on a parade armed with FN SCARs on a Toyota Land Cruiser assault vehicle.

History  Entrance to Saint George Monastery. It is said that the monastery was built over remains of an ancient statue of the god Homerus by the Byzantine Emperor Justinian I sometime in the 5th century. The monastery occupies a 6,000 m¬≤ land and was built entirely from Byzantine styled stone. The modern church was rebuilt in 1857. Most of the older monastery's items are preserved and displayed in the monastery. Its entrance features a triple arch and two central supporting columns of Byzantine origin. A historical big stone with religious carvings can be found in the monastery's southern gate. The wooden iconostasis found inside the church are decorated with impressive carvings and are magnificent presentations of art, its gold painted icons depict various scenes from the life of Christ. Beneath the monastery's main courtyard there is an older 13th century chapel with a smaller iconostasis, older than 300 years. Its icons depict scenes from the life of Saint George, a popular saint among Middle Eastern Christians. At this lower level there is also an entrance to what is believed to be the original 6th century monastery and several large amphoras. The Saint George Monastery also displays many other ancient items like crosses, writings, books, carvings, goblets, and other tools. It is also home to a manuscript written by the caliph Umar ibn al-Khattab, which discussed the relationships between Muslims and Christians. The monastery is busiest during pilgrimages at the feast of Saint George (May 6) and the feast of the elevation of the Holy Cross on (September 14).

The black-and-white and color drama was shot by Julien Hirsch and Christophe Pollock.. Godard has famously stated that \\"a film should have a beginning, a middle and an end, but not necessarily in that order.\\" This aphorism is illustrated by In Praise of Love (√âloge de l'amour), which reverses the order of past and present. In Praise of Love polarized film critics. While some prominent reviewers were highly negative toward the work, others consider it to be one of the best films of its decade. Plot The first half of the film, shot on black and white film, follows a man named Edgar who is working on an undefined \\"project\\" about what he considers the four stages of love: meeting, physical passion, separation, and reconciliation, involving people at three different stages of life: youth, adulthood, and old age. Edgar keeps flipping through the pages of an empty book, staring intently as if waiting for words to appear. He is unsure whether the project should be a novel, a play, an opera, or a film. In Paris, he interviews potential participants from all walks of life (including those people Victor Hugo dubbed les mis√©rables, whom Edgar considers important to the project), but is continually dissatisfied. The person Edgar really wants is someone he met two years ago, a woman who \\"dared speak her mind.\\" At the urging of his financial backer Mr. Rosenthal, an art dealer whose father once owned a gallery with Edgar's grandfather, Edgar tracks down the woman, named Berthe, where she is working at night cleaning passenger cars at a railroad depot. Berthe remembers Edgar (and marvels at his memory) but emphatically does not want to be involved in his project. She holds down several jobs and also cares for her three-year-old son. Edgar continues to interview people, to his continuing dissatisfaction. He is able to visualize the stages of youth and old age but keeps having trouble with adulthood. Edgar runs into Berthe at a lecture at a Parisian bookstore by expatriate American journalist Mark Hunter about the Kosovo War. Edgar makes it a point to tell Berthe that Hunter is an example of a \\"good American.\\" Afterwards, the two wander the city of signs and monuments, talking through the night and into the next day, eventually stopping at an abandoned Renault plant, where they contemplate the collapse of the workers movement. They part company, and later Berthe speaks with Edgar over the phone; they talk about when they first met and she questions him as to why he has stopped talking about his project. They end the conversation with an air of finality. Edgar visits a homeless shelter and selects a man sleeping in one of the beds. In a tender but brief moment, Edgar directs two young people, to whom he had earlier assigned the roles of Perceval and his love Eglantine, to bathe the man in a shower. Mr. Rosenthal is there to witness the scene, but the status of \\"the project\\" is unclear. In the final scene of the black and white section, Edgar goes to meet a man who has some news for him about Berthe. The second section of the film is shot in video with over-saturated color. An intertitle announces that it is two years earlier. Edgar arrives in Brittany and is met by the same man he has just seen at the end of part one. The man, a minister of culture for the area, is there to take Edgar to meet Jean Lacouture, whom Edgar proceeds to interview about the role of Catholics in the French Resistance, in connection with a cantata he is writing for Simone Weil. This encounter leads Edgar to meet an elderly couple who fought in the Resistance and have been together ever since. The couple is meeting with delegates from the American state department who are helping to broker a deal on behalf of \\"Spielberg Associates.\\" The company wants to purchase the rights to the couple's story for a film written by William Styron and starring Juliette Binoche. The couple's granddaughter, in training to be a lawyer, is attempting to get them out of the contract, as they are afraid they have been shortchanged. The granddaughter is Berthe, and this is when she and Edgar first meet. Berthe attempts to nullify the contract by arguing that the signatories are not members of a defined nation, referring to themselves simply as \\"Americans,\\" when \\"America\\" is a term that encompasses two continents with many countries ‚Äì but it is a futile effort. After spending time with Berthe, Edgar takes the train back to Paris, and reflects on his encounters. When you think of something (\\"de quelque chose\\"), he muses, you are always thinking of something else. If you see a landscape that is new to you, for example, you are comparing it to a landscape you already know. What Edgar cannot know is what awaits him in the future, about which he is informed at the end of the first part of the film ‚Äì that Berthe commits suicide.

Metacritic reported the film had an average score of 62 out of 100, based on 31 reviews. The film critic for The New York Times, A.O. Scott, while praising the film also found its anti-American content polemical. He wrote, \\"In Praise of Love, it must be said, is the most elegant and coherent feature he has made since the mid-1980s. His visual command -- of the velvety shadows of black- and-white 35-millimeter film and the thick, supersaturated tones of digital video -- still has the power to astonish, and his debonair gloom remains seductive. But to continue with the notebook analogy, the decorous prose, graceful penmanship and impressive paper stock cannot disguise the banality of what is written.\\" Film Comment named it one of the top 50 films of the decade (2000s).Staff (2010). \\"Film Comment's End-of-Decade Critics' Poll\\" . Film Comment. Retrieved February 25, 2010. Film critic Charles Taylor criticized Godard for \\"talking about Americans having no stories of their own, no past of their own (he claims we don't even have a name)\\" and questioned \\"How can a man who, along with his colleagues in the French new wave, did more than anyone to alert America to the art of its movies, the art we always took for granted, suddenly turn around and proclaim the whole culture worthless?\\" Film critic Roger Ebert, who gave the film one out of four stars, took issue with scenes in the film in which Godard accuses filmmaker Steven Spielberg of never paying Emilie Schindler for her contributions to his 1993 film Schindler's List, and leaving her impoverished in Argentina. Ebert wrote, \\"One muses: (1) Has Godard, having also used her, sent her any money? (2) Has Godard or any other director living or dead done more than Spielberg, with his Holocaust Project, to honor and preserve the memories of the survivors?\\" The claim that Emilie Schindler was living in poverty was also disputed by Thomas Keneally, author of Schindler's Ark, who verified that he had sent her a check himself. Richard Brody of The New Yorker declared In Praise of Love the greatest film of the 2000s, stating that it is \\"one of the most unusual, tremulous, and understated of love stories, as well as the story of love itself; ... Godard‚Äôs third first film, thus something of a rebirth of cinema.\\" Japanese film critic Shigehiko Hasumi also listed the film as one of the best of the decade, and it was voted one of the thirty best films of the 2000s in a British Film Institute poll for Sight & Sound.

All- round athlete In 1911, Hartkopf cemented his position as one of Australia's best all-round sportsmen by becoming the Victorian state 440 yards champion and making his first-class cricket debut for Victoria on 23 December 1911 against New South Wales at the Melbourne Cricket Ground, scoring an unbeaten 42 and a duck and taking 2/20 with his leg break bowling. He was a regular member of Victoria's cricket side and University's football side until injury and then World War I restricted Hartkopf's sporting career. Medicine During World War I, Hartkopf worked first at the Royal Women‚Äôs Hospital in Melbourne and then at the Royal Children‚Äôs Hospital in Perth, Western Australia. There is no evidence to suggest his German background caused him problems during the war. Cricket In 1919 Hartkopf returned to Melbourne, opening a medical practice in Northcote and returned to cricket, playing his first game for Victoria for six years, scoring 53 and 49 against New South Wales. In 1922/23 in a match for Victoria against the touring MCC he took 5 for 23 and 8 for 105, and scored 86 and 14 not out. In November 1924, an unbeaten half century for Victoria against the touring English side led to his selection, at age 35, in the Australian team for the second Test of the 1924/25 series against England at the MCG. Batting at number 8, Hartkopf scored 80 in Australia‚Äôs first innings but could only produce match figures of 1/134 and was dropped from the team. Hartkopf continued to play for Victoria until the end of the 1927/28 season but never returned to the national side. He then concentrated on his medical practice.

This strike finally ended some 69 days later, after it was put down by unofficial militias, the National Guard, and federal troops. Because of economic problems and pressure on wages by the railroads, workers in numerous other cities, in New York, Pennsylvania and Maryland, into Illinois and Missouri, also went out on strike. An estimated 100 people were killed in the unrest across the country. In Martinsburg, Pittsburgh, Philadelphia and other cities, workers burned down and destroyed both physical facilities and the rolling stock of the railroads‚Äîengines and railroad cars. Local populations feared that workers were rising in revolution such as the Paris Commune of 1871. At the time, the workers were not represented by trade unions. The city and state governments, aided by unofficial militias, the National Guard, federal troops and private militias organized by the railroads, who fought against the workers. Disruption was widespread and at its height, the strikes were supported by about 100,000 workers. With the intervention of federal troops in several locations, most of the strikes were suppressed by early August. Labor continued to work to organize into unions to work for better wages and conditions. Fearing the social disruption, many cities built armories to support their local National Guard units; these defensive buildings still stand as symbols of the effort to suppress the labor unrest of this period. With public attention on workers' wages and conditions, the B&O; in 1880 founded an Employee Relief Association to provide death benefits and some health care. In 1884, it established a worker pension plan. Other improvements generally had to await further economic growth and associated wage increases. The Panic and Long Depression The Long Depression, beginning in the United States with the financial Panic of 1873 and lasting 65 months, became the longest economic contraction in American history, including the later more famous, 45-month-long Great Depression of the 1930s. The failure of the Jay Cooke bank in New York, was followed quickly by that of Henry Clews, and set off a chain reaction of bank failures, temporarily closing the New York stock market. Unemployment rose dramatically, reaching 14 percent by 1876, many more were severely underemployed, and wages overall dropped to 45% of their previous level.(Saved version of article available at ) Thousands of American businesses failed, defaulting on more than a billion dollars of debt. One in four laborers in New York were out of work in the winter of 1873-1874. National construction of new rail lines dropped from 7,500 miles of track in 1872 to just 1,600 miles in 1875,Paul Kleppner, \\"The Greenback and Prohibition Parties,\\" in Arthur M. Schlesinger (ed.), History of U.S. Political Parties: Volume II, 1860‚Äì1910, The Gilded Age of Politics. New York: Chelsea House/R.R. Bowker Co., 1973; pg. 1556. and production in iron and steel alone dropped as much as 45%. Reason for Strike When the Civil War ended, a boom in railroad construction ensued, with roughly 35,000 miles (55,000 kilometers) of new track being laid from coast-to-coast between 1866 and 1873. The railroads, then the second-largest employer outside of agriculture, required large amounts of capital investment, and thus entailed massive financial risk. Speculators fed large amounts of money into the industry, causing abnormal growth and over-expansion. Jay Cooke's firm, like many other banking firms, invested a disproportionate share of depositors' funds in the railroads, thus laying the track for the ensuing collapse. In addition to Cooke's direct infusion of capital in the railroads, the firm had become a federal agent for the government in the government's direct financing of railroad construction. As building new track in areas where land had not yet been cleared or settled required land grants and loans that only the government could provide, the use of Jay Cooke's firm as a conduit for federal funding worsened the effects that Cooke's bankruptcy had on the nation's economy. In the wake of the Panic of 1873, a bitter antagonism between workers and the leaders of industry developed. Immigration from Europe was underway, as was migration of rural workers into the cities, increasing competition for jobs and enabling companies to drive down wages and easily lay off workers. By 1877, 10 percent wage cuts, distrust of capitalists and poor working conditions led to workers conducting numerous railroad strikes that prevented the trains from moving, with spiraling effects in other parts of the economy. Suppressed by violence, workers continued to organize to try to improve their conditions. Management worked to break up such movements, and mainstream society feared labor organizing as signs of revolutionary socialism. Tensions lingered well after the depression ended in 1878‚Äì79. Many of the new immigrant workers were Catholics, and their church had forbidden participation in secret societies since 1743, partially as a reaction against the anti-Catholicism of Freemasonry. But by the late 19th century, the Knights of Labor, a national and predominately Catholic organization, had 700,000 members seeking to represent all workers. In 1888 Archbishop James Cardinal Gibbons of Baltimore sympathized with the workers and collaborated with other bishops to lift the prohibition against workers joining the KOL. Other workers also took actions, and unrest marked the following decades. In 1886 Samuel Gompers founded the American Federation of Labor for the skilled craft trades, attracting skilled workers from other groups. Other labor organizing followed. \\"The Catholic Church and the Knights of Labor\\", American Catholic History Classroom, The Catholic University of America, accessed 20 May 2016 The Strike Maryland National Guard's Sixth Regiment fighting its way west along main downtown commercial thoroughfare Baltimore Street through Baltimore, Maryland, 20 July 1877 The Great Railroad Strike of 1877 started on July 14 in Martinsburg, West Virginia, in response to the Baltimore & Ohio Railroad (B&O;) cutting wages of workers for the third time in a year. Striking workers would not allow any of the trains, mainly freight trains, to roll until this third wage cut was revoked. West Virginia Governor Henry M. Mathews sent in National Guard units to restore train service but the soldiers refused to fire on the strikers. The governor in Charleston, West Virginia then appealed for federal troops. Maryland Meanwhile, the Strike also spread into western Maryland to the major railroad hub of Cumberland, county seat of Allegany County where railway workers stopped freight and passenger traffic. In Baltimore with the famous Fifth (\\"Dandy Fifth\\") and Sixth Regiments of the former state militia, reorganized since the war as the Maryland National Guard were also called up by 37th Maryland Governor John Lee Carroll, (1830-1911), in Annapolis at the request of powerful B. & O. President John Work Garrett, (1820-1884). The Fifth marched down North Howard Street from their armory above the old Richmond Market (at present North Howard and West Read Streets) in the Mount Vernon-Belvedere neighborhood and were generally unopposed heading south for the B. & O.'s general headquarters and main depot at the Camden Street Station to board the waiting westward trains to Hagerstown and Cumberland. But the unfortunate Sixth assembled at their armory at East Fayette and North Front Streets (by the old Phoenix Shot Tower) in the Old Town /Jonestown area and had to fight their way west through regular sympathetic Baltimore citizens, rioters and striking workers which erupted into bloodshed along main downtown commercial thoroughfare of Baltimore Street to get to Camden. It was a horrible scene reminiscent of the worst of the bloody \\"Pratt Street Riots\\" of the Civil War era disturbances of April 1861, over 15 years earlier of the \\"first bloodshed\\" of the war. When the outnumbered troops of the 6th Regiment finally fired volleys on an attacking crowd on Baltimore Street, they killed 10 civilians and wounded 25. The rioters injured several members of the National Guard, damaged B. & O. engines and train cars, and burned portions of the train station at South Howard and West Camden Streets. The National Guard remained trapped in the surrounding Camden Yards, besieged by armed rioters until July 21‚Äì22, when the 19th President Rutherford B. Hayes sent federal troops and the U.S. Marines to Baltimore to restore order. New York There were strike actions also further north in Albany, Syracuse and Buffalo, New York on other railroad lines. July 25, 1877 workers gathered on Van Woert Street Rail Crossing in Albany New York. The workers waited for a train arrival then proceeded to barrage the train with projectiles. The arrival of Militiaman caused the crowd to rouse and throw their projectiles at the militia. A second night proceeded of attacks on the rail line. After the second night the mayor rescinded the militia and ordered local police to protect the rail.https://books.google.com/books?hl=en&lr;=&id;=r6eATa0q1RQC&oi;=fnd&pg;=PA1&dq;=railroad+strike+of+1877&ots;=EPsgYU4n9y&sig;=DK_LxjXoiQCCVSJyJcdAooAOd-A#v=onepage&q;&f;=false Streets, Railroads, and the Great Strike of 1877 by David O. Stowell Workers in the cities in industries other than railroads still attacked them because of how they cut through the cities and dominated city life. Their resentment of the railroads' economic power was expressed in physical attacks against them at a time when many workers' wages were lowered. Protestors \\"included cross-class elements from other work sites, small businesses, and commercial establishments. Some protestors acted out of solidarity with the strikers, but many more vented militant displeasure against dangerous railroad traffic that crisscrossed urban centers in that area.\\"Scott Molloy, \\"Book Review: Streets, Railroads, and the Great Strike of 1877 By David O. Stowell\\", Technology and Culture 41.3 (2000) 636-638, via Project MUSE, accessed 20 May 2016 PennsylvaniaPittsburgh= Pittsburgh, Pennsylvania became the site of the worst violence of related strikes. Thomas Alexander Scott of the Pennsylvania Railroad, described as one of the first robber barons, suggested that the strikers should be given \\"a rifle diet for a few days and see how they like that kind of bread.\\"Ingham, John N., Biographical Dictionary of American Business Leaders: N-U, Greenwood Press, 1983. As in some other cities and towns, local law enforcement officers such as sheriffs, deputies and police refused to fire on the strikers. Several Pennsylvania National Guard units were ordered into service by Governor John Hartranft, including the 3rd Pennsylvania Infantry Regiment under the command of Colonel George R. Snowden. Burning of Pennsylvania Railroad and Union Depot, Pittsburgh, Pennsylvania, 21‚Äì22 July 1877, engraving from Harper's Weekly Burning of Union Depot, Pittsburgh, Pennsylvania, 21‚Äì22 July 1877, engraving from Harper's Weekly On July 21, National Guard members bayoneted and fired on rock-throwing strikers, killing 20 people and wounding 29. Rather than quell the uprising, these actions infuriated the strikers, who retaliated and forced the National Guard to take refuge in a railroad roundhouse. Strikers set fires that razed 39 buildings and destroyed rolling stock: 104 locomotives and 1,245 freight and passenger cars. On July 22, the National Guard mounted an assault on the strikers, shooting their way out of the roundhouse and killing 20 more people on their way out of the city. After more than a month of rioting and bloodshed in Pittsburgh, President Rutherford B. Hayes sent in federal troops as in West Virginia and Maryland to end the strikes and strife. =Philadelphia= Three hundred miles to the east, Philadelphia strikers battled local National Guard units and set fire to much of Center City before Pennsylvania Governor John Hartranft gained assistance and federal troops from President Hayes to put down the uprising. =Reading= Workers in Reading, Pennsylvania's third-largest industrial city at the time, also broke out into a strike. This city was home of the engine works and shops of the Philadelphia and Reading Railway, against which engineers had struck since April 1877. The national Guard shot 16 citizens. Preludes to the massacre included: fresh work stoppage by all classes of the railroad's local workforce; mass marches; blocking of rail traffic; and trainyard arson. Workers burned down the only railroad bridge offering connections to the west, in order to prevent local National Guard companies from being mustered to actions in the state capital of Harrisburg or Pittsburgh. Authorities used the National Guard, local police and Pinkerton detectives in an attempt to break the strike. Philadelphia and Reading Railway management mobilized a private militia, the members of which committed the shootings in the city. =Shamokin= On July 25, 1,000 men and boys, many of them coal miners, marched to the Reading Railroad Depot in Shamokin, east of Sunbury along the Susquehanna River valley. They looted the depot when the town announced it would pay them only $1/day for emergency public employment. The mayor, who owned coal mines, organized an unofficial militia. It committed 14 civilian shooting casualties, resulting in the deaths of two persons. =Scranton= On August 1, 1877, in Scranton in northeast Pennsylvania, one day after railroad workers conceded a strike, a city posse of 51 men armed with new rifles and under the command of William Walker Scranton, general manager of the Lackawanna Iron & Coal Company, returned fire at a group of rioters, strikers, and, most likely, bystanders. The posse killed or fatally wounded four and wounded an undetermined number of others, estimated at 20 to 50, according to different sources. Pennsylvania Governor Hartranft declared Scranton to be under martial law; it was occupied by state and federal troops armed with Gatling guns. Later the posse leader and about 20 of his men were charged with assault and murder. They were all acquitted. Under the effects of the shootings and military occupation, the miners ended their strike without gaining any of their demands. Illinois On July 24, rail traffic in Chicago was paralyzed when angry mobs of unemployed citizens wreaked havoc in the rail yards, shutting down both the Baltimore and Ohio and the Illinois Central railroads. Soon, other railroads throughout the state were brought to a standstill, with demonstrators shutting down railroad traffic in Bloomington, Aurora, Peoria, Decatur, Urbana and other rail centers throughout Illinois. In sympathy, coal miners in the pits at Braidwood, LaSalle, Springfield, and Carbondale went on strike as well. In Chicago, the Workingmen's Party organized demonstrations that drew crowds of 20,000 people. Judge Thomas Drummond of the United States Court of Appeals for the Seventh Circuit, who was overseeing numerous railroads that had declared bankruptcy in the wake of the earlier financial Panic of 1873, ruled that \\"A strike or other unlawful interference with the trains will be a violation of the United States law, and the court will be bound to take notice of it and enforce the penalty.\\" Drummond told the U.S. Marshals to protect the railroads, and asked for federal troops to enforce his decision: he subsequently had strikers arrested and tried them for contempt of court. The Mayor of Chicago, Monroe Heath, recruited 5,000 men as an unofficial militia, asking for help in restoring order. They were partially successful, and shortly thereafter were reinforced by the arrival of the Illinois National Guard and U.S. Army troops, mobilized by the governor. On July 25, violence between police and the mob erupted, with events reaching a peak the following day. These blood-soaked confrontations between police and enraged mobs are known as the Battle of the Viaduct as they took place near the Halsted Street viaduct, although confrontations also took place at nearby 16th Street, on 12th, and on Canal Street. The headline of the Chicago Times screamed, \\"Terrors Reign, The Streets of Chicago Given Over to Howling Mobs of Thieves and Cutthroats.\\" Order was finally restored. An estimated 20 men and boys died, none of whom were law enforcement or troops; scores more were wounded; and the loss of property was valued in the millions of dollars. Missouri On July 21, workers in the industrial rail hub of East St. Louis, Illinois, halted all freight traffic, with the city remaining in the control of the strikers for almost a week. The St. Louis Workingman's Party led a group of approximately 500 men across the Missouri River in an act of solidarity with the nearly 1,000 workers on strike. It was a catalyst for labor unrest spreading, with thousands of workers in several industries striking for the eight-hour day and a ban on child labor. This was the first such general strike in the United States. The strike on both sides of the river was ended after the governor appealed for help and gained the intervention of some 3,000 federal troops and 5,000 deputized special police. These armed forces killed at least eighteen people in skirmishes around the city. On July 28, 1877, they took control of the Relay Depot, the command center for the uprising, and arrested some seventy strikers. Strike ends The Great Railroad Strike of 1877 began to lose momentum when President Hayes sent federal troops from city to city. These troops suppressed strike after strike, until at last, approximately 45 days after it had started, the Great Railroad Strike of 1877 was over. Aftermath and legacy=Economic effects  Strikers in Pittsburgh burned in total 39 buildings, 104 engines, 46‚Äì66 passenger cars, and 1,200‚Äì1,383 freight cars.\\"The Great Railroad Strike of 1877\\"- Digital History ID 1097, Digital History, University of Houston (and others), accessed 27 May 2016 Damage estimates ranged from five to 10 million dollars. Report of the Committee Appointed to Investigate the Railroad Riots in July, 1877, Harrisburg: L.S. Hart, state printer, 1878, p. 19 Labor relations After the Great Railroad Strike of 1877, union organizers planned for their next battles while politicians and business leaders took steps to prevent a repetition of this chaos. Many states enacted conspiracy statutes. States formed new National Guard units and constructed armories in numerous industrial cities. For workers and employers alike, the strikes had shown the power of workers in combination to challenge the status quo. A National Guard member in Pittsburgh, ordered to break the 1877 strike, pointed out that the workers were driven by \\"one spirit and one purpose among them ‚Äì that they were justified in resorting to any means to break down the power of the corporations.\\"The Republic for Which it Stands the United States during Reconstruction and the Gilded Age 1865 - 1896 by: Richard White ‚Äì Page 544 Unions became better organized as well as more competent, and the number of strikes increased. The Knights of Labor grew to be a national organization of predominately Catholic workers, numbering 700,000 by the early 1880s. In the 1880s nearly 10,000 strike actions and lockouts took place. In 1886 nearly 700,000 workers went on strike. Business leaders strengthened their opposition to the unions, often firing men who tried to organize or join them. Nonetheless, the labor movement continued to grow. One result of the strike was increased public awareness of the grievances of railroad workers. On May 1, 1880, the B&O; Railroad, which had the lowest wage rate of any major railroad, established the Baltimore and Ohio Employees' Relief Association, which provided coverage for sickness, injury from accidents, and a death benefit. In 1884, the B&O; became the first major employer to offer a pension plan. National Guard Militias had almost to completely disappeared after the civil war in the mid-west leaving the cities defenseless to strikes and civil unrest. This led the Federal Government Funding a new National Guard almost all employed by the Middle-class. In the year to come they would quell strikers and double their forces; in the years 1886-1895 they put down 328 civil disorder is mostly in industrial states. These states were Illinois, Pennsylvania, Ohio, and New York; workers came to see the Guardsmen as tools of their employers.The Republic for Which it Stands the United States during Reconstruction and the Gilded Age 1865 - 1896 by: Richard White ‚Äì page 530 Attempts to utilize the National Guard to quell violent outbreaks in 1877 highlighted their ineffectiveness, and in some cases their propensity to outright side with strikers and rioters. In response, as earlier riots in the mid 1800s had prompted the modernization of police forces, the violence of 1877 provided the impetus for modernizing the National Guard, \\"to aid the civil officers, to suppress or prevent riot or insurrections.\\" Commemoration In 2003 the Baltimore and Ohio Railroad Martinsburg Shops, where the strike began, were declared a National Historic Landmark.Michael Caplinger and John Bond (October, 2003) , National Park Service and In 2013 a historical marker commemorating the event was placed in Baltimore, MD, by the Maryland Historical Trust and Maryland State Highway Administration. Its inscription reads: > The first national strike began July 16, 1877, with Baltimore and Ohio > Railroad workers in Martinsburg, West Virginia, and Baltimore, Maryland.

A Mosaic of Theatrical Forms Premodern performance took place on a flowing border between more or less institutionalized forms; rites and plays existed among other public ceremonies such as royal publicity, religious penance, or legal punishment. It is therefore necessary to speak of a mosaic of medieval theatricality.Vicki Ann Cremona, Theatrical Events. Borders, Dynamics, Frames (Amsterdam 2004). Since the 10th Century, Easter liturgies have contained early forms of performance and role play. Some are short text passages, others are quite long and developed. In the 15th and 16th Centuries, Passion Plays and Corpus Christi plays grew into highly developed performances, which in some localities existed until the 17th Century. The premodern combination of liturgy, ritual and performance makes it especially difficult to apply the term \\"Drama\\". It is not always possible to understand the relationship between written text, staging and performance. The texts themselves are often part of a liturgical rite, making it difficult to locate a beginning or an end of the play within the liturgical or paraliturgical context. The Quem Quaeritis? (\\"Whom do you seek?\\" ) segment of the Easter liturgy was an exchange of one question, one answer, and one command between the Angels at Christ's tomb and the three Marys (Virgin Mary, Mary Magdalene, and Mary, the sister of Lazarus). Yet the concept of drama cannot adequately be used to describe the Quem Queritis, since drama as a concept is not found in the medieval sources themselves; using the term drama opens up a vast field of anachronistic misunderstandings.Nils Holger Petersen, The Representational Liturgy of the Regularis Concordi, in: The white mantle of churches, ed. Nigel Hiscock (International medieval research 10, Turnhout 2003), pp. 107-117. The Easter Plays were the core of medieval performance within the liturgy, but there were additional forms such as saints' plays, miracle stories, legends, and apocalyptic plays. The largest part of plot material is taken from the Bible or Christian legend. Contrary to earlier theories tracing the development of European theatre from the Catholic liturgy, there is no logical or chronological development in the various play texts from the Middle Ages; the scope of the text, its complexity, and its dramatic structure of the many sources known today Clifford Flanigan, Liturgical Drama and Its Tradition: A Review of Scholarship 1965‚Äì1975, in: Research Opportunities in Renaissance Drama 18 (1975) 81‚Äì102 und 19 (1976) 109‚Äì136. do not develop in a systematic manner. Another widespread misunderstanding of medieval performance forgets that music always played an important part in liturgical rites and plays. Forms of Performance The rites in Latin were always performed in a church, in the context of a liturgical ceremony. Since they are so strongly integrated into the liturgy (Mass or Liturgy of the Hours), it is questionable whether or not they count as performance. Latin-language plays were also performed in churches without a liturgical context. Vernacular plays were most often performed in public spaces outside of the church, usually on mansion stages on the public square. Stage sets representing heaven, hell, Pontius Pilate's house or the Holy Sepulcher were erected on the stages. To speak of actors is only pertinent to the plays; in the church, the rites were performed by clerics and monks who did not consider themselves to be acting in any amateur or professional sense. A director of sorts arbitrated between the stage and the audience; he commented upon the scene, narrated passages and kept order. While most performances were limited to a few hours, some plays could reach monumental proportions: The Passion-Play of Bolzano took seven days in 1514, and the one staged at Valenciennes in 1547, a total of 25. Social Context While liturgical rites are a constant in Christian life, plays are not. There are passages of European history in which plays are all but unknown. The medieval city was a performance-friendly culture. Clerics and trade fraternities encouraged stage performance in the church and outside of it. Amateur actors were recruited among the ranks of schoolboys and trade apprentices. Topics performed were predominantly taken from Christian sources, yet comic and contemporary topics were omnipresent in almost all performance, in a more or less discreet manner. Improvisation was a crowd-pleaser. Since Christian liturgy is the re-enactment of crucial moments in Christ's life, it comes as no surprise that medieval performance blurs the distinction between reality and the fiction being presented to the audience. Antisemitic violence could occur after the crowds had witnessed a Passion-Play; sometimes members of the audience would interrupt the performance by jumping into the scene in order to \\"save\\" the suffering Christ.John Harris, Medieval Theatre in Context: An Introduction (Routledge 1992).

It also prints opinion pieces, reader letters, and classified advertisements, and contains a property and real estate pull-out section. Its publisher, Northeast Press, is a division of Johnston Press plc. History The newspaper was founded by William Davison of Alnwick in 1854 as the Alnwick Mercury, an 8-page penny monthly. After Davison died in 1858, the business passed to his son, who sold it to Henry Hunter Blair in 1859. By 1864 it was a 4-page weekly. Historical copies of the Alnwick Mercury, dating back to 1854, are available to search and view in digitised form at The British Newspaper Archive. In 1883 the paper merged with the Alnwick and County Gazette as an 8-page penny weekly, the politically Conservative Alnwick and County Gazette and Alnwick Mercury. It continued the numbering of the Mercury.Digitised copies of the Alnwick Mercury at the British Newspaper Archive In 1924 the newspaper incorporated the Alnwick Guardian, becoming the Alnwick and County Gazette and Guardian. The title changed to the Northumberland and Alnwick Gazette in 1943, and to the Northumberland Gazette in 1947. For most of its history it has been in the same ownership as the South Shields daily evening newspaper, the Shields Gazette. For several years the paper was published in several editions covering different districts in east Northumberland, including one for Berwick upon Tweed from no later than 1972 until 1984 or after, one for Morpeth from at least 1946 until 1992, from 1972 under the masthead Morpeth Gazette, for Rothbury and Wooler from about 1954 to 1957, a Wooler edition until 1972 or after, and a Ponteland edition from 1974 to 1992, in latter years under the masthead Ponteland Gazette. This pattern ended in 1992 when the Gazette's publisher, Northeast Press (then part of Portsmouth and Sunderland Newspapers) bought the Alnwick Advertiser (established in 1979) and the Morpeth Herald from the Tweeddale Press Group. The Advertiser was incorporated in the Gazette and the Morpeth and Ponteland editions of the Gazette ended.

Ciarlet; at the University of Paris; at Cornell University, by Richard Gallagher and co-workers. The original works such as those by Argyris Argyris, J.H and Kelsey, S. Energy theorems and Structural Analysis Butterworth Scientific publications, London, 1954 and Clough Clough, R.W, ‚ÄúThe Finite Element in Plane Stress Analysis.‚Äù Proceedings, 2nd ASCE Conference on Electronic Computations, Pittsburgh, Sep 1960 became the foundation for today‚Äôs finite element structural analysis methods. Straight or curved one- dimensional elements with physical properties such as axial, bending, and torsional stiffnesses. This type of element is suitable for modeling cables, braces, trusses, beams, stiffeners, grids and frames. Straight elements usually have two nodes, one at each end, while curved elements will need at least three nodes including the end-nodes. The elements are positioned at the centroidal axis of the actual members. * Two-dimensional elements that resist only in-plane forces by membrane action (plane stress, plane strain), and plates that resist transverse loads by transverse shear and bending action (plates and shells). They may have a variety of shapes such as flat or curved triangles and quadrilaterals. Nodes are usually placed at the element corners, and if needed for higher accuracy, additional nodes can be placed along the element edges or even within the element. The elements are positioned at the mid-surface of the actual layer thickness. * Torus-shaped elements for axisymmetric problems such as membranes, thick plates, shells, and solids. The cross-section of the elements are similar to the previously described types: one-dimensional for thin plates and shells, and two-dimensional for solids, thick plates and shells. * Three-dimensional elements for modeling 3-D solids such as machine components, dams, embankments or soil masses. Common element shapes include tetrahedrals and hexahedrals. Nodes are placed at the vertexes and possibly in the element faces or within the element. Element interconnection and displacement The elements are interconnected only at the exterior nodes, and altogether they should cover the entire domain as accurately as possible. Nodes will have nodal (vector) displacements or degrees of freedom which may include translations, rotations, and for special applications, higher order derivatives of displacements. When the nodes displace, they will drag the elements along in a certain manner dictated by the element formulation. In other words, displacements of any points in the element will be interpolated from the nodal displacements, and this is the main reason for the approximate nature of the solution. Practical considerations From the application point of view, it is important to model the system such that: * Symmetry or anti-symmetry conditions are exploited in order to reduce the size of the model. * Displacement compatibility, including any required discontinuity, is ensured at the nodes, and preferably, along the element edges as well, particularly when adjacent elements are of different types, material or thickness. Compatibility of displacements of many nodes can usually be imposed via constraint relations. * Elements' behaviours must capture the dominant actions of the actual system, both locally and globally. * The element mesh should be sufficiently fine in order to produce acceptable accuracy. To assess accuracy, the mesh is refined until the important results shows little change. For higher accuracy, the aspect ratio of the elements should be as close to unity as possible, and smaller elements are used over the parts of higher stress gradient. * Proper support constraints are imposed with special attention paid to nodes on symmetry axes. Large scale commercial software packages often provide facilities for generating the mesh, and the graphical display of input and output, which greatly facilitate the verification of both input data and interpretation of the results. Theoretical overview of FEM-Displacement Formulation: From elements, to system, to solution While the theory of FEM can be presented in different perspectives or emphases, its development for structural analysis follows the more traditional approach via the virtual work principle or the minimum total potential energy principle. The virtual work principle approach is more general as it is applicable to both linear and non-linear material behaviours. The virtual work method is an expression of conservation of energy: for conservative systems, the work added to the system by a set of applied forces is equal to the energy stored in the system in the form of strain energy of the structure's components. The principle of virtual displacements for the structural system expresses the mathematical identity of external and internal virtual work: :\\\\mbox{External virtual work} = \\\\int_{V}\\\\delta\\\\boldsymbol{\\\\epsilon}^T \\\\boldsymbol{\\\\sigma} \\\\, dV \\\\qquad \\\\mathrm{(1)} In other words, the summation of the work done on the system by the set of external forces is equal to the work stored as strain energy in the elements that make up the system. The virtual internal work in the right-hand- side of the above equation may be found by summing the virtual work done on the individual elements. The latter requires that force-displacement functions be used that describe the response for each individual element. Hence, the displacement of the structure is described by the response of individual (discrete) elements collectively. The equations are written only for the small domain of individual elements of the structure rather than a single equation that describes the response of the system as a whole (a continuum). The latter would result in an intractable problem, hence the utility of the finite element method. As shown in the subsequent sections, Eq.(1) leads to the following governing equilibrium equation for the system: :\\\\mathbf{R} = \\\\mathbf{Kr} + \\\\mathbf{R}^o \\\\qquad \\\\qquad \\\\qquad \\\\mathrm{(2)} where :\\\\mathbf{R} = vector of nodal forces, representing external forces applied to the system's nodes. :\\\\mathbf{K} = system stiffness matrix, which is the collective effect of the individual elements' stiffness matrices :\\\\mathbf{k}^e . :\\\\mathbf{r} = vector of the system's nodal displacements. :\\\\mathbf{R}^o = vector of equivalent nodal forces, representing all external effects other than the nodal forces which are already included in the preceding nodal force vector R. These external effects may include distributed or concentrated surface forces, body forces, thermal effects, initial stresses and strains. Once the supports' constraints are accounted for, the nodal displacements are found by solving the system of linear equations (2), symbolically: :\\\\mathbf{r} = \\\\mathbf{K}^{-1} (\\\\mathbf{R}-\\\\mathbf{R}^o ) \\\\qquad \\\\qquad \\\\qquad \\\\mathrm{(3)} Subsequently, the strains and stresses in individual elements may be found as follows: :\\\\mathbf{\\\\epsilon} = \\\\mathbf{Bq} \\\\qquad \\\\qquad \\\\qquad \\\\qquad \\\\mathrm{(4)} :\\\\mathbf{\\\\sigma} = \\\\mathbf{E}(\\\\mathbf{\\\\epsilon} - \\\\mathbf{\\\\epsilon}^o)+\\\\mathbf{\\\\sigma}^o = \\\\mathbf{E}(\\\\mathbf{Bq} - \\\\mathbf{\\\\epsilon}^o)+\\\\mathbf{\\\\sigma}^o\\\\qquad \\\\qquad \\\\qquad \\\\mathrm{(5)} where :\\\\mathbf{q} = vector of a nodal displacements--a subset of the system displacement vector r that pertains to the elements under consideration. :\\\\mathbf{B} = strain-displacement matrix that transforms nodal displacements q to strains at any point in the element. :\\\\mathbf{E} = elasticity matrix that transforms effective strains to stresses at any point in the element. :\\\\mathbf{\\\\epsilon}^o = vector of initial strains in the elements. :\\\\mathbf{\\\\sigma}^o = vector of initial stresses in the elements. By applying the virtual work equation (1) to the system, we can establish the element matrices \\\\mathbf{B}, \\\\mathbf{k}^e as well as the technique of assembling the system matrices \\\\mathbf{R}^o and \\\\mathbf{K}. Other matrices such as \\\\mathbf{\\\\epsilon}^o , \\\\mathbf{\\\\sigma}^o , \\\\mathbf{R} and \\\\mathbf{E} are known values and can be directly set up from data input. Interpolation or shape functions Let \\\\mathbf{q} be the vector of nodal displacements of a typical element. The displacements at any other point of the element may be found by the use of interpolation functions as, symbolically: :\\\\mathbf{u} = \\\\mathbf{N} \\\\mathbf{q} \\\\qquad \\\\qquad \\\\qquad \\\\mathrm{(6)} where :\\\\mathbf{u} = vector of displacements at any point {x,y,z} of the element. :\\\\mathbf{N} = matrix of shape functions serving as interpolation functions. Equation (6) gives rise to other quantities of great interest: * Virtual displacements that are a function of virtual nodal displacements: \\\\delta \\\\mathbf{u} = \\\\mathbf{N} \\\\delta \\\\mathbf{q} \\\\qquad \\\\qquad \\\\qquad \\\\mathrm{(6b)} * Strains in the elements that result from displacements of the element's nodes:\\\\mathbf{\\\\epsilon} = \\\\mathbf{Du} = \\\\mathbf{DNq} \\\\qquad \\\\qquad \\\\qquad \\\\qquad \\\\mathrm{(7)} :where \\\\mathbf{D} = matrix of differential operators that convert displacements to strains using linear elasticity theory. Eq.(7) shows that matrix B in (4) is ::\\\\mathbf{B} = \\\\mathbf{DN} \\\\qquad \\\\qquad \\\\qquad \\\\qquad \\\\mathrm{(8)} * Virtual strains consistent with element's virtual nodal displacements: \\\\delta \\\\boldsymbol{\\\\epsilon} = \\\\mathbf{B} \\\\delta \\\\mathbf{q} \\\\qquad \\\\qquad \\\\qquad \\\\qquad \\\\mathrm{(9)} Internal virtual work in a typical element For a typical element of volume V^e , the internal virtual work due to virtual displacements is obtained by substitution of (5) and (9) into (1): :\\\\mbox{Internal virtual work} = \\\\int_{V^e}\\\\delta\\\\boldsymbol{\\\\epsilon}^T \\\\boldsymbol{\\\\sigma} \\\\, dV^e = \\\\delta\\\\ \\\\mathbf{q}^T \\\\int_{V^e} \\\\mathbf{B}^T \\\\big{\\\\mathbf{E}(\\\\mathbf{Bq} - \\\\mathbf{\\\\epsilon}^o)+\\\\mathbf{\\\\sigma}^o\\\\big} \\\\, dV^e \\\\qquad \\\\mathrm{(10)} Element matrices Primarily for the convenience of reference, the following matrices pertaining to a typical elements may now be defined: : Element stiffness matrix \\\\mathbf{K}^e = \\\\int_{V^e} \\\\mathbf{B}^T \\\\mathbf{E} \\\\mathbf{B} \\\\, dV^e \\\\qquad \\\\mathrm{(11)} : Equivalent element load vector \\\\mathbf{Q}^{oe} = \\\\int_{V^e} - \\\\mathbf{B}^T \\\\big( \\\\mathbf{E}\\\\mathbf{\\\\epsilon}^o - \\\\mathbf{\\\\sigma}^o\\\\big ) \\\\, dV^e \\\\qquad \\\\mathrm{(12)} These matrices are usually evaluated numerically using Gaussian quadrature for numerical integration. Their use simplifies (10) to the following: :\\\\mbox{Internal virtual work} = \\\\delta\\\\ \\\\mathbf{q}^T \\\\big( \\\\mathbf{K}^e \\\\mathbf{q} + \\\\mathbf{Q}^{oe} \\\\big) \\\\qquad \\\\mathrm{(13)} Element virtual work in terms of system nodal displacements Since the nodal displacement vector q is a subset of the system nodal displacements r (for compatibility with adjacent elements), we can replace q with r by expanding the size of the element matrices with new columns and rows of zeros: :\\\\mbox{Internal virtual work} = \\\\delta\\\\ \\\\mathbf{r}^T \\\\big( \\\\mathbf{K}^e \\\\mathbf{r} + \\\\mathbf{Q}^{oe} \\\\big) \\\\qquad \\\\mathrm{(14)} where, for simplicity, we use the same symbols for the element matrices, which now have expanded size as well as suitably rearranged rows and columns. System virtual work Summing the internal virtual work (14) for all elements gives the right-hand- side of (1): :\\\\mbox{System internal virtual work} = \\\\sum_{e} \\\\delta\\\\ \\\\mathbf{r}^T \\\\big( \\\\mathbf{k}^e \\\\mathbf{r} + \\\\mathbf{Q}^{oe} \\\\big) = \\\\delta\\\\ \\\\mathbf{r}^T \\\\big( \\\\sum_{e} \\\\mathbf{k}^e \\\\big)\\\\mathbf{r} + \\\\delta\\\\ \\\\mathbf{r}^T \\\\sum_{e} \\\\mathbf{Q}^{oe} \\\\qquad \\\\mathrm{(15)} Considering now the left-hand-side of (1), the system external virtual work consists of: * The work done by the nodal forces R: \\\\delta\\\\ \\\\mathbf{r}^T \\\\mathbf{R} \\\\qquad \\\\mathrm{(16)} * The work done by external forces \\\\mathbf{T}^e on the part \\\\mathbf{S}^e of the elements' edges or surfaces, and by the body forces \\\\mathbf{f}^e :: \\\\sum_{e} \\\\int_{S^e} \\\\delta\\\\ \\\\mathbf{u}^T \\\\mathbf{T}^e \\\\, dS^e + \\\\sum_{e} \\\\int_{V^e} \\\\delta\\\\ \\\\mathbf{u}^T \\\\mathbf{f}^e \\\\, dV^e : Substitution of (6b) gives: :: \\\\delta\\\\ \\\\mathbf{q}^T \\\\sum_{e} \\\\int_{S^e} \\\\mathbf{N}^T \\\\mathbf{T}^e \\\\, dS^e + \\\\delta\\\\ \\\\mathbf{q}^T \\\\sum_{e} \\\\int_{V^e} \\\\mathbf{N}^T \\\\mathbf{f}^e \\\\, dV^e :or -\\\\delta\\\\ \\\\mathbf{q}^T \\\\sum_{e} (\\\\mathbf{Q}^{te} + \\\\mathbf{Q}^{fe}) \\\\qquad \\\\mathrm{(17a)} :where we have introduced additional element's matrices defined below: :: \\\\mathbf{Q}^{te} = -\\\\int_{S^e} \\\\mathbf{N}^T \\\\mathbf{T}^e \\\\, dS^e \\\\qquad \\\\mathrm{(18a)} :: \\\\mathbf{Q}^{fe} = -\\\\int_{V^e} \\\\mathbf{N}^T \\\\mathbf{f}^e \\\\, dV^e \\\\qquad \\\\mathrm{(18b)} :Again, numerical integration is convenient for their evaluation. A similar replacement of q in (17a) with r gives, after rearranging and expanding the vectors \\\\mathbf{Q}^{te}, \\\\mathbf{Q}^{fe} : :: -\\\\delta\\\\ \\\\mathbf{r}^T \\\\sum_{e} (\\\\mathbf{Q}^{te} + \\\\mathbf{Q}^{fe}) \\\\qquad \\\\mathrm{(17b)} Assembly of system matrices Adding (16), (17b) and equating the sum to (15) gives: \\\\delta\\\\ \\\\mathbf{r}^T \\\\mathbf{R} -\\\\delta\\\\ \\\\mathbf{r}^T \\\\sum_{e} (\\\\mathbf{Q}^{te} + \\\\mathbf{Q}^{fe}) = \\\\delta\\\\ \\\\mathbf{r}^T \\\\big( \\\\sum_{e} \\\\mathbf{k}^e \\\\big)\\\\mathbf{r} + \\\\delta\\\\ \\\\mathbf{r}^T \\\\sum_{e} \\\\mathbf{Q}^{oe} Since the virtual displacements \\\\delta\\\\ \\\\mathbf{r} are arbitrary, the preceding equality reduces to: \\\\mathbf{R} = \\\\big( \\\\sum_{e} \\\\mathbf{k}^e \\\\big)\\\\mathbf{r} + \\\\sum_{e} \\\\big( \\\\mathbf{Q}^{oe} + \\\\mathbf{Q}^{te} + \\\\mathbf{Q}^{fe} \\\\big) Comparison with (2) shows that: * The system stiffness matrix is obtained by summing the elements' stiffness matrices: : \\\\mathbf{K} = \\\\sum_{e} \\\\mathbf{k}^e * The vector of equivalent nodal forces is obtained by summing the elements' load vectors: : \\\\mathbf{R}^o = \\\\sum_{e} \\\\big( \\\\mathbf{Q}^{oe} + \\\\mathbf{Q}^{te} + \\\\mathbf{Q}^{fe} \\\\big) In practice, the element matrices are neither expanded nor rearranged. Instead, the system stiffness matrix \\\\mathbf{K} is assembled by adding individual coefficients {k}_{ij}^e to {K}_{kl} where the subscripts ij, kl mean that the element's nodal displacements {q}_{i}^e, {q}_{j}^e match respectively with the system's nodal displacements {r}_{k}, {r}_{l} . Similarly, \\\\mathbf{R}^o is assembled by adding individual coefficients {Q}_{i}^e to {R}^o_{k} where {q}_{i}^e matches {r}_{k} . This direct addition of {k}_{ij}^e into {K}_{kl} gives the procedure the name Direct Stiffness Method.

From 1951 to 1953, during the Korean War, Phelan served in the United States Marine Corps. Professional playing career Selected in the eighth round (77th overall) in the 1951 NBA draft, Phelan played in three games as a reserve for the Philadelphia Warriors in 1953. He then played for the Pottstown Packers in the Eastern League. Jim Phelan's 600th win ball from Feb 17, 1986 Coaching career Phelan coached his entire career at Mount Saint Mary's University. He led the Mountaineers to the 1962 NCAA Men's Division II Basketball Championship. When he retired in 2003, after coaching for 49 years, he had amassed 830 wins (overall record of 830-524) in over 1,300 games in all divisions. In those 49 years, Phelan had 19 teams that reached 20 or more wins in a season. Prior to the announcement of his induction to the National Collegiate Basketball Hall of Fame in April 2008, Phelan was often noted for having the most victories of any coach not in the Hall of Fame. He got his 800th win in the Northeast Conference Championship Game on March 1, 1999. He became just the 4th coach in NCAA history to get 800 career wins; currently he sits 14th on the all-time list. On January 19, 1998, he became just the 2nd coach in NCAA history to coach in 1,200 career games. The only other coach to do so prior was Clarence Gaines. Phelan held the record in games coached with 1,354 across all NCAA divisions and is currently 4th on the all-time list; he is behind Phog Allen and tied with Jim Smith for second place in total career seasons coached with 49, though all 49 of Phelan's and Smith's seasons came at one school while Allen coached at four other institutions besides Kansas, where he gained fame.

He is one of only two Australian rugby and cricket dual internationals, the other being Johnny Taylor. Early life and education Otto Nothling was born of German immigrant parents in Teutoberg, Queensland, an area settled by German immigrants. He won a scholarship to Brisbane Grammar School, and went on to the University of Sydney, where he studied Medicine.The Oxford Companion to Australian Cricket, Oxford, Melbourne, 1996, pp. 393‚Äì94. At the time there was no medical school in Queensland. He was a champion athlete at school and university, excelling at running distances between 100 and 440 yards, as well as shot put and javelin. He set a New South Wales record at his first javelin event. Rugby union career Nothling, a fullback, claimed a total of 19 international rugby caps for Australia, playing against New Zealand, Maoris and South Africa. He retired from rugby when he graduated from university. At the time of his death he was vice-president of the Queensland Rugby Union. Cricket career Nothling was a right-arm fast-medium bowler and hard-hitting middle-order batsman. He played for New South Wales while studying in Sydney, then for Queensland from the 1927‚Äì28 season. He took five wickets ‚Äì all of leading batsmen ‚Äì when Queensland played the touring MCC in November 1928. A few weeks later he was selected for the Second Test. He opened the bowling but took no wickets, and made 44 in the second innings, adding 101 for the fifth wicket with Jack Ryder. His best first-class score was 121, scored in 145 minutes, for Queensland against New South Wales shortly after his Test appearance in 1928‚Äì29. His best bowling figures were 5 for 39 against New South Wales in 1927‚Äì28 in the second innings, when Queensland almost won the drawn match after being made to follow on. In a club match for Maryborough against Gayndah in December 1929 he took 10 for 16 in the first innings. Later life After graduating as a doctor, Nothling briefly practised medicine in Dubbo in western New South Wales before returning to Queensland. He moved to Maryborough, Queensland, in 1929, and retired from major sport, although he continued to play cricket locally. He served in World War II as a medical officer, with the rank of major, in Egypt and Greece from 1940 until 1943, when he was invalided out. He later became a dermatologist, practising in Brisbane. At the time of his death he was President of the Queensland Cricket Association.

It was published by IPC Magazines and was one of that company's major adventure titles throughout the 1960s and early 1970s. Publication history The title went through a number of name changes and mergers, although always returning to its simpler one-word name. On 23 February 1963, it merged with Knockout, and later, with Smash! in 1971. It was briefly published for one week as Valiant again on 25 September 1971, then Valiant and TV21 on 2 October 1971. It merged with Lion on 25 May 1974, and with Vulcan on 10 April 1976. After many years, Valiant began to seem old-fashioned when the first of a new type of comic was launched, the first issue of Battle Picture Weekly, in 1975. It suffered further when Pat Mills launched Action in February 1976. Attempts by editor John Wagner to update the title were initially successful, but it struggled to find a place in the market against these tougher adventure titles. Valiant limped on for a few months, but finally merged with Battle Picture Weekly on 23 October 1976.History of Battle at sevenpennynightmare.co.uk In June 1963, Valiant brought out the first two (per month) issues of the digest-sized \\"Valiant Picture Library\\" which featured stories which were nothing to do with the comic. They cost one shilling each. On 19 March 2012, Royal Mail launched a special stamp collection to celebrate Britain's rich comic book history. The collection featured Valiant, The Beano, The Dandy, Eagle, The Topper, Roy of the Rovers, Bunty, Buster, Twinkle and 2000 AD. Stories Valiant contained a mix of conventional war stories, such as Captain Hurricane from the first issue, which was a semi-humorous strip set during the Second World War about a massive ex-sea skipper who became a Captain in the Royal Marines, and who could be provoked into \\"ragin' fury\\" berserker rages which gave him great strength; classic humour strips, such as The Crows who were in almost all issues from the first issue, and The Nutts (Ginger Nutt, the teenage daughter, only really had one panel in issue 3; she was too good-looking to be a figure of fun), also from the first issue, and Billy Bunter from issue 21; as well as classic detective strips, such as Sexton Blake. But it also had a number of innovative new heroes. In Kelly's Eye from issue 21, for instance, Tim Kelly wore a jewel called the Eye of Zoltec (obtained from a Mayan idol) around his neck, which protected him from all harm, making him invulnerable. Adam Eterno (who originally appeared in Thunder) was thousands of years old, and could only be slain by a fatal blow from a weapon made of gold. The House of Dolmann which started with issue 210 (8 October 1966), featured an inventor and ventriloquist who constructed remote controlled \\"dolls\\", or puppets, with strange abilities, such as stretching, drilling, and vision powers, that helped him in his fight against crime. Jack o'Justice from the first issue, always accompanied by his girlfriend and eventual wife Moll Moonlight, was a swashbuckling 18th century adventurer who fought criminals, the supernatural and monsters; both Jack and Moll were experts with their swords and on horseback. In time, the Jack o'Justice stories ended; in issue 195 (1966) the series was replaced by Jack Justice, a contemporary crimefighting adventurer 200 years later, who was the direct descendant of Jack and Moll. The celebrated anti-hero, The Steel Claw from the first issue, with his fantastic power of invisibility and the capability to electrocute his enemies, due to his body's ability to store electric current, would influence comic creators such as Alan Moore and David Lloyd. Mytek the Mighty, a giant robot ape from issue 104, started out as a villain in the hands of a criminal named Gogra, but eventually became a hero who battled other robots and giant creatures. In 104 also started Legge's Eleven, about a crazy team of footballers. Both Mytek and Legge's Eleven ended in issue number 282 (24 February 1968) but Mytek was back in issue 297 (8 June 1968). Issue 137 went from 28 to 40 pages for one penny more (to seven pence). It had a two-to-three-page text story titled Jason Hyde about a mystery man from whose eyes poured blue rays (he normally wore special sunglasses) that allowed him to see through solid objects and read minds.

Two new strips introduced by John Wagner in 1975 were Death Wish and One-Eyed Jack. The stories were mainly two or three pages long, and in black and white (apart from the coloured covers). Many of them were story arcs, which continued week after week, with cliff-hanger endings so you had to buy the next issue to see how they escaped from dangerous or deadly situations. Character re- appearances Several of Valiant's characters have made appearances since the comic's cancellation. Alan Moore and Alan Davis used several (renamed) characters in their Captain Britain strip. Also, Quality Comics released a four issue mini-series of The Steel Claw in 1986, featuring recoloured reprint material, with new material drawn by Garry Leach that acted as a framing device. The Steel Claw and several of IPC's 1960s heroes were also featured in Zenith in 2000 AD, followed by a one-off special featuring old Valiant and IPC characters, the 2000 AD Action Special in 1992.Action Special at 2000ad.org (retrieved 29 June 2017) In 2005, many of IPC's characters were featured in a mini-series called Albion, published by the Wildstorm imprint of DC Comics, written by Leah Moore and John Reppion and plotted by Alan Moore.

(; ), also called the Order of Saint Mary of the Tower or the Order of the Knights of the Mother of God, commonly the Knights of Saint Mary, was a military order founded in 1261. The order received its rule from Pope Urban IV, who expressly states the purpose of the organisation and the rights and obligations of its members: > [The members of the order] are to be allowed to bear arms for the defence of > the catholic faith and ecclesiastical freedom, when specifically required to > do so by the Roman church. For subduing civil discords they may carry only > defensive weapons, provided they have the permission of the diocesan. The rule of the order was based on that of the Augustinians, but by a precedent set by the Order of Santiago and the Militia of Jesus Christ, members could marry and did not live in communal poverty. Their chief task appears to have been the pacification of the Lombard cities, racked by factional strife. In this they were largely unsuccessful, due in no small part to their political allegiance to the Church. The unique position of the order and the nature of its rule has led to its being denied full status by historians, who have sometimes labelled it a mere confraternity. The order would admit a woman as a militissa (female knight). The order did have some success at building bridges between the Guelphs and Ghibellines. Two founding members, Loderingo degli Andal√≤, a Ghibelline from Bologna, and Catalano di Guido of the Catalani family of Guelphs, were given the government of Bologna in 1265 during a period of civil strife between the two factions. Though less than successful there, the two knights were appointed by Pope Clement IV the very next year (1266) to govern Florence in the aftermath of the Battle of Benevento. They gained the opprobrium of the Florentines, however, and Dante Alighieri, in his famous Inferno placed them in the eighth circle of Hell with the hypocrites, where they sing: {:Frati godenti fummo, e bolognesi; ::io Catalano e questi Loderingo ::nomati, e da tua terra insieme presi  :Frati Gaudenti were we, and Bolognese; ::I Catalano, and he Loderingo ::Named, and together taken by thy city . . . } The order gained a reputation for carelessness with respect to their vows and were labelled the fratres gaudentes (Latin) or frati (cavalieri) gaudenti (Italian): jovial (joyous, jubliant) brothers (brethren, friars). Not all later members of the order were corrupt‚ÄîEnrico degli Scrovegni patronised the Scrovegni Chapel‚Äîbut the order was eventually suppressed by Pope Sixtus V in 1558.

After his father's retirement in 1609, he succeeded to the Honda family headship, becoming the second generation lord of the Kuwana Domain.

Beginning with only US$1 million, the bank grew into the flagship of Safra‚Äôs international banking empire with nearly US$5 billion in deposits by the early 1980s. TDB's mode of banking was different from much of that done in the western world, as it was done with intimacy and learning a depositor's character rather than balance sheets and hard numbers. Safra sold the bank for US$550 million in 1983 to American Express. TDB owner, Edmond Safra, was inducted to the board of American Express. The acquisition of TDB by American Express was part of Jim Robinson's plan, who at the time was the chairman of American Express, to break into the private depositor banking industry. TDB was intended to be 3rd arm of American Express's financial empire which would reach wealthy private depositors internationally. TDB quickly realized after the acquisition that American Express was not able to uphold promises with which they used to court TDB at the time of acquisition and TDB was excluded from important company decisions such as the overpriced US$1 billion acquisition of a Minneapolis-based financial services firm named Investors Diversified Services, Inc. (IDS). TDB was only notified of the deal once their executives received a dispatch fresh from the Dow Jones news wire. Among other incidents, there was also the American Express public announcement of a US$242 million earnings loss on the year due to excessive insurance claims paid out through their California-based insurance company, Fireman's Fund. TDB was not given any warning of the excessive filed claims which caused the first year with a net loss in earnings by American Express. It was after this incident that TDB owner, Edmond Safra, tried to separate from the mother company. After failed attempts to get American Express to accept his offers to buy TDB back, Safra went on to open a competing bank. It was in response to the opening of a competing bank, that American Express launched an international smear campaign against Safra, by inaccurately reporting to news and media outlets that Safra was being investigated by the FBI for being involved in the Iran‚ÄìContra affair along with drug trafficking and the mafia. All of the accusations are confirmed to be false, and as a result led to the resignation of Harry Freeman, the American Express chairman Jim Robinson's right-hand man and public relations chief, after admitting to the entire scandal. In July 1989, American Express publicly apologized to Edmond Safra and donated US$8 million to the charity of his choice. In 1989, American Express sold its Swiss banking operations to Compagnie de Banque et d‚ÄôInvestissements.

In Slavic languages the word means ‚Äúmagicians‚Äù or ‚Äúsorcerers‚Äù, but it is unclear how the word became associated with the dish. The origin of kalduny is uncertain: they may have originated with equal likelihood in the West (Germany or Czech lands) or in the East (brought by the Tatar-Mongols across Siberia and the Urals). Description Kalduny, dumplings of unleavened dough filled with meat, mushrooms, or other stuffings, are related to similar dishes in the West and in the East alike, from Italian ravioli, Hungarian derelye, and Ashkenazi Jewish pirogen to Russian pelmeni and Central Asian manti or chuchvara. Kalduny made with a stuffing of smoked ham and mushrooms (Kalduny Count Tyshkevich, named after a Belarusian noble family from Lahojsk near Minsk) were long considered Belarus‚Äôs ‚Äúvisiting card‚Äù, although decades of Soviet rule almost erased their trace from public memory and now they are only served in a few local restaurants. Currently the Russian pelmeni and the Ukrainian vareniki are served in more restaurants. The simplest dough for kalduny is made of flour mixed with tepid water, eggs, and some salt.Basic dough for kalduny . In some recipes the dough for kalduny is mixed with onion juice, not water.Using onion juice in kalduny dough . Kalduny dough should be soft but elastic, easy to stretch and to seal into a pocket around a dollop of filling. Like other pastry doughs it has to be allowed to rest, covered with a dish towel or a cloth so as not to dry out. Kalduny are usually boiled in a big shallow casserole at low heat, in well-salted water. Instead of boiling in water, kalduny may be boiled directly in a soup, in which they are then served. Some varieties are baked or fried. Kalduny Polesie style, with a stuffing of boiled river fish and hard-boiled eggs, are fried. A variety known in Russian cuisine as kundumy () is never boiled: the mushroom-filled dumplings are baked in a crock pot in the oven or fried.Kundumy in Russian cuisine; description in dictionary of culinary terms .Baked kundumy: photos on flickr.com. Kalduny may be served as a main course or a dessert, depending on the stuffing. For the former, meat, mushrooms, farmer cheese, or fish is used; for the latter, fresh berries or sometimes dried fruits may be used. The sauce or topping for kalduny also depends on the stuffing. Kalduny with Vilnius stuffing (mushrooms and smoked pork, as in Kalduny Count Tyshkevich) are topped with melted butter, while the Russian stuffing (farmer cheese or mashed potatoes) requires thick sour cream. Dessert kalduny are powdered with cinnamon or topped with fruit syrups.

Merops orientalis at Nalsarovar Bird Sanctuary Nal Sarovar Bird Sanctuary, consisting primarily of a lake and ambient marshes, is situated about 64 km to the west of Ahmedabad near Sanand Village, in the Gujarat state of India. Mainly inhabited by migratory birds in winter and spring, it is the largest wetland bird sanctuary in Gujarat, and one of the largest in India. It was declared a bird sanctuary in April 1969. The lake attracts over 210 species of birds in the winter, and harbors a variety of plants and animals. Besides a few mammalian species including the endangered wild ass and the black buck, its migratory bird population includes rosy pelicans, flamingoes, white storks, brahminy ducks and herons. Thousands of migratory waterfowl flock to this sanctuary just after the Indian monsoon season. The shallow area and ponds on the outer fringes of the lake attract the wading birds that feed in the shallow waters. Millions of birds visit the bird sanctuary in winter and spring. It harbors over 250 species of wetland birds. Winter migrants from the north including purple moorhen, pelicans, lesser flamingos and greater flamingos, white storks, four species of bitterns, crakes, grebes, brahminy ducks(Ruddy shelduck) and herons visit Nal Sarovar. Between November and February, the lake is home to vast flocks of indigenous and migratory birds. Ducks, geese, pelicans and flamingos are best seen early in the morning and in the evening and the sanctuary is best visited as a day excursion by personal vehicle, taxi, as buses are infrequent and there is no convenient accommodation. Vehicles are available from parking to the lake site which is approx 1 km. Hours for visiting the lake are 6 am to 5:30 pm. There is an entry fee per visitor and camera, however for boating one needs to negotiate with the local boatmen, though prescribed rates are mentioned at the gate. The best time to reach there is just before sunrise as the lake is calm and quiet and flock of birds waiting for their regular food. The water in the lake is about 4 feet deep. Visitors can take a horse ride with a number of horses at the lakeside. Migrating Aamin bhai shepherds populate the islands of the lake and on the banks are the Padhars, who are folk dancers, artisans and boatmen. One can hire country boats on the lake for bird viewing, and picnic at shacks the on the islands.

History Bishop James M Thoburn The origins of CBS are closely linked with the establishment of the Methodist Episcopal Church in India. In January 1873, the Reverend William Taylor founded the work of the Thoburn Methodist Episcopal Church in Calcutta (Kolkata). He was succeeded by the Reverend James Mills Thoburn. The latter's ardent preaching soon rendered the Entally Baptist Chapel unable to cope with the increasing number of converts.\\"visions & victories in Hindustan\\" by Bishop B.T.

The New Thoburn Church was dedicated on 31 December 1875. In 1888 Rev. James Mills Thoburn was elected Missionary Bishop of India and Malaysia - the first ever Missionary Bishop in India. It was Bishop Thoburn who founded the Calcutta Boys' School. First located at Mott Lane, and then later housed in a room on Corporation Street (known as S. N. Banerjee Road today), the school struggled for survival without a building of its own. It acquired a permanent residence in 1893 thanks to the generosity of a man who could be regarded as the chief patron of the school: Sir Robert Laidlaw, founder of the 'Whiteaway, Laidlaw & Company'. The school now has four houses named under the founder, benefactors and well-wishers; Thoburn (Red), Laidlaw (Green), Warne (Yellow) and Henderson (Blue). During Clifford Hicks' (educationist) time as Principal & Secretary, the middle building that currently houses the CBS Chapel Hall was built. Named the 'Fritchley Building', the construction was made possible by the retirement benefit and gratuity of Mr. Horace Christopher Fritchley, former Principal (1931-1951), which he donated to \\"his very dear CBS\\" together with donations collected by the students of the school. The school library (now housed in the old Physics lab) is named \\"The Clifford Hicks Memorial Library\\". The CBS Archives (established in 2008) is housed in the old Library. Gilbert Samuel, who became Principal in 1997, furthered the cause of co-curricular activities, allowing the students of CBS to secure top positions at premier National and International contests regularly, including a second-place finish at the 2003 Biology Olympiad and the International Informatics Olympiad in 2004.The Telegraph, 2 June 2003; 5 June 2004 In 2005 CBS won the under-16 national cricket tournament, and in 2004 the national rounds of the Inter School Frank Antony Memorial Debate. Raja McGee, who became Principal in 2007, introduced the USO - United Students Organisation (an elected Students Council) and the DIA (Department for Innovation and Assessment). The language Festival \\"Lingua Fiesta\\" and the science festival \\"COSMA\\" (Computer, Science & Maths festival) was also introduced in the same year.

Jain vegetarianism is practiced by the followers of Jain culture and philosophy. It is one of the most rigorous forms of spiritually motivated diet on the Indian subcontinent and beyond. The Jain cuisine is completely vegetarian and also excludes underground vegetables such as potato, garlic, onion etc, to prevent injuring small insects and microorganisms; and also to prevent the entire plant getting uprooted and killed. It is practised by Jain ascetics and lay Jains. Jain objections to the eating of meat, fish and eggs are based on the principle of non-violence (ahimsa, figuratively \\"non-injuring\\"). Every act by which a person directly or indirectly supports killing or injury is seen as act of violence (himsa), which creates harmful reaction karma. The aim of ahimsa is to prevent the accumulation of such karma. The extent to which this intention is put into effect varies greatly among Hindus, Buddhists and Jains. Jains believe nonviolence is the most essential religious duty for everyone (ahinsƒÅ paramo dharma·∏•, a statement often inscribed on Jain temples). It is an indispensable condition for liberation from the cycle of reincarnation,Hemacandra, Yogashastra 2.31. which is the ultimate goal of all Jain activities. Jains share this goal with Hindus and Buddhists, but their approach is particularly rigorous and comprehensive. Their scrupulous and thorough way of applying nonviolence to everyday activities, and especially to food, shapes their entire lives and is the most significant hallmark of Jain identity. A side effect of this strict discipline is the exercise of asceticism, which is strongly encouraged in Jainism for lay people as well as for monks and nuns. Out of the five types of living beings, a householder is forbidden to kill, or destroy, intentionally, all except the lowest (the one sensed, such as vegetables, herbs, cereals, etc., which are endowed with only the sense of touch). Practice *For Jains, lacto-vegetarianism is mandatory. Food is restricted to that originating from plants, since plants have only one sense ('ekindriya') and are the least developed form of life, and dairy products. Food that contains even the smallest particles of the bodies of dead animals or eggs is unacceptable. Some Jain scholars and activists support veganism, as the modern commercialised production of dairy products involves violence against farm animals. In ancient times, dairy animals were well cared for and not killed. According to Jain texts, a ≈õrƒÅvaka (householder) shouldn't consume the four maha-vigai (the four perversions) - wine, flesh, butter and honey; and the five udumbara fruits (the five udumbara trees are Gular, Anjeera, Banyan, Peepal, and Pakar, all belonging to the fig class). *Jains go out of their way so as not to hurt even small insects and other tiny animals, because they believe that harm caused by carelessness is as reprehensible as harm caused by deliberate action.Sutrakrtangasutram 1.8.3Uttaradhyayanasutra 10Tattvarthasutra 7.8 Hence they take great pains to make sure that no minuscule animals are injured by the preparation of their meals and in the process of eating and drinking. *Traditionally Jains have been prohibited from drinking unfiltered water. In the past, when stepwells were used for the water source, the cloth used for filtering was reversed, and some filtered water poured over it to return the organisms to the original body of water. This practice of jivani or bilchavani is no longer possible because of the use of pipes for water supply. Modern Jains may also filter tap water in the traditional fashion and a few continue to follow the filtering process even with commercial mineral or bottled drinking water. *Jains make considerable efforts not to injure plants in everyday life as far as possible. Jains only accept such violence in as much as it is indispensable for human survival, and there are special instructions for preventing unnecessary violence against plants. Strict Jains do not eat root vegetables such as potatoes, onions, roots and tubers as they are considered ananthkay. Ananthkay means one body, but containing infinite lives. A root vegetable such as potato, though from the looks of it is one article, is said to contain infinite lives in it. Also, tiny life forms are injured when the plant is pulled up and because the bulb is seen as a living being, as it is able to sprout. Also, consumption of most root vegetables involves uprooting and killing the entire plant, whereas consumption of most terrestrial vegetables doesn't kill the plant (it lives on after plucking the vegetables or it was seasonally supposed to wither away anyway). Green vegetables and fruits contain uncountable, but not infinite, lives. Dry beans, lentils, cereals, nuts and seeds contain a countable number of lives and their consumption results in the least destruction of life. * Mushrooms, fungi and yeasts are forbidden because they grow in unhygienic environments and may harbour other life forms. *Honey is forbidden, as its collection would amount to violence against the bees.Hemacandra: Yogashastra 3.37 *Jain texts declare that a ≈õrƒÅvaka (householder) shouldn't cook or eat at night. According to Acharya Amritchandra's Purushartha Siddhyupaya: *Strict Jains do not consume food that has been stored overnight, as it possesses a higher concentration of micro- organisms (for example, bacteria, yeast etc.) as compared to food prepared and consumed the same day. Hence, they do not consume yoghurt or dhokla and idli batter unless they have been freshly set on the same day. *During certain days of the month and on important religious days such as Paryushana and 'Ayambil', strict Jains avoid eating green leafy vegetables along with the usual restrictions on root vegetables. Even with these restrictions, Jains have developed a wide-ranging cuisine. Apart from the regular vegetables, plain yeastless fresh bread, lentils and rice (dal chawal - roti), Jains prepare various delicacies. * Jains do not consume fermented foods (beer, wine and other alcohols) to avoid killing of a large number of microorganisms associated with the fermenting process. According to Puru·π£ƒÅrthasiddhyupƒÅya: Influence on vegetarian cuisines in India The vegetarian cuisines of some regions of the Indian subcontinent have been strongly influenced by Jainism. These include * Gujarati Jain cuisine * Marwari Jain cuisine of Rajasthan * Bundelkhandi Jain cuisine of central India * Agrawal Jain cuisine of Delhi/UP * Marathi Jain cuisine of South Maharashtra * Jain Bunt cuisine of Karnataka * Kannada Jains cuisine of Karnataka * Tamil Jains cuisine of Northern Districts of Tamil Nadu. In India, vegetarian food is considered appropriate for everyone for all occasions. This makes vegetarian restaurants quite popular. Many vegetarian restaurants and Mishtanna sweet-shops ‚Äì for example, the legendary Ghantewala sweets of Delhi and Jamna Mithya in Sagar ‚Äì are run by Jains. Some restaurants in India serve Jain versions of vegetarian dishes that leave out carrots, potatoes, onions and garlic. A few airlines serve Jain vegetarian dishesupon prior request. Historical background When Mahavira revived and reorganized the Jain community in the 6th century BCE, ahimsa was already an established, strictly observed rule. Parshvanatha, a tirthankara whom modern Western historians consider a historical figure, lived in about the 8th century BCE and founded a community to which Mahavira‚Äôs parents belonged.Acaranga Sutra 2.15 Parshvanatha‚Äôs followers vowed to observe ahimsa; this obligation was part of their caujjama dhamma (Fourfold Restraint).Sthananga Sutra 266 In the times of Mahavira and in the following centuries, Jains criticized Buddhists and followers of the Vedic religion or Hindus for negligence and inconsistency in the implementation of ahimsa. In particular, they strongly objected to the Vedic tradition of animal sacrifice with subsequent meat-eating, and to hunting. According to the famous Tamil classic, Tirukku·πõa·∏∑, which is also considered a Jain work by some scholars: > If the world did not purchase and consume meat, no one would slaughter and > offer meat for sale. (Kural 256) Some Brahmins‚ÄîKashmiri Pandits, Bengali Brahmins and Saraswat Brahmins‚Äîhave traditionally eaten meat (primarily seafood). However, in regions with strong Jain influence such as Rajasthan and Gujarat, or strong Jain influence in the past such as Karnataka and Tamil Nadu, Brahmins are strict vegetarians. Bal Gangadhar Tilak has described Jainism as the originator of ahimsa. He wrote in a letter: > In ancient times, innumerable animals were butchered in sacrifices. Evidence > in support of this is found in various poetic compositions such as the > Meghaduta. But the credit for the disappearance of this terrible massacre > from the Brahminical religion goes to Jainism.Bombay Samachar, Mumbai:10 > Dec, 1904  See also  * Fruitarianism * Veganism * Indian cuisine * List of diets * Sattvic diet * Vegetarian cuisine * Vegetarianism and religion * Vitalism (Jainism) * Vegetarianism and ecology References=Citations Sources       * External links * List of Foods that are not-Jain Category:Indian cuisine Category:Vegetarian dishes of India Category:Vegetarianism in India Vegetarianism ","title":"Jain vegetarianism"},{"id":"3587241","text":"David Allen Zubik ( ; born September 4, 1949) is an American prelate of the Roman Catholic Church who serves as the twelfth and current bishop of the Diocese of Pittsburgh. Bishop Zubik previously served as the bishop of the Diocese of Green Bay from 2003 to 2007. Biography=Early life and education David Zubik was born in Sewickley, Pennsylvania, to Stanley (b. 1927) and Susan Zubik (n√©e Raskosky; died 2006). The grandson of Polish and Slovak immigrants, he is an only child. He was raised in Ambridge, Pennsylvania, and attended St. Stanislaus Church. His parents would take him to a local amusement park after Mass on Sundays. Zubik first considered pursuing Holy Orders in the first grade, later contemplating a career in law before returning to his priestly aspirations after attending a retreat in 1965 on the South Side. After graduating from St. Veronica High School in 1967, he entered St. Paul Seminary in Pittsburgh. He earned an undergraduate degree from Duquesne University in 1971 and continued his studies at St. Mary's Seminary and University in Baltimore, Maryland, earning a Master of Divinity degree in 1975. Ordination and Priestly Ministry Zubik was ordained to the priesthood by Bishop Vincent Leonard on May 3, 1975 for service in Roman Catholic Diocese of Pittsburgh. His first appointment was in parochial vicar of Sacred Heart Church in Shadyside until 1980, and as Vice-Principal of Quigley Catholic High School and chaplain to the Sisters of St. Joseph in Baden until 1987. He received a Master's degree in Education Administration from Duquesne University in 1982. From 1987 to 1991, he was secretary to Bishop Anthony Bevilacqua. Zubik became an associate spiritual director of St. Vincent Seminary in Latrobe in 1989 and, with the arrival of Bishop Donald Wuerl to Pittsburgh (in 1988) Zubik was appointed as Diocesan Director of Clergy Personnel from 1991-96. During this period, Zubik allegedly aided in the cover-up of \\"predator priests\\", including Ernest Paone. The 2018 Grand Jury report into clergy abuse found that Zubik knew of the serious allegations of abuse made against Paone, yet Zubik chose not contact the police. Instead, Zubik allegedly abetted the crimes by concealing the allegations in the Diocese of Pittsburgh's confidential files.https://docs.google.com/file/d/1C1PgaKftfm-BAuosDw7oN4VPs3WqvHT_/view Zubik became President of the Diocesan Finance Council in 1995. In 1996 Zubik was appointed by Donald Wuerl to serve alongside him as Vicar General and Moderator of the Curia for the Diocese of Pittsburgh in 1996. He also served as chaplain of the Sisters of the Holy Spirit Motherhouse in Pittsburgh. Auxiliary Bishop of Pittsburgh On February 18, 1997, Zubik was appointed Auxiliary Bishop of Pittsburgh and Titular Bishop of Jamestown by Pope John Paul II. He received his episcopal consecration on the following April 6 from then-Bishop Donald Wuerl, with Bishops Nicholas Dattilo and Thomas Tobin serving as co-consecrators, at St. Paul Cathedral. He selected as his episcopal motto: \\"Nothing is Impossible with God\\" (). Bishop of Green Bay Zubik was named the eleventh Bishop of Green Bay, Wisconsin, on October 10, 2003, replacing Bishop Robert Banks and was formally installed on December 12 of that year. In address to sexual abuse scandals, Zubik met with representatives of the Survivors Network of those Abused by Priests (SNAP), but was criticized by the group for not disclosing the names of priests who were accused of sexual abuse but never sued or charged with a crime. During the 2004 presidential election, he urged Catholics to consider the Church's teachings on abortion and same-sex marriage before casting their votes. Although he has said that pro-choice Catholic politicians should refrain from receiving Communion, Zubik has also stated he would not refuse Communion to those figures. He opposes capital punishment, and supports immigration reform. Bishop of Pittsburgh Pope Benedict XVI appointed Bishop Zubik the twelfth Bishop of Pittsburgh on July 18, 2007, ending a 14-month-long vacancy. He received the call of appointment from the charg√© d'affaires at the office of the then-Apostolic Nuncio (Papal Ambassador) to the U.S., the late Archbishop Pietro Sambi, at 3:35 PM on July 9, the exact time of his birth. He was installed on September 28, 2007. Bishop Zubik declined to take up residence at the episcopal mansion on Warwick Terrace, which had been the home of the bishops of Pittsburgh since 1949, and instead settled at Saint Paul Seminary, saying that the Church needed to move away from being \\"attached to buildings.\\" In April 2009, he held a widely publicized Service of Apology at St. Paul Cathedral, where he begged the \\"forgiveness of anyone hurt by the Church... in any way.\\" Under Bishop Zubik, the diocese implemented a policy of reporting all allegations of sexual abuse to law enforcement. Zubik handed off the case of Rev. David Dzermejko to the Vatican after a diocese review board found that allegations of child sexual abuse against Dzermejko were credible. Dzermejko was removed as pastor of Mary, Mother of the Church in Charleroi in June 2009 after a couple informed the diocese that he had sexually abused their son. Another man came forward to say that Dzermejko had abused him as a child. Dzermejko was removed within 48 hours of the diocese receiving the first allegation. Bishop Zubik said that neither he nor his predecessor Archbishop Wuerl, tried to cover up the sexual abuse of children documented in a grand jury report released by the Pennsylvania attorney general. Zubik apologized for the abuse, \\"In the name of the Church of Pittsburgh, and in my own name, and in the name of my predecessors, we are sorry. I am sorry.\\" Zubik also stated that the details of the report disgusted him. Zubik offered to apologize in person to victims but acknowledged that apologies would not be enough.https://triblive.com/local/allegheny/13973429-74/pittsburgh-bishop- zubik-apologizes-for-abuse-in-diocese-denies-cover-up Pennsylvania Attorney General Shapiro accused Zubik of lying about there not being a cover-up. Zubik responded in a statement widely disseminated to the media. Part of the statement reads, \\"The Diocese of Pittsburgh is not the church described in the report. That means that the report ignores 30 years of reforms and actions to protect children and identify and remove abusing priests from ministry.\\" Another paragraph states, \\"The truth is that 90 percent of the incidents of abuse occurred before 1990, and the efforts we have made to protect children ‚Äî such as turning over allegations to law enforcement, creating the first Independent Review Board and training more than 70,000 people on how to look for and report abuse ‚Äî have significantly reduced the incidents of abuse.\\"https://triblive.com/state/pennsylvania/14019624-74/attorney-general- pittsburgh-bishop-zubik-not-telling-the-truth Bishop Zubik described the University of Notre Dame's decision to have President Barack Obama deliver its commencement speech and receive an honorary degree as \\"painful\\" and \\"embarrassing,\\" noting that Obama is \\"the single most outspoken pro-abortion president since the issue was foisted upon the country by the Supreme Court.\\" Zubik is a proponent of \\"comprehensive immigration reform\\" stating: \\"We need to give the immigrants of our century the same latitude that we gave the immigrants of the last century.\\"Matthew Santoni, \\"Catholic Bishop Zubik prays for immigration reform\\", Pittsburgh Tribune, November 24, 2013. Sex Abuse Lawsuits On August 7, 2020, it was revealed that Zubik was named as a defendant in a new sex abuse lawsuit which was filed in Allegheny County Common Pleas Court.https://triblive.com/local/pittsburgh-allegheny/lawsuit- against-catholic-diocese-of-pittsburgh-accuses-priest-of-rape/ The lawsuit claims that despite former Pittsburgh Bishop Donald Wuerl's promise in 1994 that Rev. Leo Burchianti- who was accused of sexually abusing at least eight boys- would not receive a new church assignment, Wuerl and then-Father Zubik gave him a voluntary work assignment at St. John Vianney Manor, a home for retired priests. Burchianti remained there from 1995 to 2012 and died in 2013.

The Urbana‚ÄìChampaign site stopped accepting new students after Fall 2016 to make room for the newly established Carle Illinois College of Medicine. In 2011, enrollment of medical students in the University of Illinois system totaled 1,290 according to the Association of American Medical Colleges. History The College of Medicine, originally an independent institution, opened on September 26, 1882 as the College of Physicians and Surgeons of Chicago (P&S;) with 100 students and a faculty of 30. Five years later, the Board of Trustees of the University of Illinois approved a contract of affiliation whereby the university would lease P&S; as its Department of Medicine. The arrangement continued until 1912 when there was a nine-month hiatus in the affiliation due to a lack of legislative support. It was only after the faculty and alumni of P&S; bought up all shares of the school's stock and presented them to the Board of Trustees as a gift that the school officially became the College of Medicine of the University of Illinois in March 1913. In the late 1800s, although six medical schools were already in existence, five physicians: Charles Warrington Earle, Abraham Reeves Jackson, Daniel Atkinson King Steele, Samuel McWilliams and Leonard St. John‚Äîdecided to open their own proprietary medical school. They pooled together $5,541.78, purchased a piece of land and secured a certificate of incorporation. The new school, located on Harrison and Honore streets, was named the College of Physicians and Surgeons of Chicago (commonly referred to as P&S;). Its doors opened on Sept. 26, 1882, with a class of 100 students and a faculty of 27 physicians. At the West Side Free Dispensary, located on the first floor of the medical school, students in small groups could observe pathological cases and their treatment. Patients were classified according to the affected area or system of the body: heart, lungs, eyes, ears, skin or nervous system. The dispensary also furnished material for college clinics in medicine, surgery, gynecology, obstetrics, ophthalmology, neurology and pediatrics. In its first three years, the dispensary registered 20,353 patients and dispensed 17,347 prescriptions. In 1913, after years of negotiations, the P&S; faculty and alumni donated stock to the University of Illinois Board of Trustees to establish the University of Illinois College of Medicine. In 1970, the Illinois legislature voted to expand the college to three additional sites: Peoria, Rockford and Urbana. Their purpose was to provide access to care for all citizens in the state and increase opportunities for Illinois residents to attend medical school. Present status The College of Medicine has a faculty of approximately 4,000 across the four sites. The surrounding health science center, of which the University of Illinois at Chicago College of Medicine is a part, also comprises the University of Illinois Medical Center, the colleges of Nursing, Pharmacy, Dentistry, and Applied Health Sciences, and the School of Public Health. Campuses Chicago Campus Located in one of the world‚Äôs largest medical districts, medical students on the Chicago campus get early clinical experience. All students accompany physicians on rounds and learn to take patient histories starting in their first year. Fifty-three residency programs are available. In addition to serving as the Chicago program site, the Chicago campus of the College of Medicine is the administrative home for the dean and all other college-wide officers. Located on the Near West Side, the college is part of the University of Illinois Medical Center, which includes the colleges of Applied Health Sciences, Dentistry, Nursing, Pharmacy, and the School of Public Health. The College of Medicine's Chicago campus sits on a plot of land once occupied by West Side Park, the former home of the Chicago Cubs. Peoria Campus In Peoria, first through fourth-year students get clinical experience at Methodist Medical Center of Illinois, OSF Saint Francis Medical Center, Children‚Äôs Hospital of Illinois - the busiest pediatric hospital in central Illinois - Pekin Hospital, and Proctor Community Hospital. Rockford Campus The Rockford campus includes the Center for Rural Health Professions, which works to improve health and healthcare in rural communities. Rockford teaches first through fourth year medical students and offers a family medicine residency program. Urbana Campus This campus will be closed in 2022 to make room for the Carle Illinois College of Medicine. This extension is on the Urbana-Champaign campus of the University of Illinois and offers student education and research opportunities that includes collaboration with colleagues across campus. Urbana also hosts the dual-degree Medical Scholars Program. Curriculum The College of Medicine offers a Doctor of Medicine degree program (M.D.), a Doctor of Philosophy (Ph.D.) degree program in the medical sciences, and three joint degree programs: MD/PhD, MD/MPH, and MD/MBA. * The MD curriculum of the College of Medicine at Chicago is the largest of the college's programs. It provides instruction in basic and clinical sciences and early exposure to patients. The curriculum stresses rational decision making and clinical problem solving based on an understanding of the basic biological, physical, and behavioral sciences; thus the integration of basic and clinical sciences is emphasized throughout the program. * Innovative Medicine, Urban Medicine, Rural Medicine, and Global Medicine Program for Medical Students. The College also offers an Innovative Medicine Program, Urban Medicine Program, Rural Medicine Program, and Global Medicine Program programs to accepted students. Each of these programs provide an extended curriculum and longitudinal community project opportunities to medical students throughout all four years of medical school that focus on four main themes such as: Disparities in Health Care Access and Outcomes, Community Based-Participatory Research, Diversity and Intercultural Communications, Policy and Advocacy, and more (Global Medicine, Rural Medicine, or Urban Medicine). * In addition to a traditional medical program, the College of Medicine offers two physician- scientist training programs: the Medical Scientist Training Program (MSTP) in Chicago, an NIH-funded program that offers full tuition benefits and a stipend to the awarded students, and the Medical Scholars Program (MSP) in Urbana- Champaign.

A meal at a cafe in Vitebsk Belarusian cuisine shares many similarities with cuisines of other Eastern, Central and Northeastern European countries, based predominantly on meat and various vegetables typical for the region. History Belarus cuisine has predominantly Slavic roots. Along with a Ruthenian influence, it is also linked with Lithuanian and Polish because of the long intermingling of these three peoples; first within the Grand Duchy of Lithuania (11th-15th centuries) and later within the Polish-Lithuanian Commonwealth (16th-17th centuries). Though the Belarusian nobility, like the Polish elite, borrowed much from Italian, German, and French cuisines, this influence hardly made itself felt in the diet of the peasant majority. Still, some of the borrowed dishes spread throughout the society, such as lazanki (a mixture of flour dumplings and stewed meat, related to Italian lasagna) and, above all, various dishes made of grated potatoes, typical for German cuisine. The political upheavals of the 20th century completely wiped out the former privileged classes and many traditional upper and middle class dishes went down the path of oblivion. The very idea of a separate Belarusian cuisine was treated with suspicion. Only after World War II did it occur to the communist authorities that the proclaimed ‚Äòflourishing of national culture‚Äô should also be evident in the cuisine. The only source permitted for such a culinary reconstruction was the heritage of the poorest peasants as of the 1880s, a time when primitive rural lifestyle was already on the wane. Chefs were instructed by the Party to create the new Belarusian cuisine from scratch. Dish names, recipes, \\"authentic\\" kitchenware ‚Äì all were reinvented anew, as though ten centuries of history had never existed. Only the sudden advent of independence in 1991 brought an opportunity to restore these lost traditions, and a great deal still remains to be done here. Modern Belarusian cuisine is still heavily influenced by its recent Soviet past, and many local restaurants feature Russian or Soviet dishes rather than true specialties of local cuisine. Some Belarusians may have more interest in Italian, Chinese, and Japanese cuisine than in their own culinary heritage. However, draniki (both plain and stuffed), bor≈°ƒç, cha≈Çadnik, maƒçanka, zrazy, cold meat rolls, eggs stuffed with mushrooms, ha≈Çubcy, fried raw pork sausage and bliny are likely to be found everywhere, as well as sour rye bread. Meals A traditional peasant or merchant's dinner consisted of just two dishes: soup and a main course. A special kind of pot, the sparysh, with two compartments, was used by farmers' children to bring lunch to their father working in the fields. Prior to World War II, salads or other snacks were not very common, and recipes based on Russian models tended to appear in modern Belarusian postwar cookbooks. Fresh white cheese and various kinds of cold meats (usually smoked) were available, however, at least on holidays. Cereals Since wheat does not grow well in a cold and wet climate, Belarusians were always fond of a kind of somewhat sour rye bread, and the most traditional hard drink, the local vodka or harelka (), was distilled primarily from a rye malt. Like other Slavic peoples, Belarusians could boast of a huge variety of bliny (pancakes) of various thickness, plain and filled, made mostly of wheat or buckwheat flour, but also using oatmeal (tsadaviki). Various kinds of cereal especially barley, oatmeal and buckwheat were common. Belarus was the likely centre of Europe's buckwheat culture, and dishes made with this healthy grain used to be very popular: various kinds of buns, cakes and dumplings which, except for the well-known \\"kasha\\", no longer exist today. Vegetables The main vegetables were cabbage (often made into sauerkraut) and beets, while turnips, swedes, parsnip and carrots both stewed and boiled (with the addition of a small amount of milk) were somewhat less popular. As elsewhere in Europe, legumes were the main source of protein, mainly in the form of kamy (puree of peas or beans with melted lard). Soups The word soup was not known in Belarus until the 18th century when the nobility borrowed it from German, but soup as a type of dish clearly existed centuries earlier. The old word for most traditional Belarusian soups was poli≈≠ka (), except for those named after the vegetable that was the main ingredient: kapusta (cabbage soup), buraki (beet soup), gry≈æanka (swede soup). For a typical poli≈≠ka the major ingredients (fish or mushrooms during fasts) were first boiled with spices; cereals such as barley or millet were boiled in the stock, and then flour blended with water, bread kvass, beet juice or buttermilk was added to the stock. Black poli≈≠ka, made with goose or pork blood, is closely related to the Swedish \\"black soup\\" svartsoppa. Offering a matchmaker black poli≈≠ka was the polite way for the bride's parents to decline a young man's proposal. Like the Ukrainians, Russians and Poles, Belarusians are fond of borscht, a thick and rich beet and cabbage soup made with grains, potato and meat. Soups are much more authentic, both hot (shchi, bor≈°ƒç, sorrel soup) and especially cold sour soups which provide cooling relief during the hot summer. The Belarusian chaladnik (), a cold borscht made of beets, beet leaves or sorrel and served with sour cream, hard-boiled eggs, and boiled potatoes, has been a popular dish also in Polish and Lithuanian cuisines since the late 18th century. Meat Wrapped palyandvitsa Sliced palyandvitsa Meat was in rather scarce supply for most people, and was primarily eaten only on the main Christian holidays. Avid consumers of pork, Belarusians are less partial to mutton and beef. Most common was raw pork sausage ‚Äì a pig intestine stuffed with minced or chopped meat seasoned with salt, pepper, and garlic. Its common name ‚Äì \\"finger-stuffed sausage\\" ( or in short –ø–∞–ª—å—Ü–æ—û–∫–∞) ‚Äì provided a graphic description of the primitive production technology.\\"Finger-stuffed\\" sausage : history and description Kishk–∞ (), or kryvyanka (), was a local blood sausage () made of pig‚Äôs blood and buckwheat grain. ≈†kalondza (), or kindziuk (), a particular kind of round sausage made of pig stomach filled with pork minced with spicesKindziuk recipe and description ‚Äì a relative of the Lithuanian skilandis ‚Äì was known throughout the country. Borrowed from Italian cuisine by nobility in the 16th century, cold meat rolls, salcesons and balerons were common to all of society by the 19th century, and are still very popular. Smoked goose breast pauguski (), a local Belarusian and Lithuanian delicacy, was once the pride of middle-class cuisine, but no longer exists today. Vera≈°ƒçaka (), an 18th-century thick meat gravy with pieces of meat and sausage used as a dip or sauce for thick pancakes, is still one of the most popular specialties of Belarusian restaurants today, although it is now generally called maƒçanka (, a dip). Also popular are zrazy, chopped pieces of beef rolled into a sausage shape and filled with vegetable, mushroom, eggs, potato etc. Pork dishes are usually fried or stewed, garnished with cheese or mushrooms. Beef steaks are also quite frequent, but mutton, once very popular, is almost entirely limited to Caucasian or Central Asian restaurants, although still quite a few eat it today. Dumplings Kalduny, small boiled dumplings related to Russian pelmeni and Italian ravioli, were produced in endless combinations of dough, filling and sauce. Especially popular were kalduny Count Tyshkevich (filled with a mixture of fried local mushrooms and smoked ham). In the late 19th century kalduny began to be made with grated potato rather than with a flour- based dough and the former huge variety of fillings shrank considerably. Today, kalduny have to struggle vigorously to regain their former popularity, now overtaken by the Russian pelmeni. Dairy products The main dairy products include a kind of fresh white cheese () and sour cream (), which is widely used both in cooking and as a garnish. Only in the mid-19th century was fermented cheese () borrowed from the Netherlands and Switzerland, and the local version of Edam was very popular for decades in the Russian Empire. Sour butter from the former Dzisna county was exported to Britain, where it continued to be the most expensive variety up to World War I. Today, however, these traditions have become a thing of the past. Beverages A mug of kvass, a fermented beverage made from black rye or rye bread The traditional hard drink is vodka or harelka (), including varieties made from birch sap (biarozavik, ) or flavored with forest herbs (zubrovka, ). Mead and similar alcoholic drinks made of honey and spices were very common up until the 19th century and then more or less disappeared until the latest revival of the national cuisine. A notable example in this group is krambambula (), vodka diluted with water, mixed with honey, and flavored with spices (nutmeg, cinnamon, cloves, red and black pepper). In the 18th century this drink competed with French champagne in Belarus and only wealthy people could afford it. Today it is enjoying a popular revival, as is evident from the appearance of krambambula recipes and histories on the Internet.Krambambula: modern recipe History of krambambula Kvass traditionally was and still remains the main local non-alcoholic drink, although it is increasingly made with sugars and artificial flavorings rather than with genuine rye malt and natural flavorings. Kompot is also a relatively popular beverage, normally made of dried or fresh fruit, boiled, and then cooled. Every small town boasts a local variety of mineral water. Belarusians prefer carbonated water. –¢raditional liquid desserts that accompany a meal include saladucha (), a thick liquid made of rye flour and honey that was popular in the 18th century, and kissel, the traditional jelly drink of Eastern Europe made from the pulp of forest berries or cooked fruits, originally thickened with oatmeal (now replaced by potato starch flour or cornstarch). Minority cuisines Belarusian potato babka Belarusian cuisine owes much to Jewish cooking. In the 19th century, Jewish influence was especially noticeable in bringing in potato dishes of German origin, such as babka. This was a two-way gastronomic street, for the famous bulbe latkes, the potato pancakes of the East European Jews, may have been borrowed from the Belarusian draniki. Another important minority ethnic group which influenced Belarusian cuisine were the Lipka Tatars, whose Tatar cuisine was especially strong in various cakes with fillings, mutton and vegetable dishes. Potatoes The potato became so common in 19th century ‚Äì there are some 300+ dishes recorded in Belarus ‚Äì that it came to be considered the core of the national cuisine. In the Soviet Union, Belarusians were sometimes called bulbashi, a pejorative conjugation of the Belarusian word for potato. Salads Typical salads are made of a fairly short list of ingredients: endless combinations of boiled beef or chicken, potato, beet, carrot, apple, herring, diced cheese, canned peas and corn, canned fish, ‚Äòcrab fingers‚Äô, onions and mushrooms, and are generously seasoned with mayonnaise or sunflower oil. One of the most typical local salads is the \\"Belaya Vezha\\" salad (named after the Belaya Vezha Forest), which combines boiled chicken meat with fried mushrooms, onions, and pickled cucumbers, mixed with mayonnaise and garnished with chopped hard-boiled egg.\\"Belaya Vezha\\" salad : recipe Fresh vegetable salads are also widely available: tomatoes (also mixed with cucumbers) and onions seasoned with sour cream, radishes with dill and sunflower oil (or sourcream) shredded cabbage salad seasoned with sunflower oil or mayonnaise (similar to coleslaw), pickled cabbage with caraway seeds or cranberries with onions seasoned with sunflower oil. Fish Historically, Belarusians had little access to seafood, and this is still evident in the cuisine. The most common sea fish (after herring, which has been the most common appetizer all along the Baltic coast and its vicinity ever since the 14th century) are hake and cod and there are relatively few dishes with such fish. Much more traditional and common are lake fish, notably zander, cooked in endless ways, and carp (especially the famous stuffed carp, the gefilte fish of Jewish cuisine). Eels, smoked or stuffed, are the specialty of the lake country in the northwestern part of Belarus, adjacent to Latvia and Lithuania. Side dishes Side dishes are usually boiled, fried or mashed potatoes, buckwheat kasha, rice or pasta. Meat dishes are frequently served with bliny or draniki stacked in round clay pots.

Built in the Gothic style, its construction started in 1421. Its tower, with a height of , was only completed in 1893. It is the tallest cathedral in Switzerland and is a Cultural Property of National Significance. The building Plan of the Cathedral, showing construction phases The Minster of Bern is located on the southern side of the Aare peninsula. The cathedral is oriented east and west like the rest of the Old City of Bern. To the north, M√ºnstergasse runs along the side of the building. The west fa√ßade of the M√ºnster dominates M√ºnsterplatz. On the south side of the cathedral is the M√ºnsterplattform. It is a three nave basilica without a transept. The entire cathedral is long and wide. The central nave is long by wide and is high. The two side naves are very similar in dimensions, the north nave is long, while the southern one is slightly longer at . They are both wide and high. The altar house and choir together are long, wide and high. The cathedral has a single tower in the west, which is high. Below the tower, there is a long by wide, tower hall. There are a total of ten bays in the building. The central nave has five of these bays. Each of the side naves has two bays, with side chapels built against the exterior walls. The last bay is within the choir. The central nave walls are supported by fourteen flying buttresses. Each buttress starts at a decorated column which rises above the roof of the side naves and side chapels. The buttresses rise at an angle of 43¬∞ 30‚Äô. The lower side of the buttresses are decorated with egg-shaped cut outs, with vesica piscis and spandrel designs. The majority of the building is built from local sandstone. The vaults are built of brick. In the 18th Century, limestone sheathing was added to the pillars. Most of the sandstone came from a quarry at Ostermundingen. Additional material came from three other quarries, each with differing color and quality. The various stone types were used more or less randomly throughout the entire building. The pillar bases, capitals, windows and sculptures are all from the highest quality, blue sandstone from the Gurten quarry, south of Bern. During reconstruction projects in the 19th and 20th Centuries, several other sandstone types were used. West fa√ßade and tower Minster in 1800, before the upper tower was finished The three west entrances of the cathedral are located at the back of three large portals. Each of the portals is a different height and differently shaped and decorated. The central portal is decorated with a series of statues that represent the Last Judgment in Christian theology. The bell tower grew in several stages. The lower, rectangular tower was the original tower. The octagonal upper tower was added in the 19th Century. The lower tower is flanked by two round towers and eight pillars. To the north and south, it is supported by buttresses that rise above the northern and southern main portals. The west face of the tower rises above a gallery above the central, west portal. The east face is supported by the central nave. The decoration on the western face of the tower has changed several times over the centuries. The lower, western window is quite short but wide. The upper section of the rectangular tower rises above a second gallery. It has a high, but narrow window directly above the gallery. The decorations of this section are the work of two master stonemasons, and This section shows much less variation in the design as it was built completely under the direction of these two men. The original tower was capped with a pyramidal roof, elements of which still exist. The two small, stairway towers were built as part of the tower, but were completely rebuilt in the 17th and 18th Centuries. The lower octagonal tower was built in the 16th Century. It has eight, round arch windows. Two hexagonal staircase towers are built outside the tower near the northeast and southeast windows. The small towers are completely self-supporting. The upper octagonal tower was built in the 19th Century in a gothic style. However, some of the ornamentation is based on early 15th Century designs and stands out against the 16th Century lower octagonal tower. History View of the tower showing the lower and upper octagonsFront view of the Bern cathedral during outside renovations The first church on this site probably was a small chapel built during the founding of Bern (1191). The first church of Bern was a romanesque building which was probably built between 1155‚Äì1160, but is first mentioned in 1224. This church was outside the city walls, near what is now Kreuzgasse. The nave of the first church was about long by wide. In 1276, Bern broke away from the parish of K√∂niz to become an independent parish. For this new role, a larger church would have been necessary. It appears likely that construction on the second church began immediately. However, it isn't mentioned until 1289 in writings of Bishop Benvenutus von Eugubio. This new church was a three nave building, with a length of , a width of of which the middle nave was wide. The bell tower was located in the middle of the northern side nave, and filled part of the central nave. The 1356 Basel earthquake caused extensive damage to the church walls, arches, and tower. Repairs proceeded slowly. The choir was rebuilt in 1359 and the roof was rebuilt in 1378‚Äì80. During the early stages of construction of the Minster, this church was still being used. The nave was finally demolished between 1449‚Äì51 and the tower remained until 1493. By the 15th Century, Bern had expanded and become a major city-state north of the Alps. To celebrate their growing power and wealth, plans were made to build a new and larger church. On 11 March 1421 construction began on the cathedral under the direction of the Strasbourg master builder , who had already built three other cathedrals. During construction, services were held in the old chapel while the new cathedral was built up around it.Sacred Destinations.com During the 1440s the unvaulted choir was used for services after a simple roof was built and stained glass windows were installed. After the Old Z√ºrich War 1440‚Äì1446 the nave of the old chapel was removed and work began on the nave and west end, under the chief masons Stefan Hurder and then Niklaus Birenvogt. In 1483 (who carved the statues of the Last Judgement) became the master mason. Under his direction the nave walls were raised and the tower was built to the lower octagon. Construction on the lower rectangular tower began in 1481 or 1483 and continued until 1489. The upper rectangular section was built between 1489 and 1518. Following K√ºng's death in 1506, lead the construction and finished the vaulting in the choir. The lower octagonal tower and roof were finished between 1518 and 1521. In 1571 was brought in as master mason to finish vaulting the nave and finish the work. The central nave was finished by 1575 and at this point, construction stopped for almost three centuries. The organ was installed in three stages between 1727 and 1783. The bell tower, with the largest bell in Switzerland, wasn't completed until 1893. The Reformation in Bern The interior of the Minster has been very austere since the iconoclasm of the 16th Century In 1515, Thomas Wyttenbach, Huldrych Zwingli's teacher, became a priest at the Minster of Bern. In the latter part of Wyttenbach's stay in Bern, a local priest, Berchtold Haller, lived with him. Around the time that Wyttenbach left Bern in 1520 to become a Reformer of his birthplace, Biel, Haller was elected a canon of the cathedral. In 1521, he became friends with Zwingli in Zurich and began to preach more Protestant sermons. In February, 1522, two Fastnacht plays were given at Bern, which attacked the Catholic Church. Due to the rising reformist sentiment, in June 1523, the city council ordered that the words of the Bible should be preached. By 20 November of that year, the nuns left the convent in Bern. But in 1524 the priest Meier, who sympathized with Haller, was compelled to leave Bern. That left Haller the only Protestant among the priests. Then, on 7 April 1525, the council issued a new decree restoring the Catholic worship, though with a few changes. In the following year, the plague came to Bern. The deaths due to the plague converted many of the citizens to the Reformation. In 1527 the Reformed party gained the control of the great council, and it ordered that the new faith should be preached. Still there was a conflict about the mass, as some congregations still observed it. It was decided that there should be a religious disputation at Bern, on 6 January 1528, to settle these questions. On 27 January 1528, the council ordered that throughout the city, all masses should be stopped and all icons should be cast out. On 7 February 1528, it ordered the same for the whole canton. In April 1528, a Protestant service was first celebrated in the Minster. Today's congregation forms part of the Reformed Churches of the Canton Bern-Jura-Solothurn. The Last Judgement Main entrance. Details of the Last Judgement. Over the main portal is one of the most complete Late Gothic sculpture collections in Europe. This collection represents the Christian belief in a Last Judgment where the wicked will be separated from the righteous. This sculpture shows the wicked naked on the right, while the righteous stand clothed in white on the left. In the center is Justice, with Saints and the wise and foolish virgins around her. In the centre stands Michael the Archangel with a raised sword. The sculptures of the Last Judgement were the only statues in the Minster to survive the iconoclasm of the Protestant Reformation. The 47 large free-standing statues are replicas (the originals are in Bern History Museum), and the 170 smaller figures are all original. The Last Judgement was the work of one sculptor, Erhard K√ºng from Stadtlohn, Westphalia, which gives the collection a unity of design. The Justice sculpture is the only one that was done by another artist. It is signed by Daniel Heintz, who was the master builder after 1571. The rest of the statues were carved some time between 1460 and 1501, most likely between 1460 and 1480. The trumeau to each side and between the doors has thirteen life-size figures. The middle figure and the two figures on each side of the door are raised by about half their height above the other figures. The figures on the left of the door represent the five Foolish Virgins while the ones on the right are the Wise Virgins. Below the outer two Wise Virgins and the two Foolish Virgins, two faces peer out of the wall on each side. On the wise side, they represent the Queen of Sheba and King Solomon. On the foolish side, they represent Zephaniah and, maybe, Isaiah. In the center, between the two doors, is Justice flanked by two angels. Below Justice and the angels is a scroll commemorating the laying of the cornerstone in 1421. The archivolt features three rows of figures. The inner two rows are attached to the wall and lay at an angle which follows the curve of the portal. The outer, third row features statues that stand upright on individual platforms. The inner row contains five angels with the instruments of the Passion. The second row contains eight Old Testament prophets. The outer row is Jesus, Mary and the Apostles, including John the Baptist and Paul, but not Judas Iscariot. The tympanum is wide at the base. It is made up of thirteen individual sections. The bottom row is made up of three plates located about above the lintel. It is deep and about high. On the left side of the tympanum, it contains two rows of figures and on the right, three. The lower figures are nearly fully three- dimensional, while the upper figures are mostly carved in relief, with only the head and shoulders projecting out of the stone. Above these three plates, the remaining ten plates are arraigned in three rows. The bottom row is made up of four plates which rest on a high base. The plates are high relief carvings, each about deep and an average of about high. The figures were all carved with a rock pick. In the center of the tympanum is the Archangel Michael. He stands on his platform which is projected forward from the rest of the figures. The entire tympanum represents Heaven and Hell in the Last Judgment.  Interior  A view of the vaulted ceiling of showing the extensive lace-like structure The Minster was built by the city of Bern as a symbol of the growing power of this city-state.Official Church Website, in German The interior was therefore designed to awe the citizens as well as foreign visitors. The central nave was built in a lacy gothic style with enormous stained glass windows and numerous altars in side chapels. The Gothic style allowed a taller central nave and larger windows than had been possible before, creating an impressive and (for the time) light and airy structure. Altars Many altars were financed by local families, creating a wealth of art and sculpture in the cathedral. However, in 1528 all 43 side altars were removed during the iconoclasm of the Protestant Reformation. Nearly all the interior paintings and decorations were removed and dumped in the neighboring M√ºnsterplattform. The empty chapels were filled with extra pews, creating three naves. Since that time, the interior of the cathedral has remained relatively empty and austere. Stained glass Bible scenes, Passion/Ten thousand martyrs and Christ windows in the Choir The stained glass windows of the cathedral are considered the most valuable in Switzerland. Some of the windows date from 1441‚Äì1450. The right hand windows were damaged during a hailstorm in 1520 and replaced in 1868. Many of the windows include both heraldic symbols and religious images placed side by side. The windows are wide in the middle and high. Most of the windows have twenty lower panels, each by , and twenty upper panels, each by . There are seven windows in the choir of the Minster. Some of the panels have been moved or replaced since the windows were originally built. Facing the choir, from left to right, the current windows are: Hostienm√ºhle, Three Kings, Bible scenes, Passion/Ten thousand martyrs, Christ, Stephanus and Coat of Arms windows. Only portions of the Passion and Ten thousand martyrs windows remain, so they were combined into a single window. The Christ window was added to replace the damaged Ten thousand martyrs window. The Stephanus and Coat of Arms windows replaced earlier, unknown windows. The Hostienm√ºhle window was built between 1448‚Äì1453 and was funded by the city of Bern. The Three Kings window was built between 1447 and 1455 for Rudolf von Ringoltingen, possibly in Constance or the Oberrhein region. The Bible scenes window was originally supposed to be just of the young Christ, but was changed after 1447. It was built between 1448 and 1451 and was funded by three members of the Gesellschaft zum Mittell√∂wen. The Passion window was built between 1438 and 1441. Only 21 panels of the original window remain. It was built for the city through the Schulthei√ü by Hans Acker in Ulm. The Ten thousand martyrs window was originally supposed to be of the Resurrection of Jesus, but that was changed after 1447. It was built between 1447 and 1449 and was funded by donations from the citizens of Bern. It was built by Master Painter Bernhart and glazier Niklaus Magerfritz in Bern. The Ten thousand martyrs window was replaced in 1868 by the Christ window. The Stephanus window replaced an earlier window in 1868. The theme of the original window is unknown but it was built in 1449‚Äì1451 for Kaspar von Scharnachtal, probably by Niklaus Magerfritz in Bern. The Coat of Arms window was built in 1820‚Äì30 to replace an earlier, unknown window. Dance of Death stained glass window. Images of death claiming people from all walks of life were very common during the Black Plague in Europe. One very interesting window is the \\"Dance of Death\\" window located near the choir on the south side nave. The first Dance of Death plays originated during the Black Death of the 14th Century and remained popular during the 14th and 15th Century. By 1425, the figures from the plays appeared in the cemetery of the Church of the Holy Innocents in Paris. The figures on the M√ºnster window were done by Niklaus Manuel between 1516 and 1519. The stained glass window in the Cathedral is an excellent example of this theme. The window shows death, in the form of a skeleton, claiming people from every station in life. The Dance of Death served to remind the viewer that death will happen to everyone regardless of station or wealth. Choir stalls Carved figures on some of the Choir Stalls The Choir, in the eastern side of the Cathedral between the nave and the sanctuary, houses the first Renaissance Choir Stalls in Switzerland. There are 21 seats on the Evangelisten side and 27 on the Epistel side. The stalls are richly carved with both animals and images of daily life. In 1517, the town council hired Bernhard Burenfind from Solothurn to build the stalls. He began selecting and cutting oak wood for the stalls. However, for an unknown reason, he did not complete the work and was not asked to complete any other projects in Bern. On 26 September 1522, Bern tried to hire a master carpenter from Schaffhausen for 30 pounds. In the same year, Niklaus Manuel and three others were sent to Geneva to examine the choir stalls there. On 5 December 1522, Jacob Ruess and Heini Seewagen from Schaffhausen were hired to complete the work on the stalls. They were paid much more than the 30 pounds that Bern had wanted to pay. They were paid 300 pounds in 1522, followed by 150 in the next year, 300 in 1524. They finished the work in 1525. The original stalls were repaired and renovated in 1863‚Äì64 and the carvings were repaired in 1897. Organ The Cathedral Organ sits above the main entrance. The first organ in the Cathedral was built nearly 200 years after construction was completed. The first great organ was built in 1726‚Äì30. The town council voted to have the organ built on 5 June 1726. They hired Gottlieb Leuw from Bremgarten in September 1726. By January 1730 his work was nearly finished and the town began searching for an organist. While the main organ was finished in 1730, the ornamentation and finish work continued until 1736. This first organ had 38 organ stops, with a breast and back work as well as an echo work with pedals. In 1746, the council decided that the organ needed to be rebuilt. On 16 September 1748, they reached an agreement with Victor Ferdinard Bossart to do so. On 1 June 1752, they signed a contract with Johann August Nahl to do the exterior decoration on the new organ. The rebuilt organ had 43 organ stops, and was built in a late-baroque style. It was renovated in 1827. When the new organ balcony and screen were built in 1845‚Äì48 above the western entrance by Beat Rudolf von Sinner, the organ was completely rebuilt and was known as the second organ. The organ builder Friedrich Haas from Winterthur increased the number of stops to 55. The number of consoles was changed to three. The third organ was built in 1903/04 by Friedrich Groll from Lucerne. While the exterior remained virtually untouched, the interior was rebuilt. Pneumatic tubes, slider chests and a mechanical action were added to the organ. However, the sound produced by this new organ was unpleasant. The interior of the organ was completely rebuilt in 1930. The 1930 organ is the current one in the cathedral. It was restored in 1998‚Äì1999. The organ is currently used for a series of concerts throughout the year. Bell tower The tower is open to the public, for a small fee. The lower viewing platform requires a climb up 254 steps and provides a view over Bern and perhaps as far as the Alps. The upper spire is also accessible by climbing an additional 90 steps from the lower platform.City of Bern Tourism Site The largest bell in the tower is a 10.5 ton bell which was cast in 1611. It is the largest bell in Switzerland. The bells in the tower are rung daily at noon and at 6 p.m. It is possible to stand near the bells when they are rung, but it is necessary to cover one's ears to prevent hearing damage. M√ºnsterplattform (Minster Terrace) The Minster Terrace (in German: M√ºnsterplattform) was built during 1334 and the mid 15th Century as a large churchyard. During the Protestant Reformation the paintings and statues of the Cathedral altars were dumped in the churchyard. Some of the art work has been found in archeological digs conducted on the terrace. During the 20th century, the terrace was changed from a graveyard to an open plaza. Lime and chestnut trees were planted and pathways were laid out, providing a pleasant park in the old city. The terrace towers over the Matte section of the old city and the Aare. Panorama from the Minster.

The hobnailed jackboot has a different design and function than the first type. It is a combat boot that is designed for marching. It rises to mid-calf or higher with no laces and usually has a leather sole with hobnails. Jackboots have been associated with totalitarianism, as they were worn by German military and paramilitary forces during the Second World War. Cavalry jackboot The term originally denoted tall winged leather cavalry boots, which were reinforced against sword blows by use of mail sewn into the lining of the leather. The wings on these high boots particularly protected a rider's knee-joint from a sword blow. These boots are still worn and still so termed by the Household Cavalry regiment of the British Army, founded in the 17th century. The term originates from the French word jaque meaning \\"coat of mail\\".Longman Dictionary of Contemporary EnglishChambers's Etymological Dictionary of the English Languagejaque in the Tr√©sor de la langue fran√ßaise informatis√© (The Digitized Treasury of the French Language). These boots were made very heavy by the mail reinforcement and are slightly less so today from the use of modern materials as stiffeners. There are few manufacturers of cavalry jackboots extant in the 21st century, the most famous being Schnieder Boots of Mayfair, London, the official supplier to Her Majesty the Queen's Household Cavalry. Hobnailed jackboot German jackboots from 1914 German soldiers wearing jackboots with an M47 tank in the background, 1960 A modern American motor officer in his jackboots The second meaning of the term is derived from the first, with reference to their toughness, but is unrelated in design and function, being a combat boot designed for marching, rising to at least mid-calf, with no laces, typically a leather sole with hobnails, and heel irons.dress Colonial America - Britannica Online EncyclopediaShoes: their history in words and pictures By Charlotte Yue, David Yue , p. 43 The Germans call this boot Marschstiefel, meaning \\"marching boot\\". This is the classic boot used by the German infantry in World War I, though the stormtroopers dispensed with them in favor of laced boots then used by Austro-Hungarian mountain troops.Gudmundsson, Bruce, Stormtroop Tactics: Innovation in the German Army, 1914‚Äì1918, (New York: Praeger Publishing, 1989), 51 An etymological source not derived from the cavalry jackboot has been suggested as from the word jack, jacket or jerkin, as a common garment worn by the peasantry.\\"Jack\\", 11th Edition of Encyclop√¶dia Britannica Although hobnailed short jackboots date from before the Napoleonic era, they became popular with the Germanic armies in the mid to late 19th century because of their perceived durability. Worn out boots were considered a major problem for armies on the march, and the high-quality leather \\"jackboot\\" with its hobnails was deemed to be more durable than the alternatives available. As Prussia and the associated smaller German states relied on quickly defeating its opponents before they could fully mobilize and coordinate, their infantry's ability to march long distances was a major issue. The jackboot was replaced by poorer quality ankle boots in the German army when leather became scarce during World War II. The legging of the boot was shortened to a standard in order to save leather, without negating its protective value, especially on the Eastern Front. The previous issue boots were as tall as riding boots, reaching almost to the knees. As a metaphor Stalin's Boots\\", a monument in Hungary Totalitarianism The boots are connected to fascism, particularly Nazism, as they were worn by the Sturmabteilung and later the field forces of the Wehrmacht and Waffen-SS as part of the World War II German uniform before Germany encountered leather shortages. When goose-stepping on pavement, the large columns of German soldiers in Marschstiefel (\\"marching boots\\") created a distinct rock-crushing sound which came to symbolize German conquest and occupation. A similar style of boot had been in use with German armies in World War I, the Franco-Prussian War, and before. Modern Russian army sapogi Jackboots were also associated with the armies of the former USSR (called sapogi) and East Germany. Jackboots are still a part of the modern parade and service attire of the army of Russia and several other former Soviet states. The word is commonly used in English as a synonym for totalitarianism, particularly fascism, although jackboots and similar types of footwear have been worn by various British regiments since the 18th century (see Wellington boot, origins). Following the 1982 invasion of the Falkland Islands, British Prime Minister Margaret Thatcher declared that the democratic rights of the Falkland Islanders had been assaulted, and would not surrender the islands to the Argentine \\"jackboot\\". In the United States in October 1993, the National Rifle Association (NRA) ran a four-page ad in the center of its American Rifleman magazine, the first page of which showed goose-stepping, jackbooted legs under the question, \\"What's the First Step to a Police State?\\" Two years later, the NRA's executive vice-president, Wayne LaPierre, sparked controversy when he referred to federal agents as \\"jackbooted government thugs\\" in an NRA fund-raising letter. The term had been coined by United States Representative John Dingell, Democrat of Michigan, in 1981. Such statements prompted former U.S. president George H. W. Bush to resign his membership in the organization soon after. Oppression The Russian expression \\"–ü–æ–¥ –ø—è—Ç–æ–π\\" (pod pyatoj) translates as \\"under one's heel\\" and symbolizes oppression. The Spanish expression \\"tener (algo o alguien) bajo la bota\\" or \\"to have (something or somebody) under the boot\\" has the same meaning.

The original band consisted of Howard Werth (born Howard Alexander Werth, 26 March 1947, The Mother's Hospital, Clapton, East London) on nylon-strung electric acoustic guitar and vocals; Keith Gemmell (born Keith William Gemmell, 15 February 1948, Hackney Hospital, Hackney, East London - died 24 July 2016, Beltinge, Kent) on alto and tenor saxophone, flute and clarinet; Trevor Williams (born Trevor Leslie Williams, 19 January 1945, Hereford General Hospital, Hereford, Herefordshire) on bass guitar and vocals; and Tony Connor (born Anthony John Connor, 6 April 1947, Romford, Havering) on drums and vocals. Formation Audience rose from the ashes of a semi-professional soul band named 'Lloyd Alexander Real Estate', which had included all the Audience members except Connor, who had unsuccessfully auditioned for the earlier band when John Richardson left to form The Rubettes. However, when Werth, Williams, and Gemmell decided to form their new band, they thought of Connor. The 'Lloyd Alexander Real Estate' issued one 45rpm single on President PT157 in 1967 \\"Gonna Live Again\\"/\\"Watcha' Gonna Do (When Your Baby Leaves You)\\", a Mod R&B; record. Within weeks of starting rehearsals, Audience had acquired management, a publishing contract, a residency at Ronnie Scott's Jazz Club, and a recording contract with Polydor, with whom they recorded their first album Audience, an acoustic guitar-driven album featuring Gemmell's saxophone often electrically altered to resemble an electric lead guitar and with string and horn arrangements by Andrew Pryce Jackman. But the band was dissatisfied with the record company's promotional approach (a single, \\"Too Late I'm Gone\\" from the album had been planned and was canceled), and temporarily moved to Switzerland to avoid involvement in proposed publicity stunts. By the end of the year, the band was drawing public and journalistic acclaim for their songs, arrangements, and stage act. They had also been commissioned to write the score for Bronco Bullfrog, an East End skinhead film directed by Barney Platts-Mills, which established a genre subsequently taken up by Mike Leigh. Recordings After the debut album issued on Polydor, Tony Stratton-Smith, Director of Charisma Records, spotted the band supporting Led Zeppelin and signed them up to his label immediately. Audience recorded three albums with Charisma. The first, Friend's Friend's Friend, was produced and designed by the band. Their subsequent releases House on the Hill and Lunch were produced by Gus Dudgeon, with arrangements by Robert Kirby and cover art by record sleeve designers Hipgnosis. Their first two albums were not issued in the U.S. Elektra signed them (around the time Elektra signed Lindisfarne, another Charisma group), and their final two albums were issued in the U.S. Dudgeon's first 45 rpm production for the band, \\"Indian Summer\\", took the band into the lower reaches of the U.S. charts, but by this time they were exhausted and fractious, having worked virtually non-stop for three years. A U.S. tour with Rod Stewart and The Faces and Cactus, although successful, brought things to a head, resulting in Gemmell leaving the band in January 1972. The unfinished Lunch album was completed with the help of The Rolling Stones and Mad Dogs and Englishmen brass section, Jim Price and Bobby Keys, following which they went straight back on the road with new members Nick Judd on keyboards and Pat Charles Neuberg on alto and soprano saxophone. Break-up The band never recovered from Gemmell's departure; and Williams, the band's main lyricist, resigned eight months later. When Judd received an offer to join Juicy Lucy shortly thereafter, the band folded. Judd later went on to join Alan Bown, The Andy Fraser Band, Brian Eno, Frankie Miller and Sharks, most recently emerging in a Madness spin-off band. By this time, Keith Gemmell had joined Stackridge, later to join Sammy, whose sole album was produced by Ian Gillan of Deep Purple, then on to The Roy Young Band. During this time he was also doing session work and arranging, often together with film soundtrack writer John Altman, before joining the Pasadena Roof Orchestra for fourteen years. Howard Werth was working on his first solo album at this time, still with Charisma and produced by Dudgeon. Called King Brilliant, his band, containing members of Hookfoot and with Mike Moran on keyboards, was dubbed Howard Werth and The Moonbeams, and came close to having a chart hit with Lucinda. However, it wasn't to be, and when he was headhunted by The Doors (Audience stable-mates on the U.S. Elektra record label) to replace Jim Morrison, Werth left for the USA. The Doors did not reform, and Werth found himself engaged in various short term projects with Doors' keyboard man Ray Manzarek and musicians from Captain Beefheart and The Magic Band before returning to the UK in the early 1980s. Although appearing live only occasionally, Werth later recorded two more solo albums, 6 of 1 and Half a Dozen of the Other on Demon Records and The Evolution Myth Explodes for his own Luminous Music label. Trevor Williams joined 1960s hitmakers The Nashville Teens, a version driven by Len Tuckey, who left shortly after to help his girlfriend Suzi Quatro launch a career with Mickie Most. Williams moved on to Jonathan Kelly's Outside, recording one single, Outside, and an album Waiting On You with a band fronted by the twin guitars of Snowy White and Chaz Jankel plus ex-Graham Bond drummer Dave Sheen and percussionist Jeff Whittaker, formerly with Peter Green and Crosby, Stills and Nash. After this, he drifted back to The Nashville Teens, this time with friend Rob Hendry - ex-Renaissance guitarist, and later with The Motors and Alan Price - in a misconceived project to revitalise the band's image and fortunes. When this foundered, Williams left the business entirely. Tony Connor also ended up with Most. After a stint with Jackson Heights, a spin-off from The Nice, he joined one of Most's stable, Hot Chocolate, with whom he has remained. Reunions Despite a few minor projects together, the original Audience band members were not to re-emerge as a working entity until 32 years after their dissolution. In 2004, Howard Werth, Keith Gemmell and Trevor Williams performed in Germany, Italy, Canada and the UK, replacing Tony Connor (who remained committed to Hot Chocolate) with drummer/vocalist John Fisher (born 8 December 1960, Buxton, Derbyshire - died 27 September 2008) and recording a live album alive&kickin;'&screamin;'&shoutin;' for Eclectic Records. During this period, Gemmell released two solo albums, The Windhover, inspired by a poem by Gerard Manley Hopkins, and Unsafe Sax, a tribute to his early '60s soul roots. Following the death of John Fisher from pancreatic cancer on 27 September 2008, Audience recruited drummer Simon Jeffrey, who also worked with Bernie Torme, Led Zeppelin tribute band Letz Zep and Blue Pulse, which Trevor Williams joined in 2009. Audience played its final gig at London's 100 Club in 2013 shortly after which Keith Gemmell, already fighting cancer, became too unwell to play. Williams subsequently announced he did not wish to continue without Gemmell but continues to work with Blue Pulse, with whom he released an album entitled Trams in 2012, with Howard Werth also performing on several tracks. Keith Gemmell died from tongue cancer on 24 July 2016.

He was born in Posen, Prussia (German Empire), now Pozna≈Ñ, Poland, as a son of Polish parents, and emigrated to the United States at the age of two. From 1925 to 1926 he studied at the School of the Art Institute of Chicago, In 1930 he won the Logan Medal of the Arts, then moved to New York City to take classes at the National Academy of Design with George Luks and at Columbia University, where he studied logic and philosophy.

American abstract artists who put name to an open letter to the president of The Metropolitan Museum of Art were rejecting the museum's exhibition American Painting Today - 1950 and boycotting the competition. Roszak established a studio in New York City in 1932 and worked as an artist for the Works Progress Administration during the depression before going back to Chicago to teach at the Art Institute. He taught at Sarah Lawrence College throughout the 1940s and 1950s and at Columbia University from 1970 to 1973.

She was ordained in 1985 by the Jewish Theological Seminary of America, one of the academic centers and spiritual centers of Conservative Judaism. Youth and early life Eilberg was born October 12, 1954, in Philadelphia, USA. Her father, Joshua Eilberg, represented Pennsylvania in the U.S. House of Representatives, and her mother, Gladys, was a social worker. Her parents were proud but not observant Jews, but when Eilberg was fourteen, her newfound commitment to traditional Jewish observance led her mother to make their home kitchen conform to the Jewish dietary laws kashrut. In high school, she was involved in the United Synagogue Youth and she later worked at Camp Ramah in the Poconos, in New England, and in Wisconsin. Eilberg attended Brandeis University from 1972 to 1976, continuing to develop her deep interest in Judaism. She majored in Near Eastern and Judaic Studies, and also became an active member of Hillel International on campus. While at Brandeis she learned how to read the Torah and began to pray with tallit and tephillin. In 1976 she graduated from Brandeis and enrolled in Jewish Theological Seminary (JTS) to do graduate work in Talmud. After receiving her master's degree, she taught at Midreshet Yerushalayim, an intensive egalitarian yeshiva program run by the JTS in Israel. When she found out that JTS had tabled the question of women's ordination in 1979, she was disappointed but she began to pursue doctoral studies in Talmud, first at Neve Schechter, the JTS branch in Jerusalem, and then at JTS in New York City. She later enrolled in the Smith College School for Social Work and in 1984 received her masters of social work. Rabbinical school Eilberg was among the first group of women who immediately signed up for classes in the rabbinical school in the fall of 1984. Since the early 1970s, leaders of the Jewish Theological Seminary (JTS) had engaged in serious discussions and debates about women's ordination in Conservative Judaism. Hastened by the Reform movement's decision to ordain Sally Priesand in 1972 and the Reconstructionist movement to ordain Sandy Eisenberg Sasso in 1974, members of the Rabbinical Assembly, the central organization of Conservative rabbis, initiated exploratory studies about Jewish legal attitudes toward women's ordination.Gerson Cohen, chancellor of JTS from 1972 to 1986, became an active proponent of the admission of women into rabbinical programs after reviewing the conclusions of a national study conducted in the late 1970s. In October 1983, shortly after the death of Rabbi Saul Lieberman, who had been a powerful force against women's ordination, the faculty of JTS voted to allow women to enter their rabbinical school. (See Nadell, Pamela S., \\"Women Who Would Be Rabbis: A History of Women's Ordination, 1889‚Äì1985\\" in Jewish Women's Life.) As of 2014, the seminaries of the Conservative Movement have ordained approximately 300 women rabbis. Rabbinic life On May 12, 1985, at the age of thirty, Eilberg became the first woman ordained in Conservative Judaism. In 1986 she became the first woman appointed to serve on the Rabbinical Assembly's Committee on Jewish Law and Standards. She started her career as a chaplain at Methodist Hospital in Indianapolis. She served for one year as the assistant rabbi at Har Zion Temple near Philadelphia. In 1989, she stepped down from that position at this synagogue, explaining in her resignation letter that her desire to spend more time with her young daughter was one of the primary motivations for her decision. She also realized that her true passion was for caring for the ill. She served as hospice chaplain for the Jewish Hospice Program in Philadelphia, then she helped found the Bay Area Jewish Healing Center in San Francisco where she directed the program's Jewish Hospice Care Program. At the height of the AIDS crisis, the Jewish Healing Center offered spiritual care to Jews people living with illness, death, and loss. Eilberg appeared in a 2005 documentary, titled And the Gates Opened: Women in the Rabbinate, which features stories of and interviews with her, rabbi Sally Priesand, and rabbi Sandy Eisenberg Sasso. On Dec. 6th, 2010, at Temple Reyim in Newton, MA, Amy Eilberg met for the first time with Sally Priesand, the first Reform female rabbi, Sandy Eisenberg Sasso, the first Reconstructionist female rabbi, and Sara Hurwitz, considered by some to be the first Orthodox female rabbi. They and approximately 30 other women rabbis lit Chanukah candles and then spoke about their experiences in an open forum. On June 3, 2012, Priesand, Sasso, Eilberg, and Hurwitz met again, this time at Monmouth Reform Temple at a celebration honoring the four first women rabbis to be ordained in their respective denominations, and the 40th anniversary of Priesand's ordination. Personal life Eilberg has been married twice, first to Howard Eilberg-Schwartz, and then, in 1996, to Louis E. Newman, a professor of Judaic Studies at Carleton College. She has one daughter, Penina, from her first marriage, and two stepsons, Etan and Jonah, from her second. She lived in Mendota Heights, Minnesota, and was a regular member of Beth Jacob Congregation in Mendota Heights. She currently lives in San Francisco.

The Eastern Orthodox and Roman Catholic traditions offer varying accounts of the later events of his life. In the context of the seven signs in the Gospel of John, the raising of Lazarus at Bethany ‚Äì today the Israeli town of Al- Eizariya, which translates to \\"the place of Lazarus\\" ‚Äì is the climactic narrative: exemplifying the power of Jesus \\"over the last and most irresistible enemy of humanity: death. For this reason it is given a prominent place in the gospel.\\" A figure named Lazarus (Latinised from the Aramaic: ◊ê◊ú◊¢◊ñ◊®, El øƒÅzƒÅr, cf. Heb. Eleazar‚Äî\\"God helped\\" is also mentioned in the Gospel of Luke. The two Biblical characters named \\"Lazarus\\" have sometimes been conflated historically, but are generally understood to be two separate people. The name Lazarus is frequently used in science and popular culture in reference to apparent restoration to life; for example, the scientific term Lazarus taxon denotes organisms that reappear in the fossil record after a period of apparent extinction. There are also numerous literary uses of the term. Raising of Lazarus=Narrative Raising Lazarus, Oil on Copper Plate, 1875, Carl Heinrich Bloch (Hope Gallery, Salt Lake City) The biblical narrative of the raising of Lazarus is found in chapter 11 of the Gospel of John. A certain Eleazer (whence Lazarus) is introduced as a follower of Jesus who lives in the town of Bethany near Jerusalem. He is identified as the brother of the sisters Mary and Martha. The sisters send word to Jesus that Lazarus, \\"he whom thou lovest,\\" is ill. Instead of immediately traveling to Bethany, according to the narrator, Jesus intentionally remains where he is for two more days before beginning the journey. When Jesus arrives in Bethany, he finds that Lazarus is dead and has already been in his tomb for four days. He meets first with Martha and Mary in turn. Martha laments that Jesus did not arrive soon enough to heal her brother and Jesus replies with the well-known statement, \\"I am the resurrection, and the life: he that believeth in me, though he were dead, yet shall he live: And whosoever liveth and believeth in me shall never die\\".John 11:25, KJV Later the narrator here gives the famous simple phrase, \\"Jesus wept\\".John 11:35, KJV In the presence of a crowd of Jewish mourners, Jesus comes to the tomb. Over the objections of Martha, Jesus has them roll the stone away from the entrance to the tomb and says a prayer. He then calls Lazarus to come out (\\"Come forth\\") and Lazarus does so, still wrapped in his grave-cloths. Jesus then calls for someone to remove the grave- cloths, and let him go. The narrative ends with the statement that many of the witnesses to this event \\"believed in him.\\" Others are said to report the events to the religious authorities in Jerusalem. The Gospel of John mentions Lazarus again in chapter 12. Six days before the Passover on which Jesus is crucified, Jesus returns to Bethany and Lazarus attends a supper that Martha, his sister, serves. Jesus and Lazarus together attract the attention of many Jews and the narrator states that the chief priests consider having Lazarus put to death because so many people are believing in Jesus on account of this miracle. The miracle of the raising of Lazarus, the longest coherent narrative in John aside from the Passion, is the culmination of John's \\"signs\\". It explains the crowds seeking Jesus on Palm Sunday, and leads directly to the decision of Caiaphas and the Sanhedrin to kill Jesus. It is notable that at John 11:11, after being told by his disciples to fear those who would kill him, and after the parable about living in darkness, Jesus references his own parable and states that Lazarus sleeps, and that He will go \\"wake him up\\". The disciples thought Jesus meant Lazarus was actually sleeping in verse 12. Then, in verse 14, Jesus speaks plainly and tells them that \\"Lazarus has died\\". This is to be clear that Lazarus has died in the flesh, and is not sleeping or unconscious. A resurrection story that is very similar is also found in the controversial Secret Gospel of Mark, although the young man is not named there specifically. Some scholars believe that the Secret Mark version represents an earlier form of the canonical story found in John.\\"Secret Mark's story is certainly much older in its form than John's account of the raising of Lazarus.\\" Tomb of Lazarus Reputed tomb of Lazarus in al-Eizariya The reputed first tomb of Lazarus is in the Leitrim (generally believed to be the biblical Bethany) and continues to be a place of pilgrimage to this day. Several Christian churches have existed at the site over the centuries. Since the 16th century, the site of the tomb has been occupied by the al-Uzair Mosque. The adjacent Roman Catholic Church of Saint Lazarus, designed by Antonio Barluzzi and built between 1952 and 1955 under the auspices of the Franciscan Order, stands upon the site of several much older ones. In 1965, a Greek Orthodox church was built just west of the tomb. The entrance to the tomb today is via a flight of uneven rock-cut steps from the street. As it was described in 1896, there were twenty-four steps from the then-modern street level, leading to a square chamber serving as a place of prayer, from which more steps led to a lower chamber believed to be the tomb of Lazarus.In The Biblical World 8.5 (November 1896:40). The same description applies today.Modern Bethany , by Albert Storme, Franciscan Cyberspot.\\"Sacred Destinations\\" The first mention of a church at Bethany is in the late 4th century, but both the historian Eusebius of CaesareaThe Onomastikon of Eusebius and the Madaba Map , By Leah Di Segni. First published in: The Madaba Map Centenary, Jerusalem, 1999, pp. 115‚Äì20. (c. 330) and the Bordeaux pilgrim do mention the tomb of Lazarus. In 390 Jerome mentions a church dedicated to Saint Lazarus, called the Lazarium. This is confirmed by the pilgrim Egeria in about the year 410. Therefore, the church is thought to have been built between 333 and 390.Bethany in Byzantine Times I and Bethany in Byzantine Times II, by Albert Storme, Franciscan Cyberspot. The present-day gardens contain the remnants of a mosaic floor from the 4th-century church. The Lazarium was destroyed by an earthquake in the 6th century, and was replaced by a larger church. This church survived intact until the Crusader era. In 1143 the existing structure and lands were purchased by King Fulk and Queen Melisende of Jerusalem and a large Benedictine convent dedicated to Mary and Martha was built near the tomb of Lazarus. After the fall of Jerusalem in 1187, the convent was deserted and fell into ruin with only the tomb and barrel vaulting surviving. By 1384, a simple mosque had been built on the site. In the 16th century, the Ottomans built the larger al-Uzair Mosque to serve the town's (now Muslim) inhabitants and named it in honor of the town's patron saint, Lazarus of Bethany. Lazarus' tomb, Bethany According to the Catholic Encyclopedia of 1913, there were scholars who questioned the reputed site of the ancient village (though this was discounted by the Encyclopedia's author): > Some believe that the present village of Bethany does not occupy the site of > the ancient village; but that it grew up around the traditional cave which > they suppose to have been at some distance from the house of Martha and Mary > in the village; Zanecchia (La Palestine d'aujourd'hui, 1899, I, 445ff.) > places the site of the ancient village of Bethany higher up on the > southeastern slope of the Mount of Olives, not far from the accepted site of > Bethphage, and near that of the Ascension. It is quite certain that the > present village formed about the traditional tomb of Lazarus, which is in a > cave in the village. The identification of this cave as the tomb of Lazarus > is merely possible; it has no strong intrinsic or extrinsic authority. The > site of the ancient village may not precisely coincide with the present one, > but there is every reason to believe that it was in this general location.\\"  Other traditions  While there is no further mention of Lazarus in the Bible, the Eastern Orthodox and Roman Catholic traditions offer varying accounts of the later events of his life. He is most commonly associated with Cyprus, where he is said to have become the first bishop of Kition (Larnaka), and Provence, where he is said to have been the first bishop of Marseille. Bishop of Kition Church of Saint Lazarus, Larnaca According to Eastern Orthodox Church tradition, sometime after the Resurrection of Christ, Lazarus was forced to flee Judea because of rumoured plots on his life and came to Cyprus. There he was appointed by Barnabas and Paul the Apostle as the first bishop of Kition (present-day Larnaka). He lived there for thirty more years,Chev. C. Savona-Ventura (KLJ, CMLJ, BCrLJ).

Reprinted by Fr. Demetrios Serfes at St. Lazarus The Friend Of Christ And First Bishop Of Kition, Cyprus Further establishing the apostolic nature of Lazarus' appointment was the story that the bishop's omophorion was presented to Lazarus by the Virgin Mary, who had woven it herself. Such apostolic connections were central to the claims to autocephaly made by the bishops of Kition--subject to the patriarch of Jerusalem--during the period 325‚Äì431. The church of Kition was declared self-governing in 431 AD at the Third Ecumenical Council.Roberson, Fr. Ronald G., (C.S.P.). The Orthodox Church of Cyprus . CNEWA United States. 26 June 2007. According to tradition, Lazarus never smiled during the thirty years after his resurrection, worried by the sight of unredeemed souls he had seen during his four-day stay in Hell. The only exception was, when he saw someone stealing a pot, he smilingly said: \\"the clay steals the clay.\\" In 890, a tomb was found in Larnaca bearing the inscription \\"Lazarus the friend of Christ\\". Emperor Leo VI of Byzantium had Lazarus' remains transferred to Constantinople in 898. The transfer was apostrophized by Arethas, bishop of Caesarea, and is commemorated by the Eastern Orthodox Church each year on October 17. In recompense to Larnaca, Emperor Leo had the Church of St. Lazarus, which still exists today, erected over Lazarus' tomb. The marble sarcophagus can be seen inside the church under the Holy of Holies. After the sacking of Constantinople by the Franks during the Fourth Crusade in 1204, the Crusaders carried the saint's relics to Marseilles, France as part of the booty of war. From there, \\"later on, they disappeared and up to the present day they have not been traced.\\" In the 16th century, a Russian monk from the Monastery of Pskov visited St. Lazarus's tomb in Larnaca and took with him a small piece of the relics. Perhaps that piece led to the erection of the St. Lazarus chapel at the Pskov Monastery (Spaso-Eleazar Monastery, Pskov), where it is kept today.St. Lazarus Church & Ecclesiastical Museum, Larnaca.

In June 2012 the Church of Cyprus gave a part of the holy relics of St. Lazarus to a delegation of the Russian Orthodox Church, led by Patriarch Kirill of Moscow and All Russia, after a four-day visit to Cyprus.

Bishop of Marseille Autun Cathedral (Cath√©drale Saint-Lazare d'Autun), Autun, France, also said to be built over the tomb of Lazarus In the West, according to an alternative medieval tradition (centered in Provence), Lazarus, Mary, and Martha were \\"put out to sea by the Jews hostile to Christianity in a vessel without sails, oars, or helm, and after a miraculous voyage landed in Provence at a place called today the Saintes-Maries.\\" The family is then said to separate and go in different parts of southeastern Gaul to preach; Lazarus goes to Marseilles. Converting many people to Christianity there, he becomes the first Bishop of Marseille. During the persecution of Domitian, he is imprisoned and beheaded in a cave beneath the prison Saint-Lazare. His body is later translated to Autun, where he is buried in the Autun Cathedral, dedicated to Lazarus as Saint Lazare. However, the inhabitants of Marseilles claim to be in possession of his head which they still venerate. Pilgrims also visit another purported tomb of Lazarus at the V√©zelay Abbey in Burgundy. In the Abbey of the Trinity at Vend√¥me, a phylactery was said to contain a tear shed by Jesus at the tomb of Lazarus. The Golden Legend, compiled in the 13th century, records the Proven√ßal tradition. It also records a grand lifestyle imagined for Lazarus and his sisters (note that therein Lazarus' sister Mary is conflated with Mary Magdalene): > Mary Magdalene had her surname of Magdalo, a castle, and was born of right > noble lineage and parents, which were descended of the lineage of kings. And > her father was named Cyrus, and her mother Eucharis. She with her brother > Lazarus, and her sister Martha, possessed the castle of Magdalo, which is > two miles from Nazareth, and Bethany, the castle which is nigh to Jerusalem, > and also a great part of Jerusalem, which, all these things they departed > among them. In such wise that Mary had the castle Magdalo, whereof she had > her name Magdalene. And Lazarus had the part of the city of Jerusalem, and > Martha had to her part Bethany. And when Mary gave herself to all delights > of the body, and Lazarus entended all to knighthood, Martha, which was wise, > governed nobly her brother's part and also her sister's, and also her own, > and administered to knights, and her servants, and to poor men, such > necessities as they needed. Nevertheless, after the ascension of our Lord, > they sold all these things.\\"Of Mary Magdalene\\", Legenda Aurea, Book IV. The 15th-century poet Georges Chastellain draws on the tradition of the unsmiling Lazarus:Huizinga, The Waning of the Middle Ages p. 147 \\"He whom God raised, doing him such grace, the thief, Mary's brother, thereafter had naught but misery and painful thoughts, fearing what he should have to pass\\". (Le pas de la mort, VI). Liturgical commemorations Revival of Lazarus by Christ. Made by Johannes Wierix. Lazarus is honored as a saint by those Christian churches which keep the commemoration of saints, although on different days, according to local traditions. In Christian funerals the idea of the deceased being raised by the Lord as Lazarus was raised is often expressed in prayer. Eastern Orthodoxy The Eastern Orthodox Church and Byzantine Catholic Church commemorate Lazarus on Lazarus Saturday, the day before Palm Sunday, which is a moveable feast day. This day, together with Palm Sunday, hold a unique position in the church year, as days of joy and triumph between the penitence of Great Lent and the mourning of Holy Week.Archimandrite Kallistos Ware and Mother Mary, Tr., The Lenten Triodion (St. Tikhon's Seminary Press, South Canaan, Pennsylvania, 2002, ), p. 57. During the preceding week, the hymns in the Lenten Triodion track the sickness and then the death of Lazarus, and Christ's journey from beyond Jordan to Bethany. The scripture readings and hymns for Lazarus Saturday focus on the resurrection of Lazarus as a foreshadowing of the Resurrection of Christ, and a promise of the General Resurrection. The Gospel narrative is interpreted in the hymns as illustrating the two natures of Christ: his humanity in asking, \\"Where have ye laid him?\\",() and his divinity by commanding Lazarus to come forth from the dead.() Many of the Resurrectional hymns of the normal Sunday service, which are omitted on Palm Sunday, are chanted on Lazarus Saturday. During the Divine Liturgy, the Baptismal Hymn, \\"As many as have been baptized into Christ have put on Christ\\",() is sung in place of the Trisagion. Although the forty days of Great Lent end on the day before Lazarus Saturday, the day is still observed as a fast; however, it is somewhat mitigated. In Russia, it is traditional to eat caviar on Lazarus Saturday. Lazarus is also commemorated on the liturgical calendar of the Eastern Orthodox Church on the fixed feast day of March 17, while the translation of his relics from Cyprus to Constantinople in the year 898 ADTranslation of the relics of St Lazarus \\"of the Four Days in the Tomb\\" the Bishop of Kiteia on Cyprus.

Conflation with the beggar Lazarus The name \\"Lazarus\\" also appears in the Gospel of Luke in the parable of Lazarus and Dives, which is attributed to Jesus. Also called \\"Dives and Lazarus\\", or \\"The Rich Man and the Beggar Lazarus\\", the narrative tells of the relationship (in life and in death) between an unnamed rich man and a poor beggar named Lazarus. Historically within Christianity, the begging Lazarus of the parable (feast day June 21) and Lazarus of Bethany (feast day December 17) have often been conflated, with some churches celebrating a blessing of dogs, associated with the beggar, on December 17, the date associated with Lazarus of Bethany.Money talks: folklore in the public sphere December 2005, Folklore magazine. Allusions to Lazarus as a poor beggar taken to the \\"Bosom of Abraham\\" should be understood as referring to the Lazarus mentioned in Luke, rather than the Lazarus who rose from the dead in John. This conflation can be found in Romanesque iconography carved on portals in Burgundy and Provence. For example, at the west portal of the Church of St. Trophime at Arles, the beggar Lazarus is enthroned as St. Lazarus. Similar examples are found at the church at Avallon, the central portal at V√©zelay, and the portals of the cathedral of Autun.Richard Hamann, \\"Lazarus in Heaven\\" The Burlington Magazine for Connoisseurs 63 No. 364 (July 1933), pp. 3‚Äì5, 8‚Äì11 Order of Saint Lazarus The Military and Hospitaller Order of St. Lazarus of Jerusalem (OSLJ) is a religious/military order of chivalry which originated in a leper hospital founded by Knights Hospitaller in the twelfth century by Crusaders of the Latin Kingdom of Jerusalem.

Although the Quran mentions no figure named Lazarus, among the miracles with which it credits Jesus includes the raising of people from the dead (III, 43/49). Muslim lore frequently detailed these miraculous narratives of Jesus, but mentioned Lazarus only occasionally.

Cultural references Resurrection of Lazarus by Mauricio Garc√≠a Vega. Well known in Western culture from their respective biblical tales, both figures named Lazarus (Lazarus of Bethany and the Beggar Lazarus of \\"Lazarus and Dives\\"), have appeared many times in music, writing and art. The majority of the references are to Lazarus of Bethany. In literature Many works of literature from the 20th century allude to Lazarus, including Truman Capote's short story \\"A Tree of Night\\" in A Tree of Night and Other Stories (1945) and John Knowles's novel A Separate Peace (1959). Allusions in 20th-century poetry occur in works such as Leonid Andreyev's book-length poem Lazarus (1906), T.S. Eliot's poem \\"The Love Song of J. Alfred Prufrock\\" (1915), Edwin Arlington Robinson's poem \\"Lazarus\\" (1920), and Sylvia Plath's poem \\"Lady Lazarus\\" published in her posthumous anthology Ariel (1965). An allusion to Lazarus also appears in the memoir Witness (1952) by Whittaker Chambers (who acknowledged the influence of Dostoevsky's works), which opens its first chapter, \\"In 1937, I began, like Lazarus, the impossible return.\\" Science fiction allusions to Lazarus occur in Robert A. Heinlein's Lazarus Long novels (1941‚Äì1987), Walter M. Miller, Jr.'s A Canticle for Leibowitz (1960), and Frank Herbert's The Lazarus Effect (1983). Lazarus Is Dead (2011) by Richard Beard is an innovative novel that was described by the Sunday Business Post as \\"no ordinary novel: it is a brilliant, genre-bending retelling and subversion of one of the oldest, most sensational stories in the western canon.\\" John Derhak's The Bones of Lazarus (2012), is a darkly funny, fast-paced, supernatural thriller that traces intersecting lives on a war-torn, resource rich, Caribbean island. The plot revolves around the premise that Lazarus of Bethany, upon his resurrection by Christ, becomes an immortal creature of Judgment, seeking the hearts and souls of the wicked throughout time. Richard Zimler's bestselling novel 'The Gospel According to Lazarus (2019 in English) is written from the perspective of Lazarus himself. The book presents Yeshua ben Yosef (Jesus' Hebrew name) as an early Jewish mystic and explores the deep friendship between Lazarus and Yeshua, who - within the fictional setting - have been best friends since childhood.The themes of the book include how we cope with a loss of faith, the terrible sacrifices we make for those we love, the transcendent meaning of Yeshua's mission, and how we go on after suffering a shattering trauma. The Observer review summarized the novel as \\"A very human tale of rivalry, betrayal, power-grabbing and sacrifice.... Perhaps the most remarkable aspect of this brave and engaging novel...is that Zimler manages to make the best-known narrative in western culture a page-turner.\\" In music In music, a popular retelling of the biblical Lazarus story from the point of view of Lazarus in heaven is the 1984 gospel story-song \\"Lazarus Come Forth\\" by Contemporary Christian Music artist Carman.Carman Bio, MPCA promotional material.Comin' On Strong discography.

Also in the video game Diablo (1996) by Blizzard North the Archbishop Lazarus is a character in the game Mythology who for unknown reasons destroys the Soulstone and resurrects the demon lord Diablo.https://diablo.gamepedia.com/Lore_Summary In 2K's video game BioShock, the 'Lazarus Vector' is a genetic vector used to bring a forest back to life after it is poisoned by the game's antagonist. The first episode of the fourth season of Supernatural is titled Lazarus Rising in reference to Lazarus due to Dean being brought back to life by the angel Castiel. In (Zone 2)(#HitSquad) PS's Voice of The Streets Freestyle, PS says \\"Anyting B get ahh, ahh, anyting B I'm-, he came back and I call him Lazarus\\" referring to Tizzy T (a member of rival group Moscow 17) who was stabbed and revived.

(2006) Caribbean Popular Music: an Encyclopedia of Reggae, Mento, Ska, Rocksteady, and Dancehall, Greenwood Press, , p. 317-8 was a Jamaican Rastafari drummer and band leader. Biography In the early 1950s, he set up a Rasta community in Rockfort near Wareika Hill on the east side of Kingston, where many of Kingston's musicians learned about the Rastafari movement. In the late 1950s, he (with other percussionists) formed the Count Ossie Group. According to reggae historian Bruno Blum, the Rasta \\"nyabinghi\\" style of hand drumming, which derives from Jamaican Kumina traditions, has its roots in Bantu traditions from Eastern Congo. According to the book The First Rasta by H√©l√®ne Lee, because of their Rastafarian beliefs Count Ossie and his team were violently rejected from the then anti-Rasta music establishment and outlawed, as most Rastafarians were. It was not until around 1959, when successful dancer Marguerita Mahfood, a Jamaican rumba dancer of Honduran descent who enjoyed their new style and liked to dance to it, demanded that Count Ossie and his group be part of her major Ward Theater show. Vere John Jr. also resisted at first but at Mahfood's insistence had no other choice but to have them on his Opportunity Hour show at the Carib theater. Both shows were successful and opened new doors to Count Ossie and the Wareikas right away. Their first sound recordings were made after meeting Prince Buster, who produced a Wareikas-backed song by the Folkes Brothers, \\"Oh Carolina\\", done at the Jamaican Broadcasting Corporation (JBC) Studios in 1959. The B-side was \\"I Met a Man\\"). Although both songs were recorded in the then-current style of rhythm and blues widely recorded in the US as well as Jamaica, it does include some early Rasta hand drumming not found on any previous R&B; records and is regarded by some music historians as one of the first-ever ska record. During this period Count Ossie also recorded for producers Harry Mudie and Coxsone Dodd. Several singles as Count Ossie and the Wareikas, including \\"African Shuffle\\" as well as \\"Chubby\\" and \\"Rock a Man Soul\\" with vocal group The Mellow Cats, were produced by Harry Mudie circa 1961 featuring saxophonist Wilton Gaynair and trombonist Rico Rodriguez, and were released on the Jamaican label Moodies at the time (some were licensed to Emil Shalit's UK label Blue Beat and released in England in the early 1960s). Count Ossie later formed a group called The Mystic Revelation of Rastafari and recorded a few singles, including a cover of Miriam Makeba's \\"Pata Pata\\" in 1967. Several Jamaican artists also used Ossie's group as percussionists for their own ska and reggae recordings, such as a couple of King Stitt singles, including \\"Be a Man\\" (Studio One) circa 1969. Count Ossie issued two outstanding albums at the end of his lifetime and inspired several later Rastafarian drumming groups, including Ras Michael and the Sons of Negus, who recorded with Bob Marley. Count Ossie's masterpiece is the Grounation three-LP set (1973), which includes songs such as \\"So Long\\", and \\"Grounation\\" (the latter title with over 30 minutes running time) and an updated version of \\"Oh Carolina\\". Two years later Tales Of Mozambique (Dynamic 1975) was issued, continuing the legacy of the first album. Count Ossie died in a road accident on 18 October 1976, aged 50. His group, The Mystic Revelation of Rastafari, lived on, toured and recorded a few albums into the 1990s.

Pore water pressures below the phreatic level of the groundwater are measured with piezometers. The vertical pore water pressure distribution in aquifers can generally be assumed to be close to hydrostatic. In the unsaturated (\\"vadose\\") zone, the pore pressure is determined by capillarity and is also referred to as tension, suction, or matric pressure. Pore water pressures under unsaturated conditions are measured with tensiometers, which operate by allowing the pore water to come into equilibrium with a reference pressure indicator through a permeable ceramic cup placed in contact with the soil. Pore water pressure is vital in calculating the stress state in the ground soil mechanics, from Terzaghi's expression for the effective stress of a soil. General principles Pressure develops due to: *Water elevation difference: water flowing from higher elevation to lower elevation and causing a velocity head, or with water flow, as exemplified in Bernoulli's energy equations. *Hydrostatic water pressure: resulting from the weight of material above the point measured. *Osmotic pressure: inhomogeneous aggregation of ion concentrations, which causes a force in water particles as they attract by the molecular laws of attraction. *Absorption pressure: attraction of surrounding soil particles to one another by adsorbed water films. *Matric suction: the defining trait of unsaturated soil, this term corresponds to the pressure dry soil exerts on the surrounding material to equalise the moisture content in the overall block of soil and is defined as the difference between pore air pressure,(u_a), and pore water pressure, (u_w). Below the water table A vibrating wire piezometer. The vibrating wire converts the fluid pressures into equivalent frequency signals that are then recorded. The buoyancy effects of water have a large impact on certain soil properties, such as the effective stress present at any point in a soil medium. Consider an arbitrary point five meters below the ground surface. In dry soil, particles at this point experience a total overhead stress equal to the depth underground (5 meters), multiplied by the specific weight of the soil. However, when the local water table height is within said five meters, the total stress felt five meters below surface is decreased by the product of the height of the water table in to the five meter area, and the specific weight of water, 9.81 kN/m^3. This parameter is called the effective stress of the soil, basically equal to the difference in a soil's total stress and pore water pressure. The pore water pressure is essential in differentiating a soil's total stress from its effective stress. A correct representation of stress in soil is necessary for accurate field calculations in a variety of engineering trades. Equation for calculation When there is no flow, the pore pressure at depth, hw, below the water surface is: :p_s=g_w h_w , where: * ps is the saturated pore water pressure (kPa), * gw is the unit weight of water (kN/m3), ::g_w=9.81 kN/m^3 (English Units 62.43 lb/ft^3) National Council of Examiners for Engineering and Surveying (2005). Fundamentals of Engineering Supplied- Reference Handbook (7th ed.). Clemson: National Council of Examiners for Engineering and Surveying. * hw is the depth below the water table (m), Measurement methods and standards The standard method for measuring pore water pressure below the water table employs a piezometer, which measures the height to which a column of the liquid rises against gravity; i.e., the static pressure (or piezometric head) of groundwater at a specific depth. Piezometers often employ electronic pressure transducers to provide data. The United States Bureau of Reclamation has a standard for monitoring water pressure in a rock mass with piezometers. It sites ASTM D4750, \\"Standard Test Method for Determining Subsurface Liquid Levels in a Borehole or Monitoring Well (Observation Well)\\". Above the water table Electronic tensiometer probe: (1) porous cup; (2) water-filled tube; (3) sensor-head; (4) pressure sensor At any point above the water table, in the vadose zone, the effective stress is approximately equal to the total stress, as proven by Terzaghi's principle. Realistically, the effective stress is greater than the total stress, as the pore water pressure in these partially saturated soils is actually negative. This is primarily due to the surface tension of pore water in voids throughout the vadose zone causing a suction effect on surrounding particles, i.e. matric suction. This capillary action is the \\"upward movement of water through the vadose zone\\" (Coduto, 266). Increased water infiltration, such as that caused by heavy rainfall, brings about a reduction in matric suction, following the relationship described by the soil water characteristic curve (SWCC), resulting in a reduction of the soil's shear strength, and reduced slope stability. Capillary effects in soil are more complex than in free water due to the randomly connected void space and particle interference through which to flow; regardless, the height of this zone of capillary rise, where negative pore water pressure is generally peaks, can be closely approximated by a simple equation. The height of capillary rise is inversely proportional to the diameter of void space in contact with water. Therefore, the smaller the void space, the higher water will rise due to tension forces. Sandy soils consist of more coarse material with more room for voids, and therefore tends to have a much shallower capillary zone than do more cohesive soils, such as clays and silts. Equation for calculation If the water table is at depth dw in fine-grained soils, then the pore pressure at the ground surface is: :p_g=-g_w d_w , where: * pg is the unsaturated pore water pressure (Pa) at ground level, * gw is the unit weight of water (kN/m3), ::g_w=9.81 kN/m^3 * dw is the depth of the water table (m), and the pore pressure at depth, z, below the surface is: :p_u=g_w (z-d_w) , where: * pu is the unsaturated pore water pressure (Pa) at point, z, below ground level, * zu is depth below ground level. Measurement methods and standards A tensiometer is an instrument used to determine the matric water potential (\\\\Psi_m) (soil moisture tension) in the vadose zone.Rawls, W.J., Ahuja, L.R., Brakensiek, D.L., and Shirmohammadi, A. 1993.

These can include taking care of the home owner's pets, performing general maintenance (including pools, lawns, air-conditioning systems, etc.), keeping trespassers off the property, readdressing the mail, and in general, making sure that everything runs smoothly, just as if the owner was at home. It is reasonably assumed that pet care is typically a paid service, although some \\"house sitters\\" may choose to include this as part of their agreement at no cost, or a nominal fee. Benefits for the home/pet owner Pets are the reason for 80 percent of house-sitting arrangements, and for many people the cost of pet care during holidays is more than the cost of the vacation itself. Many pet owners prefer to leave their pets at home in familiar surroundings, cared for by other pet lovers. A secondary benefit to the home owner is that the property is maintained for the entire period they are away. It also is generally implied that crime is deterred by the presence of a house sitter. This is supported by the fact that insurance companies in some countries provide reduced rates for householders who use the services of house sitters. In the UK, most insurance companies will reject claims if the house is left vacant for more than 30 days without prior arrangement, and require that an empty property be checked at least every seven days. House sitting is therefore considered a practical solution to managing properties which would otherwise stand vacant for long periods of time. In Canada, some insurance claims will not be paid out if they occur in a home left empty for more than four days. Therefore, it is important for home owners to have someone enter their home at least once every four days they are absent. Hiring a house sitter can provide the support and documentation needed in the event that a claim must be made with an insurance company. Benefits for the house sitter Saving money on accommodation, while traveling on vacation, or when living nomadically, is usually considered to be the main benefit for the sitter. House sitters can experience living like locals in different countries and cultures around the world, for anything from a few days to several months, or sometimes even longer. The growth of house sitting House sitting has evolved from its original purpose of local sitters helping regional pet owners, to a much wider network of international house sitters who travel the world looking after other people's home and pets. This is a year-round option for people who prefer to take vacations where they can live locally with the company of pets, or who want to live a full-time alternative lifestyle. There are an increasing number of full-time house sitters who have sold their properties and choose to live life as location-independent travelers. The industry is supported by a number of professional international and regional house-sitting websites that match house sitters with homeowners around the world following the principles of the sharing economy, whereby pet- and home- care services are provided in exchange for free accommodation. Popular countries supporting the growth of this travel niche include the UK, US, Canada, Australia, and New Zealand, but can include any smaller destination where expats and retirees have created new communities. Often through word-of- mouth recommendation, there a booming number of world travelers, retirees, and nomad workers all looking for alternative accommodation options, all of whom are contributing to the growth of the house-sitting industry. House sitting in Europe has become an especially popular job, and it serves as a win‚Äîwin scenario for both house sitter and homeowner. Many areas of Europe have now become major destinations for long-term house sitters. Practicalities‚Äîhow house sitting works Members of house sitting websites often pay an annual subscription fee to be part of a network, where they can advertise house sits, or apply for house sitting assignments. Members can use the service as many times as they like for the duration of their membership. Competition can be steep, as more people are learning about the money-saving benefits of house sitting. Having an understanding of how house-sitting platforms work and what home owners expect from a house sitter (such as background checks, written agreements, and references) enables sitters, especially new house sitters, to secure house sits in the locations they desire. Alternative forms of house and pet sitting House sitters regularly assume the role of pet care and are therefore often referred to as pet sitters. However, pet sitting can also refer to the practice of running a pet care business, which may involve home visits, dog walking, grooming, and other pet care duties. A newly developed version of house sitting which has gained widespread acceptance is the contracting of house sitters who do not live on premises. This house-sitting arrangement requires the house sitter to provide regular visits to the home owner's house. The frequency of visits is determined in advance and is not less than the minimum requirements as stipulated by the home owner's insurance policy. This type of service can perform similar functions as mentioned above. It is becoming more popular as some home owners do not wish to have someone living in their house while they are away.

Usually this applies to sand, soil, or gravel.  History  Karl von Terzaghi first proposed the relationship for effective stress in 1925. For him, the term \\"effective\\" meant the calculated stress that was effective in moving soil, or causing displacements. It represents the average stress carried by the soil skeleton. Description Effective stress (œÉ') acting on a soil is calculated from two parameters, total stress (œÉ) and pore water pressure (u) according to: : \\\\sigma' = \\\\sigma - u\\\\, Typically, for simple examples :\\\\begin{align} \\\\sigma & = H_{\\\\mathrm{soil}}\\\\,\\\\gamma_{\\\\mathrm{soil}}\\\\ u & = H_{\\\\mathrm{w}}\\\\,\\\\gamma_{\\\\mathrm{w}} \\\\end{align} Much like the concept of stress itself, the formula is a construct, for the easier visualization of forces acting on a soil mass, especially simple analysis models for slope stability, involving a slip plane. With these models, it is important to know the total weight of the soil above (including water), and the pore water pressure within the slip plane, assuming it is acting as a confined layer. However, the formula becomes confusing when considering the true behaviour of the soil particles under different measurable conditions, since none of the parameters are actually independent actors on the particles. Arrangement of Spheres showing contacts Consider a grouping of round quartz sand grains, piled loosely, in a classic \\"cannonball\\" arrangement. As can be seen, there is a contact stress where the spheres actually touch. Pile on more spheres and the contact stresses increase, to the point of causing frictional instability (dynamic friction), and perhaps failure. The independent parameter affecting the contacts (both normal and shear) is the force of the spheres above. This can be calculated by using the overall average density of the spheres and the height of spheres above. Spheres immersed in water, reducing effective stress If we then have these spheres in a beaker and add some water, they will begin to float a little depending on their density (buoyancy). With natural soil materials, the effect can be significant, as anyone who has lifted a large rock out of a lake can attest. The contact stress on the spheres decreases as the beaker is filled to the top of the spheres, but then nothing changes if more water is added. Although the water pressure between the spheres (pore water pressure) is increasing, the effective stress remains the same, because the concept of \\"total stress\\" includes the weight of all the water above. This is where the equation can become confusing, and the effective stress can be calculated using the buoyant density of the spheres (soil), and the height of the soil above. Spheres being injected with water, reducing effective stress The concept of effective stress truly becomes interesting when dealing with non-hydrostatic pore water pressure. Under the conditions of a pore pressure gradient, the ground water flows, according to the permeability equation (Darcy's law). Using our spheres as a model, this is the same as injecting (or withdrawing) water between the spheres. If water is being injected, the seepage force acts to separate the spheres and reduces the effective stress. Thus, the soil mass becomes weaker. If water is being withdrawn, the spheres are forced together and the effective stress increases. Two extremes of this effect are quicksand, where the groundwater gradient and seepage force act against gravity; and the \\"sandcastle effect\\", where the water drainage and capillary action act to strengthen the sand. As well, effective stress plays an important role in slope stability, and other geotechnical engineering and engineering geology problems, such as groundwater-related subsidence.

With it the typical range of the axial resolution of 500‚Äì700 nm can be improved to 100‚Äì150 nm, which corresponds to an almost spherical focal spot with 5‚Äì7 times less volume than that of standard confocal microscopy. Working principle The improvement in resolution is achieved by using two opposing objective lenses, which both are focused to the same geometrical location. Also the difference in optical path length through each of the two objective lenses is carefully aligned to be minimal. By this method, molecules residing in the common focal area of both objectives can be illuminated coherently from both sides and the reflected or emitted light can also be collected coherently, i.e. coherent superposition of emitted light on the detector is possible. The solid angle \\\\Omega that is used for illumination and detection is increased and approaches its maximum. In this case the sample is illuminated and detected from all sides simultaneously. Optical Scheme of 4Pi Microscope The operation mode of a 4Pi microscope is shown in the figure. The laser light is divided by a beam splitter and directed by mirrors towards the two opposing objective lenses. At the common focal point superposition of both focused light beams occurs. Excited molecules at this position emit fluorescence light, which is collected by both objective lenses, combined by the same beam splitter and deflected by a dichroic mirror onto a detector. There superposition of both emitted light pathways can take place again. In the ideal case each objective lens can collect light from a solid angle of \\\\Omega=2\\\\pi. With two objective lenses one can collect from every direction (solid angle \\\\Omega=4\\\\pi). The name of this type of microscopy is derived from the maximal possible solid angle for excitation and detection. Practically, one can achieve only aperture angles of about 140¬∞ for an objective lens, which corresponds to \\\\Omega \\\\approx 1.3\\\\pi. The microscope can be operated in three different ways: In a 4Pi microscope of type A, the coherent superposition of excitation light is used to generate the increased resolution. The emission light is either detected from one side only or in an incoherent superposition from both sides. In a 4Pi microscope of type B, only the emission light is interfering. When operated in the type C mode, both excitation and emission light are allowed to interfere, leading to the highest possible resolution increase (~7-fold along the optical axis as compared to confocal microscopy). In a real 4Pi microscope light cannot be applied or collected from all directions equally, leading to so-called side lobes in the point spread function. Typically (but not always) two-photon excitation microscopy is used in a 4Pi microscope in combination with an emission pinhole to lower these side lobes to a tolerable level. History In 1971, Christoph Cremer and Thomas Cremer proposed the creation of a perfect hologram, i.e. one that carries the whole field information of the emission of a point source in all directions, a so-called 4\\\\pi hologram.Cremer C., Cremer T.

The first description of a practicable system of 4Pi microscopy, i.e. the setup with two opposing, interfering lenses, was invented by Stefan Hell in 1991.European patent EP 0491289. He demonstrated it experimentally in 1994. In the following years, the number of applications for this microscope has grown. For example, parallel excitation and detection with 64 spots in the sample simultaneously combined with the improved spatial resolution resulted in the successful recording of the dynamics of mitochondria in yeast cells with a 4Pi microscope in 2002. A commercial version was launched by microscope manufacturer Leica Microsystems in 2004Review article 4Pi microscopy. and later discontinued. Up to now, the best quality in a 4Pi microscope was reached in conjunction with super-resolution techniques like the stimulated emission depletion (STED) principle. Using a 4Pi microscope with appropriate excitation and de-excitation beams, it was possible to create a uniformly 50 nm sized spot, which corresponds to a decreased focal volume compared to confocal microscopy by a factor of 150‚Äì200 in fixed cells. With the combination of 4Pi microscopy and RESOLFT microscopy with switchable proteins, it is now possible to take images of living cells at low light levels with isotropic resolutions below 40 nm.

Proposed solutions had ranged from moderate renovation to the construction of a completely new facility on the current site of some of the athletic fields. The decision was made in 2010 to begin the construction of a new facility, and the completion of this facility took place in the summer of 2012. The new facility has a completely different floor plan, and the prior failing physical plants are now functioning and accessible. Notable alumni * Janice E.

A melodic punk rock band with vocals shared by Phil Douglas and Mattie Jo Canino, their songs often contain political and/or socially conscious lyrics. The band is considered highly influential in the Melodic Punk genre with their album _No Matter Where We Go..._ being considered a staple of the genre. Phil Douglas and Mattie Jo Canino respectively would go on to form the equally acclaimed Iron Chic and RVIVR. Canino, Douglas and Schramm would go on to form Tender Defender in 2015, considered by many to be an extension of Latterman. Background The band was formed in 1999 by Matt Canino, Phil Douglas, Dan Sposato and Pat Schramm following the dissolution of Canino's, Douglas' and Sposato's previous band, Five Days Late. In 1999 the band issued their first demo and self released their debut _None Of These Songs Are About Girls_ in 2000. After Sposato's exit and a few replacements, the band finally found a steady guitarist in Mike \\"MR\\" Campbell and released their cult classic _Turn Up The Punk, We'll Be Singing_ on Traffic Violation Records. In 2005 the band struck a deal with Deep Elm Records and released the landmark and highly influential _No Matter Where We Go..._ as well as a re-release of the out-of-print _Turn Up The Punk, We'll Be Singing_. Following the release of _No Matter Where We Go..._ Campbell exit the band and was replaced by Brian Crozier. This lineup of the band released their 4th and final album, 2006's _We Are Still Alive_. On October 18, 2007, music website Punknews.org reported that the band has officially broken up. Canino issued a statement via Punknews where she stated that \\"I Felt like a broken record going on tour and talking about sexism in punk rock every night and then some fucking bro-dudes coming up to me and saying some fucked up shit. I even got to a point where I stopped calling them out on it, and that just felt wrong. I was tired. Basically, it just stopped making sense for everyone in the band to keep on doing the band.\\"Latterman (2000-2007). Punknews.org. October 18, 2007. Members have since gone on to play in bands including Iron Chic, Bridge and Tunnel, RVIVR, Laura Stevenson and The Cans, Daytrader, Pox, Shorebirds, Mutoid Men (not to be confused with Mutoid Man) and The Brass. In December of 2011, the band reunited for four shows with the _No Matter Where We Go..._ lineup. To coincide with the reunion shows, the band released \\"Our Better Halves\\", an unreleased song that was the last thing they ever recorded. Since 2011, the band has played live sporadically since their break up with having performed a small handful of shows in 2011, 2012, 2016 and 2018. 2016 saw the release of the self-titled debut from Tender Defender, a band formed by 3/4ths of the band (Canino, Douglas and Schramm).

It is influenced by two primary cultural strands: * Cookery practised by indigenous people of Namibia such as the Himba, Herero and San groups * Settler cookery introduced during the colonial period by people of German, Afrikaner and British descent.  Indigenous cookery  Lamb chops on a Braai In the precolonial period indigenous cuisine was characterised by the use of a very wide range of fruits, nuts, bulbs, leaves and other products gathered from wild plants and by the hunting of wild game. The domestication of cattle in the region about two thousand years ago by Khoisan groups enabled the use of milk products and the availability of meat. However, during the colonial period the seizure of communal land in Namibia helped to discourage traditional agriculture and reduced the extent of land available to indigenous people. * Vetkoek * Oshikundu  Colonial cookery  Namibia was settled by German colonists during the nineteenth century, and German influence on white Namibian cookery remains very strong. One example of German settler cuisine is Wiener schnitzel.  Brewing  Beer was brewed by many indigenous tribes in the territory that is now Namibia. The recipes depended on locally available ingredients and were brewed to make for instance sugar beer and honey beer. The German brewing tradition continued in colonial German South-West Africa. After it quickly proved unpractical and expensive to import it from Germany, breweries were established all over the colony. However, when after World War I many Germans were deported and an economic depression set in, most breweries went out of business. German lager beers including Tafel and Windhoek lagers are still brewed in the country for domestic consumption and export.

It is bordered by the territories of Settimo Torinese, Castiglione Torinese, Turin, and Baldissero Torinese. History The first written record of Pulchra Rada (the ancient name for San Mauro, which in Latin means \\"beautiful beach and/or port\\" - on the Po river) dates from 4 May 991. On that day Anselmo (at the time the ruler of Montferrat) gave the order to rebuild a Benedictine monastery, erected originally above a pre-existing ancient Roman settlement, that had been destroyed by a Saracen invasion. The abbey became especially prosperous in the 12th century, after which it started to decline due to the continuous strife between the bordering Marquisate of Montferrat and Duchy of Savoy. In 1474 it was therefore suppressed and turned into in commendam. The way was owned by the Benedictinese until 1603, when it was transferred to secular clergy. The convent was suppressed again by Pope Pius VI in 1803. Bridge Victor Emmanuel III, connecting San Mauro to Bertolla, locally known as ponte vecchio (old bridge), was inaugurated on 8 September 1912.

Ben Hope () is a mountain in northern Scotland. It is the most northerly Munro, standing alone in the Flow Country (a region of bumpy, peat-covered moorland) south-east of Loch Hope in Sutherland. The mountain is a roughly triangular wedge, with a great crag on the west, with two lower shoulders to the south and northeast. Alpine flowers are abundant in season, although the ground is very rocky. Ascent The principal route to the summit starts in Strathmore, to the west of the mountain, where there is parking off a small road. The route lies along the Allt-na-caillich burn which flows down through a gap in the west-facing crags. The route is steep, but well marked with occasional cairns and not exposed. There is little available scrambling. Approach from the east is rare, as there is a wide expanse of heather-covered moorland with no roads in that direction. Approach from the north is not possible for walkers, as there is no path between the crags. The view from the summit includes the Pentland Firth, Loch Eriboll and the nearby mountains of Arkle and Foinaven. The Orkney Islands are visible on a clear day.

Security updates are determined by the current version of MBSA using the Windows Update Agent present on Windows computers since Windows 2000 Service Pack 3. The less-secure settings, often called Vulnerability Assessment (VA) checks, are assessed based on a hard-coded set of registry and file checks. An example of a VA might be that permissions for one of the directories in the /www/root folder of IIS could be set at too low a level, allowing unwanted modification of files from outsiders. Version history Versions 1.2.1 and below run on NT4, Windows 2000, Windows XP, and Windows Server 2003, provide support for IIS versions 5 through 6, SQL Server 7 and 2000, Internet Explorer 5.01 and 6.0 only, and Microsoft Office 2000 through 2003. Security update assessment is provided by an integrated version of Shavlik's HFNetChk 3.8 scan tool. MBSA 1.2.1 was localized into English, German, French and Japanese versions and supported security assessment for any locale. Version 2.0 retained the hard-coded VA checks, but replaced the Shavlik security assessment engine with Microsoft Update technologies which adds dynamic support for all Microsoft products supported by Microsoft Update. MBSA 2.0.1 was released to support the revised Windows Update (WU) offline scan file (WSUSSCN2.CAB). MBSA 2.1 added Vista and Windows Server 2008 support, a new Vista-styled GUI interface, support for the latest Windows Update Agent (3.0), a new Remote Directory (/rd) feature and extended the VA checks to x64 platforms. In the August 2012 Security Bulletin Webcast Q&A; on Technet it was announced that \\"The current version of MBSA (2.2) will not support Windows 8 and Microsoft currently has no plans to release an updated version of the tool.\\" In November 2013 MBSA 2.3 was released.

Tube flaring is considered to be a type of forging operation,Manufacturing and Engineering Technology: Serope Kalpakjin and is usually a cold working procedure. During assembly, a flare nut is used to secure the flared tubing's tapered end to the also tapered fitting, producing a pressure-resistant, leak-tight seal. Flared connections offer a high degree of long-term reliability and for this reason are often used in mission- critical and inaccessible locations. The tool used to flare tubing consists of a die that grips the tube and either a mandrel or rolling cone is forced into the end of the tube to form the flare by cold working. The most common flare fitting standards in use today are the 45¬∞ SAE flare, the 37¬∞ JIC flare, and the 37¬∞ AN flare. SAE 45¬∞ flare connections are commonly used in automotive applications as well as for refrigeration and air conditioning. SAE fittings are typically made from brass. SAE and AN/JIC connections are incompatible due to the different flare angle. JIC 37¬∞ flare connections are used in higher pressure hydraulic applications. JIC fittings are typically steel or stainless steel. JIC fittings are not permissible where AN connections are specified, due to differing quality standards. AN 37¬∞ flare connections are typically specified for military and aerospace applications. Fittings can be made from a large variety of materials. The ‚ÄúAN‚Äù standard (for Air Force / Navy) has been replaced by other military and aerospace standards, though in practice these fittings are still referred to as AN. Flared fittings are an alternative to solder-type joints that is mechanically separable and doesn‚Äôt require an open flame.

He was the sixth of eight princes commonly associated with the War of the Eight Princes. His title was the Prince of Chengdu (ÊàêÈÉΩÁéã), but he did not receive any posthumous names. Early career Sima Ying was Emperor Wu of Jin's 16th son, by his concubine Consort Cheng. In 289, Emperor Wu created him the Prince of Chengdu. After Emperor Wu died in 290 and Emperor Hui succeeded to the throne, Sima Ying remained in the capital Luoyang. However, after he once rebuked Jia Mi (), the nephew of Emperor Hui's powerful wife Empress Jia Nanfeng, for disrespecting Emperor Hui's son Sima Yu the crown prince, Empress Jia sent Sima Ying away from the capital to take up the defense post for the important city of Yecheng (ÈÑ¥Âüé, in modern Handan, Hebei). Sima Ying was handsome but not much more intelligent than his developmentally disabled brother Emperor Hui, but he developed a good reputation among officials and the people by being lenient, filial to his mother Princess Dowager Cheng, and listening to the advice of his capable advisor Lu Zhi (). After Empress Jia falsely accused Crown Prince Yu of crimes and deposed in 299 and then further murdered him in 300, she was overthrown by Emperor Hui's granduncle Sima Lun the Prince of Zhao.

As Sima Jiong and Sima Ying's forces approached Luoyang. Sima Lun was captured by officials in Luoyang who declared for the rebellion as well, and forced to issue an edict returning the throne to Emperor Hui. He was then forced to commit suicide. The associates of Sima Lun were executed. After overthrowing Sima Lun Map showing the Wars of the Eight Princes Some thought that a power balance that Emperor Wu had hoped for at his death might be restored, as Princes Jiong and Ying were each given regent titles (and awarded the nine bestowments, in one rare case where the nine bestowments were not signs of an impending usurpation, although Prince Ying declined the bestowments), and many talented officials were promoted into important positions. However, the Princes Jiong and Ying were actually apprehensive of each other's power, and Prince Ying decided to yield the central government regency to Prince Jiong at the time and return to his defense post at Yecheng. When he bid farewell to Sima Jiong, he did not talk about politics at all but only about his mother's illness, and this brought further praise on his character, as did his subsequent acts to collect the bodies of soldiers who had died in the war against Sima Lun to give them proper burials. In the capital, Sima Jiong became arrogant based on his accomplishments. He had his sons created princes, and ran the matters of the central government from his mansion, rarely visiting the emperor or attending the imperial meetings. He enlarged his mansion to be as large as the palace, and he entrusted matters to people who were close to him, and would not change his ways even when some of his more honest associates tried to change his behavior. When Emperor Hui's grandsons Sima Zang and Sima Shang (), successive crown princes, died in childhood, leaving Emperor Hui without male descendants by 302, Sima Ying was considered the appropriate successor, but Sima Jiong chose to bypass him by recommending the seven-year-old Sima Qin () the Prince of Qinghe (Emperor Hui's nephew and the son of his brother Sima Xia ()) as the crown prince, with intent to easily control the young Crown Prince Qin. Sima Jiong became suspicious of Sima Yong the Prince of Hejian‚Äîbecause Sima Yong had initially wanted to support Sima Lun, until he saw that Sima Lun's cause was hopeless. Sima Yong knew of Sima Jiong's suspicion, and started a conspiracy; he invited Sima Ai the Prince of Changsha to overthrow Sima Jiong, believing that Sima Ai would fail; his plan was then to start a war against Sima Jiong in conjunction with Sima Ying. Once they were victorious, he would depose Emperor Hui and make Sima Ying the emperor, and then serve as Sima Ying's prime minister. In winter 302, Sima Yong declared his rebellion, and Sima Ying soon joined, despite opposition from his strategist Lu Zhi (). Hearing that Sima Ai was part of the conspiracy as well, Sima Jiong made a preemptive strike against Sima Ai, but Sima Ai was prepared and entered the palace to control Emperor Hui. After a street battle, Sima Jiong's forces collapsed, and he was executed. Sima Ai became the effective regent, but in order to reduce opposition, he submitted all important matters to Sima Ying, still stationed at Yecheng. After Sima Jiong's death, Sima Ying became extremely arrogant as well, and trusted inappropriate persons, chief among whom was his servant Meng Jiu (). Even though Sima Ai submitted all important matters to him, he still considered Sima Ai an interference to his control of government and wanted to eliminate him. At the same time, Sima Yong, who had hoped that if Sima Ying became emperor he could then be prime minister, persuaded Sima Ying to again join him against Sima Ai. They started military action against Sima Ai in fall of 303, and while they had overwhelming force, their forces could not score a conclusive victory against Sima Ai. Sima Yong's forces were about to withdraw in spring 304 when Sima Yue the Prince of Donghai, the grandson of a great-granduncle of Emperor Hui, believing that Sima Ai could not win this war, arrested him and delivered him to Sima Yong's general Zhang Fang (), who executed Sima Ai cruelly by burning him to death. Sima Ying became in effective control of the government, but continued to control it remotely from Yecheng. As regent and crown prince Sima Ying soon ordered Emperor Hui's second wife, Yang Xianrong, and his crown prince Sima Qin, deposed. Then, at Sima Yong's pre-arranged petition, Sima Ying was created the crown prince. He put people he trusted in charge of the defenses of Luoyang, while remotely controlling the government from Yecheng. Eventually, the officials in Luoyang tired of the situation, and they rose under Sima Yue's command in summer 304. Sima Yue, with Emperor Hui accompanying him, then attacked Yecheng. Sima Ying, after some initial hesitation, battled Sima Yue's troops and defeated him, forcing him to flee and capturing Emperor Hui. He did not return Emperor Hui to Luoyang, but kept him at Yecheng. This gave Wang Jun (), the commander of the forces in You Province (ÂπΩÂ∑û, modern Beijing, Tianjin, and northern Hebei), with whom Sima Ying had prior disputes, an excuse to attack Sima Ying, and he did so, claiming that Sima Ying was improperly detaining Emperor Hui. Wang's forces were reinforced with ferocious Xianbei and Wuhuan soldiers, and Sima Ying's forces, in fear of their fighting abilities, collapsed, before they could be reinforced with Xiongnu forces under the command of Sima Ying's associate Liu Yuan. Sima Ying was forced to flee to Luoyang with Emperor Hui, now without troops to support him. (Upon hearing Sima Ying's collapse, Liu Yuan, instead of coming to Sima Ying's aid, declared independence from Jin and styled himself the Prince of Han, claiming descent (through a princess) from Han Dynasty, thus creating Han Zhao.) Once Sima Ying arrived in Luoyang, he found the troops of his ally Sima Yong there, commanded by Zhang Fang. Instead of continuing to support Sima Ying, however, Sima Yong turned his back on Sima Ying and had him removed from his crown prince position, instead creating another brother of Emperor Hui, Sima Chi the Prince of Yuzhang, crown prince. Sima Ying was demoted back to being the Prince of Chengdu. Soon, Zhang forced Emperor Hui, Crown Prince Chi, and Sima Ying to move from Luoyang to Chang'an, safely under Sima Yong's control. After removal as crown prince After Sima Ying was removed as crown prince, the people of Yecheng nevertheless missed the days when he was considered a capable governor, under Lu's guidance. In 305, his former subordinates, the generals Gongshi Fan () and Ji Sang () therefore declared a rebellion, seeking to restore him. Sima Yong sent Sima Ying to try to pacify or suppress the rebellion, but while he was on the way to Yecheng, Sima Yue declared a rebellion with the ostensible goal of returning Emperor Hui to Luoyang, and Sima Ying was unable to progress to Yecheng; he instead returned to Chang'an. After Sima Yue defeated Sima Yong in 306 and welcomed Emperor Hui back to Luoyang, he put out an order for Sima Ying's arrest, and Sima Ying fled with his sons Sima Pu () the Prince of Lujiang and Sima Kuo () the Prince of Zhongdu, attempting to flee to Gongshi, when he was intercepted by Feng Song () the governor of Dunqiu Commandery (È†ì‰∏ò, roughly modern Puyang, Henan) and taken to Yecheng. The defender of that city, Sima Xiao () the Prince of Fanyang, imprisoned Sima Ying but did not wish to kill him. However, when Sima Xiao died later that year, his secretary Liu Yu (), worried that there were still many of Sima Ying's supporters in the city, forged an edict ordering Sima Ying to commit suicide. His two sons were also killed with him. After Ji captured Yecheng in 307, he placed Sima Ying's casket on a wagon in his command train, and he would report all important decisions to Sima Ying's casket. After Ji was defeated in 308, Sima Ying's casket was thrown in a well, and his formal associates took it out of the well and buried it. References * Fang, Xuanling. Book of Jin (Jin Shu).

An expense ratio of 1% per annum means that each year 1% of the fund's total assets will be used to cover expenses. The expense ratio does not include sales loads or brokerage commissions. Expense ratios are important to consider when choosing a fund, as they can significantly affect returns. Factors influencing the expense ratio include the size of the fund (small funds often have higher ratios as they spread expenses among a smaller number of investors), sales charges, and the management style of the fund. A typical annual expense ratio for a U.S. domestic stock fund is about 1%, although some passively managed funds (such as index funds) have significantly lower ratios. One notable component of the expense ratio of U.S. funds is the \\"12b-1 fee\\", which represents expenses used for advertising and promotion of the fund. 12b-1 fees are generally limited to a maximum of 1.00% per year (.75% distribution and .25% shareholder servicing) under Financial Industry Regulatory Authority Rules. The term \\"expense ratio\\" is also a key measure of performance for a nonprofit organization. The term is sometimes used in other contexts as well. Waivers, reimbursements & recoupments Some funds will execute \\"waiver or reimbursement agreements\\" with the fund's adviser or other service providers, especially when a fund is new and expenses tend to be higher (due to a small asset base). These agreements generally reduce expenses to some pre-determined level or by some pre-determined amount. Sometimes, these waiver/reimbursement amounts must be repaid by the fund during a period that generally cannot exceed 3 years from the year in which the original expense was incurred. If a recoupment plan is in effect, the effect may be to require future shareholders to absorb expenses of the fund incurred during prior years. It is calculated by operating expenses. Changes in expense ratio (fixed & variable expenses) Generally, unlike future performance, expenses are predictable. Funds with high expenses ratios tend to continue to have high expenses ratios. An investor can examine a fund's \\"Financial Highlights\\" which is contained in both the periodic financial reports and the fund's prospectus, and determine a fund's expense ratio over the last five years (if the fund has five years of history). It is very hard for a fund to significantly lower its expense ratio once it has had a few years of operational history. This is because funds have both fixed and variable expenses, but most expenses are variable. Variable costs are fixed on a percentage basis. For example, assuming there are no breakpoints, a .75% management fee will always consume .75% of fund assets, regardless of any increase in assets under management. The total management fee will vary based on the assets under management, but it will always be .75% of assets. Fixed costs (such as rent or an audit fee) vary on a percentage basis because the lump sum rent/audit amount as a percentage will vary depending on the amount of assets a fund has acquired. Thus, most of a fund's expenses behave as a variable expense and thus, are a constant fixed percentage of fund assets. It is, therefore, very hard for a fund to significantly reduce its expense ratio after it has some history. Thus, if an investor buys a fund with a high expense ratio that has some history, he/she should not expect any significant reduction. Expenses matter relative to investment type There are 3 broad investment categories for mutual funds (equity, bond, and money market ‚Äì in declining order of historical returns). This is an over-simplification, but is adequate to explain the effect of expenses. In an equity fund where the historical gross return might be 9%, a 1% expense ratio will consume approximately 11% of the investor's return (1 divided by 9 is about 0.11 or 11%). In a bond fund where the historical gross return might be 8%, a 1% expense ratio will consume approximately 12.5% of the investor's return. In a money market fund where the historical gross return might be 5%, a 1% expense ratio will consume approximately 20% of the investor's historical total return. Thus, an investor must consider a fund's expense ratio as it relates to the type of investments a fund will hold. Nonprofit organizations In nonprofit organizations, the term \\"program expense ratio\\" refers to program expenses divided by total expenses.Zack, Gerard. Financial Statement Fraud: Strategies for Detection and Investigation, p. 224 (Wiley and Sons, 2012). This is one of the primary financial indicators of concern to charities and their donors. The sum of the program expense ratio and the \\"support service expense ratio\\" is by definition 100% for a non-profit organization.Zietlow, John et al. Financial Management for Nonprofit Organizations, p. 336 (Wiley and Sons, 2012). Charities having a higher program expense ratio (and thus a lower support service expense ratio) are often considered to be more efficient. The support service expense ratio is also commonly called the \\"overhead\\".Berger, Ken et al. \\"The Overhead Myth\\", Nonprofit Quarterly (June 17, 2013). Leading sources of information about charities, including GuideStar, Charity Navigator and the Wise Giving Alliance, say that the support service expense ratio (i.e. \\"overhead\\") can be an important indicator, especially if it is at one extreme or another, but generally speaking it is just as important to look at other factors including transparency, governance, leadership, and results. According to Charity Navigator (as of 2009), the national median for the support service expense ratio was 10 percent, and that expense ratio was less than 30 percent for more than three-fourths of the charities ranked on its website.Stonesifer, Sandy. \\"The 50-Cent Rule: If a charity spends less than half its funds on its programs, does that mean it's ineffective?\\", Slate (September 9, 2009).

In this context, the expense ratio shows the percentage of an operation's gross revenues that is being allocated to the expenses related to running the operation. Business managers who use profit and loss statements (i.e. income statements) to draft business plans find expense ratios to be very useful indices in producing forecasts, and determining where cost cutting and revenue maximization opportunities exist.Rushinek, A. and Rushinek, S.

His main professional activities are as organizer and guide in mountaineering expeditions. On May 18, 1999, he became the first Portuguese man to reach the summit of Mount Everest, without the use of supplementary oxygen. Three years later, in 2002, he published a book, \\"A mais alta solid√£o\\" (The highest loneliness), in which he describes his experiences in mountain climbing, namely his 1999 expedition to Everest, where he endured bitter adversities. Nevertheless, Jo√£o Garcia continued to climb and on the 17th April 2010, he summited Annapurna without the aid of supplemental oxygen, becoming the 10th man of all time to climb all 14 eight- thousanders without bottled oxygen or Sherpas.  Biography  Born in the Portuguese capital Lisbon, Jo√£o Garcia started practicing mountaineering in 1982 (15 years old), when he travelled to Serra da Estrela by bicycle to practice rock climbing with ‚ÄúClube de Montanhismo da Guarda‚Äù (CMG) (Guarda mountaineering club). In the following year (1983) he started ice climbing. In 1984 he went on an expedition to the Alps with CMG, having ascended to Mont Blanc for the first time. The following years he climbed several other summits in the Alps. In the meantime he practised triathlon which helped him acquire the necessary physical strength to succeed in mountain climbing. In 1993 he started his activities in the Himalayas, as part of an international Polish expedition (led by Krzysztof Wielicki) to Cho Oyu, in Tibet. The ascent was performed by a new route and without the aid of supplementary oxygen. Since then he ascended several Himalayan mountains including all the fourteen eight- thousanders. On May 18, 1999, he became the first Portuguese person to climb Mount Everest (8848m) by its north face route, again without using supplementary oxygen. During the descent his partner Pascal Debrouwer from Belgium, fell to his death. Due to the harsh weather, Jo√£o Garcia suffered from severe frostbite in his fingers and face, leading him to spend some time in a hospital in Zaragoza, Spain, where he had a part of his fingers amputated. In June/July 2000 he visited Peru with a party from CAB (Club Alpin Belge), climbing Urus, Ishinca, Tocllaraju, ad Chopicalqui. During his 2005 Lhotse ascent, his partner H√©lder Santos was forced to abandon the summit attempt due to food poisoning. Still, he climbed in great style, having reached the summit alone. In 2006 he started the project \\"√Ä conquista dos Picos do Mundo\\" (Conquering the world's peaks), where he aspires to climb (without supplementary oxygen and between 2006 and 2010), eight of the fourteen eight-thousanders, hoping to finish the fourteen summits by 2010. His first quest was Kanchenjunga, which he summitted on May 22, 2006, along with Ivan Vallejo from Ecuador. Still in 2006, Jo√£o led a Portuguese expedition to Shishapangma (8027m), which included the mountaineers Bruno Carvalho, H√©lder Santos, Rui Rosado and Ana Santos. The journalist Aur√©lio Faria has followed part of the expedition. Jo√£o, Bruno and Rui reached the summit on October 31. Tragically, Bruno fell to his death during the descent. On July 20, 2007, Jo√£o reached the summit of K2, the second highest mountain in the world, making his ninth successful ascent of 8000+ mountains. It was a memorable, tough climb, with several expeditions getting together for the summit push. As always, Jo√£o was one of the very few that did not use supplemental oxygen during the climb. On May 20, 2008, Jo√£o reached the summit of Makalu (8,462 m), his 10th eight- thousander. After considerable logistic complications in the Everest region due to the mayhem caused by the Olympic flame trip to the roof of the world, Jo√£o reached base camp late in the season and ended up summiting alone, under strong wind. On July 18, 2008, Jo√£o summitted Broad Peak (8,051 m), his 11th eight-thousander.. The common perception that this is an easy summit proved to be wrong as the last pitches are technically demanding Vis√£o - √öltimas Not√≠cias On April 28, 2009, he reached the summit of Manaslu (8,163 m) after yet another difficult climb. He was joined by four members of a Korean expedition while most climbers involved in the summit push were forced to go back due to exhaustion and unfavorable climbing conditions. On July 10, 2009, Jo√£o summitted Nanga Parbat (8,126 m), his 13th eight- thousander. He summited Annapurna (8,091 m) on April 17, 2010. With this accomplishment he has reached the summit of all the 14 eight-thousanders and become one of the few mountaineers to achieve this without the use of supplementary oxygen. Jo√£o Garcia has also already climbed the Seven Summits (the highest mountains of each of the seven continents): Mount Everest (Asia), Aconcagua (South America), Mount McKinley (North America), Elbrus (Europe), Vinson Massif (Antarctica), Kilimanjaro (Africa) and Mount Kosciuszko (Australia).

Mercury was an online rotor machine descended from Typex, but modified to achieve a longer cycle length using a so-called double- drum basket system.  History  Mercury was designed by Wing Commander E. W. Smith and F. Rudd, who were awarded ¬£2,250 and ¬£750 respectively in 1960 for their work in the design of the machine. E. W. Smith, one of the developers of TypeX, had designed the double-drum basket system in 1943, on his own initiative, to fulfil the need for an on-line system. Mercury prototypes were operational by 1948, and the machine was in use by 1950. Over 200 Mercury machines had been made by 1959 with over ¬£250,000 spent on its production. Mercury links were installed between the UK and various Overseas stations, including in Canada, Australia, Singapore, Cyprus, Germany, France, Middle East, Washington, Nairobi and Colombo. The machine was used for UK diplomatic messaging for more or less a decade, but saw almost no military use. In 1960, it was anticipated that the machine would remain in use until 1963, when it would be made obsolete by the arrival of BID 610 (Alvis) equipment. A miniaturised version of Mercury was designed, named Ariel, but this machine appears not to have been adopted for operational use.  Design  In the Mercury system, two series of rotors were used. The first series, dubbed the control maze, had four rotors, and stepped cyclometrically as in Typex. Five outputs from the control maze were used to determine the stepping of five rotors in the second series of rotors, the message maze, the latter used to encrypt and decrypt the plaintext and ciphertext. A sixth rotor in the message maze was controlled independently and stepped in the opposite direction to the others. All ten rotors were interchangeable in any part of either maze. Using rotors to control the stepping of other rotors was a feature of an earlier cipher machine, the US ECM Mark II. Mercury also used double-wired rotors, consisting of \\"Inside and Outside Scrambled Wheels\\", the Outer wheels being settable in a number of positions with respect to the Inner wheels.  Security  It had been mathematically determined that Typex had a sufficiently large cycle to permit only 750 characters to be sent using a single arrangement of its rotors without fear of compromising security. A counter recorded the number of keystrokes and when these reached 750 a predetermined rotor was manually advanced one step, thus permitting TypeX to safely encrypt messages with more than 750 key strokes. Mercury, with its longer cycle length, was judged to be safe even after 56700 characters had passed on one setting of the rotors. This cycle length was sufficient for the machine to be used as an on-line cipher machine with traffic flow security -- the machine would transmit continuously, even if not sending a message.

He also appeared in musical films and later in life, in comedic roles. A tap dancer, he was frequently dubbed as the \\"Fred Astaire of the Philippines\\". Early years Casimiro was born in Laguna. His parents were stage comedians, and at the age of 7, he would appear on stage, often dressed as a clown. By 1936, he would join a performing troupe in Hawaii headlined by Atang de la Rama. Bodabil star By the late 1930s, Casimiro began headlining major bodabil productions in Manila. He made a name for himself as a tap dancer, often in top hat and tails, and was soon nicknamed as \\"The Fred Astaire of the Philippines\\". Casimiro also first appeared in film in 1938, when he was cast in Bayan at Pag-ibig, a production of Excelsior Pictures. Upon the Japanese invasion of the Philippines in 1941, local film production was halted, allowing bodabil to thrive as the main source of public entertainment. Along with such actors as Rogelio de la Rosa, Norma Blancaflor and the comic team of Tugo and Pugo, Casimiro would perform at the Life Theater in Manila for the duration of the war. He would form his own comic tandem with Jose Cris Soto, and the pair would be promoted as the \\"Laurel and Hardy of the Philippines\\". Casimiro would also be paired with Dolphy, then appearing under the stage name \\"Golay\\", to form a comic dance team. Film and television career After the war, Casimiro restarted his film career, appearing in several popular musicals for the next two decades. His frequent onscreen dancing partner was the choreographer Nieves Manuel, whom he would marry. As in his stage performances, he would often appear in films in top hat and tails. Among his more notable musical roles were in Isang Sulyap mo Tita (1953), Tres Muskiteras (1954), and Botika sa Baryo (1960). Later career As he aged, Casimiro became known to a younger generation primarily as a character actor in film comedies. Often cast as a grandfather, a town sage, or even as a corpse in the Chiquito vehicle Estong Tutong (1983), his thin frame and befuddled look lent to easy ridicule. A notable exception to this trend was his role in Celso Ad. Castillo's Burlesk Queen (1977), where he again donned top hat and tails as he performed onstage with Vilma Santos. Death Bayani Casimiro Sr. died on January 27, 1989 in Manila, Philippines and he has a final resting place at the Loyola Memorial Park in Sucat, Paranaque City. Tribute & Legacy His most prominent role in later years was as the father of Enteng Kabisote (Vic Sotto) in the popular sitcom Okey Ka Fairy Ko!. Casimiro died less than two years into the run of Okey Ka Fairy Ko. His son, Bayani Casimiro, Jr., soon joined the cast as Prinsipe ng Kahilingan. In obvious tribute to his father, Casimiro Jr.'s character would perform a brief tap dance upon his every entrance and exit. Personal life Casimiro's widow, Nieves Manuel, would later marry Chiquito Pangan's brother, Rene Pangan. She died in 2006.

He also wrote books and several newspaper articles extolling Hindu culture and tradition and urging its adoption by Europeans settled in India, and deploring the attitudes and activities of the Utilitarians and missionaries who deprecated Indian culture. He is mentioned in William Dalrymple's book White Mughals (2002). Background and family Stuart was said to be the son of Thomas Smyth, Mayor of Limerick and MP for Limerick City. His grandparents were Charles Smyth (1694‚Äì1783), also MP for Limerick, and Elizabeth, daughter of Sir Thomas Prendergast, 1st Baronet.Spurrell, J. C. In Search of Thomas Smyth, Mayor of Limerick, Irish Family History Journal, Vol. 25 (2009) His nephews included the diplomat Robert Stuart and the naturalist and surgeon James Stuart. The clergyman and footballer Robert King was his great-nephew. In India In his teens, Stuart left Ireland for India, where he remained for the rest of his life. He served in the army and starting as a cadet, he rose through the ranks to become a Major-General. His last command was the Saugor Field Force. Stuart enthusiastically embraced Hindu culture and championed the same in his writings and discourse, which earned him the nickname Hindoo Stuart.Your country needs you. And your beard Guardian UK ‚Äì 9 November 2002 V. C. P. Hodson's biography of Stuart mentions that he \\"had studied the language, manners and customs of the natives of this country with so much enthusiasm, his intimacy with them ... obtained for him the name of Hindoo Stuart\\". Stuart took to Hinduism both in its religious aspects and as a way of daily life. He adopted many Hindu customs and routines of daily life, including bathing in the Ganges at Calcutta every morning. He amassed a collection of Hindu deities and icons of worship. Archie Baron says, in his book An India Affair:Baron A., An Indian Affair, Channel 4 Books (2001) :\\"It was far easier to break into Muslim society than the exclusive and mysterious world of brahminical Hinduism which makes 'Hindoo Stuart' a rarity even among White Moghuls.... His Hinduism was on open display to the whole of Calcutta. As far as one can tell, this does not seem to have set back his career.‚Äù He quickly took to wearing Indian clothes, and this became his normal garb when off the parade ground. He encouraged his Indian sepoys to wear full moustaches in the Indian style on parade. His commander-in-chief \\"ticked him off\\" due to his partiality towards sepoys sporting \\"Rajput moustaches or brightly coloured caste marks on their foreheads‚Äù. Declaring Indian garments best suited to the weather of India, he actively promoted their adoption by Europeans settled in India. He wrote newspaper articles on this subject frequently (\\"frequent and vigorous\\" contributions to the daily Calcutta Telegraph in the year 1800) and strongly encouraged European ladies in India to adopt the sari. Stuart published his letters extolling the virtues of \\"elegant, simple, sensible, and sensual\\" Indian saris vis-a-vis \\"the prodigious structural engineering Europeon (sic) women strapped themselves into, in order to hold their bellies in, project their breasts out and allow their dresses to balloon grandly up and over towards the floor\\" along with some replies by \\"outraged\\" white women in a \\"deliciously silly volume\\" entitled The Ladies Monitor, Being A Series of Letters First published in Bengal on the Subject of Female Apparel Tending to Favour a regulated adoption of Indian Costume And a rejection of Superfluous Vesture By the Ladies of this country With Incidental remarks on Hindoo Beauty, Whale-Bone Stays, Iron Busks, Indian Corsets, Man-Milliners, Idle Bachelors, Hair-Powder, Waiting Maids, And Footmen. Some of the reasons he cites for European women to give up iron busks are: Firstly wearing iron busks makes women highly susceptible to lightning strikes (exhorting them with sentences such as \\"This is no laughing matter ladies for I am absolutely serious\\"). Secondly by discarding iron busks from their wardrobes, European women would immensely enhance the supply of iron in Bengal for farmers who desperately need new wagon wheels. Archie Baron says, in his book An India Affair::\\"For all this lubriciousness, Stuart should not be regarded as some dirty old man or prototype sex tourist....Baron A., An Indian Affair, Channel 4 Books (2001) In his book Vindication of the Hindoos (1808), Stuart criticised the work of European missionaries in India, claiming that: :\\"Hinduism little needs the meliorating hand of Christianity to render its votaries a sufficiently correct and moral people for all the useful purposes of a civilised society.\\" In this book. Stuart defends Hinduism from assaults by missionaries explaining: :\\"Wherever I look around me, in the vast ocean of Hindu mythology, I discover Piety....Morality...and as far as I can rely on my judgement, it appears the most complete and ample system of Moral Allegory that the world has ever produced.\\" Throughout this book Stuart, warns of the dangers of the \\"obnoxious\\" missionaries and of attempts to convert Indians to Christianity, a process he describes as \\"impolitic, inexpedient, dangerous, unwise and insane\\". He asks \\"if their religion is insulted what confidence can we repose in the fidelity of our Hindu soldiers?\\" presaging, it is said, some of the causes of the Mutiny of 1857. Legacy The tomb of Major General Charles Stuart at South Park Street Cemetery at Kolkata. Though Stuart often spoke of his conversion to Hinduism he had not entirely rejected Christian doctrines as he held the Hindu deity Krishna to be the Spirit of God who descends upon earth for the benefit of mankind which he believed was \\"not very inconsistent with Christianity\\" and \\"he was content to be buried in an Anglican cemetery, albeit along with his favourite idols\\". Stuart died on 31 March 1828 and was buried with his deities at the South Park Street Cemetery in Calcutta,The South Park Street Cemetery, Calcutta, published by the Association for the Preservation of Historical Cemeteries in India, 5th ed., 2009 in a tomb which took the form of a Hindu temple.

In August 2007, he was convicted, along with Padilla, of conspiracy and material support charges and sentenced to a prison term of 15 years, 8 months. Hassoun had been a computer programmer and resident of Broward County, Florida. Sofian Abdelaziz, a member of the American Muslim Association of North America, who knew Hassoun from his activity in the Florida Muslim community, made this comment on Hassoun: \\"I would consider him that he's against violence, but he has a strong tongue, you know, he has a strong tongue!\\" Hassoun was charged in connection with his financing of Padilla's trip to Egypt. Prosecutors alleged that Hassoun set up a local office of the charity Benevolence International, which was used as a front for al Qaeda. A 2011 NPR report claimed he was being held in a highly restrictive Communication Management Unit. When Hassoun finished his sentence, in 2017, as a non-citizen, he would normally have been deported.

Like other woodswallows, it has a short curve bill and a short square tail and long wings. It is usually seen perched in groups, high on powerlines, tall bare trees and most often in areas with a predominance of tall palm trees. Description In flight, the broad base to the wings gives it a very triangular outline (Hyderabad, India) This stocky woodswallow has an ashy grey upperparts with a darker head and a narrow pale band on the rump. The underside is pinkish grey and the short slaty black tail is tipped in white. The finch-like bill is silvery. In flight the long wing looks very broad at the base giving it a very triangular outline. The first primary is very short. The legs are short and the birds usually perch on high vantage points from which they make aerial sallies. There are no geographic variations in plumage and no subspecies have been designated. Males and females are indistinguishable in the field, however an old report suggests that the sexes differ in the colour of the inside of the mouth. Young birds appear barred on the underside. Habitat and distribution Ashy woodswallows huddling Woodswallows are found in a range of habitats from the plains to about 2000 m, over cultivated areas, in forest clearings and often in areas with tall palm trees. The species is widely distributed across Bangladesh, India, Nepal, Sri Lanka, Thailand, Myanmar, Laos, Malaysia and China. They are absent in the very arid regions of western India. They have been recorded on the island of Maldives. Behaviour and ecology Ashy woodswallows are usually seen in small groups. Several birds may sit huddled side-by-side on the bare branches of a tall tree, sometimes preening each other. They also perch on high vantage points such as powerlines and pylons. From their perches, they make aerial sallies, flapping and gliding to capture insects in the air. Insects may be caught in the beak, transferred and held in their feet, torn up with their bill and swallowed without returning to the perch. They may also return to the perch with prey to feed and will sometimes sit on the ground and have been known to visit bird baths. Although mainly feeding on insects, they may take nectar from flowers of trees such as Erythrina. They have been recorded feeding on toxic butterflies of the family Danaiidae such as Euploea core which are avoided by other birds. The breeding season in India is March to June, the nest is a shallow cup placed at some height such as at the base of the frond of a tall palm or a hollow atop a street lighting post. The usual clutch consists of 2‚Äì3 greenish white eggs with brown spots. Both parents take part in nest building, incubation and feeding the young. They will mob larger birds such as crows and birds of prey that approach too close to the nesting birds. The song consists of a varied combination of wheezy notes that may include imitations of the calls of other birds. The usual call is shrill nasal chewk. They make seasonal movements, possibly in response to rainfall. The woodswallows, Artamidae, are among the few perching birds that have special feathers called powder down that break up into fine dust that is spread by the birds onto their body when preening. Powder down is also found in the egrets. Members of the family have a brush- tipped tongue. They also have some of the thoracic vertebrae fused into a structure called the notarium. A species of ectoparasitic birdlouse, Menacanthus elbeli, and a mite that lives inside the feather quill have been described from hosts of this species. Other organisms associated with the species include endoparasitic trematodes Plagiorchis dactylopharynx, Papillatrema echinata and Stomylotrema travassosi.

Owned by the Toronto Daily Star it is notable for hosting the first live play-by-play ice hockey broadcast on February 8, 1923.\\"Hockey play-by-play was born in Toronto 90 years ago\\". Toronto Star, February 8, 2013. The station went on the air in June 1922 and closed permanently in 1933. Origins on 9AH Toronto Daily Star owner Joseph E. Atkinson had an early interest in the potential of radio as a promotional device for the newspaper. In early 1922, the Star made arrangements with the Canadian Independent Telephone Company (CITCo) to broadcast a live concert over CITCo's experimental station, 9AH. On March 28, 1922 at 8 p.m., the Star made its first concert broadcast over 9AH at 450 metres (666 kHz) from CITCo's studio on the top floor of the General Electric factory at Wallace Avenue and Ward Street (close to Lansdowne Avenue and Bloor Street West). Performers included Luigi Romanelli's Orchestra, cellist Boris Hambourg, pianist Alberto Guerrero, and violinist Henri Czaplinski. The broadcast was announced, produced, and directed by Dr. Charles A. Culver of CITCo. The broadcast, one of the first of live musical entertainment in Canada, was heard by the approximately 1,000 radio hobbyists in Toronto who owned crystal radio sets as well as by an audience at the Christie Street Military Hospital, where a radio receiver had been set up, and by an audience of over 1,100 gathered at the Masonic Temple who heard the transmission on a radio receiver set up on the stage. The broadcast was heard as far away as Napanee, Ontario, Georgian Bay, and upstate New York. The success of the broadcast led the Star to commission a series of 19 concerts that were transmitted from April to mid-June 1922 over 9AH. As well, the Star, beginning April 10, 1922, broadcast a daily half-hour program at 7 p.m. on 450 metres with content varying from financial and sports bulletins, guest speakers, live music, bedtime children's stories read by a librarian, and a political bulletin telegraphed from The Star's correspondent in Ottawa. The Star's radio service also became the first in Canada to broadcast a church service when it carried the Easter morning service conducted by Reverend W .A. Cameron at Bloor Street Baptist Church. Cameron would go on to broadcast Sunday morning sermons over the CFCA for a decade making him one of the best known preachers in Canada. Launch of CFCA During this period, the Star applied for and received one among the first batch of 62 commercial radio licenses issued by the Department of Marine and Fisheries which, at the time, was responsible for radio. CFCA was licensed to broadcast on 400 metres (equivalent to 750 kHz) and began broadcasting on June 22, 1922 from studios in the Toronto Daily Star building at 18-20 King Street West. A steel transmitter had been installed on top of the building and a radio van was acquired which would roam Toronto parks and other public areas in order to broadcast CFCA's signal over loudspeakers in order to encourage the purchase of radio receivers. On February 8, 1923, the first live play-by- play hockey broadcast was made when Toronto Daily Star sports reporter Norman Albert called the third period of an Ontario Hockey Association intermediate playoff game at Arena Gardens between North Toronto and Midland The broadcast was successful and, on February 14, 1922, a professional hockey game carried on CFCA between the Toronto St. Pats and the Ottawa Senators became the first NHL game to be broadcast on radio.Kitchen, Paul (2008). Win, Lose or Wrangle: The Inside Story of the Old Ottawa Senators - 1883-1935. Manotick, Ontario: Penumbra Press, page 246 On February 16, 1922 (according to some sources), his colleague Foster Hewitt, called an OHA game between the Toronto Argonaut Rowing Club and the Kitchener Greenshirts which went into three periods of overtime. Hewitt would take over from Albert as CFCA's sports announcer and continue to broadcast live hockey games on CFCA from Arena Gardens as the Toronto St. Pats became the Toronto Maple Leafs on a programme that would evolve into Hockey Night in Canada after the team moved to Maple Leaf Gardens. Hewitt would also announce horse racing from Woodbine Racetrack, one of the first such broadcasts in the world, along with other sporting events. In August 1922, as part of \\"Radio Year\\" at the Canadian National Exhibition, CFCA in co-operation with CITCo and its station CKCE (formerly 9AH) constructed a Radio Building to display radio equipment, as well as setting up loudspeakers over which CFCA and CKCE's special broadcasts of speech and music could be heard for 8 hours a day in order to expose the general public to radio broadcasts and encourage them to purchase radio receivers. As part of these special demonstrations, CFCA initiated regular newscasts and weather bulletins. Notable broadcasts included live election results coverage with the Radio Car and loudspeakers in various locations around as well as outside of Toronto being used so that crowds could gather to hear the results. The first such broadcast was of the British general election of November 15, 1922 followed by the Toronto municipal elections held on January 1, 1923, and live coverage of the June 25, 1923 Ontario general election results, as well as coverage of federal election results in 1925 and 1926. Election results broadcasts including use of the Radio Car and loudspeakers in multiple locations around as well as outside of Toronto being used so that crowds could gather to hear the results.\\"Old Media, New Media, Intermedia: The Toronto Star and CFCA, 1922‚Äì1933\\", in Cultural Industries.ca: Making Sense of Canadian Media in the Digital Age, pages 233-234 Other notable broadcasts occurred in February 1924, when CFCA was requested by Canadian Press to broadcast summaries of CP wire dispatches to provincial newspapers as telegraph and telephone wires had been downed in a storm. These broadcasts over one particular weekend also corrected erroneous rumours of the death of Canadian prime minister William Lyon Mackenzie King, which otherwise would not have been corrected until newspapers resumed publishing on Monday. In 1925, the station experimented with remote control broadcasting in order to broadcast the tercentenary celebration of Samuel de Champlain from Orillia by long- distance telephone, and in 1928, CFCA became one of the first North American stations to re-broadcast short wave transmissions from Europe, first - from the BBC's 2LO in London, England, and again two weeks later when it relayed a program from Australia and a speech from the Prince of Wales in London. CFCA hired Hart House musical director Reginald Stewart, to create and lead Canada's first radio orchestra, consisting of 50 musicians, for the station's regular dance program, Hour of Good Music. According to a modern Toronto Star article on the station: \\"A typical broadcasting day for CFCA in 1923 began at noon with a weather report. From 2:30 to 3:30 p.m. there were agricultural reports, news and music. Closing stock market figures and late-day news were aired from 5:30 to 6 p.m. From 8 to 9 every evening, there was a live concert.\\" In 1924, CFCA's studios moved to the top of the Procter & Gamble building at Yonge Street and St. Clair Avenue. CNR Radio, Canada's first radio network, leased time on CFCA as a phantom radio station operating with the call letters CNRT, until the network disbanded in 1932. While leasing CFCA's transmitter and frequency, CNRT would broadcast from its own studio located in the King Edward Hotel.Canadian Communications Foundation: Phantom Stations While other stations in Toronto were given licenses in Toronto, none would begin regular broadcasts until 1925 and CKCE, owned by CITCo as the successor of 9AH, broadcast only intermittently before going off the air permanently in 1924.https://www.broadcasting-history.ca/listing_and_histories/radio/ckce-am As a result, CFCA enjoyed several years of almost exclusive radio coverage in the city competing only with radio stations from the United States. From 1925 to 1928, however, several other stations when on the air and due to the technology of the period, had to share frequencies by broadcasting at different times of the day. Due to seniority, CFCA was able to obtain a prime time evening time slot for its broadcasts. In 1928, CFCA was given exclusive rights over 770 kHz allowing it to extend its broadcast schedule. However, the rival Conservative Toronto Telegram newspaper, which broadcast on CKGW, accused the pro-Liberal Party Daily Star of benefiting from favouritism. The resulting controversy led the Liberal government to create the Aird Commission to investigate the state of radio in Canada and recommend policy. In 1929, the Aird Commission recommended a national radio policy which would cancel all private radio licenses and instead create a state-owned monopoly that would operate a public radio network along the lines of the British Broadcasting Corporation. Atkinson and the Star endorsed the proposals. Decline CFCA fell behind its competitors due to the Atkinson's hesitance to invest in new equipment and facilities for the station, due to his belief that the Aird Commission's recommendations would be implemented bringing privately owned radio stations to an end. Plans for a new state of the art studio to be constructed in the Daily Star‚Ä≤s new headquarters, which opened in 1929, never came to fruition, resulting in the station failing to keep pace with the latest technological developments. The station's transmission power remained at 100 watts while rival CKGW, which was utilized by the Toronto Telegram newspaper, was transmitting at 10,000 Watts by the end of the decade. Mackenzie King's Liberal government was defeated by the Conservatives led by R.B. Bennett. When Bennett's government passed a Broadcasting Act in 1932, a national public broadcaster in the form of the Canadian Radio Broadcasting Commission was created. The Act did not ban private radio stations, however it restricted their power to 100 Watts. CFCA ceased operations a year later, on September 1, 1933, with Atkinson declaring that the Star had no interest in competing with a public broadcaster. Additionally, the cost of updating CFCA's antiquated equipment had risen to $100,000 by 1933 which given the restriction on the station's transmitter power, would have appeared to be a poor investment of resources during the Great Depression. After the closure of CFCA, the Star remained involved in radio until 1946 by providing content such as news bulletins to CRCT, the Toronto affiliate of the new Canadian Radio Broadcasting Commission and continued to do so when CRCT became CBL, the flagship of the Canadian Broadcasting Corporation when it succeeded the CRBC in 1937. In 1947, the Star considered re-entering radio broadcasting by applying for an early FM radio license but did not end up pursuing the initiative. The AM 770 frequency in Toronto is occupied by WTOR, a daytime- only border blaster station licensed to and broadcasting from Youngstown, New York. Under the North American Regional Broadcasting Agreement, CFCA (had it survived until 1941) would have been required to move up to AM 780, a frequency that is not occupied in the Toronto market.

She measured 974 tons, with powerful rifled guns and a very fast speed of . She served the Union Navy in the Union blockade of the rivers and other waterways of the Confederate States of America. Constructed in Portland, Maine Agawam ‚Äî the first U.S. Navy vessel to carry that name ‚Äî was built at Portland, Maine, by George W. Lawrence. She was laid down in October 1862, launched on 21 April 1863, and commissioned on 9 March 1864, Commander Alexander Rhind in command. She was based on the same plans as . Civil War service=Capture of the Chesapeake by Southern agents On 9 December 1863, some three months before Agawam was placed in full commission, Southern agents and sympathizers had boarded the steam packet Chesapeake at New York City under the guise of being passengers bound for Portland, Maine. Shortly after midnight on the 7th, when the liner had reached a point some north of the tip of Cape Cod, these men revealed their formerly concealed side arms and took over the ship, killing her second engineer. From there, they took the ship to Canadian waters in the hope that their daring act would provoke Union warships into violating British neutrality and thereby embroil the United States in a war with England. When word of Chesapeakes capture reached Portland, the deputy collector of customs at that port wired Rear Admiral Francis Gregory, the supervisor of construction of all Union warships then being built in private shipyards, informing him of the loss and requesting permission to arm, man, and send out in pursuit the unfinished but seaworthy Agawam. Temporary arms, officers, and men for the new warship would come from the revenue cutter James C. Dobbin which had arrived at Portland in July. The Navy's extant records seem to contain no report of Agawams chase of Chesapeake. The Federal correspondence contains both statements maintaining that she did at least get underway and evidence indicating that she did not. In any case, after being commissioned, Agawam remained in the Portsmouth Navy Yard fitting out until standing down Portsmouth Harbor on 17 March. However, she returned to the yard two days later and entered drydock for repairs before heading back to Portland on 18 April. Assigned to the North Atlantic blockade Assigned to the North Atlantic Blockading Squadron, the gunboat departed Portland on 6 May. Agawam reached Hampton Roads, Virginia on 9 May and two days later stood up the James River to join other Union ships in protecting Benjamin Butler's transports and supply ships which were threatened by torpedoes (naval mines), shore batteries, and a possible attack by Confederate ironclads which were lying in the river above the Confederate batteries of Fort Darling at Drewry's Bluff. The danger lurking in the muddy waters of the James River had recently been emphasized by the sinking of on the 6th while that side-wheel ferryboat was dragging for Southern torpedoes, or, in 20th century parlance, floating and submerged mines. On the 14th, Rear Admiral Samuel Phillips Lee, the commander of the North Atlantic Blockading Squadron, shifted his flag from to Agawam since the latter drew less water and thus would enable him to supervise minesweeping operations more closely, and he remained in the new side-wheeler while giving his primary attention to operations in the James during the ensuing month and one-half. Agawams first taste of fire Agawams first combat came at dawn on the 18th when she shelled Confederate forces > . . . intrenching the heights at Hewlett's house, commanding Trent's Reach, a straight stretch of the river flowing east along the northeastern section of Bermuda Hundred. During this time, besides serving as the squadron flagship, she helped to clear the river of mines, was a mobile platform for observation of Confederate activity along both banks of the river, acted as an intelligence and communication clearinghouse, and used her guns to suppress Southern batteries ashore. From first planning to land a force at Bermuda Hundred, General Butler had been fearful that Confederate warships might descend from Richmond and sink his transports and supply ships. Once his troops were actually ashore on the south side of the river, the general's anxiety was intensified by daily rumors reporting that the South was ready to launch just such an offensive. For instance, late in May, a deserter from the Southern gunboat Hampton warned that > . . . the enemy have now below Drewry's Bluff three ironclads, six smaller > gunboats, plated with boiler iron . . . all mounted with torpedoes, and nine > fire ships . . . to attack at as early a moment as practicable . . . . Confident in the ability of his warships, Admiral Lee was eager to meet the Southern squadron and was hopeful that his flotilla might ascend the James past the batteries at Drewry's Bluff and capture Richmond. As a result, he constantly opposed obstructing the channel. However, early in June, Ulysses S. Grant decided to shift the Army of the Potomac from its lines at Cold Harbor across the James to join Butler in operations against Richmond from the south. Blocking the James River This plan made Union control of the river even more important and prompted Washington, D.C., to insist upon blocking the channel. The first stone-laden schooner was sunk on 15 June, and the operation continued until Union Army leaders felt safe from Southern ironclads. Ship's officers and crewmen pose on deck, while she was serving on the James River, Virginia, August 1864. Some of the ship's officers relaxing on deck, while she was serving on the James River, Virginia, in the summer of 1864. This barrier increased the security of Union shipping on the James and reduced the burden on the Union warships on the river, freeing Admiral Lee to attend to squadron matters elsewhere. As a result, he shifted his flag back to Malvern on the last day of June and returned to Hampton Roads. Agawam remained upriver where, despite the obstructions, she found ample opportunity to use her fighting skills. The presence of the tremendous concentration of Union troops south of Richmond had goaded defenders of the Confederate capital into desperate measures to interrupt Union shipping on the James. The day after Admiral Lee left her, Agawam and fired on a fortified position inside Four Mile Creek, whence Southern five guns had recently fired upon , and in the months that followed, frequently engaged batteries hiding along the banks of the strategic stream. Early in July, Lieutenant George Dewey relieved Rhind in temporary command of the ship ‚Äî his first command ‚Äî but Rhind was back when Agawam fought her most memorable battle. About two hours past noon on 13 August, three batteries opened fire on the double-ender almost simultaneously from different locations, beginning an engagement which lasted over four hours before dwindling ammunition forced her to withdraw. During the action, three of Agawams men were killed and four wounded. Converting Louisiana into a giant bomb Late in November, boiler trouble forced Agawam downstream for extensive repairs. While the ship was being brought back to fighting trim in the Norfolk Navy Yard, Comdr. Rhind left her temporarily to take command of Louisiana, a steamer which had been selected to perform an unusual and seemingly important task. Rhind took with him a carefully selected group of volunteers from Agawam to man his new ship. They boarded at Beaufort, North Carolina, and took her to waters of Wilmington, North Carolina, for use as a giant bomb to help reduce the defenses of Fort Fisher which guarded that city, the only major port still open to Confederate blockade runners. After several days of delay because of stormy weather, Rhind took the ship close aboard Fort Fisher on the night of 23‚Äì24 December 1864. Her crew then set her ablaze, left the ship, and managed to row to safety before Louisiana exploded. Failed attack on Fort Fisher The concussion failed to detonate the Fort Fisher magazine, and the ensuing amphibious attack proved to be abortive. The troops who went ashore on Christmas Eve to storm the Southern stronghold reembarked the next day and headed back toward Hampton Roads. Rhind and the band of volunteers returned to Agawam which was still undergoing repairs. The work continued through mid-February, and the gunboat finally put to sea on the 16th. She entered Pamlico Sound, North Carolina, two days later and operated in the island waters of that state through the end of the Civil War. Post- war service and disposal Following the war, Agawam operated along the Atlantic coast between Florida and the Virginia Capes for almost two years. She was decommissioned at Norfolk, Virginia, on 31 March 1867. The ship was sold at auction there on 10 October to Mr. James Power. No record of her subsequent career has been found.

Fisher Unwin, is Joseph Conrad's first novel. Set in the late 19th century, it centres on the life of the Dutch trader Kaspar Almayer in the Borneo jungle and his relationship to his mixed heritage daughter Nina. Plot Almayer‚Äôs Folly is about a poor businessman who dreams of finding a hidden gold mine and becoming very wealthy. He is a white European, married to a native Malayan; they have one daughter named Nina. He fails to find the goldmine, and comes home saddened. Previously, he had heard that the British were to conquer the Pantai River, and he had built a large, lavish house near where he resided at the time, in order to welcome the invaders. However, the conquest never took place, and the house remained unfinished. Some passing Dutch seamen had called the house ‚ÄúAlmayer‚Äôs Folly‚Äù. Now, Almayer continually goes out for long trips, but eventually he stops doing so and stays home with his hopeless daydreams of riches and splendor. His native wife loathes him for this. One day, a Malayan prince, Dain Maroola, comes to see Almayer about trading, and while there he falls in love with Nina. Mrs. Almayer keeps arranging meetings between Nina and Dain. She wants them to marry so her daughter could stay native, because she is highly distrustful of white men and their ways. Dain leaves but vows to return to help Almayer find the gold mine. When he does return, he goes straight to Lakamba, a Malayan rajah, and tells him that he found the gold mine and that some Dutchmen had captured his ship. The rajah tells him to kill Almayer before the Dutch arrive because he is not needed to find the gold now. The following morning, an unidentifiable native corpse is found floating in the river, wearing an ankle bracelet very similar to Dain‚Äôs. Almayer is distraught because Dain is his only chance to find the mine. The corpse is actually that of his slave, who had died when his canoe overturned. Mrs. Almayer suggests that Dain put his anklet and ring on the body. Mrs. Almayer plans to smuggle Dain away from the Dutch so he will not be arrested. She sneaks Nina away from her father, who is drinking with the Dutch. When Almayer awakes from his drunken stupor, a native slave girl tells him where Nina has gone, and Almayer tracks her to Dain‚Äôs hiding place. Nina refuses to go back to avoid the slurs of the white society. During all this arguing, the slave girl informs the Dutch of Dain‚Äôs whereabouts. Almayer said that he could never forgive Nina but would help them escape by taking them to the mouth of the river, where a canoe will take them from the clutches of the Dutch. After they escape, Almayer erases the lover‚Äôs footprints, and returns to his house. Mrs. Almayer runs away to the rajah for protection, taking all of Dain‚Äôs dowry with her. All alone, Almayer breaks all his furniture in his home office, piles it in the center of the room, and sets fire to it, burning the entire house to the ground along with it. He spends the rest of his days in ‚Äú[His] Folly‚Äù, where he smokes opium to forget his daughter. He eventually dies there. Criticism As Conrad's earliest novel, Almayer's Folly is often seen by critics as inferior to the author's later work because of its repetitive and at times awkward language. However, recent critics have paid more attention to Conrad's depiction of Nina as a self-determined female non-European characterYvonne Bezrucka (2018) \\"Food for Dreams and an Appetite for Nations: Opium and Darwinian Metaphors in Victorian Literature\\", 'RSV', 44, 31-53 along with Aissa from Joseph Conrad's second novel, An Outcast of the Islands.Harry Sewlall, \\"Postcolonial/Postmodern Spatiality in Almayer's Folly and An OUtcast of the Islands.

This synthetic compound is a viscous, water-soluble yellow liquid. Chemistry Polysorbate 80 is derived from polyethoxylated sorbitan and oleic acid. The hydrophilic groups in this compound are polyethers also known as polyoxyethylene groups, which are polymers of ethylene oxide. In the nomenclature of polysorbates, the numeric designation following polysorbate refers to the lipophilic group, in this case, the oleic acid (see polysorbate for more detail). The full chemical names for polysorbate 80 are: *Polyoxyethylene (20) sorbitan monooleate *(x)-sorbitan mono-9-octadecenoate poly(oxy-1,2-ethanediyl) The critical micelle concentration of polysorbate 80 in pure water is reported as 0.012 mM.

For example, in ice cream, polysorbate is added up to 0.5% (v/v) concentration to make the ice cream smoother and easier to handle, as well as increasing its resistance to melting. Adding this substance prevents milk proteins from completely coating the fat droplets. This allows them to join together in chains and nets, which hold air in the mixture, and provide a firmer texture that holds its shape as the ice cream melts. Health and beauty use Polysorbate 80 is also used as a surfactant in soaps and cosmetics (including eyedrops), or a solubilizer such as in a mouthwash. The cosmetic grade of polysorbate 80 may have more impurities than the food grade. Medical use Polysorbate 80 is an excipient that is used to stabilize aqueous formulations of medications for parenteral administration, and used as an emulsifier in the making of the popular antiarrhythmic amiodarone. It is also used as an excipient in some European and Canadian influenza vaccines.Pandemic H1N1 (pH1N1) Influenza Vaccine Quick Reference Guide Winnipeg Regional Health Authority 2009 Influenza vaccines contain 2.5 Œºg of polysorbate 80 per dose.

It was written by Laurence James under the house name James Axler. Plot synopsis A particularly rough MAT-TRANS jump takes Ryan Cawdor and his friends to a clean, almost immaculate arrival chamber. A cautious exploration of the nearby control room shows it to be similarly clean, free of dust or any form of decay. It is only when Doc Tanner discovers a cup of recently brewed, sweetened coffee that the companions realize the room may have been recently used. Instead of the usual blast doors, the room's exit appears to be some form of airlock; nearby readouts indicate the outside air pressure is very low. Ryan cautiously opens the exterior door in the hopes that the equipment is simply malfunctioning, only to pass out from a sudden drop in oxygen levels. J. B. Dix pulls him to safety before he succumbs, and shuts the airlock door. The demonstrated lack of atmosphere, combined with a lifeless desert view through the airlock portal and mention of \\"NASA-SEC\\" on warnings above it, lead all the companions to the same unstated conclusion: they are on another world. Seeing something through the portal that alarms him, Ryan orders his friends into the MAT-TRANS chamber to make another jump. When pressed for what prompted the reaction Ryan can only say he saw something gigantic and alive underneath the desert sand. The next jump takes them to a partially damaged arrival chamber. Upon examination the redoubt seems ireminiscent of a hidden redoubt the companions previously visited. Numerous earthshifts have blocked of much of this deep-buried redoubt, including the upper reaches of the staircase leading out of it. With no other choice the companions make use of an ancient elevator to reach the exit. Some ten feet from the top it stops functioning as the cables lifting it begin to fray. The companions narrowly escape through the elevator's maintenance hatch, and hang from the snapped cable strands as the elevator drops hundreds of feet to the bottom of the shaft. J. B. blows the door atop the shaft with plas-ex, allowing everyone to swing to safety. The elevator shaft opens to a destroyed Victorian house in a similarly destroyed city. Ryan guesses it might be the ruins of New York, which is confirmed when the group encounters an armed teen named Dred. Dred explains (at gunpoint) that he is the king of the \\"turf\\" the companions are in, which they acknowledge. A truce is established, and Dred takes the group with him to one of his hideouts in the basement of a ruined house. They are later joined by Retha, Dred's \\"slut\\".

Lesbian, gay, bisexual and transgender (LGBT) stereotypes are conventional, formulaic generalizations, opinions, or images based on the sexual orientations or gender identities of LGBT people. Stereotypical perceptions may be acquired through interactions with parents, teachers, peers and mass media, or, more generally, through a lack of firsthand familiarity, resulting in an increased reliance on generalizations. Negative stereotypes are often associated with homophobia, lesbophobia, biphobia, or transphobia. Positive stereotypes, or counterstereotypes, also exist. In general=Religion While LGBT people are associated with irreligiousness, the Human Rights Campaign promotes the idea that an individual can be gay and religious. Harry Knox, a gay minister, has led this movement since 2005. \\"Seventy-two percent of adults describe their faith as \\"very important\\" in their lives, so do sixty percent of gays and lesbians\\" (US News). Activists are working to bridge the gap between religion and homosexuality and to make denominations friendlier to the community. Many Protestants have opened their doors and the United Church of Christ has ordained gay ministers since 1972. LGBT clergy are also ordained in the Episcopal Church of America and the Presbyterian Church (US). The National Gay and Lesbian Task Force has worked with Jewish individuals in the LGBT community,\\"Human Rights Campaign's Harry Knox Is Candidate for Senior Pastor of Houston's Resurrection Metropolitan Community Church.\\" Human Rights Campaign's Harry Knox Is Candidate for Senior Pastor of Houston's Resurrection Metropolitan... Web. 23 Oct. 2014. and organizations like Keshet continue to work with Jewish members of the community both to raise awareness of LGBTQ issues in Jewish communities and Jewish issues in LGBTQ communities. Media For years, the media has been moving forward in equally representing members of the LGBT community. While there may still not be many prominent LGBT characters in the mainstream media, the community has completed many milestones in the recent years. In 2016, the coming-of-age drama film Moonlight became the first LGBT movie to win the Best Picture Oscar. In 2018, Love, Simon also became the first film from a major studio that focused on the hardships of being a closeted gay teenager. On the other hand, LGBT members continue to be underrepresented and typecast. Disney has represented the LGBT community in around 8% of its films as of 2016. Other companies such as 20th Century Fox, Sony, Lionsgate and Warner Bros have featured LGBT characters in up to only 21% of their films. Murder and violence LGBT rights activists have fought against fictional representations of LGBT people that depict them as violent and murderous. Columnist Brent Hartinger observed that \\"big-budget Hollywood movies until, perhaps, Philadelphia in 1993 that featured major gay male characters portrayed them as insane villains and serial killers\\". Community members organized protests and boycotts against films with murderous gay, lesbian, bisexual, and transgender characters, including Cruising (1980), Silence of the Lambs (1991), and Basic Instinct (1992). Theatre scholar Jordan Schildcrout has written about the recurrence of the \\"homicidal homosexual\\" in American plays, but notes that LGBT playwrights themselves have appropriated this negative stereotype to confront and subvert homophobia. Such plays include The Lisbon Traviata (1985) by Terrence McNally, Porcelain (1992) by Chay Yew, The Secretaries (1993) by the Five Lesbian Brothers, and The Dying Gaul (1998) by Craig Lucas. Lesbians Actress Portia de Rossi came out as a lesbian in the early 2000s. Many 20th-century films put a negative connotation on the lesbian community. The 1961 drama The Children's Hour gives viewers the idea that lesbians live a \\"dark\\" and almost depressing lifestyle.Myers, Randy. \\"Hollywood Has a Long History of Stereotyping Gays, Lesbians.\\" Elvaq.com.

Jefferson, North Carolina: McFarland & Company, Inc., Publishers (2006): 125 However, at the same time, the series came under heavy criticism for reinforcing numerous other negative stereotypes, such as lesbians preying on and seducing straight women in relationships with men; mistreating bisexual women or outright shunning them if they had a history of sleeping with men; for downplaying the main characters' misdeeds and unexplained tendency for adultery and instead focusing on their physical beauty and sex scenes; for randomly killing off main characters for no specific reason (referred to as \\"bury your gays\\"); for downplaying a rape scene as \\"angry sex\\"; reportedly attempting to \\"reify heteronormativity\\";Samuel A.

Series creator Ilene Chaiken was labeled as \\"shameless in her professional upbringing\\" for her depiction of lesbians in general. In the television series Gotham, the character Renee Montoya is a lesbian and recovering drug addict, while the characters Fish Mooney, Barbara Kean and Tabitha Galvan are bisexual. Fish Mooney is introduced as the second-in- command of mafia boss Carmine Falcone, with a penchant for ruthlessness and ambition to overthrow both Falcone and Sal Maroni and become Gotham's sole crime boss. Montoya does not hide her grudge against James Gordon for being in a relationship with Barbara, her former lover. When rumors surface that Gordon may be corrupt, it is implied that Montoya is not entirely convinced, but she nevertheless becomes determined to put Gordon behind bars in the hopes of winning Barbara back rather than enforcing justice, even though it will cost the Gotham City Police Department one of its few honest cops determined to bring Falcone and Maroni down, and after she briefly succeeds in resuming her affair with Barbara, she pushes Barbara away when Barbara appears to be going back to depression and drug addiction. After Gordon begins a relationship with Leslie Thompkins, Barbara is driven insane with jealousy and eventually progresses to become one of the series' main antagonists. The second season introduces Tabitha Galvan, the bisexual sister of Theo Galvan, and who is also depicted as a ruthless, sadistic mercenary who has an on-again-off-again relationship with Barbara. Many lesbians are associated with short hair, wearing baggy clothes and playing sports.Geiger, Wendy. \\"College Students' multiple Stereotypes of Lesbians: A Cognitive Further, news coverage of LGBT issues reinforces stereotyped portrayals of lesbians. Often news broadcasts highlight stories on more \\"masculine\\" lesbians and fail to give equal coverage to other more faceted lesbian identities. Thus, the populations who receive information about marginalized communities from a news source begin to equate lesbian sexuality with a masculine presentation. The way lesbians are portrayed leads people to make assumptions about individuals in everyday life.Stossel, John, and Gena Binkley. \\"Gay Stereotypes: Are They True?\\" ABC News. ABC News Network, 15 Sept. 2006. Web. 16 Oct. 2014. Typically, lesbians are stereotyped as belonging to one of the two following categories: \\"butch and femme\\". Butch lesbians dress in a more masculine manner than other women. \\"Dykes\\" (a pejorative term that the Lesbian community has reclaimed, to an extent) are considered members of a community that is perceived as being composed of strong and outspoken advocates in wider society. Actress Portia de Rossi has been credited for significantly countering the general societal misconception of how lesbians look and function when, in 2005, she divulged her sexual orientation in intimate interviews with Details and The Advocate which generated further discussion on the concept of the \\"lipstick lesbian\\" (\\"femme\\" women who tend to be \\"hyper-feminine\\"). These stereotypes play out within the LGBTIQ+ community itself, with many women reporting feeling rejected by the queer community for not appearing or acting in the accepted way. Lesbian feminists assert that a sexual component is unnecessary for a woman to declare herself a lesbian if her primary and closest relationships are with women, on the basis that, when considering past relationships within an appropriate historical context, there were times when love and sex were separate and unrelated notions.Rothblum, Esther, Brehony, Kathleen, eds. (1993). Boston Marriages: Romantic But Asexual Relationships Among Contemporary Lesbians, University of Massachusetts Press. , p. 4‚Äì7. In 1989, an academic cohort called the Lesbian History Group wrote: Gay men twink and a bear can be seen in this group of men in the Capital Gay Pride parade in Albany, New York in June 2009. The young blond (center), Naked Boy News host J.Son Dinant, is generally considered twink-ish because of his slender build and overall youthful appearance, while the man on the right, porn star Manuel Torres, would generally be considered a bear because of his stocky build and body hair.Scott Jacobson, Todd Levin, Jason Roede, Sex: Our Bodies, Our Junk, pages 204-206, Random House, Inc., 2010, , .Joan Z. Spade, Catherine G. Valentine, The kaleidoscope of gender: prisms, patterns, and possibilities, Pine Forge Press, 2007, pages 293-296, , . Homosexual men are often equated interchangeably with heterosexual women by the heterocentric mainstream and are frequently stereotyped as being effeminate, despite the fact that gender expression, gender identity and sexual orientation are widely accepted to be distinct from each other. The \\"flaming queen\\" is a characterization that melds flamboyance and effeminacy, remaining a gay male stock character in Hollywood.The Celluloid Closet; (1995) Rob Epstein and Jeffrey Friedman. Theatre, specifically Broadway musicals, are a component of another stereotype, the \\"show queen\\", which generalizes that gay men are involved with the performing arts, and are theatrical, overly dramatic, and camp. The bear subculture of the LGBT community is composed of generally large, hairy men, referred to as bears. They embrace their image, and some will shun more effeminate gay men, such as twinks, and vice versa.  Appearance and mannerisms  Gay men are often associated with a lisp or a feminine speaking tone. Fashion and effeminacy have long been seen as stereotypes of homosexuality. They are often based on the visibility of the reciprocal relationship between gay men and fashion. Designers, including Dolce & Gabbana, have made use of homoerotic imagery in their advertising. Some commentators argue this encourages the stereotype that most gay men enjoy shopping. A limp wrist is also a mannerism associated with gay men.Encyclopedia of Lesbian and Gay Histories and Cultures - Page 491, Bonnie Zimmerman - 2000 Recent research by Cox and colleagues demonstrated that \\"gaydar\\" is often used as an alternate label for using stereotypes, especially those related to appearance and mannerisms, to infer orientation.  Sex and relationships  Gay men on a pride parade float in Rome. Research also suggests that lesbians may be slightly more likely than gay men to be in steady relationships. In terms of unprotected sex, a 2007 study cited two large population surveys as showing that \\"the majority of gay men had similar numbers of unprotected sexual partners annually as straight men and women\\". Another study found that gay men sometimes faced social boundaries because of this stereotype. Participants in the study reported finding it difficult to befriend other gay men on a platonic basis. They found that when they would engage with other gay men there would be an assumption of sexual motivations, and when it became clear that this was not the case the other men would not be interested in continuing socialising. These stereotypes permeate throughout all facets of society, even influencing those subjected to it. Another persistent stereotype associated with the gay male community is excessive partying. Before the Stonewall riots in 1969, most LGBT people were extremely private and closeted, and house parties, bars, and taverns became some of the few places where they could meet, socialize, and feel safe. The riots represented the start of the modern LGBT social movement and acceptance of sexual and gender minorities, which has steadily increased since. Festive and party-like social occasions remain at the core of organizing and fundraising in the LGBT community. In cities where there are large populations of LGBT people, benefits and bar fundraisers are still common, and alcohol companies invest heavily in LGBT-oriented marketing. Ushered in by underground gay clubs and disc jockeys, the disco era kept the \\"partying\\" aspect vibrant and ushered in the more hardcore circuit party movement, hedonistic and associated with party and play.DANCE OF DEATH, First of three parts, CRYSTAL METH FUELS HIV Christopher Heredia, May 4, 2003, SF Gate The relationship between gay men and female heterosexual \\"fag hags\\" has become highly stereotypical. The accepted behaviors in this type of relationship can predominantly include physical affections (such as kissing and touching), as in the sitcom Will & Grace.

The drug chosen is typically methamphetamine, known as crystal or tina in the gay community. Other \\"party drugs\\" such as MDMA and GHB are less associated with this term. While PNP probably has its genesis in the distinct subculture of methamphetamine users, and is most associated with its use, it has become somewhat generalized to include partying with other drugs thought to enhance sexual experiences, especially MDMA, GHB, and cocaine. A report from the National HIV Prevention Conference (a collaborative effort by the U.S. Centers for Disease Control and Prevention and other governmental and non-government organizations) describes PNP as \\"sexual behavior under the influence of crystal meth or other 'party' drugs.\\" It has been referred to as both an \\"epidemic\\" and a \\"plague\\" in the gay community. A meta-analysis of studies between 1996 and 2012 found that \\"some studies report that gay men are more likely to use alcohol and illicit drugs than heterosexual men, while other studies report that gay and heterosexual men do not differ in alcohol and illicit drug use, alcohol-related problems, or treatment utilization, and still other studies report that gay men in college are less likely to binge drink than their heterosexual counterparts.\\" Research on the minority stress model shows stigma toward gay men may contribute to elevated substance use. Representatives for Drugscope state that methamphetamine use is relatively unknown in the UK outside this PNP subculture, and it largely occurs in the heavy-end party scene. Pedophilia and predation It is a common stereotype that gay men are sexual predators or pedophiles. The former perception can lead to a knee-jerk reaction that created the \\"gay panic defense\\", usually in straight men, who fear being hit on by gay men, and can be either a cause or an expression of homophobia. The perception that a greater proportion of gay than straight men are pedophiles or child sexual abusers is one contributing factor of discrimination against gay teachers, despite the stark contrast to statistical figures, which have generally revealed most male child sexual abusers, including those who target boys, are heterosexual and usually married with children of their own, and research on child sexual abuse shows that most instances of child sexual abuse (one cited percentage being over 90%) are perpetrated by heterosexual males raping underage females. Research has consistently indicated that a significant minority of child sex abuse perpetrators are female (5‚Äì20%), but other research has indicated that almost 40% of child sexual abuse against boys, and 6% of abuse against girls, is committed by women.Dube, Shata R., et al. \\"Long-Term Consequences of Childhood Sexual Abuse by Gender of Victim\\" Am J Prev Med 2005 Bisexual people Bisexuality is romantic or sexual attraction to males and females, or romantic or sexual attraction to people of all gender identities or to a person irrespective of that person's biological sex or gender, though numerous related terms, such as pansexual and polysexual, are also equated with this description and there exists debate with regard to the terms' interchangeability. People who have a distinct but not exclusive preference for one sex over the other may also identify themselves as bisexual. Bisexuality has been observed in various human societies and elsewhere in the animal kingdom throughout recorded history. The term bisexuality, like the terms heterosexuality and homosexuality, was coined in the 19th century.  Indecision  alt= Many bisexual people are often characterized as indecisive due to their attraction to both men and women. As the term bisexual can refer to people who do have a sexual preference but are open to sexual interactions with other groups, bisexuals are sometimes seen as unwilling to commit to one sexual identity. This characterization can include stereotypes originating in the LGBT community itself a people who are bisexual do not always choose homosexual partners- they are often seen as being in a transitory or experimental phase between being heterosexual and homosexual.  Promiscuity  Another common stereotype is that bisexual people are promiscuous and incapable of having steady or long-term relationships. This includes belief that, according to a bisexuality study, ‚Äúcompared to lesbians or gay targets, bisexual targets in a relationship with lesbian or gay partners were evaluated as more likely to transmit STDs and less likely to sexually satisfy their partners.‚Äù by the public. Bisexual people are sometimes seen as being incapable of monogamy or sexually manipulative.  Media representation  Due to negative characterizations of bisexuality, media personalities are often reluctant to share their identity with the public, leading to reduced visibility. Rock musician David Bowie famously declared himself bisexual in an interview with Melody Maker in January 1972, a move coinciding with the first shots in his campaign for stardom as Ziggy Stardust.Carr, Roy; Murray, Charles Shaar (1981). Bowie: An Illustrated Record. New York: Avon. . Bowie later regretted revealing his sexuality, stating, \\"I had no problem with people knowing I was bisexual. But I had no inclination to hold any banners or be a representative of any group of people. I knew what I wanted to be, which was a songwriter and a performer ... \\" Regarding the portrayal of bisexual people by Hollywood, stigma is present, especially for men. From the end of the McCarthy era to even today, \\"The history of male bisexual characters in film has been one of negative stereotyping.\\" With so many negative stereotypes surrounding bisexual characters, they are often relegated to supporting or one-note characters. Transgender people Transgender is an umbrella term that encompasses a wide range of people with more specific identities. In general, a person who is transgender identifies with a gender other than their gender assigned at birth. The term may apply to any number of distinct communities, such as cross-dressers, drag queens, and drag kings, in addition to transsexuals. The beliefs that transgender people are all prostitutes and caricatures of men and women are two of many erroneous misconceptions. One common stereotype of trans women is that they are assumed to be drag queens. While historically some trans women have been innovators within the drag scene alongside gay men, trans women are not drag queens. Transsexualism A transsexual is a person born with the physical characteristics of one sex who psychologically and emotionally identifies with a variant or different gender than their physical sex characteristics. Stereotypes of trans women include them always being taller and having larger hands than cisgender women. Trans men, conversely, are often stereotyped as being cuter, more feminine, and more passive than their cisgender counterparts, being classified as \\"softboys\\" (or \\"softbois\\" or ‚Äúsoftybois‚Äù). Both transgender men and women are often conflated with being gay, with trans men being mistaken for lesbians and trans women being mistaken for gay men, respectively. Transvestites and cross- dressers Transvestites are often assumed to be homosexuals. The word transvestism comes from the combination of Latin words trans meaning \\"across, over\\" and vestitus meaning dressed.Hirschfeld, Magnus: Die Transvestiten. Eine Untersuchung √ºber den erotischen Verkleidungstrieb mit umfangreichem casuistischen und historischen Material. Berlin 1910: Alfred Pulvermacher Hirschfeld, M. (1910/1991). Transvestites: The erotic drive to cross dress.(M. A. Lombardi-Nash, Trans.) Buffalo, NY: Prometheus Books. Most transvestites are heterosexual. Although many people use the words interchangeably, transvestite has increasingly become a derogatory term. Most prefer to use the term cross-dresser or cross-dressing. Origins and prevalence=Research Social scientists are attempting to understand why there are such negative connotations associated with the lesbian community.Brown, Michael J. \\"Homophobia and Acceptance of Stereotypes About Gays and Lesbians.\\" 7.3 (2009): 159,160-167. Print. William James assumed that it was a repulsive instinct that came naturally to each woman and that, when an individual enjoyed same-sex interaction, it was because it became a habit. In short, he assumed that \\"tolerance is learned and revulsion is inborn\\" (PBS). In 1908, James and Edward Westermack attempted to understand the violent actions taken toward homosexuals by Jewish, Christian, and Zoroastrian religions. They believed hostility existed because of the historical association between homosexuality and idolatry, heresy, and criminal behavior. Sigmund Freud asserted in 1905 that homophobia was shaped by society, an individual's environment, and the individual's exposure to homo-eroticism. Sandor Ference (1914) believed that heterosexual women's feelings of repulsion toward those identifying as lesbians was a reaction formation and defense mechanism against affection from the same sex. In other words, he believed heterosexual females feared being labeled as lesbians. Taking an individual that adheres to stereotypes of LGBT people and putting them in face-to-face interaction with those of the LGBT community tends to lessen tendencies to rely upon stereotypes and increases the presence of individuals with a similar ethnic, religious, or geographical background, and who are accepting of homosexuals.Herek, Gregory. \\"Hating Gays: An Overview of Scientific Studies.\\" PBS. PBS. Web. 18 Oct. 2014. Intersections between LGBT, race, and class stereotypes According to the theory of intersectionality, discrimination leveled against an individual can compound based on several factors including race, class, gender, and sexuality. As members of the LGBT community can be members of other minority groups and stand at all ends of the socioeconomic spectrum, intersectional stereotypes are often perpetuated, including those related to class and race. As people of color and those of lower socioeconomic status are more likely to go to prison, LGBT members of these groups are often misrepresented as being criminally inclined. LGBT individuals often face discrimination in prisons as they are typically gender-segregated and are stereotyped as being sexually available to other prisoners. This makes them vulnerable to assault and discrimination both behind bars and in the outside world Shows like Orange is the New Black and other forms of media perpetuate stereotypes of LGBT expression within prisons. = African Americans = African Americans represent a particularly marginalized segment of the LGBT community which faces both race and sexuality based prejudice. African American gay men are often characterized as being dominant in relationships both sexually and emotionally. This bias stems from a history of racism and characterization of African American men as brutish in addition to stereotypes which categorize homosexual men as either ‚Äútop‚Äù or ‚Äúbottom‚Äù. These stereotypes can be observed in many forms of media, including pornography which depicts gay African American men as aggressive. African American members of the LGBT community also face discrimination and stereotypes from other African Americans who are historically likely to be religious and stereotype homosexuals as having loose morals. Religious stereotypes surrounding the LGBT community are especially prevalent in certain Black evangelical churches where gay and transsexual members are thought to be \\"damned to hell\\". =Hispanics= Hispanics generally have a difficult time within the culture of the Hispanic American countries, yet not in Spain, this is due to these cultures being more traditionalist (Except for Argentina, Uruguay, and Chile). There have been some shifts away from these stereotypes in recent years, but it has been to different extents depending on the culture. The strong belief in \\"machismo\\" has caused these shifts in attitude to be so small. Machismo refers to the male dominant role in society that provides more social authority to men that are not experienced by women. Female homosexuality is less explicitly accepted in many of these cultures, while in certain countries and in certain social status it is accepted, they do not enjoy the acceptance similar to that of other Western countries.Forsloff, Carol. \\"Gay Hispanics Struggle to End Sex Stereotypes.\\" Gay Hispanic Struggle to End Sex Stereotypes. Digital Journal, 19 Jan. 2010. Web. 21 Oct. 2014. Many Hispanics stray away from coming out because of religion. The LGBTQ Hispanic community of faith helps people understand that they can be gay and also be religious without judgement. =Asians= Asian American women that identify as lesbian or bisexual may face sexual fetishization by white men or women and are stereotyped as \\"spicy\\", leading to frustrations about Asian lesbians feeling they are not taken seriously by society, stereotypes about Asian women as \\"freaky\\", and yellow fever. Gay and bisexual Asian men are stereotyped as \\"effeminate, submissive, and docile\\". As both ethnocentric and heterocentric minority groups, LGBT Asian Americans face intersectional invisibility, which offers them some protection from stereotyping and active prejudice while also making it difficult for them to establish recognition or be recognized. Asian Americans are typically overlooked in discussion of race, which focuses mostly on a white/black dichotomy and renders Asian Americans invisible. Similarly, gay and lesbian Asian Americans are marginalized within mostly-white LGBT communities at large. Gay Asian American men in media are portrayed as both hypersexual (as gay men) and asexual (as Asian men). Stereotypes of Asian women as either a Dragon Lady or China doll are dominant in mainstream media representation of Asian women, and butch Asian women are relatively invisible, giving way to more femme, or feminized, depictions. GLAAD is working to have a fair depiction of the Asian community in the media by educating the public on language referring to Asian Americans, including refraining from phrases that are Eurocentric like \\"The Orient\\", \\"Far East\\", and \\"Asiatic\\", among other measures. GLAAD is also working to connect media networks with Asian and Pacific Islander LGBT leaders and organizations in order to create less biased media coverage. In Japan, adult lesbians (better known as \\"'bians\\") are frequently portrayed as smokers in Japanese Media. Japanese culture also heavily fetishizes LGBTQ relationships, often seen in the prevalence of yaoi (male homosexuality) and yuri (female homosexuality/lesbianism). While Japanese culture heavily discourages interest in homosexual fiction matching the reader's sex, certain publications, such as manga magazine Yuri Hime, have repeatedly reported their dominant consumers as the same gender as portrayed for most of their operational life.

Its name derives from the molecule tropine from which cycloheptatriene (tropylidene) was first synthesized in 1881. Salts of the tropylium cation can be stable, even with nucleophiles of moderate strength e.g., tropylium tetrafluoroborate and tropylium bromide (see below). Its bromide and chloride saltsA mixture of [C7H7]+Cl‚àí and [C7H7]+[PCl6‚àí] is produced by treatment of tropylidene with phosphorus pentachloride. can be made from cycloheptatriene and bromine or phosphorus pentachloride, respectively.Tropylium fluoborate Organic Syntheses, Coll. Vol. 5, p.1138 (1973); Vol. 43, p.101 (1963). link It is a regular heptagonal, planar, cyclic ion; as well, it has 6 œÄ-electrons (4n + 2, where n = 1), which fulfills H√ºckel's rule of aromaticity. It can coordinate as a ligand to metal atoms. The structure shown is a composite of seven resonance contributors in which each carbon atom carries part of the positive charge. In 1891 G. Merling obtained a water-soluble bromine containing compound from a reaction of cycloheptatriene and bromine. Unlike most hydrocarbyl bromides, this compound, later named tropylium bromide, is a water-soluble solid and is insoluble in hydrocarbons, chloroform, and ether. It is purified by crystallization from hot ethanol. Reaction with aqueous silver nitrate immediately gave a precipitate of silver bromide. The structure of tropylium bromide was deduced to be a salt, Br‚Äì, by Doering and Knox in 1954 by analysis of its infrared and ultraviolet spectra. The ionic structures of tropylium perchlorate () and tropylium iodide (I‚Äì) in the solid state have been confirmed by X-ray crystallography. The bond length of the carbon-carbon bonds were found to be longer (147 pm) than those of benzene (140 pm) but still shorter than those of a typical single-bonded species like ethane (154 pm). The tropylium ion is an acid in aqueous solution (i.e., an Arrhenius acid) as a consequence of its Lewis acidity: it first acts as a Lewis acid to form an adduct with water, which can then donate a proton to another molecule of water: : + 2 \\\\+ (Boric acid gives acidic aqueous solutions in much the same way.) The equilibrium constant is , making it about as acidic in water as acetic acid. Mass spectrometry The tropylium ion is frequently encountered in mass spectrometry in the form of a signal at m/z = 91 and is used in mass spectrum analysis. This fragment is often found for aromatic compounds containing a benzyl unit. Upon ionization, the benzyl fragment forms a cation (), which rearranges to the highly stable tropylium cation (). Reactions The tropylium cation reacts with nucleophiles to form substituted cycloheptatrienes, for example: : + ‚Üí Reduction by lithium aluminum hydride yields cycloheptatriene. Reaction with a cyclopentadienide salt of sodium or lithium yields 7-cyclopentadienylcyclohepta-1,3,5-triene: : + ‚Üí + When treated with oxidising agents such as chromic acid, the tropylium cation undergoes rearrangement into benzaldehyde: : + ‚Üí + + Many metal complexes of tropylium ion are known.

Scrollwork is a term for some forms of decoration dominated by spiralling scrolls, today used in popular language for two-dimensional decorative flourishes and arabesques of all kinds, especially those with circular or spiralling shapes. Scroll decoration has been used for the decoration of a vast range of objects, in all Eurasian cultures, and most beyond. A lengthy evolution over the last two millennia has taken forms of plant-based scroll decoration from Greco-Roman architecture to Chinese pottery, and then back across Eurasia to Europe. They are very widespread in architectural decoration, woodcarving, painted ceramics, mosaic, and illuminated manuscripts (mostly for borders). In the usual artistic convention, scrolls \\"apparently do not succumb to gravitational forces, as garlands and festoons do, or oppose them, in the manner of vertically growing trees. This gives scrolls a relentless power. Even if attached to walls, they are more deeply embedded in the architectural order, which are fictitiously hanging on them.\\"Necipoƒülu, G√ºlru, Payne, Alina, Histories of Ornament: From Global to Local, 92, 2016, Princeton University Press, , 978069116728, google books Terminology Typically in true scrolls the main \\"stem\\" lines do not cross over each other, or not significantly. When crossing stems become a dominant feature in the design, terms such as interlace or arabesque are used instead. Many scrolls run along a relatively narrow band, such as a frieze panel or the border of a carpet or piece of textile or ceramics, and so are often called \\"running scrolls\\",Fyfe, Theodore, Hellenistic Architecture: An Introductory Study, 1965, CUP, pp. 102-103 while others spread to cover wide areas, and are often infinitely expandible. Similar motifs made up of straight lines and right angles, such as the \\"Greek key\\", are more often called meanders. In art history, a \\"floriated\\" or \\"flower scroll\\" has flowers, often in the centre of the volutes, and a \\"foliated\\" or \\"leaf scroll\\" shows leaves in varying degrees of profusion along the stems. The Ara Pacis scrolls are foliated and sparingly floriated, whilst those in the Dome of the Rock mosaics are profusely foliated with thick leaves forming segments of the stems. As in arabesques, the \\"leaf\\" forms often spring directly from the stem without a leaf stalk in ways that few if any real plants do; these are generally derived from the ancient half-palmette motif, with the stem running along the bisected edge of the palmette.Rawson, 35-36 Although forms are often based on real plants, especially the acanthus, vine, lotus and paeony,Rawson, Chapters 1 and 2, cover these in turn faithful representation is rarely the point of the design, as of these four only the vine is actually the sort of climbing plant with many stems and tendrils that scrolls generally represent.Rawson, 28-30 Later Islamic and Chinese scroll decoration often included more flowers than European designs, whether classical or medieval (see below). Scroll-forms containing animals or human figures are said to be \\"inhabited\\"; more often than not the figures are wildly out of scale with the plant forms.Chapter Six: \\"The 'Inhabited Scrolls' Mosaic Pavements - A Sixth Century Trend\\", in Hachlili, Rachel, Ancient Mosaic Pavements: Themes, Issues, and Trends : Selected Studies, 2009, BRILL, , 9789004167544 Frequently, especially in spreading designs, an upright element imitating the main stem or flower-stalk of the plant appears as a central element protruding vertically from the base, again as in the Ara Pacis panel. This may be termed a \\"standard\\" but is not a necessary element; it gives the design a top and bottom, which may be appropriate for architecture or furniture, but many designs on textiles and pottery are intended to have no main orientation for the viewer. The standard was frequently depicted as a fanciful candelabra in grotesque designs, in which it is an important element, central to the composition. Scrollwork in its strict meaning is rather different; the scroll is imagined as the curling end of a strip or sheet of some flat and wide material. It develops from strapwork, as the ends of otherwise flat elements, loosely imitating leather, metal sheets, or broad leaves rather than plant tendrils. Rather than the \\"profile\\" view displaying the spiral, the forms are often shown front on with the width of the strip seen. It begins in the Renaissance, and becomes increasingly popular in Mannerist and Baroque ornament. History Continuous scroll decoration has a very long history, and such patterns were an essential element of classical and medieval decoration. The use of scrolls in ornament goes back to at least the Bronze Age; geometric scroll ornament has been found in the Palace of Knossos at Minoan Crete dating to approximately 1800 BC,C. Michael Hogan, Knossos fieldnotes, Modern Antiquarian (20013) perhaps drawing from even earlier Egyptian styles; there were also early examples in Mesopotamia.Rawson, 203-208 Geometrical scroll patterns like the Vitruvian scroll are found very widely in many cultures, and probably often developed independently. Plant-based scrolls were very widely used in Greek and Roman architectural decoration, spreading from them to other types of objects.Rawson, Chapter 1 They may have first evolved in Greek painted pottery, where their development can traced in the large surviving corpus.Rawson, 212-222 In Europe Greco-Roman decoration, probably especially as seen in jewellery and floor mosaics, was adapted by the \\"barbarian\\" peoples of the Migration Period into interlace styles, often replacing the plant forms of the main scrolling stem with stretched and stylized animal forms. In Anglo- Saxon art the interlace designs of the early pagan Anglo-Saxons were partly replaced by vine scrolls after Christianization, and medieval European decoration in general evolved styles that combined the two. Another expansion was to the East: \\"The practice of decorating facades in Chinese Buddhist caves with figures combined with leaf scrolls was derived in its entirety from provincial forms of Hellenistic architecture employed in Central Asia\\"; they appear in China from the 5th century.Rawson, 23 (quoted), and Chapter 1 The (Nelumbo nucifera) lotus flower was a symbol of Buddhism, and so very often included in these religious scroll designs from the 6th century on,Rawson, chapter 2 which was to have a profound influence on Asian scroll designs, long after the religious significance had been largely or entirely forgotten, and in places where the actual lotus water plant was unknown.Rawson, 31-32 It was several centuries before these designs were adapted by Chinese potters, via their earlier adoption in metalwork;Rawson, 26, 65 indeed an isolated gilt- bronze cup with a vine scroll comes from the 5th-century Northern Wei, probably influenced by metalwork from the West,Rawson, 39-40 and more abstracted or geometrical scroll designs appear earlier in Chinese art. The paeony seems to have become very fashionable in China during the T'ang dynasty, and often replaced the lotus flower.Rawson, 64-65, Chapter 2 By the Yuan dynasty plant scroll designs became very important in painted pottery. In the Islamic world the external influences were initially mainly from their Byzantine and Sasanian predecessors, but later, especially after the Mongol conquests, from Chinese designs, especially in pottery, which themselves had developed from the original Buddhist importation to China.Rawson, 27, and throughout Greco-Buddhist art, and direct luxury imports, brought scroll forms to India, for example to the great 1st century stupa at Amaravati in southern India,Rawson, 47-56 from where they spread to South-East Asia, with additional input from China. There they often became very abstracted in pottery. Japan was heavily influenced by China. From the late medieval period onwards Chinese and Indian scrolling styles, and their Islamic cousins, were imported to Europe on pottery and textiles, reaching a peak of influence in the 18th- century. In the Renaissance Europe had also revived interest in versions of its own classical styles that more strictly followed their originals. Common types In one common spreading type for wide areas, the basic form of the arabesque is a heart shape formed from two confronted volutes on stems, shown highlighted in green in the illustration. To this core are added any number of further volutes, above, below or to the sides. It is thus a motif which can be infinitely expanded to cover a surface of any size, and indeed this function of decorating plain surfaces, as a form of diaper, is its chief use. From the illustration it is clear that the form present on the Ara Pacis (drawing E) erected in Imperial Rome during the time of Augustus, that is to say during the 1st quarter of the 1st century AD, is unchanged in substance when compared with the form in the apse mosaic of San Clemente in Rome dated c. 1200 (drawing C). The basic form appears unaltered during the intervening centuries, and indeed continued in use through the Renaissance and to the present day. In other types the heart-shaped core is omitted, the scroll taking the form of an \\"S\\" with voluted ends, generally seen in confronted pairs, as in the mosaics of the Treasury of the Great Mosque of Damascus, Byzantine work of the 7th century. This form is also encountered at the Treasury in Damascus, having a pair of volutes turned inwards towards the bowl. The form is generally used alone and does not sprout further volutes as generally does the core heart-shaped form. Applications Scrollwork (in the popular definition) is most commonly associated with Baroque architecture, though it saw uses in almost every decorative application, including furniture, metalwork, porcelain and engraving. In Mannerism, strapwork forms often terminated in scrolls. Modern blacksmiths use scrolls in ornamental wrought-iron work gates and balustrades, and they have Applications of single scroll forms can be seen in the volutes at the head of an Ionic column, the carved scroll at the end of the pegbox on instruments in the violin family (resembling fiddleheads in nature), and the heads of many Western crosiers.

The town is located northeast of Marysville, off Highway 49 between Downieville and Nevada City. It is located on a ridge between the North Fork and Middle Fork of the Yuba River, not far from New Bullards Bar Dam Reservoir. Camptonville lies at an elevation of 2825 feet (861 m).

A graduate of the University of Virginia, where he earned a master's degree in Folklore, Clayton specialized in traditional music, primarily New England sea shanties and ballads as well as Appalachian songs. He became interested in the first of these as a youngster and began playing guitar as a teen. While attending college, he expanded his interests to include the music of Virginia and the surrounding states. Within a short time after leaving college, he began recording. His first releases were for a small specialty record company, but in 1956 he joined Folkways Records, the day's leading folk music label. He recorded six solo albums for Folkways from 1956 to 1958, issued albums for a few specialty labels, moved to another prominent folk label, Elektra Records, for two albums in 1958‚Äì59, and collaborated with artists such as Jean Ritchie and Dave Van Ronk on other releases. He made his last recording in 1965. As much a scholar as a musician, Clayton began collecting songs at a young age in his hometown of New Bedford, Massachusetts. At the university, he studied under a professor who was a leading folklorist. Soon he was combing the hills and valleys of Virginia and surrounding states for songs that formed the region's musical heritage. In making field recordings, he \\"discovered\\" Etta Baker and Hobart Smith, homespun musicians who have come to be regarded as all-time greats. Clayton became a prominent figure in the Greenwich Village folk scene in New York City during the early 1960s. He was close with artists such as Dave Van Ronk and Liam Clancy and was also a mentor and friend of Bob Dylan during the first years of Dylan's career. A song Clayton wrote was allegedly \\"borrowed\\" by Dylan in 1962 as the basis for one of his most famous tunes, \\"Don't Think Twice, It's All Right\\". The resulting lawsuits by their record companies were settled out of court, and the two remained friends for several years afterwards. Clayton was beset with personal problems in his mid-30s, including frustrations with his career, doubts arising from his homosexuality, manic depression, drug abuse, and a related arrest. He committed suicide in 1967. Early years Clayton was born Paul Clayton Worthington in New Bedford, Massachusetts, in 1931, during the early years of the Great Depression. His parents, Clayton Worthington and Adah (Hardy), were married four years before, and Paul was to be their only child. Despite the hard economic times, his father was comfortably employed as a salesman with a national company, where he eventually would become an executive. The Worthingtons lived with Adah's parents in the West End of New Bedford, a prosperous New England seaport. Paul's parents, however, were both highly charged, Adah especially, and they fought whenever her husband returned home after days on the road. Less than four years following Paul's birth, they divorced. Clayton and his mother continued to live with her parents, Charles and Elizabeth Hardy, and his introduction to music came early. His parents both played musical instruments, though casually, his father the banjo and his mother the piano. His grandparents would be an even greater influence. Charles Hardy sang songs he had picked up from seafarers and landlubbers alike, while Elizabeth contributed songs she grew up with in Canada's Prince Edward Island. By his teen years, in the mid-1940s, Paul had learned to play guitar, performing traditional songs he learned from his grandparents as well as from folk music programs on the radio. He also hunted down standards from collections available at school and in his explorations, chanced upon a trove of original manuscripts of seafaring songs on a visit one day to the New Bedford Whaling Museum. Intrigued by the possibilities of using radio to bring traditional music to larger audiences, Clayton landed a weekly series of 15-minute folk programs on New Bedford's WFMR and later on WBSM. Besides writing and announcing his own material, he performed live, singing the traditional songs he had been collecting to his own guitar accompaniment. He was successful enough that the program was expanded to an hour per week. He was still only in high school. Folklorist After graduating in 1949, Clayton attended the University of Virginia, where hoped to gain a better grounding in musical scholarship. One of his professors was Arthur Kyle Davis, Jr., an eminent folklorist. Davis took three students under his wing, including Clayton, encouraging them to transcribe songs, write commentary, and tape the university's collection of deteriorating aluminum recordings. In 1950, Clayton's unusual musical background caught the attention of Helen Hartness Flanders, the wife of U.S. Senator Ralph E. Flanders of Vermont and an internationally recognized folk music authority. Flanders showed up at Clayton's house one day with a tape recorder while he was home from college, and she recorded 11 of his songs. The roles had reversed. Now Clayton was the one being collected. That same year he discovered a new instrument, the Appalachian dulcimer. Seeking out traditional players in North Carolina, Kentucky, and Virginia, he learned a variety of styles, becoming more proficient on dulcimer than he was on guitar. Through the knowledge he had gathered on the instrument, he collaborated on a booklet, The Appalachian Dulcimer, writing authoritatively on the subject. Meanwhile, he scoured the countryside for traditional players and songs. To help finance his field trips, he performed at colleges, schools, bars, and coffeehouses along the way. Around this time, Paul began using his father's name as his stage name. Another side of Clayton's personality emerged during college. The university had an almost entirely male student body, and a gay subculture had existed there for many years. Because of the times and the university's conservative traditions, it all remained closeted. Free of his home ties, however, Clayton had an active if private romantic life and sought liaisons whenever and wherever he could. Clayton continued to assist in editing Davis's book More Traditional Ballads of Virginia (published 1960). He reported his research in a quarterly journal, Southern Folklore, and for a time planned a book of his own, also on traditional Virginian songs, though the work never materialized. Recordings In 1952, Clayton recorded a tape of bluegrass material with a friend, musician Bill Clifton, and sent it off to Stinson Records in New York with the hopes of interesting the label in issuing an album. Stinson declined, but considered four tracks for singles. However, the sides went unissued.The tape was issued as an album by Bear Family Records in 1975 as Bill Clifton & Paul Clayton: The First Recordings, A Bluegrass Session, 1952 (Wirz). After college, Stinson put out Clayton's first album, Whaling Songs & Ballads, which was released in cooperation with the New Bedford Whaling Museum. Another Stinson release, Waters of Tyne, followed, and over the next few years he recorded for a series of other relatively obscure labels, releasing Whaling and Sailing Songs on Tradition Records and Wanted for Murder: Songs of Outlaws and Desperados and Bloody Ballads: British and American Murder Ballads on Riverside Records, among others. Through his tireless efforts at promotion, Clayton developed many useful connections, one of which brought him to the attention of a small but highly significant record company, Folkways Records. Folkways, led by Moe Asch, later recognized as the father of World Music, specialized in traditional material of a wide range, from Inuit and Patagonian songs to ballads sung by Serbo-Croats and Bulgarians. The venue was perfect for the traditional music Clayton specialized in. Refocusing his attentions on the basics, he issued a series of albums for Folkways that brought together his grandfather's ballads and shanties with the rarities uncovered through his scholarly pursuits in Virginia. Four Clayton albums were released by Folkways in 1956 alone: his first, Bay State Ballads, followed by Folk Songs and Ballads of Virginia, Cumberland Mountain Folksongs, and The Folkways-Viking Record of Folk Ballads of the English Speaking World. The next year, Folkways put out two more Clayton releases, American Broadside Ballads in Popular Tradition and Dulcimer Songs and Solos. In a span of just three years, he had recorded twelve albums. In 1958, Clayton switched labels again, moving over to Elektra, an eclectic label that also specialized in folk music. He recorded Unholy Matrimony that year with Bob Yellin backing him on banjo and the next year released Bobby Burns' Merry Muses of Caledonia. His work was also featured in 1959 on the Folkways album Foc'sle Songs and Shanties with the Foc'sle Singers, whose members included Dave Van Ronk, Roger Abrahams, and Bob Brill. His stay at Elektra was short, and following his second release with the label, he joined Monument Records, a smaller outfit, where he issued an EP, a series of singles and his final album, Paul Clayton, Folk Singer!, in 1965. Clayton recorded the first nationally charted version of Woody Guthrie's \\"This Land Is Your Land\\". The record (Monument 416) entered the Music Vendor pop chart 4/5/60, reaching No. 79 in a 4-week chart stay. Other significant recordings by Clayton included a collaboration with Diane Hamilton and Liam Clancy entitled Instrumental Music of the Southern Appalachians, which featured field recordings of Etta Baker, Hobart Smith, and other indigenous artists, and an album with Jean Ritchie, American Folk Tales & Songs, both for Tradition. He also recorded for the Library of Congress, and tapes he made of Rev. Gary Davis and Pink Anderson were used for the album American Street Songs on Riverside Records. Alleged plagiarism by Bob Dylan Bob Dylan's friendship with Clayton dated back to 1961, Dylan's first year in New York City. Dylan traveled cross-country with Clayton and two other friends in 1963, during which they visited poet Carl Sandburg in North Carolina, attended Mardi Gras in New Orleans and rendezvoused with Joan Baez in California. In an interview published as part of a history of Greenwich Village folk club Gerde's Folk City, folk singer Barry Kornfeld described how Clayton's \\"Who's Gonna Buy You Ribbons (When I'm Gone)\\" morphed into Dylan's \\"Don't Think Twice\\": Dylan's and Clayton's publishing companies sued each other over the alleged plagiarism. As it turned out, Clayton's song was derived from an earlier folk song entitled \\"Who's Gonna Buy You Chickens When I'm Gone?\\", which was in the public domain. The lawsuits, which were settled out of court, had no effect on the friendship between the two songwriters. In the notes to Biograph (1985), Dylan acknowledges that \\"'Don't Think Twice' was a riff that Paul [Clayton] had.\\" He also credits Clayton for the melody line to \\"Percy's Song\\".Bob Dylan, quoted in the note on \\"Percy's Song\\" from the liner notes to Biograph, Columbia Records, 1985. In 1970, Dylan covered Clayton's song \\"Gotta Travel On\\" as the 14th track of his album Self Portrait. Suicide On March 30, 1967, he committed suicide by taking an electric heater into his bathtub. He is buried at Oak Grove Cemetery, New Bedford, Massachusetts. Discography=Albums * 1954?

In 1932 he joined the youth wing of the Marxist Bloque Obrero y Campesino (BOC ‚Äì Workers' and Peasants' Bloc) ‚Äîa major workers' organization, at the time under the influence of the Soviet Union's Right Opposition, that would later fuse into the POUM‚Äî and began organizing the Association of Revolutionary Students of Barcelona. Solano became a member of the Executive Committee of the BOC Youth and initiated his journalistic career as a contributor to Adelante (\\"Forward\\"), a journal headed by Joaqu√≠n Maur√≠n ‚Äîa renowned Spanish communist who would go on to found the POUM with Andreu Nin. Civil War Solano became secretary general of the JCI (Iberian Communist Youth) in September 1935, after having joined the POUM and spent time in Valencia as a delegate of the POUM's Executive Committee, where he helped found the weekly El Comunista (The Communist). After the eruption of the Spanish Civil War in 1936 Solano represented the JCI in the Executive Committee of the POUM and headed the weekly Juventud Comunista (Communist Youth). In November 1936 he was elected secretary general of the International Bureau of Revolutionary Socialist Youth. Solano managed to escape from the clashes between the Unified Socialist Party of Catalonia and POUM on June 16, 1937. He helped found the second Executive Committee of the POUM with other fugitive poumistas. In harshly repressive conditions, this committee organized a resistance to the persecution of the POUM and an international campaign supporting Nin and other jailed leaders. During this period he edited the underground journal, Juventud Obrera (Working Youth). In April 1938 he was detained along with other POUM leaders and placed in Barcelona State Prison by Communist-directed government authorities. He was to be included in the second trial of the POUM, which never occurred thanks to the fall of Barcelona to Nationalist forces. In February 1939, Solano entered France. Exile Solano spent several months living in Paris and Chartres, and along with other poumistas attempted to reconstitute the Party, with an exile wing and one active inside Spain, and also maintain links with other organizations. In 1941, after Nazi Germany conquered and occupied France, Solano was detained in Montauban and condemned to twenty years of forced labor by a Vichy regime tribunal. He was freed on July 19, 1944 by the Maquis. He joined the French Resistance and, along with POUM and Confederaci√≥n Nacional del Trabajo and militants founded a Spanish guerrilla unit, the Liberty Battalion. In 1945 he left the Battalion to rededicate himself to organizing the POUM and reestablishing its newspaper, La Batalla (\\"The Battle\\"). In 1947, after a clandestine voyage to Madrid and Catalonia, Solano was elected secretary general of the POUM at the party's general conference in Toulouse, attended by representatives of the illegal Spanish organization as well as exile groups from France, North Africa, and Latin America. During his exile, aside from editing La Batalla Solano founded Tribuno Socialista (\\"Socialist Tribune\\"), a magazine that secured a notable following in Spain in an epoch when the resistance to Francoist Spain reached hopeful peaks. Moreover, Solano participated in numerous international activities and, in particular, in the creation of the Movement for the United States of Europe, one of the first postwar Pan-European organizations, and that of the Pro-socialist People's Congress, which brought together many of the African and Asian national liberation movements. Professionally, Solano worked for Agence France Presse between 1953 and 1981. In 1975-76, when the POUM found itself in the midst of a crisis, he stood in opposition to the dissolution of the Party and its entrance into the camp of Social Democracy (the Spanish Socialist Workers' Party). He pushed for Tribuno Socialista to become the POUM's magazine, and expressed his support for the regroupment of revolutionary Marxist organizations. Later years In the 1980s, he was one of the founders of the Fundaci√≥ Andreu Nin, which focused on the total rectification of the prestige of that communist politician and the clarification of the mystery of his death at the hands of the NKVD, and at the same time the defense of revolutionary Marxism and dialogue with all the tendencies of the socialist labor movement. Solano is the author of a biography of Nin, a history of the JCI, and numerous essays on the POUM, the exile of Spanish revolutionaries in France, and the problems posed by the fall of the USSR and the collapse of Stalinism. He was a major advisor to and collaborator on films such as Ken Loach's Land and Freedom and the documentary Operaci√≥n Nikolai. 1999 saw the release of Solano's book-length study of the POUM and Nin's role in the Spanish revolution, El POUM in la Historia. Andreu Nin y la revoluci√≥n espa√±ola. It was published jointly by Libros de la Catarata and the Fundaci√≥ Andreu Nin, and is a personal and observed discussion of the poorly understood time period and political movement ‚Äì some have called it one of the two most important works about the POUM, the other being Andrew Durgan's study of the Bloque Obrero y Campesino, BOC 1930-1936. As yet neither work is available in English. His personal archive is located in the Pavell√≥ de la Rep√∫blica CRAI Library - University of Barcelona .

Named from the Greek for \\"gold\\", it uses colloidal gold to record images on paper. Herschel's system involved coating paper with ferric citrate, exposing it to the sun in contact with an etching used as mask, then developing the print with a chloroaurate solution. This did not provide continuous-tone photographs. In 2006, 164 years after Herschel's work with gold printing, photographers Liam Lawless and Robert Wolfgang Schramm published a formula based on Herschel's process. Following the introduction of Richard Sullivan's ziatype process in 1997, which uses ammonium ferric oxalate to print out palladium images, many photographers began experimenting successfully with substituting gold for some or all of the palladium. Image quality decays rapidly as the printer approaches 100% gold in a ziatype print. The modern chemist and photographic historian Mike Ware published the first books covering the subject of chrysotype in 2006, 'The Chrysotype Manual: the science and practice of photographic printing in gold' and 'Gold in Photography: the history and art of chrysotype'. Richard Puckett, an American photographer, announced in the March/April 2012 issue of View Camera magazine a chrysotype process that uses vitamin C with ammonium ferric oxalate to print out on dry paper, with no hydration, fine-grained, continuous tone gold images. Puckett presented the process at the 2013 APIS (Alternative Photography International Symposium) in Santa Fe, New Mexico. Originally the process was named the Texas Chrystoype; following a major revision of the formula in 2017, Puckett renamed the process the Chrysotype Supreme.

Investigations are conducted by Military Police Investigators or the United States Army Criminal Investigation Command (USACIDC), both of which report to the Provost Marshal General. United States Army Military Police units have combat zone responsibilities in addition to their law enforcement duties. These responsibilities include mounted and dismounted patrols, response force operations, area damage control, route reconnaissance, cordon and search operations, critical site security, and convoy and personnel escorts. Operationally, these duties fall under the \\"security and mobility support\\" discipline of the Military Police Corps. Since the beginning of the Global War on Terror, military police have become a valuable asset to combat operations due to the versatility of the MOS.  Mission  The United States Army's Military Police provide an important function in the full spectrum of Army operations as a member of the Maneuver, Fires, and Effects division. The Military Police Corps provides expertise in policing, detainment, and stability operations in order to enhance security and enable mobility. Military Police are actively utilized in direct combat and during peacetime. ;Disciplines The Military Police tasks can be separated into three disciplines and one integrated function: # Security and mobility support operations # Police operations # Detention operations # Police intelligence operations (integrated function across all disciplines) ;Career The Military Police Corps has six career paths within the Army, one for commissioned officers, one for warrant officers, and four for enlisted soldiers: Currently 31 series, formerly the 95 series, and before that, 1677. * 31A - Military Police Officer * 311A - Criminal Investigations Warrant Officer; * 31B (formerly coded as 95B) - Military Police * 31D (formerly coded as 95D) - Criminal Investigations Special Agent * 31E (formerly coded as 95C) - Internment/Resettlement Specialist * 31K - Military Police Working Dog Handler A Criminal Investigations Warrant Officer investigates felony crimes and can be tasked to DoD operations in areas like counter-narcotics and HUMINT. An Internment/Resettlement Specialist works in the confinement and correctional facilities of the United States Military. Work includes maintaining physical security and supervision of facilities, but specialists are also responsible for offering counseling services to those within the facility.  History  The Military Police Corps is one of the youngest branches of the United States Army. It was officially established on 26 September 1941, although it has an irregular history dating back to 1776.  Military Police in the Revolutionary War  The Military Police Corps traces its lineage and history back to the American Revolution. General George Washington requested that the staff position of Provost Marshal be created to deal with disciplinary issues. In January 1776, William Maroney was appointed as the first Provost Marshal of the Continental Army. The Provost Marshals relied on soldiers temporarily drawn from other units, and had difficulty enforcing discipline. On 20 May 1778, Congress established the Provost Corps, which General Washington referred to as the \\"Marechaussee.\\" This name was from the French: \\"mar√©chauss√©e,\\" from the Old French \\"mareschaucie,\\" meaning \\"the marshalcy.\\" Captain Bartholomew von Heer, a German-speaking officer from Pennsylvania, was appointed as the first commander of the Marechaussee on 1 June 1778. Under the new organization, the Provost Marshal was responsible for soldiers under custody and for punishments, while the Marechaussee was tasked with the enforcement of order within the Continental Army. The Marechaussee Corps would be formed exclusively as a police organization, and was organized and equipped as light dragoons, utilizing their speed to aid in troop movements and moving prisoners from the battlefield. The Marechaussee protected the Army's rear and flanks during troop movements, searched for stragglers, guarded river crossings, and engaged in combat when needed, as in the Battle of Springfield. The Provost Corps was disbanded in November 1783.  Civil War  In 1863, the Office of the Provost Marshal General was established and oversaw the Veteran Reserve Corps (VRC). In the US Civil War, the VRC maintained law and order at garrison areas, while other provost guard units served on the front lines. After the war, the Office of the Provost Marshal General was discontinued as the Union Army disbanded.  Spanish‚ÄìAmerican War  During the Moro Rebellion following the Spanish‚ÄìAmerican War, the United States founded the Philippine Constabulary. Training began in 1902, and Brigadier General Harry Hill Bandholtz was appointed as chief of the Constabulary in 1907.  World War I  The complexity of warfare during World War I required a corps of specially-trained soldiers to handle massive numbers of prisoners of war and control the movement of troops and supplies in the zones of operation. The Military Police Training Department was established 9 September 1918 at Caserne Changarnier in Autun, France. Following the war, Brigadier General Harry Hill Bandholtz, who had served as Provost Marshal of the American Expeditionary Forces, proposed the establishment of a permanent Military Police Corps. Although Congress failed to act upon this recommendation, it allowed for the permanent organization of Army military police units in the National Defense Act Amendment of 1920. In 1917, CPL Charles W. Baltimore, a black MP soldier stationed at Camp Logan in Texas, inquired into the beating of a black soldier by Houston police and was himself beaten and arrested afterwards. The racial tension which followed led to the Houston Riot, which killed four soldiers and sixteen civilians, and 60 black soldiers were executed or sentenced to life in prison. The man standing on the left side of this picture, which was taken in post-WWII Germany, is a West German policeman (at a time when West Germany's police force was just officially created), while the other, standing on the right side, is a Lithuanian-German member of the US Army Military Police.  World War II  During World War II, Military Police schools were established at Camp Gordon, Fort Benjamin Harrison, with the Military Police Replacement Center established at Fort Custer. MPs also trained for port security at Fort McHenry. Military Police soldiers moved traffic along the Burma Road, supported amphibious operations on Normandy beachheads, and managed enemy prisoners of war from Italy to the South Pacific. When the Red Ball Express (a supply route stemming from Normandy to the front lines) was established in August 1944, MP performed route reconnaissance and security to keep the trucks and supplies flowing. This was the 793rd Military Police Battalion's (disbanded 2014) first mission in theater and commemorated this in their coat of arms and unit insignia; which consists of a field of green, a yellow road, and two red disks symbolizing the famed route. Thanks to the actions of First lieutenant John Hyde and his detachment of MP, The Corps was heralded for gallantry at Remagen, as a fighting force in numerous combat actions and as peacekeepers at war's end. In 1944, the Army again saw the need for a unit to investigate crime involving soldiers in Europe. The United States Army Criminal Investigation Division was established as a branch of the Provost Marshal General's Office and has continued investigative activity since. After the war ended, cavalry units in Germany were utilized to form the United States Constabulary, a police-like patrol organization. It was disbanded in the 1950s. In 1949, the newly formed Defense Department was in the process of reorganizing the Army and plans were developed to disband the Military Police Corps. But when Congress passed the Army Reorganization Act in May 1950, the Corps survived, remaining a separate branch of the Army. Military police from the 18th Military Police Brigade deploying to Iraq.  Korean War and Vietnam War  When North Korea invaded South Korea in June 1950, there were some MP units stationed in Korea. One of those was the 55th Military Police Company, which had been assigned to Camp Ascom in December 1948. Most of those military police units that arrived during the early months of the war came from Japan, where they were serving as occupation forces following World War II. While the majority of MP companies came from outside Korea, most of the battalions of the Korean War were formed on the peninsula During the Korean War, Military Police kept supply routes open. Subsequently, Military Police monitored the exchange of prisoners and patrolled the demilitarized zone. Military Police, adapting to a different style of warfare in Vietnam, earned status as a combat support arm, partially as a result of combat success during the Tet Offensive.  Current role  During Operation Just Cause, Operation Desert Shield and Storm, the Military Police provided area security, conducted battlefield circulation control, and exercised custody over thousands of prisoners. Since 1991, the Military Police have assisted with interventions in Somalia, Haiti and Bosnia. Military Police maintained order in war-torn Kosovo, as well as keeping the peace in Afghanistan. During the 2003 invasion of Iraq, MPs were used extensively to maintain control over the large numbers of detainees being held by coalition forces, as well as helping to conduct raids, convoy security and regular patrols. MPs were the main force responsible in rebuilding and training the Iraqi Police. Ever since the invasion, military police have been one of the most heavily engaged military occupational specialty in the Iraqi theater. In the United States, MPs often provided disaster relief and internal security, while still fulfilling their fundamental function of maintaining discipline and security within the Army.  Women in the Military Police Corps  BG Colleen L. McGuire Women in the Women's Army Auxiliary Corps were assigned Military Police duties as early as 1941. By 1943, soldiers in the Women's Army Corps were trained as Military Police in order to police female soldiers, although they had jurisdiction over all soldiers, including males. Women have since served in the Military Police Corps, which has given the regiment some distinction. (In the 1953 Film Off Limits, Bob Hope plays a character who joins the Military Police so he can train with women.) Females were officially accepted into the Military Police Corps in 1975. As the Women's Auxiliary Corps was disbanded the Military Police stood up to accept and train women alongside their male counterparts. Female MPs have crossed many gender barriers in the United States Armed Forces. * In the 1983 Invasion of Grenada, 4 female MPs from the 118th Military Police Company (Airborne) were deployed to Grenada. Conflicting views of women in combat caused them to be ordered back to the United States, only to be ordered back to Grenada days later. * In the 1989 United States invasion of Panama, CPT Linda Bray led the 988th Military Police Company in an assault against Panamanian Defense Forces, and is considered the first woman to lead U.S. troops in combat. CPT Bray was awarded the Commendation Medal for Valor. * SGT Leigh Ann Hester became the first woman since World War II to receive a Silver Star, for her actions in Iraq on 20 March 2005.Cucullu, 149 * Tulsi Gabbard became the first female to graduate Alabama Military Academy as the OCS distinguished honor graduate in March 2007, and one of the first women combat veterans to serve in United States Congress. * In 2010, Brigadier General Colleen L. McGuire became the first woman to hold the office of Provost Marshal General of the Army. * In 2015, CPT Kristen Griest, a military police commissioned officer, became one of the first two women to successfully complete U.S. Army Ranger School. *SFC Jeanne Balcombe and PFC Tekoa Lurray Brown became the first two female Military Police Officers killed in the line of duty (both in 1999) to be added to the National Law Enforcement Officers Memorial in Washington, DC (Balcombe: Panel 60-E: 21 Brown: panel 61-E: 21) Women now make up 25% of the MP Corps. The mixed-gender MP Corps is valued in the wars in Iraq and Afghanistan, where cultural taboos may prevent male soldiers from interacting with women.Cucullu, 252  Modern U.S. Army Military Police = Uniforms  Military Police soldier with an MP brassard bearing the shoulder sleeve insignia of the 89th MP Brigade In the U.S. Army, a simple patch with the legend \\"MP\\" worn on the left arm distinguishes a military-police soldier wearing the Army Combat Uniform (ACU). This patch is attached to the uniform by hook and loop fastener commonly referred to as Velcro. For both garrison law-enforcement duty as well as for tactical field work, the patch is a subdued brown with black lettering. U.S. military police used to be distinguished by a brassard worn on the left arm when on duty in previous uniform versions such as the Battle Dress Uniform. The brassard was black with white lettering for garrison law- enforcement duty and could include extra designations such as \\"Customs MP\\" or \\"K-9 MP\\" (for dog handlers). Tactical brassards were green with black lettering for temperate climates and sand with light brown lettering for desert duty. When wearing a Class A (suit) or B uniform they are authorized to wear combat boots instead of regulation low-cut shoes. However, like Airborne soldiers who may only wear the boots while on jump status, MPs may only wear these boots with Class A or B uniforms when performing law enforcement duties. During World War II, the emblems used were a wide white band around the helmet or a white helmet liner or a white peaked cap, a white webbing Sam Browne belt, white gloves, and white gaiters, atop the standard olive drab uniform. From this clothing, the nickname they were given by the British civilians at the time was \\"snowdrops.\\" An MP armband was also worn on the left arm, usually black or dark blue with white letters.  Weapons  The standard personal weapons of the United States Army military police include the 9mm Beretta M9 or SIG Sauer M17, the 5.56 M4 carbine, the 40mm M320 Grenade Launcher Module, the M2 .50cal Machine Gun, the M249 Squad Automatic Weapon (SAW) or M240B, and the Mossberg 500 shotgun or M26 Modular Accessory Shotgun System. MP team leaders are typically assigned an M4 with an M320 attached, drivers are assigned an M249 and gunners are assigned an M4 in addition to any other crew- served weapons they are responsible for. Crew-served or vehicle-based weapons used by MP fireteams include the M2 Browning machine gun, M240B, and Mk 19 grenade launcher. MP teams often carry one or two AT4 anti-tank weapons, as well. Military Police also utilize the use of PEDD (Patrol Explosive Detection Dogs) and SSD (Specialized Search Dogs) K9 Military Working Dogs.  Units  Military Police are considered maneuver support, and MP units may be organized at many different levels, based on the size of the unit it is meant to support. An Army Corps may contain one MP brigade, which is responsible for training and supplying subordinate Military Police units. When MP units are deployed, their parent unit may maintain administrative control (ADCON) while relinquishing tactical control (TACON) to the deployed unit being supported.  Military Police Investigations  Investigations are conducted by Military Police Investigators or the United States Army Criminal Investigation Command (USACIDC). Both are a part of the MP branch. The Military Police Investigations (MPI) office is usually responsible for the investigation of misdemeanor crimes, such as crimes against property under $5,000.00 and crimes against persons except felony murder and rape (handled by the CID) committed on a military installation, but they may investigate other crimes in certain circumstances. MPI personnel are enlisted MPs who go through a Military Police Investigation course at the Military Police School at Fort Leonard Wood, Missouri. CID special agents may be warrant officers, non-commissioned officers or Civilian Special Agents and have a distinct chain of command in order to protect the integrity of their investigations.

History  Kemari was a low lying island located between Manora and the city of Karachi well into the colonial era. During this time, Kemari was the landing point for all goods and people entering Karachi. Kemari's anchorage during the early colonial era was too shallow for large ships, and so those were instead forced to dock at Manora. The 3 mile long Napier Mole Road was built in 1854 as a raised embankment which connected Karachi with Kemari.Napier Mole Bridge to Keamari in Karachi A year earlier in 1853, the Napier obelisk was built to commemorate the late Governor of Sindh, Charles Napier. The British further built a spur of the Sindh Railway to Kemari, but which did not follow Napier Mole, but instead along the east part of Chinna creek. During the colonial era, Kemari had a naval yard, a government commissariat, post office, customs and railway houses. In 1865, the 1200 foot long iron Napier Mole Bridge was built as part of an upgrade. In 1914, the Sydenham Passenger Pavilion at Kemari's Boat Basin was inaugurated by Lord Willingdon. In 1917, the imposing Mules Mansion was completed, and was designed by Iraqi-Jewish architect Moses Somake.  Neighbourhoods  Most of the neighborhoods of the defunct Kemari Town are densely populated with two exceptions. Baba Bhit is composed of three small islands in Karachi harbour that are home to about 5% of the town's population. Further west, Gabo Pat is mostly rural with about 10% of the town population but half of the total town area. There are small villages in the rural area of Kiamari.  Sports  Kemari has many semi-professional football teams, including: * Kemari Mohammadan FC * Kemari Union FC * Society Brothers FC (formed 2010, dissolved 2014) * Mohammad Eleven FC * Ayaaz Eleven FC * Usman Shaheed FC (Shirin Jinnah Colony) * Northern Loon FC (formed 2014, present)  Gallery  File:Karachi map 1911.jpgIn 1911, Kiamari was still an island File:Mules Mansion 02.jpgKiamari's Mules Mansion built in 1917, was designed by Iraqi-Jewish architect Moses Somake File:St. George Church.jpgSt George's church dates from the colonial era File:Napier Mole Bridge to Keamari -Karachi in 1900-.jpgThe head of Napier Mole Bridge on the mainland File:Kemari.jpgA view of Kiamari Harbour File:THE SYDENHAM PASSENGER PAVILION -20th January 1913 at Keamari jetty.jpgSydenham Passenger Pavilion, inaugurated in 1914 File:Old Native Jetty Bridge.jpgNative Jetty bridge in 1900 See also *Kemari Town *Kemari District ReferencesExternal links *Karachi Website Category:Neighbourhoods of Karachi Category:Kiamari Town ","title":"Kemari (locality)"},{"id":"3587888","text":"Leonid Vasilyevich Solovyov () (August 19, 1906 - April 9, 1962) was a Russian writer and playwright. Life and works Born in Tripoli, Syria (now Lebanon) where his father taught at the Russian consulate, he began writing as a newspaper correspondent (in Uzbek) for the Pravda Vostoka, published in Tashkent. His first stories and sketches of life in Central Asia and the Middle East appeared in that newspaper and led to several collections of short stories. His first book was Lenin in Eastern Folk Art (Moscow, 1930), which he described as \\"a volume of Central Asian post-revolutionary folklore.\\" He is known for The Book of My Youth, and Tale of Hodja Nasreddin. It is based on the tales of the Middle Eastern folk hero Nasreddin (much as the 19th Century Belgian Charles De Coster based his own \\"Thyl Ulenspiegel and Lamme Goedzak\\" on the similar North European folk hero Till Eulenspiegel). During the Second World War, Solovyov served as a war correspondent and produced several wartime stories and screenplays. He also served for some time during that war in the Russian Navy, and several novels grew from his experiences there. In 1946, Solovyov was accused of conspiring to commit acts of terrorism against the Soviet state. He was interned in several prison camps until 1954, when he was cleared of all charges and released. The second part of The Tale of Hodja Nasreddin, subtitled \\"The Enchanted Prince\\", was written in the Dubravlag prison camp and completed around 1950. After his release, Solovyov settled in Leningrad. The two parts of The Tale of Hodja Nasreddin were published together for the first time in 1956 and enjoyed a very favorable reception. The Tale of Hodja Nasreddin, contains two novels: Disturber of the Peace, or Hodja Nasreddin in Bokhara (–í–æ–∑–º—É—Ç–∏—Ç–µ–ª—å —Å–ø–æ–∫–æ–π—Å—Ç–≤–∏—è) and The Enchanted Prince (–û—á–∞—Ä–æ–≤–∞–Ω–Ω—ã–π –ø—Ä–∏–Ω—Ü).

Both volumes were translated into English, the first appearing in the United States as Disturber of the Peace (1940), reprinted in 1956 as The Beggar in the Harem. Impudent Adventures in Old Bukhara (in England as Adventures in Bukhara). A new translation was released in 2009 under the title The Tale of Hodja Nasreddin: Disturber of the Peace (Translit Publishing, November 2009). The second volume appeared in 1957 as The Enchanted Prince. The book was translated into Hebrew and adapted as a very successful play in presented by the Cameri Theater in Tel Aviv, and revived on several later occasions.Shirshur Habima The satirical song \\"In Beautiful Bokahara\\" (◊ë◊ë◊ï◊õ◊®◊î ◊î◊ô◊§◊î), derived from the play, gained a life of its own, being performed by various well-known Israeli singers such as Arik Lavi and Nissim Garameh◊ë◊ë◊ï◊õ◊®◊î ◊î◊ô◊§◊î ◊ë◊ë◊ï◊õ◊®◊î ◊î◊ô◊§◊î Leonid Solovyov also wrote many screenplays including one based on Nikolai Gogol's story \\"The Overcoat\\".

It was founded in Paris, France between 6 and 9 October 1952, under the auspices of UNESCO, following a Resolution at the 6th UNESCO General Conference in 1951. It was adopted on 19 September 1972, completed and revised on 14 November 1979, and underwent multiple revisions on 17 December 1985, 3 December 1992, 27 November 1998, 8 November 2006 and finally 10 December 2010. ISSC is registered in accordance with French Law. In July 2018, the ISSC merged with the International Council for Science (ICSU) to form the International Science Council (ISC). Mission The mission of the ISSC was to advance the social sciences ‚Äì their quality, novelty, and utility ‚Äì in all parts of the world: * To advance social science research across national and regional boundaries; * To support social science capacity building, particularly in countries and regions where it is currently not well developed; * To provide a central clearinghouse for the collection, interpretation, analysis, and dissemination of data on social science resources, their availability for research and their impact on society; * To broaden interdisciplinary collaboration among the social sciences; * To expand exchange and joint work between the social sciences, the humanities, and other sciences; * To link social science knowledge effectively to public policies and local needs to improve the quality of people's lives; * To promote the social science literacy of citizens. The activities of the Council were guided by the principles of academic freedom, the pursuit of excellence, equitable access to scientific information and data, unfettered conduct of science, open communication and transparency, accountability, and the use of knowledge for societal value. Besides, the Council sought to support the participation of women, minorities, and others under-represented groups in social science research. Governance and structure The ISSC was governed by a General Assembly, comprising the Council's membership. The General Assembly met every three years to review the Council's activities and determine the general direction of its future work. The ISSC Executive Committee was elected by the General Assembly and acted as the Council's governing body. It consisted of the President, two Vice-Presidents and a Treasurer, as well as ten further members (Ordinary Members). The General Assembly, on the recommendation of the Executive Committee, approved the appointment of the Executive Director, who headed the Council's Secretariat, and served as an ex-officio member of the Executive Committee and all appointed (standing or ad hoc) committees of the ISSC. The Council was advised and guided by individuals from around the world who volunteered their time to serve on various ISSC Committees and Working Groups. Activities The ISSC led a number of flagship activities and was a partner on many collaborative initiatives. World Social Science Report The ISSC produced the World Social Science Report every three years, as part of its strategic partnership with UNESCO. The reports aim to address important social science challenges, take stock of social science contributions and capacities, and to make recommendations for future research, practice, and policy. * The World Social Science Report 2010: Knowledge Divides was prepared by the ISSC and published by UNESCO in June 2010. It reviewed social science knowledge production and use in different regions of the world and assessed how the social sciences are evolving in the face of unequal conditions and diverging trends. * The World Social Science Report 2013: Changing Global Environments was prepared by the ISSC and co-published with UNESCO and the OECD. It was launched at UNESCO in Paris in November 2013. * The World Social Science Report 2016: Challenging Inequalities ‚Äì Pathways to a Just World was prepared by the ISSC in collaboration with the Institute of Development Studies (IDS), and co-published with UNESCO. It was launched in Stockholm on September 22, 2016. World Social Science Forum The ISSC convened the World Social Science Forum. These events gathered researchers, funders, policymakers, and other stakeholders to debate topics of global significance and to determine future priorities for international social science. * The ISSC convened the first-ever World Social Science Forum in Bergen, Norway, 10-12 May 2009; on the topic 'One planet - worlds apart?' * The second World Social Science Forum, 'Social Transformations and the Digital Age,' took place in Montreal, Canada, in October 2013. * The third World Social Science Forum, 'Transforming Global Relations for a Just World,' took place in Durban, South Africa, 13-16 September 2015. * The fourth World Social Science Forum, 'Security and Equality for Sustainable Futures,' took place in Fukuoka, Japan, in September 2018. Transformations to Sustainability Transformations to Sustainability (T2S) is a research program supporting social-science-led research on social transformations to greater sustainability. The program is funded by the Swedish International Development Cooperation Agency (Sida) and has supported 38 seed projects (September 2014 to March 2015) and three Transformative Knowledge Networks (December 2015 to December 2018). The program aims to build on the networks of knowledge gathered through the seed projects and Transformative Knowledge Networks to create and leave behind a lasting global knowledge base. The Transformations to Sustainability program contributes to Future Earth. Programmes and networks The ISSC initiated and supported several international research programmes to foster comparative, interdisciplinary research by setting up networks of social scientists from different disciplines and regions of the world. The ISSC co-sponsored several international research programmes and networks around various themes, such as the environment, disaster risk, poverty, and gender. These initiatives were undertaken in partnership with various partners and other organisations around the world. * Comparative Research Programme on Poverty * Future Earth * International Human Dimensions Programme * Integrated Research on Disaster Risk * Gender, Globalisation, and Democratisation Network Prizes The ISSC was awarded two prestigious international prizes: the Stein Rokkan Prize for Comparative Social Science Research and the Foundation Mattei Dogan Prize for Excellence in Interdisciplinary Research. Nominations for the prize were made by ISSC members or other professional associations in various disciplines, as well as by universities and academic institutions. The selection of a winner is made by an international jury of scholars. World Social Science Fellows From 2012 to 2015, the ISSC led the World Social Science Fellows programme, an international scientific programme to support early-career researchers in the social sciences. ISSC aimed to foster a new generation of globally-networked research leaders who will collaborate in addressing global problems with particular relevance for low and middle-income countries.

Felker lived in Kansas his whole life, having attended Topeka public schools and then Washburn University, where he graduated with a Bachelor of Arts degree in political science in 1967. He subsequently attended Washburn School of Law where he earned his Juris Doctor in 1972. Following college, he first entered in the public life as the elected parks and Recreation commissioner of Topeka, a position he held from 1975 to 1985. He subsequently ran for mayor in 1989 and served for two terms before resigning due to health problems in 1997. In 2001, he ran for mayor again and served until 2003 before resigning amid a scandal. After leaving office, he ran the nonprofit Heartland Park Foundation. Scandal and resignation In 2002, Felker was investigated by the Kansas Governmental Ethics Commission who charged him with six counts of violating the state's campaign finance laws. This included allegations that employees of the Topeka Convention and Visitors Bureau filed false travel expense reports and subsequently donated the money to Felker's re-election campaign. The sources of these donations were also not properly documented by the campaign. In July 2003, he pleaded guilty to three ethics violations and two other ethics charges were subsequently dropped. He was fined $7,500. As a result of those violations, and of other alleged misconduct, the Shawnee County district attorney, Robert Hecht, brought an ouster trial against Felker and suspended him from work on October 10, 2003. The trial had been scheduled for November 17, 2003, although it was cancelled after Felker resigned from office on November 6. Duane Pomeroy, his deputy mayor, became the acting mayor following his resignation and during his suspension. In 2005, a second ethical complaint on the same incident was filed by a Kansas state disciplinary panel, this time alleging that he broke rules of professional conduct for lawyers.

Because the damage effects of explosive weapons fall off with distance according to a power law, even modest improvements in accuracy (and hence reduction in miss distance) enable a target to be effectively attacked with fewer or smaller bombs. Therefore, with guided weapons, fewer air crews are put at risk, less ordnance spent, and collateral damage reduced. The creation of precision- guided munitions resulted in the retroactive renaming of older bombs as unguided bombs or \\"dumb bombs\\".  Payload  A guided bomb of a given weight must carry fewer explosives to accommodate the guidance mechanisms.  Guidance  A laser-guided GBU-24 (BLU-109 warhead variant) strikes its target. Guided bombs carry a guidance system which is usually monitored and controlled from an external device.  Radio  The Germans were first to introduce Precision Guided Munitions (PGMs) in combat, using the 1,400-kg (3,100 lb) MCLOS-guidance Fritz X to successfully attack the Italian battleship Roma in September 1943. The closest Allied equivalents were the 1,000-lb (454 kg) AZON (AZimuth ONly), used in both Europe and the CBI Theater, and the US Navy's Bat, primarily used in the Pacific Theater of World War II which used autonomous, on-board radar guidance. In addition, the U.S. tested the rocket-propelled Gargoyle; it never entered service.Fitzsimons, op. cit., Volume 10, p.1090, \\"Gargoyle\\". No Japanese remotely guided PGMs ever saw service in World War II. The United States Army Air Forces used similar techniques with Operation Aphrodite, but had few successes; the German Mistel (Mistletoe) \\"parasite aircraft\\" was no more effective. The U.S. programs restarted in the Korean War. In the 1960s, the electro-optical bomb (or camera bomb) was reintroduced. They were equipped with television cameras and flare sights, by which the bomb would be steered until the flare superimposed the target. The camera bombs transmitted a \\"bomb's eye view\\" of the target back to a controlling aircraft. An operator in this aircraft then transmitted control signals to steerable fins fitted to the bomb. Such weapons were used increasingly by the USAF in the last few years of the Vietnam War because the political climate was increasingly intolerant of civilian casualties, and because it was possible to strike difficult targets (such as bridges) effectively with a single mission; the Thanh Hoa Bridge, for instance, was attacked repeatedly with gravity bombs, to no effect, only to be dropped in one mission with PGMs. Although not as popular as the newer JDAM and JSOW weapons, or even the older laser-guided bomb systems, weapons like the AGM-62 Walleye TV-guided bomb are still being used, in conjunction with the AAW-144 Data Link Pod, on US Navy F/A-18 Hornets.  Infrared  In World War II, the U.S. National Defense Research Committee developed the VB-6 Felix, which used infrared to home on ships. While it entered production in 1945, it was never employed operationally.Fitzsimons, op. cit., Volume 9, p.926, \\"Felix\\".  Laser  GBU-10 shortly before it impacts a small boat during a training exercise In 1962, the US Army began research into laser guidance systems and by 1967 the USAF had conducted a competitive evaluation leading to full development of the world's first laser-guided bomb, the BOLT-117, in 1968. All such bombs work in much the same way, relying on the target being illuminated, or \\"painted,\\" by a laser target designator on the ground or on an aircraft. They have the significant disadvantage of not being usable in poor weather where the target illumination cannot be seen, or where it is not possible to get a target designator near the target. The laser designator sends its beam in a series of encrypted pulses so the bomb cannot be confused by an ordinary laser, and also so multiple designators can operate in reasonable proximity. Laser-guided weapons did not become commonplace until the advent of the microchip. They made their practical debut in Vietnam, where on 13 May 1972 when they were used in the second successful attack on the Thanh Hoa Bridge (\\"Dragon's Jaw\\"). This structure had previously been the target of 800 American sortiesThanh Hoa Bridge (using unguided weapons) and was partially destroyed in each of two successful attacks, the other being on 27 April 1972 using Walleyes. That first mission also had laser-guided weapons, but bad weather prevented their use. They were used, though not on a large scale, by the British forces during the 1982 Falklands War.Britain's Small Wars The first large-scale use of smart weapons came in 1991 during Operation Desert Storm when they were used by coalition forces against Iraq. Even so, most of the air-dropped ordnance used in that war was \\"dumb,\\" although the percentages are biased by the large use of various (unguided) cluster bombs. Laser-guided weapons were used in large numbers during the 1999 Kosovo War, but their effectiveness was often reduced by the poor weather conditions prevalent in the southern Balkans. There are two basic families of laser-guided bombs in American (and American-sphere) service: the Paveway II and the Paveway III. The Paveway III guidance system is more aerodynamically efficient and so has a longer range, however it is more expensive. Paveway II 500-pound LGBs (such as GBU-12) are a cheaper lightweight PGM suitable for use against vehicles and other small targets, while a Paveway III 2000-pound penetrator (such as GBU-24) is a more expensive weapon suitable for use against high-value targets. GBU-12s were used to great effect in the first Gulf War, dropped from F-111F aircraft to destroy Iraqi armored vehicles in a process referred to as \\"tank plinking.\\"  Satellite  An F-22 releases a JDAM from its center internal bay while flying at supersonic speed Lessons learned during the first Gulf War showed the value of precision munitions, yet they also highlighted the difficulties in employing them‚Äîspecifically when visibility of the ground or target from the air was degraded.JDAM continues to be warfighter's weapon of choice The problem of poor visibility does not affect satellite-guided weapons such as Joint Direct Attack Munition (JDAM) and Joint Stand-Off Weapon (JSOW), which make use of the United States' GPS system for guidance. This weapon can be employed in all weather conditions, without any need for ground support. Because it is possible to jam GPS, the guidance package reverts to inertial navigation in the event of GPS signal loss. Inertial navigation is significantly less accurate; the JDAM achieves a published circular error probable (CEP) of 13 m under GPS guidance, but typically only 30 m under inertial guidance (with free fall times of 100 seconds or less).U.S. Air Force Factsheets: Joint Direct Attack MunitionJDAM Specifications HOPE/HOSBO of the Luftwaffe with a combination of GPS/INS and electro-optical guidance The precision of these weapons is dependent both on the precision of the measurement system used for location determination and the precision in setting the coordinates of the target. The latter critically depends on intelligence information, not all of which is accurate. According to a CIA report, the accidental bombing of the Chinese embassy in Belgrade during Operation Allied Force by NATO aircraft was attributed to faulty target information.DCI Statement on the Belgrade Chinese Embassy However, if the targeting information is accurate, satellite-guided weapons are significantly more likely to achieve a successful strike in any given weather conditions than any other type of precision-guided munition. Other military satellite guidance systems include: Russian GLONASS, European Galileo (satellite navigation), Chinese BeiDou Navigation Satellite System, regional Indian Regional Navigation Satellite System, Japanese regional Quasi-Zenith Satellite System.  History  The guided bomb had its origins in World War II. Its usage increased after the success of the weapon in the Gulf War.  World War II  BAT guided bomb In World War II, the aforementioned Fritz X and Henschel Hs 293 guided ordnance designs were used in combat by Nazi Germany against ships, as the USAAF would do with the Azon in hitting bridges and other hard-to-hit targets in both Western Europe and Burma. Later, U.S. National Defense Research Committee developed the VB-6 Felix, which used infrared to home on ships. While it entered production in 1945, it was never employed operationally.Fitzsimons, op. cit., Volume 9, p.926, \\"Felix\\".  Korean War  The US briefly deployed the ASM-A-1 Tarzon (or VB-13 Tarson) bomb (a Tallboy fitted with radio guidance) during the Korean War, dropping them from Boeing B-29 Superfortresses.  Vietnam War  In 1962, the US Army began research into laser guidance systems and by 1967 the USAF had conducted a competitive evaluation leading to full development of the world's first laser-guided bomb, the BOLT-117, in 1968. Gulf War  GBU-12 Paveway IIs were used to great effect in the first Gulf War, dropped from F-111F aircraft to destroy Iraqi armored vehicles in a process referred to as \\"tank plinking\\".  Era of non-linear warfare  Lessons learned during the first Gulf War showed the value of guided bombs.  Advanced guidance concepts  Responding to after-action reports from pilots who employed laser and/or satellite guided weapons, Boeing has developed a Laser JDAM (LJDAM) to provide both types of guidance in a single kit. Based on the existing JDAM configurations, a laser guidance package is added to a GPS/INS guided weapon to increase the overall accuracy of the weapons.Boeing Laser JDAM Raytheon has developed the Enhanced Paveway family, which adds GPS/INS guidance to their Paveway family of laser-guidance packages.Raytheon Enhanced Paveway These \\"hybrid\\" laser and GPS guided weapons permit the carriage of fewer weapons types, while retaining mission flexibility, because these weapons can be employed equally against moving and fixed targets, or targets of opportunity. For instance, a typical weapons load on an F-16 flying in the Iraq War included a single 2,000-lb JDAM and two 1,000-lb LGBs. With LJDAM, and the new Small Diameter Bomb, these same aircraft can carry more bombs if necessary, and have the option of satellite or laser guidance for each weapon release.

He was murdered at Batum, Georgia, then part of the Russian Empire, while serving as a United States vice-consul there. Family Stuart was born in Harrow, London, in 1857 to William Stuart M.A. (1816-1896), who later served as Vicar of Mundon, Essex (1862-1889), and Rector of Hazeleigh, Essex (1889-1896). His mother was Caroline (1834-1921), youngest daughter of Edward Horwood of The Manor House, Weston Turville, Buckinghamshire. He was also a nephew of the diplomat Major Robert Stuart and the surgeon and artist James Stuart, as well as a great-nephew of the Indophile Charles \\"Hindoo\\" Stuart, and a descendant of Lieutenant-General William Spry. Early career In 1873 Stuart was serving as Private Secretary to his uncle Major Robert Stuart, a British consul-general for the Russian ports on the Black Sea and the Sea of Azov at Odessa, Ukraine. In the 1880s he was based at BrƒÉila in Romania, where, in July 1885, his younger brother Charles Leader Justice Stuart drowned in the Danube at the age of 16. In Batum By the early 1890s, Stuart had moved to Batum, where he remained until his death. In 1904 he became an American vice- consul and in 1906 was also serving as an acting British consul. Stuart had been named Japanese consul but his appointment was deferred owing to the outbreak of the Russo-Japanese War. While serving in Batum, Stuart actively lobbied for the American interests in the region and was connected with an American copper-mining concern in the Caucasus.Saul, Norman E. (1996), Concord and Conflict: the United States and Russia, 1867-1914, p. 520. University Press of Kansas, He was the representative of several British companies, including MacAndrew Forbes. He was one of the largest ship-brokers and exporters of Batum. At about 11 p.m. on 20 May 1906, Stuart was returning to his home at Makhinjauri, 5 miles north of Batum, after dining with a friend, when he was shot three times from behind a tree. He was taken to a nearby military barracks but died within an hour. It seems likely that the murder was committed for personal reasons and that the murderers were paid to carry out the act. Stuart had spent most of his life in Eastern Europe and could speak several local languages; he was respected by the local populations but during the revolutionary uprisings of the previous year, his life was threatened and he was obliged to hand over large amounts of cash.

The Supreme Court of Cassation () is the highest court of appeal or court of last resort in Italy. It has its seat in the Palace of Justice, Rome. The Court of Cassation also ensures the correct application of law in the inferior and appeal courts and resolves disputes as to which lower court (penal, civil, administrative, military) has jurisdiction to hear a given case. Procedure The Italian Supreme Court of Cassation is the highest court of Italy. Appeals to the Court of Cassation generally come from the Appellate Court, the second instance courts, but defendants or prosecutors may also appeal directly from trial courts, first instance courts. The Supreme Court can reject, or confirm, a sentence from a lower court. If it rejects the sentence, it can order the lower court to amend the trial and sentencing, or it can annul the previous sentence altogether. A sentence confirmed by the Supreme Court of Cassation is final and definitive, and cannot be further appealed for the same reasons. Although the Supreme Court of Cassation cannot overrule the trial court's interpretation of the evidence it can correct a lower court's interpretation or application of the law connected to a specific case.G. Di Federico, La Corte di cassazione: la giustizia come organizzazione, Laterza Editore, 1969. As explained by the Cassazione, ¬´The appeal in cassation may be lodged against the measures issued by the ordinary courts at the appellate level or in degree only: the reasons given to support the use may be, in civil matters, the violation of the right material (errores in iudicando) or procedural (errores in proceeding), the vices of motivation (lack, insufficiency or contradiction) of the judgment under appeal; or, again, the grounds for jurisdiction. A similar scheme is expected to appeal to the Supreme Court in criminal matters¬ª. The Italian judicial system is based on civil law within the framework of late Roman law, and not based on common law. Its core principles are entirely codified into a normative system which serves as the primary source of law, which means judicial decisions of the supreme court, as well as those of lower courts, are binding within the frame of reference of each individual case submitted, but do not constitute the base for judicial precedent for other future cases as in Common Law. It is worth noting that while in Civil Law jurisdictions the doctrine of stare decisis (precedent) does not apply, however, in practice the decisions of the Supreme Court of Cassation usually provide a very robust reference point in jurisprudence constante. The two essential aims of the Supreme Court of Cassation are to ensure that lower courts correctly follow legal procedure, and to harmonize the interpretation of laws throughout the judicial system. Members and organization The Supreme Court of Cassation is organized into two divisions: a criminal section and a civil section. The court has a general president, The First President of the Court of Cassation, a deputy, and each section has its own president. Cases brought to the supreme court are normally heard by a panel of five judges. In more complex cases, especially those concerning compounded matters of statutory interpretation an extended panel of nine judges (\\"united sections\\" of the supreme court) hear the case.P. Calamandrei, Istituzioni di diritto processuale civile, Padova, 1943G. Leone, Lineamenti di diritto processuale penale italiano, Giuffre Editore, 1956 In addition, in every case submitted to the supreme court, the office of public prosecutor must state their interpretation of the applicable law, to assist and facilitate the court, in a consultative capacity, in reaching its final decision.S. Satta, Diritto processuale civile, CEDAM, Padova, 1959V. Lacoppola, La competenza civile nella giurisprudenza della cassazione, Milano, 1988. Brief history The need for this kind of court in Europe became apparent with the Ancien R√©gime's difficulties in maintaining both uniformity of interpretation and supremacy of the central laws against local privileges and rights. This kind of court first appeared during the French Revolution. The original French courts were initially much more like a legislative body than a judicial one. During his conquests, Napoleon greatly influenced Italian legal theory, and the Court of Cassation was formed using many imported French ideas. The Court of Cassation was provided by the former Italian Civil Code in 1865 and then it was reorganized by royal decree 12 on 30 January 1941, supplanting the previous court.The Court of Appeal judges, during the fascism, sometimes escaped the rigors of the dictates of the local Fascist boss by judgments condemning with contradictory motivations, so as to achieve by the Supreme Court \\"liberal\\" absolution for inadequacy of motivation: See also *Court of cassation (for other courts of cassation around the world) *Corte Costituzionale ReferencesExternal links * *Unofficial search engine of new cases from Corte di Cassazione Category:Judiciary of Italy Italy Category:1923 establishments in Italy Category:Courts and tribunals established in 1923 ","title":"Supreme Court of Cassation (Italy)"},{"id":"3588045","text":"City Hall and Masonic Temple, Philadelphia South Broad Street, looking towards City Hall (c. 1895) Armistice Day 1918 on Broad Street North Broad Street, looking towards City Hall Broad Street at night along the \\"Avenue of the Arts\\" section, looking north towards City Hall, 2005. Broad Street in the Cecil B. Moore area near 220px Cheltenham Township Broad Street is a major arterial street in Philadelphia, Pennsylvania. It runs for approximately beginning at the intersection of Cheltenham Avenue on the border of Cheltenham Township and the West/East Oak Lane neighborhoods of North Philadelphia to the Philadelphia Navy Yard in South Philadelphia. It is Pennsylvania Route 611 along its entire length with the exception of its northernmost part between historic Old York Road and Pennsylvania Route 309 (Cheltenham Avenue) and the southernmost part south of Interstate 95. Broad Street runs north‚Äìsouth, in between 13th Street and 15th Street, containing what would otherwise be known as 14th Street in the Philadelphia grid plan. It is interrupted by Philadelphia City Hall, which stands where Broad and Market Street would intersect in the center of the city. The streets of Penn Square, Juniper Street, John F. Kennedy Boulevard, and 15th Street form a circle around City Hall at this point. It is one of the earliest planned streets in the United States, and is listed on the National Register of Historic Places as a continuous north-south street, planned by surveyor Thomas Holme and developed for Philadelphia in 1681 Broad Street is served by many public transit routes, including SEPTA's Broad Street Line subway and several SEPTA City Bus routes.  History  Image of City Hall from North Broad Street showing the new lighting masts. The lighting masts begin a block south of Spring Garden Street and move north. Broad Street has gone through various changes since its beginnings in Colonial America. Thomas Holme introduced the first geographical plan of the city to William Penn in 1687. Composing of a center square, Holme designed the street to be roughly across and long. Penn intended that the center square would eventually be home to Philadelphia's City Hall. During the American Revolution, the street was often settled by troops moving in and out of the city. As the city's population grew, Broad was extended both north to Vine and south to Dickinson, eventually reaching the Delaware Waterfront, where today's Philadelphia Naval Shipyard stands. It remains Philadelphia's longest straightaway and one of the longest urban boulevards in the United States. During the early stages of the 19th century, Broad Street was home to many wealthy residents, especially around the Rittenhouse square area. Homes were designed in Victorian and Gothic styles. South Broad became center for the fine arts with the establishment of the Academy of Music in 1857. A Masonic Temple, The Pennsylvania Academy of the Fine Arts and the Adelphi Theater were also built during the same time period. Banks and offices grew in number around center city as well as high rise structures. The corner of Spring Garden housed Baldwin Locomotive Works founded by Matthias Baldwin in 1825. Baldwin's company was one of the biggest steam locomotive producers before the transition to diesel powered trains. Broad Street's biggest addition came with the construction of City Hall intersecting Broad and Market. With the progression of the Industrial Revolution Philadelphia became a center for trade and commerce. Transportation growth gained prominence with the construction of the Broad Street Station in 1881. Social life dominated the street during the second half of the 19th century. Elaborate hotels such as the Divine Lorraine and the Majestic were centers for night life. Standing over 10 stories tall the Lorraine was one of the tallest residential structures in Philadelphia. Private clubs such as the Columbia and Mercantile were popular during the Gilded Age. At the turn of the 20th century, Broad Street transformed from a bustling boulevard to a cultural magnet for music and the arts. January 1, 1901 introduced the very first Mummers Day parade which has become a staple of Philadelphia culture. Jazz and gospel gained popularity at the grassroots level due primarily to the Great Migration of the early 1900s. One such place for Jazz and Blues music was the Uptown Theater, built in 1927. By the 1950s Broad Street residential areas had been replaced with skyscrapers as well as the newly developed Penn Center. Since the 70s the street has undergone various city renovations. With $100 million in public funds Broad has received new lighting and streetscaping, restored theaters as well as new restaurants and cafes. Lamp post fixtures have been improved as well as sidewalk pavements and subway entrances. In 2015 Philadelphia Mayor, Michael Nutter, introduced a $8.7 million project to brighten North Broad with 41 stainless steel light masts. Cultural landmarks Broad Street is home to several Philadelphia cultural landmarks. During the administration of Mayor Ed Rendell, Broad Street between Spruce and Market Streets, became known as the Avenue of the Arts, where it is home to art galleries, the Academy of Music, and the Kimmel Center. North of City Hall is the Pennsylvania Academy of the Fine Arts. The South Philadelphia Sports Complex, near Broad's south end along Southern Boulevard Parkway, is the site of Citizens Bank Park, Lincoln Financial Field, and the Wells Fargo Center. Demolished sports facilities located in this area were John F. Kennedy Stadium, the Spectrum, and Veterans Stadium. As a result, the Philadelphia Flyers are nicknamed the \\"Broad Street Bullies\\". South of the sports complex and interchanges with the Schuylkill Expressway (Interstate 76) and Interstate 95, Broad Street has its southern terminus in the former Philadelphia Naval Shipyard. The former offices for The Philadelphia Inquirer and Philadelphia Daily News newspapers are on Broad Street just north of City Hall and the former PA State Building is at the intersection with Spring Garden Street. Most recently, the Public School District Administration relocated between these two landmarks. Also located on North Broad at its intersection with Fairmount Avenue is the historic Divine Lorraine Hotel. Farther north, Broad passes through the campus of Temple University. Included on Temple's campus is the performing arts center, established in 1891. Once a Baptist temple, it has now become a prime part of the \\"Avenue of the Arts.\\" Where Broad Street intersects with Clearfield Street in North Philadelphia is the exact location of the 40th Parallel. At the corner of Broad and W. Glenwood Ave is the former personal gym of heavyweight champion boxer, Joe Frazier. Having lived atop the gym for several years, it has now been turned into a furniture store.  Traditions and Customs  Broad Street often serves as the main parade route for Philadelphia sports championship parades, most recently for the Eagles Super Bowl LII victory. During the Phillies 2008 World Series victory parade, an estimated 2 million people lined Broad Street. The largest gathering for a championship parade was for the Flyers in . One of the busiest streets in the country, Broad Street is shut down for the annual Broad Street Run. Passing by some of Philadelphia's most famous landmarks, the course averages over 35,000 participants a year. Additionally, the section of Broad Street from near Oregon Avenue (Marconi Plaza) to City Hall, in South Philadelphia and Center City, is the traditional location of the Mummers Parade on New Years Day. Public transportation SEPTA's Broad Street Line provides subway service along much of Broad Street Public transportation along Broad Street includes SEPTA's Broad Street Line subway, which served an average of about 137,000 riders per weekday in 2010, running beneath Broad Street for most of its length.

The society's name derives from the Blessed Virgin Mary, whom the members attempt to imitate in their spirituality and daily work. Foundation (1816‚Äì1836) The idea of a new Marian body to fill the vacuum left by the suppression of the Society of Jesus had been widespread for some time and had arisen also in the post-revolutionary diocese of Lyons. In the diocesan seminaries there, one seminarian, Jean-Claude Courveille (1787‚Äì1866), had an initial inspiration regarding the foundation of a specific congregation to be called the \\"Society of Mary\\", but the leading role in bringing the plan to fruition was taken up by Father Jean-Claude Colin, who emerged as the real founder, even though he was the most retiring of the group. The context was in part the fall of Napoleon in 1815 and the restoration of the Bourbon Dynasty, which seemed to offer an opportunity for a revival of the Catholic Church and a return to evangelisation of the increasingly de-Christianized population. Colin was assigned after ordination to Cerdon where he was assistant to the pastor, his elder brother Pierre. There Jean-Claude began drafting a tentative rule for the group of priests and with Jeanne-Marie Chavoin founded the Sisters of the Holy Name of Mary, later called Marist Sisters. Another member of the same group of former seminarians, the priest Saint Marcellin Champagnat, established at La Valla-en-Gier the Little Brothers of Mary. The reception from the ecclesiastical authorities in Lyon was decidedly cool since the diocese was afraid of losing priests from its control, given the dramatic local needs. For this reason, little progress could be made toward the foundation of the priests' branch as a religious congregation until Cerdon, Colin's parish, passed from the jurisdiction of Lyon Diocese to a revived diocese of Belley. In 1823, Bishop Devie of Belley authorised Colin and a few companions to resign their parish duties and form into a travelling missionary band for the rural districts. Their zeal and success in that difficult work moved the bishop to entrust them also with the conduct of his minor seminary, thus enlarging the scope of their work. However, little progress could be made toward the foundation of a true religious congregation, since like the Lyons authorities, Bishop Devie wanted at most a diocesan institute only, while Fr. Colin was averse to such a limitation. This came near placing the nascent institute in jeopardy. Missionary needs in Oceania By the beginning of the 19th century Christian churches were well established in the Americas, Europe, and Australia. Christian evangelization efforts turned to Africa, Asia, and Oceania. The Holy See, keen to establish the Catholic faith in this area, entrusted its evangelization efforts of Oceania to the Congregation of the Sacred Hearts of Jesus and Mary (Picpus Fathers). Subsequently the territory was divided, so that the Holy See assigned a Vicariate Apostolic of Eastern Oceania (including Tahiti, the Marquesas, and Hawaii) to the Picpus Fathers, and established a Vicariate Apostolic of Western Oceania (including Micronesia, Melanesia, Fiji, New Zealand, Samoa, and Tonga) which was assigned to the Society of Mary (Marists). It was as a result of some preliminary contacts with Rome that this missionary task was proposed to the Marists, and upon their acceptance Pope Gregory XVI, by a Brief of April 29, 1836, formally approved the \\"Priests of the Society of Mary\\" or Marist Fathers as a religious institute with simple vows and under a Superior General. The Little Brothers of Mary and the Sisters of the Holy Name of Mary, commonly called Marist Brothers and Marist Sisters, were not included but were to be separate institutes. Father Colin was elected Superior General on September 24, 1836, and on that same day the first Marist religious professions took place. Along with Colin the first professed included two who would become saints: Saint Peter Chanel, S.M., martyred on the island of Futuna, and Saint Marcellin Champagnat, S.M., founder of the Marist Brothers. Early development (1836‚Äì1910) Venerable Jean-Claude Colin, Founder of the Society of Mary From its definitive organisation the Society of Mary developed in and out of France, along the various lines of its constitutions . In France it did mission work in various centres. When educational liberty was restored to French Catholics, it also entered the field of secondary or \\"college\\" education, its methods being embodied in Montfat's \\"Th√©orie et pratique de l'education chr√©tienne\\" (Paris, 1880). It also assumed the direction of a few diocesan seminaries together with professorships in Catholic universities. The French province also supplied men for the various missions undertaken abroad by the Society of Mary. Outside France, the first field of labour was the Vicariate Apostolic of Western Oceania, comprising New Zealand, Tonga, Samoa, the Gilbert (now known as Kiribati) and Marshall Islands, Fiji, New Caledonia, New Guinea, the Solomon and the Caroline Islands. Under vicar apostolic Bishop Jean Baptiste Pompallier who took up residence in New Zealand, the Marists successively moved to Wallis in 1837, soon converted by Father Pierre Bataillon; Futuna in 1837, the place of Saint Pierre Chanel's martyrdom; Tonga in 1842; New Caledonia in 1843, where Bishop Douarre, Pompallier's coadjutor, met untold difficulties and Brother Blaise was massacred; and, in spite of much Protestant opposition, Fiji in 1844 and Samoa in 1845. The immense area of the vicariate, together with the presence of a diocesan bishop as its head, soon necessitated the creation of smaller districts under Marist bishops: Central Oceania under Bishop Bataillon (1842), Melanesia and Micronesia under Bishop Epalle (1844), New Caledonia under Bishop Douarre (1847), and Wellington (New Zealand) under Bishop Viard (1848). Bishop Pompallier retained Auckland and the Navigator Islands (1851), long administered by the Vicar Apostolic of Central Oceania, along with the Prefecture of Fiji (1863). Of all these, Melanesia and Micronesia had to be abandoned after the murder of Bishop Epalle at Isabella Island and the sudden death of his successor, Bishop Colomb, the Solomon Islands alone reverting to the Marists in 1898. Those various missions have progressed steadily under the Marist Fathers who, besides their religious work, have largely contributed to make known the languages, fauna, and flora of the South Sea Islands. The growth of New Zealand has been such as to call for a regular hierarchy, and the Marists were concentrated (1887) in the Roman Catholic Archdiocese of Wellington and Diocese of Christchurch that were still governed by members of the institute. In Australia they established a base at Hunters Hill in Sydney which supported missionary activity.A.P. Jeffcott, The coming of the Marist Fathers to Australia and the history of Villa Maria, Sydney, Journal of the Australian Catholic Historical Society 3 (2) (1970), 13‚Äì28; J. Hosie, The Marist Fathers in Australia ‚Äì the first ten years, 1837‚Äì47, Journal of the Australian Catholic Historical Society 2 (3) (1968), 1‚Äì21. Saint Peter Chanel, Marist Father and Martyr Spirituality The Society of Mary was founded in a time of great turmoil and difficulty for the French clergy and religious institutions. In this time of unrest a strong notion of eschatology arose within the circle of seminarians that would become the first Marists. It was in this atmosphere that the Marian maxim \\"I (Mary) was the mainstay of the new-born Church; I shall be again at the end of time\\" began to circulate. The early Marists saw themselves as the ones to live and minister under Mary's name. That was the core of the spiritual understanding of what they saw as their vocation. Marist spirituality is largely based on the vision of Jean- Claude Colin. A phrase that was central to his understanding of religious life was \\"Ignoti et quasi occulti in hoc mundo\\", unknown and partially hidden in this world. For Colin this sentence is exemplary for the way Mary lived the Gospel in a humble, modest, and simple way. The Marists are called to imitate Mary in this way of life and ministry. Colin said Marists must \\"think as Mary, judge as Mary, feel and act as Mary in all things.\\" Colin called the missionary and pastoral activity of the Marists the \\"Work of Mary\\". According to Marist tradition the Society of Mary as a whole and every individual Marist is called to be an \\"Instrument of Mercy\\" for all mankind. As Mary was a healing presence in the Early Church so the Marists want to be present in the Church of their days. Notable Marist Fathers The Australian Marist priest Fr Austin Woodbury established the Aquinas Academy, a school of Thomist philosophy for laypeople, in Sydney in 1945 and ran it successfully for thirty years. The Australian Marist priest Fr Paul Glynn is the author of the best- selling Song for Nagasaki. His brother and fellow Marist priest, Fr Tony Glynn, also worked in Japan and promoted reconciliation between Japan and its former enemies. The Irish historian, Fr. Brendan Bradshaw, was a Marist Father. His decision to join the religious institute opened up opportunities for further studies and he then took his first degree at University College, Dublin. It was at this point he moved to Cambridge and undertook graduate research with Prof. Sir Geoffrey Elton. He was a graduate student at Corpus Christi and then had the good fortune to be elected to a Research Fellowship at St John's. Appointment to a University Lectureship followed at Queens' College, Cambridge, in due course. Certain themes recur in Bradshaw's work: the importance of history and experience for identity, particularly in Ireland; the inadequacies of Whig history; the importance of thorough documentary analysis as the only basis for decent history, although this is coupled with an awareness of the value of literary sources for the historian. For Fr. Bradshaw, the historian, like any other intellectual, has a duty to communicate with society. The seventh Bishop of Brentwood is Alan Williams, who is an English Marist Father. St. Peter Julian Eymard who later founded his own religious order Congregation of the Blessed Sacrament Other areas Saint Marcellin Champagnat, Marist Father and Founder of the Marist School Brothers In Great Britain, the Marist foundations began as early as 1850 at the request of Nicholas Cardinal Wiseman, Archbishop of Westminster, but have not grown beyond three colleges and five parishes. In the United States, the Society of Mary took a firmer hold. From Louisiana, whither Archbishop Odin called them in 1863 to take charge of a French parish and college, the Marists passed into eleven states and branched off into Mexico, and, although continuing to minister to a number of French speaking communities, did not limit their action there but took up other ministries and apostolates. They operate the Lourdes Center in Boston, Massachusetts, established in 1950 by Richard Cardinal Cushing and Bishop Pierre-Marie Theas to distribute Lourdes water in the United States. Today Today the Society, with its Generalate in Rome, operates in 7 Provinces: Australia, Canada, Europe, Mexico, New Zealand, Oceania, and USA, along with four mission districts: Africa (Senegal and Cameroun), Brazil, Peru-Venezuela, and the Philippines. The European Provinces, Districts, and Delegations (England, Ireland, France, Germany, Italy, the Netherlands, Spain and Portugal) reconfigured in 2008 and formed the new European Province. The Provinces in the United States (Atlanta and Boston) became one Province (USA) on January 1, 2009. There are around 1000 Marists worldwide. While the provinces and districts named are often countries, Marists also work in countries which are not named including many Pacific countries, Japan, Thailand, and Norway.
