The aim of the operation was to seize and hold a portion of the Kabul‚ÄìJalalabad highway for a short period of time, an action that was aimed at weakening the hold of the Afghan government over Jalalabad. Preparation The initiator and overall commander of the operation was General Abdul Rahim Wardak, a former officer in the Afghan Army, who at this time belonged to National Islamic Front of Afghanistan (NIFA), a Mujahideen party based in Peshawar. The operation was planned shortly after Soviet forces had withdrawn from Nangarhar Province, and its objective was to prevent the DRA from reinforcing its presence in Jalalabad in prevision of a future Mujahideen offensive against that city, scheduled for 1989. It was part of a campaign to close the highway for a period of two months, involving different Mujahideen parties, including NIFA, Jamiat-e Islami, Hezbi Islami and Hezb-e Islami Khalis, each one responsible for closing the highway for 15 days. Wardak divided his forces into nine separate task forces, numbering between 130 and 350 men each, for a total force of 2,600. Besides small-arms, they were armed with MILAN anti-tank missiles, 82 and 75 mm recoilless rifles, 82 mm mortars, 107 and 122 mm Saqar rockets and Stinger missiles. Five task forces were assigned as strike groups, each charged with seizing a specific stretch of the highway, two were used as blocking forces against the expected DRA counterattack, one group was held in reserve, and one was given the mission of bombarding Kabul International Airport with Saqar rockets, in order to disrupt DRA air operations. Organising the Mujahideen attack took Wardak two months, moving supplies to forward depots, and deploying units into the target area. The objective was a 70-kilometer stretch of highway between Sarobi and Surkhakan bridge, near Mehtar Lam. This area was defended by various DRA units belonging to the 8th and 18th border guard brigades, the 8th infantry division, the 15th tank brigade, supported by a SarandoyMinistry of interior troops battalion and various local militia groups. These units manned a series of outposts and bases, whose purpose was to keep the strategic highway open. Each outpost was manned by five to ten men, armed with heavy machine-guns, mortars and AGS-17s. Each base was occupied by platoon-sized units, reinforced with one or two tanks or armoured personnel carriers, medium artillery and mortars. The operation =Phase one= The main attack began on the night of October, 23. The area surrounding the road had been heavily mined, except in a series of arroyos that had been cleared of mines by flash floods. The Mujahideen were able to infiltrate through these arroyos, and used the highway as their main axis of approach. Under covering fire from heavy machine guns, mortars and rocket launchers sited on the surrounding heights, the strike groups stormed the DRA outposts, most of which fell after bitter fighting. Between October 23 and 31, sixteen DRA outposts and six bases were captured along with large quantities of equipment and large numbers of prisoners. =Phase two= During the second phase, from October 31 to November 6, the Mujahideen defended the areas they had captured against a DRA offensive. The first DRA reaction was to launch artillery and air strikes against suspected Mujahideen positions. However, the rugged terrain and the threat of anti-aircraft weapons caused the aircraft to fly high, limiting the precision of their attacks. From 1 November, DRA forces initiated a buildup with a view to reopening the highway, attacking both from the north and from the south. They also launched an offensive into Nangrahar province, and many Mujahideen who came from there left the front to defend their homes. With limited forces at his disposal, Wardak concentrated his front on a four-kilometer stretch of road protected by the Kabul River on both sides, as the Mujahideen had destroyed both bridges spanning the river. From November 1 to November 6, the DRA forces tried to cross the river, using bridge-laying equipment, but their attempts were repeatedly foiled by Mujahideen fire, and several engineering vehicles and tanks were destroyed. =Phase third= On November 6, all Mujahideen groups ceased firing, and implemented radio silence. The DRA forces, believing that they had withdrawn, continued their advance, until they were well engaged into the last Mujahideen-held section of highway. The Mujahideen had in fact not retreated, and the DRA columns advanced into well-prepared ambush positions. At 1600 hours the Mujahideen opened fire against the DRA units, who had pushed so many vehicles into the area that it caused a traffic jam. Many vehicles were destroyed or damaged, and the DRA columns broke up, before retreating hurriedly into Sarobi. At 1900 hours, the Mujahideen broke contact and withdrew without mishap. Aftermath Operation Arrow represented a significant victory for the Mujahideen, and demonstrated their ability to conduct well-planned well-coordinated operations. Their success was more political than military, as it boosted the failing prestige of the NIFA faction, who were the main contributors. General Wardak proved his ability on this occasion by creating an effective command and control structure, surrounding himself with a staff of 70 former Afghan army officers. Their leadership, both flexible and resolute, led the Mujahideen to victory. However, the operation also underlined several problems. The Mujahideen were mostly part-time fighters, and they were often unwilling to fight for long periods away from their villages, limiting their capacity to fight drawn-out battles. Operation Arrow lasted only fifteen days, but already during that period, many Mujahideen preferred to return home. The idea of carrying out a large-scale operation reflected conventional military thinking, ill-adapted to guerrilla warfare. The Mujahideen were better suited to fight in small groups, using hit-and-run tactics. The next semi-conventional offensive carried out by Mujahideen forces was the ill-fated attack on Jalalabad, which proved to be a costly failure.

Samples of dust are often collected by a device called a coniometer. Coniology refers to the observation and contemplation of dust in an atmosphere, but the study of dust may also be applied to dust in space, therefore connecting it to a variety of atmospheric and extraterrestrial topics.  Earth  Category:Atmospheric sciences A dust storm traveling from the Sahara Desert over the Atlantic Ocean Dust in Earth's atmosphere comes from both natural and anthropogenic causes. The process of which dust enters Earth's atmosphere naturally can be attributed to the Aeolian process where winds erode Earth's surface and consequently carry particles from the ground into the atmosphere via suspension, whereas anthropogenic dust may be due to human activities such as farming and creating air pollutants. The solid dust particulates and atmospheric moisture combined are suspended in the air which are both natural and anthropogenic are referred to as aerosols. The Sahara Desert is one of the biggest contributors in the creation of atmospheric dust as the winds carry and deposit dust and particulates across the planet.Middleton, N. J., and A. S. Goudie. \\"Saharan Dust: Sources and Trajectories.\\" Transactions of the Institute of British Geographers26, no. 2 (2001): 165-81. http://www.jstor.org/stable/3650666. The effect dust has on living organisms is both observed positively and negatively. The dust that is carried by wind from the Sahara desert can travel as far as the Caribbean and South America. This dust carries nutrients which further supports the ecosystems in the Caribbean, and those on the South American continent. Furthermore, nutrients in dust can carried by winds which reach all across the globe.Jickells, T. D., Z. S. An, K. K. Andersen, A. R. Baker, G. Bergametti, N. Brooks, J. J. Cao, P. W. Boyd, R. A. Duce, K. A. Hunter, H. Kawahata, N. Kubilay, J. LaRoche, P. S. Liss, N. Mahowald, J. M. Prospero, A. J. Ridgwell, I. Tegen, and R. Torres. \\"Global Iron Connections between Desert Dust, Ocean Biogeochemistry, and Climate.\\" Science 308, no. 5718 (2005): 67-71. http://www.jstor.org/stable/3841395. On the other hand, dust can also be more harmful for an ecosystem depending on what it carries. Research conducted by the senior geologist at the U.S. Geological Survey Center for Coastal Geology, Gene Shinn, revealed a correlation of decline in coral reefs with increased harmful pathogens to coral transported by dust from the Sahara to the Caribbean, coupled with an increasing global ocean temperature. Atmospheric dust, both natural and anthropogenic, has also been shown to affect humans. One of the biggest contributing factors that the effect atmospheric dust has on humans is health, more specifically respiratory health. Barbados and Trinidad have seen a rise in asthma in their population and one of the speculated causes is an influx of dust being carried over the Atlantic from the Sahara desert. Certain particulates, or particulate matter PM have led to health issues among humans such as lung disease and cardiovascular disease.  Moon  The study of dust and its effect is not only applied to the Earth, but also the Moon. One NASA mission sent a spacecraft to study the moon's atmosphere, this spacecraft was called LADEE. LADEE's mission revealed to scientist how different the moon's atmosphere is compared to the Earth, which may give insight on other celestial bodies and their atmospheric composition. The Moons atmosphere is very tenuous and creates an atmosphere with minimal dust presence. The moon can credit its thin atmosphere to solar waves that deliver hydrogen and helium to its exosphere, and gasses of argon and helium being released from the lunar rocks. Even more interesting, is the fluctuation of the moons atmospheric content in relation to the dust and elements in a given time. Of the most abundant elements in the moon's atmosphere, helium, argon and neon, will all be present but at different amounts in the atmosphere depending on where and how long the suns ray hit the moon.  Other celestial bodies  Space is known for its vast emptiness; however, there is an enormous amount of dust in space, whether it be on comets, moons, planets, or nebulae. The Herschel Space Observatory provided scientist with data about how celestial bodies formed in space, while also making new discoveries pertaining to dust in space. Dust in space, or cosmic dust create mass required for the formation of all celestial bodies like planets and stars. From the research gathered by the Herschel Space Observatory, Supernovae, or the massive explosion of a star that occurs at the end of a stars life, was the biggest contributing factor of ejecting dust and elements into space essentially creating the make up for matter in our universe. A section of the Carina Nebula When attempting to study space, cosmic dust would tend to hinder the scientists attempting to observe the celestial bodies in space. However, cosmic dust went from a hindrance, to a new and important aspect of scientific study. The Herschel Space Observatory used far reaching infrared equipment which revealed light being emitted from cosmic dust and gasses. This infrared technology allowed the Herschel Space Observatory and scientist to see more objects in space that emit heat at lower temperatures, which in turn allows more celestial bodies to be seen when they would not have been without the advanced infrared technologies. Another spacecraft that helped further our understanding of cosmic dust was the Stardust spacecraft. Stardust's mission was to collect samples of cosmic dust from the Wild-2 comet. The reason why this mission is significant is it will not only help scientist to further understand the properties of dust in space, but it was the first mission to collect dust from a comet and return it to Earth.

Photo (c) Elliot Schwartz for StudioEISStudioEIS (pronounced \\"Studio Ice\\") is a sculpture and design studio in Brooklyn, New York, United States. It specializes in classical figurative sculpture and visual storytelling with production in bronze, stone, and resin for exhibitions at cultural institutions, museums, and corporations worldwide.  History  StudioEIS was founded in 1977 by New York City natives Ivan Schwartz (BFA Boston University College of Fine Arts) and Elliot Schwartz (BFA California Institute of the Arts, MFA Yale University). It pioneered the design and production of innovative figurative sculptures for use as visual storytelling elements within museum settings during the 1970s. When the company was founded there was growing resistance to using mass-produced mannequins for museum exhibitions. StudioEIS found a niche for itself in the world of narrative storytelling for museums and with the American Bicentennial at hand and a renewed interest in American history. Numerous museums were established across the country to address topics such as African American history, civil rights, Native American history and science & technology. This confluence of talent and need created the initial impetus for StudioEIS' work. Foundry view of bronze Henry Ford for National Harbor, Maryland. Photo (c) Elliot Schwartz for StudioEIS Museums large and small began out-sourcing displays via exhibition designers, and called upon StudioEIS to create lifelike sculptures to tell stories about American culture and its political history in vivid ways that put a face to history. StudioEIS' early commissions, for the National Civil Rights Museum and the American Museum of Natural History, were figurative, life-sized, and designed to engage the museum visitor. With its growing reputation, StudioEIS began to work outside the museum world where innovative object making through visual storytelling was born. The studio now began to work with architects, industrial and scenic designers, restaurant designers & hotel and casino designers. Sony, the Bellagio Hotel and Casino in Las Vegas, Nike's flagship stores in Portland and Chicago, The Discovery Channel, and Martha Stewart Living are among its many corporate clients. StudioEIS' sculptures have been on display outside the United States in Mexico, Japan, Taiwan, Italy, Hong Kong, and Abu Dhabi. The prominence of the studio grew as it became especially well known for its bronze portrait sculptures and public works, which have included sculptures of iconic figures, such as Franklin D. Roosevelt, Elvis Presley, Albert Einstein, Frederick Douglass and 42 bronze Founding Fathers at the National Constitution Center - which may be the largest bronze sculpture project of its type in American history. To date, StudioEIS has created more significant historical sculptures than any studio in American history. The distinguished portrait sculptures created by StudioEIS are featured in important cultural institutions such as The Smithsonian's National Museum of African American History, The National WWII Museum in New Orleans, The Museum of the American Revolution in Philadelphia and The American Museum of Natural History in New York City. StudioEIS' expertise has been called upon for high-profile \\"forensic\\" reconstruction projects for George Washington's Mount Vernon Estate and Gardens, the exhibition \\"Written in Bone\\" at the National Museum of Natural History at the Smithsonian Institution and the exhibition JANE, Starvation, Cannibalism & Endurance at Jamestown for Jamestown and the Smithsonian's National Museum of Natural History. Today StudioEIS' staff of sculptors, painters, costumers, researchers, and model-makers is enhanced by specialists in wax works, metal fabrication, and bronze casting. A project will often include collaboration with scholars in anthropology, costume history, and forensic science. The sculptures of George Washington at ages 19, 45 and 57 that were unveiled at Mount Vernon in 2006 involved state-of-the-art forensic research and computer reconstruction.

The label aimed to record new material with former Motown artists. History Levine, a Motown fan since his childhood in the 1960s, was offered a chance to record Kim Weston on his Hi-NRG label Nightmare in 1987. The result Signal Your Intention topped the UK Hi-NRG charts and met with enthusiasm from Motown fans. Kim Weston brought other former Motown acts to the label, including Mary Wells (of My Guy fame), The Velvelettes and Marv Johnson. Mary Wilson of The Supremes followed next and during 1988, a full Motown reunion began to take shape. In April 1989, more than 60 artists gathered in front of the Hitsville studios in Detroit, receiving ample media coverage. Later in the year, Levine changed the label name to Motorcity Records. The various artists compilation Motorcity Magic, 1991 Joined by former Motown writers like Sylvia Moy, Johnny Bristol and Ivy Jo Hunter, Levine and his crew wrote and produced around the clock, getting the backing tapes recorded in London while vocal sessions took place in both Detroit and Los Angeles, but despite the media attention and prominent artists in the roster of the likes of Martha & The Vandellas, and former Supremes Jean Terrell, Scherrie Payne and Lynda Laurence, it proved harder than expected to get the product released. In the U.S., the record companies were reluctant to invest in artists of yesteryear. In the UK, Levine released several singles and albums, both studio albums and various artists compilations, but ran into a string of bad luck with shifting distributors (PRT, Pacific and Charly) early on. Furthermore, the records, although heavily supported by UK magazine Blues & Soul, were often criticized for having the music recorded with Fairlight synthesizers rather than using real musicians, a fact that Levine himself regretted years later. \\"The sound of these records often didn't sit well with old Motown fans that wanted to hear a live rhythm section as much as they did the outstanding unimpaired vocals of many veteran soul singers\\", former Motorcity employee Ralph Tee said. \\"At the time it meant that much of the music didn't unfortunately reach its potential\\". (Quote from The Strange World of Northern Soul box set, 2003.) Levine relentlessly continued during 1990-91 with the number of artists growing to 108 former Motown acts signed while sinking deeper into financial problems. In 1991, however, Motorcity had a hit single with \\"Footsteps Following Me\\" - performed, ironically, by one of the least known artists, Frances Nero, which made it to No. 17 in the UK Singles Chart. Her dream was short-lived: after recording constantly and receiving no royalties from Levine, she severed her relationship and pursued other ventures. Still most releases continued to sell disappointingly: \\"Some of the Motorcity albums sold less than a thousand copies each\\", Levine revealed in an interview in Manifesto magazine in September 2007 as a response to later royalty disputes with some of the artists who claimed not to have been paid. After a deal with Total/BMG, everything began to fall apart during 1992. After a final single \\"Darling Darling Baby\\" (MOTC 114) with Edwin Starr, it was all over, Levine close to being declared bankrupt. By that time, a total of 770 songs had been recorded. Levine managed to get a US deal with Miami-based Hot Productions which began releasing a Motorcity anthology plus Best of compilations by the artists and succeeded in getting much of the previously unreleased material out. 20 Best of Motorcity Records volumes were released over the years 1993-96 and 30 more had been planned to follow during 1997-98, including 80 new tracks Levine would record with Pat Lewis and Brenda Holloway during those years. Hot Productions, however, closed down towards the end of 1997 before all 50 volumes had been released. Levine's Motorcity recordings continue to be released on various compilations, and Levine himself has recorded new backing tracks for more than 120 of the songs to create a more authentic sound. Songs like Ronnie McNeir's \\"Lucky Number\\", Carolyn Crawford's \\"Timeless\\" and The Elgins' \\"Don't Wait Around\\" have since received more praise on the UK soul scene than the first time round. The fact remains that a lot of these artists were recorded for the last time, many of them have since died - including Mary Wells, Herman Griffin, David Ruffin, Hattie Littles, Saundra Edwards of The Elgins, Edwin Starr, Joe Stubbs and many more. Levine was also instrumental with the several successful multi-artist package tours, similar in style and format to the 1960s Motortown Revue. A month-long tour in November 1990 featured The Elgins, Kim Weston, Syreeta, Carolyn Crawford, Marv Johnson and was headlined by Jean, Scherrie & Lynda of The Supremes. The final night of the tour was videotaped and released the following year as The Legends of Motorcity USA on two videos. A three-disc DVD box set with 100 videos from the Motorcity era titled Don't Forget the Motorcity, was released in November 2007.

Traditionally, the bride's parents host the engagement party, but many modern couples host their own celebration. History Originally, engagement parties had the appearance of normal parties at which the father of the bride-to-be made a surprise announcement of the engagement to his guests. The engagement party had the purpose of sharing the engagement news with family members and friends. Therefore, it was not a traditional gift-giving occasion, as none of the guests were supposed to be aware of the engagement until after their arrival. In ancient Greece, an engagement party was a commercial transaction. It was essentially an oral contract, made between the man who gave the woman in marriage (usually her father) and the groom.A perfect union? Marriage has seen many makeovers, Hartford Courant, Ron Grossman, February 29, 2004 The bride was not present. A Jewish engagement party is known as a vort ().https://www.chabad.org/library/article_cdo/aid/4108758/jewish/What-Does- Vort-Mean.htm Breaking a ceramic plate at a vort is customary, symbolizing the permanence of marriage and mirroring the breaking of a glass at a Jewish wedding. In the Scottish Gaelic tradition, a r√®iteach was a betrothal ritual which typically ended in a dance party for the whole community. =Modern times= In modern times, an engagement party may celebrate a previously publicized engagement. It is a party like any other, except that usually toasts or speeches are made to announce the upcoming wedding. While it varies, an engagement party takes place at the beginning of the process of planning a wedding. It is often thrown at the couple's home or at the home of a close friend or relative of the couple. Gifts are never obligatory, and if one is brought, it should be small and less expensive than a typical wedding gift. In the United States, engagement parties are currently a more common practice in the Northeast, particularly in the New York area, though they are becoming more common in the Southeast as well. In most other parts of the country relatively few couples have them. Unlike publishing the banns of marriage, an engagement party has never been required. In Africa, what is now known as an engagement party may in fact be the last remnant of the traditional, pre- colonial marriage ceremony itself. Such is the case with the Yoruba people and their bride-price rites and the Nguni people and their lobola practices.

Charles Perrault retold this fairy tale in 1697 as The Sleeping Beauty, as did the Brothers Grimm in 1812 as Little Briar Rose. It is Aarne-Thompson type 410; other tales of this type include The Glass Coffin and The Young Slave.Heidi Anne Heiner, \\"Tales Similar to Sleeping Beauty\\" Synopsis After the birth of a great lord's daughter, Talia, wise men and astrologers cast the child's horoscope and predicted that Talia would be endangered by a splinter of flax. To protect his daughter, the father commands that no flax would ever be brought into his house. Years later, Talia sees an old woman spinning flax on a spindle. She asks the woman if she can stretch the flax herself, but as soon as she begins to spin, a splinter of flax goes under her fingernail, and she drops to the ground, apparently dead. Unable to stand the thought of burying his child, Talia's father puts his daughter in one of his country estates. Some time later, a king who is out hunting in the nearby woods, follows his falconfalcon symbolic meaning into the house. He finds Talia; overcome by her beauty, he tries unsuccessfully to wake her, and then rapes her. He lifted her in his arms, and carried her to a bed, where he gathered the first fruits of love.\\" Afterwards, he leaves the girl on her bed and returns to his own city. Still deep in sleep, nine months after the incident, Talia becomes pregnant and gives birth to twins, (a boy and a girl). One day, the girl cannot find her mother's breast; instead she begins to suck on Talia's finger and draws the flax splinter out. Talia awakens immediately and names her beloved children Sun and Moon, and lives with them in the house. The king returns and to find Talia awake and that he is the father to her twins. The two fall in love, however the king is already married, and one night he calls out the names of Talia, Sun, and Moon in his sleep. His wife, the queen, hears him and she forces the king's secretary to tell her everything, and then, using a forged message, has Talia's children brought to court. She orders the cook to kill the children and serve them to the king. But the cook hides them, rather cooking two lambs instead. The queen taunts the king while he eats the meal, unaware of the cook's exchange. Then, the queen brings Talia to court. She commands that a huge fire be lit in the courtyard, and that Talia be thrown into the flames. Talia asks to take off her fine garments first. The queen agrees. Talia undresses and utters screams of grief with each piece of clothing. The king hears Talia's screams and goes to her, where his wife tells him that Talia will be burned and that he has unknowingly eaten his own children. The king commands that his wife, his secretary, and the cook be thrown into the fire instead. But, the cook explains how he had saved Sun and Moon, and fed the King two lambs instead. Talia and the king marry, and the cook is rewarded with the title of royal chamberlain.

Details concerning his life and death are uncertain and of questionable historicity, and his Acta actually date from around the sixth century.San Severo Legend Sant Cugat According to his legend, he was born in Barcelona to a noble family and received a good education. In a hymn associated with his office, it is stated explicitly that he was a citizen of Barcelona. A variant of the legend status that he was a humble weaver upon whose head a dove landed. The people of the city saw this as a sign and elected him bishop.6 de noviembre He was chosen bishop of Barcelona around 290. During the persecution of Diocletian, Severus fled to Castrum Octavianum (Sant Cugat), where he encountered a fellow Christian, named Emeterius (, ),Not to be confused with another Saint Emeterius, who was martyred with Celedonius sowing beans in the field. Severus instructed the man that if the soldiers sent to kill him asked the farmer where he had gone, to tell them that he had passed this way.Rincones_del_mundo A miracle made the beans he was cultivating sprout immediately after Severus left. When the soldiers came across Emeterius and asked him if he had seen the bishop, Emeterius replied that he had and it was when he was sowing the fields. Angry at this lie and believing that Emeterius was mocking them, the soldiers arrested the man and took him to Castrum Octavianum. Severus meanwhile appeared to the soldiers, along with four other priests from Barcelona who had fled with him. The four priests were flogged and then killed with a sword. Emeterius also suffered this fate. Severus was beaten with a cat o' nine tails, and nails were driven into his head. The soldiers left the bishop on the ground. However, he did not die and when Christians from Barcelona heard that Severus was still alive, they attempted to revive him. However, he died in the arms of one of them. Veneration Altar of Saint Severus. Cathedral of Barcelona. Francesc Santacruz. Some sources state that Severus' relics were buried at Sant Cugat, where a church dedicated to him was built. A monastery, the one that stands there today, was built alongside the church. When that church was destroyed, Severus‚Äô relics were translated to the monastery. In the fifteenth century, some of the relics were taken to Barcelona, to which were attributed various miracles, including curing King Martin I of gangrene in his leg. Saint Peter Nolasco and Ferdinand I were also devoted to his cult. The Baroque church of Sant Sever, near the Cathedral of Barcelona, was dedicated to him. The hermitage of Sant Medir, near Sant Cugat, is dedicated to Emeterius.

The basis of photothermal spectroscopy is the change in thermal state of the sample resulting from the absorption of radiation. Light absorbed and not lost by emission results in heating. The heat raises temperature thereby influencing the thermodynamic properties of the sample or of a suitable material adjacent to it. Measurement of the temperature, pressure, or density changes that occur due to optical absorption are ultimately the basis for the photothermal spectroscopic measurements. As with photoacoustic spectroscopy, photothermal spectroscopy is an indirect method for measuring optical absorption, because it is not based on the direct measure of the light which is involved in the absorption. In another sense, however, photothermal (and photoacoustic) methods measure directly the absorption, rather than e.g. calculate it from the transmission, as is the case of more usual (transmission) spectroscopic techniques. And it is this fact that gives the technique its high sensitivity, because in transmission techniques the absorbance is calculated as the difference between total light impinging on the sample and the transmitted (plus reflected, plus scattered) light, with the usual problems of accuracy when one deals with small differences between large numbers, if the absorption is small. In photothermal spectroscopies, instead, the signal is essentially proportional to the absorption, and is zero when there is zero true absorption, even in the presence of reflection or scattering. There are several methods and techniques used in photothermal spectroscopy. Each of these has a name indicating the specific physical effect measured. * Photothermal lens spectroscopy (PTS or TLS) measures the thermal blooming that occurs when a beam of light heats a transparent sample. It is typically applied for measuring minute quantities of substances in homogeneous gas and liquid solutions. * Photothermal deflection spectroscopy (PDS), also called the mirage effect, measures the bending of light due to optical absorption. This technique is particularly useful for measuring surface absorption and for profiling thermal properties in layered materials. * Photothermal diffraction, a type of four wave mixing, monitors the effect of transient diffraction gratings \\"written\\" into the sample with coherent lasers. It is a form of real-time holography. * Photothermal emission measures an increase in sample infrared radiance occurring as a consequence of absorption. Sample emission follows Stefan's law of thermal emission. This methods is used to measure the thermal properties of solids and layered materials. * Photothermal single particle microscopy. This technique allows the detection of single absorbing nanoparticles via the creation of a spherically symmetric thermal lens for imaging and correlation spectroscopy. Photothermal deflection spectroscopy Photothermal deflection spectroscopy is a kind of spectroscopy that measures the change in refractive index due to heating of a medium by light. It works via a sort of \\"mirage effect\\"In the true mirage, however, a light ray is bent gradually until it is totally reflected by the very hot air near soil. Here, instead, there is no reflection, and the ray is bent in a smooth way by the refraction index gradient, which acts like a prism. where a refractive index gradient exists adjacent to the test sample surface. A probe laser beam is refracted or bent in a manner proportional to the temperature gradient of the transparent medium near the surface. From this deflection, a measure of the absorbed excitation radiation can be determined. The technique is useful when studying optically thin samples, because sensitive measurements can be obtained of whether absorption is occurring. It is of value in situations where \\"pass through\\" or transmission spectroscopy can't be used. There are two main forms of PDS: Collinear and Transverse. Collinear PDS was introduced in a 1980 paper by A.C. Boccara, D. Fournier, et al. In collinear, two beams pass through and intersect in a medium. The pump beam heats the material and the probe beam is deflected. This technique only works for transparent media. In transverse, the probe beam heats come in normal to the surface, and the probe beam passes parallel. In a variation on this, the probe beam may reflect off the surface, and measure buckling due to heating. Transverse PDS can be done in Nitrogen, but better performance is gained in a liquid cell: usually an inert, non-absorbing material such as a perfluorocarbon is used. In both collinear and transverse PDS, the surface is heated using a periodically modulated light source, such as an optical beam passing through a mechanical chopper or regulated with a function generator. A lock-in amplifier is then used to measure deflections found at the modulation frequency. Another scheme uses a pulsed laser as the excitation source. In that case, a boxcar average can be used to measure the temporal deflection of the probe beam to the excitation radiation. The signal falls off exponentially as a function of frequency, so frequencies around 1-10 hertz are frequently used. A full theoretical analysis of the PDS system was published by Jackson, Amer, et al. in 1981. The same paper also discussed the use of PDS as a form of microscopy, called \\"Photothermal Deflection Microscopy\\", which can yield information about impurities and the surface topology of materials. PDS analysis of thin films can also be performed using a patterned substrate that supports optical resonances, such as guided-mode resonance and whispering- gallery modes. The probe beam is coupled into a resonant mode and the coupling efficiency is highly sensitive to the incidence angle. Due to the photoheating effect, the coupling efficiency is changed and characterized to indicate the thin film absorption.

Early life and education A native of Richmond, McCollum graduated in 1973 from Huguenot High School. McCollum graduated from historically-black Howard University with a B.A. in economics in 1978. Later on, he received his Juris Doctor from the University of Maryland School of Law; he was admitted to the state bar in 1991. Political career McCollum was first elected to the Richmond City Council in 1996. The councilman for the Fifth District, he represented the central-most portion of the city. After a three-year stint as Vice Mayor, it was announced in late 2001 that he would replace the outgoing Mayor, Tim Kaine, who was elected Lieutenant Governor in the November general election. McCollum was sworn in as the 77th Mayor of Richmond on September 11, 2001. He was the last mayor of Richmond to be appointed by the nine-member city council before a 2004 voter-approved referendum which adopted the mayor-at-large form of government. Under this new system, the mayor is not appointed but rather elected by popular vote. Opting to run for a second term, McCollum received an extremely low percentage of the vote, losing to former Governor L. Douglas Wilder by a margin of over 60 percent. Despite this, approval of McCollum was still fairly high when he left office. Many attribute his loss to a combination of his lack of campaigning and Wilder's reputation. Post- mayoralty McCollum has held a number of positions since his failed reelection bid. In 2006, he established his own law firm, where he currently practices bankruptcy and divorce law. Until 2011, he was a member of the Virginia Parole Board. Asked about possibly reentering politics, he said, \\"My main priority right now is to get my kids out of my house and prepare them for the world that they are going to have to live in.

MacHale. It was published on May 20, 2008. Plot The book begins with separate narratives focusing on Patrick Mac and Alder, the Travelers of Third Earth and Denduron respectively. It follows the changes in their home territories and their realization that they are without Bobby Pendragon. On Denduron, the Bedoowan and Milago tribe are using the explosive tak that Bobby unearthed with a from Zadaa to start a war with a neighboring tribe, the Lowsee tribe. On Third Earth, the once Utopian planet has morphed into a waste world. Bobby Pendragon, meanwhile, has been living comfortably on Ibara, the island community located on Veelox. Pendragon's own description states that he has been a contributor and leader of the rebuilding of Ibara, which was destroyed in the previous book by Saint Dane's Dimond Alpha Digital Organization D.A.D.O.army. Days after an unsettling conversation with Saint Dane, Pendragon encounters a drifting skimmer bearing a dying passenger on board (this passenger being Loque, one of the Jakills from The Pilgrims of Rayne who amazingly survived having a large amount of broken glass fall on him and slaving underneath Saint Dane while trying to dig up the flume in Rubic City along with the other Flighters). After hearing Loque's story, Bobby assumes that Saint Dane is after the flume and decides to prevent the flume from being reopened. He fails, and later discovers that Nevva Winter, Saint Dane's ally, has been living on Ibara disguised as Tribune Genj's daughter, Telleo, whom she killed months before. Hearing from her that Denduron is in danger, Bobby reluctantly sets out to rescue it. Emerging onto Denduron, Pendragon is nearly killed by a quig, later to be healed by Alder, whom he rescues from prison. Later, after failing to reseal the newly opened tak mine, the two of them realize that the territory is lost; therefore they travel to Second Earth to battle Saint Dane. On First Earth (1937) Mark and Courtney find that they have failed to prevent Mark's inventions from altering Earth's history. Mark is then black-mailed into giving up his Traveler ring to Nevva. They then head to the flume only to be intercepted by Patrick who came to First Earth in search of Bobby after realizing he couldn't save Third Earth alone. Mark and Courtney then return to Second Earth with Patrick in tow. Upon arriving they find that many people are worshiping a new cult, Ravinia, and both flumes have been revealed by Alexander Naymeer who is the leader of Ravinia and the \\"new\\" traveler of Second Earth as Bobby has quit. He is using the ring Nevva took from Mark. The goal of Ravinia is to reward the people who contribute to society, while punishing those who do not. Mark, Courtney, and Patrick head to the other flume to get off of Second Earth only to be intercepted by Naymeer. A chase ensues and Patrick narrowly gets away but not before being shot. Mark and Courtney are captured and brought to Naymeer's home which happens to be on top of one of the flumes, in the Sherwood house. A mortally wounded Patrick arrives on Denduron just as Alder and Bobby are about to leave. They heal him and send him back to Third Earth to find out what a possible Second Earth turning point could be. They then head to Second Earth to find Mark and Courtney. Bobby comes out in the flume below Naymeer's house. Just before Bobby arrives, Naymeer tells Mark and Courtney that the flumes and Traveler rings are made of dark matter. Bobby, Alder, Mark, and Courtney all talk with Naymeer who tells them he can't be stopped. They disagree and escape to Courtney's family's boat where they all decide that a vote to nominate Ravinia as \\"spiritual advisor\\" to the entire world is the turning point of Second Earth. Courtney's parents then show up with the cops. Another chase ensues and Mark and Courtney are captured but Bobby and Alder escape and take refuge with the main protester of Ravinia, Haig Gastigian. Patrick, on Third Earth, learns that the destruction there has begun with a mostly forgotten event known as the Bronx Massacre. He is killed while trying to convey word of this, but succeeds in telling Bobby about the event by sending him a message through his ring. Bobby and Alder witness what they think is the Bronx Massacre when Naymeer sends 12 people, including Mark and Courtney, into the flume to an unknown destination. Bobby and Alder later hear from Haig Gastigian, that he is holding a rally of 70,000 people in Yankee Stadium. At the rally the UN's vote is revealed to favor Ravinia, whereupon the 70,000 protesters gathered in Yankee Stadium are pulled into a giant flume which Naymeer creates, causing the true Bronx Massacre. Alder tries to stop him, but is killed in the process. Bobby is brought to a helicopter and flown above the stadium to witness everyone's deaths. It is revealed that Haig Gastigian was really Nevva who lured all the people to the stadium. Realizing this, Bobby throws Naymeer into the flume. At this, Saint Dane claims victory because Bobby had stooped to his level and failed his last test. Naymeer, falling into the flume, causes a beam of light to strike the helicopter. It spins out of control and falls into the flume. Saint Dane and Nevva escape and later tell the Conclave of Ravinia, the head of Ravinia, that Naymeer is dead but that Nevva is trained to take his place. Bobby then finds himself in space, looking down at the flumes, and watches them explode. He wakes up in the middle of an oblivious landscape, where he is confronted by his Uncle Press and the other nine travelers of his generation, both dead and alive. Uncle Press says that now is the right time to kill Saint Dane, since he believes that he has won. He also says that it is time for the current Travelers to learn the truth about themselves. The Travelers decide to finish the fight with Saint Dane, once and for all.

It was revived in 2009 as a titular see of the Roman Catholic Church.  History  The city now called Orange in southern France was called Arausio in Roman times. It had been founded as a retirement colony for veterans of the Roman Army who had served under Augustus during his campaigns against Marc Antony. It became the seat of a bishop very probably towards the end of the 3rd century: at the Synod of Arles in 314, its bishop was represented by a priest named Faustinus. The first bishop of Arausio whose name is given in extant documents was Constantius, who took part in the Council of Aquileia, 381.Only two bishops from Gaul were brave enough to participate: Constantius of Orange and Proculus of Marseille: J. D. Mansi, Sacrorum Conciliorum nova et amplissima collectio III editio novissima (Florence 1759), pp. 599-601; 615. From the early 5th century, the see was a suffragan of the metropolitan see of Arles. Arausio hosted two important synods, in 441J. D. Mansi (ed.), Sacrorum Conciliorum nova et amplissima collectio editio novissima Tomus VI (Florence 1762), pp. 433-452. and 529.J. D. Mansi (ed.), Sacrorum Conciliorum nova et amplissima collectio editio novissima Tomus VIII (Florence 1762), pp. 711-724. The Second Council of Orange was of importance for its condemnation of what later came to be called Semipelagianism. In 1516 Francis I of France ordered the union of the principality of Orange and the Dauphin√©, the accomplishment of which was ordered by the Parliament of Grenoble in March 1517. This union made the Bishop of Orange subject as far as his temporal rights were concerned to the king of France. On 8 August 1520, King Francis granted Bishop Guillaume P√©lissier an extra six months to make his submission to the Chambre des comptes of the Dauphin√©. In accordance with the Concordat of 1801, Pope Pius VII attached the territory of the diocese to the archdiocese of Avignon by the papal bull Qui Christi Domini of 29 November 1801. In 1817, after the fall of the Emperor Bonaparte and the return of the Bourbon monarchy, it was planned to restore the residential status of the bishopric in accordance with a new concordat, but the French parliament refused to ratify the concordat. The ancient see of Arausio, therefore, is no longer a residential bishopric. In January 2009 Pope Benedict XVI revived the title for use as a titular see,David M.

The player spaceship moves along the bottom of a grid, attempting to shoot enemy spaceships to go to the next level.  Gameplay  Proof of Destruction has a unique way of player movement and strategy, but has simple enemy AI. It consists of various levels where in each level the objective is to kill a fixed number of spaceships that come into the grid. Points are gained for every enemy kill. There is an overall time limit to the game and the objective is to obtain as many points as possible within that time limit, with the user trying to finish off each level as quickly as possible. = Movement = A player spaceship(s) can move freely horizontally and vertically on a fixed grid that fills the whole screen, using the keyboard or a joystick. The grid, however, gets damaged by enemy bullets which prevent the player from moving over them during a short period of time. Several types of enemies exist and each one moves in a distinct way. In the basic levels, enemies usually enter from the top of the grid and move horizontally, lowering one line at a time when they reach the side of the grid and reversing their direction, slowly closing in on to the player spaceship. Further on, other types of enemies are introduced that choose the shortest past towards the player, although moving much slower, and other enemies that enter the grid rapidly from the left and the right and disappear back of the grid as quickly as they came. = Attack = A player spaceship can fire off bullets only in one direction, namely upwards, trying to destroy its enemies. Those enemies fire off bullets in all directions, usually aimed at either one of the players. Enemy bullets depend on the type of enemy and can range from simple downward bullets to bullets that cross the grid in any direction. = Level completion = Each level had the same sized grid with the player spaceships starting at the bottom of the grid and a number of enemy spaceships entering from different sides of the grid, depending on the level and on the enemy type. Completion of a level is reached when a timer has finished counting down. After the completion of a level, the player receives an extra life, up to a maximum of five. = Multiplayer = At the start of the game, it is possible to choose between one or two players. Both players move independently on the grid and cannot hit nor block each other. If one player loses all of their lives, the other one can continue.

Function  This enzyme participates in nicotinate and nicotinamide metabolism. NNMT affects a biochemical mechanism known as a futile cycle, which plays a role in metabolic regulation. NNMT is found in human fat cells and the liver. NNMT processes vitamin B3 and has been linked with certain types of cancer. Silencing the gene that codes for NNMT reduces its presence and increases the presence of sugar transporter GLUT4. Mice that produced large amounts of GLUT4 were insulin sensitive and protected against diabetes, while mice with no GLUT4 were insulin resistant and at risk. High levels of NNMT are often found in the fat cells of animals that are insulin resistant. When the researchers silenced the NNMT gene in mice on high-fat diets, the mice gained less weight than those in whom the NNMT gene was functioning normally. (The mice did not change their eating or exercise habits). Antisense oligonucleotide (ASO) technology can be used to silence the expression of the NNMT gene only in fat and liver cells. ASOs are short strings of DNA that can be designed to prevent the synthesis of specific proteins. ASOs have been approved for use by the U.S. Food and Drug Administration for the treatment of conditions with other genetic causes‚Äîsuch as elevated cholesterol and hyperlipidemia.

As a member of the heat shock protein 70 family and a chaperone protein, it facilitates the proper folding of newly translated and misfolded proteins, as well as stabilize or degrade mutant proteins. In addition, Hsp72 also facilitates DNA repair. Its functions contribute to biological processes including signal transduction, apoptosis, protein homeostasis, and cell growth and differentiation. It has been associated with an extensive number of cancers, neurodegenerative diseases, cell senescence and aging, and inflammatory diseases such as Diabetes mellitus type 2 and rheumatoid arthritis.  Structure  This intronless gene encodes a 70kDa heat shock protein which is a member of the heat shock protein 70 (Hsp70) family. As a Hsp70 protein, it has a C-terminal protein substrate-binding domain and an N-terminal ATP-binding domain. The substrate-binding domain consists of two subdomains, a two-layered Œ≤-sandwich subdomain (SBDŒ≤) and an Œ±-helical subdomain (SBDŒ±), which are connected by the loop LŒ±,Œ≤. SBDŒ≤ contains the peptide binding pocket while SBDŒ± serves as a lid to cover the substrate binding cleft. The ATP binding domain consists of four subdomains split into two lobes by a central ATP/ADP binding pocket. The two terminal domains are linked together by a conserved region referred to as loop LL,1, which is critical for allosteric regulation. The unstructured region at the very end of the C-terminal is believed to be the docking site for co- chaperones.  Function  This protein is a member of the Hsp70 family. In conjunction with other heat shock proteins, this protein stabilizes existing proteins against aggregation and mediates the folding of newly translated proteins in the cytosol and in organelles. In order to properly fold non- native proteins, this protein interacts with the hydrophobic peptide segments of proteins in an ATP-controlled fashion. Though the exact mechanism still remains unclear, there are at least two alternative modes of action: kinetic partitioning and local unfolding. In kinetic partitioning, Hsp70s repetitively bind and release substrates in cycles that maintain low concentrations of free substrate. This effectively prevents aggregation while allowing free molecules to fold to the native state. In local unfolding, the binding and release cycles induce localized unfolding in the substrate, which helps to overcome kinetic barriers for folding to the native state. Ultimately, its role in protein folding contributes to its function in signal transduction, apoptosis, protein homeostasis, and cell growth and differentiation. In addition to the process of protein folding, transport and degradation, this Hsp70 member can preserve the function of mutant proteins. Nonetheless, effects of these mutations can still manifest when Hsp70 chaperones are overwhelmed during stress conditions. Hsp72 also protects against DNA damage and participates in DNA repair, including base excision repair (BER) and nucleotide excision repair (NER). Furthermore, this protein enhances antigen-specific tumor immunity by facilitating more efficient antigen presentation to cytotoxic T cells. It is also involved in the ubiquitin-proteasome pathway through interaction with the AU-rich element RNA-binding protein 1. The gene is located in the major histocompatibility complex class III region, in a cluster with two closely related genes which encode similar proteins. Finally, Hsp72 can protect against disrupted metabolic homeostasis by inducing production of pro-inflammatory cytokines, tumor necrosis factor-Œ±, interleukin 1Œ≤, and interleukin-6 in immune cells, thereby reducing inflammation and improving skeletal muscle oxidation. Though at very low levels under normal conditions, HSP72 expression greatly increases under stress, effectively protecting cells from adverse effects in various pathological states. Along with its role in DNA repair, Hsp72 is also directly involved in caspase-dependent apoptosis by binding Apaf-1, thereby inhibiting procaspase-9 activation and release of cytochrome c. Additionally, Hsp72 has been observed to inhibit apoptosis by preventing the release of SMAC/Diablo and binding XIAP to prevent its degradation. Hsp72 is also involved in caspase-independent apoptosis, as it also binds AIFM1. Clinical significance The Hsp70 member proteins are important apoptotic constituents. During a normal embryologic processes, or during cell injury (such as ischemia-reperfusion injury during heart attacks and strokes) or during developments and processes in cancer, an apoptotic cell undergoes structural changes including cell shrinkage, plasma membrane blebbing, nuclear condensation, and fragmentation of the DNA and nucleus. This is followed by fragmentation into apoptotic bodies that are quickly removed by phagocytes, thereby preventing an inflammatory response. It is a mode of cell death defined by characteristic morphological, biochemical and molecular changes. It was first described as a \\"shrinkage necrosis\\", and then this term was replaced by apoptosis to emphasize its role opposite mitosis in tissue kinetics. In later stages of apoptosis the entire cell becomes fragmented, forming a number of plasma membrane-bounded apoptotic bodies which contain nuclear and or cytoplasmic elements. The ultrastructural appearance of necrosis is quite different, the main features being mitochondrial swelling, plasma membrane breakdown and cellular disintegration. Apoptosis occurs in many physiological and pathological processes. It plays an important role during embryonal development as programmed cell death and accompanies a variety of normal involutional processes in which it serves as a mechanism to remove \\"unwanted\\" cells. Hsp70 member proteins, including Hsp72, inhibit apoptosis by acting on the caspase-dependent pathway and against apoptosis- inducing agents such as tumor necrosis factor-Œ± (TNFŒ±), staurosporine, and doxorubicin. This role leads to its involvement in many pathological processes, such as oncogenesis, neurodegeneration, and senescence. In particular, overexpression of HSP72 has been linked to the development some cancers, such as hepatocellular carcinoma, gastric cancers, colon cancers, breast cancers, and lung cancers, which led to its use as a prognostic marker for these cancers. Elevated Hsp70 levels in tumor cells may increase malignancy and resistance to therapy by complexing, and hence, stabilizing, oncofetal proteins and products and transporting them into intracellular sites, thereby promoting tumor cell proliferation. As a result, tumor vaccine strategies for Hsp70s have been highly successful in animal models and progressed to clinical trials. One treatment, a Hsp72/AFP recombined vaccine, elicited robust protective immunity against AFP-expressing tumors in mice experiments. Therefore, the vaccine holds promise for treating hepatocellular carcinoma. Alternatively, overexpression of Hsp70 can mitigate damage from ischemia-reperfusion in cardiac muscle, as well damage from neurodegenerative diseases, such as Alzheimer‚Äôs disease, Parkinson‚Äôs disease, Huntington‚Äôs disease, and spinocerebellar ataxias, and aging and cell senescence, as observed in centenarians subjected to heat shock challenge. In Diabetes mellitus type 2 (T2DM), a small molecule activator of Hsp72 named BGP-15 has been shown to improve insulin sensitivity and inflammation in an insulin- resistant mouse model, increase mitochondrial volume, and improve metabolic homeostasis in a rat model of T2DM. BGP-15 has now proceeded to Phase 2b clinical trials and demonstrated no side-effects thus far. Though early speculation considered that Hsp72 expression might be affecting insulin sensitivity through a direct interaction with GLUT4, studies were unable to verify this link. Experiments did reveal that Hsp72 improved insulin sensitivity through stimulating glucose uptake during a hyperinsulemic- euglycemic clamp in T2DM patients. Additionally, Hsp72 has been associated with another inflammatory condition, rheumatoid arthritis, and could be implemented to help diagnose and monitor disease activity in patients.

It is ostensibly the narrative of a boat trip from Concord, Massachusetts to Concord, New Hampshire, and back, that Thoreau took with his brother John in 1839. John died of tetanus in 1842 and Thoreau wrote the book, in part, as a tribute to his memory. Background The book's first draft was completed while Thoreau was living at Walden Pond (1845‚Äì47). He was unable to find a publisher, however, and therefore had it published at his own expense. Few copies sold and he was left with several hundred extras and went into debt. A slightly revised version of A Week, based on corrections Thoreau had made himself, was published in 1868, six years after his death. Content While the book may appear to be a travel journal, broken up into chapters for each day, this is deceptive. The actual trip took two weeks and while given passages are a literal description of the journey ‚Äî from Concord, Massachusetts, down the Concord River to the Middlesex Canal, to the Merrimack River, up to Concord, New Hampshire, and back ‚Äî much of the text is in the form of digressions by the Harvard-educated author on diverse topics such as religion, poetry, and history. Thoreau relates these topics to his own life experiences, often in the context of the rapid changes taking place in his native New England during the Industrial Revolution, changes that Thoreau often laments. Reception Influence The French composer Robert Pi√©chaud (born 1969) wrote The River (2016), a wind quintet which freely follows Thoreau's work. An additional voice part is found in the last movement, setting All Things Are Current Found, the last poem of the book. John McPhee recreated Thoreau's journey in a canoe starting 31 August 2003, and wrote about it in \\"Paddling After Henry David Thoreau\\" [].

Phosphatidylethanolamine N-methyltransferase (abbreviated PEMT) is a transferase enzyme () which converts phosphatidylethanolamine (PE) to phosphatidylcholine (PC) in the liver. In humans it is encoded by the PEMT gene within the Smith‚ÄìMagenis syndrome region on chromosome 17. While the CDP-choline pathway, in which choline obtained either by dietary consumption or by metabolism of choline-containing lipids is converted to PC, accounts for approximately 70% of PC biosynthesis in the liver, the PEMT pathway has been shown to have played a critical evolutionary role in providing PC during times of starvation. Furthermore, PC made via PEMT plays a wide range of physiological roles, utilized in choline synthesis, hepatocyte membrane structure, bile secretion, and very low-density lipoprotein (VLDL) secretion.  Nomenclature  Phosphatidylethanolamine N-methyltransferase is also known as lipid methyl transferase, LMTase, phosphatidylethanolamine methyltransferase, phosphatidylethanolamine-N- methylase, and phosphatidylethanolamine-S-adenosylmethionine- methyltransferase.  Function  The PEMT enzyme converts phosphatidylethanolamine (PE) to phosphatidylcholine (PC) via three sequential methylations by S-adenosyl methionine (SAM). The enzyme is found in endoplasmic reticulum and mitochondria-associated membranes. It accounts for ~30% of PC biosynthesis, with the CDP-choline, or Kennedy, pathway making ~70%. PC, typically the most abundant phospholipid in animals and plants, accounts for more than half of cell membrane phospholipids and approximately 30% of all cellular lipid content. The PEMT pathway is therefore crucial for maintaining membrane integrity. PC made via the PEMT pathway can be degraded by phospholipases C/D, resulting in the de novo formation of choline. Thus, the PEMT pathway contributes to maintaining brain and liver function and larger-scale energy metabolism in the body. PC molecules produced by PEMT- catalyzed methylation of PE are more diverse, and tend to contain longer chain, polyunsaturated species and more arachidonate, whereas those produced via the CDP-choline pathway are typically composed of medium-length, saturated chains. A major pathway for hepatic PC utilization is secretion of bile into the intestine. PEMT activity also dictates normal very low-density lipoprotein (VLDL) secretion by the liver. PEMT is also a significant source and regulator of plasma homocysteine, which can be secreted or converted to methionine or cysteine.  Mechanism  The exact mechanism by which PEMT catalyzes the sequential methylation of PE by three molecules of SAM to form PC remains unknown. Kinetic analyses as well as amino acid and gene sequencing have shed some light on how the enzyme works. Studies suggest that a single substrate binding site binds all three phospholipids methylated by PEMT: PE, phosphatidyl-monomethylethanolamine (PMME) and phosphatidyl- dimethylethanolamine. The first methylation, that of PE to PMME, has been shown to be the rate-limiting step in conversion of PE to PC. It is suspected that the structure or specific conformation adopted by PE has a lower affinity for the PEMT active site; consequently, upon methylation, PMME would be immediately converted to PDME and PDME to PC, via a Bi-Bi or ping-pong mechanism before another PE molecule could enter the active site.  Structure  Purification of PEMT by Neale D. Ridgway and Dennis E. Vance in 1987 produced an 18.3 kDa protein. Subsequent cloning, sequencing, and expression of PEMT cDNA resulted in a 22.3 kDa, 199-amino acid protein. Although the enzymatic structure is unknown, PEMT is proposed to contain four hydrophobic membrane-spanning regions, with both its C and N termini on the cytosolic side of the ER membrane. Kinetic studies indicate a common binding site for PE, PMME, and PDME substrates. SAM binding motifs have been identified on both the third and fourth transmembrane sequences. Site-directed mutagenesis has pinpointed the residues Gly98, Gly100, Glu180, and Glu181 to be essential for SAM binding in the active site.  Regulation  PEMT activity is unrelated to enzyme mass, but rather is regulated by supply of substrates including PE, as well as PMME, PDME, and SAM. Low substrate levels inhibit PEMT. The enzyme is further regulated by S-adenosylhomocysteine produced after each methylation. PEMT gene expression is regulated by transcription factors including activator protein 1 (AP-1) and Sp1. Sp1 is a negative regulator of PEMT transcription, yet is it is a positive regulator of choline-phosphate cytidylyltransferase (CT) transcription. This is one of several examples of the reciprocal regulation of PEMT and CT in the PEMT and CDP-choline pathways. Estrogen has also been shown to be a positive regulator of hepatocyte PEMT transcription. Ablation of the estrogen binding site in the PEMT promoter region may increase risk of hepatic steatosis from choline deficiency. Disease relevance Overview of biological roles and regulation of phosphatidylethanolamine N-methyltransferase (PEMT) =Liver= PEMT deficiency in mice, genetically induced by PEMT gene knockout, produced minimal effect on PE and PC levels. However, upon being fed a choline-deficient diet, the mice developed severe liver failure. Rapid PC depletion due to biliary PC secretion, as well as protein leakage from loss of membrane integrity due to lowered PC/PE ratios, led to steatosis and steatohepatitis. A Val-to-Met substitution at residue 175, leading to reduced PEMT activity, has been linked to non-alcoholic fatty liver disease. This substitution has also been linked to increased frequency of non-alcoholic steatohepatitis. A single-nucleotide polymorphism (G to C) in the promoter region of the PEMT has been demonstrated to contribute to development of organ dysfunction in conjunction with a low-choline diet. =Cardiovascular disease and atherosclerosis= PEMT modulates levels of blood plasma homocysteine, which is either secreted or converted to methionine or cysteine. High levels of homocysteine are linked to cardiovascular disease and atherosclerosis, particularly coronary artery disease. PEMT deficiency prevents atherosclerosis in mice fed high-fat, high-cholesterol diets. This is largely a result of lower levels of VLDL lipids in the PEMT-deficient mice. Furthermore, the decreased lipid (PC) content in VLDLs causes changes in lipoprotein structure which allow them to be cleared more rapidly in the PEMT- deficient mice. =Obesity and insulin resistance= PEMT-deficient mice fed high-fat diets have been shown to resist weight gain and be protected from insulin resistance. One potential reason for this phenomenon is that these mice, which exhibit hypermetabolic behavior, rely more on glucose than on fats for energy. It was concluded that insufficient choline resulted in the lack of weight gain, supported by the fact that PC produced via the PEMT pathway can be used to form choline. The PEMT deficient mice showed elevated plasma glucagon levels, increased hepatic expression of glucagon receptor, phosphorylated AMP-activated protein kinase (AMPK), and serine-307-phosphorylated insulin receptor substrate 1 (IRS1-s307), which blocks insulin-mediated signal transduction; together, these contribute to enhanced gluconeogenesis and ultimately insulin resistance. Another possibility is that lack of PEMT in adipose tissue may affect normal fat deposition.

After a 40-year career in various United Nations agencies, page says 35 years, but it was written in 2006 before the Iraq appointment he was appointed Undersecretary of State for Foreign Affairs and thereafter Deputy Foreign Minister in the Italian cabinet headed by Mario Monti. In 2013, he was Director of Operations at the Foundation Villa San Michele in Anacapri. From 2014 to 2019 he was the United Nations Special Envoy for Syria. De Mistura's previous UN posts have included that of Special Representative of the Secretary-General in Iraq (2007‚Äì2009) and Afghanistan (2010‚Äì2011), Personal Representative of the Secretary-General for Southern Lebanon (2001‚Äì2004), and Director of the UN Information Center in Rome (2000‚Äì2001). His work has taken him to many of the world's most volatile trouble-spots including Afghanistan, Iraq, Rwanda, Somalia, Sudan and the former Yugoslavia. Since September 2019, Staffan de Mistura is Associate Professor at Sciences Po Paris School of International Affairs (PSIA) and he is a distinguished Senior Visiting Fellow at the Jackson Institute for Global Affairs at Yale University. Early life Staffan de Mistura was born in 1947 in Stockholm, Sweden, the son of a Swedish mother, Birgitta Johnson de Mistura and an Italian father, Emil Domingo de Mistura. His father belonged to a noble Italian family of ≈†ibenik (Italian: Sebenico) in Croatia, which fled after World War II, together with most Dalmatian Italians, after Tito's Communists took over the country. Working as an intern for the UN World Food Programme (WFP) in Cyprus in the mid-1970s, he witnessed the death of a child, shot by a sniper. The child had wandered over the 'green line' dividing Cyprus and Turkish Republic of Northern Cyprus. This experience was something he found profoundly shocking, but it also stirred up a sense of 'constructive outrage' as he has described it; a desire to study humanitarian emergency relief and dedicate his life to working for the peaceful resolution of conflict. 1970s‚Äì1990s In 1971 de Mistura started his career with the UN as a WFP Project Officer in Sudan. In 1973 he was an Emergency Relief Officer in Chad, there he led the first ever UN airdrop operation. By 1976, he was working as the UN Food and Agriculture Organization's Deputy Chef de Cabinet, a post he remained in until 1985. In addition, he was given special humanitarian assignments to Dubrovnik, Sarajevo, Sudan, Ethiopia, Vietnam and the Lao People's Democratic Republic. In 1987, Staffan de Mistura returned to Sudan to become WFP Director of Operations. From 1988 to 1991, he acted as Director of Fund-Raising and External Relations of the United Nations Office of the Coordinator for Afghanistan. Moving on again, he was employed as Director of the Division of Public Affairs of the United Nations Children's Fund, known as UNICEF, and was also UNICEF representative for Somalia. In 1992, Staffan de Mistura was in Nagorno-Karabakh with UN mission chief Francesco Vendrell . He was briefly the United Nations Humanitarian Coordinator for Iraq. The job lasted from March through August 1997. Staffan de Mistura sat as a member of the Security Council Panel on Humanitarian Issues in Iraq, in 1999. He was also briefly Special Adviser to the High Commissioner for Refugees in Kosovo; a job that lasted from April to June. He was then given the task of Regional Administrator for the Mitrovica Region in Kosovo.http://iseek.unon.un.org/webpgdept1331_13.html 2000‚Äìpresent In June 2000, de Mistura was Special Rapporteur during the Fribourg Forum on Regional Cooperation and Coordination in Crisis Management for Europe and the Newly Independent States. Until 2001, he was Director of the United Nations Information Centre in Rome. From 2001 to 2004, Staffan de Mistura served as Personal Representative of the Secretary-General Kofi Annan in Southern Lebanon. One of his major achievements in that post was to set up and organise a successful de-mining operation. He then went on to serve as Deputy Special Representative for Iraq for 15 months, starting in January 2005. During his tenure, he was keen to portray an optimistic view of Iraq and its chances of recovery, highlighting the hard work the UN were putting in behind the scenes to provide Iraqis with a better standard of living. De Mistura during the Munich Security Conference 2018 After that, he became Director of the UN Staff College in Turin, Italy, a post he retained until 11 September 2007, when Ban Ki-moon appointed him as his Special Representative (SRSG) for Iraq. He was the successor of SRSG Ashraf Qazi and assumed his responsibilities in the Mission Area on 5 November and in Baghdad on 11 November 2007. In the weeks leading up to the appointment, it was reported that politicians in Baghdad strongly favoured a former Romanian envoy to Iraq, Radu Onofrei. However, it was later revealed through Wikileaks that it was the Romanian government that lobbied the US to favor Mr. Onofrei. In July 2009, Staffan de Mistura left Iraq to become the Deputy Executive Director for External Relations of the World Food Programme in Rome. In January 2010, Richard Holbrooke, the U.S. special representative for Afghanistan and Pakistan, revealed that de Mistura had been offered the job as the U.N. special representative in Afghanistan, replacing Kai Eide. The New York Times noted in an editorial that UN Secretary General Ban Ki-moon had also been considering Jean-Marie Gu√©henno of France and Ian Martin of Britain for the Kabul mission. By the end of January 2010, Ban announced his intention to appoint de Mistura in March 2010 as Special Representative of the Secretary General (SRSG) in Afghanistan and Chief of the United Nations Assistance Mission in Afghanistan (UNAMA). While U.S. President Barack Obama laid the blame for the massacre of U.N. officials in Mazar-i- Sharif on the Afghans, Staffan de Mistura said \\"I don't think we should be blaming any Afghan. We should be blaming the person who produced the news‚Äîthe one who burned the Koran.\\" On 28 November 2011, he was nominated Undersecretary of Foreign Affairs in Italy's technocratic cabinet headed by Mario Monti. In May 2013, the Italian Government appointed Deputy Foreign Minister Staffan de Mistura as the Special Envoy of the Prime Minister of Italy to resolve the case of two Italian Navy marines, held in India since February 2012, who were accused by the Indian authorities for allegedly killing by mistake two Indian fishermen, believing that they were pirates, when deployed on an Italian-flagged merchant vessel Enrica Lexie. The 2012 Italian Navy Marines shooting incident in the Laccadive Sea strained diplomatic relations between Italy and India. Staffan de Mistura has been mandated to find a \\"fair, positive and acceptable solution\\" with Indian judicial authorities to ensure a quick trial and return of Massimiliano Latorre and Salvatore Girone to Italy. UN Special Envoy for Syria On 10 July 2014, the United Nations Secretary-General Ban Ki-moon announced that he had appointed Staffan de Mistura as the new special envoy tasked with seeking a peaceful resolution of the conflict in Syria. In October 2016, Staffan de Mistura offered to personally escort the rebels fighters if they were willing to leave Aleppo in order to avoid the continuing bombing over Eastern Aleppo where at least two hundred thousand civilians were caught in the middle of the battle. He added that otherwise, Aleppo would be completely destroyed within two months and thousands of civilians would be killed. Al-Nusra Front refused that offer and instead left Aleppo in December. By 2018, Staffan de Mistura was the longest serving of three UN mediators ‚Äì Kofi Annan and Lakhdar Brahimi ‚Äì during the more-than-seven-year Syrian conflict. In October 2018, he announced that he would step down at the end of November for personal reasons.Michelle Nichols (October 17, 2018), U.N.

In his last briefing to the Security Council, on December 20, 2018, Staffan de Mistura highlighted the various attempts made during the four and a half years of his mandate to move forward the political process. Although stating that the work undertaken by the UN \\"is no substitute for genuine efforts of influential countries to talk to each other and to work constructively\\", he claimed \\"I believe we have made some difference ‚Äì but not enough\\", and listed the essential points to remember from the work carried out during his mandate, before passing it on to his successor: * \\"We have saved lives with some ceasefires and de-escalations, no matter how limited in scope and time, but did save lives, and stimulated humanitarian access to places that were not getting it ‚Äì but nowhere near what civilians desperately needed and asked for ; * We have convened the Government and opposition and also helped the process of uniting the opposition ‚Äì but we have not yet, and we have to admit that, had the parties really recognize each other as interlocutors with whom they must do business and actually negotiate, let alone reach agreements ; * We have elaborated with the parties key principles for a common future and settlement ‚Äì but we have not yet turned these yet into real mechanisms for implementation ; * We have identified a clear agenda accepted by the parties that would facilitate negotiation but we have not yet been able to tap into its potential ; * We have with determination promoted the involvement of Syrian women in the search for a peaceful settlement to the crisis ‚Äì they know what their country is facing, they are more than half of the population ‚Äì even though this is still constantly challenged ; We have with equal determination promoted the meaningful inclusion and substantive participation of civil society ‚Äì but this also is constantly challenged ; * We have nearly completed the work of putting in place a constitutional committee to draft a constitutional reform, as a contribution to the political process‚Äì but there is an extra mile to go ; * We know what is needed for a safe, calm, neutral environment in Syria ‚Äì and for UN supervised elections to the highest international standards pursuant to a new reformed constitution ‚Äì but we have not been able to begin the full work required to make that a reality.\\" In this last address, Staffan de Mistura updated the Council on the challenges that remained and once again urged the Security Council to remain united in support of UN efforts, and to support his successor, Geir Pedersen: ‚Äúwe need a renewed sense of common purpose and concerted action in this Council if 2019 is to be the real turning point for Syria\\", ending his speech as follows: \\"It is this Council - and this Council alone - which is responsible for the maintenance of international peace and security\\".

Although it was initially developed for genomics research, it is largely domain agnostic and is now used as a general bioinformatics workflow management system.https://galaxyproject.org/public- galaxy-servers  Functionality  Galaxy is a scientific workflow system. These systems provide a means to build multi-step computational analyses akin to a recipe. They typically provide a graphical user interface for specifying what data to operate on, what steps to take, and what order to do them in. Galaxy is also a data integration platform for biological data. It supports data uploads from the user's computer, by URL, and directly from many online resources (such as the UCSC Genome Browser, BioMart and InterMine). Galaxy supports a range of widely used biological data formats, and translation between those formats. Galaxy provides a web interface to many text manipulation utilities, enabling researchers to do their own custom reformatting and manipulation without having to do any programming. Galaxy includes interval manipulation utilities for doing set theoretic operations (e.g. intersection, union, ...) on intervals. Many biological file formats include genomic interval data (a frame of reference, e.g., chromosome or contig name, and start and stop positions), allowing these data to be integrated. Galaxy was originally written for biological data analysis, particularly genomics. The set of available tools has been greatly expanded over the years and Galaxy is now also used for gene expression, genome assembly, proteomics, epigenomics, transcriptomics and host of other disciplines in the life sciences. The platform itself is actually domain agnostic and can be applied, in theory, to any scientific domain, such as cheminformatics. For example, Galaxy servers exist for image analysis,https://bio.tools/galaxy_image_analysis computational chemistry and drug design, cosmology, climate modeling, social science, and linguistics. Finally, Galaxy also supports data and analysis persistence and publishing. See Reproducibility and Transparency below.  Project Goals  Galaxy is \\"an open, web-based platform for performing accessible, reproducible, and transparent genomic science.\\" = Accessibility = Computational biology is a specialized domain that often requires knowledge of computer programming. Galaxy aims to give biomedical researchers access to computational biology without also requiring them to understand computer programming. Galaxy does this by stressing a simple user interface over the ability to build complex workflows. This design choice makes it relatively easy to build typical analyses, but more difficult to build complex workflows that include, for example, looping constructs. (See Apache Taverna for an example of a data- driven workflow system that supports looping.) = Reproducibility = Reproducibility is a key goal of science: When scientific results are published the publications should include enough information that others can repeat the experiment and get the same results. There have been many recent efforts to extend this goal from the bench (the \\"wet lab\\") to computational experiments (the \\"dry lab\\") as well. This has proved to be a more difficult task than initially expected. Galaxy supports reproducibility by capturing sufficient information about every step in a computational analysis, so that the analysis can be repeated, exactly, at any point in the future. This includes keeping track of all input, intermediate, and final datasets, as well as the parameters provided to, and the order of each step of the analysis. = Transparency = Galaxy supports transparency in scientific research by enabling researchers to share any of their Galaxy Objects either publicly, or with specific individuals. Shared items can be examined in detail, rerun at will and copied and modified to test hypotheses.  Galaxy Objects: Histories, Workflows, Datasets and Pages  Galaxy objects are anything that can be saved, persisted, and shared in Galaxy: ; Histories: : Histories are computational analyses (recipes) run with specified input datasets, computational steps and parameters. Histories include all intermediate and output datasets as well. ; Workflows: : Workflows are computational analyses that specify all the steps (and parameters) in the analysis, but none of the data. Workflows are used to run the same analysis against multiple sets of input data. ; Datasets: : Datasets includes any input, intermediate, or output dataset, used or produced in an analysis. ; Pages: : Histories, workflows and datasets can include user-provided annotation. Galaxy Pages enables the creation of a virtual paper that describes the how and why of the overall experiment. Tight integration of Pages with Histories, Workflows, and Datasets supports this goal.  Availability  Galaxy is available: # As a free public web server,https://usegalaxy.org/ supported by the Galaxy Project.http://galaxyproject.org/ This server includes many bioinformatics tools that are widely useful in many areas of genomics research. Users can create logins, and save histories, workflows, and datasets on the server. These saved items can also be shared with others. # As open-source software that can be downloaded, installed and customized to address specific needs.http://getgalaxy.org/ Galaxy can be installed locally or using a computing cloud. # Public web servers hosted by other organizations.https://galaxyproject.org/public-galaxy-servers Several organizations with their own Galaxy installation have also opted to make those servers available to others. # As part of the GenomeSpace initiative.  Implementation  Galaxy is open-source software implemented using the Python programming language. It is developed by the Galaxy teamhttps://galaxyproject.org/galaxy-team at Penn State, Johns Hopkins University, Oregon Health & Science University, and the Galaxy Community. Galaxy is extensible, as new command line tools can be integrated and shared within the Galaxy ToolShed. An example of extending Galaxy is Galaxy-P from the University of Minnesota Supercomputing Institute, which is customized as a data analysis platform for mass spectrometry-based proteomics.  Community  Galaxy is an open source project and the community includes users, organizations that install their own instance, Galaxy developers, and bioinformatics tool developers.

The movie stars Alfredo Landa and Francisco Rabal, who both won the Best Actor Award at the 1984 Cannes Film Festival. The film was the highest-grossing Spanish film in Spain at the time before being surpassed by La vaquilla. In the 1984 edition of the Cannes Film Festival it was nominated for the Palme d'Or and won the Prize of the Ecumenical Jury Special Mention. Francisco Rabal and Alfredo Landa shared the Best Actor award at the same festival. It was voted the third best Spanish film by professionals and critics in 1996 Spanish cinema centenary. Plot Paco and R√©gula live on a rural estate owned by an absent marchioness with their three children. Nieves works as a maid in the big house, Quirce is doing his military service, and Charito is severely handicapped. The parents accept the repeated humiliations of their position as dependents at the whim of the owners and the estate manager, but Nieves and Quirce aim for a better life. The family is joined by R√©gula's mentally handicapped brother Azar√≠as, sacked from another estate, who loves birds. The owner's son Ivan often comes back to the estate for two reasons: he is conducting an affair with the manager's bored wife Pura and he is fanatical about shooting birds. Paco, who he forces up a tree to decoy pigeons, falls and breaks a leg. Then he tries using the simple Azar√≠as and, in a fit of pique, shoots the man's pet jackdaw. Next time Azar√≠as is sent up a tree to work decoys, he drops a noose round Ivan's neck and hangs him. Mentally a child, he is shut up in a secure asylum.

Function  The protein encoded by this gene is a member of the dual-specificity protein kinase family that acts as a mitogen-activated protein (MAP) kinase kinase. MAP kinases, also known as extracellular signal-regulated kinases (ERKs), act as an integration point for multiple biochemical signals. This protein kinase lies upstream of MAP kinases and stimulates the enzymatic activity of MAP kinases upon activation by a wide variety of extra- and intracellular signals. As an essential component of the MAP kinase signal transduction pathway, this kinase is involved in many cellular processes such as proliferation, differentiation, transcription regulation and development. Meiosis The genomes of diploid organisms in natural populations are highly polymorphic for insertions and deletions. During meiosis double-strand breaks (DSBs) that form within such polymorphic regions must be repaired by inter-sister chromatid exchange, rather than by inter-homolog exchange. Molecular-level studies of recombination during budding yeast meiosis have shown that recombination events initiated by DSBs in regions that lack corresponding sequences in the homolog are efficiently repaired by inter-sister chromatid recombination. This recombination occurs with the same timing as inter-homolog recombination, but with reduced (2- to 3-fold) yields of joint molecules. MAP2K1 is also known as MEK1 (see Mitogen- activated protein kinase kinase). MEK1 is a meiotic chromosome-axis-associated kinase that is thought to slow down, but not entirely block, sister chromatid recombination. Loss of MEK1 allows inter-sister DSB repair and also inter- sister Holliday junction intermediates to increase. Despite the normal activity of MEK1 in reducing inter-sister chromatid recombination, such recombination still occurs frequently during normal budding yeast meiosis (although not as frequently as during mitosis), and up to one-third of all recombination events are between sister chromatids. Interactions MAP2K1 has been shown to interact with C-Raf, Phosphatidylethanolamine binding protein 1, MAP2K1IP1, GRB10, MAPK3, MAPK8IP3, MAPK1 MP1, and MAP3K1.

This enzyme participates in bacterial chemotaxis - general and bacterial chemotaxis - organism-specific. CheR proteins are part of the chemotaxis signaling mechanism which methylates the chemotaxis receptor at specific glutamate residues. Methyl transfer from the ubiquitous S-adenosyl-L-methionine (AdoMet/SAM) to either nitrogen, oxygen or carbon atoms is frequently employed in diverse organisms ranging from bacteria to plants and mammals. The reaction is catalysed by methyltransferases (Mtases) and modifies DNA, RNA, proteins and small molecules, such as catechol for regulatory purposes. The various aspects of the role of DNA methylation in prokaryotic restriction-modification systems and in a number of cellular processes in eukaryotes including gene regulation and differentiation is well documented. Flagellated bacteria swim towards favourable chemicals and away from deleterious ones. Sensing of chemoeffector gradients involves chemotaxis receptors, transmembrane (TM) proteins that detect stimuli through their periplasmic domains and transduce the signals via their cytoplasmic domains . Signalling outputs from these receptors are influenced both by the binding of the chemoeffector ligand to their periplasmic domains and by methylation of specific glutamate residues on their cytoplasmic domains. Methylation is catalysed by CheR, an S-adenosylmethionine-dependent methyltransferase, which reversibly methylates specific glutamate residues within a coiled coil region, to form gamma- glutamyl methyl ester residues. The structure of the Salmonella typhimurium chemotaxis receptor methyltransferase CheR, bound to S-adenosylhomocysteine, has been determined to a resolution of 2.0 Angstrom. The structure reveals CheR to be a two-domain protein, with a smaller N-terminal helical domain linked via a single polypeptide connection to a larger C-terminal alpha/beta domain. The C-terminal domain has the characteristics of a nucleotide-binding fold, with an insertion of a small anti-parallel beta-sheet subdomain. The S-adenosylhomocysteine-binding site is formed mainly by the large domain, with contributions from residues within the N-terminal domain and the linker region.

It was broadcast to much of Birmingham, Coventry and Warwickshire and was the 'oldies' station which took over the mediumwave frequencies of both BRMB (serving Birmingham) and Mercia FM (Coventry and Warwickshire). The programming came from the BRMB studios in Aston, Birmingham, and the signal was relayed from the Langley Mill transmitter (Birmingham) and Shilton (Coventry). The Coventry station was acquired in 1993 by GWR Group and replaced by Classic Gold, while the Birmingham station continued until 1998 when it was replaced by Capital Gold. History The station was launched on the morning of 4 April 1989, as a response to government disapproval of the simulcasting of programming on FM and mediumwave. Xtra AM became a 'gold' station and targeted listeners in the 35 to 50 age range, while BRMB and Mercia both began to cater for a younger audience. The new AM service was launched to much fanfare with its inaugural host, Les Ross, conducting a spoof interview with Elvis Presley as part of its publicity. Xtra AM quickly became popular with its audience and was soon rivalling its FM counterparts. Despite this, however, BRMB maintained the larger proportion of the audience share. One of the key ingredients in this success was the appointment of Les Ross as the station's breakfast host: a well liked and respected broadcaster in the region, when Ross left BRMB to move to Xtra AM, he took many of his listeners with him. He remained with the station for four years, before making a return to BRMB following a programming shake-up in 1993. As well as playing what it termed 'classic hits', Xtra AM also carried a mini playlist of 12 songs from the current Top 40 which were deemed to fit with its music profile. Regional news, weather, events and community information, as well as local advertising were separate for the Birmingham and Coventry areas, but programming was simulcast in both areas from Birmingham. BRMB's famous and well respected sports coverage was moved over to the new station, where Tom Ross continued to cover the region's sports events with his unique presenting style. Presenters on the station included many who were already established personalities in the West Midlands region. During Xtra AM's nine years on air, besides Ross these included Annie Othen, Ted Elliott, Tony Butler, Adrian Stewart, Dave Hickman, Mick Wright, Guy Jogoo and Noddy Holder (who hosted a popular Sunday afternoon show playing music from the 1970s). Jimmy Savile was also heard on the station, presenting a syndicated oldies show (also taken by a number of other commercial stations) based on his previous BBC Radio 1 show.  Closure  Capital Radio acquired Midlands Radio plc in 1993, and then decided to sell off the majority of the stations that belonged to the group. Capital retained BRMB, but Mercia FM was included in those to be sold. Consequently, the two Xtra AM frequencies experienced a parting of the ways. GWR Group purchased the Coventry station and as a result it was announced that Xtra AM in Coventry was to close, with the 1359 kHz frequency joining the Classic Gold Network. Xtra AM continued in Birmingham, however, on 1152 kHz, and the presenters urged Coventry listeners to retune to that frequency; this contributed to GWR pulling the plug on Xtra AM using 1359, earlier than provisionally agreed. With the 1994 launch of 100.7 Heart FM, listeners were given greater choice, while the quality of broadcasting on the FM services was preferable to the poor reception often experienced on the mediumwave band. Ratings for Xtra AM gradually fell throughout the mid-1990s before the end finally came in April 1998. The majority of the Xtra AM team were made redundant, the station renamed Capital Gold Birmingham, and the bulk of programming was switched to London and simulcast from Capital Gold. The only local programming to remain was a four-hour afternoon show and Tom Ross's sports coverage. On 3 August 2007, the station, along with the rest of the Capital Gold network, was replaced by a new network called simply Gold, the result of the merger of the Classic Gold and Capital Gold networks under one owner, GCap Media.

The protein encoded by this gene is a member of the 14-3-3 protein family and a central hub protein for many signal transduction pathways. 14-3-3Œ∂ is a major regulator of apoptotic pathways critical to cell survival and plays a key role in a number of cancers and neurodegenerative diseases.  Structure  14-3-3 proteins generally form ~30 kDa-long homo- or heterodimers. Each of the monomers are composed of 9 antiparallel alpha helices. Four alpha-helices (Œ±C, Œ±E, Œ±G, and Œ±I) form an amphipathic groove that serves as the ligand binding site, which can recognize three types of consensus binding motifs: RXX(pS/pT)XP, RXXX(pS/pT)XP, and (pS/pT)X1-2-COOH (where pS/pT represents phosphorylated serine/threonine). In addition to these primary interactions, the target protein can also bind outside the groove via secondary interactions. In particular, the crystallized structure of 14-3-3Œ∂ forms a cup-shaped dimer when complexed with CBY. The YWHAZ gene encodes two transcript variants which differ in the 5' UTR but produce the same protein.  Function  14-3-3Œ∂ is one of 7 members of the 14-3-3 protein family, which is ubiquitously expressed and highly conserved among plants and mammals. This protein family is known for regulating signal transduction pathways primarily through binding phosphoserine proteins, though it can also bind phosphothreonine proteins and unphosphorylated proteins. By extension, 14-3-3 proteins are involved in a wide range of biological processes, including metabolism, transcription, apoptosis, protein transport, and cell cycle regulation. This combination of dependence on phosphorylation and widespread biological impact results in dynamic regulation of multiple signalling pathways and allows for cellular adaptation to environmental changes. In particular, 14-3-3Œ∂ is a key player in regulating cell survival and interacts with many apoptotic proteins, including Raf kinases, BAX, BAD, NOXA, and caspase-2. For the most part,14-3-3Œ∂ negatively regulates apoptosis by binding and sequestering BAD and BAX in the cytoplasm, effectively preventing activation of proapoptotic Bcl-2 and Bcl-XL, as well as by preventing NOXA from inhibiting antiapoptotic MCL1. As a result, 14-3-3Œ∂ functions to protect the cell from environmental stresses, such as chemotherapy-induced death, anoikis, growth factor deprivation, and hypoxia. As an example of its dynamic activity, 14-3-3Œ∂ activates autophagy under hypoxic conditions by binding ATG9A, while it prevents autophagy under hyperglycemic conditions by binding Vps34. Furthermore, 14-3-3Œ∂ may regulate glucose receptor trafficking in response to insulin levels through its interaction with IRS1. In addition to cell survival, 14-3-3Œ∂ regulates cell cycle progression through various ligands and processes. For instance, 14-3-3Œ∂ controls cellular senescence by complexing with BIS to chaperone protein folding of STAT3 and activate the signaling pathway. Also, 14-3-3Œ∂ can negatively regulate the G2-M phase checkpoint by binding and sequestering the cyclin-dependent kinases to the cytoplasm, thus inhibiting their activity. Since 14-3-3Œ∂ is predominantly found in the cytoplasm and binds many nuclear proteins, it likely prevents nuclear import by blocking the nuclear localization signal of target proteins. Its localization to both the cytoplasm and nucleus also suggests a role in gene expression, possibly through regulation of transcription factor activity. = Antigenic Function = Emerging literature shows the increased presence of the anti-14-3-3Œ∂ antibodies in several immune dysfunctions, including human vasculitis and cancer. The antigenic 14-3-3Œ∂ can directly affect T cell differentiation into Th1 and Th17 cells, and thereby promotes IFN-gamma and IL-17 production. The MHC class II presentation of 14-3-3Œ∂ antigen strongly influence IFN-gamma production. The physiological significance of its antigenic role remains unknown = Signaling regulator = Intracellular 14-3-3Œ∂ plays a role in interleukin-17 signaling. IL-17A is a proinflammatory cytokine involved in autoimmune diseases and host defense. The presence of 14-3-3Œ∂ creates a bias in IL-17A signaling outcomes, by promoting the production of IL-6 while suppressing CXCL1. Clinical Significance The14-3-3 protein zeta/delta (14-3-3Œ∂) is a protein (in humans encoded by the YWHAZ gene on chromosome 8) with an important apoptotic constituents. During a normal embryologic processes, or during cell injury (such as ischemia-reperfusion injury during heart attacks and strokes) or during developments and processes in cancer, an apoptotic cell undergoes structural changes including cell shrinkage, plasma membrane blebbing, nuclear condensation, and fragmentation of the DNA and nucleus. This is followed by fragmentation into apoptotic bodies that are quickly removed by phagocytes, thereby preventing an inflammatory response. It is a mode of cell death defined by characteristic morphological, biochemical and molecular changes. It was first described as a \\"shrinkage necrosis\\", and then this term was replaced by apoptosis to emphasize its role opposite mitosis in tissue kinetics. In later stages of apoptosis the entire cell becomes fragmented, forming a number of plasma membrane-bounded apoptotic bodies which contain nuclear and or cytoplasmic elements. The ultrastructural appearance of necrosis is quite different, the main features being mitochondrial swelling, plasma membrane breakdown and cellular disintegration. Apoptosis occurs in many physiological and pathological processes. It plays an important role during embryonal development as programmed cell death and accompanies a variety of normal involutional processes in which it serves as a mechanism to remove \\"unwanted\\" cells. As a major hub protein, 14-3-3Œ∂ is involved in various diseases and disorders. For one, 14-3-3Œ∂ plays a central role in cell proliferation and, by extension, tumor progression. The protein has been implicated in many cancers, including lung cancer, breast cancer, lymphoma, and head and neck cancer, through pathways such as mTOR, Akt, and glucose receptor trafficking. Notably, it has been associated with chemoresistance and, thus, is a promising therapeutic target for cancer treatment. So far, it stands to become a prognostic marker for breast cancer, lung cancer, head and neck cancer, and possibly gastric cancer in patients who might require more aggressive treatment. However, no statistically significant relationship was determined in hepatocellular carcinoma. In addition to cancers, 14-3-3Œ∂ has been implicated in pathogenic infections and neurodegenerative diseases, including Creutzfeldt‚ÄìJakob disease, Parkinson‚Äôs disease, and Alzheimer‚Äôs disease (AD). 14-3-3Œ∂ has been observed to participate in AD through its interaction with tau protein, and its expression is correlated with disease severity. The human surfactant protein A, an innate immunity molecule (encoded by two genes SFTPA1 and SFTPA2) appears to be binding with the 14-3-3 protein family. Furthermore, inhibition of 14-3-3 was correlated with lower levels of the surfactant protein indicating a relationship between surface and 14-3-3 proteins. Surfactant is an important element in the maintenance of lung and respiratory functions. A lack of surfactant is closely related to respiratory distress syndrome. Preterm neonates who exhibit neonatal respiratory distress syndrome (NRDS) exhibit a deficiency of surfactant. All together, the 14-3-3 protein may have a significant role in respiratory function and NRDS.

Admission into each choir is by audition, carried out in the weeks leading up to the fall semester. Each ensemble requires a two-semester commitment. BYU Singers BYU Singers is a small, flexible group of approximately 40 musicians. Founded in 1984 by Ronald Staheli, the choir's repertoire encompasses a range of musical eras and styles, including classical, contemporary, and world music. In addition to performing throughout the United States, they have performed in Western and Eastern Europe, Israel, New Zealand, West Africa, and South Africa. BYU Singers is the only choir to sing at all three of America's top choral conventions in the same year.\\"Y. singers to finish a 'grand slam' tour\\", Deseret News, Oct 29, 2006 They were invited to open the American Choral Directors Association (ACDA) Convention in Los Angeles in 2005, and were one of four collegiate choirs invited to perform in Texas for the first conference of the National Collegiate Choral Organization in 2006. In 2009, the BYU Singers attended the Cork International Choral Festival where they were awarded the PEACE Award and earned 2nd prize for the Fleischmann International Trophy. Andrew Crane became the director of the choir following the retirement of Staheli in 2015. BYU Concert Choir BYU Concert Choir conducted by Rosalind Hall The BYU Concert Choir is a mixed chorus of approximately 90 men and women. The group performs a wide variety of choral repertoire ranging from the Renaissance to modern, and all from memory. The choir was first organized in 1984 by Mack Wilberg, who has also written a number of songs and arrangements specifically for the ensemble. When Wilberg left BYU in 1999 to become an assistant conductor for the Mormon Tabernacle Choir, Rosalind Hall was appointed to conduct the Concert Choir. The choir has performed at the ACDA convention and with the Utah Symphony. The choir has released two albums on Tantara Records: \\"All Creatures of Our God and King\\" and \\"Beautiful River\\". In 2006, the Concert Choir performed the premiere of two works by Mack Wilberg: \\"Till All Eternity Shall Ring,\\" and \\"Dances to Life.\\" BYU Men's Chorus The BYU Men's Chorus is the largest male collegiate choir in the USA The BYU Men's Chorus, the largest collegiate male choir in the United States,Jackie Fletcher, \\"Brigham Young University men's choir to perform\\", Dixie Sun News, March 21, 2007 originally started in 1901 at BYU as \\"Male Glee\\". Anthony C. Lund directed the choir until the 1920s; then the choir came under the direction of Florence Jepperson Madsen and her husband, Franklin Madsen, with short periods under William F. Hanson and John R. Halliday. In 1955, the Male Chorus became an official class at BYU, conducted by Ralph Woodward, until his retirement in 1984. Mack Wilberg became the conductor of the ensemble in 1984, and the name was changed to Men's Chorus. The Men's Chorus increased its reputation and gained fame through performances on the BYU campus and on short tours, as well as through nationally broadcast videos. In 1999, Wilberg was replaced as choral director by Rosalind Hall. The choir has performed at the ACDA conventions and performs frequently to sold-out audiences. The choir is limited to about 200 members. The repertoire frequently includes Latin and classical pieces, folk songs from various countries, music of The Church of Jesus Christ of Latter-day Saints (LDS Church), and well-known American pieces. The choir released two albums of anthems, folk songs, and hymns under the direction of Wilberg (released by Deseret Book: Shout With Glory - 1995, and Awake My Soul - 1997). Under the direction of Hall, the choir has released three additional albums. \\"Praise Him\\", released by Tantara Records in 2005, was a third volume of anthems, folk songs, and hymns as a follow-up to the successful previous two albums. In 2013, another self-produced album, \\"Set Apart\\", was released in response to the increase in the number of missionaries serving, after the October 2012 announcement by Thomas S. Monson lowering the minimum age for service of missionaries. As a gift to missionaries and others throughout the world, it was determined that the album would be the first-ever album from a BYU choir released free of charge to the public as a download. In April 2020, Hall retired as director of Men's Chorus and Concert Choir with Brent Wells filling her position. BYU Women's Chorus The BYU Women's Chorus is made up of about 160 singers and performs a large number of concerts throughout the year. Formerly conducted by a number of different faculty and graduate students, since 2004 the choir has been directed by Jean Simons Applonie, who also founded and conducted the Utah-based women's choir Viva Voce. When Applonie became the director of the Women's Choirs in 2004 she became the first faculty member to serve as its director. In 2008, the choir released its first solo recording \\"Wondrous Love\\" and has appeared on several albums featuring the combined choirs. The choir performed in the 2015 ACDA convention. In 2019, Sonja Poulter became the group's conductor. Past choirs The BYU Madrigal Singers were formed in 1952 under the direction of John R. Halliday. Halliday (1911‚Äì1988) had bachelor's and master's degrees in music from BYU and a Ph.D. from the Eastman School of Music.Oral History interview with Halliday jointly sponsored by the BYU archives and BYU Alumni Association Emeritus Club He had also been an assistant director of the Mormon Tabernacle Choir, under J. Spencer Cornwall. For the ten years before the forming of the Madrigal Singers, Halliday had been the director of the BYU bands. The Madrigal Singers toured extensively during the 1950s. The BYU Oratorio Choir was formed in 1961, also under Halliday's direction, with the goal of performing oratorios, cantatas and similar large-scale ensemble pieces. Other BYU singing groups organized between 1951 and 1975 included the BYU Chamber Choir, the Golden Age Singers, the BYU A Cappella Choir, the BYU Opera Workshop Chorus, and Scola Cantorum.Ernest L.

The majority of Freemasons belong to lodges that recognise the United Grand Lodge of England and do not recognise Continental Freemasons, regarding them as \\"irregular\\". Two branches of Freemasonry Today, Freemasonry is often said to consist of two branches \\"not in mutual regular amity\\"; *the Anglo/American \\"Regular\\" tradition of jurisdictions, typified by the United Grand Lodge of England (UGLE) (mostly termed Grand Lodges), and *the European \\"Continental\\" tradition of jurisdictions, typified by GODF (mostly termed Grand Orients) with varying and shifting amity. In most Latin countries, the GODF-style or European Continental Freemasonry predominates,Pieyns, Ren√©, Het rijke ma√ßonnieke leven, 3. De universele vrijmetselarij, Fonds Marcel Hofmans, Brussels, 2001, p. 12-26 although in most of these Latin countries there are also Grand Lodges and Grand Orients that are in \\"regular amity\\" with the UGLE and the worldwide community of Grand Lodges that share \\"regular\\" fraternal relations with the UGLE. The rest of the world, accounting for the bulk of Freemasonry, tends to follow more closely to the UGLE style, although minor variations exist. =History of the schism= There are many reasons why the schism in Freemasonry occurred, and why it still persists. The first instance of derecognition occurred in the United States shortly after the American Civil War. In 1869, the Grand Orient de France (GODF) recognized a Masonic group in Louisiana which was not recognized by the Grand Lodge of Louisiana (GLL). This was seen by GLL as an invasion of its jurisdiction, and it withdrew its recognition of GODF. At the request of GLL, several other American Grand Lodges also withdrew recognition.U.S. Recognition of French Grand Lodges in the 1900s Paul Bessel, published in Heredom: The Transactions of the Scottish Rite Research Society ‚Äì volume 5, 1996, pages 221‚Äì244 There is some evidence that racial motivations may also have played a part in this derecognition. The GODF had recently passed a resolution stating that \\"neither color, race, nor religion should disqualify a man for initiation\\" and the Grand Lodge of Louisiana, at that time, strictly excluded blacks and those of mixed race. However, this initial split was not unanimous in the US. Many American Grand Lodges continued to recognize the GODF well into the 20th century.U.S. Recognition of French Grand Lodges in the 1900s , Paul Bessel, published in Heredom: The Transactions of the Scottish Rite Research Society ‚Äì volume 5, 1996, pages 221‚Äì244 1877 schism The schism widened in 1877 when the GODF changed its constitutions to allow for complete religious \\"La√Øcit√©\\". While the Anglo-American tradition had long required (and still does require) candidates to overtly express a belief in deity, the GODF removed that requirement, stating that La√Øcit√© \\"imposes that all men are given, without distinction of class, origin or denomination, the means to be themselves, to have the freedom of choice, to be responsible for their own maturity and masters of their destiny.\\"Grand Orient of France: La√Øcit√© Can Freemasonry be Secular? In other words, the GODF would admit atheists, while those lodges in the Anglo-American tradition would not. The United Grand Lodge of England thus withdrew its recognition, and declared the GODF to be \\"irregular.\\" As other jurisdictions tended to follow the lead of either GODF or UGLE, the schism grew. =Background on the belief in Deity= There is some debate as to exactly when Freemasonry in the Anglo-American tradition started requiring its members to have a belief in Deity. There are hints that this was the case from the earliest days of Freemasonry: The Regius Manuscript, the oldest known Masonic document dating from around 1425‚Äì50, states that a Mason \\"must love well God and holy church always.\\" James Anderson's 1723 Constitutions state that \\"A Mason is oblig'd by his Tenure, to obey the moral Law, and if he rightly understands the Art, he will never be a stupid Atheist, nor an irreligious Libertine.\\" However, these do not explicitly state that a belief in Deity is required. The GODF did not accept this requirement until 1849, accepted it until 1877, and then changed back.Iowa Proceedings 1918, pp. 25‚Äì29. Nonetheless, it should not be understood that the difference was limited to the mere requirement in belief. Following the 1877 changes, the Grand Orient also removed all references to the Grand Architect of the Universe from its rite, and removed the Volume of the Sacred Law (which in France was the Bible) from its ritual. These elements had been present in French freemasonry before 1849. =Political discussion in the lodges= Another point of difference between Continental and Anglo-American Freemasonry is whether political discussion is allowed within the lodges. Such discussion is allowed in Lodges following the Continental tradition, while it is strictly banned in the Anglo-American tradition.Liberal Freemasonry ‚Äì fm-fr.org Relationship with the Catholic Church Continental Freemasonry has been concentrated in traditionally Catholic countries and has been seen by Catholic critics as an outlet for anti-Catholic disaffection.\\"Everyone knows that the Grand Orient Lodges of Europe and Latin America have been anti-clerical from the start. For the Congregation for the Doctrine of the Faith to advise Catholics against joining these Grand Orient Lodges would be like the National Association for the Advancement of Colored People advising blacks against applying for membership in the Ku Klux Klan\\", William Whalen, The Pastoral Problem of Masonic Membership Many particularly anti-clerical regimes in traditionally Catholic countries were perceived as having strong Masonic connections. The 1913 Catholic Encyclopedia credited Freemasonry for the French Revolution and its persecution of the Church, citing a claim made in a document from the Grand Orient de France.\\"Masonry, which prepared the Revolution of 1789, has the duty to continue its work\\" ( footnote 163 cites: the Circular of the Grand Orient of France, 2 April 1889, The Encyclopedia saw Freemasonry as the primary force of French anti-clericalism from 1877 onwards, again citing official documents of French Masonry to support its claim.\\"French Masonry and above all the Grand Orient of France has displayed the most systematic activity as the dominating political element in the French \\"Kulturkampf\\" since 1877\\" . According to one historian, Masonic hostility continued into the early twentieth century with the Affaire Des Fiches (footnote 26) cites : and, according to the old Catholic Encyclopedia, the 1905 French law on the Separation of the Churches and the State\\"In truth all the 'anti-clerical' Masonic reforms carried out in France since 1877, such as the secularization of education, measures against private Christian schools and charitable establishments, the suppression of the religious orders and the spoliation of the Church, professedly culminate in an anti-Christian and irreligious reorganization of human society, not only in France but throughout the world\\" . \\"From the fall of the MacMahon government in 1877 to the start of World War II, Masonic politicians controlled the French government. They passed anticlerical laws designed to restrict the Church's influence, especially in education\\" . can be credited to the Grand Orient de France, based on Masonic documents. In Italy the Church linked the anticlerical and nationalist secret society, the Carbonari, to Freemasonry\\"It also links Freemasonry with the Society of the Carbonari, known as the \\"Charcoal Burners\\", who at that time were active in Italy and were believed to be a revolutionary group\\" ( and blamed the anticlerical direction of Italian Unification, or Risorgimento, on Freemasonry. Into the 1890s the Church would justify its calls for Catholics to avoid dealings with the Italian state with a reference to the state's supposed \\"Masonic\\" nature.\\"Masonry has confiscated the inheritance of public charity; fill the void, then, with the treasure of private relief\\" (). Mexican Freemasonry was also seen as following the pattern of Continental Freemasonry in other Latin-speaking countries, viewed as becoming more anti-clerical during the nineteenth century, particularly because they adopted the Scottish Rite degree system created by Albert Pike, which the Catholic Church saw as anti-clerical.\\"As the 19th Century went on, Mexican Masonry embraced the degree system authored by Albert Pike and grew ever more anticlerical, regardless of Rite\\" () Even as late as 2005 the president of Spain's Union of Catholic Professional Fraternities blamed the anti-clerical measures of the Socialist government on a \\"tremendous crusade by Masonry against the Church.\\"\\"The president of the Union of Catholic Professional Fraternities, Luis Labiano, said this week a \\"tremendous crusade by Masonry against the Church\\" exists in Spain.\\" Spanish Catholic organization blames Masons for ‚Äútremendous crusade‚Äù against Church, 27 September 2004, Catholic News Agency.

Freemasons attached to the more mainstream branch of Freemasonry, affiliated with the United Grand Lodge of England and the 51 US Grand Lodges, have often claimed that the anticlericalism of the Continental Branch of Freemasonry is a \\"deviation\\" from proper Freemasonry.15\\\\.

Continental style Grand Orients, however, are in the majority. In Brazil, for example the largest and oldest Masonic body, the Grande Oriente do Brasil is recognised by Anglo-American jurisdictions.A Page about Freemasonry In many Latin American countries, the split in Masonic obedience has mirrored political divisions.

Other European countries Continental style Freemasonry is also prevalent in countries such as Belgium, Italy, Portugal and Spain, although here too there are rival bodies following the Anglo-American tradition. It is present, but not in the majority, in most other European countries. In Germanic states, Anglo-American and Swedish Rite traditions predominate. =North America= Although there are a number of Continental style organizations that are active, Continental style Freemasonry remains in the extreme minority in North America.

McCollum is a New York City resident with a lengthy arrest record for crimes related to the transit system operated by the New York City Metropolitan Transportation Authority (MTA). He has been fascinated with trains since his childhood, and has been diagnosed with Asperger syndrome. Characteristics McCollum has been interested in trains from an early age, frequently riding the New York City Subway for days at a time. His fixation with trains has led McCollum to frequently impersonate MTA employees or a related entity, for which he has been jailed numerous times. McCollum has been rejected for employment by MTA on numerous occasions, although he is reported to know more about the trains, schedules, procedures and rail operations than any current employee. A prison psychiatrist who did an evaluation diagnosed him with Asperger syndrome. McCollum is said to have memorized the New York City Subway map by age 8. Notable arrests According to McCollum's mother, his interest with the New York City Subway system started in his youth, when subway motormen permitted him to drive trains. McCollum was first arrested in 1980, at age 15, when he drove an in-service New York City Subway E train for six stops. While he was in jail at Rikers Island, he wrote to the New York City Department of Correction and asked if he could drive one of their buses. By the mid-1990s, McCollum \\"had become a minor cult figure\\", particularly after the MTA posted thousands of wanted posters in trains and stations so that riders could report sightings. Occasionally, McCollum would appear as transit employees named \\"Morning\\" or \\"Manning\\", who riders invariably experienced as friendly and helpful. By 2000, McCollum had been jailed 19 times for transit-related crimes. That year he pleaded guilty to charges of forgery and burglary for signing out a train according to proper MTA procedure to perform customary duties (extinguishing track fires, supervising maintenance), and then signing it back in. He was sentenced to a minimum of to 5 years in prison. In 2005, McCollum was apprehended at a Long Island Rail Road yard with the keys to an M-7 railcar in his pocket. They had been given to him by his MTA friends who had given him their shifts, but he pleaded guilty to attempting to steal a locomotive and was sentenced to three years in prison. Although he was released from Sing Sing in 2006, he was reimprisoned for breaking parole after he was found in possession of railroad property. On June 13, 2008, McCollum, now 43, was arrested again. He was wearing a hardhat and carrying a knapsack, flashlight and gloves with an MTA logo. He was dressed in the blue T-shirt and work pants typically worn by track workers and was arrested as he tried to enter a restricted area of a midtown station. McCollum was charged with criminal impersonation, criminal trespass and possession of burglary tools‚Äîa hammer and screwdriver tucked in his backpack. These \\"burglary tools\\" are also the typical repair equipment that all MTA maintenance workers carry. When his mother was interviewed over the telephone, she said, \\"Any time Darius wears anything remotely resembling the transit uniform, he gets arrested.\\" McCollum was released from the Downstate Correctional Facility on July 3, 2007‚Äînine months after his arrest for violating parole by returning to the city from Winston-Salem, North Carolina. He was arrested at Penn Station on October 5, 2008, for impersonating a Long Island Rail Road employee and answering passengers' questions. On August 31, 2010, McCollum was arrested for the 27th time and charged with grand larceny and possession of stolen property in connection with the theft of a private bus from a Trailways of New York terminal in Hoboken, New Jersey. According to police, McCollum allegedly boarded the bus at approximately 6:30 a.m. that morning and discovered the keys left in the ignition. McCollum is accused of then commandeering the bus, with the theft reportedly going unnoticed for two hours as McCollum drove around John F. Kennedy International Airport and Jamaica, Queens. McCollum was taken into custody without incident. Police stated McCollum is \\"very smart, he's not a dumb guy\\" and that he was a \\"gentleman\\" during arrest and processing. At the time of his arrest, he had spent 18 years‚Äîmore than a third of his life‚Äîin jail for transit-related offenses. In 2013, McCollum pleaded guilty to stealing the Trailways bus. On December 24 of that year, McCollum was released on parole and was to voluntarily enter cognitive behavioral therapy. The terms of the parole, which lasted until August 24, 2015, required that he does not operate a motor vehicle. On November 11, 2015, McCollum was arrested for stealing a Greyhound bus from the Port Authority Bus Terminal in Manhattan. He drove the GPS-equipped bus for approximately 2 hours until his arrest at approximately 4 p.m. in Gowanus, Brooklyn. According to The New York Times, McCollum said, ‚ÄúI‚Äôm stealing a plane next‚Äù after his arrest. Although his parents, who moved to Winston-Salem, North Carolina, believe McCollum should leave New York to avoid the temptation of the trains, parole conditions have until recently repeatedly restricted McCollum to remain in New York City. Suggestions from his parents and autism advocates that the MTA find a way to hire McCollum in some capacity, in the manner of Frank Abagnale, are rejected by transit officials, who fear legal liability. In January 2018, McCollum took a plea bargain in which he agreed to go to a psychiatric institution for an \\"indefinite\\" period of time. In popular culture After McCollum used an insanity defense based on Asperger‚Äôs, he became a folk hero to people with autism spectrum disorder, especially children, celebrated for his ‚Äúrebellion against what autistics often call the dreary world of the 'neurotypicals'‚Äù. In spite of his diagnosis from several psychiatrists, during at least two criminal proceedings, this defense was denied as the judge ruled he was ‚Äúcapable of controlling his impulses‚Äù. A Harper‚Äôs Magazine article on McCollum by Jeff Tietz was a finalist in profile writing for the 2003 American Society of Magazine Editors awards. At the 2003 Edinburgh Fringe, Paperhat Productions of New York mounted a play by Director Jude Domski called Boy Steals Train, based on McCollum‚Äôs life and letters McCollum wrote to Domski, and described as ‚Äúpointing a shaming collective finger at a judiciary that refuses to recognize Darius's condition‚Äù. \\"Reviews from the 2003 Edinburgh Fringe\\" , The play was awarded a Fringe First by The Scotsman and the troupe won a Best Ensemble Acting Award. His story was also made into a BBC radio play, broadcast on BBC Radio 4 in August 2005. McCollum appears in Episode 2 of ‚ÄúThe Dark End of The Spectrum,‚Äù a two-hour, two-part, radio documentary that aired on CBC‚Äôs radio show Ideas on June 2, 2008 and again on July 24 (Part 1) and July 31 (Part 2), 2009.

Modern versions can be traced back to Blind Lemon Jefferson's \\"Deceitful Brownskin Blues\\", which was released as a single in 1927. It later appears in the 1934 book, American Ballads and Folk Songs, by the noted father-and-son pair of musicologists and folklorists, John Lomax and Alan Lomax. The book notes that \\"An eighteen-year old black girl, in prison for murder, sang the song and the first stanza of these blues.\\" The Lomaxes then added a number of verses from other sources and named it \\"Woman Blue\\". The music and melody are similar to Lucille Bogan's \\"B.D. Woman Blues\\" (c. 1935), although the lyrics are completely different. In the mid-1950s, traditional musician Bob Coltman found the song in the Lomax book, arranged it and began singing it frequently around Philadelphia and New England circa 1957-1960. In 1959, Coltman taught it to Tossi Aaron who recorded it in 1960 for her LP Tossi Sings Folk Songs & Ballads on Prestige International. Joan Baez recorded a version for her 1960 debut album on Vanguard Records but the track was not released until 2001. Throughout the early 1960s the song gained popularity through folk performers, most notably The Kingston Trio, who included the song \\"Rider\\" on their album Sunny Side! in 1963. So did The Big 3, an American folk trio that featured Cass Elliot. Folk singer Judy Roderick also recorded an influential version of the song under the title \\"Woman Blue\\" and it became the title track of her second album, recorded and released by Vanguard in 1965. British folk singer John Renbourn recorded a version of the song (titled \\"I Know My Babe\\") and it was included on his 1967 solo album, Another Monday. By the mid-1960s, rock acts had begun to record the song. Well known versions include those by The Grateful Dead, Janis Joplin, James Taylor (as \\"Circle Round the Sun\\", on James Taylor), the Seldom Scene and Hot Tuna. The Astronauts released a version on their 1967 album Travelin' Men. The Byrds recorded the song during 1966, under the title \\"I Know My Rider (I Know You Rider)\\", but their version remained unreleased until 1987, when it was included on Never Before. The Byrds' version was later included as a bonus track on the expanded CD edition of their Fifth Dimension album. The Byrds also performed the song at the Monterey Pop Festival, though that performance of \\"I Know My Rider (I Know You Rider)\\" has never been officially released.Rogan (1998) p.218 The Dutch progressive rock band Galaxy- Lin released an influential version of the song (titled \\"I Know My Baby\\") on their 1975 album, G. The song was also covered by reggae/rock fusion artists Slightly Stoopid on their 2008 album Slightly Not Stoned Enough to Eat Breakfast Yet Stoopid and Big House on their 2008 Never Ending Train album. It has also been partially covered by experimental folk band Akron/Family. Other renditions \\"I Know You Rider\\" was also a staple of the Grateful Dead's live shows. It was the first song that bass player Phil Lesh rehearsed with the band upon joining. However, Lesh was not confident enough in his own singing abilities to handle the song's lead vocal. During the Grateful Dead's live concerts, it was usually performed as the second half of a medley with \\"China Cat Sunflower\\". This segue was later used by Bruce Hornsby and The Range, with \\"I Know You Rider\\" following their song, \\"The Red Plains\\". The International Tussler Society, a band of key members of the Norwegian progrock band Motorpsycho, has also recorded a version, available on the album The Tussler - Original Motion Picture Soundtrack. The album was the soundtrack to a fictional Spaghetti Western by non-existent director Theo Buhara. Its Country Rock sound marked a drastic departure from the earlier Motorpsycho records, which were hard-rocking. Marty Stuart and His Fabulous Superlatives often opened their concerts with \\"I Know You(r) Rider\\" between 2015 and 2017.

In circuits made with individual devices (discrete circuits), biasing networks consisting of resistors are commonly employed. Much more elaborate biasing arrangements are used in integrated circuits, for example, bandgap voltage references and current mirrors. The voltage divider configuration achieves the correct voltages by the use of resistors in certain patterns. By selecting the proper resistor values, stable current levels can be achieved that vary only little over temperature and with transistor properties such as Œ≤. The operating point of a device, also known as bias point, quiescent point, or Q-point, is the point on the output characteristics that shows the DC collector‚Äìemitter voltage (Vce) and the collector current (Ic) with no input signal applied. Bias circuit requirements The bias circuit stabilizes the operating point of the transistor for variations in transistor characteristics and operating temperature. The gain of a transistor can vary significantly between different batches, which results in widely different operating points for sequential units in serial production or after replacement of a transistor. Due to the Early effect, the current gain is affected by the collector‚Äìemitter voltage. Both gain and base‚Äìemitter voltage depend on the temperature. The leakage current also increases with temperature. A bias network is selected to reduce effects of device variability, temperature, and voltage changes.Paul Horowitz, Winfield Hill, The Art of Electronics Second Edition, Cambridge University Press,1989, ,pp. 73-75 A bias circuit may be composed of only resistors, or may include elements such as temperature- dependent resistors, diodes, or additional voltage sources, depending on the range of operating conditions expected. =Signal requirements for class-A amplifiers= For analog operation of a class-A amplifier, the Q-point is placed so the transistor stays in active mode (does not shift to operation in the saturation region or cut-off region) when input is applied. For digital operation, the Q-point is placed so the transistor does the contrary ‚Äì switches from the \\"on\\" (saturation) to the \\"off\\" (cutoff) state. Often, the Q-point is established near the center of the active region of a transistor characteristic to allow similar signal swings in positive and negative directions. =Thermal considerations= At constant current, the voltage across the emitter‚Äìbase junction VBE of a bipolar transistor decreases by 2 mV (silicon) and 1.8 mV (germanium) for each 1 ¬∞C rise in temperature (reference being 25 ¬∞C). By the Ebers-Moll model, if the base-emitter voltage VBE is held constant and the temperature rises, the current through the base‚Äìemitter diode IB will increase, and thus the collector current IC will also increase. Depending on the bias point, the power dissipated in the transistor may also increase, which will further increase its temperature and exacerbate the problem. This deleterious positive feedback results in thermal runaway. There are several approaches to mitigate bipolar transistor thermal runaway. For example, * Negative feedback can be built into the biasing circuit so that increased collector current leads to decreased base current. Hence, the increasing collector current throttles its source. * Heat sinks can be used that carry away extra heat and prevent the base‚Äìemitter temperature from rising. * The transistor can be biased so that its collector is normally less than half of the power supply voltage, which implies that collector‚Äìemitter power dissipation is at its maximum value. Runaway is then impossible because increasing collector current leads to a decrease in dissipated power; this notion is known as the half-voltage principle. The circuits below primarily demonstrate the use of negative feedback to prevent thermal runaway.  Types of bias circuit for class-A amplifiers  The following discussion treats five common biasing circuits used with class-A bipolar transistor amplifiers: # Fixed bias # Collector-to-base bias # Fixed bias with emitter resistor # Voltage divider bias or potential divider # Emitter bias = Fixed bias (base bias) = Fixed bias (Base bias) This form of biasing is also called base bias or fixed resistance biasing. In the example image on the right, the single power source (for example, a battery) is used for both collector and base of a transistor, although separate batteries can also be used. In the given circuit, :Vcc = IbRb \\\\+ Vbe Therefore, :Ib = (Vcc ‚àí Vbe)/Rb For a given transistor, Vbe does not vary significantly during use. As Vcc is of fixed value, on selection of Rb, the base current Ib is fixed. Therefore, this type is called fixed bias type of circuit. Also, for the given circuit, :Vcc = IcRc \\\\+ Vce Therefore, :Vce = Vcc ‚àí IcRc The common-emitter current gain of a transistor is an important parameter in circuit design, and is specified on the data sheet for a particular transistor. It is denoted as Œ≤ on this page. Because :Ic = Œ≤Ib we can obtain Ic as well. In this manner, operating point given as (Vce,Ic) can be set for given transistor. Advantages: * It is simple to shift the operating point anywhere in the active region by merely changing the base resistor (Rb). * A very small number of components are required. Disadvantages: * The collector current does not remain constant with variation in temperature or power supply voltage. Therefore, the operating point is unstable. * Changes in Vbe will change IB and thus cause IE to change. This in turn will alter the gain of the stage. * When the transistor is replaced with another one, considerable change in the value of Œ≤ can be expected. Due to this change the operating point will shift. * For small-signal transistors (e.g., not power transistors) with relatively high values of Œ≤ (i.e., between 100 and 200), this configuration will be prone to thermal runaway. In particular, the stability factor, which is a measure of the change in collector current with changes in reverse saturation current, is approximately Œ≤+1. To ensure absolute stability of the amplifier, a stability factor of less than 25 is preferred, and so small-signal transistors have large stability factors. Usage: Due to the above inherent drawbacks, fixed bias is rarely used in linear circuits (i.e., those circuits which use the transistor as a current source). Instead, it is often used in circuits where the transistor is used as a switch. However, one application of fixed bias is to achieve crude automatic gain control in the transistor by feeding the base resistor from a DC signal derived from the AC output of a later stage. = Collector feedback bias = Collector-to-base bias This configuration employs negative feedback to prevent thermal runaway and stabilize the operating point. In this form of biasing, the base resistor R_{\\\\text{b}} is connected to the collector instead of connecting it to the DC source V_{\\\\text{cc}}. So any thermal runaway will induce a voltage drop across the R_{\\\\text{C}} resistor that will throttle the transistor's base current. From Kirchhoff's voltage law, the voltage V_{\\\\text{R}_{\\\\text{b}}} across the base resistor R_{\\\\text{b}} is :V_{\\\\text{R}_{\\\\text{b}}} = V_{\\\\text{cc}} \\\\, - \\\\, \\\\mathord{\\\\overbrace{(I_{\\\\text{c}} + I_{\\\\text{b}}) R_{\\\\text{c}}}^{\\\\text{Voltage drop across } R_{\\\\text{c}}}} \\\\, - \\\\, \\\\mathord{\\\\overbrace{V_{\\\\text{be}}}^{\\\\text{Voltage at base}}}. By the Ebers- Moll model, I_{\\\\text{c}} = \\\\beta I_{\\\\text{b}}, and so :V_{\\\\text{R}_{\\\\text{b}}} = V_{\\\\text{cc}} - (\\\\overbrace{\\\\beta I_{\\\\text{b}}}^{I_{\\\\text{c}}} + I_{\\\\text{b}}) R_{\\\\text{c}} - V_{\\\\text{be}} = V_{\\\\text{cc}} - I_{\\\\text{b}} (\\\\beta + 1) R_{\\\\text{c}} - V_{\\\\text{be}}. From Ohm's law, the base current I_{\\\\text{b}} = V_{\\\\text{R}_{\\\\text{b}}} / R_{\\\\text{b}}, and so :\\\\overbrace{I_{\\\\text{b}} R_{\\\\text{b}}}^{V_{\\\\text{R}_{\\\\text{b}}}} = V_{\\\\text{cc}} - I_{\\\\text{b}} (\\\\beta + 1) R_{\\\\text{c}} - V_{\\\\text{be}}. Hence, the base current I_{\\\\text{b}} is :I_{\\\\text{b}} = \\\\frac{ V_{\\\\text{cc}} - V_{\\\\text{be}} }{ R_{\\\\text{b}} + ( \\\\beta + 1 ) R_{\\\\text{c}} } If V_{\\\\text{be}} is held constant and temperature increases, then the collector current I_{\\\\text{c}} increases. However, a larger I_{\\\\text{c}} causes the voltage drop across resistor R_{\\\\text{c}} to increase, which in turn reduces the voltage V_{\\\\text{R}_{\\\\text{b}}} across the base resistor R_{\\\\text{b}}. A lower base- resistor voltage drop reduces the base current I_{\\\\text{b}}, which results in less collector current I_{\\\\text{c}}. Because an increase in collector current with temperature is opposed, the operating point is kept stable. Advantages: * Circuit stabilizes the operating point against variations in temperature and Œ≤ (i.e. replacement of transistor). * Circuit stabilizes the operating point (as a fraction of V_{\\\\text{cc}}) against variations in V_{\\\\text{cc}}. Disadvantages: * Although small changes in Œ≤ are OK, large changes in Œ≤ will greatly change the operating point. R_{\\\\text{b}} must be chosen once Œ≤ is known fairly accurately (perhaps within ~ 25%), yet the variability of Œ≤ between \\"identical\\" parts is often larger than this. * In this circuit, to keep I_{\\\\text{c}} independent of \\\\beta, the following condition must be met: ::I_{\\\\text{c}} = \\\\beta I_{\\\\text{b}} = \\\\frac { \\\\beta (V_{\\\\text{cc}} - V_{\\\\text{be}})}{R_{\\\\text{b}} + R_{\\\\text{c}} + \\\\beta R_{\\\\text{c}}} \\\\approx \\\\frac{(V_{\\\\text{cc}} - V_{\\\\text{be}})}{R_{\\\\text{c}}} which is the case when ::\\\\beta R_{\\\\text{c}} \\\\gg R_{\\\\text{b}}. *As \\\\beta-value is fixed (and generally unknown) for a given transistor, this relation can be satisfied either by keeping R_{\\\\text{c}} fairly large or making R_{\\\\text{b}} very low. ** If R_{\\\\text{c}} is large, a high V_{\\\\text{cc}} is necessary, which increases cost as well as precautions necessary while handling. ** If R_{\\\\text{b}} is low, the reverse bias of the collector-base region is small, which limits the range of collector voltage swing that leaves the transistor in active mode. * The resistor R_{\\\\text{b}} causes an AC feedback, reducing the voltage gain of the amplifier. This undesirable effect is a trade-off for greater Q-point stability. However, a T (R-C-R) network can be used to reduce the AC feedback, which however poses a heavier load on the collector than the simple feedback resistor. At higher frequencies a R-L feedback network can be used, however, it will introduce peaking into the frequency response at various points. Usage: The negative feedback also increases the input impedance of the amplifier as seen from the base, which can be advantageous. Due to the gain reduction from feedback, this biasing form is used only when the trade-off for stability is warranted. = Fixed bias with emitter resistor = Fixed bias with emitter resistor The fixed bias circuit is modified by attaching an external resistor to the emitter. This resistor introduces negative feedback that stabilizes the Q-point. From Kirchhoff's voltage law, the voltage across the base resistor is :: V_{R_b} = V_{cc} - I_e R_e - V_{be} From Ohm's law, the base current is ::I_b = \\\\frac {V_{R_b}}{R_b} The way feedback controls the bias point is as follows. If Vbe is held constant and temperature increases, emitter current increases. However, a larger Ie increases the emitter voltage Ve = IeRe, which in turn reduces the voltage VRb across the base resistor. A lower base-resistor voltage drop reduces the base current, which results in less collector current because Ic = Œ≤ Ib. Collector current and emitter current are related by Ic = Œ± Ie with Œ± ‚âà 1, so the increase in emitter current with temperature is opposed, and the operating point is kept stable. Similarly, if the transistor is replaced by another, there may be a change in Ic (corresponding to change in Œ≤-value, for example). By similar process as above, the change is negated and operating point kept stable. For the given circuit, ::I_b = \\\\frac { V_{cc} - V_{be} } { R_b + ( \\\\beta+1) R_e } Advantages: The circuit has the tendency to stabilize operating point against changes in temperature and Œ≤-value. Disadvantages: *In this circuit, to keep IC independent of Œ≤ the following condition must be met: ::I_C = \\\\beta I_b = \\\\frac { \\\\beta (V_{cc} - V_{be})}{R_b+ ( \\\\beta+1) R_e} \\\\approx \\\\frac {(V_{cc} - V_{be})}{R_e} which is approximately the case if ::(\\\\beta + 1)R_e \\\\gg R_b *As Œ≤-value is fixed for a given transistor, this relation can be satisfied either by keeping Re very large, or making RB very low. ** If Re is of large value, high Vcc is necessary. This increases cost as well as precautions necessary while handling. ** If Rb is low, a separate low voltage supply should be used in the base circuit. Using two supplies of different voltages is impractical. *In addition to the above, Re causes AC feedback which reduces the voltage gain of the amplifier. Usage: The feedback also increases the input impedance of the amplifier when seen from the base, which can be advantageous. Due to the above disadvantages, this type of biasing circuit is used only with careful consideration of the trade-offs involved. Collector-Stabilized Biasing. = Voltage divider biasing or emitter bias = Voltage divider bias The voltage divider is formed using external resistors R1 and R2. The voltage across R2 forward biases the emitter junction. By proper selection of resistors R1 and R2, the operating point of the transistor can be made independent of Œ≤. In this circuit, the voltage divider holds the base voltage fixed independent of base current, provided the divider current is large compared to the base current. However, even with a fixed base voltage, collector current varies with temperature (for example) so an emitter resistor is added to stabilize the Q-point, similar to the above circuits with emitter resistor. The voltage divider configuration achieves the correct voltages by the use of resistors in certain patterns. By manipulating the resistors in certain ways you can achieve more stable current levels without having Œ≤ value affect it too much. In this circuit the base voltage is given by: V_B = \\\\ voltage across R_2 \\\\ = V_{cc} \\\\frac{R_2}{(R_1+R_2)} - I_b \\\\frac{R_1 R_2}{(R_1+R_2)} :\\\\approx V_{cc} \\\\frac{R_2}{(R_1+R_2)} provided I_b << I_1 = V_b / R_1 \\\\ . Also V_B = V_{be} + I_eR_e \\\\ For the given circuit, :: I_b =\\\\frac { \\\\frac {V_{cc}}{1+R_1/R_2} \\\\- V_{be} } {( \\\\beta + 1)R_e + R_1 \\\\parallel R_2 } . Advantages: * Unlike above circuits, only one dc supply is necessary. * Operating point is almost independent of Œ≤ variation. * Operating point stabilized against shift in temperature. Disadvantages: *In this circuit, to keep IC independent of Œ≤ the following condition must be met: ::I_c = \\\\beta I_b = \\\\beta \\\\frac { \\\\frac {V_{cc}}{1+R_1/R_2} \\\\- V_{be} } {( \\\\beta + 1)R_e + R_1 \\\\parallel R_2 } \\\\approx \\\\frac { \\\\frac {V_{cc}}{1+R_1/R_2}- V_{be}} {R_e} , which is approximately the case if ::( \\\\beta + 1 ) R_e >> R_1 \\\\parallel R_2 where R1  R2 denotes the equivalent resistance of R1 and R2 connected in parallel. *As Œ≤-value is fixed for a given transistor, this relation can be satisfied either by keeping RE fairly large, or making R1R2 very low. ** If RE is of large value, high Vcc is necessary. This increases cost as well as precautions necessary while handling. ** If R1  R2 is low, either R1 is low, or R2 is low, or both are low. A low R1 raises Vb closer to Vc, reducing the available swing in collector voltage, and limiting how large Rc can be made without driving the transistor out of active mode. A low R2 lowers Vbe, reducing the allowed collector current. Lowering both resistor values draws more current from the power supply and lowers the input resistance of the amplifier as seen from the base. * AC as well as DC feedback is caused by Re, which reduces the AC voltage gain of the amplifier. A method to avoid AC feedback while retaining DC feedback is discussed below. Usage: The circuit's stability and merits as above make it widely used for linear circuits.  Voltage divider with AC bypass capacitor  Voltage divider with capacitor The standard voltage divider circuit discussed above faces a drawback ‚Äì AC feedback caused by resistor RE reduces the gain. This can be avoided by placing a capacitor (Ce) in parallel with Re, as shown in circuit diagram. The result is that the DC operating point is well controlled, while the AC-gain is much higher (approaching Œ≤), rather than the much lower (but predictable) value of R_{\\\\text{c}}/R_{\\\\text{e}} without the capacitor.  Emitter bias  Emitter bias When a split supply (dual power supply) is available, this biasing circuit is the most effective, and provides zero bias voltage at the emitter or collector for load. The negative supply Vee is used to forward-bias the emitter junction through Re. The positive supply Vcc is used to reverse- bias the collector junction. Only two resistors are necessary for the common collector stage and four resistors for the common emitter or common base stage. We know that, Vb ‚àí Ve = Vbe If Rb is small enough, base voltage will be approximately zero. Therefore, emitter current is, Ie = (Vee ‚àí Vbe)/Re The operating point is independent of Œ≤ if Re >> Rb/Œ≤ Advantages: Disadvantages: This type can only be used when a split (dual) power supply is available. Class-B and AB amplifiers =Signal requirements= Class B and AB amplifiers employ 2 active devices to cover the complete 360 deg of input signal flow. Each transistor is therefore biased to perform over approximately 180 deg of the input signal. Class B bias is when the collector current Ic with no signal is just conducting (about 1% of maximum possible value). Class- AB bias is when the collector current Ic is about 1/4 of maximum possible value. The class-AB push‚Äìpull output amplifier circuit below could be the basis for a moderate-power audio amplifier. A practical amplifier circuit A practical amplifier circuit Q3 is a common emitter stage that provides amplification of the signal and the DC bias current through D1 and D2 to generate a bias voltage for the output devices. The output pair are arranged in class-AB push‚Äìpull, also called a complementary pair. The diodes D1 and D2 provide a small amount of constant voltage bias for the output pair, just biasing them into the conducting state so that crossover distortion is minimized. That is, the diodes push the output stage into class-AB mode (assuming that the base-emitter drop of the output transistors is reduced by heat dissipation). This design automatically stabilizes its operating point, since overall feedback internally operates from DC up through the audio range and beyond. The use of fixed diode bias requires the diodes to be both electrically and thermally matched to the output transistors. If the output transistors conduct too much, they can easily overheat and destroy themselves, as the full current from the power supply is not limited at this stage. A common solution to help stabilize the output device operating point is to include some emitter resistors, typically an ohm or so. Calculating the values of the circuit's resistors and capacitors is done based on the components employed and the intended use of the amplifier.

Grant and Drake married a year after the film's release. Plot summary Department store salesclerk Anabel Sims (Betsy Drake) is very enamoured with the idea of getting married. So when handsome pediatrician Dr. Madison Brown (Cary Grant) asks for her help in making a purchase, she decides that he is the one for her. He is quite happy as a bachelor, but Anabel proves to be a very determined schemer. She learns all she can about him, everything from where he went to school to his favourite foods. Madison soon realises her intentions and does his best to fend off the young woman. Anabel makes a reservation at a restaurant on a day when she knows that Madison habitually dines there. In an attempt to make him jealous, she pretends to be waiting for wealthy, three- times-married playboy Roger Sanford (Franchot Tone), who happens to be her employer and Madison's university classmate. By chance, Roger shows up. Fortunately for her, Roger believes that she is using Madison as a ruse to get acquainted with him. However, the manoeuvre fails; Madison's feelings remain unchanged. Anabel comes up with more ingenious schemes, but they are all unsuccessful. However, Roger falls in love with her. He eventually asks her to marry him, but she only invites him to dinner at her home. When Anabel's best friend Julie (Diana Lynn) warns Madison, he begins to worry, knowing something of Roger's success with women. The doctor invites himself to the little soir√©e. While waiting for Anabel, they are unexpectedly joined by \\"Old Joe\\" (Eddie Albert), Anabel's longtime hometown beau, who announces that he and Anabel are finally going to get married. At first, Madison congratulates them, but after thinking about it, makes his own bid for her hand. Anabel leaves the decision up to Joe, who bows out, saying that he only wants her to be happy. After Joe leaves, Madison informs Anabel that her research on him was incomplete; he recognized \\"Joe's\\" voice as that of a radio performer he listens to frequently.

Nilsson as Saleslady * Eddie Albert as Harry Proctor, aka \\"Old Joe\\" (uncredited) Production Every Girl Should Be Married was based on a short story written by Eleanor Harris in an October 1947 edition of the Ladies' Home Journal. The film's lead actors, Cary Grant and Betsy Drake were married in real life one year after the film's release. Drake was Grant's third wife. Grant spotted Drake performing in a stage play in London called Deep are the Roots two years before the film's release. Grant was reportedly \\"intrigued by her talent and charm.\\" The couple met a year before the film's release aboard the luxury liner RMS Queen Mary traveling from England back to the United States, where they were formally introduced to each other on the liner by actress and fellow passenger Merle Oberon. Grant and Drake became friends and soon were romantically involved. Drake was a stage actress from America with no film credits to her name at that time, but Cary Grant convinced Dore Schary, head of production at RKO Pictures, to sign Drake to a contract with the company. Barbara Bel Geddes was initially intended to play Anabel Sims, but Grant and industrialist Howard Hughes wanted Drake to play the role. Grant made sure he had a say in anything that concerned Drake's performance from lighting to dialogue and used his influence on everyone involved with the film. According to Cary Grant's biographer Marc Eliot, Grant knew that acting on screen with Drake was a risky proposition and that the general public would rightly speculate that she had gotten the part only because she was his girlfriend. According to an interview with gossip columnist Hedda Hopper, Drake believed if everyone thought she had gotten her breakthrough because of Grant, then they were very wrong about him and her. She further suggested that Grant had simply made it possible for them to share a creative experience with their real-life chemistry. The film turned out to be a positive experience for both Grant and Drake, with the only downside being that Hughes insisting on becoming actively involved in every aspect of its production, with the result that Schary abruptly resigned from RKO. Hughes then allowed Grant to rewrite much of the script, and even to instruct director Don Hartman in how to shoot several scenes, so as to shift much of the film's visual emphasis from his character to Drake's. In the biography Cary Grant: The Lonely Heart, authors Charles Higham and Roy Mosely claimed that \\"Cary watched every move Betsy made on the set, endlessly checking her out, imitating her cruelly in scenes, and at times encouraging her ‚Äî mistakenly ‚Äî to imitate Katharine Hepburn's mannered playing. Reception Bosley Crowther of The New York Times praised Betsy Drake's performance, saying that she displays \\"a refreshingly natural comic spirit\\". Likewise, the weekly American entertainment trade magazine Variety described Drake's performance in the film as \\"a tour de force in the romantic comedy vein.\\" while calling the film \\"one of those rare comic delicacies that are always in good season.\\" Dennis Schwartz was more critical of the film and said, \\"Writer- director Don Hartman fails to get much comedy out of the comedy\\". The film was RKO's most lucrative production of 1948, making $775,000 in profits.Richard Jewell & Vernon Harbin, The RKO Story. New Rochelle, New York: Arlington House, 1982. p232 Grant and Drake reprised their roles in a Lux Radio Theatre broadcast held on 27 June 1949.

M√§rchen Spiele by Mathilde Wesendonck (published: D√ºsseldorf, 1864) Grave of Mathilde Wesendonck and family in Bonn, Germany Mathilde Wesendonck (23 December 182831 August 1902) was a German poet and author. The words of five of her verses were the basis of her friend Richard Wagner's Wesendonck Lieder. He may have been her paramour. Biography Agnes Mathilde Luckemeyer was born in Elberfeld (now part of Wuppertal) in the Rhineland of Germany in 1828. In 1848 she married the silk merchant Otto Wesendonck (sometimes erroneously seen as von Wesendonck). Otto was a great admirer of Wagner's music, and after he and Mathilde met the composer in Zurich in 1852, he placed a cottage on his estate at Wagner's disposal. By 1857, Wagner had become infatuated with Mathilde. It is not known whether she returned his affections to the same degree, or if the affair - if there was one - was ever consummated. Nevertheless, the episode inspired Wagner to put aside his work on Der Ring des Nibelungen (which would not be resumed for the next twelve years) and begin work on Tristan und Isolde. In 1858, Wagner's wife Minna intercepted a romantic letter from Wagner to Mathilde. After the resulting confrontation, Wagner left Z√ºrich alone, for Venice. Minna went to Dresden to stay with her family. She wrote to Mathilde before departing for Dresden: > \\"I must tell you with a bleeding heart that you have succeeded in separating > my husband from me after nearly twenty-two years of marriage. May this noble > deed contribute to your peace of mind, to your happiness.\\"Burck, John N, > Letters of Richard Wagner - The Burrell Collection, The Macmillan Company, > New York, 1950, page 374. In her autobiographical reminiscences Mathilde later wrote about Wagner's stay in Z√ºrich, but made no mention of troubles with Minna. In 1866 Mathilde met with Johannes Brahms in Z√ºrich and enabled him to study some of Wagner's manuscripts.Musgrave (2000), p. 56.

Function  This gene encodes a member of the G protein-coupled receptor (GPCR) superfamily. This protein functions as a cell surface receptor for bile acids. Treatment of cells expressing this GPCR with bile acids induces the production of intracellular cAMP, activation of a MAP kinase signaling pathway, and internalization of the receptor. The receptor is implicated in the suppression of macrophage functions and regulation of energy homeostasis by bile acids. One effect of this receptor is to activate deiodinases which convert the prohormone thyroxine (T4) to the active hormone triiodothyronine (T3). T3 in turn activates the thyroid hormone receptor which increases metabolic rate.

The Michigan State Spartans defeated the USC Trojans 20‚Äì17 in a bowl rematch that was much closer than the 27‚Äì13 Spartan victory in the regular season. Michigan State linebacker Percy Snow was named the Player of the Game.2008 Rose Bowl Program , 2008 Rose Bowl. Accessed January 26, 2008. This was the last Rose Bowl game televised by NBC Sports, ending a 37-year partnership. ABC Sports picked up rights to broadcast the game the following year. This was the Big Ten's first Rose Bowl win in seven years. Teams The teams opened the season against each other in East Lansing, Michigan in a nationally-televised game on Labor Day night. Michigan State took advantage of three USC turnovers to defeat the Trojans, 27‚Äì13. =Michigan State Spartans= Led by head coach George Perles, a former Pittsburgh Steelers assistant coach, Michigan State had its best team in many years. The Spartans beat traditional Big 10 powers Michigan and Ohio State, and won the Big Ten by 1¬Ω games over Indiana and Iowa, who tied for second place. They followed up the USC win by a 31‚Äì8 loss at Notre Dame, and then a 31‚Äì3 home loss to Florida State. The season got back on track with a 19‚Äì14 win at Iowa. A dramatic 17‚Äì11 win over in state rival Michigan occurred on October 10. On October 31, the Spartans defeated Ohio State, making this the first season since the 1966 National Championship when the Spartans defeated both Michigan and Ohio State. The Indiana Hoosiers also had beaten Michigan and Ohio State, and the meeting between Michigan State and Indiana on November 14 determined the Big Ten championship. Michigan State won 27‚Äì3 to clinch their first Rose Bowl appearance since the 1965 season. Note that they are the only team in college history to not only beat Big 10 powers Ohio State and Michigan in the same season, but also the USC Trojans twice. =USC Trojans= USC struggled early and was only 4‚Äì3 after seven games, but won its next three to set up a showdown with rival UCLA (9‚Äì1) for the Pac-10 title and Rose Bowl berth. The UCLA Bruins, with Troy Aikman at quarterback and Gaston Green at running back were favored, and led 13‚Äì0 at halftime. It could have been worse, as on the last play of the first half, UCLA's Eric Turner intercepted a deflected pass at the UCLA goal line and had nothing but green grass ahead of him as he appeared primed to return it for a touchdown. But USC QB Rodney Peete ran down Turner and tackled him at the 10-yard line as time expired. USC had cut the lead to 13‚Äì10, and then midway through the 4th quarter, quarterback Rodney Peete threw to WR Erik Afholter in the back of the end zone. Afholter juggled the ball atop his shoulder pad as he slid out the end zone; television replays indicated no possession but the referees ruled it a touchdown. Leading 17‚Äì13, USC then intercepted Aikman as he tried to lead UCLA back and ran out the clock. Game summary Rose Bowl records at the Hall of Champions The game was a rematch of the season opener in East Lansing that Michigan State won 27‚Äì13. The game was dominated by defense; the story was Michigan State linebacker and game most valuable player Percy Snow, who had 17 unassisted tackles, and four USC turnovers. The Spartans also had their 1988 All-American running back Lorenzo White proved to be a cut-back slashing workhorse with 35 carries for 113 yards by the start of 4th quarter . After USC tied the game early in the fourth quarter at 17, Michigan State marched to a game-winning field goal by John Langeloh with four minutes to play. The key play of the drive was a third down play in which Michigan State quarterback Bobby McAllister was nearly sacked, then scrambled and at the last instant found receiver Andre Rison at the sideline for a first down that kept the drive alive. USC had time to try to come back, and Trojan quarterback Rodney Peete led USC on a drive to the Spartan 29-yard line with two minutes to play. But Peete fumbled the next snap, Michigan State recovered, and the Spartans ran out the clock. Lorenzo White's performance in this game combined with his superb 4 year Career helped notch his recent January 2019 election to the College Football Hall of Fame .

Meteorological history On 19 January 1998, an area of low pressure developed over the Gulf of Carpentaria. Little development occurred as the system traveled initially towards the southwest and later towards the east. Late on 21 January, the low moved over the Cape York Peninsula and began to strengthen. A surge of moisture from a northwest monsoon and a tightening pressure gradient due to an area of high pressure located over the Great Australian Bight, allowed the system to develop. The first warning published by the Australian Bureau of Meteorology was issued on 23 January, after the storm had moved back over the Gulf of Carpentaria. Storm and impact The intense rainfall also occurred during \\"king high tides\\" in the Timor Sea that pushed water from the lower reaches upstream, as a result, floodwater drainage was impeded. Flooding was most severe in Katherine, Northern Territory, where flooding began 24 January. Many residents were evacuated to cyclone shelters, while several others were stranded on rooftops. On Australia Day, 26 January, roads north and south from Katherine were closed due to rising floodwaters, and Royal Australian Air Force personnel from RAAF Base Tindal joined local police and emergency services to assist with sandbagging critical infrastructure. Some 5000 residents were evacuated as an estimated 500 businesses and 1200 homes were inundated by floodwaters, including the Katherine District Hospital. On 27 January, a state of emergency was declared for Katherine as the Katherine River reached a level of 20.3 m (66.6 ft). The floodwaters peaked at at the Katherine railway bridge, passing the previous record of 19.3m during major flooding in 1957. Two days later, 392 residents were evacuated from the Daly River region, approximately downstream from Katherine, where floodwaters had risen above 11.5m and would continue to rise to a peak of on 3 February. The cyclone dumped over 380mm of rainfall in the area within a 48-hour period, leaving water up to 2 m (6.5 ft) through much of the town. The flooding forced at least 2,000 people out of their homes, and killed 3 people. Total damages from the storm amounted to at least A$100 million (US$64.7 million). Additionally, local infrastructure was severely damaged by the storm. During the flood emergency, the only road access between Darwin and the rest of Australia was impassable for five days. Drainage and sewerage systems failed, leading to an outbreak of gastroenteritis. When the flood waters receded, priority was given to making critical facilities such as the hospital operational once again, with 300 additional Australian Defence Force personnel arriving to assist with the clean-up. Aftermath Through the Appropriation (Flood Relief) Bill (1998) the Northern Territory Government released $10 million of funds for immediate flood relief. It was estimated at this time that at least $30 million would be required for capital works reconstruction, and a similar amount to be allocated to supporting business and individuals. It was expected this amount would be met by the Commonwealth Government. The Northern Territory Government conducted studies in the area in the years following the disaster to learn how better to prepare for major flood events, and now makes flood maps and information brochures available to the public as well as other early warning systems such as flood sirens and live webcams monitoring the river. On 30 January, Prime Minister of Australia John Howard visited Katherine, announcing measures including disaster relief payments of $1000 for each adult and $200 for each child affected by the flooding, the creation of a taskforce to investigate problems faced by those who were not insured for flooding as well as $5 million in funding for repairs and improvements to the Stuart Highway. The economic impact of the disaster on the town of Katherine was significant. Of the estimated $200 million damages, only $70 million was insured and many local businesses were forced to close. The pastoral industry, worth over $60 million annually to the region was badly affected by the loss of whole herds of livestock to the rising waters. A study conducted by the School for Social and Policy Research at Charles Darwin University in 2008 analysed trends in census data before and after the disaster and found that the population had not yet recovered to pre-flood levels ten years after the event, and the demographics in the town had shifted significantly. In 2008, the Katherine Town Council submitted to Infrastructure Australia documents outlining the approximate costing and importance of relocating the town's hospital and ambulance station to a less flood-prone area following the total evacuation and inundation of both facilities during the 1998 and 2006 flood events.

The band was founded while they were in their freshman and junior years in high school. Drawing influence from Nirvana, The Unicorns, The Beatles, Electric Light Orchestra and Andrew W.K. the two created a messy mix of garage and punk, later evolving into a dance-able pop band. Don't Stop Believin' Records(Seattle), a like-minded local record label released a collection of home demos titled \\"B.F.F.\\" with Scott singing and playing guitar, Joey Seward playing keyboards and bass, and Brendhan playing drums. After graduating high school on Vashon, they moved to Seattle and Olympia. They continued to play while Brendhan attended Evergreen State College in Olympia, Washington. They first reached local prominence in 2005, after completing their first United States tour with Kimya Dawson of the Moldy Peaches. Throughout most of the tour, they performed as her backing band. In early 2006 recording sessions began at a Freemason Temple in Seattle. After a few weeks the project was permanently shelved. They instead spent the year with more touring following the release of the Overcast Summer 7\\" EP. They performed at Plan-It-X Fest in July of this year. 2006 also saw the departure of Joey Seward and his subsequent replacement by keyboardist Stefan Rubicz and bass player Ryan Thompson. Not long after Joey's departure he soon joined both Kay Kay and His Weathered Underground as well as Doomhawk. By the beginning of 2007, they had released the Abominable 7\\" on Chicago label Tic Tac Totally. It featured the song \\"Tropical Yeti Song\\" which was accompanied by a music video. They toured frequently throughout the rest of the year, performing at several music festivals including Bumbershoot, Capitol Hill Block Party and the Seattle Weekly Reverb Festival. In September bassist Ryan Thompson was kicked out of the band amid the recording sessions for Choose Yr Own Adventure. In January 2009 they re-located to New Orleans, Louisiana, where they recorded Weekend in a house that they shared, on a Tascam 4-track. The Weekend LP was released by Don't Stop Believin' Records, and in Europe by Seayou Records (Austria). In September 2009, the Pharmacy played the New Island Festival on Governors Island in New York Harbor. The Pharmacy has toured Europe three times, playing shows in over 18 countries. In 2008, a split 7\\" with Japanther was released by Austrian label Bachelor Records . In May 2010 they played at Yo Garage in Monterrey, Mexico during a 5 month long tour of the US/Europe. In January 2011 they played at the Rock & Roll Circus at Lincoln Center. In 2011 the band released their well received 7\\" EP, \\"Dig Your Grave\\" via Kind Turkey Records, Bobby Hussy's (The Hussy, Fire Heads, Cave Curse, TIT) record label based in Madison, WI.http://www.thestranger.com/lineout/archives/2012/01/30/the-pharmacy-dig- your-grave They currently live in Seattle. Scott Yoder also performs/records in a side-project called Fuzzy Cloaks with fellow Pharmacy member Stefan Rubicz.

United States, 320 U.S. 549 (1944), was a case in which the Supreme Court of the United States held that a draft board's alleged error in classifying a Jehovah's Witness as a conscientious objector rather than a minister of religion is no defense to the board's order to report for national service; post-reporting review of the classification is sufficient due process.. Background When the Selective Service and Training Act was passed in September 1940, most of the world was at war. The preamble of the Act declared it 'imperative to increase and train the personnel of the armed forces of the United States.' The danger of attack by enemies, if not imminent, was real, as subsequent events would grimly demonstrate. Congress was faced with the urgent necessity of integrating all the nation's people and forces for national defense. The petitioner was indicted on November 12, 1942, in a federal District Court in Pennsylvania for knowingly failing to perform a duty required of him under the Selective Training and Service Act of 1940. The particular charge was that after his local board had classified him as a conscientious objector, he wilfully failed to obey the board's order to report for assignment to work of national importance. Admitting that his refusal to obey the order was wilful, the petitioner defended his conduct on the ground that he was entitled to a statutory exemption from all forms of national service since the facts he had presented to the board showed that he was a 'regular or duly ordained' minister. Prior history The result of the trial was a conviction and sentence to imprisonment for five years. On appeal, the petitioner urged that the District Court had erred in refusing to permit a trial de novo on the merits of his claimed exemption. In the alternative, he argued that at least, the Court should have reviewed the classification order to ascertain whether the local board had been 'prejudicial, unfair, and arbitrary' in that it had failed to admit certain evidence that he offered, had acted on the basis of an antipathy to the religious sect of which he is a member, and had refused to classify him as a minister, despite the overwhelming weight of the evidence. Decision The Circuit Court of Appeals affirmed the District Court per curiam, and the Supreme Court agreed. Dissenting opinion Justice Murphy wrote a dissenting opinion: > Common sense and justice dictate that a citizen accused of a crime should > have the fullest hearing possible, plus the opportunity to present every > reasonable defense. Only an unenlightened jurisprudence condemns an > individual without according him those rights. Such a denial is especially > oppressive where a full hearing might disclose that the administrative > action underlying the prosecution is the product of excess wartime emotions. > Experience demonstrates that in time of war individual liberties cannot > always be entrusted safely to uncontrolled administrative discretion.

Preliminary psychopharmacological research in 1978 was unable to conclusively determine the compound's classification in regards to dopamine-receptor activity. On one hand, investigative studies found evidence of behavior traditionally associated with dopamine-receptor stimulation: stereotypy, increase in spontaneous motor activity, inhibition of conditioned avoidance response, and an increase in pain sensitivity resulting in an inhibition of morphine analgesia. On the other hand, these early investigative studies also found evidence of behavior traditionally associated with dopamine-receptor blockade: decrease of spontaneous motor activity, chills, catalepsy, trance-like states of consciousness. Nuciferine may also potentiate morphine analgesia. The median lethal dose in mice is 289 mg/kg. It is structurally related to apomorphine.Spess, David L. Errors in Alkaloids of Nelumbo and Nymphaea species, 2011, academia.edu Nuciferine has been reported to have various anti-inflammatory effects. Specific tests found nuciferine to reduce inflammation on lipopolysaccharide (LPS)-stimulated BV2 microglia cells. Researchers proposed that Nuciferine may have activated PPAR-y pathways to inhibit inflammation. More research into these pathways is necessary for a conclusive model for the anti-inflammatory response seen in laboratory studies. Nuciferine is a potential treatment for liver disease in Type-2 diabetic patients. In diabetic animal models with a high-fat diet, Nuciferine reversed liver damage. The underlying mechanism is unclear. The method of administration was a simple food additive. Culinary methods of preparing lotus flower (a botanical source of naturally-occurring Nuciferine) make this a potentially viable preventive method to prevent liver damage with diet. Nuciferine's ability to penetrate the blood brain barrier, makes it an interesting candidate for treating diseases of the brain. Various anti-tumor and anti-viral pharmacological properties have been investigated. Nuciferine was shown to inhibit the progression of glioblastoma cancer cells by suppressing the SOX2-AKT/STAT3 signaling pathway in animal models. Targeting SOX-2 pathways in human models with Nuciferine may offer a novel therapeutic approach for cancer treatment. Nuciferine has shown efficacy as a treatment for premature ejaculation and erectile dysfunction. The unique properties of this compound correlate with poetry for the botanical sources Nymphaea caerulea and Nelumbo nucifera. These traditionally sacred plants are used in spiritual rituals for healing and enlightenment. In Egyptian mystic art, it's referred to as Sacred Lotus of the Nile. In Buddhist mystic art, it's referred to as the utpala. A comprehensive scientific model of consciousness has yet to be determined. Testing the effects of Nymphaea caerulea and spirit communication is difficult to model for scientific laboratory studies. Sleep Studies may provide a model to test these unique psychopharmacological features.

Thomas (October 30, 1830 ‚Äì December 15, 1885) was an American bartender who owned and operated saloons in New York City. Because of his pioneering work in popularizing cocktails across the United States as well, he is considered \\"the father of American mixology.\\"Pete Wells, Frost on the Sun: Summertime Cocktails, New York Times, June 21, 2006. In addition to writing the seminal work on cocktails, Bar-Tender's Guide, Thomas displayed creativity and showmanship while preparing drinks and established the image of the bartender as a creative professional.William Grimes, The Bartender Who Started It All, New York Times, October 31, 2007. As such, he was often nicknamed \\"Professor\\" Jerry Thomas. Early life, education and work Thomas was born about 1830 in Sackets Harbor, New York. (His 1885 obituary in the New York Times said 1832.) As a young man, he learned bartending in New Haven, Connecticut before sailing for California during its mid-19th century Gold Rush.William Grimes, CRITIC'S NOTEBOOK; \\"Shaken, Stirred or Mixed, The Gilded Age Lives Again\\", New York Times, March 26, 2003. While in California, Thomas worked as a bartender, gold prospector and minstrel show manager. According to his 1885 obituary, he was left some money by his father, which helped in these travels. Saloon keeper and bartender Thomas moved back to the East Coast in 1851, settling in New York City. He opened a saloon below Barnum's American Museum; it would be the first of four saloons he would run in New York City over his lifetime. After running this first bar, Thomas went on the road for several years, working as the head bartender at hotels and saloons in St. Louis, Missouri; Chicago, Illinois; San Francisco, California; Charleston, South Carolina; and New Orleans, Louisiana. At one point he toured Europe, carrying along a set of solid-silver bar tools. He was well known for his showmanship as a bartender: he developed elaborate and flashy techniques of mixing cocktails, sometimes while juggling bottles, cups and mixers. He often wore flashy jewelry and had his bar tools and cups embellished with precious stones and metals. At the Occidental Hotel in San Francisco, Thomas was earning $100 a week‚Äîmore than the Vice President of the United States. =Bar- Tender's Guide= In 1862, Thomas finished Bar-Tender's Guide (alternately titled How to Mix Drinks or The Bon-Vivant's Companion), the first drink book ever published in the United States. The book collected and codified what was then an oral tradition of recipes from the early days of cocktails, including some of his own creations; the guide laid down the principles for formulating mixed drinks of all categories. He would update it several times in his lifetime to include new drinks that he discovered or created.John Hodgman, All Shaken Up, New York Times, October 17, 2004. The first edition of the guide included the first written recipes of such cocktails as the Brandy Daisy, Fizz, Flip, Sour and variations of the earliest form of mixed drink, Punch. The 1876 edition included the first written recipe for the Tom Collins, which appeared just after The Tom Collins Hoax of 1874. =San Francisco & the Blue Blazer= Thomas developed his signature drink, the Blue Blazer, at the El Dorado gambling saloon in San Francisco.This notion is being challenged since no contemporary (to Jerry Thomas) historical evidence, or other, exists that proves or hints that Thomas was in San Francisco during the Gold Rush. Guillermo Toro-Lira. ‚ÄúEl Dorado‚Äôs Jerry Thomas Mystery Explained‚Äù, December 30, 2010. Re-published and retrieved on April 18, 2020. The drink is made by lighting whiskey afire and passing it back and forth between two mixing glasses, creating an arc of flame.Recipe: \\"Blue Blazer\\", New York Times, October 31, 2007. Thomas continued to develop new drinks throughout his life.IN AND ABOUT THE CITY; \\"A NOTED SALOON KEEPER DEAD.\\", New York Times, 16 December 1885. Note: The obituary says that he was born in 1832 and was later left money by his father. His mixing of the \\"Martinez\\", which recipe was published in the 1887 edition of his guide, has sometimes been viewed as a precursor to the modern martini. Thomas claimed to have invented the Tom and Jerry and did much to popularize it in the United States; however, the history of the drink predated him. =In New York City= Upon returning to New York City, he became head bartender at the Metropolitan hotel. In 1866 he opened his own bar again, on Broadway between 21st and 22nd Streets, which became his most famous establishment. Thomas was one of the first to display the drawings of Thomas Nast. In his saloon he hung Nast's caricatures of the political and theatrical figures; one notable drawing, now lost, was of Thomas \\"in nine tippling postures colossally.\\" The saloon included funhouse mirrors. This historic bar has been adapted for use as a Restoration Hardware store. Thomas was an active man about town, a flashy dresser who was fond of kid gloves and his gold Parisian watch. He enjoyed going to bare-knuckle prize fights, and was an art collector. He enjoyed traveling. By middle age he was married and had two daughters. Always a good sport, at 205 pounds he was one of the lighter members of the Fat Men's Association. He had a side interest in gourds; at one point in the late 1870s, Thomas served as president of The Gourd Club after producing the largest specimen.The Gourd Club, New York Times, May 10, 1878. =Later years and death= Toward the end of his life, Thomas tried speculating on Wall Street, but bad judgments rendered him broke. He had to sell his successful saloon and auction off his considerable art collection; he tried opening a new bar but was unable to maintain the level of popularity as his more famous location. He died in New York City of a stroke (apoplexy) in 1885 at the age of 55. His death was marked by substantial obituaries across the United States. The New York Times obituary noted that Thomas was \\"at one time better known to club men and men about town than any other bartender in this city, and he was very popular among all classes.\\" He is interred at Woodlawn Cemetery in the Bronx, New York City. Bibliography Thomas is known to have authored two books: How to Mix Drinks, or The Bon- Vivant's Companion (originally published in 1862, with new and updated editions in 1876, and again posthumously in 1887) and Portrait Gallery of Distinguished Bar-Keepers (originally published in 1867 and considered a lost book).

It avoided the notion of space and time by replacing it with abstract mathematical properties of the S-matrix. In S-matrix theory, the S-matrix relates the infinite past to the infinite future in one step, without being decomposable into intermediate steps corresponding to time-slices. This program was very influential in the 1960s, because it was a plausible substitute for quantum field theory, which was plagued with the zero interaction phenomenon at strong coupling. Applied to the strong interaction, it led to the development of string theory. S-matrix theory was largely abandoned by physicists in the 1970s, as quantum chromodynamics was recognized to solve the problems of strong interactions within the framework of field theory. But in the guise of string theory, S-matrix theory is still a popular approach to the problem of quantum gravity. The S-matrix theory is related to the holographic principle and the AdS/CFT correspondence by a flat space limit. The analog of the S-matrix relations in AdS space is the boundary conformal theory. The most lasting legacy of the theory is string theory. Other notable achievements are the Froissart bound, and the prediction of the pomeron.  History  S-matrix theory was proposed as a principle of particle interactions by Werner Heisenberg in 1943, following John Archibald Wheeler's 1937 introduction of the S-matrix. It was developed heavily by Geoffrey Chew, Steven Frautschi, Stanley Mandelstam, Vladimir Gribov, and Tullio Regge. Some aspects of the theory were promoted by Lev Landau in the Soviet Union, and by Murray Gell-Mann in the United States.  Basic principles  The basic principles are: # Relativity: The S-matrix is a representation of the Poincar√© group; # Unitarity: S S^{\\\\dagger} = 1; # Analyticity: integral relations and singularity conditions. The basic analyticity principles were also called analyticity of the first kind, and they were never fully enumerated, but they include # Crossing: The amplitudes for antiparticle scattering are the analytic continuation of particle scattering amplitudes. # Dispersion relations: the values of the S-matrix can be calculated by integrals over internal energy variables of the imaginary part of the same values. # Causality conditions: the singularities of the S-matrix can only occur in ways that don't allow the future to influence the past (motivated by Kramers‚ÄìKronig relations) # Landau principle: Any singularity of the S-matrix corresponds to production thresholds of physical particles.Yuri V. Kovchegov, Eugene Levin, Quantum Chromodynamics at High Energy, Cambridge University Press, 2012, p. 313. These principles were to replace the notion of microscopic causality in field theory, the idea that field operators exist at each spacetime point, and that spacelike separated operators commute with one another.  Bootstrap models  The basic principles were too general to apply directly, because they are satisfied automatically by any field theory. So to apply to the real world, additional principles were added. The phenomenological way in which this was done was by taking experimental data and using the dispersion relations to compute new limits. This led to the discovery of some particles, and to successful parameterizations of the interactions of pions and nucleons. This path was mostly abandoned, because the resulting equations, devoid of any space-time interpretation, were very difficult to understand and solve.  Regge theory  The principle behind the Regge theory hypothesis (also called analyticity of the second kind or the bootstrap principle) is that all strongly interacting particles lie on Regge trajectories. This was considered the definitive sign that all the hadrons are composite particles, but within S-matrix theory, they are not thought of as being made up of elementary constituents. The Regge theory hypothesis allowed for the construction of string theories, based on bootstrap principles. The additional assumption was the narrow resonance approximation, which started with stable particles on Regge trajectories, and added interaction loop by loop in a perturbation series. String theory was given a Feynman path-integral interpretation a little while later. The path integral in this case is the analog of a sum over particle paths, not of a sum over field configurations. Feynman's original path integral formulation of field theory also had little need for local fields, since Feynman derived the propagators and interaction rules largely using Lorentz invariance and unitarity.

Modern Asian Studies 34: 57‚Äì98. On 30 August 1917, an eclectic band of political prisoners, common criminals and insubordinate prison guards mutinied at the Thai Nguyen Penitentiary, the largest one in the region. The rebels came from over thirty provinces and according to estimates, involved at some point roughly 300 civilians, 200 ex-prisoners and 130 prison guards.Zinoman (2000), p.57. The initial success of the rebels was short- lived.

See also Hodgkin, p.214. Both Quyen and Can have since been accorded legendary status as nationalist heroes.Hodgkin, p.214. Background The Thai Nguyen area had already seen resistance from men such as De Tham (1858‚Äì1913). David Marr characterises earlier traditional anti-colonial rebellions before the Thai Nguyen uprising such as the Can Vuong movement (Save the King) as being led by scholar-gentry whose followings were limited to members of their own lineages and villages.Marr, p.53. Leaders of these movements were ineffective in mobilising the general population beyond the scope of their influence, and in liaison and coordinating military or strategic activities on a wider scale in other provinces and regions. Marr argues that the generation of anti-colonial Vietnamese leaders Phan B·ªôi Ch√¢u and Phan Ch√¢u Trinh after 1900 succeeded in raising questions of long-term modernization and Westernization when they were disillusioned with the mandarin class whose collaboration with the French perpetuated its rule.Marr, p.275. This generation then looked towards outward influences such as the ƒê√¥ng Du Movement (where Luong Ngoc Quyen, a protagonist of the Thai Nguyen uprising, was a participant) for alternatives. As the Thai Nguyen uprising occurred in the same period of analysis, the goals of the uprising could be situated amidst this desire for change, whilst still searching for a 'modern' Vietnamese national-consciousness and identity. According to Zinoman, the Thai Nguyen Rebellion was especially noteworthy due to the role which prisons, a product of the colonial era, played in bringing together men from different walks of life to unite for a common purpose.Zinoman (2000), pg 58.  Sequence of events  While imprisoned in Thai Nguyen, Quyen got to know that Can, one of the Vietnamese sergeants in the local garrison, had considerable experience operating in the Thai Nguyen area and had been plotting an uprising for years.Marr, p.234. Quyen convinced Can that if an uprising was sparked, reinforcements will arrive to support the rebellion. They aborted two plots to rebel in May and July 1917 for unclear reasons. For the third attempt, the plotters decided to strike after hearing rumours that some of them were to be transferred.Marr, p.234. On August 30, 1917, Vietnamese guards first assassinated M. Noel, the Brigade Commander. While Can asked roughly 150 guards assembled in the barracks to join in the rebellion, another group released 220 prisoners in the penitentiary. Can discussed and agreed with Quyen's strategy to hold the town until reinforcements arrive.This was despite the alternative strategy presented by the lieutenants of Ho√†ng Hoa Th√°m (De Tham), who was a deceased leader of an outlaw band that was anti-French and provided support to urban anti-colonial activist Phan Boi Chau. De Tham favoured abandoning the town and launching attacks on nearby French outposts. Quyen was expecting reinforcements from De Tham's band and the Viet Nam Restoration League to arrive later and buttress the insurgency. See Zinoman (2000), p.79 and Marr, p.235. The rebels then seized weapons from the provincial arsenal, smashed the communication equipment, plundered the provincial treasury, took up strategic positions in the town,These locations included the courthouse, treasury and post-office. established a fortified perimeter and executed French officials and local collaborators. On the second day, the rebels went out to the streets of Thai Nguyen and announced a proclamation appealing to the population to support a general uprising.The English translation of the proclamation can be found in L√¢m, Truong Buu. Colonialism Experienced: Vietnamese Writings on Colonialism, 1900‚Äì1931. Ann Arbor, Mich: University of Michigan, 2000. An estimated 300 poor civilians joined roughly 200 ex-prisoners and 130 guards, and the rebels were divided into two battalions.The guards formed one battalion while the second group of political prisoners and civilians was led by Ba Chi, a lieutenant previously under De Tham. For the next five days, the rebels defended Thai Nguyen against heavy French artillery attacks. Following a French bombing on September 4, the rebels retreated into the countryside after suffering heavy casualties amidst chaos. Quyen was found dead, apparently having been killed in action, while Can fled to the Tam ƒê·∫£o Mountains with some rebels and eluded their pursuers. Months later, in January 1918, Can reportedly committed suicide to avoid capture. In French accounts, Can's buried corpse was found through an informant/defector named Si who claimed to have killed Can so as to be pardoned by the French.Zinoman (2000), pp.66‚Äì67. Bent on convincing the Vietnamese populace that revolt was futile, the French were meticulous in tracking down the rebel leaders and claimed only five men eluded \\"justice\\".Marr, p.236.  Participants  =Prison guards= Leader of the rebel guards Trinh Van Can was the son of an impoverished rural labourer from mountainous Vinh-Yen province. Can joined the Garde Indigene (native gendarmerie) as a youth and served his entire adult life on the remote Tonkinese frontier guarding prisoners and fighting bandits for the French.A confirmed opium addict and heavy gambler, Can was rumoured to be illiterate. Zinoman (2000), p.64. According to historian Tran Huy Lieu,Tran Huy Lieu (1901‚Äì1969) was the Democratic Republic of Vietnam's preeminent historian during the 1950s and 1960s. Lieu was a writer, revolutionary activist, historian and journalist in Vietnam. He held various senior leadership positions (such as the Minister of Communications and Information) in the first government of North Vietnam. See :vi:Tr·∫ßn Huy Li·ªáu Can's rebellious tendencies were shaped by his admiration of De Tham, having failed to track down De Tham's bandit gang in the mountainous and forestry terrain in Tonkin. Can's father had reportedly participated in the C·∫ßn V∆∞∆°ng movement in the 1880s. Can reportedly contemplated an uprising for years.Marr, pp.234‚Äì236. He spotted the opportunity when the French had grown preoccupied with the war in Europe. =Political prisoners= The leading Vietnamese anti-colonial party of the early 20th century was the Vietnam Restoration League (VNRL) (Vi·ªát Nam Quang ph·ª•c H·ªôi) founded by Phan B·ªôi Ch√¢u in 1912. VNRL was involved in several anti-colonial attacks including the Duy Tan plot, a failed attempt to revive the monarchist insurgency.Marr, pp.216‚Äì221. French suppression of VNRL led to influx of political activists into the colonial prison system. Amongst other VNRL figures held in Thai Nguyen, such as Nguyen Gia Cau (Hoi Xuan), Vu Si Lap (Vu Chi) and Ba Con (Ba Nho)Zinoman (2000), p.83. Quyen was the most prominent as he was the eldest son of the reformist mandarin Luong Van Can and the first Vietnamese participant in the ƒê√¥ng Du Movement.Phan had praised Quyen in his memoirs as the 'most admirable' of all Vietnamese students in Japan. See Zinoman (2000), pp. 61‚Äì63. Due to his conviction of involvement in a 1913 bombing attack at Phu Tho, Quyen had been sentenced to hard labor for life and transferred to the Thai Nguyen penitentiary in July 1916. Quyen played a crucial role in the rebellion's execution. First, Can deferred to him on military strategy to undertake upon the outbreak of the uprising. Second, Quyen probably provided ideological direction for the rebellion as he was likely the author of the rebellion's proclamation that appealed to popular imaginings of Vietnamese nationalist histories whose symbolic references were characteristic of VNRL discourse. These include the notions that Vietnamese nation descended from \\"a race of dragons and fairies\\", Vietnamese landscape as fertile and \\"covered with magnificent mountains\\", Vietnam's long history (4000 years), dynasties rule and sacrifices expended \\"in order to maintain possession of this land\\".L√¢m, Truong Buu. Colonialism Experienced: Vietnamese Writings on Colonialism, 1900‚Äì1931. Ann Arbor, Mich: University of Michigan, 2000. During the rebellion, the rebels hoisted the VNRL flag (five-star red and yellow flag) in the barracks and banners around town proclaimed \\"Annamese Armies Will Reclaim the Country\\".Zinoman (2000), p.83. Various visual symbols (flags, banners, armbands) displayed by the rebels indicated the uprising's close link to VNRL. =Followers of De Tham= Thai Nguyen is located in the middle region of Tonkin and vulnerable to frontier banditry given its proximity to the poorly policed Sino-Vietnamese border.Political disorder in China added to the lawlessness in the middle region given the porous borders. Its mountainous topography also provided shelter and refuge for fugitives, smugglers, brigands and military deserters. The area had been the focus of resistance since the days when De Tham and his brigands had been active.Hodgkin, p.213. Unable to control the banditry that plagued the frontier, Vietnamese officials allied with powerful local bandit chiefs to control the smaller rivals and maintain civil order. The French assumed power in Tonkin in 1884 and collaborated with Luong Tam Ky, leader of the Yellow Flags who took twenty years to catch and kill De Tham.Zinoman (2000), p.78. Given the history of banditry in the middle region, the penal population of Thai Nguyen consisted mainly of gang members and rural brigands. Dozens of De Tham's followers were imprisoned at Thai Nguyen. One notable lieutenant of De Tham, Nguyen Van Chi (Ba Chi) played an important role in the rebellion, having led one of the battalions of the rebels. These persons had intimate knowledge of the local terrain and were used to hit-and-run tactics of banditry. =Petty criminals and civilian rebels= In Thai Nguyen, French companies discovered coal fields and zinc deposits and encountered difficulty in recruiting a local labour force. Transient workers from China became an erratic substitute for employment working at the local mines. Employment contracts were unstable and this in turn was linked to the growth in criminal activities amongst many ex-mine workers and many of them landed up in the Thai Nguyen prison. In the rebellion, roughly three hundred townspeople voluntarily joined with rebels. This group of civilian rebels were believed to be from the most destitute inhabitants of the province (petty criminals, day-labourers, etc.) prone to persuasion of illegal pursuits and rebellion for survival.Zinoman (2000), p.81.  Causes  =The ill-disciplined prison= In Peter Zinoman's study of the colonial prison system in Vietnam (1862‚Äì1940),Zinoman, Peter. (2001). The colonial Bastille: a history of imprisonment in Vietnam, 1862‚Äì1940. Berkeley, University of California Press. he situates prisons as decentralized and autonomous institutions ran in different territories in Annam, Tonkin, Cochinchina, Cambodia and Laos due to different legal and administrative frameworks, low budgets, and unprofessional staff (divided into small European administrative elite and a large corps of Vietnamese warders) running the prisons. Zinoman argues that the colonial prison was ill-disciplined. The rehabilitative orientation within colonial punishment was absent as there was no discernible effort to reform the prisoners by discipline or provision of \\"total care\\". Prisoners experienced communal living and social mixing, with little segregation premised on a classificatory and differentiating system.Even with the introduction of Article 91 of the Indochinese criminal code in the 1890s that sought to differentiate political offences with other crimes, prisoners were still subjected to a common regime. With the rise in prisoner population including hardened criminals, the French authority upgraded the Thai Nguyen prison to a penitentiary but due to budgetary constraints and other factors, the prison institution at Thai Nguyen functioned as a provincial prison and penitentiary simultaneously. The majority of prisoners, regardless of their length of sentences, were not separated but housed in a single communal ward, except for some solitary cells housing especially dangerous convicts like Quyen. Despite recognising the flaws of institutional design of the penitentiary, the French did not undertake the necessary rectifications. The prison experience encompassed living in squalid, unhygienic quarters plagued that drove up rates of infections and mortality, and backbreaking prisoner labour that could be life-threatening and subjection to abuse by guards. Under such adverse conditions, Zinoman argues the incarceration experience intensified prisoners' sensations of being interconnected, built strength and confidence of character, and the will to fight against the colonial state responsible for this injustice. In Thai Nguyen, all prisoners were subjected to the brutal regime of forced and dangerous labour of building roads and construction of public works, unsanitary conditions, abuses and beatings resulting in a high number of deaths. Colonial records show a medical report that compared the number of deaths in colonial penal institutions during the five-year period (1908‚Äì1912) and there were more prisoners who died at Thai Nguyen (332) than elsewhere except for in Nam Dinh (355).Zinoman (2000), p.90. This fostered a shared predicament and desperation amongst prisoners that rebellion was believed to be the only chance of escape from brink of death in the penitentiary.Zinoman also studied the rise in numbers and case studies of prison revolts (such as Poulo Condore 1918 and Lai Chau 1927) and attributed such phenomena to distrust of the colonial legal and juridical system, harsh and erratic local administrative systems, organization of prison labour, and attacks on prisons led from outside forces (secret societies, peasants). =Provincial resident Darles= Darles was a notorious autocrat and much- hated officialDarles was portrayed pejoratively in both colonial records and Vietnamese accounts. See Zinoman (2000), pp.91‚Äì95. who terrorised the prisoners, guards and native civil servants in the penitentiary during his three-year service in the province. He was sadistically brutal, hitting the natives and punishing prisoners at will for slight reasons. His indiscriminate violent treatment of his staff drew the guards towards the prisoners in their common hatred of Darles and the administration. At the start of the rebellion, a group of guards had tried to capture Darles from his office and house but was unsuccessful.  French versus Vietnamese accounts of the uprising  After the rebellion, different interpretations of the event were presented by the French and the Vietnamese, reflecting their respective agendas.Zinoman (2000), pp.67‚Äì74. French accounts of the rebellion showed the political imperatives of the state, rather than explaining the causes and character of the Thai Nguyen uprising, when they did not account for the role and motivations of the participants behind the uprising including the civilians, political prisoners, common criminals and prison guards. In attributing the cause of the rebellion to individuals, the French tried to absolve the colonial responsibility for the rebellion while the Vietnamese account tried to promote the tradition of national heroism through the personal achievement of Sergeant Can. Darles tried to present the rebellion as a revolutionary movement to divert attention from his brutal administration of the penitentiary. Commandant Nicolas of the Garde Indigene downplayed the movement's political character so as to preserve the reputation of his corps as essentially loyal and trusted, but were 'forced' to rebel due to the harsh local conditions or tactics of intimidation. The metropole, on the other hand, desired to downplay any anxieties of the 'native treachery' of the French population during the First World War.Zinoman (2000), p.68. French Governor General Sarraut tried to control the press in portraying the event as 'local' and having no widespread political reach and conspiracy. Sarraut tried to paint the event as the political prisoners having ridden on the guards' disgruntlement with local conditions ‚Äì i.e., the collaboration was more opportunistic than having common grounds of anti-colonialism. This is in spite of the evidence that the rebellion involved participants from various social classes, had support from hundreds of civilians, and used visual symbols (such as armbands and flags) and a proclamation demanding the end of the French rule. Darles was portrayed in French records to be the primary reason for the revolt. Sarraut made efforts at political damage control; he wanted to protect the reputation of his officials and invalidate an impression that colonial administrators were brutal. Sarraut nevertheless attributed the cause of the uprising to Darles' acts of violence against the guards. The rebellion was portrayed as a desperate and impulsive act of self-preservation rather than seditious plotting ‚Äì it was a reflex reaction rather than a subversive plot carefully planned by the guards. To diffuse responsibility for the flaws on the penitentiary's design, Sarraut claimed the First World War had disrupted the plan to tackle overcrowding in Thai Nguyen by deporting political prisoners to penal colonies elsewhere.Zinoman (2000), p.88. Tran Huy Lieu presents a different reconstruction of the event. Instead of underlining the Darles' leading role for triggering the uprising, Lieu highlights the profound anti-colonial inclinations of Sergeant Can and paints him as an active agent who plotted secretly against the French state. Lieu's account of Can as a humble, kind-hearted and strong fighter, shows a typically celebrated Vietnamese revolutionary heroism. Can is described as 'very courageous', 'a natural commander' and skilled martial leader, dressed simply, mild mannered and disapproved of the excesses of battle (i.e. plunder, rape of women etc.).Zinoman (2000), p.74. While Peter Zinoman arguably provides a most comprehensive account (in English) on the Thai Nguyen uprising, he acknowledged there remained information gaps on the episode.Zinoman (2000), pp.95‚Äì96. For instance, it was less clear who initiated and plotted the uprising, the rebels' hierarchy of command and control, and whether participants were persuaded or intimidated into joining the rebellion. Despite the gaps, Zinoman argued one could discern the existence of communications between Can and Quyen, inclusive decision making involving other participants, sense of comradeship transcending class and regional divisions resembling modern political nationalism.  Aftermath  =Blurring the lines between traditional and modern anti-colonial rebellions= David Marr had contextualised the occurrence of the Thai Nguyen uprising in a period where the scholar-gentry anti-colonial Vietnamese leaders were grappling with the pressures of modernizing and strengthening the Vietnamese state while Vietnam was still under colonial rule, and trying to search for a 'modern' Vietnamese national-consciousness and identity. Peter Zinoman elaborated on the above analysis and argued that the Thai-Nguyen uprising could be considered an important transition within the history of anti-colonialism in French Indochina as it was different from the earlier 'traditional' anti-colonial efforts that were organised locally.Zinoman (2000), p.58. As the rebels in Thai Nguyen uprising came from over thirty provinces and represented a wider cross-section of society of various classes, the event was marked to be significant in having 'modern' elements of having transcended the social and regional limitations that hampered the development of earlier movements. Coordinated action based on vertical and horizontal alliances within the rebel forces showed no one individual could be singled out simply for responsibility for the rebellion. After the Thai-Nguyen uprising, Vietnamese anti-colonialism acquired a new dimension. Marr characterised the period between 1925‚Äì1945 as one where two streams of anti-colonialism ('anti-imperial' and 'anti-feudal') had merged plus the evolution of national consciousness spreading not only amongst the elites but also the peasantry and villagers.Marr, p.276. Education had affected more people, more Vietnamese students were educated overseas, and Vietnamese nationalism became political and \\"urban\\". An array of 'modern' movements began to emerge during the 1920s and 1930s. The middle class in Vietnam assumed a bigger role in political initiative and nationalist political parties such as Vi·ªát Nam Qu·ªëc D√¢n ƒê·∫£ng (VNQDƒê) and communist parties like the Indochinese Communist Party (ICP) and others began to emerge and establish themselves in Vietnamese politics and history. They were more successful than their predecessors in integrating anti-colonial forces from different parts of French Indochina and establishing organisation structures and communication channels that transcended class divisions and geographical boundaries. Subsequent battles against the French during World War II and the Battle of Dien Bien Phu showed the French was not invincible. =The colonial prison system ‚Äì fostering nationalism against French colonial rule= Apart from the sense of transition from 'traditional' to 'modern' Vietnamese nation- consciousness in the movements after the 1920s, Zinoman argues that \\"prisons were as significant as schools and political parties in creating a 'consciousness of connectedness'\\", and the Thai Nguyen uprising may be considered as amongst the \\"earliest manifestations of modern anti-colonial nationalism\\".Zinoman (2000), p.98. The colonial penal institution, \\"founded to quell political dissent and maintain law and order\\" was in turn appropriated by the imprisoned into \\"a site that nurtured the growth of communism, nationalism, and anti-colonial resistance\\".Zinoman, The Colonial Bastille: A History of Imprisonment in Vietnam, 1862‚Äì1940, p.4. He argued that the same prison system helped strengthen common identities and the growth in dissemination of anti-colonial ideology when prisoners were circulated amongst different prisons in Vietnam (including at Poulo Condore). Specifically, the ICP used the prison as a centre of communist cadre recruitment and ideology indoctrination as the prison context grouped diverse categories of prisoners together and fostered amongst them strong bonds, common identities and political direction. This same situation was already witnessed earlier in the Thai Nguyen uprising, where the prisoners and the prison guards shared similar conditions of being maltreated by the French and forged common identities of anti-colonialism which was the unifying basis for their decision to rebel.

Description The Maldive anemonefish is a small fish which grows up to 11 cm as a female and 8 cm as a male. It is oval-bodied and laterally compressed.Lieske & Myers, Coral reef fishes, Princeton University Press, 2009, This clownfish is characterized by its rusty orange color with a single white stripe running vertically just behind the eye. It has black pelvic and anal fins (hence the common name) and a variable area on its belly can be more or less black. Depending on geographic location, some fishes can be orangeish-yellow with an anal fin which is not black but the same color as the body.Dr Anderson, Reef fishes of the Maldives, Manta marine, 2008, Blackfinned anemonefish in Fihalhohi, Maldives Distribution The Maldive anemonefish is found in the western Indian Ocean in the Maldive Islands, Laccadive Islands, and Sri Lanka. Habitat This species typically lives in small groups on outer reef slopes at depths of . It is particularly associated with the magnificent sea anemone. Feeding This anemonefish is omnivorous, and its diet is based on zooplankton, small benthic crustaceans, and algae.http://eol.org/pages/213617/details Behaviour Amphiprion nigripes is active during the day. It is a protandrous hermaphrodite, which means all fish are hatched as males and later can change sex to female. The males live in harems in which an established dominance hierarchy manages the group and keeps individuals at a specific social rank. It also aggressively defends its territory and is completely dependent on its sea anemone, which represents its \\"life insurance\\" as a safe shelter for the group and for the nest. The associative relationship that binds the clownfish and the sea anemone is called mutualism. The fish lives within the sea anemone's tentacles and can use it as a shelter because it has developed a thin layer of mucus which covers its body as a protection against the anemone's stinging tentacles, and the presence of the clownfish can be interpreted as a lure to attract potential anemone prey close to its tentacles; the clownfish can also defend the anemone against some reef fishes which could eat the tentacles, such as butterflyfish. =In captivity= In a tank, the species can eat brine shrimp, mysis shrimp, and chopped shellfish provided by a hobbyist. Individuals that are tank-raised have accepted high-protein flakes as well as granular foods. The maldive anemonefish is considered mostly peaceful in an aquarium, with some aggression when defending its host. It has successfully been raised in captivity.

Introduction Eagle Rock's rock-pillar crown rises as a steep backdrop behind the Heller Ranch. The Golden Eagle, along with the hawks, circles upon thermal lifts where sunshine warms the southerly rock faces. The Heller's spread is being restored in establishing the Heller Center for the University of Colorado Colorado Springs. History From the 1930s Dottie and Lawrence Heller homesteaded a land parcel in the pinion-pine grasslands at Austin Bluffs, settling directly below Eagle Rock's rocky outcrop. The young couple humbly named their place \\"Yawn Valley,\\" in contrast to the fantastic rock palisades that rim the basin. The Hellers entertained Larry's fellow artists from the Broadmoor Art Academy at garden parties held under the watch of the hoodoos of Eagle Rock. Urban development has claimed much of the mesa formation near Eagle Rock since the Hellers‚Äô time. Nowadays rooftops from big houses built in the University Park subdivision peer down upon the Heller Ranch from Austin Bluffs. At the end of a 60-year residency, the Hellers bequeathed their ranchland with the architecture and art collection to the University, for use as a nature preserve to support local arts and humanities education. Geography field study classes are held at the Heller Ranch in its Eagle Rock setting. Students engage in birdsong-listening, wildflower identification, and dendro- chronological investigations. Eagle Rock offers data about the region's geological events. Form and setting Sandstone palisades of hoodoo ribs erupt into stacked terraces, up to six-layers high, intermittently situated across the northern wall commanded by Eagle Rock and the neighboring Pulpit Rock. Its high white stone columns are easily visible from Highway I-25. In a wedding-cake array, Eagle Rock's three steep stone terraces step down the hillside. Each grey stone terrace maintains its hold against weathering erosion, where strengthened by a top stratum composed of a more resistant sedimented rock in a streak of golden-reddish tint. Chunks of broken rock pillars, the debris from downslope falls, salt the ground. Geomorphology Eagle Rock participates in the Austin Bluffs area's soil type of the \\"Travessilla-Rock outcrop complex,\\" as mapped at the scale of 1:24,000-ft., (ref. USDA, 1974.) To understand the area's soil characteristics in more detail, we may consider a field-study lecture on site at the Heller Ranch, where Prof. Thomas P. Huber explained the geomorphological origins of Eagle Rock. The Eagle Rock cliff resulted from several long cycles of mountain- building (termed \\"orogenies,\\") followed by erosion. Heat and pressure energies that had thrust up the mountains produced igneous rock, such as the Pikes Peak pink granite, which eventually degraded. Natural forces dispersed and deposited particles of the rock debris. Over time, the sediment collected and consolidated into new sandstone at the Garden of the Gods, producing a geologic layer known as the Dakota Formation. The Dakota sedimented sandstone later came to be inundated by the waters of a shallow inland sea. From some 66 to 70 million years ago and episodically continuing for millions of years, uplift from the Laramide Orogeny exposed the old sandstone seabed, by tilting up to 90-degree angles the steep red megaliths which we now see in the Garden of the Gods (Huber, 1998, pp. 7 and 130.) Portions of the Dakota Formation again cycled into episodes of erosion, allowing a detritus of coarse-grained sedimentary sand to be displaced some three miles (5 km) eastwards, to land at the site which we now know as Austin Bluffs. The feldspar-rich sedimented particles of \\"arkose\\" sand consolidated into new sandstone, i.e. the Dawson Formation, which shows Eagle Rock's characteristic color, ranging from grey to reddish. At Eagle Rock, the sandstone cliff we see today has survived further erosion for a longer time, than the less-resistant background soils could have withstood. Eagle Rock lies exposed to view, as a weather-sculpted geological form (Huber, pp. 6 and 55.) View to Heller Center from Eagle Rock The view straight down from the chink in the hoodoo wall at Eagle Rock looks onto the Heller's garden paradise to see the ranch house, guest house, and art gallery. The buildings nestle among lilacs, a domestic flowering shrub favored by the founder of Colorado Springs, General William Jackson Palmer. Wild prairie, with some invasive vegetation like the classically pyramidal juniper tree, extends past the Hellers‚Äô architectural landscape. Our gaze sweeps further southwards over sculpture gardens set onto the front lawns of an old art colony which appeared along Stanton Road when the Eagle Rock suburban neighborhood was first developed. Since the university was established in 1965 at the old Cragmor Sanatorium on the Bluffs‚Äô southern slope, campus development continues to edge around toward Eagle Rock's precincts. Far to the south, blips of skyscrapers signal the downtown at Colorado Springs. The strong edge of the Rocky Mountains Front Range delineates the western horizon. Sparkling white snow caps the .-high cone of Pikes Peak, except in mid-summer. Below, our view skims the thin fin-walls of the red Gateway Rocks and grey Cathedral Rock, up-turned slabs of ancient seabed at the Garden of the Gods. The jagged skyline drops past the hollowed-out Cheyenne Mountain, where a pink granite cavern pulled back by rock anchors houses the North American Aerospace Defense Command's Cheyenne Mountain Complex. The view to the east from Eagle Rock cannot lift beyond the basin's rim to see the Great Plains, where the antelope used to play before they got crowded-out by urban growth's housing subdivisions and commercialized arterial streets. Access to Eagle Rock Eagle Rock can be climbed by bushwhacking directly up the hill from the Heller Ranch, carefully avoiding spines from prickly-pear or tiny barrel cactus. Alternatively, there is a scenic drive from Union Boulevard and the Rockhurst Boulevard neighborhood to find the Pulpit Rock Open Space trailhead at Butler Court. Starting out on the official hiking trail, there is an informal spur that runs down the southerly ridge, to find Eagle Rock with its splendid long- range views. References *Huber, Thomas P.

Mo Ranch is a Presbyterian conference center for summer camps, retreats, family reunions that is located in unincorporated Kerr County, Texas.

Moran, who was chairman of Continental Oil Company (later to become Conoco, Inc.). He owned the ranch from 1935 until his death in 1948; Presbyterians purchased the ranch in 1949, the year after his death, for $562,500; Mrs. Moran then gave a gift back to the church of $50,000. Eventually the State of Texas bought of the ranch from the Presbyterians, and later expanded that portion with additional purchase of adjacent land. That land is now the Kerr County Wildlife Management Area, administered by Texas Parks & Wildlife. Now the entire Mo- Ranch covers . By 2019 the Mo Ranch camp organization began doing off-site camping programs in the Rio Grande Valley region; historically many residents there chose not to travel to Kerr County for the camp as some members of families lacked immigration visas and therefore could be detained at in- country immigration checkpoints set up in the region.

The dish is made with freshly curdled soft tofu (which has not been strained and pressed), vegetables, sometimes mushrooms, onion, optional seafood (commonly oysters, mussels, clams and shrimp), optional meat (commonly beef or pork), and gochujang (chili paste) or gochu garu (chili powder). The dish is assembled and cooked directly in the serving vessel, which is traditionally made of thick, robust porcelain, but can also be ground out of solid stone. A raw egg can be put in the jjigae just before serving, and the dish is delivered while bubbling vigorously. It is typically eaten with a bowl of cooked white rice and several banchan (side dishes). Extra soft tofu, called sundubu (; \\"mild tofu\\") in Korean, is softer than other types of tofu and is usually sold in tubes. Although sun in sundubu doesn't have Sino-Korean origin, sundubu is often translated into Chinese and Japanese using the Chinese character , whose Korean pronunciation is sun and the meaning is \\"pure\\". Thus in China, sundubu is called ch√∫n d√≤ufu (; \\"pure tofu\\"), and in Japan, it is called jun t≈çfu () or sundubu (). History The origins of using unpressed tofu in Korean cuisine is not well documented, but records from the Joseon dynasty archives show an early form of sundubu jjigae being served. Some historians assume that unpressed tofu use spread to the masses during the Joseon dynasty. Overseas Following the Korean war, some American military servicemen who returned from South Korea brought home jjigae (especially dubu jjigae) recipes. In the 1990s, Korean immigrants in Los Angeles brought sundubu jjigae to the United States.Hee Sook Lee, a first- generation Korean immigrant, opened the first sundubu restaurant in Vermont Avenue, Koreatown.

In 1957, he was a political columnist for the daily newspaper La Libert√© du Massif Central, and an editor for Paris-Presse. In 1958, he joined the weekly magazine Jours de France. He was appointed in 1960 director of information of the Republic of Niger where he created the information services and the daily Le Temps du Niger. In 1962, he founded and directed for five years the daily Le Courrier de Madagascar in Antananarivo. He created in 1967 in Martinique the weekly France Antilles Sp√©cial Dimanche. He was in 1968 in Dakar, Senegal, leading the creation of the daily Le Soleil and of Les Nouvelles Imprimeries du S√©n√©gal, both of which paved the way to the plurality and opening of information in French West Africa. Gayot has been active in Canada where he renewed and relaunched the world's oldest French language daily, L'Evang√©line. He brought his expertise to the local press in Vietnam, Egypt, Mauretania, Za√Øre (now Republic of Congo), Burundi and Iran.La Gazette de la Presse francophone (Paris) Juillet 2005 NJ 122 In 1969, with his friends Henri Gault and Christian Millau, he founded the monthly magazine Le Nouveau Guide, which went against culinary traditions of the time by promoting artistically prepared food, new cooking techniques and fresh ingredients. The three also founded the Gault Millau guide, and coined and promoted the term nouvelle cuisine. In the 1980s and 1990s, Gayot began publishing in the USA a series of restaurant guidebooks known alternatively under the Gault-Millau name or as Gayot Guides. The guidebooks rated and highlighted restaurants deemed to be among the top in their region, with reviews discussing d√©cor, service, ambience and wine lists, with an emphasis on French cuisine. After 2000, his guides were published exclusively under the name Gayot, following a disagreement with the new owners of the French Gault-Millau guides. In 1983, Gayot founded, in Paris, the monthly magazine Pr√©vention Sant√© in conjunction with Rodale Publishing (Emmaus, PA USA). With son Alain and daughter Sophie, he launched in Los Angeles the website www.gayot.com devoted to gastronomy, tourism and lifestyle.

Function  The protein encoded by this gene belongs to the highly conserved cyclin family, whose members are characterized by a dramatic periodicity in protein abundance through the cell cycle. Cyclins function as regulators of CDK kinases. Different cyclins exhibit distinct expression and degradation patterns that contribute to the temporal coordination of each mitotic event. This cyclin tightly associates with CDK9 kinase, and was found to be a major subunit of the transcription elongation factor p-TEFb. The kinase complex containing this cyclin and the elongation factor can interact with, and act as a cofactor of human immunodeficiency virus type 1 (HIV-1) Tat protein, and was shown to be both necessary and sufficient for full activation of viral transcription. This cyclin and its kinase partner were also found to be involved in the phosphorylation and regulation of the carboxy-terminal domain (CTD) of the largest RNA polymerase II subunit.

Tanning dependence or Tanorexia (a portmanteau of tanning and anorexia) is a syndrome where an individual appears to have a physical or psychological dependence on sunbathing or the use of ultraviolet (UV) tanning beds. Compulsive tanning may satisfy the definition of a behavioral addiction as well. Medical evidence Tanning dependence may have a physiological basis involving endogenous opioids. There is evidence that UV exposure produces beta-endorphin in the epidermis and conflicting evidence of this opioid being released into the blood system, a pathway to the brain. A small study also found the opioid antagonist naltrexone reduced preference for UV tanning beds and at higher doses produced withdraw symptoms in frequent tanners. Better understanding of tanning dependence requires further controlled studies, especially in imaging and neurobiology. The finding that excessive tanning can lead to dependence is based upon \\"the observations of many dermatologists.\\" Dermatologists tell researchers that although they advise their patients not to visit tanning beds because of the risk of melanoma, patients still do. In a 2014 literature review, researchers wrote that many people who tan excessively meet psychiatry's symptom criteria for substance abuse. In a case where ten studies provided data for the assessment of melanoma risk among subjects who reported ‚Äúever‚Äù being exposed compared with those ‚Äúnever‚Äù exposed; a positive association was found between exposure and risk. The effects of tanning dependence are/but not limited to: skin cancer, skin burns, premature skin aging, and eye damage (both short and long- term).  Example cases  Extreme instances may be an indication of body dysmorphic disorder (BDD), a mental disorder in which one is extremely critical of his or her physique or self-image to an obsessive and compulsive degree. As it is with anorexia, a person with BDD is said to show signs of a characteristic called distorted body image. In layman's terms, anorexia sufferers commonly believe they are overweight, many times claiming they see themselves as \\"fat\\", when in reality, they are often, but not always, nutritionally underweight and physically much thinner than the average person. In the same way, a sufferer of \\"tanorexia\\" may believe him or herself to have a much lighter ‚Äì even a pale ‚Äì complexion when he or she is actually quite dark-skinned. Neither tanning dependence nor tanorexia are covered under the latest edition of the Diagnostic and Statistical Manual of Mental Disorders. However, a 2005 article in The Archives of Dermatology presents a case for UV light tanning dependence to be viewed as a type of substance abuse disorder.M. Warthan, T. Uchida, R. Wagner, Jr. UV Light Tanning as a Type of Substance- Related Disorder. Archives of Dermatology, August 2005; vol 141: pp 963-966. In 2012, New Jersey mother Patricia Krentcil received national media attention amid accusations that she had brought her five-year-old daughter with her to a tanning salon in order for the child to receive a tan. The child's school nurse had expressed concern over her sunburn, at which point the daughter claimed she had gone \\"tanning with Mommy\\". This prompted the school to call Division of Youth and Family Services, as New Jersey law bans children under 14 from tanning booths. Initial media coverage of the event resulted in widespread attention given to Patricia Krentcil's unusually bronzed image, leading many to speculate that she was tanorexic.'Tanning Mom' In Court, Denies Daughter, 5, Burned in Tan Salon: Does She Suffer from 'Tanorexia'? She was subsequently charged with second-degree child endangerment, and she was banned from over 60 tanning salons in the tri-state area. Patricia claimed that it was all a misunderstanding, saying her daughter was never exposed to the tanning booth's UV rays and instead got slightly sunburned while playing outside on a warm day. She was later cleared of the charge. At one point, she was challenged to stop tanning for one month, which she did, greatly changing her appearance. She claimed it made her feel \\"weird and pale\\", and that she would cut back on tanning, but not eliminate it from her hobbies. A Connecticut-based business also attempted to seize and capitalize on the \\"tan mom\\" craze by creating an action figure doll of Patricia.  Treatment  Excessive tanning increases the risk of developing certain types of skin cancer. People that are addicted to tanning are dealing with a body dysmorphic disorder (BDD). People with tanorexia dislike the color of their skin but in reality the perceived defect may be only a slight imperfection or non- existent. Commonly, people who are suffering from tanorexia also suffer from anxiety disorders such as obsessive compulsive disorder, depression and eating disorders. To get the right treatment for tanorexia, people must mention specifically their concerns with their appearance when they talk to a doctor or mental health professional. Effective treatments that are available at the moment are cognitive behavioral therapy, antidepressant medications, hypnosis and addiction treatment centers. Antidepressant medications include selective serotonin reuptake inhibitors and can help relieve the obsessive and compulsive symptoms of tanorexia. The third treatment, is an audio hypnosis session which is developed by psychologists with a wide experience in helping people beat all kinds of addictive behaviour patterns. Lastly, people with an extreme tanning addiction can look for help at specific addiction centres that are spread throughout the United States. Tanning culture in the Western Hemisphere In Western European culture, pale skin has indicated high status. A tan signified that you had to work outdoors as a manual laborer, while pale skin announced that you could afford to stay out of the sun and spend time and money cultivating your appearance. In the 1920s, pioneering fashion designer Coco Chanel popularized the idea of tanning. She made it so the sun represented pleasure and relaxation as well as wealth. Post Industrial Revolution, tanning gained popularity because at this time it was easier to be employed, and therefore there was less outdoor manual labor, and more indoor labor. Due to more indoor jobs, a tan began to mean that you had the leisure time to bronze your skin and the money to travel to places where it could be acquired. A tan also represented enthusiasm for outdoor activities, as well as physical fitness and good health. When tanning bed became implemented the concept of tanning changed yet again. The first self tanner, Tan-Man, was introduced in 1959, and UV tanning beds started to appear in the United States in 1978. A study conducted at Pepperdine University in 2005 found that 25 percent of beach-goers showed signs of tanning addiction or tanorexia. Since the implementation of tanning beds in the United States, nearly 30 million people tan indoors every year. There have been health issues related to tanning trends. In 2014 most Australian states put a ban on all commercial tanning beds. It is the second nation after Brazil to impose restrictions. In 2011 over 2000 people died from skin cancer in Australia. Several European counties and American States have banned the use of tanning beds by minors. Scientists have also suspected that frequent exposure to UVs has the potential to become addictive. Researchers have found that several parts of the brain that play a role in addiction are active when people are exposed to UV rays.  Tanning culture in the Eastern Hemisphere  In the mid 1990s, a new type of tanning trend appeared in Japan called Ganguro. It was a way for Japanese women to resist traditional roles for women in Japan. The style is described as having deep tans and blond, orange, or silver gray hair. Many of these women were shunned by the public and media.

He was a recipient of the French Croix de Guerre and the American Eisenhower medal. Early life Charles Fernley Fawcett was born in Waleska, Georgia, where his mother had been caught in a snow storm and died when he was six. His family was of old Virginian stock, whose family tree included Thomas Jefferson and James Madison. Having been orphaned at an early age, Fawcett and his younger brother and two sisters grew up in Greenville, South Carolina, in the care of their aunt. Here he attended Greenville high school for three years where he learned to wrestle and play American football.http://www.filmsweep.com/node/64150 Retrieved 14 April 2008 Aged 15, Fawcett became involved in an affair with his best friend's mother. He remarked, \\"If that's child molestation, I would wish this curse on every young boy.\\" The end of the affair made Fawcett contemplate suicide, and he left the United States to travel to the far East, working his passage on a number of steamships. By 1937 he had returned to America and stayed for a time in New York City before making his way to Washington D. C., where he was taken in by his cousin, who happened to be an assistant United States Postmaster General. Here he ended up wrestling to make a living. Then in 1937 he boarded a ship outside Montreal bound for France, where he worked as an artist‚Äôs model and again as a wrestler. World War II After the outbreak of World War II he tried to join US Intelligence but his services were declined, so he briefly joined the Section Volontaire des Am√©ricains - the ambulance corps. He was on his way to North Africa to join the Free French when he heard about Varian Fry, who would go on to rescue over 2,000 Jews from Vichy France with the help of a handful of people, Fawcett among them. Among the most famous people they rescued were Franz Werfel, Marc Chagall, Heinrich Mann and Hannah Arendt. \\"I went to see him and he wasn‚Äôt very interested until I told him I‚Äôd been a professional wrestler. He said, ‚ÄòMaybe we could use you to sort of keep order. Anybody who‚Äôs not supposed to be there, you can get rid of them‚Äô,\\" Fawcett recalled in an interview with Dr Stephen D Smith in 1998. \\"Fry was perhaps one of the most idealistic men I had ever known and certainly the most unassuming. We got rid in a hurry of his little bow-tie and striped suit. Out of place completely in Marseilles. Maybe one of the reasons he got away with a lot was because he looked so innocent.\\" Towards the end of the war, Fawcett posed as the husband of six Jewish women in three months. This enabled the women, who had formerly been imprisoned in Nazi concentration camps, to leave France with an American visa. Eventually, he had to flee France at several hours‚Äô notice after a tip-off that the Gestapo was coming to arrest him. Having left France, he flew in the RAF and later fought with the French Foreign Legion. Post- war After the war, he pursued a cinematic career, in which he performed in over 100 films, working with such stars as Errol Flynn, Alan Ladd and Robert Taylor. He combined this with smuggling refugees to safety from civil conflict, organizing earthquake relief teams, fighting in several wars and co- founding the International Medical Corps. Fawcett's first wife, with whom he had a daughter, died in 1956. In 1991, he married again, when after a 30-year engagement he married April Ducksbury, a British model agency executive, and settled in London. In 1979, he went to assist in training the Mujahideen in Afghanistan, who were fighting the Soviet Union. Film footage he shot whilst in Afghanistan was critical in securing American aid to the Mujahideen. He spent the rest of his life in Chelsea, London, with his wife April Ducksbury. Here he acquired a taste for music and wrote songs. In 2006, Fawcett was nominated for recognition as Righteous Among the Nations at the annual British Holocaust commemoration.

He played for the Derry GAA team in the late 1940s, 1950s and early 1960s and played club football for St. Trea's GFC Ballymaguigan and Se√°n O'Leary's GAC Newbridge. He was captain of the Derry side that finished runners-up to Dublin in the 1958 All-Ireland Championship. Career McKeever was a very versatile player as evidenced by his playing in all positions with the exception of goalkeeper and wing half back during his Derry career. He started out his inter-county career as a half-forward, but is chiefly remembered as a midfielder for both club and county and has been frequently described as \\"one of the greatest midfielders of all time\\". He was renowned for his high-fielding ability ‚Äì described by Kerry legend Mick O'Connell as the best catcher he ever played against. Other skills in his repertoire include his surging runs forwards from midfield, shooting accuracy and free taking ability. McKeever was named in the Football Team of the Century comprising players who never won an All-Ireland. He played an \\"inspirational role\\" in helping put Derry on the GAA map. After retiring from playing, he served as manager of a number of teams. In 2009 he was named in the Sunday Tribune's list of the 125 Most Influential People in GAA History. Former Tyrone manager Art McRory said of McKeever: \\"That man has done more to promote the GAA than any other person I know.\\" Background and personal life McKeever was born in 1931 into a GAA interested home, in the small townland of Ballymaguigan on the western shores of Lough Neagh. He went to the local St Trea's primary school where he helped develop his football skills, before boarding at St Malachy's College, Belfast. The first inter-county football game he attended was Derry versus Leitrim in a 1938 National League playoff game with his father, and the quarter-final defeat to Roscommon a week later. He looked up to players who played for local team Newbridge at the time (the Ballymaguigan team hadn't been formed yet), such as Barney Murphy and John McGrogan. McKeever said \\"To me they were heroes at that stage\\". He also admired Mick Higgins of Cavan. After finishing school at St Malachy's, he continued his studies at St Mary's Training College in Belfast. He completed his studies at Loughborough College in England. After returning to Ireland, he taught PE and other subjects in Downpatrick, County Down. In 1957 he returned to St Mary's in Belfast, this time as a lecturer, and would spend the rest of his working life at the college until his retirement in 1992. He is now retired and lives in Magherafelt with his wife Teresa, whom he married in 1958. They have three daughters, Ann, Maeve and Deirdre, and two sons, √âamonn and Jim. Football career =Inter-county= McKeever's first inter-county football came as a member of the Antrim Minor team in 1947. He recalls \\"Organised minor football was only really getting started in Derry at the time and the first experience I had of playing intercounty football was with the Antrim minors\\". The following year he lined out for Derry minors, losing to eventual All-Ireland Minor Champions at the Ulster semi-final stage. Some of that Derry Minor side would graduate to the Senior team and would be an integral part of the big upwards strides Derry would make in the 1950s. As a 17-year-old, he made his Derry Senior debut in a challenge match in 1948, and was a first-team regular by the following year. He played at half forward in the early part of his Derry career, later changing to midfield. In 1950 he flew back from England to play a significant role in Derry's Dr Lagan Cup success. That year Derry were also victorious in the Ulster Junior Championship. They beat Limerick in the All-Ireland Junior Championship semi- final, a game in which he marked Kerry legend Eoin Liston's father, a fact McKeever didn't find out until 50 years later. Derry met Mayo in the Final, but lost a close game by two points on a scoreline of 4‚Äì03 to 2‚Äì07. 1955 proved to be a turning point for Derry as they reached their first Ulster Senior Championship final in 34 years. They were beaten by Cavan by three points, and reached the decider again two years later, only to be beaten by two points to Tyrone. Before the 1958 Championship, Derry played in the inaugural Wembley Tournament (an exhibition competition to allow Irish emigrants in England a chance to see Gaelic football) in Wembley Stadium in London, England. They beat reigning Ulster Champions Tyrone in a play-off to decide who would go to the tournament, but were defeated by Galway in the tournament itself. In 1958, McKeever captained Derry to the county's first ever Ulster Senior Championship success, beating Down in the final by four points (1‚Äì11 to 2‚Äì04). He said in a 1993 book that the team had been together for three or four years and \\"when you get to a final for the third time it is time to win it\\". On 24 August, Derry caused one of the biggest shocks in the history of Gaelic football when the first-time Ulster Champions beat Kerry in the All-Ireland semi-final 2-06 to 2‚Äì05. They met Dublin in that year's All- Ireland final and despite McKeever being \\"by far and away the outstanding player on view\\", Derry were defeated. It has been claimed a series of poor refereeing decisions in that game cost Derry greatly, but McKeever himself refuses to make any excuses saying in a 2002 interview, \\"It was an exceptionally good Dublin team\\". For his performances in the 1958 Championship, he was awarded with the inaugural Texaco Footballer of the Year award. Along with Meath's Colm O'Rourke in 1991, he is the only player who has won the award, despite not being part of that year's All-Ireland winning team. His brother Dennis also played for Derry and was alongside Jim in the 1958 team. The 1950s was a decade of very high standards of football and was a very difficult era to win an All-Ireland, with the likes of Mayo, Galway, Kerry, Louth, Cavan, Meath and Dublin having very strong teams at the time. Unfortunately for Derry, they never quite managed to keep that team together, and failed to win another Ulster title during McKeever's (who was 27 at the time of the final) career. They did however reach the National League final in both 1958/59 and 1960/61, but they lost out to Kerry on both occasions, partly due to key forward Sean O'Connell being suspended for both deciders. =Club= In the late 1940s he was asked to play an important game for the Newbridge minor team and despite Ballymaguigan having recently been set up he decided to stay with the Newbridge club for the time being. He won the first two of his three Derry Senior Football Championship medals with the club in 1948 and 1950. While at college in England he lined out for the Leicester Young Ireland's club and during his time in Downpatrick (1953‚Äì1956), he played for the Downpatrick club. From 1957 onwards he played for his native Ballymaguigan. Winning the South Derry Championship in 1957 (where McKeever excelled in the final), Ballymaguigan qualified for the Derry Championship final (the Derry Championship was not open-draw until 1958, up to then separate South Derry, North Derry and Derry City Championships were played with the three winners then battling it out for the [All-]Derry Senior Football Championship). They were beaten by Ballerin in the Derry decider, also finishing Derry Championship runners-up to Bellaghy in 1958 and 1961. The 1961 final did not place, Ballymaguigan had asked the County Board to delay the match, as some players were unavailable, the County Board refused and awarded the title to Bellaghy. In 1958, the club however did win the Se√°n Larkin Cup, which had replaced the South Derry Championship ‚Äì and retained it the following year. Despite losing the disappointment of losing three Championship final in a few years, the club won their only Derry Senior Championship to date in 1962 against Castledawson, with McKeever being an important part of the team. His brothers Dennis, Eddie and Frank also won county medals with the club that year, while another brother, Se√°n, also played for The 'Quiggan at a time. Ballymaguigan also won the Derry Senior League in 1962, giving the club a famous double. They went that year's league undefeated. Ballymaguigan's fortunes took a downturn as the 1960s progressed and were a Junior club by the end of the decade. Despite being 39/40?, in 1970 McKeever (who converted seven frees in the last 20 minutes) put in a man of the match display as Ballymaguigan won the South Derry Junior Championship, defeating Greenlough in the final. They went on to win the [All-]Derry Junior Championship, beating Drum in the semi-final and Se√°n Dolans in the final. =Province= McKeever was a regular of the great Ulster team of the 1950s ‚Äì playing for Ulster on 11 consecutive years. He won two Railway Cups with the province ‚Äì starring at midfield on the 1956 team that beat Munster in the final, and at centre half forward on the 1960 victorious side, also against Munster. =International= McKeever represented Ireland against the Combined Universities team regularly during his career. Before the commencement of the GAA All Stars Awards in 1971, being picked to represent your country was the equivalent. When 19, he was a sub on the team and went on to be selected for five of the next six years (with the competition not held the other year). =School / college= Underage football wasn't very well organised when McKeever was young and it was at St. Malachy's College in Belfast that his career started to flourish. He captained the school to two consecutive MacRory Cup finals in 1948 and 1949, but they lost out on both occasions to St. Patrick's, Cavan and St. Colman's, Newry respectively. While there, he made the Ulster intercolleges team for two seasons, saying \\"I was on the team for two years and making that side really lifted my aspirations a lot. The intercolleges competition was a very big one at the time and I felt privileged to be there.\\" While at St. Mary's Training College, he played with them in the Antrim leagues. =Basketball= McKeever also represented Ulster at basketball. Post playing career =Management= After retiring from football, he had a long coaching career. McKeever was manager of the Derry senior team on three separate occasions. In 1964 along with Joe Lennon and Jim McDonnell, McKeever ran the first-ever residential GAA coaching course in Gormanston. He led St. Mary's for 35 years (i.e. his whole teaching career there from 1957 onwards) and along with Peter Finn, he guided the college to their only Sigerson Cup triumph in 1989, and is credited with greatly improving the standard of football at the college during his time there. That Sigerson success was viewed as a major surprise, the club having only entered the competition from 1988. The college also won five Ryan Cups during his time there (1970, 1971, 1978, 1981 and 1983). His coaching at St. Mary's influenced other coaches and players such as Art McRory, Mickey Harte, Peter Canavan and Peter McGinnity. He is the only man ever to whole the roles of captain, Chairman, President and manager of St. Mary's and was elected Life President in 1999. As manager he led Ulster to Railway Cups in 1970 and 1987. He also trained the Derry Under 21 hurlers to victory in the 1993 Ulster Under-21 Hurling Championship. =Other= He was elected Chairman of the Derry County Board in December 1997 and was in the position when Derry won the 1998 Ulster Championship. He has also been a Central Council delegate. McKeever won the Services to GAA award at the 1993 Ulster GAA Writer's Association Awards Honours =County= *All-Ireland Senior Football Championship: **Runner up: 1958 *National Football League: **Runner up: 1958‚Äì1959, 1960‚Äì1961 *Ulster Senior Football Championship: **Winner (1): 1958 **Runner up: 1955, 1957 *Dr Lagan Cup: **Winner (4): 1950, 1953, 1959, 1961 *All-Ireland Junior Football Championship: **Runner up: 1950 *Ulster Junior Football Championship: **Winner (1): 1950 =Province= *Railway Cup ‚Äì Winner (2): 1956, 1960 =Club= *Derry Senior Football Championship ‚Äì Winner (3): 1948, 1950, 1962 *Derry Junior Football Championship ‚Äì Winner (1): 1970 *Underage awards =College= *MacRory Cup ‚Äì Runner up: 1948, 1949 =Individual= *Texaco Footballer of the Year: 1958 *Captain Derry All-Ireland runners up side: 1958 Note: The above lists may be incomplete.

For a hierarchical list of articles, see the intelligence cycle management hierarchy. It is a maxim of intelligence that intelligence agencies do not make policy, but advise policymakers. Nevertheless, with an increasingly fast pace of operations, intelligence analysts may suggest choices of actions, with some projection of consequences from each. Intelligence consumers and providers still struggle with the balance of what drives information flow. Dissemination is the part of the intelligence cycle that delivers products to consumers, and Intelligence Dissemination Management refers to the process that encompasses organizing the dissemination of the finished intelligence. Intelligence information ranges from the equivalent of \\"we interrupt this television program\\" - to book-length studies which may, or may not, be read by policymakers. Large documents sometimes are legitimately for specialists only. Other lengthy studies may be long-term predictions. Recent worldwide events show that high-level policymakers simply do not read large studies, while staff briefers may. In principle, intelligence is merely informational, and does not recommend policies. In practice, there are at least two specialized ways in which the effects of alternatives are considered. One is variously called a net assessment, correlation of forces analysis, or strategic assessment, and goes through comparisons of capabilities of both sides, and analyzing what the effects of various actions might be. The other is to use both information on one's own capabilities - and the best information on the others, and run realistic role-playing games or simulations, with people having senior policy experience either acting as the opposition, or possibly executing one's own role in a hypothetical situation. Parameterizing Dissemination and use decisions need to consider the nature of interaction between provider and consumer, and the special requirements of security. =Models= In logistics, the two basic models are: :* push: the producer initiates the flow and the consumer receives it :* pull: the consumer requests or initiates the flow and the provider generates it. Stating these as binary models, however, does not reflect the time factor. Drawing from business, another way of thinking about flow is the idea of just-in-time (JIT) inventory management, where a minimum of parts stays in a factory or store, with a closed loop between supplier and manufacturer/seller. Sellers keep the producers informed, in real time, of their inventory and consumption rate. Suppliers adjust the rate of production and the mix of products to keep an efficient logistic pipeline filled but not overflowing. Push and pull, and JIT, models apply in intelligence as well, but are not always recognized as such. Logistical models, however, are simpler than certain cases of intelligence. Where the logistic model commands in one direction and receives in the other, some, but not all, forms of intelligence are interactive. To bring them together in a consistent model, consider, for a set of intelligence events: :*Intelligence producer activity :*Intelligence consumer activity :*Flow type caused by event Events, Producer/Consumer Activity, and Flow caused by Event Intelligence has to be relevant. Assuming that some reference is considered to be useful, such as a basic country reference, users pull information from it when they have a question. There is relatively little interaction involved in producing the reference; analysts add to it when they have new material. While analysts will do the basic work in developing indications and warning checklists, the analysts should get reality checks from the consumers. Where the analysts drive things, however, is when they issue warnings. The issuance of a warning is almost always going to generate questions. A tactical report, however, may be enough, in and of itself, not to need more clarification, but to have the consumer take immediate action. Situation monitoring involves a steady flow of analyst actions, but there will be fairly frequent refinement requests from the consumers. While analysts generate estimates, estimates may not be relevant unless consumers have been involved in defining the requirements for estimates. =Constraints= Many nations have an extremely restricted daily report that goes to the highest officials (e.g., the President's Daily Brief in the US), a more widely circulated daily that omits only the most sensitive source information, and a weekly summary at a lower classification level. More generally than the classified equivalent of all-news channels, dissemination is the process of distribution of raw or finished intelligence to the consumers whose needs initiated the intelligence requirements. Some parts of the intelligence community are reluctant to put their product onto even a classified web or wiki, due to concern that they cannot control dissemination once the material is in the published online format While modern information storage simplifies the handling and dissemination of exceptionally sensitive material, especially if it never is committed to hard copy, the systematic handling of compartmented information probably is most associated with the Special Liaison Units (SLU) originally for the distribution of British Ultra COMINT . These units, and the equivalent US Special Security Offices (SSO), usually brought material to indoctrinated recipients, perhaps waited to answer questions, and took back the material. In some large headquarters, there was a special security reading room. SLUs/SSOs had, from WWII on, dedicated, high- security communications links intended for their use alone. On occasion, senior commanders would send private messages over these channels. Prior to US adoption of the British system, officer couriers brought COMINT to the White House and State Department, staying with the reader in most cases. For a time, after an intercept was found in the wastepaper basket of FDR's military aide, the Army and Navy cryptanalytic agencies unilaterally cut off White House access. In current US practice, there may be a special security office with the physical security of a Sensitive Compartmented Information Facility (SCIF) used for Sensitive Compartmented Information (SCI) and Special Access Programs (SAP) information inside an organization. Parts of intelligence agencies, or manufacturing facilities for Special Access Projects, may, in their entirety, be considered secure for such material. Computer workstations with access to special security systems, if the overall building (e.g., CIA or NSA headquarters) is not approved for them, may be kept in the SCIF. Soviet military intelligence rezidenturas in embassies had a central record room, from which individual GRU officers would check out locked file boxes, carry them to curtained alcoves, do their work, reseal the box, and check it back in. Dissemination of intelligence products =Basic intelligence= Consumers often need to look up individual facts. Increasingly, this material is in hyperlinked online documents, such as Intellipedia, which exists at the unclassified but for official use only, SECRET, and TS/SCI levels. Different agencies have different attitudes toward such publication; a resident consultant said that the CIA Directorate of Intelligence is uncomfortable with other than an Originator Controlled (ORCON) model, while NSA seems more willing to let information flow among cleared users. =Warning and current intelligence= At a given level (e.g., alliance, country, multinational coalition, major military command, tactical operations), current intelligence centers continually provide customers, including other intelligence organization, with the all-source equivalent of daily newspapers and weekly newsmagazines. Current intelligence often is briefed directly to senior officers. Current intelligence organizations need to be concerned with both tactical and strategic warning. The goal of tactical warning is to inform operational commanders of an event requiring immediate action. Warning of attacks is tactical, indicating that an opponent is not only preparing for war, but will attack in the near term. The goal of strategic warning is to prevent major surprises for policy officials. Surprises, in part, manifest themselves in changes in the probability that some conceived-of event will take place, such that contingency plans are in place to respond to tactical warnings. A warning to national policymakers that a state or alliance intends war, or is on a course that substantially increases the risks of war and is taking steps to prepare for war, comes from: :* Attacks against the analyst's country and its interests, which can come from state or non-state actors, through military, terrorist, economic, information, and other means :* The breakdown of stability in an area or country critical to one's own side :* Key changes in adversary strategy and practice, especially with respect to terrorism or WMD proliferation attacks against the United States and its interests abroad by states and non-state actors via military, terrorist, and other means In combination, indications and warning (I&W;) provide alerts of potential or highly probable threat on the part of a hostile organizations. Indications may suggest preparation, such as an unusual pace of preventive maintenance, troop or supply transfers to shipping points, etc. Warnings are more immediate, such as the deployment of units, in combat formation, near national borders. Positive indications and warning may call for more specific \\"news reports\\" and briefings. Countries with modern intelligence and operations communications networks can, on detecting indications and warnings, can initiate collaboration tools to help analysts share information. Specific actions, ranging from border crossings in large formations, to sorties of nuclear-capable ships and aircraft, to actual explosions, move at high priority on both operational and intelligence networks. In the current environment of asymmetrical warfare by transnational groups, a given person dropping from sensors, or suddenly appearing outside their usual place, can be an indication of activity. =Tactical intelligence= According to the basic US Army manual on intelligence, \\"Fundamental to decision-making in regard to any military operation is knowledge of the environment since it enables combatants to optimize the assets they have, to target their effort, to anticipate developments and husband their force.\\" Current doctrine treats intelligence as \\"one of seven battlefield operating systems: intelligence, maneuver, fire support (FS), air defense, mobility/countermobility/survivability, combat service support (CSS), and command and control (C2) that enable commanders to build, employ, direct, and sustain combat power.\\" Exercising the intelligence function produces information in several areas: :#Intelligence Preparation of the Battlefield (IPB). IPB helps the commander understand the current situation and its background. :#Situation development, which presents potential Enemy Courses of Action (ECOA) to the commander. :#Intelligence support to Force Protection (FP) :#Conduct police intelligence operations. :#At appropriate organizational levels, contribute to national intelligence through the Joint Military Intelligence Program (JMIP). Tactical Intelligence and Related Activities (TIARA) is the mirror image of military JMIP, providing direct support to warfighters :#With supporting intelligence units, synchronize intelligence development with surveillance and reconnaissance. The Operations Officer tasks the various units, with the Intelligence Officer defining objectives and analyzes the result. :#Manage distribution of national-level information (i.e., TENCAP, or Tactical Exploitation of National Capabilities), which may be Sensitive Compartmented Information (SCI) or Special Access Programs (SAP). SCI and SAP need special access controls \\"All these tasks take place within the dimensions of threat, political, unified action, land combat operations, information, and technology. Starting with the basics: SALUTE Standardization works very well for reporting, when it is drilled in from the beginning. The US Army has a new slogan, reinforced with video games, that \\"every soldier is a sensor.\\" Standardized reporting for the most basic tactical things work under pressure, such as that which is defined by the acronym SALUTE, for a report about spotting the enemy: :*Size: how many men in the unit? :*Activity: what are they doing? :*Location: where are they? Give map coordinates if available, otherwise the best description available. :*Unit: who are they? Uniforms? Descriptions? :*Time: when did you see them? :*Equipment: what weapons do they have? Vehicles? Radios? Anything else distinctive? Friction and standardization With a trend toward multinational operations, there is even more opportunity for friction, when different doctrines (e.g., US intelligence cycle vs. NATO CCIRM) and restricted-to-own-nationals information become involved. US units, through TENCAP, are able to access national-level assets such as IMINT satellites, but rarely can share it with coalition partners. For nuclear, biological, and chemical attacks, a CBRN Warning and Reporting System (CBRN WRS) is standardized among NATO countries and Australia. The basic reports are: :*CBRN 1-Initial report, used for passing basic data compiled at unit level. :*CBRN 2-Report used for passing evaluated data. :*CBRN 3-Report used for immediate warning of predicted contamination and hazard areas. :*CBRN 4-Report used for passing monitoring and survey results. :*CBRN 5-Report used for passing information on areas of actual contamination. :*CBRN 6-Report used for passing detailed information on chemical or biological attacks. These reports, as are many such, are forms, with lines identified by letter. By text or by radio, one reads off letter codes, such as \\"CBRN 1. B(ravo) (my position). C(harlie) (direction of attack)\\" and so forth. =Beyond watch centers: Situation and interdisciplinary monitoring= As distinct from information needed for continuing tactical information, which often will come from organic or attached military intelligence units, national-level crises will need continuing and focused situation monitoring at the national or multinational level. To be able to establish situation-specific task forces or topical centers, there must be adequate basic intelligence, preassignments to task forces, and appropriate collaborative tools (e.g., Intellipedia) and basic intelligence. Situation intelligence products need to be relevant to the level of reflection of the HQ making use of it: strategic (EU HQ, Operation Command HQ), operational (in-theatre force command HQ) or tactical (HQ deploying a force component in a local operation); In some cases, the existing current intelligence, or indications & warnings, centers of national agencies may be adequate. The next step would be to set up conference calls or other collaborative techniques to link the relevant specialists in operations centers of different agencies, different countries, or perhaps multinational centers. These collaborations will produce periodic situation reports (SITREPS) to be disseminated to appropriate policymakers. It also disseminates other daily intelligence updates and products. Longer range, more intractable intelligence challenges are addressed by grouping analytic and operational personnel from concerned agencies into close-knit functional units. Examples at both the national and multinational levels include counterterrorism (e.g., Singapore counterterrorism and ASEAN counterterrorism training center, transnational crime and drug enforcements (e.g., Interpol) and verification of compliance with nonproliferation treaties (e.g., Comprehensive Nuclear-Test- Ban Treaty Organization (CTBTO, to be established)). =Estimates= Estimates are coordinated analyses, by the intelligence community at the national levels, or by the various intelligence staff sections at a command level, of the various courses of action available to an actor of interest, and the likelihood of each. Estimates primarily consider the unilateral actions of the other side, or its actions in response to a well-defined actions of one's own side. Estimates are not strategic assessments, which examine a broader scope of strengths and weaknesses between one's side and that of another. Most countries with a well-developed system of estimates have different types, with different time scales, and representing either an intelligence community consensus, or possibly an ideologically oriented group that justifies a premade conclusion. In the US, National Intelligence Estimates are detailed analyses, typically in the tens to hundreds of pages, produced once a reasonable consensus is reached. These documents may contain dissenting footnotes, also called reclamas, documenting a disagreement by a particular organization or specialists. NIEs are typically associated with standing task groups. Special National Intelligence Estimates (SNIE) are short-term community documents, in response to a specific customer requirement. There is controversy over the US Office of Special Plans and whether it bypassed the intelligence community cross-checking process. Winston Churchill had his own intelligence advisor, Sir Desmond Morton, who might bypass the WWII estimative process. Estimative intelligence helps policymakers to think strategically about long-term threats by discussing the implications of a range of possible outcomes and alternative scenarios. They are not strictly operational, but fall into a special analysis and dissemination category because they usually involve multi-agency coordination. In the topmost article of this series, Sun Tzu was quoted . The Griffiths translation does speak of \\"estimates\\", but, according to Pillsbury, a new translation from the Chinese Academy of Military Science argues that Griffiths mistranslated: \\"strategic assessments\\" is more accurate than \\"estimates\\". Between intelligence and action Going beyond the pure intelligence is the assessment of known capabilities of one's own resources versus the best estimate of opponent capabilities. Clausewitz' book On WarWikisource:On War#On the nature of war .28Book I.29 asks a simple question: How can the national leadership know how much force will be necessary to bring to bear against a potential enemy? Clausewitz replies, \\"We must gauge the character of . . . (the enemy) government and people and do the same in regard to our own. Finally, we must evaluate the political sympathies of other states and the effect the war may have on them. Clausewitz warns that studying enemy weaknesses without considering one's own capacity to take advantage of those weaknesses is a mistake. Many first heard of the term centers of gravity in the context of Desert Storm or COL John Warden, but Warden's contribution was adapting the idea to air campaigns, of the Clausewitz idea of a \\"center of gravity,\\" a feature that if successfully attacked, can stop the enemy's war effort. Assessment requires considering the potential interaction of the two sides. According to Clausewitz, \\"One must keep the dominant characteristics of both belligerents in mind.\\" Net assessment First and foremost, Net Assessment is nothing but the capability to analyse and measure the strategical assets of each warring side (for example, how many tanks it has, how many soldiers etc.). But Net Assessment is not only the measurement of material matters, but it is also the capability to try to estimate moral assets such as a people's will to fight in a given war, how far a state is capable of waging war, how willing are their generals and soldiers to fight in a war and other moral aspects of warfare in general. In the US, strategic assessment is one step beyond intelligence estimates, although intelligence analysts may well participate in the subsequent process of strategic assessment. The result, called a net assessment in the US and the correlation of forces in the fUSSR, are not themselves contingency plans, but are critical to the formulation of plans. Strategic assessment, above all else, is an examination of interactions, rather than the likely unilateral actions of another side or coalition. Formalizing the role of a command historian was one of the first steps in the evolution of a true general staff, as opposed to the personal entourage of a commander. By applying the planned assessment methodology to historical data, the methodology, cautiously, may be validated. Caution is needed because contingencies can make historical behavior obsolete. In fact, a widely praised explanation for the causes of war is precisely that strategic assessments were in conflict prior to the initiation of combat‚Äîone side seldom starts a war knowing in advance it will lose. Thus, we may presume there are almost always miscalculations in strategic assessments of varying types according to the nature of the national leadership that made the assessment. =How not to do net assessment= How have major nations conducted strategic assessments of the security environment? There is no one standard. There are some errors that repeat. The Office of Net Assessment, in the US Department of Defense, under Andrew Marshall, commissioned a set of seven historical examples of strategic assessment from 1938 to 1940, compares the pre-WWII equivalent of net assessment by seven countries. Mistakes in these assessments become \\"lessons learned\\" are relevant to any effort, Pillsbury's focus, to understand how the Chinese leadership conducts strategic assessment of its future security environment. In his specification for the study, Marshall specified four motivations for assessment: :* Foreseeing potential conflicts :* Comparing strengths and predicting outcomes in given contingencies :* Monitoring current developments and being alerted to developing problems :* Warning of imminent military danger. The main problem was how to frame assessments, particularly with regard to political-military factors such as who were the potential threats and potential allies, and what international alignments would be vital to the outcomes of future wars. Simplistic force ratios and assumptions An early but obsolete approach to estimation was a very simple quantitative one, using Lanchester's Laws. A simple comparison of forces of roughly equal capability can come down to number of soldiers, ratio of attackers to defenders, defensive quality of the terrain, and other basics. That sort of model breaks down, however, when the forces are dissimilar in quality of leadership, troop morale and initiative, or doctrine and technology. Japan made this mistake as it prepared for WWII, putting garrisons on a large number of islands, and considering their battleships one of their centers of gravity. Japan's early WWII strategy towards the US, for example, made numerous assumptions that would lead the US Fleet to sail into the Western Pacific, to fight, on advantageous terms for the Japanese, a \\"Decisive Battle\\". Unfortunately for the Japanese, the US did not choose to make battleships its primary arm, fight for every Japanese outpost, use submarines only against the warrior targets of warships, or require a return to a fleet anchorage for regrouping. Intelligence was not a preferred assignment in the Japanese military, and their operations planners tended to make optimistic assumptions. An eccentric but incredibly creative US Marine, Earl Ellis, however, did foresee the US strategy for the Pacific in the 1920s, and set a standard for long-term estimates and net assessment France, as well as Japan, used overly simplistic assumptions and calculations in assessing the 1939 situation with Germany. Army manpower and equipment were roughly equal, with a slight advantage to France. French tanks, individually, were superior in weapons and protection to their German equivalent. German air power, however, was nearly double that of France. At its highest governmental levels, France did not understand the way in which Germany would combine tanks and aircraft, closely coordinated, and drive quickly into the rear, with German infantry securing the breaches. Ironically, a fairly junior officer, named Charles de Gaulle, had described just such tactics as Heinz Guderian conceived in Blitzkrieg. In the areas of breakthrough, the Germans achieved at least a 4:1 advantage by not advancing on a broad front. Numeric ratios alone, as in the Lanchester equations, could not deal with concentration of force, or the force multiplier effect of coordinated air and armor. France also failed to consider that Germany might first defeat East European allies such as Poland and Czechoslovakia. The lesson for intelligence here is not to assume a very limited range of allies, or that certain avenues of attack, such as the Germans through the Ardennes or the Low Countries, are impossible. The analyst has the responsibility to let consumers, who may be subject matter experts, know about unlikely scenarios, as well as giving the consumers the detail they want on the likely scenarios. Psychological and diplomatic assumptions Another mistake is to assume which nations and groups will see the country doing an assessment as a friend. In planning for WWII, the United States developed the \\"Rainbow Series\\" of war plans; the serious assumption was that Japan would be the only significant enemy. While this was wargamed again and again, there had been little analysis of a two-front war with the Axis. For WWII, Britain had assumed France would be an effective ally, rather than quickly defeated. Britain also did not consider the effect of the Soviet Union as a second front. This was understandable given the initial Molotov‚ÄìRibbentrop Pact before Germany attacked the USSR, but forced the reevaluation of the European balance of power. Not all WWII assumptions were flawed. The USSR assumed Japanese neutrality toward the Soviets, which was, indeed, the case until the USSR declared war at the very end of WWII. In 1990‚Äì1991, while the US had assumed it would be able to base troops in Saudi Arabia to meet a threat to that nation, such as the invasion of Kuwait, that was not a prior commitment by the Saudis. Even when preliminary negotiations were positive, the size of the proposed American force shocked the Saudis. For a time, until the King was convinced, the US assumption was just that. Iraqis did not greet American troops with flowers in 2003. Assumptions about opposing decisionmaking Robert S. McNamara, US Secretary of Defense during most of the Vietnam War, came from a background of quantitative analysis both in conventional warfare and industry, but appeared to assume that the North Vietnamese leadership would use logic similar to his own. Lyndon B. Johnson, however, personalized conflict, seeing Ho Chi Minh as someone to dominate. Both assumptions were severely flawed. Intelligence analysts need to estimate on what is known about the opposition, not what one's own leadership would like them to be. Unfortunately, as McMaster points out, Johnson and McNamara tended to ignore intelligence that contradicted their preconceptions. Assumptions about doctrine and capabilities It can be dangerous to assume wartime capabilities of an opponent, based on their published doctrines, known training exercises, deployments, and news reporting. There was widespread belief that some of the key US weapons systems, such as the M1A1 Abrams tank, AH-64 Apache helicopter, stealth technology and precision guided munitions would not be effective in the deserts of Saudi Arabia, Kuwait and Iraq. While detailed postwar analysis showed that early reports about weapons effectiveness were overstated, precision guidance was a significant force multiplier. An unexpected force multiplier was GPS, which let Coalition soldiers go off-road and move through the desert as ships moved through the seas, where Iraqis stayed on roads for ease of navigation. =Performing strategic assumptions= What goes into strategic assessment? A RAND Corporation study starts with assessing national power, based on resources, the nation's ability to use those resources, and the capabilities of both its standing military and how that military could be multiplied by national mobilization. Augmented model of components of national power, considering operations other than war This study, however, was focused on conventional warfare, and did not consider the much more common national military and nonmilitary options other than war. The latter, variously known as nation- building, peace operations, or stability operations While many of his ideas are controversial, Thomas P.M. Barnett created a paradigm that better combines the military and nonmilitary aspects. His fundamental model says \\"The problem with most discussion of globalization is that too many experts treat it as a binary outcome: Either it is great and sweeping the planet, or it is horrid and failing humanity everywhere. Neither view really works, because globalization as a historical process is simply too big and too complex for such summary judgments. Instead, this new world must be defined by where globalization has truly taken root and where it has not. \\"Show me where globalization is thick with network connectivity, financial transactions, liberal media flows, and collective security, and I will show you regions featuring stable governments, rising standards of living, and more deaths by suicide than murder. These parts of the world I call the Functioning Core, or Core. But show me where globalization is thinning or just plain absent, and I will show you regions plagued by politically repressive regimes, widespread poverty and disease, routine mass murder, and‚Äîmost important‚Äîthe chronic conflicts that incubate the next generation of global terrorists. These parts of the world I call the Non-Integrating Gap, or Gap\\". Barnett states the approach as creating two forces, \\"Leviathan\\" (a term from Thomas Hobbes) and \\"System Administrator\\". The system administrator force focuses on connecting nations to the \\"Core\\". Typically, it would be a multinational organization, not primarily a military force although containing police and security forces, and having regular military force available. \\"Leviathan\\" would be a \\"First World\\", network-centric combat force that can take down the conventional military of almost any nation. While Barnett's arguments that the 2003 invasion of Iraq are questionable in hindsight, one can also observe that the invasion used Leviathan alone, and an outcome might have been different had a System Administrator force been following Leviathan, with adequate resources and legitimacy. =US contemporary= In the broadest definition, \\"strategic assessment\\" implies a forecast of peacetime and wartime competition between two nations or two alliances that includes the identification of enemy vulnerabilities and weaknesses in comparison to the strengths and advantages of one's own side. Many lessons have been learned, including perspective on balancing security of information against use of information. In the 1950s, RAND Corporation analysts who were doing the studies of Soviet power for the Defense Department, was producing badly skewed results, based on the Soviets being more dangerous than they were in reality. The analysts were not allowed to know, for security reasons, that Soviet Bison and Bear bombers had critical reliability problems. More bombers might crash in the Arctic than could arrive in North America . US strategies, therefore, were less risk-taking. When the senior commanders and the intelligence community eventually found out the effects of the disconnect, it led to some reexamination of the tradeoffs between having absolutely secure intelligence versus intelligence that could actually affect policy. The practice of strategic assessment by the U.S. Department of Defense in the past 25 years has been divided into six categories of studies and analysis: National/Multinational military balance \\"Measure and forecast trends in various military balances, such as the maritime balance, the Northeast Asian balance, the power-projection balance, the strategic nuclear balance, the Sino-Soviet military balance, and the European military balance between NATO and the former Warsaw Pact. Some of these studies look 20 or 30 years into the future to examine trends and discontinuities in technology, economic indicators, and other factors.\\" Weapons and force comparisons \\"Weapons and force comparisons, with efforts to produce judgments about military effectiveness that sometimes \\"revealed U.S. and Soviet differences in measuring combat effectiveness and often showed the contrast between what each side considered important in combat.\\" Validation \\"validation examines lessons of the past using historical evaluations as well as gathering data on past performance of weapons used in the context of specific conflicts. Red Team Red Team perceptions of foreign decision makers and even the process by which foreign institutions make strategic assessments. As Andrew Marshall, Director, Net Assessment, wrote in 1982 about assessing the former Soviet Union, \\"A major component of any assessment of the adequacy of the strategic balance should be our best approximation of a Soviet-style assessment of the strategic balance. But this must not be the standard U.S. calculations done with slightly different assumptions . . . . rather it should be, to the extent possible, an assessment structured as the Soviet would structure it, using those scenarios they see as most likely and their criteria and ways of measuring outcomes . . . the Soviet calculations are likely to make different assumptions about scenarios and objectives, focus attention upon different variables, include both long-range and theater forces (conventional as well as nuclear), and may at the technical assessment level, perform different calculations, use different measures of effectiveness, and perhaps use different assessment processes and methods. The result is that Soviet assessments may substantially differ from American assessments. Studies analyzing perceptions are difficult because the data used often must be inferred from public writings and speeches. Implicit biases of Americans based on our own education and culture must also be avoided.\\" Tool research :* Search for new analytical tools, such as developing higher \\"firepower scores\\" than may be used for the Air Force and Navy as well as the initial inventor, the ground forces. In the early 1980s, a multiyear effort was funded at The RAND Corporation to develop a Strategy Assessment System (RSAS) as a flexible analytic device for examining combat outcomes of alternative scenarios. Assessing alternatives :* Professional analyses of particular issues of concern to the Secretary of Defense that may involve identifying competitive advantages and distinctive competencies of each size military force posture; highlighting important trends that may change a long-term balance; identifying future opportunities and risks in the military competition; and appraising the strengths and weaknesses of U.S. forces in light of long-term shifts in the security environment. Past practitioners from the Office of the Secretary of Defense have underscored the need for American strategic assessment to focus on long-term historical patterns rather than on =Russian contemporary= The most relevant comparison for China may be the Soviet Union, but this is also the most secret. As Professor Earl Ziemke put it, after three decades of research on Soviet military affairs, even when he tried to use historical data to look back from 1990 to 1940: The Soviet net assessment process cannot be directly observed. Like a dark object in outer space, its probable nature can be discerned only from interactions with visible surroundings. Fortunately, its rigidly secret environment has been somewhat subject to countervailing conditions. . . . Tukhachevsky and his associates conducted relatively open discussion in print. =Chinese Contemporary= There is intense secrecy about Chinese national security matters, but comparisons with other nations' processes of strategic assessment can increase our understanding of how China may assess its future security environment. By viewing China in comparative perspective, it may be possible to understand better how China deals with its assessment problems. \\"Comparing the Soviet structure with Chinese materials in the 1990s, it is apparent from the way in which Soviet strategic assessment was performed in the 1930s that a number of similarities, at least in institutional roles and the vocabulary of Marxism-Leninism, can also be seen in contemporary China. The leader of the Communist Party publicly presented a global strategic assessment to periodic Communist Party Congresses. The authors of the military portions of the assessment came from two institutions that have counterparts in Beijing today and were prominent in Moscow in the 1930s: the General Staff Academy and the National War College. Another similarity was that the Communist Party leader chaired a defense council or main military committee and in these capacities attended peacetime military exercises and was involved deciding the details of military strategy, weapons acquisition, and war planning. In the US, there are independent or ideologically associated \\"think tanks\\", and there are government contract research organizations both not-for-profit and for-profit. In China, the primary difference between these Chinese institutes and American research institutes is their \\"ownership.\\" Research institutes are \\"owned\\" by the major institutional players in the national security decision making process in China. Members of these institutes often decline to discuss in any detail the exact nature of their internal reports. They are not puppets, however, and many research institutions are important in their own right for the creative ideas they produce. Their leaders carry great prestige and have high rank in the Communist Party.Pillsbury Strategic gaming Gaming, when it involves players that have experience at the levels at which they are playing, can complement or validate strategic assessment. This section is not intended to be a general discussion of strategic gaming, but to address the role that intelligence material will play in constructing and playing the game. It is not uncommon, at national levels, to have intelligence analysts in the \\"Red Force\\" or other nations in a multilateral game, play their counterpart or an equivalent commander in the country or group on which they are expert. =Participation by top-level policymakers= Even at national-level games, it has always been the US practice never to have the incumbent President as an actual player, although some have observed. The rationale is preventing any adversary from knowing, with high confidence, how a President will decide in a given circumstance. The Presidential player typically is a former Cabinet member with extensive politicomilitary experience. Britain, however, may regard top-level games as a valuable practice exercise for policymakers. Margaret Thatcher was reputed to play in these games, and be very serious about them. =Warfighter and battle labs= Strategic gaming is to be distinguished from training exercises, although there are training exercises for generals at the division (two-star) and corps (three-star) levels. As opposed to the battalion and brigade level troop exercises at the National Training Center (heavy/armored forces, Ft. Irwin, CA) and light forces at Joint Readiness Training Center (light forces, Ft. Polk, VA), what are now called Warfighter (formerly BCTP) exercises are apt to be command posts only, with controllers simulating subordinate units. This is realistic, as in modern warfare, the forces are so widely dispersed that senior generals could not physically watch all their forces. As a result of the \\"command post in the sky\\" excesses of Vietnam, with stacked helicopters well up the chain of command, micromanaging small battles, there is a reluctance to let generals get too close. =Cold War gaming= During the Cold War when major nuclear exchanges were a real possibility, the two sides understood one another reasonably well. Over time, even more so after the end of the USSR, Russia and the US have taken various steps to avoid military misunderstanding, such as putting liaison teams into one another's' strategic warning centers. In the beginning of the Cold War, strategic gaming, given the \\"massive retaliation\\" strategies of the earlier parts of the Cold War, concentrated on major nuclear exchanges. One of the things taught by these games was that the resultant exchanges would cause huge casualties, but might not be politically meaningful. It can be argued that war gaming results were an incentive, in the late fifties and early sixties, to bring nuclear targeting under tighter civilian policy control in the US, and start to explore more limited scenarios such as counterforce, counterforce with avoidance and \\"blunting\\" conventional forces. Tactical nuclear warfare limited to the oceans was examined as an option that might not escalate. The actual gaming, however, appeared to disprove some assumptions based on simple force ratios. Originally, the GLOBAL series of naval wargames assumed that the US Mediterranean fleet would be obliterated in hours, and the Soviet submarine threat would stop major transatlantic movement by US forces. Especially with cooperation from other services, these assumptions were not found to be consistently true. A side effect of learning how interdependence could help all services was improved cooperation among the military intelligence and operations personnel. Scenarios began to be explored that involved conventional warfare between the US and USSR, and proxy war. As important as the joint, interactive nature of the game was, GLOBAL increasingly was recognized for the realism injected into the decisionmaking that represented what might be expected in a global superpower military confrontation. Also significant in these early games was an evolution of offensive strategies on the part of the \\"Blue\\" force as the players began to appreciate the survivability of forward-engaged maritime forces and the synergistic contributions of joint and combined forces. Equally revealing was the shift over time to an outcome that favored conventional rather than nuclear escalation, and the opinion that US and NATO forces would ultimately emerge victorious from a conventional war of extended duration once the economic capacities of the West had shifted to military production. Issues of particular interest provided the foundation for the iterative process of \\"game-study-game.\\" They included the following: :*The absolute necessity for the prompt use of strategic warning :*The requirement to examine military strategies for protracted conventional war :*The need to explore the longer- term effects of horizontal escalation :*The benefits of early identification of technological needs \\"One of the reasons for this favorable appraisal [of GLOBAL] was the growing involvement of the military services and relevant civilian agencies of the federal government in a common forum. Another was the opportunity to challenge conventional wisdom by imposing real-world constraints on untested theories. \\"Finally, this sorting out of the conventional from the game-tested wisdom helped the players, in the real world after the exercise was over, to focus on the pertinent second-order issues. The games were educational for the intelligence community, in learning the sort of information that policymakers needed in a critical situation, in understanding the information that needed to be researched even to create a plausible scenario. Policymakers and senior commanders learned how to use intelligence more effectively, and how to make use of the community resources. They also provided an opportunity to test new strategies and tactics, and sometimes explore the potential of weapons systems under consideration.\\" =Contemporary gaming: the 1920s in a new version?= \\"Andy Marshall, the Director of Net Assessment in the Pentagon and a notable consumer of wargaming, has argued that the circumstances facing the United States today, in terms of strategic uncertainty, are quite similar to those we confronted in the early 1920s. The beginning of that interwar period saw the emergence of new technologies with startling potential military applications.\\" Threats were unclear, although Japan was seen as the likely enemy. It must be remembered that no intelligence community existed at the time. Can the modern intelligence community establish ways to test a wide range of opponents in a context of a \\"system of systems\\"? Between the World Wars, games tended to be service specific. One service's intelligence was unlikely to consult with another, so the interactions of land-based aircraft, other than naval aviation, might not be considered. The British also did such games, yet Churchill described, in his history of WWII, that the Sinking of Prince of Wales and Repulse was his greatest shock of the war. Perhaps because the Navy was more used to map exercises than the Army, the Naval War College was able to develop new concepts through gaming. Part of this was defining the requirements \\"for a measured, step-by-step offensive campaign, and began to appreciate the potential of naval aviation to operate as a principal offensive system, rather than as a \\"scouting arm,\\" for the main battle fleet.\\" The aviators were both providers of intelligence as scouts, and consumers of intelligence for strike planning. What trends appear to be emerging from contemporary wargaming that can help shape our (significantly downsized) armed forces for the next century, as well as planning the intelligence community to meet the warfighters' needs? What are the lessons we have learned and where are the lessons to be learned? Priorities, all intelligence-dependent, seem to include: surveillance and precision strike capabilities, information technology and warfare, advanced battle management, and mutually supportive assets, the latter including military and national intelligence. Surveillance and precision strike capabilities Post Cold War games at the Naval War College indicated that aircraft carriers had to be faster than cruisers in order to survive. Similar survival-type games are needed to test current and planned precision strike platforms and systems, such as the survival of carrier battle groups in the littoral, a comparison of carrier battle groups with future surface combatant concepts, and the range and stealthiness required for carrier-based aircraft to prove effective and survivable. Attention must be paid to the survivability of intelligence cycle components, from sensors to dissemination, and what happens when they are degraded. From the first Army AAN wargame, the essential role of space in C3I and ISR was apparent. Intelligence collection caspabilities were considered early in the planning process, not as an afterthought. The criticality of space systems was such that intelligence needed to determine the threat to them, and then develop alternatives (e.g., UAVs) if the space-based systems are disabled. These space-based systems are not limited to pure intelligence; consider the dependence of both fighting and intelligence functions on GPS. Recognizing that criticality is one reason that complementary, terrestrial eLORAN is attracting interest. Tight coupling of sensors and precision attack might shift frameworks to a \\"halting\\" rather than a \\"buildup\\" or \\"counterattack\\" framework. Gaming can explore the intelligence requirements to know what are the centers of gravity for halting frameworks. Information technology and warfare Current games, especially when using actual C3I equipment, are exploring the amounts of intelligence information that may flow, and the communications support that will be needed. games and cases point to the importance of developing visions of future conflict, and working them to discern how changes in the external environment could cause the next war to differ from the last. Experience in Kosovo demonstrated friction when adequate intelligence management was deployed early, and friction in Bosnia when it was not. Wargames now need to explore the effects of portions of one's own, or one's opponent, C3I and ISR capabilities being disabled. In the 1930s, naval officers began to understand the need for task force organization. Games have to explore the interoperability of intelligence systems for ad hoc, interservice task forces. There is a need to understand what happens if the opponent has comparably sophisticated organizational flexibility, C3I, and ISR. Are the services anticipating the changing nature of future conflict in their wargaming? Are the experiences from those wargames enriching or challenging the services' vision? Are the lessons learned in the wargames played by the separate services being transferred into the joint arena? In other words, when it comes to wargames, who's winning and who's losing. Major games The major games, authorized by explicit Congressional funding, all taught lessons, including that the services were not starting from a terribly coherent future picture. Services reached a bit less into the future, and made significant changes to their doctrinal frameworks. This process was especially informational to military intelligence producers and consumers, as well as to the analysts concerned with technological development and where and when to focus. =US Navy: GLOBAL= Played between 1979 and 1990, the games during the Cold War contributed to the \\"Maritime Strategy\\" doctrinal framework for forward engagements of the Soviets. After the fall of the USSR, however, the threat became more diffuse and the games were criticized. They led to the new framework \\"From the Sea\\", associated with intelligence-intensive \\"network-centric warfare\\". Again, both intelligence and operations people learned more about each other's needs and capabilities. =US Army: Army After Next/Transformation Wargame= Beginning in 1997 the Army's Training and Doctrine Command (TRADOC) began annual \\"Army After Next\\" (AAN) games‚Äîthe AAN being viewed as what the presently planned \\"digitized\\" Army (Force XXI) would interact with a strong enemy in the year 2020. One surprising result was that air and naval fire support might be more flexible than the traditional organic artillery, although the role of precision guidance for organic fire support became even more obvious to the Army and Marines. This fire support, however, was dependent on space-based C3I, as well as a much greater Army ISR capability and networking all of these into a \\"system of systems\\" Some findings included: :*The strong influence of space-based systems on ground combat operations :*The vulnerability of ground forces to information warfare attacks :*A reluctance on the part of national leaders to commit ground troops to a region early in a crisis :*Dramatically shortened time frames in which critical decisions had to be made Early AAN results led to opposition from senior leaders, who regarded their comments as reality checks. Some senior officers suggested that using technologies from 20 years in the future was the equivalent of introducing supersonic aircraft into a 1920 wargame, not completely unreasonable given the exponential rate of technology improvement. The 20 year target, and the associated \\"History of the Future\\" document, was intended to allow examination of concepts without worry about budget, but the interaction between leadership and gamers educated all in what was realistic. This lesson might be quite important for intelligence personnel doing longer-term estimates. As a result, the AAN wargame has been restructured to forecast a 10- to 15-year future and, in 2000, the name of the series was changed to the Transformation wargame. Both the games and real- world Army experience has taught that simply calling something \\"transformational\\" will not make it so, and tough testing, in games as well as battle laboratories, is essential.. The Army had to experience intelligence problems in Kosovo before it could define the problem well enough to include it in games. AAN were not intended to be forecasts, but a way to test concepts. \\"By repeating the games, the plan was to conduct comparative analysis as scenarios and adversaries varied over the long term. In this case, however, it appears that a confrontation with an unpleasant present, rather than the repetitive pull of a coherent vision of the future, was the catalyst providing new direction for Army planning and wargaming. =US Air Force: Global engagement/aerospace future capabilities= Air Force experience, early in the gaming process, revealed, as with the other services, a need for a more coherent concept of future challenges. As with the other services, a new doctrinal framework evolved, the Air Force version being \\"Expeditionary Air Forces,\\" therefore, was essential in giving the games purpose and substance. Expeditionary Air Forces involve new mixed units of different aircraft types, but are not as disruptive as early frameworks that assumed extensive use of space-based systems, UAVs, and extremely long-range operations. Just as the Army found looking forward 20 years was unrealistic, the Air Force reexamined the chances of revolutionary assets being affordable and implemented in a more modest future. The intelligence community could give them options of potential opponents' vulnerabilities, so the games helped focus attention on the most critical of the disruptive technologies. In turn, the intelligence community learned much more about what aggressive air warfare needed from them. Millennium Challenge 2002 While this game generated considerable political controversy, it is being mentioned here as a reminder of how asymmetrical modern conflict can be, and the challenges that asymmetric thinking can present to intelligence capabilities and assumptions. LTG Paul K. Van Riper, USMC (ret.) commanded the enemy military in a Gulf scenario. According to Robert B. Oakley, ambassador and later special envoy to Somalia, who played the Red civilian leader, Van Riper was \\"out-thinking\\" Blue Force from the first day of the exercise. He also maneuvered Red forces frequently, potentially defeating non-real-time IMINT. A relevant point to this discussion was that by using motorcycle messengers, he neutralized Blue COMINT capabilities. While it obviously will not be discussed in the open literature, a serious question arises of how dependent a Blue network-centric force is on its SIGINT capability against the other side. If they operate under strict radio silence (i.e., EMCON), will other intelligence collection systems take up the slack? This is not a question only for the US, since other major powers may find themselves in asymmetric conflicts, but without as many other sensors as the US, especially space-based ones that are probably immune from attack by a low-technology opponent. Van Riper, in a leaked email, said \\"Instead of a free-play, two-sided game ‚Ä¶ it simply became a scripted exercise.\\" The conduct of the game did not allow \\"for the concepts of rapid decisive operations, effects-based operations, or operational net assessment to be properly assessed. ‚Ä¶ It was in actuality an exercise that was almost entirely scripted to ensure a Blue 'win.' \\" At one point in the game, when Blue's fleet entered the Persian Gulf, he sank some of the ships with suicide-bombers in speed boats. At various times in their separate war games before WWII, the US and Japanese navies \\"refloated\\" certain ships, which apparently was done in Millennium Challenge. \\"Exercise officials denied him the opportunity to use his own tactics and ideas against Blue, and on several occasions directed [Red Force] not to use certain weapons systems against Blue. It even ordered him to reveal the location of Red units.\\" One of the priority areas for US military research is littoral. While existing shipboard and possibly airborne radars might not have detected the speedboats, there is work in wake detection with MASINT sensors that might have picked up the boats. Was such a sensor capability being assumed? If there is such a sensor, it would be likely to be highly classified. Without exact knowledge of what happened, the situation is not as clear as either side might have it. In the Louisiana Maneuvers of 1940, George S. Patton moved an armored division with unprecedented speed, eventually capturing the commander of the opposing army, Ben Lear. Lear was \\"repatriated\\", in the sense that there were many tactical ideas that Lear's army was to test for overall US knowledge. While Patton's act was dramatic, it disrupted some of the tests for which the exercise was being run. In Van Riper's case, were there things that his actions prevented from being tested, or was he demonstrating US weaknesses that the political level did not want known? In his email about quitting the game, \\"You don't come to a conclusion beforehand and then work your way to that conclusion. You see how the thing plays out.\\" He added, somewhat ominously in retrospect, \\"My main concern was we'd see future forces trying to use these things when they've never been properly grounded in any sort of an experiment.\\" Finally, the paper quoted a retired Army officer who has played in several war games with Van Riper. \\"What he's done is, he's made himself an expert in playing Red, and he's real obnoxious about it,\\" the officer said. \\"He will insist on being able to play Red as freely as possible and as imaginatively and creatively, within the bounds of the framework of the game and the technology horizons and all that, as possible.

Some vehicles listed were concept vehicles, which utilised an internal combustion engine and an electric motor, and were used for research and development (R&D;) for potential future use of the technology into possible series production. Audi launched its first hybrid concept car in 1989 called the Audi Duo, and was the first European company to sell a hybrid in 1997, though only in very small numbers. Audi Duo The original Audi Duo (styled duo) was created in 1989 and was first shown at the Frankfurt Motor Show, and was based on the Audi C3 100 Avant. It was a petrol engine/electric hybrid concept vehicle. It was powered five-cylinder petrol engine that drove the front wheels, and a part-time electric motor that could be activated when the vehicle was stationary, developing and drove the rear wheels. It used nickel-cadmium batteries. Audi 100 Duo II Audi 100 Duo second generation concept car was introduced in 1991. It featured Audi's \\"trademark\\" quattro permanent four-wheel drive system. Powered by a four-cylinder 2.0 L engine with ), with a electric motor for the rear wheels when required. In electric mode the front axle was disconnected, and in this mode the Duo could reach a claimed top speed of and the sodium-sulfur battery sufficient for 80 km (49.71 miles). Audi A4 Duo III The Audi Duo III was introduced in 1997, based on the Audi A4 Avant, and was the only Duo to ever make it into series production. The Duo III used the Turbocharged Direct Injection (TDI) diesel engine producing , which was coupled with a water-cooled electric motor. Both engine and motor powered the front wheels only, unlike the two previous concept Duos. There was a switch inside the cabin for changing between the electric motor and the engine. The batteries would be recharged during highway or country driving, or by plugging the car into an AC power outlet. The electric motor could also recover energy during deceleration and in electric mode the Duo had a range of approximately 50 kilometers (31.07 miles) and a top speed of . The hybrid was unable to achieve fuel efficiency much greater than the standard 1.9 TDI, due to the extra weight the lead gelatin batteries added. There was little demand for this hybrid due to its high price, and thus only about 100 Duos were produced. The Duo was the first European hybrid ever put into production and up until early 2011 the only Audi. Audi Q7 hybrid 4.2 FSI quattro Audi unveiled the Audi Q7 hybrid 4.2 FSI quattro, which uses their Fuel Stratified Injection (FSI) 4.2-litre V8 engine, at the 2005 Frankfurt Motor Show. Audi had planned to have the Q7 hybrid as a part of their 2008 model range, but never did. Audi metroproject quattro The metroproject quattro is a supermini/sub-compact, and was shown to the public at the 2007 Tokyo Motor Show. Under the bonnet/hood is a 1.4-litre TSI petrol engine, producing . This will distribute its torque of to the front wheels via an 'S tronic' Direct-Shift Gearbox. However, in the back of the car, beneath a perspex peephole, is a electric motor which drives the rear axle, and can generate an additional of torque, designed to create a zero emissions driving experience in residential or city areas, and increase torque while the 1.4 TSI engine is accelerating. A lithium-ion battery pack supports a range of up to . In electric mode, the car has a top speed of more than . When both the engine and electric motors are working in unison, the car is transformed into a genuine quattro, with a combined torque output of being shared between all four wheels. Stop-start technology will be utilised, as will regenerative braking. As a result, Audi claim a 15% improvement in fuel efficiency when compared to exclusive use of the internal combustion engine. The A1 started production in 2010 but without a hybrid. There are also no plans to add such later; instead Audi plan an all-electric version. Audi Q5 hybrid The Q5 is Audi's first large-scale production hybrid model on sale, first announced at the end of 2010, and sales started during 2011. Powered by a 2.0-litre TFSI turbocharged and direct injected petrol engine, producing 208 bhp, and a electric motor providing a combined total output for the hybrid system is 241 bhp and 354 lb ft. Drive goes to all four wheels, and the gearbox is an eight- speed automatic, but without a torque converter as the electric motor also acts as a starter motor and as a generator. The 1.3 kW lithium-ion battery sits under the boot floor.

Function  NF-Œ∫B has been detected in numerous cell types that express cytokines, chemokines, growth factors, cell adhesion molecules, and some acute phase proteins in health and in various disease states. NF-Œ∫B is activated by a wide variety of stimuli such as cytokines, oxidant-free radicals, inhaled particles, ultraviolet irradiation, and bacterial or viral products. Inappropriate activation of NF-kappa-B has been linked to inflammatory events associated with autoimmune arthritis, asthma, septic shock, lung fibrosis, glomerulonephritis, atherosclerosis, and AIDS. In contrast, complete and persistent inhibition of NF-kappa-B has been linked directly to apoptosis, inappropriate immune cell development, and delayed cell growth. For reviews, see Chen et al. (1999) and Baldwin (1996).[supplied by OMIM]  Clinical significance  Mutation of the NFKB2 gene has been linked to Common variable immunodeficiency (CVID) as the cause of the disease. Other genes might also be responsible. The frequency of NFKB2 mutation in CVID population is yet to be established. The protein NFKB2 can become mutated and lead to hereditary endocrine and immuneodeficiences. The mutation occurs at the C-terminus of NFKB2 and it causes common variable immunodeficienciency which in turn causes endocrine deficiency and immunodeficiencies. A NFKB2 mutation can cause things like adrenocorticotropic hormone deficiency and DAVID syndrome which is a pituitary hormone deficiency and CVID. The mutations that occur within the C-terminus affect the serine 866 and 870. These serines are considered phosphorylation sites for NFKB2. These mutations at the serine‚Äôs in the C-terminus lead to CVID in combination with other endocrine deficiencies. These endocrine deficiencies along with the mutation of NFKB2, lead scientists to believe that mutation of NFKB2 is a rare hereditary disease called DAVID‚Äôs disease.  Interactions  NFKB2 has been shown to interact with: * BCL3, * BTRC, * MAP3K8, * NFKB1, * NFKBIE, * RELA, * RELB, * REL, and * TSC22D3.

Biological function PITP has been also shown to be an essential component of the polyphosphoinositide synthesis machinery and is hence required for proper signalling by epidermal growth factor and f-Met-Leu-Phe, as well as for exocytosis. The role of PITP in polyphosphoinositide synthesis may also explain its involvement in intracellular vesicular traffic. Structure and evolution Along with the structurally unrelated Sec14p family (found in ), this family can bind/exchange one molecule of phosphatidylinositol (PI) or phosphatidylcholine (PC) and thus aids their transfer between different membrane compartments. There are three sub-families - all share an N-terminal PITP-like domain, whose sequence is highly conserved. It is described as consisting of three regions. The N-terminal region is thought to bind the lipid and contains two helices and an eight-stranded, mostly antiparallel beta-sheet. An intervening loop region, which is thought to play a role in protein-protein interactions, separates this from the C-terminal region, which exhibits the greatest sequence variation and may be involved in membrane binding. This motif marks PITP as part of the larger SRPBCC (START/RHOalphaC/PITP/Bet v1/CoxG/CalC) domain superfamily. PITP alpha (UniProt ) has a 16-fold greater affinity for PI than PC.

In 1990, he made a donation via The Monument Trust of ¬£5 million to his alma mater, Cambridge University, which used the money to convert the old Addenbrooke's Hospital building on Trumpington Street in Cambridge into what was to become Cambridge Judge Business School.A tribute to Simon Sainsbury, businessman and philanthropist; accessed 4 November 2007 Following riots in 1991, the Trust was also involved in renovations of the Meadow Well housing estate in North Tyneside. More recently, it funded an extension of the Pallant House Gallery in Chichester to house the large art collection of Sir Colin St John Wilson. Simon Sainsbury also personally supported research into HIV and AIDS. He and his brothers funded an extension to the National Gallery, London at a cost of around ¬£50 million, which opened in 1991 as the Sainsbury Wing. The Trust also supported the British Museum, the Royal Academy, the Campaign to Protect Rural England, the Landmark Trust, the Tate Gallery, the Victoria and Albert Museum, the Fitzwilliam Museum in Cambridge, and the renovation of Christ Church Spitalfields. He was a trustee of the Wallace Collection from 1977 to 1997, and a trustee of the National Gallery from 1991 to 1998. He also supported the National Theatre and the Royal Opera House. He refused all public honours, and declined an entry in Who's Who. Personal life Near the end of his life, Sainsbury entered into a civil partnership with his partner of 40 years, Stewart Grimshaw, a restaurateur and bookseller. He suffered from Parkinson's disease in his later years, and ultimately suffered a fall which caused his death. Upon his death in 2006, Sainsbury bequeathed the cream of his art collection to the National Gallery and the Tate. The combined value of the paintings in the bequest has been estimated at ¬£100 million. In 2008, the National Gallery received five works, by Claude Monet, Edgar Degas, Paul Gauguin, and Henri Rousseau, and the Tate thirteen, including works by Balthus and Lucian Freud. Sir Nicholas Serota, the director of the latter institution, called the bequest \\"one of the most important gifts in the history of Tate\\". The most recent comparable donations of artworks to the galleries are thought to be a gift to the Tate in the 1930s by Frank Stoop, and a bequest of 39 paintings to the National Gallery by Sir Hugh Lane in 1915.

He graduated from the University of London in 1991 with a degree in Theology, Smith attended the Oxford Centre for Hebrew Studies in 1992, and received his Doctorate from the University of Birmingham in 2000, having focussed his postgraduate study on the \\"Trajectory of Memory\\", examining how Holocaust survivor testimony developed over time. He is author of an autobiography about his life entitled Never Again Yet Again, A Personal Struggle with the Holocaust and Genocide.Never Again Yet Again, A Personal Struggle with the Holocaust and Genocide, Gefen, Israel, 2009 Holocaust education Smith has consulted on the development of a number of Holocaust memorial and education centres overseas, including Lithuania's House of Memory and the Cape Town Holocaust Centre in South Africa, which was heavily inspired by a visit from the founder, Myra Osrin, to the UK Holocaust Centre. In 2004, Smith was project Director of the Kigali Memorial Centre, the genocide memorial museum and education centre in Kigali, Rwanda. Aegis was commissioned by Kigali City Council to establish the Kigali Memorial Centre, which opened in 2004 and still operates today. Smith is a member of the United States delegation to the Inter-governmental Taskforce on Holocaust Education, Remembrance and Research (ITF), founded by Sweden, the US and the UK on the personal initiative of the then Swedish Prime Minister, G√∂ran Persson. He was a member of the British delegation from 1998, when the ITF was founded, moving to the American delegation in 2009 following appointment to the USC Shoah Foundation Institute (see below). Over 20 countries are now part of the ITF. Smith was an advisor to G√∂ran Persson's series of intergovernmental conferences, the Stockholm International Forum. The four conferences addressed, The Holocaust (2000); Combatting Intolerance (2001), Truth, Justice, and Reconciliation (2002), Preventing Genocide (2004). One early outcome of the work of the ITF was the development of the UK's national Holocaust Memorial Day, inaugurated in 2001. Smith played a central role in this and served as an advisor to the Home Office on the Day's development over the years, and was appointed the inaugural Chair of the Holocaust Memorial Day Trust in November 2004 when the decision was made that the running of the Day should be handed over to a non- Governmental charitable body. Smith has developed a reputation for his contribution to the field in the UK and abroad. Recognition for his work includes being made an Officer of the Order of the British Empire (2000), the Interfaith Gold Medallion (2000), and Honorary Doctorate in Law from the University of Leicester (2007) and an Honorary Doctor of Letters from Nottingham Trent University (2010). Smith's publications include Making Memory: Creating Britain's First Holocaust Centre, Forgotten Places: The Holocaust and the Remnants of Destruction, and The Holocaust and the Christian World, which he co-edited with Carol Rittner and Irena Steinfeldt.

The gene is part of a cluster of MMP genes which localize to chromosome 11q22.3. MMP-1 was the first vertebrate collagenase both purified to homogeneity as a protein, and cloned as a cDNA. Structural Features MMP-1 has an archetypal structure consisting of a pre-domain, a pro-domain, a catalytic domain, a linker region and a hemopexin-like domain. The primary structure of MMP-1 was first published by Goldberg, G I, et al. Two main nomenclatures for the primary structure are currently in use, the original one from which the first amino-acid starts with the signalling peptide and a second one where the first amino-acid starts counting from the prodomain (proenzyme nomenclature). =Catalytic Domain= The Catalytic Domains of MMPs share very similar characteristics, having a general shape of oblate ellipsoid with a diameter of ~40 √Ö. Despite the similarity of the Catalytic domains of MMPs, this entry will focus only on the structural features of MMP-1 Catalytic Domain. Overall Structural Characteristics The Catalytic Domain of MMP-1 is composed of five highly twisted Œ≤-strands (sI-sV), three Œ±-helix (hA- hC) and a total of eight loops, enclosing a total of five metal ions, three Ca2+ and two Zn2+, one of which with catalytic role. The Catalytic Domain (CAT) of MMP-1 starts with the F100 (non-truncated CAT) as the first amino- acid of the N-terminal loop of the CAT domain. The first published x-ray structure of the CAT domain was representative of the truncated form of this domain, where the first 7 amino-acids are not present. After the initial loop, the sequences follows to the first and longest Œ≤-sheet (sI). A second loop precedes large \\"amphipathic Œ±-helix\\" (hA) that longitudinally spans protein site. The Œ≤-strands sII and sIII follows separated by the respective loops, loop 4 being commonly designated as \\"short loop\\" bridging sII to sIII. Following the sIII strand the sequence meets the 'S-shaped double loop' that is of primary importance for the peptide structure and catalytic activity (see further) as it extends to the cleft side \\"bulge\\", continuing to the only antiparallel Œ≤-strand sIV, which is prime importance for binding peptidic substrates or inhibitors by forming main chain hydrogen bond. Following sIV, loop Gln186-Gly192 and Œ≤-strand sV are responsible for contributing with many ligands to the several metal ions present in the protein (read further). A large open loop follows sV which has proven importance in substrate specificity within the MMPs family. A specific region (183)RWTNNFREY(191) has been identified as a critical segment of matrix metalloproteinase 1 for the expression of collagenolytic activity. On C-terminal part of the CAT Domain the hB Œ±-helix, known as the \\"active-site helix\\" encompasses part of the \\"zinc-binding consensus sequence\\" HEXXHXXGXXH that is characteristic of the Metzincin superfamily. The Œ±-helix hB finishes abruptly at Gly225 where the last loop of the domain starts. This last loop contains the \\"specificity loop\\" which is the shortest in the MMPs family. The Catalytic Domain ends at Gly261 with Œ±-helix hC.  Function  MMPs are involved in the breakdown of extracellular matrix in normal physiological processes, such as embryonic development, reproduction, and tissue remodeling, as well as in disease processes, such as arthritis and metastasis. Specifically, MMP-1 breaks down the interstitial collagens, types I, II, and III. { Induction of matrix metalloproteinase 1 in rat corneas by ciprofloxacin, ofloxacin and levofloxacin (b,c,d) compared to artificial tears (a).

He wrote a book about the \\"Wiriyamu Massacre\\" during the Mozambican War of Independence and became an influential scholar of Christian history in Africa. Early life Hastings, a grandson of George Woodyatt Hastings, was born in Kuala Lumpur, Malaya, but his mother moved to England to bring up the children when he was little more than a baby. He was educated at Douai School (1943‚Äì46) and Worcester College, Oxford (1946‚Äì49). In his final year at Oxford, Hastings discerned a missionary vocation. He joined the White Fathers but later left the order to become a secular priest in the Diocese of Masaka, Uganda. Hastings studied theology at the Collegium Urbanum, the college of the Congregation of Propaganda in Rome. He was ordained in 1955 and awarded a doctorate in 1958. His lifelong association with The Tablet dates from this period. In 1958 he also obtained a teaching degree from Christ's College, Cambridge and in 1959 he took up his priestly functions in Uganda. Ministry In Uganda, Hastings served in pastoral and teaching functions and was charged with interpreting the documents of the Second Vatican Council to priests in Africa. His notes on these documents were later published. He also agitated for a relaxation of the discipline of clerical celibacy in the African context, attributing the low numbers of African clergy to the cultural alienness of this requirement. In 1966, after bouts of malaria, Hastings returned to England and became active in ecumenical dialogue through the preparatory commission of the Anglican-Roman Catholic International Commission. He was also commissioned by a number of Anglican dioceses in Africa to prepare a report on Christian and customary marriage. From 1972 to 1976 Hastings was on the staff of an ecumenical missionary school, the College of the Ascension in Selly Oak, Birmingham. In 1973 Hastings brought the massacres carried out by the Portuguese army during the Mozambican War of Independence to world attention, first in The Times and later at the United Nations. He created a controversy in 1973 with an article in The Times about the \\"Wiriyamu Massacre\\", in the Portuguese-ruled overseas territory of Mozambique, revealing that the Portuguese army had massacred some 400 villagers at the village of Wiriyamu, near Tete, in December 1972. His report was printed a week before the Portuguese prime minister, Marcelo Caetano, was due to visit Britain to celebrate the 600th anniversary of the Anglo- Portuguese alliance. The Portuguese army at the time denied the massacre in an official investigation but the Portuguese government commissioned another investigation, by Jorge Jardim, who located the former village, photographed the remains and delivered a full report to the Portuguese government proving the existence of the massacre and advising that it be acknowledged and explained. Marcelo Caetano and his ministers discussed the report on 18 August 1973 and instead decided to appoint another military investigation which once again alleged that Wiriyamu did not exist. Portugal's growing isolation following Hastings' claims has often been cited as a factor that helped to bring about the Carnation Revolution coup which deposed Marcelo Caetano, the leader of the Estado Novo regime that ruled the Portuguese Empire, in 1974. Academic career In 1976 Hastings was appointed to a lectureship in the theology faculty of the University of Aberdeen. He was an authority on nations and nationalism. In his 1997 book, The Construction of Nationhood, he traced the origins of European nations back to the Middle Ages, arguing for the centrality of Christianity to European national identities. According to Hastings, the biblical idea of the ancient Israelite polity, with its fusion of land, people and religious polity... was almost monolithically national\\" and spread through Europe. The Construction of Nationhood, La construcci√≥n de las nacionalidades: Etnicidad, religi√≥n y nacionalismo was published in Spanish in 2002. From 1982‚Äì85, he was Professor of Religious Studies at the University of Zimbabwe. From 1985 to his retirement in 1996 he was Professor of Theology at the University of Leeds and he was involved in the Leeds University Centre for African Studies. From 1985 to 2000 he edited the Journal of Religion in Africa. Later in life Hastings was active in raising awareness of the atrocities accompanying the break-up of Yugoslavia and the reassertion of Serbian control over Kosovo. He was a founding member of the Alliance to Defend Bosnia-Herzegovina. Marriage In 1978 Hastings came to the decision that as a Catholic priest he was free to marry. In 1979 he married Ann Spence without seeking ecclesiastical permission or resigning from the priesthood. Although this was a clear breach of canon law he was never formally excommunicated, largely because since leaving Uganda he had not been subject to the oversight of any particular bishop. On occasion he continued to exercise his priestly ministry after his marriage. Death Hastings died in Leeds on 30 May 2001, aged 71, and was interred in St Mary's Roman Catholic Church, East Hendred, Oxfordshire. The Adrian Hastings Africa Scholarship Fund was founded in 2001 at the University of Leeds in his honour. Works Hastings wrote more than forty books, including: * Church and Mission in Modern Africa. London: Burns & Oates, 1967. * A Concise Guide to the Documents of the Second Vatican Council. 2 vols. London: Darton, Longman & Todd, 1968‚Äì69. * Wiriyamu.

It is one the two laboratories of DRDO that works on electronic warfare systems, along with Defence Electronics Research Laboratory. ASIEO developed the first mission computer for Light Combat Aircraft in 1991. The computer was responsible for managing the interaction between avionics, displays, sensors and weapon systems. It also developed a self-protection suite for the aircraft that included radar warning receiver, laser warning receiver, jammer, missile approach warning system, and countermeasure dispensers under a program named Mayawi in collaboration with Elisra. Sukhoi Su-30MKI uses Tarang Mk 2 radar warning receiver developed by DARE and manufactured by Bharat Electronics Limited. Its mission computer, radar processor and indication management computer were also developed by DARE and manufactured by Hindustan Aeronautics Limited's Hyderabad division. In 2006, DARE partnered with EADS's defence electronics division to develop a missile approach warning system for the Indian Air Force based on the latter's AN/AAR-60 system. The jointly developed system was put into trials in 2008 and was planned to be co-produced with Alpha Technologies. DARE has also partnered with Elisra to jointly develop electronic warfare systems for Indian and Israeli aircraft. DARE has utilized this partnership to develop an electronic warfare suite for Mikoyan MiG-29 named D-29. DARE has worked with Hindustan Aeronautics Limited to develop avionics for upgrade programs for several Indian Air Force aircraft. It participated in the development of a mission computer for SEPECAT Jaguar and in the development of navigation and electronic warfare systems for Mikoyan MiG-27M. DARE, in collaboration with Centre for Airborne Systems and Defence Electronics Research Laboratory, developed antennas for electronic warfare support measures and communication systems of DRDO AEW&CS.; DARE also developed a unified electronic warfare suite with an integrated radar jammer and a radar warning receiver for HAL Tejas.

Distribution This is a tropical western Atlantic genus. Habitat Representatives from this genus have been recorded at depths from one to 60 metres. Shell description The shells of species in this genus are moderately large to very large, range size from 14 mm (Bullata largillieri, smallest species of Bullata) to 97.9 mm (largest specimen known of Bullata bullata). (pl I) The shell color is a yellowish-orange to orange- or pinkish-brown, spirally banded (pl II) or with white spots (pl III). The lip is pink, yellow, or orange, darker than shell color (pl IV). The shell surface is smooth and glossy. The shape is elliptical to oblong or obovate, moderately to strongly shouldered (pl V bottom). The spire is immersed or near so (pl V top). The aperture is narrow to moderately broad, wider anteriorly. The lip is moderately strongly thickened, weakly to strongly denticulate in adults, with a distinct external varix. A siphonal notch is present but a posterior notch is absent. The parietal callusing is weakly to strongly developed, especially posteriorly, and is absent in type species. The columella has four continuous plications occupying less than half the aperture length. The internal whorls are unmodified. (pl VI/VII) Remarks The large, patterned shells with an immersed spire and 4 moderately heavy columellar plications which are not crowded anteriorly, serve to distinguish this group of species. This genus is restricted to the Caribbean province, where it evolved in the Miocene as a direct offshoot of Prunum. Coan (1965:189) placed Cryptospyra as a subgenus of Bullata. Coovert & Coovert (1995:93) consider as distinct genus, as they have separate origins: Bullata is a direct descendant of Caribbean Prunum, whereas Cryptospira is restricted to the western Indo-Pacific where it evolved.

It is sometimes lumped with the purple-banded sunbird. Range and habitat It is found in the Tsavo region of southeastern Kenya and nearby northern Tanzania, but not on the coast. It lives in arid scrub with Commiphora and Acacia trees and shrubs. Description The Tsavo sunbird is 9.5 to 10 cm (3.75 to 4 inches) long. The bill is down-curved and rather short for a sunbird, especially compared to that of the otherwise similar Marico sunbird. The female is greyish-brown above and on the head with a white eyebrow stripe; the throat is either white or dusky with white edges (malar strips). The underparts are faintly yellow-tinged white with dusky stripes on the breast. The tail is bluish-black with grey edges and tip. The juvenile male looks like the dark-throated form of the female. Later it develops a black throat and black wing coverts, both with green feathers intermixed, and often a wide black stripe down the belly. The adult male is apparently the same at all seasons: gleaming bluish-green above and on the head, with a black belly and lower breast. The upper breast may have a maroon band, missing the center or complete and 3 to 5 mm wide. (The male purple-banded sunbird has a wider maroon band and a distinct non-breeding plumage.) The song is \\"a rapid sputtering tsustiseesee, chuchiti-tsi-tsi-tsi-tsi sitisee-see-see-see chitisee‚Ä¶\\" and variants, sometimes only the last few notes.

Function  Cytosolic and membrane-bound forms of glutathione S-transferase are encoded by two distinct supergene families. At present, eight distinct classes of the soluble cytoplasmic mammalian glutathione S-transferases have been identified: alpha, kappa, mu, omega, pi, sigma, theta and zeta. This gene encodes a cytoplasmic glutathione S-transferase that belongs to the mu class. The mu class of enzymes functions in the detoxification of electrophilic compounds, including carcinogens, therapeutic drugs, environmental toxins, and products of oxidative stress, by conjugation with glutathione. The genes encoding the mu class of enzymes are organized in a gene cluster on chromosome 1p13.3, and are known to be highly polymorphic. These genetic variations can change an individual's susceptibility to carcinogens and toxins, as well as affect the toxicity and efficacy of certain drugs.

The survey indicated that the slopes of Brandon were settled in excess of four thousand years ago and that the cairns, house sites, field systems and a large ritual enclosure identified on its slopes are part of the prehistoric remains there. Two Norman moated sites, with long rectangular buildings attached - probably granges or farms attached to Duiske Abbey and thought to be about 600 years old - were also identified on the lower slopes in the Ballyogan townland area during the survey.

Function  Glutathione S-transferases (GSTs) are a family of enzymes that play an important role in detoxification by catalyzing the conjugation of many hydrophobic and electrophilic compounds with reduced glutathione. Based on their biochemical, immunologic, and structural properties, the soluble GSTs are categorized into four main classes: alpha, mu, pi, and theta. The glutathione S-transferase pi gene (GSTP1) is a polymorphic gene encoding active, functionally different GSTP1 variant proteins that are thought to function in xenobiotic metabolism and play a role in susceptibility to cancer, and other diseases.  Interactions  GSTP1 has been shown to interact with Fanconi anemia, complementation group C and MAPK8.

The choir is an institution of the Lutheran Church in Bavaria, which raises about 30 percent of the funds required to support both the ensemble and the singers boarding school. The choir received the Rheingau Musikpreis of the Rheingau Musik Festival in 2007. Repertoire and performances The choirs repertoire spans all kinds of disciplines from a cappella to great oratoric masterpieces, such as the Messiah by Handel or Elijah by Mendelssohn Bartholdy. With about 70 singers, the choir conducts about 50 concerts per year. This includes going on tour once or twice per year to locations such as other European countries, the Middle East, Far East, the United States and South America. The choir also accompanied the Presidents of Germany Richard von Weizs√§cker and Roman Herzog on their state visits and held a concert for Johannes Rau. Education At school, the young singers are specially supported in so called \\"choir classes\\" of the external grammar school \\"Johann-Sebastian-Bach-Gymnasium\\". This allows for more flexibility in responding to the special needs of the singers. The musical education at the boarding school also includes voice training, music theory and of course the daily rehearsals. In order to ensure proper delivery of homework and absorption of curriculum content, the younger grades are obliged to attend a daily \\"study time\\" at the boarding school. Depending on the proficiency level of an individual student, special enhancement classes are offered by teachers of the grammar school.

The foundation stone for construction of a new railway line from Sevoke railway station (station code SVQ) to proposed Rangpo railway station on the border of Sikkim and West Bengal was laid in October 2009 by the vice president of India. In 2008, the line was proposed to be 53 km long with broad gauge track but the final alignment is 45 km long with 3.5 km in Sikkim state and the rest in West Bengal state. The track will have 28 bridges and 14 tunnels and 38.5 km of the track will be in tunnels. The track is due to be constructed through the foothills of the Kanchanjungha mountain range and the Teesta river valley. New railway stations will be constructed at Melli, Teesta Bazaar, Geil Khola, Riang, and Rangpo. The Indian Railways signed a contract with the construction company, IRCON, only in May 2010 but the final alignment had not been fixed for the first 22 km through elephant sanctuary forest even in 2013 and the final clearance of environment ministry had not been received. To obtain approval of the environment and forest ministry, the railways made a proposal in February 2013 to install elephant sensors along the stretch of the proposed railway line in Mahananda elephant sanctuary or run the trains at a speed of only 20 km per hour in the forest area and stop when an elephant is sighted close to the track.

Function  The protein encoded by this gene is a member of the protein tyrosine phosphatase (PTP) family. PTPs are known to be signaling molecules that regulate a variety of cellular processes including cell growth, differentiation, mitotic cycle, and oncogenic transformation. N-terminal part of this PTP contains two tandem Src homolog (SH2) domains, which act as protein phospho-tyrosine binding domains, and mediate the interaction of this PTP with its substrates. This PTP is expressed primarily in hematopoietic cells, and functions as an important regulator of multiple signaling pathways in hematopoietic cells. This PTP has been shown to interact with, and dephosphorylate a wide spectrum of phospho-proteins involved in hematopoietic cell signaling, (e.g., the LYN-CD22-SHP-1 pathway). Multiple alternatively spliced variants of this gene, which encode distinct isoforms, have been reported.  Expression  SHP-1 gene has two promoters: P-1, active in epithelial cells, and P-2, active in hemopoietic cells.

Tuscaloosa, Alabama: The University of Alabama Press, 1990. . Exterior features of the Gothic Revival structure include lancet windows, pointed arch doorways and vertical board and batten sheathing. The building originally had a square bell tower on the corner to the left of the current main front entrance, but this was not rebuilt when the church was relocated in 1878 to Martin's Station. The church was disassembled and relocated to Cahaba in 2007, where it was reassembled at Old Cahawba Archaeological Park. History St. Luke's was built in 1854, during Cahaba's antebellum boom years, on Vine Street near the intersection of Vine and 1st South Street. Following the post- war decline of Cahaba, the church was dismantled in 1878 and moved to the village of Martin's Station, where it was reassembled and continued to serve an Episcopal congregation for several decades. It was later used by an African-American Baptist congregation for over 60 years before being acquired by the Alabama Historical Commission. It was added to the National Register of Historic Places on March 25, 1982.

Biography  Shanley was born in Bellaire, Ohio and grew up in nearby Shadyside, attending Shadyside High School. He then went to radio broadcasting school in Washington, D.C., and from there got his first job in the business at a Pontiac, Michigan station, primarily covering high school sports. Shanley first came to Cleveland in 1961 after four years doing play-by-play for University of Toledo sports. Once in Cleveland, he worked for WGAR AM-1220 Radio in the same capacity for both the Cleveland Browns and the Ohio State Buckeyes. Over the next 24 years, Shanley continued his work with the Browns, teaming with local sportcaster Jim Graner through 1974, a popular pairing that was ended due to Graner's failing health due to brain cancer. Taking Graner's place was another local sports anchor, Jim Mueller, who served with Shanley for the remaining decade of his career with the Browns. Shanley's tenure in Cleveland television began on WKYC as a weekend sportscaster, but flourished once he took over as sports director on WEWS in January 1967. Shanley's duties at the station would also later include hosting a weekly Browns highlights show, \\"Quarterback Club\\" until 1976. Never afraid to speak his mind on the air, Shanley gave a blistering commentary on the night of June 4, 1974, after the Cleveland Indians' promotion of Ten Cent Beer Night disintegrated into a riot, and led to a forfeit in favor of the visiting Texas Rangers. Noting the raucous nature of the fans that evening, Shanley began by apologizing to the regular fans not involved, and then said to those who caused the trouble, \\"Next time, why don't you stay home and make an ass out of yourself.\\" Shanley's most controversial moment on the air came in November 1979, when he gained widespread attention by making an on-air statement against the public displaying of the Iranian Flag and the burning of the American Flag by pro- Ayatullah Khomeini supporters in New York City by burning an Iranian flag himself on a WEWS-TV 11 p.m. telecast during the Iranian Hostage Crisis.Gib Shanley. ClevelandSeniors.com. Shanley continued full-time in his job capacity at WEWS until February 1985, when he resigned to move to California. Unable to find steady work (outside of serving as a play-by-play substitute during Los Angeles Rams games in 1985), Shanley eventually returned to Cleveland, becoming sports director for independent station WUAB-TV channel 43's then fledgling 10 p.m. newscast in 1988. Shanley was the lead sports anchor, and he continued there until 1996. In 1996, Shanley became guest commentator on the weekly sports wrap-up/NFL coverage and commentary show \\"Countdown to 99\\" that was hosted by Casey Coleman and former Cleveland Browns wide receiver Reggie Rucker.

It was founded in November 2001 by former senior U.S. official Edward W. Scott, director of the Peterson Institute for International Economics C. Fred Bergsten, and Nancy Birdsall. Birdsall, the former Vice President of the Inter-American Development Bank and former Director of the Policy Research Department at the World Bank, became the Center's first President. Lawrence Summers was unanimously elected in March 2014 by the CGD Board of Directors to succeed founding Board Chair Edward Scott, Jr., on May 1, 2014. CGD was ranked the 13th most prominent think tank in the international development sphere by University of Pennsylvania's \\"2015 Global Go To Think Tank Index Report\\". In 2009, Foreign Policy Magazine's Think-Tank Index listed CGD as one of the top 15 overall think-tanks in the USA. CGD's stated mission is \\"to reduce global poverty and inequality by encouraging policy change in the United States and other rich countries through rigorous research and active engagement with the policy community. The Center considers itself to be a \\"think and do\\" tank, with an emphasis on producing research that is channeled into practical policy proposals. CGD is well known for leading debt-relief programs, specifically in Nigeria and Liberia. CGD Vice President Todd Moss first proposed the Nigerian debt buy-back, which resulted in the Paris Club of rich nations forgiving 60% of $31 billion of debt.‚ÄúClean Slate‚Äù, The Economist, October 2005 Former CGD senior fellow Steve Radelet advised Liberian President Ellen Johnson Sirleaf and her senior advisors on debt relief and aid coordination. CGD is also known for creating the program called advance market commitments to encourage vaccine development for specific diseases. The G7 endorsed the approach and the Gates Foundation and five countries gave $1.5 billion to create a vaccine against strains of pneumonia. In cooperation with Foreign Policy, CGD has published the Commitment to Development Index since 2003. The annual index ranks countries based on how their foreign aid, trade, migration, investment, environment, security and technology policies encourage global development. The Center for Global Development in Europe was established in October 2011 with the aim of engaging with and learning from policymakers, academics, and researchers in Europe, and bringing the CGD blend of evidence-led, high- quality research and engagement to European policymaking and engagement about development. \\"CGD in Europe\\" research initiatives include \\"Europe Beyond Aid\\", Development Impact Bonds, and Illicit Financial Flows. In November 2013, CGD purchased a new headquarters that includes a 170-seat state-of-the-art conference center, a 60-seat boardroom/ideas lab, and a multimedia studio. Research CGD conducts research within a range of topics that impact global poverty and people of the developing world. Topics include aid effectiveness, education, globalization and global health, as well as the impact of trade and migration on development. The Center is well known for its research on aid effectiveness. CGD President Nancy Birdsall recently developed Cash on Delivery (COD) Aid, an initiative aimed to improve aid effectiveness by focusing foreign aid on outcomes, not inputs. In 2008, CGD produced a compilation of essays edited by Nancy Birdsall called \\"The White House and the World: A Global Development Agenda for the Next U.S. President\\". These essays give policy recommendations to solve international problems, such as global health, foreign aid policy, migration, global warming and foreign direct investment. CGD recently published a report on the dangers of drug resistance in ‚ÄúThe Race against Drug Resistance: When Medicines Fail‚Äù, which the Global Health team launched on June 14, 2010. The Center's Migration and Development Initiative aims to study the effects labor movement has not only on the receiving country, but also on the country of origin and the migrants themselves. CGD economists Michael Clemens and Lant Pritchett have repeatedly called for a development agenda that incorporates migration from low and middle-income to high-income countries, where wages for the same task can be up to ten times higher. However, they argue that the misperception that development is about places rather than people often leads policymakers as well as economists to ignore the large benefits to the migrants themselves. Rich countries' immigration policies are also a factor in the Commitment to Development Index. CGD has advocated for temporary visas for Haitians to seasonally work in US agriculture and participated in an initiative to that end. In 2016, they issued a report on how policymakers can manage migration between the United States and Mexico to the benefit of both countries. In addition to print publications, CGD maintains several blogs, including Views From the Center and the Global Health Policy blog. Other research topics listed on their website include capital flows/financial crises, debt relief, environmental issues, economic growth, governance/democracy, international financial institutions, finance, food and agriculture, inequality, population, poverty, private investment, security and development, and data sets and resources.

Initiatives The Center considers itself a ‚Äúthink and do‚Äù tank, and thus has multiple initiatives to implement their policy suggestions. These, initiatives attempt to give specific policy recommendations to organizations while creating a dialogue. 2009 Commitment to Development Index. In 2003, David Roodman created the Commitment to Development Index with Foreign Policy magazine and Mapping Worlds. The Commitment to Development Index (CDI) ranks and analyzes nations‚Äô financial and political commitments to development every year. The index uses interactive graphs and analyzes how countries contribute to development in seven policy areas: aid (both quantity as a share of income and quality), trade, investment, migration, environment, security, and technology. Other initiatives include Cash on Delivery Aid, Combating Drug Resistance, Development Impact Bonds, Europe Beyond Aid, the Latin America Initiative, Migration as a Tool for Disaster Recovery, Oil-to-Cash: Fighting the Resource Curse through Cash Transfers, Pakistan: US Development Strategy, Preemptive Contract Sanctions, Reforming Trade Preferences, Rethinking US Development Policy, The Future of the World Bank, Tropical Forests for Climate and Development, Understanding India, and Value for Money: An Agenda for Global Health Funding Agencies. = Carbon Monitoring for Action (CARMA) = Carbon Monitoring For Action (CARMA) is a website produced and financed by the Center that contains a searchable database that estimates the carbon emissions of power plants and power companies around the world.

She painted religious images, altarpieces, and still lifes.  Biography  The daughter of painter Guglielmo Caccia and Laura Olivia, she was baptized Theodora Orsola on December 4, 1596. In 1620, she entered the Ursuline convent of Bianz√®, where she changed her name to Orsola Maddalena after she took her vows. Four of her sisters had already taken their vows there. Two years later, her other sister joined this convent, reuniting the six sisters together.Fonturnati, Vera, Jordana Pomeroy, and Claudio Strinati. ‚ÄúOrsoloa Maddalena Caccia‚Äù, Italian Women Artists: from Renaissance to Baroque. Washington, D.C.: National Museum of Women in the Arts, 2007. pg. 214 At the time, Bianz√© was a fortified outpost on the frontier between the lands of the Gonzaga, the dukes of Mantua and Monferrato, and the duchy of Savoy and was often in the path of these warring armies. To find a safer home for his daughters, Guglielmo requested and received permission to found the Ursuline convent at Moncalvo from the Bishop of Casale Monferrato, Monsignor Scipione Agnelli. He used his own money and made the houses he owned available to pay for this project. In 1625, Orsola and her sisters moved to the newly founded convent. Her father died a few months after the convent was established and left drawings, set squares, and other art tools for his daughters.Fonturnati, Vera, Jordana Pomeroy, and Claudio Strinati. ‚ÄúOrsoloa Maddalena Caccia‚Äù, Italian Women Artists: from Renaissance to Baroque. Washington, D.C.: National Museum of Women in the Arts, 2007. pg. 215 Before his death, he had fostered painting as a vocation for the Ursulines of Moncalvo. Out of his six daughters and two sons, Orsola and her sister Francesca, who died at a young age, were his only two children to become painters. She was known as the leader of women in art when it comes to religious painting. Without her, nuns would not have been able to explore their artistic yet religious side. Later in her life, Orsola became the abbess of the convent. She outlived all of her sisters and devoted herself to painting until her death in 1676.  Career  Sister Orsola began her career working as her father's assistant. She learned to paint by mixing the colored pigments for paint and depicting the secondary figures in her father's paintings. She was a prolific artist and the majority of her works are scattered across the many small localities in Monferrat. It is claimed that she painted the first recorded flower painting in Italy. She went on to organize a painting studio within the convent at Moncalvo, where took on students and assistants of her own. Painting as a trade was encouraged at the convent as it provided a means of support. Several of Sister Orsola pieces were painted on commission. Not only did she commission her works, which she did privately and publicly but she paved the way for nuns to become artists. In two letters addressed to Christine of France written in 1643, she asked to be given an opportunity for paid work as her convent was suffering from poverty. She helped bring still life painting to Northwestern Italy. The idea of extremely detailed religious art was also because of Orsola. She brought people to realize that scenes of the Bible were very important to the story. She also started to use symbolism in her paintings, such as roses meaning virgin and Ox meaning Jesus‚Äôs death. Works Sister Orsola created religious genre paintings, altarpieces, and still lifes which varied little over the course of the fifty years she painted. Most of her works convey the repertoire of figurative models and types of composition that she studied in her father's studio during her adolescence.Fonturnati, Vera, Jordana Pomeroy, and Claudio Strinati. ‚ÄúOrsoloa Maddalena Caccia‚Äù, Italian Women Artists: from Renaissance to Baroque. Washington, D.C.: National Museum of Women in the Arts, 2007. pg. 216 In comparison to her many altarpieces and religious paintings, Sister Orsola created few still life works. She commonly inserted pieces of still life in many of her religious works. These elements of still life are a reflection of the types of objects she had access to in the convent and could study from. Many of her still lifes are considered unusual and notable in their invention and stylistic quality. Each element of her still lifes is meticulously placed and balanced by other figures in the composition. She also depicted various species of flowers and other plants in her works. Orsola's paintings are recognizable as her creations since they are filled with spirituality and are lifelike in their precision. As the years go on, more of her works continue to be discovered and are correctly attributed to her after initial mislabeling. =Major works= Still Life of Birds... Sister Orsola's Birth of the Virgin was most likely created around 1635. The original provenance of this image is unknown, making it hard to establish exact year it was created. Originally, it was attributed to her father, then reassigned to the family workshop, and finally identified as one of Orsola's works. In 1838, it entered the Pinacoteca do Estado de S√£o Paulo at the request from Marchese Luigi Malaspina. It is often regarded as one of her best known works. It depicts the sacred tale of the Virgin Mary's birth with a wealth of details. Three women look after Mary's mother Anne who is lying on her bed after labor while three others prepare to wash the newborn child and heat pieces of cloth at a fire. Various still life elements are inserted into this scene which are notable for their precision and quality. For example, a table on the left side of the image has an elaborate, coiled amphora and a tray of fruit with a cut lemon. Also, a young woman who is advancing towards Anne's bed holds a jug of wine and a drinking glass on a round dish. The drapes of the background, the velvet canopy over Anne's bed, the fringe of the tablecloths and blankets, and the lace on the bed sheets are depicted with intense accuracy. This painting has been associated with two drawings by her father as the sources of her inspiration. Another famous work by Orsola is her Still Life with Flowers, Fruit, Mushroom, Goldfinch, and Hoopoe. Since Orsola created still lifes over a long period of time, it is difficult to assign an exact date for when this image was created. Since it is made with a palette of bright colors, the paint is laid on the panel more thickly, and resembles a work she created late in her career, it has generally been accepted that this work was made in between 1645 and 1650. This work was originally attributed to Sister Orsola by the Italian art historian Mina Gregori. The atypical horizontal format of the painting suggests that it was meant to be set above a door, inserted in a wooden paneling of a wall, or to adorn a cabinet in a sacristy. The objects seem to be laid out on a windowsill set in a wall of a room that opens out onto a view of the sky which is flecked with gray clouds. The image stands out for its depiction of unusual species of plants and animals and its rhythmic composition which is formed around the alternations of color. The uncommon animals and plants in the image are the hibiscus, the Turk's-cap lily, the hoopoe, and the mushroom. The lifelike representation of the plant forms have led to the belief that Orsola used scientific prints and treatises to learn how to depict plant life realistically. The birds symbolize facets of Christianity since the goldfinch is a reference to the Passion of the Christ while the hoopoe is a symbol for sin. She also faithfully reproduces a large mushroom of the woodland clavaria species with its white, fleshy stem and yellow-ochre clustered branches. This mushroom alludes to life regenerated after death through fermentation or organic decomposition. Therefore, the mushroom is the third element in a symbolic triangle placed in the center of the composition between the two birds, which together symbolize sin, sacrifice, and resurrection.Fonturnati, Vera, Jordana Pomeroy, and Claudio Strinati. ‚ÄúOrsoloa Maddalena Caccia‚Äù, Italian Women Artists: from Renaissance to Baroque. Washington, D.C.: National Museum of Women in the Arts, 2007. pg. 218 One of the other more well-known art pieces was \\"\\"St. Luke the Evangelist in the Studio\\"\\", which showed St. Luke in his studio, painting the Virgin Mary and baby Jesus. This was not just a comment about St. Luke but about her life and how this was actually what she saw on a daily basis. This was a great example of many of Orsola‚Äôs works. It is very busy and filled with details of real life. Something unique that Orsola touched on was that St. Luke was not just a painter but also a sculptor in her painting. The bookshelf behind him shows an ox and angels to show St. Luke was an evangelist and the flowers by Mary show her virtue. In May 2020, Still life of Birds... was auctioned by Sotheby's, with an estimate of US$12,000-18,000, selling for $260,000, beating the artist's previous auction record of ¬£28,145 for Vases of Flowers on a Table at Dorotheum, Vienna, in 2016.

Background Bamber was born in Preston, Lancashire in 1948. After completing his studies at the Harris College of Art (now part of University of Central Lancashire) in Preston,Jim Bamber bio page he moved to London to pursue a career as an artist, where he worked in numerous renowned publications and would soon gradually become freelance. There he worked for Car Magazine which led to a stint at the publisher of Autocourse. While London-based, he never forgot his heritage, and where he could, he sneaked-in a reference to ‚ÄúPreston North End‚Äù football team, in deference to his Father, a life-long fan. Yumping Yarns/The Pits During his time as an illustrator, looking at a picture of Stig Blomqvist in his driver's overall and helmet, Bamber began to practice cartoon drawing of drivers in overalls and a full-face helmet, of whom Blomqvist was the first caricature drawn by Bamber.OnPole.com:Jim Bamber's 'The Stig' Figure Rather than drawing faces of drivers, a common feature at the time, he shortcutted it by drawing a ball as a helmet and adding names above their visors to identify drivers. Bamber would continue to practice drawing drivers' caricatures, while working as an illustrator and as an Art Editor for Rallycourse yearbooks. In 1983, Bamber took his first commissioned job as a cartoonist for the monthly car magazine Car & Car Conversions, titled \\"Yumping Yarns\\", to which he contributed monthly specialising in World Championship Rallying. This was followed by a stint for Autosport for a cartoon now known as \\"Bamber's view\\", specialising mostly in topics related to Formula One. Although appearing regularly in the magazine, his cartoon became a weekly feature in 1994 which continues to this day. In addition, Bamber also created a short lived comic strip called \\"Bumpa the Bear\\" that appeared weekly in Auto Express from 1991 to 1992. By 1988, his drivers' caricatures had evolved from a lanky goggle- eyed character to a dumpier version. Bamber used this design for the rest of his career.Yumping Yarns, Tudor Journals, 1989, In 1998, Stirling Moss became the only driver to have been given his own distinctive helmeted design, differing from Bamber's standard full face helmet style, incorporating his overalls, helmet and goggle that he had worn during his professional career, with which he has become associated. His cartoon incorporates a Damon Hill fan being asked a question by an ITV F1 correspondent, \\"Who's the greatest driver\\"; he is threatened at gunpoint from behind by a Michael Schumacher caricature, who in turn is threatened at gunpoint from behind by Moss, who says, \\"Moss ‚Äì pass it on!\\".Jim Bamber, The Pits 6: 1998 Edition, Page 81, Bamber's cartoon of Schumacher and Moss CrankandPiston.com Bamber cartoons archives Bamber claimed the cartoon was not as funny with only Schumacher; as such, he drew in Moss, and found that it increased the humor of the cartoon.

It is regulated by the JKA Foundation. Autorace is predominantly a gambling sport. The first ever meeting was held at Funabashi in 1950, but the more traditional speedway and flat track dirt surfaces were banned by the government in the 1960s because they were considered too dangerous. Unlike other forms of motorcycle and gambling sport, prior to race day, riders are required to reside at the dormitory with over 500 riders and refrain from contacting anyone within the outside world including any forms of communications to prevent race fixing, which scandalised the sport during the years of the sport when the Yakuza took over the sport and as a result, crowds dwindled and it was saved when a motorcycle federation took it over in 1967. Since then the sport has very much gone its own way to develop into a form of motor sport exclusive to Japan, although in the 1990s, there was non-betting series featuring flat-track motorcycles on established short-track paved ovals (under 1,000m in general) in the United States, the Motorcycle Asphalt Racing Series. Auto Race competitions are held on tarmac tracks, and usually involve eight riders and runs for six laps. The hard surface dictates riders lean round the corners rather than slide as in conventional Speedway, the sport from which Autorace was derived. A typical Auto Race bike is 599„èÑ and has a two-speed gearbox. As in Speedway, the bikes have no brakes and are designed with the left handlebar higher than the right in order to help maintain stability while leaning the machine on the banked oval circuit. As well as their real names, all the riders have an alias, or nickname, which they go by. All are trained in official training schools and have to pass a qualifying examination before being allowed to become competitive riders. Once qualified, riders are graded according to their results and these grades are used to ascertain racing positions, with the higher graded riders starting from the back grids. Riders are identifiable by number and shirt colour. An average rider usually spends half a year living away from home. Between races, the bike is kept together with other bikes. Although they are better paid than most of their counterparts, unlike their road racing counterparts, the Auto Race riders do not have celebrity status or product endorsements, and few have raced in road racing unlike its North American counterpart (American Flat Track), which has been the home of numerous championship riders that advanced to MotoAmerica, MotoGP, and World Superbike. However, one of the well-known riders is the veteran Mitsuo Abe, better known as the father of late MotoGP and World Superbike star Norifumi. The sport also spawned a manga called Speed Star.

Led by the Seamen's Union after shipping companies refused to increase salaries by 40%, the strike quickly garnered over 30,000 participants, greatly disrupting everyday colonial life and food shipments to Hong Kong. Though the strike was declared illegal by the Hong Kong government, negotiations eventually took place after 52 days, with employers capitulating on 5 March 1922 and agreeing to wage increases of 15‚Äì30%. The Seamen's Strike had strictly economic roots‚Äîseamen's wages stayed the same while post-World War One inflation increased living costs, they were paying a lower salary than the law allowed, and they were underemployed and underpaid while ashore. Meanwhile, foreign seamen were paid 75‚Äì80% more than Cantonese workers for doing the same job. In November 1921, the Seamen's Union, which represented all Chinese seamen, had demanded wage increases to close the gap between the Chinese and the non- Chinese seamen who received much higher pay. The shipping companies refused to increase their salary, and the union reacted by going on strike starting in January 1922. By February 1922, over $5 million in cargo had been tied up in the Hong Kong harbor, causing shipping companies to start to bypass Hong Kong in their shipping routes. The Seamen's Union was at the same time organizing other workers and unions in the city, hoping to extend their scope to a general strike. By early March, the city was approaching anarchy, with trash piling up, businesses closed, public transportation stopped, and food rationed.

Java moss is common and inexpensive in most places, fast-growing, and provides excellent cover for the young. Neocaridina davidi female Painted Fire Redhttp://aquariumsandfishes.com/451/red-cherry-shrimp/ N. davidi shrimp respond to the color of their background and substrate. If they are kept in a tank with light-colored substrate, they will become paler, or even transparent. On a darker substrate, they take on their full coloration. Color intensity also depends on the types of food available (live foods and those high in protein and fats are more beneficial than flake foods), water pH, and temperature. Prepared foods specifically designed for shrimp are available at some suppliers.  Behavior  The N. davidi shrimp is a non-aggressive shrimp. They are active throughout the day, and can be seen grazing on biofilm, aquarium d√©cor or the sides of the tank, hunting detritus among the gravel, and sometimes even mating. Periodically, a shrimp will shed its exoskeleton, leaving an empty white ghost of itself caught in the plants or drifting around the tank. This should be left in the tank, as the shrimp will eat it to recover the valuable minerals it contains. There have been some reports by people of some shrimp attacking other vulnerable shrimp and/or fish, possible explanations have been insufficient protein in their diet or just general insufficiency of biofilm in the tank. Female pregnant N. davidi shrimp tend to hide in the dark. If they feel endangered by predators, they will abandon their eggs. They need an environment with wood or plants such as Java moss in which to hide themselves and their babies. When they are carrying the eggs under their bodies, they can be witnessed circulating water over the eggs with their pleopods (swimming legs) to ensure good health. Cherry shrimp Female with eggs  Diet  N. davidi shrimp are primarily biofilm eaters. They will eat any food intended for aquarium use with varying preferences, but some will prefer compressed algae discs (algae wafers) or sinking shrimp pellets. Blanched (boiled until soft) vegetables such as zucchini (courgette), baby carrots, peas, cucumber, kale and spinach can be used as a supplemental food but should be fed sparingly. Uneaten food can quickly decompose and are recommended to be removed after a few hours to prevent potentially deadly ammonia spikes. To keep a clean substrate, some shrimp keepers put a glass bowl or glass plate on the bottom as a container for the food. If feeding commercial fish/shrimp food, ensure that there is no copper added (some breeders avoid only pure/elemental copper ) as this is dangerous for shrimp. Many breeders think copper sulfates, found in most fish food, are tolerated in low amounts. Copper sulfates found in snail killer are in high amounts and will kill shrimp. Some commercial water conditioners remove or neutralize copper, lead, and other metals from tap water in order to make it safe for aquarium life. The best way to keep a healthy balance in a tank with shrimp is to let them eat the biofilm that grows in the tank- including on the glass, on plants, and all over driftwood; this way the tank works in balance along with the beneficial bacteria that grow in a filter. With at least a few hours of lighting to promote growth of biofilm, the shrimp will grow to maturity without any problems.  Sexing  Neocaridina davidi have noticeable sexual dimorphism. The male is smaller and usually less colorful than the female. The male's tail, not being needed to carry eggs, is narrower. The female is larger and usually displays a richer, more opaque coloration, however selective breeding can produce males with similar quality of coloration. On the upper section of the female's body, on the \\"shoulder\\", the developing eggs on the ovaries may be seen in more transparent individuals. The color of these eggs will depend on the breed of individual shrimp. The shape of the ovaries drapes across both sides of the shrimp, giving rise to the nickname \\"saddle\\". The presence of a \\"saddle\\" indicates a female that is likely ready to mate.  Breeding  N. davidi shrimp reach sexual maturity when they are around 4‚Äì6 months old. Breeding only requires a sexed pair of shrimp, stable water parameters, and a food source.http://www.theshrimpfarm.com/articles/cherry_shrimp_breeding.php Eggs may be observed developing in the female's ovaries as a green or yellow triangular \\"saddle\\" marking on her back. When she is ready to lay the eggs, which occurs after molting, she releases pheromones into the water to signal her availability to males. The male shrimp in the tank will often become agitated, swimming very actively about as they search for the source of the pheromones. After a brief mating process, during which the male deposits sperm onto the female's body, the female lays her eggs and affixes them to her swimmerettes. The eggs are not fertilized within the female; they are fertilized as they pass from the ovaries to the outside of the body. Therefore, it is certain that any shrimp carrying eggs has mated. A female carrying eggs under her abdomen is said to be \\"berried\\". Some report that young female shrimp carrying their first clutch of eggs tend to drop some or all of the eggs, possibly due to inexperience or small size.http://www.planetinverts.com/shrimp_reproduction.html If a berried shrimp is stressed by predators or poor water conditions she may also abandon the eggs. 2-days-old Neocaridina davidi (red morph) shrimp ( ~1mm in length) They have 20‚Äì30 eggs, which take 2‚Äì3 weeks to hatch. The eggs are green or yellow, depending on the color of the saddle. They turn darker and darker until the young shrimp hatch after about three weeks. As the eggs near the end stages of growth, tiny dark eye spots of the developing shrimp within can be observed. When the young hatch, they are tiny (~1 mm) copies of the adults. They have no planktonic larval stage. They spend their first few days of life hiding among plants or stones, where they are almost invisible, nibbling on the biofilm on the plants. They then emerge and graze on algae on tank surfaces and ornaments. Female shrimp, under ideal conditions, can breed again within a few days of hatching the previous clutch.  Tank mates  In their natural environment, N. davidi shrimp are primary prey. When kept in an aquarium, they are easily targeted by fish as potential food. Even fish too small to eat them may harass them and stress them to death, sometimes biting off limbs. For best results, breeding should take place in isolation. Small, non-aggressive fish such as the harlequin rasbora, neon tetra, cardinal tetra, dwarf corydoras, otocinclus catfish, dwarf gouramis though these may predate if aggressive, platy (or peaceful livebearer relatives like the endler‚Äôs livebearer or guppy), and some species of killifish can be kept with adult N. davidi shrimp. However, baby shrimp are very likely to be eaten by any fish other than the otocinclus. Most cichlids, including angel fish, will harass and readily eat adults as well. These dwarf shrimp will also be consumed by Australian rainbowfish and other large specimens of fish. With enough cover and hiding places (live plants such as Java moss work well), one can have a colony of N. davidi shrimp survive in a tank with larger fish preying on them. It is commonly suggested that one lets the shrimp reproduce a few generations/build up numbers before fish are added.  Availability  The N. davidi shrimp has become widely available in North America, Europe, Asia, and Australia. These shrimp can be purchased from online fish stores, at aquarium stores, and from private breeders‚Äîespecially through local aquarium societies. There are also many similar Neocaridina species of different color and markings that require the same conditions, these include fire reds, snowballs, blue pearls, rili shrimp, yellow shrimp, and wild types. Some species will hybridize, while variants within the same species will interbreed. Neocaridina shrimp can have similar colors due to different selective breeding processes. Cross-breeding different variations from different lineages (e.g. blues from the red line with blues from the blue line or brown line) is advised against as most young from such pairings revert to wild coloration. Cross-breeding differently colored shrimp from the same lineage (e.g. blue shrimp from the red line with red and clear shrimp from the red line) will not result in reversions to the wild coloration. Therefore, great care must be taken to establish the lineage of shrimp before crossing variants.  Varieties  N. davidi have are a wide range of colors as a result of selective breeding. Some colors are the mixtures of the chromatophores; xanthophores (yellow/orange), erythrophores (red/orange), iridophores (blue), leucophores (white), and melanophores (black/brown). * Red - Red is the most frequently sold morph. The red color of the shrimp is caused by the presence of erythrophores. * Yellow - The yellow color of the shrimp is caused by the presence of xanthophores. * Blue - Blue shrimp are caused by the presence of iridophores which reflect blue light. * Green - Green shrimp is caused by the mixture of iridophores (that reflect blue light) and xanthophores. * Violet - Violet shrimp is caused by the mixture of iridophores (that reflect blue light) and erythrophores. * Chocolate - Melanophores that are a dark brown shade are present in this shrimp. Though erythrophores or xanthophores can contribute to the brown or chocolate color of the shrimp. * Black - Black melanophores are present in this shrimp. * White - White shrimp are caused by the presence of leucophores. * \\"Ghost\\" - \\"Ghost\\" shrimp don't have any pigment at all so they appear transparent.

It was located in a remote area on the dirt portion of Newman Road off State Route 259 northeast of the community of Nixburg, about 6 miles (10 kilometers) southwest of Alexander City. Built in 1916, the 56-foot (17-meter) bridge was a modified Queen-post truss construction over a single span. Its WGCB number is 01-19-01. The Oakachoy Covered Bridge was listed on the Alabama Register of Landmarks and Heritage on October 28, 1977. The bridge was listed on the National Register of Historic Places on June 14, 1990. It was one of the shortest covered bridges built in Alabama. The Oakachoy Covered Bridge was burned down by vandals on June 2, 2001, ending the existence of the only remaining historic covered bridge in Coosa County. It had been maintained by the Coosa County Commission. The bridge was removed from the National Register on September 23, 2001. History The Oakachoy Covered Bridge was built by Melton Harris of homemade timber at a cost of $400 for connecting two county seats, Rockford in Coosa County and Dadeville in Tallapoosa County. It is unknown when the bridge was closed to motor traffic in later years or when it was restored. Nearby are ruts which were forded in Oakachoy Creek by pioneer wagons over 150 years ago. All that remains of the Oakachoy Covered Bridge site are the stone foundations and a wooden post on the east side of the creek which shows obvious charring. Even though the bridge is gone, it is said the site is still haunted by a slave who was lynched and eventually hung inside the bridge many years ago. A major downplay to this legend though is that slavery was abolished throughout the United States with the passing of the 13th Amendment to the Constitution in 1865 and the Oakachoy Covered Bridge was known to be the only covered bridge built at the site which wasn't until 1916...well after the end of the American Civil War. There were other bridges constructed in the vicinity before the Oakachoy Covered Bridge which were short lived. Photos of the Oakachoy Covered Bridge can be found on a covered bridge website created by Dale J. Travis (linked below). See also *List of Alabama covered bridges Notes References * Dale J.

One type of EFPS is The People Detector. The People Detector is a micro-electronic based device that can detect the presence of both moving and stationary objects through solid materials. Its ability to operate through any non-conductive material permits complete invisibility. The sensor functions by detecting small changes in an ultra-low-power electromagnetic field generated between two remotely located antenna electrodes. Its range is adjustable from a few centimetres [inches] to 4 m [over 12 feet]. Electric field proximity detectors can detect partially conducting or conducting objects and does not depend on impedance to ground.Van Schyndel, Andre J. Patent No. 6859141 2/22/2005 Advantages Because EF sensors provide comparatively low amounts of data, they have the potential to provide several advantages over optical systems. Electric field systems can be made smaller, lighter, and power efficient (valuable qualities in an age of ever shrinking electronics such as palm and watch based computers). Since EF sensors penetrate non-conducting materials, they can remain hidden allowing them to remain protected from weather. EFPS systems today are used in a wide variety of industrial and commercial applications, including automobile airbag systems (to determine where passengers are seated), in advanced robotic manipulators (to determine the properties of an object in the manipulator's grasp), and in home automation, to determine which rooms are occupied. Electric fish This is the same sensing system that is used by the electric catfish to navigate through muddy waters. These fish make use of spectral changes and amplitude modulation to determine factors such shape, size, distance, velocity, and conductivity. The abilities of the electric fish to communicate and identify sex, age, and hierarchy within the species are also made possible through electric fields. EF gradients as low as 5nV/cm can be found in some saltwater weakly electric fish.Zimmerman, T., Smith, J., Paradiso, J., Allport, D., & Gershenfeld, N. (1995). Applying Electric Field Sensing to Human-Computer Interfaces. IEEE SIG . MIT prototype Researchers at MIT have created a prototype of a 3-dimensional EFPS called the \\"Fish\\". It can monitor objects in a 3-dimensional space. The People Detector operates in only 2-dimensions and does not have a microprocessor. Technology review Technology Review, a science and technology magazine published by MIT, featured EFPS in their September 2007 computing section. Intel had created a robotic arm that could distinguish between plastic bottles that had water present or not. The robotic arm did not have to touch the bottles to determine which ones had water inside. Researchers applied an oscillating voltage to an electrode, in the thumb of the robot for example, which created an electric field. As the field interacted with the water in the bottle, special sensors could determine the change in the electric field and then cause the robot to behave in certain ways.

The game was released on September 3, 2008 for Xbox Live Arcade, while the Wii version was released in 2009. Overview The game is inspired by the popular Internet meme Pirates versus Ninjas. It is played between various oddball groups, including the eponymous Pirate and Ninja teams, as well as other teams like the zombies and robots. Players on each team behave stereotypically, e.g., zombies are slow and defensive. Gameplay Gameplay screenshot Players have a limited reserve of energy to use when playing, and all activity drains energy, including running and throwing. Each group has a unique set of powers, such as cloaking, which drains energy even faster. Players can regain energy by various actions, such as successfully catching a thrown ball. The ball can be thrown in several ways. Throwing the ball while running causes the ball to move in the direction faced. Throwing the ball while standing still allows a 360 degree aim, with better tracking. Throwing the ball while jumping increases the force at which the ball hits. Reception The game received \\"generally unfavorable reviews\\" on both platforms according to the review aggregation website Metacritic. Official Xbox Magazine gave the Xbox 360 version a score of six out of ten, over five months before the game was released.

Gach was born in 1952 to Joseph Harry Gach (1917‚Äì2007), a retired army colonel, and Dorothy Louise Shive (1921‚Äì2004). He got his start at a couple of stations in Chester, Pennsylvania as \\"Jay Roberts\\" in the late 1960s.WVCH Jay worked for KLOU in Lake Charles, LA 1975-1976. In 1989 through 1992, Gach worked for \\"Kajun 103\\" in Baton Rouge Louisiana, as a morning show host. In a dramatic foreshadowing of his radio career to follow, Gach spectacularly flamed out in Baton Rouge. In this early era of talk radio, Gach also attempted a midday show on 1300 WIBR in Port Allen, Louisiana. Apparently due to his excessive weight, Gach was often at a loss trying to talk for extended periods on WIBR without use of his cart-based sound effects. Gach would later state his poor performance in Louisiana was an act of deliberate self-sabotage brought on by depressive episodes. From the summer of 1992 through 1995, Gach worked as a talk radio host on WGR (\\"J.R. on 'GR\\") and later WWKB in Buffalo, New York, where a doctor secretly treated Gach's depression with the antidepressant Prozac. Gach famously quipped on the air that he liked the Buffalo area and wanted to stay there so much that, if necessary, he would \\"drive a bus\\" in order to earn enough money to stay in the area. However, this promise would be broken as WWKB prepared for one of its many format changes and Gach then returned to Louisiana (this time, New Orleans-based WWL). After WWL he hosted a show from 1998 to 2002 on WGY in Schenectady, NY, the region that he would call home for the next several years. During this time, he briefly held (for a few weeks in February 2001) the late-night host's position at one of America's top news/talk stations, WLW in Cincinnati, Ohio, from which he was fired for referring to Japanese people as \\"yellow monkeys.\\" As his behavior became increasingly erratic starting in 2001, Gach mysteriously disappeared from the airwaves in August 2002; two months later, his then-wife (Suzie Gach, a radio veteran with whom J.R. would often co-host his shows) announced that he had been diagnosed with bipolar disorder and had attempted suicide. After undergoing another round of antidepressants, Gach would later resurface on WRCZ/WBOE \\"The Bone\\" (now WYKV) in Albany as that station's afternoon and later morning host; paired with Shawn \\"Pi\\" Bolts,Bio of Shawn Bolts he continued to unapologetically make many controversial racial comments and jokes including the harassment of one individual, referring to a restaurant in which she was working as a \\"genetic mutant restaurant\\" during a February 15, 2006 broadcast.Gavin, Robert. Cruel words have a price - Times Union - Albany NY Said individual sued Galaxy Communications, then owners of WRCZ/WBOE, and the lawsuit was settled for $1,000,000 in December 2007. Gach had been released by WBOE in August 2006. Gach is also credited as being the first person to voice a radio commercial with a profanity, describing Sinus Buster cayenne nasal spray as \\"the best shit that ever was\\" for a commercial on Sirius Satellite Radio. The radio spot was conceived by Wayne Perry, inventor of Sinus Buster and infamous entrepreneur known for his guerrilla marketing tactics. For most of 2007, Gach hosted his own talk show on Internet radio, paid for by sponsors. It included local advertisements, announcements by nationally-recognized voiceover personality Jim Cutler (also known as the voice of ESPN Radio and many other stations), and weather forecasts for the Albany/Schenectady area, even though the show was based (by Gach's own admission) from a home studio in Florida. Like his previous shows, Gach prominently featured his significant other, although Suzie had long since divorced him and this time, he was with his girlfriend Erica. The show was completely uncensored and frequently used language and euphemisms that would not be allowed on traditional radio. The show aired live on weekdays from 2 PM to 4 PM Eastern Time and looped the rest of the time. In December 2007, Gach's father and aunt both died. This, coupled with the lawsuit settlement and the late 2000s recession, prompted Gach to pull his show and his Web site offline, at first listing a tribute to his parents and his late aunt, and later only a black screen, with the words \\"Stay Tuned...\\" in the center of the screen in yellow lettering. By the end of 2007, the \\"jrshowonline.com\\" and \\"jrgach.com\\" domains had been taken offline or allowed to expire. Gach was an avowed libertarian, supported the campaign of the late Harry Browne in 1996 and supported Ron Paul for President. Gach died July 13, 2015 at his home in New Port Richey, Florida after a lifelong battle with diabetes. He was 63 years of age. JR had become a bit of a recluse after leaving the talk-show circuit. He died without issue and his remains were cremated.http://www.legacy.com/obituaries/sptimes/obituary.aspx?n=jay- gach&pid;=175291613&fhid;=31034 References External links * https://web.archive.org/web/20071214232228/http://jrgach.com/ was JR's official Web site (offline) * *Selected podcasts Category:American talk radio hosts Category:American libertarians Category:People with bipolar disorder Category:People from Schenectady, New York Category:1952 births Category:2015 deaths Category:Shock jocks ","title":"J.

In music, harmonization is the chordal accompaniment to a line or melody: \\"Using chords and melodies together, making harmony by stacking scale tones as triads\\".Schonbrun, Marc (2006). The Everything Music Theory Book: A Complete Guide to Taking Your Understanding of Music to the Next Level, p.257. . A harmonized scale can be created by using each note of a musical scale as a root note for a chord and then by taking other tones within the scale building the rest of a chord. For example, using an Ionian (major scale) * the root note would become the I major chord, * the second note the ii minor chord, * the third note the iii minor chord, * the fourth note the IV major chord, * the fifth note the V major chord (or even a dominant 7th), * the sixth note the vi minor chord, * the seventh note the vii diminished chord and * the octave would be a I major chord. Using the minor (aeolian mode) one would have: * i minor, * ii diminished, * ()III major, * iv minor, * v minor, * ()VI major, * ()VII major and * the i minor an octave higher.  Reharmonization  Reharmonization is the technique of taking an existing melodic line and altering the harmony that accompanies it. Typically, a melody is reharmonized to provide musical interest or variety. Another common use of reharmonization is to introduce a new section in the music, such as a coda or bridge. = Reharmonizing a melody = A melodic tone can often be harmonized in a variety of different ways. For example, an E might be harmonized with an E major chord (E ‚Äì G - B). In this case, the melodic tone is acting as the root of the chord. That same E might be harmonized with a C major chord (C ‚Äì E ‚Äì G), making it the third of the chord. This concept extends to ninths (E would act as the 9th if harmonized with a Dm7 chord ‚Äì D ‚Äì F ‚Äì A ‚Äì C ‚Äì E), fifths (E would act as 5 on an A augmented chord ‚Äì A - C ‚Äì E), and a wide array of other options. Typically however, reharmonizations involve not just a single melody note, but a melodic line. As a result, there are often several melodic tones which might occur over a harmony, and all of these must be considered when reharmonizing. For example, if a melody composed of E - F and G was originally harmonized with Emaj7, choosing D7 as the reharmonization chord might not be the best choice, since each melodic tone would create semitone or minor 9th dissonance with chord members of the supporting harmony. Experienced arrangers might decide to use these kinds of highly dissonant chords when reharmonizing, however handling this dissonance requires a good ear and a deep understanding of harmony. = Jazz reharmonization = In jazz, the term is typically used to refer to the process of reharmonizing some or all of a tune, whereby an existing melody is refitted with a new chord progression. Jazz musicians often take the melody from a well-known standard and alter the changes to make the tune sound more contemporary or progressive. Art Tatum was a pioneer of reharmonization, and later on John Coltrane, Miles Davis and Bill Evans were among the first to seriously explore its possibilities, and since then the technique has become an essential tool for the jazz musician and jazz arranger.  Chord substitution  One of the most common techniques in jazz reharmonization is the use of substitute chords, through a technique known as tritone substitution. In tritone substitution, a dominant chord is replaced by another dominant chord a tritone above its tonic. This technique is based on the fact that the third and seventh degrees of a dominant chord are enharmonically the same as the seventh and third degrees of the dominant chord a tritone away. For example, B and F, the third and seventh of a G7 chord, are enharmonic equivalents of C and F, the seventh and third of a D7 chord. Since the tritone is a distinguishing feature of the sound of a dominant 7th chord, a D7 chord may thus replace G7. Tritone substitution works very well on standards, because the chord progressions typically utilize the II ‚Äì V ‚Äì I progression and the circle of fifths. For example, a jazz standard using a chord progression of Dm7 ‚Äì G7 ‚Äì Cmaj7 could easily be reharmonized to Dm7 ‚Äì D7 ‚Äì Cmaj7, (G7 is replaced with the dominant 7th chord a tritone away, D7). The new progression has a more contemporary sound, with chromatic bass motion and smooth voice leading in the upper parts. Tritone substitution is also possible with major seventh chords, for example Dm7 ‚Äì G7 ‚Äì Cmaj7 could become Dm7 ‚Äì Dmaj7 ‚Äì Cmaj7. Thad Jones sometimes uses this type of substitution in his big band writing.Wright, Rayburn. Inside the Score: a detailed analysis of 8 classic jazz ensemble charts by Sammy Nestico, Thad Jones, and Bob Brookmeyer. New York: Kendor Music, Inc., 1982. pp. 45 ‚Äì 109. As opposed to the classical approach to tonal harmony, in jazz there are only three functions: tonic, subdominant and dominant. Therefore, chords can also be substituted for congruent functions: for example, the second degree can be substituted for the fourth degree, the tonic can be substituted for the sixth/third degree and so on. The fourth degree in major may be substituted for a seventh chord to create a \\"bluesy\\" sound. In a progression going up a fourth, if the first chord is a minor seventh chord, it can also be substituted for a seventh chord; a relative second degree can also be added before it to create a ii-V-I turnaround. (A sole minor seventh or seventh chord can be perceived as a second degree or its dominant quality substitution, in which case a fifth may follow.) In the same progression, chord qualities are sometimes flexible: the IImaj7 chord mentioned in the previous paragraph may get a preceding VImaj7 chord instead of the relative II or its tritone substitution. Combining the above techniques, the following progression: C  Am7  Dm7  G7  C  can turn into E7 A7  Bbm7 Eb7  D7 F7  Abmaj7 Dbmaj7  C   Planing  Planing is a reharmonization technique used by both improvisers and arrangers. It refers to the technique of sliding a chord (or chord tone) up or down, either chromatically or a tritone apart, maintaining the shape and voicing of the chord, at times resolving to the original chord. For example, F7 (F ‚Äì A ‚Äì C ‚Äì E) could slide up to become G7 (G - B - D - F), thus \\"planing\\" each note up a semitone. The planed chords can be further embellished: for example, if a D major is planed down a semitone, a minor seventh can be added to the resulting chord, C; as a dominant chord assumed to be the fifth degree of the momentarily tonicized F major, it can have a second degree added to it, thus creating an incomplete ii-V-I turnaround which may or may not resolve to the original chord: Gm7 C7  (D) Planing is often used by jazz arrangers to reharmonize melodic passing tones which, if voiced as a vertical sonority, might clash with the prevailing harmony in the progression. As well, a number of improvisers have used planing effectively, typically as part of a progression. Herbie Hancock uses improvised planing on his tune \\"Chameleon\\", on his 1973 Head Hunters record; McCoy Tyner uses it extensively (specifically, pentatonic scales located a tritone apart) in his recordings with John Coltrane, most notably \\"A Love Supreme\\", as well as in his own albums of the same period.  Multi-tonic systems  A concept introduced by Joseph Schillinger and Nicolas Slonimsky, the idea of multiple tonics derived from equal division of the octave appealed to John Coltrane, who proceeded to compose the groundbreaking tune \\"Giant Steps\\". The composition features a series of dominant chords and ii-V-I turnarounds resolving to three tonalities built on the B augmented triad (the three-tonic system): B D7  G Bb7  Eb  Am7 D7  G Bb7  Eb F#7  B  Fm7 Bb7  Eb  Am7 D7  G  C#m7 F#7  B  Fm7 Bb7  Eb  C#m7 F#7  (B) The harmonic structure of Giant Steps was unfamiliar territory for many jazz musicians at the time, including Tommy Flanagan, the pianist on the original 1959 recording. The relative minimalism of his solo on the tune (compared with the density of Coltrane's) is considered by many to be an indication that he was not yet comfortable improvising on such a structure, even given his extensive experience within the jazz idiom. Developing the technique further, Coltrane started utilizing the three-tonic system (and later, the four-tonic system as well, which is based on tonics derived from a diminished seventh chord) as a reharmonization tool, which has ultimately become known as \\"Coltrane changes\\". In this example from \\"Countdown\\" (which is really a \\"Coltrane changes\\" version of \\"Tune Up\\", the well-known jazz standard composed by Miles Davis), the long ii-V-I in the key of D major is laced with V-I progressions that resolve to the three tonics of the D augmented triad: :original (Tune Up): Em7  A7  D  D  :reharmonized (Countdown): Em7 F7  Bb Db7  Gb A7  D  This kind of reharmonization mostly requires alteration of the original melody because of the frequent modulations and therefore, becomes \\"reharmonization of the changes\\" rather than the classic concept of re-harmonizing the melody.

History  In 1932 the land was purchased by Dr. Victor Reinstein for a private nature sanctuary. He and his son Robert Reinstein, along with helpers John Ream and his son Fred J. Ream Sr., planted 30,000 trees, and constructed 19 ponds, marshes, and swamps during the early 1960s. His dedication to nature conservation went as far as cleaning the ponds out every year by draining them. Every time a pond was drained he would keep the fish inside his home. When the harsh winters reached their peak Victor and his two sons would gather up geese and ducks to keep them dry and healthy. After Reinstein's 1984 death, his widow, Julia Boyer Reinstein donated the reserve as per her husband's wishes from the Reinstein Estate to The State of New York, which assumed control of the property in 1986. The Dr. Victor Reinstein Woods Nature Preserve was officially dedicated on August 23, 1989. In 2007 the Environmental Education Center was completed and opened to the public.

Life Marie-Madeleine Chauvigny (also known as: de la Peltrie) was born in 1603 at Alen√ßon, France, the daughter of Guillaume de Chauvigny, Sieur d‚ÄôAlen√ßon et de Vaubougon, and of Lady Jeanne Du Bouchet. With no male heir, Guillaume de Chauvigny tried to arrange aristocratic matches for his daughters. Marie-Madeleine, the youngest, despite inclination for the cloistered life, at the age of sixteen, found herself obliged to marry the Chevalier de Gruel, Seigneur de La Peltrie. From this marriage, which lasted only five years, there was born one daughter who died in infancy. Widowed at the age of 22, Mme de La Peltrie went into solitary retirement in order to avoid her father‚Äôs solicitous attempts to find her a second husband. .Mme de La Peltrie was influenced by the Jesuit Relations to devote her life and fortune to North Amerindian missions.Jaenen, Cornelius J., \\"Marie- Madeleine de Gruel de La Peltrie\\", The Canadian Encyclopedia As a result of a serious illness, she made a vow to St. Joseph, promising, in return for her recovery, to go to Canada, to build a house there under his patronage. Upon the death of her father, her relations, thinking her unable to administer her fortune, sought to have her deprived of control over her estate. She appealed to the judicial court of Rouen, won her suit and, as a result, became mistress of her inheritance. Eager to leave for New France, Mme de La Peltrie went to Paris and consulted M. Vincent de Paul. Joseph Poncet was a Jesuit teaching in Orl√©ans; his father was a member of the Company of One Hundred Associates chartered to trade in New France. While at Orleans, he met the son of the widow Marie Guyart. In February, 1639 he put her in touch with Madame de la Pettrie. Both accompanied him to New France. When she was unable to find space for her baggage on the ships leaving for America, Mme de La Peltrie chartered a vessel at her own expense and loaded it with provisions and furnishings. She arrived in New France with a number of Ursulines including a future nun, Charlotte Barr√© (Mother Saint-Ignace) and Marie de l'Incarnation, who was to be the religious founder of the Order of Ursulines. (The order later was called the Ursulines of Quebec). Also part of the passenger list on that voyage was Father Barth√©lemy Vimont who was the third superior of the Jesuit Mission in Canada, and Father Joseph Poncet. Her intimacy with Jeanne Mance, Maisonneuve and the other prospective founders of Ville Marie, during the first winter spent near Quebec (1641‚Äì42), prompted her to follow them to Montreal, where she was the first communicant at the first Mass celebrated by Father Vimont, S.J. (1642). Except for an 18-month absence to help found the utopian colony of Ville-Marie [Montr√©al] in 1642, she lived cloistered with the nuns she supported. In spite of her entreaties she was never formally admitted to the novitiate, but led the humble and austere life of a true religious, scrupulously following every detail of the observances, and reaching a high degree of contemplative prayer. Legacy In 1739 some of the infirmary‚Äôs silver pieces, which had belonged in large part to Mme de La Peltrie were given to make a sanctuary lamp. The Mus√©e des Ursulines de Qu√©bec is located in a building just outside the walls of the monastery, on the foundations of the house of the community‚Äôs benefactress, Madeleine Chauvigny of Peltrie (1603-1671).

It forms the western side of a narrow valley in which are situated the towns of Yarrowsburg and Brownsville. South Mountain is on the eastern side of this valley running roughly parallel to it. The ridge runs from Rohrersville, in the north, to the Potomac River across from Harpers Ferry, West Virginia, in the south. Across the Potomac the ridge continues as Blue Ridge Mountain in Virginia and West Virginia. To the west of Elk Mountain is the broader Cumberland Valley, in which lie the towns of Hagerstown and Chambersburg, and the Potomac River. The southern end of the ridge, which is part of Harpers Ferry National Historical Park, is known as Maryland Heights. Maryland Heights Cliffs as seen from the C&O; Canal History In the early 19th century, Elk Ridge was the site of numerous charcoal hearths, which produced charcoal for nearby iron furnaces from wood harvested on the mountain. More than 50 hearths were constructed between 1810 and 1840. The Maryland Heights portion of Elk Ridge was the scene of much activity during the American Civil War. Artillery emplacements and fortifications were first erected on the mountain by Union forces in 1862, during Stonewall Jackson's Valley Campaign. Later that year, during the Battle of Harpers Ferry, the union fortifications on the mountain were attacked by units under General Lafayette McLaws, who subsequently took control of the ridge and used it to deliver devastating artillery fire against the Union garrison at Harpers Ferry. After the battle Confederate forces abandoned the ridge to rejoin the Army of Northern Virginia at Antietam and the Union army quickly reoccupied the heights. Following the Battle of Antietam, Abraham Lincoln came to Maryland to review the army, including the garrisons on the mountain. He began the ascent, but because of the steepness of the slope, turned around halfway up, concluding any man who could make the climb would pass his muster. In June 1863 Union forces again took control of the ridge and enlarged the fortifications in response to the Confederate invasion of Maryland during the Gettysburg Campaign. The \\"Pinnacle Lot\\" of the Maryland Heights was purchased by the Maryland Park System from the grandchildren of the last private owner, Judge Patrick Chapman Savin (1820-1889) of Harper's Ferry, MD; the lot was in turn gifted by the State of Maryland to the National Park Service in the 1950s. Judge Patrick and his brother, John Chapman Savin, and a future son-in-law, John Marion Marsteller (1841-1898) were among those who participated in the capture of John Brown and his men. It was during this time that the side of the cliff overlooking Harper's Ferry was leased for advertising seen by the passengers of trains as they entered and exited the tunnel under the Maryland Heights. Recreation A trail system, maintained by the National Park Service, ascends Maryland Heights and tours the Civil War-era fortifications and provides access to the cliffs on the mountain which contain views of Harpers Ferry and the Potomac Water Gap. An unmaintained trail leads along the ridge of Park Service land onto private property to Buggy Rocks and views east of Pleasant Valley. Mountain climbing is permitted by the National Park Service along the Maryland Heights cliffs.  Bibliography  * Whitman, T. Stephen, Antietam 1862: Gateway to Emancipation, ABC-CLIO, 2012 .

Towards the war's end, she was converted into a storeship, keeping fleet ships supplied with necessary materiel.  Purchased at New York City in 1861  Sea Foam was a wooden-hulled hermaphrodite brig purchased by the Navy at New York City on 14 September 1861; fitted out as a mortar vessel at the New York Navy Yard; and commissioned on 27 January 1862, Acting Master Henry E. Williams in command.  Civil War operations  = Assigned to the Mississippi River Mortar Flotilla = Sea Foam was assigned to the Mortar Flotilla which was established early in 1862 to support Flag Officer David Farragut's New Orleans, Louisiana, campaign. A few days later, the ship departed New York Harbor and proceeded, via Key West, Florida, and Ship Island, Mississippi, to the mouth of the Mississippi River. She entered the river through Pass a l'Outre on 18 March and spent the next month preparing for the impending attack on the Confederate forts which guarded the river. = Bombarding Fort Jackson on the Mississippi = On the afternoon of 18 April, Sea Foam and her sister mortar boats of the flotilla's third division opened fire on Fort Jackson and, during the following four hours, hurled 43 shells at the fort. Before dawn the next day, she resumed the bombardment and kept it up until well after sunset that evening, firing 88 shells during the day. She continued this pattern of operations during the following four days. = Bombarding the fort while Farragut makes a dash up the river = Then, at midnight on the night of 23 and 24 April, she opened fire to join the bombardment which preceded Farragut's dash up river past the forts. She increased the rate of her fire to her maximum tempo some three and one-half hours later as Farragut's ships moved within range of the Southern batteries, and she maintained the pace until the Union ships were safely above the forts. = Reassigned to the blockade off Mobile Bay = After New Orleans surrendered, Porter took his flotilla to a position off Mobile Bay to await Farragut. On 15 May, Sea Foam and captured sloops Sarah and New Eagle, both laden with cotton. = Sea Foam called back to Vicksburg, and then runs aground = However, the Flag Officer was delayed by operations on the Mississippi and, after learning of the strength of the Confederate works at Vicksburg, recalled Porter and the mortar vessels. In returning up the Mississippi River, Sea Foam ran aground on a sand bar below New Orleans and remained down river while her sister mortar boats supported Farragut's operations in the vicinity of Vicksburg during June and July 1862. She did get into action again on the Mississippi in the spring of 1863 when Farragut dashed past the Port Hudson batteries to stop Confederate commerce across the Mississippi from the Red River. =Crew hampered by yellow fever, Sea Foam returns to New York = For the next year, the brig, badly hampered by yellow fever, remained on the Mississippi River supporting the operations of the West Gulf Blockading Squadron. On 3 May 1864, she was ordered to New York City for repairs and replacement of her worn mortar. However, she was sent on to Boston, Massachusetts, and was decommissioned at the Boston Navy Yard on 31 May. = Sea Foam's final operations of the war = Restored to fighting trim, Sea Foam was recommissioned at Boston on 1 August 1864 and assigned to the South Atlantic Blockading Squadron. She served as a store ship at Port Royal, South Carolina, until ordered north in January 1865. Sea Foam served in the North Atlantic Blockading Squadron for the closing months of the war.

The highway is approximately long, and partially constructed as a freeway, with the rest being a divided highway. The roadway links Interstate 275 (I-275) to the Cincinnati/Northern Kentucky International Airport (CVG Airport), and has been designated as a connector route by the Federal Highway Administration (FHWA). A road first appeared near the location of KY 212 around 1937. A short road was built in the location of KY 212 when the U.S. Army Air Corps built the predecessor to the CVG Airport. The road was reconstructed to a divided highway in 1972, and has remained relatively unchanged since. The original KY 212 went southeast from KY 100 in Meshack southeast to Center Point. This road was decommissioned by 1972, and is now KY 2439. Route description Kentucky Route 212 begins at an incomplete interchange with a one-way loop road, named Terminal Drive, in the central region of Cincinnati/Northern Kentucky International Airport. At this interchange, KY 212 is a four-lane divided highway. The highway proceeds northeast reaching a diamond interchange with Kentucky Route 236 (Donaldson Road). A turnaround ramp that transfers southbound traffic to the northbound lanes is located a short distance from the termini of the southbound ramps of the interchange. The roadway continues northward from the interchange, passing a large airport parking lot and a small airport road before reaching a partial cloverleaf interchange with I-275. The road proceeds northward from the interchange, passing a few small businesses before reaching its northern terminus, an at-grade intersection with Kentucky Route 20, known as Petersburg Road. Kentucky Route 212 is maintained by the Kentucky Transportation Cabinet (KYTC). Part of the job of the KYTC is to measure traffic along the highway. These counts are taken using a metric called annual average daily traffic (AADT). This is a statistical calculation of the average daily number of vehicles that travel along a portion of the highway. The highest AADT along KY 212 at the southern portion of the interchange with I-275, with an approximate count of 21,219 vehicles. The lowest AADT along the highway is just north of the interchange with I-275, with an approximate count of 11,100 vehicles. The portion of the highway traveling from the interchange with I-275 to the southern terminus is designated as an Intermodal Connector Route, part of the National Highway System, a network of roads important to the country's economy, defense, and mobility.

They lived in Queen Anne's County, Province of Maryland, owned their own farm, of unknown acres but was said to have been considerable. Land recorded in 1744, was named \\"Clow's Hope.\\" In 1747 another was recorded and it was called \\"Boon's Hope\\". Boon's Hope cost Nathaniel and Susannah 2,100 pounds of tobacco, which was a common practice in the early colonies, paying for items with tobacco off your own land. Nathaniel Clow died in 1748, his estate papers and will are filed in the courthouse in Annapolis. He wanted his estate divided equally among his wife and children. The children were John (born 1732), Mary (born 1733), Cheney (born 1734), Susannah (born 1737), Rachael (born 1738), James (born 1740), Sarah (born 1742), Rebecca (born 1743) and Ann (born 1749). Susannah Clow died before 1756. The exact date is unknown. Marriage and family Cheney Clow married Elizabeth Barcus (Barkhurst) and settled in the same area as Nathanial and Susannah. They farmed and raised a family. They had two children that are known of, Joshua and Arrana. Cheney's Rebellion, capture and imprisonment At the outbreak of the American War of Independence, about a third of the colonists had no desire for independence from Britain but in Kent County, Delaware, where Cheney Clow was living, the Loyalist were greatly outnumbered. Cheney chose to support the King of Britain and was commissioned a British officer at some point either earlier before the Revolution began or toward the beginning of Colonial Revolutionary activities. He now found himself a Tory. As the war progressed the Tories constantly created terror by raiding and plundering the colonist, supplies to the British, robbed the mails, plotted against the life of Washington, and generally became very disliked by their neighbors. During the War, in 1778, the colony passed a law requiring all male citizens over the age of 21 to take an \\"Oath of Allegiance.\\" A Tory would be pardoned if the Oath was given, if not he would suffer the confiscation of all his land and possessions. When it became time for Cheney's Oath he refused. He also refused to pay taxes to Delaware claiming he was living in Maryland. His farm was on both sides of the state line but the house sat in Delaware. On the morning of April 18, 1778, the Sheriff of Kent County, Delaware, John Clayton, went out to arrest Cheney Clow. This attempt erupted into a gun battle and one of the Sheriff's men, named Moore, was killed. Cheney was charged with the murder of the posse member Moore. Moore had been shot in the back while facing and firing toward Cheney Clow when he was shot. It is thought that Moore was shot by a member of his own posse. When the battle was over, Cheney's wife, Susannah, who had been helping her husband load rifles, was wounded, and Cheney was arrested and taken to jail. This action 200 years later would be known as \\"Cheney Clow's Rebellion\\". At this point, the local citizens wanted Cheney's head, they wanted blood, they wanted him charged, and executed for treason. For four years he sat in prison, and on December 12, 1782, Cheney Clow was brought to trial. He was tried for treason for his role in the Loyalist rebellion against Delaware. The jury found him not guilty of treason and he was acquitted, but authorities kept him in prison. It seemed that Cheney hadn't taken the oath and therefore could not be charged with treason. Keeping him in prison, they charged him with burglary and murder; later the burglary charge was dropped for lack of evidence, but he had to stand trial on the murder charge. Murder trial and execution At the trial, the testimony from the Sheriff was that Moore was shot in the back, and not from Cheney's gun, but probably was shot from one of the Sheriff's own men who was firing toward Cheney from a position behind Moore. The evidence that Clow actually killed the man was weak. However, this did not sway the jury. In May 1783, a jury convicted him of murder and the judge sentenced him to death. He was sentenced to be hanged by the neck until dead. It now fell on Delaware's governor Nicholas Van Dyke to set the time and place for the execution. The Governor wished he could pardon Clow but felt that he was unable to pardon him for political reasons and did nothing. He did, however, postpone the execution without ever appointing an actual date. He, in essence, postponed Cheney's execution indefinitely. Nothing happened for six years. A new governor, Thomas Collins, came into office in October 1786. More petitions for pardon were filed by the family but still to no avail. Cheney's wife and children finally gave up their long fight. In 1788 a final letter from Cheney Clow, having been in close confinement for 10 years, the letter addressed to the new governor requested that a pardon be granted at once or that a warrant be issued without delay for his execution. The pardon was not granted, and Cheney Clow \\"went bravely to his death, singing a hymn as he walked to the gallows\\". No specific date was recorded for the execution. Cheney had no will, and there is no record of the disposition of his estate. After they hanged Cheney, the family took his body and buried it in a secret place. Many think the grave was near the house but unmarked. In January 1790 the eldest daughter, Arrana, petitioned the State of Delaware to settle the estate of Clow and to distribute such among his heirs. The petition was \\"ordered to lie on the table\\" and on the table it remained. Nothing regarding the disposition of Clow's possessions is known. The site description of Cheney's Rebellion The present and original appearance of the site of the Cheney Clow Rebellion was summarized in the US Department of the Interior, National Park Service, National Register of Historic Places Inventory Nomination Form: Significance of the rebellion The Statement of Significance of the Cheney Clough Rebellion site from the US Department of the Interior, National Park Service, National Register of Historic Places Inventory Nomination Form continues with: Legacy After Cheney Clow was hung, most of his children stayed in the Northern Queen Anne's County, Maryland and Kent County, Delaware area, raised families and lived their lives passing from generation to generation until the present day. One of Cheney's children, his Son, Joshua, left the Maryland and Delaware area, changed the spelling of the name to Clough and moved West to the Ohio Valley. Documents show a marriage certificate of Joshua Clough and Sarah Walker being married in Kent County, Delaware, on October 2, 1794, and they had a son, Edward, who was born in 1794 in Virginia. Joshua Clow died in Harrison County, Ohio, where a large contingent of descendants still reside. Most of the other lineal descendants of Cheney Clow have lived in and around the area where Cheney Clow lived and had his rebellion, in the Northern Queen Anne's County, Maryland area, specifically the town of Sudlersville, Maryland, ever since. The Clow name has changed over time and many of the Clow lineage in the area now go by both Clow and Clough. On April 6, 1967, the local County Newspaper, the Queen Anne's County Record Observer, ran a story with the headline, \\"Sudlersville Couple are Married 67 Years!\\" This couple were Dudley Clow and his wife Emma Everett Clow. Mr. Clow was 90 years old at the time and of interest is that the family still used the 'Clow' spelling instead of 'Clough'. In 1969, the same newspaper published a photograph of five generations of Cheney Clow's descendants sitting together on a park bench. All were farmers and/or residents of the local Sudlersville community. In April 2009, a direct descendant of Cheney Clow, while serving as the local Fire Chief of the Sudlersville Volunteer Fire Company was killed in a single vehicle crash while responding to an alarm in a Fire Department Emergency Response Vehicle. Forty- one-year-old Charles F. \\"Buck\\" Clough, Jr. was hailed as a hero, made national news and his accident and death has had a profound effect on the small, tight- knit farming community. Cheney Clow's descendants suffered another terrible blow in the last part of 2009 when Nelson H. \\"Dickie\\" Clough of Millington, Maryland died on Christmas Eve, December 24, 2009. He was 85. He was the uncle and best friend of Charles F. \\"Buck\\" Clough, Jr. and was the current cornerstone of the huge Clough clan in the Northern Queen Anne's County area. He was a member of United States Army during World War II. He served with D Company, 83rd Armored Reconnaissance Battalion, 3rd Armored Division. He fought in the Battle of the Bulge, the Ardennes and the Rhineland. He fought in and across Europe until Victory in Europe was declared. He was a life member of VFW Post 652 in Millington, Maryland, where he served as Commander 5 times and he was a member of the American Legion Post 14, Smyrna, Delaware. His death has also had a profound effect on the local community and the Clough family in particular. Cheney Clow's life and legacy continue to influence the area and his life, and actions are still rippling through the fabric of life in the Kent County, Delaware and Northern Queen Anne's County, Maryland areas.

They are 15R-epimers of their lipoxin counterparts; that is, the epi-lipoxins, 15-epi-lipoxin A4 (15-epi-LxA4) and 15-epi-lipoxin B4 (15-epi-LXB4), differ from their respective lipoxin A4 (LxA4) and lipoxin B4 (LxB4) epimers in that their 15-hydroxy residue has R rather than S chirality. Formulae for these lipoxins (Lx) are: *LxA4: 5S,6R,15S-trihydroxy-7E,9E,11Z,13E-ETE *LxB4: 5S,14R,15S-trihydroxy-6E,8Z,10E,12E-ETE *15-epi-LxA4: 5S,6R,15R-trihydroxy-7E,9E,11Z,13E-eicosatetraenoic acid *15-epi-LxB4: 5S,14R,15R-trihydroxy-6E,8Z,10E,12E-eicosatrienoic acid The two-epi-Lx's as well as the two lx's are nonclassic eicosanoids that, like other members of the specialized pro-resolving mediators class of autocoids, form during and act to resolve inflammatory responses. Synthesis of the lipoxins typically involves a lipoxygenase enzyme which acts to add a 15S-hydroxyl residue to the lipoxin precursor, arachidonic acid, whereas synthesis of the epi-lipoxins involves aspirin-pretreated cyclooxygenase 2 or a cytochrome P450 enzyme which adds a 15R-hydroxyl residue to arachidonic acid.

State of Texas, 318 U.S. 413 (1943), was a case in which the Supreme Court of the United States held that a Dallas city ordinance, which prohibited distribution of handbills on the streets, violated the Free Exercise Clause of the First Amendment because the material being distributed is religious in its nature..  Facts of the case  Jamison, a member of the Jehovah's Witnesses, was charged with distributing handbills on the streets of Dallas, Texas, in violation of an ordinance of that city which prohibits their distribution. She was convicted in the Corporation Court of Dallas, and appealed to the County Criminal Court where, after a new trial, she was again convicted and a fine of $5.00 and costs was imposed. Decision of the Court Justice Black delivered the opinion of the Court: \\"The state can prohibit the use of the street for the distribution of purely commercial leaflets, even though such leaflets may have 'a civic appeal, or a moral platitude' appended. They may not prohibit the distribution of handbills in the pursuit of a clearly religious activity merely because the handbills invite the purchase of books for the improved understanding of the religion or because the handbills seek in a lawful fashion to promote the raising of funds for religious purposes.\\"  See also  * Largent v.

Francisco Ballesteros (1770 in Zaragoza - June 29, 1832 in Paris) emerged as a career Spanish General during the Peninsular War. Ballasteros served against the First French Republic in the 1793 War of the Pyrenees. He was dismissed from his post for lack of service in 1804 until Prime Minister Godoy rehabilitated him and assigned him to customs in Asturias. Following the French invasion of 1808, Ballasteros took command of a regiment from the Junta General del Principado de Asturias and attached himself to the Army of Galicia under Blake and Casta√±os. After Napoleon's defeat of the Spanish popular armies and the subsequent French invasion of Andalusia, Ballasteros carried on operations against Marshal Soult in the south of Spain. With Blake and Zayas, he commanded the Spanish divisions that resisted every blow at the Battle of Albuera. His forces liberated M√°laga in August 1812. On October 12, 1812, unwilling to accept a foreigner (Wellington) as supreme commander of the Spanish Army, Ballasteros mutinied and was imprisoned in Ceuta, on the North African coast.Longford, p.365  Liberal Revolution  When the liberal revolution broke out in 1820, he was called back to Madrid, where on March 7 he surrounded the royal palace and forced King Ferdinand VII of Spain to sign the Spanish Constitution of 1812. He became vice-president of the junta provisional, closing many prisons of the Holy Inquisition and restoring municipal rights. On July 7, 1822, Ballesteros defeated the Royal Guards, preventing a coup against the Constitution. For this he was named Captain General of Madrid. In 1823 he fought the French invasion under Louis-Antoine, Duke of Angoul√™me in Navarra and Arag√≥n, but he had to capitulate on August 21, 1823 in Caporla. On October 1, 1823 Fernando VII started his campaign of repression against all who had supported the constitutional government.

Her interests and research contributions span topics including atomic, molecular, and optical physics, nanoscience, laser technology, materials and chemical dynamics, plasma physics, and imaging science. Her work has earned her multiple awards including the prestigious MacArthur Fellowship award in 2000 and the Frederic Ives Medal/Quinn Prize in 2017, the highest award of The Optical Society.  Early life  Born and raised in County Limerick, Ireland, Murnane became interested in physics through her father who was a primary school teacher. She received her B.A. and M.S. from University College, Cork. She moved to the United States to study at the University of California at Berkeley where she earned her PhD in 1989. She is married to physics professor Henry Kapteyn. They work together and operate their own lab at JILA at the University of Colorado.  Work  Murnane has co-authored more than 500 articles in peer reviewed journals, with her work receiving >28000 cites. In their lab, Murnane, Kapteyn, and their students make lasers whose beams flash like a strobe light ‚Äì except that each flash is a trillion times faster. These lasers, like camera flashes, make it possible to record the motions of atoms in chemical reactions, and of atoms and electrons in materials systems. Some of her lasers can generate pulses of less than 12 femtoseconds. Using the very high peak power that it is possible to create with a femtosecond laser, it becomes possible to coherently upconvert light to much shorter wavelengths, in the extreme ultraviolet and soft x-ray region of the spectrum. This high harmonic generation process makes possible for the first time what is essentially a tabletop-scale x-ray laser light source. Prof. Murnane was among the first to explore the use of femtosecond lasers for x-ray generation, and has made substantive pioneering contributions to many aspects of this area of research, including the science and fundamental understanding of the high harmonic process, the laser technology required to use this process to implement practical tabletop light sources for applications, and in applying this new source to make fundamental discoveries in areas ranging from basic atomic and chemical dynamics, to materials dynamics, to nanoimaging. She is also co-founder of the laser company KMLabs, Inc., for which Intel Capital is a co-investor, and which has commercialized these technologies for research and possible industrial applications in nanometrology.

Strine, Jr. (born 1964) is a former judge in the state of Delaware. He served as the Chief Justice of the Delaware Supreme Court from 2014 to 2019. Life and career Born in Baltimore, Strine grew up in Hockessin, Delaware. He graduated from A.I. DuPont High School in 1982. Strine then graduated magna cum laude from the University of Pennsylvania Law School in 1988 with his Juris Doctor, after having received his Bachelor of Arts summa cum laude from the University of Delaware in 1985. Strine clerked for Judge Walter K. Stapleton of the United States Court of Appeals for the Third Circuit and for Chief Judge John F. Gerry of the United States District Court for the District of New Jersey. He was a corporate litigator at the firm of Skadden, Arps, Slate, Meagher & Flom, and then Counsel to Governor Thomas R. Carper. Strine has taught at several academic institutions including UCLA School of Law, University of Pennsylvania Law School, Vanderbilt University Law School, and Harvard Law School, and lectured at many more. He became Vice Chancellor of the Delaware Court of Chancery on November 9, 1998, and became Chancellor of that court on June 22, 2011. During the 2006‚Äì2007 academic year, he served as a special judicial consultant to the American Bar Association's Committee on Corporate Laws. Strine was confirmed as Chief Justice of the Delaware Supreme Court on January 29, 2014. In October 2018, Strine wrote for the majority when it found that the business judgment rule protected a controlling shareholder even though it did not offer minority shareholder protections until after its initial squeeze-out bid.. In July 2019, Strine announced his retirement from the bench, to be carried out at the end of September or October or upon the confirmation of his successor. Strine retired from active service on October 30, 2019. In April 2020, the New York-based law firm, Wachtel Lipton announced that former Judge Strine would be joining its firm, to advise Wachtell‚Äôs clients on mergers, litigation and other matters. Personal life Strine lives in Hockessin, Delaware, with his wife Carrie, an occupational therapist, and their two sons, James and Benjamin. Controversy The Supreme Court of Delaware admonished Strine in 2012 for an opinion he wrote while serving on the Delaware Court of Chancery.http://technologyxyrm.blogspot.com/2012/11/in- unusual-move-delaware-supreme-court.html The opinion included discussion of legal issues about limited liability companies unrelated to the case at hand.http://technologyxyrm.blogspot.com/2012/11/in-unusual-move-delaware- supreme-court.html He also made comments about the litigants' fashion, referred to the case as a \\"drunken WASP fest,\\" and asked them to disclose their religion.http://technologyxyrm.blogspot.com/2012/11/in-unusual-move- delaware-supreme-court.html In a 2010 case, Ingres Corp. v. CA Inc., during a breach of contract case, both sides, Ingres Corp and CA Inc, both agreed that Strine erred. Vice Chancellor Strine made a comment that he, \\"forgot this oral statement and delved only into the voluminous record. As indicated above, this record was confusing and I came away from it with the wrong impression. ‚Ä¶I overlooked this deposition testimony and instead focused upon the written documents in the record when drafting the Post-Trial Opinion. In short, I blew it.‚Äù Yet, he maintained that his \\"original factual finding to the contrary was inaccurate,\\" and after admitting how his error impacted his previous determination, he decided the error does not materially change the outcome of the case. When Judge Strine, Jr., resigned, there was some speculation that he has aspirations to run for Governor of Delaware, and he needed to remove himself from some questionable decisions, such as the decision to uphold the forced sale of a performing and profitable company.

Hb Bassett arises from a mutation at the alpha 94 (G1) position whereby aspartic acid is replaced by alanine (Abdulmalik et al., 2004). Hb Bassett is a disruption of the alpha1 and beta2 contact point (Voet and Voet, 2006, Abdulmalik et al., 2004). Hemoglobin of the Bassett variety has much higher P50 than normal hemoglobin. At pH 7, Hb Bassett has a P50 of approximately 22mmHg and normal hemoglobin has an approximate P50 of 10.5mmHg (Abdulmalik et al., 2004). In addition to high P50 values, Hb Bassett shows a reduced Bohr effect (reduced oxygen unloading) and low cooperativity (n=1.4) resulting in lower oxygen affinity (Abdulmalik et al., 2004). These factors conspire to produce a hemoglobin variant that does not provide sufficient oxygen and manifests itself as low oxygen saturation, episodes of cyanosis and anemia (Abdulmalik et al., 2004). The proposed explanation for Hb Bassett's instability is loosening and destabilization of the hemoglobin R state (bound ligand [oxygen]) and a resulting shift in the equilibrium that exists between the two states towards the T state (unbound oxygen). The instability is localized at the interface between the two dimeric subunits of hemoglobin. The lack of bound oxygen in Hb Bassett homozygotes leads to the clinical outcome of cyanosis (they are cyanotic) (Abdulmalik et al., 2004).

Major inputs to his stories were his invented languages, and maps of Middle-earth. His books contained not just prose but poetry and artwork. J. R. R. Tolkien's fantasy books on Middle-earth, especially The Lord of the Rings and The Silmarillion, drew on a wide array of influences including language, Christianity, mythology, archaeology, ancient and modern literature, and personal experience. He was inspired primarily by his profession, philology; his work centred on the study of Old English literature, especially Beowulf, and he acknowledged its importance to his writings. He was a gifted linguist, influenced by Germanic, Celtic, Finnish, Slavic, and Greek language and mythology. His fiction reflected his Christian beliefs and his early reading of adventure stories and fantasy books. Commentators have attempted to identify many literary and topological antecedents for characters, places and events in Tolkien's writings. Some writers were certainly important to him, including the Arts and Crafts polymath William Morris, and he undoubtedly made use of some real place-names, such as Bag End, the name of his aunt's home. Tolkien stated that he had been influenced by his childhood experiences of the English countryside of Worcestershire and its urbanisation by the growth of Birmingham, and his personal experience of fighting in the trenches of the First World War. Philology Tolkien was a professional philologist, a scholar of comparative and historical linguistics. He was especially familiar with Old English and related languages. He remarked to the poet and The New York Times book reviewer Harvey Breit that \\"I am a philologist and all my work is philological\\"; he explained to his American publisher Houghton Mifflin that this was meant to imply that his work was \\"all of a piece, and fundamentally linguistic [sic] in inspiration. ... The invention of languages is the foundation. The 'stories' were made rather to provide a world for the languages than the reverse. To me a name comes first and the story follows.\\"The Letters of J. R. R. Tolkien, #165 to Houghton Mifflin, 30 June 1955 =Beowulf= Beowulfs , \\"ogres [and] elves [and] devil-corpses\\" helped to inspire Tolkien to create orcs, Elves, and other races. Tolkien was an expert on Old English literature, especially the epic poem Beowulf, and made many uses of it in The Lord of the Rings. For example, Beowulfs list of creatures, , \\"ettens [giants] and elves and demon-corpses\\", contributed to his creation of some of the races of beings in Middle-earth, though with so little information about what elves were like, he was forced to combine scraps from all the Old English sources he could find. He derived the Ents from a phrase in another Old English poem, Maxims II, , \\"skilful work of Ents\\"; The Tolkien scholar Tom Shippey suggests that Tolkien took the name of the tower of Orthanc (or√æanc) from the same phrase, reinterpreted as \\"Orthanc, the Ents' fortress\\". The word occurs again in Beowulf in the phrase , \\"[a mail-shirt, a] cunning-net sewn, by a smith's skill\\": Tolkien used searo in its Mercian form *saru for the name of Orthanc's ruler, the wizard Saruman, incorporating the ideas of cunning and technology into Saruman's character. He made use of Beowulf, too, along with other Old English sources, for many aspects of the Riders of Rohan: for instance, their land was the Mark, a version of the Mercia where he lived, in Mercian dialect *Marc. Sigelwara etymologies, leading to three strands in his writings on Middle-earth. =Sigelwara= Several Middle-earth concepts may have come from the Old English word Sigelwara, used in the Codex Junius to mean \\"Aethiopian\\". Tolkien wondered why there was a word with this meaning, and conjectured that it had once had a different meaning, which he explored in detail in his essay \\"Sigelwara Land\\", published in two parts in 1932 and 1934.J. R. R. Tolkien, \\"Sigelwara Land\\" Medium Aevum Vol. 1, No. 3. December 1932 and Medium Aevum Vol. 3, No. 2. June 1934. He stated that Sigel meant \\"both sun and jewel\\", the former as it was the name of the Sun rune *sowil≈ç (·õã), the latter from Latin sigillum, a seal. He decided that the second element was *hearwa, possibly related to Old English heor√∞, \\"hearth\\", and ultimately to Latin carbo, \\"soot\\". He suggested this implied a class of demons \\"with red-hot eyes that emitted sparks and faces black as soot\\". Shippey states that this \\"helped to naturalise the Balrog\\" (a demon of fire) and contributed to the sun-jewel Silmarils. The Aethiopians suggested to Tolkien the Haradrim, a dark southern race of men. =Nodens= Tolkien visited the temple of Nodens at a place called \\"Dwarf's Hill\\" and translated an inscription with a curse upon a ring. It may have inspired his dwarves, Mines of Moria, rings, and Celebrimbor \\"Silver-Hand\\", an Elven-smith who contributed to Moria's construction. In 1928, a 4th-century pagan cult temple was excavated at Lydney Park, Gloucestershire. Tolkien was asked to investigate a Latin inscription there: \\"For the god Nodens. Silvianus has lost a ring and has donated one-half [its worth] to Nodens. Among those who are called Senicianus do not allow health until he brings it to the temple of Nodens.\\" funded by the European Research Council via the LatinNow project The Anglo-Saxon name for the place was Dwarf's Hill, and in 1932 Tolkien traced Nodens to the Irish hero Nuada Airgetl√°m, \\"Nuada of the Silver-Hand\\".J. R. R. Tolkien, \\"The Name Nodens\\", Appendix to \\"Report on the excavation of the prehistoric, Roman and post-Roman site in Lydney Park, Gloucestershire\\", Reports of the Research Committee of the Society of Antiquaries of London, 1932; also in Tolkien Studies: An Annual Scholarly Review, Vol. 4, 2007 Tolkien's Middle-earth legendarium Shippey thought this \\"a pivotal influence\\" on Tolkien's Middle-earth, combining as it did a god-hero, a ring, dwarves, and a silver hand. The J.R.R. Tolkien Encyclopedia notes also the \\"Hobbit-like appearance of [Dwarf's Hill]'s mine-shaft holes\\", and that Tolkien was extremely interested in the hill's folklore on his stay there, citing Helen Armstrong's comment that the place may have inspired Tolkien's \\"Celebrimbor and the fallen realms of Moria and Eregion\\". The scholar of English literature John M. Bowers notes that the name of the Elven-smith Celebrimbor is the Sindarin for \\"Silver Hand\\", and that \\"Because the place was known locally as Dwarf's Hill and honeycombed with abandoned mines, it naturally suggested itself as background for the Lonely Mountain and the Mines of Moria.\\" Christianity Tolkien was a devout Roman Catholic. He once described The Lord of the Rings to his friend, the English Jesuit Father Robert Murray, as \\"a fundamentally religious and Catholic work, unconsciously so at first, but consciously in the revision.\\" Many theological themes underlie the narrative, including the battle of good versus evil, the triumph of humility over pride, and the activity of grace, as seen with Frodo's pity toward Gollum. In addition the epic includes the themes of death and immortality, mercy and pity, resurrection, salvation, repentance, self- sacrifice, free will, justice, fellowship, authority and healing. Tolkien mentions the Lord's Prayer, especially the line \\"And lead us not into temptation but deliver us from evil\\" in connection with Frodo's struggles against the power of the One Ring. Tolkien said \\"Of course God is in The Lord of the Rings. The period was pre-Christian, but it was a monotheistic world\\", and when questioned who was the One God of Middle-earth, Tolkien replied \\"The one, of course! The book is about the world that God created ‚Äì the actual world of this planet.\\" The Bible and traditional Christian narrative also influenced The Silmarillion. The conflict between Melkor and Eru Il√∫vatar parallels that between Satan and God. Further, The Silmarillion tells of the creation and fall of the Elves, as Genesis tells of the creation and fall of Man. As with all of Tolkien's works, The Silmarillion allows room for later Christian history, and one version of Tolkien's drafts even has Finrod, a character in The Silmarillion, speculating on the necessity of Eru Il√∫vatar's eventual incarnation to save Mankind.Morgoth's Ring, Athrabeth Finrod Ah Andreth, pp. 322, 335 A specifically Christian influence is the notion of the fall of man, which influenced the Ainulindal√´, the Kinslaying at Alqualond√´, and the fall of N√∫menor. Mythology =Germanic= William Morris's Sigurd the Volsung told (in this extract from page 389) of Dwarf-Rings and swords carried by dead kings. Tolkien read it as a student. Tolkien was influenced by Germanic mythology, especially its Norse and Old English forms. During his education at King Edward's School in Birmingham, he read and translated from the Old Norse in his free time. One of his first Norse purchases was the V√∂lsunga saga. While a student, Tolkien read the only available English translation of the V√∂lsunga saga, the 1870 rendering by William Morris of the Victorian Arts and Crafts movement and Icelandic scholar Eir√≠kur Magn√∫sson. The Old Norse V√∂lsunga saga and the Old High German Nibelungenlied were coeval texts made with the use of the same ancient sources.Evans, Johnathan. \\"The Dragon Lore of Middle-earth: Tolkien and Old English and Old Norse Tradition\\". In Both of them provided some of the basis for Richard Wagner's opera series, Der Ring des Nibelungen, featuring in particular a magical but cursed golden ring and a broken sword reforged. In the V√∂lsunga saga, these items are respectively Andvaranaut and Gram, and they correspond broadly to the One Ring and the sword Narsil (reforged as And√∫ril). The V√∂lsunga saga also gives various names found in Tolkien. Tolkien's The Legend of Sigurd and Gudr√∫n discusses the saga in relation to the myth of Sigurd and Gudr√∫n. Tolkien was influenced by Old English poetry, especially Beowulf; Shippey writes that this was \\"obviously\\" the work that had most influence upon him. The dragon Smaug in The Hobbit is closely based on the Beowulf dragon, the points of similarity including its ferocity, its greed for gold, flying by night, having a well- guarded hoard, and being of great age.Shippey's discussion is at ; it is summarized in Tolkien made use of the epic poem in The Lord of the Rings in many ways, including elements like the great hall of Heorot, which appears as Meduseld, the Golden Hall of the Kings of Rohan. The Elf Legolas describes Meduseld in a direct translation of line 311 of Beowulf (l√≠xte se l√©oma ofer landa fela), \\"The light of it shines far over the land\\". The name Meduseld, meaning \\"mead hall\\", is itself from Beowulf. Shippey writes that the whole chapter \\"The King of the Golden Hall\\" is constructed exactly like the section of the poem where the hero and his party approach the King's hall: the visitors are challenged twice; they pile their weapons outside the door; and they hear wise words from the guard, H√°ma, a man who thinks for himself and takes a risk in making his decision. Both societies have a king, and both rule over a free people where, Shippey states, just obeying orders is not enough. Tolkien wrote that he thought of Gandalf as an \\"Odinic Wanderer\\". Odin, the wanderer by Georg von Rosen, 1886 The figure of Gandalf is based on the Norse deity Odin in his incarnation as \\"The Wanderer\\", an old man with one eye, a long white beard, a wide brimmed hat, and a staff. Tolkien wrote in a 1946 letter that he thought of Gandalf as an \\"Odinic wanderer\\". The Balrog and the collapse of the Bridge of Khazad-d√ªm in Moria parallel the fire j√∂tunn Surtr and the foretold destruction of Asgard's bridge, Bifr√∂st. The Valar resemble the √Üsir, the gods of Asgard. Thor, for example, physically the strongest of the gods, can be seen both in Orom√´, who fights the monsters of Melkor, and in Tulkas, the strongest of the Valar. Manw√´, the head of the Valar, has some similarities to Odin, the \\"Allfather\\". The division between the Calaquendi (Elves of Light) and Moriquendi (Elves of Darkness) echoes the Norse division of light elves and dark elves. The light elves of Norse mythology are associated with the gods, much as the Calaquendi are associated with the Valar. Some critics have suggested that The Lord of the Rings was directly derived from Richard Wagner's opera cycle, Der Ring des Nibelungen, whose plot also centres on a powerful ring from Germanic mythology. Others have argued that any similarity is due to the common influence of the V√∂lsunga saga and the Nibelungenlied on both authors. Tolkien sought to dismiss critics' direct comparisons to Wagner, telling his publisher, \\"Both rings were round, and there the resemblance ceases.\\" According to Humphrey Carpenter's biography of Tolkien, the author claimed to hold Wagner's interpretation of the relevant Germanic myths in contempt, even as a young man before reaching university. Some researchers take an intermediate position: that both the authors used the same sources, but that Tolkien was influenced by Wagner's development of the mythology, especially the conception of the Ring as conferring world mastery. Wagner probably developed this element by combining the ring with a magical wand mentioned in the Nibelungenlied that could give to its wearer the control over \\"the race of men\\".. \\"The source for this quality seems to have been a relatively insignificant line from the Nibelungenlied, which says that the Nibelung treasure included a tiny golden wand that could make its possessor the lord of all mankind. \\" Some argue that Tolkien's denial of a Wagnerian influence was an over-reaction to statements about the Ring by √Öke Ohlmarks, Tolkien's Swedish translator.Allan, Jim, Tolkien Language Notes, 1974 Furthermore, some critics believe that Tolkien was reacting against the links between Wagner's work and Nazism. =Finnish= Tolkien may have made use of the Finnish epic poem Kalevala for some Middle-earth characters. Painting The Defense of the Sampo by Akseli Gallen-Kallela, 1896 Tolkien was \\"greatly affected\\" by the Finnish national epic Kalevala, especially the tale of Kullervo, as an influence on Middle-earth. He credited Kullervo's story with being the \\"germ of [his] attempt to write legends\\". He tried to rework the story of Kullervo into a story of his own, and though he never finished, similarities to the story can still be seen in the tale of T√∫rin Turambar. Both are tragic heroes who accidentally commit incest with their sister who on finding out kills herself by leaping into water. Both heroes later kill themselves after asking their sword if it will slay them, which it confirms. Like The Lord of the Rings, the Kalevala centres around a magical item of great power, the Sampo, which bestows great fortune on its owner, but never makes clear its exact nature. Like the One Ring, the Sampo is fought over by forces of good and evil, and is ultimately lost to the world as it is destroyed towards the end of the story. The work's central character, V√§in√§m√∂inen, shares with Gandalf immortal origins and wise nature, and both works end with the character's departure on a ship to lands beyond the mortal world. Tolkien also based elements of his Elvish language Quenya on Finnish. Other critics have identified similarities between V√§in√§m√∂inen and Tom Bombadil. =Greek= Influence from Greek mythology is apparent in the disappearance of the island of N√∫menor, recalling Atlantis. Tolkien's Elvish name \\"Atalant√´\\" for N√∫menor resembles Plato's Atlantis, furthering the illusion that his mythology simply extends the history and mythology of the real world. In his Letters, however, Tolkien described this merely as a \\"curious chance.\\" Greek mythology colours the Valar, who borrow many attributes from the Olympian gods. The Valar, like the Olympians, live in the world, but on a high mountain, separated from mortals; Ulmo, Lord of the Waters, owes much to Poseidon, and Manw√´, the Lord of the Air and King of the Valar, to Zeus. Tolkien compared Beren and L√∫thien with Orpheus and Eurydice, but with the gender roles reversed. Oedipus is mentioned in connection with T√∫rin in the Children of H√∫rin, among other mythological figures: F√´anor has been compared with Prometheus by researchers such as Verlyn Flieger. They share a symbolical and literal association with fire, are both rebels against the gods' decrees and, basically, inventors of artefacts that were sources of light, or vessels to divine flame. =Celtic= The extent of Celtic influence is debatable. Tolkien wrote that he gave the Elvish language Sindarin \\"a linguistic character very like (though not identical with) British-Welsh ... because it seems to fit the rather 'Celtic' type of legends and stories told of its speakers\\". A number of the names of characters and places in The Hobbit and The Lord of the Rings have been found to have Welsh origin. In addition, the depiction of Elves has been described as deriving from Celtic mythology. Though Tolkien wrote of \\"a certain distaste\\" for Celtic legends, \\"largely for their fundamental unreason\\", The Silmarillion may betray some Celtic influence. The exile of the Noldorin Elves, for example, has parallels with the story of the Tuatha D√© Danann. The Tuatha D√© Danann semi-divine beings, invaded Ireland from across the sea, burning their ships when they arrived and fighting a fierce battle with the current inhabitants. The Noldor arrived in Middle-earth from Valinor and burned their ships, then turned to fight Melkor. Another parallel can be seen between the loss of a hand by Maedhros, son of F√´anor, and the similar mutilation suffered by Nuada Airgetl√°m (\\"Silver Hand/Arm\\") during the battle with the Firbolg. Nuada received a hand made of silver to replace the lost one, and his later appellation has the same meaning as the Elvish name Celebrimbor: \\"silver fist\\" or \\"Hand of silver\\" in Sindarin (Telperinquar in Quenya). Other authors, such as Donald O'Brien, Patrick Wynne, Carl Hostetter and Tom Shippey have pointed out similarities between the tale of Beren and L√∫thien in the Silmarillion, and Culhwch and Olwen, a tale in the Welsh Mabinogion. In both, the male heroes make rash promises after having been stricken by the beauty of non-mortal maidens; both enlist the aid of great kings, Arthur and Finrod; both show rings that prove their identities; and both are set impossible tasks that include, directly or indirectly, the hunting and killing of ferocious beasts (the wild boars, Twrch Trwyth and Ysgithrywyn, and the wolf Carcharoth) with the help of a supernatural hound (Cafall and Huan). Both maidens possess such beauty that flowers grow beneath their feet when they come to meet the heroes for the first time, as if they were living embodiments of spring.: \\"The hunting of the great wolf recalls the chase of the boar Twrch Trwyth in the Welsh Mabinogion, while the motif of 'the hand in the wolf's mouth' is one of the most famous parts of the Prose Edda, told of Fenris Wolf and the god T√Ωr; Huan recalls several faithful hounds of legend, Garm, Gelert, Cafall.\\" The Mabinogion was part of the Red Book of Hergest, a source of Welsh Celtic lore, which the Red Book of Westmarch, a supposed source of Hobbit-lore, probably imitates., \\"The Feigned-manuscript Topos\\": \\"The 1849 translation of The Red Book of Hergest by Lady Charlotte Guest (1812‚Äì1895), ... The Mabinogion, ... is now housed in the library at Jesus College, Oxford. Tolkien's well-known love of Welsh suggests that he would have likewise been well-acquainted with the source of Lady Guest's translation. ... Tolkien wanted to write (translate) a mythology for England, and Lady Charlotte Guest's work can easily be said to be a 'mythology for Wales.' The Arthurian legends are part of the Celtic and Welsh cultural heritage. Tolkien denied their influence, but critics have found several parallels. Gandalf has been compared with Merlin, Frodo and Aragorn with Arthur and Galadriel with the Lady of the Lake. Verlyn Flieger has investigated the correlations and Tolkien's creative methods. She points out visible correspondences such as Avalon and Avall√≥n√´, and Broc√©liande and Broceliand, the original name of Beleriand. Tolkien himself said that Frodo's and Bilbo's departure to Tol Eress√´a (also called \\"Avallon\\" in the Legendarium) was an \\"Arthurian ending\\". \\"To Bilbo and Frodo the special grace is granted to go with the Elves they loved ‚Äì an Arthurian ending, in which it is, of course, not made explicit whether this is an 'allegory' of death, or a mode of healing and restoration leading to a return\\" Such correlations are discussed in the posthumously published The Fall of Arthur; a section, \\"The Connection to the Quenta\\", explores Tolkien's use of Arthurian material in The Silmarillion.J. R. R. Tolkien (2013) The Fall of Arthur, HarperCollins. Another parallel is between the tale of Sir Balin and that of T√∫rin Turambar. Though Balin knows he wields an accursed sword, he continues his quest to regain King Arthur's favour. Fate catches up with him when he unwittingly kills his own brother, who mortally wounds him. Turin accidentally kills his friend Beleg with his sword. Review of The Children of H√∫rin. =Slavic= There are a few echoes of Slavic mythology in Tolkien's novels, such as the names of the wizard Radagast and his home at Rhosgobel in Rhovanion; all three appear to be connected with the Slavic god Rodegast, a god of the Sun, war, hospitality, fertility, and harvest.Orr, Robert. Some Slavic Echos in J.R.R. Tolkien's Middle-earth, Germano-Slavica 8 (1994): p. 23‚Äì34. The Anduin, the Sindarin name for The Great River of Rhovanion, may be related to the Danube River, which flows mainly among the Slavic people and played an important role in their folklore.  History  The Battle of the Pelennor Fields towards the end of The Lord of the Rings may have been inspired by a conflict of real- world antiquity. Elizabeth Solopova notes that Tolkien repeatedly referred to a historic account of the Battle of the Catalaunian Fields by Jordanes, and analyses the two battles' similarities. Both battles take place between civilisations of the \\"East\\" and \\"West\\", and like Jordanes, Tolkien describes his battle as one of legendary fame that lasted for several generations. Another apparent similarity is the death of king Theodoric I on the Catalaunian Fields and that of Th√©oden on the Pelennor. Jordanes reports that Theodoric was thrown off by his horse and trampled to death by his own men who charged forward. Th√©oden rallies his men shortly before he falls and is crushed by his horse. And like Theodoric, Th√©oden is carried from the battlefield with his knights weeping and singing for him while the battle still goes on. Modern literature Tolkien was also influenced by more modern literature: Claire Buck, writing in the J.R.R. Tolkien Encyclopedia, explores his literary context, while Dale Nelson in the same work surveys 24 authors whose works are paralleled by elements in Tolkien's writings. Postwar literary figures such as Anthony Burgess, Edwin Muir and Philip Toynbee sneered at The Lord of the Rings, but others like Naomi Mitchison and Iris Murdoch respected the work, and W. H. Auden championed it. Those early critics dismissed Tolkien as non-modernist. Later critics have placed Tolkien closer to the modernist tradition with his emphasis on language and temporality, while his pastoral emphasis is shared with First World War poets and the Georgian movement. Buck suggests that if Tolkien was intending to create a new mythology for England, that would fit the tradition of English post-colonial literature and the many novelists and poets who reflected on the state of modern English society and the nature of Englishness. Tolkien acknowledged a few authors, such as John Buchan and H. Rider Haggard, as writing excellent stories. Tolkien stated that he \\"preferred the lighter contemporary novels\\", such as Buchan's. Critics have detailed resonances between the two authors. Auden compared The Fellowship of the Ring to Buchan's thriller The Thirty-Nine Steps. Nelson states that Tolkien responded rather directly to the \\"mythopoeic and straightforward adventure romance\\" in Haggard. Tolkien wrote that stories about \\"Red Indians\\" were his favourites as a boy. Shippey mentions Tolkien's interest in the primeval forests and people of North America, and speculates that the romantic descriptions of characters in James Fenimore Cooper might have influenced his descriptions of Aragorn and √âomer. When interviewed, the only book Tolkien named as a favourite was Rider Haggard's adventure novel She: \\"I suppose as a boy She interested me as much as anything‚Äîlike the Greek shard of Amyntas [Amenartas], which was the kind of machine by which everything got moving.\\" A supposed facsimile of this potsherd appeared in Haggard's first edition, and the ancient inscription it bore, once translated, led the English characters to Shes ancient kingdom, perhaps influencing the Testament of Isildur in The Lord of the Rings and Tolkien's efforts to produce a realistic-looking page from the Book of Mazarbul. Critics starting with Edwin Muir have found resemblances between Haggard's romances and Tolkien's.Rogers, William N., II; Underwood, Michael R. \\"Gagool and Gollum: Exemplars of Degeneration in King Solomon's Mines and The Hobbit\\". In \\"Frodo Quatermain,\\" \\"Tolkien and Haggard: Immortality,\\" \\"Tolkien and Haggard: The Dead Marshes\\" Saruman's death has been compared to the sudden shrivelling of Ayesha when she steps into the flame of immortality. Verne's Runic Cryptogram from Journey to the Center of the Earth Parallels between The Hobbit and Jules Verne's Journey to the Center of the Earth include a hidden runic message and a celestial alignment that direct the adventurers to the goals of their quests. Tolkien wrote of being impressed as a boy by Samuel Rutherford Crockett's historical fantasy novel The Black Douglas and of using it for the battle with the wargs in The Fellowship of the Ring; critics have suggested other incidents and characters that it may have inspired,Anderson, The Annotated Hobbit (1988), 150 but others have cautioned that the evidence is limited. Tolkien stated that he had read many of Edgar Rice Burroughs' books, but denied that the Barsoom novels influenced his giant spiders such as Shelob and Ungoliant: \\"I developed a dislike for his Tarzan even greater than my distaste for spiders. Spiders I had met long before Burroughs began to write, and I do not think he is in any way responsible for Shelob. At any rate I retain no memory of the Siths or the Apts.\\"Edgar Rice Burroughs: Master of Adventure The Ent attack on Isengard was inspired by \\"Birnam Wood coming to Dunsinane\\" in Shakespeare's Macbeth. Charles Dickens' The Pickwick Papers has likewise been shown to have reflections in Tolkien. \\"The Leaf Mold of Tolkien's Mind\\" A major influence was the Arts and Crafts polymath William Morris. Tolkien wished to imitate the style and content of Morris's prose and poetry romances, and made use of elements such as the Dead Marshes and Mirkwood. Another was the fantasy author George MacDonald, who wrote The Princess and the Goblin. Books by the Inkling author Owen Barfield contributed to his world-view, particularly The Silver Trumpet (1925), History in English Words (1926) and Poetic Diction (1928). Edward Wyke-Smith's Marvellous Land of Snergs, with its \\"table-high\\" title characters, influenced the incidents, themes, and depiction of Hobbits,Anderson, The Annotated Hobbit (1988), 6‚Äì7 as did the character George Babbitt from Babbitt. H. G. Wells's description of the subterranean Morlocks in his 1895 novel The Time Machine parallel Tolkien's account of Gollum. Personal experience =Childhood= Some locations and characters were inspired by Tolkien's childhood in rural Warwickshire, where from 1896 he first lived near Sarehole Mill, and later in Birmingham near Edgbaston Reservoir. There are also hints of the nearby industrial Black Country; he stated that he had based the description of Saruman's industrialization of Isengard and The Shire on that of England.The Lord of the Rings, Foreword: \\"The country in which I lived in childhood was being shabbily destroyed before I was ten\\" The name of Bilbo's Hobbit-hole, \\"Bag End\\", was the real name of the Worcestershire home of Tolkien's aunt Jane Neave in Dormston. Morton wrote an account of his findings for the Tolkien Library. = War = Tolkien stated that his trench warfare experience with his regiment, the Lancashire Fusiliers, on the Western Front influenced his account of the landscape around Mordor. In July 1915, when the United Kingdom was engaged in the First World War, Tolkien was commissioned as a temporary second lieutenant in the Lancashire Fusiliers. Stationed in France, he would later take part in the Battle of the Somme in 1916. The metallic dragons that attack the Elves in the final battle of The Fall of Gondolin are reminiscent of the newly-invented tanks that Tolkien witnessed there. In a 1960 letter, Tolkien wrote that \\"The Dead Marshes [just north of Mordor] and the approaches to the Morannon [an entrance to Mordor] owe something to northern France after the Battle of the Somme\\".The Letters of J. R. R. Tolkien, #226 to Professor L. W. Forster, 31 December 1960 After the publication of The Lord of the Rings there was speculation that the One Ring was an allegory for the nuclear bomb. Tolkien repeatedly insisted that his works were not an allegory of any kind;Tolkien, J. R. R. from Encyclopedia of Science, Technology, and Ethics. Macmillan Reference USA. Cited in he states in the foreword to The Lord of the Rings that he disliked allegories and that the story was not one. Shippey points out, however, that Leaf by Niggle \\"quite certainly\\" was an allegory. In general, Tolkien preferred what he termed \\"applicability\\", the freedom of the reader to interpret the work in the light of his or her own life and times. Tolkien had already completed most of the book, including the ending in its entirety, before the first nuclear bombs were made known to the world at Hiroshima and Nagasaki in August 1945. An article by Manni and Bonechi addresses the influences of the Second World War on The Lord of the Rings. =Inklings= Tolkien was a core member of the Inklings, an informal literary discussion group associated with the University of Oxford between the early 1930s and late 1949. The group shared in Colin Duriez's words \\"a guiding vision of the relationship of imagination and myth to reality and of a Christian worldview in which a pagan spirituality is seen as prefiguring the advent of Christ and the Christian story.\\" Shippey adds that the group was \\"preoccupied\\" with \\"virtuous pagans\\", and that The Lord of the Rings is plainly a tale of such people in the dark past before Christian revelation. He further writes that what Tolkien called the Northern theory of courage, namely that even total defeat does not make what is right wrong, was \\"a vital belief\\" shared by Tolkien and other Inklings. The group considered philosophical issues, too, which found their way into Tolkien's writings, among them the ancient debate within Christianity on the nature of evil. Shippey notes Elrond's Boethian statement that \\"nothing is evil in the beginning. Even [the Dark Lord] Sauron was not so\\",The Fellowship of the Ring, \\"The Council of Elrond\\" in other words all things were created good; but that the Inklings, as evidenced by C. S. Lewis's Mere Christianity, book 2, section 2, to some extent tolerated the Manichean view that Good and Evil are equally powerful, and battle it out in the world. Shippey writes that Tolkien's Ringwraiths embody an Inkling and Boethian idea found in Lewis and Charles Williams, that of things being bent out of shape, the word wraith suggesting \\"writhe\\" and \\"wrath\\", glossed as \\"a twisted emotion\\"; even the world became bent, so men could no longer sail the old straight road westwards to the Undying Lands. All the same, Shippey writes, Tolkien's personal war experience was Manichean: evil seemed at least as powerful as good, and could easily have been victorious, a strand which can also be seen in Middle-earth. At a personal level, Lewis's friendship greatly encouraged Tolkien to keep going with The Lord of the Rings; he wrote that without Lewis \\"I should never have brought The L. of the R. to a conclusion.\\" Notes References Sources        * Category:The Lord of the Rings Category:J.

No person shall address any political or religious meeting in any > public park; but this section shall not be construed to prohibit any > political or religious club or society from visiting any public park in a > body, provided that no public address shall be made under the auspices of > such club or society in such park. Jehovah's Witnesses assembled in Slater Park of Pawtucket for a meeting which at the trial was conceded to be religious in character. About 400 people attended, 150 being Jehovah's Witnesses. Fowler, a Jehovah's Witness minister, was invited to give a talk before the Pawtucket congregation of Jehovah's Witnesses. Fowler accepted the invitation and addressed the meeting in the park over two loud-speakers. It was a quiet, orderly meeting with no disturbances or breaches of the peace whatsoever. Fowler had been talking only a few minutes when he was arrested by the police and charged with violating the ordinance set forth above. He was tried and found guilty over objections that the ordinance as so construed and applied violated the First and the Fourteenth Amendments of the Constitution. He was fined $5.  Prior history  Fowler's conviction was affirmed by the Rhode Island Supreme Court. 80 R.I., 91 A. 2d 27. Also see Fowler v. State, 79 R. I. 16, 83 A. 2d 67, an earlier opinion answering certified questions and holding the ordinance valid. Arguments Davis v. Massachusetts, decided in 1897, sustained a conviction of a man for making a speech on Boston Common in violation of an ordinance that forbade the making of a public address there without a permit from the mayor. Much of the oral argument and most of the briefs presented in Fowler v. Rhode Island were devoted on the one hand to a defense of the Davis case and on the other hand to an attack on it. Analyses of subsequent decisions were submitted by the State of Rhode Island in an effort either to demonstrate that the Davis case was still valid and applicable to this case. Other analyses were submitted by Fowler to argue that it had been so qualified as to no longer to have any vitality. Fowler asked the Court to overrule Davis; the State of Rhode Island asked to have it reaffirmed. It was conceded at the trial that this meeting was a religious one. On oral argument before the Court the Assistant Attorney General further conceded that the ordinance, as construed and applied, did not prohibit church services in the park. Catholics could hold mass in Slater Park and Protestants could conduct their church services there without violating the ordinance. Church services normally entail not only singing, prayer, and other devotionals but preaching as well. Even so, those services would not be barred by the ordinance. Decision Justice Douglas delivered the decision of the Court. In it, he wrote that the Court was putting aside \\"the problems presented by the Davis case and its offspring\\" because there was one aspect of the case that undercut all others, requiring the Court to reverse the judgment and rule in favor of Fowler. Douglas wrote that the concession by the State of Rhode Island that the meeting in question was a religious one and the further concession that the ordinance did not prohibit church services in the park plainly showed that a religious service of Jehovah's Witnesses was treated differently than a religious service of other sects. In the opinion of the Court, that amounted to the state preferring some religious groups over the Jehovah's Witnesses. Justice Douglas cited the precedent of Niemotko v. Maryland in which there was similarly \\"a public park, open to all religious groups, was denied Jehovah's Witnesses because of the dislike which the local officials had of these people and their views.\\" In that case, the Court had held the prosecution of Niemotko to be a discrimination that was prohibited by the First and Fourteenth Amendments. Douglas wrote > it is no business of courts to say that what is a religious practice or > activity for one group is not religion under the protection of the First > Amendment. Nor is it in the competence of courts under our constitutional > scheme to approve, disapprove, classify, regulate, or in any manner control > sermons delivered at religious meetings. Sermons are as much a part of a > religious service as prayers. They cover a wide range and have as great a > diversity as the Bible or other Holy Book from which they commonly take > their texts. To call the words which one minister speaks to his congregation > a sermon, immune from regulation, and the words of another minister an > address, subject to regulation, is merely an indirect way of preferring one > religion over another. That would be precisely the effect here if we > affirmed this conviction in the face of the concession made during oral > argument.

It was released by Stax Records in 1961. It is Bell's signature song and best known recording. Overview The song was written while Bell was in New York, playing with the Phineas Newborn Orchestra, with lyrics that were not inspired by a lost love, but by Bell's own feelings of homesickness. Bell recorded the song upon returning to Memphis, believing that he was making a demo. However, the recording was released as the B-side of the lesser known Bell single \\"Formula of Love\\". It was only after DJ's flipped the record over and began playing the B-side instead of the A-side that sales started to pick up. The song did not chart in the Billboard R&B; charts (southern U.S. records were often either not given enough attention by the chart compilers or lacked the slick production of the more popular Detroit and uptown soul outlets), although it did reach #95 on the pop charts. Since then, the track has gone on to become a Southern soul classic. The song was also released on Bell's 1967 album The Soul of a Bell, along with the original version of \\"Do Right Woman, Do Right Man\\", which was more famously covered by Aretha Franklin. Lyrically, the song's theme revolves around the singer's confession of his unfaithfulness to his lover and, now that she's gone, his realization of his foolishness. Other renditions \\"You Don't Miss Your Water\\" was covered by Otis Redding and released on his critically acclaimed 1965 album, Otis Blue. The Byrds covered the song on their 1968 album, Sweetheart of the Rodeo, with lead vocals sung by guitarist Roger McGuinn, although an alternate version featuring Gram Parsons on lead vocals was released on The Byrds box set in 1990. The song was also covered by Taj Mahal on his 1968 album The Natch'l Blues. Jerry Lee Lewis covered the song in 1972 and did a blues ballad arrangement. In 1965, Stax vocalist Wendy Rene recorded a version of the song, with Bell and Isaac Hayes credited as writers, but with some lyric changes and a re-titling to \\"Reap What You Sow.\\" It was issued on Stax 171. A ska version of the song was recorded by Peter Tosh And The Wailers in 1965. Later a reggae version of \\"You Don't Miss Your Water\\" was recorded by Tosh alone for his 1976 debut album, Legalize It. Tosh was famous for being a founding member of The Wailers, one of the most influential roots reggae bands, along with Bob Marley and Bunny Wailer. His version of the song, which lasts for over six minutes, is highlighted by a guitar solo midway through the track. The lyrics and music were rearranged from the original, William Bell version by Tosh and Wailer. The Good Ol' Persons recorded a bluegrass cover of the song in their 1986 album I Can't Stand to Ramble. Brian Eno covered the song in 1988 for the soundtrack album to the film Married to the Mob. Eno's version is a languid piece, with guitars, harmonized vocals and synthesizers, which makes slight alterations to the lyrics (e.g., changing \\"But now you've left me/Oh, how I cry\\" to \\"But when you left me/Oh, how I cried\\") and replaces the second chorus with a repeat of the first. The Triffids' version \\"You Don't Miss Your Water\\" was also released as a single by the Australian folk rock group, The Triffids. Their version appeared as a 7-inch single and a 12-inch single in August 1985.

She is ordered by her husband, the Green Knight, or Lord Bertilak, to test Sir Gawain's purity. Analysis The lady of the house, Lady Bertilak, is one of the most prominent characters in the poem Sir Gawain and the Green Knight. In company, she always appears with a crone beside her (who later turns out to be Gawain's aunt, Morgan le Fay). The two women bracket feminine vulnerability and strength, in youth and age, and they are always together. The master of the manor (Bertilak) insists that Gawain socialize freely and sit between the two women at their dinners, and Gawain finds them most hospitable. However, she comes alone to Gawain's chambers on three mornings in a row, each time in a more alluring form, with her last appearance being in a simple gown, her hair uncovered, and without cosmetics. Each time, she comes to Gawain's bed around dawn, when Gawain is sleeping, and she plays elaborately witty games of courtship and seduction with him. She is not what would generally be expected from a lady of a household. Her ‚Äúactive sexual role is hardly more representative of romance heroines than of real medieval women.‚ÄùWynne-Davies, pg. 47. Claiming one hundred and twenty two linesWynne- Davies, pg. 46. of speech, she plays a quintessential role in testing Sir Gawain's honour, loyalty, and most importantly his honesty through her sexual innuendoes, where she becomes ‚Äúa potent threat to the exclusively masculine code of knightly behaviour.‚ÄùWynne-Davies, pg. 37. Most interesting about these scenes is the dilemma Sir Gawain faces, where he must be courteous to Lady Bertilak (Knightly Code), and at the same time loyal to his host. The twist occurs when Sir Gawain realizes that Lady Bertilak has been used as a tool of seduction, by her husband, in order to test Sir Gawain. This betrayal leads Sir Gawain to a twenty-one linelines 2407‚Äì2428 ‚Äúattack of all women for their deceptiveness and treachery.‚ÄùWynne-Davies, pg. 38. Her character proves to have an imperative role in the poem, for \\"a full understanding of the temptation scenes\\" is important for a full understanding \\"of the entire poem.\\"Cooke, Jessica. \\"The Lady's 'Blushing' Ring in Sir Gawain and the Green Knight.\\" The Review of English Studies, vol. 49, no. 193, Feb. 1998, pp. 1-8. JSTOR, url: https://www.jstor.org/stable/517999. Accessed 31 Aug. 2017. It is also from Lady Bertilak that Gawain receives the girdle with the power to protect its wearer \\"against anyone who seeks to strike him.\\"Sir Gawain and the Green Knight. The Norton Anthology of English Literature, edited by Stephen Greenblatt, W. W. Norton & Company, 2012, line 1853. In taking that girdle, though, Gawain betrays his deal with the lady's husband, and Gawain vows to keep the girdle forever to remind him of his sin of cowardice. Influence on the poem Lady Bertilak's role throughout the poem is very important due to her efforts to test Sir Gawain's loyalty to Lord Bertilak while staying in his home and under his rule. Lady Bertilak, along with Lord Bertilak and Morgan La Fey, bring Sir Gawain's loyalty in the face of what is acts of sexual advances, ones that are \\"not nearly as reserved and what some would call honorable\\" as said by Emily Spangler.Spangler, pg. 2. Lady Bertilak approaches Sir Gawain three times during his stay, as her desires for him become more blatant and even forceful every time she stays with him. Despite Sir Gawain's attempts to remain reserved, he indulges in Lady Bertilak's advances which results in his slight injury to the Green Knight later on. Lady Bertilak had succeeded in her plot, and because of the lack of malice towards him had been able to make Sir Gawain admit to his imperfections and faults in the end.Spangler, pg. 4. Greed and temptation In the poem Sir Gawain and the Green Knight, greed and temptation are two characteristics that guide Lady Bertilak to trick Gawain. She continuously tempts Gawain to take her belongings by telling him they will protect him. One of the most significant offerings from Lady Bertilak was the ring. Gawain easily refuses this offer even though it is protective, because of its value of wealth.Cooke, pg. 1. Lady Bertilak schemingly makes another offer to Gawain of less value: a green girdle that has protective powers. It is here that Gawain succumbs to her offer, because of the girdle's lesser value.Cooke, pg. 2. Lady Bertilak is aware of Gawain's promise with the lord to hand him anything he receives each day. She plays upon this promise to tempt Gawain with her offerings, because she knows he will not report it to Lord Bertilak, as he will keep the girdle for his battle with the Green Knight.

Despite regular attempts to tempt him overseas he remained in Brisbane until a short venture to Malaysia in 1960 followed by a contract in the United Kingdom saw him move to horseracing Utopia. He settled into the UK racing scene quickly with a win at his first ride in the UK at Aintree on Mix n Match in the Earl of Sefton Plate on 25 March 1961 and the wins soon mounted up. He was successful in the UK and France. A few of the horses he was associated with in the UK are \\"The Pouncer\\", \\"Althrey Don\\", \\"Mountain Call\\", \\"Laureate\\" and \\"Park Top\\".

A probe by the Interior Department‚Äôs Inspector General concluded that Domenech had in 2017 misused his office for personal gain by getting the EPA to hire his son-in-law. Investigators also said that Domenech had used his office to promote another family member's business. Early life and education Born August 5, 1955, in Georgia, Douglas W. Domenech grew up in a military family of Puerto Rican descent and lived in Panama, the Dominican Republic, and the family's native island of Puerto Rico as a child. His father, John Domenech, served in the Army for 30 years and retired as a colonel. Domenech graduated from Antilles High School in Fort Buchanan, Puerto Rico, in 1973 and earned a B.S. in forestry and wildlife management at Virginia Tech in 1978. He is the father of blogger and columnist Ben Domenech, who is married to Meghan McCain, a daughter of the late Senator John McCain. Career Doug Domenech served in the George W.

From 2010 to 2014, Domenech served as Governor Bob McDonnell's Secretary of Natural Resources of the Commonwealth of Virginia, making him the first Hispanic and Puerto Rican person to be appointed to McDonnell's cabinet. Domenech previously worked for the Forest Resources Association. From March 2015, Domenech was director of the Texas Public Policy Foundation's Fueling Freedom Project, which was a project to fight the Environmental Protection Agency's Clean Power Plan. Domenech is the Interior Secretary's representative on the Advisory Committee of the Conservation Trust of Puerto Rico. =Controversy= On April 23, 2019, The Washington Post reported that Domenech was one of six officials being investigated for ethics violations by the Interior Department's Office of Inspector General. Domenech was one of six political appointees of the Trump administration at the Interior Department under investigation for having \\"violated federal ethics rules by engaging with their former employers or clients on department-related business.\\" In 2017 Trump had signed an executive order requiring appointees to recuse themselves for two years on any matters involving their former employers and clients.

Mutations to this gene have been implicated in a number of human cancers, particularly acute myeloid leukaemia.  Discovery  In 1989 a virally encoded portion of the chromosomal mouse Cbl gene was the first member of the Cbl family to be discovered and was named v-Cbl to distinguish it from normal mouse c-Cbl. The virus used in the experiment was a mouse-tropic strain of Murine leukemia virus isolated from the brain of a mouse captured at Lake Casitas, California known as Cas-Br-M, and was found to have excised approximately a third of the original c-Cbl gene from a mouse into which it was injected. Sequencing revealed that the portion carried by the retrovirus encoded a tyrosine kinase binding domain, and that this was the oncogenic form as retroviruses carrying full-length c-Cbl did not induce tumor formation. The resultant transformed retrovirus was found to consistently induce a type of pre-B lymphoma, known as Casitas B-lineage lymphoma, in infected mice.  Structure  Full length c-Cbl has been found to consist of several regions encoding for functionally distinct protein domains: * N-terminal tyrosine kinase binding domain (TKB domain): determines the protein which it can bind to * RING finger domain motif: recruits enzymes involved in ubiquitination * Proline-rich region: the site of interaction between Cbl and cytosolic proteins involved in Cbl's adaptor functions * C-terminal ubiquitin-associated domain (UBA domain): the site of ubiquitin binding This domain structure and the tyrosine and serine-rich content of the protein product is typical of an \\"adaptor molecule\\" used in cell signalling pathways.  Homologues  Three mammalian homologues have been characterized, which all differ in their ability to function as adaptor proteins due to the differing lengths of their C-terminal UBA domains: # c-Cbl: ubiquitously expressed, 906 and 913 amino acids in length in humans and mice respectively # Cbl-b: ubiquitously expressed, 982 amino acids long. # Cbl-c: lacks the UBA domain and is therefore only 474 amino acids in length. It is primarily expressed in epithelial cells however its function is poorly understood. Both c-Cbl and Cbl-b have orthologues in D. melanogaster (D-Cbl) and C. elegans (Sli-1), hinting at a long evolutionary path for these proteins.  Function  = Ubiquitin ligase = Ubiquitination is the process of chemically attaching ubiquitin monomers to a protein, thereby targeting it for degradation. As this is a multi-step process, several different enzymes are involved, the final one being a member of the E3 family of ligases. Cbl functions as an E3 ligase, and therefore is able to catalyse the formation of a covalent bond between ubiquitin and Cbl's protein substrate - typically a receptor tyrosine kinase. The RING-finger domain mediates this transfer, however like other E3 ligases of the RING type no intermediate covalent bond is formed between ubiquitin and the RING-finger domain. The stepwise attachment of ubiquitin to the substrate receptor tyrosine kinase can lead to its removal from the plasma membrane and subsequent trafficking to the lysosome for degradation.

His style was influenced by Umbrian artists Gozzoli and Boccati, two of his first mentors, and continued to evolve as younger Umbrian artists came onto the scene, such as Fiorenzo di Lorenzo, Perugino and Pinturicchio. Although primarily a painter, he is also known for executing missals, restoration work, gilding, armorials, banners and celebratory decorations, which speaks to his decorative, detail- oriented artistic style. His most famous works include Madonna and Saints (1487) for the church of Santa Maria Maddalena at Castiglione del Lago, The Virgin and Child Between Two Praying Angels, and his Adoration of the Shepherds.  Personal life  Caporali was born in the town of Perugia, Italy in 1420. He was from a family of artists, including his brother, Giapeco Caporali, and son, Giovanni Battista Caporali.P. Scarpellini. \\"Caporali.\\" Grove Art Online. Oxford Art Online. Oxford University Press. Web. 21 Feb. 2017 His father was a highly trained soldier and fully armored cavalryman as a ‚Äúman-at-arms‚Äù. Caporali married Brigida di Giovanni Cartolari before 1480 and together they had seven children: three daughters, Candida, Lucrezia, and Laura and four sons, Giovanni, who was also a painter, Ser Camillo, Giampaolo, and Eusebio. According to housing records, he lived in a house in the vicinity of San Martino in Perugia in 1456, which he co-owned with his brother Giapeco.Stanley Lothrop. ‚ÄúBartolomeo Caporali.‚Äù Memoirs of the American Academy in Rome, vol. 1, 1915, pp. 87‚Äì102. In addition to being an artist, Caporali was also highly involved in the politics of Perugia. He was prior of his town, camerlingo to the Company of Illuminators, was elected captain of the people and held leadership positions in the Umbria Painters Guild multiple times throughout his career.Sarti, G (2000.) Early and Mannerist Paintings in Italy (1370-1570). Paris, France: G Sarti Antiques Ltd. His opinion was highly valued in the art community, as he was frequently called upon to estimate the value of other artists‚Äô works. He was known to have an extremely even emotional temperament, and in one instance is described as being ‚Äúphlegmatic‚Äù. His death occurred between 1503 and October 8, 1505, since a document of that date describes his son, a canon of San Lorenzo, as Ser Camillus quondam Bartholomei Caporalis, or ‚Äúof the late Bartolomeo Caporali‚Äù. The last found document that mentions Caporali alive dates from 1503.  Style  Caporali had an artistic style that is best described as chameleon-esque, as he was masterful at absorbing the new techniques, skills and fashions from his contemporaries. Although Caporali's work was best known within Umbria, he constantly collaborated with provincial Renaissance painters in order to learn, network and develop his style. One attribute known about Carporali's work is his acute attention to detail. This can be seen in the particular detailing in his figure's clothes in order to give substance and differentiate between fabrics; his angels‚Äô robes have a velvety thickness, and his Madonnas have complex double drapes painted onto her cloaks. Additionally, his work is known for the gentle facial expressions of his subjects and the peculiar transparency of their facial skin tone. Strong hints of gold in the flesh, large infantile eyes with hard blackish lines under the upper lids, overlong fingers, and sensitive mouths drawn by long parallel brushstrokes are all details that define his work. As with most Renaissance painters, Caporali's style transformed throughout his career as he was introduced and influenced by various artists. This pattern often relied upon which artists traveled and worked in Umbria, as well as younger, more talented contemporaries from Perugia that he learned and borrowed from. These artists included Gozzoli, Boccati, Benozzo, Bonfigli, Perugino, Fiorenzo di Lorenzo, and Pintoricchio. In his last works in particular, Caporali began strictly producing work related to the impersonal mass of religious Umbrian paintings which were inspired by Pintoricchio. The quality of his work severely declined with age, to the point at which his hand is almost unrecognizable in his last paintings. Enthroned Madonna and Child with Four Angels  Training and early works  Little is known about Caporali's training, however there are two men that undoubtedly influenced his artistic career. Many art historians claim that he studied under Benozzo Gozzoli, whose influences are seen in many of Caporali's earlier works. However, according to official records, Gozzoli didn't travel to Umbria until Caporali was about 30 years old. Others claim Caporali to be the student of Giovanni Boccati, however there is the same chronological issue, as Boccati didn't live in Perugia until 1445. Therefore, it is not known who first introduced Caporali or his brother to the art of painting. However, most art historians attribute the majority of Caporali's training to Gozzoli. The Annunciation, a joint work by Caporali and Bonfigli The earliest documentary record of Bartolomeo Caporali is his matriculation in the Guild of Painters at Perugia in the year 1442. Additionally, in the late 15th century, an important local school of painting developed in Perugia, its principal exponents including Benedetto Bonfigli, Bartolomeo Caporali, Fiorenzo di Lorenzo, Bernadro Pinturicchio and later the great Perugino. Although he collaborated with all of these artists, Caporali worked particularly closely with Bonfigli during the beginning of their careers. In fact, modern art historians have trouble discerning between their early works due to their strong resemblances in technique, most likely because they were educated under like influences, if not the same master. Following their father's death in 1452, Bartolomeo and his brother renounced their inheritance and moved to Porta Eburnea. It is here that the first record of Bartolomeo's work appears in 1454 when he paints a Maesta and a Pieta for the Palazzo dei Priori in the Udienza dei Calzolari. This commission resulted in his attaining the status of an independent and highly regarded master. From this point forward Bartolomeo received many commissions and expanded his network by collaborating on projects with celebrated artists such as Giapeco, Boccati and Bonfigli. His willingness to collaborate as well as master new techniques and skills in order to reach broader markets speaks to his talent as a networker and businessman. However, most works of this early period in his career are not documented, and it is difficult to pinpoint with whom he collaborated with on the work that can be identified as his.  Notable works  One of his first major works was The Virgin and Child Between Two Praying Angels. Made around 1450, this painting is on panel with tempura, oil and gold ground, and is in good condition. The linear drawing and complex treatment in the folds of the clothes call to Bonfigli's work, indicating that he and Caporali had a professional relationship far before their first known collaboration in 1467. Additionally, this work distinguishes itself because of the angels‚Äô placement on an upper register, implying depth. By the second half of the 1460s, Bartolomeo seemed to have solidified his place as a master in Italy. This is due to the increased documentation and preservation of his works from this period in both Perugia and Rome. While continuing to make painted and gilded objects for the municipality of Perugia and the abbey of San Pietro in order to make a steady income, Bartolomeo also worked on his more famous commissions. One such work is the Assumption of the Virgin in the Monastery of Santa Giuliana, Perugia. Completed in 1469, it is a monumental fresco with a light-toned composition distinguished with rich, elegant formal fabrics on the angels and the Virgin. It was very successful due to its ‚Äúrefined compositional archaisms in harmony with the older decorations of [the abbey]‚Äù, and represents Caporali's ability to incorporate new techniques and styles successfully within older spaces. Painted Crucifix The Caporali Missal is notable for several reasons. First, it was a decorated religious book containing the texts of mass, which is unlike most of the projects Bartolomeo worked on. Second, this missal in particular was a joint project with his brother, Giapeco. This missal was executed for the Franciscan convent of San Francesco, Montone near Perugia, an all-male convent that's remains still exist today. The missal itself was completed in 1469. Third, it survives complete with all of its four hundred folios in extremely good condition. The most prominent decoration of the missal is assigned to three full-page illuminations. Compared to other missals in this period, the Caporali missal was spectacularly decorative. His Virgin and Child with Six Angels appears to be the first picture painted in oils in this town, an honor which until discovered had been bestowed by Vasari to Perugino. Madonna del Fanciullo His Adoration of the Shepherds (1477‚Äì79) represents his ability to exhibit learned skills from mentors and experiment in new mediums. The use of oil paint allowed him to pay greater attention to details through the use of new calligraphic tools, a skill he picked up from Bernardino Pintoricchio, who spent time in Bartolomeo's workshop a few years earlier. Around this same time, Bartolomeo's brother, Giacomo, died in 1478. Subsequently, he was appointed to complete Giacomo's term of office as treasurer of the Guild of Miniaturists. During his time in this position, he painted a miniature representing the Annunciation in the choral books of the Monastery of San Pietro at Perugia. In the 1480s, Bartolomeo shifted towards the ‚Äúgentle style‚Äù developed by Perugino on the walls of the Sistine Chapel and brought it to Perugia. One work that exemplifies this is his Madonna of the Windowsill, completed in 1484 and commissioned by the Alessandri family and Perugian jurists. His assistant at the time was Lattazino di Giovanni, who is thought to have worked alongside him during this period.  Legacy and significance  Art historians differ on the degree of Caporali's influence to Renaissance painting. While Fliegel sees him as a major influencer on objectively greater Umbrian artists such as Fiorenzo di Lorenzo and Perugino, others find Caporali's contemporary Bonfigli to be his superior and assume the role of influencer in the Umbrian region during this period. As Van Marle wrote, ‚ÄúWhen he did not have a more provincial artist to learn from, he had a tendency to descend to an almost provincial level.‚Äù Van Marle, Raimond. \\"The Development of the Italian Schools of Painting: Volume XIV.\\" (1933). However, few documented works of lesser-known Renaissance artists like Caporali's survive. As a result, there has been a tendency to grant attributions around the few recognizable artistic personalities of the period, when in fact they could belong to lesser-known masters such as Caporali. In the case of Caporali, one paper claims that the Giustizia triptych and the National Gallery altarpiece are likely his work and Sante di Apollonio, instead of Fiorenzo di Lorenzo's, to whom it is currently attributed. It would reveal the use of ideas from Paduan and Marchigian sources within pictorial structures that reference the work of Benozzo Gozzoli, combined with a determined effort to master the style of Perugino.Bury, Michael. ‚ÄúBartolomeo Caporali: A New Document and Its Implications.‚Äù The Burlington Magazine, vol. 132, no. 1048, 1990, pp. 469‚Äì475., www.jstor.org/stable/884276. Its significance is that there may be more works of art during this period attributed to the greats that may belong to lesser-known Renaissance painters.

Synopsis Doc starred Barnard Hughes as Dr. Joe Bogert, an elderly, kind-hearted general practitioner who divided his time between dealing with his dysfunctional patients and his even more dysfunctional family. Hughes had been seen occasionally on the CBS-TV sitcoms All in the Family as Father John Majeski and on The Bob Newhart Show as Bob's father Herb Hartley. On Doc, actress Elizabeth Wilson co-starred with Hughes as Joe's wife Annie, Judith Kahan as his daughter Laurie, John Harkins as Laurie's husband, and Mary Wickes as Joe's nurse, Tully. During the first season, the show had good ratings, partially due to its timeslot (Saturdays at 8:30 p.m., sandwiched between mega-hits The Jeffersons and The Mary Tyler Moore Show). CBS however thought the ratings should be better considering the scheduling and ordered the show to be reworked. When it returned in the fall of 1976, the format had been substantially changed, with Dr. Bogert now a widower, working at a down and out city clinic. Mary Wickes was the only other cast member from the first season to remain, but she departed after the first episode. Ratings slipped and the series was canceled in October 1976 after five episodes. Shortly after the series ended, Hughes returned to The Bob Newhart Show to guest star in a Christmas episode in December, 1976.

Born in Manhattan, New York, he attended the Ethical Culture schools and undertook additional studies through the Columbia University Extension School. He studied piano with Ernest Hutcheson and composition with Rubin Goldmark at the Juilliard School of Music before proceeding to the Curtis Institute of Music in Philadelphia where he undertook further piano studies with J√≥zef Hofmann. In 1931 he studied music analysis with Sir Donald Tovey in London. Chasins' career as a pianist lasted from 1927 until 1947. He gave many solo recitals and performed with major orchestras in the United States, Canada, South America and Europe. On January 1, 1929, he made his debut playing his Piano Concerto No 1 with the Philadelphia Orchestra conducted by Ossip Gabrilowitsch. He also gave the premiere performance of his Second Piano Concerto in March 1933, again with the Philadelphia Orchestra, this time conducted by Leopold Stokowski. From 1926 to 1935 Chasins taught piano as a member of the faculty of the Curtis Institute. He was associated with the radio station WQXR from 1941 to 1965, becoming the music director in 1946. His own radio series, \\"Piano Pointers\\", ran from 1932 to 1939 and he used his E flat minor Prelude as the program's theme. In 1949 he married Constance Keene, a pianist and former student of his, with whom he performed and recorded piano duos. In 1972 he joined the University of Southern California as musician-in-residence, and reorganized the student-run radio station KUSC into a channel for classical and modern music. He retired in 1977, and died of cancer at his home in Manhattan on June 21, 1987. Chasins wrote over 100 compositions, mostly for the piano.

He is the author of Becoming Animal: An Earthly Cosmology (2010) and The Spell of the Sensuous: Perception and Language in a More-than-Human World (1996), for which he received the Lannan Literary Award for Nonfiction. Abram is founder and creative director of the Alliance for Wild Ethics (AWE); his essays on the cultural causes and consequences of ecological disarray have appeared often in such journals as the online magazine Emergence, Orion, Environmental Ethics, Parabola, Tikkun and The Ecologist, as well as in numerous academic anthologies.See the papers and essays by Abram published on Academia.edu. In 1996 Abram coined the phrase \\"the more-than-human world\\" as a way of referring to earthly nature (introducing it in the subtitle of The Spell of the Sensuous and throughout the text of that book); the term was gradually adopted by other scholars, theorists, and activists, and has become a key phrase within the lingua franca of the broad ecological movement.See, for example, its use within many papers in the Journal of Environmental Humanities, or the centrality of the phrase for recent textbooks such as Ecological Ethics: An Introduction by Patrick Curry (Polity, 2011) or Invisible Nature: Healing the Destructive Divide between People and the Environment, by Kenneth Worthy (Prometheus Books, 2013), or many more recent works like Being Salmon, Being Human by Martin Lee Mueller (Chelsea Green, 2017), Kabbalah and Ecology: God's Image In The More-Than-Human World by David Mevoroch Seidenberg (Cambridge University Press, 2016), Being Together in Place: Indigenous Coexistence in a More Than Human World by Soren C. Larsen and Jay T. Johnson (University of Minnesota Press, 2017), Participatory Research in More-than-Human Worlds edited by Michelle Bastian, Owain Jones, et al. (Routledge, 2016), \\"Locative Texts for Sensing the More‚ÄìThan‚ÄìHuman\\" by Alinta Krauth (Electronic Book Review: Digital Futures of Literature, Theory, Criticism, and the Arts; May 2020) and innumerable other papers and books. In recent writings, Abram sometimes refers to the more-than-human world as \\"the commonwealth of breath.\\" See Abram's afterword for Material Ecocriticism, edited by Serenella Iovino and Serpil Oppermann (Indiana University Press, 2014) Abram was the first contemporary philosopher to advocate a reappraisal of \\"animism\\" as a complexly nuanced and uniquely viable worldview ‚Äî one which roots human cognition in the sensitive and sentient human body, while affirming the ongoing entanglement of our bodily experience with the uncanny sentience of other animals (each of which encounters the same world that we perceive yet from an outrageously different angle and perspective). A close student of the traditional ecological knowledge systems of diverse indigenous peoples, Abram articulates the entwinement of human subjectivity not only with other animals but with the varied sensitivities of the many plants upon which humans depend, as well as our cognitive entanglement with the collective sensitivity and sentience of the particular earthly places ‚Äî the bioregions (or ecosystems) ‚Äî that surround and sustain our communities. In recent years his work has come to be closely associated both with the \\"new animism,\\" and with a broad movement loosely termed \\"New Materialism,\\" due to Abram's espousal of a radically transformed sense of matter and materiality.See, for example Material Ecocriticism, edited by Serenella Iovino and Serpil Oppermann (Indiana University Press, 2014), Jeffrey Jerome Cohen, Stone: An Ecology of the Inhuman (University of Minnesota Press, 2015) Life and early influences Born in the suburbs of New York City, Abram began practicing sleight-of-hand magic during his high school years in Baldwin, Long Island; it was this craft that sparked his ongoing fascination with perception. In 1976, he began working as \\"house magician\\" at Alice's Restaurant in the Berkshires of Massachusetts and soon was performing at clubs throughout New England while studying at Wesleyan University. After his second year of college, Abram took a year off to travel as an itinerant street magician through Europe and the Middle East; toward the end of that journey, in London, he began exploring the application of sleight- of-hand magic to psychotherapy under the guidance of Dr. R. D. Laing. After graduating summa cum laude from Wesleyan in 1980, Abram traveled throughout Southeast Asia as an itinerant magician, living and studying with traditional, indigenous magic practitioners (or medicine persons) in Sri Lanka, Indonesia, and Nepal. Upon returning to North America he continued performing while devoting himself to the study of natural history and ethno-ecology, visiting and learning from native communities in the Southwest desert and the Pacific Northwest. A much-reprinted essay written while studying ecology at the Yale School of Forestry in 1984 ‚Äî entitled \\"The Perceptual Implications of Gaia\\" ‚Äî brought Abram into association with the scientists formulating the Gaia Hypothesis; he was soon lecturing in tandem with biologist Lynn Margulis and geochemist James Lovelock both in Britain and the United States. In the late 1980s, Abram turned his attention to exploring the decisive influence of language upon the human senses and upon our sensory experience of the land around us. Abram received a doctorate for this work from the State University of New York at Stony Brook, in 1993. Work Abram's writing is informed by his studies among indigenous peoples in Indonesia, Nepal, and the Americas, as well as by the American nature-writing tradition that stems from Henry David Thoreau, Walt Whitman, and Mary Austin. His philosophical work is informed by the European tradition of phenomenology ‚Äî especially by the writings of the French phenomenologist, Maurice Merleau-Ponty. Abram's evolving work has also been influenced by his friendships with the archetypal psychologist James Hillman, the iconoclastic evolutionary biologist Lynn Margulis, and the social critic and radical historian Ivan Illich ‚Äî as well as by his esteem for the American poet Gary Snyder and the agrarian novelist, poet, and essayist Wendell Berry. Writing in the mid-nineteen nineties, and finding himself frustrated by the problematic terminology of environmentalism (dismayed by the longstanding conceptual gulf between humankind and the rest of nature tacitly implied by the use of conventional terms like \\"environment\\" and even by the word \\"nature\\" itself, which is so often contrasted with \\"culture\\" as though there were a neat divide between the two), Abram coined the phrase \\"the more- than-human world\\" in order to signify the broad commonwealth of earthly life, a realm that manifestly includes humankind and its culture, but which also necessarily exceeds human culture. The phrase was intended, first and foremost, to indicate that the space of human culture was a subset within a larger set ‚Äî that the human world was necessarily sustained, surrounded, and permeated by the more-than-human world ‚Äî yet by the phrase Abram also meant to encourage a new humility on the part of humankind (since the \\"more\\" could be taken not just in a quantitative but also in a qualitative sense). Upon introducing the phrase as the central term for \\"nature\\" in his 1996 book The Spell of the Sensuous (subtitled Perception and Language in a More-than-Human World), the phrase was gradually adopted by many other theorists and activists, soon becoming an inescapable term within the broad ecological movement. The publication of The Spell of the Sensuous proved to be catalytic for the formation and consolidation of several new disciplines, especially the burgeoning field of ecopsychology (both as a theoretical discipline and as therapeutic practice), as well as ecophenomenology and ecolinguistics. Already translated into numerous languages, the first French translation of the text was completed by the eminent Belgian philosopher-of-science, Isabelle Stengers, in 2013.Stengers did the first full translation, which then was honed by her colleague, the Belgian bioregionalist and artist Didier Demorcey, and was published in France as \\"Comment la terre s'est tue: Pour une √©cologie des sens (La D√©couverte, 2013). Since 1996, Abram has lectured and taught at universities throughout the world, while nonetheless maintaining his independence from the institutional world of academe. He was named by the Utne Reader as one of a hundred visionaries currently transforming the world,See \\"100 Visionaries,\\" Utne Reader, Jan/Feb 1995; and \\"The Loose Canon: 150 Great Works to Set Your Imagination On Fire,\\" Utne Reader, May/June 1998. and profiled in the 2007 book, Visionaries: The 20th Century's 100 Most Inspirational Leaders. His ideas have often been debated (sometimes heatedly) within the pages of various peer-reviewed academic journals, including Environmental Ethics, Environmental Values and the Journal of Environmental PhilosophySee, for example, Ted Toadvine, \\"Limits of the Flesh: The Role of Reflection in David Abram's Ecophenomenology\\" and David Abram, \\"Between the Body and the Breathing Earth: A Reply to Ted Toadvine\\" in Environmental Ethics, summer 2005 issue. See also Eleanor D. Helms, \\"Language and Responsibility\\" in the Spring 2008 issue of Environmental Philosophy.

In 2001, the New England Aquarium and the Orion Society sponsored a large public debate between Abram and distinguished biologist E. O. Wilson, at the old Town Hall in Boston, on science and ethics. (An essay by Abram that grew out of that debate, entitled \\"Earth in Eclipse,\\" has been published in several versions.) In the summer of 2005, Abram delivered a keynote address for the United Nations \\"World Environment Week\\" in San Francisco, to 70 mayors from the largest cities around the world.See \\"United Nations Keynote\\" on the website of the Alliance for Wild Ethics: https://wildethics.org/united- nations-keynote/ Retrieved 2018-05-18. In 2006, Abram‚Äîtogether with biologist Stephan Harding, ecopsychologist Per Espen Stoknes, and environmental educator Per Ingvar Haukeland‚Äîfounded the non-profit Alliance for Wild Ethics (AWE), for which he serves as Creative Director. According to their website, the Alliance is \\"a consortium of individuals and organizations working to ease the spreading devastation of the animate earth through a rapid transformation of culture. We employ the arts, often in tandem with the natural sciences, to provoke deeply felt shifts in the human experience of nature. Motivated by a love for the more-than-human collective of life, and for human life as an integral part of that wider collective, we work to revitalize local, face-to- face community ‚Äì and to integrate our communities perceptually, practically, and imaginatively into the earthly bioregions that surround and support them.\\"https://wildethics.org/the-alliance/ Retrieved 2020-07-04. In 2010 Abram published Becoming Animal: An Earthly Cosmology, which was the sole runner-up for the inaugural PEN Edward O. Wilson Award for Literary Science Writing, and a finalist for the 2011 Orion Book Award. A review in Orion by Potowatami elder, Robin Wall Kimmerer described the book thus: \\"Prose as lush as a moss-draped rain forest and as luminous as a high desert night... Deeply resonant with Indigenous ways of knowing, Becoming Animal lets us listen in on wordless conversations with ancient boulders, walruses, birds, and roof beams. His profound recognition of intelligences other than our own enables us to enter into reciprocal symbioses that can in turn, sustain the world. Becoming Animal illuminates a way forward in restoring relationship with the earth, led by our vibrant animal beings to re-inhabit the glittering world,\\" while in the UK, a review in the journal Resurgence said: \\"David Abram is a true magician, superbly skilled in both sleight-of-hand magic and the literary art of awakening us to the superabundant wonders of the natural world. He is one of America's greatest Nature writers... The language is luminous, the style hypnotic. Abram weaves a spell that brings the world alive before your very eyes.\\" In 2014 Abram held the international Arne N√¶ss Chair of Global Justice and Ecology at the University of Oslo, in Norway. In that same year he became a distinguished Fellow of Schumacher College, where he teaches regularly. He also teaches a weeklong intensive each summer on Cortes Island, in British Columbia. Abram lives with his family in the foothills of the southern Rockies.

Rugby Union career =Amateur career= Cunningham came to note as a rugby player when he played for Oxford University RFC while a student. He was selected for the 1907 Varsity Match against Cambridge, winning the first of three sporting caps. Cunningham played at half-back, partnering Rupert Williamson, and the agility and quick thinking of both players allowed the good scrummaging play by Oxford to release the backs. Oxford won, scoring five tries to nil.Marshall (1951), pg 121-123. Although out of favour with the Scottish team at the end of the 1908 Home Nations, Cunningham was back in the Oxford University team in the 1908 Varsity Match. Partnered again with Williamson, who was also made an international in 1908, after being selected for England. Cunningham and Williamson had another excellent game, and Cunningham set up Oxford's only try after he drew out the defence to allow Martin to score.Marshall (1951), pg 125. At the end of 1909 Home Nations, Cunningham played in his final Varsity Game for Oxford. In the build-up to the match Oxford were on good form, losing just three matches, and it was noted that Cunningham was absent from the side in each of these loses.Marshall (1951), pg 126. The Varsity Game was an extremely heavy win for Oxford, and was known as \\"Poulton's Match\\", after Ronald Poulton who scored five of Oxfords' nine tries.Marshall (1951), pg 129-130. =Provincial career= Cunningham was selected for the Anglo-Scots District side in 1906. An emphatic victory over the South of Scotland District led Cunningham to be capped for the Cities District side against a Rest of Scotland Provinces side in early 1907. =International career= The next year Cunningham was selected for the Scottish national team, and played in the 1908 Home Nations Championship whilst still a student at Oxford. His first cap was an away game to Wales at Swansea. Partnered with Louis Greig in his favoured half-back position, Cunningham ended on the losing side after a narrow 6-5 win by the Welsh. The Scottish selectors kept faith with Cunningham and Greig for the next game of the campaign, against Ireland, but both men were dropped for the final game of the tournament after a second loss. The next season Cunningham was back in the Scotland team and played in the first game of the 1909 Home Nations Championship, again facing Wales. Cunningham scored his first international points in the game against Wales, with a penalty goal. This score was the only points for Scotland that game, and they lost 3-5. Cunningham missed the next game to Ireland, but was back in the team for the final game of the Championship, his first Calcutta Cup encounter with England. Cunningham was given the Scotland captaincy for the England match, and he spearheaded the Scotland team to a convincing win.Griffiths (1987), pg 2:16. During the England game, Cunningham converted three of the four Scottish tries. Cunningham retained the captaincy of Scotland for the 1910 Championship, which was now known as the Five Nations Championship with the inclusion of France. Cunningham led the team in a win over France, but then was unavailable against Wales. When he returned for the Ireland game, he led his country for the third time and his third win as captain. His winning streak was broken by his final captaincy match, the final game of the 1910 campaign, against England. Cunningham played just one more match for Scotland, now playing club rugby for London Scottish, a loss to England in 1911. No longer captain, Cunningham was moved to centre, and despite one final conversion for his team, he never represented his country again. Civil service career Cunningham joined the Indian Civil Service in 1911 and was awarded an OBE in 1921, KCIE in 1935 and GCIE in 1945.Provinces of Pakistan since 1947 Cunningham served as the governor of the North-West Frontier Province three times, twice during the British RajProvinces of British India and once after the creation of the Dominion of Pakistan. After his second term ending in 1946, Cunningham returned to Britain. However, he was invited by the colonial government in July 1947 to return and resume the office at the request of Pakistan's incoming governor general Muhammad Ali Jinnah. He is said to have agreed reluctantly, taking office on 15 August 1947. The North- West Frontier Province was at that time governed by a ministry belonging to the Indian National Congress. Jinnah amended the operative constitution, the 1935 Government of India Act, in order to be able to dismiss the ministry. Cunningham was unsure of the constitutionality of the measure, but he went along with Jinnah's wishes. A Muslim League ministry headed by Abdul Qayyum Khan was appointed on 23 August. In the subsequent months, the Pakistani tribal invasion of Kashmir was carried out under the nose of Cunningham, orchestrated by the provincial premier Abdul Qayyum Khan. Cunningham thought it was going to be disastrous and tried to stop it. But he fell in line after the accession of Kashmir to India, when Jinnah ordered his governors to enter into \\"the full spirit of the struggle\\". The tribesmen not only looted and pillaged property, but they also abducted women and sold them off to brothels. Cunningham regretted that the Pakistan government was permitting this and was evidently demoralised. His diary entry states, \\"I could have found half a dozen excellent grounds for resigning in the last two weeks or so, but I feel that we may be able to get the thing gradually under control again and that one must try to see it through.\\" References Bibliography Category:Indian Civil Service (British India) officers Category:Knights Grand Commander of the Order of the Indian Empire Category:Knights Commander of the Order of the Star of India Category:Officers of the Order of the British Empire Category:1888 births Category:1963 deaths Category:British expatriates in Pakistan Category:Scottish rugby union players Category:Scotland international rugby union players Category:Oxford University RFC players Category:London Scottish F.C. players Category:Rugby union fly-halves Category:Rectors of the University of St Andrews Category:People educated at Fettes College Category:People from Broughty Ferry Category:Governors of Khyber Pakhtunkhwa Category:Rugby union players from Dundee Category:Scottish Exiles District players Category:Cities District players ","title":"George Cunningham (civil servant)"},{"id":"14029701","text":"Operation Riviresa (Operation Sunrays), was a combined military operation launched by the Sri Lankan Armed Forces in Jaffna. Starting on 17 October 1995, the primary objective of the operation was the capture of the city of Jaffna and rest of the Jaffna peninsula from the LTTE (the Liberation Tigers of Tamil Eelam, better known as the Tamil Tigers). It is believed that Operation Riviresa was the largest and most successful military operation in Sri Lankan Armed Forces during the Third Eelam War. Background Preparations for the offensive began with the resumption of hostilities after peace talks failed following the LTTE attack on the Trincomalee naval base. The administration of President Chandrika Kumaratunga ordered active military operations against the LTTE following this attack. Planning and preparations for the operation were conducted by Major General (later General) Rohan Daluwatte who was overall Operations Commander, and under the purview of Lieutenant Colonel (later General) Anuruddha Ratwatte who was the deputy- minister of Defense. Planning for the operation started in June 1993 under the Command of Major General Gamunu Kulatunge, who directed Col. Lucky Rajasinghe to plan the operation, assisted by Col. Mohan Rockwood as a response to the assassination of President Ranasinghe Premadasa by the LTTE on 1 May 1993. Although the Sri Lanka Army was keen on launching an operation to capture Jaffna, the then Prime Minister, Ranil Wickramasinghe, was against the operation. As he was not sure about the armed forces capabilities to sustain the thrust and to prevent further alienating the Tamil population. The Tiger high-command, knowing that plans were afoot to capture the City of Jaffna, launched a pre-emptive strike on Sri Lanka Army and Navy positions in the Kilali area and tried to overrun their positions at Poonaryn on 11th November 1993. Though there were major losses at Poonaryn, the Sri Lankan Military fought back to retain the isolated military camp with some determined tactical battles at all levels (Commanded by Lt. Colonel Ranjith De Silva). On the same night, 52 ‚ÄòBlack Tigers‚Äô, elite commandos of LTTE tried to infiltrate Palaly airbase by sea to destroy the aircraft and was discovered and thwarted by 1st Field Engineer Regiment troops (Commanded by Lt. Colonel Lucky Rajasinghe SLE and Major Lakshman David SLE), killing all 53 LTTE combatants. This left Palaly, Elephant Pass, Poonaryn and Kayts areas, leaving the rest of the area in Jaffna Peninsula to the Tigers. Since the main staging area for the attack was in Palaly, a small scale operation, code-named Operation Leap Forward (Planned and conducted by Major General Srilal Weerasooriya and Colonel Hiran Halangoda), was launched to expand the perimeter of the air base prior to Operation Riviresa expanding the holding area west of Karainagar. Operation Riviresa Campaign Services Medal Operation Thunder Strike, a preliminary action to further enlarge the required staging area to the east, was launched on 28 September 1995. 532 Brigade, under the command of Colonel Lucky Rajasinghe, was tasked with the capture of the Achchuweli area. They were supported by the rest of 53 Division's resources commanded by Brigadier Janaka Perera. As 53 Division was consolidating in the Achchuweli area on the night of 31 October, the LTTE launched a major counter-attack on the division's positions. As the attack was anticipated by Brigadier Janaka Perera, it was repelled by troops of the 53 Division, which resulted in a large number of casualties for the LTTE. This was the key moment of the battle as this loss demoralized the LTTE cadres and SL Army troops realized the vulnerability of the LTTE tactical operations, boosting their morale. Operation RIVIRESA-I was launched on 17 October 1995 with the aim of wresting control of the Valikamam area of the Jaffna peninsula. Major General (later General) Rohan Daluwatte and Brigadier (later Major General) Janaka Perera were two key military personnel who were instrumental in the leadership and success of the operation. 20,000 troops of the Sri Lanka Army were deployed at the outset of the attack, they were supported by the Sri Lanka Air Force and the Sri Lanka Navy. The operation, commanded by Major General Rohan Daluwatte as Overall Operations Commander (OOC), involved three divisions. The 51st Division, commanded by Brigadier (Later Major General) Neil Dias and deputy commander Brigadier (later Field Marshal) Sarath Fonseka and the 52nd Division, commanded by Brigadier (later Major General) P.A. Karunathilaka and deputy commander Brigadier (later Major General) Anton Wijendra, advanced astride the Jaffna - Point Pedro and Jaffna - Palaly Road axes respectively up to a line joining Kopay and Kondavil. This advance was met with stiff resistance from the LTTE. It took the two divisions almost a month to cover the 12-mile stretch. From this lateral line, the 53rd Division, consisting of Special Forces commanded by Brigadier Janaka Perera and deputy commander Colonel (later Major General) Gamini Hettiarachchi broke out and launched a narrow frontal attack that headed directly to the east of Jaffna town, capturing key crossroads along the way. The 53rd Division consisted of the 534 Independent Brigade (commanded by Colonel Percy Fernando), 531 Air Mobile Brigade (commanded by Colonel Hiran Halangoda), 533 Armored Brigade (commanded by Colonel Gamini Balsooriya) and 532 Infantry Brigade (commanded by Colonel Lucky Rajasinghe). The LTTE had prepared for the attack in advance by mining all roads into the peninsula and creating defenses in depth with additional cadres from the eastern province. 531 Brigade met with stiff resistance on 18 November, but managed to maneuver the troops east to avoid the heavily mined built-up areas. On 19 November 534 Brigade stepped into the attack and fought one of the hardest battles as they moved to cut off the main road linking Jaffna from the rest of the peninsula. Brigadier Janaka Perera ordered the 532 Infantry Brigade into action without giving the LTTE an opportunity to regroup and the said brigade, fighting through some of fierce battels and reached the waters of Colombuthurai on 20 November 1995, cutting off Valikamam from the Vadamarachchi and Tenamarachchi areas. However, an intense battle still had to be fought to evict the remaining cadres from Jaffna town. Battle for Jaffna On 29 November 1995, 53 Division, commanded By Brigadier Janaka Perera launched an assault on the LTTE positions guarding Jaffna town. Brigadier Perera decided to commence the operation on a narrow front to minimize civilian casualties. He launched the 532 Infantry Brigade, (commanded by Colonel Lucky Rajasinghe), from the east to penetrate and probe the defenses held by the LTTE. As the brigade ran into a tight LTTE defense on Navalar Road. Colonel Lucky Rajasinghe ordered a 'turning movement' from the north, moving around the LTTE defenses and capturing the Nallur Area. Brigadier Janaka Perera, seizing the gap created by the infantry brigade, simultaneously launched the air-mobile 531 Brigade (commanded by Colonel Hiran Halangoda), to capture Jaffna Fort. At the same time the independent 534 Brigade (commanded by Colonel Percy Fernando), set-out along the east coast to capture the Jaffna Jetty. With three brigades attacking simultaneously from three different sides, the LTTE was unable to coordinate their defenses effectively. By the evening of 1 December, three brigades had breached the LTTE defenses, causing confusion. During the night of 1 December, LTTE cadres were taking advantage of the darkness, escaping in boats across Kilali Lagoon and abandoning the city's defenses. On the morning of 2 December 1995, following an intense 50-day battle, troops of 53 Division entered Jaffna city almost un-opposed. =Aftermath= Political leadership against the advice of military planners, expected the LTTE to collapse after the loss of Jaffna city. But the LTTE fell back to gain time to re-group and was back in little time more fierce than ever. Unfortunately for Sri Lanka, five of the brigade commanders who mattered the most were lost within the next year - three were killed in battle and two left the Army, disgruntled by dissatisfied planning by the political and military leadership. SL Forces were unable to hold on to the subsequent gains (Navatkuli to Killinochchi from North and Vavuniya to Mankulum from the South), made into the LTTE areas beyond the immediate vicinity of Jaffna City. Political leadership continued to drive the military leadership (against the advice of the military commanders), to stretch their forces beyond the practical limits of defense as they continued to believe that the LTTE would collapse after the fall of Jaffna City. The whole concept of the conduct of operations changed from the ‚Äòexecution of political (National) aims planned and conducted by military leadership' to political leaders stepping in to the shoes of military commanders in their determination to gain popularity (with the objective of destroying the LTTE), by sacrificing the long term political and military objective of 'winning the hearts and minds of the Tamil population'.

Plot The Varden attack the Empire city of Belatona. In the battle, Saphira, Eragon's dragon, is nearly killed by a Dauthdaert, a spear from the Dragon Wars that can bypass magical wards and kill dragons. Belatona is captured by the Varden, and an alliance is later formed between the Varden and the werecats. Afterwards, Eragon's cousin Roran is sent on a mission to capture Aroughs, which he succeeds at using unconventional tactics. Roran rejoins the Varden at Dras- Leona, which proves difficult to take, as it is under protection by Murtagh and his dragon Thorn. Jeod finds information about an incomplete sewer system under the city, which should provide access to it. Eragon, Arya, Angela, the werecat Solembum, and an elf named Wyrden enter this sewer system, to sneak into the city and open the gates for the Varden. However, the mission goes awry, as the tunnels are used by the priests of Helgrind, who separate the group, slay Wyrden, and capture Eragon and Arya. The priests worship the Ra'zac, and attempt to feed Eragon and Arya to Ra'zac hatchlings, although Angela and Solembum save them. Eragon is then able to open the city gates and defeat Murtagh and Thorn, allowing the Varden to take control of the city. As Eragon and Arya become drunk to celebrate their victory, Murtagh and Thorn attack their camp and capture Nasuada. In her absence, Eragon is appointed as the leader of the Varden, as they march on to Ur√ª'baen, the capital of the Empire. Eragon struggles under the weight of command, and recalls Solembum's previous advice, instructing him to journey to the Rock of Kuthian and open the Vault of Souls. As nobody has knowledge of the Rock of Kuthian, he questions Solembum, discovering that he had given the advice on instinct. During the conversation, Solembum appears to be possessed, giving Eragon. He discovers the Rock of Kuthian is located on Vroengard Island, and protected by magic which causes everyone, barring himself and Saphira, to forget about it upon hearing of it. He manages to inform Arya and Glaedr of this, and decides to journey to Vroengard. Glaedr joins Eragon and Saphira, while Arya stays behind and helps trick the Varden into thinking Eragon is still with them. Upon reaching the island, Eragon and Saphira find the Rock of Kuthian and learn that they must speak their true names in order to enter the Vault of Souls. Eventually, they find their true names and gain entry. Inside, they find a hoard of Eldunar√≠ and dragon eggs, hidden away before Galbatorix destroyed the Riders. Umaroth, the dragon of the former leader of the Riders, who leads the Eldunar√≠, decides to join Eragon and the Varden to overthrow Galbatorix. Leaving some Eldunar√≠ behind to guard the eggs in the event of their defeat, Eragon and the others leave Vroengard, losing their memories of the Vault. They make their way to Ur√ª'baen, under siege by the combined forces of the Varden, elves, werecats, Urgals and dwarves. Eragon reveals the Eldunar√≠ to the leaders of the forces, and they plan an attack on the city. The combined forces of the Varden attack Ur√ª'baen while Eragon, Saphira, Arya, Elva, and elven spellcasters break into Galbatorix's citadel. They make their way to the throne room after progressing through a series of traps, during which the spellcasters are captured. In the throne room, Galbatorix easily subdues Eragon, Saphira, Arya, and Elva and informs them that he has learned the true name of the ancient language, referred to as the Word. With the Word, he is able to control the usage of magic with the ancient language, negating any spells they attempt, while possessing more Eldunar√≠. To amuse himself, he orders Murtagh and Eragon to fight using only their swords. Eragon defeats Murtagh, and persuades him to join his side. Murtagh, who had developed feelings for Nasuada in her captivity, has his true name changed, and turns on Galbatorix, using the Word to strip him of his wards. Enraged, Galbatorix incapacitates Murtagh, and battles Eragon, while Saphira and Thorn battle his dragon Shruikan. Using the Eldunar√≠, Eragon casts a spell to make Galbatorix experience the pain and suffering that he has caused, while Arya kills Shruikan with the Dauthdaert. Overwhelmed with Eragon's spell, Galbatorix uses magic to destroy himself, also destroying most of the citadel. Eragon, using the Eldunar√≠, is able to protect those in the citadel. To heal from their ordeal, Murtagh and Thorn decide to journey far away, teaching Eragon the Word before departing. Nasuada becomes the High Queen of Human Alaga√´sia and King Orrin of Surda grudgingly pledges his allegiance to her. Arya returns to Du Weldenvarden to help choose a new queen for the elves after the death of her mother, Queen Islanzad√≠, in battle. She takes with her the remaining dragon egg, which hatches for her, and she names the dragon F√≠rnen. She is also chosen to be queen of the elves. Eragon realizes that there is no safe place to raise the dragons and train new Riders in Alaga√´sia. He thus decides to sail away with the Eldunar√≠ and the eggs to a region far east of Alaga√´sia. Eragon reworks the magic of the pact between Riders and dragons to allow dwarves and Urgals to become Riders. He leaves two eggs in Alaga√´sia: one is to be sent to the dwarves, and the other to the Urgals. The future Riders will travel to Eragon's new home for training, while new eggs will be periodically sent back to Alaga√´sia. Eragon and Saphira sadly say their farewells to their friends and family, but look forward to the future. Critical reception Inheritance debuted at No. 1 on the USA Today's \\"Best-Selling Books\\" list, selling nearly half a million copies on the first day in the United States. On Goodreads, it has a score of 4.01 out of 5, as of October 1, 2018. The book received mixed reviews. Joshua Hill of Book Fantasy Review wrote that Inheritance was an improvement over previous books in the series and praised the characters of Roran, Arya, and Murtagh as \\"three of the most interesting characters I‚Äôve ever had the pleasure to read\\". However, Hill criticized the plot for being overly reliant on magic and the ending as being too similar to the final three chapters of The Lord of the Rings. Washington Post's Yvonne Zipp noted that, although the book is marketed to young adults, certain content may be too violent for younger readers, such as the scenes in which Nasuada is tortured and Arya's hand is degloved while trying to escape from shackles. Some reviews criticized the novel for being overly detailed and leaving unresolved plot threads. Shelby Scoffield of Deseret News called the book \\"a sophisticated novel\\" and \\"a sense of closure to a truly great series\\", but criticized Paolini's use of \\"long and boring details\\". Richard Marcus of the Seattle PI said that \\"Paolini clutters up the book with page upon page of battles that could just as easily taken place off stage\\" and that \\"the last hundred or so pages of the book are spent in a very awkward attempt to tie up all the loose ends\\". He also says that, \\"In fact by wasting so much time on insignificant details along the way, the final confrontation with Galbatorix when it comes feels rushed. Even worse, discovering the location of the Rock of Kuthian and the Vault of Souls feels incredibly contrived.\\"  References   External links  Category:2011 American novels Category:2011 fantasy novels Category:Inheritance Cycle Category:Novels by Christopher Paolini ","title":"Inheritance (Paolini novel)"},{"id":"14029802","text":"The Riviresa Campaign Services Medal (Sinhala: ‡∂ª‡∑í‡∑Ä‡∑í‡∂ª‡∑ê‡∑É ‡∂∏‡∑ô‡∑Ñ‡∑ô‡∂∫‡∑î‡∂∏‡∑ä ‡∂¥‡∂Ø‡∂ö‡∑ä‡∂ö‡∂∏ rivir√¶sa meheyum padakkama) was a campaign medal presented to all ranks of the regular and volunteer forces of the Military of Sri Lanka, Sri Lanka Police, as well as civilians that were involved in planning or assisting Operation Riviresa (17 October 1995 - 5 December 1995), one of the most notable successes of the Sri Lankan forces during Eelam War III.

Fiol spent a considerable part of his life in Poland, particularly Krak√≥w, the capital of the Polish Kingdom at the time. The city was famous for its university. The burgeoning of the arts and sciences contributed to the early emergence of book printing here: as early as 1473-1477 there was a print shop in Krak√≥w, which published numerous theological works. Fiol worked as a mining engineer and jeweler, and then took over a print shop. It is this print shop, owned by Fiol, which first published in Cyrillic such religious books as Eastern Slavic editions of Horologion, Octoechos, and the two Triodi. The very first book printed in Cyrillic script, Oktoikh (Octoechos), was published by Fiol in 1491 in Krak√≥w.Treasures of the National Library - Moscow, retrieved on November 3, 2007. Printing machine created by Johannes Gutenberg, which had been used by Fiol Biography The exact date of his birth is unknown. He was born in Neustadt an der Aisch in Franconia. He moved to Krak√≥w in 1479 and was soon enrolled in a department of Goldsmiths. He worked as a gold embroiderer ().–ú–∞—Å—Ç–µ—Ä–∞ perlenhaftir –≤—ã—à–∏–≤–∞–ª–∏ —Ç–∫–∞–Ω–∏ –∑–æ–ª–æ—Ç–æ–º –∏ —Å–µ—Ä–µ–±—Ä–æ–º –∏ —É–∫—Ä–∞—à–∞–ª–∏ –∏—Ö –¥—Ä–∞–≥–æ—Ü–µ–Ω–Ω—ã–º–∏ –∫–∞–º–Ω—è–º–∏–ì–∞–ª–µ–Ω—á–∞–Ω–∫–∞ –ì. –§—ñ—ë–ª—å // –í—è–ª—ñ–∫–∞–µ –ö–Ω—è—Å—Ç–≤–∞ –õ—ñ—Ç–æ—û—Å–∫–∞–µ. ‚Äî –¢. 2: –ö–∞–¥—ç—Ü–∫—ñ –∫–æ—Ä–ø—É—Å ‚Äî –Ø—Ü–∫–µ–≤—ñ—á. ‚Äî –ú—ñ–Ω—Å–∫: –ë–µ–ª–∞—Ä—É—Å–∫–∞—è –≠–Ω—Ü—ã–∫–ª–∞–ø–µ–¥—ã—è —ñ–º—è –ü.–ë—Ä–æ—û–∫—ñ, 2005. ‚Äî 788 —Å.: —ñ–ª. ‚Äî —Å. 702. . On March 9, 1489, the King of Poland and Grand Duke of Lithuania Casimir issued Fiol the privilege to the invention of a machine for pumping water from mines. The invention has been under interest of a wealthy merchant and banker John Thurzo (1437-1508), who owned a number of mines, including the lead mines in Olkusz. Subsequently, Thurzo, with the Krak√≥w patrician Jan Teshnarom had sponsored Fiol's printing house. To start printing it was necessary to cut out the appropriate Cyrillic script. On October 26, 1489 Fiol signed a contract with Karbesom Jacob, who pledged to \\"engrave letters and adjust font Russian.\\" At the same time, he went to Nuremberg, probably in order to make punches and matrices for the subsequent embossing. Documentary evidence about Fiol referred to on September 18, 1490: Fiol accused Johann and Nikolaus Svedlera of Neuburg of the theft of paper kept in his workshop in Krak√≥w. Later, in turn, they filed for Fiola to court for libel. However, evidences was not provided by Fiol, but he said he saw the theft with his own eyes. The court's decision in this case was unknown. The final version of the Cyrillic script and some of the letters commissioned by Fiol was cut out by student of Krak√≥w University, Rudolf Borsdorf from Braunschweig who quickly supplied Fiol with 230 completely finished and adjusted letters and superscript icons (Ludolfus Ludolfi de Brunszwyczk). We also know that Rudolph pledged not to make such fonts for anyone else, even for himself, and not teach how to make them, as Fiol did not want to let someone else print Church Slavonic books. –Ü—Å–∞—î–≤–∏—á –Ø. –ü–æ—á–∞—Ç–∫–∏ –∫–∏—Ä–∏–ª–∏—á–Ω–æ–≥–æ –¥—Ä—É–∫–∞—Ä—Å—Ç–≤–∞ // –£–∫—Ä–∞—ó–Ω—Å—å–∫–µ –∫–Ω–∏–≥–æ–≤–∏–¥–∞–Ω–Ω—è: –≤–∏—Ç–æ–∫–∏, —Ä–æ–∑–≤–∏—Ç–æ–∫, –ø—Ä–æ–±–ª–µ–º–∏. ‚Äî –õ—å–≤—ñ–≤: –Ü–Ω—Å—Ç–∏—Ç—É—Ç —É–∫—Ä–∞—ó–Ω–æ–∑–Ω–∞–≤—Å—Ç–≤–∞ —ñ–º. –Ü. –ö—Ä–∏–ø‚Äô—è–∫–µ–≤–∏—á–∞ –ù–ê–ù –£–∫—Ä–∞—ó–Ω–∏, 2002. ‚Äî 520 —Å. ‚Äî —Å. 88-91 Famous German poet and humanist Conrad Celtis, lived in the years 1489-1491 in Krak√≥w, and in his works, supported Fiols' publishing. In July 1491 Fiol pleaded with Mr. Otto for money. His printing of Eastern Slavic Orthodox books led him into conflict with the Catholic Church authorities in Krak√≥w. The book printer was arrested at the start of November 1491 under a fabricated charge of Hussite heresy. He was released on November 21, with a bail of 1000 gulden and a guaranty by two affluent Krak√≥w citizens. He was arrested again in the beginning of 1492. First Slavonic script On January 13, 1492, the Archbishop of Gniezno had recommended him to refrain from sharing and printing Ruthenian books. Fiol was released in June 1492. He was found not guilty, but had to sign a document stating that he would cease his printing of Cyrillic books. Afterwards he discontinued his work as a printer and left Krak√≥w. From 1502 Fiol lived in Reichenstein, and later moved to the town of Levoca, where he was mining. In his last years he resided in Krak√≥w, living on a pension granted to him by the Thurzo family. Schweipolt Fiol died at the end of 1525 or early 1526. Fiol was married to a Polish woman, Ma≈Çgorzata, the eldest daughter of a Krak√≥w butcher Miko≈Çaj Lubczyca. Since Ma≈Çgorzata is not mentioned in the will from May 7, 1525, we can assume that either she died before or at this point, they were divorced. Printing in Poland Printing in Poland began in the late 15th century, when following the creation of the Gutenberg Bible in 1455, printers from Western Europe spread the new craft abroad. The Polish capital at the time was in Krak√≥w, where scholars, artists and merchants from Western Europe had already been present. Other cities which were part of the Polish kingdom followed later. Cities of northern Polish province of Royal Prussia,Daniel Stone,A History of East Central Europe, University of Washington Press, 2001, p. 30, Google Books like the Hanseatic League city of Danzig (Gda≈Ñsk), had established printing houses early on. The first printing shop was possibly opened in Krak√≥w by Augsburg-based G√ºnther Zainer in 1465. In 1491, Schweipolt Fiol printed the first book in Cyrillic script. The next recorded printing shop was a Dutch one known by the name Typographus Sermonum Papae Leonis I. that might have been established in 1473 on Polish territory, but its exact location has yet to be determined.[Wieslaw Wydra, \\"Die ersten in polnischer Sprache gedruckten Texte, 1475‚Äì1520\\", Gutenberg-Jahrbuch, Vol. 62 (1987), pp.88‚Äì94 (88)] The oldest known print from Poland is considered to be the Almanach cracoviense ad annum 1474 (Cracovian Almanac for the Year 1474) which is a single-sheet astronomical wall calendar for the year 1474 printed and published in 1473 by Kasper Straube.Davies, Norman (2005). \\"Anjou: The Hungarian Connection\\". God's Playground: A History of Poland in Two Volumes. Vol. I. Oxford: Oxford University Press. p. 118. . The only surviving copy of the Almanach cracoviense measures 37 cm by 26.2 cm, and is in the collection of the Jagiellonian University. Other well known early printers in Poland were: * Hieronymus Vietor from Silesia who worked in Vienna and Krak√≥w * Printers from the Szafenberg family * Florian Ungler In the late 16th century there were 7 printing shops in Krak√≥w, and in 1610 ten printing shops. A decline started in around 1615 leaving only three secular printing shops in 1650, accompanied by a few ecclesial ones. Only one printing shop is recorded in Warszawa in 1707, owned by the Piarists. This situation improved during the realm of the last Polish king, Stanis≈Çaw August Poniatowski, which marked a political and cultural revival in Poland. Unfortunately his attempts to reform the state led to the Partitions of Poland carried out by Prussia, Austria and Russia. Printing technology The world's first movable type printing technology was invented and developed in China by the Han Chinese printer Bi Sheng between the years 1041 and 1048. In the West, the invention of an improved movable type mechanical printing technology in Europe is credited to the German printer Johannes Gutenberg in 1450.The invention of typography‚ÄîGutenberg (1450?) The exact date of Gutenberg's press is debated based on existing screw presses. Gutenberg, a goldsmith by profession, developed a printing system by both adapting existing technologies and making inventions of his own. His newly devised hand mould made possible the rapid creation of metal movable type in large quantities Johannes Gutenberg's work on the printing press began in approximately 1436 when he partnered with Andreas Dritzehn‚Äîa man he had previously instructed in gem-cutting‚Äîand Andreas Heilmann, owner of a paper mill.[Meggs, Philip B. A History of Graphic Design. John Wiley & Sons, Inc. 1998. (pp 58‚Äì69) ] However, it was not until a 1439 lawsuit against Gutenberg that an official record exists; witnesses' testimony discussed Gutenberg's types, an inventory of metals (including lead), and his type molds. Having previously worked as a professional goldsmith, Gutenberg made skillful use of the knowledge of metals he had learned as a craftsman. He was the first to make type from an alloy of lead, tin, and antimony, which was critical for producing durable type that produced high-quality printed books and proved to be much better suited for printing than all other known materials. To create these lead types, Gutenberg used what is considered one of his most ingenious inventions, [38] a special matrix enabling the quick and precise molding of new type blocks from a uniform template. His type case is estimated to have contained around 290 separate letter boxes, most of which were required for special characters, ligatures, punctuation marks, etc.[Mahnke, Helmut (2009), Der kunstreiche Johannes Gutenberg und die Fr√ºhzeit der Druckkunst, Norderstedt: Books on Demand, ] Gutenberg is also credited with the introduction of an oil-based ink which was more durable than the previously used water-based inks. As printing material he used both paper and vellum (high-quality parchment). In the Gutenberg Bible, Gutenberg made a trial of coloured printing for a few of the page headings, present only in some copies.[Kapr, Albert (1996), Johannes Gutenberg. The Man and his Invention, Aldershot: Scolar, ] A later work, the Mainz Psalter of 1453, presumably designed by Gutenberg but published under the imprint of his successors Johann Fust and Peter Sch√∂ffer, had elaborate red and blue printed initials. Publishing activities It happened that the Eastern Slavic Cyrillic printing house was founded not on the territory of one of Eastern Slavic countries, and in the capital and the largest economic center of the then Kingdom of Poland - Krak√≥w, which at that time was home to many Ukrainian and Belarusians. There at the end of the 15th century, came the first four books printed in Cyrillic Church Slavonic. Two of them - the Book of Hours and Osmoglasnik (Octoechos) - are marked on the end-of-print in Crakow in 1491 by Schweipolt Fiol. Thus, the printed script Lenten Triodion (in one of its copies, it is not output) and Pentecostarion (the page with the symbol names Fiol is preserved only in the copy that was recently discovered in the city of Bra»ôov). The first page of Octoechos The last page of Octoechos. Visible on the top picture are two capital letter from both sides \\"S\\" and \\"V\\", that could be mean Schweipolt Viol Scientists assume that customers, who ordered printing liturgical texts, have been associated with the Metropolitan of Kiev and all Rus' or one of its dioceses.

The holding capacity of the facility is 1,400 male and female inmates. The St. Louis County Jail is a direct-supervision facility that detains adults and juveniles being tried as adults who are awaiting trial or serving county sentences and is the only jail in Missouri that holds an accreditation known as the ALDF from the American Correctional Association (ACA).Saint Louis County - Department of Justice Services - Jail Opened in March 1998, the center replaced both the jail in the 1949 St. Louis County Courthouse building and the Adult Correctional Building in Chesterfield, Missouri.ST The center was rededicated the \\"Buzz Westfall Justice Center\\" in 2004. History \\"Buzz Westfall Justice Center\\", January 2009 St. Louis City and St. Louis County separated in 1876 and left the county at its current size of . After Clayton, Missouri was chosen as the permanent county seat, a courthouse and jail were built in December 1878. By 1945, a bond issue allowed for the construction of a new courthouse and jail in Clayton facing Forsyth Boulevard that was completed in 1949. A new state law allowed for jail facilities to be located outside of the county seat of Clayton. Because land costs in Clayton were considered prohibitive, the new Adult Correctional Institution was built in 1969 in Gumbo, a historical community which was located in present-day Chesterfield, Missouri approximately to the west. Continued jail overcrowding and deterioration of the remaining jail facilities in Chesterfield created pressure for new correctional facilities. In choosing a site for new facilities the costs and difficulties of continually transporting prisoners between jail facilities in far west County and court facilities in Clayton weighed in favor of a Clayton site for a new jail and expanded court facilities. The new Justice Center (which includes the St. Louis County Jail) opened in 1998 and is connected to the Courts Building by a secure skywalk, replacing both the jail in the 1949 Courthouse building and the Adult Correctional Building in Chesterfield. The justice center was rededicated the \\"Buzz Westfall Justice Center\\" in 2004. George \\"Buzz\\" Westfall was the St. Louis County Executive from 1990 to October 2003 when he died after developing a staph infection. Physical description The jail has a total of 960 cells, with a capacity for 1,400 inmates, in overcrowded conditions. The Justice Center has nine levels, though some of those floors serve the jail administration, Prosecutors office, Public Defenders office, County Police Fingerprint Unit, Fugitive section and some Public Works offices. Each floor that houses inmates has a capacity of 301 inmates. Furthermore, each floor of the jail is divided into four units with 48 cells in each unit. The cells in St. Louis County Jail do not have bars, instead the floor plan is laid out in a dormitory fashion. At the front of the housing unit, referred to as a \\"pod\\", there is a sally port door, with an inner and outer door. The outer door is controlled by a permanent staff member who mans a desk in the convergence area of the floor. The inner sally port is controlled by the housing unit officer. Once through the doors, the room opens up into a double tiered great-room. Near the sally port is the table area where inmates may use their rec time to play games. It also serves as their dining location. Beyond that is a TV area lined with plastic recliners. The inmates are provided with two flat-screen TV's to watch any number of channels provided to them. Near the rear of the pod is the officer's podium; a cinder block half-wall with a desk embedded into it. The officer must never be far from the podium as it contains their computer and the control panel which unlocks the doors in the pod. Direct supervision The St. Louis County Jail uses a direct-supervision management philosophy in the main inmate housing areas. This style, unlike the traditional linear jail style, places correction officers directly within the inmate living units and provides the officers with immediate visual observation and continual interaction with the inmates. It also places the officer in a more vulnerable position, as the inmates are allowed nearly unrestricted access to the officer. All officers are issued pepper spray to carry on their person while in the housing unit. They are also issued a Personal Duress Alarm, which immediately sounds an alarm in the master control unit. A call is then made via radio to all available units to assist the officer in distress. Response times as well as the number of staff responding varies, as there is usually no more than 2 extra officers per floor and a maximum of 4 operating internal elevators. Visitation policy Inmates are allowed up to two visits within any continuous seven-day period and no more than one visit per day. Visiting hours run from 10:00 am through 8:00 pm Monday through Sunday. Visiting periods are forty minutes long and begin promptly on the hour. Due to space limitations, an acceptable combination of visitors may include: two (2) adults; two (2) adults and one (1) child; or one (1) adult and two (2) children. Low-cut blouses, mini-skirts, short shorts and transparent or sheer clothing are strictly prohibited. Male visitors must wear shirts with sleeves. No \\"muscle shirts\\" are allowed. STL County offers CHOICES and AA. The jail also offers GED classes and testing, as well as religious services of varying denominations.

Totsuka died on July 10, 2008 from colorectal cancer. His doctoral advisor - the Nobel Prize winning physicist Masatoshi Koshiba was told that if Totsuka can extend his lifespan by eighteen months, he must receive the prize.ÊñáËóùÊò•Áßã2008Âπ¥9ÊúàÂè∑.  Early life  Totsuka was born March 6, 1942 in Fuji, Shizuoka Prefecture. He completed his B.S. in 1965, his M.S. in 1967 and his Ph.D. in 1972 from the University of Tokyo.  Academic career  Totsuka became a Research Associate at the University of Tokyo in 1972, followed by seven years at Deutsches Electron Synchrotron (DESY) in Germany, where he investigated electron‚Äìpositron collisions. Subsequently, he became an Associate Professor of the University of Tokyo from 1979 to 1987. In 1987, he was promoted to full Professor at the University of Tokyo. He later became the Director of the Kamioka Observatory, part of the Institute for Cosmic Ray Research (ICRR) at the University of Tokyo in 1995 and then Director of the Institute for Cosmic Ray Research in 1997. In 2003, Totsuka became the Director General of the High Energy Accelerator Research Organization (KEK).  Research  with Michael Witherell (August 15, 2003) Totsuka's career in neutrino physics began following his time at DESY, when he began working as part of the Kamiokande experiment with Nobel prize winner Masatoshi Koshiba. The experiment, though designed to detect proton decay, actually ended up successfully measuring the first and so far only neutrinos from a cosmogenic source on Earth, from SN 1987A, along with the Irvine‚ÄìMichigan‚ÄìBrookhaven (IMB) detector in the US. The success of Kamiokande, through Totsuka's leadership, led to the funding of a substantially larger water Cherenkov detector in 1991, the storied Super- Kamiokande (Super-K) detector, which is still an active international collaboration. It was at Super-K that the first definitive evidence for neutrino oscillations was measured, via a high-statistics, high-precision measurement of the atmospheric neutrino flux. Super-K also confirmed, along with the Sudbury Neutrino Observatory (SNO), the solution to the solar neutrino problem. The measurement of neutrino oscillations at such a high level of precision was a critical chapter in the history of particle physics. Neutrino oscillations, and thus the existence of neutrino mass, are not a prediction made by the Standard Model of particle physics. Indeed, the Standard Model requires that neutrinos are massless. Totsuka's experiment provided incontrovertible evidence that there is still much about particle physics yet to be understood. For the remainder of his time as a physicist, as the Director General at KEK, he oversaw successful the K2K experiment and the Belle B-meson \\"factory\\".  Personal life  When he left physics, towards the end of his life, Totsuka turned his attention to communicating with the Japanese public about his illness, science, and culture. He maintained a blog, The Fourth Three-Months, where he candidly discussed the extent, progress, and treatment of his cancer. Totsuka also revealed an interest in gardening, particularly the flowers in the area where he spent much of his career, in Mozumi, the village where Super-K is located.

Metal alloys used in building include bronze (mainly copper and tin); brass (copper and zinc); monel metal and nickel silver, mainly consisting of nickel and copper; and stainless steel, with important components of nickel and chromium.  Metal types  = Lead = The low melting point of lead permitted its use on a wide scale throughout human history. Lead was one of the first to be made into sheet metal for architectural purposes. Water pipes were frequently constructed of lead, until its health hazards were publicised in the late 19th century. Lead is not subject to rust and has been a popular roofing material for centuries, being used for roofing, flashing, gutters, downspouts, and conductor heads. Lead was best suited for low-pitched roofs, as steep roofs experienced creep. Lead roofs in regions with large temperature fluctuations, such as the mid-Atlantic states, experienced deterioration from constant expansion and contraction, called fatigue. Beginning in the 19th century, a roofing material called ‚Äúterne‚Äù or ‚Äúterneplate‚Äù was used, consisting of sheet iron or sheet steel coated with a lead-tin alloy. It is frequently confused with tinplate.Gayle & Waite (1980), pp 8-11. Lead came was also frequently used for window panes in skylights and stained glass. It was also used for small pieces of sculpture and garden ornamentation. Lead was frequently added to paint, with red lead used as an anti-corrosive pigment for iron, and white lead used as paint for wooden houses. Lead-based paint was one of the most durable materials developed as a protective exterior coating. The use of lead paint has been restricted on most buildings, due to concerns of lead poisoning. = Tin = Tin is too soft to be used by itself for architectural purposes so it generally falls into two categories: the alloying of tin with other metals such as copper to form bronze, and the coating of tin on harder metals, such as tinplated iron or steel. Architectural bronzes usually contain about 90% copper and 10% tin, although the content may vary widely. The term ‚Äútin ceiling‚Äù is a misnomer and early manufacturers did not use the name. However, persons who worked with sheet metal were called tinsmiths, so the term could have sprung from this title. Tinplate was a type of architectural material consisting of sheet iron or steel coated with tin. ‚ÄúTin roofs,‚Äù a type of tinplate, was originally used for armor but eventually as a roofing material. Tinplate was also used for decoration, such as ornamental windows, door lintels and stamped ceilings. Ornamental stamped metal made from tinplate was an affordable alternative to plasterwork. Although tinplate is still available today for ceilings, roofing and flashing, it is generally considered expensive since the initial cost is more than that for common modern roofing types such as asphalt shingles or built-up roofs. A well-maintained tinplate roof or ceiling typically lasts several times longer than modern materials, and is more economical when the longer lifespan is taken into account.Gayle & Waite (1980), pp 12-13. = Zinc = Pure zinc was used for roofing in Belgium, France and Germany, where it replaced more expensive copper and lead in roofing. Starting in the 1820s, Belgian sheet zinc was imported in America, used by builders in New York City and elsewhere. Pure zinc is subject to creep at ordinary temperatures. Zinc-coated metals were first patented in 1837, separately by M. Sorel in France and H. W. Crawford in England. The methods employed a ‚Äúhot dipping‚Äù process to coat sheet iron with zinc. By 1839 ‚Äúgalvanized‚Äù sheet iron roofing was being used in New York City. The Merchant's Exchange in Manhattan was one of the first buildings to have both a galvanized roof and galvanized gutters. Some galvanized sheet roofing was pressed with designs, a popular technique in the Victorian era.Gayle & Waite (1980), pp 15-21. Zinc was also cast for sculptures and decorative elements in Germany and Austria as early as 1832. Decorative architectural elements were frequently cast in zinc, since it molded readily, was inexpensive compared to stone, and could be painted to imitate more expensive metals. Stamped swags, rosettes, fleur-de-lis and acanthus leaves provided popular decorative ornamentation of both exteriors and interiors by the late 19th century. Zinc oxide paints were nontoxic and resistant to pollution. They became commercially successful and readily available in America in about 1850 and used widely starting around the 1870s. They had the added benefit of being good rust inhibitors on iron and steel. During the early decades of the 20th century, the use of pure zinc roofing and ornament decreased in use in the US. It is now gaining popularity in its pure form (99.95%)for building materials. Typically, architectural grade zinc is 99.995 percent pure zinc with trace amounts of titanium, to reduce coefficient of thermal expansion and improve tensile strength and hardness, and copper to improve workability. Exact alloy composition is subject to manufacturer and is a color determinant in zinc's final patina. Over time, zinc develops its distinctive patina, transforming from a shiny silver to a matte bluish-grey. Pre patinated finishes are available from certain manufacturers to expedite the natural patination process. Zinc is still used in alloys such as brass and nickel silver, and in the electroplating of steel as well. Today, galvanized steel and pure zinc material, usually Double Locked Standing Seam panels, are used for roofing a variety of buildings. Creep has been reduced by the introduction of titanium in most architectural zinc available in North America. Galvanized nails and sheet metal ducts are also common. Architectural grade zinc is 90 to 95% recycled. Replacement costs are negligible with a long lifetime of 80 to 100 years for zinc roofing and 200 to 300 years for wall systems. This long-life durability is a key component in durability. At the end of its service life, zinc building products can be recycled indefinitely without loss to chemical or physical properties. The use of architectural grade zinc can help building qualify for LEED certification due to its high recycled content and sustainability. = Copper and its alloys = Copper is a very durable metal, withstanding corrosion when forming a bluish-green patina that variably consists of copper carbonates, sulfates, sulfides, and chlorides. Sheet copper used as roofing is lighter than wooden shingles and much lighter than slate, tile, or lead. Roofing copper can be folded readily into waterproof seams, or shaped over curved frameworks for cupolas and domes. The initial cost of copper was traditionally high, but its length of service more than compensated for the price. Copper could also be shaped to the bends and angles around chimneys and at roof edges and dormers. All nails, screws, bolts, and cleats used with sheet copper must be made of copper or a copper alloy, otherwise galvanic action between the dissimilar metals would occur, causing deterioration.Gayle & Waite (1980), pp 22-34. Copper was also used for decorative purposes, including architectural ornaments, siding, ceilings or sculptures. One famous example is the Statue of Liberty. Copper alloys used in architecture include bronze, an alloy of copper and tin, and brass, an alloy of copper and zinc. = Nickel and its alloys = Although somewhat rare, nickel has been used for plating architectural details. Nickel is most frequently used for building components in the form of alloys: nickel silver, Monel metal, and stainless steel. Nickel silver was originally called ‚ÄúGerman Silver,‚Äù until World War I. It has been called ‚Äúwhite brass‚Äù but probably should be termed ‚Äúnickel brass,‚Äù because it generally contains 75% copper, 20% nickel, and 5% zinc. Different percentages result in a range of colors, including silvery-white, yellow, slight blue, green or pink. Nickel silver hardware was popular in the US during the Art Deco and Depression Modern periods. Architects and designers preferred nickel silver because it could take and retain appropriate finishes, and it resisted corrosion.Gayle & Waite (1980), p 35. Monel metal is an alloy of approximately two-thirds nickel and one-third copper. It is similar to platinum in color. Monel pioneered many of the present uses of stainless steel. The first architectural use of Monel was for roofing the Pennsylvania Railroad Terminal in New York City in 1909. In 1936, the copper roof on the New York City Public Library at Fifth Avenue and 42nd Street was replaced with a Monel metal roof. Its advantages as a roofing material included its ability to be brazed, welded, or soldered in place to provide a watertight, continuous cover. Monel was popular during the Art Deco periods. During World War II large quantities of nickel and copper were diverted to the war effort, and the supply of Monel was greatly reduced. Following the war, stainless steel and aluminium replaced Monel because of lower production costs.Gayle & Waite (1980), pp 35-40. = Iron and its alloys = Iron has become an important architectural building component. It has been used in four common forms: wrought iron, cast iron, sheet iron, and steel.Gayle & Waite (1980), pp 42-83. Wrought iron was used for minor structural and decorative elements starting in the 18th century. Until the mid-19th century, the use of wrought iron in buildings was generally limited to small items such as tie rods, straps, nails, and hardware, or to decorative ironwork in balconies, railings fences and gates. Around 1850 its structural use became more widespread as iron mills began to roll rails, bulb-tees, and eventually I-beams. It was also used for decorative purposes, such as ornamental balconies or hardware. Since wrought iron is handmade, no two pieces are identical. Cast iron was a major 19th century building material of the Industrial Revolution. Although brittle, it is remarkably strong in compression. It was frequently used for structural purposes, such as columns, building fronts, domes and light courts. Decorative uses have included stairs, elevators, lintels, grilles, verandas, balconies, railings, fences, streetlights, and tombs. The Bradbury Building is an example of extensive decorative cast iron. Today, cast iron is used for plumbing fixtures and piping in new construction, and its structural and decorative use is used occasionally through historic preservation practices. Sheet iron can be subject to rapid corrosion, forming rust. Sheet iron was used throughout the 19th century, although it is not clear how widespread sheet iron roofs became. Pressed decorative sheet iron used for ceilings was frequently called a ‚Äútin ceiling,‚Äù which was actually sheets of iron dipped in molten tin to prevent them from rusting. Steel was introduced to the construction industry at the end of the 19th century. The development of structural steel in the mid-19th century allowed construction of tall buildings. Builders and manufacturers turned to steel, which was stronger than cast iron in compression and wrought iron in tension. When the Bessemer process was developed in England in 1856, and the open-hearth process was invented, steel was produced in a quantity that allowed it to be economical. Bridges, railroad companies, and skyscrapers were among the first large-scale uses of structural steel. Although iron and steel are not combustible, they lose strength in a fire if they are not protected from the heat. Almost all structural steel must be ‚Äúfireproofed‚Äù in some manner, utilizing a cladding of terra-cotta, tile, plaster-poured concrete, sprayed concrete, or sprayed insulation. Ferro concrete, also called reinforced concrete, was developed in the late 19th century when steel wire was added to concrete. Decorative steels used in buildings include: * Stainless steel, a chromium-nickel steel, developed between 1903 and 1912. Its most important property is its resistance to corrosion. It contains about 18% chromium and 8-12% nickel. Stainless steel is expensive, so it was used primarily as a nonstructural metal or where there is a high potential for corrosion. One of the most extensive early uses of stainless steel was in the Chrysler Building. * Copper-bearing steels, containing from .15% to .25% copper, develop increased resistance to atmospheric corrosion, when compared to ordinary steel, by forming a protective oxide coating, having a uniform deep brown color and texture. Eero Saarinen experimented with the material in the Deere and Company building in 1964. = Aluminium = Much like copper, Aluminium is highly resistant to corrosion. It also has the added benefit of being a third lighter than steel with comparable strength. Aluminium can also be easily and repeatedly recycled. It has been estimated that of the estimated 900 million tonnes of aluminium produced since 1880, three quarters is still in productive use, 35% of which is in building construction. Aluminium was unavailable at reasonable cost or in sufficient quantities for general architectural use until after the beginning of the 20th century. Architectural use of aluminum increased in the 1920s, mainly for decorative detailing. It was used for roofing, flashing, gutters, downspouts, wall panels, and spandrels. Art Deco designs frequently used aluminum for ornamental features. The first extensive use of aluminum in construction was the Empire State Building, where the entire tower portion is aluminum, as well as many decorative features, such as the entrances, elevator doors, ornamental trim, and some 6,000 window spandrels. Today, aluminum is used frequently in construction except major structural members.Gayle & Waite (1980), pp 84-88. See also * Building materials References Sources * Gayle, Margot and Waite, John G.

He was an offensive lineman for the Minnesota Vikings (1988‚Äì1993), the Pittsburgh Steelers (1994) and the Cincinnati Bengals (1995).Fittipaldo, Ray (21 July 2003). Former Steeler's charity work with NFL group does Pittsburgh proud, Pittsburgh Post-Gazette After starting his final (36) with Arizona State University which included three Bowl Game appearances (Holiday, Rose and Freedom), Kalis was the 17th offensive lineman (the fifth guard) in the fourth-round (108th pick) of the Minnesota Vikings in the 1988 NFL Draft. Early life Kalis was born in Stillwater, Minnesota. He spent his early childhood there before moving with his father, mother and two sisters to Hudson, Wisconsin. Shortly thereafter he moved again to Phoenix where he attended Thunderbird High School and lettered in football, tennis and track and field. Playing career Kalis was heavily recruited out of high school for football and tennis. He accepted an offer from head coach Darryl Rogers to play at Arizona State University. Kalis preferred to stay in his hometown which allowed his parents the opportunity to attend his home games on Saturday nights in Tempe, Arizona. Kalis redshirted his freshman season in 1983 with the Sun Devils playing defensive end. In 1984 Kalis met with head coach Darryl Rogers prior to the start of spring practice. Kalis was told by Rogers he would be moved to the offensive line following the conclusion of spring practice if he did not secure either a first or second string position. Kalis contemplated the conversation and returned the next day to tell head coach Darryl Rogers to move him to the offense immediately. Kalis believed Rogers had already made up his mind to move him to the offensive line so Kalis decided not to wait to get a head start on the new position. Kalis participated in the 1984 spring practice sessions as an offensive tackle. In 1985 Arizona State University hired head coach John Cooper. Prior to the spring practice sessions Kalis was asked by offensive line coach Tom Freeman to move to the right guard position. Kalis competed and won the first string right guard position and started every game for the Sun Devils in 1985. The Sun Devils completed the season with an 8‚Äì3 record and an invitation to play in the 1985 Holiday Bowl against the Arkansas Razorbacks at Jack Murphy Stadium. On December 22, 1985 Arizona State lost to the Arkansas Razorbacks 18-17. The 1986 Arizona State University football season proved to be a very historic year for the Sun Devils. Arizona State finished the regular season with a record of 9‚Äì1‚Äì1 and won the Pac-10 Conference title and received an invitation to play the Michigan Wolverines in the 1987 Rose Bowl. On January 1, 1987 in front of a crowd of 103,168 the Sun Devils defeated Michigan 22‚Äì15. ASU finished the season ranked 4th by the Associated Press and 5th by United Press International. Kalis was a starting member of the Sun Devil offensive line that averaged 208 yards per game. In 1987 ASU football team finished the season with a 7‚Äì4‚Äì1 record and an invitation to play Air Force in the 1987 Freedom Bowl. The Sun Devils defeated Air Force 33‚Äì28 on December 30, 1987 in Anaheim Stadium and finished the season ranked 20th by the Associated Press. Kalis finished his four-year letterman career at ASU with (36) consecutive starts, 33 regular season and 3 bowl games. =Minnesota Vikings 1988-1993= During his rookie season in 1988, head coach Jerry Burns assigned Kalis the responsibility of providing back-up assistance to both starting right tackle Tim Irwin (14-year NFL veteran) and left tackle Gary Zimmerman (Hall of Fame 2008). The Vikings finished the regular season 11‚Äì5 and reached the NFL playoffs as a NFC Wild Card team and beat the Los Angeles Rams 28-17 on December 26, 1988. The following week the Vikings met the San Francisco 49ers in the NFC Division Playoffs on January 1, 1989 at Candlestick Park and lost the game 34‚Äì9. The San Francisco 49ers went on to win Super Bowl XXIII. The Minnesota Vikings finished the season 2nd in the NFC Central Division. In 1989 Kalis was given the opportunity to compete for the starting right guard position on the offensive line. He was successful and started every 1989 regular season game as well as the 1990 playoff game versus the San Francisco 49ers. Kalis joined fellow starting offensive lineman Tim Irwin (right tackle), Kirk Lowdermilk (center), Randall McDaniel (left guard/Hall of Fame 2009) and Gary Zimmerman (left tackle/Hall of Fame 2008). On January 6, 1990 the Vikings met the San Francisco 49ers in the 1989 NFC Divisional Playoffs at Candlestick Park and lost 41‚Äì13. The San Francisco 49ers went on to win Super Bowl XXIV. The Minnesota Vikings finished the season with a record of 10‚Äì6 and 1st in the NFC Central Division. The 1990 football season proved to be a disappointing year for the Minnesota Vikings. Kalis started all (16) regular season games but the team failed to reach the NFL Playoffs. The Vikings finished the season 6-10 despite having a five-game winning streak in November and early December. The team went on to finish the season with a four-game losing streak which included the New York Giants, Tampa Bay Buccaneers, Los Angeles Raiders and San Francisco 49ers. The Minnesota Vikings finished the season 2nd in the NFC Central Division. The 1991 football season record improved to 8‚Äì8 but would be Jerry Burns last as head coach. Kalis shared the starting responsibilities at the right guard position throughout the season with Brian Habib. The Minnesota Vikings finished the season 3rd in the NFC Central Division. 1992 Kalis suffered a potentially career ending knee injury during a pre-season game versus the Washington Redskins. Kalis rehabilitated the injury throughout the 1992 season and did not return to action. Under the leadership of new head coach Dennis Green the Vikings went on to earn a playoff spot in the NFC Wild Card game versus the Washington Redskins. On January 2, 1993 the Vikings played the Washington Redskins at the Metrodome in Minnesota and even though the Vikings had the home field advantage, they lost the game 24‚Äì7. The Minnesota Vikings finished the season with a record of 11‚Äì5 and 1st in the NFC Central Division. The 1993 season was a year of recovery for Kalis. Following an extensive rehabilitation regimen due to the knee injury from the previous year, Kalis battled and recaptured the starting right guard position. As the season progressed so did his play and the Vikings returned to the NFC playoffs for the fourth time during his six-year tenure as a Viking. The team finished 9‚Äì7 and secured a Wild Card Playoff berth. On January 9, 1994 the Vikings played against the New York Giants at Giants Stadium with Jim McMahon as their starting quarterback. The Vikings lost the game 17‚Äì10 and Kalis played his last game as a Minnesota Viking. The Minnesota Vikings finished the season 2nd in the NFC Central Division. =Pittsburgh Steelers 1994= During the off season prior to the 1994 regular season Kalis worked with his agent G. Bruce Allen to find a new NFL home. On May 20, 1994 he signed a new three-year contract and began his career with the Pittsburgh Steelers. He competed and won the right guard position and joined fellow starting offensive lineman Leon Searcy (right tackle), Dermontti Dawson (center/Hall of Fame 2012), Duval Love (left guard), John Jackson (left tackle). On November 20, 1994 the Steelers faced the Miami Dolphins in week (12) of the regular season. The Steelers lost the game in overtime 16-13 and also lost Kalis for the rest of the season due to a broken ankle suffered in overtime while completing a downfield block for running back Barry Foster. The Steelers finished the season 12-4-0, won the AFC Central Division title and defeated the Cleveland Browns 29-9 on January 7, 1995 in the AFC Division Playoff game at Three Rivers Stadium. On January 15, 1995 the Steelers faced the San Diego Chargers in the AFC Conference Championship Game. Late in the fourth quarter the Steelers marched from their own 17-yard line to the San Diego 3 to put themselves in position for a potential winning touchdown. However, on fourth down, Chargers linebacker Dennis Gibson sealed the victory by tipping away Neil O'Donnell's pass intended for running back Barry Foster. The San Diego Chargers won the game 17-13 and went on to lose 49-26 to the San Francisco 49ers in Super Bowl XXIX. The Pittsburgh Steelers finished 1st in the AFC Central Division. =Cincinnati Bengals 1995= Kalis began the 1995 season by attending training camp in Latrobe, Pennsylvania with the Pittsburgh Steelers. He was returning from a season ending ankle surgery and was surprised to find himself being asked to play the left guard position during the pre-season. He started all (4) pre-season games at left guard due to an illness that Tom Newberry had battled throughout training camp. On the last day of training camp Kalis was released by the Steelers. Two days later he was in Cincinnati signing a new contract with the Bengals. Kalis saw limited action early in the season at both left and right guard. Kalis replaced Bruce Kozerski as the starting right guard when Kozerski suffered a season/career ending ankle injury. Kalis was the starting right guard for the Cincinnati Bengals for the last game ever played at Cleveland Municipal Stadium on December 17, 1995. At the time it was believed to be the last Cleveland Browns game ever to be played in Cleveland. Kalis was on the field when a time out was called by the officials to allow the Bengals to relocate to the other end of the field. The officials wanted to create more distance between the Bengals players and the fans who had already begun to tear seats out of the stadium and throw them onto the field. Kalis started his final NFL football game on December 24, 1995 beating the Minnesota Vikings 27-24 at Riverfront Stadium in Cincinnati, Ohio. The Cincinnati Bengals finished the season with a record of 7-9 and 2nd in the AFC Central Division. =NFL Alumni= Kalis began his work with the NFL Alumni, a 501 (c) (3) non-profit organization after being voted President of the Pittsburgh Chapter in June 2000. In 2002, he became a member of the Board of Directors, in 2003 Chairman, Board of Chapter Presidents and in 2004 Vice-Chairman, Board of Directors. On January 31, 2017 he resigned as chapter President after hosting the NFL Alumni's #1 charity golf tournament for 16 years and chapter sporting clays event for 10 years. During his tenure as chapter President the Pittsburgh Chapter raised over 3 million net dollars for numerous Western Pennsylvania charitable organizations. The events were held annually to support the organizations motto of ‚ÄúCaring for Kids‚Äù. =Pigskin dreams= Kalis is co-author of Pigskin Dreams - The People, Places and Events that Forged the Character of the NFL's Greatest Players.Rand, Michael (19 April 2012).

He is a graduate of Arizona State University with a Bachelor of Science degree in Economics. Kalis also co-hosted a local Pittsburgh television sports show called ‚ÄúThe Steelers Huddle‚Äù in 2002 and 2003. He also enjoys speaking on numerous subjects including character and the history of American football. He currently resides in Mars, Pennsylvania with his wife Kristen and three youngest children. Kyle Kalis, his oldest son, was an offensive lineman for the University of Michigan 2012-16, the NFL Washington Redskins and Indianapolis Colts in 2017 and the Cleveland Browns in 2018.

Plot summary In a post-apocalyptic America, Jamie Teague is traveling from the east coast to his home in the Great Smoky Mountains. Along the way, he comes across a group of people traveling on the highway and headed straight for a group of Bushwhackers that kills anyone who tries to pass. After warning them, Jamie starts to follow them and, when the Winston highway patrol refuses to let them take an alternate route, he decides to help them get past the Bushwhackers. As they travel together, Jamie finds out that the people are Mormons and that they are headed for Utah to avoid being massacred. Knowing that they will die without his help, he agrees to take them as far as his cabin. He also agrees to let them stay with him during the winter. In the spring, Jamie tells the group about how when he was a child his mother made him keep his younger brother and sister locked in a closet until they went insane. After making this confession, Jamie gets baptized as a Mormon and decides to lead the group to Utah. When they finally arrive in Utah, they all settle down into their own homes but remain close friends. Connection to other stories in the series During the trip from Jamie Teague‚Äôs home in the Great Smoky Mountains to Utah, the group finds a little mute boy whose parents had been killed by mobbers. They take him along with them and he is placed in foster care when they reach Utah. The short story \\"Salvage\\" by Orson Scott Card takes place about fifteen years after the events in \\"West\\". The little mute boy has grown up and been named Deaver Teague after Jamie Teague and Brother Deaver. In this story, Deaver is a young man who goes diving in a Mormon temple to try to find hidden gold. Deaver is also the main character of the story \\"Pageant Wagon\\". It takes place when he is in his late twenties and is the story of how he meets up with and joins a group of traveling actors. At the end of \\"West\\", Deaver Teague and his group meet with Sam Monson, the governor of Deseret. In the story \\"America\\", Sam met and had a baby with an American Indian woman when he was a teenager. Influences As with many of Card's other literature, a Christian/Mormon influence is present in this story.

Schwab, a German citizen, was visiting Australia on a tourist visa; the media dubbed him The Kimberley Killer.  Early life  Joseph Thomas Schwab was born in Starnberg, Bavaria, West Germany on 25 November 1960. A shy and timid student, he joined the local rifle club in Pocking when aged 15, remaining a member until 1981. On 15 June 1981, he travelled to Adelaide, South Australia, and worked as a cabinet maker while also joining the local pistol club. Owning several rifles and a 4WD, he also went feral pig shooting. He returned to Germany on 10 May 1984, becoming a security guard and was trained in using a pistol. He was employed as a night watchman from 3 April 1985 to 15 April 1987, and during this time, he committed several minor crimes. On 18 April 1987, he arrived in Brisbane, Australia via Bangkok as a tourist. On 22 April, he rented a Toyota 4Runner at Brisbane Airport before buying three rifles (.223-caliber Ruger Mini-14 semi- automatic rifle, a .308 SAKO bolt-action rifle and a .22-caliber Brno bolt- action rifle) and a Winchester 12-gauge pump-action shotgun and 3,000 rounds of ammunition. He later departed west and was in the vicinity of the Diamantina River by 6 May and in the Darwin area by 20 May. Killings The gunman‚Äôs first known victims were Marcus Bullen (70), a former deputy mayor of Fremantle, and his son, Lance Bullen (42), who were shot dead from behind with a Ruger on the morning of 9 June, while scouting for a fishing spot on the banks of the Victoria River. They were reported missing to Timber Creek Police, and their burnt out station wagon was found the next day and their stripped bodies were discovered nearby in poorly hidden shallow graves. Just five days later, three locals who went fishing overnight (Phillip Walkemeyer (26), his fianc√©e Julie Warren (25), and their friend, Terry Bolt (36)) were shot dead hundreds of kilometres away in neighbouring Western Australia in similar circumstances at a campsite at the Pentecost River Crossing near Wyndham. They were reported missing the next day after not appearing at work, and work colleagues (two of who had camped with them the day before) returned to the site and found their burnt Toyota and traces of blood. Police then located the bodies floating nearby in the river. As in the previous incident, Schwab had stripped the victims, put their possessions in their vehicle, and then drove it a short distance away and set it on fire.  Investigation  Police investigations were unable determine a motive for the killings, and the killer evaded capture despite roadblocks being set up across the area. A seven-member team of police officers from the Tactical Response Group and an officer from the forensic division were rushed by chartered jet from Perth to Kununurra to assist Kimberley police with the apprehension of the suspect. Forensics identified the weapon used in the murders as a Ruger Mini-14 .223 semi-automatic rifle. The killer was suspected to be driving a white Toyota 4Runner with conspicuous red side stripes after a truck driver saw a vehicle with this description leaving the area of the second vehicle fire. An intensive police search and network of roadblocks was unable to locate the suspect vehicle. However, an outback livestock mustering helicopter pilot from Napier Downs station, raised the alarm after spotting a camouflaged vehicle in bushland near Fitzroy Crossing. Tactical police, unsure if the hidden vehicle belonged to the gunman they were looking for, approached it cautiously on the ground and then called on a police Cessna 182 to fly over the site in an attempt to flush the occupant out into the open. A man dressed in military trousers and armed with a semi-automatic weapon emerged from the camouflaged camp and opened fire on the aircraft. Police on the ground identified themselves, whereupon the gunman opened fire on them too. Police returned fire, including firing tear gas canisters, eventually killing the gunman after a protracted firefight. Police were able to save the vehicle from a grassfire started by the canisters, finding personal items (licences, credit cards, camping goods etc) from the victims inside. The body was then flown to Perth for analysis. They later identified the gunman as Schwab based on rental and immigration documents, but his motive for the killings remains unknown.

The station is owned and service is operated by New Jersey Transit. The station is located at the intersection of Raymond Boulevard, Park Place and Broad Street in Downtown Newark at Military Park. The station was opened in 1935 as Broad Street station. It was renamed on September 4, 2004, so only one station in the system would carry the name Broad Street when Downtown Newark's stations (Penn Station and Broad Street) were connected by the Newark Light Rail line. The station is decorated with beige tiles and colored tiles for borders, mosaics and street indicator signs. This station is not wheelchair accessible, but the adjacent stations, Penn Station and Washington Street, are. History In 1910, the Public Service Corporation planned to build two subway lines meeting at Broad Street (now Military Park). An additional north‚Äìsouth line would have connected Bridge Street to the north with Clinton Avenue near The Coast/Lincoln Park neighborhood near Lincoln Park. The proposed second segment of the Newark-Elizabeth Rail Link (NERL) together with the first segment, the Newark Light Rail would service this area. The existing Newark City Subway Line was built in the old Morris Canal bed with construction beginning in 1929 and service starting on the line on May 26, 1935.

It appears in Card's short story collection The Folk of the Fringe and was also reprinted in the anthology Wastelands: Stories of the Apocalypse. Plot summary In a post-apocalyptic America, Deaver Teague makes a living salvaging things left behind from before the war. Although he makes more money than a lot of people, he knows that he won't be able to do this job forever. When he hears a couple of truck drivers talking about some gold hidden in a Mormon temple in the now flooded Salt Lake City he decides to go and look for it. Deaver can't do this by himself so he goes to two of his friends, who are not very religious Mormons, and asks them for help. Reluctantly they agree. His friend Lehi gets some diving equipment and his friend Rain agrees to take him out to the temple in her boat. On the way Deaver tells them about how he was orphaned even though he doesn't like to talk about it because he believes that friends don't keep secrets from each other. When they arrive at the temple Deaver dives down into the building and comes up with some pieces of metal which he believes to be the hidden gold. When he gets to the surface, he finds out that they are prayers that people have scratched into flattened tin cans and thrown into the temple windows. When he discovers that his friends knew that people were coming out here and doing this, he feels betrayed because they didn't tell him and he decides to move away. Connection to other stories in the series In Card's story \\"West\\", Deaver Teague was found by a group of traveling Mormons after his parents were killed. Since the boy had no parents, the group decided to take him along with them to Utah. At the time, he was unable to talk and they did not know his name so he was named after two of the men in the group; Jamie Teague and Brother Deaver. The story \\"Pageant Wagon\\" also features Deaver Teague. It takes place when he is in his late twenties and is the story of how he meets up with and joins a group of traveling actors. Influences As with many of Card's other literature, a Christian/Mormon influence is present in this story.

In it, a teenage boy named Sam Monson travels to Brazil with his father. While there, he begins dreaming about a woman who lives in a nearby Indian village named Anamari. When he goes to the village, he finds the woman and begins helping her take care of the villagers.

On his last night in Brazil, Sam sleeps with Anamari and she gets pregnant with that boy. Years after the war when Sam is the governor of the state of Deseret, Amamari comes to meet with him to negotiate a peace treaty on behalf of their son, Quetzalcoatl (named after Quetzalcoatl, a Mesoamerican deity).

An hour later, their sons show up at Mr. Carpenter's house and take him out to a dry riverbed that will flood with the coming rain and dump him into it so that he will drown. Just as he is about to drown, he is rescued by a group from a traveling pageant show.
