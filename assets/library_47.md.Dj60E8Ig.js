He was a 1949 graduate of Jacksonville's Landon High School, where he was named valedictorian. He received a degree in business from the University of Florida in 1953, the same year he married his wife, Shirley. He attended law school at the University of Miami before serving two years as an officer in the United States Army First Infantry during the Korean War. After leaving the Army, he completed his law degree at the University of Florida College of Law. He was admitted to the Florida Bar on November 6, 1958.\\"Louis O Frost, Jr.\\" Florida Bar website, Find a Lawyer and worked briefly in a Jacksonville private practice. Career In 1959, then-county solicitor Lacy Mahon Jr. hired Frost as a part-time prosecutor. After Edward M. Booth was elected County Solicitor, he retained Frost on the staff, as well as Ed Austin. Frost first became acquainted with Austin in 1951 at the University of Florida when the former was a student and the latter was a teacher. A few years later, Frost was a First Lieutenant at Fort Sill, Oklahoma when Austin attended Officer Candidate School. They also attended law school together. In the 1963 Gideon v. Wainwright decision, the U.S. Supreme Court ruled that defendants charged with felonies (besides murder) were also entitled to legal representation by the State. In response, the Florida Legislature established the office of Public Defender, and Governor Farris Bryant appointed Ed Austin as Jacksonville's first public defender. Austin asked Frost if he would be interested in changing sides. Frost said \\"yes\\" and he became Austin's chief assistant. Frost commented, > I never got a big bang out of putting people in jail. I always felt there > was some good in every person ‚Äì even though you had to find it in some of > them.

When Austin resigned to run for State Attorney in 1968, Frost was invited to change sides again, but he declined and was appointed to fill Austin's remaining term by Governor Claude Kirk. Frost was elected public defender later that year and retained the post until he retired in January 2005, running unopposed 9 times. Frost explained how that happened: \\"I was a Democrat in the mostly Republican Fourth Judicial Circuit. When Don Brewer was the head of the Republican Party he told me I was doing a fine job and I would run unopposed.\\" Frost was also asked to help establish other public defender offices across the country. Personal Frost and his wife Shirley were married for 47 years and raised two children: Louis O. Frost IV and Deborah.

He had an interest in solitary and penitential living which has led him to be identified as a forerunner of the secular hermits of the Georgian period.Gordon Campbell, The Hermit in the Garden, 2013, reviewed in the Times Literary Supplement 16 August 2013, p. 31. Thomas Bushell was born around 1593 and was a servant of Bacon's from around 1608 until Bacon's impeachment (when he was a cause of charges of corruption being brought against Bacon). After Bacon's death Bushell moved to the south west of England becoming a mining engineer and master of the mint. He took up residence in Lundy which he defended for the Royalists during the Civil War. Lundy was the last place to surrender at the end of the Civil War. Life He was a younger son of a family living at Cleve Prior in Worcestershire. At the age of 15 he entered the service of Sir Francis Bacon, and later acted as his seal-bearer or secretary. When Bacon became lord chancellor, Bushell accompanied him to court. Bacon instructed Bushell on minerals, by his account;In a treatise Mr. Bushell's Abridgment of the Lord Chancellor Bacon's Philosophical Theory in Mineral Prosecutions (London, 1650), and in the Extract by Mr. Bushell of the Abridgment [of Bacon's Theory], printed for the Satisfaction of his Noble Friends that importunately desired it (London, 1660). Bacon also paid off his debts. On Bacon's disgrace Bushell adopted an ascetic vegetarian diet and retired to the Isle of Wight, where he lived for some time disguised as a fisherman. He returned to London; but on his master's death in 1626 he lived for three years in a hut on the Calf of Man. Bushell came to live in Oxfordshire, where he had an estate at Road Enstone, near Woodstock. There he found a spring and rock formation, which he made into an attraction as a grotto. Charles I paid Bushell an unexpected visit there. On a subsequent royal visit in 1636 the rock was presented to Queen Henrietta Maria in a kind of masque, for which Bushell himself provided some verse (see The Several Speeches and Songs at the Presentment of the Rock at Enston, Oxon. 1636). In 1635 Bushell's was granted a soap monopoly; in January 1637 he had the grant of the royal mines in Wales. Mines of Cardiganshire, containing silver mixed with their lead, formed crown property. They had formerly been farmed by Sir Hugh Middleton, who sent the silver which he extracted to be coined at the Royal Mint in the Tower of London. After the death of Middleton the mines were reported to be inundated and in poor condition; Bushell in purchasing the lease proposed to recover the inundated mines, and to employ new methods of mining, with a local mint at castle at Aberystwyth Castle. The mint was established in July 1637 with Bushell as warden and master-worker, and English silver coins of various denominations were issued from it. Bushell recovered several drowned mines, and discovered new branches of old mines. During the First English Civil War Bushell was a royalist providing finance. He held Lundy Island for the king; but, with the royal sanction, surrendered it on 24 February 1647. He went into hiding; but in August 1652, gave securities to the Council of State for his future good behaviour. He obtained from Oliver Cromwell a renewal of his lease, and a confirmation of his granting the silver he extracted. These privileges were confirmed in February 1658 by Richard Cromwell, who also protected and encouraged Bushell in his operations in connection with the lead mines in the forest of Mendip. Bushell's mining schemes in Somersetshire received the sanction of Charles II; but little is known of the last few years of his life. It is probable that he had money troubles. Bushell died in 1674, and was buried in the cloisters of Westminster Abbey. His wife was Anne, widow of Sir William Waad, lieutenant of the Tower. Vegetarianism Bushell was one of the earliest vegetarians in England. For several years as a hermit on the Calf of Man he lived on a strict diet of oil, honey, mustard, herbs, biscuits and water.Fudge, Erica. (2004).

History  In 1521 Parma was invaded by the imperial-papal troops under Prospero Colonna, in the course of the Italian Wars. The young Parmigianino, then seventeen, was sent by his family to Viadana to his cousin's house. According to Italian late Renaissance art biographer Giorgio Vasari,Giorgio Vasari, Lives of the Most Excellent Painters, Sculptors, and Architects there Parmigianino painted two tempera panels: St. Francis Receiving the Stigmata (lost) and the Marriage of St. Catherine, which was placed in the church of San Pietro. The latter was stolen in 1629, during the War of Mantuan Succession, and brought to Parma. Later, in unknown circumstances, it was transferred to the current location in Bardi, a town near Parma: here, in 1860, members of the Academy of Fine Arts of Parma recognized as by Parmigianino, although the identification remained disputed until the 1930s. Description The work depicts the mystical marriage of Saint Catherine of Alexandria, set a in a fake niche with a colonnade surmounting the background curved wall. The scheme is that of the Holy Conversation. In the middle is the Virgin sitting on a tall throne, above a historiated section of column (decorated with a barely visible putto), giving the Child to St. Catherine, on the left, who receives the symbolic marriage ring. At the sides are two saints, St. John the Evangelist (with a chalice full of snakes, a hint to his alleged miraculous discovery and healing of a poisoned drink) and St. John the Baptist, who holds his typical attributed, a tall and slim cross. Catherine's attributed are shown in the low foreground, including a broken wheel and the martyrdom palm.

Reynolds was born in New Orleans in 1963 where he began his long and distinguished career. At age 11 he began winning awards and receiving the respect of the elite of the art world. Having unlimited styles at his disposal in the art community of New Orleans, Patrick decided early on to not conform to any of them, Instead, carving out his own way creating a style never before seen. Today, Patrick is the only artist in the United States to maintain graphite block and limestone suspended in oil. As he developed the medium over time, graphite figurative romanticism was born. And one could easily say that his art will be carved into the history books and studied for generations to come. Today, Patrick pushes the envelope of his style, forever exploring the stories that can be told through art. The signature style remains evident in every new layout drawing or final masterpiece. \\"The passion is the same\\" says Patrick. \\"It's a burning desire to begin a piece that has already been completed in my head. It must materialize, it must come to life.\\". \\"Today, Patrick is still inventing cutting edge techniques that had their roots in the canvases of the old masters. With his work being displayed world wide, Patrick feels that his work may touch people from all walks of life\\". Paragon Gallery\\"Fanciful or not, the winged beings tell the tales that course through Reynolds' soul and spring from his fingertips.\\" Says Art Business News, describing Patrick's Angel Series in the early 2000s.\\"Fanciful or not, the winged beings tell the tales that course through Reynolds' soul and spring from his fingertips.\\" Says . Patrick begins his pieces by grinding graphite and limestone into boiled linseed oil and varying thickness on his palette. He then uses a brush to swirl the mixture onto the board creating both texture and form. The result becomes a rock hard fine art that will last for centuries. Art collectors from all walks of life describe the work as moving, and that is what it is intended to do, move you. Rarely, if ever, does it match the couch or the curtains. Patrick's work falls into the category of generational collections. Found in some of the most prestigious corporate and family collections in the world. As a published author, of his art and writings such as Principals of Peace, Patrick continues work on new projects such as Journey of Dreams, a new book due out this summer, and Tears of a Dreamer, a book based on the philosophies of Patrick Reynolds works. Known for painting notable art works as \\"Heavens Hues America\\". An angel bows her head over an American flag and weeps. And \\"Eternal Embrace\\", the piece depicting two people becoming one.

It has developed into one of the world's leading global health conferences. It was held for the first time on the occasion of the 300th anniversary of the founding of the Charit√©. 2,500 experts from around 100 countries from science, business, politics and civil society discussed the most important issues of global health care and made recommendations. The academic backbone of the event is the M8 Alliance of Academic Health Centers, Universities and National Academies. From the very beginning, the World Health Summit has been under the patronage of the German Chancellor and the French President. Since 2013, the President of the European Commission has also taken over the annual patronage and since 2019, the Director-General of the World Health Organization (WHO) has also been a patron of the World Health Summit.  History  The summit began in 2009 on the occasion of the 300th year anniversary of the Charit√© ‚Äì Universit√§tsmedizin Berlin. The founders recognized that whilst similar gatherings of leaders were well established in fields such as economic development and technology, a global forum did not exist for medical practice, research and health care systems. The summit was established under the patronage of the German chancellor, Angela Merkel, and the President of the French Republic, Nicolas Sarkozy. Sarkozy's successor, President Francois Hollande, continued the patronage as did Emmanuel Macron. They were joined in 2013 by Jos√© Manuel Barroso, President of the European Commission. Jean-Claude Juncker and Ursula von der Leyen continued this patronage. Since 2019, the World Health Organization‚Äôs (WHO) Director-General Tedros Adhanom joined as patron. WHS Patronage Four ministries of the government of the Federal Republic of Germany directly support the summit (Health, Foreign Office, Education and Research, Economic Cooperation and Development). Traditionally, the German Federal Minister of Health attends the World Health Summit and holds a keynote in its opening ceremony. When being Governing Mayor of Berlin, Klaus Wowereit, was a regular attendee at the World Health Summit and prominent participant in its opening ceremonies as well.  Mission  According to the World Health Summit's Mission Statement published in The Lancet in 2009, its mission is in keeping with the United Nations Declaration of Human Rights' (1948) acknowledgement of health as a fundamental human right. At present, more than half of the world's population is not receiving proper medical care, therefore the organizers of the World Health Summit see their mission as improving healthcare worldwide and promoting equitable access to medication and prevention. The achievement of this mission is seen as threatened by unsolved and newly emerging problems such as: \\"the demographic shift to an ageing society; climate change and its health consequences that are already being felt; new types of epidemics, such as obesity, mental ill-health, and violence and injury, in developed and developing countries, it is eradicating the diseases of HIV, TB, and malaria; the rising costs of health care; and the worldwide economic crisis and its serious threats to the health of populations across the globe. WHS Vision and Goals The World Health Summit seeks to actively address these challenges by bringing together stakeholders from research, education, clinical care and many other disciplines to jointly develop strategies to tackle these major health care issues. The outcome of each multi-sectoral Summit is intended to inform and influence decision-makers such as governments and supranational agencies, as recommendations for meeting future health care challenges. Leadership The World Health Summit is presided over by Professor Dr med Detlev Ganten, a career medical research scientist and Chairman of the Board of the Charit√© Foundation. In addition to Professor Dr Ganten's role as standing President, each year the co-presidency rotates amongst the members of the M8 Alliance of Academic Health Centers, Universities and National Academies, which together with the European Union and the World Health Organization is a primary contributor to the World Health Summit's themes and programs. The International Co-President of the World Health Summit 2020 from 25 - 27 October in Berlin is Charles Ibingira from Makerere University College of Health Sciences in Uganda. Previous co- presidencies have been exercised by: * Professor Dr Axel Kahn; Universit√© Paris Descartes (now integrated into the M8 Alliance membership of the Sorbonne); 2009 * Professor Dr Stephen K. Smith; Imperial College London; 2010 * Professor Dr Steve Wesselingh; Monash University (Australia); 2011 [Professor Dr Christina Mitchell fulfilled the role of Co-President during the Summit proper in the absence of Professor Wesselingh] * Professor Dr Michael Klag; Johns Hopkins University (U.S.); 2012 * Professor Dr John Eu Li Wong; National University of Singapore (Singapore); 2013 * Professor Dr Jos√© Ot√°vio Costa Auler Jr.; University of S√£o Paulo Medical School (Brazil); 2014 * Professor Dr Shunichi Fukuhara; School of Public Health, Kyoto University; 2015 * Professor Dr Antoine Flahault; University of Geneva (Switzerland); 2016 * Professor Dr H√©l√®ne Boisjoly; University of Montreal (Canada); 2017 * Fernando Regateiro, Coimbra University Hospitals; Jo√£o Gabriel Silva, Coimbra University (Portugal); 2018 * Ali Jafarian, Tehran University of Medical Sciences (Iran); 2019  Profile  Each year the World Health Summit focuses on different key topics. These are formulated by members of the M8 Alliance and also by the eminent academicians, researchers and clinicians who form the World Health Summit Council. WHS Leadership = Previous World Health Summits = The first World Health Summit under the motto \\"The Evolution of Medicine\\" took place October 14‚Äì18, 2009; 700 participants worked on concrete recommendations for dealing with pandemic planning, effective prevention strategies and climate change-related diseases.Charit√© Berlin, Book of Proccedings 2009: http://www.worldhealthsummit.org/fileadmin/downloads/Dokumente/WHS%202010%20Book%20of%20Proceedings.pdfWorld Health Summit Program 2009: The Evolution of Medicine http://www.worldhealthsummit.org/fileadmin/downloads/whsSummitProgram.pdf In 2010, the World Health Summit was held October 10‚Äì13, and focused on the continuum of \\"Translation ‚Äì Transition ‚Äì Transformation\\". In keeping with these topics, solutions facilitating the translation of medical knowledge into interventions that benefit patients across the globe, the new health challenges in a world of constant transition and the transformation of health politics and management to respond to these challenges were addressed. WHS History 2010 The third World Health Summit took place October 23‚Äì26, 2011 under the motto: \\"Today's Science ‚Äì Tomorrow's Agenda\\". The former element of this theme recognized that progress in research and technology development is occurring at an unsurpassed rate, while concurrently the challenges have never been greater, with new phenomena such as the health effects of climate change through the distribution of food and water, but also of vector-borne diseases. The latter reflected that no country has yet discovered an ideal health- service model, and that therefore the links between evidence and policy on all levels (national and international) needed to be strengthened. WHS History 2011 The fourth World Health Summit, held from October 20‚Äì24, 2012, under the theme: ‚ÄúResearch for Health and Sustainable Development\\" focused on finding novel solutions for non-communicable diseases and conditions of global concern, such as obesity, diabetes, and mental illness. This recognized that unhealthy lifestyles are a main cause of these new epidemics, and promoted greater awareness of the global economic risks and human suffering related to the epidemiological transition, as well as the urgent need for sustainable solutions enabling healthcare systems to meet the challenge of non- communicable diseases and conditions. WHS History 2012 The fifth World Health Summit, held from October 20‚Äì22, 2013, was the first Summit without individual theme.

Thus, in 2009, this Frankfurt-based organization initiated an alternative conference as a form of protest against the World Health Summit.http://www.medico.de/en/search/?cx=007400307825010633883%3A10wmrhxa_wm&cof;=FORID%3A11&ie;=UTF-8&q;=world+health+summit&sa;=Search#947 Permanent President of the World Health Summit, Professor Dr med Detlev Ganten, has consistently displayed a readiness to engage in constructive discussion with critics, inviting participants of the 2009 alternative conference to attend the World Health Summit 2010 and, thus to enter into a dialogue.http://www.aerzteblatt.de/nachrichten/38559/Alternativkonferenz_zum_World_Health_Summit_Wir_brauchen_keinen_neuen_Club.htm  Role of the M8 Alliance  The M8 Alliance of Academic Health Centers, Universities and National Academies is an academic network of institutions of education and research, including national academies where these exist. It was first officially inaugurated in 2009 on occasion of the first World Health Summit. This international network provides the academic foundation to the World Health Summit. According to the M8 Alliance Profile,http://www.worldhealthsummit.org/m8-alliance/mission.html the network seeks to improve global health and works with political and economic decision makers and civil society to develop science-based solutions for health challenges worldwide. It was created as a permanent platform for framing future considerations of global medical developments and health challenges.http://www.worldhealthsummit.org/m8-alliance/profile/ A key role of the M8 Alliance is to provide an academic foundation to each World Health Summit, with members contributing to topics and program development. =Members of the global M8 Alliance= The M8 Alliance consists of 28 members and affiliated observers spanning every continent.World Health Summit website .[31] After the second World Health Summit 2010, the University of S√£o Paulo and the National University of Singapore joined the network.

Designed by James Walker, for Trinity House at a cost of ¬£20,000. It was completed in 1859 from granite blocks, stands high and is a circular tower with straight sides. It replaced an earlier light tower on top of a cliff overhanging Scratchell's Bay, which was first lit on 29 September 1786. The first lighthouse In 1781 a group of merchants and ship owners petitioned Trinity House for navigation lights to be provided around the western approaches to the Solent. The response was positive, but it was not until 1785 that construction began, on three new lighthouses: one on the clifftop above the Needles, one on Hurst Point and one on St Catherine's Down (which was left unfinished and never lit); all three were designed by Richard Jupp. From September the following year the Needles light was operational. It was described as 'a low truncated cone, situated on the highest point of the lofty cliffs [‚Ä¶], and near the edge of the cliff, forming the western extremity of the island'; however, its height of above sea level meant it was often obscured by fog and sea mists, a problem that eventually led to its replacement some 70 years later. Illumination was provided by 13 Argand lamps with parabolic reflectors; The light initially shone white, but on 1 March 1840 it was altered to display a red light, so as not to be confused with the newly erected lighthouse on St Catherine's Point.London Gazette, Issue 19821, Page 243, 7 February 1840 Prior to its decommissioning, the light shone red to seaward but white from St Alban's Head to Hurst Point. The current lighthouse =History= Before work could begin on the new tower a sizeable section of rock was cut away to provide a level base. Tunnels were also excavated within the rock behind the tower to provide rooms for storage. An oil burner, with four concentric wicks, provided the light source atop the new tower; it was set within a large (first-order) fixed catadioptric optic provided by Henry-Lepaute of Paris. Keepers' accommodation was provided within the lighthouse, which was to be staffed by a team of three keepers (of whom, at any one time, two would be on duty in the tower and one on shore leave, by monthly rotation). The lighthouse was first lit on 1 January 1859. It initially displayed a fixed red light with a white sector indicating a clear approach running south of Durlestone Head and past a pair of sandbanks: South- west Shingles and Dolphin Bank. Later a narrow white sector marked the approach from the north-east past Warden Ledge; By 1884 a further (green) sector had been added and the light made occulting. The tower itself had initially been left as plain granite 'not coated nor coloured', but in 1886, so as to make it stand out more prominently against the cliffs during the day, it was painted with a broad black stripe around the middle; the metalwork of the lantern was also painted black, and dark curtains were hung within the glass when the lamp was not in use.London Gazette, Issue 25564, Page 1035, 2 March 1886 In 1922, a more powerful incandescent paraffin vapour burner was installed, which increased the intensity of the light from 35,000 to 500,000 candlepower. During the Second World War, the lantern, lens and lamp were badly damaged in a German aerial attack. After the war the lighthouse was repaired: in 1946, a new electric light was installed (powered by diesel generators providing 100 volt direct current); then, in 1948, a new, second- order fixed catadioptric optic was made for the lighthouse by Chance Brothers, to replace the one damaged in the war. The lighthouse with helipad. Before automation, the lighthouse was staffed by a three-man crew operating a 24-hour watch, serving one month on / one month off, living in rudimentary conditions in three levels below the light. In 1987 a helipad was added to the top of the lighthouse. By the early 1990s the Needles was the last Trinity House lighthouse to be powered by 100 V DC electricity from its own generators. Before it could become fully automated, a submarine power cable had to be laid, bringing 240 V mains electricity to the lighthouse from the island. By the time the last keepers left on 8 December 1994 the Needles was one of the last three remaining manned rock lighthouses in England and Wales. Fog signalling apparatus Initially the lighthouse had been provided with a 3 cwt bell, hung beneath the gallery, to serve as a fog signal. The bell was struck once every 7.5 seconds; it was sounded by a clockwork mechanism, but using it was 'an arduous piece of work, for the driving weights are very heavy and need to be frequently wound up'. In 1906, a reed fog signal was installed, together with a pair of oil engines in the basement of the tower to provide compressed air; it sounded from three acoustic horns which protruded through the roof of the lantern, giving one long blast every fifteen seconds. In 1946, as part of the electrification of the light, Gardner diesel-driven generators replaced the oil engines; these also powered compressors for the fog horn, which were installed along with a set of air tanks just below the lantern room. By 1964,Admiralty Chart, corrected up to 1964. the reeds had been replaced with two sets of 'supertyfon' air horns, mounted on the parapet surrounding the lantern, which sounded twice every 30 seconds. In 1994 these were in turn replaced by electric emitters as part of the automation process. =Present day= Today the main lamp is a 1500W bulb; the fixed optic with its coloured sectors remains in use as of 2019.Needles Lighthouse Trinity House. Retrieved 1 May 2019 Due to the condition of the chalk strata on which the lighthouse was built, in April 2010 a ¬£500,000 underpinning project was announced, designed to stop the lighthouse falling into the sea. Over a 12-week period from early June, civil marine contractors Nuttall John Martin excavated a trench around the base of the lighthouse, to install a ring of stabilising posts, reinforced with concrete.

It was first published in the UK on 26 August 2011 by Brighton-based publishing house Myriad Editions. The novel draws on the author's personal experiences and research, covering rave culture of the 90s and peacetime life in the British Army.  Plot  The book follows Cal and Manny, two British army chefs stationed in Germany during the early 1990s. The two are quickly bored by the daily comings and goings of military life and begin to take part in the activities of the red-light district in Hamburg, using recreational drugs and attending raves. Very soon their drug usage begins to clash with their military duties and lives, leading to the pair undergoing pressure on their military jobs, friendship, and personal lives.  Critical pesponse  The novel was reviewed in the Scottish and UK national press, with the Glasgow Herald remarking \\"it's about time we had a female Irvine Welsh\\". The Guardian's Catherine Taylor took a more equivocal line, praising the novel's \\"electric\\" narrative, but disliking the pop-cultural references. Mike Cobley of The Brighton Magazine was more impressed, writing \\"It had me gripped from the off, and by its close I felt I'd actually been willingly dragged kicking and screaming though Nina's fictional world, and emerged a more rounded and less judgmental human being for my efforts,\\" adding, \\"Novel of the year? I've yet to read a better one.\\" Lesley McDowell of The Scottish Review of BooksScottish Review of Books wrote that \\"De la Mer does an excellent job producing authentic voices... The depiction of a troubled masculinity in an urban setting is something we have long associated with male Scottish writers, and it‚Äôs encouraging to see a woman take this subject on board.\\" De la Mer also received praise from her peers; novelist John Niven said that it was \\"Mesmerizing. And kind of frightening that a female writer can crawl so far into the male psyche\\", while Ian Rankin tweeted that the book was \\"very original, with really credible characters and a great sense of time and place\\", and Christopher Brookmyre called it \\"as vicariously thrilling in its portrayal of the hedonistic highs as it is honest in its depiction of how transient and empty those good times are\\". Literary bloggers reviewed the book, with Pamreader calling it \\"an outstanding first novel\\", Mardi Stewart of New Books Magazine calling it \\"must read\\"http://www.newbooksmag.com/left- menu/books/recent-reviews.php and Alex Wood of the Caledonian Mercury referring to de la Mer's \\"fine grasp of character and... perceptive engagement with serious issues.\\" References  External links  * Official publisher website * The Scottish Review of Book's website Category:2011 British novels Category:Novels set in Hamburg Category:Scottish novels Category:Fiction set in the 1990s Category:2011 debut novels ","title":"4 a.m. (novel)"},{"id":"33073716","text":"Zeller Bach is a river of Bavaria, Germany.

The SWAN project, which forms a strategic component of the National eGovernance Plan, was approved in March 2005.Ministry of IT's Official page Introduction SWAN is an approved scheme of Department of IT of Government of India claimed to bring speed, efficiency, reliability and accountability of Government-to-government functions. It is one of the core infrastructure components under NeGP and was planned as a converged backbone network for voice, video and data communications across each of the 29 States and 6 Union Territories. Common Service Centers (CSC) schemes would serve as the end delivery points. The Department of Information Technology, Government of India, is the nodal department for each SWAN implementation. The scheme was a ‚Äúcentralized initiative with decentralized implementation‚Äù.CSC connectivity options official page SWANs across the country are expected to cover at least 50000 departmental offices through 1 million (10 lacs) route kilometers of communication links. Objectives * The SWAN aims to create a dedicated closed user group (CUG) network of minimum speed of 2 Mbit/s by connecting around 7500 points of presence (PoPs), providing data, voice & Video connectivity to more than 50,000 government offices. *Efficient Delivery : The network aims at increasing the efficiency of the government delivery mechanism and optimize the performance. *Reliable Connectivity: SWAN would provide reliable, vertical and horizontal connectivity within the State / UT administration and would facilitate electronic transactions between all the government departments. To ensure desired quality of service (QoS) by the network operator and the bandwidth service provider, a third party audit (TPA) mechanism monitors the performance of each SWAN. The third party audit agency performs for five years from the date of final acceptance test of the network and primarily monitor the compliance of the service-level agreement (SLA) which the State / UT would enter with the Network Operator and also with the Bandwidth Service Provider.

Chief Minister N. Chandrababu Naidu and others in the Capital with district officials was conceived and implemented in 1999. This was executed under BOOT Model with the duration of 5+ years by United Telecoms Limited in a record timeAPSWAN. The Network connected the united Andhra Pradesh State Secretariat at Hyderabad with the Other Government offices across the state using leased lines. The project was taken up by the Chandrababu Naidu government as part of \`Vision 2020,Vision 2020 plan for Andhra Pradesh' initiated by him in an effort to bringing in transparency and accountability in state administration. =Gujarat State Wide Area Network= Narendra Modi at GSWAN The GSWAN is the first end-to-end IP network and the largest network in the Asia Pacific region at the time of its implementation in the year 2001-02.

GBBN also involves deployment of most modern networking technologies like Gigabit Passive optical network (GPON), Fiber-to-Home (FTTH) and Fiber-to-Business (FTTB) technologies. Architecture The SWAN is required to be an open standards based, scalable, high capacity network to carry voice, data and video traffic between the designated State Government offices at the State, district and sub division / block levels. The connectivity to the end-user is based on either one or more of the standard technologies such as leased circuits, VSAT, radio frequency dial-up circuits or using appropriate Ethernet ports for the individual offices. The network would have single point gateways of adequate capacity connected to the Internet. The entire SWAN architecture is logically divided into two components. =Vertical component= The vertical component of SWAN is implemented using multi-tier architecture (typically, three-tier) with the State/UT Headquarters (SHQ ) connected to the each District Headquarters (DHQ) which in turn gets connected to the each Block Headquarters (BHQ).NeGP overview *Primary Tier consisting of SHQ *Secondary Tier consisting of DHQs *Tertiary Tier consisting of SDHQs/BHQs =Horizontal component= The Horizontal component of SWAN is composed of horizontal offices spread across the State. All vertical PoPs of SWAN will have various Horizontal connectivity. In horizontal component, the government departments at each tier are connected to the respective PoPs. Implementation  There are two options to the State Governments for State Wide Area Network establishment. The first option is the public‚Äìprivate partnership (PPP) model for operation and maintenance of the Network. In the PPP model State/UT identifies a suitable PPP model and selects an appropriate Network Operator agency through a suitable competitive bid process. The second option is designating National Informatics Centre (NIC) as the prime implementation agency for the SWAN as an integral part of NICNET.Administrative Reforms Commission Report In the NIC model the State / UT designates NIC as the prime implementation agency for SWAN for establishment, operation and maintenance of the Network. NIC in turn would identify a Facility Management Service (FMS) agency for the State / UT concerned, to manage day-to-day management and operation of the network. Department of IT support covers the entire cost of establishment, operation and maintenance of the SWAN for a period of five years on 100% grant basis. A majority of the States / UTs have opted for the PPP model. Bharat Sanchar Nigam Limited has been identified as a preferred bandwidth service provider for SWANs.

The novel was extremely controversial upon release, with many well-known publications attacking its depictions of extreme violence. Critical reaction to it was so strong, in fact, that Ballantine actually stepped back from supporting the novel. Despite initially strong sales, the publisher decided to withdraw it from circulation after the first printings were sold out. In 1999, the novel was picked up for re-publication by Cemetery Dance Publications and was released in an \\"unexpurgated edition\\" that featured some of the gore that Ballantine initially made Ketchum trim.

Espasa Calpe, 2002. . is a village in the province of Tarragona and the autonomous community of Catalonia, Spain. It belongs to Tarragona in the Baix Pened√®s region. According to data from 2009, its population was 2,275. History In the eleventh century, Viscount Guitard built his castle in Albinyana. His son Adalbert, who died during the Reconquista, bequeathed the place to the Monastery of San Cugat. In 1040, the abbot of the monastery ceded the lands to Bernat Otger on condition that he would rebuild the castle and take care of its defense. On being located in close proximity to the border and fearing Saracen attacks, the castle remained uninhabited for a long time. It belonged to the monks of Sant Cugat until the end of the lordships. There are no remains of the castle today although it is believed that it was located in the same place that today forms the center of the village. There were also missing two other fortifications. One is the old Esquena Roja castle that is mentioned in documents from 1173. Shortly thereafter it became a farmhouse. The other fortification is the Tomov√≠ castle, although documents found seem to suggest that it was more of a fortified mansion than a castle itself. Historical buildings The Church of St. Bartholomew of Albinyana seen from the Sant Antoni hermitage. The parish church was dedicated to St. Bartholomew. Although it appeared documented in 1120 as a possession of San Cugat, the current building is from the eighteenth century. It has a semicircular apse with frieze and window. The bell tower has a square base and is topped by the image of a little angel. In Plaza Major there is another remarkable building: Cal Pau Mag√≠. It is a seventeenth- century building with three floors. Inside there is a lobby covered with a vaulted arch and the stairs to the residential area where the date of construction (1637) is inscribed. It is the former residence of the San Cugat administrator. In Les Peces there is a large building known as Cal Gener. It is a building of the fifteenth and sixteenth centuries, rebuilt in the eighteenth century. The windows are surrounded by stone and its fa√ßade presents some interesting sgraffiti restored in 1984. They represent human figures and various architectural and geometric elements. It operates as a house-museum dedicated to rural tourism. The Sant Antoni hermitage is found on the outskirts of Albinyana. It is an eighteenth-century building with a rectangular floor plan and a gable roof. It has a barrel vault and exterior buttresses. It also has an attached tower that serves as a bell tower. It is believed that it was part of the defense structure of the old castle. It is located on a small hill and the entire structure is white. Economy The main economic activity is rainfed agriculture. The main crops are vineyards, grains, almond and hazelnut. Until the mid-twentieth century there was a major industry devoted to manufacturing palm baskets. Local celebrations The town celebrates its festivals in July, coinciding with the Virgen del Carmen, and on August 24, the feast of the San Bartolom√©.

Its situation in the country is in the northeast of Spain. It is located 4 km from Reus, 19 km from Tarragona and 110 km from Barcelona. Geography and climate Almoster's terraine is rugged in the north due to the presence of mountains that are a buttress of the Prades Mountains. All the terraine belongs to the pre-coastal range.

History In 1164, in the record population of La Selva del Campo the town of Mosterio mentioned. In 1204 loco vocato Mosterium was mentioned while the toponym Almoster does not appear in any document before 1582. It is believed that the origin of the name is the Arabic term Munastir which means \\"border convent.\\" During the Middle Ages the town was walled but nothing remains of these walls. It had an important Jewish colony. From 1547 it was part of the Commune of Campo bringing together various municipalities of Campo de Tarragona. The municipality was positioned in favor of the Archduke Charles in 1710. The Carrasclet guerrilla group acted with force in the area, assaulting and killing numerous Castilian troops.

One of the objects that were lost was the altar dedicated to St. Peter, the work of sculptor Balthasar Bonifa√ß. Only baroque relief dedicated to San Isidro was preserved. The town still has several houses with keystones. The one at Cal Llombart has Renaissance style balconies while those at Cal Victor resemble a farmhouse. Almoster celebrates its main festival on July 30, the day of Saints Abdon and Senen. The second festival takes place on September 29, the day of San Miguel.

In 2000, he received his licentiate degree in jurisprudence and social science, licence as solicitor and notary from the Universidad Mariano Galvez. Baldiz√≥n added postgradual studies at the University of Valpara√≠so, Chile, which he completed with an MBA with honorable mentions. In 2004, he obtained his doctorate in law from the Universidad de San Carlos de Guatemala. Afterwards, he took post-doctoral courses at the University of Salamanca, Spain. Political career He was elected to the Congress for the National Advancement Party (PAN) in 2003, but joined the National Unity of Hope (UNE) of √Ålvaro Colom in 2006. Baldiz√≥n was re-elected as a Congressman in 2007. He defected from the governing UNE in 2009 and founded the LIDER party. In the 2011 general election, Manuel Baldiz√≥n was a presidential candidate. His running mate was Raquel Bland√≥n, ex-wife of former president Vinicio Cerezo. In the first round on 11 September he won 1,004,215 votes (22.68%) and qualified for the runoff on 6 November. However he was defeated by the retired general Otto P√©rez Molina of the Patriotic Party in this second turn, winning 1,980,819 votes (46.26%). On 3 May 2015 Baldiz√≥n was named the presidential candidate for LIDER for the 2015 elections. He is accused of receiving money from Odebrecht. In January 2018, he was detained in Miami in response to an Interpol arrest warrant, and will face extradition proceedings. Personal life Manuel Baldiz√≥n is married to Rosa Maria Vargas de Baldiz√≥n, and has two children. In 2011, during his presidential election campaign, his family was threatened by people claiming to be members of Los Zetas. Characterization In press, Manuel Baldiz√≥n has been described as a multimillionaire, a populist, a devout Christian, and a proponent of the death penalty. Special interest has been attracted by his promises to lead Guatemala's football team to the World Cup. Also during his political rallies, he has been noted to bring security weapons of high caliber. Even though Article 125 of \\"The Arms and Ammunition Law\\" of the Guatemalan constitucion it specifies that only the Guatemalan Army is authorized to carry such weapons. Plagiarism On 20 January 2014, Baldizon released a book called Rompiendo Paradigmas (Breaking Paradigms). He held a presentation in Guatemala City only to have the book removed from the bookshelves two days later because evidence was found that a significant portion of the book's contents had been copied from other sources without properly providing reference to them or asking for permission. Baldiz√≥n‚Äôs public relations office quickly responded to the accusations. The office said that, in the book‚Äôs introduction, the author ‚Äúclearly establishes that the book not only contains the author‚Äôs own ideas, but those of many people, including academics and authors.‚Äù They also encouraged readers to take the book as ‚Äúa fusion of ideas,‚Äù and offered apologies to anyone who took offense. However, the magazine ContraPoder showed clear evidence that at least seven pages of the book used materials without proper citation in its bibliography. As a result, Manuel Baldizon's doctorate thesis was reviewed by the media, and it was found that most of it was also plagiarized. Despite the revelations, the Universidad San Carlos de Guatemala said they approved of the thesis after a review process, allowing Baldizon to keep his title.

Life  Elizabeth was a daughter of the Margrave John the Alchemist of Brandenburg-Kulmbach (1406‚Äì1464) from his marriage to Barbara (1405‚Äì1465), daughter of Duke Rudolf III of Saxe-Wittenberg. Elizabeth's father renounced his rights to the succession in Brandenburg and instead received the Franconian possessions of the House of Hohenzollern. Her sisters were Queen Dorothea of Denmark and Marchioness Barbara of Mantua. She married on 27 August 1440 with Duke Joachim I of Pomerania-Stettin (1427‚Äì1451). The marriage was meant to seal a treaty between Brandenburg and Pomerania.Johann Jakob Sell: Geschichte des Herzogthums Pommern, Flittner, 1819, p. 62 Joachim died of the plague in Szczecin, after eleven years of marriage. He had one son: Otto III of Pomerania-Stettin. On 5 March 1454, she married her second husband, Duke Wartislaw X of Pomerania-R√ºgen (1435‚Äì1478). In 1464, her father and all three of her sons died. After the death of Otto III, a war erupted between Pomerania and Brandenburg about the inheritance of the Stettin branch of the family. Her second marriage was a very unhappy one. She felt that her husband had ...planned to kill her, and take her life and limb and, although it would be unchristian and pitiable, revoke her interests and pensions. Because of great distress and poverty, her uncle gave her Lippehne and Berlinchen instead of her father's Arnswalde. For Frederick, the fate of his niece was the motivation to break off negotiations with Wartislaw about Stettin and push through his claims on Pomerania. After mediation by Duke Henry of Mecklenburg- Stargard, Wartislaw accepted Pomerania as a fief of the Electorate of Brandenburg.  Issue  Elisabeth had a son from her first marriage to Joachim: * Otto III (1444‚Äì1464), Duke of Pomerania-Stettin.

Playing for Vukovar '91, Popoviƒá established himself as one of the most talented Croatian footballers of his generation. After impressing in the first two seasons, he was loaned to Bastia. After the transfer to Bastia fell through, Popoviƒá then joined Osijek where he played in only eleven matches before his death in a road accident in the evening of 23 October 2002. Club career Popoviƒá began his football career in the youth squad of the local club Dunav. As a 15-year-old boy he played for the club's first team in the regional league, scoring eight goals in 30 appearances. In 1998, Vukovar '91 youth coach Ivica Rado≈° recognized his talent and brought him to the club's youth team. Three years later, while Vukovar '91 was playing in the Druga HNL, Rado≈° was appointed as manager and promoted Popoviƒá to the first team. Although some believed he was putting too much pressure on the young player, his decision paid off after Popoviƒá scored eleven goals in 14 appearances during the second part of 2000‚Äì01 Druga HNL season. His performances drew attention to a number of first division clubs, but the club decided to keep him. In the first part of the 2001‚Äì02 Druga HNL season Popoviƒá scored 22 goals in 15 appearances, which brought him the top scorer title even though he did not play a single game in the spring. He also played and scored both goals in a 4‚Äì2 defeat in the first round of the 2001‚Äì02 Croatian Cup game against Rijeka. In January 2002, Popoviƒá joined Bastia on a six-month loan until the end of the season. After an unsuccessful period in Bastia where he was featured in only one game coming in as a substitute, Popoviƒá joined Osijek in summer 2002. He made 11 appearances for Osijek and scored 4 goals, the final one just four days before his death. International career Popoviƒá won two caps for Croatia under-21 team, making his debut on 7 May 2002 in a friendly match against Hungary in Zapre≈°iƒá, and scoring the second goal in a 2‚Äì0 victory. His second appearance came against Estonia in the first round of qualifiers for the 2004 UEFA European Under-21 Football Championship when he also found the net from the penalty spot. Death In the evening of 23 October 2002, at the age of 20, Popoviƒá was killed in a road accident that occurred in Borovo, on the state road connecting Vukovar and Dalj. Popoviƒá, who was rushing to his childhood home to watch a Champions League match, lost control over his Golf at high speed and the vehicle hit a light pole. He died instantly, while his 18-year-old friend who was traveling along with him was seriously hurt. According to the police report, Popoviƒá didn't have a driver's license. He was buried three days later at the local cemetery in Dalj.

John of Padua, John Thorpe and Robert Smythson were near contemporaries all working in the currently evolving English Renaissance style in an age of often poor record keeping. As a result, their works have become blurred and there is debate over whose hand was responsible for which building, and John of Padua has become a mysterious and enigmatic figure in English architectural history. Sir John Summerson warned of this phenomenon, however, that \\"when it comes to the test of building accounts we find that very little indeed can be ascribed to foreign hands.\\" Archival references John of Padua was granted the court position of \\"Deviser of Buildings\\" in 1543 for his service to Henry VIII in architecture and music and appears as architectus in the teller's rolls and a contemporary will. The phantomA \\"famous will o' the wisp\\" Sir John Summerson called him, in Architecture in Britain 1530-1830, 4th ed. 1963:347, crediting Horace Walpole with reviving him. John of Padua first resurfaced in the searches made in the 18th century by the engraver and historian George Vertue in records of the Office of Works, as the poet Thomas Gray reported in a letter to his friend Horace WalpoleGray to Walpole, letter of 2 September 1760. Gray prefaced his remarks with the caveat \\"Mr Vertue's MSS (as I do not doubt you have experienced) will often put you on a false scent.\\" It was Vertue who jumped to the conclusion that John of Padua designed Somerset House and Longleat, Burroughs, the Master of Caius College, had told Gray: \\"That it was from the similitude of style in those buildings and in the four gates of Keys College, he had imagined the latter to be also the work of John of Padua, and this was all the proof he had of it. Upon looking at these gates I plainly see that they might very well be the work of one man. From the College books I find that the east side, in which are the Portae Virtutis and Sapientiae, was built in 1566 and 1576.\\" Gray goes on to quote a Latin entry in the books of 1575, ascribing the design of the Gate of Honour (Porta Honoris) to Dr Caius himself instead (quam Doctor Caius (dum viveret) Architecto praescripserat elaborata). From this John of Padua appeared in Walpole's Anecdotes of Painting, with the ascription to him of Somerset House and Longleat. Work and attributions Until the mid-twentieth century, John of Padua was credited with the design of some of England's most notable 16th-century Renaissance domestic buildings. However, much of his attributed work was executed after records of him had ceased, and today the extent of his input is debated. In 1544, Padua was created by royal patent \\"Devisor of His Majesty's Buildings\\", a unique office held by no one else, distinct from that of \\"Surveyor\\", which suggests he was involved in military designs.The Times, Tuesday, Feb 26, 1878; pg. 6; Issue 29188; col F; Grove Art Online, John of Padua The most notable, but still undocumented of Padua's commissions, was the now demolished Somerset House begun in 1546.'Somerset House and King's College', Old and New London: Volume 3 (1878), pp. 89-95. . Accessed 13 September 2011. As the result of the poor documentation surrounding John of Padua, little is reliably known of his work outside of royal patronage.Colvin, 3.44 Today, though as Summerson said, \\"nearly every classical work of the mid-Tudor period has, at some time, been given to him,\\" (Summerson 1963:347) no standing building is solely and reliably attributed to him; Amongst the many buildings where work has been attributed to him are Charlecote House, Holdenby House, Longleat House, Wollaton Hall.The Times, Tuesday, Feb 26, 1878; pg. 6; Issue 29188; col F.The Times, Wednesday, Apr 27, 1836; pg. 6; Issue 16088; col G. and Caius College, Cambridge.The Times, Thursday, Aug 29, 1878; pg. 11; Issue 29346; col D He has also been credited with the design of Montacute HouseThe Times Tuesday, Dec 08, 1931; p. 18; Issue 46000; col A. however, this is unlikely and today, the house is more often attributed to the mason, William Arnold, who was responsible for the designs of Cranborne Manor and Wadham College, Oxford, and had worked at Dunster Castle, also in Somerset. Whatever the truth of Padua's input to these buildings, their common architectural factors are their Renaissance elements. The case for John of Padua being the architect of Longleat House is stronger; The 1946 Times obituary of the Marquess of Bath describes John of Padua as the architect of Bath's country home Longleat House, the house it describes as an \\"Italian palace in an English park.\\"The Times, Monday, Jun 10, 1946; pg. 6; Issue 50473; col D. John of Padua's name is also mentioned in an account book for the building of the house dated 1568.Jackson, p72. The house is, however, also attributed to the architect Robert Smythson, who like Padua often worked in the robust Renaissance style which evolved in England during the 16th century. W. Wilkins thought \\"John of Padua\\" was an alias for the patron of Caius College, Cambridge, John Caius (1510-1573), who had studied at Padua, who returned from a Continental tour in 1543, the year \\"John of Padua\\" appears in the royal records, and who was capable of producing classicising designs, as in the gates to the college he refounded.Summerson 1963:101 and note p 347. It has even been suggested that John of Padua and John Thorpe were one and the same person, which Summerson dismissed. There is currently little conclusive evidence to support other speculations identifying him as various Italian musicians and artisans with similar names.

She was one of the few actors that was allowed to appear in productions in both East and West Germany. She is remembered for her role as Fraulein Rottenmeier in the German TV series Heidi from 1978. This series aired in many countries in Europe during the 1980s and 1990s, and was dubbed into several languages. She is also remembered for having had several roles in the TV series Derrick from 1983 to 1998. Biography Sonja Sutter was born in Freiburg, Germany. She went on the Rudolf Steiner School in Freiburg but ended with only a limited education but she later studied Greek and Latin. At that time she matured into the decision to become an actress. Her stage debut was in 1950 at the Municipal Theater. Later she worked in Stuttgart, at the Schauspielhaus in Hamburg and at the State Theater in Munich. In test shots for a movie by and with Luis Trenker, the DEFA director Slatan Dudow discovered and engaged Sutter for the role as Renate Ludwig in the German movie Frauenschicksale in 1952. After this movie many film offers came from West Germany and Sutter was thus one of the few artists of her time, which worked on two German territories. Her big breakthrough came in 1957 with Lissy, an award-winning movie, which gave Sonja Sutter a certain notoriety in East Germany. During the 1950s she starred in movies like Die Barrings (1955), Star mit fremden Federn (1955), Das Schweigen im Walde (1955), Drei Birken auf der Heide (1956) and Johannisnacht (1956). In 1961 she lost, with the construction of the Berlin Wall, the opportunity to participate in further DEFA films. From 1961 until her death, she lived in Vienna and worked at the Burgtheater. She appeared in 16 TV-movies and in such popular German TV-series like Der Kommissar, Tatort and Derrick. In Derrick she played in 6 episodes from 1983-98. Death Sutter died on 1 June 2017 in Baden bei Wien, Austria, at the age of 86.

This race is held in February on Means Dry Lake at Johnson Valley, California United States. The race is broadcast live on the Internet at www.ultra4racing.com each year. King of The Hammers race week has expanded from one race, Nitto King of The Hammers, held each year on Friday, to a series of 5 races held throughout the week. The races include Can AM UTV Race on Sunday, The Every Man Challenge Race on Wednesday, The Toyo Desert Invitational on Thursday (Unlimited Trophy Trucks), and a new ULTRA4 vs. Rock Bouncer shootout held on Monday night of race week. About the Event There are tens of thousands of spectators who come out to watch King of the Hammers, they all gather at Johnson Valley, a Bureau of Land Management (BLM) area near Yucca Valley. For the week (which happens to be nine days long), the Means Dry Lake bed turns into what the spectators call Hammertown. There are more than 400 teams and 60,000 spectators for this event. Each day there is a new race: dirt bikes, quads, Side by Side or UTVs (Utility Task Vehicle), anyone with a four wheel drive vehicle and the main event Ultra4. The dates for King of the Hammers in 2020 are January 31st Until February 9th.  History  The King of the Hammers was founded by Jeff Knoll and Dave Cole in 2007. Jeff and Dave were in a bar and they planned this race on a napkin.Carey, L. (2014, February 1). The Real Story Behind King of the Hammers - DrivingLine.

There were only 12 teams at this first non-spectator invitational race. They are referred to as the OG13. The OG13 are always invited back to race year after year. All past winners, or Kings, are also invited year after year. The first official race was in 2008 and it was still a non-spectator race. There were approximately 50 drivers in the first official race. Race teams started at 30 second intervals from Means Dry Lake bed and navigated through the desert on a 50-60 mile set race course to their first rock course.

Through the work of California politicians the area called Johnson Valley will stay open to the off-road community. There will be changes made to the riding area, as the Marines did get a large portion of the land. The King of the Hammers course will have to be altered just slightly for 2015 and future King of the Hammers. The compromise was what off-roaders needed in order to still visit their favorite places in Johnson Valley, the base expansion did not take away the most popular attractions on Johnson Valley. The compromise gave roughly 43,000 acres to Johnson Valley, 79,000 acres to the Marines and 53,000 of joint use land. The Marines can use that 53,000 acres for two 30-day periods every year, the rest of the time it will be for the off roaders use. The off-road community will continue to benefit from this compromise even if part of their land was taken away. The community surrounding the Johnson Valley off-road area gains around $71 million a year from off roaders going to and from the area. There was a petition put on the White House web site asking that the Marines not be given the land. One reason that was given was that it was fiscally irresponsible; that expanding such a large base would cost the tax payers for years to come. The Twenty Nine Palms Marine Base is the largest Marine base in the world; the petition gained 29,456 supporters however that was not enough to prevent the compromise from going through. The bill was introduced because the Marines needed the additional land for live-fire training in an area similar to where they will be actually fighting. The compromise was decided upon in the 2014 National Defense Authorization Act (NDAA). There are no reports on the numbers by which the bill passed or how many revisions the bill had before it passed. The bill is H.R. 1676 and the bill is called ‚ÄúJohnson Valley National Off- Highway Vehicle Recreation Area Establishment Act.‚Äù  Race Vehicles And Rules  The race vehicles used at the King of the Hammers are known as Ultra 4 vehicles which are capable of speeds over 100 miles per hour for the desert sections, but still contain gear ratios of 100 to 1 or lower for technical rock crawling. This Ultra4 class is unlimited 4400, and every vehicle is custom fabricated by each team. Traditional design for the front drive-train is a straight axle design, but (IFS) or (Independent front suspension) is becoming a popular design for the high speeds achieved in the wide open plains of the desert. Most racers use highly modified engines that can have up to (800 hp). 40\\" tires are common and racers use beadlock wheels. Competitors start side-by-side, two vehicles every thirty seconds, and must complete the 165-mile course in fewer than 14 hours. Each team must pass through seven checkpoints and at all times while staying within one hundred feet of the centerline of the course. KOH is a no-chase-team race; repairs can only be done on the track by the racers or in the pit area. A last chance qualifier takes place before the race on a two-mile course. 35-50 teams attempt to qualify for the big race.

The Kazakh Diaspora: History and Modernity. - Almaty, 2006. - p. 264-268 Attention of Kazakh immigrants to the United States re-newed somewhere in the mid 1960s after the liberalization of immigration laws. In those years there were about 20 families of Kazakhs in United States. Kazakh diaspora in the United States adds to its ranks through inter-ethnic marriages, and since the breakup of Soviet Union in 1991, has increased due to Diversity Immigrant Visa program, employment-based immigration channels for scientists and engineers, such as H-1B visa and EBGC, and international child adoption. Demography The Kazakhs form communities in places as Reston, Virginia. The Kazakh Americans are observed as mono-ethnic and inter-ethnic marriages. The latter is characterized more for the older generation. Young people trying to find his life partner of the Kazakh media, thus preserving, their ethnic identity. According to conduct research by Dr. Gulnara Mendikulova a number of Kazakh groups emigrated to United States could be identified, such as: * Former Soviet citizens who were captured during World War II and, upon liberation by Allied troops, migrated to the United States; * Kazakhs from Turkey, who emigrated as part of the Turkish labor migration; * Kazakhs from China who migrated via Japan or Taiwan; * Kazakhs who emigrated from the Soviet Union during the existence of the USSR; * Kazakhs from Kazakhstan, who come to study or work; * Those who are married to U.S. citizens. * To this must be adhered the Kazakhs orphans children adopted by American families since the 2000s. Organizations Like many immigrant groups in the United States, the Kazakhs have their own associations. This section lists these organizations, which are known to be active. * The Kazakh American Association, a non-profit organization established in Reston, Virginia and founded to respond to the social, cultural, educational and recreational needs of Kazakh people visiting the United States and to preserve and strengthen the heritage and culture of Kazakhs people in USA. * The Kazakh Aul of the United States, a nonprofit organization that has members in the entire country and is dedicated to Kazakh cultural education and support of the Kazakh population in U.S. The aul runs a summer camp called Zhaliau Heritage Camp focused on bringing Kazakh culture into the lives of Kazakh adoptees in the U.S.. There they can make friends with other adoptees and meet Kazakh adults who serve as role models. The association is founded by Kazakhs and Americans. Visit https://www.kazakhaul.org for more info. Kazakh Aul has been organizing annual summer camps for past several years. * Kazakh Student Association at Indiana University, established in 1996.Mendikulova G.

It is a reboot of the Syndicate series of real-time tactical shooter games developed by Bullfrog Productions. The game was released in February 2012 worldwide. Set in the year 2069, the narrative revolves around Miles Kilo, a EuroCorp agent who must eliminate important personnel from rival corporations; in the process, he discovers the evil, secret practice used by EuroCorp to recruit agents. The game features a large variety of weapons; from standard pistols to the futuristic guns. Kilo is implanted with a computer chip that allows him to access the dataverse and can use hacking to defeat enemies and solve environmental puzzles. Pre-production of the game began in 2007. Electronic Arts approached Starbreeze Studios to revive the franchise because it was impressed with the quality of Starbreeze Studios' previous games and believed they could add \\"style\\" to the series. The game was returned to the drawing board after a year of development, and the co-operative multiplayer mode was added to the main game. The development team hoped the game would appeal to both newcomers and players of the original game; they maintained the theme of the original and drastically changed the gameplay. Richard K. Morgan was hired to write the story for the game. Announced in September 2011, the game was released in February 2012 for Microsoft Windows, PlayStation 3 and Xbox 360. The game received generally positive reviews from critics upon release. Critics praised the gameplay, style, graphics, art direction, artificial intelligence and the co-operative mode, but the game's story was criticized. The game's budget was smaller than the typical AAA video game, and was considered as a commercial failure for the publisher. The game's excessive violence led to the game being banned in Australia. Gameplay Unlike the original series of games, Syndicate is a first-person shooter set in 2069. Players assume control of Miles Kilo, an augmented agent working for EuroCorp in a corrupted, deceitful world in which corporations compete with each other for power. Players can run, jump, slide, hide behind covers, and carry two weapons and grenades to defeat enemies and bosses, who each have unique abilities. The game features 19 weapons, ranging from assault rifles, rocket launchers and machine pistols, to futuristic weapons such as laser rifles, Gauss Guns with bullets that can track enemies automatically, and Riotlance Dark Shooters that can paralyze enemies for a short time. Weapons can be customized and upgraded with 87 attachments and 25 upgrade options. These upgrades may alter the nature of these weapons, transforming standard ammunition to cover-penetrating ammunition. The game also features an \\"execution\\" mechanic, allowing players to perform melee takedowns. The player is trying to hack an enemy Miles has a \\"DART-6\\" chip that grants him hacking and \\"breaching\\" abilities. Some enemies also have this type of chip, and Miles can interact with them. With the chips, objects, collectibles and enemies are automatically tagged and highlighted via augmented reality of the heads-up display. Players can use the \\"breaching\\" abilities to hack into enemies' minds and control their actions. They have access to three options; \\"Backfire\\" that causes enemies' weapons to malfunction and backfire, stunning them; \\"Suicide\\" that causes enemies to kill themselves; and \\"Persuade\\" that leads enemies to defect to the player's side before committing suicide. The game also allows players to locate enemies behind cover with the use of \\"Dart Overlay\\" and slow down time temporarily, which increases the damages dealt by players and their health regeneration rate. Abilities and skills implanted in the chip can be enhanced by collecting and extracting the chips of fallen enemies. The upgrades can boost players' damages and increases their recovery speed. Players are tasked with using the breaching abilities to interact with objects, solve environmental puzzles, strip the special armor of enemies and disarm explosives. The breaching mechanic has a time limit and must be recharged before another activation. The game does not have a competitive multiplayer mode, but it has a cooperative multiplayer mode that pits four players together to complete a nine-mission campaign based on the campaign of the original Syndicate games. Players face enemies that become increasingly difficult to deal with as the game progresses. They can choose from four character classes: Medic, Spec Ops, Assault and Generic, each with different abilities. The breaching mechanic is also present in the mode for defensive and offensive purposes. For instance, they can hack into a turret to disable its armor or heal team-mates using this mechanic. Players receive points as they progress through the game's levels; these points can be used to research new weapons. Synopsis =Setting= In 2017, the mega-corporation EuroCorp is created by a merger between the world's largest corporations. In 2025, EuroCorp releases the DART chip, a neural implant that allows users to access the dataverse, making most electronic devices obsolete. As a result of the DART chip, the world is no longer ruled by national governments but by mega- corporations known as \\"Syndicates\\". However, only half of the world's population embrace the chip; the \\"unchipped\\" are abandoned and denied the benefits afforded by their chipped counterparts. Corporate espionage and corporate warfare for dominance between syndicates becomes the norm, resulting in the creation of \\"agents\\"‚Äîbio-engineered enforcers augmented by a militarized version of the chip who protect the interests of their corporate masters. =Plot= In 2069, Agent Miles Kilo, EuroCorp's latest agent, is equipped with the new prototype DART 6 chip created by EuroCorp scientist Lily Drawl (voiced by Rosario Dawson). After a successful test run of the chip's abilities, EuroCorp CEO Jack Denham (voiced by Brian Cox) assigns him to kill Lily's counterpart, Chang, at the rival syndicate Aspari. Accompanied by his mentor Agent Jules Merit (voiced by Michael Wincott), Kilo attacks the Los Angeles branch of Aspari and corners Chang, who shoots himself. Kilo retrieves Chang's chip and learns from an encrypted conversation that Lily has been sharing information about the DART 6 chip with him. Although shocked by Lily's betrayal, Denham decides to have Kilo and Merit keep Lily under surveillance because she is too valuable to eliminate. As they observe her in her apartment, Lily has an argument with a person named Kris before she is suddenly kidnapped by the syndicate Cayman-Global. Kilo fights off the Cayman- Global forces and follows Lily's abductors to their floating base in the Atlantic Ocean. Kilo kills a major Cayman-Global agent and rescues Lily, and they learn the syndicate is preparing a war against EuroCorp. In New York, Kilo and Lily land in the Downzone where the unchipped, lower-class population lives. After they split up and head towards EuroCorp HQ, Kilo is betrayed by Lily and is sent into a trap with EMP mines, injuring him and disabling his chips. After his chips regain function, Kilo is given orders to either capture or kill Lily. After fighting off subverters, Kilo learns their leader Kris‚ÄîLily's ex-boyfriend and colleague‚Äîis responsible for instigating a war between the syndicates. Kris reveals he started the war so he could hack into the dataverse and kill the syndicates and their chipped populations as punishment for abandoning the unchipped. Lily, who wants to find a peaceful solution and make the syndicates care about the unchipped, opposes the idea. Kilo fights Kris, who attempts to suicide bomb him but kills himself instead. Kilo apprehends Lily; he can either kill her or release her. Lily is captured and a barely-alive Kilo is retrieved. At EuroCorp New York HQ, Denham and Merit believe Kilo is brain-dead and send him to be rebooted while they plan to retrieve Lily's chip and recover useful information on DART 6. Kilo begins to remember his secret past: he learns that Denham led a EuroCorp team to kill his parents and abduct him as a baby because he has genes ideal for becoming an agent. Kilo escapes from his restraints and rescues Lily, who tells Kilo that like him, all of EuroCorp's agents were abducted as children and their memories were modified so they would remain loyal to EuroCorp. Lily created the DART 6 chip, hoping to use it to make the syndicates retain their humanity and care about both chipped and un-chipped civilians, but she realizes she was na√Øve to think that way. As Cayman-Global attacks EuroCorp's New York HQ, Kilo and Lily head towards Denham's office to prevent him from activating the kill switch on their DART chips. Kilo has to fight off both EuroCorp and Cayman- Global forces, as well as several EuroCorp agents. At the top of the tower, he is forced to fight Merit and two other agents, who are under Denham's orders to kill him. Kilo defeats the agents, and overpowers and kills Merit. Kilo then heads towards Denham's office but finds Denham has activated his kill switch, which starts to affect Kilo's movements. Weakened, Kilo confronts Denham, who justifies abducting him as a child. Kilo manages to fight against the kill-switch order and corners Denham, who lets himself fall over a ledge to his death. As the game ends, EuroCorp lies in ruins and Lily gives Kilo a pistol, telling him that he is free from anyone's control. Development The original version of Syndicate is a tactical shooter developed by Bullfrog Productions and produced by Peter Molyneux in 1993. Electronic Arts had wanted to make a new Syndicate game for several years but had not found an opportunity to do so. They hoped to bring new elements and drastically altered gameplay concepts that would suit the franchise's universe. They eventually partnered with Starbreeze, which they recognized as an excellent studio for making first-person video games with distinctive styling. Pre-production of the game began in 2007; it was carried out by a small team of staff members after the studio completed work on The Chronicles of Riddick: Assault on Dark Athena. However, mid way through the game's development, there were also many creative differences between the developer and the publisher, and the two companies suffered from an inharmonious relationship. During the first stage of development, the game had no co-operative multiplayer mode; it focused on the story instead of the cyberpunk element. A year after development began, the game was sent for reworking because the studio thought they had not captured the essence of the Syndicate series. The team had little experience in making a co-operative games due to technological restraints, but decided to experiment with it. The internal reception of the co-op prototype was positive; testers said it fit with the canonical fiction of the franchise. The team had once worked on a competitive multiplayer mode for the game, but thought it was not original enough for inclusion. As the game lacked a cooperative multiplayer element, the developers abandoned the use of an online pass, unlike most EA games at that time. The development team hoped the new title would appeal to both newcomers and fans of the series, be accessible and introduce the franchise to a broader audience. They assumed most players would not have played the original Syndicate games. The team also considered that because of the change in audience tastes and the introduction of new video game platforms, altering the game's perspective to first-person was a correct decision. Turning it into a first-person game was the first design choice made by the team, who hoped allowing players to view from the agent's perspective directly would make the game more immersive for players. The team aimed to replicate the playing experience and difficulty of the extant Syndicate. Starbreeze considered the difficulty of the first game to be part of the franchise's legacy and was worth preserving; they hoped the new game would be challenging enough for players without being frustrating. They introduced a rarely scripted artificial intelligence (AI) into the game. The AI reacts to players' actions and was programmed to relocate itself after being attacked. The new game has less gore than the older one; players still can kill innocent civilians but the team minimized these scenarios, which they thought were part of the game's environment rather than gameplay elements. The game was designed to have a sense of unpredictability so it can be played without confining the player to rules. To achieve this, the company added the breaching system, which adds more varieties of combat and gives players more choices when dealing with the artificial intelligence. The breaching system, which originated as a mini-game, was designed to be simple so it would not interrupt the flow of gameplay. Instead of being purely a first-person shooter, the game features action-adventure elements that allow players to choose their progression and tasks them with solving environmental puzzles. Because the new game is set within a well-established franchise, Starbreeze tried to retain the essence of the world and rebuild these elements. The game's story was written by British science-fiction writer Richard K Morgan, whom the team approached after they read his book Altered Carbon. Syndicate was Morgan's second video-game script after 2011's Crysis 2; he used the original game for reference and included elements that those who had played it would immediately recognize. He preserved the original's dystopian setting and theme, and hoped to use these elements to build a powerful story. Morgan traveled to Sweden to meet Starbreeze's game designers to ensure the game's story would not contradict its overall design. The screenshot shows the art direction of the game's upper zone, which was inspired by a number of futuristic films. The team's goal was to make the game different from contemporaneous first-person shooters. The team ensured the game had its own style that would differentiate itself from other games. This was achieved by using a \\"split-world aspect\\", which divided the game's into two areas, each with a different artstyle. The team added details and aesthetics to the game's three syndicates in the upper zone so they would easily be recognized and be different from each another. \\"The Downzone\\", where non-implanted poor people live, has a different design from the three syndicates. The team took ideas for this area from Mirror's Edge. Both sides were inspired by futuristic films such as Blade Runner, Minority Report and Gattaca. In addition, the split-world concept applies to the gameplay. The Downzone enemies tend to be more aggressive and anti-agents, and some gameplay segments such as the breaching system are inapplicable in such areas. Syndicate uses Starbreeze's in-house game engine, which had been modified for the creation of the game. The team used Beast to achieve global illumination and a realistic lighting system, and a new physics solver to deliver more physical interactions. The team aimed to maintain a consistent visual quality on all the platforms on which the game was released, even though the PC version had the advantage of higher resolution and frame rate. The engine allowed the inclusion of post-process-effects previously used in Assault on Dark Athena, such as motion blur and depth of field. Their artstyle was changed to suit the game's overall style. =Marketing= In 2008, Electronic Arts announced that Starbreeze Studios was working with EA on two projects; one was a new project set in one of EA's older franchises under the name Project Redlime. The name \\"Syndicate\\" was trademarked multiple times by Starbreeze and EA, and a small portion of the game's script was accidentally leaked before the game's official revelation. EA officially revealed the game on 12 September 2011, and announced that it is a reboot for the franchise. A demo of the game, which only included the co-op mode and the \\"Western Europe\\" map, was released for the Xbox Live Marketplace and PlayStation Network on 31 January 2012. The game was announced and shipped in under six months; it was released worldwide on 21 February 2012. Reception =Critical reception= Syndicate received generally positive reviews from critics. The game's story received mixed responses. The reviewer from GameTrailers called the plot predictable and considered several of the game's plot points boring. He praised the game's dialogue for its flow and the backstory presented. The reviewer said the campaign lacked scale but was nevertheless enjoyable and worthwhile playing. He also said the celebrity-led voice cast had successfully brought \\"believability\\" to the game. This was echoed by Jeff Gerstmann from Giant Bomb. In contrast, Martin Gaston from VideoGamer.com said he was disappointed with the campaign and considered it one of the game's biggest flaws. He said the world deserves more exploration than it had in Syndicate, and that the development team did not seem to understand the creative vision of the first version of the game. He also said the emphasis on morals did not excel because it does not fit the game's overall style. He disliked the game's protagonist, who he thought was bland, making him difficult for players to relate to. Xav De Matos from Joystiq said the story is filled with promises but the overall product failed to differentiate itself from other shooters with similar themes. Dan Whitehead from Eurogamer compared it unfavourably to its predecessors and called it unambitious and uninspiring. The overall gameplay received praise. Gaston described the shooting as \\"clever\\" and said the DART-6 breaching abilities have encouraged players to experiment. He said the combination of the breaching system and gunfights made Syndicate better than some other contemporaneous first-person shooters. GameTrailers' reviewer said the DART-6 system provides players with choice and the recharge time of the breaching abilities tasks players with managing a \\"micro-economy\\" that encourages and rewards skills. Both Gaston and GameTrailers said the game missed out opportunities for limiting the use of some of Kilo's powers, which are only shown in cutscenes. Gerstmann liked the game's gameplay and said the control was fun, and that he appreciated the ability to shoot while running. He also admired the breaching abilities and found them satisfying to use. Whitehead shared similar thoughts, saying the breaching abilities tasks players with deploying strategy and make the game deeper than typical run-and- gun video games. The game's AI received praise. GameTrailers' reviewer said enemies \\"know how to die in style\\" and that the boss fights are memorable, even though they can be repetitive. Gaston considered it \\"missed opportunities\\". De Matos appreciated the boss fights and said it was fun and interesting, and tasks players with learning the pattern of these boss fights and using the correct skill to defeat them. bloom effect, which was criticized Reviewers praised the game's graphical quality. Gerstmann said the use of lighting added a unique style to the game. He also liked the depiction of the two major areas of the game, and the game's sounds, which he said suited the tone of the game. Alexandra Hall from GamesRadar said \\"Starbreeze really coaxed some beautiful sights out of aging hardware\\". She added that some players may not be pleased with the game's bloom effects. David Houghton of the same publication said the game is \\"a decent shooter\\" but that its lightbloom effects were \\"nonsensically over-the-top\\". Peter Eykemans from IGN echoed similar thoughts, declaring that the motion bloom and blinding light a problem. However, he admitted that the game \\"constantly looks great\\", and that its simple design has made the game to look very polished. The four- player, co-operative, multiplayer mode received acclaim. Gaston said it was a \\"watered down version of Left 4 Dead\\", but it was nonetheless a fun and pleasant experience for most players. De Matos said the game had encouraged players to work together to defeat enemies and to plan before attacking, which he said had turned the mode to a \\"gratifying\\" experience. He criticized the game's difficulty, which he said does not scale well, and the scripted enemies, which made the game less dynamic. Whitehead highly recommended the co-operative mode, which he thought should have been the game's main focus. He added that it provided more freedom to the players than the campaign. Critics had mixed feelings about the game. Gerstmann said he had an \\"outstanding time\\" with it, and that it had offered an excellent twist to the genre. De Matos said it had successfully branched out the franchise to a new direction, even though it may not be what players of the original Syndicate would expect. However, he said the spirit of the franchise is still maintained and preserved. Gaston said Starbreeze was not able to capture the franchise's vision and that the game was not well-executed overall. Whitehead described the game as \\"fun\\", even though he thought Syndicate was a forgettable experience that will live under the shadow of rival shooters. Syndicate Wars producer and lead programmer Mike Diskett criticized the game stating that it was \\"nothing like the original games.\\" This encouraged him to make a spiritual successor to Syndicate Wars called Satellite Reign, which was a Kickstarter success. =Sales= In an interview with Computer and Video Games, Frank Gibeau of EA said the Syndicate revival had not been as successful as had been hoped, saying, \\"Syndicate was something that we took a risk on. It didn't pay off‚Äîit didn't work.\\" In a 2012 interview with Edge, Mikael Nermark, CEO of Starbreeze Studios, said the game sold around 150,000 copies worldwide. According to Nermark, the budget for creating this game was less than those of other triple-A video games; he also said that despite the poor commercial performance, the team was still proud of the final product. =Australian censorship= On 20 December 2011, it was reported that Syndicate has been refused classification by the Australian Classification Board. The board was especially critical of what it considered to be the game's excessive violence: explicit depictions of dismemberment, decapitation, exposed flesh and bone from injuries; and copious blood spray.

Her work marks a fundamental reference point in the art of the 1970s and 1980s. Photomontages of her own body and face sewn over or collaged with black thread are the most well-known works of the German artist.  Education  From 1967 to 1972 she studied with Hans Thiemann, Kurt Kranz, Rudolf Hausner and David Hockney at the Academy of Fine Arts Hamburg in Germany, 1972 at the Academy of Fine Arts Vienna in Austria. In 1973 she received a DAAD scholarship for Milan in Italy.  Life and work  Since 1973 she has freelanced, first in the sphere of painting and graphic art, then from 1975 actions (\\"permanente demonstration\\") and first photography and videoworks. In Soltau‚Äôs own words ‚ÄúPermanente Demonstration‚Äú is ‚Äúan attempt to trigger states of consciousness through realization of an image in real life, i.e. make an image physically. The line, becomes a realized line, the person is part of the picture. Line and person are not two opposite things but one reality‚Äù. In \\"Selbst\\" (self) the artist ties up her face with tight threads of black silk, just like a cocoon, of which she makes a photographic record that is subsequently stitched by following a geometric pattern that resembles a sign. The result is a self-harming self-portrait, an effigy that has been prevented, inhibited, forced into silence. Annegret Soltau writes her story as a woman on the blank page of her face; it is a history of conflict, impulsive reactions to the family environment, to the marginal position of women in the social context, to gender pressures and discrimination. As it cuts into the sensitive skin of her face, the thread distorts its shape but also enhances its beauty. In her Video-Performances and Phototableaus she wanted to make intimate processes like sexuality, pregnancy, birth, abortion, sickness and violence to become subjects of the arts. From 1977 to 1980 she dealt with her pregnancies and the birth of her two children. In the video \\"being pregnant\\" she observed her own body over the whole time period of nine months. She pointed out physical changes as well as psychological ones. The artist called the phases: panic, doubt, hope, loneliness, separation, oppression, reminiscence, oration, being-born. She asked herself the question: how can I combine creativity and motherhood without losing myself as my own person. The most complex and elaborate series of works is \\"generativ\\" (1994-2005), where she composes photographs of the naked bodies of her \\"female chain\\": her grandmother, her mother, her daughter and herself. \\"Generativ\\" shows the whole span of bodily change between young and old, between the fading body of age and the emerging body in puberty. \\"My main interest is the integration of body process in my work, in order to connect body and spirit as equal parts\\" (Annegret Soltau) Over the years, her face has transformed metaphorically into letters, numbers, data and paper documents (identity cards, passports, bank statements, cash machine receipts, dentist‚Äôs bills).  Honours  In 1982 she was awarded a working scholarship by the Arts Society of Bonn, in 1986/87 the Villa Massimo prize in Rome in Italy, in 1998 the Maria Sybilla Merian Prize (in the State of Hesse)\\"Vita\\" Annegret Soltau and in 2000 the Wilhelm-Loth- prize of the City of Darmstadt, where she is living.

Cases date back to 2004, with a number of major incidents occurring in 2008. The death of Joshua Titcombe and a suppressed report by the Morecambe Bay NHS Trust brought the spotlight onto FGH in 2011 when investigations began. Claims of medical records being intentionally destroyed alongside the discovery of major wrongdoing on behalf of midwives led to threats of closure to the maternity ward. The scandal was covered in a 2012 BBC Panorama episode titled \\"How Safe is Your Hospital?\\" with the Stafford Hospital scandal. In June 2013, Cumbria Constabulary announced they would only be pursuing the Titcombe case and that other complaints would not proceed to a criminal prosecution. Later in the same month, the British medical community was rocked by allegations that the Care Quality Commission (CQC), which took part in investigations, was fully aware of concerns of maternity care at FGH as early as 2008 and gave the hospital a clean bill of health in 2010, having destroyed evidence to the contrary. The independently issued Morecambe Bay Investigation Report was published in 2015, stating a 'lethal mix' of 'serious and shocking' failings had led to the deaths of eleven babies and one mother. The report recommended a national review of maternity care and thorough investigations of staff members involved by the General Medical Council and Nursing and Midwifery Council. Numerous investigations have discovered serious failings, corruption and cover-ups on every level; investigations continue and no individual has been held accountable for the deaths at FGH. The criminal investigation into the scandal was concluded in April 2015 with no prosecutions. Notable cases Police did not announce the number of deaths being investigated but six known are listed below. Several families of the victims have revealed that they are suing the University Hospitals of Morecambe Bay NHS Trust, claiming clinical negligence. The claim of Carl Hendrickson (husband and father of Nittaya and Chester Hendrickson respectively) alone is expected to exceed ¬£50,000. * Niran Aukhaj collapsed and died in April 2008 also claiming the life of her unborn child. An inquest revealed that FGH failed to monitor her high blood pressure a week earlier. * In July 2008, Thai-born Nittaya Hendrickson and her son died at FGH after she suffered an amniotic fluid embolism. Her husband claims records showing her heart rate during the birth have gone missing. * In September 2008, Liza Brady's newborn baby died shortly before birth. It was alleged that midwives delayed in delivering him, despite signs of distress. * An initial inquest into the death of nine-day-old Joshua Titcombe at FGH revealed the infection that killed him could easily have been treated if noticed by midwives. His parents Hoa and James claim that their pleas for antibiotics to be given to their son were ignored. Cumbria Constabulary and CQC investigations In September 2011, Cumbria Constabulary assigned 15 officers to investigate the deaths of at least four babies and two mothers during 2008 at FGH; it is alleged that midwives at the hospital destroyed medical records to cover up their mistakes. On 13 September, several national newspapers reported that race played a role in the hospital's wrongdoings after it was revealed 83 percent of serious incidents at FGH in 2008 involved ethnic minorities, while only 2 percent of Barrow's population is non-white. Cumbria Constabulary have however refused to pursue the racial angle of the crime. Other bodies involved in the investigation include health watchdog, the Care Quality Commission and the Nursing and Midwifery Council. A report by the CQC threatened to close the maternity ward at FGH by 21 November 2011 if major changes were not implemented. The NMC identified 19 areas requiring urgent improvement, including governance, risk management, collaborative working and leadership. In late October 2011, during the height of the investigation, leaked figures revealed that FGH had the worst mortality rate of any hospital in England. The mortality ratio for the University Hospitals of Morecambe Bay NHS Trust (which also runs hospitals in Lancaster and Kendal) stood at 124, significantly higher than national average. It is suspected that up to 16 babies and two mothers died at FGH due to poor care with over 30 claims for compensation; despite this Cumbria police narrowed their investigation in 2013 to focus on the death of just one child and decided not to prosecute over any of the other deaths. =Care Quality Commission controversy= In August 2012, new CQC chief executive David Behan commissioned a report by management consultants Grant Thornton. The report examining the CQCs response to complaints about baby and maternal deaths and injuries at Furness General Hospital, was instigated by a complaint from a member of the public and \\"an allegation of a 'cover-up', submitted by a whistleblower at CQC.\\" It was published on 19 June 2013. Among the findings, the CQC was \\"accused of quashing an internal review that uncovered weaknesses in its processes\\" and had allegedly \\"deleted the review of their failure to act on concerns about University Hospitals of Morecambe Bay NHS Trust\\". One CQC employee claimed that he was instructed by a senior manager \\"to destroy his review because it would expose the regulator to public criticism\\". The report concluded \\"We think that the information contained in the [deleted] report was sufficiently important that the deliberate failure to provide it could properly be characterised as a 'cover-up'\\". In June 2013, following a series of critical reports and facing 30 civil claims for negligence, it was announced that the organisation would be subjected to a public inquiry. David Prior, who was appointed CQC Chair in February 2013, admitted that the organisation was \\"not fit for purpose\\". Jeremy Hunt, the Secretary of State for Health, issued an official apology in the House of Commons for \\"the appalling suffering\\" of the 30 families involved. On 20 June 2013, Behan and Prior agreed to release the names of redacted senior managers within the Grant Thornton report, who were alleged had suppressed the internal CQC report. The people named were the former CQC Chief Executive Cynthia Bower, deputy CEO Jill Finney and media manager Anna Jefferson, who were all said by Grant Thornton to be present at a meeting where deletion of a critical report was allegedly discussed. Bower and Jefferson immediately denied being involved in a cover-up. In a later interview with The Independent, Bower accused the CQC of commissioning \\"a report... that was neither fair nor reasonable and \\"against natural justice\\", but admitted that the CQC inspection process, whilst she was CEO, had failed to uncover the failings at Morecambe Bay trust. She said: \\"We should have registered it with conditions.\\". Finney brought an action for libel against the commission, denying that she had been part of a cover-up. The commission agreed in an out-of-court settlement to pay her ¬£60,000 in damages and ¬£510,000 towards her legal fees. Morecambe Bay Investigation The Morecambe Bay Investigation Report was the independent public inquiry conducted by Bill Kirkup on behalf of the government into maternity and neonatal services and care at FGH, between 2004 and 2013. It was published in March 2015 with a damning verdict. The report stated the deaths of eleven babies and one mother at FGH were avoidable and a result of a 'lethal mix' of failings. Amongst the findings were that the maternity unit had been 'dysfunctional', with 'substandard care' provided by staff 'deficient in skills and knowledge'. Working relationships between doctors and midwives had been extremely poor, there had been 'significant organisational failure' on behalf of the Care Quality Commission and the North West Health Authority and Parliamentary and the Health Services Ombudsman had failed to take opportunities that could have brought the problems to light sooner. The report also stated that the Department of Health had been reliant on misleadingly optimistic assessments from regulators; 44 recommendations were made in the report, ranging from action to be taken on midwives involved, to national reviews on maternity care. The Nursing and Midwifery Council was criticised by Kirkup, for the way it handled the investigation resulting from events at University Hospitals of Morecambe Bay NHS Foundation Trust, relating to misconduct by two midwives involved in the Furness General Hospital scandal. He said their response to his report had \\"fallen far short of expectations\\". The Professional Standards Authority said the regulator's investigation was \\"deficient\\" because evidence was not presented to the panel by the council even though it had it in its possession. Improvements In November 2011, the University Hospitals of Morecambe Bay NHS Trust announced plans to replace outdated equipment and rebuild FGH's maternity ward at a cost of ¬£5 million. A random inspection in September 2012 by the CQC found that recommended changes had been made and found quality and safety standards being met.

Quinlan's work has been published in many books and magazines, as well as on various online poetry databases. His writing is based on his real life experiences as a rancher, and really gives his poetry a lifelike feel. Early life and education Vess Quinlan was born in Eagle, Colorado on November 23, 1940, and is part of the fourth generation on both sides of his family to spend most of their lives working at raising livestock in rural Colorado. His initial interest in poetry was sparked during a year-long bout with polio as a boy in 1951. During his time confined to bed, he began reading and writing poetry of the Cowboy variety. It seems only natural that his style of choice was western, due to the fact that he had worked as a ranch chore boy and cattle hand since the age of 15, when he ran away from home. From the time Quinlan started high school, it is believed that he attended at least 9 different high schools while doing chores morning and night for ranch families. He then worked mostly as a ranch hand until he found a partner able to purchase a farm and ranch near San Acacio, Colorado. He still lives on the place, and has since 1970, but is no longer involved in the operation. Beginnings in poetry As mentioned above, Vess Quinlan's initial interest in poetry was sparked while being contained indoors with polio for nearly an entire year in 1951. During this time of confinement, he began reading poetry with themes related to ranching and farming, and started to write some of his own. As time progressed, he began writing more and more poetry, and as word spread about the quality and nature of his work, his reputation was built into what it is today. Example of works =Sold Out= The worst will come tomorrow When we load the saddle horses. We are past turning back; The horses must be sold. The old man turns away, hurting, As the last cow is loaded. I hunt words to ease his pain But there is nothing to say. He walks away to lean On a top rail of the corral And look across the calving pasture Toward the willow grown creek. I follow. Absently mimicking his walk, And stand a post away. We don‚Äôt speak of causes or reasons. Don‚Äôt speak at all; We just stand there Leaning on the weathered poles, While the shadows consume the pasture. Sold Out is one of Quinlan's more well known poems. This is just one example of his ability to give an outsider such a vivid picture of what life is really like for a cowboy, or rancher. Cowboy poetry conventions Until very recently, Cowboy poetry was an aspect of the Western Lifestyle that simply was not prevalent. This all changed in January 1985, when the first Cowboy Poets gathering was held in Elko, Nevada. It was at this time, that the genre really took off, and became more widely recognized and appreciated.

It is a theoretical method made by Joel Sternheimer, who is a physicist, composer and mathematician. (There wasn't any existing experiment for this theory.) The first published reference to protein music in the scientific literature is a paper co-authored by a member of The Shamen from 1996 . Theory In G√∂del, Escher, Bach, Douglas Hofstadter draws similarities and analogies between genes and music. It even proposes that meaning is constructed in protein and in music.Hofstadter (1980) p525: \\"Music is not a mere linear sequence of notes. Our minds perceive pieces of music on a level far higher than that. We chunk notes into phrases, phrases into melodies, melodies into movements, and movements into full pieces. similarly proteins only make sense when they act as chunked units. Although a primary structure carries all the information for the tertiary structure to be created, it still 'feels' like less, for its potential is only realized when the tertiary structure is actually physically created.\\" The ideas that supports the possibility of creating harmonic musics using this method are: * The repetition process governs both the musical composition and the DNA sequence construction. * The conformations and energetics of the protein secondary and tertiary structures at the atomic level. * Pink noise (the correlation structure \\"1/f spectra\\") have been found in both musical signals and DNA sequences. * Models with duplication and mutation operations, such as the \\"expansion-modification model\\" are able to generate sequences with 1/f spectra. * When DNA sequences are converted to music, it sounds musical.\\"DNA Music\\", The Robert S. Boas Center for Genomics and Human Genetics. * Human Genome Project has revealed similar genetic themes not only between species, but also between proteins. Musical renditions of DNA and proteins is not only a music composition method, but also a technique for studying genetic sequences. Music is a way of representing sequential relationships in a type of informational string to which the human ear is keenly attuned. The analytic and educational potential of using music to represent genetic patterns has been recognized from secondary school to university level. Practice * Examples of simple protein structures converted to midi music fileexamples from Nucleic acid database show the independence of protein music from musical instrument, and the convenience of using protein structures in music composition. * The software Algorithmic arts can convert raw genetic data (freely available for download on the web) to music. There are many examples of musics generated by this software, both by designer\\"Genetic Music From DNA and Protein \\", AlgoArt.com. and by others. * Several people have composed musics using protein structure, and several students and professors have used music as a method to study proteins.

Bliss was born in New York City on September 9, 1879, the daughter of U.S. Congressman Demas Barnes (1827‚Äì1888), and Anna Dorinda Blaksley Barnes (1851‚Äì1935). She was the stepsister of Cora (Kora) Fanny Barnes (1858‚Äì1911). When Anna Barnes remarried in 1894, Mildred Barnes became the stepdaughter of William Henry Bliss (1844-1932) and the stepsister of Robert Woods Bliss (1875‚Äì1962) and Annie Louise Bliss Warren (1878‚Äì1964). Mildred Barnes was educated at Miss Porter's School in Farmington, Connecticut, and, reportedly, at private schools in France. She was fluent in French and was proficient in Spanish, German, and Italian. She acquired a working farm in Sharon, Connecticut, in 1898, which she sold in 1909. Mildred Barnes married her stepbrother, Robert Woods Bliss, on April 14, 1908. Because of his diplomatic postings, they lived in Brussels (1908‚Äì1909), Buenos Aires (1909‚Äì1912), Paris (1912‚Äì1919), Washington, D.C. (1919‚Äì1923), Stockholm (1923‚Äì1927), and Buenos Aires again (1927‚Äì1933) before returning, in retirement, to Washington, D.C. (1933). Mildred Barnes Bliss was the principal beneficiary of the estates of her stepsister, Cora Barnes, in 1911, and of her mother, Anna Barnes Bliss, in 1935. This wealth was largely based on Demas Barnes‚Äôs investments in The Centaur Company, the manufacturers of the laxative Fletcher‚Äôs Castoria, the success of which had made him a wealthy man. Bliss' former home, Dumbarton Oaks, in Washington, D.C. While living in Paris (1912‚Äì1919), the Blisses became reacquainted with Mildred Bliss‚Äôs childhood friend, the American Royall Tyler (1884‚Äì1953), who was living in Paris with his wife, Elisina Palamidessi de Castelvecchio Tyler (1878‚Äì1959). Tyler introduced the Blisses to important Parisian art dealers and nurtured their growing interest as art collectors, especially of Byzantine and pre-Columbian artworks. At the outbreak of the First World War, the Blisses helped found the American Ambulance Field Service (later the American Field Service) in France in 1914, to which they donated an entire section of 23 ambulances and three staff cars. The Blisses opened and equipped a central depot in Paris, the ‚ÄúService de Distribution Am√©ricaine,‚Äù for the distribution of medical and surgical supplies and clothing. As vice-president of the Comit√© Franco-Am√©ricain pour la Protection des Enfants de la Fronti√®re, beginning in 1914 Mildred Bliss helped establish centers in France for the care of Belgian and French children orphaned or displaced during the war. When America entered the war, Mildred Bliss served as chairman of the executive board of the American Red Cross‚Äôs Woman‚Äôs War Relief Corps in France. For her work during the First World War, she was made a chevalier of the French Legion of Honor. The Blisses purchased their home, Dumbarton Oaks, in 1920, and also maintained apartments in Paris, at 4 rue Henri Moissan, and New York City, first at 969 Park Avenue in 1922 and then at 104 East 68th Street. Mildred Bliss was elected a member of The Colonial Dames in the State of New York in 1921. In celebration of the Blisses‚Äô thirtieth wedding anniversary, Mildred Bliss commissioned Igor Stravinsky‚Äôs Dumbarton Oaks Concerto, which was premiered at Dumbarton Oaks on May 8, 1938. She served on the Board of Trustees of the Museum of Modern Art in New York. After giving Dumbarton Oaks to Harvard University in 1940, the Blisses resided at 1537 28th Street, N.W., Washington, D.C.

It was repopulated in 1843, but then abandoned during the Paraguayan War in the 1860s. It was also known as Tebego, Etevego, Esteveg√≥, Villa del Divino Salvador (Village of the Divine Savior), or San Salvador. History Tevego was founded by order of Jose Gaspar Rodriguez de Francia in 1813 as a colony for mulattoes to defend the inhospitable northern borders of Paraguay. It came under constant attack from Guaycur√∫ natives,Peque√±a Enciclopedia de Historias Min√∫sculas del Paraguay and the garrison and their families were moved to nearby settlements. From then on it became a prison camp, mostly for vagrant and petty criminal mulattoes who willingly volunteered for hard labour to shorten their sentences. However, as attacks became more frequent, Tevego was finally evacuated by de Francia, its inmates deported to prisons in the nearby city of Concepci√≥n. The Scottish writer and merchant John Parish Robertson, who lived in Paraguay and worked closely with de Francia, mentions in his book Francia's Reign of Terror, Being the Continuation of Letters On Paraguay, that Tevego \\"is a place, of the atmosphere is one great mass of malaria, and the heat suffocating, - where the surrounding country is uninterrupted marsh - where venomous insects and reptiles abound, - and where the fiercest and yet unsubdued tribes of Indians are making continual in-roads. No huts but those constructed in the boughs of trees, or by a few hides and mats, are to be seen; no provisions are to be obtained but those from the Portuguese, or the chase; and no protection is to be afforded but that of a small guard of militia, to awe and tyrannise of the colonists. Many would prefer confinement in the public prison to banishment to Tevego.\\" In 1843, three years after de Francia's death, Tevego was re-inhabited by orders of Carlos Antonio Lopez, Paraguay's new president, this time renamed Villa del Divino Salvador (Village of the Divine Savior), later shortened to San Salvador. Still unsuccessful, the settlement was destroyed by the Brazilians during the Paraguayan War, its inhabitants fleeing. Location There is no exact record of the location of Tevego, but according to a map dated 1860, Tevego was situated on the Argentine border, close to the Bolivian border, roughly 70 miles southwest from San Ignacio. Literary references Tevego is mentioned frequently by the character of de Francia in Augusto Roa Bastos‚Äôs novel I, the Supreme. He keeps mentioning a phenomenon called the stones of Tevego, which is later to be revealed that Tevego was evacuated because its inhabitants turned to stone.

It was the first archaeon to have its complete genome sequenced. The sequencing identified many genes unique to the archaea. Many of the synthesis pathways for methanogenic cofactors were worked out biochemically in this organism, as were several other archaeal-specific metabolic pathways.  History  Methanocaldococcus jannaschii was isolated from a submarine hydrothermal vent at Woods Hole Oceanographic Institution.  Sequencing  Methanocaldococcus jannaschii was sequenced by a group at TIGR led by Craig Venter using whole-genome shotgun sequencing. Methanocaldococcus jannaschii represented the first member of the Archaea to have its genome sequenced. According to Venter, the unique features of the genome provided strong evidence that there are three domains of life.  Taxonomy  Methanocaldoccus jannaschii is a member of the genus Methanocaldococcus (previously a part of Methanococcus) and is therefore sometimes referred to as a \\"class I\\" methanogen (e.g. ).  Biology and biochemistry  Methanocaldococcus jannaschii is a thermophilic methanogen, meaning it grows by making methane as a metabolic byproduct. It is only capable of growth on carbon dioxide and hydrogen as primary energy sources, unlike many other methanococci (such as Methanococcus maripalidus) which can also use formate as a primary energy source. The genome includes many hydrogenases, such as a 5,10-methenyltetrahydromethanopterin hydrogenase, a ferredoxin hydrogenase (eha), and a coenzyme F420 hydrogenase. Proteomic studies showed that M. jannaschii contains a large number of inteins: 19 were discovered by one study. Many novel metabolic pathways have been worked out in M. jannaschii, including the pathways for synthesis of many methanogenic cofactors, riboflavin, and novel amino acid synthesis pathways. Many information processing pathways have also been studied in this organism, such as an archaeal-specific DNA polymerase family..

It is named after Norbert Sauer and Saharon Shelah, who published it independently of each other in 1972... The same result was also published slightly earlier and again independently, by Vladimir Vapnik and Alexey Chervonenkis, after whom the VC dimension is named.. In his paper containing the lemma, Shelah gives credit also to Micha Perles, and for this reason the lemma has also been called the Perles‚ÄìSauer‚ÄìShelah lemma.. Buzaglo et al. call this lemma \\"one of the most fundamental results on VC-dimension\\", and it has applications in many areas. Sauer's motivation was in the combinatorics of set systems, while Shelah's was in model theory and that of Vapnik and Chervonenkis was in statistics. It has also been applied in discrete geometry. and graph theory.. Definitions and statement If \\\\textstyle \\\\mathcal{F}=\\\\\\\\{S_1,S_2,\\\\dots\\\\\\\\} is a family of sets, and T is another set, then T is said to be shattered by \\\\mathcal{F} if every subset of T (including the empty set and T itself) can be obtained as an intersection T\\\\cap S_i between T and a set in the family. The VC dimension of \\\\mathcal{F} is the largest cardinality of a set shattered by \\\\mathcal{F}. In terms of these definitions, the Sauer‚ÄìShelah lemma states that if \\\\mathcal{F} is a family of sets with n distinct elements such that \\\\textstyle \\\\mathcal{F} > \\\\sum_{i=0}^{k-1} {\\\\binom{n}{i}}, then \\\\mathcal{F} shatters a set of size k. Equivalently, if the VC dimension of \\\\mathcal{F} is k, then \\\\mathcal{F} can consist of at most \\\\textstyle \\\\sum_{i=0}^{k} {\\\\binom{n}{i}} =O(n^k) sets. The bound of the lemma is tight: Let the family \\\\mathcal{F} be composed of all subsets of \\\\\\\\{1,2,\\\\dots n\\\\\\\\} with size less than k. Then the size of \\\\mathcal{F} is exactly \\\\textstyle \\\\sum_{i=0}^{k-1} {\\\\binom{n}{i}} but it does not shatter any set of size k.. The number of shattered sets A strengthening of the Sauer‚ÄìShelah lemma, due to , states that every finite set family \\\\mathcal{F}shatters at least \\\\mathcal{F} sets.. As cited by . This immediately implies the Sauer‚ÄìShelah lemma, because only \\\\sum_{i=0}^{k-1} {\\\\tbinom{n}{i}} of the subsets of an n-item universe have cardinality less than k. Thus, when \\\\mathcal{F}>\\\\sum_{i=0}^{k-1} {\\\\tbinom{n}{i}}, there are not enough small sets to be shattered, so one of the shattered sets must have cardinality at least k. For a restricted type of shattered set, called an order-shattered set, the number of shattered sets always equals the cardinality of the set family. Proof Pajor's variant of the Sauer‚ÄìShelah lemma may be proved by mathematical induction; the proof has variously been credited to Noga Alon. or to Ron Aharoni and Ron Holzman.. Base: every family of only one set shatters the empty set. Step: Assume the lemma is true for all families of size less than \\\\mathcal{F} and let \\\\mathcal{F} be a family of two or more sets. Let x be an element that belongs to some but not all of the sets in \\\\mathcal{F}. Split \\\\mathcal{F} into two subfamilies, of the sets that contain x and the sets that do not contain x. By the induction assumption, these two subfamilies shatter two collections of sets whose sizes add to at least \\\\mathcal{F}. None of these shattered sets contain x, since a set that contains x cannot be shattered by a family in which all sets contain x or all sets do not contain x. Some of the shattered sets may be shattered by both subfamilies. When a set S is shattered by only one of the two subfamilies, it contributes one unit both to the number of shattered sets of the subfamily and to the number of shattered sets of \\\\mathcal{F}. When a set S is shattered by both subfamilies, both S and S\\\\cup\\\\\\\\{x\\\\\\\\} are shattered by \\\\mathcal{F}, so S contributes two units to the number of shattered sets of the subfamilies and of \\\\mathcal{F}. Therefore, the number of shattered sets of \\\\mathcal{F} is at least equal to the number shattered by the two subfamilies of \\\\mathcal{F}, which is at least \\\\mathcal{F}. A different proof of the Sauer‚ÄìShelah lemma in its original form, by P√©ter Frankl and J√°nos Pach, is based on linear algebra and the inclusion‚Äìexclusion principle. Applications The original application of the lemma, by Vapnik and Chervonenkis, was in showing that every probability distribution can be approximated (with respect to a family of events of a given VC dimension) by a finite set of sample points whose cardinality depends only on the VC dimension of the family of events. In this context, there are two important notions of approximation, both parameterized by a number Œµ: a set S of samples, and a probability distribution on S, is said to be an Œµ-approximation of the original distribution if the probability of each event with respect to S differs from its original probability by at most Œµ. A set S of (unweighted) samples is said to be an Œµ-net if every event with probability at least Œµ includes at least one point of S. An Œµ-approximation must also be an Œµ-net but not necessarily vice versa. Vapnik and Chervonenkis used the lemma to show that set systems of VC dimension d always have Œµ-approximations of cardinality O(\\\\tfrac{d}{\\\\epsilon^2}\\\\log\\\\tfrac{d}{\\\\epsilon}). Later authors including . and . similarly showed that there always exist Œµ-nets of cardinality O(\\\\tfrac{d}{\\\\epsilon}\\\\log\\\\tfrac{1}{\\\\epsilon}), and more precisely of cardinality at most \\\\tfrac{d}{\\\\epsilon}\\\\ln\\\\tfrac{1}{\\\\epsilon}+\\\\tfrac{2d}{\\\\epsilon}\\\\ln\\\\ln\\\\tfrac{1}{\\\\epsilon}+\\\\tfrac{6d}{\\\\epsilon}. The main idea of the proof of the existence of small Œµ-nets is to choose a random sample x of cardinality O(\\\\tfrac{d}{\\\\epsilon}\\\\log\\\\tfrac{1}{\\\\epsilon}) and a second independent random sample y of cardinality O(\\\\tfrac{d}{\\\\epsilon}\\\\log^2\\\\tfrac{1}{\\\\epsilon}), and to bound the probability that x is missed by some large event E by the probability that x is missed and simultaneously the intersection of y with E is larger than its median value. For any particular E, the probability that x is missed while y is larger than its median is very small, and the Sauer‚ÄìShelah lemma (applied to x\\\\cup y) shows that only a small number of distinct events E need to be considered, so by the union bound, with nonzero probability, x is an Œµ-net. In turn, Œµ-nets and Œµ-approximations, and the likelihood that a random sample of large enough cardinality has these properties, have important applications in machine learning, in the area of probably approximately correct learning.. In computational geometry, they have been applied to range searching, derandomization,. and approximation algorithms... use generalizations of the Sauer‚ÄìShelah lemma to prove results in graph theory such as that the number of strong orientations of a given graph is sandwiched between its numbers of connected and 2-edge-connected subgraphs.

There are several proofs that would be far longer than this if the details of the computer calculations they depend on were published in full. Long proofs The length of unusually long proofs has increased with time. As a rough rule of thumb, 100 pages in 1900, or 200 pages in 1950, or 500 pages in 2000 is unusually long for a proof. *1799 The Abel‚ÄìRuffini theorem was nearly proved by Paolo Ruffini, but his proof, spanning 500 pages, was mostly ignored and later, in 1824, Niels Henrik Abel published a proof that required just six pages. *1890 Killing's classification of simple complex Lie algebras, including his discovery of the exceptional Lie algebras, took 180 pages in 4 papers. *1894 The ruler-and-compass construction of a polygon of 65537 sides by Johann Gustav Hermes took over 200 pages. *1905 Emanuel Lasker's original proof of the Lasker‚ÄìNoether theorem took 98 pages, but has since been simplified: modern proofs are less than a page long. *1963 Odd order theorem by Feit and Thompson was 255 pages long, which at the time was over 10 times as long as what had previously been considered a long paper in group theory. *1964 Resolution of singularities Hironaka's original proof was 216 pages long; it has since been simplified considerably down to about 10 or 20 pages. *1966 Abyhankar's proof of resolution of singularities for 3-folds in characteristic greater than 6 covered about 500 pages in several papers. In 2009, Cutkosky simplified this to about 40 pages. *1966 Discrete series representations of Lie groups. Harish-Chandra's construction of these involved a long series of papers totaling around 500 pages. His later work on the Plancherel theorem for semisimple groups added another 150 pages to these. *1968 the Novikov-Adian proof solving Burnside's problem on finitely generated infinite groups with finite exponents negatively. The three-part original paper is more than 300 pages long.

Long computer calculations There are many mathematical theorems that have been checked by long computer calculations. If these were written out as proofs many would be far longer than most of the proofs above. There is not really a clear distinction between computer calculations and proofs, as several of the proofs above, such as the 4-color theorem and the Kepler conjecture, use long computer calculations as well as many pages of mathematical argument. For the computer calculations in this section, the mathematical arguments are only a few pages long, and the length is due to long but routine calculations. Some typical examples of such theorems include: *Several proofs of the existence of sporadic simple groups, such as the Lyons group, originally used computer calculations with large matrices or with permutations on billions of symbols. In most cases, such as the baby monster group, the computer proofs were later replaced by shorter proofs avoiding computer calculations. Similarly, the calculation of the maximal subgroups of the larger sporadic groups uses a lot of computer calculations. *2004 Verification of the Riemann hypothesis for the first 1013 zeros of the Riemann zeta function. *2007 Verification that Checkers is a draw. *2008 Proofs that various Mersenne numbers with around ten million digits are prime. *Calculations of large numbers of digits of œÄ. *2010 Showing that Rubik's Cube can be solved in 20 moves. *2012 Showing that Sudoku needs at least 17 clues. *2013 Ternary Goldbach conjecture: Every odd number greater than 5 can be expressed as the sum of three primes. *2014 Proof of Erd≈ës discrepancy conjecture for particular case C=2: every ¬±1-sequence of the length 1161 has a discrepancy at least 3, original proof generated by a SAT solver, had a size of 13 gigabytes and was later reduced to 850 megabytes. *2016 Solving boolean Pythagorean triples problem required the generation of 200 terabytes of proof. *2017 Heule, who coauthored solution to the boolean Pythagorean triples problem, announced 2 petabytes long proof that 5th Schur's number is 161. Long proofs in mathematical logic Kurt G√∂del showed how to find explicit examples of statements in formal systems that are provable in that system but whose shortest proof is absurdly long. For example, the statement: :\\"This statement cannot be proved in Peano arithmetic in less than a googolplex symbols\\" is provable in Peano arithmetic but the shortest proof has at least a googolplex symbols. It has a short proof in a more powerful system: in fact, it is easily provable in Peano arithmetic together with the statement that Peano arithmetic is consistent (which cannot be proved in Peano arithmetic by G√∂del's incompleteness theorem). In this argument, Peano arithmetic can be replaced by any more powerful consistent system, and a googolplex can be replaced by any number that can be described concisely in the system. Harvey Friedman found some explicit natural examples of this phenomenon, giving some explicit statements in Peano arithmetic and other formal systems whose shortest proofs are ridiculously long . For example, the statement :\\"there is an integer n such that if there is a sequence of rooted trees T1, T2, ..., Tn such that Tk has at most k+10 vertices, then some tree can be homeomorphically embedded in a later one\\" is provable in Peano arithmetic, but the shortest proof has length at least A(1000), where A(0)=1 and A(n+1)=2A(n). The statement is a special case of Kruskal's theorem and has a short proof in second order arithmetic.

Pogson. He was the first Indian Fellow of the Royal Astronomical Society and is known for his studies of variable stars and the discovery of R Reticuli in 1867.  Early life  Little is known about Chary's personal life. It is believed that he was born in Madras in about 1822. However, in official records, his birthdate has been recorded as 1828 and given in some sources as 17 March. Chary's ancestors were Hindu astronomers who prepared Hindu astrological almanacs called Panchangams. He lived in Nungambakkam and joined the Madras Observatory in 1840 as a \\"coolie\\" under T. G. Taylor.  Career  By 1864, Chary had gathered enough knowledge of mathematics to be appointed as astronomer at the observatory. He forged a productive partnership with N. R. Pogson, director of the Madras observatory. His main responsibility at the observatory was to observe stars and determine their positions for the Madras Catalogues. During the solar eclipse of 18 August 1868, Chary was given the task of conducting observations from a village called Wanaparthy situated to the north of Kurnool, in the district of Mehaboobnagar. He was also a part of the team which observed the eclipse of 12 December 1871 at Avanashi. In 1874, Chary wrote a treatise on the transit of Venus which was published in several local languages.  Discoveries  Chary discovered the variable star R Reticuli in 1867. He was the first Indian in modern history to make a significant astronomical discovery. Chary noted that the star which was observed by astronomer T. Moottooswamy Pillai with a Meridian Circle on 9 February 1864 was not visible when observed in January 1866 but could be spotted on 18 January 1867. Some sources also attribute the discovery of another variable star V Cephei or U Cephei to him but same has not been confirmed by the Madras Observatory.  Death  Chary fell ill and died on 5 February 1880. In an obituary to Chary, The Madras Mail wrote  Family  One of Chary's sons Chinthamani Raghava Chary was also an astronomer and helped Chary in preparing a Drigganita Panchang for the year 1880. One of Chary's relatives P. Raghavachari served as third assistant at the Madras Observatory in 1877.  Honours  Chary was elected fellow of the Royal Astronomical Society on 12 January 1872 - the first Indian to be elected to the society.  Publications  In 1874, Chary wrote a book on the transit of Venus in English and six Indian languages, Sanskrit, Kannada, Tamil, Telugu and Urdu in the form of a vivada or dialogue between two individuals.

It is the thirteenth entry in the Fire Emblem series, and the first to be developed for the Nintendo 3DS. The gameplay, like previous Fire Emblem games, focuses on tactical movement of characters across a battlefield fighting enemy units. Other features include the ability to build relationships between the characters to improve their abilities, adjustable difficulty levels, a mode that disables the permanent death of characters, and multiple camera perspectives in battle. The story of Awakening takes place 2000 years after the events of the original Fire Emblem and Fire Emblem Gaiden, focusing on Chrom, the prince of Ylisse, and his personal army, the \\"Shepherds\\". They rescue Robin (an Avatar whose name, gender, and appearance are customizable by he player), who is suffering from amnesia. Over the course of the story, Robin aids Chrom's army in defending Ylisse from undead monsters - the Risen - and attacks from the hostile nation of Plegia. Development of Fire Emblem Awakening began in 2010, with multiple veterans of the Fire Emblem series filling key development roles. Development was handled by Intelligent Systems with supervision from Nintendo. As the series had seen declining sales with previous installments, Awakening was designed as the possible last entry in the series, with elements from all previous Fire Emblem games incorporated. Due to the 3DS still being fine-tuned by developers, the team's decisions for content and graphics were made based on what they thought was feasible for what they had available to them. However, some gameplay options and proposals were met with mixed feelings, such as the option to disable permanent character death, often known as 'permadeath', a staple of the Fire Emblem franchise. Upon release, the game received critical acclaim and achieved strong sales worldwide, with many critics praising the new additions to the traditional gameplay and accessibility to newcomers of the series. After release, the game was nominated for multiple awards from video game publications, often being cited as one of the best games on the 3DS platform, is credited with boosting sales for the 3DS and is considered one of the best role-playing video games of all time. Awakenings commercial success ensured the continuation of the series. The successor of Awakening, Fire Emblem Fates, was released in Japan in June 2015, and in Western territories in February 2016. Gameplay In Fire Emblem Awakening, the player begins the game as one of the central characters, a customizable Tactician Avatar: the Avatar's gender, hair color, feature types, and voice can all be customized. There are two modes of play: Casual Mode and Classic Mode. In Classic mode, characters defeated in battle are permanently dead, unable to be used for the rest of the game. Casual Mode enables the player to disable permanent character deaths. With permanent death disabled, fallen units are restored after the completion of the battle. When Chrom or the Avatar character dies in battle in any mode, the player receives a \\"Game Over\\" message and must restart the battle. The game has multiple difficulty levels: the three standard modes are Normal, Hard and Lunatic. A fourth difficulty level, Lunatic+, is unlocked after completing the game on Lunatic mode. The playing mode and difficulty level are selected at the beginning of a new game. After the player is given access to a party of characters, they can travel across a world map both to new locations and revisit old locations. The time of day on the world map is synced to the player's time zone and time of day. New locations can contain main story missions as well as side stories where new characters can be recruited. Previously visited locations have shops where the player can acquire new weapons. They also can contain random enemy skirmishes. Between missions, players can go to a customizable central base called the Barracks, where the player can watch scenes between characters and perform other activities. The player can recruit approximately forty characters, not including characters included in downloadable content. The game features multiple uses of the Nintendo 3DS-exclusive SpotPass and StreetPass functions via the world map. During navigation, the player can encounter other players and interact via StreetPass. The player can do battle with a party of up to ten characters from another player's world. Whichever player wins the battle gains access to the party. Avatars can also be either befriended or defeated in battle, and loaned out to other players using this function. =Battle system= Screenshot of a battle in Fire Emblem Awakening, showing two characters about to fight one another. The basic mechanics of the battle system are all displayed. Awakening uses a turn-based tactical role-playing battle system. The terrain is displayed on the top screen of the 3DS, while unit information is displayed on the bottom screen. Before each battle, the player selects a limited number of characters from their roster for use in battle. The player can either control each unit manually or activate an auto-battle option. Character movement is dictated by a tile-based movement system. During combat, player-controlled sprite characters and enemy units controlled by the game's artificial intelligence (AI) each get one turn where they position their units. An additional turn is added when unaffiliated AI-controlled units are in the field. Playable characters positioned next to each other in the field will support one-another, granting buffs, and performing actions such as blocking attacks. Two characters can also pair up as a single mobile unit, enabling both units to attack at once. As the relationship between characters strengthens, they gain greater bonuses to their strength and effectiveness when paired up in battle. During combat, the perspective switches to a 3D scene between combatants. Optional camera angles, including a first-person view through the eyes of playable characters, can be activated using the 3DS stylus. During battles, characters earn experience points (XP) through successful actions during battle. When the character has reached 100 XP, their level is raised by one, increasing various stats including health and attack power. New skills are also learned by each character. The game includes a character class system, with approximately forty classes available. Each character, including the Avatar, has a starting class. When a unit reaches Level 10, they can either upgrade or change their classes using special items called Master Seals and Second Seals. A Master Seal promotes the character's class, improving character stats and giving access to new ability sets or weapons. A Second Seal allows a character to change class, or \\"reclass\\", when they are either at Level 10 or have reached their current Advanced Class. Upon reclassing, a character's experience level is reset to Level 1 while their stats and abilities are retained. The classes that most characters can reclass into are limited. The exception to this is the Avatar, who is able to reclass into any class available to their gender. Regardless of future changes, characters retain learned skills from earlier classes. A character's class affects both their attack capabilities and their mobility on the battlefield: for example, mages and archers can attack at greater ranges than melee units, mounted units have more powerful attacks than foot units, while flying units have greater mobility and range. Relationships between characters are built up through Support conversations between chapters. The normal rankings of relationships are C to A, with A standing for a close friendship. For characters of opposing genders, an additional S ranking is available, in which the characters fall in love, marry and have children. Relationships also have a direct impact during battles, with certain character pairings granting positive effects such as increased mobility or an automatic guarding action. A couple's children can be found and recruited in optional chapters made available by the parent characters' marriage, with their appearance and in- game abilities varying depending on who their parents were. Most characters have a specific list of units which they can have Support conversations with; the Avatar can build a relationship with all characters, and (depending on their chosen gender) marry any unit from any generation as long as they are not a direct descendant. Synopsis =Setting and characters= The game takes place approximately 2000 years after the events of Fire Emblem: Shadow Dragon and the Blade of Light. In ancient times, the Fell Dragon Grima attempted to destroy the world. To stop Grima, the Divine Dragon Naga (voiced by Mela Lee) chose the ruler of the Halidom of Ylisse (known as the First Exalt) and granted them power through two magical objects: Falchion, a sword with the power to slay dragons; and the Fire Emblem, a magical shield. Using these, the Exalt struck down Grima, sending it into a long slumber. In the intervening period, the continents of Archanea and Valentia became known as Ylisse and Valm. By the present time, the land of Ylisse is divided between Halidom of Ylisse, which continues to worship Naga, and is ruled by Exalt Emmeryn (voiced by Erin Fitzgerald) and defended by the Shepherds, her brother Chrom's (voiced by Matthew Mercer) militia force; the kingdom of Plegia, which worships Grima; and Regna Ferox, a country whose rulers periodically compete for dominance. Fifteen years prior to Awakening, the last Exalt of Ylisse, Emmeryn's father, waged a religious war against Plegia, which greatly damaged both countries and left bitterness on both sides. Ylisse has slowly recovered from the war thanks to Emmeryn's peaceful actions. =Plot= After dreaming of killing Chrom, an amnesiac Robin wakes up in a field and is found by Chrom and members of his personal army, the Shepherds. Robin joins the Shepherds, after exhibiting the qualities of a tactician when they defend a nearby town from Plegian bandits. After gaining an alliance with Regna Ferox, the Shepherds move to fight both Plegia's forces and revenant monsters called the Risen; they are helped by a masked man calling himself \\"Marth\\". After a confrontation between Plegia and the Shepherds, Emmeryn is almost killed by Validar and his minions. The assassination plot is foiled with aid from \\"Marth\\", who has prior knowledge of the event, and is also revealed to be a woman. Soon after, Plegian forces capture Emmeryn as she goes to parley with King Gangrel, Plegia's ruler, and prevent another war. Gangrel demands the Fire Emblem in exchange for Emmeryn's life. Though Chrom almost accepts Gangrel's terms, Emmeryn stops him by throwing herself over a cliff, becoming a martyr to both Ylisse and Plegia. Eventually, the Shepherds triumph over Plegia, defeating Gangrel and restoring peace to the continent. Two years after Gangrel's defeat, Chrom inherits the throne of Ylisse, marries, and fathers a newborn daughter named Lucina. Chrom leads the Shepherds again when Emperor Walhart of Valm threatens to invade Ylisse. During the campaign, \\"Marth\\" returns, and reveals that she is a Lucina from an alternate timeline from more than 10 years in the future where Grima has been resurrected, and used a time traveling spell devised by Naga to return to the past in order to prevent the events leading to her future. To combat Grima, Chrom must perform the \\"Awakening\\", a ritual that grants him Naga's power, by combining the Fire Emblem with five magical gems divided among the nations. During and after the war in Valm, the Shepherds manage to retrieve four of the gemstones. They are then ambushed by Validar, the new king of Plegia and Robin's father, after he offers them the last gemstone. Validar takes control of Robin and steals the Fire Emblem from Chrom. He also reveals that Robin was born as the ideal vessel for Grima. Lucina realizes that Grima used Robin to kill Chrom in her timeline, and attempts to execute them; Chrom forces her to stand down, remaining confident the Avatar can overcome Grima's control. Alternatively, if Robin is Lucina's husband or mother, Lucina is unable to go through with it and stands down on her own. The Shepherds manage to track down Validar, who uses Robin to attack Chrom, mirroring the events of their nightmare. However, Robin uses their foreknowledge to prevent Chrom's death, allowing the Shepherds to kill Validar and recover the Fire Emblem. At this point, a possessed Robin from Lucina's future appears, revealing that the present timeline Robin's amnesia was caused by Grima's unsuccessful attempt to possess them. The future Robin then uses the power gathered for Grima's resurrection to restore its dragon form. In a race against time, Chrom performs the Awakening and summons Naga. Although Chrom now has the power to stop Grima, Naga reveals that she only has enough power to put Grima to sleep for another thousand years. Naga explains that the only way to truly destroy Grima is to have him destroy himself through Robin, which could come at cost of Robin's life. Naga tells them that Robin will only survive if their bonds with Chrom and the Shepherds are strong enough. In the final battle, the Shepherds manage to weaken Grima. Chrom, already set against the sacrifice of Robin, offers to deliver the final blow to the fell dragon. Depending on the player's final choice, the game will reach one of two different endings. If Chrom deals the final blow, Grima is put back to sleep for another thousand years, though Robin is left with regrets. If the Avatar deals the final blow, both them and Grima permanently die. Chrom and the Shepherds refuse to believe that Robin is dead, and vow to find them and bring them home. In a post-credits scene, Robin wakes up in a field similar to the beginning of the game, where Chrom and Lissa find them and welcome them home. Development The original planning for Fire Emblem Awakening began in 2010, when Nintendo SPD director Genki Yokota was finishing his work on Xenoblade Chronicles. The game was co- developed by Nintendo and regular Fire Emblem developer Intelligent Systems. Among the staff members were veterans of the Fire Emblem series, including project manager Masahiro Higuchi, who had first worked on Fire Emblem: Genealogy of the Holy War, and Intelligent Systems producer Kouhei Maeda, who first worked as a scenario writer for Fire Emblem: The Binding Blade. The first proposals were made after the completion of Fire Emblem: New Mystery of the Emblem, a remake for the Nintendo DS of the third game. Development was very slow for the first year, during which time producer Hitoshi Yamagami organized the game's development structure. Once this was completed, he handed the main production duties over to co-director Genki Yokota. The art director was Toshiyuki Kusakihara. Character designs were done by Kusakihara and Y≈´suke Kozaki. Kusakihara was brought on board to offer a fresh perspective on the Fire Emblem series and new ideas for the team, while Kozaki was brought in to help create a distinctive art style that would be well received overseas, as had his previous work for the Wii title No More Heroes. During development, Kusakihara and Kozaki had lengthy meetings about various aspects of the game. These meetings became so time-consuming that Kusakihara compared his situation to the legend of Urashima Tar≈ç. Due to declining sales for the series, the developers were told by Nintendo that Awakening would be the last Fire Emblem game if it failed to sell above 250,000 units. This caused panic for the team, with them considering including a high number of elements new to the game. Among the concepts were a modern-day setting or using the planet Mars as a setting. Eventually, the team decided that these elements would alienate rather than attract players and stuck to the medieval setting and style of previous Fire Emblem titles. As a compromise, the team decided to make it the \\"culmination\\" of all the games in Fire Emblem series to that point, incorporating gameplay elements from multiple titles. This approach was approved by the team and the proposal was completed within a month, though the decision also created difficulties with choosing which elements to include, and how to balance them so they did not clash with one another. The game's final title, \\"Awakening\\", was born from this concept of an ultimate Fire Emblem game. It was initially just casually suggested by Yamagami when discussing ideas for a title with Yokota, and Yokota liked it. As development progressed, the team continued to come up with ideas that increased workload, but they maintained a positive attitude and pushed forward in spite of the consequent pressures. Internally, the game was known as Fire Emblem Fin: The Children from the Brink. Maeda was mainly responsible for the original scenario, thinking out the rough outline before the team created the events of each chapter in detail. Some plot points, such as the true identity of \\"Marth\\", were planned from an early stage, while many of the other plot twists came about during its development. Many of them were added at the suggestion of team members from both Intelligent Systems and Nintendo. Two key story themes while developing the game were the love for the characters, and the bonds characters developed over the course of the story. The latter theme was expressed in gameplay through the cooperative behavior of adjacent characters. While voice acting was included, it was limited to snappy lines meant to evoke a certain feeling. This was because the team had concerns about the amount of content in the game, which would increase a great deal with full voice acting, and its effect on the pacing. The team also used multiple well-known Japanese voice actors for the characters. Special voice overs and visuals were created for the character \\"confession\\" sequences. All the main characters had a personalized back story, and appropriate personalities were chosen for them. The first one to be finalized was the child character Inigo, who was created by character planner Nami Kumoru. A large team of writers were employed to create the character dialogue, and a story bible containing the characters' personality traits was created for the writers to work from. While developing the playable and enemy characters, the team used feedback from fans saying they should name all the characters, including foot soldiers. Wanting to give the impression of every character having their own lives, they created full artwork for all characters. Creating the characters proved to be one of the hardest parts of development. While designing the characters, Kozaki took their backstories into account: for example, the thief character Gaius was drawn with a sack of sweets, as he had a love for them. Kozaki was also responsible for creating the 2D artwork which represented the characters during conversations. =Design= The game's optional first-person perspective during battle, one of the several features new to the Fire Emblem series, was included to increase player freedom and show off the platform's 3D effects. Once Nintendo gave the go-ahead for development, Intelligent Systems formed a small internal development team to handle the project. Awakening was the first Fire Emblem game for the Nintendo 3DS. The platform was as yet unreleased and still undergoing final development. Because of this, the team had a large number of ideas for features to include, but they also only had a limited idea of what the system was capable of. Consequently, they had difficulties deciding how the 2D sprites and 3D environments would interact with each other, and ensuring they did not clip through objects. One notable feature missing from in-game character models was their feet. The original idea was to add a unique and uniform deformation to characters. As the team did not have much knowledge of the platform's CPU strength, the number of character bones they could include were intentionally limited. This meant that the bones needed for the operation of ankles and feet were omitted. Later, it was discovered that ankles and feet could be included, but the team decided to leave that for a future game if it came to pass. A different explanation was that the team wanted players to focus on the top half of characters, so made their heads the largest part of their character models while shrinking their feet. The concept for character graphics on the map underwent changes. Initially, some of the team felt that accurately displaying a character's equipment and class would be enough, but later it was decided to give them all individual characteristics. They were also able to add more unique character expressions than previous Fire Emblem games, enabling a greater emotional range during scenes of drama. A different element was the environmental effects the team incorporated, such as dust clouds when characters performed actions in battle. For the full-motion cutscenes, the team wanted to create a sense of grandeur and spectacle, using the openings of Taiga drama series as inspiration. Japanese animation company Kamikaze Douga was in charge of supervising the production and art assets of the game's cutscenes. Cutscene animation was handled by Studio Anima. According to team members, their request to Studio Anima was to make the world \\"come alive\\" during the full- motion sequences, which were included at crucial moments in the plot. The first part of the game to receive full attention from the team was the gameplay. As a test map, the team used the opening map for Mystery of the Emblem. One of the early options was switching between 16x16 and 24x24 pixel characters depending on the camera's overhead distance. In the end, the team used a hardware-based scaling system instead of switching between graphics types so as to keep the frame rate consistent in battle. While designing the levels, the team created both maps with a plot-driven structure and maps that allowed for player freedom. An aspect of the battle system new to the series was the inclusion of an optional first-person viewpoint during battles. This was done with western players in mind, as developers wanted to both give players an option on their perspective in battle and demonstrate the platform's 3D effects. The difficulty levels proved a point of debate amongst the team, ranging from the naming of difficulties to whether to include the ability to adjust it on the fly, which some felt was contrary to Fire Emblem traditions. There was also debate about both the inclusion and mechanics of the marriage system. While some aspects went smoothly, there was contention about the ability to marry any of the characters, and Kusakihara's suggestion of having characters kissing at the conclusion of each romance was vetoed by the team. An effort was made to make the interface and graphics easy for players to understand. An example of this was the cursor, which in previous games had been a triangular shape and for Awakening was changed to a pointing hand. One of the more controversial ideas that made it into the final game was the \\"Casual Mode\\", first introduced in New Mystery of the Emblem. Initially opposed by staff members at Nintendo and Intelligent Systems, Yamagami and others successfully defended the feature. Yamagami's stance was that modern gamers would not be pleased with needing to invest extra time because a character had died. In another interview, team members said that Awakening was the first time the team conformed to the popular image of Nintendo games being easy to play and user-friendly. Release The game was first announced in September 2011 as part of Nintendo's 2012 lineup for the 3DS, alongside titles such as Monster Hunter 4 and Bravely Default. As part of its release, Nintendo created a limited edition Nintendo 3DS bundle with Awakening pre-installed. The game's localization and western release was planned from an early stage, hence the inclusion of multiple aesthetic and gameplay elements meant to appeal to a western audience. The localization process was handled collaboratively by independent video game localization company 8-4 and Nintendo of America. The localization process took approximately one year. The game was first announced for release in Europe in February 2012, with the stated release period being that year. In April of the same year, Nintendo of America registered a web domain for Fire Emblem Awakening. Its North American release was confirmed in June through Nintendo's Twitter account. The release windows for western regions were announced in December. For its western release, the game included both the English and Japanese voice tracks. Like in Japan, a limited 3DS bundle with Awakening pre-installed was created for North America and Europe, with Europe also receiving the 3DS XL model as part of the bundle. There was some confusion upon its release in North America: on the day of release, while it was available through Nintendo's online store, multiple online retailers did not have it stocked. While Nintendo was fairly non- committal on the incident, they did state that due to variabilities in shipping, retailers could received stocks on different days. =Downloadable content= Fire Emblem Awakening was the first packaged title released by Nintendo to receive downloadable content (DLC) after launch, taking the form of additional maps and characters from previous entries in the Fire Emblem series. The idea for DLC content came up when the game was close to completion. Due to this, the team could not do anything that would invalidate the main story. For the additional playable characters, the team focused on the main cast, picked out the most suitable, and left the final choice to Maeda. Starting from the game's release, over twenty different playable maps were released over several months at the rate of one map per week. Nintendo decided to release downloadable content for the game in all available regions. After it becomes available, the DLC can be accessed using the game's SpotPass system: within the context of the game's world, after a certain point in the game, the characters can access an area called the Outrealm Gate, being transported to the DLC maps. Various artists have contributed illustrations for the downloadable characters, including those who have worked on previous titles, such as Senri Kita, and newcomers, such as Kimihiko Fujisaka. One of the DLC maps received censorship upon release in North America and Europe, with a shot of a female playable character altered to hide her underwear. Reception Fire Emblem Awakening has received widespread critical acclaim, holding an aggregate score of 92/100 on Metacritic, based on 72 reviews. After its release, Awakening was placed on GameSpot's list of the best games on the 3DS, and reached second place on a similar list by GameTrailers. IGN included the game on two different lists: it reached #2 on their list of the top 25 Nintendo 3DS games, and #21 on their list of the top 125 Nintendo games of all time. Slant Magazines staff ranked it the eleventh best video game of 2013. Famitsu said in its review that the game could be enjoyed by hardcore fans and newcomers alike, as it made accommodations for both, and particularly praised the new gameplay features. IGN's Audrey Drake called Awakening \\"the most fluid and stunning strategy RPG experience available on a portable, and features the best storytelling and production value of any 3DS game to date.\\" Jeremy Parish, writing for 1UP.com, said that though the Fire Emblem series had changed little over the years while holding a place of respect within the genre, the changes Intelligent Systems implemented made Awakening \\"an engrossing title that should enjoy impressive shelf life.\\" His main criticism was against the enemy AI, which occasionally unbalanced the gameplay. Ray Carsillo of Electronic Gaming Monthly, while sharing Parish's opinion on the lack of a restart option, called Awakening \\"probably the best Fire Emblem to come to the States yet.\\" While Eurogamer's Rich Stanton, giving the game a perfect score, called it \\"a special game\\", praising its story themes and how it made him care about his characters. GameTrailers said that the game \\"takes positive strides forward with new additions like enhancements to the social system and battle mechanics, and the series‚Äô established formula is all the better for it.\\" Despite feeling mixed about the interface and multiplayer, GameSpot's Heidi Kemps called Awakening the best installment in the series for some time. Alexa Ray Corriea, writing for Polygon, said that the development team had \\"added just enough to the time-tested Fire Emblem formula to bolster its challenges without cutting away its roots.\\" Game Informers Kimberley Wallace said that \\"[Awakening] made me scratch and claw for victory, and I savored every moment.\\" Chris Carter of Destructoid, similar to Famitsu, recommended it to old and new players, saying: \\"If you've been itching to get into a Fire Emblem game, this is a great place to start. If you've been playing them all along, you'll feel right at home.\\" =Awards= Awakening was nominated for multiple awards after release. At the 2012 Famitsu Awards 2012, Awakening was among the games awarded the magazine's Excellence Award. In the west, it was nominated in the \\"Best RPG\\" category at the Spike Video Game Awards 2013. It was nominated in multiple categories in Destructoid's 2013 Game of the Year awards, including Game of the Year, Best Role-Playing Game, Best Story, and Best Soundtrack. It was also nominated for GameSpot's Game of the Year 2013 in the Nintendo 3DS category. In IGN's Best of 2013 awards, it won in both the Best 3DS Strategy Game and Best 3DS Story categories. At the Game Developers Choice Awards 2014, it was nominated in the Best Handheld/Mobile Game category. =Sales= The game's Japanese version sold exceptionally well, with it being the fastest selling entry in the series since detailed weekly tallies began. During its opening week, the game managed to sell 242,600 units, reaching the top of the sales charts and beating the debut sales of the previous two Fire Emblem releases. It sold through 81.63% of its initial shipment, causing sell-outs in some stores. Japanese sales tracker Media Create attributed the initial high sales to Nintendo's promotional campaign and a five-year wait between releases. Demand for the limited Japanese bundle also exceeded Nintendo's expectations, as the pre- order website crashed from the number of people trying to buy it. As marketing the game as any product other than a limited edition would have violated a Japanese commercial law, Nintendo were unable to reopen the pre-orders after the initial sales period despite complaints. By the beginning of 2013, the game had sold 455,268 units, placing it among the top 30 high-selling titles for 2012. In addition to the main game, Nintendo reported that 1.2 million units of downloadable content had been sold by September 2012, bringing in an additional 380 million yen (about $4.8 million). Sales in the west were equally good. During its first month on sale in North America, the game sold 180,000 units, with 63,000 units of the total sales being eShop downloads. These figures gave Awakening the best ever first month sales for the franchise in North America. Sales of the title continued to rise in the coming months, with the total figure reaching 240,000 units by April, including a further 20,000 digital sales. By September, total sales in North America had reached 390,000 units. In the UK, Awakening debuted in third place on the charts behind Injustice: Gods Among Us and BioShock Infinite. The game and the hardware bundle collectively boosted sales of the 3DS and 3DS XL by nearly 50% over the previous week. As of March 2017, the game has sold-through just over 1.9 million copies worldwide (includes both physical and digital units). Legacy The game's strong sales, well exceeding the figures set by Nintendo during production, ensured the Fire Emblem series would not be cancelled. In January 2015, a new Fire Emblem title created for the Nintendo 3DS by the same core team as Awakening, Fire Emblem Fates, was announced for a worldwide release. The success of Awakening has been credited with popularizing the platform among other Japanese RPG publishers, such as Square Enix and Atlus. Awakenings success has also resulted in characters making appearances in other Nintendo games. Lucina and Robin (the latter of which uses their default male and female appearances), were featured in the crossover fighting video game Super Smash Bros. for Nintendo 3DS and Wii U. Chrom was considered for the game, but was deemed too similar to other Fire Emblem characters in the roster at the time, so his appearance was relegated to small non-playable cameos. However, he was finally made playable in the franchise's next entry Super Smash Bros. Ultimate by popular request, particularly from within Japan. Lucina and Robin were also made available as playable characters in Code Name: S.T.E.A.M., Fire Emblem Fates, and (albeit temporarily) Fire Emblem Echoes: Shadows of Valentia for those who scanned their Amiibo figures.https://www.ign.com/wikis/fire-emblem- fates/Amiibo_Supporthttps://www.gameinformer.com/b/features/archive/2017/05/19/heres- what-your-amiibo-collection-gets-you-in-fire-emblem-echoes.aspx Costumes based on Chrom and Lucina are also available in Capcom's Monster Hunter: Frontier G video game, in a cross-promotion done with Nintendo. A free downloadable content mission allowed the characters in Fates to visit the setting of Awakening, mere moments before the latter's campaign began in earnest. During promotion for Fates, a Fire Emblem-themed trading card game was released. A set themed after Awakening includes a code to download Lucina as a playable character in Fates. Chrom and Lucina are both playable units in Project X Zone 2, and multiple characters from Awakening feature in Tokyo Mirage Sessions ‚ôØFE, a crossover with Atlus's Megami Tensei megafranchise. Characters from Awakening prominently appear as playable units in the spinoff titles Fire Emblem Heroes and Fire Emblem Warriors, with the latter launching alongside the first Chrom Amiibo figure. A second Chrom Amiibo figure for the Super Smash Bros. lineup was released on November 15, 2019.

Boiler design is the process of designing boilers used for various purposes. The main function of a boiler is to heat water to generate steam. Steam produced in a boiler can be used for a variety of purposes including space heating, sterilisation, drying, humidification and power generation. The temperature or condition of steam required for these applications is different, so boiler designs vary accordingly.  Modern design benefits  Boiler in the steam technology center at College of Engineering, Pune Modern boiler design offers several benefits. In the past, improper design of boilers has caused explosions which led to loss of life and property. Modern designs attempt to avoid such mishaps. Further, mathematical modeling can determine how much space a boiler will need and the type of materials to be used. When the design specifications of a boiler are determined, design engineers can estimate a cost and time schedule for the construction. Boiler design may be based upon: * Production of a maximum quantity of steam with minimal fuel consumption * Economic feasibility of installation * Minimal operator attention required during operation * Capability for quick starting * Conformity to safety regulations * Quality of raw water : how hard or soft the water is will determine the material of the boiler. * Heat source - the fuel to be burned and its ash properties or the process material from which the heat is to be recovered. * Capacity/steam output required, usually measured in tonnes per hour or kg/s. * Steam condition - pressure, temperature, etc. * Safety considerations * Mechanical constraints * Cost restrictions * Monetary cost * Tensile strength of material must be considered while using any joining processes.\\"Elements of Workshop Technology\\", S Hajra Choudhury, Nirjhar Joy Accessories and mountings are devices which form an integral part of boiler but are not mounted on it. They include economizers, superheaters, feed pumps and air pre-heaters. Accessories help in controlling and running the boiler efficiently. Certain common mountings (specifically those required by the Indian Boiler Act) include: * Feed check valve - regulates the flow of water into the boiler and prevents the back flow of water in case of failure of the feed pump. * Steam stop valve - regulates the flow of steam that is produced in the boiler to the steam pipe, and may also be used to stop the supply of steam from the boiler * Fusible plug - placed at the lowest level of water and above the combustion chamber, its function is to extinguish the fire as soon as the water level in the shell of the boiler falls below a certain marked level. * Blow-off cock - removes water from the shell at regular intervals to remove the various impurities that may be settled at the bottom of the shell. * Safety valves - automatically prevent the steam pressure from exceeding safe levels * Water-level indicators - indicate the level of water in the shell.  Design Software  There are free online tools and design software available for carrying out boiler design. Free online calculations can be found at FireCAD website. The Power Plant Simulator & Designer is an often used commercial tool for boiler design.  References  Bibliography * Malek, Mohammad A.

MB0042-Unit-06. Managerial utility function The managerial utility function includes variables such as salary, job security, power, status, dominance, prestige and professional excellence of managers. Of these, salary is the only quantitative variable and thus measurable. The other variables are non-pecuniary, which are non-quantifiable. The variables expenditure on staff salary, management slack, discretionary investments can be assigned nominal values. Thus these will be used as proxy variables to measure the real or unquantifiable concepts like job security, power, status, dominance, prestige and professional excellence of managers, appearing in the managerial utility function.E. Narayanan Nadar, S. Vijayan (2009). Managerial Economics, eastern economy edition. PHI Learning Pvt. Ltd. pp. 42. . Utility function or \\"expense preference\\"M. L. Trivedi (2009). Managerial Economics: Theory and Applications. Tata McGraw‚ÄìHill. pp. 100. . of a manager can be given by: ::U=U(S,M,I_D) \\\\, where U denotes the Utility function, S denotes the ‚Äúmonetary expenditure on the staff‚Äù, M stands for \\"Management Slack\\" and ID stands for amount of \\"Discretionary Investment\\". \\"Monetary expenditure on staff\\" include not only the manager's salary and other forms of monetary compensation received by him from the business firm but also the number of staff under the control of the manager as there is a close positive relationship between the number of staff and the manager's salary. \\"Management slack\\" consists of those non-essential management perquisites such as entertainment expenses, lavishly furnished offices, luxurious cars, large expense accounts, etc. which are above minimum to retain the managers in the firm. These perks, even if not provided would not make the manager quit his job, but these are incentives which enhance their prestige and status in the organisation in turn contributing to efficiency of the firm's operations. The Management Slack is also a part of the cost of production of the firm. \\"Discretionary investment\\" refers to the amount of resources left at a manager's disposal, to be able to spend at his own discretion. For example, spending on latest equipment, furniture, decoration material, etc. It satisfies their ego and gives them a sense of pride. These give a boost to the manager's esteem and status in the organisation. Such investments are over and above the amount required for the survival of the firm (such as periodic replacement of the capital equipment). Concepts of profit in the model The various concepts of profit used in the model needs to be understood clearly before moving to the main model. Williamson has put forth four main concepts of profits in his model: =Actual profit (Œ†)= ::\\\\Pi=R-C-S \\\\, where R is the total revenue, C is the cost of production and S is the staff expenditure. =Reported profit (Œ†r)= ::\\\\Pi_r=\\\\Pi - M \\\\, where Œ† is the actual profit and M is the management slack. =Minimum profit (Œ†0)= It is the amount of profit after tax deducted which should be paid to the shareholders of the firm, in the form of dividends, to keep them satisfied. If the minimum level of profit cannot be given out to the shareholders, they might resort of bulk sale of their shares which will transfer the ownership to other hands leaving the company in the risk of a complete take over. Since the shareholders have the voting rights, they might also vote for the change of the top level of management. Thus the job security of the manager is also threatened. Ideally the reported profits must be either equal to or greater than the minimum profits plus the taxes, as it is only after paying out the minimum profit that the additional profit can be used to increase the managerial utility further. ::\\\\Pi_r \\\\ge \\\\Pi_0 +T \\\\, where Œ†r is the reported profit, Œ†0 is the minimum profit and T is the tax. =Discretionary profit (Œ†D)= It is basically the entire amount of profit left after minimum profits and tax which is used to increase the manager‚Äôs utility, that is, to pay out managerial emoluments as well as allow them to make discretionary investments. ::\\\\Pi_D=\\\\Pi - \\\\Pi_0 - T \\\\, where Œ†D is the discretionary profit, Œ† is the actual profit, Œ†0 is the minimum profit and T is the tax amount. However, what appears in the managerial utility function is discretionary investments (ID) and not discretionary profits. Thus it is very important to distinguish between the two as further in the model we would have to maximize the managerial utility function given the profit constraint. ::I_D=\\\\Pi_r - \\\\Pi_0 - T \\\\, where Œ†r is the reported profit, Œ†0 is the minimum profit and T is the tax amount. Thus it can be seen that the difference in the Discretionary Profit and the Discretionary investment arises because of the amount of managerial slack. This can be represented by the given equation ::\\\\Pi_D=I_D +M \\\\, where Œ†D is the discretionary profit, ID is the Discretionary investment and M is the management slack.Maria Moschandreas (2005). Business Economics, second edition. Thomson. p. 204. . Model framework For simple representation of the model the managerial slack is considered to be zero. Thus there is no difference between the actual profit and reported profit, which implies that the discretionary profit is equal to the discretionary investment. I.e. : \\\\Pi_r=\\\\Pi \\\\text{ or }\\\\Pi_D=I_D \\\\, where Œ†r is the reported profit, Œ† is the actual profit, Œ†D is the discretionary profit and ID is the discretionary investment. Such that the utility function of the manager becomes ::U=U(S,I_D) \\\\, where S is the staff expenditure and ID is the discretionary investment. There is a trade off between these two variables. Increase in either will give the manager a higher level of satisfaction. At any point of time the amount of both these variables combined is the same, therefore an increase in one would automatically require a decrease in the other. The manager therefore has to make a choice of the correct combination of these two variables to attain a certain level of desired utility. Substituting ::I_D=\\\\Pi - \\\\Pi_0 - T \\\\, in the new managerial utility function, it can be rewritten as ::U=U(S, \\\\Pi - \\\\Pi_0 - T) \\\\, The relationship between the two variables in the manager‚Äôs utility function is determined by the profit function. Profit of a firm is dependent on the demand and cost conditions. Given the cost conditions the demand is dependent of the price, staff expenditures and the market condition. ::X=f(S,\\\\bar{P},\\\\bar{E}) \\\\, Price and market condition is assumed to be given exogenously at equilibrium. Thus the profit of the firm becomes dependent on the staff expenditure which can be written as ::\\\\Pi=f(X)=f(S,\\\\bar{P},\\\\bar{E}) \\\\, Discretionary profit can be rewritten as ::\\\\Pi_D=f(S,\\\\bar{P},\\\\bar{E}) - \\\\Pi_0 - T) \\\\, In the model, the managers would try to maximise their utility given the profit constraint :: \\\\max U=U(S, \\\\Pi - \\\\Pi_0 - T) \\\\, :: \\\\text{subject to} \\\\Pi \\\\ge \\\\Pi_0 +T \\\\, Graphical representation of the model Fig 1. Utility indifference curves of managers Fig 1. shows the various levels of utility (U1, U2, U3) derived by the manager by combining different amounts of discretionary profits and staff expenditure. Higher the indifference curve, higher is the level of utility derived by the manager. Hence the manager would try to be on the highest level of indifference curve possible given the constraints. Staff expenditure is plotted on the x-axis and discretionary profits on the y-axis. The discretionary profit in this simplified model is equal to the discretionary investment. The indifference curves are downward sloping and convex to the origin. This shows diminishing marginal rate of substitution of staff expenditure for discretionary profits. The curves are asymptotic in nature which implies that at any point of time and under any given circumstance the manager will choose positive amounts of both discretionary profits and staff expenditure. Fig 2. Discretionary profit curve Assuming that the firm is producing an optimum level of output and the market environment is given, the discretionary profits curve is generated, shown in Fig 2. It gives the relationship between staff expenditure and discretionary profits. It can be seen from the figure that profit will be positive in the region between the points B and C. Initially with increase in profits, the staff expenditure the discretionary profits also increase, but this is only till the point Œ†max, that is, till S level of staff expenditure. Beyond this if staff expenditure is increased due to increase in output, then a fall in the discretionary profits is noticed. Staff expenditure of less than B and more than C is not feasible as it wouldn't satisfy the minimum profit constraint and would in turn threaten the job security of managers. Fig 3. Equilibrium of a firm in Williamson's Model To find the equilibrium in the model, Fig 1. is superimposed on Fig 2. The equilibrium point is the point where the discretionary profit curve is tangent to the highest possible indifference curve of the manager, which is point E in Fig 3. Staying at the highest profit point would require the manager to be at a lower indifference curve U2. In this case the highest attainable level of utility is U3. At equilibrium, the level of profits would be lower but staff expenditure S* is higher than the staff expenditure made at the maximum profit point. As indifference curve is downward sloping, the equilibrium point would always be on the right of the maximum profit point. Thus the model shows the higher preference of managers for staff expenditure as compared to the discretionary investments. Criticism # The model fails to describe how businesses take their price and output decisions in a highly competitive set up. # The relationship between better performance of managers and the increasing amounts spent on manager‚Äôs utility by the firm is not always true. # The model does not apply in a dynamic set up like changing demand and cost conditions during booms and recessions.

The selection of Asmussen was announced at the meeting of Group of 7 countries in Marseille, France. At the time, his nomination was controversial in the German parliament, where members of the parties in chancellor Angela Merkel‚Äôs center- right coalition ‚Äì Christian Democratic Union, the Christian Social Union and the Free Democratic Party ‚Äì expressed skepticism because he was known to be a member of the then-opposition Social Democratic party. Originally rumoured to be appointed to serve as chief economist of the ECB,‚Äîa position for which French ECB board member Beno√Æt C≈ìur√© was also a candidate‚ÄîAsmussen was instead given responsibility for International and European Relations on the board, which Draghi has expanded to include attending, alongside himself, meetings of Eurozone government leaders and finance ministers.Ralph Atkins (January 3, 2012), Draghi risks German ire on top job Financial Times. Belgian Peter Praet was given responsibility for the Economics department.Mahler, Armin, \\"Draghi Walks the Tightrope of National Sensitivities\\", analysis, Spiegel, January 4, 2012. Some saw the debate around this appointment as highly controversial, when questions were asked about the North-South balance in the ECB's governing structure. Throughout his tenure, Asmussen often helped communicate policy to ‚Äì as New York Times described it ‚Äì a German public fearful that the ECB was a conduit for transferring their wealth to stricken countries like Greece. In German media, he was publicly supportive of bank measures to subdue the euro zone crisis that were unpopular in Germany. In doing so, he presented a counterweight to officials like Jens Weidmann, president of the Bundesbank, who were highly critical of the ECB.Paul Gordon and Rainer Buergin (December 16, 2013), Draghi Ally Asmussen to Leave ECB for German Government Bloomberg. In June 2013, Asmussen defended ECB policies in testimony to the Federal Constitutional Court of Germany after citizens‚Äô groups challenged their constitutionality. Asmussen and Weidmann gave opposing evidence to the German Constitutional Court this year in a hearing to determine the legality of the Outright Monetary Transactions program. Countering Weidmann's testimony, Asmussen argued the OMT program did not relieve countries of the need to reform their own economies as they would have to sign up to rescue plans monitored by the EU's bailout fund, the International Monetary Fund and the European Commission.Michael Steen (June 11, 2013), Bundesbank in court clash with ECB over bond-buying plan Financial Times. While Weidmann argued that bond markets exert discipline on countries‚Äô finances, Asmussen said the euro area faced break-up last year as investors began to price in an end to the currency. In early 2013, Asmussen represented the ECB in talks with the European Commission and the International Monetary Fund over aid to Cyprus, a member of the euro zone. They worked out a plan that would have forced depositors to finance much of a bailout of the country's banks. After an outcry, they revised the plan. Draghi later called the plan ‚Äúnot smart,‚Äù an implicit rebuke to Asmussen. Asmussen's term at the ECB was scheduled to run until 2019. However, he resigned from his post to join German Chancellor Angela Merkel‚Äôs government in December 2013, saying he wanted to spend more time with his partner and two young children in Berlin.Birgit Jennen (January 15, 2014), Asmussen‚Äôs Pensions Pivot Tests Hunger for Top Office Bloomberg.

During a 2015 conference in Berlin, Asmussen held that \\"the core of European integration for the future is the eurozone\\" and argued in favor of \\"a deeper federal integration of the eurozone, which would mean gradually creating new institutions such as an EU finance ministry or a eurozone budget.\\"Juncker fails to spark debate about the eurozone‚Äôs future EurActiv, March 9, 2015.

The movie was adapted from an article by William Bradford Huie about Hayes. Plot 17-year-old Ira Hamilton Hayes has never been off the Pima reservation in Arizona when he enlists in the United States Marine Corps to serve his country in World War II.

He has been in motion his whole life, growing up in South Africa, coming of age in London, decamping to Lisbon for 5 years and then Berlin and finally settling in Paris, France. His deeply syncopated brand of electronic dance music has evolved with every step of the journey. Emerging out of the ruins of a post apartheid South Africa and rising from a slum in Cape Town, producer Alan Abrahams has made a name for himself in the electronic music by way of his Bodycode and Portable projects.\\"Bodycode: Immune Boost Album Review \\". [Big Shot Mag]. Retrieved 13 September 2011. He started his discovery of dance music listening to the backbeat of the first wave of Chicago house records, Inspired musically, yet frustrated geographically, he relocated to London in 1997. In London, Abrahams began recording as Portable, the experimental, atmospheric project that acts a living link between the indigenous sounds of his youth, and those first records whose futuristic aesthetic broadened his horizons. He founded the S√ºd Electronic label with his partner Lerato and released a string of 12‚Ä≥ releases. A succession of full-length albums followed ‚Äì Cycling and Futuristic Experiments No. 005 on Background, Version on ~scape records, and the Powers of Ten for S√ºd Electronic in 2007. A rich and expansive record, Powers of Ten further explored his African heritage through a new lexicon of sonic influences, acquired from his home base in Portugal. Upon moving to Lisbon, He conceived of Bodycode, a more dancefloor-centric project that complements Portable's headier textures with a more body-moving aesthetic. As Bodycode, Abrahams harnesses his desire to \\"unlock the psyche via the body,\\" layering tech-funk with wisps of melody, heady effects, and a liberal wash of otherworldly vocal samples. Somewhere between the beats for the body and melody for the soul, Abrahams believes, lies the Bodycode. The result was Bodycode's first full-length, The Conservation of Electric Charge, a whirlwind of percussive, multi-layered techno released on Spectral Sound in 2006. After a three-year absence, Abrahams resurrected the moniker for second Spectral full-length, 2009's Immune, an intricately textured album of vocal-laced house. \\"I just felt it a good time for a warm, nurturing aesthetic,\\" says Abrahams of Bodycode's shift in tone, \\"We need that right now.‚Äù 2010 saw him re-locate to Berlin where he resides now.

Life  = Early years and education = Haji Murat Mosque, Resen Ahmed Niyazi Bey was born to a Tosk Albanian landowning family from Resne in 1873. His father was Abdullah Aga. Niyazi was educated at the Ottoman Civil Service Academy, and later at the Military High School in Monastir (modern Bitola). Many years later, he stated that he transferred to the Monastir school out of a desire to be taught by some of its instructors, who \\"[advocated] love for humanity, patria, progress, and society.\\" In his memoirs, Niyazi would recall that as a student in the 1880s he had heard Ottoman and French stories of patriotism, and been strongly influenced by them. He credited these stories, and the teachers who told them, with inculcating ideas of loyalty and love of country in him. He was particularly influenced by the Ottoman writer Namƒ±k Kemal; according to Niyazi, Kemal was frequently referred to when they discussed global issues. After completing his secondary schooling in Monastir, Niyazi studied at the Ottoman War Academy between 1894‚Äì1897. Like many other students who would eventually rise to hold officer ranks in the army, he received training from the German military, and developed a degree of respect for Germany. While studying in Istanbul, he was again exposed to the writing of Kemal, despite the fact that they were banned because they questioned the authoritarianism of Sultan Abdul Hamid II. Abdul Hamid had dissolved parliament and governed alone. According to Niyazi, Kemal's works inspired him; \\"an intoxicating patriotism prepared my heart, my innocent heart, for revolutions...\\", he later wrote. After reading Kemal's work, he told his friends that their education lacked patriotism. In 1896, Niyazi also renovated and upgraded the Haji Murat Mosque of Resne, built in 1612, with the rooms of the ground floor reserved for schooling and the remaining space for prayers. \\"–è–∞–º–∏—ò–∞—Ç–∞ –•–∞—ü–∏ –ú—É—Ä–∞—Ç–∏ (–ì–æ—Ä–Ω–∞ –è–∞–º–∏—ò–∞), —Å–µ –Ω–∞–æ—ì–∞ –≤–æ —Å–µ–≤–µ—Ä–Ω–∏–æ—Ç –¥–µ–ª –Ω–∞ –≥—Ä–∞–¥–æ—Ç, –∏–∑–≥—Ä–∞–¥–µ–Ω–∞ –≤–æ 1612 –≥–æ–¥–∏–Ω–∞ –Ω–∞ –ø—Ä–∏–∑–µ–º—ò–µ, —Ä–µ–Ω–æ–≤–∏—Ä–∞–Ω–∞ –∏ –Ω–∞–¥–≥—Ä–∞–¥–µ–Ω–∞ –≤–æ 1896 –≥–æ–¥–∏–Ω–∞ –æ–¥ –ê—Ö–º–µ—Ç –ù–∏—ò–∞–∑–∏ –±–µ—ò, —Å–æ –Ω–∞–º–µ–Ω–∞ –ø—Ä–∏–∑–µ–º–Ω–∏—Ç–µ –ø—Ä–æ—Å—Ç–æ—Ä–∏–∏ –¥–∞ —Å–µ –∫–æ—Ä–∏—Å—Ç–∞—Ç —ï–∞ —É—á–∏–ª–∏—à—Ç–µ, –∞ –∫–∞—Ç–æ—Ç –∑–∞ –º–æ–ª–∏—Ç–≤–∏.\\" = Young Turk membership and early military career = During his time training at the Istanbul War Academy, a fellow Ottoman officer Ismail Enver Bey initiated Niyazi into the Committee of Union and Progress (CUP) movement. He became a lieutenant (m√ºlazƒ±m) and joined the Ottoman army at a young age in 1896. Niyazi fought with distinction during the Greco-Turkish War (1897), in particular at the Battle of Be≈üpƒ±nar in Epirus, and returned to Istanbul with prisoners of war. Sultan Abdul Hamid II proposed that Niyazi become his aide- de-camp at the palace. Niyazi refused the offer due to the government campaign launched against suppressing the CUP and decided to return home. Among the CUP of his time, Niyazi became disillusioned with exiled opposition figure Murad Bey after he reconciled with the sultan and took a government position following an amnesty for Young Turk members. Niyazi despised the despotism of the sultan and nepotism at the royal court, where ranks and other positions were given at times to people with close social connections. Niyazi Bey in military gear (post 1908) Between 1899-1903 Niyazi was stationed in Ohri as an officer in charge of the ammunition depot in a company of reservists. During his time there he monitored the preparations of the Macedo-Bulgarians for an uprising and noticed how various Russian and Bulgarian missionaries, teachers, officers and advisers contributed to the organisation of this revolt. Through the press and his correspondence with Mecduddin Efendi, a captain based in Izmir, Niyazi followed the activities of the Young Turks within Europe, in particular the decisions and split of the CUP First Congress in Paris (1902). In August 1903, the Internal Macedonian Revolutionary Organisation (IMRO) staged an uprising against the Ottomans in Macedonia and Niyazi was assigned to the third regiment of the Ottoman Third Army. During these events he had an active role in the Monastir branch of the CUP with his status raised to war hero and had gained great notoriety among the Muslim Albanian population of Macedonia. Beginning from 1904 and for five years prior to the revolution he served in an Ottoman chasseur battalion becoming renown for the effective pursuit of bandits in mountainous terrain. Niyazi became committed to the ideas of Ahmed Rƒ±za, a CUP member who advocated for constitutional restoration through revolution and was against foreign intervention in the empire or reforms for a specific community based on preferential treatment. Military service and a deteriorating security situation in Macedonia affected individuals such as Niyazi who felt that the plight of local Muslims was little known and like other peoples in the region had experienced attacks due to guerilla activity. He was influenced by reforms implemented in the region by the empire under pressure from the Great Powers after the Ilinden revolt of 1903. Niyazi thought that European powers were pushing Ottoman Christians into uprisings against the state to defeat the empire and wanted to prevent the development of propaganda by the Russians and Austrians in Macedonia. He felt that Ottomans were viewed negatively in the West and that the Great Powers did not care about the majority Muslim population of Macedonia, as they wanted to partition the empire. Niyazi and his colleagues preferred to preserve the empire with all its multiethnic and multireligious population and denounced attacks by reactionary Muslims against Christians, yet they had limited knowledge of Ottoman politics. Coming from an area where the strongest supporters of the Young Turks among Albanians in the Balkans originated from central and southern Macedonia, those events motivated Niyazi to become part of the (CUP). He became an army captain (kolaƒüasƒ±). The position was obtained for him by the CUP through its powerful underground influence in government and Niyazi was stationed in Resne where the committee thought he could be most useful toward the cause. At Resne he played an influential role in recruiting people into the CUP. In military operations against bands, Niyazi's actions were done on behalf of the CUP instead of the Ottoman government. Niyazi had a reputation of being an Albanian with close connections to other Albanians living in Macedonia, possessed strong authority among fellow Muslims in the area where he resided and could communicate with them as he spoke both Albanian (his mother tongue) and Turkish. =Young Turk Revolution (1908) = Planning for revolution Niyazi Bey's house in Resen, 1909 Niyazi was an important member of the councils held by the Young Turks. Starting from March 1908 some soldiers initiated mutinies after the CUP organised meetings and encouraged them to demand better work conditions. Niyazi stated that troops who achieved redress attributed their success to the committee. CUP publications calling for action against the sultan and prevention of foreign occupation like ≈ûura-yƒ± √úmmet, Mechveret Supplement Fran√ßais and Ahmed Rƒ±za's pamphlet on the army influenced junior officers such as Niyazi who described their \\"extraordinary impact in illuminating minds\\". Following a meeting in Reval between Tsar Nicholas II and Edward VII (9-12 June 1908) rumors of a partition of Macedonia through imminent Russo-British intervention spread and were accelerated by the CUP, whereas Niyazi took it as a signal to act immediately. At the time Niyazi heard rumors regarding the Reval meeting and experienced three sleepless nights that left him \\"flushed with anxiety and excitement\\" which shaped his conviction that he \\"found salvation in sacrifice and death\\". He discussed matters with the local CUP membership and the CUP Monastir branch that followed on with a decision by Niyazi to form a band and head into the mountains. Niyazi Bey in the center with his band in 1908. Hoca Cemal Efendi, the town mayor can be seen in white turban and black robe two men to Niyazi's left. On 28 June 1908 Niyazi at his home advised Hoca Cemal Efendi, the mayor and Tahir Efendi, the police commissioner of Resne to form a band and on 29 June repeated those calls to a larger group of Muslims where he inscribed on his hat the words \\"H√ºrriyet ya da √∂l√ºm\\" (freedom or death). The group was placed under the direction of the CUP. Niyazi modeled his guerilla band on Bulgarian, Serb and Greek bands operating in Macedonia that had been formed in the preceding decade in the region. In his memoirs Niyazi wrote that he formed his CUP band on 28 June 1908, yet for some time before that he had been giving confiscated weapons from Macedo-Bulgarian villages to fellow members as CUP headquarters planned to mobilise bands from mid-June. Cemal Efendi, as the mayor of Resen, a spiritual leader (Sufi cleric) and a member of the Young Turks had traveled to Monastir for talks with its CUP branch about the details of action to be taken and had obtained approval.  Start of revolution  Resne Ottoman army barracks reused as a secondary school in modern Resen In July the CUP conspiracy involving Niyazi was uncovered by the military mufti of the Ottoman Third Army stationed in Monastir. The mufti, a palace spy and police agent was shot and wounded to stop him from reporting back to Istanbul. A military commission was sent from Istanbul to investigate subversion within the army in the area. Fearing discovery on 3 July 1908 Niyazi spread rumors of an approaching Bulgarian band and lured out most of the Resne garrison and its commanding officers from the town. In Resne, as some other officers were attending Friday prayers, Niyazi along with mayor Cemal Efendi, police commissioner Tahir Efendi, tax commissioner Tahsin Effendi and two hundred men raided the military depot. From the Resne depot they seized fifteen boxes of ammunition, seventy rifles that were given to volunteers and 600 Ottoman liras from the garrison safe that was divided among people within the band. All escaped from Resne into the nearby mountains from where Niyazi initiated the Young Turk Revolution and issued a proclamation that called for the restoration of the constitution of 1876 without specifically mentioning the CUP. On the night prior to his departure Niyazi entrusted the care of his family to his brother in law Ismail Hakki Bey, an Albanian national awakening figure. Forest and hilly terrain surrounding the former Ottoman barracks, Resen Initially composed of 160-240 volunteers (mostly of Albanian descent), Niyazi's band was named the CUP Resne National battalion. The group consisted of civilian supporters who were in the belief that they were in pursuit of a Bulgarian band and CUP members involved in plotting the revolution from 28 June. Nine soldiers from Niyazi's battalion participated and once in the mountains thirty more volunteers from the Prespa region joined. Later, the initial reason of pursuing a Macedo-Bulgarian band was discarded and Niyazi informed his troops and volunteers that there was no such band and four of his soldiers left and returned to the Resne barracks. Niyazi's band grew to 500 troops at the end of the first week and was joined by 800 armed civilians in the mountains. In short time the band was joined by two more officers, other officials and people from the Prespa region. Niyazi sought to build his support base among local Muslims as the uprising was mainly a Muslim movement. To gain the support of Muslim villagers, officers focused on local issues of discontent with government, lack of services such as schools and roads, heavy taxation and protection from roaming armed bands as opposed to invoking the constitution. Niyazi also undertook other measures such as forcing local clans into truces were blood feud was active among northern Geg and some southern Tosk Albanians. In Albanian villages officers induced locals to make a besa (oath) of support. The band grew as they visited surrounding Albanian Muslim villages adding local Albanian notables, Muslim bands, army deserters and other volunteers into its ranks. Niyazi presented his 'national battalion' as a patriotic Ottoman band and that made it recognisable for other similar bands, Albanian Tosk nationalists, deserters and criminals to join the group. The deserters and criminals referred to by Niyazi as \\"vile blackguards\\" due to their \\"past crimes\\" took oaths and joined his band after he granted them a pardon. The well developed imperial telegraph network was used by Niyazi and on behalf of his band he sent proclamations to provincial and local officials along with the palace that demanded injustices and inequality be combated and the constitution restored. Ottoman authorities that Niyazi addressed through appeals and ultimatums were a declaration to the Governor General in Monastir, Inspectorate General of Rumelia and Palace secretariat along with letters of accusation to the Gendarme Officer of Resne and Commandant of the Gendarmerie in Monastir. He also made appeals addressed to various social and ethnic groups in the empire. It is unclear whether the CUP had a fixed date for the revolution and in comments to a journalist following the event Niyazi said that they acted earlier than was planned, but did not give a date for the predetermined day. Niyazi also stated that documents with details giving information to executors about certain plans were according to strict CUP orders burned by branch executive committees.  Spread of the revolution  Niyazi Bey (first row, centre) with other CUP members, 1908 At the same time and following Niyazi's example, Enver Bey in Tikve≈ü, Ey√ºp Sabri in Ohri and Bekir Fikri in Grebene were three of several officers who went into the mountains and formed guerilla bands (√ßetes). From the outset in July Sabri worked closely with Niyazi. No order had come from the Young Turk (CUP) committee in Salonica and instead the uprising developed spontaneously as news spread from one Ottoman army unit to another and among the various local CUP committees. For the revolt to get local support Niyazi and Enver played on fears of possible foreign intervention. Notables of Resne supported Niyazi's band as Muslims in much of the town and surrounding villages were CUP members. Niyazi's reasons for going against the sultan was to defend liberty, initiate reforms for both Muslims and Christians and was of the view that \\"Rather than live basely, i have preferred to die... either death or the salvation of the fatherland\\". To deal with Niyazi and other guerilla bands formed by deserting Ottoman soldiers, Abdul Hamid II sent general Shemsi Pasha with two battalions to Resne and while in Monastir he was assassinated on 7 July by an Ottoman officer and CUP revolutionary Atƒ±f Kam√ßƒ±l. For the revolution the murder was a turning point that demoralised the palace and it removed a dangerous opponent for the CUP that could have mobilised Albanians against their forces. Ahmet Tevfik Pasha, the Ottoman foreign minister sent letters to Ottoman ambassadors. He described the palace position on events and accused Niyazi of organising bands made up of deserters, subversives and other people influenced by such individuals and instructed them to inform foreign governments and the press.  Overtures to the Macedo-Bulgarian population  Niyazi Bey (first row, second left) with Bulgarian revolutionaries, 1908 Niyazi made several overtures to the local Macedo-Bulgarian population of the Resne area to join the revolution. During the revolution, a sister of an IMRO voyvoda (chieftain) whose band Niyazi annihilated years earlier asked him to rescue her kidnapped son from a Serbian band. Viewing the appeal as a \\"blessing of God\\", Niyazi took a Serb teacher from Resne as hostage to force the Serbian band to release the child. The Serb teacher eventually became a CUP member translating Niyazi's appeals into Bulgarian and Serbian while also assisting him in establishing contacts with Serb villagers and forcing the Serb band to release the boy. Among local Macedo-Bulgarians the image of Niyazi was boosted with the release of the child. A local band leader who was his foe and badly beaten by Niyazi in 1906 joined the CUP band and told him that \\"now i will die for you\\". Amidst these events an appeal was issued by Niyazi to local Bulgarians that outsiders would not be allowed to rule the region and placed blame on the government and its \\"corrupt officials\\" for \\"causing bad things to happen\\". He promised justice and equality for Bulgarians while warning that people disobeying those \\"orders\\" would be hung, a punishment extended to notables of a settlement if a band entered a town or village and CUP authorities were not informed. Approving of Niyazi's actions the CUP Monastir branch cautioned against the recruitment by force of \\"Bulgarian or other Christian\\" people into his band.  Recruitment of Albanians  fezes overwhelmingly outnumbered all others.\\" (See for example, the book cover.)\\" \\"In the available photographs of the \\"national battalions\\" and the local bands that had joined them, Albanians with white fezzes overwhelmingly outnumbered all others. These people, including Adjutant-Major Ahmed Niyazi\\" At first Albanian recruits into the CUP originating from the army and among other coreligionists that came from Ohri, Resne, and Monastir were accepted and those from the Albanian committee rejected. Niyazi placed his efforts on mobilizing and working with Albanians for the cause such as his comrades in the army and as circumstances changed during the revolution he also recruited prominent individuals like √áer√ßiz Topulli whom he regarded as \\"the Chief of the Tosk Committee of Albanians\\". During those attempts to secure Albanian support, Niyazi commented that Albanians complained about the Turks focusing on their own nationalist interests. In Albanian inhabited territories, Niyazi visited Elbasan, Kor√ß√´, Debre and Ohri whereas his revolutionary methods involved expelling Ottoman officials, tax collectors and creating Albanian militia to maintain order. Niyazi sent a letter to Topulli inviting him for a meeting to talk about conditions for a union. Representatives from Topulli met with Niyazi in Kor√ß√´. Albanian delegates accused the Turks of lacking commitment to Ottomanism resulting in their struggle to defend themselves from foreigners and Ottomans, whereas Niyazi replied that Turks made much effort toward promoting Ottomanism with the creation of the CUP being evidence of that endeavour. Revolutionary support from Kor√ß√´ rested upon the condition for the establishment of Albanian autonomy and during negotiations with Albanian committee members Niyazi accepted their proposal for an autonomous Albania to be administered under a governor selected by the sultan. After the discussion Albanian delegates accepted the CUP invitation. All joined through an oath ceremony and were enrolled with promises to bring Topulli and other prominent Albanian committee members for a final meeting to talk about details of the agreement. Ahmet Niyazi Bey, 1908 Hyrsev Starova Bey, a local Albanian notable and friend of Niyazi's father was tasked with arranging the meeting that was scheduled to occur in Pogradec. Hyrsev also contacted Hysen Baba, an Albanian Bektashi sheikh from the Mel√ßan tekke who acted as mediator between Niyazi and Topulli that influenced the latter along with other brigand leaders to support the CUP cause. Niyazi viewed the meeting as mainly unimportant due to local Albanians already pledging allegiance to the CUP. During negotiations with Albanian committee members the significance of Albanian participation made Niyazi remark that \\"most of the leaders and partisans of [the movement for] constitutional administration were not Turkish\\". The Kor√ß√´ Albanian committee lent support to Niyazi and at the request of the CUP called upon guerillas based in the mountains around Kor√ß√´ to join Ottoman insurgent bands with the Ohri Albanian committee heeding the directive. Topulli was hard pressed by fellow Albanians to meet with Niyazi to talk about joint action and he arrived in Pogradec with his band on 21 July 1908. Niyazi also worked to recruit other Muslim guerilla bands to the revolutionary cause. Throughout the revolution, guerilla bands of both Niyazi and Enver were Muslim (mostly Albanian) paramilitaries. Niyazi described that Albanian Tosk bands and Bulgarian bands had been united under Topulli in Ohri. Topulli's guerilla band gave important support to Niyazi and his forces during their capture of the Resne garrison and the event was a small military victory in the campaign to oust the Hamidian regime. Niyazi's band numbered 2000 men in the third week of the revolution and he along with Enver got like minded officials and civilian notables to send multiple petitions to the Ottoman place. Activists in Kosovo organised a large demonstration in support of Niyazi and the wider anti- Hamidian opposition. Many of the Muslim Albanians involved in the revolution like Niyazi saw themselves as CUP members first and not as Albanian activists. Unlike organisers such as Behaeddin Shakir and Talaat Pasha, Niyazi and other Albanians involved in revolutionary actions did not have decision making positions within the CUP, yet they felt that the revolution was an Albanian undertaking and expected in return special treatment.  Declaration of constitutional government and end of revolution  Niyazi's band adopted a deer that appeared to them while they were in a village near Monastir, as the animal was interpreted by the group as a spiritual guide sent by god directing them toward their objective. Tatar Osman Pasha, Shemsi's replacement was kidnapped after the Resne band of Niyazi, the Ohri band of Sabri and two Albanian bands conducted an attack on Monastir. On 22 July Monastir was captured on orders from the CUP with news of Niyazi's actions reaching Salonica early in the morning on 23 July and was spread all over Macedonia by the CUP controlled telegraph service. Niyazi proclaimed the constitution on 23 July in front of large crowds of Muslims and Christians, Ottoman officials, the town garrison and battalions from other areas gathered in Monastir, actions that were simultaneously replicated in several towns of Macedonia. On 23 July Niyazi returned to Resne and met with guerilla leaders Topulli and Mihal Grameno where he expressed his gratitude and viewed the declaration of the CUP constitution as advantageous for the Albanian nation. The worsening situation in the Ottoman Balkan provinces and lack of government control along with army desertions motivated the sultan to issue an imperial decree restoring the 1876 constitution on 24 July 1908. = Post revolution = Ottoman poster celebrating the 1908 revolution. Niyazi is depicted in the lower right hand corner with a large mustache freeing Liberty, personified as a woman, from her chains. In the aftermath of the revolution Niyazi and Enver remained in the political background due to their youth and junior military ranks with both agreeing that photographs of them would not be disturbed to the general public, yet this decision was rarely observed. Instead Niyazi and Enver as leaders of the revolution elevated their positions into near legendary status with their images placed on postcards and distributed throughout the Ottoman state. During the revolution the Manakis brothers had photographed Niyazi and their pictures reconstructed him as an ordinary man of the people with his prominent dust covered mustache giving an appearance of a recent arrival from the hills commanding rebels. In one iconic photograph showing Niyazi and his famous deer they are portrayed as the materialisation of freedom with him and his rifle depicting a military figure of power represented by his surrounding soldiers and bandits. In other photographs taken by the Manakis brothers of the revolution, Niyazi is present alongside revolutionaries Topulli and Grameno. Niyazi also appeared on a prominent poster as a figure with a big mustache having freed Liberty personified by a women from her chains and surrounded by other figures from the revolution. Toward the latter part of 1908, photographs of Niyazi and Enver had reached Istanbul and among school children in the city immersed in fanfare, they played with masks that depicted the revolutionaries. In other images produced of the time the new sultan Mehmed V is presented in the centre flanked by Niyazi and Enver to either side. As the actions of both men carried the appearance of initiating the revolution, Niyazi, an Albanian and Enver, a Turk (with Albanian heritage on his mother's sideMazaower, Mark \\"Salonica, City of Ghosts: Christians, Muslims and Jews 1430-1950.\\") later got popular acclaim as \\"heroes of freedom\\" (h√ºrriyet kahramanlarƒ±) and symbolised Albanian-Turkish cooperation. Niyazi was also known by the sobriquets \\"Hero of the Revolution\\" and the \\"Turkish Garibaldi\\". Postcard of Mehmed V flanked by Niyazi Bey (left) and Enver Bey (right) Soon after the success of the revolution, Niyazi attempting to raise hopes for the new order condemned the former Hamidian regime in a speech delivered in Resne and it was published in a pamphlet during 1908. Niyazi warned his audience about the risks of Macedonia and Anatolia becoming colonies of other countries like other former Ottoman territories. In 1908 the CUP committee held its congress at the conclusion of the revolution and agreed to publish Niyazi's memoirs as a book which appeared toward the end of the year. The Committee wanted Niyazi to exaggerate the role the CUP played in the revolution and give the appearance that they directed all actions during those events. Later in 1910 they were published by the CUP Monastir Central Committee in Istanbul and the memoirs consist of detailed biographical information about Niyazi from 1887-1908 relating to his military action and politics in Macedonia. Niyazi felt the military and political hierarchy blamed him for his personal fame arising from the revolution and he was compelled to justify it in his memoirs. His memories of events also contain contradictions and in his introduction Niyazi warns the reader that the memoirs are not a complete account of the revolution and they should not rely on it having revelations about the history or way the CUP was founded. Niyazi's memoirs are full of information about the Lake Prespa region, the towns of Resne and Ohri and he highlighted the contributions of Albanians during the revolution for its success and his efforts to gain their support. As with documents he published that included letters and telegraphs which were sent or received, Niyazi kept insisting in his memoirs on the action he took and conducted personally along with his group while little attention was devoted toward Enver. In his memoirs Niyazi enriched them with photographs taken of him and his revolutionaries by the Manakis brothers. For a limited period the self glorifying memoirs of Niyazi were a prime text for the revolutionaries. Niyazi Bey (right) and Enver Bey (left) on an Ottoman postcard celebrating the 1908 Young Turk Revolution In the aftermath of the revolution, CUP unity gave way to personal rivalries which by March 1909, rumor had it that Niyazi had fallen out with the main views of the Young Turks and began to have a liberal outlook regarding the situation in Macedonia. Niyazi was a delegate representing Resne at the Congress of Dibra (July 1909) organised by the CUP regarding Albanian ethno-linguistic rights. He refused to sign any resolutions due to disagreements with other delegates over its contents. Niyazi was a CUP member till his death and never managed to generate a considerable following among prominent and other rank CUP members apart from his involvement during the revolution. The Ottoman newspaper Volkan, a strong supporter of the constitution published adulatory pieces about Niyazi and Enver in 1909. = Counterrevolution (1909) and retirement from army = A group of mainly Albanian soldiers stationed in Istanbul mutinied after CUP authorities planned to replace them with other army units from Macedonia and they attempted an Ottoman countercoup in 1909 to undo the 1908 revolution. The Ottoman Third Army, stationed in Macedonia and led by Mahmud Shevket Pasha was joined by Niyazi who brought 1,800 men from Resne. Niyazi led volunteer units consisting mainly of Albanians that reinforced regular army units and he played a leading role in suppressing the counterrevolution. Together in military operations that were directed by a fellow Albanian Ali Pasha Kolonja they retook Istanbul (23 April) with little resistance from the mutineers and deposed sultan Abdul Hamid II. After those events he retired from the army and he devoted himself to the development of Resne where he built public buildings, schools and a palatial home, the Saraj. The construction of the Saraj began in 1905 after Niyazi received a postcard of Versailles that inspired his desire to have a French-style estate whose exterior was completed in 1909 after the CUP revolution. As he died years later in Albania, Niyazi never lived to see his estate completed. By 1911 Niyazi still remained in Resne and barely hid his exasperation at the deteriorating security situation in Macedonia related to fighting between guerilla bands and Ottoman forces. = Sultan's Balkan tour (1911) = The Saraj of Resen, built by Niyazi Bey in the early 1900s The Albanian uprisings of 1910 and 1911 made the CUP send Mehmed V on a goodwill tour of Kosovo and Macedonia during June 1911 to recover loyalty from the Albanians, inspire patriotism and solidarity among local peoples and to counter nationalism. Niyazi arrived with 600 men from Resne and as a M√ºcahit-i Muhterem (honoured fighter) the sultan received him in Salonica on 9 June. Due to his Albanian ethnicity, role as hero of the revolution and being a revered yet politically marginal CUP member Niyazi became a central figure in the royal tour of Macedonia. On 11 June, the sultan proceeded to √úsk√ºp on a slow seven-hour train ride with many stopovers and Niyazi traveled on a separate pilot train in front of the imperial entourage with an announcement that anyone seen coming close to the tracks would be shot. Later after returning from Kosovo the sultan visited Monastir where Niyazi reenacted scenes from the revolution such as the entry into town by soldiers under his command in 1908. The reenactment by Niyazi also involved Ey√ºp Sabri where both men wore their old clothes, rode horses accompanied by a gun carriage with the event recorded on camera by the Manakis brothers. The film titled Sultan Re≈°ad's Visit to Bitola is currently preserved in the Macedonian Archives. = Balkan Wars (1912-1913) and death = During the Balkan Wars (1912-1913), Niyazi and his Resne regiment remained until the end of the conflict and fought alongside Cavit Pasha. In April 1913 he arrived in Vlor√´ to board a ferry departing for Istanbul where he was shot by four men on the port docks. No one claimed responsibility for his death as rumors of the time speculated that either someone having a personal vendetta, an Albanian nationalist or a CUP rival ordered the assassination. Niyazi was killed by Albanian committee members who were the men of Ismail Toptani and Ismail Qemali. As the death of Niyazi was the result of people close to him and not of war or battles, the event is remembered in a Turkish proverb as \\"Ne ≈üehittir ne gazi, hi√ß yoluna gitti Niyazi\\" (Niyazi is neither a martyr nor a fighter, he died for nothing).  Personal life and family  Niyazi was married to Feride Hanƒ±m (d. 1966), who originated from an old Istanbulite family in the Sara√ßhaneba≈üƒ± (Sara√ßhane) neighbourhood of Fatih district of the city. He had two sons Mithat (b. 1911) and Saim (b. 1913) with Feride and during the Balkan Wars she went back to Istanbul. Niyazi has descendants from both sons in Istanbul and they carry the surname Resnelioƒülu in honour of their ancestor. The Resnelioƒülu family unsuccessfully lobbied the Turkish government in the 1980s-1990s for assistance to have the body of Niyazi exhumed from Vlor√´, Albania and reburied in Turkey at the Hill of Eternal Freedom (H√ºrriyet-i Ebediye Tepesi).  Cultural references  Niyazi Beg (Niyazi Bey) street in modern Resen As a tribute to his role in the Young Turk Revolution that began the Second Constitutional Era of the Ottoman Empire, Niyazi is mentioned along with Enver in the March of the Deputies ( or Meclis-i Mebusan Mar≈üƒ±), the anthem of the Chamber of Deputies, the lower house of the Ottoman parliament. It was performed in 1909 upon the opening of the parliament. The fourth line of the anthem reads \\"Long live Niyazi, long live Enver\\" (). In the 1910s Niyazi was mentioned other songs that reflected the Young Turks move toward a Turcocentric ideology. para. 27.

Officially ' (Holy Cross), the large church in the Rheingau region is called Dom although it was never a bishop's seat. The present building was begun in the 16th century, but major features such as an expansion of the nave from three to five vaults, the towers, the organ and several altars were added in the 19th century. The parish is part of the Diocese of Limburg.  History  The present building began as a late-Gothic hall church, built mostly from 1510 to 1518. It succeeded a Romanesque church first mentioned in 1146. In 1829, the west towers had to be demolished because they were unsafe. The architect Philipp Hoffmann, who was born in Geisenheim, proposed to expand the church and build a new facade and towers. Hoffmann, who later built landmarks in Wiesbaden such as St. Bonifatius and the Russian Church, expanded the nave by adding two more vaults similar to the three Gothic ones, and created a new west facade with neo-Gothic towers. The large church is called Dom although it was never a bishop's seat. The towers were restored from 2010 to 2014. The celebration of the completion was on Pentecost 2014, with a \\"Mass of All Saints\\" by Alan Wilson, performed by church choir and children's choir conducted by Florian Brachtendorf. The church is a venue of the Rheingau Musik Festival and other concerts, including choral concerts of the Rheingauer Kantorei.  Interior  Marienaltar Features from the Gothic structure are the vault and the '. The high altar in neo-Gothic style was installed in 1886. Another neo-Gothic altar, the ', was created by Caspar Weis in 1894. The organ was commissioned in 1839 and built in 1842 by ', with 31 stops, two keyboards and pedal. It is the largest instrument with two manuals that the company built. In 1987, the organ was restored to its original state of the Romantic period. Martin L√ºcker played in 2012 a concert with a program that Albert Schweitzer had performed in Frankfurt in 1928 on a similar instrument that was destroyed.

The statue contains an error in that Ruth is depicted with a right-handed fielder's glove, for wear on the left hand. Ruth threw left-handed. Statue Although he became famous as a New York Yankee, George Herman Ruth's roots are in Baltimore, where he was born, grew up, and learned how to play baseball. Babe's Dream portrays Ruth as a young man, about the time he started out as a rookie, as Luery wanted to portray Babe's longing for the big leagues and to find an escape from his harsh childhood. Ruth was born on February 6, 1895, to hardworking parents who couldn't support a child that caused as much ‚Äúmischief‚Äù as Babe. At age seven, his parents decided to ‚Äústraighten him out‚Äù by sending him to Baltimore's St. Mary's Industrial School for Boys, where he could learn how to have more discipline. This turned out to be the beginning of the star's true love for the game of baseball. Babe Ruth is a legend in the world of baseball. He played baseball for 22 years, setting the records for career home runs at 714 and holding that record until 1974 when Hank Aaron surpassed it. Ruth is credited with changing the game of baseball in America, and his hometown wanted to present his accomplishments by dedicating a statue to him and his legend. Luery portrayed Ruth as a fierce competitor as he is gazing out into the future. ‚ÄúA man looking at his destiny,‚Äù is how Susan Luery put it. ‚ÄúHis poise was in the sense of determination that he was a great player,‚Äù she said. ‚ÄúHe‚Äôs facing out ‚Äì he had everything in front of him. Ruth‚Äôs career rose pretty much straight into the record books from there.‚Äù Artist Susan Luery was born in Baltimore, Maryland, and attended the Maryland Institute College of Art where she learned to refine her work. Luery researched Ruth by reading books and talking to people with both knowledge of Ruth and baseball so she could ‚Äúconnect‚Äù with the subject. She also had a look-alike model come to her studio while she worked on the statue. It took her seven months to form the 28-inch model statue before creating the large- scale version. She produced the 16-foot statue a year later, in 1994, and it was placed in the Camden Yards on Babe Ruth's 100th birthday in February 1995. The statue was officially unveiled at an Orioles game where Luery and Ruth's daughter, Julia Ruth Stevens, threw out the game ball in celebration.

It was followed a few days later by the Essential National Industries and Designated Corporations Regulations 2011. Background: the 2006 coup On 5 December 2006, Commodore Voreqe Bainimarama, head of the Republic of Fiji Military Forces, overthrew democratically elected indigenous nationalist conservative Prime Minister Laisenia Qarase, and took his place at the head of an \\"interim government,\\" composed of both civilian and military ministers. Bainimarama stated that his main reasons for overthrowing the Qarase government were that it was corrupt, and that it was conducting racially discriminatory policies against the country's Indo-Fijian minority - namely its policy of \\"affirmative action\\" in favour of the indigenous majority. In a speech publicly announcing the coup, he stated that Qarase's policies had \\"divided the nation now and will have very serious consequences to our future generations.\\" He promised to amend the race-based electoral rolls, so as to \\"lead us into peace and prosperity and mend the ever widening racial divide that currently besets our multicultural nation\\".\\"Commander RFMF - Public Declaration of Military Takeover\\" , Fiji government, 5 December 2006 Subsequently, his government abolished the Constitution and imposed strict censorship of the media.\\"Bainimarama says he is the future\\", Michael Field, Stuff.co.nz, 17 April 2009 The government and trade unions prior to the decree For several months, there had been considerable concern, expressed particularly by foreign trades union organisations, about restrictions on the rights of unions in Fiji, including acts of violence against unionists. In February 2011, Amnesty International expressed concern about \\"the reported detention and beating of several trade unionists\\" in Fiji.\\"Fiji: Arbitrary detentions and beatings must stop\\", Amnesty International, 24 February 2011 In March, the Trades Union Congress in the United Kingdom sent a protest to the Fiji High Commission in London, and issued the following statement: :\\"On 12 February, Felix Anthony was taken from his home by 3 uniformed military officers and subjected to threats whilst being driven around the back roads of Lautoka for some 2 hours. His family, including his children, were also threatened. On 18 February, Anthony and other union officials from the sugar industry were called to meet the Fijian Prime Minister at a sugar mill in Ba, on the western side of Fiji. The union representatives were subsequently assaulted by military officers while still at the mill, then taken to Namaka military barracks and subjected to further beatings. As they were released from the barracks, they were again threatened with further violence.\\"\\"Fiji: End military intimidation and beatings of union officials\\" , Trades Union Congress, March 2011 In July, Australia's Transport Workers Union threatened to disrupt flights to Fiji unless Qantas took steps to protect its Fiji-based workers \\"from state-sanctioned violence.\\" This followed claims by Fijian union members, particularly baggage handlers, that they had been punched, kicked and \\"hit with rubber belts\\" by soldiers questioning their loyalty to the government. The New Zealand Council of Trade Unions said it shared the Australian union's concerns, and issued the following statement: \\"We are very concerned about the physical intimidation and beatings of union officials in Fiji and also the decrees that remove work rights\\".\\"NZ unions consider Fiji bans\\", ABC Radio Australia, 19 July 2011 In August, the Australian Council of Trade Unions condemned the police break-up of a meeting of the Fiji Trades Union Congress in Nadi.\\"More trouble in paradise: harassment of Fijian trade unions by military Government worsens\\", ACTU media release, 13 August 2011 The same month, Brendan Barber, General Secretary of the British TUC, wrote again to the Fiji High Commissioner in London, to express :\\"outrage over the arrest of Mr Daniel Urai, President, Fiji Trades Union Congress, on 3 August 2011 in Suva. We note that the arrest of the FTUC President comes in the wake of the introduction of a new decree which further restricts the exercise of trade union and human rights in Fiji under the military regime. The arrests of trade unionists are a gross violation of the ILO Declaration of Fundamental Principles and Rights at Work. Moreover, Fiji, which ratified Convention 98(1974) and Convention 87 (2002), is obliged to observe the workers' rights enshrined in them. Furthermore, these incidents constitute a serious impediment to Fiji's long overdue return to democracy, tarnish the image of your country and further aggravate the current difficulties, making social dialogue and reconciliation even more difficult.\\"\\"Arrest of Mr Daniel Urai, President of Fiji Trades Union Congress\\" , Trades Union Congress, 4 August 2011 The New Zealand Council of Trade Unions and Amnesty International Aotearoa New Zealand held a protest following Urai's arrest for unlawful assembly. Helen Kelly, President of the CTU, stated that \\"earlier in the year, Felix Anthony of the FTUC was physically assaulted. The regime is perpetrating a deliberate attack on trade union rights by issuing decrees making it almost impossible for unions to function and removing internationally recognized civil rights of freedom of assembly and collective bargaining.\\"\\"Human and trade union rights on trial in Fiji today\\" , New Zealand Council of Trade Unions Terms of the decree The decree was officially issued by the President of Fiji, Epeli Nailatikau, whose role as head of State is an essentially ceremonial one. Its main stated objective is to \\"ensure the present and continued viability and sustainability of essential national industries for the benefit of Fiji\\". Its terms are as follows: * All existing trade unions must re-register in order to continue their activities (art.6); * \\"All existing collective agreements\\" between employees and their employers are voided 60 days after the commencement of the decree (art.8); * Elections of trade union representatives are subject to government approval (art.10); * An employer may appeal to the government to cancel a representative's election if he or she at any time has \\"reliable objective information and evidence\\" that \\"at least 35% of workers\\" no longer support that representative (art.15); this enables the employer to cancel any \\"existing or current collective agreement\\" (art.17); * \\"If an employer has suffered operating losses for two consecutive fiscal years, or two years of actual or expected operating losses in a three year period, it shall have the immediate right to renegotiate all its existing collective agreements\\". If no agreement can be reached with employees, the employer then sends a proposal to the government, which may approve it as binding upon employees, replacing any necessity for an agreement (art.23); * Within \\"designated corporations\\", employees have no entitlement to overtime pay on Saturdays, Sundays or public holidays, unless granted by the employer (art.24); * Art.24 also abolishes the Wages Council's jurisdiction over \\"any 'designated corporation' or essential national industry\\"; * \\"Disputes over discipline and discharge\\" are to be settled within the company, or by the government if ultimately unresolved, with no recourse to any court of law or any judicial institution (art.26); * \\"No job actions, strikes, sick outs, slowdowns or other financially or operationally harmful activities shall be permitted at any time for any reason\\". Strikes are permitted only if employees have been negotiating unsuccessfully for at least three years for a collective agreement with their employer, and if they thereupon provide twenty-eight days' advance notice of the strike to their employer and to the government, and if the government approves the requested strike. The employer may then lock out any striking workers and \\"unilaterally impose terms and conditions of employment\\". Any worker taking part in an unauthorised strike may face a sentence of up to five years' imprisonment, combined with a fine of up to $50,000. The government may order the end of any strike (or lockout) in \\"any essential national industry\\" at any time (art.27); * The decree prevails over any inconsistency with any existing law (art.28); * No court of law, tribunal or commission has any jurisdiction to examine the legality or validity of the decree or of any decision made by the government or by any employer in application thereof (art.30). Terms of the regulations The Essential National Industries and Designated Corporations Regulations 2011 were issued by Commodore Bainimarama on 8 September \\"in exercise of the powers vested in me by section 31\\" of the Decree, to come into force the following day. They provided a list of the country's \\"essential national industries\\", as determined by Bainimarama. They are: the Australia & New Zealand Banking Group, the Bank of Baroda, the Bank South Pacific, the Westpac Banking Corporation, the Fiji Revenue & Customs Authority, Fiji International Telecommunications, Telecom Fiji, the Fiji Broadcasting Corporation, Air Pacific, the Fiji Electricity Authority, and the Water Authority of Fiji. Rationale and reactions =Government and Fiji press= Attorney General Aiyaz Sayed-Khaiyum played down the idea that there was anything exceptional about the Decree, during a press conference prior to its finalisation. He argued that \\"some countries restrict any strikes in essential services\\", and that \\"the principle of essential services is not anything new\\". In response to union reactions, he argued that the decree would actually preserve jobs: \\"We have found in companies that are financially unstable that if certain steps aren‚Äôt taken, they could close down therefore there‚Äôll be job losses. Unionists that are not employees don‚Äôt have a particular self interest in preserving or maintaining the life of the company. You have to maintain the life of the company to make sure jobs are secure\\".\\"Union/govt face off: Decree deepens division\\" , Islands Business The Fiji Times, subject to government censorship, reported simply that \\"[t]he terms of the Essential National Industries (Employment) Decree 2011 [...] will govern the labour laws of the declared enterprises, ensuring the viability and sustainability of the industries while protecting fundamental workers' rights\\". It quoted Sayed- Khaiyum's statement that \\"[t]he Government takes providing for and protecting workers' rights very seriously\\".\\"Essential industries\\", Fiji Times, 11 September 2011 The Fiji Sun published an explanatory article by the Ministry of Information, including a list of \\"frequently asked questions\\" to reassure readers. To the question \\"Does the decree remove workers‚Äô right to strike, as some have claimed?\\", the answer provided is: \\"No. The decree upholds the fundamental principle that workers may strike. Just as many other countries do, it makes it subject to certain conditions, including providing employees with a vote in favour or against it.\\" And to the question \\"Are employers allowed to impose terms and conditions on workers?\\", the answer given is: \\"A due process must be followed as set out in the decree, involving good faith negotiations for at least 60 days in the case of a replacement agreement. Only after that would an employer have the right to implement new terms and conditions. Employees would have the right to appeal to the Minister for a review of the new terms.\\" The final question is \\"What is your response to the claim that the Government has wiped out decades of advances for its workers?\\", with the government responding: :\\"In support of the great strides Fijian workers have made in recent time, the Fijian Government‚Äôs labour and employment protection benefits are responsible, comprehensive and genuine. The Fijian Government takes seriously the need to balance the well-being of Fiji‚Äôs economy and its ability to provide jobs with the intent to improve the quality of life for all Fijians and, importantly, to uphold justice and promote fundamental workers‚Äô rights. :We do not believe these are mutually exclusive goals. We continue to strive to ensure our body of employment and labour laws uphold our duty and commitment to the Fijian people. Meanwhile, trade unions cannot be allowed to hold essential industries ransom by blocking changes to terms and conditions and taking damaging strike action with impunity.\\"\\"What work laws mean\\", article by the Ministry of Information in the Fiji Sun, 14 September 2011 =Criticism= No public protests or demonstrations are allowed in Fiji, but the Fiji Trades Union Congress issued a statement saying the Decree \\"offers major weapons to the employers to utilise against unions [...] It outlaws professional trade unionists, eliminates existing collective agreements, promotes a biased system of non-professional bargaining agents to represent workers, severely restricts industrial action, strengthens sanctions against legally striking workers and bans overtime payments and other allowances for workers in 24-hour operations\\". Attar Singh, General Secretary for the Fiji Islands Council of Trade Unions, said: \\"We have never seen anything worse than this decree. It is without doubt designed to decimate unions [...] by giving [employers] an unfair advantage over workers and unions\\". Amnesty International condemned the Decree as \\"a breathtaking abuse of fundamental rights [which] takes away nearly all collective bargaining rights in essential companies [and] virtually abolishes the right to strike\\".\\"11 companies declared essential by Fiji military regime\\", ABC Radio Australia, 13 September 2011 It added: \\"Fundamental human rights are at stake, including the right to freedom of association and assembly, and the right to organise. Amnesty International stands steadfast in solidarity with workers in Fiji and the Fiji labour movement in their struggle to defend their rights.\\"\\"Warning on Fiji government plan to severely restrict workers' rights\\" , Amnesty International, 8 August 2011 Juan Somavia, Director-General of the International Labour Organization, stated: :\\"By going ahead with this Decree the Government has demonstrated the same lack of concern for the views of the international community as it has for the rights and aspirations of its own people. What is really essential for Fiji is that it change course now. That means reversing this and other restrictive labour decrees, a return to dialogue with trade unions and employers, an end to assaults on and harassment of trade unionists, and the immediate restoration of basic civil liberties.\\"\\"Statement on Fiji, by ILO Director-General Juan Somavia\\", International Labour Organization, 13 September 2011 Mahendra Chaudhry, leader of the Fiji Labour Party, published a statement in July which did not specifically mention the Decree but addressed the government's broader policies in relation to trade unions: :\\"Fiji has ratified [...] ILO Conventions and must act in conformity with them. It cannot promulgate laws that contravene these Conventions or go around physically bashing union leaders. [...] Both the local unions and the international trade union movement have written to the government protesting against its anti- union policies and decrees. There has been no response. How does one take up issues with a government that does not respond to concerns raised with it, does not consult and thinks it can govern through arbitrary decisions, suppression of rights, intimidation and physical violence [...]?\\"\\"On trade unions and their rights\\" , Mahendra Chaudhry, Fiji Labour Party, 23 July 2011 Shaista Shameem, former director of the Fiji Human Rights Commission, who had at first supported the 2006 military coup, stated that \\"many rights have been completely diminished or even removed\\" by the Decree. She added that it showed the Bainimarama government was no longer interested in consensual policy- making.

Omori is the Japanese word for \\"big forest\\". His work is often connected to humanitarian causes and addresses human rights, war, environment, prejudice and philosophical issues. Dean is the founder of The Art of Protest, an organisation set up to encourage protest through art and music. Personal life Born in Great Yarmouth, an eastern English seaside town that saw an influx of Italian immigrants in the 1930s and 1940s, one of whom was Dean's mother. Dean began guitar lessons at the age of 6 but was not a natural. He said he never really could understand the point of playing other peoples music. His undiagnosed dyslexia dogged him throughout his school life but this complicated relationship with language became a fascination that would form the basis of a more coherent means of communication through music and words in the following decades. Divorce, adoption, wealth and poverty shaped his early years until he met his future wife at sixteen and disappeared to a future that would show him music, books and art. By the age of 19 Dean was studying jazz, the romantic poets and had begun to write his own compositions. Dean lives in Norwich with his wife and two children. Early career As agents and record company promises had come and gone Dean remained focused on his songwriting. In later years Dean would argue that he has written more songs than most people have heard. But with the birth of his first child Dean gave up music to look after his children. It was not until part way through the first decade of the new millennium that he would take to his music again, but by this time Dean had found his voice. Music and film In 2006 Dean picked up his guitar again and began to write the songs that would eventually make up his first album TEN WAR SONGS. In the following years he would write, performed and produced ten albums. Dean began making short films to accompany his music. In 2008 the World Wide Fund for nature (WWF) awarded him best film and music for How Can You Sleep. His songs' lyrics have been translated into French, Spanish and Japanese. In 2010 Dean was discovered by Malcolm Holmes of OMD and signed to the label Fin Music. His music and film Censorship Burns The Books Nobody Read was used by Freemuse to help support their cause, highlighting the persecution of artists and musicians around the world. In 2011 Dean was invited to write the music celebrating Amnesty International's 50th year, which was released in May and has toured supporting their cause. In 2016, his album 'Got Daddy Gone' was written for War Child to draw attention to the ongoing war in Syria. In 2013 Dean left his record company to independently release a new album Sean Penn. After the split he has remained an independent artist with full control to write, perform, produce and record all of his material. Deans works often with Sophie Vaughan, cellist and vocalist. Daughter of Ivan Vaughan, was a boyhood friend of John Lennon, and later schoolmate of Paul McCartney. He played bass part-time in Lennon's first band, The Quarrymen, and was responsible for introducing Lennon to Paul McCartney at a community event (the Woolton village f√™te) on 6 July 1957, where The Quarrymen were performing. McCartney impressed Lennon, who invited McCartney to join the band, which he did a day later. This led to the formation of Lennon and McCartney's songwriting partnership, and later of The Beatles. Albums 11th Commandment - 2020 Written and released in lockdown at the time of COVID-19, highlighting the vulnerability of the natural world both viral and ecological. \\"This thing is our revolution, we‚Äôve been divided enough, this thing will bring us all together, this is sleight of hand love\\" The Artist - 2019 13 songs of an artist. The opening track 'Love Letter to a Younger Self' offers a proud and amusing letter to a young person telling them that the future will be positive. The album is lyrically profound and amusing. \\"We‚Äôre not perfect but once we gave the world Mathematics and Love\\" Witness and Testify - 2018 Possibly Deans most personal album. The internal struggle with what he sees and feels and how that is interpreted into music. 'Unthank Road' is an autobiographical account of his life with other songs inspired by the Grenfell Tower fire, and the London and Manchester terror attacks. Music for an Unknown Revolution - 2017 A soundtrack capturing the feeling of revolution when there is none and the power of this. The album was written whilst staying in a Judges house in the South of France. The cover was viewed as pornographic in some world territories but was eventually accepted and released. Got Daddy Gone - 2016 Inspired by the global refugee crisis, the little Syrian boy washed up on a beach and how humanity failed those who had lost everything in a time of war. Got Daddy Gone was supported by and dedicated to War Child. The Heroin View - 2015 This is an album about outsiders, addicts and artists who make art out of their demons. A bold statement on love and music. Holocaust and the Whale - 2014 Inspired by Melville, Holocaust and the Whale puts the persecution of the Jews and the violation of man's greed in the same boat. Sean Penn - 2013 A bold and muscular album which didn't suit his record company. As a result, Dean decided to go it alone and this his 5th Album, is the first release under The Art of Protest label. I Can Save the World - 2012 Playing with a new palette of musical styles, Tango, dance, Gypsy and acoustic hip-hop, here Dean is beginning to push his musical and lyrical boundaries. Words of Freedom - 2011 Words of Freedom, a potent protest album. List of My Demands - 2010 A collection of sleight of hand love songs. 'Sound of the Earth Spinning' has been covered many times and translated into various languages including Spanish, Japanese and French. Squaw - 2009 This is a compilation of Dean's first 2 albums. 'Ten War Songs' which was deleted following the end of the Iraq war and \\"The Last Artist Died Today\\". This was the first time Dean introduced the vocal talents of Sophie Vaughan, who he would work with for many years. A short film made to accompany 'How Can You Sleep' won an award from the World Wide Fund for Nature in 2008.

The Mind of Primitive Man (review). Boston Evening Transcript Following the 1911 publication, the book was revised several times. It is considered an important work in cultural anthropology and in the methodological concept of cultural relativism. Overview Boas examines beliefs that more accomplished civilizations must have higher intelligence and \\"discovered little evidence to support them.\\" He then examines the debate on nature versus nurture and finds that heritability of IQ and ratio of intellectual giftedness of people within a civilization were \\"at best a possible, but not a necessary, element determining the degree of advancement of a race.\\" He states that \\"a direct relation between physical habitus and mental endowment does not exist,\\" giving examples of different human sizes and shapes that do not correlate with intelligence. He also discusses the role of environment and intelligence, especially nutrition, as well as degree of racial admixture and \\"domestication\\" within societies and its effects on the \\"mentality of man.\\" Boas argues that all humans have the same basic characteristics. He writes that phenotypes developed within isolation of a genetic group, and that \\"similar tendencies may exist in the mental life of a man.\\" He argues that intermarriage can spread these physical and mental traits within and among civilizations. Boas notes that the gulf in ability between different \\"primitive\\" and \\"civilized\\" humans is negligible compared to the gulf between humans and animals. He debunks claims that \\"primitive\\" humans have no impulse control, no attention span, no originality of thought, no power of reasoning, and are not capable of sustainability. He compares human types, human language, and human cultures and finds no one language superior to others. He concludes that \\"languages were moulded by thought, not thought by languages.\\" He also examines theories of cultural development which assume every culture must pass through specific levels or stages and states \\"not all stages have been present in all types of cultures.\\" He concludes that race does not correlate with cultural development, which is \\"essentially a phenomenon dependent on historical causes, regardless of race.\\" Boas spends the next section examining epistemology, especially production of knowledge. Rather than being affected by race, Boas asserts that \\"differences in logical conclusions reached by primitive and civilized man [are] owing to the difference in character of knowledge accumulated by preceding generations.\\" Boas says the primary difference between primitive and civilized society is a shift from irrationality to rationality caused by \\"an improvement of the traditional material that enters into our habitual mental operations.\\" Boas concludes the book with an examination of racism in the United States. He expresses his hope that anthropology can lead to more tolerance and sympathy for different civilizations, since \\"all races have contributed in the past to cultural progress in one way or another.\\" References External links *The Mind of Primitive Man via Internet Archive Category:Anthropology books Category:1911 non-fiction books ","title":"The Mind of Primitive Man"},{"id":"33075618","text":"Carol Ann Duffy \\"The Little Red Cap\\" is a poem by Carol Ann Duffy published by Picador as a part of her 1999 collection of poetry titled The World's Wife. The book consists of poems that are based on old stories and tales in which she reshapes in terms of modern day culture. Duffy is known for her trait to take previous stories, tales, etc. and change them into her own \\"What you can do as a poet is take on a story and make it new\\" she once said to Barry Wood in an interview. Duffy's Little Red Cap is great model of her style of poetry in the collection. The World's Wife was created based on stories of heroes that were an inspiration to her.http://news.bbc.co.uk/2/hi/entertainment/8029388.stm Duffy also believed that these tales and stories did not interpret the truth. Duffy's belief in feminist literary criticism is apparent as she believed that in order to find the truth, the female character was to be dominant. Most of Duffy's poetry has feminist interest. She found that the original Little Red Cap fairy tale was an example of feminism in both fairy tales and English literature. She then found a personal connection within the original story line to help form a dominant female character in her writing.http://www.sheerpoetry.co.uk/advanced/interviews/carol-ann-duffy-the- world-s-wife Influence Many factors went into the making of Duffy's Little Red Cap. Little Red Cap is based on the fairy tale story known as Little Red Riding Hood, but was originally titled Little Red Cap by Wilhelm Grimm. Going along with the theme of poetry in The World's Wife, Duffy altered the original storyline to create a dominant female character, but also read as an autobiography of an important period of time in her life. Duffy related herself to the character Little Red Cap's love for her red cap, to her own first love.http://www.pitt.edu/~dash/type0333.html#grimm This piece of poetry is a version of Duffy herself, as it is inspired by her first relationship, and about a young girl becoming a poet. She used her relationship with poet Adrian Henri to create her version of Little Red Cap. The female role in Little Red Cap is obscured behind the Wolf, but these roles are reversed in Duffy's version.http://www.sheerpoetry.co.uk/advanced/interviews/carol-ann- duffy-the-world-s-wife Plot The poem Little Red Cap begins with \\"At childhood's end\\" informing its audience of the characters transition out of childhood. She is narrating the story, as she explains that once the wolf came to the edge of the woods her childhood ended. Little Red Cap examines the wolf, and found herself excited about his large ears, eyes, and teeth! The wolf is portrayed as an older character by the reference of alcohol used in his description\\"his hairy paw, red wine staining his bearded jaw\\". Little Red Cap, only 16 years old, pursues the older wolf. That became the start of her transition to adulthood. Being younger than the wolf, he buys Little Red Cap her first drink. The reason: poetry. Little Red Cap was prepared for what was to come. She knew that the wolf would lead her into the woods. Little Red Cap was prepared to leave home, and go into the woods with the wolf. This was the beginning of the love story and relationship of Little Red Cap and the wolf. She discovered an abundance of books within the Wolf's lair. The two grew close as their relationship blossomed. After 10 years passed from when Little Red Cap wandered into the woods with the Wolf she left the woods without him, ending their relationship. When she met the wolf she was only a child, but after 10 years passed Little Red Cap left the woods as an adult. =Comparison= Duffy's Little Red Cap uses the same story line and characters as does the original Little Red Cap by Grimm, but portrays a completely different message. In the original fairy tale Little Red Cap is a \\"sweet little girl who is given a cap that she falls in love with. The young girl is sheltered by her mother, given specific instructions about her behavior and duties. She does not make the right decision when she decides to talk to the Big Bad Wolf, and tell him where she is going. In this fairy tale Little Red Cap is portrayed as a young foolish child. Duffy's version however, shows Little Red Cap transition out of her childhood. Here Duffy used the original story line, but changes the message. Instead of Little Red Cap being tricked by the wolf, she uses him as guidance. Little Red Cap falls in love with the wolf, and their venture into the woods represents her transition out of childhood. Duffy also embeds a message I took an axe to the wolf a\\"s he slept, one chop, scrotum to throat, and saw the glistening, virgin white of my grandmothers bones\\" this quote clearly defines the point that Little Red Cap took revenge . Personal life The poem Little Red Cap is an interpretation of Duffy. The piece explains her first love, and venture into adulthood. The geography described in the first verse- playing fields, factory, railway line, woods is based on the landscape in her hometown. The relationship between Little Red Cap and the wolf represents Duffy's relationship with poet Adrian Henri. Little Red Cap falls in love with the Wolf at age 16 \\"i made quite sure he spotted me, sweet sixteen\\", the same age Duffy and Henri met at. The poem describes how their 10 year relationship helps Little Red Cap grow into adulthood \\"but then I was young - and it took ten years\\". Duffy and Henri lived together until 1982, for about 10 years. As pronounced in her poem, the two shared a sexual relationship, they were inspirations for their writings.https://www.independent.co.uk/arts- entertainment/books/features/carol-ann-duffy-streetwise-heroines-at- home-743481.html Feminism Duffy felt that the original Little Red Cap was a representation of male dominance over women in all English literature \\"The Wolf's belly, the grandmother inside, are all there waiting to be used. In a sense, in the poem, the grandmother's bones are the silent women who aren't present in English Literature\\". In her version Duffy modified the roles of the characters so that Little Red Cap was seen as the supreme role. Duffy was able to create a feminist edge in her poem by altering the roles of the characters. The Wolf was no longer portrayed as a villain, and rather a valuable and warmhearted character. Little Red Cap (the girl) transformed from a foolish young girl to a more independent, and clever, young adult. Through these changes Little Red Cap became the leader while the Wolf was seen as guidance for her through her journey. Duffy was able to create a dominant Female character, and also create a story line focused on the success of the character, rather than her flaws.https://www.theguardian.com/books/2002/aug/31/featuresreviews.guardianreview8 References Category:1999 poems Category:British poems Category:Literature based on fairy tales Category:Works based on Little Red Riding Hood ","title":"Little Red Cap (poem)"},{"id":"33075628","text":"The TeST TST-3 Alpin T () is a Czech shoulder-wing, T-tailed, single- seat glider and motor glider that was designed and produced by TeST of Brno.Bertrand, Noel; Rene Coulon; et al: World Directory of Leisure Aviation 2003-04, page 59.

Election result The results saw the Conservatives strengthen their majority on the council after winning 39 of the 40 seats on the council. Only 13 of the 27 wards were contested, with Conservatives taking the seats in the other 14 wards without opposition. This meant the Conservatives had been guaranteed a majority even before voting, as 18 of their candidates were unopposed and another 4 were in multi seat wards were there were not enough candidates from other parties. Labour lost all 3 seats they had been defending, 2 in Waterlees in Wisbech and 1 in March East, with the loss in Waterlees being a shock as Labour had been strong in the area for 30 years. Meanwhile, the Liberal Democrats failed to win any seats, but did come within 37 votes in Slade Lode ward in Chatteris.

He was born at the Emory University Hospital in 1946. He was raised in Dekalb County, Georgia and lived above his father's country store. During the 1970s Copeland earned his master's degree in rehabilitation counseling from the University of Georgia. Copeland has held many jobs throughout his life consisting of a probation counselor, a parole officer in Augusta, and also a disability adjudicator for people seeking social security in Atlanta. He then started his own private practice before retiring in 1995 at the age of 49. It wasn't until after his retirement that Copeland began to write. He was a member of the Georgia Writers Association, the National Writers Association, and Libros International. Copeland lived in Lilburn Georgia throughout his adult years. He died 19 October 2010 due to complications from liver failure. Bill Copeland is remembered by his wife, Kathy Copeland, as well as his daughter, Lily Copeland Awards Despite Bill Copeland's short career as a writer, he was able to win many awards for his writings. In 2006 Copeland won the National Writers Association Contest. In 2008 Copeland won the AmazonClicks.com Authors Choice Award for his novel Ashes to the Vistula. Copeland then went on to receive the Taran Family Memorial Award for historical fiction. He was elected a nominee for Georgia Author of the Year in 2008. Geri Taran, the creator of the Taran Family Memorial Award, said that \\"In Ashes to the Vistula the first person approach to the novel was so real that the story could easily be mistaken for a painful memoir. Perhaps it is an affirmation of the human spirit's ability to empathize that the novel was conceived and written by an author with a passion for historical clarity. A successful writing indeed. It is my honor and pleasure to recognize Ashes to the Vistula and Bill Copeland for his outstanding achievement in Historical Fiction.\\" Works Copeland was a man of many passions; however, some of his favorite things to write about were the Holocaust, World War II, Native Americans and many other topics. He was a historian and that aspect reveals itself in many of his works. It was not easy for Copeland to get his works published as he did countless research online, joined different writing groups and talked with fellow writers. He was finally able to find a publisher out of Spain that liked his first novel, Ashes to the Vistula. In 2007, Libros International went on to publish this novel as well as his second one, Desert Peoples Trilogy. =Poetry= Below are a list of Bill Copeland's Poetry: SEEK THE NIGHT Seek the night; find solace in shadows and observe a quieter world free of probing eyes and questioning stares... THE LAST CANDLE I watch the candles burn slowly with their flickering light, giving softness to the gaiety of the evening. One-by- one they flicker their last flame, signaling the end of the night, the bleakness of the season... WINDS OF THOUGHT It's in the wind and can be seen in things bending to please, shaped by force. A tree, gnarled and twisted, points to the wind's goal bowing after this majesty... * Lonely Watch * Clouds * Ride the Roads * Daisy * Run, Daisy, Run * Birds in a Field * Owl Doth Fly * Do You Remember * Helen * The Rose * Gentle Memory * Man as an Island * Dawn * Moving Times * Infinite Thoughts * A Soul Rising * No More Roses * Finding Strength * Lonely Call =Novels= Ashes to the Vistula (2007) is perhaps Copeland's most well known novel. It was his first novel published and won multiple awards. It is a story about two boys that are taken to Auschwitz and forced to overcome hardships together despite the hardships that they already face. \\"Desert People's Trilogy\\" was Copeland's second novel to be published and it won him the National Writer's Association Novel Contest. This is a unique trilogy that represents the white man's takeover of the Native American tribes. Hindu Moon is Copeland's third novel and it depicts a story of both romance, mystery, and tragedy. =Holocaust poetry= As a historian it is obvious that Bill Copeland took great interest in the horror that was the Holocaust. This is evident through his use of descriptive language and vivid imagery that he uses in holocaust poems. A Dark Pall A dark pall hangs over the earth time sanity vanished replaced with ruthlessness unimaginable evil. Tyrants rose from the muck cloaked in black, adorning death heads stone faces masking evil hiding sinister intentions. Ruses perpetuated disarming many innocents shading villainous intentions a final solution... The Ruse Down from the train the ruse begins words of cheer amid the guards facing guns fearing dogs. To the showers the ruse portrays no diseases here crowding together walking slowly on the ashes of kin... Other famous holocaust poets are Mahmoud Darwish and Martin Niemoller. Interviews Copeland uses vivid details in all of his poems, especially the holocaust ones, and part of the reason for this is his extensive research that he put into whatever he was talking about. With regards to his holocaust poetry Copeland not only did plenty of research on the Holocaust and WWII, but he also was able to get a primary source perspective from actual soldiers that fought in the war. He interviewed both a US Army and a US Navy veteran and took what he learned and turned it into poetry. Copeland's first interview was with Private First Class Russell Scott, a member of the 802nd Field Artillery Battalion. It becomes obvious where Copeland got his gruesome dialect for his poems as during part of the interview PFC Russell Scott states that: \\"What did I think when I saw them? I vomited. [He holds his hands together to form a circle about three inches in diameter.] Their legs weren't any bigger than this. I didn't know people could live like that. It's sickening to this day. The worst was Nordhausen, near Halle, Germany. It was a death camp, with the bodies stacked like cord wood. That was sickening, and the local people said they didn't know it was happening, but they knew. They couldn't have not known. They knew.\\" -Private First Class Russell Scott PFC Scott goes on to talk about the rest of the war and how seeing these horrible things prevented him from staying in the army. In Copeland's second interview with Petty Officer Bill York of the US Navy, it becomes clear where a lot of the emotional aspects to the poetry comes from. Throughout the interview Officer York comes off as a tough character who doesn't seem to show emotion until he brings up his brother. \\"At that time, he learned his only brother had been wounded in Normandy on D-Day, but had been taken to Paris for recuperation. \\"Then I learned he had been killed at Bastogne in the Battle of the Bulge. Johnny's death was the greatest personal loss in my life, and still is today.\\"-Petty Officer Bill York For the rest of the interview Officer York shows just how emotional war can make even the toughest people seem. Bill Copeland's third interview was with Corporal Theodore Suroweic, a member of the 747th Tank Battalion. In this interview Suroweic goes into great detail about how much preparation it took to get to the point where they were ready for battle. Suroweic talks about the rough trip over and how he had no idea what lay ahead of him. The interview takes a huge turn when he starts going into detail about landing on the beach and all of the death that was around him. It seemed everything was on fire; tanks, trucks, everything‚Ä¶. I remember seeing the bodies of soldiers, all lined up with their boots sticking straight up; a lot of bodies; our guys. They were lying all over the beach, and some were still floating in the water.\\"-Corporal Theodore Suroweic Not only does this interview depict the agony of having to watch ones fellow soldiers being slaughtered, but also how it feels to be personally brutalized. The fire had burned my clothes and I was lying there mostly naked with burns all over my body. There was no bleeding or pain, which had to be a blessing at the time, but my left leg was shattered. I knew I was in trouble when I looked at it. I remember thinking, \\"What a mess it was in\\". -Corporal Theodore Suroweic This interview provides another rare first person perspective into what it was like to live through this war as a soldier. Copeland incorporates much of this into his holocaust poetry. Critiques Author Sandra J. Cropsey on Ashes to the Vistula \\"Mr. Copeland could have bombarded his readers with one atrocity after another,\\" she wrote, \\"but instead he carefully controls the story while at the same time giving his readers a glimpse into the misery and inhumanity of the Holocaust enough to remind us that we should never forget history, lest we surely repeat it.\\" Author Philip Spires on Ashes to the Vistula: \\"This is one of the strengths of Bill Copeland's book. It has an immediacy, a present that it is uncomplicated by received hindsight. On many issues, Bill Copeland leaves the jury out, enabling the reader to empathise with the dilemmas that confronted wartime and immediate post-war experience. This is the book's subtlety. Though it is primarily plot-led, the plot is genuinely surprising, ultimately engaging and, in a few late chapters, both confronts and rounds off several themes that the reader has registered throughout the narrative.\\" References External links * http://www.billcopeland.net * http://blogcritics.org/books/article/book-review-ashes-to-the-vistula/ Category:1946 births Category:2010 deaths Category:Novelists from Georgia (U.S. state) Category:21st-century American novelists Category:Deaths from liver disease Category:People from DeKalb County, Georgia Category:People from Lilburn, Georgia Category:21st-century American poets Category:American male novelists Category:American male poets Category:20th-century American poets Category:20th-century American novelists Category:20th-century American male writers Category:21st-century American male writers ","title":"Bill Copeland (poet)"},{"id":"33075681","text":"Joshua Poteat is an American poet Background Joshua Poteat got his Bachelor of Arts in English from the University of North Carolina Wilmington in 1993. received his Master of Fine Arts in writing at Virginia Commonwealth University in May 1997.

It is said that Matheus de Castro was kidnapped and sent to the Franciscan seminary at Reis-Magos, Bardez to be taught the new religion. During the Christianisation of Goa in the early phase of the Goa Inquisition, the Portuguese authorities used many ploys to convert the natives to Christianity. One of which was to kidnap boys from upper caste Hindu families prior to their attaining puberty and enroll them in seminaries. Besides the families being influential, male children from the upper castes of Hindu society were by and large literate. Hence the task of indoctrination was much easier. These young converts would be influential in convincing their relatives and people of their community to embrace the new faith. But in keeping with the padroado policy at the time, of not admitting Indians into their ranks, Matheus de Castro's request for ordination to the priesthood was not entertained. In 1625 Matheus de Castro ventured to Rome in the company of some Carmelite priests he had befriended and was introduced to Francesco Ingoli the dynamic secretary of the newly established Propaganda Fide, who on interviewing this Indian convert recommended his admission to the Collegio Urbano in Rome to study for the priesthood. After being ordained a priest in 1630, he pursued studies for a doctorate in theology, impressing his superiors with his abilities. He was appointed Protonotary Apostolic in 1633 and Bishop in 1635.Dictionary of Christian Missions edited by Gerald H Anderson Bishop de Castro was held in great esteem at the courts of the Moghul Emperor Shah Jahan and other rulers of India, including those of Golconda ruled by the Qutb Shahi dynasty and the Kingdom of Bijapur which belonged to the Adil Shahi dynasty, which ruled Goa prior to the Portuguese.Storia de Mogor by Niccolao Munucci They permitted him to erect dwelling houses and residences in their dominions for the accommodation and convenience of converts. He helped establish commercial relations between the Catholics of Goa and the peoples of those Kingdoms. He founded the Apostolic Mission of Bombay which evolved from a village in the 17th century to India's premier Metropolis. The Bishop spent the last years of his life in Rome. Dom Thomas de Castro the Bishop of Fulsivelem was his nephew. Both uncle and nephew were at constant loggerheads with the Padroado. They were vehemently against the Goa Inquisition.

P2 employs nearly 700 people and was a privately held portfolio company of Vista Equity Partners. On October 7, 2013 P2 Energy Solutions was acquired by a Boston-based private equity firm: Advent International.Advent International acquires P2 Energy Solutions History P2 Energy Solutions was founded in 1999 as Energy Auction Exchange with an ambitious plan to use the Internet to bring efficiencies to many aspects of the upstream petroleum industry. The Company raised its seed capital in 1999, using the proceeds to acquire the Oil & Gas Asset Clearinghouse of Houston. The Clearinghouse operated an open outcry auction of fractional interests in oil & gas properties. Shortly after this acquisition, EAE re-branded itself as Petroleum Place with the goal of becoming the vertical industry Internet portal for the upstream petroleum industry. In 2000, Petroleum Place raised approximately $100 million in two rounds of financing from venture capital groups and petroleum industry \\"strategic\\" investors. It filed an S-1 to register its shares for public offering in May 2000, but these plans were shelved because of the rapidly eroding interest in Internet IPO's. Petroleum Place then went on a series of acquisitions beginning with Paradigm Technologies, developer of an accounting and Enterprise Resource Planning (ERP) product known as Excalibur, which served many mid-sized to large independent upstream petroleum companies. That transaction was followed in 2002 with the acquisition of Novistar, another upstream accounting software package which had previously been Oracle Energy. Petroleum Place created P2 Energy Solutions from its Paradigm business and merged it with Novistar.

Monsangs have their own distinct culture and tradition and are peace-loving people.  History  Monsang tribe is one among the indigenous tribes of the North-East India, inhabiting the south-east part of Manipur state border to Myanmar particularly in Chandel district. Monsangs have their own distinct culture and tradition and are peace-loving people. Monsangs were originally known as 'Sirti'. Sirti is derived from the word 'Ati' meaning 'south'. Therefore, it is believed that Monsangs originated from the south though the exact geographical region of origin cannot be determined. Tradition has it that Monsangs emerged from a cave which was guarded by a ferocious tiger. After empowering the tiger with the help of weaver birds and hornbills, Thumpungpa, the Monsang leader led the people out of the cave in search for suitable place for settlement. The earliest Monsang village is Tungphejur. Tetejur, Kolenbung, Heikaching, Ruwngphetung come in successive sequence in the course of migration. During the time of their settlement in Ruwngphetung, Monsangs came in contact with the Meiteis (valley people of Manipur). Among the Monsangs was a popular leader named Mosang. Subsequently, Ruwngphetung was referred to as 'Mosang's village' by people from other communities. In due course of time, the people of Ruwngphetung were known as the Mosang people, and 'Sirti' came to be known as 'Monsang' after Mosang.  Clans  Generally in Monsang Tribe there are two clans namely (a) Simputi and (b) Rinheti. Each clan is again divided into several sub-clans. (a) SIMPUTI CLAN:- 1. Ngiiriiti 2.Kiiriiti 3. Thrumhliti, 4. Hranglumti, 5. Chahliiti, 6. Eenlha Bungjirti and 7. Serbumti. (b) RINNHETI CLAN:- 1. Rohinti, 2. Wanglarti 3. Thresongti, 4. Hongamti 5. Shongsirti 6. Khartuti 7. Khartu Bungpi.  Marriage  In ancient days, negotiation between the boy's family and that of the girl preceded the formal marriage. This was known as juwr Ikhuw. However it is no longer in practice today. Jutii (engagement); for the engagement ceremony the boy's parents goes to the girl's house along with a jar of wine and a hen. If no agreement arises then the girl's parents arrange a jar of wine which is consumed by both the parties then the engagement will be cancelled. Today, in Christianity, tea has replaced wine in all such occasions. After the Jutii the boy goes to the girl's house and starts living with her at her house in union. He lives there for three consecutive years only after which the girl would go to live in the boy's house. During the boy's stay at the girl's house‚Äô his parents will have to make three presentations to the girl's family known as Chatla, Thungpham and Mharsha or Min. Chatla consists of meat and wine. Thungpham includes a pig and a jar of wine. Mharsha or Min includes a metal gong, one pig or one hen and a cow and a basket-full of Chahao. Today, the marriages are almost replaced by the Christian ceremonies ministered by a catholic priest or a Reverend. Many of the old traditions have been replaced to a considerable degree. LHU- A unique friendship system among the Monsangs. \\"LHU\\" stands for bosom friend. Every Monsang male has a bosom friend, Lhu. Friends of this nature are distinguished from those of one's ordinary friends. In this type of friendship, there is no question of marriage between the brothers and sisters and between the children should they arise. This friendship is bound by the conviction that whatever the circumstances that may befall should be faced boldly and jointly. When any animal is killed by any of them the rear portion of the animal is given to the other. Such a trend is still practiced today in the Monsang culture. Inter- marriage Marriage between the Sub-Clans of Rinheti and Simputi can marry within its sub-clans i.g. marriage between Ngiiriiti and Kiiriiti, Kiiriiti and Thrumhliti so on. The sub-clans of Rinheti may also marry within sub-clans of e.g. Wanglarti and Thresongti, Hongamti and Shongsirti, so on. But in the Simputi clan marriage within the sub-clan of Ngiiriiti and Hranglumti and in Rinheti clan marriage within Rohinti and Wanglarti, Hongamti and Thresongti and between Khartuti and Khartu Bingpi are prohibited. They are treated as close blood relation known as juwr. If these happen to be any marriage between the above said clans then village authority will impose fine as per the Monsang customary law.  Religion   Chiefs  Chiefs are not hereditary, they are elected by the people. The tenure of Chiefship is not fixed period. He holds the post as long as he enjoys confidence of his villagers. The Chiefs can be removed when his villagers do not have confidence on him or when he is too old.

If the land owner is too old and his family members are not interested in jhum cultivation then the land can be given to his nearest relatives or can be sold to other sub-clans.

Although there is a designated source, called Aubrunnen about one kilometer northeast of the center of Pfersdorf this pours average only one to two liters per second and dries up completely in the summer. The Wern initially flows in a southerly direction, approaching the Main at Schweinfurt, but turning west 2 km away and flowing through the northern part of the Maindreieck .

As the only academic medical center in the region, the University of Miami offers a unique and comprehensive approach to these conditions, with interdisciplinary discussion between neurosurgery, neurology, radiation oncology, and medical oncology. Management paradigms are case specific and tailored to the individual needs of each patient, with state-of- the-art treatment protocols, clinical trials, vaccine development, surgical techniques, adjuvant therapies, and laboratory research aimed at improving outcomes ‚Äî even on the most challenging types of tumors. University of Miami neurosurgeons also have expertise in CyberKnife¬Æ radiosurgery and work with radiation oncologists to optimize radiation therapy. Being a tertiary referral center for south Florida, the Caribbean, Central America, and the rest of Latin America, the University of Miami treats a large number of patients affected by all types of brain tumors. The division of surgical neurooncology has published hundreds of research articles in peer-reviewed journals and book chapters over the years. Founded over 50 years ago by Dr. David Reynolds MD, the department of neurosurgery at UM has grown to include many centers including the Miami Project to Cure Paralysis, which has been cited as the \\"world‚Äôs largest, most comprehensive research center dedicated to...spinal cord injury.\\" Located in Miami, Florida, the University of Miami Medical Center includes Jackson Memorial Hospital and the University of Miami Hospital, which collectively form the third largest medical center in the nation. The past chair of the department was Dr. Barth A. Green, founder of Project Medishare for Haiti, and co-chairman Dr. Roberto C. Heros. The current chair is Dr. Alan Levi.  List of doctors  *Roberto C. Heros MD *Ronald Benveniste MD PhD *Michael E. Ivan MD MBS *Jonathan Jagid MD *Ricardo J. Komotar MD *Howard Landy MD *Jacques Morcos MD  Heat shock protein vaccine trial New clinical trial is being explored at select and distinguished medical centers including Johns Hopkins Hospital, Columbia University Medical Center, University of California San Francisco, University of Miami and a few others. This treatment is tailored to newly diagnosed patients with glioblastoma multiforme, and aims to activate the patient's immune system against the tumor antigen to prevent recurrence using HSPPC-96. Preliminary data suggests that this novel agent has promising results against cancer. UM is the only center conducting this trial in the state of Florida. Types of Tumors Treated =Gliomas= Types *Glioblastoma (grade IV glioma) *Anaplastic astrocytoma (grade III glioma) *Low-grade astrocytoma (grade II glioma) *Pilocytic astrocytoma (grade I glioma) *Oligodendroglioma *Ependymoma *Mixed Glioma =Treatments= Glioma treatment depends on the clinical and pathological presentation of the tumor. Treatment involves a combined approach that may utilize surgery, radiation and chemotherapy. =Metastatic Tumors= Any type of cancer which has arisen from another part of the body that has spread to the brain are referred to as cerebral metastases =Meningiomas= Meningiomas are the second most common primary tumor of the central nervous system although they are usually benign. Treatments for Meningioma may include preoperative embolization and radiation therapy. =Acoustic Neuromas= Also known as a vestibular schwannoma, Acoustic Neuroma can be managed conservatively or surgically. Treatments Treatment may be conservative depending on the clinical presentation and the physician decision. Conservative treatment involves monitoring the tumor annually to assess growth. This practice is usually common in elderly patients. Surgery may also be an option for patients. Special Consideration is taken to ensure preservation of patient's hearing and facial function. UM specialists tend to collaborate with the school's neurootology team to ensure good outcomes. Surgery may also be coupled with radiotherapy. Currently, minimally invasive endoscopic surgery for these tumors is an option at specialized medical centers such as UM. Radiation therapy can include cyberknife radiosurgery or fractionated stereotactic radiotherapy, or proton therapy. After radiation treatments for vestibular schwannomas, patients must receive MRIs annually due to the possibility of recurrence of secondary tumors. =Pituitary Tumors= Pituitary adenomas are tumors that occur in the pituitary gland. Treatments Pituitary tumors can be treated with medicine to decrease the tumor size and symptomatology. Treatment for larger tumors can be accomplished with radiation therapy or surgery. Surgery is usually performed transsphenoidally and also may involve Cyberknife surgery. =Skull Base Tumors= Types *Nasal carcinomas *Chordomas *Chondosarcomas *Glomus =Treatments= Skull base tumors can be treated in a variety of ways including surgery, radiation therapy, chemotherapy or even a combination of these treatments. Patients are given the option for open surgery or minimally invasive procedures. Open Surgery Depending on the tumor type and location, open surgery may be preferred for certain patients. The bone is removed and the tumor is able to be resected widely. Usually after the tumor is removed, the neurosurgeons seek the multidisciplinary help of plastic surgeons to help reconstruct the soft tissues to provide little or no facial deformities. Minimally Invasive Surgery This surgery utilizes image guiding, endoscopy, or real-time MRI to determine tumor location and facilitate resection. Endoscopy uses a flexible camera tube through small openings in the skull to view tumors in the skull base. Alternatively, image guided surgery uses preoperative MRIs or CTs to give the surgeons navigation to enhance the precision of resection. Even more advanced, some surgeons at UM are able to use real-time MRI to determine the extent of resection of the tumor intraoperatively, which naturally reduces the need for extra operations.  Awake Craniotomy =Procedure= Intraoperatively, University of Miami neurosurgeons and neurologists use certain techniques to reduce and prevent damage to essential areas of the brain used for language, muscle skills, and sensation. In order to avoid damage to these areas, neurosurgeons must determine the location of these functional areas that are mapped while the patient is awake. Using special mapping procedures while the patient is awake during the operation, certain areas of the brain are stimulated with a mild electric current to determine the functionality of various areas. If certain areas are critical for the patient's function, that area of the brain is preserved, meanwhile the tumor in the non-functional areas will be targeted and removed. =Technique= # The operation is begun with the patient asleep to ensure patient comfort. # The sedation is lifted slowly during the critical part of the surgery. # The patient is asked to talk, move and follow commands from the neurology team during the operation. # If stimulation hinders any of the tasks, then care is taken to avoid this area. # Once the tumor is removed, the physicians anesthetize the patient to allow the neurosurgeon to finish the operation. =Advantages/Research Studies= Awake Craniotomies can be used to treat tumors and focal epileptic areas in the brain. Research studies have shown that awake craniotomy may increase the feasibility of removing the entire tumor, reduces morbidity, and increases survival.

It is generally a pediatric condition. Presentation Labial fusion is rarely present at birth, but rather acquired later in infancy, since it is caused by insufficient estrogen exposure and newborns have been exposed to maternal estrogen in utero. It typically presents in infants at least 3 months old. Most presentations are asymptomatic and are discovered by a parent or during routine medical examination. In other cases, patients may present with associated symptoms of dysuria, urinary frequency, refusal to urinate, or post-void dribbling. Some patients present with vaginal discharge due to pooling of urine in the vulval vestibule or vagina. =Complications= Labial fusion can lead to urinary tract infection, vulvar vestibulitis and inflammation caused by chronic urine exposure. In severe cases, labial adhesions can cause complete obstruction of the urethra, leading to anuria and urinary retention. Pathophysiology The primary contributing factor to labial fusion is low estrogen levels. A vulva with low estrogen exposure, such as that of a preadolescent, has delicate epithelial lining and is therefore vulnerable to irritation. Conditions causing irritation, such as infection, inflammation and trauma, cause the edges of the labia minora to fuse together. The fusion typically begins at the posterior frenulum of the labia minora and continues anteriorly. Most labial adhesions resolve spontaneously before puberty as estrogen levels increase and the vaginal epithelium becomes cornified. Diagnosis The condition can be diagnosed based on inspection of the vulva. In patients with labial fusion, a flat plane of tissue with a dense central line of tissue is usually seen when the labia majora are retracted, while an anterior opening is usually present below the clitoris. Treatment Treatment is not usually necessary in asymptomatic cases, since most fusions will separate naturally over time, but may be required when symptoms are present. The standard method of treatment for labial fusion is the application of topical estrogen cream onto the areas of adhesion, which is effective in 90% of patients. In severe cases where the labia minora are entirely fused, causing urinary outflow obstruction or vaginal obstruction, the labia should be separated surgically. Recurrence after treatment is common but is thought to be prevented by good hygiene practices. One study has shown that betamethasone may be more effective than estrogen cream in preventing recurrence, with fewer side effects. Epidemiology Labial fusion is not uncommon in infants and young girls. It is most common in infants between the ages of 13 and 23 months, and has an incidence of 3.3% in this age group. It is estimated that labial fusion occurs in 1.8% of all prepubertal girls. It is rare in adult women, particularly in reproductive age, but is occasionally found in postpartum and postmenopausal women.

This bacterium is often found as a commensal in the respiratory tract of pigs, and rarely in the skin of humans. It is thought to facilitate and exacerbate the development of diseases such as porcine enzootic pneumonia and porcine reproductive and respiratory syndrome (PRRS). Rarely, it may cause mycoplasma arthritis, mycoplasmal polyserositis or mycoplasma septicaemia in piglets without the involvement of other bacteria. This presents as polyarthritis or polyserositis. Clinical signs and diagnosis A variety of clinical signs are seen in piglets less than 10-weeks old. Lameness, polyserositis and joint swelling are the most common symptoms. A foul-smelling discharge from the ears can occur secondary to otitis. Less specific signs include poor coat quality, pyrexia, cardiovascular, gastrointestinal, neurological and respiratory signs. Bacterial culture, immunofluorescent antibody testing (IFAT), complement fixation test and haemagglutination can all be used to confirm the diagnosis. Human pathogenicity There is some evidence implicating Mycoplasma hyorhinis in the pathogenesis of Scleroderma, a chronic systemic disease of humans. One study found it has been isolated from Scleroderma patients.https://patentscope.wipo.int/search/en/detail.jsf?docId=WO2003077870 Another study found that injecting Mycoplasma hyorhinis into mice induces a scleroderma-like autoimmune disease.

Still used in the operating room, in previous nomenclature CMV referred to \\"controlled mechanical ventilation\\" (\\"control mode ventilation\\"), a mode of ventilation characterized by a ventilator that makes no effort to sense patient breathing effort. In continuous mandatory ventilation, the ventilator can be triggered either by the patient or mechanically by the ventilator. The ventilator is set to deliver a breath according to parameters selected by the operator. \\"Controlled mechanical ventilation\\" is an outdated expansion for \\"CMV\\"; \\"continuous mandatory ventilation\\" is now accepted standard nomenclature of mechanical ventilation. CMV today can assist or control dynamically, depending on transient presence or absence of spontaneous breathing effort. Thus, today's CMV would have been called ACV (assist-control ventilation) in older nomenclature, and the original form of CMV is a thing of the past. But despite continual technological improvement over the past half century, CMV sometimes may still be uncomfortable for the patient.  Expected outcomes and considerations  Continuous mandatory ventilation is associated with profound diaphragm muscle dysfunction and atrophy. CMV is no longer the preferred mode of mechanical ventilation.  Volume-controlled CMV  = Limit = Limits in VC-CMV may be set and pressure based. The ventilator will attempt to deliver the set tidal volume utilizing whatever pressure is required to reach its setting. A pressure limit may be added to limit damage to the lungs (barotrauma). = Cycle = Expiration cycling can be set by time or the pressure limit. Once the Ti (inspiratory time) is reached, or a pressure limit is reached the ventilator will cycle into expiratory mode and allow passive exhalation until another breath is triggered.  Pressure-controlled CMV  Pressure control (PC) is a pressure-controlled mode of ventilation. The ventilator delivers a flow to maintain the preset pressure at a preset respiratory rate over a preset inspiratory time.MAQUET, \\"Modes of ventilation in SERVO-i, Invasive and Non-invasive, 2008 MAQUET Critical Care AB, Order No 66 14 692 The pressure is constant during the inspiratory time and the flow is decelerating.

They work on a breath-by-breath basis and provide pressure-limited time-cycled breaths, increasing or decreasing the pressure of the next breath as necessary to achieve a user-selected desired tidal volume. They are known by various vendor-specific terms such as pressure-regulated volume control (Siemens), autoflow (Dr√§ger), adaptive-pressure ventilation (Hamilton Medical), volume-control plus (Covidien), among others.

There is a standardized nomenclature of mechanical ventilation that is specific about nomenclature related to modes, but not settings and variables. Terms are now split into acronyms of CONTROL VARIABLE + BREATH SEQUENCE + TARGETING SCHEME. As in PC- CMV, Pressure Controlled Continuous Mandatory Ventilation. The term trigger (commonly flow or pressure) denotes the criteria that starts inspiration and cycle denotes the criteria that stops it. The target variable should not be confused with the cycle variable or the control variable. The target variable only sets an upper limit for pressure, volume or flow. Control variable The physical parameter that controls the breath in accordance with the equation of motion =Equation of motion= Pressure = Elastance*Volume + Resistance*Flow =Volume control (VC)= Volume controlled ventilation is ventilation where both volume and flow are controlled by the ventilator. Normally, flow is set to a fixed amount, meaning volume increases linearly over time. Any mode that relies on flow to control inspiration falls under the VC- category. =Pressure control (PC)= Pressure controlled ventilation is where pressure as a function of time is controlled by the ventilator. Normally, pressure is set to a specific amount for a specific breath duration, letting volume and flow vary according to patient demands. Any mode that relies on pressure to deliver a breath falls under the PC- category. =Time control (TC)= Rarely breaths can be purely time controlled. An example is intrapulmonary percussive ventilation. Here only time is set by the operator and pressure and flow change obeying the equation of motion. Breath Sequence =Continuous mandatory ventilation (CMV)= Commonly known as ‚ÄúAssist/Control‚Äù; CMV is a breath sequence for which spontaneous breaths are not possible between mandatory breaths because every patient trigger signal in the trigger window produces a machine cycled inspiration (i.e., a mandatory breath). Machine triggered mandatory breaths may be delivered at a preset rate. Therefore, in contrast to IMV, the mandatory breath frequency may be higher than the set frequency but never below it. In some pressure controlled modes on ventilators with an active exhalation valve, spontaneous breaths may occur during mandatory breaths, but the defining characteristic of CMV is that spontaneous breaths are not permitted between mandatory breaths. ;Terms replaced by VC-CMV * Assist/Control * A/C * ACV * CMV * Volume Assist/Control * Volume Control * Volume Limited Ventilation * Volume Controlled Ventilation * Controlled Ventilation * Volume Targeted Ventilation ;Terms replaced by PC- CMV * Assist/Control * A/C * ACV * CMV * Pressure Assist/Control * Pressure Control * Pressure Limited Ventilation * Pressure Controlled Ventilation * Pressure Targeted Ventilation =Intermittent mandatory ventilation (IMV)= IMV is a form of ventilation where the ventilator delivers mandatory breaths, but spontaneous breaths are possible between mandatory breaths.

His work also appeared in Rolling Stone, Penthouse, and Playboy. Gallucci Studio, Inc. After exhibiting his work at Grey Advertising in the late 1970s, Gallucci was encouraged to make the switch from editorial to commercial studio photography. Gallucci Studio Inc. was established in Manhattan and occupied four different addresses between 1978 and 1998. Under these auspices Gallucci shot hundreds of magazine spreads and covers for: Newsweek, Business Week, Fortune, U.S. News & World Report, Discover, Longevity, New York Magazine, PC Magazine, Psychology Today, Science, Video Review, Weight Watchers, and Family Health magazines. Thousands of Gallucci‚Äôs photographs have appeared on print ads, billboards, book covers, annual reports, catalogs, and brochures.

He worked as a clerk/salesman for an ironworks company until 1934, and then studied speech and drama at the Regent Street Polytechnic and the London Speech Institute under Margaret Gullan. He went on to study phonetics under Daniel Jones at University College London, and joined the London Verse-Speaking Choir. He lectured in speech training at Borough Road Training College, Isleworth, and the Speech Fellowship in 1937‚Äì1939, and edited the Speech Fellowship Bulletin (1934‚Äì1949). He was also an instructor at the Drama School of the London Academy of Music and Dramatic Art. Sansom married the poet Ruth Large, a Tasmanian, in 1937, at the Quaker Friends Meeting House in Winchmore Hill. He subsequently joined the Quakers and was a conscientious objector during the Second World War. His best known collection of poems, The Witnesses, tells the life of Jesus of Nazareth from the perspective of those who knew him during his time on earth. It was joint winner of the Festival of Britain poetry prize in 1950 and has been performed all over the world.

Tyler is the son of Eddie Moon (David Essex), half brother of Michael (Steve John Shepherd) and Craig Moon (Elliot Rosen), brother of Anthony Moon (Matt Lapinskas) and cousin of Alfie Moon (Shane Richie). He made his first appearance in the episode broadcast on 27 June 2011. Tyler, along with brother Anthony, were both announced as new characters in May 2011, being played by Discipline and Lapinskas respectively, though Tyler made his debut at an earlier date. Described as having a short fuse and \\"quick to use his fist to sort things out\\", Tyler begins boxing and when half brother Michael pushes him to do an unlicensed fight, Tyler agrees, unbeknown to Tyler that Michael is fixing the fight, putting a boxer in the ring who once killed a man. Tyler wins the fight, though suffers a fit and undergoes life saving operations. Other than this, he is described as a \\"heart-throb\\" and \\"ladykiller\\". When Tyler first arrives, he chats up a number of girls and even kisses Roxy Mitchell (Rita Simons). Tyler later starts dating Whitney Dean (Shona McGarty), though their relationship suffers badly due to Whitney's past. A love triangle begins to develop between Tyler, Whitney and Fatboy (Ricky Norwood). When Whitney chooses Fatboy, Tyler has a one-night stand with Lauren Branning (Jacqueline Jossa), though later regrets it after finding out that Whitney still has feelings for him. It was announced on 9 June 2013 that Discipline would be leaving the show. Tyler's final episode was broadcast on 6 August 2013. Storylines Tyler arrives in Walford with his father Eddie Moon (David Essex) and his brother Anthony Moon (Matt Lapinskas), and works in his father antiques emporium. He takes up boxing, and floors his first opponent, but does not know that his other brother Michael Moon (Steve John Shepherd) paid him to let Tyler win. Tyler later dates Poppy Meadow (Rachel Bright), though she is just trying to make her boyfriend jealous. Michael manipulates Tyler into taking part in an unlicensed boxing match, and sets him up with a boxer called Artie Stiller (Maurice Lee), who is known to fight dirty. Tyler wins the fight, after taking quite a few beatings, but shortly after he collapses having a seizure in the ring. He later recovers in hospital, and when he finds out that Michael was trying to kill him, Tyler grows violent toward Michael and intimidates him for a while. Tyler starts a relationship with Whitney Dean (Shona McGarty), but she leaves him after a few days. Tyler has a one-night stand with Whitney's best friend Lauren Branning (Jacqueline Jossa). Weeks later they kiss again and the pair begin a casual relationship, though Whitney is jealous. Whitney's boyfriend Fatboy (Ricky Norwood) notices that Tyler has lingering feelings for Whitney and warns him off. His casual relationship with Lauren continues until her grandmother Cora Cross (Ann Mitchell) tells him she needs stability, so he tells Lauren they should be friends without sex. Derek Branning (Jamie Foreman) asks Tyler and Anthony for ¬£4000 they owe him for selling some goods for him, but they only have ¬£3000. They agree to steal copper wire from train tracks for Derek, but Michael finds out and calls the police, leading to Derek's arrest. He is released without charge and accuses Anthony and Tyler of calling the police, increasing their debt to ¬£8000. They realise Michael called the police and confront him and his fianc√©e Janine Butcher (Charlie Brooks) discovers what is going on. She pays off the debt, but Michael takes a beating from Derek. Tyler tells Whitney he loves her and wants to be with her, she walks away, but later they kiss, causing her to refuse to go on holiday with Fatboy. Whitney then admits she likes Tyler but finds him kissing Lucy Beale (Hetti Bywater). She then tells him to leave her alone. However, Tyler makes a grand gesture with Valentine's balloons and tells her that he cannot as he loves her. Whitney admits she feels the same way and the two become a couple. Whitney believes she is pregnant and when she tells Tyler, he seems reluctant to take on a child. He comes round to the idea, but Whitney discovers she is not pregnant after all. Tyler then moves in with Whitney, but they share a house with Derek and he vows to watch Tyler closely. Tyler visits Eddie and is angry on his return to discover Anthony has left and Derek has taken control of the business. Tyler then works on the market selling Derek's stock. Whitney and Tyler end up sharing the house with several of Whitney's family, so consider getting their own home. Whitney feels guilty over a previous kiss with Joey Branning (David Witts) so tells Tyler. He fights with Joey and breaks up with Whitney. He regrets the breakup, and to prove he loves her, he proposes and she accepts. Tyler is insensitive to Whitney when she learns of the death of Tony King (Chris Coghill), an older man who groomed her into a sexual relationship with him from when she was just 12. Whitney leaves, later meeting Joey and they have sex. She tells Tyler, and they both realisze that they are better off apart. With Michael's help, Tyler cons Danny Pennant (Gary Lucy) into giving him his sports car, and leaves Walford on 6 August 2013 to work on a cruise ship with brother Anthony. Creation and development =Casting= The character was announced on 10 May 2011, along with Anthony, and made his first appearance on 27 June 2011. Discipline heard about the part in November 2010 from his agent, so decided to audition and returned two weeks later for a workshop. At the workshop, there were six actors shortlisted to play Tyler and six shortlisted to play Anthony. The actors were paired off and Discipline was paired with Lapinskas. A month later, Discipline attended a screen test, and after a further screen test, he found out he had got the part. Discipline said of his casting: \\"It's really exciting to be able to work on a show that you have grown up watching and have followed your whole life. I am very grateful to be given this opportunity and am looking forward to working on the show and becoming an East-Ender!\\" Executive producer Bryan Kirkwood said, \\"Both Tony and Matt are fabulous additions to the show. Headed up by David Essex, the Moon clan are on their way to becoming an established family in the Square.\\" =Personality= Introduced as the younger half brother of Michael, Tyler was described as having a short fuse and \\"quick to use his fist to sort things out\\", and the two new brothers are said to be \\"a couple of likely lads who are more than likely to cause a stir in Albert Square.\\" Discipline described Tyler as \\"very sparky and very charismatic! He can be quick to snap at certain people sometimes if they get on the wrong side of him, but he's a lovely guy. He's also very flirty when it comes to the women! He's a bit of a chap to say the least! It's not because he's seedy or he's horrible or anything like that‚Äîhe genuinely enjoys chatting to women and chasing them. Even if they turned him down, it's all part of the chase and that's fun for Tyler. You can expect a lot of flirting, a lot of girls and maybe some arguments. We shall see!\\" Daniel Kilkelly from Digital Spy added that the character has much energy. Additionally, Tyler was called a \\"bloke's bloke\\" who loves to have fun with his friends, but often ends up in trouble, especially because of women. A source told Inside Soap that Tyler would quickly get to know some of the \\"gorgeous girls\\" of Walford, and the two brothers would be \\"heart-throbs\\" and \\"ladykillers\\". Discipline stated that Whitney is the perfect girl for Tyler. Discipline told Inside Soap: \\"A lot of people say to me, 'Oh, Tyler and Whitney suit each other so much, they're meant to be together'. Then other people come up and they're like, 'Fatboy will be a lot nicer to her'. Yeah, he's a safer bet, but it's all down to what Whit wants - the safer bet or the man she's destined to be with.\\" He continued: \\"I don't know how it's going to go. It could be Fatboy and Whitney who break Tyler's heart, couldn't it? In Tyler's defence, I think he understands Whitney more than anyone else. He's from a similar world to her and can comprehend the things that have gone on in her life. He cares for her.\\" =Storyline development= Discipline has revealed that he would like to see his character engage in a serious relationship. His character, Tyler, is already seen as a ladies man. In an interview with the Inside Soap magazine, he commented: \\"Tyler hasn't got very far, has he? It'd be nice to see how he copes in a relationship and how he'd change from being this cheeky guy.\\" After he was branding a soap hunk, he replied: \\"Oh gosh, well I get a bit of stick about it from my mates, especially when people come up to me in the street. Occasionally when you walk in somewhere, people can be like, 'Tyler Moon! Tyler Moon!', which my friends find hilarious. But I'm actually really flattered by it all.\\" After hearing about his upcoming storyline about a boxing match he is to be injured in, he said: \\"I'm a massive fan of boxing. When they wrote that into the show, I was really happy.\\" After hearing about another upcoming storyline with colleague Shona McGarty, Discipline said to New Magazine: \\"It could be a lot worse! Shona's a lovely person and a great actress. And she's beautiful! There are loads of beautiful girls in EastEnders, aren't there?\\". He is instantly caught in a love triangle between his character Tyler, Whitney and Fatboy. For the upcoming boxing storyline, Discipline shaved all of his hair off to reflect the circumstances. Discussing his new look, the 22-year-old said: \\"I didn't mind, but it makes me look a lot younger. When I first had it done, I walked out of the make-up room and David Essex was p*ssing himself. He said, 'You look about ten years old, mate!'\\" Discipline said he wants Tyler to get a girlfriend. He predicted that Tyler will eventually get together with Whitney. Discipline said: \\"I think Tyler needs to decide what he wants when it comes to women. I'd really like to see him settle down with Whitney eventually. He's harbouring some big love for her.\\" Discipline later said that he wants Tyler to marry Whitney. He told Soaplife that the two characters have the \\"potential for a strong future together\\". He commented: \\"Once they finally get together and everyone's accepted it for what it is and they're left alone, I think they could go really far.\\" Asked whether if a wedding is possible, he replied: \\"I hope so! Their characters would have a big East End wedding. Maybe they'd get Tyler's dad Eddie back from Spain.\\" Viewers will see Tyler get back together with Whitney. Speaking of the plot development, Discipline added: \\"Lucy starts meddling and tells Tyler that Fat Boy is going to propose to Whitney on Valentine's Day. They're at R&R; and Tyler feels he has to tell her not to do it, and reveals his feelings for her. [But] she tells him it's too late. He's really hurt. He knows what he feels about Whitney, and he knows he wants to be there for her, but he can't put it into the right words. This is all new to Tyler. He's never found a girl that he really wants to be with like this.\\" McGarty said that the plot with Tyler and Whitney is \\"weird\\". Speaking to the Sunday Mirror, McGarty commented: \\"We didn't plan this, but you can't help who you fall in love with. I got together with Matt last August and I love absolutely everything about him. He makes me laugh and I tell him stuff I wouldn't tell anyone else. I completely trust him. But I suppose at the moment it is a bit like the kind of plot our writers would come up with, because I'm sort of going out with two brothers. It was a bit weird at first. But we've all brought the situation upon ourselves by falling for each other and now we just laugh about it. Jacqueline doesn't mind me kissing her man and Matt doesn't mind me kissing his EastEnders brother. It's just a job and the romantic scenes are all part of it.\\" However, McGarty said that she wanted Whitney and Fatboy to have a future. Speaking on This Morning, McGarty says she personally thinks that Whitney should stay with because he is so lovely and he genuinely cares. She commented: \\"For Whitney to go with Tyler now is just a risk to take. She doesn't know where it's going to go.\\" She also added that she thinks Whitney has always loved Fatboy as a friend but she was just confused after everything that happened to her. She said: \\"Whitney needed a shoulder to cry on.\\" Reception Inside Soap held a poll to see which of the new Moon family members, Eddie, Tyler or Anthony, its readers were most looking forward to seeing. Tyler came second with 14% of the vote. During an Inside Soap feature on the Moon brothers vs the Mitchell brothers, Kate Woodward said \\"Two sexy brothers to shake up Albert Square? That sounds familiar! But are Anthony and Tyler really the new Grant and Phil Mitchell?\\" Lapinskas commented on this, saying \\"It's a lot of pressure to put us both under, but what a duo to be compared to! [...] Phil and Grant were in the show together for at least 10 years, and they were fantastic‚Äîso to be linked to them is phenomenal. It really is a lot to live up to, but Tony and I are hoping to come in with out own energy and bring something completely new to EastEnders. A columnist for All About Soap said that Tyler was \\"lovesick\\" over Whitney and he behaved like a \\"complete prat\\" in his attempts to win her back. They added that he failed miserably and predicted that in future he will think before opening his \\"big gob\\". A columnist for Soaplife said that they thought Tyler was bisexual. They noted that there had been many hints that indicated he may like men. They added that it would be fitting because Whitney never chooses the right men and predicted that Tyler would sleep with Christian Clarke (John Partridge). For his portrayal of Tyler, Discipline won Best Soap Newcomer at the 2012 TVChoice Awards.

From 1608 to 1611, he was the nominal ruler of Mecklenburg-Schwerin; the actual ruler being the regent, his great-uncle Charles I. From 1611 to 1621 John Albert and his brother Adolf Frederick I jointly ruled the whole Duchy of Mecklenburg. From 1621, John Albert ruled Mecklenburg-G√ºstrow alone. Life John Albert was the son of Duke John VII and Sophia of Schleswig-Holstein-Gottorp. He reigned from 16 April 1608, under the regency of his great-uncle Duke Charles I, jointly with his brother Adolf Frederick I in the Mecklenburg-Schwerin part of the country. After Charles's death, the Emperor declared Adolf Frederick an adult and he ruled alone until John Albert came of age and they began to rule jointly. In 1617 he converted to Protestantism. In the division of Mecklenburg of 1621, John Albert received Mecklenburg-G√ºstrow. In 1623, both brothers joined a defensive alliance of the Lower Saxon Estates. They tried to seem neutral during the Thirty Years' War, but they secretly supported the Danish troops of king Christian IV. After the Imperial side won the Battle of Lutter, Tilly treated them as enemies. On 19 January 1628, Emperor Ferdinand II issue a decree at Brand√Ωs Castle declaring that the brothers had forfeited their fief and that Mecklenburg would be invested to Wallenstein. In May 1628, the brothers left the Duchy, at the request of Wallenstein. In May 1631, Wallenstein was overthrown by Swedish troops, and the brothers returned. John Albert II died in 1636 and was buried in the Minster in G√ºstrow. Marriage and issue John Albert II was married three times.

History =St. Columba Parish= The first Mass celebrated in Youngstown occurred in 1826. St. Columba Parish was founded in 1847, the year that Pope Pius IX established the Diocese of Cleveland, of which Youngstown was a part. The first church was completed in 1850. As the parish grew, it required a larger church, which it completed in 1868. The first parish school building was opened three years later. The parish continued to grow and constructed yet another church which opened in 1897. Bishop Ignatius Horstmann consecrated the sanctuary in 1903. The parish added a convent for the Ursuline Sisters the same year and the copper-covered spires in 1927. The parish continued to use the 1868 church until it was demolished in 1940. =St. Columba Cathedral= Pope Pius XII established the Diocese of Youngstown on May 15, 1943, Bishop James A. McFadden chose St. Columba as cathedral of the new diocese. The parish opened a new school to the rear of the cathedral in 1952. Two years later, on September 2 a disastrous fire destroyed the cathedral. The diocese selected Diehl and Diehl Architects of Detroit to design the new cathedral in the Modern architectural style. Charles Shutrump and Sons Company of Youngstown was the contractor. The new cathedral was completed in 1958 and it became the fourth structure to house the parish. An statue of St. Columba by Joseph M. DiLauro of Detroit occupies a space at the southwest corner of the entrance. It is sculpted from four blocks of Mankato stone. The cathedral celebrated its first English-language Mass in 1964 while the Second Vatican Council was in session.

The term is derived from demoi (Œ¥·øÜŒºŒøŒπ in original Ancient Greek, plural form of Œ¥·øÜŒºŒøœÇ or demos), meaning \\"peoples\\" and kratos (Œ∫œÅŒ¨œÑŒøœÇ) meaning \\"power\\" (to govern oneself). It is apparently meant to become an alternative to democracy, understood as power of a single demos. The term is used mainly to describe the genus of the European Union (EU) but is also gaining currency in more general theories of democracy above state level. History Philippe van Parijs used the term \\"demoi-cracy\\" negatively in 1998Philippe van Parijs 'Should the European union become more democratic?' in Follesdal, Andreas & Koslowski, Peter Democracy and the European Union, 1998 to refer to the existing state of affair in Europe and in contrast to \\"European demos-cracy\\". This is not the meaning of the term in mainstream scholarship today. Instead, the term refers to Kalypso Nicola√Ødis original statement in 2003 that the EU ought to be understood as a demoicracy in the making, a third way against two alternatives which both equate the possibility of democracy with the existence of a single demos, either national demos (the EU as association of democratic states) or supranational (the EU as a federal state). In contrast, the EU is not and should not be conceived of as any form of state (federal or any other) and does not depend on the existence of a single European demos to be demoicratic.Nicola√Ødis, Kalypso 'Our European Demo√Ø-cracy: Is this Constitution a Third Way for Europe?' in Nicolaidis, Kalypso & Weatherill, Stephen Whose Europe? National Models and the Constitution of the European Union, European Studies at Oxford Series, 2003Nicolaidis, Kalypso 'We the Peoples of Europe' in Foreign Affairs, 2004 Thus, the concept has both descriptive and normative aspects. It tries to square the circle between the common criticism that the EU is undemocratic (the democratic deficit thesis) and the claim that there is no European demos (the no demos thesis), purporting that a demos is not a sine qua non for democracy and multiple separate demoi can effectively control the government and in that sense exercise popular sovereignty. Later, Nicolaidis refined her definition of demoicracy as \\"a Union of peoples who govern together but not as one\\" Nicolaidis, Kalypso 'European Demoicracy and Its Crisis,' Journal of Common Market Studies March Volume 51 No 2: 351‚Äì369, 2013 Philosophy Nicola√Ødis‚Äôs originally advanced the concept as an alternative to the calls of the philosopher J√ºrgen HabermasJurgen Habermas 'Why Europe Needs Constitution?' in 11 New Left Review (2001). See also Jurgen Habermas & Jacques Derrida 'February 15, or What Binds Europeans Together' in 10 Constellations (2003). and by the former German foreign minister Joschka FischerJoschka Fischer 'From Confederacy to Federation: Thoughts on the Finality of European Integration', Speech at the Humboldt University in Berlin, 12 May 2000. that a common European identity must and should be ‚Äòforged‚Äô. Instead, she argued in favour of a community which recognises its irreducible internal pluralism and is based on mutual recognition of differences rather than shared values as Habermas would have it. While both sides of the debate premise their argument on some arguable empirical claims (distinct ‚ÄòEuropean‚Äô values or celebration of tolerance respectively), neither of these is necessary for the normative plausibility of demoicracy as a theoretical concept. Currently many other commentators maintain that the concept is uniquely adequate for the age of interdependence of states and globalization of governance which should supersede the 'nation-centred' vocabulary.Jan-Werner Muller 'The Promise of Demoi-cracy: Diversity and Domination in the European Public Order' in Neyer, Jurgen & Wiener, Antije The Political Theory of the European Union(2010) Perhaps that is why the term was later embraced by some of the major proponents of deliberative democracy like James BohmanJames Bohman 'From Demos to Demoi: Democracy across Borders' in 18 Ratio Juris (2005). and Samantha BessonSamantha Besson 'Deliberative Demoi- cracy in the EU: Towards the Deteritorialisation of Democracy' in Samantha Besson & Jose Luis Marti, Deliberative democracy and its discontents (2006). (even if not by Habermas himself). With the work of the latter authors the concept gained currency beyond the EU-scholarship and especially among the cosmopolitan republicanists as the most promising way for realisation of transnational democracy. Bohman in particular sees demoicracy as an emancipation project. It is meant to avoid domination which can occur across borders (citizens of one state may suffer from decisions of citizens of another which are taken arbitrarily). As domination can occur also internally all oppressed groups may qualify as demoi deserving a voice in governance. Thus, Besson suggests a dynamic concept of demoi, which comprises all those affected by any particular decision (and thus subject to arbitrary domination by the group of the decision-makers). European Union With regard to the EU the concept has been criticized because it does not provide an answer to the 'no demos thesis' but merely disguises the problem of democratic deficit and forgoes the capacity of peoples to collectively control their fate.Peter Mair, ‚ÄòRuling the Void? The Hollowing of Western Democracy‚Äô in New Left Review (2006). Yet the concept is certainly more than a euphemism or exercise in scholastic creativity ‚Äì if the EU is qualitatively different from the nation state (and from the federation) it needs to be analysed in different terms as well. As many academics claim the EU is not a (super-)state, it might be considered misleading to evaluate it in terms of a state. Indeed, it makes little sense to claim that the Union is not a state and in the same time to criticise it for not being a democratic one. On the other hand, if it is recognised that the Union, as a polity of its own kind is to be analysed in idiosyncratic terms, we face a problem of circularity ‚Äì we face an entity which claims to be a standard to itself. Recognising that, Francis Cheneval and Frank Schimmelfenning propose to extend the moral constructivism of John Rawls to transnational cases: 'the inter-subjective beliefs about the moral purpose of the liberal democratic state do not only imply the normative expectation of rule of law and procedural justice for the fundamental institutions of international society. They also imply normative expectations of democratic government in a society of liberal democratic states. The inter- subjective beliefs about the moral purpose of the liberal democratic state will eventually filter through into the relational structure of liberal democratic states.'Francis Cheneval & Frank Schimmelfenning 'The Case for Demoicracy in the EU' (2011) available at http://euce.org/eusa/2011/papers/8h_cheneval.pdf Thus they set out to derive abstract moral principles for a demoicracy and use them to judge the EU subsequently. Their principles apply to transnational as well as to national level, and they find that the EU is approaching these principle while 'major demoi-cratic deficits remain at the national level.' In spite of this optimistic result, there is at least one deficiency of the EU from demoicratic perspective and it is that the governance discourse is almost exclusively elitist. This is especially problematic as demoicracy is calling for even more involvement of citizens on issues of governance. Development Most demoicracy scholarship is abstract, and very little has been done to flesh out what an actual demoicracy should look like. Yet there are few practical claims that seem shared by all of the commentators. The first is the reliance on networks as agents of democracy beyond the nation-state where discourses are not mediated by states or nationality. The second is the active participation of citizens in these networks so that they are involved in the decision- making, deliberations and contestation at every level. All demoicrats would emphasise the importance of horizontal relationships between citizens, organisations and institutions from the different demoi on issues of their collective governance or on the governance of other states. Rights and legitimate interests of citizens are not limited to their own demos/polity but are extended across the borders to what is usually considered internal affairs of the other polities and people. This horizontal relationship is what distinguishes a demoicracy from a federation where the internal affairs of a federal unit are insulated from external contestation at least horizontally. Beyond these general principles however, few details of an actual demoicracy are spelled out. To remedy this, Cheneval and Schimmelfenning with a team of researchers at ETH Zurich have embarked on a project intended 'to map and explain the development of demoicratic institutions.'The project 'Designing \\"Demoi-cracy\\" in the European Union' of the Eidgenossische Technische Hochschule (Swiss Federal Institute of Technology) Zurich. More information is available at http://www.eup.ethz.ch/research/demoicracy/ A precious few examples of genuine demoicratic institutions have been identified by other researchers. Bohman celebrates the system of policy coordination through committees and agencies in the EU as a demoicratic mechanism. This is noteworthy, as from the traditional, that is demo-cratic, perspective the influence of numerous EU committees and working parties is quite questionable. In the same vein, Michael Buess reconsiders the interaction between the EU agencies and their national counterparts from demoicratic perspective.Michael Buess 'European Union Agencies' Relationships with their National Counterparts' presentation at European Union Studies Association Conference Boston, March 2011 Another example of demoicratically interlinked institutions is the so-called ‚Äòyellow card‚Äô or Early Warning Mechanism introduced by the Lisbon Treaty. According to Vesco Paskalev this is an attempt to provide an institutionalized network which enables many demoi to deliberate together on substantive EU legislation.Vesco Paskalev 'Lisbon Treaty and the Possibility of a European Network Demoi-Cracy' (2009), European University Institute Working paper available at http://cadmus.eui.eu/bitstream/handle/1814/13005/LAW_2009_20.pdf?sequence=1.

Architecture =Exterior= St Catherine's is constructed in random rubble. It has a slate roof with a stone ridge. The church has a simple plan, consisting of a single cell in four bays, and a south porch. At the west end is a gabled double bellcote, and there is a cross on the apex of the east end. The side windows are mainly 19th-century replacements of earlier windows, and are mullioned. The east window has three lights and contains Decorated-style tracery. =Interior= Inside the church is an octagonal font; its bowl has low-relief carving on each face. On the south wall of the church is a benefactors' board dated 1798. All the stained glass dates from between 1889 and 1896. The glass in the east and west windows is by Gibbs and Company, and that on the north and south sides is by A. Savell and Company. The glass in the east window depicts Saint Catherine, the Good Shepherd, and Saint Cecilia. Windows on the south side of the church depict the Annunciation, and on the north side the Last Supper. One of the bells in the bellcote was cast in 1445.

It is found in Western Europe. Description Hypericum hirsutum is a downy perennial plant that grows to two or three feet. It has erect stems and opposite pairs of untoothed, elongated oval leaves with translucent glandular dots. The terminal inflorescences have many pale yellow flowers. Each has five pointed sepals with stalked black dots on the margins. The five petals also may have black dots and the many stamens are in bundles. Hairy St John's wort is very similar to common St John's wort (H. perforatum) but can be distinguished by the downy stems and the much longer leaves. =Phytochemistry= Miquelianin (Quercetin 3-O-glucuronide), a type of phenolic compound, is present in H. hirsutum. Distribution Hypericum hirsutum is a species of temperate regions and grows in Europe and western Siberia. It is uncommon and localised in Finland which is to the north of its European range In Britain it is a widespread species except for the far north and west while it is rare and localised in Ireland being found at only two sites in Northern Ireland and with its Irish range centred around County Dublin. Habitat and ecology Hypericum hirsutum is a perennial herb which prefers free-draining, neutral to base-rich soils. It grows in open or partially shaded habitats such as rough and ungrazed grassland, clearings and rides in woodland, on the banks of rivers and road verges. In Britain it has an altitudinal range from sea level to in Cumberland. At the very northern extreme of its range, in south-western Finland it grows in the open, lime rich situations and does not grow in shade.

Howard's sword and sorcery hero Conan the Barbarian. It was first published in trade paperback by Tor Books in September 1985; a regular paperback edition followed from the same publisher in September 1986, and was reprinted in January 1992. The first British edition was published in paperback by Sphere Books in September 1987. The book also includes \\"Conan the Indestructible\\", L. Sprague de Camp's chronological essay on Conan's career. Plot Hathor-Ka, a Stygian sorceress, tricks Conan into stealing certain relics from Ben Morgh, a sacred mountain in Cimmeria. His expedition takes him across Koth, Nemedia, and the Border Kingdoms where Conan is diverted by his rescue of a chieftainess. Meanwhile, Jaganath (a sorcerer from Vendhya) is also on a journey into the Cimmerian Wilderness. In Cimmeria, the various clans are uniting against the Vanir and their allies, a tribe of lizard folk. The two armies are traveling towards Ben Morgh and proceed with a final battle. As the conflict rages on, Conan and a wizard from Khitai wage a more crucial battle inside Crom's Cave beneath the mountain with the aid of Jaganath, Hathor-Ka, and her patron, Thoth-Amon. Ultimately, Cimmeria is delivered from outside sorcery and Conan joins a raiding party of Aesir in their journey towards Hyberborea. Reception Don D'Ammassa, writing of Roberts' Conan novels, noted that \\"[a]lthough Roberts did not recreate Howard's character exactly, making him more intellectual and less inclined to solve every problem by hitting it with a sword, his evocation of the barbaric setting is superior to that of most of the other writers contributing to the series.\\" He calls this novel, \\"the author's first Conan pastiche, one of the better entries in the series, and the closest view we see of the land [of] Cimmeria except for the Conan novel by Harry Turtledove.\\"D'Ammassa, Don. \\"Conan the Valorous\\" (review on Critical Mass). Nov. 12, 2017. Writing of some other Tor Conan novels, reviewer Ryan Harvey called Roberts \\"the most consistently successful of its stable of authors,\\"Harvey, Ryan. \\"Pastiches 'R' Us: Conan and the Treasure of Python\\" (Review), Mar. 24, 2009. and \\"the most consistently entertaining\\" of them, showing \\"deft ability with storytelling and action scenes, and a thankful tendency not to overplay his hand and try to ape Robert E.

In practice, it often consists of having a line of soldiers all fire their weapons simultaneously at the enemy forces on command. This is usually to make up for the inaccuracy, slow rate of fire, and limited range of a weapon which requires extensive effort to reload. The volley fire, specifically the musketry volley technique, also known as the countermarch, requires lines of soldiers to fire on command and march back into a column to reload while the next row shoots and, hence, repeat fire. While this tactic is usually associated with Dutch military thinkers in the late 16th century, its principles have been applied to crossbow infantry since at least the Tang dynasty.

Diagram of a 1649 Korean musketry volley formation. =Crossbows= Although volley fire is most often associated with firearms, the concept of continuous and concerted rotating fire may have been practiced using crossbows since at least the Han dynasty as described in the Han-Xiongnu Wars in the Records of the Grand Historian, although it was not until the Tang dynasty that detailed illustrations appeared. During the An Lushan Rebellion the Tang general Li Guangbi successfully deployed a spear crossbow formation against the rebel cavalry forces under Shi Siming. In 756 Shi Siming raced ahead of the main army with his mounted troops to intercept Li Guangbi's Shuofang army near the town of Changshan. Li took Changshan in advance and set up his men with their backs to the town walls to prevent a sneak attack. The spearmen formed a dense defensive formation while 1,000 crossbowmen divided into four sections to provide continuous volley fire. When Shi's cavalry engaged Li's Shuofang army they were completely unable to close in on his troops and suffered heavy losses, forcing a withdrawal. The 759 CE text, Tai bai yin jing (Â§™ÁôΩÈô∞Á∂ì) by Tang military official Li Quan (ÊùéÁ≠å), contains the oldest known depiction and description of the volley fire technique. The illustration shows a rectangular crossbow formation with each circle representing one man. In the front is a line labeled \\"shooting crossbows\\" (ÁôºÂº©) and behind that line are rows of crossbowmen, two facing right and two facing left, and they are labeled \\"loading crossbows\\" (ÂºµÂº©). The commander (Â§ßÂ∞áËªç) is situated in the middle of the formation and to his right and left are vertical rows of drummers (Èºì) who coordinate the firing and reloading procedure in procession: who loaded their weapons, stepped forward to the outer ranks, shot, and then retired to reload. According to Li Quan, \\"the classics say that the crossbow is fury. It is said that its noise is so powerful that it sounds like fury, and that's why they named it this way,\\" and by using the volley fire method there is no end to the sound and fury, and the enemy is unable to approach. Here he is referring to the word for \\"crossbow\\" nu which is also a homophone for the word for fury, nu. The encyclopedic text known as the Tongdian by Du You from 801 CE also provides a description of the volley fire technique: \\"[Crossbow units] should be divided into teams that can concentrate their arrow shooting.‚Ä¶ Those in the center of the formations should load [their bows] while those on the outside of the formations should shoot. They take turns, revolving and returning, so that once they've loaded they exit [i.e., proceed to the outer ranks] and once they've shot they enter [i.e., go within the formations]. In this way, the sound of the crossbow will not cease and the enemy will not harm us.\\" While the virtues of the rotating volley fire were understood during the Tang dynasty, the Wujing Zongyao written during the Song dynasty notes that it was not utilized to its full effectiveness due to their fear of cavalry charges. The author's solution was to drill the soldiers to the point where rather than hide behind shield units upon the approach of melee infantry, they would \\"plant the feet like a firm mountain, and, unmoving at the front of the battle arrays, shoot thickly to the middle [of the enemy], and none among them will not fall down dead.\\" The Song volley fire formation was described thus: \\"Those in the center of the formation should load while those on the outside of the formation should shoot, and when [the enemy gets] close, then they should shelter themselves with small shields [literally side shields, ÊóÅÁâå], each taking turns and returning, so that those who are loading are within the formation. In this way the crossbows will not cease sounding.\\" In addition to the Tang formation, the Song illustration also added a new label to the middle line of crossbowmen between the firing and reloading lines, known as the \\"advancing crossbows.\\" Both Tang and Song manuals also made aware to the reader that \\"the accumulated arrows should be shot in a stream, which means that in front of them there must be no standing troops, and across [from them] no horizontal formations.\\" The volley fire technique was used to great effect by the Song during the Jin-Song Wars. In the fall of 1131 the Jin commander Wuzhu (ÂÖÄÊúÆ) invaded the Shaanxi region but was defeated by general Wu Jie (Âê≥Áé†) and his younger brother Wu Lin (Âê≥Áíò). The History of Song elaborates on the battle in detail: After losing half his army Wuzhu escaped back to the north, only to invade again in the following year. Again, he was defeated while trying to breach a strategic pass. The History of Song states that during the battle Wu Jie's brother Wu Lin \\"used the Standing-Firm Arrow Teams, who shot alternately, and the arrows fell like rain, and the dead piled up in layers, but the enemy climbed over them and kept climbing up.\\" This passage is especially noteworthy for its mention of a special technique being utilized as it is one of the very few times that the History of Song has elaborated on a specific tactic. The crossbow volley fire remained a popular tactic into the Ming dynasty. The martial artist Cheng Chongdou, who studied at the Shaolin Temple, was a particularly avid proponent of the mixed crossbow volley and melee infantry force, which would ideally carry both a wearable crossbow strapped behind the back as well as a personal melee weapon such as the lance or sword. He provides a detailed description of the volley fire technique in a military text ca. 1621: =Bows= In Europe volley fire was also used by archers, for example at the Battle of Agincourt in 1415. =Firearms= Usage in individual nations and cultures =Early Ming dynasty= The earliest possible employment of volley fire for firearms occurred in late 14th century China during a military conflict between Ming and Mong Mao forces. Volley fire was also possibly implemented with firearms in 1414 during the Yongle Emperor's campaigns against the Mongols, and possibly again in another expedition in 1422. However the language used in these sources is unclear as to whether or not repeating fire was part of the technique implemented. For example, during the 1388 anti-insurrection war waged against the Mong Mao by the Ming general Mu Ying, the Ming troops equipped with guns and fire arrows were arrayed in three lines. The general Mu Ying explained this was so that \\"when the elephants advance, the front line of guns and arrows will shoot all at once. If they do not retreat, the next line will continue this. If they still do not retreat, then the third line will continue this.\\" When the armored war elephants broke into a run, charging the Ming lines, the Ming forces stood their ground, \\"shooting arrows and stones, the noise shaking the mountains and vallies. The elephants shook with fear and ran.\\" According to the Ming Shilu, half the elephants were killed while 37 were captured, and of the 100,000 strong insurrection force, at least 30,000 were killed, and 10,000 were captured. Andrade and other historians have interpreted this passage as evidence of volley fire, however he admits that it is ambiguous as to whether or not the Ming lines practiced repeated fire and reloading, so at best it can only be considered a limited form of volley fire. The Ming Shilu goes on to mention another possible instance of volley fire, this time during the Yongle Emperor's campaigns against the Mongols. In 1414 \\"the commander-in-chief (ÈÉΩÁù£) Zhu Chong led L√º Guang and others directly to the fore, where they assaulted the enemy by firing firearms and guns continuously and in succession. Countless enemies were killed.\\" In this case the source makes no mention of taking turns or forming lines, but Andrade believes that since the Ming were facing horseback Mongol forces, it would have been impossible to keep continuous fire in the face of a cavalry charge had ordered ranks of gunners not been implemented. The same rationality is applied to another passage on the 1422 expedition, where \\"the emperor ordered that all the generals train their troops outside each encampment by arranging their formations so that the gunnery units (Á•ûÊ©üÈäÉ) occupied the foremost positions and the cavalry units occupied the rear. He ordered officers to exercise and drill in their free time (ÊöáÈñëÊìçÁøí). He admonished them as follows: \\"A formation that is dense is solid, while an advance force is sparse, and when they arrive at the gates of war and it's time to fight, then first use the guns to destroy their advance guard and then use cavalry to rush their solidity. In this way there is nothing to fear.\\"\\" Some historians have extrapolated from this that the Ming forces were using volley fire with firearms since their opponents were cavalry units, and hence impossible to stop with slow firing hand cannons unless it was through continuous volley fire, much less with a thin advance guard of gunnery units. According to Wang Zhaochun, \\"the meaning of this is that when fighting, the gun troops line up in front of the entire formation, and between them there must be a certain amount of space, so that they can load bullets and powder and employ shooting by turns and in concert to destroy the enemy advance guard. Once the enemy has been thrown into chaos, the rear densely arrayed cavalry troops together come forth in great vigor, striking forth with irresistible force.\\" Even if Wang is correct, the evidence is still inconclusive. =Ottoman Empire= The volley tactic next appeared in early 16th century Europe when the Ottoman Janissaries clashed with European forces at the Battle of Moh√°cs on 29 August 1526. The Janissaries equipped with 2000 t√ºfenks (usually translated as musket) \\"formed nine consecutive rows and they fired their weapons row by row,\\" in a \\"kneeling or standing position without the need for additional support or rest.\\" However the usage of arquebuses in this battle is disputed and they may have been small cannons instead. Contrary to the popular belief that the Ottomans' success at Moh√°cs was due to their artillery, a view which many later historians have supported, contemporary European and Ottoman sources on the battle attribute their success to the Janissaries' successful deployment of firearms. However the Janissaries' prowess declined early in the 17th century as troop standards dropped and the drill was abandoned. According to the author of The Laws of the Janissaries (Kavanin-i Yenigeriyan), by 1606 members of the Janissaries were faced with supply issues so that they \\"were no longer given powder for the drills and that the soldiers used the wick for their candles and not for their muskets.\\" =Qi Jiguang= By 1548 the Ming had started fielding arquebuses after procuring knowledge of the weapon from the pirate network at Shuangyu. The military leader Qi Jiguang, who was at first ambivalent towards matchlocks, became one of the primary advocates for their incorporation into the Ming army later on in his life. After having suffered his first defeats at the hands of the wokou, he realized the vital role of this new weapon in combating piracy, for it out ranged their heaviest arrows. By 1560 he had invented a style of musket warfare similar to the Tang crossbow volley technique which he described the same year in his magnum opus, the Jixiao Xinshu: Qi Jiguang further elaborates on the five layered musket volley formation: If melee weapons could not be brought into combat, such as during long range defense, Qi recommended waiting \\"until the face-the-enemy signal [is given], and then, whether from behind wooden stockades, or from moat banks, or from below abatis (ÊãíÈ¶¨), [they] open up on the enemy, firing by turns (Êõ¥Áï™Â∞ÑË≥ä). Those who are empty reload; those who are full fire again. While the ones who have fired are loading, those who are full then fire again. In this way, all day long, the firing of guns will not be lacking, and there must be no firing to the point of exhaustion [of ammo] and no slipups with guns.\\" In 1571 Qi prescribed an ideal infantry regiment of 1080 arquebusiers out of 2700 men, or 40 percent of the infantry force. However it is not known how well this was actually implemented, and there is evidence that Qi was met with stiff resistance to the incorporation of newer gunpowder weapons in northern China while he was stationed there. He writes that \\"in the north soldiers are stupid and impatient, to the point that they cannot see the strength of the musket, and they insist on holding tight to their fast lances (a type of fire lance), and although when comparing and vying on the practice field the musket can hit the bullseye ten times better than the fast-lance and five times better than the bow and arrow, they refuse to be convinced.\\" =Japan= The musket volley fire technique may have been used in Japan as well as early as 1575 at the Battle of Nagashino by Oda Nobunaga's arquebusiers. But this has been called into dispute in recent years by J.S.A. Elisonas and J.P. Lamers in their translation of The Chronicle of Oda Nobunaga by Ota Gyuichi. In Lamers' Japonius he says that \\"whether or not Nobunaga actually operated with three rotating ranks cannot be determined on the basis of reliable evidence.\\" They claim that the version of events describing volley fire was written several years after the battle, and an earlier account says to the contrary that guns were fired en masse. However both Korean and Chinese sources note that Japanese gunners were making use of volley fire during the Japanese invasions of Korea (1592‚Äì98). =Europe= Frederick Lewis Taylor claims that a kneeling volley fire may have been employed by Prospero Colonna's arquebusiers as early as the Battle of Bicocca (1522).Taylor, Frederick. (1921). The Art of War in Italy, 1494-1529. p. 52. However this has been called into question by Tonio Andrade who believes this is an over interpretation as well as mis-citation of a passage by Charles Oman suggesting that the Spanish arquebusiers kneeled to reload, when in fact Oman never made such a claim. European gunners might have implemented the volley fire to some extent since at least 1579 when the Englishman Thomas Digges suggested that musketeers should, \\"after the old Romane manner make three or four several fronts, with convenient spaces for the first to retire and unite himselfe with the second, and both these if occasion so require, with the third; the shot [musketeers] having their convenient lanes continually during the fight to discharge their peces.\\" The Spanish too displayed some awareness of the volley technique and described it in the military manual, Milicia, Discurso y Regla Militar, dating to 1586: \\"Start with three files of five soldiers each, separated one from the other by fifteen paces, and they should comport themselves not with fury but with calm skillfulness [con reposo diestramente] such that when the first file has finished shooting they make space for the next (which is coming up to shoot) without turning face, countermarching [contrapassando] to the left but showing the enemy only the side of their bodies, which is the narrowest of the body, and [taking their place at the rear] about one to three steps behind, with five or six pellets in their mouths, and two lighted matchlock fuses ‚Ä¶ and they load [their pieces] promptly ‚Ä¶ and return to shoot when it's their turn again.\\" Regardless, it is clear that the concept of volley fire had existed in Europe for quite some time during the 16th century, but it was in the Netherlands during the 1590s that the musketry volley really took off. The key to this development was William Louis, Count of Nassau-Dillenburg who in 1594 described the technique in a letter to his cousin: =Joseon= In Korea the Joseon dynasty underwent a devastating war with newly unified Japan that lasted from 1592 to 1598. The shock of this encounter spurred the court to undergo a process of military strengthening. One of the core elements of military strengthening was to adopt the musket. According to reformers, \\"In recent times in China they did not have muskets; they first learned about them from the Wokou pirates in Zhejiang Province. Qi Jiguang trained troops in their use for several years until they [muskets] became one of the skills of the Chinese, who subsequently used them to defeat the Japanese.\\" By 1607 Korean musketeers had been trained in the fashion which Qi Jiguang prescribed, and a drill manual had been produced based on the Chinese leader's Jixiao Xinshu. Of the volley fire, the manual says that \\"every musketeer squad should either divide into two musketeers per layer or one and deliver fire in five volleys or in ten.\\" Another Korean manual produced in 1649 describes a similar process: \\"When the enemy approaches to within a hundred paces, a signal gun is fired and a conch is blown, at which the soldiers stand. Then a gong is sounded, the conch stops blowing, and the heavenly swan [a double-reed horn] is sounded, at which the musketeers fire in concert, either all at once or in five volleys (ÈΩäÊîæ‰∏ÄÊ¨°Áõ°ÊìßÊàñÂàÜ‰∫îÊìß).\\" This training method proved to be quite formidable in the 1619 Battle of Sarhu when 10,000 Korean musketeers managed to kill many Manchus before their allies surrendered. While Korea went on to lose both wars against the Manchu invasions of 1627 and 1636, their musketeers were well respected by Manchu leaders. It was the first Qing emperor Hong Taiji who wrote: \\"The Koreans are incapable on horseback but do not transgress the principles of the military arts. They excel at infantry fighting, especially in musketeer tactics.\\" Historical techniques =Drilling= For many Europeans this new way of conducting warfare seemed ridiculous, so that in the beginning they were openly mocked. But the Dutch army continued to drill the volley under both Louis and his cousin Maurice, Prince of Orange, so that it became second nature. One Dutch historian recounts the exercises in which regiments marched \\"man by man bringing the rearmost to the front and the frontmost to the rear.‚Ä¶ The beginnings were very difficult, and many people felt, because it was all so unusual, that it was odd and ridiculous [lacherlich]. They were mocked by the enemy, but with time the great advantages of the practices became clear ‚Ä¶ and eventually they were copied by other nations.\\" Soon the reorganized Dutch army displayed the virtues of the countermarch volley and the practice spread across Europe. An important component to the successful deployment of volley fire was the drill, which according to Geoffrey Parker, \\"only two civilisation have invented drill for their infantry: China and Europe. Moreover, both of them did so twice: in the fifth century BC in North China and in Greece, and again in the late sixteenth century. Exponents of the second phase‚Äî Qi Jiguang in Imperial China and Maurice of Nassau in the Dutch Republic‚Äîexplicitly sought to revive classical precedents, and in the West, marching in step and standing on parade became a permanent part of military life.\\" Drill was difficult and the manner in which the volley fire should be executed had not been perfected in Louis' time. It is clear from Holland's historical sources that it took many trials and experiments for the process to be refined. Indeed, just using the musket itself was considered unorthodox and in some parts of the world there was even a push back against the incorporation of muskets. According to Qi Jiguang, this was because: =18th century= In the European armies there were several volley fire techniques for the effective use of a huge mass of muskets at a distance of 200-300 meters.Hughes B. P. Firepower. Weapons effectives on the battlefield, 1630‚Äì1850Haythornthwaite Ph. J. Napoleonic Infantry: Napoleonic Weapons and Warfare It should be understood that the main goal of volley fire is to save ammunition, and not accuracy. For more accurate and deadly fire, light infantry companies and regiments are created in all armies. These soldiers have much better training and are able to conduct effective fire with single shots, rather than massive volleys.British Light Infantry and Rifle Tactics of the Napoleonic Wars Light infantry covers the line infantry from the fire of enemy skirmishers, while the line infantry concentrates massive fire along the infantry line or cavalry of the enemy. Several different methods were used: in the Swedish army, a battalion would approach the enemy, fire one or several volleys, and then charge the enemy with swords, pikes and (later) bayonets, a style they dubbed \\"G√• P√•\\" (which translates roughly as \\"Go at them\\"). The Dutch developed the system of platoon firing, which was perfected by the British during the 18th century: here, the battalion, lined up in three rows, was divided into 24-30 platoons which would fire alternately, thus concentrating their fire. This required intensive training for the soldiers, who had to operate their muskets in close ranks. After the command to make ready was given, the first rank knelt down, whilst the third rank stepped slightly to the right, in order to level their muskets past the men in front of them. The French army had trouble adopting this method and relied for the most part of the 18th century on firing by ranks, in which the first rank fired first, followed by the second, and then the third rank. This method was acknowledged by the French command at the time to be far less effective. The Prussian army, reformed under the \\"Alte Dessauer\\", placed much emphasis on firepower. In order to make the men load and fire their muskets quicker, the iron ramrod was developed. Voltaire once commented that the Prussian soldiers could load and fire their muskets seven times in a minute; this is a gross exaggeration, but it is an indication of the drill, which led to platoons firing devastating volleys with clockwork precision. In all, a professional soldier was required to load and fire his musket three times in a minute. Despite the development of light infantry tactics and the increased effectiveness of firearms during the 19th century, as was witnessed during the American Civil War and the Franco-Prussian War, the linear tactics, with massed volley fire, remained the basics of European warfare up to World War I.  Depictions  Movies often give wrongful depictions of linear tactics and warfare in the early modern period. Movies on the American Civil War, like Gettysburg and Gods and Generals also give a fairly accurate impression of this method. Volley fire was depicted in the movie Zulu, a fictionalization of the Battle of Rorke's Drift. In the defense of a fixed position, British infantry used three-rank volley fire to decimate an attack by a large Zulu force. Despite the Zulus' superior numbers, the attack collapsed under the relentless volley fire they faced.  In modern times  Already in the American Civil War and the Franco-Prussian War, the development of modern weapons had devastating effects on the infantry, which still operated in basically 18th century style. The infantry itself also was equipped with rifles that fired faster and more accurately than the flintlock muskets, such as the French Chassepot and the Prussian needle rifle. It wasn't until World War I however that the linear tactics and volley fire were finally abandoned, after in the first stages of the war, relentless fire from artillery and machine guns had decimated the armies, and the infantry had no option but to dig in and hide in trenches. In modern times the use of volley fire is limited, since automatic weapons can devastate massed infantry on their own without volley fire formations.

The station consists of a center island platform between the line's two tracks, with handicapped-accessible ramps to Blue Hill Avenue and Cummins Highway. Originally intended to open along with Newmarket, Four Corners/Geneva, and Talbot Avenue, it was significantly delayed due to local controversy. Construction began in 2017, and the station opened on February 25, 2019. History Early 20th century postcard of Mattapan station, near the modern station site =Previous service= Service on the Fairmount Line (as the Dorchester Branch of the Norfolk County Railroad and later the New York and New England Railroad and New York, New Haven and Hartford Railroad) began in 1855 and lasted until 1944. A station called Mattapan was located at Blue Hill Avenue. A station building was located on the inbound side, with a shelter on the outbound side. (This station was separate from the Dorchester and Milton Branch Railroad's Mattapan station, which still stands in Mattapan Square next to the trolley station that replaced it.) Another station, \\"Rugby\\", was located at what is now Greenfield Road. No trace of either former station remains. =Improvement project= Temporary shuttle service resumed on the Fairmount Line in 1979 during Southwest Corridor construction, with stops at Uphams Corner, Morton Street, and Fairmount. The MBTA planned to drop the shuttle after service resumed on the Southwest Corridor in 1987, but the service was locally popular and the Fairmount Line became a permanent part of the system. A plan called the \\"Indigo Line\\" was then advanced by community activists, who proposed a route that would add stations and more frequent service, to approach the standards of a conventional rapid transit line. The Indigo Line plan was not adopted, but elements of it were included when the Commonwealth of Massachusetts agreed in 2005 to make improvements on the Fairmount Line a part of its legally binding commitment to mitigate increased air pollution from the Big Dig. Among the selected improvements in the Fairmount Line Improvements project were four new commuter rail stations on the line, including one at Blue Hill Avenue. The stations were originally to be completed by the end of 2011. =Planning= The planned station site in 2012 Three of the stations - Newmarket, Four Corners/Geneva, and Talbot Avenue - began construction in 2011 and opened in 2012 and 2013. However, Blue Hill Avenue has been the focus of major community opposition over the station site and design, which has resulted in significant delays. Originally, the station was to be located between Blue Hill Avenue and Cummins Highway, with two side platforms like the other stations on the line. However, property owners in a neighborhood association objected to the projected construction activity and operational noise, forcing a total redesign of the station. The MBTA analyzed several alternative sites for the station. Sites east of Blue Hill Avenue, west of Cummins Highway, and west of River Street would have required property taking, while a location at River Street was on a curve too tight to allow a high-level platform without significant platform gaps. In May 2011, the MBTA decided to keep the station site between Blue Hills Avenue and Cummins Highway, but to change the station design. The new design with a single island platform will keep construction further from abutting homes and lower the cost of the station. However, the change did not satisfy all residents, and the debate continued after announcement of the decision. Final design of the station, including analyzing 26 nearby homes for noise abatement, was expected to be completed in the middle of 2012. However, local elected officials demanded an independent design review of the project, further delaying the project to at least 2015. The MBTA had planned to advertise the $10 million construction contract in December 2012, but did not do so. In July 2013, the MBTA announced that construction would begin within several months, but again this was a false start. A public meeting held in April 2014 showed mixed local opinions about the stations, with some nearby residents feeling that the stop was imposed on the neighborhood by the MBTA without sufficient public input. At that meeting, the MBTA presented a plan under which construction would begin in May 2015 for a December 2016 opening. A later meeting in September 2014 adjusted the schedule, with construction beginning in September 2015 for a June 2017 opening. In July 2015, the MBTA began soliciting proposals for artists to design four panels on station signs. One-half percent of the construction cost, approximately $70,000, is budgeted to pay the artists. By February 2016, final design was expected to be completed in the first half of 2016. However, no funding was yet available for the $25.2 million construction cost, placing the station's future in doubt. Plans for 100% design were submitted in March 2016. In June 2016, the Massachusetts Department of Transportation board approved a $14.8 billion 5-year Capital Investment Plan. Under the plan, Blue Hill Ave station had guaranteed funding for the $26 million construction cost. Over $3 million was allotted in FY2017, with the remaining $22 million to between FY2018 and FY2021. =Construction= The station under construction in December 2017 Bidding for the $19.3 million main construction contract opened in December 2016. On January 24, 2017, the MBTA Fiscal Management and Control Board approved a $16.97 million contract. Construction was to begin in Spring 2017 for a Spring 2019 opening. Construction of the station began on June 3, 2017. To accommodate construction work at the station site, all weekend Fairmount Line trains in both directions were cut back to Morton Street, with bus shuttles between Morton Street, Fairmount, and Readville, and late-night outbound Fairmount Line service on weekdays was completely replaced with busses. The station opened on February 25, 2019. A formal ribbon-cutting ceremony was held on March 6. Blue Hill Avenue originally had bike racks, however they were removed the day before opening. Travel time from Blue Hill Avenue to downtown (South Station) is scheduled for 23 minutes - a substantial reduction from the 45-60 minutes common when using the Red Line or buses. Bus connections Four bus routes which terminate at Mattapan station, five blocks to the south, serve Blue Hill Avenue station.

It is a frequently used component of a policy analysis and can serve as an evaluative criterion in choosing between policy alternatives.Webber, D. J. (1986), ANALYZING POLITICAL FEASIBILITY: POLITICAL SCIENTISTS1 UNIQUE CONTRIBUTION TO POLICY ANALYSIS. Policy Studies Journal, 14: 545‚Äì553. doi: 10.1111/j.1541-0072.1986.tb00360.x Feasible policies must be politically acceptable or at least not unacceptable. Political unacceptability is a combination of two conditions too much opposition or too little support. One common mistake is widespread in practice that feasibility becomes a dominant criterion of preferable alternative. Feasibility is ‚Äúthe state or degree of being easily or conveniently done‚Äù.Merriam Webster More plainly, one might ask ‚Äúcan we get this done?‚Äù Feasibility, as it pertains to the political arena, speaks to the political climate. The question then becomes: ‚ÄúIn this political climate, can we get this done?‚Äù Political feasibility is a measure of how well a solution to a policy problem, will be accepted by a set of decision makers and the general public. For a policy to be enacted and implemented, it must be politically acceptable, or feasible. A policy alternative's lack of political feasibility can often be attributed to its lack of political support or the result of controversy that may surround the issue the policy seeks to address. Alternatively, a politically feasible alternative is one that has the greatest probability of \\"receiv[ing] sufficient political push and support to be implemented\\" given any specific constraints. When policy analysis generates policy alternatives, the political risks and costs associated with each can be important criteria for deciding between alternatives. A good policy alternative requires a certain amount of political feasibility, or implementation of the policy will be impossible. It is important to keep in mind, however, that feasibility alone does not make a policy \\"good.\\" Examining all criteria is necessary for the implementation of socially responsible policy. Politics are difficult to predict but it has been said that \\"no decision is ever made in complex systems without political feasibility having played some role.\\"  Steps in a political feasibility analysis  As every policy problem differs from the next, so do the elements involved in a political feasibility analysis. But in order to get started, the analyst works within a basic framework for his/her investigation. These basic steps, as identified by Arnold Meltsner are outlined in the following sections. David Weimer and Aidan Vining argue that in practice analysts should answer the questions iteratively, ‚Äúmoving among them as (the analyst) learn(s) more about the political environment,‚Äù meaning that what happens at one stage of the process of identifying political feasibility can affect earlier stages. = Identify the policy's environment = The first step for the policy analyst is to identify the space in which the policy problem exists. This is generally a broad policy space, such as health policy or environmental policy. Next the analyst defines the specific policy issue area. In keeping with the example, the narrower policy issue area is renewable energy. Once this is done, the analyst can begin to identify the players involved in the policy. Within this step there are other considerations to include, such as the level of public awareness of the proposed policy, the dynamics created by the timing of the policy proposal, and the concerns and voting patterns of different demographics. For an example, see the political feasibility analysis commissioned by the SF Bay Restoration Authority to assess support for a parcel tax that would raise funds for its efforts to restore the area's depleted wetlands. = Assemble information and organize it = In this step, the analyst outlines political scenarios surrounding the proposed policy. The following factors should be identified with some detail. Further elements of the list can be tailored to fit the specific policy and its environment, if needed. Identifying key stakeholders is a crucial step forward on your way to putting a policy into action. Another important reason to identify actors is so the analyst can also identify the resources that actor has available to them. The list of resources identified by political scientists (material, symbolic, physical, position, information, and skills) satisfy motivations. # Key Players- One needs information about who might promote, oppose, or remain neutral about the proposed policy. Key players may also be organizations or alliances. Actors are differentiated by their policy positions. The degree of polarization is a function of the particular issue area and context of decision-making. # Motivations- Determine the motives behind key players behavior toward the policy issue. Are they part of a coalition or a voting block? Are there political trade-offs involved? Monetary gain? # Belief Systems- A key player's underlying belief system may be grounded in political ideology, religious beliefs, or professional experience. Understanding the underlying belief systems of key players may give insight into whether or not a particular policy alternative will be supported. # Resources- Key players use resources to gather support for their view and assemble coalitions. Resources are things like money, power, access to powerful individuals, or skillful lobbyists. # Site of Action- Fixing the site of action‚Äîor arena‚Äîprovides a reference point when discussing the actors, their motives and resources. The site of action may occur in a sub-committee, in a meeting with departmental heads, or at a meeting of a citizen's action group. = Analyze the data = Once the necessary information has been collected and an adequate description of the political climate has been provided, the analyst can offer an estimation of levels of support/opposition for the proposed policy. This includes identification of possible areas of political consensus and conflict, essentially determining what is necessary for the policy to gain the support for enactment and implementation. There are three key steps to achieving this. First, the analyst may have to make a series of judgment calls. Within this stage of judgment comes the challenge of policy design and the issue of compromise. When drafting policy alternatives the analyst must consider what kind of exchanges among actors will be necessary to garner the required political support to pass a policy. The most desirable form of compromise is one that does not greatly change the intended impact of the proposal, and is sometimes possible depending on the details of the proposal. Second, it is important to have the specifications of the current political environment for a specific policy area, and what alternative proposals may be currently considered. One must also know who the political actors are and how they may be likely to support a proposed policy. Lastly, it is important to consider policy and political alternatives to protect against political error. In shaping a proposed policy alternative, one must remain focused on the intended purpose of the policy, and be aware of the real political climate for which it is to be proposed. Political feasibility is often an essential criterion for ensuring the adoption of a policy proposal, however depending on the nature of the policy and the environment, alternative components of thorough policy analysis and decision-making processes are necessary to come to this stage of the policy making process.  Computer-assisted political analysis  In 1998, Harvard University professor Michael Reich introduced a prototype Windows- based software program for \\"computer-assisted political analysis\\" (CAPA) called PolicyMaker. PolicyMaker is designed to walk users through defining their desired policy, identifying the key actors, and determining the obstacles and opportunities in the policy environment. PolicyMaker then suggests strategies for making the policy more politically feasible and assesses the strategies' impacts on stakeholders. Harvard School of Public Health faculty, including Reich himself, have used PolicyMaker to teach a World Bank flagship health care course for policy analysts, as well as to train managers in health ministries and donor agencies. PolicyMaker 4 is available for free online .  See also  * Stakeholder  Further reading   John W. Kingdon Agendas, Alternatives, and Public Policies *Weimer, David L. and Aiden R. Vining, 2010.

It was built in the late 19th century by the local Ottoman bey, Ahmed Niyazi Bey. The Saraj's architectural style makes it unique in North Macedonia. The name \\"Saraj\\" comes from the Turkish word saray meaning \\"palace\\". The building is now home to a museum, a ceramic colony, a gallery, and a library. The local population of Resen municipality refers to the building as \\"Saraj\\". Description The Saraj was built in the neoclassical architectural style. The building is symmetrical with a taller central portion, which rises 35 m (114 ft), and two wings. It has a basement, a main floor, a second floor, and an attic, and has a floor area of 7,800 m2 (83,958 ft2). The building's exterior walls are to thick. They contain rich sculptural detail, particularly on the fa√ßade. The roof was originally made of wood but, during renovation in 1982, it was replaced with steel profiles. History The Saraj in the early 1900s Ahmed Niyazi Bey, a progressive and likely a member of the Young Turk Revolution, was the bey of the Resen area in the late 19th and early 20th centuries. The bey desired to have a French-style estate, perhaps after receiving a postcard of Versailles. Construction of the Saraj began in 1905 and the exterior of the building was completed in 1909 after the Young Turk Revolution. Everything else, including the interior, was not completed until a few years after the Balkan Wars and World War I in 1922. Ahmed Niyazi Bey, however, died in 1912 in Durr√´s of unknown causes and therefore never lived to see his estate completed. After the Balkan Wars, the Saraj served several different functions for several different organisations. It was first used for local administrative purposes under the Kingdom of Serbia, then under the Kingdom of Yugoslavia. During World War II, the building was used by occupying forces. After the war, it was used as the city hall of Resen and, later, as a city library. Finally, the Saraj became a museum and gallery, which it remains today. The building's roof has been restored twice since its construction: once in 1982 and again in 2005. =Current use= The Saraj today houses the Dragi Tozija House of Culture, the Resen Ceramic Colony, the Keraca Visulƒçeva Gallery, and a library. The Dragi Tozija House of Culture is a branch of the Museum of Macedonia in Skopje. The house of culture is also home to plays, literary readings, and other cultural events. The Resen Ceramic Colony, also situated in the Saraj, is a member of the International Academy of Ceramics of UNESCO. A permanent gallery containing many of the works of painter Keraca Visulƒçeva is also found in the building. A city library has existed in the Saraj since the 1940s. Today, it contains over 31,000 books.

History Order of Christ The first reference to this religious temple was attributed to Father Jo√£o Jos√© de Melo, then vicar and confessor for the municipality of S√£o Roque, between 1768 and 1783. As he indicated, it was erected in his birthplace, and dedicated to the locality's principal patron saint (Vincent of Saragossa), in 1746. The little hermitage's main nave was expanded and a sacristy added around 1967, while the presbytery was constructed new during the same public work. This expansion also allowed the construction of a choir (until then undeveloped), and allowed the addition of a belfry to its facade. As these projects continued, the religious administration acquired an image of the Immaculate Heart of Mary, while a crown was given as a gift for the same image. Owing to its relatively recent construction, during the 1973 earthquake, many of the local population sought refuge in the temple. A festival in honour of the patron saint is celebrated on the middle Sunday of July of each year. Architecture The temple is in a semi-rural landscape between various small residences, and consists of a single-nave church with belfry. Its frontispiece is a triangular pediment and belies its original smaller design, which was systematically enlarged to support its small congregations. The hermitage is distinguished by its lateral belfry, whose belltower is marked by a sculpted Order of Christ- like cross over a square opening and topped by a triangular roof.

Arthur Scott Evans (October 12, 1942 - September 11, 2011) was an early gay rights advocate and author, best known for his 1978 book Witchcraft and the Gay Counterculture. Politically active in New York City in the 1960s and early 1970s, he and his partner began a homestead in Washington state in 1972, then later moved to San Francisco where he became a fixture in the Haight-Ashbury neighborhood. In his later years, Evans remained politically active and continued as a translator and academic. His 1997 book Critique of Patriarchal Reason argued that misogyny had influenced \\"objective\\" fields such as logic and physics. Early life and education Evans was born on October 12, 1942 in York, Pennsylvania. His father was a factory worker, while his mother ran a beauty shop in the front of their family home. Evans graduated from public high school in 1960, afterwards receiving a four-year scholarship from the Glatfelter Paper Company in York to study chemistry at Brown University. Evans and several friends founded the Brown Freethinkers Society, a group of self- professed \\"militant atheists\\" working against organized religion, which picketed Brown's required weekly chapel services. The story was picked up nationally. As a result, the paper company canceled Evans' scholarship, and Evans contacted Joseph Lewis, president of the Freethinkers Society, and Lewis threatened the paper company with a lawsuit if the scholarship were dropped. The scholarship stayed in place, with Evans switching to a major in political science. Evans withdrew from Brown and moved to Greenwich Village in 1963, which he later described as the best move he ever made in his life. Evans was admitted to City College of New York in 1966, switching his major to philosophy from political science, and graduating in 1967. He afterwards joined the doctoral program at Columbia in philosophy, where he focused on ancient Greek philosophy while continuing to take part in protests. His doctoral advisor was Paul Oskar Kristeller. Career in writing and activism =New York City= He became politically active in the 1960s, participating in his first sit-in on May 13, 1966, when he and other students occupied the administration building of City College in protest against the college's involvement in Selective Service. He also participated in a number of anti-war protests, including the 1968 Columbia protests. In 1967, Evans signed a public statement declaring his intention to refuse to pay income taxes in protest against the U.S. war against Vietnam.‚ÄúNo Income Tax For War!‚Äù archived at Horowitz Transaction Publishers Archive He also participated in the protests at the 1968 Democratic National Convention in Chicago. While at Columbia, Evans joined the Student Homophile League, founded by Nino Romano and Stephen Donaldson, although Evans himself was still closeted. He was not at the Stonewall Riots in 1969, but they did fuel him into a \\"militant fervor,\\" according to the New York Times, and inspired him to join the Gay Liberation Front along with Arthur Bell. Within GLF, he co-created a cell called the Radical Study Group to examine the history of homophobia and sexism, with participants including Evans, Bell, John Lauritsen, Larry Mitchell, and Steve Dansky. However, he and others felt the group was not coherent and assertive enough, and also that it was diluting its effectiveness by focusing on issues such as racial discrimination and the Vietnam War. On December 21, 1969, Evans, Marty Robinson, and several others met to found the early gay rights group Gay Activists Alliance, with a more aggressive ethos than GLF and 12 starting members. Evans wrote the group's statement of purpose, as well as much of its constitution. Based out of New York, the group used methods such as \\"zaps\\" to draw attention to discrimination, confronting Mayor John V. Lindsay and demonstrating against legislation of the time, for example a regulation at the time requiring gay people to get approval from a psychiatrist before being allowed to drive a taxi. Evans was often arrested for the zaps. Although not yet out as gay to his family, in November 1970, he appeared on The Dick Cavett Show with other leaders Marty Robinson, along with Dick Leitsch of the Mattachine Society, making them among the first openly gay activists to be prominently featured on a national TV program. =Washington years= Withdrawing from Columbia in 1972, in 1972, Evans and his lover Jacob Schraeter left New York, purchasing a plot of forest in northeastern Washington state. Naming the land New Sodom and living in tents during the summers, Evans, Schraeter, and a third member formed the Weird Sisters Partnership group, named after the trio in Macbeth, a homesteading collective seeking self-sufficiency, with the group living off wild berries and vegetables. During winter months in Seattle, Evans continued research that he had begun in New York on the underlying historical origins of the counterculture, focusing in part on the sexual history of the counterculture. He published some of his research in 1973 in the journal Out, and later in Fag Rag. The Advocate also published a column written by Evans on the political strategy of zapping. =Years in San Francisco= When the Washington living experiment \\"failed,\\" he and his companion moved to San Francisco, and Evans in 1974 moved into an apartment at the corner of Haight and Ashbury Streets. Opening a Volkswagen repair business called the Buggery, Evans also began writing a book on homophobia and persecution in the Middle Ages. In 1975, he formed the Faery Circle in San Francisco. The gay pagan-inspired group was devoted to ritual play, and later influenced the Radical Faeries. Evans has described the group as bringing together \\"gay sensibility, neo-paganism, and a sheer Whitmanesque celebration of the body and of sex.\\" At 32 Page Street, an early San Francisco gay community center,http://tobyjohnson.com/arthurevans.html in early 1976 he gave a series of public \\"Faeries\\" lectures based on his research on the historical origins of the gay counterculture. In 1978 he published his recent research in Witchcraft and the Gay Counterculture: A Radical View of Western Civilization and Some of the People it Has Tried to Destroy, which analyzed evidence that many people accused of \\"witchcraft\\" and \\"heresy\\" during the Middle Ages and the Renaissance were specifically persecuted for their sexuality and ancient pagan practices. Published by the independent Boston imprint Fag Rag Books, the work considered, among other topics, early Celtic rituals and their connection with sexual traditions in gay culture. Historian Rollan McCleary has referred to the book as an \\"influential cult classic.\\" Others have noted the book's cultural import, describing it \\"less a history of persecution than it is an invocational litany or an aggrieved magical treatise on the failures of patriarchal liberalism and industrial socialism to adequately recognize and protect the lives of gay people.\\" Witchcraft and the Gay Counterculture was \\"an apposite resource on the history of social oppression.\\" where Evans argues that magic is an \\"inherently collective activity, depending for its practice on group song, dance, sex and ecstasy.\\" (A planned re-release with the title The Lady Rises in the East was never published.) A poem from the book was included on the 2014 album Why Do The Heathen Rage? by The Soft Pink Truth. Among other groups, Evans was involved with the Bay Area Gay Liberation (BAGL) and the San Francisco Gay Democratic Club. In the late 1970s, Evans became known for distributing his own satirical pamphlets under the nom de plume \\"The Red Queen.\\" The pamphlets, including one in 1978 titled \\"Afraid You‚Äôre Not Butch Enough?\\", satirized what Evans saw as a growing pattern of butch conformity overtaking gay men in the Castro neighborhood, presaging the \\"Castro clone\\" moniker.http://www.ebar.com/news/article.php?sec=news&article;=6041 Against the \\"hyper-masculine Castro clone identity\\" drawing men in during the disco era, he continued his research into faeries and male involvement in Western spiritual traditions. =Later writings and activism= With the onset of the AIDS crisis in the 1980s, Evans became involved with several groups, which converged into ACT UP/SF. He was once arrested while protesting the price- increases on AIDS drugs by pharmaceutical companies along with his friend Hank Wilson. He directed a 1984 production at the Valencia Rose Cabaret in San Francisco using his own translation of The Bacchae by Euripides, which features Dionysos, patron of homosexuality. The translation along with his commentary were published in New York by St. Martin's Press as The God of Ecstasy in 1988. He began work on a nine-year philosophy project in 1988. It was published in 1997 as the Critique of Patriarchal Reason subsequent to a grant by the San Francisco Arts Commission, including art by Frank Pietronigo. In the book he argued that misogyny had influenced \\"objective\\" fields such as logic and physics. As an overview of the history of Western philosophy, the book focuses on how \\"misogyny and homophobia have influenced the supposedly objective fields of formal logic, higher mathematics, and physical science.\\" Evans former doctoral advisor, Kristeller, called the book \\"a major contribution to the study of philosophy and its history.\\" He focused the book in part on the internal homophobia of gay thinker Ludwig Wittgenstein, and how Wittgenstein's conflicted attitude affected his thinking and logic. In his later years, Evans devoted much time to improving neighborhood safety in the Haight-Ashbury district. As part of that effort he wrote a series of scathing reports, \\"What I Saw at the Supes Today\\", which he distributed free on the Internet. Personal life In 1964 he became lovers with Arthur Bell, and they separated in 1971. In 1972 in New York he became romantically involved with Jacob Schraeter, and they spent two years homesteading together in Washington state. In 1974 they moved to San Francisco, with Evans living in an apartment at the corner of Haight Ashbury for the remainder of his life, although Schraeter returned to New York in 1981. Diagnosed with an aortic aneurysm in October 2010, Evans died in his Haight-Ashbury apartment of a massive heart attack on September 11, 2011. He was survived by his brother, Joe and his best friend Naphtali Offen.
