It stars Shep the Dog, Helen Badgley, and Arthur Bauer. The film is about a dog who loses his best friend, when a young girl is killed in an automobile accident, and focuses on his emotions in dealing with his loss. Well-received because of its \\"universally appealing\\" theme, the dog's emotions were reported as surpassing the child's histrionics. The film was shot on one reel by the Thanhouser Company, in total. It was shot in standard 35mm and a spherical 1.37:1 format. It was distributed by the Mutual Film Corporation upon release. Kitty Kelly of The Chicago Tribune called it a \\"miniature masterpiece.\\" Copies of the film are in the Museum of Modern Art of New York City and the National Film, Television and Sound Archive of Ottawa film archive. Plot The film opens with an inter-title that reads \\"Poor little rich girl has no one to play with\\" and cuts to Baby Helen with her doll, looking out the window. A group of children play Ring a Ring o' Roses in the yard. Next, Baby Helen goes to tea party set up on the yard and holds her doll, all by herself, with a lonely expression. The neighbor's dog, Shep comes out of his dog house and barks, and Baby Helen rises with a joyful expression. She takes a piece of a muffin and tosses it through the boxwood hedge separating the two yards. Shep eats the muffin and Helen invites him to her tea party. Shep runs along the hedge and passes through to join her. Helen instructs Shep with her finger and Shep barks in understanding, Helen takes her seat and shares a muffin with Shep. An inter-title announces that a week later, Helen is out on an errand. Helen passes through the hedge and skips down the sidewalk and Shep barks at her. As Helen crosses the street, she is struck by a passing automobile and Shep races to the rescue. He tugs at her dress at the waist and finding that he is unable to move her, runs to Helen's home and jumps against the screen door, barking repeatedly. As Helen's parents are summoned, Shep leads them to Helen, where a passerby has scooped up Helen from the middle of the street. All three depart and the scene changes to a dimly lit room with Helen laid on a bed, seemingly dead. Her parents watch over her, with sad faces as a doctor inspects her and folds her arms across her chest. Beyond saving, her parents bury their heads in the pillow next to Helen as the doctor pens a note. Then Shep is shown resting against the side of the door in a feeble and sorrowful looking position. An inter-title confirms Helen's death by announcing the parents have gone on \\"a visit to their lost darling\\". The scene cuts to a grassy cemetery with lines of tombstones separated by a loose line of two trees. Helen's parents approach her grave, marked by a group of flowers and a temporary marker at the head. Shep follows behind and pauses by a tree as Helen's parents kneel and pause to grieve. The camera cuts to Shep, who appears sad with his eyes only half open. After the parents finish grieving, they stand up and walk to the stage left. Shep stays under the tree for a moment before approaching the grave. Through an overheard split, Shep is shown to be reminiscing about the party. The next scene shows Shep back home, lying on his side in apparent despair. His master tries to get Shep to eat some food, but the Collie refuses and turns on his side. His master pets him, confused as to what has his pet troubled so, but he gives up and departs. Another inter-title announces that \\"Shep makes daily visit to the florist\\" and shows Shep approach the shop and grabs a bunch of flower in his mouth before running away. Shep returns to her grave and he drops his flowers with the others. Shep looks to the left and sees a woman watering the flowers. Shep takes her watering can and runs back to Helen's grave. The woman picks up the watering can and waters the flowers and picks up the flower bouquet brought by Shep. An inter-title announces that night has come and it shows Shep lying asleep near the hedge. A ghostly image of Helen, superimposed on the film, appears through hedge and awakens Shep. Helen leads Shep through the cemetery and to her grave. Shep crawls to her grave and lies across the flowers as Helen's form disappears down into the grave. The camera lingers on Shep before fading. The final inter-title of the film announces \\"Don't cry, it's only make believe\\" showing Helen, holding flowers and leaning against Shep. This sequence and title may have served as a reminder to children in the audience it was all simply a dramatic story. Cast *Shep the Dog as himself *Helen Badgley as Baby Helen *Arthur Bauer as Helen's father *Ethyle Cooke Benham as Helen's mother *Fannie Bourke as a visitor Production Child actress Helen Badgley, also known as The Thanhouser Kidlet, is described by the Thanhouser Company who made the film as a \\"precocious child actress who was very comfortable and expressive in front of the camera\\". Shep the Dog, also known as The Thanhouser Collie, was a well-trained animal performer who appeared in a number of the company's films during this period. The dog's acting, in portraying a range of emotions including \\"depression\\", \\"groveling pathos\\" and \\"joy\\", was noted to be superior to the child's performance. Shep was owned by the film's director Jack Harvey, but Shep had prior experience working for Vitagraph under Arthur Ashley. While at Vitagraph, Shep received very little coverage and recognition in comparison to Jean, the \\"Vitagraph Dog\\". Evidence suggests that Shep starred in Shep, the Hero. Jack Harvey believed Shep to be almost human, he would direct Shep entirely by voice and would speak to him with \\"man talk\\" instead of simple commands. At an unknown, but presumably later date, Shep's mate of four years, Bessie, became ill and Harvey saw it take a terrible emotional toll on Shep. When Bessie died, Harvey stated it would cause Shep to die of a broken-heart. While A Dog's Love was released little more than a month before Shep's death in early November 1914, two more films had yet to be released. Both The Barrier of Flames and Shep, the Sentinel would be released posthumously. Official musical accompaniment for works of this period were very rare and only one studio, Vitagraph, regularly made suggestions available to exhibitors. Thanhouser's musical scores were an exception in 1914, but the scores would only be created for the \\"Thanhouser Big Productions\\" such as Joseph in the Land of Egypt. In 1913 and 1914, cue sheets or musical suggestions could be obtained inexpensively through various industry sources and retained their dominance. Given that these cue sheets were prepared without any specific film in mind, the music would be chosen to match the themes of the film. The film was shot on one reel by the Thanhouser Company, in total. It was shot in standard 35mm and a spherical 1.37:1 format. It was distributed by the Mutual Film Corporation upon release. Release and reception Shep the Dog following the ghost of the girl through the graveyard The film was well received by film critics and even the passing mentions in The Moving Picture World remarked that it was a good offering with good photography. Jack Harvey's debut film as a director was well received by the public due to its \\"universally appealing\\" theme. Thanhouser writes that the \\"loyal dog's attachment to his little girl playmate is treated with pictorial beauty and simple, honest sentiment\\", and notes that when it was released on October 4, 1914, reviewers praised the \\"double-exposure passages for their dramatic effectiveness\\". Louis Reeves Harrison of The Moving Picture World review of the film stated, \\"This play becomes one of delicate pathos toward the end through some remarkable feats of double exposure, and it is one of beauty throughout because of the acting of a four-year-old tot, Baby Helen, a veritable star in her class. Shep contributes with exceptional intelligence - he is not eternally looking at his master out of scope for a word of command. ... I do not know what director handled this subject, but I suggest he apply his thought visualizations to the human characters of future stories. It is the exhibition of what passes in the minds and hearts of characters that brings an audience into closer sympathy with them and makes tense interest possible when melodrama merely brings a laugh. The double exposures are timed with such skill in this instance that all concerned in their production deserve high praise. They give beauty and dignity to a very simple story.\\" Kitty Kelly of The Chicago Tribune wrote, \\"Two more attractive artists never collaborated in a single production than this star baby and this star dog. Of them it is impossible to say which is the more so, though one demonstrates the maximum of naturalness while the other is an exponent of the maximum of training. ... As a general thing, I disapprove of the agonies of film mortality and its frequent projection of cemetery scenes, but this is one of the situations that must be handed the label 'exception'. ... The picture is a miniature masterpiece.\\" Contained within her review Kelly, also mentioned that baby Helen was placed in front of the camera so that even as she lay \\"dying\\" that she was still shown to be breathing. Kelly stated that no person would wish for a person to stop breathing for the sake of the film, but noted that it was not the best point of vision, but noted that the scene was well- managed. In Britain, The Bioscope reviewer agreed with other reviewers in finding the film to be, \\"...a perfectly delightful little film. Although it is true that its plot, what there is of it, contains nothing very new, it is not merely a conventional dog and child picture of the ordinary type. It is, rather, an exquisite pictorial fancy, charmingly conceived for the most part and charmingly executed throughout. ... The picture is perfectly done, and not even in the ghost scenes toward the end is there anything banal or insincere in it. A film so full of tender sentiments and natural beauty should meet with the warmest of welcomes everywhere.\\" Today, copies of the film are in the Museum of Modern Art of New York City and the National Film, Television and Sound Archive of Ottawa film archives. The film was released in Thanhouser Classics Volume II: Under the Mutual Banner 1912-1914. For the release, Andrew Crow composed and performed an original music score.

Built on Liverpool Road, it was a Commissioners' church and was demolished in 1951-52.Fleetwood-Hesketh, P. (1955) Murray's Lancashire Architectural Guide. London: John Murray; p. 160 The associated Sunday school building survives and has been converted into offices known as Gunn House. History Until some changes in ecclesiastical administration in 1839, St Matthew's was one of three churches that had been assigned a formal district within the parish of Manchester, which itself fell under the control of Manchester Collegiate Church. A further 23 churches had no such areas assigned to them. A proposal had been made in 1914 to merge the parish of St Matthew's with that of the nearby St John's Church, citing the transient and largely Roman Catholic population of the St Matthew's parish as a reason. This did not happen and, instead, St John's was subsumed by St Matthew's in the 1920s. Falling attendances due to the commercial nature of the St John's parish, and also a sense that there was some redundancy of provision given the proximity of St Matthew's, caused the Manchester diocese to review the situation, which resulted in a formal proposal of merger in 1927. The relative modernity of the St Matthew's building was among the reasons that influenced the decision. St John's Church was demolished in 1931.

Little Helen, Mayor Southwick's child, straying away from an automobile party, gets lost in the woods. She comes to the house where the boss holds his secret conferences, and he orders his housekeeper to keep guard over the child while he motors to the city. His plan is to hold the child until her father has signed the bills. Meanwhile, the housekeeper wanders away to a neighbor's, leaving little Helen locked in an upper room. But the child's devoted collie, who misses her sorely, already is tracing her. Shep reaches the house just in time to rescue Helen. A fire has broken out while she is locked in alone. He alarms the firemen, climbs a ladder to Helen's room, and, jumping through a skylight, leads the rubber-coats to where the child is. With little Helen safe, Shep leaps from the top story of the burning house into the fire net Reception The film was well-received critically. The Moving Picture World wrote on December 26, 1914: \\"The big feature of this two-reel picture is not the story, but the incidents and especially the work of Shep, a collie, that acts in an astonishingly intelligent way and is the center of both excitement and pathos. He is the means of bringing the rescue to the Kidlet, shut up in a burning house - very well handled scenes. It is the picture in which Shep jumps out of the second story window into a fire net.

Seven people were killed and 11 others injured. Accident The accident occurred when a 30-seater coach carrying a party of members of the York Municipal Employees' Guild and their families on an outing to Bolton Abbey from York suffered brake failure as it travelled down a 1:6 (9.5¬∞) (16.67%) gradient from Fancarl Top to the bottom of the valley downstream of Grimwith reservoir. It gained considerable speed and failing to negotiate the sharp bend at the bottom crashed through the parapet of Dibble's Bridge, landing on its roof. Many of the passengers were pinned beneath the vehicle, five being killed instantly, whilst two others died within half an hour. A number of other passengers were injured. Inquest A witness at the inquest described how a man from the coach took a stone from a wall and put it under a wheel, the driver then got out to \\"do something underneath the vehicle\\". Later the witness saw that the coach was moving, and it went down the hill at speed until it hit the right hand side of the bridge, before striking the left hand side and falling a distance of 16 feet from the bridge. One of the witnesses from the coach testified that the driver had said \\"the brake has been burnt out\\" before he hit it two or three times with hammer, and later saying \\"It's all right now\\". A motor engineer explained that the condition of the brakes was caused by the lining of the brakes being slowly burnt away. The brake lining and had been changed recently and this was only the second trip since. A consulting engineer who examined the coach after the accident said the brake drums were oily and in his opinion the primary cause of the accident was oil on the rear brakes and the burning of the linings on the front brakes. The jury returned a verdict of accidental death, and suggested that a sign be placed at the top on Fancarl Hill saying that heavy vehicles must change to low gear and advise the passengers to walk down; and that steps be taken to widen the bridge.

It stars Earl Schenck, Claire Whitney, and Percy Standing. The film contained newsreel footage of Kaiser Wilhelm and the Crown Prince Wilhelm as well as actual warfare scenes. Plot In pre-World War I Germany, Kaiser Wilhelm (Louis Dean) fathers a number of illegitimate children and sends them to various parts of the world to be reared by his loyal agents. Under the guardianship of Dr. Carl Von Strumpf (Fred G. Hearn), one of these children, Robert Busch (Earl Schenck), grows up believing that he is the son of wealthy German-American Richard Busch (Percy Standing), but in reality, Strumpf and Busch are servants of the Kaiser. When the United States declares war on Germany, Robert expresses his earnest desire to enlist in the American army, much to the delight of his patriotic sister Emily (Claire Whitney). Before he can do so, however, Strumpf tells Robert the secret of his parentage, believing that the young man now will be eager to fight for Germany's cause. Robert feigns enthusiasm but secretly offers his services to the U.S. government, and with the passport provided him by the Pan-German league, he goes to Germany and kills the crown prince (also played by Schenck). Next, he shoots the Kaiser and blows up the entire palace, thus sacrificing his life for the principles of democracy.

After that, the verses may vary. However, the \\"songs\\" of Grin-Olle and Skratt-Olle (\\"crybaby Olle\\" and \\"laughing Olle\\") are common. According to the Olaus Rudbeck's historical compilation Atlantica the song opens: \\"H√•, h√•, R√§fwen han l√•ckar p√• isen\\".

Film music The song was also used as film music for the 1987 film Mer om oss barn i Bullerbyn.Information at Swedish Film Database Other versions During the 20th century, Gullan Bornemark wrote two new lyrics versions of the same versions. Both of them were traffic-related, and appeared in her Anita och Televinken show. \\"Strunta i att g√• i v√§gen\\" (\\"Ignore going in the way\\") deals with, for example, not following after emergency vehicles like the fire truck during accidents not involving oneself, and \\"Hej, nu √•ker vi\\" (\\"Hey, let's ride\\") is a wintertime song arguing for the hillside being the best place to ride the toboggan or the pulk, as opposed to the road, which is made for motor vehicles like cars and buses.Information at Svensk mediedatabas Over the 2002-2003 Christmas and holiday season, a film from the Swedish Environmental Protection Agency about the greenhouse effect and global warming was often shown as a TV commercial. Depicting a fictional Knut's dance in the future, the participants were children, singing \\"R√§ven simmar √∂ver sj√∂n\\" (\\"the fox swims across the lake\\") instead of \\"R√§ven raskar √∂ver isen\\" (\\"The fox runs across the ice\\"), before throwing the Christmas tree out in the rain.

It was recorded in 1990 by Paul Kolderie at the Fort Apache Studios in Cambridge, Massachusetts. It was released by Toxic Shock in the United States and Musical Tragedies in Europe. The band's lineup had changed significantly since their previous release, Beat Until Stiff. Their previous bass player (Pete Foley) had left the band. He was replaced on bass by former drummer John Quinn, who was in turn replaced on drums by Chris Rossow. In addition, the band added a second guitar player, Kevin James, formerly of noise-rock instrumental band The Loving Six. James also produced the recording. The five original songs on the EP show that the transition started with Beat Until Stiff had completed, as band's sound had moved away from punk, more fully into the territory of grunge. The extra guitar makes for a much heavier sound, and the tempos are slower and songs longer that on previous releases. Nonetheless, the band continued to experiment with unusual song forms and odd meters. And the unusual instrumentation comes to the forefront: the song \\"Die Laughing\\" begins with a prominent, blaring trumpet solo, and \\"Curse of Civilization\\" features TQ on an extended sax solo as well. The record also includes a cover of Led Zeppelin's \\"The Rain Song\\" in which the organ parts are transcribed and played by TQ on saxophones. This record caused quite a stir in Europe due to its cover art. The cover was censored, but the Musical Tragedies label allowed consumers to obtain a sticker with the missing organs if they sent in pornography. The CD, released in 1991, includes all of Beat Until Stiff as well, plus Hullabaloo's cover of Deep Purple's \\"Highway Star\\", previously released on the 7\\" compilation single \\"Noise from Nowhere Vol. 2\\" on Toxic Shock.

History Originally, Wolverton Rugby Club was founded in the mid 1870s and carried on until the First World War. It was then left in limbo until some time after the Second World War. The Club was reformed on 22 January 1958 when the Scout Hall in Wolverton was hired for a mere 7/6d (37 V2p). A number of people attended the first meeting, thus forming the Wolverton Rugby Club. A committee was formed and three games arranged for the end of that season. Shirts were scrounged from various sources and dyed black. The next season, the Club had a pitch and posts supplied by the Council in the Wolverton Recreation Ground, with changing and bath facilities in the Railway Works Baths. Teas were taken in the Crauford Arms, which was also the Club's headquarters. Eventually proper black shirts with white collars were donated by Vice-Presidents after much fund-raising, and it was even possible to go away with fifteen players! (Previously, at one match, a coach driver and two spectators had to be dragged onto the pitch at Old Dunstablians to make up the team.) In 1965, Hodges Furze, the allotments at the back of Windsor Street in Wolverton, were leased by the Club from the Radcliffe Trustees, and Marstons brewery loaned the Club some money. The land was ploughed, seeded, mole drained and stones removed to make the new grounds. A second-hand hut was purchased and fitted up with changing rooms, bath, toilets and, of course, a bar. Jeff Butterfield was then asked by W H Weston, the President and former England International, to perform the official opening on 27 March 1968. At this time, Milton Keynes was just a village, but there were rumours of a new city being developed, so the Club had to think again. Jeff Butterfield became President, and held that position until he died in May 2004. The name of the Club was changed in 1974 to Milton Keynes in the light of the development of the new city, and a new ground was provided in Greenleys. Once again the Marstons brewery came up with a loan to build the current clubhouse with help from a sponsored run to Twickenham, where our lads were pictured on TV handing over the match ball for the All Blacks game in 1973.http://www.pitchero.com/clubs/miltonkeynesrugbyunionfootballclub/a/history-8889.html Wolverton RUFC changed its name in 1973 to Milton Keynes RUFC,Bucks role for rugby president Milton Keynes Citizen, 20 July 2011 based in Greenleys. In March 2006, Milton Keynes RUFC won the Bucks Plate against Slough RUFC who are in the league above. Milton Keynes went on to finish as runners up in the Berks, Bucks and Oxon Premier League and were promoted to Southern Counties North. The Club has over 400 members including a mini and junior section with players between the ages of 6 and 18.

The units were severely damaged during the Korean War but have since been restored to their former glory. Description of the buildings The east house was built in 1663 but later burnt down, and was rebuilt in 1888. The building served as the office of the deputy magistrate, where he carried out his official duties in the house. The east house is 21.8 metres long and 9.8 m wide and has a floor area of 213 square metres. The structure is supported around its perimeter by two rows of 40 thick columns with a corridor in between them. The inner-row columns are linked by screens, forming partitions that could be moved up to a height for the creation of a larger space. The inner corridor is flanked by a backed railing. The columns feature carved lotus patterns, and those at the four corners have tops shaped like a dragon's head. The inner house was the residence of the deputy magistrate.

Plot Job Dalton is the illegitimate son of star rocker Chris Dalton. He is attending a military school when he receives the sad news that his mother has died. Chris is on tour when the news of the death of Job's mother reaches him. A bit bored with his life and desiring to gain a relationship with his son, he decides to bring the boy on tour with him. To Job, who has only heard his mother's version of their relationship, and who views the military school as home, and aspires to a military career, his father's life and career are as foreign as life on Mars. What follows are lessons for both as Chris learns how to set limits, how to talk (and listen to) a teenager; and Job learns how to loosen up and enjoy life. They clash frequently on their way to understanding each other, but the denouement in the desert is moving and leaves the viewer feeling they're on the right track.

It is located on a prominent hill overlooking Lake Winnipesaukee in the town of Gilford, New Hampshire, United States. Although portions of the Kimball's original estate have been subdivided, much of it remains conservation land managed by the town. The subdivided portion on which the 2-1/2 story medieval-style castle stands is privately owned and no longer part of the Charlotte Kimball trust. Benjamin Kimball, a director of railroad companies operating in the region, built the castle and estate outbuildings beginning in 1894, and used it as his summer estate until his death in 1920, in his home in Concord. The castle was built by Italian stonemasons using local granite and materials imported from Europe; its construction cost was about $50,000. In 1960 Charlotte Kimball, Benjamin Kimball's daughter in law and last remaining heir, died and in her will donated the land to the Mary Mitchell Humane Foundation (an adjunct to the Massachusetts Society for the Prevention of Cruelty to Animals), to manage the property as a wildlife preserve and sanctuary. Over the next several years, the funds left to carry out the wishes of Charlotte Kimball went missing, and the Mary Mitchell Humane Foundation attempted to sell the entire estate. During this period, the property fell into disrepair and the buildings became subject to extensive vandalism. A group of concerned citizens, led by Sandra McGonagle, petitioned the New Hampshire Attorney General's office of Charitable Trusts, and an investigation into the missing funds ensued. As settlement of the lawsuit, the Attorney General and the Belknap County Superior Court ordered that the town take over as trustees of Charlotte's estate and carry out the tenets of her will. The town of Gilford took over as trustees in 1981 under the directives of the court and performed a study as to how best carry out Charlotte's wishes. The master plan recommended that the land be subdivided and a portion of the land, including the castle, be sold to a private party for commercial development with the intent that proceeds of the sales be used to replenish the missing funds and carry out Charlotte's wishes of managing the remaining land still held in trust. In 1990 the town and attorney general successfully had the non-commercial stipulation vacated allowing for the sale of the subdivided portion. The town established the Kimball Conservation Committee to oversee the use of those funds, and created a conservation area with hiking trails on the remaining of conservation land. Proposals have been made, but not acted on, to develop the castle into a resort hotel. Early 20th century postcard The castle and its associated outbuildings were listed on the National Register of Historic Places in 1982. The Lockes Hill Hiking trails are accessed via a parking lot and trailhead on Route 11. The 20.1 acres on which all the buildings stand is now private property and is posted with No Trespassing signs and is not open to the public. The castle has been condemned by the town of Gilford as unsafe, and the town has issued a make safe order to the owners requiring them to keep it fenced in until they raze the castle.

It is housed in a handsome brick Classical Revival structure designed by George Swan and built in 1900-01, with a major expansion in 1985. It was a gift from Benjamin Smith as a memorial to his parents, and is known as the Benjamin M. Smith Memorial Library. The building, one of the town's most architecturally sophisticated buildings, was listed on the National Register of Historic Places in 1984. Architecture and history The Meredith Public Library stands in the town center of Meredith, on the west side of Main Street opposite its junction with Lake Street. It is set on a rise, and looks over the southern end of the village commercial district. It is a single-story masonry structure with Classical Revival styling. The original main block is a T-shaped structure with a hipped roof and a slightly projecting gable above an entry recessed under a round arch. The building corners are pilastered, and there are bands of elaborate corbelling below the main roof. Windows are typically set in rectangular openings, with stone sills and keystoned lintels. The rear wing is less architecturally sophisticated, but with sympathetic styling. The building interior retains many original features, including panelled wainscoting, and Palladian carved motifs on arches separating sections of the interior. Prior to the construction of this building, Meredith's public library was housed in rented quarters.

Life and work  Hugo Marti grew up in Basel, Liestal and Bern. Initially he studied law, but in 1914 switched to German studies (literature and linguistics). His studies were several times interrupted by periods spent in Norway and Romania where he supported himself by working as a home tutor. He eventually obtained his doctorate from the University of Bern in 1921 with a dissertation on the language used in the Swiss Civil Code. His first job after this was on the iconic Pestalozzi-Kalender, a diary/agenda published annually for school children.http://www.kulturagenda.be/rubrik/worte/pestalozzi- kalender_bei_buch_uber_mittag/ In 1922 he was appointed to a Literary editorship with Der Bund, a daily national newspaper published in Bern. Here many of his more satirical contributions appeared under the pseudonym, \\"Bepp\\": Bepp's true identity became known only after the writer's death. As literary editor he was supportive of younger authors such as Friedrich Glauser and Kurt Guggenheim, and acted as a counter-weight to the famously conservative \\"Literature Pope\\", Otto von Greyerz Marti died at Davos, then well known as a health resort, in his 44th year from tuberculosis, with which he had been diagnosed in 1928.

The firm specializes in major public buildings, educational and research facilities, large scale residential developments, amongst other commercial and corporate projects. It was founded in Canberra, in 1999 by a group of professionals involved in the design and construction of Australia‚Äôs new Parliament House, and has since been involved in multiple urban design and master planning projects across the Asia Pacific.  History  Guida Moseley Brown Architects dates its origins back to the year 1999 when the core group of professionals who had worked together on Australia‚Äôs new Parliament House at Mitchell/Giurgola & Thorp Architects decided to restructure the firm to Guida Moseley Brown Architects. Harold Guida, the partner-in-charge of design co-ordination for the new Parliament House is a co-founder and senior partner of the firm. He received his Master of Architecture (Urban Design) from the University of California, Los Angeles, and had previously obtained a Bachelor of Architecture from Arizona State University.  Architectural Style  The modern Spence Wing entrance of the State Library of South Australia connects the Institute Building (1861, left) and the Mortlock Wing (1884, right) Guida Moseley Brown Architects is widely known for projects that respond to heritage and culture, whilst focusing on sustainability and functionality. The redevelopment of the State Library of South Australia in Adelaide by the firm for example, helped bring in light and a sense of space to a library that was previously considered as a ‚Äòclosed-in building‚Äô. The redevelopment helped open up the views to the previously visually inaccessible heritage buildings in the vicinity [refer to image]. The style was highly commended and celebrated by its stakeholders as the end result was a merge of indoor and outside environments alongside the preservation of the cultural heritage the library held. Similarly, the restoration of the Embassy of Sweden in Canberra, Australia is known for its noteworthy Nordic-style and ventilated substructure. The firm had replaced its worn-out floors with rare timbers that were hard waxed to provide a traditional Swedish ambience. In regards to functionality, the firm was responsible for the urban design and master planning of the new Passenger Terminal at Canberra Airport. The terminal was designed to a high environmental standard as the firm had aimed for the airport to be the greenest in the country. The project intended to delight and decrease stress amongst fellow passengers by articulating space and introducing purpose-designed furniture. The airport also integrated a new lighting scheme to aid its passengers. The entire project was designed, documented and constructed in less than ten months. Similarly, Guida Moseley Brown is currently also part of the Leh Airport project, in Jammu Kashmir, India. The existing airport is the 23rd highest commercial airport in the world (situated at 10,682 feet above sea-level). Named after an Indian statesmen and monk, and situated in between the Himalayas, the Kushok Bakula Rimpochee Airport is known for its challenging environment and scenic approach. Apart from ensuring that the new airport integrates the local cultural and spirituality in the airport‚Äôs architecture, Guida Moseley Brown also focused on the functionality of the airport as the surrounding area faces long winters and temperatures often being below zero. The construction of the terminal began in February, 2019 and is expected to finish by September, 2021. As of January 2020, 20% of the work is considered to be completed. As of recent, the firm has focused on futuristic themes and designs. The proposed Canberra Convention Centre ‚Äì Australia Forum has been dubbed as ‚Äòfuturistic‚Äô and ‚ÄòUFO like‚Äô in design. The design of the convention centre has brought in Guida Moseley Brown‚Äôs traditional concept of bringing natural light to the neo-futuristic undulated structure. The centre has an unlikely aerodynamic form to stand out as a hyper-modern element in the architectural landscape of Canberra. On 18 November 2018, Harold Guida spoke about the increase in the global interest of the \\"Univer-Cities\\" concept in a conference held at Nanyang Technological University, Singapore. The firm at the time was involved in the Campus Master Plan for the NTU. The master plan helped address issues such as the rise in student housing, environmental issues and sub-standard academic infrastructure. The firm ensured that the campus‚Äô immediate environment such as the established Chinese Garden values were incorporated throughout the entire campus via small group learning hubs and opening of the existing land- locked boundaries.  Significant Projects  = Completed Projects = Spire and the Australian Flag, New Parliament House, Capital Hill. In 1978, the Fraser government passed the proposal to build the new Parliament House on Capital Hill, Canberra. Out of the 329 entries that competed from around the world, Guida Moseley Brown (then Mitchell/Giurgola) was awarded the contract to masterplan, design, document and supervise the new Parliament House project. Construction commenced by 1981, and was inaugurated by Queen Elizabeth II on 9 May 1988. The project did not meet its deadline and was overbudgeted by A$800 million (final cost is estimated to be around A$1.1 billion to the proposed A$220 million). The design involved submerging most of the building under Capital Hill and mostly showcasing the huge spire that held the large Australian flag. In Tamar, Hong Kong, Guida Moseley Brown joined forces with Hong Kong architects, Rocco Design to design the interior architecture of the centrepiece Chamber for the Legislative Council of Hong Kong. Guida Moseley Brown designed the interior in a way to accommodate the external building form and architectural character of its surroundings. The surrounding buildings were designed in order to symbolize the unity of the diverse functions of the Hong Kong government, which is why Guida Moseley Brown extensively used glass and vertical lines to signify the independence, openness and solemnity of the legislature. Considered as one of Hong Kong‚Äôs iconic tourist attraction, visitors and tourists are known to take guided tours to learn about its architecture and work of the legislature. Guida Moseley Brown Architects were also involved in the project to build the Chongqing Science and Technology Museum project in Jiangbeizui CBD, Chongqing, China, built 2006‚Äì09. The museum cost 567 million RMB to build. It is on a plot of 37 mu and the building has a floor area of 45,300 m2. = Upcoming Projects = The Australia Forum is one of the most highly anticipated Australian projects of the decade. In 2017, the ACT government in its mid-year budget withdrew the funding for the preparation of a business case of the forum. Reports suggest that the figure for constructing the forum would cross A$900 million dollars (an increase of $417 million from the initially proposed A$433 million). At A$433 million, the centre was supposed to bring in a net benefit of A$2.40 for per dollar spent. Therefore, the following impact on the cost-benefit ratio could be one of the reasons behind the stall. The proposed 30-storey 343 Albert Street Premier Office tower in Brisbane was approved by the Brisbane City Council in March 2018. As of 2020, demolition of the currently occupied Suncorp Tower at 343 Albert Street is yet to undergo as constant alterations and appeals were being filed against the proposed tower. The Uniting Church in Brisbane complained that the building did not respect its relationship with the Albert Street Church by denying light to enter the church. In China, Guida Moseley Brown have been invited multiple times to submit their designs in bid to contribute to China‚Äôs rapid modernization plans. Guida Moseley Brown have designed several social and cultural infrastructure projects in megacities such as Chongqing and Suzhou. In Suzhou, Guida Moseley Brown along with the Suzhou Industrial Park Design & Research Institute are responsible for the upcoming Duke Kunshan University‚Äôs Library. The upcoming five-floored library is estimated to have a floor area of 15,000 m2 which will also be host to cultural facilities such as a hall, theatre and numerous other retail areas. The library architecturally pays ode to traditional Chinese forms through its large glass frame that‚Äôs fixed by strong stone elements. Chongqing Science and Technology Museum, a project of Guida Moseley Brown Architects.  People  As of 2020, the firm employs around twenty-thirty people, with four partners and four associates at the helm. Current partners and associates are: Harold Guida LFRAIA AIA, Paul Mutton RAIA, Sieglinde Whittle, John Guida RAIA, Jack Shimada RAIA, Andrew Donnelly, Brenton Bedell, William Gardner RAIA.  Controversies  Due to the 2014 shootings at Parliament Hill, Ottawa, the Australian Senate investigated their own security over at the Federal Parliament. After the investigation, the senate approved of a 2.6 metre steel fence to be developed and designed by Guida Moseley Brown Architects. While the entire security upgrade cost the taxpayers A$60 million dollars, the Australian Institute of Architects lobbied against the plan and suggested that it was \\"undemocratic and ill-considered\\". Canberra architect, Rodney Moss said that adding these fences will compromise the intent of the design which is the opposite to the way that the building was envisaged. In between the 2019-20 Australian bushfire season, Australian taxpayers had to pay out more than A$380,000 to replace a coffee cart with a new permanent caf√© at the new Parliament House. Out of the total bill of A$343,945.60, Guida Moseley Brown Architects pocketed A$38,900 dollars. The community had criticized how hardworking Australians were footing the bill of this excessive new coffee kiosk. There were even allegations of nepotism where the contract was favoured to the firm without involving any bureaucratic process.  Awards  Since its inception, Guida Moseley Brown Architects have been recognized with over 250 awards for its contribution to the field of architecture and design, both locally and internationally. In 2009, Mr Guida was bestowed the status of Life Fellow of the Royal Australian Institute of Architects, and was also awarded the President‚Äôs Medal in 2018. The firm has also been commended multiple times for its involvement and support to the environment and sustainability.

He is known for his 1967 song, \\"I Come Home A-Drinkin' (To a Worn-Out Wife Like You)\\", which was written as an \\"answer song\\" to his older sister Loretta Lynn's #1 1967 hit \\"Don't Come Home A Drinkin'\\". Childhood Willie \\"Jay\\" Lee Webb was born in a cabin on February 12, 1937, in Butcher Hollow, Kentucky. He was the third son and fourth child born to Clara Marie \\"Clary\\" (n√©e Ramey; 1912 - 1981) and Melvin Theodore \\"Ted\\" Webb (1906 - 1959), a coal miner and subsistence farmer. The family was poor, living hand-to- mouth, and relying on Ted Webb's meager income. The Webb family had seven other children in addition to Jay Lee: * Melvin \\"Junior\\" Webb (December 4, 1929 - July 1, 1993) * Loretta Lynn (n√©e Webb; born April 14, 1932) * Herman Webb (September 3, 1934 ‚Äì July 28, 2018) * Donald Ray Webb (April 2, 1941 - October 13, 2017) * Peggy Sue Wright (n√©e Webb; born March 25, 1943) * Betty Ruth Hopkins (n√©e Webb; born 1946) * Crystal Gayle (born Brenda Gail Webb; January 9, 1951) =Early adulthood= His mother called him \\"Jay Lee\\" from an early age, which he would later use in his career. He learned to play his father's guitar when he left school at 15. He often played and sang along with his father, Ted. Ted Webb died early of black lung disease as a result of years working in the coal mines of Van Lear, Kentucky. A year before his father's death in 1959, Webb left Kentucky and moved to Custer, Washington. He lived with his sister Loretta and her family. He sang in local honky-tonks with his guitar and played in a local performing circuit. Webb, like his sister, wrote his own songs, and he co-wrote some of her later hits. Career =Early career with Sun Records (1958‚Äì1960)= Webb was a keen guitar player and decided to write some short gospel songs with sister, Loretta. Having a tenor voice, Webb discovered gospel songs were well suited to him. In February 1959, sister Loretta formed her own band. Lynn called her band \\"The Trailblazers\\", and Webb played guitar. They performed all over Washington, and Lynn was beginning to build a small fan following. After Lynn won a contest in Tacoma, Washington, the prize was an invitation to Los Angeles. Webb, however, was not having as much luck. He continued to perform locally in the Pacific Northwest. On June 16, 1960, Webb was noticed by Sun Records producer and engineer Jack Clement, who was on a business trip. Clement invited him to a recording session to record two songs that Webb had penned himself; \\"Will You Come Home (Any Time Soon)?\\" and \\"I'm Waitin' For You\\". They were recorded on July 20, 1960, in Memphis, Tennessee, and released shortly after on August 5. The songs failed to garner any attention. Nevertheless, Jay Lee took the contract offer with Sun Records for $120 per week on August 10, 1960. \\"I'm Waitin' For You\\" charted at #92 on the Billboard Hot Country Singles charts and stalled there. Jay Lee continued to record for the Sun label but was not having much success. He moved to South Memphis in October 1960. In mid November 1960, Decca offered Webb a recording contract and a chance to record \\"Just A Little\\". He declined both the song and the contract. Subsequently, Brenda Lee recorded the song, and the single was released a month later. In the meantime, Webb learned to play the fiddle in two months and began playing and singing with another band in order to make ends meet.https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=G9Srs9FbjIQ =Career decline, and home life in Nashville (1961‚Äì1965)= Webb's contract with Sun Records expired on January 15, 1961. He continued to play his guitar, and co-wrote a few of Lynn's songs but was never credited for it. He also secured a contract with Wilburn Brothers Publishing Company and played on their TV show for $30 per week. He performed other country music singers' songs like Patsy Montana's smash hit song \\"I Want to Be a Cowboy's Sweetheart\\" and Kitty Wells' smash hit \\"It Wasn't God Who Made Honky Tonk Angels\\". His sister urged him to move to Nashville, and she secured him a contract with Vocalion Records in Memphis which he signed on April 19, 1961, for $50 per week. Jay Lee recorded one record, however, the label didn't want to record any more material with him. Thus, Webb breached the contract. He was then sued by the record label for $100. Webb went to court and won the case for $200. Webb continued to perform on the Wilburn Brothers' show as an unnoticed country singer; he was credited as a bubblegum pop singer which he disliked. He noticed that he had a honky- tonk style voice, and went into writing honky-tonk style songs. The contract expired on July 16, 1961. He left Memphis and went to Wabash to his mother and the family and worked as a nightclub entertainer. In August 1962, he moved to Nashville and played the guitar on many of his sister's records. He is mostly heard in the song \\"Before I'm Over You\\". Decca employed him as a guitarist on records, and he played the violin in some of Patsy Cline's records. As 1963 came, he helped to produce his sister Loretta's first album \\"Loretta Lynn Sings\\" and played the guitar for several of her records. Decca fired him on March 3, 1963, and he went back to singing in nightclubs. Webb's brother Herman moved in with him in Nashville in July 1963, and he went to singing in nightclubs like Webb. Webb secured a 2-month contract with Decca to record four songs (and release two singles with B-sides) on August 16, 1963. His sister became more and more notable by the day. Webb recorded two songs on August 24, 1963: \\"Lord, Are You Ever Returnin' (Home To Me)\\", \\"Your Photo (Is Hauntin' Me)\\". They were released on November 2, 1963, and \\"Your Photo (Is Hauntin' Me)\\" made #89 on the Billboard Hot Country Singles, but once again the songs were not a major success. He recorded two more gospel songs on November 15, 1963: \\"As Long As You Love Me\\" and \\"I'll Live (Without You)\\" and it was released on November 30, 1963. \\"As Long As You Love Me\\" made #90 on the Billboard Hot Country Singles. When his Decca contract expired on December 16, 1963, he returned to singing in nightclubs and earning a living off of his guitar & violin. He went to work in a diner for $70 a week, he performed with his guitar and his own compositions. He stayed there until March 1966. =Career recuperation and success (1966‚Äì1971)= In February 1966, Webb wrote \\"Lay Some Happiness On Me\\" and sang it to his sister Loretta Lynn. She told him he had a hit on his hands, and that he needed to get a record deal. He wrote more songs, they varied from honky-tonk to unmistakable gospel. He continued to sing in nightclubs, and searching for a record deal to record his songs. Loretta approached Owen Bradley asking him to sign her brother who had a hit song, and Bradley offered him a contract, which Webb accepted and signed on May 18, 1966. He cut his first single, \\"Lay Some Happiness On Me\\" on 27 May and it was released on 3 April 1966. It made #61 on the Billboard Hot Country Singles (his best so far). He wrote a few more honky-tonk style songs, including \\"Your Squaw Is On The Warpath\\" which became a famous song for sister Loretta Lynn. On October 12, 1966, he recorded two songs: \\"Ribbon of Darkness\\" (which sister Crystal Gayle later sung) and \\"Gotta Swim The Mississippi\\". It became a smash hit for him, \\"Gotta Swim The Mississippi\\" charted at #32 on the Billboard Hot Country Singles. He became a more in-demand act, and began performing minimum 10 concerts every 2 weeks. Brenda Lee approached him with a song, \\"Too Little Time\\", that she had recorded but wasn't a success (it made #123). He accepted it, and recorded it on December 28, 1966 along with \\"It's A Sin\\". He recorded \\"I Come Home A-Drinkin' (To a Worn-Out Wife Like You)\\" on March 16, 1967 for his album, I Come Home A Drinkin'. The revised lyrics to Lynn's song were written by Teddy Wilburn. The album was released on June 20, 1967, and it made #19 on the Billboard Hot Country Albums. \\"I Come Home A-Drinkin' (To a Worn-Out Wife Like You)\\" was released as a single on June 23, 1967, peaking at number 37 on the Billboard Hot Country Singles chart.

On August 28, 1969, he released his second album entitled \\"She's Looking Better by The Minute\\" which charted at number 13 on the Billboard Hot Country Albums. In 1970, he was on the road in concerts, performing in nightclubs and making semi-regular appearances on the Wilburn Brothers show. He was still writing songs, but didn't record them. His sister, Peggy Sue, recorded his composition, \\"All American Husband\\", which charted at #37. During 1971, he remained close to his sisters who all lived in the Nashville area. He recorded one more song, \\"A Whole Lot Of Nothing\\". On May 28, 1971, Owen Bradley asked him to record another song, \\"You Are The One\\" as a duet with wife Lou Anne. Webb and his wife recorded the song, and it was released a B-side single on July 2. On November 28, he recorded \\"My Favorite Memory\\" which was released on December 21.

He is a controversial Muslim imam of the Maliki school of thought . Academically he is a seated professor in the College of Sharia in the University of Tripoli since 1969 and distinguished contributor the Maliki school of thought with his numerous publications. His family originates from the village of Intataat near the city of Gharyan. Though he is often identified as a Salafist, al-Ghariani has often opposed efforts by Salafist militants to eliminate their opposition and force the creation of an Islamic state. As Grand Mufti and head of the Dar al-Ifta, the office in Libya responsible for religious rulings, his fatwas are not law, but they nevertheless exert an important moral force in government policy and decision- making. Sheikh Al Ghariani has become more prominent after the 2011 Libyan Revolution and subsequent civil war due to his widely supported fatwas against Muammar Gaddafi and public opposition to Gaddafi's rule on Al Jazeera. In June 2017, Sadiq Al Ghariani, was placed on a Terrorism watchlist, following accusation of links to Terrorism and Qatari backing for International terrorism in the 2017 Qatar diplomatic crisis. A number of nations, including Saudi Arabia, Bahrain, UAE, and Egypt are some who have issued this verdict. Background Al-Ghariani was born in 1942. He studied Sharia law at an educational institution in Bayda which is currently known as Omar Al-Mukhtar University. He graduated in 1969 and started teaching there in 1970. In 1972 he obtained a master's degree with distinction in 'Comparative Jurisprudence' from the Faculty of Sharia and Law, Al-Azhar University in Cairo, Egypt. In 1984 he received a doctorate in Arabic and Islamic Studies at the University of Exeter in the United Kingdom. In 1979 he obtained his doctorate degree in 'Comparative Jurisprudence' from the Faculty of Sharia and Law at the University of Al-Azhar, under the title (Alhukm Alsharie byna Alnaql wa Alaql) (Islamic Sharia ruling between Text and Mind). In 1984 he obtained another doctorate degree from the Arabic and Islamic Studies Department, the University of Exeter, Britain, titled (Iydah Almasalik ila Qawaid Alimam Malik) (Clarifying the methods to Alimam Malik's rules) by Ahmed Ben Yahia Alonshrese (investigation and study.)

Libyan Conflict of 2011 During the Libyan Civil War of 2011, he declared a fatwa for \\"jihad\\" against Muammar Gadhaffi during a televised address. Ghariani was later appointed as the Grand Mufti of Libya in February 2012 by the then Islamist dominated National Transitional Council. Following the fall of Tripoli Airport in August 2014, he stood against the attempted Coup d'√©tat he congratulated the Libya Dawn coalition, saying \\"I congratulate the revolutionaries in their victory, I give blessing to the martyrs\\" and keeping his support with the democratic elected government. In 2016, following the crackdown on the Islamist Shura Council of Benghazi Revolutionaries, he continued his full support for the fight against the rebels that attempted a military take over of the sitting democratic government. Political Career 2011‚Äìpresent As is natural in Muslim countries Sheikh Ghariani has been to have advising the Libyan public over the years since after the February 17th revolution calling for peace and unity in the country and warning the public about issues that affect their religious rights and freedoms including answering questions as a Mufti to give Iftas on complex religious questions, all of these responses are meticulously documented the website Tanasuh. Ghariani was observed to have supported the constitutional governments in Libya and apposing several attempts of democracy in Libya attempted by revolotionist Khalifa Haftar; and consistently calls for the unity of Libyans in the face of threats from ISIS/Daesh in Sirte, Benghazi, and Derna He is also a notable supporter of well known hardline Islamist Operation Libya Dawn. British media reported that he \\"faces possible war crimes charges for urging followers to overthrow Libyan government\\" and that he is currently residing in the United Kingdom, where he gained his doctorate in 1984., However this report was found to be incorrect and the Guardian later apologized and admitting that the source of the information was dubious. The Tanasuh TV channel was attacked on numerous occasions, with one incident involving armed men barging in and looting the recording equipment and sacking the broadcasting office in Libya. Reported by Libya Herald and a number of Libyan news outlets. Ghariani has also been observed to have contacted numerous political parties such as the Tripoli-based GNC requesting to hand over power to \\" the other body it chooses\\", implying that Ghariani has the status and power to declare the political future of Tripoli. - Lana News agency '22-07-2016' On 31 March 2016, Ghariani warned the Presidential Council (Libya) that the doors of jihad will open for at least 10 years if the presidency council under Seraj were to stay in Tripoli, and concluded by advising the Presidency Council to not arrive; and leave Tripoli. On 22 July 2016, Cleric Sadek Al Ghariani along with Misrata militia leader Salah Badi and former Islamist-GNC-regime prime minister Omar al-Hassi were found to have facilitated the orchestration of a pro-Islamic based protest against the Presidential Council (Libya) in Tripoli over the presence of French special forces that were recently killed in the downing of their chopper over Benghazi. The protest was initially planned to be symbolic as protesters along western coast cities from Zuwara to Tripoli have set fire to French flags. However the protest turned political as the protesters demanded the UN agreed upon Presidential Council (Libya) (PC) Headed by Fayez al-Sarraj to be dismantled or sacked and replaced by the more Islamic supreme revolutionaries‚Äô council. On 4 August 2016, Clerik Sadek Al Ghariani stated that the US airstrike in Sirte was illegal in a press conference, Even though it was requested by the UN agreed upon Presidency Council (led by Chairman Faiez Seraj based in Tripoli as the sole legitimate government of Libya). Ghariani has dismissed the anti-Daesh air strike as a political stunt for US electoral purposes in helping the democratic candidate Hillary Clinton.> He has likewise dismissed the presidency council as \\"illegitimate\\", coming very close to endorsing the Islamic State in Libya. He has also evidently attacked the RADA special forces in Tripoli (responsible for dealing with rampant crime and Kidnappings ) for \\"Carrying out crimes of arrest and seizure against Islamist Benghazi Revolutionaries\\" Ghariani claimed, who have been evidently linked to the Islamic State and terrorist practices via video prisoner confessions that the RADA special forces released.  Controversial Declarations  \\\\- Ghariani's conservative teachings have long been a subject of controversy, and he was criticized in late August 2014 by then Prime Minister Abdullah al-Thani with Quote \\"Ageing grey Mufti: has no shame in issuing political edicts\\" on 20 Oct, 2014, for issuing false fatwas and called on Libya's House of Representatives to remove him from his post. \\\\- In March 2013, Cleric Ghariani has issued a fatwa prohibiting Libyan women from marrying foreign men. He has also displayed strong opposition to the \\"UN Report on Violence Against Women and Girls\\" and has organised a protest with a number of Libyan women at the UN Headquarters that demanded Sharia Law, and has simultaneously issued a \\"fatwa against a UN Commission on the Status of Women's report because it urged governments to protect women and girls against violence\\". Meanwhile, there were also women who have protested in support of the UN commissioned document on Violence against women. \\\\- In February 2014 Al-Ghariani forbade opposition to the General National Congress which was refusing to stand down and hold elections. He called for its enemies to be \\"eliminated\\". \\\\- In April 2019 he called for a Hajj and Umrah boycott as a form of protest against Saudi government policies of ‚Äúkillings of Muslim brothers and sisters‚Äù.Libya‚Äôs Grand Mufti Calls On Muslims to Boycott Hajj and Umrah Mohammed Amine Benabou,Morocco World News, April 27, 2019 \\\\- In April 2020 Al-Ghariani declared on Libyan Al-Tanasuh TV that suicide bombings are permitted by sharia law.Muslim Brotherhood's Grand Mufti Of Libya Sheikh Sadiq Al-Ghariani: Suicide Bombings Are Permitted By Shari'a Law MEMRI, April 24, 2020  Opposition  Due to Ghariani's recent political endeavors in Libyan politics in such a crucial time of \\"the moulding\\" of the state of Libya, multiple reports emerged that he awaits arrest by Tripoli Militia leader Haithem Tajouri. Militia leader Haithem Tajouri ordered the \\"seizure of predominantly Islamic - Muslim brotherhood supporting - Misuratan Intelligence personnel\\" with support of Intelligence officers Opposing the \\"Islamic Domination of Intelligence apparatus\\" News agencies have thus reported on August 14, 2016. Leaflets have appeared in the streets of Tripoli reportedly showing \\" NO to the Muslim Brotherhood\\" with Ghariani's photograph marked with a red Denial symbol.  Tanasoh Tv Channel  The TV channel believed to be owned and supported by Sadiq Ghariani and his supporters and has been branded on numerous occasions as a radical Islamist propaganda outlet. Political subjects are usually discussed and often express inflammatory rhetoric. It is believed that the Tanasuh / Tanasoh TV channel was attacked in the past. The British government investigated Sadiq Ghariani for 'inciting Islamic insurgency' in Libya, which eventually led to his ban from the country. The Tanasoh TV channel, leniency towards ISIS and Ansar-Al-Sharia; Sadiq Ghariani and the sudden radical-Islamist surge in Tripoli and its domestic politics can be attributed to the very potential presence of the Muslim Brotherhood and the broad presence of a growing radical Islamist threat in Libya. Designation of Links to Terrorism On June 2017, following the 2017 Qatar diplomatic crisis, a number of nations including Egypt, Bahrain, Saudi Arabia, United Arab Emirates, Yemen, Maldives, Mauritania, Senegal, Comoros, Chad, Somaliland, and Libya's Tobruk government, agreed to designate Sadiq Al Ghariani as having Links to Qatari backed Terrorism sponsorship and terrorism related activities following Sadiq Al Ghariani's radical activities in Libya involving the spreading of radical propaganda and fatwas to the public inciting violence. The list has recently been expanded with more radical individuals from Libya such as Ali Muhammad al-Sallabi who is considered to be the leading member of the Muslim Brotherhood in Libya.

Vivaldi wrote the piece in the 1730s, a period in which he wrote two of his other works featuring the lute: the trios for violin and lute in G minor and C major. Movements The concerto is in three movements: #Allegro #Largo #Allegro The first movement is in a fast tempo and begins with a ritornello played by the violins and then repeated by the solo lute. According to AllMusic critic Brian Robins, the ritornello \\"contrasts a tuneful opening theme with a more lyrical motif in the minor mode.\\" During the movement, the solo lute plays melodies in contrast to the ritornello. The movement consists of several sections, almost all of which incorporate a portion of the ritornello melody. The second movement also consists of several sections. Robins describes this movement as a \\"reflective meditation by the soloist\\" against accompaniment by the violins and pizzicato bass. Robins praises the movement's \\"exquisitely simple shift from triple to duple meter.\\" The third and final movement is another fast movement in a 6/8 time signature which Robins describes as having \\"a bit of tarantella-like feel.\\" The soloist also has the option of playing the half notes in the movement using a more vigorous 12/8 time signature. Performance The concerto uses the lute primarily in a high register. The lute parts are written primarily as chords, and the lute player is intended to play arpeggios based on these chords. The piece also includes important parts for the violins. Today, Ben Salfield is one of the few lutenists to perform the concerto regularly in European concerts. The concerto is usually played on guitar. Yes guitarist Steve Howe performed the second movement on guitar on the band's 2002 live album Symphonic Live, into which he incorporated a number of improvisations. It has also been performed on guitar by more classical soloists, such as John Williams. The piece is also sometimes played on mandolin. The concerto is played on the Ontario Parliament Network and is performed by Canadian guitarists Liona Boyd and Norbert Kraft. It has become the channel's classical staple. Legacy In 2014, Vivaldi's lute concerto ranked #78 on the ABC Classic FM Classic 100 Baroque and Before countdown. In 2007 it had ranked #75 on the station's Classic 100 concerto countdown.

It is a celebration that has become a vibrant part of African American history and culture. As with other traditions, practices, customs and norms of African American culture, this ritual for dealing with death was shaped by the African American experience. History The history of the homegoing service can be traced back to the arrival of African slaves in America. Early during the slave trade, slaves believed death meant their soul would return home to their native Africa. They were not allowed to congregate to perform any kind of ritual for burying the dead because slave owners were fearful the slaves would conspire to create an uprising during any such gathering. Later, in an effort to control the slave population, slave owners introduced slaves to Protestantism to placate and subdue them. The Old Testament stories of God and Moses freeing a captive and enslaved race resonated with the slaves. The New Testament stories of Jesus and promises of glory in heaven and a far better after-life allowed slaves to forge through the turmoil of mortal life and look forward to the day when they would return home to the Lord. They fully embraced Christianity and death, for slaves, was viewed as freedom. Their death rituals were jubilant and it became one of the earliest forms of African American culture. At the beginning of the twentieth century there were few, if any black-owned or black-managed funeral homes. Survivors of deceased blacks were forced to depend on white funeral homes for embalming if they would even agree to service them. Jim Crow laws and white bias required blacks to enter these white funeral homes through back doors and basements, a degrading experience that added to the tragedy of losing a loved one. Although the embalming was mostly done by white funeral homes, the homegoing service took place in the black Christian church. The churches began forming burial societies to collect money for funerals. Black businessmen who opened funeral homes during the early-to-mid-twentieth century saw not only a business opportunity, but a way to help the community. Funeral parlors were among some of the first black-owned businesses and the black funeral director was a trusted friend and neighbor in the community. The tradition of the black community funeral director and the support of the black Christian church exists in many black communities today. Homegoing services A homegoing service follows many of the same practices as a funeral service. There are pall bearers and flowers and the service is typically held in a Christian church. But, because African-American Christians believe death marks the return to the Lord and an end to the pain and suffering of mortal life, the homegoing service is an occasion marked by rejoicing because the deceased is going on to a better place. A homegoing service usually contains some or all of these elements: * Musical prelude * Processional * Prayers * Songs (hymns of comfort) * Funeral readings (scripture - Old Testament and New Testament, poetry, prayer) and acknowledgements * Reading of cards and condolences * Reading of funeral resolutions * Obituary reading * Eulogy or tribute * Final viewing * Benediction * Recessional, and interment or committal A homegoing service is sometimes reminiscent of an African-American Christian church service. In addition to the eulogy, there is often a sermon and a choir that sings gospel hymns. The service often allows for friends and family to speak briefly about their remembrances of the deceased. Homegoing Service goers may experience both mourning and rejoicing.  References * Holloway, Karla. (2003). Passed On: African American Mourning, 3 - 19.

Casati is known for his work on chaos, both classical and quantum, being considered one of the pioneers of the latter. Casati is in fact principally known for the discovery of quantum dynamical localization phenomenon, that highlighted the relevance of chaos in quantum mechanics. His landmark paper, with Boris Chirikov, Joseph Ford and Felix Izrailev, is among the most quoted in the field. With Boris Chirikov, Italo Guarneri and Dima Shepelyansky Casati also discovered that quantum localization deeply affects the excitation of hydrogen atom in strong monochromatic fields. Further major contributions considered the connections between quantization of non integrable systems and the statistical theory of spectra. With the advent of quantum computing Casati and his coworkers studied the efficient quantum computing of complex dynamics.G. Benenti, G. Casati and G.

The expanding population of Manchester, caused by the onset of the Industrial Revolution, led to the foundation of several new churches there during the 18th century, among which St Mary's was one. St Ann's Church had been consecrated in 1712 and was followed by St Mary's in 1756. Others, such as St John's, were constructed in the next few years. The church was sited at Parsonage Croft, an area of land between Deansgate and the River Irwell that had for centuries been the property of Manchester Collegiate Church. It was constructed by the warden and fellows of the Collegiate Church, who obtained an act of Parliament for the purpose in 1753. The foundation stone was laid in the same year and the church was consecrated in 1756,. The living was presented by the Collegiate Church, who appointed Humphrey Owen as the first rector. The structure was a rather plain building in the Doric style and its architect received some criticism. It had a tower of around , topped with a lantern comprising eight Ionic pillars on which stood a spire. This was the tallest structure in Manchester at the time and not without problems. The top of the spire was damaged in a storm in 1824 and truncated some time afterwards; in 1854, it was removed entirely. Initially within the parish of Manchester, St Mary's became a parish church in its own right on 29 March 1839. Affluent congregations generally dwindled as the centre of Manchester became increasingly a commercial area. The last regular service at the church was held in December 1887 and it was closed after a service on 4 October 1890, when the extent of dilapidation was such that the last rector, Richard Tonge, had to pause his service temporarily because the copy of the Bible that he was using was missing some pages. The building was demolished in 1891 and the adjacent Parsonage House, once home to Thomas La Warr, suffered a similar fate in 1897. The site of the two buildings, now known as Parsonage Gardens, is now an open space and designated conservation area in the city. Some of the church plate, including some chalices, patens and an almsdish, was transferred to St Ann's.

Background Mosul Dam was captured by ISIL militants on August 7, 2014, after Kurdish forces retreated from the area, following a series of battles in the region. Some American officials described the fall of the dam as a grave concern, because it could release a wave of water if it was destroyed, threatening towns and cities downstream. Following these recent developments, Kurdish forces, Iraqi forces, and the U.S. Air Force launched a counter- offensive to retake the dam. Also of ongoing grave concern was/is the fact that Mosul Dam (formerly Saddam Dam) was constructed on evaporite rocks of the Miocene Fars (Fatha) Formation, which are water-soluble. As a result, the reservoir behind the dam was not filled to capacity. A continued regimen of pumping concrete grout into potential leaks meant that a long term interruption of remedial works could end in a reduction of structural integrity and disaster. Events On August 16, the U.S. Air Force launched air strikes on ISIL positions near the dam, destroying some of their equipment. Kurdish forces also launched attacks against ISIL on the same day, shelling their positions near the dam, and opening up the possibility for a ground attack. A Kurdish commander, Major General Abdelrahman Korini, told AFP that Peshmerga forces had captured the eastern side of the dam and were \\"still advancing.\\" Rudaw, a Kurdish news organization, said the airstrikes appeared to be the \\"heaviest U.S. bombing of militant positions since the start of airstrikes\\" against ISIL last week. At least 11 ISIL fighters were killed by the airstrikes. On August 17, the fighting continued. Kurdish officials said that peshmerga forces captured three towns near the dam: Tel Skuf, Sharafiya and Batnaya. The U.S.-led coalition had until that day conducted nine airstrikes and destroyed or damaged four armoured personnel carriers, seven armed vehicles, two Humvees and an armoured vehicle. ISIL militants tried to slow down Kurdish forces with explosive devices, including homemade bombs and land mines. On August 18, Iraqi and Kurdish forces said that they had taken full control of the dam. US President Barack Obama also confirmed that the Mosul Dam was under complete Kurdish and Iraqi control. He also said that the move to recapture the Mosul Dam was a \\"major step forward\\" in the long-term strategy to defeat the militants. Journalists in the area reported that the fighting had not completely ended. On August 19, the battle ended completely, with a Kurdish-Iraqi victory. BBC reporter Jim Muir, who has visited the dam, said it was \\"back in safe hands\\" and appeared intact.

It is the largest of several granitic inselbergs in the region's Doi belt. History The Gogollis Qabe or Gogoshiis Qabe (\\"the furnished place\\"), a local rock shelter, is the seat of the first professional excavation in the country.Peter Robertshaw, A History of African archaeology, (J. Currey: 1990), p.103. In 1935, Grazioni found a Middle and Later Stone Age archaeological sequence here. The ancient implements belonged to the Somaliland Stillbay culture typified by points and scrapers produced through flat percussion flaking. J.D. Clark a decade later excavated a nearby site, the Gury Waabay (\\"the poisonous house\\"), located around half a kilometer to the north. In the 1980s, Brandt also excavated the granitic inselberg, uncovering a top level Holocene layer. Fourteen burials were found therein, which constitute the earliest chronometrically dated burials from the Horn of Africa and contain the earliest definitive grave artefacts in the wider region. A lower layer was likewise associated with the Stone Age Eibian (Doian) industry. Another local rock shelter is referred to as Abka Eeden I Oboy Haawo (\\"Adam and Eve's court\\"). In addition, several rock formations in the area feature cave art. Buur Heybe historically served as a key religious and political hub. According to oral tradition in the Doi (\\"red soil\\") belt, several dynasties were based in the town. The Eyle aver that the area was at various times invaded and occupied by a succession of early Cushitic settlers, the Jidle, Maadanle and Ajuran, whom they each managed to defeat. A number of ancient burial sites dated from this pre-Islamic period sit atop the mountain's peak, and are a center of annual pilgrimage (siyaro). A trench near the holy places is said to serve as a passage toward heaven (siraad), and as such is off-limits to individuals possessing a nefarious past. These burial sites on the mountain's summit were later made into Muslim holy sites in the ensuing Islamic period, including the Owol Qaasing (derived from the Arabic \\"Abdul Qaasim\\", one of the names of Prophet Muhammad) and Sheikh Abdulqadir al-Jilaani (named for the founder of the Qadiriyya order). Additionally, the area is a center of pottery production. The Bur Ecological and Archaeological Project, established in 1983, uncovered hundreds of sherds from the site and other rock shelters. Oral tradition suggests that the Eyle were the first people to make pottery in Buur Heybe. Demographics Buur Heybe is today primarily inhabited by the Eyle, a sub-clan of the Rahanwayne of agropastoralists, potters and part-time hunters. Their ethnonym translates as the \\"hunters with dogs\\". The Eyle are believed to be remnants of the aboriginal San hunter-gatherers who inhabited southern Somalia prior to the arrival from the north of Afro-Asiatic populations of the Cushitic branch. Buur Heybe is consequently also known as Buur Eyle (\\"Eyle mountain\\"), in recognition of the first inhabitants in the surrounding villages of Howaal Dheri, Berdaale and Muuney.

He was a prominent social-political activist, an independent thinker who endured to improve the positive and constructive aspects of Sri Lankan Politics. The Thero was born on 29 May 1942, the Vesak day at the village of Maduluwewa in Padukka, Homagama as Pathirage Don Rathnasekara. He received his primary education at Maduluwawe Maha Vidyalaya and began to live in the temple age of 11 in Padukka, under the guidance of his uncle, the head monk.

Thero was one of the most important leaders of the anti-Indian intervention campaign in the late 1980s as well. He was an excellent orator in mobilizing the Sri Lankan populace across the spectrum.

Bibliotheca is a five-volume version of the Bible created by Adam Lewis Greene published in 2016. It was funded in mid 2014 through a thirty-day Kickstarter campaign for which Greene set a goal of $37,000, but the campaign raised over $1.4 million. Greene's aim, as detailed in his Kickstarter campaign video, was to enhance the experience of reading biblical literature by giving the content a more novel- like form, omitting chapter and verse numbers and annotation, utilizing a sewn binding and opaque book paper (rather than Bible paper), and creating original typefaces optimized for legibility, among other features.  Translation  Bibliotheca features a translation referred to as the American Literary Version (ALV), a new recension of the American Standard Version (ASV). (The ASV was published in 1901 as a revision of the King James Version.) The revisions in the ALV pertain mainly to the elimination of Jacobean grammar and vocabulary in the ASV (e.g., ‚Äúthou‚Äù and ‚Äúdoth‚Äù), which had been retained from the KJV. After the text had been edited for style, Greene enlisted a group of seven biblical language experts from Oxford, Fuller, Wheaton, Emory, and other reputable institutions to review the text (among them were noted scholars Brent A. Strawn and David A. deSilva) and invited them to make suggestions in light of lexical developments since the publication of the ASV. A project update from Greene in April 2016, featuring a note from deSilva, implies that critical changes were indeed made to the text: ‚ÄúWithout damaging the literary quality of the base translation,‚Äù writes deSilva, ‚Äúwe were able to suggest many changes that would bring the translation up to par with where textual criticism and Greek lexicography currently stand, not to mention alert Adam to a few all-out mistranslations of the original Hebrew and Greek in the ASV (every translation has them).‚Äù  Miscellaneous  Because the text of Bibliotheca is spread across five volumes, it was possible to utilize a thicker, more opaque paper than the thinner, more translucent paper typical of most Bibles. Bibliotheca has several features in common with The Books of the Bible (published by Biblica in 2007), which separates the text of the Bible into separate volumes and does not have chapter or verse numbers. However, The Books of the Bible does not include the Apocrypha, nor does it have the same level of production and design quality found in Bibliotheca (e.g. Despite being available in multiple volumes, The Books of the Bible, like traditional Bibles, still features Bible paper, does not have a sewn binding, has narrow margins, and is typeset with a comparatively utilitarian typeface and page layout). After Greene's 2014 Kickstarter project, evangelical publisher Crossway Books (a division of Good News Publishers) began work on their own high-quality multi-volume Bible set and produced a product similar in style and concept, which was published on October 31, 2016, just weeks before Greene began shipping his final product. However, Crossway's similar product could be viewed as less ecumenical as it does not include the Apocrypha.

After a huge number of such measurements the data is then examined to find all of the possible deformations of the circles, and more importantly, the non-moving points on them where the original circle and the deformed ellipse intersect (at four points per circle). By mapping these points over the entire body, a series of lines are produced.

Description Taqbil in Arabic literally means Kissing. In Hadhramaut, the Sayyid people receive gestures of respect from the rest of population in recognition of their descent from Muhammad. These gestures include the method of greeting, in which their hand (usually right hand) is kissed and/or sniffed. This hand-kissing is performed even when the recipient is still a child or a person without any special distinction in terms of religious knowledge or piety, in recognition of the nobility of the bloodline rather than the merits of the particular individual. This tradition of Taqbil was called Shamma in Hadhramaut. In the nineteenth and twentieth centuries, some members of the Sada continued to put forth justifications for their special treatment. One of the prominent jurisprudents at the time, Abdurrahman bin Muhammad al-Mashhoor addressed the matter of the special status of the Sada in Hadhramaut. He asserted that \\"the descendants of the Prophet were the most favored of people, and the descendants of 'Alawi the most favored of them all\\" because of religious learning and practice, their high moral standing, their blessedness and their piety. In response to a question as to the correctness of the practice of kissing the hands of Sada, he asserted that it was correct according to Shafi'i authorities. The tradition currently is no longer common among Hadhrami, except when a person greets a respected Sayyid out of paying respect to his knowledge-ability or piety (such as to a Habib or a Shaikh) .

Despite his position in the Anglican church, for which he served as rector of St John's Church, Manchester from 1769 until 1831, he was a noted disciple of Emanuel Swedenborg and did much to propagate his ideas in the Manchester area.  Early life  John Clowes was born in Manchester on 20 October 1743 and baptised on 17 November of that year at St Ann's Church in the town. He was the fourth son of a barrister, Joseph Clowes, and Catherine (n√©e Edwards), who father may have been curate at Llanbedr in North Wales. Although his mother died when he was less than ten years old, it was she who encouraged an understanding of religion and that encouragement was continued by his father after her death. Clowes was educated at an academy run by John Clayton in Salford and may also have gone to a grammar school in the same area. He was admitted to Trinity College, Cambridge, in 1761 and graduated with a B.A. degree in 1766, having been taught by Richard Watson, who later became bishop of Llandaff.  Career  The young Clowes suffered from poor health and uncertainty about his future career. He had intended to become a lawyer like his father but changed his mind and in 1767 was ordained by Richard Terrick. He had commenced teaching as a private tutor on going down from Trinity but had to abandon that in 1769 because of his health. In that year he proceeded to the degree of M.A. and was elected to a fellowship at the college. He had turned down the offer of the living of St John's Church in Manchester which had been made to him by his relative Edward Byrom, who was also founder of the church. However, on 13 August 1769 he accepted the position and remained there until his death despite being offered a bishopric by William Pitt the Younger in 1804. Clowes had had some doubts regarding his vocation and had been reading the works of various thinkers, such as William Law, when in 1773 he was introduced to the thoughts of Swedenborg and to the efforts of Thomas Hartley, the first translator of Swedenborg's works into the English language. From then on, and despite doubts regarding whether he could remain an Anglican cleric whilst doing so, Clowes followed the Swedenborgian path. He preached that doctrine in his church and also in twice-weekly meetings, as well as in field-meetings addressing the factory workers of nearby towns. In 1778, Clowes established an early English Swedenborgian Society in Whitefield, near to Manchester. This was supported mainly by rich cotton manufacturers and became known as the Society of Gentlemen. Its early purpose was to counter the movement spearheaded by Robert Hindmarsh that sought to create a Swedenborgian New Jerusalem Church that was entirely separate from the Anglican Church. Clowes was vehemently and very vocally opposed to any split. Known as the Manchester Printing Society from 1801, it also disseminated the works and ideas of Swedenborg. Despite being involved in many controversies relating to his beliefs, including disputes with other Anglican clergymen and a referral to his bishop, Clowes was able to retain his position as rector of St John's and was appointed chaplain to the Manchester Volunteers. His 50th anniversary at the church was marked with a portrait painted by John Allen and by the installation there of a bas-relief sculpture by John Flaxman, who was both a friend and a Swedenborgian.  Published works  Clowes translated five of Swedenborg's books, the first being Vera Christiana Religio in 1781. These and other writings by him, such as pamphlets and sermons, were published by the Manchester Printing Society. The society records for 1828 showed that nearly 200,000 copies had been printed. Those works included The Miracles of Jesus Christ, published by J. Gleave of Manchester in 1817, and Letters to a Friend On The Human Soul, a second edition of which was published by J. S. Hodson of London in 1846. His Religious Instruction for Youth (1812) brought together in a single volume many of his earlier publications aimed at children.

Description The term was coined by the local news site West Side Rag in August 2013, where it was used to describe a new development on the Upper West Side of Manhattan that had separate entrances for the more-expensive market-rate and affordable- housing tenants.West Side Rag: New UWS Development Could Have Separate Entrance For Poorer People  News  West Side Rag, accessdate: 02/02/2015 While the expression \\"poor door\\" refers to separate entrances and lobbies, in practice, income-segregated buildings may also have \\"gyms, spas, elevators, rooftop gardens, storage areas, and playrooms\\" that only the high-income tenants can use. The practice, which may also include trash and mail services or parking facilities, has been criticized for segregating the rich from the poor. Oliver Wainwright, writing in The Guardian in July 2014, presented a more nuanced view, commenting that such attempts at segregation are not new, and that there would not be the same outrage if the housing was in separate buildings, nor would social housing tenants wish to pay the high service charges needed to provide the luxurious facilities sought by wealthier tenants. He quoted Michael Edwards, senior lecturer at the Bartlett school of planning at University College London, who said: \\"they [poor doors] are a symptom, not the problem\\".theguardian.com: 'Poor doors': not the worst thing about social housing  Art and design, access-date: 23/08/2014 Gentrification A 2014 investigation by The Guardian noted a growing trend in London to have a separate entrance in new housing developments. Legislation requires that new blocks in many locations must include an element of \\"affordable housing\\" if they are to gain planning permission, and it has become more common for such developments to include a separate entrance for those tenants, nicknamed a \\"poor door\\". The Mayor of London at the time, Boris Johnson, ruled out a ban on \\"poor doors\\", but said he would \\"discourage their use whenever possible\\".The Guardian: Boris Johnson rules out 'poor door' ban on London housing developments  Society  The Guardian, access-date: 23/08/2014 A campaign spokesperson for Sadiq Khan, who has proposed a poor door ban, says that affordable housing homes should sit beside private rental dwellings and homes, and there should be a \\"tenure blind\\" approach, in which a person walking through a neighbourhood should not be able to determine which housing is affordable or not based on the quality, type, or location of their doors and entrances, all with the goal of building \\"social equality and dignity\\". =Kensington= A social housing resident who lives in a London building with poor doors states that her children cannot use the communal garden built for the market-rent tenants, as it has a separate key, and the main social housing door is near the garbage bins. A market rent tenant in Kensington told LBC radio that she pays ¬£15,500 per year for service charges in her building, so she would not live in a building where social housing tenants got these same services for free. =Camden= Dave Hill from The Guardian states that Camden, which has its housing policy run by Labour, does not \\"generally seek to mix affordable and market[-priced] dwellings on the same corridors or sharing the same stairs, lifts and entrance lobbies\\", because the service charges and management charges for shared communal spaces can be a \\"significant proportion of housing costs\\" which may be \\"too high for the occupiers of affordable housing to pay\\". Hill states that the \\"wealthy and the least well-off having separate entrances into the same housing block may offend but can also be a pragmatic way of improving the supply of ‚Äúaffordable‚Äù homes.\\" =Lambeth= In late March 2019, the Guardian broke the news about segregated play areas created by Henley Homes on the Lilian Baylis Old School site in Lambeth. Henley diverged from the scheme that had been given planning approval, by erecting fixed hedges rather than gates, so children in the rented housing could look down on the central play area but not use it. They were allocated a small strip of grass on the periphery of the site. Some of the children on both side of the poor/rich divide went to the same primary school but couldn't play together. There was vociferous criticism from both owners and tenants, and the planning authority. Politicians such as Jeremy Corbyn (Lab) and James Brokenshire (Con) have condemned Henley. The day after the story broke, Henley Homes issued a statement saying it had been a misunderstanding; all children were welcome to use the communal area including those from the social housing in Wren Mews. United States In August 2014, The Independent noted that the \\"poor door\\" trend had spread to Washington DC, with an apartment complex at U and 14th Streets set to be redeveloped, with all of the social housing tenants put in a separate wing, accessed from a different street.The Independent: 'Poor door' controversy extends to Washington DC as affordable housing 'wing' given entrance on different street - next to the loading bay - Americas - World - The Independent, access-date: 23/08/2014 A 28 July 2014 episode of The Colbert Report included an item about poor doors. Bill de Blasio, mayor of New York, has indicated that he will ban them.Newsweek: Bill De Blasio Seeks to End New York City's 'Poor Doors'  Newsweek, access-date: 02/02/2015 The London Evening Standard reported on 29 August 2014 that the Manhattan apartment block at 40 Riverside Boulevard had been split into two with apartments costing up to $25 million facing the Hudson River and cheaper apartments let at $800 and $1,100 per month in a smaller attached building with a separate entrance. Manhattan Borough president Gale Brewer was reported to have claimed that \\"The two door system is an affront to New Yorkers' belief in fairness and diversity in our city.\\" The Standard explained that the practice had become possible during the administration of former New York mayor Michael Bloomberg who had changed the city's zoning rules to allow developers to build larger buildings than normally allowed in a zone as long as they build a quantity of social housing too.\\" 'Poor doors' open row over social housing\\", Michael Howie, London Evening Standard, 29 August 2014, p. 34. In 2013, journalist Josh Barro argued in defense of poor doors in an article in Business Insider. He calls criticisms of poor doors \\"absurd\\" and states that integrating low-income tenants into new luxury buildings via inclusionary zoning, which he says triggers builders to create poor doors, should be replaced with development fees and taxes that would enable the city to build more affordable housing at a lower-cost location. Philip Rojc calls the expression \\"poor doors\\" a \\"misleading label\\" in cases where a developer has built two distinct buildings and states that two doors might be the \\"price we pay to integrate neighborhoods\\" and a way to avoid the awkwardness of having well-to-do and poor families directly together; as well he says having two doors is better than continuing to locate affordable housing in \\"vast under-served neighborhoods\\". Architect and author Michael Sorkin from Nation magazine states that the \\"distinction between [having] two entries...is exceedingly fine, even ridiculous\\", and says the two doors approach is a \\"byproduct of the city's inclusionary zoning law\\", which is designed to produce affordable housing. Sorkin says that \\"inclusionary zoning laws are among the few tools left to ensure the creation of affordable housing\\". Matt Yglesias states that the \\"fury over something as superficial as a building entrance is a waste of time\\" and says that the \\"real victims\\" of the inclusionary zoning policy in new luxury buildings are not the families who win the housing lottery and \\"enjoy discount rent\\" in a new building downtown (albeit with a \\"poor door\\"); it is \\"every economically struggling New Yorker who doesn't get the discount\\". As well, Yglesias states that this inclusionary housing policy is only a form of tax on the rich people within new luxury buildings; rich people in houses, older condos, old lofts, and so on are not \\"taxed\\" to provide affordable housing under this system. Canada In Vancouver's West End, a 30-floor condo will have a \\"poor door\\" for social housing residents and a regular door for the condo purchasers. The condo, which will also have separate play areas for the children of social housing tenants and condo owners and separate lobbies, led to concerns from housing officials about stigma and isolation of the lower-income residents. Owners of buildings that have two different entrances for high-income and needy tenants argue that this means that low- income residents do not have to pay for the costs of hiring a concierge in the side for affluent tenants. In April 2019, controversy over this development lead the city to study the possibility of banning poor doors. In Toronto, both \\"poor door\\" residences are operated by Artscape, a not-for-profit real estate company. Artscape Triangle Lofts, built in 2010, is on the lower floors of a condominium in the Queen Street West area. It maintains a separate entrance for artists, with an unfinished lobby and units. The executive vice president, Celina Smith, described the separation as an \\"asset\\", separating the artists from their neighbours. For the Artscape Bayside Lofts, built in 2019, artists will use a separate entrance and will not have access to the building's facilities, including the pool. The subsidized units are owned by the City of Toronto, and managed by Artscape. The lobby and units are finished separately at lower cost by the city.

Statistics  The Apostolic Vicariate extends its jurisdiction over the Catholics of the Latin Rite of all Syria, as per 2014 pastorally serving 13,000 Catholics in 10 parishes and 6 missions with 38 priests (religious) and 243 lay religious (46 brothers, 197 sisters).  History  From the early decades of the seventeenth century some religious orders, particularly the Order of the Friars Minor Capuchin, the Carmelites and the Society of Jesus, settled in Syria and Aleppo. There were several conversions to Catholicism of the Latin rite, and this led Congregation for the Evangelization of Peoples to establish a diocese in Aleppo. A first attempt to build an apostolic vicariate (pre-diocesan mission under a titular bishop) was in 1645. On 31 July 1645 was appointed bishop the Franciscan Giovanni Battista Dovara, which, however, \\"that he had achieved such a dignity, otherwise do not bother to go to his residence, despite the replicated excitations that he was moved by the Holy Congregation. Nor from that time on he was thought to depute a Latin bishop in that city\\".Leonardus Lemmens, Hierarchia latina Orientis, mediante S. Congregatione de propaganda fide instituita (1622-1922), in Orientalia Christiana, vol. IV, n¬∞ 10 (1924), pp. 296-301 The vicariate so he died in the bud: the jurisdiction of the Latin returned to the Custodian of the Holy Land (traditionally a Franciscan), as it was previously. The Apostolic Vicariate of Aleppo was erected properly (the 'second' time) on 27 June 1762, when Pope Clement XIII appointed the Congregation of the Mission member Frenchman Arnaud Bossu, who had been Apostolic Vicar of Algiers. In a Papal brief, Bossu receives the title of Vicar Apostolic of Aleppo, with jurisdiction over the Eastern Europeans and the Latin Rite of the patriarchates of Antioch and Jerusalem, including the Maronite and Armenian patriarchates. The vicar, however, did not put his residence in Aleppo, but at Antoura in Lebanon, and never received episcopal consecration. Also on this occasion, the vicariate was short-lived due to the Suppression of the Jesuit Order in 1773 and the French Revolution, which, among other consequences, involved the removal of all French religious orders not only in motherland, but also in mission lands. After the Congress of Vienna (1814-1815, to settle Europe after the defeat of Naopoleon I Bonaparte), the missionary Roman Congregation for the Evangelization of Peoples restored the apostolic vicariate in 1817, with the name of the Apostolic vicariate of Syria, Egypt, Arabia and Cyprus. It had jurisdiction over much of Catholic missions of the central and southern regions of the Ottoman Empire, namely : Syria, Lebanon, Cyprus, Palestine, the Arabian Peninsula, Egypt, Abyssinia (then empire of Ethiopia including Eritrea) and Nubia (Anglo-Egyptian Sudan and southernmost Egypt). Also included was the south-central part of Anatolia, including the cities of Antioch (Antakya) and Alexandretta (Iskenderun). On 1824.08.15 it lost Egyptian territory to establish the Coptic Catholic Patriarchate of Alexandria. On 18 May 1839 it ceded part of its territory for the creation of the Apostolic Vicariate of Egypt and Arabia (today the Apostolic Vicariate of Alexandria of Egypt) and the Apostolic Prefecture of Abyssinia (today Ethiopian Catholic Archeparchy of Addis Abeba in the Ethiopian rite), and simultaneously took the name of the Apostolic Vicariate of Aleppo. On October 4, 1847, it ceded Palestine, Cyprus and the areas corresponding to (the current / (Trans)Jordan for the restoration of the Latin Patriarchate of Jerusalem. With the end of the Ottoman Empire, the birth of modern Turkey (1923) and especially with the passage of Hatay from Syria to Turkey (1938), under the Papal bull of Pope Pius XII Ad maius christifidelium of 5 October 1939 and Quo sacrorum of 9 December 1939, the Vicariate Apostolic of Aleppo lost the Turkish territories that passed to the Apostolic Vicariate of Istanbul. On June 4, 1953, it gave another portion of territory for the creation of the Apostolic Vicariate of Beirut. From this moment the Vicariate Apostolic of Aleppo geographically corresponding to the Arab republic of Syria's territory. Only from this territorial change, the apostolic vicars have permanent residence in Aleppo, preferring previously reside in Lebanon.

It depicts three soldiers in high relief in the foreground, while two others in the background, accompanied by a standard bearer, are made in bas-relief. The standard-bearer holds an aquila standard, where the eagle grasps a thunderbolt in its talons. The soldiers have been identified as Praetorians due to the richness of the apparel, particularly the helmets, the ceremonial dress and oval shields. The figures are wearing calcei and not caligae, worn by ordinary soldiers. However, according to Boris Rankov, \\"the Attic-style helmets are almost certainly an artistic convention\\". Rankov suggests that \\"early in their history the Praetorians were still using the Montefortino-style helmet normal in the legions of the Republic and early Empire\\". The relief was previously dated to the early 2nd century AD. The lower half of the left-hand figure, portions of the middle two and the heads of all three foreground figures are modern restorations. In 2006 the relief underwent restoration by N. Imbert and A. M√©thivier. Provenance The Praetorians Relief was once part of the Arch of Claudius, erected in 51 to commemorate the conquest of Britain. The relief is mentioned as early as the 16th century. The head of the standard-bearer is depicted in Album by Pierre Jacques de Reims, on the page dated to 1577. The relief was once in the possession of the Mattei family, in 1824 it was purchased by the French.

By the mid-1930s and throughout the Second World War the command's title had become British Troops in Egypt. History The command was established in the late 19th century after the Anglo-Egyptian War in 1882. The British Army remained in Egypt throughout the First World War and, after the War, remained there to protect the Suez Canal. Following Egypt's independence in 1922, the United Kingdom and Egypt entered into a treaty in 1936 whereby British troops remained to protect the canal and to train the Egyptian Army. After the Second World War anti-British resentment escalated and there was rioting in the streets in February 1946. British troops left Egypt in June 1956 shortly before the Suez Crisis. It is reported that in December 1945 Major General Lashmer Whistler, GOC 3rd Division, became GOC British Troops in Egypt and shortly after ceased to be a member of the 3rd Division. Whistler's rank of major general was made substantive in February 1947, with seniority backdated to April 1946.

He won a silver medal in the team event at the 2016 Summer Olympics.  Career  Stretovich started gymnastics at six years old when his mother took him to a gym club. He won gold at his first competition. He trains in Moscow, with the other members of the Russian team, and in Novosibirsk. His gymnastics idol is Hiroyuki Tomita. = Junior = Stretovich appeared in his first major international competition at the 2012 European Junior Championships where the Russian Team won the silver medal, he was the youngest member of the Team (15 years old).

Symbols of Ireland are marks, images, or objects that represent Ireland. Because Ireland was not partitioned until 1922, many of the symbols of Ireland predate the division into Southern Ireland (later Irish Free State and then Ireland) and Northern Ireland. Unlike other countries (such as the United States, with the state symbols), Irish and Northern Irish state symbols are rarely defined by official Acts; they are defined by common usage or by various interest groups. These symbols are seen in official capacities, such as flags, coats of arms, postage stamps, and currency, and in URLs. They appear less formally as recurring themes in literature, art and folk art, heraldry, monuments, clothing, personal decoration, and as the names of parks, bridges and streets. Insignia =Coats of arms= The coat of arms of Ireland The coat of arms of the Executive Committee of the Privy Council of Northern Ireland, the now-abolished Government of Northern Ireland The arms of Ireland are a gold, silver-stringed Celtic harp (cl√°irseach) on an azure field. Technically, Northern Ireland as a region had never had a coat of arms - although the Government of Northern Ireland was granted one in 1924, this hasn't been used officially since the suspension of the Parliament of Northern Ireland in 1972, which was abolished the following year. Its notable features included the Irish elk and the banner of the House of de Burgh. =Flags= The flag of Ireland Flag of Northern Ireland (1953‚Äì73) St Patrick's Saltire The flag of Ireland is a tricolour of green, white and orange, first flown in 1848. The colours stand for Irish Catholicism, Irish Protestantism, and peace between the two. Although it was originally intended as a symbol of peace and ecumenism, the tricolour is today seen by some Irish unionists as a symbol of Irish republicanism and the Irish Republican Army. Many other flags are suggested as the cross-border flag for Ireland. The flag of Northern Ireland (Ulster Banner) was used officially between 1953 and 1973. The Union Jack is also used prominently in Northern Ireland and has been the flag of the United Kingdom since 1801. It is derived by combining Saint George's Cross (for England), St Andrew's Saltire (for Scotland) and Saint Patrick's Saltire. St Patrick's saltire has rarely been used as a symbol of Ireland since Ireland's independence from the United Kingdom. In present day, it is used mostly by institutions which were established by in Ireland before independence and which retain historic links to the United Kingdom, for example Trinity College Dublin and the Royal College of Surgeons in Ireland. It has been suggested that the Saltire should be used as Northern Ireland's official flag. =Motto= Great Seal of the Irish Catholic Confederation, 1642‚Äì52 The Republic of Ireland has no national motto. Northern Ireland has used the motto Quis separabit?, Latin from Romans 8:35: Quis nos separabit a caritate Christi..., \\"Who shall separate us from the love of Christ?\\" The motto Hiberni Unanimes pro Deo Rege et Patria (\\"The Irish United for God, King, and Country\\") was used by Confederate Ireland. The Society of United Irishmen (1780s‚Äì1798) used Equality: it is new strung and shall be heard as a motto. Flora and fauna =Bird= Northern lapwing The northern lapwing (Vanellus vanellus) was declared the Republic of Ireland's national bird by a committee of the Irish Wildlife Conservancy in 1990. Northern Ireland does not have an official national bird, but the Eurasian oystercatcher (Haematopus ostralegus) was unofficially selected in 1961. The Irish Examiner has put the rook (Corvus frugilegus) forward as a possible national bird, due to their \\"wild hardiness, spirit, and resilience, in the face of all difficulties, and their ability to cope with style and a bit of craic, with anything that the world throws at them.\\" In 2016 Niall Hatch of BirdWatch Ireland listed ten possible national birds: European robin, peregrine falcon, common house martin, Eurasian curlew, roseate tern, barn owl, common swift, Bohemian waxwing, Eurasian blackcap, northern pintail. In 2019, the European golden plover (Pluvialis apricaria) and roseate tern (Sterna dougallii) appeared on a series of \\"National Bird\\" stamps issued by An Post. =Bull= Cattle have been important in Irish mythology and folklore for centuries, sue to their economic importance as sources of milk, cheese, leather, and beef, as well as a source of social status. The bull has long been associated with high status in Ireland, appearing as an important animal in Irish several myths, such as the epic T√°in B√≥ C√∫ailnge (The Cattle Raid of Cooley), T√°in B√≥ Flidhais, and the tale of Glas Gaibhnenn. The prominence of the bull in Irish mythology reflects a prehistory of cattle raising and cattle raiding in which the bull was seen as an important symbol of power among kings. St Luke's winged bull is illustrated in Celtic style in the Book of Kells, as well as on various Irish stamps. =Dog breed= The Irish wolfhound is generally considered Ireland's national breed, although some, including Michael Collins, have put forward the Kerry Blue Terrier as an alternative. =Fish= The northern pike (Esox lucius) is Northern Ireland's national fish. \\"Coarse fish\\" have been described as the Republic of Ireland's national fish; this category includes the likes of bream, perch and carp. =Sheep= Sheep: Sheep-raising and wool products are historically important in Ireland, and sheep feature commonly in souvenirs sold to tourists, =Wild mammal= The national land mammal is unclear. The Irish Hare (Lepus timidus) has been described as a national animal, as has the red deer (Cervus elaphus). Although extinct, the Irish Elk is also associated with Ireland. =Plant and flower= FlaxShamrock The national plant is the shamrock (Trifolium dubium or Trifolium repens). Fuchsia magellanica 'Riccartonii' (hummingbird fuchsia, hardy fuchsia; in Irish deora D√©, \\"tears of God\\") has sometimes been described as the national flower, despite not being a native plant. Flax (Linum usitatissimum) is widely used as a symbol of Northern Ireland. It is the emblem of the Northern Ireland Assembly, referencing Ulster's linen industry. =Tree= Leaves and acorns of the sessile oak The national tree of the Republic is the sessile oak (Quercus petraea), declared as such in 1990 by Taoiseach Charlie Haughey. Other accounts give the strawberry tree (Arbutus unedo) as the national tree. Culture =Dance= Irish dance is Ireland's national dance. =Instrument= The Celtic harp (cl√°irseach), great Irish warpipes (p√≠ob mh√≥r), and uilleann pipes have all been described as national musical instruments. A gold Celtic harp on a green field has historically been used in heraldry to represent Ireland. =National anthem= \\"Amhr√°n na bhFiann\\" (\\"The Soldiers' Song\\") is the national anthem of the Republic of Ireland. Written in English by Peadar Kearney and set to music by Patrick Heeney in 1907, it was translated to Irish by Liam √ì Rinn in 1923; the Irish-language version is considered the official anthem. \\"God Save Ireland\\" was used from the 1870s until independence. \\"Ireland's Call\\" has been used by the Ireland national rugby union team and others since 1995. \\"God Save the Queen\\" (alternatively \\"God Save the King\\", depending on the gender of the reigning monarch) is used by Northern Ireland as it is a part of the UK. Although its use is controversial amongst Irish nationalists. =Personifications= There are several national personifications, all female: *Hibernia, an attractive, vulnerable girl *Erin *Kathleen N√≠ Houlihan *The Sean-Bhean bhocht: a poor old woman who needs the help of young Irish men willing to fight and die to free Ireland *Banba, F√≥dla and √âriu, three goddesses *R√≥is√≠n Dubh (Dark Little Rose) =Poet= Thomas Moore (1779‚Äì1852) and W. B. Yeats (1865‚Äì1939) are both considered the national poet. Other =Drink= Irish breakfast tea is described as the national (non-alcoholic) drink. Among alcoholic drinks, Irish whiskey is the national spirit, with Jameson Irish Whiskey and Tullamore Dew the main whiskey brands. Poit√≠n, made from potatoes and with an alcohol content of up to 90% ABV, is the traditional Irish moonshine, brewed illegally since 1661, when a duty was placed on whiskey and other spirits were made illegal. During this time, the name poit√≠n was applied to inferior products. According to one guidebook, \\"If you see a product labelled \\"poteen\\" in an airport or a bar, it's simply a white duty-paid Irish schnapps. By definition, poteen is illegal and can't be sold.\\" The first legally produced poit√≠n was produced in 1987, under the condition that it was not sold in Ireland; poit√≠n was fully legalised in 1997. It now holds GI status in the European Union. Stout, a dark beer made using roasted oats or barley, is the national beer, with Guinness heavily promoted as a symbol of Ireland. Stout was largely unknown in Ireland when Arthur Guinness opened his brewery in 1759; the traditional beer was Irish red ale. Irish coffee, made with coffee, whiskey, sugar and cream and invented in Foynes in 1943, has been described as the national cocktail. =Food= An Ulster fry The national dish of Ireland is the Irish stew; other national dishes include the full Irish breakfast/Ulster fry and bacon and cabbage. =Gemstone= The national gemstone is Connemara / Conamara marble. =Patron saint= Saint Patrick, a 5th-century bishop born in Britain, is Ireland's patron saint. =Sport= Gaelic games constitute Ireland's national sports: Gaelic football, hurling, camogie rounders and Gaelic handball. Irish road bowling (bullets) is another Irish sport. =Card game= Several sources give forty-fives (also called \\"45\\" or \\"25\\") , or its variant form Spoil Five, as the Irish national card game. =Weapon= Gerald of Wales saw the battle axe as Ireland's national weapon.

It focuses on the future of the integration of automation into economics, as well as the impact of this integration to the worldwide workforce. It was released online on YouTube on 13 August 2014 and later made available via ITunes and rss. Premise alt=Lexus RX 450h with attachment on top and Google logo on the side The video focuses on the topic of robots' rapidly increasing usefulness through human society, discussing how automation will lead to a future where human labour is no longer needed. Early on, an analogy is made describing how humans once displaced horses from their jobs (by creating mechanical muscles such as automobiles), dismissing the argument that humans will always find new work, seeing as horses are not nearly as much used now. This analogy finishes by connecting the creation of mechanical minds, or \\"brain labor\\", will lead to robots ousting humans out of their occupations. Grey also discusses how economics is the force behind a future based upon automation. Grey concludes by stating that 45% of the workforce could be replaced by bots, a figure which is inclusive of professional, white- collar and low-skill occupations, and higher than the 25% unemployment figure of the Great Depression. To take one specific example, the video states that there are 3 million driving jobs in the United States and 70 million worldwide. Grey further states that even creative occupations are not secure, mentioning the bot-composed music in the background of his video.

Biography Paul Benoit was born December 9, 1893 in Nancy, France. During World War I, Benoit first began to feel called to the vocation of a Benedictine monk. After the Armistice of 1918, he entered a retreat at the Benedictine Abbey of St. Maurice and St. Maur, at Clervaux in Luxembourg, and he joined the abbey in 1919. After taking his vows (1921) and being ordained into priesthood (1926), he was called Dom Paul Benoit. \\"Dom\\" is the traditional title given to Benedictines after their vows. Benoit had begun music lessons at the age of seven, taking piano lessons from his mother. He took organ lessons from Mademoiselle Hess, the daughter of the organist of Notre Dame Cathedral in Nancy. After his priestly ordination, he studied the organ with Albert Leblanc, the former organist of Notre Dame Cathedral in Luxembourg. He then studied with Augustin Pierson, organist at St. Louis Cathedral in Versailles, whose brother was also a monk at Clervaux. There he was introduced to the music of Johann Sebastian Bach and Louis Vierne, who influenced his own work. During that time, he gave organ lessons to organists in the area of Clervaux. In 1931, Benoit took over as organist of the Mutin- Cavaill√©-Coll organ (3 manuals, 20 stops) at the abbey, replacing his predecessor who suffered from health problems. Although he had already composed small pieces as a child, it was at this time that he began composing seriously. In an autobiography, he said that he drew inspiration from J.S. Bach (counterpoint), Louis Vierne (chromaticism), Claude Debussy (free rhythmic structure) and Maurice Ravel (chromaticism). His main source of inspiration was Gregorian chant, which he heard daily in the monastic liturgy. Benoit's compositional style can be described as melodic-pentatonic, with the occasional harmonic influence of Impressionism. He skillfully uses ninths, elevenths, and thirteenths, and the melody is often set against sustained chords. On the advice of his spiritual director, Benoit used his personal prayer time in his monastic cell for composing, because he could be close to God in this way. Benoit composed only for God, and he never performed a public concert. In 1945, Benoit met Dom Georges Chopiney, who had just moved to the Abbey of Clervaux, and who became his assistant at the organ, and a good friend. Chopiney wrote in his obituary of Benoit that in addition to music, Benoit - much like Olivier Messiaen - had a great love for plants and animals. He liked to take walks in the forest to admire the wetlands and watch animals (birds, butterflies, and even insects.) He was also involved in running a small weather station. As described by Chopiney, Benoit had a complex personality. On the one hand, he was a shy, sensitive, and timid man, who had a great need for love and appreciation, yet had difficulty relating to other people. On the other hand, he was sometimes jealous and could be very dominant, even authoritarian, although he was fundamentally a deeply humble man. He also had a sentimental streak, with a certain naivet√© and enthusiasm. Chopiney concludes his article with the following words: \\"\\" (English: \\"In the end, Dom Benoit was never anything other than a child [...] He had a child's soul, pure, naive and innocent.\\")Dom Georges Chopiney, \\"\\" (brochure) Benoit died on April 10, 1979 in Clervaux and left behind a great body of work for the organ, much of which has not yet been published.

The white, stone church was built in a long church style in 1878 using designs by the architect Giovanni Jacob Harbitz M√ºller. The church seats about 300 people. The church has a unique tower with an octagonal copper-clad steeple. History The earliest existing historical records of the church date back to the year 1329, but it was built before that time, likely during the 1200s. It was probably a stave church that stood about southeast of the present church. There is a plaque where the previous church once stood. The church was demolished in the early 1600s and replaced by a wooden church. The wooden church was sold to private owners Arne Olsen √òvre Totland and Lars Olsen √òvre Birkeland in 1724. In 1839, the church was bought back by the parish. Due to maintenance issues and population growth, that church was torn down in 1877 and replaced in 1878 with a larger stone church located about away in Nesttun. The new (present) church was consecrated on 21 November 1878.

The Kontoskalion is located in the southeastern part of the city, and named Harbour of Julian/Sophia. The Kontoskalion (), also known as Harbour of Julian (, ), Portus Novus (\\"New Port\\"), or Harbour of Sophia (), and in Ottoman times as Kadƒ±rga Limanƒ± (\\"Harbour of the Galleys\\") was a harbour in the city of Constantinople, active from the 6th century until the early Ottoman period. In the literature it has been known under several names, and the sources about it are often contradictory.. Location The harbour lay in an inlet ‚Äì still recognizable today in the flat landscape profile ‚Äì of the Marmara Sea, in the third region of the city, at the southwest end of the valley of the Hippodrome. The area of the harbour complex covers part of today's Mahalleler of Kadƒ±rga Limanƒ± and Kumkapi in the Fatih district (the walled city) of Istanbul. History =Byzantine period= Map of Constantinople around 1420, after Cristoforo Buondelmonti. The Kontoskalion is clearly visible on the central right part of the map, right of the Hippodrome: the semicircular convex mole protects it from the sea, while the sea walls separate it from the city. The Marmara Sea from Kumkapƒ±. From here the Byzantine galleys approached the harbour, now silted up. Already during the reign of Constantine the Great (r. 306‚Äì337) the site of the later harbour was used as a landing stage. In 362, during his short stay in the capital, Emperor Julian (r. 361-363) built on the Propontis shore a harbour named Portus Novus (\\"New Port\\") or Portus Iulianus (): at the same time he erected in front of it a crescent-shaped building named Sigma or Porticus Semirotunda.. This decision was taken despite the many problems which affected the location: each port along the Marmara shore was undefended against the fierce storms caused by the intermittent southwest wind, the Lodos; these brought much sand into the basin, making necessary a periodic and expensive dredging; moreover, the heavy rains provoked erosion from the hills which caused silting too.. On the other hand, the building of a harbour on the south shore was necessary to supply the western and southern regions of the city, too far from the Golden Horn. The problems of this area were compounded by repeated urban fires, the first fire having occurred at the end of the 4th century partially destroying the area. In the 6th century, Emperor Anastasius I (r. 491-518) emptied the basin using hydraulic machines, built a mole and dredged the sandy substrate. Later, possibly under Justinian (r. 527‚Äì565), part of the traffic of the Neorion port, the first harbour built in the city, lying on the Golden Horn, was moved to the new harbour. After damage by another fire in 561, his successor Justin II (r. 565‚Äì578) in around 575 commissioned important works, dredging the ground again and enlarging the basin: the works were directed by two high officials, the praepositus Narses and the protovestiarios Troilos. In front of the enlarged harbour, renamed \\"Port of Sophia\\" () after Justin's empress, were erected four statues, representing Justin, Sophia, their daughter Arabia and Narses. At the end of the century, the harbour also acquired a military function, which it did not lose until the end, becoming a base of the Byzantine navy. Emperor Philippikos Bardanes (r. 711‚Äì713) removed two of the statues adorning the Kontoskalion, since they bore prophetic inscriptions which he considered unfavorable. During his reign, Emperor Theophilos (r. 829‚Äì842) had an arsenal built near the harbour, in proximity of the Porta Leonis (the Ottoman √áatladƒ± Kapƒ±); it comprised a shipyard and armories. Between the 9th and the 11th century, the port remained operational: in that period, the writers of the Patria Constantinopolitanae began to refer to it also as Kontoskalion,. which remains the modern Greek denomination of the quarter lying to its west, known in Turkish as Kumkapƒ±. After the end of the Latin Empire, the harbour appears in several sources under the name Kontoskelion, causing confusion among modern scholars. According to the Patria, this denomination is a patronymic referring to a certain Agallianos, a Byzantine tourmarches (senior army officer) nicknamed Kontoskeles because of his short legs,. but the German scholar Albrecht Berger rejects this as a mistake by the Patria authors, due to the different etymology of the two words: \\"Kontoskalion\\" means \\"short step or wharf\\".. Some authors, like Raymond Janin, have proposed that the name Kontoskelion () could refer to another harbour placed 150 m west of the Julian/Sophia harbour, nearer to the Vlanga area, but this interpretation should be disregarded, since it is certain that the Kontoskalion was the only port in use on the Marmara Sea until the 15th century. In that period, the harbour maintained its important function: during the Palaiologos dynasty, Emperor Michael VIII (r. 1259‚Äì1282) protected it with an ashlar wall and a chain, while his successor Andronikos II (r. 1282‚Äì1328) made the harbour deeper and closed its entrance with iron gates, protecting the ships from the storms that come with the Lodos.. The harbour was attested in an encomium of Emperor John VIII (r. 1425‚Äì1448) written in 1427. From it we know that John VIII ordered repairs to the harbour, employing paid workers (among them were also clergymen and monks), and not servants.. At the end of these works, the basin could host 300 galleys. In some versions of the map of Florentine traveller Cristoforo Buondelmonti (who visited Constantinople in 1421),. the basin is shown flanked by its arsenal, and in the account of the Spanish traveller Pedro Tafur, who saw it in 1437, the harbour was still active. It remained so until the Fall of Constantinople in 1453. =Ottoman period= After the conquest of the city, in 1462 Sultan Mehmet II (r. 1444‚Äì1446; 1451‚Äì1481) fortified the harbour, now known as Kadƒ±rga Limanƒ± (\\"Harbour of the Galleys\\"), building several towers. However, the beginning of the construction in 1515 of a new arsenal on the Golden Horn, the Ters√¢ne-i √Çmire, protected from the storms provoked by the southwest wind, and the enormous growth of the Ottoman navy, caused the decay of the Kadƒ±rga Limanƒ±. The 16th-century French traveller Pierre Gilles reports that around 1540 the women living in that neighbourhood used to wash their clothes in the basin. However, in some 18th- century maps, the harbour is still shown in active use. The end of the port was accelerated by the erection of the Nuruosmaniye Mosque, started in 1748, since the excavated earth was partly thrown in the harbour. The basin and the arsenal have since long time disappeared, and today they are partly built up. Description Braun and Hogenberg, 1572. In the first description of the area, stemming from the 6th century, the harbour is described as a basin flanked by an arsenal surrounded by walls. The first maps of the city show the same situation, with the arsenal extending in the plain area west of the Sokollu Mehmet Pasha Mosque until the old sea wall of Kumkapƒ±, while the basin, protected by a mole, is delimited by the Sea Walls, still in place in 19th century. According to Wolfgang M√ºller-Wiener, it is also possible that the arsenal area was originally another sea basin, but the division between Kontoskalion and Port of Sophia appearing on several old maps, where they are represented as separated harbors, should be refused, due to the topography of the area.

The area of his academic lectures was extraordinarily wide and much like especially during the time of its undiminished effectiveness; an emphatic proof then that share of the work was as low, which has nowadays, like all professions, including on the science itself asserted. In addition to Exegetical, repeated to the Theil lectures on almost all the books of the Old and New Testaments Eckermann about grammar, Hebrew, Syriac, and Arabic language, on dogmatic theology, church history, and Christian morals las homiletics, catechesis, but also, at least some times, via Greek and Latin writers, such as about the Platonic dialogues on Pindar and Livy. During his time in Kiel he concentrated his writing in the theological direction. The emphasis falls on the six volumes of theological contributions published in the years 1790‚Äì99, as well as on the \\"Compendium theologiae christianae theoreticae biblio-historicae\\" (1791 and 1792-Second Edition). Eckermann was a friend of grammatical historical interpretation; in exegesis his style was not free from prolixity and repetition. An unambiguous and yet modest language and his discretion was praised after criticism on the one hand the aforementioned compendium, on the other hand were condemned but also the misguided principles in distinction from the teachings of Jesus and the Apostles of the Jewish tradition.

Newcomb served as an editor and writer of feature articles for magazines. He also raced horses in Kentucky and Virginia, and he owned farmland in Loudoun County, Virginia. Early life and education Newcomb was born to Herman Danforth Newcomb and Matilda Churchill Newcomb in Jefferson County, Kentucky on December 3, 1899. Herman Newcomb served in the Kentucky General Assembly as a member of the Kentucky House (1904-1909) and Senate (1909-1913). After growing up in the Louisville, Kentucky, Newcomb graduated from the Morristown School (now Morristown-Beard School) in Morristown, New Jersey in 1918. Newcomb's classmates at the Morristown School included theatre critic John Mason Brown (a second cousin of Newcomb). Newcomb, Brown, and other family members regularly performed together in attic plays during summers at the Newcomb family farm. In 1913, Newcomb mailed a photograph to St. Nicholas magazine, a children's magazine, that made the Roll of Honor. A year later, the magazine published his letter to the editor in its \\"Because We Want To Know\\" section. The letter asked the magazine editors whether fires burned more brightly in cold weather than warm weather. After graduating from high school, Newcomb completed training with the Harvard Officer's Training Corps in 1918. He later completed a bachelor's degree in journalism at Harvard University in Cambridge, Massachusetts in 1923. During his studies at the university, Newcomb served on the Editorial Board of The Harvard Lampoon, a humor magazine, and on the entertainment committee for his class committee. Newcomb served as the 1923 crew team's assistant manager, and he served as the Morristown Club's secretary-treasurer. He also participated in the Hasty Pudding Club. Horse racing and farming activities Newcomb's mother Matilda belonged to the Churchill family in Kentucky connected to horse racing. Newcomb was the great-grandnephew of John Churchill and William Henry Churchill who donated the land for Churchill Downs, the home of the Kentucky Derby. Engaging in the family pastime, Newcomb attended horse shows. In 1928, he attended a breakfast of notables at the National Horse Show at Madison Square Garden that featured Governor Al Smith as the guest of honor. Newcomb also owned a chestnut mare named Friskie that he raced in horse racing events in Kentucky and Virginia. In 1928, Friskie won the hunter trophy at the Orange Horse Show in Orange, Virginia. Friskie also captured the first leg on a challenge cup race in Charlottesville, Virginia that year. In 1931, Friskie rode to victory in a mile and a half steeplechase event in Lexington, Kentucky. After graduating college, Newcomb lived on the family farm in Greenwood, Albemarle County, Virginia. He later acquired land to run a farm near Purcellville, Virginia in Loudoun County. Newcomb raised shorthorn cattle at the farm. In 1949, an animal scientist named A. H. Frank studied Newcomb's herd in a larger study of cattle breeding activities. The study sought to determine reasons why some cattle breed more regularly than others. Journalism activities Newcomb served as sporting editor of The Field Illustrated, a magazine dedicated to agriculture and rural sports. He also served as editor-in-chief of Chase Magazine, which focused on hunting, and he wrote articles on horse racing for The Wall Street Journal. Family Newcomb married Margaret Zolny on February 25, 1937. After they divorced four years later, he married Edith Carlisle (daughter of James Mandeville Carlisle Esq. of Washington, D.C.) on May 16, 1941. They had two children together: Penelope and Katherine. In 1953, Edith Newcomb co-founded the Loudoun Country Day School in Leesburg, Virginia after a meeting at Purcellville Library. After the school opened in 1955, she then served as its headmistress until 1963.

It is located between Enschede and Hengelo. It had 240 registered inhabitants in 2008. Until 1934 it fell, for administrative purposes, within the ambit of Lonneker, but in that year Lonneker was abolished for administrative purposes, and both are now administered as districts of Enschede  History  Twekkelo was traditionally included in the parish of Enschede, along with Lonneker, Driene, Usselo and De Eschmarke. From approximately the year 900 a record survives naming the place as Tuegloe. Twekkelo itself was divided into districts identified as the Gerinkhoek, the Beldershoek, the Wullenhoek, the Rougoor, the Mensinkhoek, the Twekkeler field and the Great field.  Salt  In 1919 AkzoNobel established a salt extraction facility at Twekkelo,http://www.twekkelo.nl/historie/zoutwinning.html but this is no longer operational.  Geography  The heart of Twekkelo is three closely positioned pieces of arable pasture, surrounded by a number of farmsteads, one or two of which were already mentioned in ninth and tenth century records. A register compiled in 1475 estimates that there were by then 23 of these farmsteads. Three streams, the Makkenbroekenbeek (Twekkelerbeek), the Strootsbeek (later Elsbeek) and the Schoolbeek flow from east to west through Twekkelo. The last two of these actually originate in Twekkelo. The water in parts of the streams is exceptionally clear. The area is now bordered by the industrial areas of Enschede and Hengelo and, to the north, by the Twentekanaal. The A35 highway runs along the southern edge of Twekkelo. Twekkelo contains numerous traditional and historical buildings. The Twekkelo Preservation Union (\\"Vereniging Behoud Twekkelo\\") was formed in 1991 in response to the threat of urbanisation and industrial incursions. A number of walking trails have been established and steps have been taken to make the rural charms of the place better known to outsiders.  Johanneskerk (Church of St. John)  The little Johanneskerk was built in 1950 by the \\"Armenstaat Twekkelo\\", an organisation set up to serve poor and materially disadvantaged local members of the Dutch Reformed Church. Since 1998 it has been possible to use the church for civil marriages. References External links * Twekkelo website * Map of the former municipality, around 1868.

The town was besieged by ISIL forces from June 2014, lacking access to food, electricity, and water. Most the residents are Shia Turkmen, who have organized local self-defense militias to fight against ISIL. On August 31, the Iraqi military reportedly broke the siege and entered the town. It has been described as \\"Iraq's Biggest Victory Against ISIS\\", as of September 2014. Iran had reportedly played a \\"military planning\\" role in breaking Siege of Amirli. Events =Siege= The siege began in June, after Islamic State of Iraq and Syria (ISIL) forces advanced on Iraqi positions in Northern Iraq. They attacked the town, but failed to capture it after townspeople armed with AK-47s put up resistance. However, ISIL had more powerful weapons compared to the local militia, prompting fears that they would try to storm the town. ISIL forces continued to fire mortars and rockets into the town and launched raids against it. 20,000 citizens in Amirli were in danger from being killed by ISIL, dying from thirst or hunger. The United Nations expressed concern over the situation in Amirli, and warned about the possibility of ISIL committing a massacre in the town. =Military efforts= On 30 August, the Iraqi Army, Shi'ite militias and Peshmerga started a campaign to break the siege, after the speaker of Grand Ayatollah Ali al- Sistani, Abdul-Mahdi al-Karabalai, called to move and break the siege by ISIL on the town. The forces attacked ISIL from three areas, the army attacked from the south of Amirli in Adhaim, the Peshmerga attacked from the north in Tuz Khurmatu, the militias attacked from the east in Kifri. Kataib Hezbollah helicoptered in 50 of its best fighters, according to Abu Abdullah, a local Kataib Hezbollah commander. The fighters set up an operations room to coordinate with the Iraqi army, the other militia groups, and advisers from the Quds Force, the branch of Iran's Islamic Revolutionary Guard Corps that handles operations outside Iran and oversees Tehran's Iraqi militias. On 31 August, the United States, France, United Kingdom and Australia began humanitarian aid drops, like food, water and medical supplies, to help prevent a potential massacre against the Shi'a Turkmen minority in Amirli. The US also carried out air strikes on ISIL positions around and near Amirli. Iraqi officials stated that they had reached Amirli and broken the siege and that the military was currently fighting to clear the areas around the town. On the same day, with the support of the US Air Force, the offensive troops succeeded in breaking the siege and freeing the villages around it, with the local citizens cheering and celebrating the end of the siege. The speaker of the Iraqi Armed Forces, Qasim Atta, stated that the troops succeeded in breaking the siege by entering the Amirli from the south. The offensive forces are proceeding in opening the Baghdad‚ÄìAmirli road. Aftermath After regaining control over Amirli, on 1 September, the Iraqi Army and its allies went on and retrieved the town of Suleiman Bek (90 km east of Tikrit) from ISIL. An Iraqi official stated that 23 Chechens from ISIL were killed, including 10 snipers. Following the operations to end the Amirli siege, pro-government militias and volunteer fighters as well as Iraqi security forces raided Sunni villages and neighborhoods around Amirli in Saladin and Kirkuk Governorates. Many were villages that ISIL had passed through and in some cases used as bases for their attack on Amirli. During the raids, militiamen, volunteer fighters and Iraqi security forces looted possessions of civilians who fled fighting during the onslaught on Amirli; burned homes and businesses of the villages' Sunni residents; and used explosives and heavy equipment to destroy individual buildings or entire villages. The Human Rights Watch documented the abduction of 11 men in the course of the government's operation, but local residents said many other men of fighting age had gone missing.

A wide range of applications include scientific and industrial processes, food production and storage and breathing gases. Gas mixtures are usually specified in terms of molar gas fraction (which is closely approximated by volumetric gas fraction for many permanent gases): by percentage, parts per thousand or parts per million. Volumetric gas fraction converts trivially to partial pressure ratio, following Dalton's law of partial pressures. Partial pressure blending at constant temperature is computationally simple, and pressure measurement is relatively inexpensive, but maintaining constant temperature during pressure changes requires significant delays for temperature equalization. Blending by mass fraction is unaffected by temperature variation during the process, but requires accurate measurement of mass or weight, and calculation of constituent masses from the specified molar ratio. Both partial pressure and mass fraction blending are used in practice. Applications =Shielding gases for welding= Tungsten inert gas welding Shielding gases are inert or semi-inert gases used in gas metal arc welding and gas tungsten arc welding to protect the weld area from oxygen and water vapour, which can reduce the quality of the weld or make the welding more difficult. Gas metal arc welding (GMAW), or metal inert gas (MIG) welding, is a process that uses a continuous wire feed as a consumable electrode and an inert or semi-inert gas mixture to protect the weld from contamination. Lincoln Electric, p. 5.4-3 Gas tungsten arc welding (GTAW), or tungsten inert gas (TIG) welding, is a manual welding process that uses a nonconsumable tungsten electrode, an inert or semi-inert gas mixture, and a separate filler material.Weman, p. 31 = Modified Atmosphere Packaging in the food industry = Modified atmosphere packaging preserves fresh produce to improve delivered quality of the product and extend its life. The gas composition used to pack food products depends on the product. A high oxygen content helps to retain the red colour of meat, while low oxygen reduces mould growth in bread and vegetables. =Gas mixtures for brewing= *Sparging: An inert gas such as nitrogen is bubbled through the wine, which removes the dissolved oxygen. Carbon dioxide is also removed and to ensure that an appropriate amount of carbon dioxide remains, a mixture of nitrogen and carbon dioxide may be used for the sparging gas.http://www.gasmixing.com/Gas-mixing-applications.aspx *Purging and blanketing: The removal of oxygen from the headspace above the wine in a container by flushing with a similar gas mixture to that used for sparging is called purging, and if it is left there it is called blanketing or inerting. =Breathing gas mixtures for diving= Partial pressure gas blending equipment for scuba diving A breathing gas is a mixture of gaseous chemical elements and compounds used for respiration. The essential component for any breathing gas is a partial pressure of oxygen of between roughly 0.16 and 1.60 bar at the ambient pressure. The oxygen is usually the only metabolically active component unless the gas is an anaesthetic mixture. Some of the oxygen in the breathing gas is consumed by the metabolic processes, and the inert components are unchanged, and serve mainly to dilute the oxygen to an appropriate concentration, and are therefore also known as diluent gases. Scuba diving Gas blending for scuba diving is the filling of diving cylinders with non-air breathing gases such as nitrox, trimix and heliox. Use of these gases is generally intended to improve overall safety of the planned dive, by reducing the risk of decompression sickness and/or nitrogen narcosis, and may improve ease of breathing. Surface supplied and saturation diving Gas blending for surface supplied and saturation diving may include the filling of bulk storage cylinders and bailout cylinders with breathing gases, but it also involves the mixing of breathing gases at lower pressure which are supplied directly to the diver or to the hyperbaric life-support system. Part of the operation of the life-support system is the replenishment of oxygen used by the occupants, and removal of the carbon dioxide waste product by the gas conditioning unit. This entails monitoring of the composition of the chamber gas and periodic addition of oxygen to the chamber gas at the internal pressure of the chamber. The gas mixing unit is part of the life support equipment of a saturation system, along with other components which may include bulk gas storage, compressors, helium recovery unit, bell and diver hot water supply, gas conditioning unit and emergency power supply =Medical gas mixtures= Anesthetic machine The anesthetic machine is used to blend breathing gas for patients under anesthesia during surgery. The gas mixing and delivery system lets the anesthetist control oxygen fraction, nitrous oxide concentration and the concentration of volatile anesthetic agents.The Anaesthetic Machine - Gas mixing systems http://www.anaesthesia.med.usyd.edu.au/resources/lectures/gas_supplies_clt/gasmixing.html The machine is usually supplied with oxygen (O2) and nitrous oxide (N2O) from low pressure lines and high pressure reserve cylinders, and the metered gas is mixed at ambient pressure, after which additional anesthetic agents may be added by a vaporizer, and the gas may be humidified. Air is used as a diluent to decrease oxygen concentration. In special cases other gases may also be added to the mixture. These may include carbon dioxide (CO2), used to stimulate respiration, and helium (He) to reduce resistance to flow or to enhance heat transfer.The biomedical engineering handbook. 2nd edition edited by Joseph D. Bronzino.

Examples include melting of reactive metals such as magnesium, and heat treatment of steels. =Customized gas mixtures for analytical applications= Calibration gases: *Span gases are used for testing and calibrating gas detection equipment by exposing the sensor to a known concentration of a contaminant. The gases are used as a reference point to ensure correct readings after calibration and have very accurate composition, with a content of the gas to be detected close to the set value for the detector. *Zero gas is normally a gas free of the component to be measured, and as similar as practicable to the composition of the gas to be monitored, used to calibrate the zero point of the sensor. Calibration gas mixtures are generally produced in batches by gravimetric or volumetric methods. The gravimetric method uses sensitive and accurately calibrated scales to weigh the amounts of gases added into the cylinder. Precise measurement is required as inaccuracy or impurities can result in incorrect calibration. The container for calibration gas must be as close to perfectly clean as practicable. The cylinders may be cleaned by purging with high purity nitrogen, the vacuumed. For particularly critical mixtures the cylinder may be heated while being vacuumed to facilitate removal of any impurities adhering to the walls.Staff, Wilhelmsen Ships Service: \\"Span gases\\" http://www.wilhelmsen.com/services/maritime/companies/buss/BUSS_Pressroom/Documents/Span%20Gases.pdf After filling, the gas mixture must be thoroughly mixed to ensure that all components are evenly distributed throughout the container to prevent possible variations on composition within the container. This is commonly done by rolling the container horizontally for 2 to 4 hours. Methods Several methods are available for gas blending. These may be distinguished as batch methods and continuous processes. =Batch methods= Batch gas blending requires the appropriate amounts of the constituent gases to be measured and mixed together until the mixture is homogenous. The amounts are based on the mole (or molar) fractions, but measured either by volume or by mass. Volume measurement may be done indirectly by partial pressure, as the gases are often sequentially decanted into the same container for mixing, and therefore occupy the same volume. Weight measurement is generally used as a proxy for mass measurement as acceleration can usually be considered constant. The mole fraction is also called the amount fraction, and is the number of molecules of a constituent divided by the total number of all molecules in the mixture. For example, a 50% oxygen, 50% helium mixture will contain approximately the same number of molecules of oxygen and helium. As both oxygen and helium approximate ideal gases at pressures below 200 bar, each will occupy the same volume at the same pressure and temperature, so they can be measured by volume at the same pressure, then mixed, or by partial pressure when decanted into the same container. The mass fraction can be calculated from the molar fraction by multiplying the molar fraction by the molecular mass for each constituent, to find a constituent mass, and comparing it to the summed masses of all the constituents. The actual mass of each constituent needed for a mixture is calculated by multiplying the mass fraction by the desired mass of the mixture. Partial pressure blending Also known as volumetric blending. This must be done at constant temperature for best accuracy, though it is possible to compensate for temperature changes in proportion to the accuracy of the temperature measured before and after each gas is added to the mixture. Partial pressure blending is commonly used for breathing gases for diving. The accuracy required for this application can be achieved by using a pressure gauge which reads accurately to 0.5 bar, and allowing the temperature to equilibrate after each gas is added. Mass fraction blending Also known as gravimetric blending. This is relatively unaffected by temperature, and accuracy depends on the accuracy of mass measurement of the constituents. Mass fraction blending is used where great accuracy of the mixture is critical, such as in calibration gases. The method is not suited to moving platforms where the accelerations can cause inaccurate measurement, and therefore is unsuitable for mixing diving gases on vessels. =Continuous processes= Additive Nitrox blending station using continuous flow blending before compression Nitrox blending tube for mixing oxygen into the intake air for a compressor *Constant flow blending ‚Äì a controlled flow of the constituent gases is mixed to form the product. Blending may occur at ambient pressure or at a pressure setting above ambient but lower than supply gas pressures. **Constant mass flow supply: Precision mass flow controllers are used to control the flow rate of each gas for blending. Mass flow meters may be installed on the outputs of the mass flow controllers to monitor the output. The gases may be passed through a static mixer to ensure homogenous output. Continuous gas blending is used for some surface supplied diving applications, and for many chemical processes using reactive gas mixtures, particularly where there may be a need to alter the mixture during the operation or process. Subtractive These processes start with a mixture of gases, usually air, and reduce the concentration of one or more of the constituents. These processes can be used for the production of Nitrox for scuba diving and deoxygenated air for blanketing purposes. *Pressure swing adsorption ‚Äì Selective adsorption of gas on a medium which is reversible and proportional to pressure. Gas is loaded onto the medium during the high pressure phase and is released during the low pressure phase. *Membrane gas separation ‚Äì Gas is forced through a semi-permeable membrane by a pressure difference. Some of the constituent gases pass through the membrane more easily than the others, and the output from the low pressure side is enriched with the gases which pass through more easily. Gases which are slower to pass through the membrane accumulate on the high pressure side and are continuously discharged to retain a steady concentration. The process may be repeated in several stages to increase concentrations. Gas analysis Gas mixtures must generally be analysed either in process or after blending for quality control. This is particularly important for breathing gas mixtures where errors can affect the health and safety of the end user. Oxygen content is relatively simple to monitor using electro-galvanic cells and these are routinely used in the underwater diving industry for this purpose, though other methods may be more accurate and reliable.

During his Senior season at McPherson, Troy had 659 receiving yards (3rd in Conference) and 6 touchdowns (2nd). He interviewed with the Cleveland Browns and Tennessee Titans but went undrafted in the 2006 NFL Draft.  Professional career  Eventually McBroom ended up on the radar of the Arena Football League. He signed with the Stockton Lightning of the AF2. In his rookie year (2008), he appeared in the final four games of the regular season with the Lightning. Head Coach Chad Carlson liked Troy's size and work ethic. In his debut McBroom had 10 catches for 110 yards and 4 touchdowns against the Tennessee Valley Vipers. He'd finish 2008, tallying 30 receptions for 296 yards and eight touchdowns, while averaging 74.0 yards per game. In 2009, McBroom led the Lightning offense with 114 receptions for 1463 yards and 24 touchdowns, averaging 91.4 yards per game. He ended the regular season ranked 15th in the af2 in receiving yards per game, 10th in receptions, and 6th in reception yards. With the Lightning suspending operations for the 2010 season, McBroom joined the Tulsa Talons of the AF1 in 2011. He earned nominations for Offensive Rookie of the Year, with 149 receptions (4th), for 1,747 yards (4th), and 31 touchdowns. His 9.9 receptions per game led the league. A separated shoulder in the final contest of 2011 ended his season prematurely as Troy had already set the Talons single season record for receptions, and posted 2nd highest single season receiving yard total in franchise history. Troy also had been invited to camp with the New York Jets, but was unable to attend due to his injury. In 2012, McBroom was assigned to the Chicago Rush, and finished the season on the roster of the Philadelphia Soul.

He was also a member of the Volksraad (or colonial legislature) of the Dutch East Indies. History He was born into the prominent Djajadiningrat family in Kabayan village, Pandeglang on August 16, 1877, and died in Purwakarta on December 22, 1943. His father, Raden Bagus Djajawinata, was a forward-thinking Regent of Serang, while his grandfather, Raden Adipati Aria Natadiningrat, served as Regent of Pandeglang. His mother was Ratu Salehah, originally from Cipete, Serang. Djajadiningrat served as Regent of Serang from 1901 until 1924, and was then appointed to the newly-created post of Regent of Batavia, in office from 1924 until 1929.

Legacy In 1936 he authored a book of his memoirs titled Herinneringen van Pangeran Aria Achmad Djajadiningrat which contains over 37 years of his experience in public services, among others, as regent of Serang (1901-1927), regent of Batavia, Volksraad member, member of the Raad van Indie, and representative of the Dutch East Indies as the Dutch delegation at the League of Nations in Geneva, Switzerland. In 1936 his autobiography, Herinneringen van Pangeran Aria Achmad Djajadiningrat, was published in Amsterdam and Batavia by Kolff & Co. In the same year, this book was translated into Indonesian and published by Kolff and Balai Pustaka under the title \\"Kenang-Kenangan Achmad Djajadiningrat, 1877-1943\\". It was republished in 1996 by Paguyuban Keturunan P.A. Achmad Djajadiningrat with the new standardized Indonesian spelling.

His chronological position and identity are unclear. Attestations Yakareb is one of the few attested kings of the 14th Dynasty with two scarab seals attributable to him, both of unknown provenance. One of the two scarabs is currently housed in the Egyptian Museum of Berlin, catalog number 293/73, while the other is in the Petrie Museum, under the catalog number 11810.Olga Tufnell: Studies on Scarab Seals Vol. 2, Aris & Phillips 1984, , see seal num. 3493The scarab on Digital Egypt, Petrie Museum.The scarab on the catalog of the Petrie Museum Since \\"Yakareb\\" is this king's nomen, it is not possible to assert whether or not Yakareb is listed on the Turin canon. The Turin canon is a king list redacted in the early Ramesside period, which serves as the primary historical source for the 14th Dynasty but which records only the prenomen of the kings. Moreover, the document is fragmentary and Yakareb's prenomen may be lost in a lacuna. Thus, Yakareb is attested for certain by only the two scarabs, both of which are crudely made, and it is possible that \\"Yakareb\\" is a garbled or variant form of the name of a better known king of this time period. Chronological position Although the chronological position of Yakareb is uncertain, the Egyptologists Kim Ryholt and Darrell Baker proposed that he ruled in the 14th Dynasty some time before Yaqub-Har. This estimation is based on a seriation of the scarabs dating to the Second Intermediate Period.

History Mascula was located in the Aur√®s Mountains (part of the Atlas Mountains), at above sea level, and has a cool Mediterranean climate: it was one of the coldest cities in Numidia (even now it snows sometimes). The fresh location was chosen by Roman legionaries to retire as veterans. Mascula was built under Trajan and was garrisoned by the \\"7th company of Lusitanians\\". It was a castrum (with a nearby vicus) on the military road, that connected Theveste with Sitifis and that followed the slopes of the Aures mountains. Mascula was connected with the fortifications of Tinfadi, Vegesela, Claudi and Tliamugas. Mascula was the most important of these forts from a strategic point of view, because controlled the numidian access to the Sahara. Mascula in the fourth century was at the center of the Donatism controversy, and there are beautiful mosaics discovered from those years There are even some Roman baths from the late third century, still efficiently working after recent restoration. Mascula was even one of the centers of Romano-berber resistance against the Arabs, under queen Kahina. It seems that was renamed -after the Moslem conquest- with the name of one of the daughters of Kahina: Khenchela (meaning \\"angel\\" in berber). Notes Bibliography * Dunbabin, Katherine.

Rossi, a rugby player himself and an admirer of Hitler and Mussolini, had played for Stade Toulousain in the 1980s although he had to leave the club due to his racist ideas. Several years later and after changing his mind about ethnic groups when visiting a Holocaust museum in France with his teammates,\\"The Chimera of Heroes: Review\\" at Variety.com, 19 Oct 2003 Rossi decided to spread the practise of the sport among toba people of Formosa Province, who lived in conditions of extreme poverty.\\"Tomi, en el Aborigen RC\\", Rugbyfun.com.ar, 13 July 2009 He arrived to Formosa with the objective of establishing a rugby team and teaching local aborigins the rules of the game. The boys recruited by Rossi were minery and agricultural workers that trained barefoot two days a week and learnt how to play. They also used a truck instead of a scrumming machine in the practises due to the lack of resources. On March 30, 1993, Aborigen Rugby Club made its official debut v. local team Aguar√°.

In 1992, it was listed in the National Register of Historic Places, as one of the few remaining steel truss bridges constructed in Nebraska during the early 20th century. It was destroyed by flooding in 2019, and was delisted in 2020. Description The bridge was a six-panel, Pratt through truss steel bridge, with two spans. When completed in 1909, it was reported to be long; but on the National Register of Historic Places Registration Form, the reported total length was . The bridge width was . History and significance On March 19, 1908, the Custer County, Nebraska supervisors unanimously approved the construction of the Sargent Bridge. At that time, there was a wooden bridge over the river that was expensive to maintain. Building a steel bridge was viewed as more expensive by the board of supervisors, but in the long run they believed that it would save money on maintenance. Work began on the bridge on November 19, 1908. However, construction on the bridge had been delayed and the starting date was approximately one month after its planned finish. The Standard Bridge Company was commissioned to build the bridge and they were under bond to build the bridge by October 13, 1908, but according to the bond they were only liable for damages and additional expenses if the bridge was not built on time. The bridge was finally completed during the first week of January, 1909, and it was inspected and approved by the county bridge committee. This was the first steel bridge built in Custer County. Nebraska state engineers had estimated the cost at $10,000 ($ today) and the original cost of the bridge by the county supervisors was $5,500 ($ today). However, because of the quicksand in the river bed, bridge supports were sunk deeper at an additional cost of $1,500 ($ today), which brought the total cost of the bridge to about $7,000 ($ today). In 1920, the Custer County board of supervisors asked the Nebraska state highway authorities to rebuild the Sargent Bridge to meet state and federal specifications. Funds were never appropriated to rebuild the bridge, but it was subsequently incorporated into US Highway 183. In 1960, the route of the highway was moved a short distance to the east, and the 1909 bridge was closed to public traffic. It was subsequently acquired by the Middle Loup Irrigation District. Remains of bridge in 2019: central piling, with south abutment in background In 1992, the bridge was listed in the National Register of Historic Places, as one of only a few multiple-span steel truss bridges constructed in the early 20th century that were still extant in Nebraska. At that time, the east web of the north truss had broken, but the bridge was still structurally sound, and providing non-public access to a diversion dam. In March 2019, ice chunks carried by heavy flooding in the river destroyed the bridge. The north span was carried about 80 yards downstream, where it caught on the diversion dam; one end of the south span was pushed off a piling, and the span was twisted some 45 degrees. It was deemed necessary to remove the remains of the bridge from the river, lest future flooding carry them downstream to damage the current Highway 183 bridge.

The city's special events budget states that any purchase costing more than $7,500 constitutes notification of the council. The city purchased three trees totaling $108,000. According to city officials, the trees have a 10- to 12-year life span so they are a long term investment not falling under the special events budget. In December 2018, Stimpson filed a lawsuit against the Mobile City Council alleging violations of the Zoghby Act. The council claimed that the mayor had spent millions of dollars on PR consultants and staffers, fearing Stimpson was using the city treasury as an extension of his own personal image campaign. The council lowered the mayor's PR budget to a single PR employee, consistent with previous mayoral budgets, and hired former mayoral spokesperson Marion Steinfels as their own consultant. The mayor fired Steinfels in retaliation, and the council rehired her. Stimpson subsequently filed a lawsuit against the council.

History  =First Muslim invasion and the successful Sasanian counter-attack= The Muslim invasion of Pars first began in 638/9, when the Rashidun governor of Bahrain, al-'Ala' ibn al-Hadrami, who after having defeated some rebellious Arab tribes, seized an island in the Persian Gulf. Although al-'Ala' and the rest of the Arabs had been ordered to not invade Pars or its surrounding islands, he and his men continued their raids into the province. Al-'Ala quickly prepared an army which was divided into three groups, one under al-Jarud ibn Mu'alla, the second under al-Sawwar ibn Hammam and the third under Khulayd ibn al-Mundhir ibn Sawa. When the first group entered Pars, it was quickly defeated and al-Jarud was killed. The same thing soon happened to the second group. However, things proved to be more fortunate with the third group; Khulayd managed to keep them on bay, but was unable to withdraw back to Bahrain due to the Sasanians blocking his way at the sea. Umar, finding out about al-'Ala's invasion of Pars, had him replaced with Sa'd ibn Abi Waqqas as the governor of Bahrain. Umar then ordered Utbah ibn Ghazwan to send reinforcements to Khulayd. When the reinforcements arrived, Khulayd and some of his men managed successfully to withdraw back to Bahrain, while the rest withdrew to Basra. =Second and last Muslim invasion= In ca. 643, Uthman ibn Abi al-As seized Bishapur, and made a peace treaty with the inhabitants of the city. In 19/644, al-'Ala' once again attacked Pars from Bahrain, reaching as far as Estakhr, until he was repelled by the governor (marzban) of Pars, Shahrag. Some time later, Uthman ibn Abi al-As managed to establish a military base at Tawwaj, and shortly defeated and killed Shahrag near Rew-shahr (however other sources states that it was his brother who did it). A Persian convert to Islam, Hormoz ibn Hayyan al-'Abdi, was shortly sent by Uthman ibn Abi al-'As to attack a fortress known as Senez on the coast of Pars. After the accession of Uthman ibn Affan as the new Caliph of the Rashidun Caliphate on 11 November, the inhabitants of Bishapur under the leadership of Shahrag's brother declared independence, but were defeated. However the date for this revolt mains disputed, as the Persian historian al- Baladhuri states that it occurred in 646. In 648, 'Abd-Allah ibn al-'Ash'ari forced the governor of Estakhr, Mahak, to surrender the city. However, this was not the final conquest of Estakhr, as the inhabitants of the city would later rebel in 649/50 while its newly appointed governor, 'Abd-Allah ibn 'Amir was trying to capture Gor. The military governor of the province, 'Ubayd Allah ibn Ma'mar, was defeated and killed. In 650/1, the Sasanian emperor Yazdegerd III went to Estakhr and tried to plan an organized resistance against the Arabs, and after some time he went to Gor, but Estakhr failed to put up a strong resistance, and was soon sacked by the Arabs, who killed over 40,000 defenders. The Arabs then quickly seized Gor, Kazerun and Siraf, while Yazdegerd III fled to Kirman. Thus ended the Muslim conquest of Pars, however, the inhabitants of the province would later several times rebel against the Arabs.

As her world changes forever, Katherine must navigate into a world filled with secrets and scoundrels. It is not immediately clear what her Uncle really wants from her. She was always told that the Duke hated her family, so when he makes her look ridiculous in front of the City by letting her dress like a boy and swing a sword, Katherine is determined not to let him ruin her future.  Reception  The Privilege of the Sword was well received by critics, winning the 2007 Locus Award for Best Fantasy Novel. It was also nominated for the 2007 Nebula Award and the 2007 Gaylactic Spectrum Award. Robert N. Tilendis from Green Man Review said in his review, \\"If it predecessor Swordspoint is a perfect gem, The Privilege of the Sword is the gem in its full setting: elegant, wicked, funny, intelligent, and fluent.\\"  Riverside series  * Swordspoint (1987) * The Fall of the Kings (2002) (co- authored with Delia Sherman) * The Privilege of the Sword (2006) * The Man with the Knives (2010)  References   External links  * Official blog of Ellen Kushner Category:2006 American novels Category:LGBT speculative fiction novels Category:2000s LGBT novels Category:American LGBT novels ","title":"The Privilege of the Sword"},{"id":"43639346","text":"is a side-scrolling shoot 'em up video game released for the MSX computer in 1987 by Konami. The game is a sequel to Nemesis, the MSX version of Gradius, but is unrelated to the arcade game Gradius II (which used the Roman numeral 'II'). This version was ported to the X68000 computer under the name , with some graphical and aural enhancements. In a departure from other games, instead of controlling Vic Viper, the available ship is called Metalion. Unlike other titles, this game has a heavier focus on story, which is told by cut-scenes. The gameplay is mostly unchanged from the rest of the series, though there are some powerups that temporally gives the ship some enhancements. Also, when the bosses are being defeated, if the Metalion flies where they are, a mini-level can be accessed in order to obtain new permanent upgrades, if the mini levels are successfully cleared. Plot The Director General of Space Science Agency Dr. Venom was exiled to Planet Sard for a failed coup d'√©tat. In the year 6665, he escapes and invades Planet Nemesis and the seven planets it controls with the help of Bacterion. The Nemesis High Council sends James Burton, ex-pilot of the Vic Viper, to pilot Metalion and attack Dr. Venom and the Bacterion invaders. The game takes place during the year 6666. Nemesis '90 Kai This X68000 port is essentially an enhanced remake of Nemesis 2 with graphical quality on par with Gradius III. It includes two new stages exclusive to this version of the game, and four new bosses (two of which replace the rematches fought in the MSX version.) Some people still prefer the original for its charm and color scheme. Ports Aside from being remade as Nemesis '90 Kai, Nemesis 2 was also ported to mobile phones in 2006 and Sony PSP in 2007 as part of the Salamander Portable collection. They were re-released for Wii's Virtual Console in 2009, for Project EGG in 2015, and for Wii U Virtual Console in 2016 in Japan.

It is located on the Thomaswall in the south of the town and was built in 1517. On this side Goslar was strongly dominated by the nearby hill of Rammelsberg, which would have made a good location for positioning enemy guns in the event of an attack on the town; the town fortifications therefore needed the extra protection of a strong battery tower at this point. The stonework of Goslar's Zwinger was predominantly made of sandstone quarried from the Sudmerberg northeast of Goslar and mortared with burnt lime. Because lime burning was still in not fully developed, the builders mixed the mortar with horsehair, quark, goat's milk and ox blood to harden it fully. Immediately under the corbelling are two sandstone tablets in the wall bearing the coats of arms of the German Empire and the town of Goslar and the inscription \\"Anno dm M D X V II\\". The original conical roof was dismantled in 1857. With a wall thickness at the base of 6.5 metres, a diameter of 26 metres and a height of 20 metres, the Zwinger is one of the strongest surviving and utilised defensive towers in Europe. The Goslar Zwinger has been privately owned since 1 August 1936. Today it houses a restaurant on the ground floor, three holiday apartments on the middle floor and a small museum of medieval weapons, armour and torture implements on the top floor.

In 1876, he entered the √âcole des Beaux-arts, where he studied under Alexandre Cabanel. Four years later, he was a candidate for the Prix de Rome, but it was discovered that he was still a Belgian citizen, so he returned to Mouscron, took temporary lodgings and applied for the Prix de Rome (Belgium) from the Royal Academy of Fine Arts (Antwerp). He was awarded the prize in 1879 and received a gold medal for his painting The Aduatuci Sold as Slaves.Dictionnaire des peintres belges He spent the next five years travelling extensively throughout Spain and Italy, with visits to Algeria and Tunisia, painting prolifically all the way. In 1885, he returned to Roubaix and moved in with his parents. By 1893, he had become successful enough that he could afford to build his own house. He specialized in portraits, but also painted scenes from the daily life of Roubaix and the surrounding region. Between 1879 and 1926, he exhibited in the foreign section at the Salon twenty-nine times.

Taxonomy It has been suggested that the species represents a junior synonym of Tor tambra. T. tambra, T. tambroides and T. douronensis may be synonymous.. Distribution These fish have been found throughout Southeast Asia, ranging from Thailand in the Chao Phraya and Mekong River basins to the Greater Sunda Islands. The species has been reported in Burma. The type locality of Tor tambroides is the Indonesian island of Sumatra. Ecology The species is omnivorous, sometimes eating toxic fruits when the streams it inhabits flood the forest; this may make them temporarily inedible. During the rainy season, juveniles migrate downstream. After 2 months, matured adults travel back upstream to spawn at the headwaters in the dry season. Conservation While the species is not currently assigned a conservation status by the IUCN due to lack of data, overfishing is assumed to threaten the wild population. The empurau, as the species is known in Malaysia, is reportedly the most expensive edible fish in the country and has been known to fetch up to RM1800 per kilogram of the fish. Aquaculture Empurau can be grown in captivity. The fish require moving, well-oxygenated water. They should be fed on various fruits and seeds to simulate their natural diet. Artificial hormones may be necessary to induce reproduction.

Background  Ben-Haim started composing the piece at the end of August 1939 and completed it at the end of June 1940. This is the period after his immigration to Israel, and the end of the days of the fall of France. The composition of the piece is about \\"the desire to compose a large-scale composition in the spirit of our people and country for our Eretz Israel Orchestra... the terrible rampage of the underworld forces must have had a powerful impact on my composition (at least on its first movement, and to some extent also on its last). Nevertheless, this composition is nothing but absolute pure music...\\"  Structure  The piece has three movements: # Allegro energico‚Äîaccording to Yehoash Hirschberg, the first theme, which is characterized by rhetorical expression of excitement and storm in the exposition, changes its nature into pastoral lyricism. The second theme, which is festive and wondering in exposition, becomes a military march. The movement is organized into long divisions, each of which features a climax, and decays slowly. The descending augmented second motive functions as an expression of lament and the pain of the Jewish prayer. # Molto calmo e cantabile‚Äîis based on a long melodic line presenting the movement's motif material. The final part of the theme is a quote from a traditional song motif of Persian Jews I shall lift my eyes to the mountains, arranged by Ben-Haim for Bracha Tzfira in the beginning of April 1940. # Presto con fuoco‚Äîabove a constant tarantella rhythm are two contrasting ideas: a quote from the choir part of the first finale of Ben- Haim's great work Yoram, followed by a syncopated hora dance.

The under 18 event (U18) is held every year, although in every fourth year, starting with 2010, the event is part of the Youth Olympic Games. The open events are held every other year, in even-numbered years, starting in 2012. Rules The game includes many elements of the traditional five on five game with some exceptions: The rules listed below are the current 3x3 rules, which have changed several times since the creation of the game. * Half-court‚ÄîThe game is played at a single basket, or one end of a two basket court. The game is typically played outdoors, except when weather conditions require the game to move indoors. * Team size‚Äîa team consists of four players, only three of which are on the playing court at one time. A team can play with two players, but must start a game with three players able to play. * Initial possession‚Äîcoin flip; winner of the flip can choose to take possession at the start of the game, or at the start of a potential overtime * Time‚Äî10 minutes. The clock runs continuously, except for timeouts. * End of game‚Äîa game is over if one team scores 21 (or more) points, or at the end of regulation time if not tied ** In the original rules, when the scoring was different (see \\"Scoring\\" entry), the game ended at 33 points. This was reflected in the original name of 3x3, \\"FIBA 33\\". * Overtime‚Äîfirst team to score two points wins. * Timeouts‚ÄîOne 30-second timeout * Shot clock‚Äî12 seconds * Scoring‚Äîbaskets count for one point, except those beyond the arc which are worth two points. Foul shots are worth a single point. ** In the original rules, scoring was identical to that of the full-court game. * Possession change‚Äîafter a score, a steal or defensive rebound, team must dribble or pass the ball outside the arc. * Held ball‚Äîno alternating possession rule or jump ball; the defensive team is always awarded possession. * Free throws‚ÄîOne free throw on all personal fouls, except two free throws in the following situations: ** If fouled during an unsuccessful shot attempt from behind the arc. ** Opponent has committed 7 or more team fouls in the game. Team fouls 10 and greater are treated as technical fouls (see immediately below). ** Technical or unsportsmanlike fouls, after which the non-fouling team receives possession of the ball. * Foul limit‚Äîno limit on personal fouls per player, seven per team. A player who commits two unsportsmanlike fouls is disqualified. * Substitution procedure‚Äîplayer leaves the court, crossing the end line opposite the basket, and makes physical contact with the substitute. No action by table officials is required. For rules not specifically covered in the 3x3 rule list, the FIBA rules for five on five apply.

The players selected for the team were: * Briyona Canty * Andraya Carter * Amber Henson * Kiah Stokes Stokes led the team in scoring in the first game against Angola. She scored 12 points, to help the team win 20‚Äì8. She went on to score 19 points in the game against the host country Singapore, helping the team to win 34‚Äì11. Henson took over the scoring leadership ant he third game, with 14 points in a 33‚Äì6 win over Germany. The USA team then went on to beat Belarus and Korea, but was challenged in the next game against Australia. The USA had a 15‚Äì7 lead, but Australia tied the game in regulation and went on to win in overtime. The final game was against Canada for the bronze medal. Canty was the scoring leader with 15 points, and the USA won 34‚Äì16 to secure the bronze medal finish. 2011 U18 Following the inaugural 3x3 event at the Youth Olympics, in 2011, FIBA held the first 3x3 U18 (Youth) World Championship For Women. The event was held in Rimini, Italy, 9‚Äì11 September 2011. The teams no longer had coaches, but did have USA Basketball representative as a team leader. Jamie Carey served as the team leader in 2011. The players selected for the team were: * Kaela Davis * Rebecca Greenwell * Linnae Harper * Taya Reimer The USA team won their first three games easily, reaching 21 points before the opposition reached double-digits. However, in the third game, against Guam, Reimer injured her right ankle and was unable to play in any further contests. With only four players, this meant the remaining three players had to play all minutes without a substitution. The next game was against Italy, and the USA team won, but by a much closer score than in previous contests, 16‚Äì13. The three-player team then took on and defeated Sweden and India. This qualified them for the medal rounds. In the quarterfinals against the Czech Republic, the game went to double-overtime, but the USA team emerged victorious with a 25‚Äì23 win. The win sent the team to the semi-finals against Italy, a team the USA had defeated in a close match earlier. However, less than two minutes into the game, Greenwell suffered a knee injury. The game was delayed for 90 minutes, but Greenwell was unable to continue. The game was restarted, with the USA team fielding only two players against Italy's three players. Despite the handicap, the USA team took the game to overtime, but lost in the sudden death period. The team was scheduled to play against Japan for the bronze medal, but forfeited due to the injuries and finished in fourth place. A team can finish with two players, but must have three players to start a game. FIBA decided to award the team honorary bronze medals to recognize the effort. 2012 Open The first FIBA 3x3 World Championship For Women was held in Athens, Greece, 23‚Äì26 August 2012. The original team chosen to represent the USA included: * Skylar Diggins * Bria Hartley * Chiney Ogwumike * Alyssa Thomas However, Thomas was unable to compete, so she was replaced by Ann Strother Strother was in nursing school. but had participated in the 3x3 tournament on a different team.

The second FIBA 3x3 U18 (Youth) World Championship For Women was held in Alcobendas, Spain, 28‚Äì30 September 2012. The team which qualified for the event had the following players: * Kaela Davis * Diamond DeShields * Erica McCall * Brianna Turner Davis was the only player with prior experience in international competition. The games are intended to be played outdoors, but rain forced the games indoors for the first two days. The USA team won their first four games easily. In the second match of the second day, the USA faced China. Both DeShields and Davis fouled out, leaving McCall and Turner to play two on three. They took the game to overtime, but fell to China 13‚Äì12. Despite the loss, the team was still the number one seed for the medal rounds. The USA faced Estonia in the quarterfinals, and won 21‚Äì15. This set up a semifinal game against Australia, which the USA team won 21‚Äì13. The gold medal game was against the host team, Spain. Although Spain scored first, the USA team took a lead and never relinquished it, winning the game 21‚Äì13 to win the first ever gold medal for the US in U18 3x3 event. 2013 U18 The third FIBA 3x3 U18 (Youth) World Championship For Women was held in Jakarta, Indonesia, 26‚Äì29 September 2013.

Route description SR 180 begins at an intersection with US 1A about northwest of downtown Ellsworth. It travels north along Wittum Road through a light industrial park before heading into a more wooded area paralleling the Union River on its west bank. About from here, it meets Mariaville Road, a former alignment of SR 180, and travels along the west shore of Graham Lake passing small houses along the way. It crosses the outlet from Green Lake where the Green Lake National Fish Hatchery, operated by the United States Fish and Wildlife Service, is located. As it nears the Ellsworth‚ÄìOtis corporate line, SR 180 passes to the east of Hopkins Hill. Upon entering the town of Otis, the road passes through a small settlement titled Fletchers Lodge where a general store and an elementary school are located. Numerous roads towards the west lead to Beech Hill Pond. In this area, SR 180 meets the southern terminus of SR 181 (Mariaville Road) which heads north towards Mariaville. North of SR 181, SR 180's route becomes more winding and heading in a more northwesterly direction. After passing the settlement of Otis, makes additional curves including a sharp curve to the north at Rocky Nubble Road. The road leaves Hancock County and passes into Penobscot County within the town of Clifton. Shortly after the county line, the road crosses the summit of Rebel Hill (elevation ) and descends passing between other hills. As the road begins to flatten in grade, some houses dot the sides of the road before SR 180 enters the community of Clifton Corners and ends at SR 9. History When highway was first designated, SR 180's southern terminus was at the same location as SR 179's southern terminus at US 1A in Ellsworth. The two roads had a concurrency before SR 180 split towards the west and SR 179 continuing along the east shore of Graham Lake towards Waltham. SR 180 crossed the Union River just downstream of the dam holding back Graham Lake before it curved to the north and follows what is now its current alignment. In 2007, the bridge that carried SR 180 received a failing grade based on an inspection of the bridge. As a temporary measure, the Maine Department of Transportation constructed a single-lane Bailey bridge on top of the existing structure. Construction started on the realignment of SR 180 in 2012. The new road, which required the construction of a small bridge over Grey's Brook, opened on July 29, 2013, about three months ahead of schedule. The former route between SR 179 and the current route became a pair of dead-end roads with the bridge being closed off.

They were run ostensibly to house \\"fallen women\\", an estimated 30,000 of whom were confined in these institutions in Ireland. In 1993, a mass grave containing 155 corpses was uncovered in the convent grounds of one of the laundries. This led to media revelations about the operations of the secretive institutions. A formal state apology was issued in 2013, and a ¬£50 million compensation scheme for survivors was set up by the Irish Government. The religious orders which operated the laundries have rejected activist demands that they financially contribute to this programme. History The Dublin Magdalen Asylum (sometimes called Magdalen Asylum for Penitent Females) on Lower Leeson Street was the first such institution in Ireland. It was a Church of Ireland-run institution, and accepted only Protestant women. It was founded in 1765 by Lady Arabella Denny. Ireland's Catholic-run Magdalene asylums survived the longest. Ireland's Magdalene laundries were quietly supported by the state, and operated by religious communities for more than two hundred years. On laundries, James Smith asserts that the \\"Irish variety took on a distinct character\\".Smith xiv Inmates were required to work, primarily in laundries, since the facilities were self-supporting. Andrea Parrot and Nina Cummings wrote, \\"The cost of violence, oppression, and brutalization of women is enormous\\" and in their struggle to survive, the inmates suffered not only physically, but spiritually and emotionally.Parrot, Cummings 50 In Belfast the Church of Ireland-run Ulster Magdalene Asylum was founded in 1839 on Donegall Pass. Similar institutions were run by Catholics on Ormeau Road and by Presbyterians on Whitehall Parade.Government, politics and institutions in Belfast in the early twentieth century ‚Äì National Archives of Ireland Fallen women In the late 18th century, the term \\"fallen women\\" primarily referred to prostitutes, but by the end of the 19th century, Magdalene laundries were filled with many different kinds of women, including girls who were \\"not prostitutes at all,\\" but either \\"seduced women\\" or women who had yet to engage in sexual activity. According to Frances Finnegan, author of Do Penance or Perish: A Study of Magdalen Asylums in Ireland, \\"Missionaries were required to approach prostitutes and distribute religious tracts, designed to be read in 'sober' moments and divert women from their vicious lives.\\"^ Finnegan 15 Furthermore, \\"the consignment even of genuine prostitutes\\" to these laundries \\"seldom reduced their numbers on the streets, any more than did an individual prostitute's death,\\" because, according to Finnegan, \\"so long as poverty continued, and the demand for public women remained, such losses were easily replaced.\\" Raftery wrote that the institutions were failing to achieve their supposed objective: \\"the institutions had little impact on prostitution over the period,\\" and yet they were continuing to multiply and expand due to their self-supporting free labour. Since they were not paid, Raftery asserted, \\"it seems clear that these girls were used as a ready source of free labour for these laundry businesses.\\"Raftery 162. Additionally, the state of Ireland and its government were heavily intertwined with religion. Finnegan wrote: Finnegan wrote that based on historical records, the religious institutes had motivations other than simply wanting to curtail prostitution; these multiple motivations led to the multiplication of these facilities.^ Finnegan 10‚Äì11 According to Finnegan, as the motivations started to shift from a need to maintain social and moral order within the bounds of patriarchal structure to a desire to continue profiting from a free workforce, Magdalen laundries became a part of a large structure of suppression. With the multiplication of these institutions and the subsequent and \\"dramatic rise\\" in the number of beds available within them, Finnegan wrote that the need to staff the laundries \\"became increasingly urgent.\\" This urgency, Finnegan claims, resulted in a new definition of \\"fallen\\" women: one that was much less precise and was expanding to include any women who appeared to challenge traditional notions of Irish morality. She further asserted that this new definition resulted in even more suffering, \\"especially among those increasing numbers who were not prostitutes but unmarried mothers‚Äîforced to give up their babies as well as their lives.\\"^ Finnegan 28^ Smith 42 And as this concept of \\"fallen\\" expanded, so did the facilities, in both physical size and role in society. Women were branded as both a mother and a criminal if they happened to have a child out of wedlock. The choices the women at the time had were very limited. They had no social welfare system; therefore, many resorted to prostitution or entered these mother and child homes, also known as Magdalen Laundries.Smith, James M, Irelands Magdalen Laundries and the Nations Architecture of Confinement, Manchester University p Press, 2007 Expansion Several religious institutes established even more Irish laundries, reformatories and industrial schools, sometimes all together on the same plot of land, with the aim to \\"save the souls primarily of women and children\\".^ Raftery 18. Examples were Sisters of Our Lady of Charity of Refuge and the Congregation of the Sisters of Mercy, who ran the largest laundries in Dublin. These \\"large complexes\\" became a \\"massive interlocking system‚Ä¶carefully and painstakingly built up‚Ä¶over a number of decades\\"; and consequently, Magdalen laundries became part of Ireland's \\"larger system for the control of children and women\\" (Raftery 18). Women and \\"bastard\\" children were both \\"incarcerated for transgressing the narrow moral code of the time\\" and the same religious congregations managed the orphanages, reformatory schools and laundries.^ Raftery 19. Thus, these facilities \\"all helped sustain each other ‚Äì girls from the reformatory and industrial schools often ended up working their entire lives in the Magdalen laundries\\". Almost all the institutions were run by female religious congregations,\\" i.e. sisters, and were scattered throughout the country \\"in prominent locations in towns and cities\\". In this way, according to Raftery, they were powerful and pervasive, able to effectively control the lives of women and children from \\"all classes\\".Raftery 284 This second incarnation of Magdalen laundries vastly differed from the first incarnation, due to their \\"longevity\\" and \\"their diverse community of female inmates, including hopeless cases, mental defectives‚Ä¶[and] transfers from industrial and reformatory schools\\".^ Smith xv, xvi These particular institutions intentionally shared \\"overriding characteristics, including a regime of prayer, silence, work in a laundry, and a preference for permanent inmates\\", which, as Smith notes, \\"contradicts the religious congregations' stated mission to protect, reform, and rehabilitate\\". As this expansion was taking place and these laundries were becoming a part of a large network of institutions, the treatment of the girls was becoming increasingly violent and abusive. According to Finnegan and Smith, the asylums became \\"particularly cruel\\", \\"more secretive\\" in nature and \\"emphatically more punitive\\". Though these women had committed no crime and had never been put on trial, their indefinite incarceration was enforced by locked doors, iron gates and prison guards in the form of apathetic sisters. By 1920, according to Smith, Magdalen laundries had almost entirely abandoned claims of rehabilitation and instead, were \\"seamlessly incorporated into the state's architecture of containment\\". According to historian Frances Finnegan, in the beginning of these asylums' existence, because many of the women had a background as prostitutes, the women (who were called \\"children\\") were regarded as \\"in need of penitence\\", and until the 1970s were required to address all staff members as \\"mother\\" regardless of age. To enforce order and maintain a monastic atmosphere, the inmates were required to observe strict silence for much of the day. As the phenomenon became more widespread, it extended beyond prostitution to petty criminals, orphans, mentally disabled women and abused girls. A 2013 report made by an inter-departmental committee chaired by Senator Martin McAleese found no evidence of unmarried women giving birth in the asylum.\\"Report of the Inter-Departmental Committee to establish the facts of State involvement with the Magdalen Laundries\\". Department of Justice and Equality. Retrieved 29 June 2013. Page citations needed. Even young girls who were considered too promiscuous and flirtatious, or too beautiful, were sent to an asylum by their families. This paralleled the practice in state-run lunatic asylums in Britain and Ireland in the same period, where many people with alleged \\"social dysfunction\\" were committed to asylums. Without a family member on the outside who could vouch for them, many incarcerated individuals stayed in the asylums for the rest of their lives, many taking religious vows. Given Ireland's historically conservative sexual values, Magdalen asylums were a generally accepted social institution until well into the second half of the twentieth century. They disappeared with changes in sexual mores‚Äîor, as Finnegan suggests, as they ceased to be profitable: \\"Possibly the advent of the washing machine has been as instrumental in closing these laundries as have changing attitudes.\\"Finnegan. Numbers of inmates An estimated 30,000 women were confined in these institutions in the 19th and 20th centuries, about 10,000 of whom were admitted since Ireland's independence in 1922. Smith asserts that \\"we do not know how many women resided in the Magdalen institutions\\" after 1900. Vital information about the women's circumstances, the number of women, and the consequences of their incarceration is unknown. \\"We have no official history for the Magdalen asylum in twentieth-century Ireland\\", Smith wrote.^ Smith 138 Due to the religious institutes' \\"policy of secrecy\\", their penitent registers and convent annals remain closed to this day, despite repeated requests for information.Raftery 9Smith xvi As a direct result of these missing records and the religious institutes' commitment to secrecy, Magdalen laundries can only exist \\"at the level of story rather than history\\". Though Ireland's last Magdalen asylum imprisoned women until 1996, there are no records to account for \\"almost a full century\\" of women who now \\"constitute the nation's disappeared\\", who were \\"excluded, silenced, or punished\\", and whom Smith says \\"did not matter or matter enough\\" to a society that \\"sought to negate and render invisible their challenges\\" to conceived notions of moral order. Mass grave Magdalene seat, St Stephen's Green Park, Dublin In Dublin in 1993, the Sisters of Our Lady of Charity had lost money in share dealings on the stock exchange; to cover their losses, they sold part of the land in their convent to a property developer. This led to the discovery of 133 corpses in a mass grave. The Sisters arranged to have the remains cremated and reburied in another mass grave at Glasnevin Cemetery, splitting the cost of the reburial with the developer who had bought the land. It later transpired that there were 22 more corpses than the sisters had applied for permission to exhume. In all, 155 corpses were exhumed and cremated.Ryan, Carol. \\"Irish Church's Forgotten Victims Take Case to U.N.\\" The New York Times, 25 May 2011. Though not initially reported, this eventually triggered a public scandal, bringing unprecedented attention to the secretive institutions. In 1999, former asylum inmates Mary Norris, Josephine McCarthy and Mary-Jo McDonagh gave accounts of their treatment. The 1997 Channel 4 documentary Sex in a Cold Climate interviewed former inmates of Magdalene Asylums who testified to continued sexual, psychological and physical abuse while being isolated from the outside world for an indefinite amount of time. Allegations about the conditions in the convents and the treatment of the inmates were made into an award-winning 2002 film The Magdalene Sisters, written and directed by Peter Mullan. A number of campaigns and remembrance services have been undertaken to request the identification and reburial of those buried in mass graces.https://www.irishmirror.ie/news/irish- news/politics/give-back-mothers-body-woman-6075388 https://www.irishmirror.ie/news/irish-news/cork-womans-quest-move- mothers-9708844.amp For example, Mary Collins (herself an survivor of the industrial school system together), has campaigned with her daughter Laura Angela Collins for the right to the removal of her mother's remains from a mass grave which is owned by the Religious Sisters of Charity.https://www.independent.ie/irish-news/news/industrial-school-survivor- slapped-kicked-and-forced-to-sleep-with-pigs-for-snoring-31549818.html In June 2011, Mary Raftery wrote in The Irish Times that in the early 1940s, some Irish state institutions, such as the army, switched from commercial laundries to \\"institutional laundries\\" (Magdalene laundries). At the time, there was concern in the D√°il that workers in commercial laundries were losing jobs because of the switch to institutional laundries. Oscar Traynor, Minister for Defence, said the contracts with the Magdalene laundries \\"contain a fair wages clause\\", though the women in those laundries did not receive wages. The Irish Times revealed that a ledger listed √Åras an Uachtar√°in, Guinness, Clerys, the Gaiety Theatre, Dr Steevens' Hospital, the Bank of Ireland, the Department of Defence, the Departments of Agriculture and Fisheries, CI√â, Portmarnock Golf Club, Clontarf Golf Club and several leading hotels amongst those who used a Magdalene laundry. This was unearthed by Steven O' Riordan, a young Irish film-maker who directed and produced a documentary, The Forgotten Maggies. It is the only Irish-made documentary on the subject and was launched at The Galway Film Fleadh 2009. It was screened on the Irish television station TG4 in 2011, attracting over 360,000 viewers. The documentary's website notes that a group called Magdalene Survivors Together was set up after the release of the documentary, because so many Magdalene women came forward after its airing. The women who appeared in the documentary were the first Magdalene women to meet with Irish government officials. They brought national and international attention to the subject. Reparations Since 2001, the Irish government has acknowledged that women in the Magdalene laundries were victims of abuse. However, the Irish government has resisted calls for investigation and proposals for compensation; it maintains the laundries were privately run and abuses at the laundries are outside the government's remit. In contrast to these claims, evidence exists that Irish courts routinely sent women convicted of petty crimes to the laundries, the government awarded lucrative contracts to the laundries without any insistence on protection and fair treatment of their workers, and Irish state employees helped keep laundry facilities stocked with workers by bringing women to work there and returning escaped workers. 2013 publication of inquiry report Having lobbied the government of Ireland for two years for investigation of the history of the Magdalene laundries, advocacy group Justice for Magdalenes presented its case to the United Nations Committee Against Torture, alleging that the conditions within the Magdalene laundries and the exploitation of their labourers amounted to human-rights violations. On 6 June 2011, the panel urged Ireland to \\"investigate allegations that for decades women and girls sent to work in Catholic laundries were tortured.\\" In response the Irish government set up a committee chaired by Senator Martin McAleese, to establish the facts of the Irish state's involvement with the Magdalene laundries.BBC: Irish PM: Magdalene laundries product of harsh Ireland, 5 February 2013 Following the 18-month inquiry, the committee publishedMagdalen Final Report, February 2013 its report on 5 February 2013, finding \\"significant\\" state collusion in the admission of thousands of women into the institutions. The report found over 11,000 women had entered laundries since 1922. Significant levels of verbal abuse to women inside was reported but there were no suggestions of regular physical or sexual abuse. The report also noted that, according to its analysis, the laundries were not generally highly profitable.Report of the Inter-Departmental Committee to establish the facts of State involvement with the Magdalen Laundries, Chapter 20 Elderly survivors said they would go on hunger strike over the failure of successive Irish governments to set up a financial redress scheme for the thousands of women enslaved there. Taoiseach Enda Kenny, while professing sorrow at the abuses revealed, did not issue an immediate apology, prompting criticism from other members of D√°il √âireann. Kenny promised \\"there would be a full D√°il debate on the report in two weeks' time when people had an opportunity to read the report\\". Survivors were critical that an apology had not been immediately forthcoming. State apology and compensation On 19 February 2013, the Taoiseach Enda Kenny issued a formal state apology. He described the laundries as \\"the nation's shame\\" and said, > \\"Therefore, I, as Taoiseach, on behalf of the State, the government and our > citizens deeply regret and apologise unreservedly to all those women for the > hurt that was done to them, and for any stigma they suffered, as a result of > the time they spent in a Magdalene Laundry.\\"Text of Taoiseach's apology in > the D√°il Oireachtas √âireann, 2013-02-19. The Taoiseach also outlined part of the compensation package to be offered to victims of the Magdalene Laundries. He stated: > \\"That's why the Government has today asked the President of the Law Reform > Commission Judge John Quirke to undertake a three month review and to make > recommendations as to the criteria that should be applied in assessing the > help that the government can provide in the areas of payments and other > supports, including medical card, psychological and counselling services and > other welfare needs.\\" Catholic reaction In February 2013, a few days after the publication of the McAleese Report, two sisters gave an interview for RT√â Radio 1 under conditions of anonymity for themselves and their institute. They described the Irish media coverage of the abuse at the laundries (which they claimed not to have participated in), as a \\"one-sided anti-Catholic forum\\". They displayed no remorse for the institutes' past: \\"Apologize for what? Apologize for providing a service? We provided a free service for the country\\". They complained that \\"all the shame of the era is being dumped on the religious orders... the sins of society are being placed on us\\". On hearing the interview, a survivors' group announced to the press that they were \\"shocked, horrified and enormously upset\\" by the sisters' portrayal of events. In a detailed commentary by the president of the Catholic League, a U.S. advocacy group, published in July 2013, it is claimed that \\"No one was imprisoned, nor forced against her will to stay. There was no slave labor, ... It‚Äôs all a lie.\\" The inmates are described as \\"prostitutes, and women seen as likely candidates for the 'world‚Äôs oldest profession'. Unmarried women, especially those who gave birth out-of-wedlock, were likely candidates. Contrary to what has been reported, the laundries were not imposed on these women: they were a realistic response to a growing social problem [prostitution].\\" In 1955, while the abuse of inmates was still occurring, the English writer Halliday Sutherland was touring Ireland to collect material for his book Irish Journey. When he applied for permission to visit the Galway asylum, Michael Browne, the local bishop, reluctantly granted him access only on condition that he allow his account to be censored by the Mother Superior.Halliday Sutherland, Irish Journey, G. Bles, 1956 , 9787470000105 The uncensored manuscript was discovered by Sutherland's grandson in 2013 and published in 2014. The religious institutes, the Sisters of Mercy, Sisters of Our Lady of Charity of the Good Shepherd, and Sisters of Charity, have refused demands from the Irish government, the UN Committee on the Rights of the Child and the UN Committee Against Torture to contribute to the compensation fund for surviving victims, an estimated 600 of whom were still alive in March 2014. In 2011 a monument was erected in Ennis at the site of the former Industrial School and Magdalene laundry in appreciation of the Sisters of Mercy. As recently as 2015, Ennis Municipal Local Council felt confident enough (despite the findings of the McAleese and Ryan reports) to rename a road (which ran through the site of the former Industrial School and Laundry) in honour of the Sisters of Mercy. There are conflicting views to the appropriateness of these gestures in this County Clare town. Media representations =The Magdalene Sisters= The Magdalene Sisters, a 2002 film by Peter Mullan, is centered on four young women incarcerated in a Dublin Magdalen Laundry from 1964 to 1968. The film is loosely based on and \\"largely inspired\\" by the 1998 documentary Sex in a Cold Climate, which documents four survivors' accounts of their experiences in Ireland's Magdalen institutions.Smith, James. Ireland's Magdalen Laundries and the Nation's Architecture of Containment.

Despite the building's former name, the main entrance is in Whitechapel High Street, and the postal address is 114 Whitechapel High Street. The building opened in 2014. The developer was Redrow;Redrow London: One Commercial Street, Aldgate  Redrow London, accessdate: 24/08/2014 and the architects were Sigma Seifert.Building Design: Carbuncle Cup: One Commercial Street, by Sigma Seifert Architects  Opinion  Building Design, accessdate: 24/08/2014 The contractor was John Sisk & Son, a member of the Sisk Group. Construction had been suspended in 2008, but with the recovery in the London housing market, the development was purchased by Redrow. As well as 207 apartments, there is 110,000 sq ft of offices over six floors, retail space on the ground floor and car parking in the basement. The ground floor incorporates one of the western entrances to Aldgate East tube station. Design The developer Redrow described the building as \\"like a blade of light, its glass fin protruding dramatically to add a sculptural quality to Redrow London's first flagship development\\". Building Design, however, commented: \\"First flagship development? Please God let it also be their last. No one who can liken this incoherent hulk of ill-fitting glass sheets to a blade of light deserves to build again in such a sensitive location.\\" In July 2014, the building was nominated for the Carbuncle Cup, awarded for \\"the ugliest building in the United Kingdom completed in the last 12 months\\". The International Property Awards, on the other hand, honoured the building as \\"Best Residential High- Rise Development UK, 2013‚Äì14\\". The entrance lobby The entrance lobby is notable for incorporating a section of a London Underground C Stock train, used as a seating area. It displays \\"Aldgate East\\" as its destination. The unit bears the number 5721, which was the number of one of the final C Stock units to run on the Underground before they were withdrawn from service in 2014, but this is not its original number: the genuine 5721 is preserved at the London Transport Museum's Acton depot. Houblon Apartments and the \\"poor door\\" Entrance to Houblon Apartments in Tyne Street The Relay Building includes, in compliance with planning legislation, an element of \\"affordable housing\\". This part of the development has its own name, \\"Houblon Apartments\\"; and a separate entrance, at one side of the building in Tyne Street. In July 2014, an investigation by The Guardian newspaper ‚Äì commenting particularly on One Commercial Street ‚Äì noted a growing trend for new housing developments in London to include separate, segregated entrances of this kind, known as \\"poor doors\\". In November 2014, Vice reported that, \\"for the past 20 weeks, every Wednesday between 6PM and 7PM, a group of locals from the anarchist action group Class War have stood outside the slick glass carbuncle with a banner promising to 'devastate the avenues where the wealthy live' ‚Äì a nod to a 1915 quote from firebrand Chicago anarchist Lucy Parsons.\\" After 18 weeks, the developer Redrow disposed of the freehold of the building. A week later, a director of the new owners, Hondo Enterprises, agreed to meet with Class War, and they declared a temporary truce.

First described in full by George Bentham in 1876, said species are native to southern Mexico, Central America, Colombia and Peru. Amongst all four species, only Catoferia chiapensis are known to grow across a wide area, their growth recorded in southern Mexico, Guatemala, Peru and Belize. Growth of the other three variants is believed to be limited to Southern Mexico. The beginning of the genus Catoeria is thought trace back to the Cretaceous era, making it around 55 to 65 million years old.Davidse, G., M. Sousa S√°nchez, S. Knapp & F. Chiang Cabrera. 2012.

His unorthodox theories on electromagnetism are not recognized by the scientific community.  Biography  Pier Luigi Ighina studied in Milan Electronics and Radio Transmission and worked at Magneti Marelli, CGE (Compagnia Generale di Elettricit√†) and then at Ansaldo Lorenz in Genova. He claimed to be assistant of Guglielmo Marconi for a number of scientific findings. However, no official proof of these collaborations are known.  The Theory of \\"Magnetic Atom\\"  His theories involve the concept of the pulsing \\"Magnetic Atom\\" at the base of the matter. This \\"Magnetic Atom\\" could be scattered into magnetic monopoles, whose interactions are at the basis of life and matter. Waves of magnetic atoms are continuously exchanged between the Sun and the Earth, with a proper frequency and shape. Based on this claims, Ighina built some extravagant machines: in particular one for prevent earthquakes and one other to make it rain. However, Ighina did not patent any of his machines and findings.  Influences in Art  The famous Italian musician Franco Battiato cited directly the claims of Ighina in his album Pollution (1972).

The group was led by Colonel Hassan Hamada. It received U.S.-made BGM-71 TOW anti-tank missiles and was funded by the Supreme Military Council. History The background of the 101st Infantry Division lay within the Guardians of the Revolution group, a non-sectarian FSA group based in the Idlib Governorate that notably included religious minorities in its leadership positions. In June 2013, the Guardians of the Revolution merged with several other FSA groups under the authority of the Supreme Military Council to form the 33rd Infantry Division, led by Lieutenant Colonel Ammar Dayoub. The division claimed to have 1,700 fighters and its spokesman was Lieutenant Muhanad al-Ayssama, a Druze from Suwayda. Soon after its formation, Ahrar al-Sham expelled the 33rd Infantry Division from the frontlines with the Syrian Army along the Aleppo-Latakia highway in Idlib, declaring its refusal to fight alongside more secular FSA groups. After pressure on Ahrar al-Sham from other FSA groups, it permitted the 33rd Division to return to the front. On 5 July 2013, units of the 33rd Infantry Division were deployed to the town of al-Dana after fighters of the Islamic State of Iraq and the Levant reportedly opened fire on anti-ISIL protesters. Clashes broke out between the two groups, and resulted ISIL beheading a commander of the 33rd Division, and taking full control of the town. On 21 July 2014, the 101st Infantry Division suspended its cooperation with al- Qaeda's al-Nusra Front. On 7 September 2014, 101st Division allied with four other rebel groups, including the Knights of Justice Brigade, into a new formation called the 5th Corps. In February 2015, the al-Nusra Front attacked the 7th Special Forces Brigade of the 101st Division in the Idlib countryside and captured a large amount of weapons and other supplies. On 6 May 2015, along with 13 other Aleppo-based groups, it joined the Fatah Halab joint operations room. In December 2015 it merged with the Knights of Justice Brigade to form the Northern Division, but the 101st Division left the group in June 2016. On 14 October 2016, the 101st Infantry Division absorbed several smaller rebel groups and changed its name to the 21st Combined Force. In late 2016, Lt. Col. Ammar Dayoub joined the Free Idlib Army. In December 2016, he was kidnapped in the southern Idlib countryside. On 2 March 2017, his body was found in a mass grave of more than 150 rebels executed by Jund al-Aqsa. The 21st Combined Force appeared to be largely inactive, and its last statement was in January 2017. On 30 June 2017, military commanders of the 21st Combined Force, the 23rd Division, the Central Division, and the 1st Coastal Division signed the Geneva Call's \\"Deed of Agreement\\" pledging to protect children in the war, prohibit sexual violence, and prevent sexism. On 17 August 2017, Tahrir al-Sham executed Osama al-Khader, commander of the 21st Combined Force's Resolute Storm Brigade, after they accused him of communicating with Euphrates Shield groups, the Army of Revolutionaries, the Northern Democratic Brigade, and blasphemy. Stance on Israel The group's leadership stance on Israel can be described as hostile.

He has also choreographed new works for Miami City Ballet, Norwegian National Ballet, the BalletBoyz, English National Ballet, San Francisco Ballet, American Ballet Theatre, Royal New Zealand Ballet and The Royal Ballet School. Early life Scarlett was born in Ipswich, and started dancing aged four. He trained at the Linda Shipton School of Dancing, followed by The Royal Ballet Lower School, which he entered at the age of eight, and then the Upper School. Choreographer His first work for the main stage at Covent Garden was Asphodel Meadows in 2010. It was a work for 20 dancers set to Poulenc's Concerto for Two Pianos. In 2008 the work was commissioned by the Royal Ballet's then director, Monica Mason, who was eager to develop his choreographic abilities. Scarlett is the youngest choreographer to have a full-length ballet commissioned by the Royal Ballet. Edward Villella, the then director of Miami City Ballet, saw the dress rehearsal and commissioned Scarlett there and then. Viscera's critically acclaimed premiere took place in January 2012. As well as further work for the Royal Ballet and Miami City Ballet, Scarlett has created new works for the Norwegian National Ballet, the BalletBoyz, English National Ballet, the San Francisco Ballet and American Ballet Theatre. In November 2012, aged 26, Scarlett gave up his dancing career as a first artist with The Royal Ballet, to become their first artist in residence, a post created especially for him by the Ballet's director, Kevin O'Hare. On 29 April 2014, Scarlett's Hummingbird, inspired by Philip Glass's Tirol Concerto for Piano and Orchestra premiered at the San Francisco Ballet. In its review, theartsdesk critic thought that it stood \\"above offerings from Wheeldon, Morris and Liang,\\" and that Scarlett created \\"a fabulous, compelling visual and emotional world ... stirring stuff, and beautiful.\\" In January 2020, he was suspended by the Royal Ballet amid allegations of sexual misconduct against his students. Although after investigation no evidence was found to corroborate the allegations and no criminal charges were bought against him.

It is at the head of the Salmon Falls River, which the Abenaki called Newichawannock, meaning \\"river with many falls\\". Begun in 1850 by the Great Falls Company to increase the water available for its mills in Somersworth, New Hampshire, the canal is unusual as it was built for strictly industrial purposes in an area remote from the actual industrial site. The canal forms the boundary between the states of New Hampshire and Maine, and is spanned by a stone bridge built at the same time. The canal and bridge, along with related artifacts, were listed on the National Register of Historic Places in 2014. Description and history The Newichawannock Canal is located between Great East Lake to the north and Horn Pond to the south, on the southern portion of the north-south border between Maine and New Hampshire. The canal is wide and about deep, and is lined with unmortared stone. An unmortared stone-arch bridge, built at the same time, carries Canal Road over the waterway. Also located in the area are piles of stone, apparently left over from the canal construction, and a second canal that lies submerged in Great East Lake. Horn Pond is the source of the Salmon Falls River, a tributary of the Piscataqua River, both of which form the New Hampshire-Maine border south of the pond. The bridge over the canal A portion of the canal, June 2020 The Great Falls Company was founded in 1823 to operate textile mills using the water power of the Salmon Falls River at Somersworth, New Hampshire. By about 1860 the mill complex there had grown to include six large buildings and employed 1,500 workers. In order to increase water flow at the mills, the company purchased water rights at Great East Lake and Horn Pond, and began construction of the canal in the 1850s. Other mills, such as Cocheco Woolen Mills in East Rochester, benefited in subsequent decades. The canal was not completed until the 1860s due in part to the Civil War. The canal was built by Hiram Paul, a civil engineer who lived in Wakefield and operated a tavern. As of 2020, the northern half of the canal is largely blocked by collapsed sides but the southern half is navigable, reached from Horn Pond.

(The term comes from ancient China, where colonist militias were also employed to defend imperial frontiers.) The first recruits in Japan were ex-samurai whose feudal lords who had opposed the Meiji forces and whose domains were therefore abolished, leaving them without gainful employment. Later recruits included commoners as well as samurai. History A tondenhei residence in Sapporo The Tokugawa Shogunate had encouraged Japanese to settle in Hokkaid≈ç, especially after Hakodate became a treaty port open to foreigners under the 1854 Convention of Kanagawa between Japan and the United States. After defeating the Tokugawa, the Meiji government created the (Colonization Office) for Hokkaid≈ç. The Kaitakushi recruited many foreign advisors (oyatoi gaikokujin) to help modernize the economy and in 1874 began recruiting ex-samurai to populate and defend the northern islands. In 1875, the first group of almost 200 ex-samurai and their families arrived in Hokkaid≈ç and settled in the Kotoni district of Sapporo. Within two years, more than 2,000 tondenhei families had arrived in Hokkaid≈ç. Tondenhei villages usually held between 150 and 220 families. Most of the villages were on the western side of the island, in Ishikari River valley near Sapporo and Takikawa, and in the fertile Kamikawa Basin upstream from Asahikawa. But there were also military colonies near strategic ports in the south and east, such as Muroran, Akkeshi, and Nemuro. In all, over 7,000 tondenhei families helped found about 40 villages on the island. The government furnished each soldier with a cold-weather uniform and each household with eight acres of land and a house with a Russian stove in it. All male settlers between 18 and 35 were assigned to regiments. As ex-samurai, they often had swords in addition to their military-issue firearms. They would farm during the summers and perform most of their military duties during the winter. Many samurai were unused to farming, especially raising such northern crops as beans and potatoes, but families worked together to adapt to the harsh climate. After the Kaitakushi was abolished in 1882, the Imperial Japanese Army assumed control of the units. In 1903 they incorporated them into the famous 7th Division (\\"Bear Division\\"), which distinguished itself in the Russo-Japanese War, in Nomonhan at the China‚ÄìMongolia border, and in the Guadalcanal Campaign.

He received his D.Sc. from the Technion-Israel Institute of Technology in 1964. He became the first full professor at BGU's new Department of Physics. He did significant theoretical work in the fields of cosmology, astrophysics, general and special relativity, gauge theory, and mathematical physics, authoring 4 books, co-authoring 4 others, and publishing 128 refereed research papers in various journals and forums, plus assorted other publications (146 in all). He is most notable for his work on gauge theory and his development of the theory of cosmological general relativity, which extends Albert Einstein's theory of general relativity from a four- dimensional spacetime to a five-dimensional space-velocity framework.  Biography  Carmeli was born in Baghdad, Iraq in 1933. However, he spent the majority of his life and career in Israel and the United States of America. In 1960, he received his Masters of Science from The Hebrew University of Jerusalem under the supervision of N. Zeldes. In 1964, he received his Doctor of Science from the Technion-Israel Institute of Technology in Haifa, Israel under the supervision of Nathan Rosen. After completion of his degree, he moved to the United States, where he stayed until 1972. From 1964 until 1967, he worked at Temple University and later at the University of Maryland, where he was an Assistant Professor. In 1967 he became a researcher (and later senior researcher) at the Aerospace Research Laboratory in Dayton, Ohio. He was twice recognized for outstanding work by the United States Air Force. In 1972, Carmeli then returned to Israel as an Associate Professor of Physics at Ben-Gurion University in the newly established Physics Department. In 1974, he was elevated to full professor, making him the first full professor in the Physics Department. During this period, from 1973 to 1977, he also served as the department's chairman. In 1979, he was made Albert Einstein Professor of Theoretical Physics, a title he held for the remaining 28 years of his life. The following year, he became the Director of the Center for Theoretical Physics at BGU, a position he held until 1989. From 1979 to 1982, he was the Vice President of the Israel Physical Society, and then became the President of the Society through 1985. Carmeli remained active in research in theoretical physics, as well as becoming involved in science on the world stage. He was a member of many scientific societies, including the American Physical Society, American Association for the Advancement of Science, and The New York Academy of Sciences, and was listed in both Who's Who in the World and Who's Who in Science and Technology. He actively refereed and reviewed hundreds of scientific works by noted scientists seeking publication in over a dozen scientific journals. He held visiting professorships at the C. N. Yang Institute of Theoretical Physics of the State University of New York at Stony Brook, the University of Maryland, the International Center for Theoretical Physics in Trieste, the Max Planck Institute for Astrophysics in Munich, the University of Massachusetts, Colgate University, Queen Mary College of the University of London, and the State University of Campinas in Brazil. He was invited four times by the Swedish Royal Academy of Sciences to nominate candidates for the Nobel Prize in Physics. He was also invited four times by the Wolf Foundation to nominate candidates for the Wolf Prize in Physics. Carmeli died in 2007 in Beer-Sheva, Israel.  Cosmological general relativity  In the 1990s, Carmeli developed a new cosmological theory called cosmological general relativity. He took Einstein's theory of general relativity and extended it into five dimensions, adding the radial velocity of galaxies expanding in the Hubble flow as the fifth dimension. This fifth dimension is known as space-velocity. He published his initial special relativistic version of the theory in 1997 in his book Cosmological Special Relativity: The Large-Scale Structure of Space, Time, and Velocity. He then developed the complete general relativistic theory called cosmological general relativity, publishing several papers on its implications over the next decade.

Early life and family Copcot was born in Calais, son of Adam Copcott, an English merchant. Athenae Cantabrigienses notes that John‚Äôs brother left a bequest to Corpus Christi College; that brother is almost certainly Reynold Copcott (known to be son of Adam Copcott and his wife Elizabeth Lynne) whose will dated 1598 did leave money to both Corpus Christi College and Trinity College. He was admitted as a scholar of Trinity College, Cambridge in 1562, and took his BA in 1566. Clerical career Copcot‚Äôs clerical career began at Cambridge, and he was licensed as one of the preachers of the university in 1576. Copcot was a defender of the Anglican Church and its hierarchy, particularly against dissenters and Puritans. In the 1580s, he preached in London in favour of the established church. The roles he held within the Church included non-resident rector of St Dunstan-in-the-East in London from 1580 to 1590 (in which role he sometimes represented the clergy of London in convocation); Prebendary in the church of Chichester from 1586 to 1590; Rector of Orwell, Cambridgeshire from 1586 to 1590; and Chaplain to John Whitgift, Archbishop of Canterbury. Academic career Copcot became a fellow of Trinity College in 1567 and took his MA in 1570. His specialty was as a critic in Latin and Greek and he had a reputation as a hard-working scholar and proponent of literary studies. He was awarded the degree of Bachelor of Divinity in 1577, and of Doctor of Divinity, the highest of the degrees awarded by the universities of Oxford and Cambridge, in 1582. Copcot was appointed as Vice-Chancellor of the University of Cambridge in 1586, and was the last Vice-Chancellor who was not already head of a college. His one-year term as Vice-Chancellor was characterised by conflict with radical Puritan interests at Christ College, Cambridge and elsewhere within the university, over which he was in communication with William Cecil, Baron Burghley, leading minister of Elizabeth I. As Vice-Chancellor, he took measures to suppress non- conformity; he also came into conflict with authorities representing the town. He succeeded Dr Robert Norgate as Master of Corpus Christi College, Cambridge on 6 November 1587, having been recommended by William Cecil. As with his term as Vice-Chancellor, his time in charge of the college was characterised by contention. He remained in the role until his death in early August 1590.

Gralnick says: \\"I have chosen to make jewelry, which is traditionally considered 'craft', and I do enjoy the processes and techniques that allow me to execute my work without technical faults. But 'craft' is only a means to an end for me, as it is for many artists. My desire to push the limits of jewelry and expand on them, to comment on its traditions and associations, is more the concern of any artist.\\"Grant Lewin, p 13  Education  Gralnick was born in New York on September 27, 1956. She received a BFA from Kent State University, Kent, Ohio in 1977 and an MFA degree in Metalsmithing from SUNY New Paltz in 1980 under Professors Kurt Matzdorf and Robert Ebendorf. After completing her graduate degree, she taught at Kent State University and Nova Scotia College of Art and Design before settling in New York City in 1982 to pursue her career as an artist. She was the Head of the Jewelry and Metals program at Parsons School of Design from 1991-2001. She moved to Madison, Wisconsin in 2001 and is Professor of Art at the University of Wisconsin- Madisonhttp://dm.education.wisc.edu/lbgralnick/pci/GralnickCVFinal2012WEB-1.pdf since 2007. Career Her breakthrough came with her Black Acrylic collection (1986-1989). Gralnick began making brooches from black acrylic sheet, using geometric forms described as recalling \\"machines and architecture\\" but that \\"also read as pure abstraction\\".Koplos, Janet and Bruce Metcalf, Makers: A History of American Studio Craft, University of North Carolina Press, 2010, pp 436-7 Her black acrylic brooches maintained the connection to jewelry by contrasting matt and polished surfaces and the addition of precious materials like gold. It originated from an encounter with \\"a house that had been sheathed in black rubber by its eccentric owner. The industrial rubber, entirely inappropriate for a residence, rendered the house rather mysterious.\\" She was also inspired by record that shattered in her apartment. \\"Gralnick glued the broken vinyl pieces of the record into a small houselike structure that sat on her bench for about a year before she began her investigations into acrylic, which eventually led to this breakthrough series.\\"Strauss, Cindi, \\"Lisa Gralnick\\", in Cindi Strauss (ed.), Ornament as Art: Avant-Garde Jewelry From the Helen Williams Drutt Collection, Arnoldsche, 2007, p 148 Her work was not only a statement on wealth and privilege, but a reaction to American studio jewelry of the time. Gralnick's turn to black fits within a larger aesthetic shift in the jewelry and fine art world in the 1980s and 1990s, where dark themes such as death, trauma and postindustrial decay were common as artists grappled with the end of the Cold War, the spread of AIDs, a worldwide economic recession, and the fin de si√®cle cultural fears of the coming new millennium.L'Ecuyer, Kelly H. and Michelle Tolini Finamore, \\"New Directions: International Jewelry, 1980-2000\\", in L'Ecuyer, p 161 The collection garnered attention for its bold and surreal quality at the time, and in 2002 the American Craft Museum included some of Gralnick's \\"black work\\" in an exhibition and catalog of jewelry from the 1980s called \\"Zero Karat\\". This collection emphasized the desire of jewelers of the 1980s to move away from the traditional use of gold and stones to make jewelry. In the 1990s, Gralnick's jewelry changed dramatically with her Mechanical Work (1989-1992) and Reliquaries series (1992-196). She began to use metal, such as silver and gold, and her jewelry became more machine-like, with some pieces incorporating moving parts such as gears, levers, pulleys and weights.Burrows, Keelin M., \\"Lisa Gralnick\\", in Strauss, p 476 The Anti-Gravity Neckpieces (1992) are an outcome of Gralnick's interest in theoretical physics and the Industrial Revolution. Inspired by a model of the expanding universe made by cosmologist Alan Lightman at a Princeton University summer class, Gralnick's neckpieces bring together cosmology and machine functionality, an exploration of \\"perfect movement\\", with weights that move up and down, or cords that wind up inside the machine-like parts.Strauss, p 150 The Tragedy of Great Love (1994), a locket necklace now in the collection of the MFA Boston, is a square, hinged box filled with a gold wedding ring and vials of salt and sugar on a silver chain with a single gold link. The elements represent eternal love, the sweet and bitter aspects of love and preciousness and rarity of great love, and the piece \\"both partakes of and extends the forms and meanings of conventional jewelry\\".Markowitz, Yvonne J., \\"Messages and Meanings: The Cultural Functions of Studio Jewelry\\", in L'Ecuyer, p 202 Gralnick's \\"The Gold Standard\\" (2007) is an exhibition in three parts and represents 8 years of work. She states: > In my work, I explore the relationship between gold's history as an artistic > medium and the modern material world for which it serves as collateral In \\"Part I: Commodification and Sensible Economy,\\" Gralnick cast everyday items and objects in 18k gold and plaster. The amount of gold used on each piece represents the gold value of the depicted object. In \\"Part II: Phenomenology and Substantialism\\" Gralnick recorded the objects used before melting them down by casting them in plaster. In \\"Part III: Transubstantiation and the Historicized Object,\\" she employed the recycled gold to create a collection of \\"historical\\" objects with invented histories. The exhibition has been on view in different locations like the Houston Center for Contemporary Craft where it was noted as exploring our complicated relationship with precious metal.

This instance has resilience = 1 (it is possible to connect the green regions by a path that crosses only one barrier, the blue one) but the barrier must be crossed twice by the path. Barrier resilience is an algorithmic optimization problem in computational geometry motivated by the design of wireless sensor networks, in which one seeks a path through a collection of barriers (often modeled as unit disks) that passes through as few barriers as possible. Definitions The barrier resilience problem was introduced by (using different terminology) to model the ability of wireless sensor networks to detect intruders robustly when some sensors may become faulty. In this problem, the region under surveillance from each sensor is modeled as a unit disk in the Euclidean plane. An intruder can reach a target region of the plane without detection, if there exists a path in the plane connecting a given start region to the target region without crossing any of the sensor disks. The barrier resilience of a sensor network is defined to be the minimum, over all paths from the start region to the target region, of the number of sensor disks intersected by the path. The barrier resilience problem is the problem of computing this number by finding an optimal path through the barriers. A simplification of the problem, which encapsulates most of its essential features, makes the target region be the origin of the plane, and the start region be the set of points outside the convex hull of the sensor disks. In this version of the problem, the goal is to connect the origin to points arbitrarily far from the origin by a path through as few sensor disks as possible. Another variation of the problem counts the number of times a path crosses the boundary of a sensor disk. If a path crosses the same disk multiple times, each crossing counts towards the total. The barrier thickness of a sensor network is the minimum number of crossings of a path from the start region to the target region. Computational complexity Barrier thickness may be computed in polynomial time by constructing the arrangement of the barriers (the subdivision of the plane formed by overlaying all barrier boundaries) and computing a shortest path in the dual graph of this subdivision. The complexity of barrier resilience for unit disk barriers is an open problem. It may be solved by a fixed-parameter tractable algorithm whose time is cubic in the total number of barriers and exponential in the square of the resilience, but it is not known whether it has a fully polynomial time solution. The corresponding problem for barriers of some other shapes, including unit-length line segments or axis-aligned rectangles of aspect ratio close to 1, is known to be NP-hard.; ; . A variation of the barrier resilience problem, studied by , restricts both the sensors and the escape path to a rectangle in the plane. In this variation, the goal is to find a path from the top side of the rectangle to the bottom side that passes through as few of the sensor disks as possible. By applying Menger's theorem to the unit disk graph defined from the barriers, this minimal number of disks can be shown to equal the maximum number of subsets into which all of the disks can be partitioned, such that each subset contains a chain of disks passing all the way from the left to the right side of the rectangle. As showed, this characterization allows the optimal resilience to be computed in polynomial time by transforming the problem into an instance of the maximum flow problem. For unit disks with bounded ply (the maximum number of disks that have a common intersection) there exists a polynomial-time approximation scheme for the resilience, that can be generalized to barrier shapes of the same size as each other with bounded aspect ratios. For unit disks without assuming bounded ply, the problem of computing the resilience may be approximated to within a constant factor, using the fact that for this shape of barrier the optimal path can only cross each barrier a constant number of times, so the barrier thickness and barrier resilience are within a constant factor of each other. Similar methods can be generalized to non-uniform sensors of approximately equal size. Notes References *. *. *. *. *. *.

These woodlands are also variously referred to as Atlantic rainforest, Upland Oakwoods, Atlantic Oakwoods or Western Oakwoods. Today, the Celtic Rainforest exists as small fragments of the temperate rainforest that once covered much of Ireland and the west coast of Great Britain. The majority of these fragments occur on steep-sided slopes above rivers and lakes which have avoided clearance and intensive grazing pressure. There are notable examples in Scotland on the islands and shores of Loch Maree, Loch Sunart, Loch Lomond, and one of the best preserved sites on the remote Taynish Peninsula in Argyll. In Wales, they occur on steep-sided riverine gorges in Snowdonia and Mid Wales. In England, there are examples in the Lake District (Borrowdale Woods), and steep-sided riverine and estuarine valleys in South West England, including the Fowey valley in Cornwall, and the valley of the river Dart which flows off Dartmoor, and has rainfall in excess of 2 metres per year.UK Government Met Office.

Physical conditions Small annual temperature variation, high humidity, and high levels of annual precipitation makes Celtic Rainforest an important habitat for numerous common and rare species of mosses, liverworts, and lichens.Important habitats for lichens, The Celtic rain forest, Scottish Natural Heritage online, Lichen Glossary, Allen SilversideAtlantic Hazelwoods: the case for conservation of a newly-recognised woodland type, Scottish Natural heritage Scientific Advisory Committee, 3-20-2014, Atlantic hazel: Scotland‚Äôs special woodlands, A. M. Coppins, B. J. Coppins, Atlantic Hazel Action Group: Kilmartin, UK, 2012 The Scottish Natural History Scientific Advisory Committee writes, \\"the whole area is a lichenologists‚Äô Mecca\\". There is an exceptional number of epiphytic plants (plants growing on or hanging from trees without being parasitic). The ground is covered with a deep blanketing of mosses and liverworts, which rise up the trunks of the trees onto the horizontal branches and up into the canopy. Evolutionary history Ecology Biodiversity and taxa =Flora= Trees The Celtic Rainforest is dominated by sessile oak (Quercus petraea), downy birch (Betula pubescens) and European ash (\\"Fraxinus excelsior\\"). Other trees include pedunculate oaks, hazel, elm, cherry, and various willows. Understory flora Liverworts & Mosses Lichens Rare lichen communities are found using the mosses as a substrate, and add a wealth of colour to the understory. Lichens of genera Pannaria, Parmeliella, and Degelia add a lead-grey color; lichens of the genus Sticta are very dark; the fruit of jelly lichens (Biatora sphaeroides) are pink; those of Dimerella lutea are bright yellow; and those of dog lichen in the genus Peltigera make chestnut coloured fruits in the shape of shields. The weight of the lichens using mosses as a substrate gradually causes the moss carpeting to peel off the trees, where heaps of rare lichens can be found on the ground. Lungworts are lichens in the genus Lobaria, four species of which can grow up to 30 centimetres or more across. The more alkaline bark of ash and hazel favour the growth of specklebelly lichens (Pseudocyphellaria spp.). In the grazed birch woodland on higher ground, the bark has a high acidity due to leaching by the high rainfall. This area is dominated by silvery-grey leafy species of lichens that grow directly on the tree bark, not on mosses. =Fauna= Historic human use, conservation, and preservation Historically, these woodlands were coppiced. The wood was used for charcoal, tanning, and bobbin-making. These practices ended in the mid-1800s. Today, the remaining fragments of Celtic rainforest are protected for conservation and research. Since the 20th century, conservation efforts have resulted in the protection and management of many of these woodlands, in order to address problems such as invasive Rhododendron, excessive grazing from sheep and deer, and non-native plantation trees.Bain C (2015)The Rainforests of Britain and Ireland - A Traveller's Guide.

Mesophotic Coral Ecosystem (MCEs) is a new widely adopted term use to refer mesophotic coral reefs that contrasting other similar terms like \\"deep coral reef\\" and \\"twilight zone\\", since those terms sometimes so confusing due to a lot of intercept between them. They normally grow between 30 and and up to in tropical and subtropical water. The most common species at the mesophotic level are corals, sponges and algae. The corals ranges can overlap with Deep-water coral but are distinguished by the presence of zooxanthellae and their requirement for light. They can also be thought of as part of shallow water coral ecosystems, and a crossover of coral species between the two is common. It is thought that these corals could be used as sources for reseeding shallow water coral species,Baker, E.K., Puglise, K.A., Harris, P.T., 2016. Mesophotic Coral Ecosystems ‚Äî A lifeboat for coral reefs? The United Nations Environment Programme and GRID-Arendal, Nairobi and Arendal, 98 pp.http://www.grida.no/publications/mesophotic-coral-ecosystems/ but recent analyses show that mesophotic ecosystems are more unique that previously thought and also threatened. The oldest known mesophotic coral ecosystems have been described from the Silurian of Sweden, such ecosystems are also known from Devonian. Oldest scleractinian-dominated mesophotic ecosystems are known from the Triassic. Ecosystem Services MCEs has ecosystem services that associated with shallow water coral reef. These ecosystem services include: habitat economically and ecologically for important species, potential for tourism and recovery to shallow population, discovery new essential substances and coastal protection. MCEs provide essential shelter for threaten and overexploitation species that allows species to grow, maintain diversity and support key ecological function. As a result MCEs can help shallow reef recovery by provide juveniles to shallow areas. MCEs play important role to maintain fish production as most of economic fish are deep generalist and spawn between 30-110m depth. In Pulley Ridge, Red snappers building their nest at 60-80m depth and it provide larvae to shallow reefs, such as Florida Keys. Threats MCEs has same threats with shallow reefs such as water warmer bleaching and storm but less exposure than shallow. Furthermore, by virtue of their depth and their remote offshore location, gives MCEs great protection from direct human impact such as run-off and overfishing. Overexploitation fisheries in shallow areas may lead to perturbation of trophic level in MCEs. In addition bottom landings gear usage can cause physical damage to the reefs and stir up sediment that smothering coral, causing their death. Climate change is a global threat to all coral reef ecosystem like MCEs. It cause increasing sea surface temperature (green house effect), ocean acidification and variability of temperature that involves in fluctuation of La Nina and El Nino. Other threats to be concerns are oil and gas exploration and cable and pipeline lying.  Anthropogenic Disturbances Affecting MCEs  MCEs are vulnerable to global and local anthropogenic disturbances. It has been suggested that MCEs may be refugia from many global and localized anthropogenic impacts. This buffering has both a depth and distance from shore component. Further, as human pressure on coral reefs increase, MCEs will be subject to more disturbances. The timing of increased disturbance will likely vary depending on ocean basin and the regional rates of warming, ocean acidification, and local human population growth. This human disruption is devided into several classification: = Global Warming and Thermal Stress = Periods of anomalously high temperatures during the warmest part of the year can stimulate coral bleaching and mass mortalities and are considered one of the greatest existential threats to shallow-water coral reef ecosystems. For MCEs that are exposed to the UML during warm water temperature periods, their fate may be linked directly to shallow-water reefs. Since shallow- water corals and MCEs in this situation share similar temperature profiles, their thermal tolerance limits (bleaching thresholds) may be similar. = Ocean Acidification = Ocean acidification (OA) is a particularly broad threat facing all coral reef ecosystems. Research has not yet evaluated the specific effects on MCEs and hermatypic scleractinian corals. If similar to shallow- water reefs, as a result of OA, MCEs could see reductions in net community calcification, reductions in coral growth, and likely shifts to algae- dominated systems with a few resistant scleractinian taxa. = Pollution = Pollution from land and marine sources can directly and indirectly impact MCEs and cause disturbances. Sewage, toxins, and marine debris can be pumped or dumped directly into the marine environment or arrive as components of runoff from land. = Sedimentation = Despite distance away from human activities, many MCEs are impacted naturally and anthropogenically by sedimentation, i.e., the deposition of sediments from the water column onto benthic surfaces. Sedimentation rates are artificially increased in the marine environment by a variety of means, including runoff from land, dredge dumping, and alterations to water flow that change natural sedimentation patterns. While sediment burial from any source can be detrimental to living coral tissue, terrigenous sediments have been found to be particularly harmful. = Turbidity and Light Penetration = MCEs are generally light-limited systems and, thus, may be extremely vulnerable to reductions in light as a consequence of increased turbidity or rising sea level. At the deepest extent of their ranges, many stony coral species may be near their lower light limit, although many MCEs exhibit adaptations for efficient light capture. Human activities that increase water column turbidity include sediment runoff and dredge dumping (suspended sediment) and increased nutrient pollution that increases the abundance of phytoplankton and zooplankton. Long periods where light penetration is decreased (higher attenuation coefficients) could lead to light limitation of phototrophic corals, with concomitant partial bleaching and mortality. = Benthic Infrastructure = Industrial infrastructure that is laid across the seafloor or built upon the seafloor could impact MCEs. In particular, cables and pipes used for energy, material, and data transfer are employed worldwide and in areas with MCEs. The initial emplacement and settling of cables could directly damage and kill habitat-forming corals and other sessile organisms, and maintenance activities where the cables are retrieved and replaced on the bottom could further these impacts. However, once settled and secure on the seafloor, cables can become part of the reef structure and are colonized by sessile organisms. = Mechanical Disturbance = There is a great potential for MCEs to be damaged by mechanical disturbance, which causes the physical displacement and movement of corals. Since MCEs are under-described, their presence is poorly known to society, and activities such as anchoring in mesophotic depths may be considered non- detrimental. At the same time, many plating colony morphologies particularly common in MCEs are susceptible to breakage. Fishing gear (e.g., nets, traps, and ines) are commonly entangled and abandoned in MCEs. = Fishing and Collection = Organisms can be removed by fishing for consumption, collection for the aquarium, medicinal, and curio trade, and inadvertent loss or out- migration from other activities or factors, such as introductions of predators and incidence of disease. Thus, removal for one organism, especially who play an important role in MCEs, put those environmental into any further risk. = Diseases = MCEs are not immune to disease disturbances. Stony corals are susceptible to diseases that appear to be increasing in frequency and impact on community structure. Some coral diseases are also showing the ability to transmit between colonies through direct contact and waterborne transmission. While disease can reflect the signs of coral death due to environmental causes, the ability of disease to transmit between colonies and undergo outbreaks of high prevalence at the colony level indicates disease is a multiplier of environmental stress and disturbance. = Invasive Spesies = Invasive species that are introduced to a novel biogeographic range or are native but released by ecological forces have been demonstrated to act as a disturbance in MCEs. Introduced or invasive sessile organisms can also reside in and impact MCEs. For example, algae of the genus Ramicrusta (Peyssonneliaceae) have recently appeared in the Caribbean where they were absent or rare and have become successful space competitors. The algae are able to overtop edges of living stony corals and other benthic organisms, causing death of underlying tissue. so * Photic zone References External links *http://www.mesophotic.org/ - Database of scientific publications on mesophotic environments Category:Coral reefs ","title":"Mesophotic coral reef"},{"id":"43640387","text":"Jack Fox may refer to: *Jack Fox (actor) (born 1985), English actor *Jack Fox (American football) (born 1996), American football player *Jack Fox (baseball) (1885‚Äì1963), American professional baseball player *Tiger Jack Fox (1907‚Äì1954), American light heavyweight boxer *J.

As of 2014, the focus of this website was to cater to the English-speaking expatriate population in Costa Rica, particularly those living in the Central Valley and in the province of Guanacaste.  History  The website's About page indicates that The Costa Rica Star was founded in December 2011 by a Canadian citizen living in Costa Rica as a full-time legal resident. Indeed, one of the first articles on the site reported on the death of British political author and thinker Christopher Hitchens, who died on December 15, 2011. The website's Facebook Timeline had more than 90,000 followers as of January 2020  Style of reporting  Many of the articles published by The Costa Rica Star are based on news stories found on Spanish- language media websites of Costa Rica such as Costa Rica Hoy and La Nacion. The authors add context deemed useful to expatriate readers and foreigners and constantly links to original sources (Wikipedia seems to be a favorite source for fact checking). The Costa Rica Star invites contributions from citizen journalists and has a signup page for this purpose. = Paul Watson = On May 13, 2012, The Costa Rica Star reported on the arrest of Paul Watson, founder of the Sea Shepherd Conservation Society, by German law enforcement officials in Frankfurt. From that day on, The Costa Rica Star reported extensively on the saga of the Canadian eco-activist, once eliciting comments from Paul Watson himself through the website's Facebook commenting plugin. The Costa Rica Star has also published press communications written by Paul Watson for the Sea Shepherd Conservation Society as well as an official response from the International Whale Protection Organization on this contentious matter. = The United States War on Drugs = The Costa Rica Star routinely reports on matters related to the War on Drugs as they affect Costa Rica and Central America. On July 2013, an article entitled Snow Job: U.S. Air Force Flies Cocaine from Costa Rica to Miami was the first English-language news report of a cargo airlift operation involving 24 tons of seized cocaine flown out of the Daniel Oduber Quiros International Airport for destruction on U.S. soil. In August 2013, The Costa Rica Star reported on the drug interdiction operations of the USS Rentz, which seized 963 kilos of cocaine from a fishing vessel flying the Costa Rican flag near the Galapagos Islands. The Costa Rica Star reported that the fishing vessel sank after being taken in two by the USS Rentz, a fact that the U.S. Embassy denied on Twitter; however, ship logs and reports from Costa Rican law enforcement agencies confirmed the sinking. = Social Experiment Controversy = In early 2014, The Costa Rica Star published an old and inaccurate article about changes to Costa Rica's stance on perpetual tourism, which were purportedly slated to take place in March 2014. The article caused commotion among the expatriate community of Costa Rica, which turned into consternation once it was revealed as old and incorrect. The Costa Rica Star claimed that the publication was part of a social experiment to illustrate the dangers of misinformation, but one reader who was not amused organized a petition to boycott advertising on the site.  Recognition  The editor of The Costa Rica Star was once interviewed by El Financiero, a business weekly published by the leading Spanish daily Grupo Nacion. The publication has also been mentioned by The Times of Israel, the Sea Shepherd Conservation Society, BBC News, Quartz, and UNESCO for its coverage of International Jazz Day 2012. = The Brian Pallister Investigation = On April 16, 2016, The Costa Rica Star heeded a request by Canadian news media outlets to look into the assets owned by Brian Pallister, a conservative politician and the Leader of the Opposition of the Manitoba Legislative Assembly at the time. The investigation revealed that Pallister was president of a Finca Deneter Doce, Sociedad An√≥nima, a holding company for three pieces of real estate in the highly sought-after coastal district of Tamarindo, in the northwestern province of Guanacaste. Pallister had been under fire for spending too much time in Costa Rica when he should have been minding his legislative duties. The Canadian Broadcasting Corporation and the Winnipeg Free Press cited the investigative work of The Costa Rica Star even as a spokesperson of the Progressive Conservative Party asserted that Pallister did not conduct business or owned properties in Costa Rica, although public records proved otherwise.

It is listed on the California Historical Landmarks list and is also the first historic landmark listed by the county of Santa Barbara. It is considered a quality example of \\"the transition between the architecture of the old missions and the frame churches of the American settlers.\\" It was also one of the first Catholic churches in the Santa Maria Valley. History Frederick and Ramona Foxen Wickenden purchased the property where the chapel sits from the federal government in 1872. The couple donated land for the chapel and a cemetery. Frederick Wickenden sold 5,000 sheep to buy redwood for the chapel's construction; Wickenden, his brother-in-law Thomas Foxen, and Chris Clausen built it in 1875. In 1876, the first burial was made in the cemetery, that of Benjamin Foxen, father of Ramona Wickenden and Thomas Foxen. In 1879, the chapel was dedicated by Francisco Mora y Borrell in behalf of Saint Ramon. In 1908, the chapel joined the Parish of Saint Mary. Regular services were canceled that year, and the church was used only for special occasions. In 1936, the chapel received a new roof and paint. R.E. Easton rededicated the building. In 1950, the Native Daughters of the Golden West declared the chapel as their own historic landmark and called it \\"Benjamin Foxen Memorial Chapel.\\" In 1958-59, the chapel was renovated by Winston Wickenden. He replaced the original foundation, made of wood, with concrete. In 1966, it became the first historic landmark listed by the county of Santa Barbara. =Contemporary times= The chapel began to suffer from frequent vandalism and also had structural problems. In 1972, the San Ramon Preservation group was formed to help protect the property from additional vandalism. In January, 1975, the chapel was named to the California Historical Landmarks list. A dedication ceremony was held in August and mass was held by Father Bertin Foxen, great-grandson of Benjamin Foxen. In December of that year, a gate was installed at the entrance to the grounds and was dedicated as the John W. Woolsey Memorial Gate. The San Ramon Chapel Preservation Committee (SRCPC), the organizing body that maintains the property and building, became a non-profit in 1976. Mass began again weekly in November. In 1978, the chapel received a new roof and glass windows. A new foundation was installed in 1983 and additional renovations took place, totaling $12,154. In 1985, the first electric heater was installed in the chapel. Stations of the Cross were installed on site by Drew Crosby in 1986. The next year, SRCPC offered to turn the property over to the Roman Catholic Archdiocese of Los Angeles. They declined the offer and SRCPC continued to maintain the property. The first water well was installed in 1988. As of 1999, renovations to the chapel continued.

At her first trial in May 2002, she was convicted of first-degree murder and sentenced to 40 to 100 years in prison. In a 2006 retrial, she was convicted of the lesser charges of voluntary manslaughter and sentenced to 13 to 45 years. Lobato's case gained significant notoriety due to the publication of new evidence, which some believe points to her innocence of the crime. On December 29, 2017, Lobato was ordered to be released from the Nevada Department of Corrections.https://www.reviewjournal.com/crime/courts/judge-tosses-case- against-kirstin-lobato-orders-her-freed/ It was reported on Jan 2, 2018, that Lobato will spend another year in prison for an unrelated incident,http://www.fox5vegas.com/story/37175158/kirstin-blaise-lobato-to-be- held-for-additional-year-behind-bars yet on Jan 3 the same judge who had ordered Lobato's original release, ordered her released on that unrelated matter as well, citing time- served.https://www.reviewjournal.com/crime/courts/clark-county-judge-orders- immediate-release-for-kirstin-lobato/ Lobato was released from the Clark County Detention Center at about 2 pm on January 3, 2018.http://justicedenied.org/wordpress/archives/4135 After being imprisoned for 11 years and three months since her pre-trial bail was revoked following her convictions on October 6, 2006, Lobato told reporters she wanted to go \\"shopping\\" and ‚Äúget coffee.\\"  Accusations  Beginning in late May 2001, Kirstin Lobato, then , began telling numerous friends in Las Vegas and her hometown of Panaca that a large black man tried to rape her at a Budget Suites Hotel on Boulder Highway in east Las Vegas. Lobato was consistent in telling these people that she fended off the attempted sexual assault by using a pocket knife she carried for self-defense, to try and cut her attacker's penis. From late May to July 4, 2001 she told at least nine different people about the Budget Suites attack.http://justicedenied.org/books/lobato_conviction_3rd.pdf On July 8, 2001, the mutilated corpse of Duran Bailey, a homeless man, was found on the opposite side of Las Vegas. Lobato was charged with the crime more than ten days later, after one of Lobato's friends informed police of her account of the sexual assault that supposedly occurred two months before. During a police interrogation, Lobato acknowledged stabbing a man in the groin, and police believed this constituted a confession to Bailey's murder, while Lobato claimed to be describing her attack.  First trial  While prosecutors expected Lobato to plead not guilty by reason of self-defense, Lobato denied committing the crime entirely; she even refused a plea deal offering a 3-year prison sentence on the charge of manslaughter. She insisted that she was at home in Panaca, Nevada, nearly 200 miles from Las Vegas, on July 8, 2001, and her family confirmed that. Her attorneys also attempted to discount her supposed confession. However, prosecutors contended that Lobato was a known methamphetamine user and that she killed Bailey during a dispute over sex and drugs. During the May 2002 trial, Lobato testified to her innocence, and her attorneys brought in experts who also stated that Lobato could not have committed the crime based on physical evidence, but Judge Valorie Vega suppressed much of the experts' testimony. In their closing statement, Lobato's attorneys compared her trial to the Salem witch trials. After deliberating through the night, the jury convicted Lobato of first-degree murder. On August 27, 2002, she was sentenced to 40 to 100 years in prison. Appeals, second trial and ongoing litigation Over two years after her conviction, on September 3, 2004, Lobato's conviction was reversed; the Supreme Court of Nevada argued that her attorneys were unable to cross-examine a prosecution witness, who was a woman whom Lobato was incarcerated with while awaiting trial. Her case was remanded for a new trial. On October 6, 2006, she was convicted of voluntary manslaughter and sentenced to 13 to 45 years in prison. Lobato's appeal of her conviction was denied by the Supreme Court of Nevada in October 2009. In May 2010, Lobato filed a writ of habeas corpus petition that asserted 79 grounds for a new trial. Among those was her claim of actual innocence based on new evidence discovered after her trial proving she was in Panaca, Nevada, during the time when Bailey was killed. Judge Vega denied Lobato's petition in June 2011. Lobato appealed that ruling to the Nevada Supreme Court on August 1, 2011. In February 2011 Lobato filed a post- conviction petition for DNA testing of crime scene evidence. The Innocence Project agreed to pay for the testing if Lobato's petition was granted. The petition was opposed by the Clark County District Attorney's Office, and denied by Judge Vega. Lobato appealed that ruling to the Nevada Supreme Court, which on January 12, 2012 dismissed her appeal on the basis Judge Vega's ruling was not appealable under NRS 176.0918. After Lobato's DNA testing petition was denied, an online petition has called for the Nevada courts to test the crime scene evidence in Lobato's case, claiming it can prove she is an innocent person. A book about the case, entitled Kirstin Blaise Lobato's Unreasonable Conviction by Hans Sherrer was published in May 2008 by the Justice Institute, and a second edition in November 2010. As of March 17, 2015 more than 53,000 copies have been downloaded at no charge from the website, Justice Denied. Retired FBI agent Steve Moore, noted for his advocacy on behalf of Amanda Knox, has referred to the case documents in the Lobato case as, \\"...complete and utter bullshit.\\" Retired FBI agent Moore believes that Duran Bailey might have been killed and mutilated sexually by another woman instead, who had claimed one week before that Bailey had raped her. After having been charged with misconduct and publicly reprimanded by the Nevada Commission on Judicial Discipline, Judge Vega, the judge in both of Lobato's trials, did not run for re-election in 2014 and stepped down from the bench in January 2015. On September 9, 2014 the Nevada Supreme Court, sitting En banc, heard oral arguments related to Lobato's habeas petition. The case has been \\"Submitted for Decision. En Banc\\", and the Court's ruling is pending as of April 1, 2015. On December 19, 2017, Judge Stefany Miley, a District Judge in Las Vegas, granted a new trial for Lobato. On December 29, 2017 Chief Judge Elizabeth Gonazalez ordered Lobato released from the Nevada Department of corrections. It was reported on Jan 2, 2018, that while in prison, Lobato had been convicted of conspiracy to commit sexual contact with a prisoner and instead of being released, she was to be transferred to the Clark County Detention Center to serve an additional year in jail on those charges. On Jan 3, Judge Gonzalez ordered Lobato be released immediately, citing time served. Lobato was released from the Clark County Detention Center at about 2 pm on January 3, 2018.

While leading family business interests in cotton and sugar, he supported urban renewal and anti-poverty efforts in Galveston, Texas. Early life and education Kempner was born to Isaac Herbert Kempner and Henrietta Blum Kempner in Galveston, Texas on October 3, 1903. After attending public schools in Galveston, he completed his secondary education at the Morristown School in Morristown, New Jersey in 1920. Kempner then graduated cum laude from Harvard University in Cambridge, Massachusetts. Following his lead, his younger brother, businessman Isaac Herbert Kempner Jr., later graduated from both schools. In 1924, Kempner completed his postgraduate studies at the Sorbonne in Paris, France. During his studies, he served as the manager of the Harvard Crimson golf team. He also played on the tennis team. Cotton and sugar industries Kempner chaired the Board of Directors of Imperial Sugar, the family sugar business. His long-term engagement in the H. L. Kempner Company, the family cotton company founded by his grandfather, began when he graduated from college. For several decades, Kempner helped lead activities at the company focused on the export of cotton to worldwide companies; recognizing his efforts, he rose to the position of president. During his career, Kempner held leadership positions in the cotton industry at the national, state, and regional levels. He served as the president and vice president of the American Cotton Shippers Association. Through these roles, Kempner advocated in Washington D.C. for efforts to free cotton distribution from above-market non-recourse government loans. He also served on the Board of Directors of the Galveston Cotton Exchange, the Texas Cotton Exchange, and the New Orleans Cotton Exchange. While serving as the Galveston Cotton Exchange's president, Kempner advocated for changes in U.S. tariff policies. He expressed a belief that the Smoot-Hawley Tariff Act was fueling economic decline. Civic and humanitarian roles Kempner contributed to urban renewal and community development in Galveston through multiple roles. He chaired Citizens for Urban Renewal and the Human Rights Commission in Galveston. Through the former role, he advocated for initiatives to improve housing and urban development. Through the latter role, he led efforts to integrate Galveston's businesses. Kempner also chaired the Galveston County Cultural Arts Council, and he volunteered with Rosenberg Library and the local chapters of Boy Scouts of America and the United Way. In 1981, the People of Vision Dinner honored this work and presented him with an award to recognize his philanthropy. Military service In 1942, Kempner moved to Washington, D.C. to work for the U.S. Navy. He served in the office of the Undersecretary of the Navy for three years. During this period, Kempner rose in rank from lieutenant to commander, and the Navy awarded him the Legion of Merit. Family Kempner married Ruth Levy Kempner on April 24, 1939 a few months after they dated during Mardi Gras. After Galveston elected Ruth Kempner to City Council in 1961, she became the first woman to serve on a governing body of the city. Kempner also served as president of the Family Services Council in Galveston and as a member of the Texas Judicial Council. In 1947, she chaired the Disaster Relief Committee of the American Red Cross during the Texas City Disaster, the largest industrial disaster in American history. Honors and legacy In 1976, the Mental Health Association in Galveston honored Kempner for his spirit of giving. The Boys Club of Galveston awarded Kemper their Man of the Year award in 1986. In 1982, the University of Texas Medical Branch (UTMB) at Galveston established the H. L. Kemper Award in honor of Kempner's support for the hospital. He was also the first recipient of the award. The Kempner Award honors outstanding contributions to support the recruitment and retention of medical students from minority racial/ethnic backgrounds. UTMB annually presented the award at the Harris L. Kempner Award Banquet honoring graduating seniors from minority racial/ethnic backgrounds.

It is based on the novel of the same name by Catherine MacPhail. The film had its world premiere at the Rome Film Festival on 15 November 2013.https://variety.com/2013/film/reviews/another-me- review-1200851434/ The film was released in Spain on 27 June 2014 and in the United States on 22 August 2014. Plot While on vacation, Fay's father (Rhys Ifans) is diagnosed with multiple sclerosis. Returning to school, Fay (Sophie Turner) is cast in the school production of Macbeth as Lady Macbeth alongside Drew (Gregg Sulkin), a boy whom she likes. During the first rehearsal, Fay is nervous and keeps forgetting her lines. Her teacher, John (Jonathan Rhys Meyers) advises her to look at Roman Polanski's 1971 version of Macbeth for inspiration. Fay goes to the school library to pick up a copy and, while there, is terrified as lights begin to flicker on and off. She hears the sound of someone chasing her. Shortly after she runs off, she is found by a group of her friends who have seen and heard nothing. Fay begins to see a girl who looks similar to her, passing by the street. When her mother goes out, telling the family she is going out with friends, Fay sees her getting into a car and kissing a man who is not her father, while a girl who looks like Fay approaches the car. Later a neighbour tells Fay that she saw her walking down the stairs of their building. When Fay denies it was her, her neighbour says that she would never mistake Fay for anyone else because of her distinctive long red hair. Fay chases after the girl but finds no one. Returning home, she cuts her hair into a misshapen bob. At school, Fay frightens her friends by insisting that she is being stalked by a Doppelg√§nger who her friends suggest may be her understudy and rival Monica who similarly has long red hair. After her mother picks her up from school, Fay confesses her paranoia about being stalked by a twin, and her mother admits that Fay was a twin but that she had a late-term miscarriage with her sister, Lila. After a successful rehearsal, Fay goes on a date with Drew. Returning home, she finds her father collapsed on the floor. Helping him into his wheelchair, she sees that he had been looking at a sonogram of her and her sister. In school the next day, Fay sees her drama teacher, John, pulling into the parking lot and recognizes his car as the one belonging to the man she saw her mother kissing. When he approaches her later to ask why she never waved back to him earlier that morning in the school playground, Fay denies ever being there and suspects it is the double she has been seeing around. In the school courtyard, she sees that Monica has cut her hair in a direct imitation of her hairstyle and attacks her, believing that she is impersonating her. In the principal's office when Fay accuses Monica of impersonating her, the principal (Leonor Watling) informs her that it couldn't have been her in the schoolyard as she came in early. Fay proceeds to grab scissors and cut her hand in order to create a distinctive scar so that people will be able to differentiate between her and her double. When her mother picks her up from school, she confronts her about the affair she is having, and her mother promises to break it off. Drew then comes to visit her, and the two kiss. For a brief while Fay is content as her double disappears, and her parents seem more reconciled. She and Drew grow closer and have sex. However, after her father receives bad medical news, her mother reconciles with John. Walking home with Drew, Fay sees John's car smashed into a tree and the police officer on the scene tells her that a girl threw a rock at his car window, causing him to have an accident but her mother escaped uninjured. Fay believes that her twin attacked the car. Fay decides to take the day off from school and goes to visit John in the hospital. The next day at school Drew thanks Fay for a post coital picture of them he found in his locker. During rehearsals the principal, taking over for John tells Fay to say the lines the same way she did the day before. When Fay tells her she wasn't there, everyone tells her they saw her there. Fay runs home where she tells her father she's going crazy, and he tells her that on the contrary he too can see her twin sister Lila. He warns her not to look Lila in the face as it will end her life. Fay goes to the underpass near her home and calls out to Lila asking her to leave the family alone and apologizing for her death. Lila instead orders her to look at her, and Fay does. Returning home from the underpass, Fay sees an ambulance and learns that her father tried to follow her to prevent her from seeing Lila and died when a faulty elevator crashed. She and her mother embrace. Sometime later, it is the opening night of Macbeth. Backstage Fay's mother hugs her and tells her father would be proud of her. Fay stares into the mirror and then peels off the bandage on her hand revealing that she does not have the distinctive injury Fay gave herself and is actually Lila. She smiles in the mirror and leaves to perform the play; however, the image of Fay remains, stuck in the mirror.

She was also known as a poet, literary patron and woman of letters. Her great-aunt by marriage, Anne Finch, Countess of Winchilsea, influenced her literary development. She was also influenced by the poet Elizabeth Singer (later Rowe), with whom she became acquainted in her youth at Longleat, where she grew up. Early life She was the daughter of Henry Thynne (1675‚Äì1708) and his wife Grace, and the granddaughter of Thomas Thynne, 1st Viscount Weymouth, a distant relation of her future husband.G.E.

After her father's death in 1708, Frances and her mother moved to Leweston, the home of her maternal grandfather, Sir George Strode. Marriage and issue She married Algernon Seymour, Earl of Hertford, on 5 July 1715, when she was sixteen and he was thirty. The earl and countess had two children: *George Seymour, Viscount Beauchamp (11 September 1725 - 11 September 1744), who died unmarried. *Elizabeth Percy, suo jure 2nd Baroness Percy (1730 - 5 December 1776), who married Sir Hugh Smithson, 4th Baronet, later 2nd Earl of Northumberland by right of his wife and 1st Duke of Northumberland by creation, and had children. Shortly after their marriage, the couple moved into a house built by her husband's father, Charles Seymour, 6th Duke of Somerset, on the site now occupied by Marlborough College. It had a large formal garden. Frances herself arranged the construction of a \\"grotto\\", fashionable during that period, thus becoming an early proponent of the English Landscape Movement. From 1724 to 1737, Frances was a Lady of the Bedchamber to Queen Caroline, the consort of King George II of Great Britain. Literary works and patronage In 1725, two short poems by the Countess of Hertford, based on the story of Inkle and Yarico, were published anonymously in A New Miscellany...Written Chiefly by Persons of Quality and Isaac Watts published four short poems by her in 1734, in his Reliquiae juveniles, written under the pen name Eusebia.Memoirs of the Rev.

W. Bingley, 3 vols. (1805) The letters contain such topics as literature, religion, court gossip, family and rural life. The countess was a literary patron, whose prot√©g√©s including Isaac Watts, Laurence Eusden, John Dyer, William Shenstone and Stephen Duck, whom she introduced to the queen. Particularly important among these was James Thomson. Samuel Johnson claimed that Thomson, on his first visit to Marlborough, \\"took more delight in carousing with Lord Hertford and his friends than assisting her ladyship's poetical operations, and therefore never received another summons\\".S. Johnson, Lives of the English poets, ed. G. B. Hill, new edition, 3 vols. (1905), vol. 2, p. 352; vol. 3, p. 287 Thomson dedicated his 1728 poem, \\"Spring\\", to her. The countess even used her influence with Queen Caroline to obtain clemency for Thomson's friend, the poet Richard Savage, who had been convicted of murder. Frances was an early supporter of Thomas Coram's campaign to provide care for orphans and abandoned children in London. She signed his petition for the establishment of a Foundling Hospital on 26 May 1730,Ruth McClure, Coram's Children: The London Foundling Hospital in the Eighteenth Century (New Haven, London: Yale, 1981), 257 being one of twenty-one 'ladies of quality and distinction' who encouraged male relatives to lend their support to Coram's charitable initiative: a Royal Charter was granted in 1739.Gilliam Wagner, Thomas Coram, Gent. 1668-1751(Woodbridge: Boydell Press, 2004) ,132 Death and legacy Elizabeth Singer Rowe's posthumously-published Devout Exercises of the Heart (1737) was dedicated to the countess.

This crossing is located at the Ferry Point International Bridge. Various bridges have existed at this location since 1826. In 1847, a more substantial covered toll bridge was completed. It was replaced by a steel bridge in 1895 that featured a streetcar line, and it no longer required payment of a toll. This bridge was for many years the principal crossing point between the two communities. In 2009, after the completion of the International Avenue Border Crossing, commercial trucks were prohibited from crossing the border at this location, significantly reducing the through truck traffic passing through the nearby downtown areas. The current US facility, built in 1935-36, was listed on the National Register of Historic Places in 2014. The current Canadian facility was built in 1955. United States facilities The United States border station is located at the south end of the Ferry Point Bridge, and just west of Calais's central business district. The main building is a 2-1/2 story brick structure with Colonial Revival style, from which a two-lane metal porte-cochere extends. The building has a side gable roof and corbelled brick chimneys. The building corners have brick quoining, and many of its windows have angled brick-and- marble lintels with keystones. There is a rosette window at the center of the main facade, and similar louvered openings at the tops of the side gables. The interior of the building's first floor is divided into roughly equal parts, one for customs and one for immigration facilities. The second floor, which originally housed living quarters, is now used for storage and meeting space. This building was designed in 1932 and built in 1935-36, reflecting the then- popular use of Colonial Revival architecture in government buildings. Other buildings in the facility include a four-bay wood frame garage with a pyramidal roof, built about 1936, and a c.1980 shed-roof garage with two bays. This border station was built as part of a program instituted by the US federal government in the late 1920s to provide for more direct controls over border crossing points. The increasing use of the automobile, and increased smuggling due to Prohibition. Prior to construction of this facility, customs and immigration was located in leased space on the east (northbound) side of the bridge.

In 1946, he played as an amateur in the New Zealand Open at the Manawatu Golf Club, using clubs that he had made himself, and won the event in a play- off after a four-round total of 306. He repeated the win the following year at New Plymouth with a three-shot victory over Alex Murray, carding rounds of 70, 68, 77 and 76.

Glading and his family moved to South Africa in the early 1960s after he was offered a job while playing in the Commonwealth Tournament there in 1959. They later returned to New Zealand. In 1999 Glading made his only hole-in-one, on the eighth hole at Muriwai. In the 2007 New Year Honours he was appointed a Member of the New Zealand Order of Merit, for services to golf. As well as being a caddy, player and club maker, Glading wrote a column for golf magazine The Cut, did television commentary work and served on the board of The First Tee of New Zealand, a golfing charity.

The property encompasses part of the Sturt Stony Desert and is located on the Birdsville Track and is the largest holding along the track with an area of . Goyder Lagoon, the origin of the Warburton River and the end of the Diamantina River and Eyre Creek, lies on the edge of the property. History The station was established in 1876. In 1881 the property was owned by J. H. Howie who had 1,000 cattle overlanded from Aramac Station. By 1883 the property was owned by Andrew and J. Broad who were routinely sending cattle to market in Adelaide. By 1891 the property was still owned by the Broads but managed by Mr. Turnbull. At this stage the property occupied an area of and was stocked with 14,000 head of cattle. In 1904 the manager was H.C. Trew who reported that the Georgina and Diamantina Rivers had emptied themselves onto the plains of the station covering come and the property was carrying 2,000 head of cattle. Clifton Hills was sold by Elder Smith and Co on behalf of the then proprietors in early July 1912. The purchasers, G and E.A. Brooks, had substantial existing holdings, including Buckland Park at Two Wells, north of Adelaide. At the time, the property was described as consisting of and carrying 9,000 head of cattle, 168 horses and being sold on a walk-in / walk out basis. The Beltana Pastoral Company sold the property Kanowna Station to G. and E. A. Brooks who already owned Clifton Hills, which adjoins Kanowna, in 1914. In 1923 both Clifton Hills and nearby Kanowana Station were still owned by G and E. A. Brooks. The holdings had a combined area of and were stocked with approximately 20,000 head of shorthorn cattle. In 1930 the manager was Norman Gurr who reported that the rivers had flooded, that largest floods seen in the area since 1917. Hector Brooks owned the property in 1960 and was the first to sell cattle at Gepps Cross using the beef roads concept. The cattle, a consignment of 53 bullocks, were transported by truck down the Birdsville Track to the railhead at Marree. This was the first time road transport had been used along the track. The land occupying the extent of the Clifton Hills pastoral lease was gazetted as a locality in April 2013 under the name 'Clifton Hills Station' with the word 'Station' included to \\"prevent duplication of locality name within Australia. The property was offered for sale in 2018, reported to be for the first time in 60 years. It was described as the second-largest cattle station on Earth (after Anna Creek Station), at stocked with an estimated 18,000 head of cattle, and licensed for up to 21,500. It consists of annual flood area from the Diamantina River, balanced with gibber plains with creeks, and soft sandhill country. The selling owners were David Harvey, Charles Simpson and Katherine Hartley. Clifton Hills Station encompassed four pastoral leases in northeastern South Australia and southwestern Queensland. In late November 2018, it emerged that the station would be bought by a partnership including Viv Oldfield who already owned the adjoining Pandie Pandie Station and also bought Maryvale Station earlier in 2018. The purchase included 18,000 certified organic cattle. His cattle enterprise runs about 50,000 cattle on a collection of stations including Andado Station, Horseshoe Bend Station, and New Crown Station.

The player fights through areas within the Aztec empire prior to the Spanish invasion. Team Colorblind, a two-person indie game development team, designed Aztez to play like an arcade game with the action of God of War or Devil May Cry. Aztez was released on August 1, 2017.  Gameplay  Aztez is a side-scrolling brawler, turn-based strategy game. Set 20 years prior to the Spanish invasion, the player fights in areas based on places in the Aztec empire. Player weapons include a sword, spear, knife, and club. The game uses a grayscale and blood red color palette similar to that of 2010 action game MadWorld.  Development  Aztez is being developed by Team Colorblind, an indie game developer that became a company in 2012. Team Colorblind is a two- person team consisting of Ben Ruiz (artist and designer) and Matthew Wegner. They designed the game to feel like an arcade game, with minimal tutorials, which they felt to be important towards their goal of \\"empowering people to feel like a badass\\". They wanted to make the beat 'em up have the action of God of War or Devil May Cry but lack the \\"super tedious\\" elements between fights. The game is expected to be released for Linux, OS X, and Microsoft Windows with Oculus Rift support. A subsequent console release for PlayStation 4, PlayStation Vita, Wii U, and Xbox One is planned. Team Colorblind would have preferred to release on all platforms simultaneously, but announced it would be delaying the console release due to issues of manpower. An Xbox One demo was displayed at the 2014 Game Developers Conference. The game was also displayed at PAX East 2014's Indie Megabooth and PAX Prime 2013. When Aztez missed its planned 2014 release window, Team Colorblind announced that their progress was healthy but slow. The game has no set release date. Team Colorblind was scheduled to present a panel on the game's art production at the March 2015 Game Developers Conference.  Reception  Aztez has received mostly positive reviews. Ian Birnbaum (PC Gamer praised the game's art style, and noted a potential trend of \\"historic side-scrollers\\" with the Greek-themed game Apotheon. GamesRadar wrote that the art style piqued their interest and the combat sustained it. ACG praised the title for its originality but noted that the combat could be confusing at times. Caz called it a stylish, substance-filled spiritual successor to the SNES title Actraiser, giving it an 8/10. In October 2017, Team Colorblind reported a disappointing launch with only 2,000 copies sold in the first two months.

The Division 1 premiership was won by the Springvale Football Club, after it defeated Port Melbourne in the Grand Final on 20 September by 38 points; it was Springvale's first Division 1 premiership, won in just its fourth season in the first division. The Division 2 premiership was won by Prahran; it was the club's second Division 2 premiership, and the last premiership ever won by the club in either division. The 1987 season was tumultuous on and off the field, with three separate clubs ‚Äì Moorabbin, Geelong West and Caulfield ‚Äì suspended from the Association at different times during the year. FORT review In mid-1986, the Association organised the Football Organisation Review Team (FORT), which was tasked with reviewing the medium and long term structure of the Association and how it would fit within the wider Victorian football landscape. The FORT comprised: Association president and former Brunswick president Brook Andersen; former Association and Brunswick president Cr Alex Gillon; CEO and former National Football League consultant John Adams; with consultation from state Minister for Sports and Recreation and former player Neil Trezise MLA. The FORT was given carte blanche to review how best to structure the Association into the future. =Context= The Association, particularly its weakest clubs, had been in decline for about a decade, struggling with the Victorian Football League entering the Sunday football market, rising costs, loss of television coverage, reduced access to former League players, and demographic shifts in former heartland municipalities. The Association had been working since 1980 to improve its overall viability, having discussed various affiliation models with the League in 1980, and undergone restructures of the divisional system in both 1982 and 1984, but about half of the Association's clubs were still struggling and long-term viability was a concern to the Association executive. The Victorian Football League was also going through dramatic changes which were altering the wider football landscape in Victoria. In October 1986, the League admitted newly established clubs based in Perth (the West Coast Eagles) and south-eastern Queensland (the Brisbane Bears). At the same time, as many as half of the League's eleven Victorian-based clubs were in severe or impending financial trouble: had moved to Sydney in 1982 due to its financial troubles, had fielded offers from Brisbane- and Canberra-based consortiums for a potential relocation in 1987, and , and were all struggling off the field ‚Äì in some cases, the clubs were solvent only because of the dividend they received from the multimillion-dollar licence fees charged to the new clubs, and from the proceeds earned when the Sydney Swans club was sold to Dr Geoffrey Edelsten in 1985. Thereafter followed wide speculation about further national expansion of the VFL, with expressions of interest from private consortiums, leagues and clubs in Adelaide, Canberra, Fremantle and Tasmania, and speculation that the struggling Victorian clubs would relocate, merge or fold. As such, the future composition of the League was very uncertain at the time, but it was considered realistic that within only a few years, the League could have expanded to a fully national competition, with a reduction in the number of Victorian-based clubs competing. =FORT recommendations= The FORT concluded that with the potential rapid nationalisation of the League, the Association would be well placed to take the position as the top state-based competition in Victoria, sitting underneath the League and serving as a development ground and reserves competition for its Victorian clubs ‚Äì similar to how the West Australian Football League was organised underneath the West Coast Eagles. To do this effectively, the Association would be best structured as a single division of twelve strong, viable clubs, with promotion and relegation abandoned permanently. The FORT named its twelve clubs, based upon a number of off-field criteria including tradition, location, quality of facilities, and level of support from locals, councils and sponsors. The twelve clubs named were: from Division 1, Box Hill, Coburg, Frankston, Geelong West, Port Melbourne, Preston, Sandringham and Williamstown; from Division 2, Dandenong, Oakleigh and Prahran; and a new club based in Ringwood. Under the proposal, the second division would continue, but it would now be a suburban league operating under the auspices of the Victorian Metropolitan Football League, with no prospects of promotion to Division 1. The eleven clubs who were excluded from the FORT's vision were: Division 1 clubs Brunswick and Springvale; and Division 2 clubs Berwick, Camberwell, Caulfield, Moorabbin, Mordialloc, Northcote, Sunshine, Waverley and Werribee. The FORT sought to implement this change by 1988, but needed a three-quarters majority from a vote of the Board of Management to achieve a formal mandate, which would have required several of the excluded clubs would vote in favour of their own exclusion. Springvale, which was undergoing the strong recruiting campaign which ultimately delivered it the 1987 premiership, and Sunshine, which had enjoyed a resurgence in recent years was in the process of securing $350,000 from the council to upgrade Skinner Reserve, were both worried that the uncertainty generated by the FORT recommendations might jeopardise those ventures, so those clubs led the public campaign against the changes; within a fortnight, they claimed to have thirteen clubs onside to oppose the changes. By April 1987, Andersen recognised that he did not have enough support to get the changes through, and it was never formally put to the vote. The FORT also recommended that the Association's Board of Management, which was the primary decision-making body within the Association, be restructured. Since the Association's foundation, the Board had been formed from club delegates, the consequence being that the Association could pass changes only if a majority of clubs voted for them. The FORT recommended an independent board comprising five delegates: three elected by Division 1 clubs, one elected by Division 2 clubs, and one from the VFL Commission. This would allow the Board to make more difficult decisions in the interest of the Association as a whole, rather than rely on clubs who could vote down changes on self-interest. The motion for an independent board was put to the vote on 5 May 1987, and fell one vote short of the three-quarters majority it required, with 17‚Äì7 in favour. A second vote was held in July, with the size of the proposed board expanded to six, but it this time it was comfortably voted down by a 10‚Äì14 margin. The independent board of management was eventually approved in March 1988. =Aftermath= Although the FORT's structural recommendations were never formally mandated, eight clubs left or were forced out of the Association within only 2¬Ω years of the review, with most of those clubs placing part of the blame on the fall-out from the FORT review. Andersen and the rest of the Association executive made it clear that they were still strategically in favour of the FORT's vision, which created uncertainty about whether the second division had a future: Berwick and Mordialloc both saw this uncertainty as reason to withdraw from the Association and return to suburban football; and players and sponsors saw this uncertainty as a reason to abandon weaker clubs, severely affecting clubs like Caulfield. Many clubs also expressed bitterness upon their departures that they felt that the Association executive became more willing to allow weaker clubs to decline and fail without intervening, in order to allow the Association to progress naturally towards the FORT's vision. Within only six years, the Association had contracted to the point where it almost matched the FORT's vision. The second division was abandoned at the start of 1989, and by 1991 there were only twelve teams remaining in the Association: ten were among the twelve clubs named by the FORT, with excluded clubs Springvale and Werribee surviving in place of Geelong West and the proposed Ringwood club. However, the VFL's national expansion and rationalisation of its Victorian clubs did not progress as far or as quickly as FORT had speculated: by 1994, all eleven Victorian clubs were still competing in the League, and only one new interstate club, the Adelaide Crows, had joined; and even as late as 2020 there were still ten Victorian clubs and only eight interstate clubs. The Association ended up becoming the top Victorian state-level competition following an administrative change in 1995, but it was not until 2000, a full thirteen years after the review, that the Association finally fulfilled the FORT's vision of merging with the League reserves. Club suspensions Three clubs were suspended from the Association at different stages during the year: Moorabbin, Geelong West and Caulfield. =Moorabbin= On Thursday 23 April, three days before Round 3, Moorabbin coach Graham Stewart resigned from the club over a number of disagreements with the board. The exact nature of the disagreements was not widely publicised, but they covered a range of areas in the management of the club and team, including player payments. Ten senior players immediately walked out in support of Stewart. Lacking players willing to play, the club forfeited its Round 3 games against Oakleigh in all three grades. The Association issued an ultimatum to Moorabbin that if it could not field a team in all three grades, it would be suspended from the competition. Former Oakleigh premiership player Tom Quinn was appointed coach on 29 April, but the club was unable to coax enough players back, and it forfeited its Round 4 matches against Sunshine. As such, on 6 May, the Association executive committee suspended Moorabbin from the Firsts and Seconds competitions for the remainder of the season; the rest of Moorabbin's games were treated as forfeitures. The club ultimately never sought readmission to the competition in 1988, and folded, bringing to an end a brief tenure of just over four seasons in the Association. =Geelong West= Although it was identified as one of the future Division 1 clubs under the FORT's proposal, Geelong West had been in decline throughout the 1980s. By 1987, the three local Corio District football leagues ‚Äì the GFL, GDFL and BFL ‚Äì were held in higher regard within Geelong than the Association was, meaning that local clubs attracted larger crowds and better sponsorship and could offer higher player payments than Geelong West. Additionally, many Geelong- based players preferred to play a Saturday afternoon game locally, rather than play a Sunday afternoon game and be required to travel to Melbourne every second week. Geelong West's minor grades had been suffering the consequences of this for many years ‚Äì the Thirds in particular had been routinely thrashed by more than 300 points since the early 1980s ‚Äì but by 1987 the senior team was also suffering. After six weeks, the club was sitting winless in last place, was struggling to draw crowds and was in a poor financial position. On Friday 29 May, the Geelong West playing group forfeited its Round 7 games in all three grades, seeking to make a highly public gesture to call attention to the club's ailing viability and lack of players. It was also speculated and reported that the players were striking over $15,000 in match payments collectively owed to the group at the time; it was confirmed that this money was owing, but the players denied this was the motivation for the forfeiture. The players had reportedly been planning the boycott for about a month before enacting it. The following week, a public appeal began to raise money for and encourage local players to play for the club, using the club's position as one of the city's most historically successful local clubs over a period of more than 100 years to gain support. On June 10, the Association intervened: it gave the club until 30 June to prove that it was financially viable and could reliably field teams in all three grades, or it would face suspension for the rest of the year; and, the club was provisionally suspended until it could prove those two things. The club's public appeal was successful in raising funds, and players including former Geelong West champions Joe Radojevic, Warwick Yates and Sylvester Kranjc were willing to play with the club to help it survive, even if it meant playing games on consecutive days: for their local clubs on Saturday and for Geelong West on Sunday. The final impediment was that a special transfer agreement needed to be signed between the Association and the local leagues to enable those players to make the weekly transfer between clubs beyond the normal transfer deadline of 30 June; this was agreed to, Geelong West's suspension was lifted, and the club returned to competition in Round 10. Geelong West drew with second-placed Frankston in its first game back to gain its first points for the year, but it went on to win only one more game and was relegated at the end of the year. The club lasted one more season in the Association, before withdrawing after the 1988 season. =Caulfield= In the final round of the home-and-away season, Sunshine was scheduled to play Caulfield in the Association's first ever Friday night game at the newly upgraded Skinner Reserve. At the same time, as a result of its financial difficulties, Caulfield had fallen behind on its affiliation levies, owing the Association $8,125 (including fines) after missing payments in July and August; the club had no cash reserves with which to pay, and the Association indicated in the week leading up to the match that the club faced suspension as a result. The Association Board of Management determined that the Friday night match would go ahead, and that it would meet the following week to determine whether or not to suspend Caulfield; but, that it would reserve the right to apply a suspension retroactively, potentially stripping Caulfield of any points it might earn against Sunshine. Caulfield responded that it would not play the game unless the Association guaranteed that it would not apply a retroactive suspension; the Association did not give this assurance, so Caulfield forfeited the game, and was fined $1,500 as a result. Sunshine, which was angry with Caulfield after having invested money promoting the game, staged a match between the Firsts and Seconds on the Friday night instead. Caulfield never played another Association game, as it was later suspended for the 1988 season, which ultimately ended the club's time in the Association. Division 1 The Division 1 home-and-away season was played over eighteen rounds; the top four then contested the finals under the Page‚ÄìMcIntyre system. The finals were played at the Junction Oval.

Werribee 17.14 (116) defeated Dandenong 13.11 (89) in the Grand Final, played on Sunday 20 September. Notable events =Interleague matches= In 1987, the Association competed in and won the NFL Shield, the NFL's interstate competition among the minor states. It was the first time the Association had contested an NFL-sanctioned interstate event since its expulsion from the ANFC/NFL in 1970; the Association held a competition membership, but not a full membership, of the NFL at this time. Terry Wheeler (Williamstown) was coach of the team; Jeff Sarau (Frankston) was the captain, with Barry Round (Williamstown) stepping up in Sarau's absence against Queensland. The Grand Final against Tasmania was delayed for 35 minutes, because heavy fog prevented the Tasmanian team's flight from landing in Melbourne. =Other notable events= *Mitsubishi Motors withdrew as the major sponsor of the Association at the beginning of the year, and was replaced by ANA Friendly Society. *Network Ten permanently ended its coverage of Association football at the end of the previous season. The ABC signed a deal to televise the Division 1 second semi-final, preliminary final and Grand Final in 1987. *By 1987, the VFL was staging Sunday matches in Victoria on an increasingly regular basis, and some smaller Association clubs had suffered over previous years by losing fans to local Saturday competitions. As a result, Association clubs were given the option of playing games on Saturdays instead of Sundays from 1987: Berwick and Werribee both experimented with Saturday games during the season. This heralded the beginning of the end of the Association's time as a dedicated Sunday competition.

Her choice of images come from sources like Reddit, Google+, Porn Fail and Russian sites. Mill's says in her interview with CanadianArt, that she is drawn to \\"free internet filth, inter-species romance, masturbating penguins and people wanking with plastic dolphins\\". The style of her work breaks the boundaries of aesthetics from professionalized internet and traditional art institutes. Mills work shows intensity not just through the rapid pace of images, but also the strange system in which they moved. Mira Dayal of Hyperallergic has described Mills' work as \\"a nauseating version of the internet or a frantic Tumblr feed...there is motion everywhere on the screen, and one piece tends to bleed into another. The resulting sense of immediacy and chaos is disturbing, compelling, and at times amusing.\\" =Ways of Something= \\"Ways of Something\\", is a collection of 1 minute videos compiled and curated by Mills and released in March 2015. Commissioned by The One Minutes, at the Sandberg Instituut in Amsterdam, it was a contemporary remake of John Berger‚Äôs BBC documentary, \\"Ways of Seeing\\" (1972).Cathy Wade (12 March 2015) \\"Ways of Something: 85 Artists, One Minute at a Time\\", this is tomorrow (magazine). Retrieved 22 October 2016.Maria Fedorova (4 March 2015) \\"Lorna Mills at Western Front\\", Temporary Art Review. Retrieved 22 October 2016. The first episode consisted of one-minute videos by 113 web-based artists who commonly work with 3D rendering, gifs, film remix, webcam performances, and websites to describe the cacophonous conditions of artmaking after the internet. \\"Ways of Something\\" was created in four episodes. Each 1 minute frame has been closed captioned. Mills chose to do this in order to \\"magnify the discontinuity visually, yet also unite it.\\" The resulting piece was collected and featured as part of the Whitney Museum's exhibition of video work, Dreamlands: Immersive Cinema and Art, 1905‚Äì2016. = At Play in The Fields of the Lord = This work explores topics pertaining to \\"contemporary living, including subcultures, daily routines, stress, and modern human behaviors.\\" It was exhibited in the Brooklyn-based gallery Transfer Gallery and was her second solo show run by Kelani Nichole. The opening reception began at 7pm on October 3, 2015. The exhibition included a series of \\"looped visual animates\\" including past work and recent unseen pieces. The title of the show was taken from a book by Peter Matthiessen and was chosen to echo \\"the purposeful non- sense that aligns with the visual content of the show\\" This show for Mills was one she always wished to do at Transfer and finally having the right equipment she was able to do the show. = Abrupt Diplomat at Transmediale 2015 = Mills was invited to mount a solo show of then-new gif works at the Marshall McLuhan Salon in the Canadian Embassy in Berlin for Transmediale 2015. \\"The work of Lorna Mills forms patterns that defy progress and instead suspend the viewer in an endless retreat from the familiar.\\", writes festival director Kristoffer Gansing. = Sheroes #9: Dolly Parton = \\"Sheroes #9: Dolly Parton\\", is a curated piece Mills was a part of with artists such as Rea McNamara. It consisted of monthly limited-run performance series that played with media fandom. Sheroes was invented by McNamara and it took her some convincing to get Mills to program the projections of the animated GIF's. Mills was hesitant about doing this project due to the phrases \\"Sheroes\\" and \\"herstory\\". These were phrases from earlier feminists which made Mills uncomfortable. Originally the collaboration consisted of 6 artists for the first GIF projections, but due to the excitement of it, Mills had gathered more artists. Overall \\"Sheroes\\" crew consisted of multiple net.art artists = Echo, Rise, Repeat = \\"Echo, Rise, Repeat\\", is a piece that was exhibited at the Plug In Institute of Contemporary Art. This piece presented an endless rotation of animations that were installed in the gallery's elevator. The audience then would experience a slow ride that went to one of the four floors of the building, where they would encounter her GIF's being quickly repeated endlessly.  Critical Response  = Canadian Art Foundation Features: Lorna Mills and Her Subversive GIF Art = Simon Lewson states Mills art as \\"exuberantly raunchy\\" during his interview with the artist in July 2015. He goes on to say that her work suggests \\"in a world of seemingly limitless porn, the notion of decency is anachronistic\\". Therefore, Mills finds it hilarious to exhibit digital art and sensor it at the same time. = Hyperallergic Interviews: \\"Everything I Do Has the Smell of Digital\\": Lorna Mills on Her Art = In Mira Dayal's interview with Mills, she states how scrolling through her website, \\"LornaMillsImageDump\\", was like experiencing a warped and nauseating version of the internet or Tumblr feed. She also mentions this is due to how Mills uses animations and GIFs in her work to create a constant motion all over the screen and how one piece tends to bleed into another.  Process  When creating a new art work Mills begins to search certain websites for source material. The sites chosen are predominantly on the dark web and include; Reddit, 4chan, pornfails, and Russian domains. When searching the content, her choices tend to be \\"GIFs that are un-arty, made from real footage and, for the most part, disconnected from mainstream culture.\\" The favourite subjects of Mills tend to be anything outlandish. Mills then removes the subjects she has chosen from their surrounding background frame by frame. The cuts are rough and tend to leave edges of the original background attached giving the images a \\"grainy, pulsating aura\\". She then collages her gathered imaged together using Adobe Flash Professional. When she puts the images together Mills aims to create a piece where the GIFs are moving independently but relate to one another.

An international co-production of Taiwan and France, the film stars Lee Kang- sheng. Plot summary A man and his two young children, a boy and a girl, are homeless in Taipei. During the day, the father has a job holding up a sign advertising real estate along a busy thoroughfare. The children spend their time wandering around stores and the landscape, which appears to be mostly depopulated. The family meets at night to wash in public bathrooms and sleep in abandoned buildings. Only occasional casual conversations are overheard. Long wordless sequences pass of the man performing daily activities: eating, drinking, sleeping, smoking, urinating, defecating, sometimes weeping. Obviously depressed, he violently assaults, then eats, an anthropomorphic cabbage that his daughter has kept as a toy. A woman, the kids' mother or at least a mother-like figure, stealthily observes the family. She \\"rescues\\" them from the rainstorm-drenched punt where the father has stowed them, and later joins the family in an abandoned building assuming her maternal role.

He started studying judo in 1909 at the age of 17 at Numazu , joining the Kodokan the following year and receiving his 1st Dan in 1911.  Judo career  He excelled at newaza (ground work) and felt that it warranted greater emphasis than the Kodokan gave it. He worked with Hajime Isogai to develop the groundwork-emphasing style of judo taught at the K≈çt≈ç senmon gakk≈ç schools, known as kosen judo. It is said that Oda vision of newaza completed that of Kano's. Although sources often cite Yaichibei Kanemitsu on his place, Oda is sometimes credited with developing the strangulation technique . This technique has been adopted into other martial arts and fighting systems including Brazilian jiu-jitsu, and mixed martial arts. The triangle choke was said to be able to be applied in most directions.The MMA Encyclopedia by Jonathan Snowden, Kendall Shields Oda was awarded the rank of 9th dan in judo in 1948 and died in 1955.

The current Uganda's Minister of Foreign Affairs, Samuel Kutesa was an investor in the company. In June 2014, he was elected president of the United Nations General Assembly. In a press conference in New York City, he informed the press that he had suspended his interests in all the businesses that he owned, including his shareholding in ENHAS. In December 2018, the Daily Monitor newspaper reported that Kutesa had divested from ENHAS by selling his stake in the company to a group of investors from the United Arab Emirates. Ownership In 2017, ENHAS was acquired by Kuwaiti-based National Aviation Services (NAS).

On 11 August 1945, he was captured and imprisoned in a maximum-security prison by the notorious UB secret police under Stalinism. For a time, he shared the same cell with the Nazi war criminal J√ºrgen Stroop, who was soon to be executed. They engaged in a series of conversations. The book is a retelling of those interviews.Andrzej Szczypiorski (1977), Moczarski Kazimierz, Rozmowy z katem text with Notes and Biography by Andrzej Krzysztof Kunert (PDF 1.86 MB, available from Scribd.com). Retrieved Moczarski spent four years on death row (1952‚Äì56), incarcerated as an alleged enemy of the state. He was tried three times while in prison as an anticommunist, and pardoned eleven years later, during the anti-Stalinist Polish October.St√©phane Courtois, Mark Kramer, Livre noir du Communisme: crimes, terreur, r√©pression. The Black Book of Communism: Crimes, Terror, Repression, Harvard University Press, 1999, 858 pages. . Pages 377‚Äì378. His manuscript about Stroop, written in secrecy from 1956, was published in monthly installments by the magazine Odra in 1972‚Äì74, followed by a shortened book version released in 1977. The full text without communist censorship was published in 1992 after the collapse of the Soviet bloc, by the Polish Scientific Publishers PWN. Moczarski did not witness the publication of his book. He died on 27 September 1975 in Warsaw, weakened by the years of savage physical torture endured during his police interrogations. Background field cap) with his men observe the burning of Warsaw Ghetto during the suppression of the Warsaw Ghetto uprising, 1943 Stroop before a Polish court in 1951 SS-Gruppenf√ºhrer J√ºrgen Stroop was taken prisoner by the Allies in Germany under a false identity. He was tried by the U.S. Military Tribunal at Dachau on unrelated charges. In late May 1947, Stroop was handed over for retrial to the People's Republic of Poland for the suppression of the Warsaw Ghetto Uprising and the methodical destruction of the Ghetto. His crimes resulted in the death of over 50,000 people. He was kept in jail for four years before the Criminal District Court in Warsaw put him on trial on July 18, 1951 for the war crimes committed in Poland. Stroop was executed on 6 March 1952, arrogant and unrepentant until the very end.Moczarski (1981), page 266. Moczarski spent nine months (or 255 days) with Stroop, locked in his cell from March 2, 1949 until November 11, 1949. The Stalinists falsely accused Moczarski of being a Nazi, which in turn allowed Stroop to relax in his presence, his every word a form of confession with nothing held back. Moczarski himself was sentenced to death on November 18, 1952. The following October, his sentence was commuted to life imprisonment, but he was not informed about the change. In December 1956, at the end of Stalinist terror in Poland, he was retried for the last time, pronounced innocent, and rehabilitated. The courts declared that the charges against him were utterly falsified by the Ministry under Roman Romkowski who ordered his brutal treatment. Some 15 years after his torturous ordeal had ended, Moczarski began writing his book in 1971 using notes collected since 1956, and published parts of it soon thereafter. Some of his Polish followers asked how he could remember it so well. It was due to his heightened state of alertness that only death row could bring, he said. In the Annex to his book Moczarski explained that also Stroop, seemingly unable to remember any Polish word learned a day earlier, was happy to recite every single line from his reports to Hitler. Conversations Kazimierz Moczarski, 1956 The uncut Polish edition of the book by Moczarski is preceded by a Foreword written by Andrzej Szczypiorski and followed by his Biography and Glossary of German names and terms by Andrzej Krzysztof Kunert. The book is composed of 26 chapters each with a separate title, and structured like a traditional biography beginning with the description of their first meeting in prison, and then continuing in a chronological order from the subject's birth until his execution, with additional themes weaved into the central story. Moczarski and Stroop were not alone in the cell. The third inmate was Gustav Schieike from the Waffen-SS originally from Hanover. All three slept on narrow mattresses placed on the floor for the night. There was a retractable wall bed in the cell, which none of them used out of respect for the others. Stroop derived considerable pleasure from talking, due to Moczarski's genuine interest in every detail of his story, a new focus and a reason to live. Stroop described the destruction of the Warsaw Ghetto after the Ghetto uprising in minute detail, eager to mention the foreign Hilfswilliger (\\"willing helpers\\") in the death of over 50,000 Polish Jews: \\"They did not understand Polish,\\" he said, \\"and therefore, were unable to communicate with the people of Warsaw. This was exactly what we wanted. We called them Trawniki men.\\" Moczarski translated his interior monologues in the first person, and did not dramatize any of the admittedly irrational parts. The book, written in Polish and published as in 1978 by , was translated to English and published in 1981 by Prentice-Hall as Conversations with an Executioner. Prominent translations include German, as , published by Droste, D√ºsseldorf, in 1978; French, as by Gallimard, Paris, in 1979; Hebrew, as by Lo·∏•ame ha-Ge·π≠a ºot, Tel Aviv, in 1979‚Äì80; Czech, as by Jota, Brno, in 2007; and Ukrainian, as by ƒåern√¨vc√¨ in 2009, among several others.

The device won widespread recognition when it was named one of the best projects on Kickstarter, and has been featured in a variety of media outlets. Data from each device is uploaded to Xively and published on the Air Quality Egg website. The device can be used with 3rd-party mobile apps such as Acculation's AQCalc.  Current version  Version 2 of the AQE is a single unit, Wi-Fi connected device which can be configured using a cell phone. It has two variants; indoor and outdoor. The device can be fitted with sensors for CO2, NO2, SO2, ozone, carbon monoxide, volatile organic compounds and particulates (PM10, PM2.5 and PM1.0). The particulate sensors can detect particles as small as 0.3 Œºm (microns), using two Plantower PMS5003 sensors. The PM2.5 measurements of the AQE version 2 had an R2 correlation factor of 0.79 to 0.85 with a professional reference sensor, in a field test run by the South Coast Air Quality Management District. (An R2 of 1 indicates perfect correlation, whereas 0 indicates a complete lack of correlation).  History  The AQE grew out of Internet of Things meetup groups in New York City and Amsterdam, led by Pachube evangelist Ed Borden. It is manufactured and sold by the start-up company WickedDevice LLC in Ithaca, NY. The name \\"Air Quality Egg\\" was created by company co-founder Dirk Swart. Originally, there were two versions of the device: an Arduino shield for use by hobbyists, and a more consumer-ready \\"hobbyist kit\\" device. The latter consists of two identical- looking plastic enclosures resembling white eggs. The base unit is connected to the user's Ethernet LAN connection. A second unit monitors NO2 and CO levels and reports these readings every few minutes to the base unit via a custom wireless protocol. The base unit reports these readings to Xively and the AQE website. Add-ons are available for purchase on the website, that add PM2.5 dust, Ozone, and VOC sensors.  Competition  Despite being labelled a not-consumer-ready \\"hobbyist\\" device by the manufacturer, the AQE is one of the few de facto commercially available, comprehensive Internet of Things pollution monitors on the US market. A number of competing devices have been announced, such as Chemisense Wearable and Foobot (formerly Alima). Another US crowdsourced air quality monitoring device is CitizenSensor, but it is listed an outgoing project, DIY, and not available for purchase. A comprehensive Internet of Things air pollution monitoring device is China's iKair (pronounced \\"I Care\\"), but it has a closed, proprietary platform rather than the AQE's open source hardware and open data design. In 2014, IBM announced a partnership with the government of China for analytics software to process data from pollution sensors.  Criticism  A major potential criticism of the AQE is that it is still a hobbyist device with the appearance of consumer- ready packaging. To end-users more quickly, the original version's sensors were not fully calibrated by the manufacturer. In 2017 The Air Quality Egg version 2 was included in the permanent collection of MAK, the √ñsterreichisches Museum f√ºr Angewandte Kunst / Gegenwartskunst in Vienna.
