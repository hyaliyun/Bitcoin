The pillar shown was formerly the tallest aerial tramway support pillar in the world at 113.6 metres (372 feet) and was superseded by the new Seilbahn Zugspitze pillar A cabin passing the 113.6 metre pillar The Glacial Aerial Tramway Kaprun III (Gletscherbahn Kaprun III) is the third section of the aerial tramway on the Kitzsteinhorn mountain at Kaprun, Austria. It was placed in service on 26 November 1966. It is currently branded Gipfelbahn (Gipfel is German for \\"summit\\"). Overview The tramway was built by the companies Elin, Waagner Biro, Swoboda. It has two cabins with a capacity of 60 persons (plus one operator), running from the station Krefelder Hut (Krefelder H√ºtte) which is above the sea level to the station Kitzsteinhorn at . The length of the line is , the maximum gradient is 42%. The travel time is 8.5 minutes and the maximum speed is 36 km/h. Glacial Aerial Tramway Kaprun III has two stretches, separated by the tallest aerial tramway pylon in the world. Formerly the tallest aerial tramway support pillar in the world Until 2017 when the new Seilbahn Zugspitze cable car opened, the tallest aerial tramway support pillar in the world was this high steel framework construction, placed on a square concrete block with 17 metres side length, which stands on a rock tooth. The construction consists of a central steel tube with a diameter of 2.2 metres, in which there is a maintenance elevator and a ladder. This pipe is supported by eight tubes of 0.5 metres diameter, connected every 10 metres with the central tube. This pylon was 103 metres tall when built in 1966. It has been extended twice, first to 106.8 metres and then to 113.6 metres. Gletscherbahn Kaprun 2 The Gletscherbahn Kaprun 2 was a funicular in service between 1974 and 2000, before a disaster occurred on 11 November 2000, in an ascending train in the tunnel.BBC News - Flashback: Kaprun ski train fire The disaster claimed the lives of 155 people, leaving 12 survivors (10 Germans and two Austrians) from the burning train. The victims were skiers on their way to the Kitzsteinhorn Glacier. The Gletscherbahn only took skiers from the valley station to the Alpincenter, near to the lower station of the Gipfelbahn, and did not reach the summit of the Kitzsteinhorn. Nowadays visitors have to take two cable cars (or one cable car followed by a chairlift) to the Alpincenter, from where they can board the Gipfelbahn. New construction The Gletscherjet 3 and Gletscherjet 4, consisting of continuously-moving gondolas and chairlifts, are being constructed for the 2015/16 ski season. For the first time ever, these will provide non-skiers with an alternative route to the Gipfelbahn, where queues can form at busy periods due to the limited 60-person capacity and intermittent operation. http://www.kitzsteinhorn.at/en/about-us/cable-cars- lifts/new-gletscherjet-3-4 ReferencesExternal links *Aerial tramways information * * Kitzsteinhorn aerial tramway pylon diagram Category:Cable cars in Austria Category:Buildings and structures in Salzburg (state) Category:Transport in Salzburg (state) Category:1966 establishments in Austria ","title":"Glacial Aerial Tramway Kaprun III"},{"id":"4125216","text":"Anahat (Eternity) is a 2003 Marathi film directed by Amol Palekar and starring Anant Nag, Sonali Bendre and Deepti Naval.

It runs parallel to two major Boston parkways - Soldiers Field Road and Storrow Drive - which lie on the south bank of the river. The western terminus is in West Cambridge at Greenough Boulevard and Fresh Pond Parkway. The eastern terminus is at Main Street and the Longfellow Bridge near Kendall Square. Memorial Drive is designated as U.S. Route 3 for most of its length, except the easternmost which are designated as Massachusetts Route 3 (US 3 and Route 3 connect end-to-end and are treated as one continuous route by the state). Route 2 is cosigned with US 3 on Memorial Drive between the western terminus and the Boston University Bridge. History Formerly known as Charles River Road, the road was officially renamed \\"Memorial Drive\\" in 1923,1923 per bottom left of page 2 of the Cambridge Chronicle (dedication June 10, 1923:) The Cambridge Historical Commission gives 1922 as year of renaming. when Charles River Park was taken over by the Metropolitan District Commission. It is named in honor of those who died in World War I.Cambridge Street Names , compiled by the Cambridge Historical Commission, updated June 30, 2009 In 2003 a two-mile section of Memorial Drive was reconstructed as part of the DCR's Historic Parkways Initiative. Route description Memorial Drive begins in West Cambridge, signed as US 3 south and Route 2 east, at a three-way junction (a former rotary) with Greenough Boulevard (which continues roughly westward along the river and provides access to the Eliot Bridge) and Fresh Pond Parkway, which runs roughly north and carries the US 3 / Route 2 concurrency westward. It proceeds generally southward, following the sinuous curves of the river, from which it is separated by a strip of parkland that varies considerably in its width. In the western stretch it has four undivided lanes, two in each direction (although parking is permitted on the outer westbound lane for a short section west of JFK Street). After crossing River Street it turns more eastward at the Magazine Street beach, with Route 2 diverging southward at a rotary-like interchange with overpass to cross the BU Bridge into Boston. Soon afterward the road is lined on the north by the buildings of the main Massachusetts Institute of Technology (MIT) campus. A grassy median is introduced along this stretch, and the road crosses under Massachusetts Avenue (Route 2A), with ramps providing limited interchange options. Heading eastbound, the designation changes from US 3 to Route 3 at this interchange (and vice versa westbound). The grassy median continues to divide the road until its end near Kendall Square at the Longfellow Bridge. Edwin H. Land Boulevard splits off and continues north towards O'Brien Highway (Route 28) and Interstate 93. Route 3 turns east onto the Longfellow Bridge and also crosses into Boston. The median, where present, has occasional opportunities for reversing direction. Memorial Drive, like the parkways along the opposite (Boston) side of the river, is maintained by the Massachusetts Department of Conservation and Recreation (the successor to the Metropolitan District Commission). In keeping with the recreational mission, the section of Memorial Drive from Western Avenue to the split by Mount Auburn Hospital, at Gerry's Landing Road, is closed to motor vehicles on Sundays in the summer to allow for pedestrian and non-motorized users. The closure is in effect from 11 am to 7 pm starting the last Sunday of April until the second Sunday of November. A median near Massachusetts Avenue requires executing a so-called Michigan left for certain turns. Major intersections The entire route is in Cambridge, Middlesex County.

The name also refers to the area surrounding the lake. It is flanked by Southern Avenue to the North, Shyamaprasad Mukherjee Road to the West, Dhakuria to the East and the Kolkata Suburban Railway tracks to the south. History In the early 1920s, the Calcutta Improvement Trust (CIT), a body responsible for developmental work in the Kolkata metropolitan area, acquired about of marshy jungles. Their intention was to develop the area for residential use ‚Äì improving the roads, raising and levelling some of the adjacent land and building lakes and parks. Excavation work was undertaken with the plan of creating a huge lake. Originally known as Dhakuria Lake, in May 1958, CIT renamed the lake as Rabindra Sarovar, as a tribute to the great Bengali writer and Nobel Laureate, Rabindranath Tagore. The area around this excavated lake was later developed to build recreational complexes, which included children's parks, gardens and auditoria. An artist draws a tree in front of the lake Today the lake and its surrounding areas are one of the most popular recreational areas in Kolkata. are covered by water, while shrubs and trees, some of which are more than 100 years old, occupy the rest of the area. A partial tree census in 2012 recorded 50 different species. In the winter, one can spot some migratory birds around the lake, though the numbers are dwindling because of the rise in pollution level. The lake itself is home to many varieties of fish. Fishing is strictly prohibited. In 2012 an abandoned waterhouse in the premises of lake turned into a museum run by Kolkata Improvement Trust as a gallery for installation art. Locals often called as ‚Äúthakur-der gallery‚Äù is a place for some of the award-winning Durga idols of Kolkata. Rowing going on in Rabindra Sarovar Lake. A number of people come for a walk around the lake in the mornings to enjoy the fresh air. Many visit the sunrise point to offer their prayers to the sun. During the day, it is visited by families on a picnic, tourists, young lovers and joggers. Landmarks *To the north is a football stadium, known as the Rabindra Sarobar Stadium, with a seating capacity of approximately 26,000 people. It was established in the 1950s and is today, the city's first stadium to be fully equipped with audio- visual training facilities. *Also to the north is the open-air theatre, Mukta Mancha. *Nazrul Mancha is situated on the northern flank near Golpark. *The only Japanese Buddhist temple in Kolkata is located on the southern fringe of the Rabindra Sarovar. It was established in 1935 by Nichidatsu Fujii, founder of the worldwide Buddhist association, the Nipponzan Myohoji. Monks offer prayers in Japanese, to the sound of beating drums, in the early morning hours and at dusk. There are no restrictions on entry to the main temple even when prayers are in progress. Outside the main temple building there is a pillar, with a message of peace engraved in Japanese, and a pair of lions that symbolise the guardians of the faith. The Japanese refer to these figures as Komainu (lion-dog). *There is a mosque on one of the lake's islands, which predates the excavation of the lake itself. This island is connected to the southern shore by a cable-stayed wooden (now iron) suspension bridge, which was built in 1926 and renovated in 1962. The fish sanctuary under this bridge is an additional attraction. *There are some cannons lying on the lake's west bank that were found during the excavation in the early 1920s and retained by the CIT for beautification. It is believed that they were used by Nawab Siraj- ud-daulah, the last independent ruler of Bengal. *The complex contains a safari garden and children's play center with a lily pool, and a swimming pool. A toy train, operational between 1985 and 1989, was a popular draw for children. *A number of rowing and swimming clubs are situated within the Rabindra Sarovar complex. While the former are located to the north of this lake, the latter are located to its south. In 1858 the British founded the Calcutta Rowing Club (CRC), presently one of the oldest clubs in India, to promote rowing activities in Kolkata.

According to some scholars, the city's name was changed to Antiocheia in the Troad () for a period during the 3rd century BCE (see below). Its archaeological remains have been located on √áal Daƒü in the forested foothills of Mount Ida (modern Kaz Daƒüƒ±), approximately 7 km to the south of the course of the Skamander.Cook (1973) 327-31. The site was first identified by the English amateur archaeologist Frank Calvert in 1860.Cook (1973) 327. History=Foundation The earliest Greek archaeological remains found at Cebren date to the mid-7th and early 6th century BCE and were found together with indigenous pottery, suggesting that to begin with the city was a mixed Greco-Anatolian community.Cook (1973) 336-7, 359. Writing in the early 4th century BCE, Xenophon implies that the population of Cebren ca. 400 BCE still consisted of both Greek and Anatolian elements, indicating that the two ethnic groups co- existed long after the period of Greek colonization.Xenophon, Hellenica 3.1.18 with Mitchell (2004). Sources dating to the mid-4th century BCE considered the city an Aeolian Greek foundation, and the historian Ephorus of Cyme claimed that its founders were in fact from his own city, although this statement needs to be treated with some caution, since Ephorus was notorious in antiquity for exaggerating his hometown's importance.Aeolian: Ps-Scylax, Periplus 96. Cumaean: Ephorus, Brill's New Jacoby 70 F 10, with the doubts of Cook (1973) 337. While we cannot ascertain the truth of Ephorus' statement, we can be sure that the early settlers were Aeolians, since a grave inscription for a citizen of Kebren written in the Aeolic dialect has been found at nearby Gergis.Cook (1973) 401 no. 18. Classical Period In the 5th century BCE Cebren was a member of the Delian League and is listed in the Hellespontine district paying a tribute to Athens of 3 Talents from 454/3 down to 425/4, except in 450/49 when it only paid 8,700 drachmas.Mitchell (2004). Following the defeat of Athens at the end of the Peloponnesian War in 404 BCE, Cebren came under the control of Zenis, the tyrant of Dardanus, and his wife Mania who together controlled the Troad on behalf of the Persian satrap Pharnabazos. Cebren was captured by the Spartan commander Dercylidas in 399 BCE, but soon after returned to Persian control.Xenophon, Hellenica 3.1.17-18, cf. more briefly Diodorus Siculus 14.38.3. In 360/59, the Greek mercenary commander Charidemus briefly captured the city before being repelled by the Persian satrap Artabazos.Demosthenes 23.154. At some point in the 4th century BCE Cebren produced coinage depicting a satrap's head as the obverse type, indicating the city's close relationship with its Persian overlords.Mitchell (2004). Cebren ceased to exist as an independent city ca. 310 when Antigonus I Monophthalmus founded Antigonia Troas (after 301 BCE renamed Alexandria Troas) and included Cebren in the synoecism.Strabo 13.1.33, 47. Antiocheia in the Troad A rare series of bronze coins display the obverse and reverse types of Cebren (ram's head/head of Apollo), but bear the legend (Antioche≈çn, '(coin of the) Antiocheis'). On the basis of these coins it has been argued, most notably by the French epigrapher Louis Robert, that Cebren was refounded by Antiochus I Soter as Antiocheia in the Troad following Antiochus' victory over Lysimachus at the Battle of Corupedium in 281 BCE, after which most of western Asia Minor came under his control. Moreover, Robert noted that some of these coins bore the letters B and K and included a club beside the ram's head: since the club is the typical symbol of the coinage of Birytis, an unlocated city in the Troad, Robert argued that these letters referred to B(irytis) and K(ebren) and were evidence of a synoecism or sympoliteia between the two communities which had produced the new foundation of Antiocheia in the Troad.Robert (1951) 16-31. Robert cites two further documents which he thinks proves the continued existence of Cebren in the early 2nd century BCE: the Theorodokoi lists of Delphi (Plassart (1921) 8, lines 20-1) and an inscription from Assos (Merkelbach (1976) no. 4). Cook (1973) 342-3 shows that Cebren is an incorrect restoration in the Theorodokoi list, which in any case date to the 230s or 220s, while the most recent editor dates the inscription from Assos to ca. 330-310 BCE. Robert's arguments have been repeatedly criticized by the archaeologist John Manuel Cook, who could discern no archaeological or numismatic evidence for occupation in the Hellenistic period at the site of √áal Daƒü.Cook (1973) 338-44, (1988). Cook based these claims on only two days of surface survey at √áal Daƒü, and as such definitive answers regarding the settlement history of the site in the 3rd century BCE will have to await a full excavation.Cook (1973) 6, 339.

University Press of Mississippi) Plan B is an unfinished novel published posthumously in America in 1993 by Chester Himes, which is the final volume in the Harlem Cycle. The story is even darker and more nihilistic than the preceding volumes, culminating in a violent revolutionary movement in the streets of America. The first edition was published in France, in 1983 (Editions lieu commun), translated by Hel√®ne Devaux-Mini√©. Plot summary The story differs somewhat from the other volumes of the cycle in being less a detective story and more a surrealistic tale of a racial apocalypse in America. The story hinges on the efforts of community leader Tomsson Black to stir up racial tension in Harlem in order to force a radical change in race relations. Major themes In an interview, Himes once noted that he had wanted to \\"... depict the violence that is necessary so that the white community will also give it a little thought, because you know, they're going around playing these games. They haven't given any thought to what would happen if the black people would seriously uprise.\\" Most notably, Plan B features the death of both of the protagonists of the Harlem Cycle. Gravedigger Jones kills Coffin Ed Johnson in a dramatic final scene, before being killed himself by Tomsson Black. Throughout the story, the usually level-headed Gravedigger gets caught up in the revolutionary fervor, while Coffin Ed is uncharacteristically skeptical and calm. It has been speculated that this seeming role reversal was deliberately designed to heighten the chaotic and surreal atmosphere of the book.

Its language is now known as Ecclesiastical Latin. The most used rite is the Roman Rite. The Latin rites were for many centuries no less numerous than the liturgical rites of the Eastern autonomous particular Churches. Their number is now much reduced. In the aftermath of the Council of Trent, in 1568 and 1570 Pope Pius V suppressed the Breviaries and Missals that could not be shown to have an antiquity of at least two centuries (see Tridentine Mass and Roman Missal). Many local rites that remained legitimate even after this decree were abandoned voluntarily, especially in the 19th century. In the second half of the 20th century, most of the religious orders that had a distinct liturgical rite chose to adopt in its place the Roman Rite as revised in accordance with the decrees of the Second Vatican Council (see Mass of Paul VI). A few such liturgical rites persist today for the celebration of Mass, since 1965-1970 in revised forms, but the distinct liturgical rites for celebrating the other sacraments have been almost completely abandoned. Liturgical rites currently in use within the Latin Church=Roman Rite The Roman Rite is by far the most widely used. Like other liturgical rites, it developed over time, with newer forms replacing the older. It underwent many changes in the first millennium, during half of its existence (see Pre-Tridentine Mass). The forms that Pope Pius V, as requested by the Council of Trent, established in the 1560s and 1570s underwent repeated minor variations in the centuries immediately following. Each new typical edition (the edition to which other printings are to conform) of the Roman Missal (see Tridentine Mass) and of the other liturgical books superseded the previous one. The 20th century saw more profound changes. Pope Pius X radically rearranged the Psalter of the Breviary and altered the rubrics of the Mass. Pope Pius XII significantly revised the Holy Week ceremonies and certain other aspects of the Roman Missal in 1955. =Ordinary Form= The Second Vatican Council (1962‚Äì1965) was followed by a general revision of the rites of all the Roman Rite sacraments, including the Eucharist. As before, each new typical edition of an official liturgical book supersedes the previous one. Thus, the 1970 Roman Missal, which superseded the 1962 edition, was superseded by the edition of 1975. The 2002 edition in turn supersedes the 1975 edition both in Latin and, as official translations into each language appear, also in the vernacular languages. Under the terms of Summorum Pontificum by Pope Benedict XVI, the Mass of Paul VI, which followed Vatican II, is known as the Ordinary Form of the Roman Rite. =Extraordinary Form= The Tridentine Mass, as in the 1962 Roman Missal, is still authorized for use as an extraordinary form of the Roman Rite under the conditions indicated in the document Summorum Pontificum. =Ordinariate Use= The Ordinariate Use is a form or variation of the Roman Rite, rather than a unique rite itself. During the Liturgy of the Eucharist, especially the Eucharistic Prayer, it is closest to other forms of the Roman Rite, while it differs more during the Liturgy of the Word and the Penitential Rite. The language used, which differs from that of the ICEL translation of the Roman Rite of Mass, is based upon the Book of Common Prayer, originally written in the 16th century. Prior to the establishment of the personal ordinariates, parishes in the United States were called \\"Anglican Use\\" and used the Book of Divine Worship, an adaptation of the Book of Common Prayer. The Book of Divine Worship has been replaced with the similar Divine Worship: The Missal for use in the ordinariates worldwide. Anglican liturgical rituals, whether those used in the ordinariates of the Catholic Church or in the various prayer books and missals of the Anglican Communion and other denominations, trace their origin back to the Sarum Use, which was a variation of the Roman Rite used in England before introduction during the reign of Edward VI of the 1549 Book of Common Prayer, following the break from the Roman church under the previous monarch Henry VIII. In the United States, under a Pastoral Provision in 1980, personal parishes were established that introduced adapted Anglican traditions to the Catholic Church from members' former Episcopal parishes. That provision also permitted, as an exception and on a case by case basis, the ordination of married former Episcopal ministers as Catholic priests. As personal parishes, these parishes were formerly part of the local Roman Catholic diocese, but accepted as members any former Anglican who wished to make use of the provision. On 9 November 2009, Pope Benedict XVI established a worldwide provision for Anglicans who joined the church. This process set up personal ordinariates for former Anglicans and other persons entering the full communion of the Catholic Church. These ordinariates would be similar to dioceses, but encompassing entire regions or nations. Parishes belonging to an ordinariate would not be part of the local diocese. These ordinariates are charged with maintaining the Anglican liturgical, spiritual and pastoral traditions, and they have full faculties to celebrate the Eucharist and the other sacraments, the Liturgy of the Hours and other liturgical functions in accordance with the liturgical books proper to the Anglican tradition, in revisions approved by the Holy See. This faculty does not exclude liturgical celebrations according to the Roman Rite. The Personal Ordinariate of Our Lady of Walsingham was set up for England and Wales on 15 January 2011; the Personal Ordinariate of the Chair of Saint Peter for the United States and Canada on 1 January 2012; and the Personal Ordinariate of Our Lady of the Southern Cross for Australia on 15 June 2012. As of 2017 it was decreed that all parishes in the United States established under the Pastoral Provision be transferred to the Ordinariate. Bishop Steven Lopes of the Personal Ordinariate of the Chair of Saint Peter has requested that terms such as \\"Anglican Use\\" and \\"Anglican Ordinariate\\" be avoided, saying \\"Our clergy and faithful do not like being called Anglican, both because this is insensitive to actual Anglicans, and because it is a subtle way of suggesting that their entrance into full communion is less that total. We are Catholic in every sense.\\" =Algonquian and Iroquoian Uses= Also called \\"Indian Masses\\", a number of variations on the Roman Rite developed in the Indian missions of Canada and the United States. These originated in the 17th century, and some remained in use until the Second Vatican Council. The priest's parts remained in Latin, while the ordinaries sung by the choir were translated into the vernacular (e.g., Mohawk, Algonquin, Micmac, and Huron). They also generally featured a reduced cycle of native-language propers and hymns.Salvucci, Claudio R. 2008. The Roman Rite in the Algonquian and Iroquoian Missions. Merchantville, NJ:Evolution Publishing. See also http://mysite.verizon.net/driadzbubl/IndianMasses.html =Zaire Use= The Zaire Use is an inculturated variation of the Ordinary Form of the Roman Rite of the Roman Catholic Church. It has been used to a very limited extent in some African countries since the late 1970s. Western Rites of \\"Gallican\\" typeAmbrosian Rite= The Ambrosian Rite is celebrated in most of the Archdiocese of Milan, Italy, and in parts of some neighbouring dioceses in Italy and Switzerland. The language used is now usually Italian, rather than Latin. With some variant texts and minor differences in the order of readings, it is similar in form to the Roman Rite. Its classification as Gallican- related is disputed.Oxford Dictionary of the Christian Church (Oxford University Press 2005 ), article Ambrosian rite =Rite of Braga= The Rite of Braga is used, but since 18 November 1971 only on an optional basis, in the Archdiocese of Braga in northern Portugal. Braga - Capital de Distrito =Mozarabic Rite= The Mozarabic Rite, which was prevalent throughout Spain in Visigothic times, is now celebrated only in limited locations, principally the cathedral of Toledo. =Carthusian Rite= The Carthusian rite is in use in a version revised in 1981.The text of the Carthusian Missal and the Order's other liturgical books is available at Carthusian Monks and Carthusian nuns Apart from the new elements in this revision, it is substantially the rite of Grenoble in the 12th century, with some admixture from other sources.The Carthusian Order in Catholic Encyclopedia. The text of the former Ordo Missae of the Carthusian Missal is available at this site. Among other differences from the Roman Order of Mass, the deacon prepares the gifts while the Epistle is being sung, the celebrating priest washes his hands twice at the offertory and says the eucharistic prayer with arms extended in the form of a cross except when using his hands for some specific action, and there is no blessing at the end of Mass.Non-Roman Latin or Western Rites This is now the only extant Mass rite of a Catholic religious order; but by virtue of the Ecclesia Dei indult some individuals or small groups are authorized to use some now-defunct rites. Western Rite of sui generis typeBenedictine Rite= The Order of Saint Benedict has never had a rite of the Mass peculiar to it, but it keeps its very ancient Benedictine Rite of the Liturgy of the Hours. Defunct Catholic Western liturgical rites=African Rite In Africa Proconsulare, located in present-day Tunisia (of which Carthage was the capital), the African Rite was used before the 7th-century Arab conquest. It was very close to the Roman Rite ‚Äì so much so that Western liturgical traditions have been classified as belonging to two streams, the North African-Rome tradition, and the Gallican (in the broad sense) tradition encompassing the rest of the Western Roman Empire, including northern Italy.  Celtic Rite  The ancient Celtic Rite was a composite of non-Roman ritual structures (possibly Antiochian) and texts not exempt from Roman influence, that was similar to the Mozarabic Rite in many respects and would have been used at least in parts of Ireland, Scotland, the northern part of England and perhaps even Wales, Cornwall and Somerset, before being authoritatively replaced by the Roman Rite in the early Middle Ages. \\"Celtic\\" is possibly a misnomer and it may owe its origins to Augustine's re- evangelisation of the British Isles in the 6th century. Little is known of it, though several texts and liturgies survive. Some Christians ‚Äì typically groups not in communion with the Roman Catholic Church, especially some Western Orthodox Christian communities in communion with Eastern Orthodox Churches, e.g. Celtic Orthodoxy ‚Äì have attempted to breathe life into a reconstruction of the Celtic Rite, the historical accuracy of which is debated. Historical evidence of this rite is found in the remnants of the Stowe (Lorrha) Missal. Gallican Rite The Gallican Rite is a retrospective term applied to the sum of the local variants, on similar lines to that designated elsewhere as the Celtic Rite (above) and the Mozarabic Rite, which faded from use in France by the end of the first millennium. It should not be confused with the so- called Neo-Gallican liturgical books published in various French dioceses after the Council of Trent, which had little or nothing to do with it. Regional Latin rites or uses Several local rites of limited scope existed, but are now defunct. More properly these are uses or variants of the Roman Rite, most with Gallican elements, some with Byzantine liturgical and traditional elements. *The Sarum Rite (more properly Sarum Use), a defunct variant on the Roman rite originating in the Diocese of Salisbury, which had come to be widely practised in England and Scotland around the 1530s, while the Protestant Reformation swept across continental Europe. It was practised alongside limited other variants such as the Use of York, Lincoln Use, Bangor Use, and Hereford Use. It has a legacy in its influence on later Anglican liturgy. *The Cologne Use, used in the diocese of Cologne () prior to 1570. *The Metz Use, created by Arnulf of Metz and Amalarius of Metz in the ninth century ‚Äì used in Alsace-Lorraine, the Netherlands, and Flemish and Wallonian lands until the beginning of the twentieth century. *The Lyonese Rite of the Diocese of Lyon, France, which some consider to have been (rather than Milan) the centre of diffusion of the Gallican liturgy; it is maintained in a few parishes in Lyon.See the section Liturgy of the article Lyons in the Catholic Encyclopedia *The Nidaros Use, long defunct, based mainly on imported English liturgical books, used in pre-Reformation Norway. *The Uppsala Use, suppressed during the Reformation, formerly the dominant variant of the Roman Rite used in northern Sweden. *The Aquileian Rite, a defunct rite originating in the former patriarchate of Aquileia in northern Italy. *The Benevento Rite, a defunct Latin rite originating in this city in Italy. *The Durham Rite (defunct: Durham, England) *The Esztergom Use (defunct: Archdiocese of Esztergom) used between the 12th and 17th centuries primarily in the Archdiocese of Esztergom, and in its suffragan dioceses. Similar rites were also in Slovakia and in southern, central, and western Poland. These usages of Roman liturgy were closest to Roman (today Vatican) rites with some small Byzantine-Slavic elements. Rites of religious orders Some religious orders celebrated Mass according to rites of their own, dating from more than 200 years before the papal bull Quo primum. These rites were based on local usages and combined elements of the Roman and Gallican Rites. Following the Second Vatican Council, they have mostly been abandoned, except for the Carthusian Rite (see above). Religious orders of more recent origin have never had special rites. The following previously existing rites of Mass, distinct from the Roman Rite, continue to be used on a limited basis by the permission of ecclesiastical superiors: *Carmelite Rite *Cistercian Rite *Dominican Rite *Premonstratensian or Norbertine Rite The Catholic Encyclopedia applied the word \\"rite\\" also to the practices followed (to some extent even now, a century later) by certain Catholic religious orders, while at the same time stating that they in fact followed the Roman Rite: *Franciscan Rite *Friars Minor Capuchin Rite *Servite Rite See also *Alexandrian Rite *Antiochene Rite *Armenian Rite *Byzantine Rite *Catholic particular churches and liturgical rites *East Syriac Rite *West Syriac Rite *General Roman Calendar ReferencesExternal links *Dom Fernand Cabrol's The Mass of the Western Rites *Non-Roman Latin or Western Rites *An African Interpretation of Liturgical Inculturation: The Rite Zairois *Usuarium, A Digital Library and Database for the Study of Latin Liturgical History in the Middle Ages and Early Modern Period Category:Western Christianity ","title":"Latin liturgical rites"},{"id":"4125350","text":"Millennium Park (Kolkata) Entrance Afternoon view of Howrah from Millennium Park (Kolkata) View of Howrah Bridge from Millennium Park (Kolkata) Millennium Park is a private park in Kolkata, situated along the Strand Road on eastern shore of Hooghly River for a stretch of 2.5 km near Fairlie Ghat and opposite to Railway Club.

It was released for the PlayStation 3 in August 2007 in North America. In Lair, the world is filled with deadly volcanoes, which devastated the world's natural resources and air. It led the native people to split into two warring nations: the poor Mokai, and the well-off Asylia. The story revolves around Rohn Partridge, an Asylia Sky Guard, who eventually turned to support the Mokai. Most of the game's battles are air- based combat, with some fought on the ground by landing the dragon and fighting troops and other land-based creatures. A morale system is also present, in which enemies may retreat if they suffer from low morale. Lair is the first PlayStation 3 title to have been fully playable via the Remote Play function, allowing it to be accessed through the Internet on a PlayStation Portable. An English demo was released for Asian countries except for Japan, prior to the game's release. The game's soundtrack was composed by John Debney. Lair received mixed reviews upon release, with critics praising the game's visuals and art direction, while criticizing its control scheme. Sony released a reviewer guide to teach reviewers how to properly review the game. Analog stick support and DualShock 3 controller support were later introduced to the game. Gameplay The player assumes the role of a dragon-riding knight named Rohn Partridge. Rohn is given the tasks of defending a certain area, destroying certain objects, eliminating enemies or creatures, and other mission-based objectives. After each stage, the player can earn either gold, silver, or bronze medals, depending on performance during the level. A platinum medal is also available, though unlike the other three its requirements are hidden. Earning medals assists in unlocking combos and behind-the-scenes videos. Most of the game's battles are air-based combat, with some fought on the ground by landing the dragon and fighting troops and other land-based creatures. In some locations, the game features a morale system tied to the enemy; the lower an enemy's morale, the less he will fight, and it is possible that he will retreat from combat. The game relies heavily on the PlayStation 3's Sixaxis motion controls. The player flies the dragon by tilting the controller, with additional moves also using motion sensing; one such example is fighting a dragon by tilting the controller to match the enemy dragon's flying height, and then slamming the controller left or right to knock the dragon sideways and out of the battle. Plot Lair takes place in a world threatened by numerous emerging volcanoes, causing much of the land to be destroyed and the air to be polluted. As a result, people native to the world divided themselves into two kingdoms: the Mokai, whose lands are arid and depleted of resources, and the seemingly noble Asylians, who live in one of the last remaining bountiful, green areas. Desperate to gain the Asylians' land, the Mokai attack the Asylians from the rear. The spiritual leader of the Asylians, the Diviner, preaches that the Mokai are pagans and savages, defying abominations to the will of God, but the Mokai are truly a misunderstood people, hanging on to survival and only attacked the Asylians out of desperation for food (their attacks focused on their graineries). The game mainly revolves around the pursuits of Rohn, one of the Burners (dragon- riders) Sky Guards (the air force-based military). At first Rohn adopts the feeling of hatred towards the Mokai the Asylians have but over the course of the story begins to have more sympathy towards this misunderstood people. The leader of the Mokai, General Atta-Kai, approaches the Guardians of Asylia (three individuals with ruling power in Asylia) in peace to ensure the survival of both people. The Diviner, in an act to maintain his power over his people, has Loden, one of the Asylia's Sky Guards assassinate Atta-Kai, one of the guardians and the Sky Guard Captain, Talan, prolonging the war between the two people and capturing Atta-Kai's Blood Dragon in the process. After witnessing the assassinations of both Atta-Kai and Captain Talan, Rohn begins having second thoughts about Asylia's attitude towards the Mokai and releases Atta-Kai's dragon from Loden, thus putting Rohn on thin ice with Loden, the new captain of the Sky Guards. Loden leads a massive air strike on the Mokai City, bombing the city and attacking what Loden thought to be an armory, but was actually a temple where the women and children had sheltered themselves from the attacks. Rohn is devastated when he discovers the victims and defies Loden, who declares Rohn an enemy of Asylia and delivers near fatal blows to both Rohn and Rohn's Plains Dragon. Rohn's dragon, in an attempt to save Rohn's life, carries him into a desert in Mokai territory but dies in the process from the wound Loden delivered. Rohn soon reunites with Atta-Kai's Blood Dragon, who adopts Rohn as its new rider. While searching the desert for water, Rohn and the dragon discover the elder of the Mokai, Ren-Kai, under attack from a Spider Wasp, which the two slay. Ren reveals that some of the Mokai managed to survive the bombings and are hiding out in the desert and Rohn helps protect them from Asylian attacks. Ren, knowing that the Mokai people need a new leader, asks Rohn to rescue General Atta-Kai's son, Koba- Kai, who is imprisoned in Asylia. Both Rohn and Koba-Kai defend the Mokai people from further attacks and acquire a small fleet of Asylian ships. The Mokai launch an attack on the Asylians and reclaim Mokai City. After the battle a group of Asylian Burners arrive and submit themselves to the Mokai. Among them is Jevin, Rohn's best friend, who informs Rohn that the remaining two Guardians were executed by the Diviner and that some of the Sky Guard had defected from the Diviner's rule over Asylia and were imprisoned in the Maelstrom (an Asylian prison situated within a dimensional vortex). Knowing they would need reinforcements, Rohn and Koba-Kai lead an attack on the Maelstrom to free the Burners imprisoned there. During the rescue Rohn battles Loden, who rides a powerful species of gorilla-like dragon called the Bull Dragon. Loden attempts to kill the fleeing prisoners by flinging enormous boulders from the Maelstrom's gravitational pull onto the prison but Rohn intervenes and kills Loden and succeeds in rescuing the imprisoned burners. The combined forces of Mokai and defected Burners charges towards Asylia, battle the Diviner's forces, prevent the volcanoes from erupting and kill the Diviner. During the battle Koba-Kai is shot down by the Diviner's forces. After the battle Rohn finds him and Koba-Kai comments on how beautiful the sunsets in Asylia are, Rohn goes on to say that the new world that the Asylians and Mokai were to build together would never be the same, to which Koba-Kai replied \\"Let us hope not,\\" before dying. Rohn asks Atta-Kai's Blood Dragon to carry Koba-Kai's body home, afterwards Ren approaches Rohn and tells him that his people are waiting. Development Lair is the first PlayStation 3 title to have been fully playable via the Remote Play function, allowing it to be accessed through the Internet on a PlayStation Portable. Initially the game was not fully playable, as motion sensor controls are not available on PSP. The machine lacks L2 and R2 buttons and a right analog stick, which are necessary to pass certain levels. With recent firmware updates, the dragon may be controlled with the analog nub and buttons can be assigned on the PSP to act as L2 and R2, rendering Lair fully playable. On April 15, 2008 an update was released on the PlayStation Network, adding analog stick support, extra playable dragons, and rumble support for the DualShock 3 controller. The game now uses the directional pad for actions such as the 180 degree turn and the \\"dash forward\\" ability. An English-language demo for Lair was made available to Asian markets only, excluding Japan, in April 2008. Even though the Lair Trial Version includes the gameplay patch, it is not compatible with the Remote Play function. The developers would later admit to a troubled development process many years later. Soundtrack John Debney was hired to write the soundtrack for Lair with Kevin Kaska composing the additional music. Debney has had experience writing music for epics, but Lair is his first video game soundtrack. The score was performed with a 90-piece orchestra at Abbey Road Studios in London. Lairs soundtrack received critical acclaim, with some calling it \\"one of the strongest of video game scores.\\" A review on Tracksounds gave the soundtrack a score of 10/10, the highest possible score. ScoreNotes.com also reviewed the soundtrack and gave it a full score. Several critics also compared the tracks to some of the works in Star Wars: Episode I ‚Äì The Phantom Menace by John Williams. Debney stated that he was interested in writing music for a video game after seeing the work in Medal of Honor by Michael Giacchino. The score was released as a limited edition 2 CD-set on April 8, 2014 by La-La Land Records. Reception During development, Lair gained attention due to its graphical presentation and developer Factor 5's reputation. However, upon release, it was seen as a critical and commercial failure. It received \\"mixed\\" reviews according to the review aggregation website Metacritic. The only reviewer that gave it a high score was Japan's Famitsu, which gave it a score of one nine, one seven, one eight, and one nine for a total of 33 out of 40. Although the game was praised for its graphics, artwork, storytelling, soundtrack, and sound quality, it was also heavily criticized for its control scheme. In 2010, GameTrailers placed the game 7th in their list of the \\"Top 10 Most Disappointing Games of the Decade\\". Sony (the game's publisher) attracted criticism from video game blogs by mailing review websites a \\"Lair Reviewer's Guide\\" following negative reviews of the game. It is common practice to post a fact sheet with review copies of a game, but this guide was mailed separately, and after negative reviews of the game had been published by the website. As well as providing a 21-page booklet containing artwork, background story, and six pages of instructions regarding the game's control system, the booklet invited reviewers to \\"Open your mind and hands for something very different.\\" ReferencesExternal links * Category:2007 video games Category:Action video games Category:Dragons in video games Category:PlayStation 3 games Category:PlayStation 3-only games Category:Sony Interactive Entertainment games Category:Video games scored by John Debney Category:Video games developed in the United States Category:Single-player video games ","title":"Lair (video game)"},{"id":"4125408","text":"General Jo√£o de Deus Mena Barreto (July 30, 1874 ‚Äì March 25, 1933) was one of the leaders of the junta that governed Brazil during the time Washington Lu√≠s was deposed.

Founded in Edinburgh in 1795 by Archibald Constable as Constable & Co., and by Nick Robinson as Robinson Publishing Ltd in 1983, is an imprint of Little, Brown, which is owned by Hachette. History Constable & Co. was founded in 1795 by Archibald Constable, and became Sir Walter Scott's publisher. In 1897 Constable published the most famous horror novel ever published, Bram Stoker's The Un- Dead, albeit with a last minute title change to Dracula. In 1813, it was the first to give an author advance against royalties. In 1821, it introduced the standard three-decker novel, and in 1826, with the launch of the book series Constable's Miscellany, it became the first publisher to produce mass-market literary editions. By 1921, it advertised books on the London Underground, another first for a publishing house. In 1993 Constable & Robinson pioneered the series-based Cognitive Behavioural Therapy self-help publishing, and in 2000, they became the first ad-supported, online book publisher. Lastly, in 2013, Constable & Robinson were a key partner in Digital Innovation Contest 2013. Robinson Publishing Ltd was founded in 1983 by Nick Robinson. The two companies merged in December 1999. Constable & Robinson continue to publish non-fiction books under the Constable imprint and is therefore probably the oldest independent publishing house in the English-speaking world still trading under the name of its founder.

Constable & Robinson is the UK publisher of the Agatha Raisin and Hamish Macbeth crime fiction titles by M. C. Beaton. In 2013 Constable & Robinson created controversy when it responded to a manuscript submission by JK Rowling by suggesting that she attend a writing course. The novel, The Cuckoo's Calling, was published by a competitor, was reprinted three times, and adapted for television. In 2014 Constable & Robinson was purchased by Little, Brown Book Group.

As a guitarist, he is a founding member of alternative country band The Kennett Brothers and, as a suitcase player, of the quasi-skiffle combo The Viper and His Famous Orchestra. He has been a longtime collaborator of former Titanic Love Affair and Wilco multi-instrumentalist Jay Bennett. He is also a regular contributor to such advocacy journalism outlets as Clamor and Pamphlet, as well as Harp and No Depression magazines. He's the founding editor, and primary author of the Edward Burch Wikipedia page. Downstate Burch grew up near St. Louis as part of a West Central Illinois musical cohort that included nearby Belleville, Illinois's Jeff Tweedy and Jay Farrar (of Uncle Tupelo and later, respectively, Wilco and Son Volt). As an undergraduate and graduate student at the flagship campus of the University of Illinois, Burch entered a burgeoning Champaign-Urbana scene that included bands such as Poster Children, Menthol, Hum, and Braid. Burch performed with a number of groups during this time, including Bitter Homes and Gardens, The Kennett Brothers, The Corn Likkers, and The Viper and His Famous Orchestra. It was also during this time (as early as 1994) that he began his writing and home studio recording collaborations with Jay Bennett that would eventually see light as 2002's The Palace at 4 a.m. (Part 1). Chicago Burch briefly relocated to Chicago in the early aughts, where he had a standing Monday-night gig at The Hideout, a center of the Chicago alt-country scene. At The Hideout, he could be heard performing with the likes of multi-instrumentalist Leroy Bach, violinist Andrew Bird, and The Handsome Family. In 2000, Burch compiled, produced, and played on a collection of Champaign/Chicago Christmas-themed recordings entitled Santa Is Real, its Burch-designed cover a yuletide parody of the Louvin Brothers' country gospel classic, Satan Is Real. In addition to tracks by the Kennetts, the Viper, and Burch (including his haunting version of the Johnny Marks tune \\"There's Always Tomorrow\\" from the Rudolph the Red- Nosed Reindeer television special), the collection featured recordings by Wilco alumns Bennett, Bach, and John Stirratt. The Palace at 4 a.m. (Part I) As Bennett's time with Wilco drew to a close (very publicly documented in the Sam Jones film I Am Trying to Break Your Heart), and on the same day on which Wilco's 2002 recording Yankee Hotel Foxtrot was released, Bennett and Burch released The Palace at 4 a.m. (Part 1) through Chicago's Undertow Records, to generally strong reviews. Rolling Stone's David Fricke wrote: \\"If there is a Part II to this pop sunshine, may it come soon.\\" Journalism While Burch continued to perform in the mid-aughts, he has turned his efforts increasingly to political, advocacy, and cultural journalism, writing especially for the short-lived Champaign alternative The Paper, Clamor, and Pamphlet (an online journal Burch founded with fellow Champaign writer Jenny Southlynn). Burch's published interviews are with subjects as diverse as people's historian Howard Zinn and 1960s folk icon Dick Smothers. Pamphlet provided a wide-ranging forum in which Burch's reporting on the adoption of tasers by local police can sit comfortably next to his listener's guide to the music of T. Rex.

It is named after Colorado native and philanthropist Claude K. Boettcher. History Boettcher was the first symphony hall in the round in the United States. Built in 1978 by Hardy Holzman Pfeiffer Associates, as a home for the Denver Symphony Orchestra, the hall is part of the Denver Performing Arts Complex, which is the second largest performing arts complex in the United States next to Lincoln Center in New York. Boettcher originally opened to mixed reviews. Due to its size in relation to the size of the community it serves, its 2,362 seats are often not completely filled. Tuned acoustically with a full house in mind, Boettcher originally suffered from hot and cold spots when the theater was only partially filled. Design In 1993, the theater underwent a major acoustical renovation. The height of the seat backs was adjusted, additional acoustic reflectors were added, and acoustic curtains were installed which allow the theater to be tuned for specific performances‚Äîeven during a performance. Tenants The Colorado Symphony is the primary occupant of the Boettcher Concert Hall. Established in 1989 as the successor to the Denver Symphony Orchestra, the Colorado Symphony rehearses and performs primarily in Boettcher Concert Hall, but also throughout the Front Range. The orchestra draws 150,000 patrons to 90 performances every year to the concert hall. Its current president and CEO is Jerome Kern, and its current music director is Andrew Litton. Potential Closure In mid-2014, The Denver Post reported that the city of Denver was considering a plan to demolish Boettcher Concert Hall and build an outdoor amphitheater in its place at the Denver Performing Arts Complex. This was in tandem with a planned temporary move out at the end of the 2014-15 concert season to accommodate $17 million in upgrades of the facility. The city had also considered building a smaller venue owing to the attendance of the hall's primary occupant (Colorado Symphony) routinely filling only about half of the existing capacity. The city explored building a venue with reconfigurable seating, allowing shows with as few as 500 attendees, to better accommodate a wider variety of performances and reach a broader audience. Denver Mayor Michael Hancock appointed a team to begin working on October 1, 2014 on the future of Boettcher Concert Hall. The debate was both about accessibility as well as the cost of making extensive repairs and renovations. Potential plans included fixing up and managing Boettcher as a multi-use facility that could host concerts and provide educational space. Making the space usable as a concert hall at night and a space for small classrooms. There was also discussion of adding an outdoor amphitheater. This option proved controversial, not only due to demolishing the Boettcher but also due to competition with Denver's Red Rocks Amphitheatre. This potential move would have also involved constructing a shared box office for the three large facilities in the complex. The Colorado Symphony Orchestra leadership was quick to present many reasons why they were a valuable tenant in the Boettcher.

Maristova in Filefjell (built at Queen Margaret's command around 1390) and Nystuen in Vang (first mentioned in 1627 but believed to be much older) are guest houses that provided for travelers along the road.

He was formerly a partner in the Washington, D.C. office of the law firm Gibson, Dunn & Crutcher; and previously served one year as Solicitor of the Department of Labor during the George W. Bush administration. He is a son of the late Supreme Court Associate Justice Antonin Scalia. In July 2019, President Donald Trump nominated him to become the next secretary of labor, and he was confirmed by the Senate on September 26. Scalia was sworn in on September 30, 2019. Early life and education  Scalia was born on August 14, 1963, in Cleveland, Ohio, the son of Antonin Scalia and Maureen (McCarthy) Scalia. He attended the University of Virginia where he graduated with distinction with a major in economics, along with a minor in political science. He then attended the University of Chicago Law School, where he was editor-in-chief of the University of Chicago Law Review and graduated cum laude with a Juris Doctor degree. Career Secretary of Labor in 2019 During 1985‚Äì1987 he was an aide to Education Secretary William J. Bennett. During 1992‚Äì1993 he served as Special Assistant to Attorney General William P. Barr. Scalia was in private practice in Washington, D.C. and Los Angeles, California. In 2000, his firm Gibson, Dunn & Crutcher represented George W. Bush before the U.S. Supreme Court in Bush v. Gore. He served as the Solicitor of Labor, having been appointed by President Bush in April 2001 and taken the position in January 2002 following a recess appointment. At the time, he was accused by Democratic Senators and labor groups of being hostile to workers and criticized for his articles criticizing ergonomics. But a group of former career officials within the Department of Labor have since described Scalia as having been \\"very supportive of enforcement litigation to vindicate the rights of workers, both at the trial and appellate levels.\\" In 2019, The New York Times wrote that Scalia \\"is perhaps best known for his opposition to a regulation that would have mandated greater protections for workers at risk of repetitive stress injuries\\". The regulation was repealed by Congress in 2001. During his career in private practice, Scalia has sustained a long record of defending major corporations against financial and labor regulations. Since 2003, he has defended Wall Street firms against financial oversight. A 2012 Bloomberg News article that profiled Scalia was headlined, \\"Suing the Government? Call Scalia!\\" Scalia argued for the plaintiffs in Wal-Mart v. Maryland in July 2006, which invalidated a state law under which large companies with at least 10,000 employees would have been required to spend at least 8% of their payroll on employee healthcare. On July 18, 2019, President Trump announced he would nominate Scalia to be the next Secretary of Labor. On September 26, 2019, the Senate confirmed his nomination by a vote of 53‚Äì44. Scalia was sworn in by Vice President Mike Pence on September 30. According to a former Senior OSHA official, Scalia's belief that the Occupational Safety and Health Administration has no role in managing the COVID-19 pandemic in the United States has been credited with exacerbating the failure to control the disease. His initiatives are said to be not meant to protect workers, but instead to safeguard the industries favorable to the Republican Party. Scalia has been accused of improperly intervening in the gender and racial discrimination legal case brought forth by an agency of his own department against Oracle. He is also accused of retaliating against his attorney who spoke up against his intervention.  Personal life  As of 2019, Scalia and his wife Patricia have seven children.

The first historical records of the castle are in a document dated 1390, when Pope Boniface IX gave Olesko and Tustan to a Catholic bishop of Halych. It is located about seventy-five kilometers from Lviv, the largest city in western Ukraine. Location Entrance to Olesko Castle. Olesko Castle, oval in shape, stands on top of a small hill, about fifty meters in height. A moat and a wall surrounds it, which serves as a defence for the castle. The castle is also surrounded by a dense swamp. The land that the castle sat on changed ownership many times. It was originally on the border of land of Volhynia and land of Lviv. The castle was, at different times, owned by Poland, Lithuania, and Hungary. It became a political landmark in the 14th century when movable borders between the three aforementioned countries ran through its territory. Battles for ownership of the castle were constant. A deep well in the basement of the castle was used as an escape route for besieged prisoners. Inhabitants In the 15th century, the castle was changed from being a defense point, to simply a getaway for aristocracy. In 1605, the castle was bought by the nobleman Jan Dani≈Çowicz h. Sas, a wealthy local landowner and Voivode of the Ruthenian Voivodeship. It was then sold to the family of Koniecpolski. The new owners, whose main residence was in Zhovkva, treated the castle poorly, and only in 1682 the castle was renovated by Jan III Sobieski, who bought the complex from Stanislaw Koniecpolski for 400 000 zlotys. In early 18th century, Olesko was bought by the family of Rzewuski, and its collection of antiques was moved to another castle the Rzewuscy owned, Pidhirtsi Castle. The castle is perhaps most famous for being the birthplace of the Polish king Jan III Sobieski, the hero of the Battle of Vienna. He often lived there, and collected many of the artworks displayed in the present-day museum. Another Polish king, King Micha≈Ç Korybut Wi≈õniowiecki, was also born here. It is also said that Bohdan Khmelnytskyi, the most prominent leaders of Ukrainian Cossacks spent his childhood years here. Interior Courtyard of Olesko Castle. Restorations The castle was restored in the late 16th to the early 17th centuries. Paintings and mosaics were brought in to decorate the different rooms of the castle. The castle was remodeled in the Italian Renaissance style, which was popular at that time. In 1838, an earthquake rocked the castle, partly destroying some areas. In 1882, the castle, regarded as a Polish national monument was bought by the Committee of Preservation of the Olesko Castle, which led to a restoration in 1892. Both World War I and World War II affected the castle negatively, undoing previous restoration work. In 1956, the castle was struck by lightning. The castle was restored again, beginning in 1961 and lasting until 1985. Today, it is a museum, displaying the collections of antique furnishings and art dating from the 16th-17th centuries. It also features sculptures, paintings, still lives, applied arts, tapestries, period weapons, and objects used in everyday life at the time. Its collection is regarded as one of the richest treasury of Polish art outside borders of Poland. The castle is a part of the \\"Golden Horseshoe\\", a ring of three castles nearby each other: Olesko, Pidhirtsi, and Zolochiv Castles.

Founded in the late 17th century, it was opened to the public in 1727(english) nathansvilla.com accessed 19 February 2008 as one of the first publicly accessible parks in the world. History Plan of the Saxon Garden. The Saxon Garden was originally the site of Warsaw fortifications, \\"Sigismund's Ramparts,\\" and of a palace built in 1666 for the powerful aristocrat, Jan Andrzej Morsztyn. The garden was extended in the reign of King Augustus II, who attached it to the \\"Saxon Axis\\", a line of parks and palaces linking the western outskirts of Warsaw with the Vistula River. The park of the adjoining Saxon Palace was opened to the public on 27 May 1727. It became a public park before Versailles (1791), the Pavlovsk Palace, Peterhof Palace and Summer Garden (1918), Villa d'Este (1920), Kuskovo (1939), Stourhead (1946), Sissinghurst (1967), Stowe (1990), Vaux-le-Vicomte (1990s), and most other world-famous parks and gardens. Initially a Baroque French-style park, in the 19th century it was turned into a Romantic English-style landscape park. Destroyed during and after the Warsaw Uprising, it was partly reconstructed after World War II. Features=18th century The garden was a typical example of the Baroque extension of formal vistas inspired by the park of Versailles. The park starts from the back fa√ßade of the palace, flanking a long alley with many sculptures. The central avenue lead directly to the palace, as was usual in French parks of the era. Following the completion of the Saxon Palace, the surroundings were included in the structure. The Br√ºhl Palace and The Blue Palace, as well as the pavilion known as The Great Salon, were all raised or rebuilt during the initial construction of Saxon Establishment during the reign of Augustus II. A baroque flower garden with pieces of turf, flower beds, hedges and trees was created. These gardens extended the central axis of a symmetrical building fa√ßade in rigorously symmetrical axial designs of patterned parterres, gravel walks and formally planted bosquets. The parterres were laid out from 1713 by Joachim Heinrich Schultze and Gothard Paul Th√∂rl from 1735. The Saxon Palace The Br√ºhl Palace. Rococo sculptures. The Great Salon. The Blue Palace. The Iron Gate. * Saxon Palace. A vast palace complex according to Tylman van Gameren's design arose here between 1661 and 1664 for Jan Andrzej Morsztyn. In 1669 the palace was rebuilt and enlarged. The main break was enhanced and a two galleries ended with a double-storied pavillons were added to the palace's alcoves. In 1713 the building was purcheased by King Augustus II, who started to repurchase surrounding freeholds and demolishing the buildings. Reconstruction of the palace establishment and creating of the Saxon Axis passed through three distinct stages - from 1713 to the 1720s according to Carl Friedrich P√∂ppelmann's and Joachim Daniel von Jauch's design, secondly to 1733 and completion in 1748 by Augustus III \\"the Corpulent\\". The Palace was remodeled in 1842. During World War II, the Saxon Palace was blown up by the Germans after the collapse of the Warsaw Uprising in 1944. * Br√ºhl Palace, former palace of Jerzy Ossoli≈Ñski, was rebuilt between 1681 and 1697 by Tylman van Gameren. Purchased by Heinrich von Br√ºhl in 1750, on his request it was reconstructed by Johann Friedrich Kn√∂bel and Joachim Daniel von Jauch between 1754 and 1759. The two outbuildings were built in that time and put together with the palace. Later another two outbuildings were added and weaved together by an enclosure decorated with sculptures. The central limb of the building was enhanced and covered with a mansard roof. During 1932-37 the palace was adapted for use as the Ministry for Foreign Affairs of the new Polish Republic. It was deliberately destroyed by the Germans on December 18, 1944. * Sandstone statues, a part of the rich collection of sculptures removed to Saint Petersburg after recapturing the city by Marshal Suvorov in 1794, and placed in the Summer Garden. According to the 1745 plan of the Saxon Garden there were 70 postuments in the Garden, and in 1797 there were only 37 sculptures left; only 20 of them have been preserved until our times. Four of these sculptures were completely destroyed during the blowing up of the Saxon Palace in 1944, but they were later reconstructed. Included are groups of sculptures, including Arithmetic, Astronomy, Bacchus, Flora, Geography, two sculptures identified as Glory, Instruct, Intelligence, Intellect, Justice, Medicine, Military Architecture, Painting, Poetry, Rationality, Science, Sculpture, Venus and Winter. They were generally made before 1745 by anonymous Warsaw sculptors under the direction of Johann Georg Plersch. * The Great Salon, situated on the axis in the center of a Saxon Garden, was intended simply to provide a suitable end to the main garden axis. It was constructed after 1720 according to Matth√§us Daniel P√∂ppelmann's design. The building was opened to the garden by semicircular porte-fen√™tres and oculuses. A terrace above the ground level of the building was enclosed by an attic decorated with vases; also, two outhouses from both sides were added. The Great Salon was demolished in 1817. * Operalnia, the 500-seat opera house, was opened in 1748. It was built under the architect Carl Friedrich P√∂ppelmann and modelled on the Small Theatre in Dresden, built by Christoph Bayer in 1687. The interior was decorated in a heavy, sumptuous baroque style by the court artists. On November 19, 1765 in Operalnia, the actors of The Majesty put on the premiere of ‚Äôs Intruders (Natrƒôci), a comedy which was a loose adaptation of a play by Moli√®re. Since the acting team had all the features of a fully professional and national group (they performed in Polish and earned their living through acting), November 19 is the anniversary of the establishment of the National Theatre. The National stage belonged to the elements of the educational and cultural reform programme in the falling Republic of Poland, prepared by King Stanis≈Çaw August Poniatowski. Over decades this theatre, taking care of the works of Polish playwrights, was the ground on which the cultural development of Polish people thrived. The building was demolished in 1772. * The Blue Palace. It takes its name from the colour of the roof. the palace was purchased by King Augustus II for his daughter Anna Karolina Orzelska from bishop Teodor Andrzej Potocki. The palace was rebuilt in 1726 by Joachim Daniel von Jauch and Johann Sigmund Deybel. The King wanted to offer it to Anna as a Christmas present. In six weeks, the Palace was renovated by 300 masons and craftsmen working night and day. The courtyard, encompassed by a walled enclosure, had two gates. Column galleries were situated on both sides of the garden fa√ßade. A backside garden (integral part of the Saxon Garden) and a cascade fountain were designed by Carl Friedrich P√∂ppelmann. Since 1811, it has been the property of the Zamoyski family which remodeled it in a late Neoclassical style. The palace was rebuilt after the war devastations. * The Church of St. Anthony of Padua and Reformed Franciscan Monastery was founded in 1623 in gratitude for the capture of Smolensk on June 13, 1611 (Liturgical Feasts of Saint Anthony of Padua) by Sigismund III Vasa and dedicated on May 13, 1635. This church was heavily damaged during the Deluge by the Transylvanian army of George II R√°k√≥czi. The new church was founded by Castellan Stanis≈Çaw Leszczyc-Skarszewski. Work began in 1668 following the plan of J√≥zef Szymon Bellotti. In 1734, the church became the parish church of the royal court in the Saxon Palace. The king ordered a special loge for him and his wife to be built on the left side of the presbytery (1734‚Äì35), and the royal sculptor Johann Georg Plersch created the sculptures inside. The church was partly destroyed during the Warsaw Uprising. * The Iron Gate was a part of The Saxon Establishment, which itself had a shape of a pentagon covered an area of around 17 ha. The gate was constructed according to Joachim Daniel von Jauch's design after 1735, together with other buildings of the Saxon Axis border, like Mounted Crown Guards barracks, a wall with bastions from the south and west, or the Blue Palace. It was embellished with cartouches with Polish and Lithuanian Coats of Arms. The Gate was demolished in 1821. View of The Saxon Establishment from the north painted by Bernardo Bellotto il Canaletto of 1764 shows a main entrance to the palace from Wielopole with The Iron Gate and the 21 m-high garden gloriette, so-called Great Salon. 19th and 20th centuries The Saxon Palace Tomb of the Unknown Soldier * Tomb of the Unknown Soldier, dedicated to the unknown soldiers who have given their lives for Poland. It is one of many such national tombs of unknowns that were erected after World War I, as well as the most important national symbols of bravery and heroism. In 1925, architect Stanis≈Çaw Ostrowski produced a design to be located under the arcades of the Saxon Palace in Warsaw. The triple arch of the Tomb is the only remnant of the Saxon Palace colonnade. Here official delegations place wreaths and pay homage to the killed soldiers. The tomb has a change of guards every hour. * Fountain, with an elaborately carved plaque resting on a shell form basin supported by a scrolled bracket, is often used by dating couples as their meeting place. It was established in 1855. The fountain is the centrepiece of gardens designed by the 19th-century designer Henryk Marconi and also one of the most precious urban symbols of Warsaw. * Marble sundial, an 1863http://www.inyourpocket.com/poland/warsaw/sightseeing/parks/Saski- Park_21137v horizontal sundial, is situated close to the big fountain in the centre of the park. It was established by the significant physicist and meteorologist Antoni Szeliga Magier (1762‚Äì1837). * Water Tower, in the northwest part of the Saxon Garden, is situated by the ornamental lake surrounded by willows. This classicist water tower in the shape of a Roman monopteros was modelled on the Temple of Vesta in Tivoli. It was designed in 1852 by the architect Henryk Marconi. * Summer Theatre, a popular summer vari√©te theatre, existed between 1870 and 1939. It was under Stanis≈Çaw Moniuszko's \\"rule\\" at the Teatr Wielki that the wooden Summer Theatre was built in the Saxon Garden, between the Water Tower building and the Blue Palace by Aleksander Zabierzowski. From then on, summer performances from the Warsaw theatres were shown there every year. At the time, the Summer Theatre could seat an audience of 1,065. Helena Modjeska and Pola Negri made several appearance there. The theatre burned in September 1939 following a direct hit by an incendiary bomb and was never restored. * Palm House, modeled after Victorian glass and iron structures in England, was built in 1894. It was created specifically for the exotic palms being collected and introduced to Europe in the 19th century. The elegant design, with its unobstructed space for the spreading crowns of the tall palms, was a perfect marriage of form and function. The structure was destroyed during the Warsaw Uprising and Planned destruction of Warsaw and was never restored. * The Monument dedicated to Maria Konopnicka, famous Polish poet and writer mainly for children and youth, was unveiled in 1965. * The Statue of Stefan Starzy≈Ñski, leader of the fighting capital during the Siege of Warsaw, was added in 1981.

However, there have been no executions since 23 June 1976, although death sentences were handed down continuously by the High and Supreme Courts for murder and drug trafficking convictions. These were automatically commuted to life in prison. The government decided to reinstate capital punishment in 2004 for cases of rape, drug trafficking and murder after the assassination of High Court judge Sarath Ambepitiya. Perjury that results in execution of an innocent person, treason, armed robbery, some military offences and certain crimes committed with the use of a gun (such as kidnapping, extortion, human trafficking, assault on a public servant) can also result in the death penalty. History The death penalty has a long history in Sri Lanka. The British restricted the death penalty after they took control of the island in 1815 to the crimes of murder and \\"waging war against the King.\\" After independence, then Prime Minister S. W. R. D. Bandaranaike abolished capital punishment in 1956. However, it was quickly reintroduced after his assassination in 1959. Opposition to the death penalty started to become increasingly widespread and the United National Party government modified the use of it in its 1978 rewrite of the constitution. Under the new arrangement, death sentences could only be carried out if authorised by the trial judge, the Attorney General and the Minister of Justice. If there was no agreement, the sentence was to be commuted to life imprisonment. The sentence was also to be ratified by the President. This clause effectively ended executions. The last execution in Sri Lanka took place in 1976. In March 1999, after spurts of violence near the end of her first term in office, Chandrika Kumaratunga stated that the government would be reintroducing the death penalty. However, she was forced to back down in the face of overwhelming public protest. The issue hung in the balance, with all death sentences from then on being neither commuted to life nor carried out. After discussions were held regarding the matter, the motion that commuted all death sentences to life in prison was revoked in January 2001. On 19 November 2004, High Court Judge Sarath Ambepitiya was gunned down as he arrived home from work. He had a reputation for handing out tough sentences. The assassination immediately prompted Kumaratunga to effectively reinstate capital punishment. With the end of the Sri Lankan Civil War the country saw a sharp rise in child abuse, rape, murder and drug trafficking, prompting some lawyers and politicians to call for the reinstatement of the death penalty. Newly elected President Maithripala Sirisena, in 2015, said he supports a dialogue on the introduction of the death penalty should it be approved by Parliament. The statement coming after a series of high profile incidents of rape, killing and sexual abuse. The death penalty, if put into action, would be carried out by hanging in the gallows situated in Colombo. As of 2015 there are 1,116 convicts on death row. In 2018, it was reported that Sri Lanka is going to reinstate capital punishment for drug dealers. President Maithripala Sirisena told the government, which earlier had unanimously backed the reinstatement of capital punishment, that he ‚Äúwas ready to sign the death warrants‚Äù. In February 2019 he told parliament that the death penalty for convicted drug offenders would be reinstated within two months. On 26 June, President Maithripala Sirisena signed death warrants with the execution dates for four convicts with drug-related offences, the first time that executions were ordered in 43 years. According to the president's office, the executions are meant to be a powerful message to those involved in drug trafficking. In June 2019, the first two hangmen in 43 years were hired.https://www.bbc.com/news/world-asia-48812576 The country's president has also demanded the capital punishment for those responsible of the Easter Sunday attacks in the country. Notable cases *Maru Sira, criminal who gained fame through many daring prison escapes, executed by hanging on 7 August 1975. Originally he was sentenced to death in absentia for killing of a man in March 1974. The night before his execution, prison guards gave him Largactil in strong dosage in an attempt to prevent him escaping, but this caused him to collapse and his hanging was botched because the short fall caused by his slumped position, caused him to strangle to death instead of breaking his neck and killing him instantly *Talduwe Somarama, a Buddhist monk responsible for the assassination of S. W. R. D. Bandaranaike in 1959. He was executed by hanging on 6 July 1962.

He inherited from his father Murong Chui (Emperor Wucheng) a sizable empire but lost most of it within a span of a year, and would be dead in less than three, a victim of a rebellion by his granduncle Lan Han. Historians largely attributed this to his irresolution and inability to judge military and political decisions. While Later Yan would last for one more decade after his death, it would never regain the power it had under Murong Chui. Prior to Later Yan's establishment Murong Bao was Murong Chui's fourth son, by his first wife Princess Duan while he was the Prince of Wu under his brother Murong Jun (Emperor Jingzhao of Former Yan). He was initially not his father's heir apparent‚Äîhis older brother Murong Ling (ÊÖïÂÆπ‰ª§), also born of Princess Duan, was. He lost his mother in 358 after she died in prison after being falsely accused of witchcraft against Murong Jun and his wife Empress Kezuhun. After Murong Chui fell into suspicion by Empress Dowager Kezuhun and the regent Murong Ping in 369 during the reign of Murong Jun's son Murong Wei, Murong Bao was among the members of Murong Chui's household who fled with him to Former Qin. After his brother Murong Ling fell into a trap set by Former Qin's prime minister Wang Meng (who did not trust Murong Chui or his sons) into defecting back to Former Yan and was subsequently killed, Murong Bao became his father's heir apparent. In his young age, Murong Bao was not known for his abilities or ambitions, but for favoring flatterers. At one point he served as a commandery governor. In 383, he was a mid-level commander in the Former Qin army that set out to conquer Jin and reunite China but was defeated at the Battle of Fei River. When, after the army collapsed, the Former Qin emperor Fu JiƒÅn fled to Murong Chui's army (which remained intact), Murong Bao tried to persuade his father to kill Fu JiƒÅn and declare a rebellion, but Murong Chui declined. Around the new year 384, however, when Murong Chui had, after being sent by Fu JiƒÅn on a mission to pacify the northeastern empire, become set to rebel instead, Murong Bao was involved in his first act of rebellion‚Äîmassacring the Di soldiers that Murong Chui's deputy, Fu Feilong (ËãªÈ£õÈæç), commanded. In spring 384, after Murong Chui claimed the title Prince of Yan, effectively declaring independence from Former Qin, he created Murong Bao crown prince. During Murong Chui's reign As crown prince, Murong Bao became known as a studious learner and talented writer, and because of this and his careful cultivation of relationships with Murong Chui's servants and officials, his father saw him as a good successor, keeping him in that status despite how he favored the military abilities of his other sons Murong Nong the Prince of Liaoxi, Murong Long the Prince of Gaoyang, and Murong Lin the Prince of Zhao. (At one point, when Murong Chui's wise wife Empress Duan Yuanfei (Murong Bao's cousin) reminded him that Murong Bao lacked abilities and that Murong Nong or Murong Long would make a more appropriate successor, he, not believing her judgment, compared her derogatorily to Li Ji, the wife of Duke Xian of Jin of the Spring and Autumn period, who falsely accused crown prince Shensheng of crimes and had him killed.) As the years went by, Murong Bao was typically guarding the capital Zhongshan (‰∏≠Â±±, in modern Baoding, Hebei) as his father waged campaigns, and he appeared to serve in this role competently. In 388, when he was 33 and Murong Chui was 62, Murong Chui transferred most of the imperial authority to him, only retaining decision power over the most important matters. Battle of Canhe Slope in which Murong Bao was defeated by Tuoba Gui of Northern Wei In 391, Murong Bao was, in all likelihood, involved in an incident that would fatefully lead to the breakup in relations with Later Yan's vassal Northern Wei. That year, Northern Wei's prince Tuoba Gui sent his brother Tuoba Gu (ÊãìÊãîËßö) to offer a tribute to Later Yan. Traditional historians record that Murong Chui's sons and brothers (plural, but by this point would be led by Murong Bao) detained Tuoba Gu and demanded that Tuoba Gui ransom him by offering horses. Tuoba Gui refused, and Tuoba Gu was not permitted to leave, and the relationship between Later Yan and Northern Wei was gone. Tuoba Gui entered into an alliance with Western Yan, and later, even after Western Yan was destroyed by Later Yan in 393, continued to harass Later Yan's border lands. In 395, Murong Bao, along with his brothers Murong Nong and Murong Lin, led an 80,000-men expedition that was intended to punish Northern Wei for its recalcitrance‚Äîbut one that would have fateful consequences for Later Yan. Tuoba Gui, hearing about Murong Bao's army, abandoned his capital Shengle (ÁõõÊ®Ç, in modern Hohhot, Inner Mongolia) and retreated west across the Yellow River. Murong Bao's army quickly reached the river in fall 395 and prepared to cross the river. However, by this point, Northern Wei scouts had cut off the line of communication between Murong Bao's army and the Later Yan capital Zhongshan, and Northern Wei had the captured Later Yan messengers declare that Murong Chui had already died, causing great disturbance in the Later Yan army. The Later Yan and Northern Wei forces stalemated across the Yellow River for 20 odd days, when Murong Lin's followers tried to start a coup and support Murong Lin as new leader, and while the coup failed, uncertainty fell on Later Yan forces. As winter came, Later Yan forces retreated and, not realizing that the Yellow River would freeze to allow Northern Wei forces to cross easily, Murong Bao left no rearguard as he retreated. Tuoba Gui personally gave chase, catching Later Yan forces unprepared at the Battle of Canhe Slope, killing or capturing nearly the entire Later Yan army, and only Murong Bao and a number of officers escaped. Tuoba Gui, fearful of the Later Yan captives, slaughtered them. In 396, concerned that Northern Wei would then view Murong Bao lightly, Murong Chui personally led another expedition against Northern Wei, initially successful and killing Tuoba Gui's cousin Tuoba Qian (ÊãìÊãîËôî). However, as the army reached Canhe Slope, the soldiers cried out loud for their fathers and brothers, and Murong Chui became angry and ill, forcing the Later Yan forces to retreat to Zhongshan. He soon died, and Murong Bao succeeded him as emperor. Reign One of the first things that Murong Bao did as emperor was forcing his stepmother Duan Yuanfei to commit suicide, still resentful that she advised his father to remove him as crown prince. However, he still buried her with his father, with imperial honors. Murong Bao also faced a succession issue. His son Murong Hui the Duke of Qinghe was most favored by Murong Chui and considered the most capable, and when Murong Chui waged his last campaign, he put Murong Hui in charge of the old Former Yan capital, the important city of Longcheng (ÈæçÂüé, in modern Jinzhou, Liaoning). As Murong Chui was on his deathbed, he further told Murong Bao to make Murong Hui his crown prince, but Murong Bao favored his young son Murong Ce (ÊÖïÂÆπÁ≠ñ) the Duke of Puyang, and did not favor Murong Hui. Further, Murong Sheng the Duke of Changle, who was slightly older than Murong Hui, also did not want Murong Hui to be crown prince, and so also encouraged Murong Bao to create Murong Ce crown prince. Murong Bao did so in fall 396, and created Murong Hui and Murong Sheng princes. Murong Hui was displeased and secretly considered rebellion. Murong Bao had more immediate pressing concerns, however. In fall 396 as well, Tuoba Gui led his Northern Wei troops and made a surprise attack on Bing Province (Âπ∂Â∑û, modern central and northern Shanxi), defeating Murong Nong and forcing him to flee back to Zhongshan. Tuoba Gui then advanced east, ready to attack Zhongshan. Accepting Murong Lin's suggestion, Murong Bao prepared to defend Zhongshan, leaving the Northern Wei forces free to roam over his territory, believing that Northern Wei would retreat once its forces are worn out. However, this had the effect that all of the cities' garrisons in modern Hebei abandoned them, except for Zhongshan and two other important cities -- Yecheng and Xindu (‰ø°ÈÉΩ, in modern Hengshui, Hebei). After making an initial attack against Zhongshan and failing, Tuoba Gui changed his tactic to establishing his rule over the other cities while leaving Zhongshan alone. In spring 397, Xindu fell. Meanwhile, however, Tuoba Gui had received news of a rebellion near his capital Shengle and offered peace‚Äîwhich Murong Bao rejected, and Murong Bao attacked Northern Wei forces as Tuoba Gui prepared to retreat, but instead was defeated by Tuoba Gui at great loss. Murong Long offered to lead the remaining forces in Zhongshan in a battle against Northern Wei and Murong Bao agreed, but Murong Bao then vacillated and eventually, because Murong Lin opposed, cancelled the plan. He also vacillated between whether to accept a proposal to return Tuoba Gu to Northern Wei and ceding Bing Province for peace. When Murong Lin subsequently rebelled, Murong Bao worried that Murong Lin would seize Murong Hui's troops (which were then advancing toward Zhongshan to relieve it, but due to Murong Hui's continued resentment was advancing slowly), and so decided to abandon Zhongshan to head for Longcheng. Murong Long agreed with the plan, but outlined to Murong Bao the reasons, once at Longcheng he should not head back south for a long time. Murong Bao agreed, and they abandoned Zhongshan to join Murong Hui's forces. Murong Hui, meanwhile, on the way back to Longcheng, considered seizing power by force and finally resolved to do so. He sent assassins to kill Murong Long and Murong Nong (believing that the two uncles posed the most military threat to him), but was only successful in killing Murong Long. Murong Bao and Murong Nong's forces quickly fled to Longcheng, and Murong Hui subsequently put Longcheng under siege. Under a surprise attack led by Gao Yun, however, Murong Hui's forces collapsed, and he fled back to Zhongshan, where the remaining garrison was under the leadership of Murong Bao's cousin Murong Xiang (ÊÖïÂÆπË©≥) the Duke of Kaifeng. Murong Xiang killed him. Meanwhile, Murong Bao adopted Gao Yun as his own son and created him the Duke of Xiyang. As Murong Bao settled in at Longcheng, Zhongshan and Yecheng lost contact with him. Murong Xiang declared himself emperor, but was soon defeated and killed by Murong Lin, who also declared himself emperor. However, he was soon defeated by Northern Wei forces, and he fled to Yecheng and, giving up his imperial title, persuaded Murong Bao's uncle Murong De, the defender of Yecheng, to abandon it and head south of the Yellow River to Huatai (ÊªëÂè∞, in modern Anyang, Henan). Murong De did so, and once at Huatai, in spring 398, he effectively declared independence by claiming the title Prince of Yan and changing era name, establishing Southern Yan. Meanwhile, not knowing this and having received Murong De's earlier report requesting that he return to the south, Murong Bao prepared a campaign to recover lost territory, against Murong Nong and Murong Sheng's pleas that the army was already worn out. As soon as Murong Bao left Longcheng, however, his general Duan Sugu (ÊÆµÈÄüÈ™®) started a rebellion, and the army abandoned Murong Bao, who immediately fled back to Longcheng. Meanwhile, Duan, having forced Murong Long's son Murong Chong (ÊÖïÂÆπÂ¥á) the Prince of Gaoyang as leader, besieged Longcheng. Even with secret help from Lan Han the Prince of Dunqiu‚ÄîMurong Chui's uncle‚Äîhowever, Duan was initially unsuccessful, until Murong Nong inexplicably surrendered to him, destroying morale and causing Longcheng to fall. Murong Bao and Murong Sheng fled south and, in the confusion, Lan took over Longcheng and offered to receive Murong Bao back. Murong Bao, who had reached Jicheng (modern Beijing) by this point, wanted to head back, but Murong Sheng persuaded to try to head south to seek aid from Murong De, not realizing that Murong De had declared independence. Once they reached the vicinity of Huatai, however, they heard about how Murong De had assumed imperial powers and therefore fled back north. Many cities on the way offered to coalesce around Murong Bao to start a new resistance against Northern Wei, but Murong Bao resolved to head back to Longcheng. Murong Sheng, suspecting that Lan Han was up to no good, tried to persuade Murong Bao otherwise, but was unable to get him to change his mind, and Murong Sheng fled and hid. When Murong Bao approached Longcheng in early summer 398, Lan Han sent his brother Lan Jia'nan (Ëò≠Âä†Èõ£) to welcome Murong Bao but in actuality to guard him. Against the advice of Yu Chong (È§òÂ¥á), Murong Bao accepted Lan Jia'nan's escort, and right outside Longcheng, Lan Jia'nan executed Yu and Murong Bao. Lan Han would then slaughter most of the Murong clan and take over the empire, but spared Murong Sheng (because Murong Sheng was the husband of one of his daughters), and two months later Murong Sheng would overthrow Lan Han and reestablish Later Yan with himself as its emperor.

She is the daughter of musician and singer/songwriter Sir Paul McCartney and photographer/musician Linda McCartney. Early life McCartney was born at Avenue Clinic in London on 28 August 1969 and named after her paternal grandmother, Mary McCartney. She is the first biological child of Paul McCartney of the Beatles and photographer Linda McCartney, and Linda's second child. McCartney has an older half-sister, Heather McCartney, who was born Heather Louise See on 31 December 1962 to Linda and Joseph Melville See Jr. and adopted by Paul McCartney; a younger sister, Stella Nina McCartney, who was born on 13 September 1971; and a younger brother, James Louis McCartney, who was born on 12 September 1977. Mary McCartney's mother Linda died from breast cancer in 1998. Her mother was Jewish.https://forward.com/culture/186536/secret-history-of-paul-mccartney- the-jewish-beatle/ The McCartney siblings have a much younger half-sister, Beatrice Milly McCartney, born to her father and his second wife, Heather Mills, on 28 October 2003. The most famous photograph of McCartney was taken by her mother; it is a photograph of her in 1970 as a baby, peeking out from inside her father's jacket. The photograph is featured on the back cover of her father's first solo album, McCartney. After the birth of her sister Stella, McCartney's parents formed the rock group Wings, with whom she and her siblings travelled the world until 1980. She grew up to be a vegetarian and is passionate about animal rights like the rest of her family.Peta's Animal Times. Autumn 2007. Page 3 Professional life Mary McCartney is a professional British photographer. She was a photo editor for the music-book publisher Omnibus Press and in 1992 began taking photographs professionally, specializing in portrait photography. Because her paternal grandmother and her mother died of breast cancer, she began campaigning for breast cancer awareness in the United Kingdom. As a result, she became close friends with Cherie Blair, wife of former UK prime minister Tony Blair. This led to McCartney being chosen to take the first official photo of the prime minister and his wife with their fourth child, Leo, born 20 May 2000. Before this, the most well-known photos of hers were the last photographs taken of her mother, three weeks before her death. McCartney has taken portraits of Sam Taylor- Wood, Ralph Fiennes, Jude Law, and of her sister Stella McCartney, who is a fashion designer. Her first public photography exhibition was titled Off Pointe: A Photographic Study of The Royal Ballet After Hours. It includes offstage pictures of members of \\"The Royal Ballet, London\\" as part of the Brighton Festival Fringe, and was meant to showcase the difference between their grueling and often painful everyday lives and their storybook performances. In 2001, McCartney produced the television documentary Wingspan, a story of her father's post-Beatles musical career, focusing on her parents' band Wings. She also interviews her father in the film. In addition to her own photographic career, McCartney works with the family on her mother's legacy and photographic archive housed at her father's company, MPL Communications. In 2012, McCartney collaborated with mobile phone manufacturer Vertu and children's medical charity Smile Train. Traveling to Beijing and Volgograd, McCartney photographed four children who benefited from the rehabilitative surgery provided by Smile Train. The Constellation Smile project culminated in a photography exhibition in London on 12 June, followed by an international tour. Outside of photography and filmmaking, McCartney is a committed vegetarian and co-founder of Meat Free Monday and an ambassador for Green Monday, both nonprofit organizations that campaign for sustainable, meat-free living across the globe. She is the author of two vegetarian cookbooks, a consultant for Linda McCartney Foods and a guest chef on the Food Network's Kitchen App. McCartney has written two vegetarian cookbooks, Food: Vegetarian Home Cooking (2012) and At My Table: Vegetarian Feasts for Family and Friends (2015). Personal life In 1995, McCartney's brother James introduced her to director and television producer Alistair Donald. After dating for three years, they set a wedding date for May 1998. Upon the death of her mother, the wedding was postponed and McCartney and Alistair Donald were married on 26 September 1998. Mary Anna McCartney was then known as Mary Anna McCartney- Donald. On 3 April 1999, McCartney gave birth to her father's first grandchild, Arthur Donald, who is the eldest of eight grandchildren. The Donalds' second son, Elliot Donald, was born on 1 August 2002. In April 2005, the couple announced their separation, but stated that it was only temporary and they wished to reconcile for the sake of their two sons. Although there was no public confirmation of a divorce, by 2007 she had returned to using her birth name professionally. On 11 August 2008, McCartney gave birth to her third son, her first with director boyfriend Simon Aboud. On 12 June 2010, McCartney and Aboud were married in a private ceremony in London at the Marylebone Register Office, the same location where her parents were married in 1969. On 3 September 2011, McCartney gave birth to her second son with Aboud.

Alexander Ilyich Siloti (also Ziloti, , Aleksandr Iljiƒç Ziloti, ;Spelling note: The current transliteration of his surname into English is Ziloti; however, it is usually seen in its German transliteration Siloti; and it was his choice of spelling. Initial s in German is pronounced z. 9 October 1863 ‚Äì 8 December 1945) was a Russian pianist, conductor and composer. His daughter, Kyriena Siloti, was also a noted pianist and teacher in New York and Boston until her death in 1989, aged 94.  Biography  Alexander Siloti was born on his father's estate near Kharkiv, Ukraine (then part of Imperial Russia). He studied piano at the Moscow Conservatory with Nikolai Zverev from 1871, then from 1875 under Nikolai Rubinstein, brother of the more famous Anton Rubinstein; from that year he also studied counterpoint under Sergei Taneyev,Barber (2002), p. 2. harmony under Pyotr Ilyich Tchaikovsky, and theory under Nikolai Hubert.Barber (2002), p. 5. He graduated with the Gold Medal in Piano in 1881. Siloti went to Weimar, Germany to further his studies with Franz Liszt, co-founding the Liszt-Verein in Leipzig, and making his professional debut on 19 November 1883. Returning to Russia in 1887, Siloti taught at the Moscow Conservatory, where his students included Alexander Goldenweiser, Leonid Maximov, and his first cousin Sergei Rachmaninoff. During this period he also began work as editor for Tchaikovsky, particularly on the First and Second piano concertos.Kutateladze & Raaben Siloti married Vera Tretyakova, herself a pianist and the daughter of wealthy industrialist and art collector Pavel Tretyakov. He left his post at the Conservatory in May 1891, and from 1892-1900 lived and toured in Europe with his wife and young children. He also toured New York City, Boston, Cincinnati and Chicago in 1898. As a conductor Siloti gave the world premiere of Rachmaninoff's Piano Concerto No. 2 with the composer as soloist in 1901. From 1901‚Äì1903, he led the Moscow Philharmonic; from 1903‚Äì1917, he organized, financed, and conducted the influential Siloti Concerts in St Petersburg, collaborating with the critic and musicologist Alexander Ossovsky. He presented Leopold Auer, Pablo Casals, Feodor Chaliapin, George Enescu, Josef Hofmann, Wanda Landowska, Willem Mengelberg, Felix Mottl, Arthur Nikisch, Arnold Schoenberg and Felix Weingartner, and local and world premieres by Debussy, Elgar, Glazunov, Prokofiev, Rachmaninoff, Rimsky-Korsakov, Scriabin, Sibelius, Stravinsky and others. Ballet impresario Sergei Diaghilev first heard Stravinsky's music at one of the Siloti Concerts. In the generation prior to 1917, Siloti was one of Russia's most important artists, with music by Arensky, Liszt, Rachmaninoff, Stravinsky and Tchaikovsky dedicated to him. In 1918, Siloti was appointed Intendant of the Mariinsky Theatre, but late the following year fled what had become Soviet Russia for England, finally settling in New York City in December 1921. From 1925-1942 he taught at the Juilliard School, performing occasionally in recital, and in November 1930 gave a legendary all-Liszt concert with Arturo Toscanini. His many students included Bertha Melnik, Marc Blitzstein, Gladys Ewart, and Eugene Istomin. Siloti, who was one of the great practitioners of the art of transcription, wrote over 200 of these arrangements, as well as orchestral editions of the music of Bach, Beethoven, Liszt, Tchaikovsky and Vivaldi. Possibly his most famous transcription is the Prelude in B minor, based on a keyboard prelude by J. S. Bach. As a pianist Siloti made 8 piano rolls and 26 minutes of home- recorded discs. Carl Fischer has published a large anthology of his piano transcriptions, and Rowman and Littlefield has published the first full-scale Alexander Siloti biography. In 2014, the Alexander Siloti Archive at Stanford University was donated by author and alumnus Charles Barber. In six linear feet, it contains all of the correspondence, documentation, music and manuscripts acquired for the writing of the Siloti biography called Lost in the Stars, and for publication of the 'Alexander Siloti Collection' of piano music. Alexander Siloti is buried at the Russian Orthodox Convent Novo-Diveevo Cemetery, Nanuet, New York.  References  Sources  * C. Barber.

The town sits on the Princes Highway, and is connected by road to Moruya, Narooma, Nerrigundah, Eurobodalla and Potato Point. The Yuin people are considered to be the traditional owners of the region, and it is from their language that the town and the previous estate and station derived its name. Several meanings have been put forward including Boat Alley\\", \\"tossing a child up in the arms\\", \\"haven for boats\\", and \\"several waters\\". Thomas Sutcliffe Mort A Dairy herd in Bodalla, circa 1900. From 1856, Thomas Sutcliffe Mort had been acquiring land in the Moruya district, and eventually owned some 38,000 acres (150 km¬≤), a very substantial holding. In 1860 he purchased Bodalla Station, where he planned to establish a country estate on which to retire, and demonstrate model land usage and rural settlement. He replaced the beef cattle station with an integrated and tenanted dairy estate. He cleared land, drained river swamps, erected fences, laid out farms, sowed imported grasses, and provided milking sheds, cheese, and butter-making equipment. He also provided two bluestone churches, one Anglican and the other Catholic, for his tenants. By the 1870s, his sharefarming tenants had become disgruntled and left. The estate fell into his sole control, and was run as three farms with hired labour. After he died in 1878, his trustees took over running the farms. In 1887, they set up the Bodalla Company to put the main asset of the estate on a business footing. Sometime around the end of 1883, the trustees constructed a horse tramway from near the Bodalla Post Office to the North Narooma Wharf at Wagonga Heads to provide great savings in conveying the produce of the estate to market in Sydney. One horse by tramway could easily haul as much as three could by road. The tramway closed between 1889 and 1891 with the reconstruction of local coastal roads.The Bodalla Cheese Tramway Longworth, Jim Australian Railway Historical Society Bulletin, November, 1995 pp322-324 Another initiative launched by the trustees was the establishment of a commercial outlet in the Strand Arcade in the Sydney CBD to sell the milk, butter, cheese and bacon manufactured on the estate. Eventually the factory was bought out by the Bodalla Dairy Co-operative, who ran it until it closed in 1987, when it was being supplied by only thirteen farms. These farms transferred their supply to the dairy company at Bega. Bodalla Cheese is now a brand associated with Fonterra Brands (Australia) Pty Ltd., formerly Bonland Dairies. Fonterra is a New Zealand-owned dairy company. The Big Cheese Visitors' Centre was once part of the old factory, and is one of Australia's many \\"big\\" roadside tourist attractions. It is located on the northern outskirts of the town, and was closed in 2007.  All Saints Church  All Saints Church, commemorating Thomas Sutcliffe Mort and his wife Theresa Shepheard Mort, was designed by Edmund Blacket. The foundation stone was laid by Marianne Mort, Thomas' second wife, on 18 March 1880. It was completed in 1901. The church has one of seven small Henry Willis & Sons organs, built in 1881 and installed the following year. The church cost 13,000 Pounds Sterling to construct.

Geometric formulation More precisely, one should consider algebraic curves C of a given genus g, and their Jacobians \\\\operatorname{Jac}(C). There is a moduli space \\\\mathcal{M}_g of such curves, and a moduli space of abelian varieties, \\\\mathcal{A}_g, of dimension g, which are principally polarized. There is a morphism > \\\\operatorname{Jac}: \\\\mathcal{M}_g \\\\to \\\\mathcal{A}_g which on points (geometric points, to be more accurate) takes isomorphism class [C] to [\\\\operatorname{Jac}(C)]. The content of Torelli's theorem is that \\\\operatorname{Jac} is injective (again, on points). The Schottky problem asks for a description of the image of \\\\operatorname{Jac}, denoted \\\\mathcal{J}_g = \\\\operatorname{Jac}(\\\\mathcal{M}_g). The dimension of \\\\mathcal{M}_g is 3g - 3,follows from elementary Deformation Theory for g \\\\geq 2, while the dimension of \\\\mathcal{A}_g is g(g + 1)/2. This means that the dimensions are the same (0, 1, 3, 6) for g = 0, 1, 2, 3. Therefore g = 4 is the first case where the dimensions change, and this was studied by F. Schottky in the 1880s. Schottky applied the theta constants, which are modular forms for the Siegel upper half-space, to define the Schottky locus in \\\\mathcal{A}_g. A more precise form of the question is to determine whether the image of \\\\operatorname{Jac} essentially coincides with the Schottky locus (in other words, whether it is Zariski dense there).  Dimension 1 case  All elliptic curves are the Jacobian of themselves, hence the moduli stack of elliptic curves \\\\mathcal{M}_{1,1} is a model for \\\\mathcal{A}_1.  Dimensions 2 and 3  In the case of Abelian surfaces, there are two types of Abelian varieties: the Jacobian of a genus 2 curve, or the product of Jacobians of elliptic curves. This means the moduli spaces > \\\\mathcal{M}_2, \\\\mathcal{M}_{1,1}\\\\times \\\\mathcal{M}_{1,1} embed into \\\\mathcal{A}_2. There is a similar description for dimension 3 since an Abelian variety can be the product of Jacobians. Period lattice formulation If one describes the moduli space \\\\mathcal{A}_g in intuitive terms, as the parameters on which an abelian variety depends, then the Schottky problem asks simply what condition on the parameters implies that the abelian variety comes from a curve's Jacobian. The classical case, over the complex number field, has received most of the attention, and then an abelian variety A is simply a complex torus of a particular type, arising from a lattice in Cg. In relatively concrete terms, it is being asked which lattices are the period lattices of compact Riemann surfaces. Riemann's matrix formulation Note that a Riemann matrix is quite different from any Riemann tensor One of the major achievements of Bernhard Riemann was his theory of complex tori and theta functions. Using the Riemann theta function, necessary and sufficient conditions on a lattice were written down by Riemann for a lattice in Cg to have the corresponding torus embed into complex projective space. (The interpretation may have come later, with Solomon Lefschetz, but Riemann's theory was definitive.) The data is what is now called a Riemann matrix. Therefore the complex Schottky problem becomes the question of characterising the period matrices of compact Riemann surfaces of genus g, formed by integrating a basis for the abelian integrals round a basis for the first homology group, amongst all Riemann matrices.

The novel is a retelling of the King Arthur legend.  Awards  The World Fantasy Award nominee Firelord (1980). The novel was later published as a book in Germany (Feuerk√∂nig - Die Camelot-Chronik). The Balrog Award and Locus Poll Award nominee Firelord as well.  Firelord sequence  Beloved Exile (1984) is the second book in the Firelord trilogy. It and Firelord were later published as one book in Germany (Feuerk√∂nig; Die Erbin von Camelot).  Short stories  \\"Uallannach - Invitation to Camelot\\" was written by Parke Godwin in 1988. It was later published by Editor Mike Ashley in London (Chronicles of the Round Table).  Synopsis  The novel begins with a mortally wounded Arthur dictating his memoir to a friar at a monastery after the Battle of Camlann. In flashback the reader is led through his formative years, his first meeting with Merlin, his rise to fame in the service of the British High King Ambrosius Aurelianus, his military campaigns against the Saxons, and his eventual downfall. Despite some fantasy elements, Godwin aims to tell the story of King Arthur from a historically accurate perspective, based on his own research, including archeological trips to various parts of England. He returns the Arthurian characters to the time period and place in which they might actually have lived - 5th-century post-Roman Wales and Cornwall. He uses historically appropriate Latin and Brythonic names for the characters, such as Artos and Artorius for Arthur, Gwenhwyfar for Guinevere, and (the conjectural) Ancellius for Lancelot. Morgan le Fay, called Morgana, is a sympathetic character in Firelord. She is presented as a fiery leader of the wild Prydn people who live north of Hadrian's Wall. However, Guinevere is the principal female character. At the center of the novel, Godwin's Arthur is torn between his desire for the simple joy of love and family (represented by Morgana) and his ambition to fulfill his destiny to become Emperor of Britain (represented by Guinevere).

Schools are divided into three classes by total enrollment in grades 9-12: A (less than 433 students), AA (460-871 students), and AAA (more than 933 students), with schools re-classed every four years. Football, basketball, baseball, cheerleading, golf, softball, track, and volleyball are broken into these three classes. Soccer, Cross country, tennis, and wrestling are broken into two classes (AAA and AA/A). Swimming is one class only. The organization began with boys' basketball championships in 1914. The organization excluded private schools until 1979, when it merged with the state Catholic League. Today it also includes private schools of various religious viewpoints, along with all public schools in the state. Unlike similar governing bodies in the United States, the WVSSAC does not dictate individual high school schedules during the regular season; those decisions are made by the coaches involved. Note that the WVSSAC does set forth some basic guidelines (i.e., the number of schools within its own classification or higher that a school must compete against) for a school to be eligible for that sport's playoffs. The WVSSAC determines scheduling during the playoffs. For example, in football, whose playoffs are seeded on a statewide basis, each game is played at the higher- seeded school's campus if its stadium is approved by the SSAC to host playoff matches. Otherwise, it is played at the SSAC-approved venue nearest to the higher-seeded school. The lower-seeded school has the choice of one of three starting times ‚Äî 7:30 pm on Friday or Saturday, or 1:30 pm on Saturday.

Board of Education, West Virginia maintained \\"colored\\" high schools. These schools, and thus their students, were barred from competition in the WVSSAC. The institution now known as West Virginia State University funded an unofficial \\"state colored championship\\" in basketball and football until 1959. The WVSSAC historical records take no note of these champions, and does not note that its champions prior to that year competed in a system that excluded many of the state's best athletes. West Virginia was one of only three states to hold girls' basketball in the fall, and girls' volleyball in the winter, ostensibly due to facility shortages at various high schools. Eventually the West Virginia Supreme Court of Appeals ruled that this unfairly disadvantaged girls in competition for college scholarships and the organization was forced to adopt a traditional schedule. There have also been complaints that the disparity of enrollment in Class AAA makes it difficult for the smaller schools in the classification to compete, particularly in football. There is a 1032 student difference between Cabell Midland and Ripley, Cabell Midland being the largest and Ripley being the smallest schools in the class respectively. On the other hand, there is only a 473 student difference between Ripley and the smallest Class AA school, Man. The last time a AAA school with an enrollment under 1000 students won a football championship was Nitro in 1998. In the 2016 re-class the number of AAA schools was reduced in order to reduce the disparity in enrollment.

Phillip Shaw Paludan, Law And Equal Rights: The Civil War Encounter‚ÄîA Study Of Legal Minds In The Civil War Era 227 (Sept. 1968) (Ph.D. dissertation, University of Illinois). Early Life John Norton Pomeroy was born on April 12th, 1828 in Rochester, New York.John Norton Pomeroy, Jr., John Norton Pomeroy 1828-1885, in GREAT AMERICAN LAWYERS (William Draper Lewis, ed. 1907-09). Enos Pomeroy, his father, was a pioneer settler in Rochester as well as one of the first lawyers to practice in western New York. Pomeroy started at Hamilton College in Clinton, New York at just 15 years old. He was a member of the Sigma Phi fraternity and graduated at 1847.Lewis A. Grossman, John Norton Pomeroy in YALE BIOGRAPHICAL DICTIONARY OF AMERICAN LAW (Roger K. Newman, ed., 2008). After graduating from college, he served as an instructor of Rochester Academy. After three years, he was promoted to lead their campus at Lebanon, Ohio. He next began to study law by apprenticing in Cincinnati in the law office of Senator Thomas Corwin. In 1851, Pomeroy was admitted to the New York and then returned to practice in Rochester as part of the office of Henry R. Selden. He then served as Judge of the New York Court of Appeals and was admitted to the bar in 1851, practicing in Rochester until 1861. There he ‚Äúdisplayed a genuine scholarly bent that a cynic might feel was confirmed by the fact that in his nine years of practice in Rochester, his native town, he had little if any business.‚ÄùThomas Garden Barnes, HASTINGS COLLEGE OF THE LAW: THE FIRST CENTURY 67 (1978). He married Ann Rebecca Carter, one of his former pupils in 1855. Pomeroy moved to New York City in 1861 to try to start his own law practice. He was not successful, instead resorting to working as a school teacher again. For four years served as the principal of a boy‚Äôs school called the Academy in Kingston, New York. It was there he wrote his first book, An Introduction to Municipal Law, in 1864. It was designed as a book for the general lay reader and as a textbook for colleges and law schools. Tenure at New York University Law School The success surrounding the publication of Introduction to Municipal Law earned him an LL.D degree from his alma mater and an appointment to University of New York City as a professor of Law, and later chair of political science in the undergraduate department. Pomeroy later served as dean of the recently established school until 1871. While teaching, he also wrote the treatise, Introduction to the Constitutional Law of the United States, in 1868, which was the first legal text on constitutional law published after the Civil War. He was known to use the ‚Äúconference‚Äù or seminar method. Pomeroy developed this system as using a ‚Äúprinted ‚Äòsyllabus‚Äô or outline of topics, with lists of illustrative cases, and the first-hand study, of these cases and their free discussion in the class room.‚Äù He believed that the ‚Äúcentral principle of all true education, whether professional or general‚Äù is that the student ‚Äúmust be taught and accustomed to acquire [knowledge] for himself.‚Äù United States Secretary of State Elihu Root, one of his pupils, described his teaching style as highly personal and centered on small class sizes: ::I came to this city, and found Professor Pomeroy alone in the library of the University Law School, then a struggling institution, with but few students, a limited library, and a professor. For the two years which succeeded, the greater part of my time was passed in that library, with that professor. . . . The students were few in number; each one knew the professor personally, intimately, and was with him day by day, hour after hour, sometimes from the early morning until late in the evening; the whole day being occupied in the library with the professor there, the studies interspersed with occasional questions and an swers, and discussions; and impromptu moot-courts coming up without any premeditation; so that we had opportunity not only to receive systematic instruction, but to know the man. He thought that law school should last three years and at least provide an elementary understanding of all of the basic doctrines of law, rather than an intimate knowledge of a smaller range of topics. In his view, legal education should be practical launching off point, rather than an end in of itself. His expressed these views in his inaugural address, on taking the chair of municipal law in the University of California, in 1878: He also believed that law school should last three years and at least provide an elementary understanding of all of the basic doctrines of law, rather than an intimate knowledge of a smaller range of topics. In his view, legal education should be practical launching off point, rather than an end in of itself. His expressed these views in his inaugural address, on taking the chair of municipal law in the University of California, in 1878: ::In the first place, I most profoundly believe that the law must be studied historically. . . . But while the historical method of study is thus absolutely essential, it is one thing to study the present existing law of the United States historically, and a very different thing, under the name of the historical method, to study only the law which existed and was in full operation in England a century ago. It is absolutely astonishing‚Äîit would be incredible in any other profession‚Äîhow much time of students all over this vast country is wasted every year in learning doctrines and rules of the English law which are utterly obsolete, which were always arbitrary in their nature, and do not therefore aid in understanding the law of the present day‚Äîwhich must be forgotten and banished from the mind as soon as learned, and which only tend to interfere with and hinder a full and accurate comprehension of the rules which are now in active operation and are daily ad ministered by our courts. It is not so in any other profession. . . . In a word, it will be the aim of this law school to base its teaching upon the actual jurisprudence of the American states; to present to its classes living principles and doctrines which are embodied in that jurisprudence, and thus to prepare them for entering at once upon the professional life for which they are obtaining a fitting preparation.Hastings Law Department of the University of California: Inaugural Address by John North Pomeroy, LL.D., Professor of Municipal Law, August 8, 1878 (San Francisco, Calif.: A. L. Bancroft & Company, 1878). In 1871, he resigned from his position and returned to Rochester due to ill health. There he continued his legal writing on codes and codification. Six years later published Remedies and Remedial Rights to meet the need for a text that could clarify the changes in practice resulting from the codification of law across many states. He also wrote almost two hundred articles on legal topics for Johnson‚Äôs Encyclopedia, of which he became an assistant editor, helped prepare annotated editions of Theodore Sedgwick‚Äôs Statutory and Constitutional Law (1874) and Archbold‚Äôs Criminal Procedure (1877), and was a contributor to The Nation and the American Law Review on topics ranging from international law and diplomacy to constitutional law. Tenure at Hastings College of the Law In 1878, the University of California opened Hastings School of Law in San Francisco, California, the state‚Äôs first law school. The reputation he built as a legal writer helped lead to an appointment there. Serranus Clinton Hastings, California‚Äôs first Chief Justice and third Attorney General, selected Professor Pomeroy to lead the development of Hastings Law‚Äôs legal education. Before the first meeting of the faculty on August 8, 1878, the Board of the College created a Professorship of Municipal Law with a salary $300 per month, appointing Pomeroy to that position. They first directed him to draw up his ‚Äúwhole system‚Äù of legal education to present to the Board and asked him to lecture 10 hours a week. This was the only direction given to him. Pomeroy was given wide latitude to set up this institution for the first 103 students. Pomeroy served as both its main administrator and sole professor of Hastings by himself during its early years. Those duties entailed serving almost two hundred students across three large classes, while making himself a master of the many peculiarities of California state law. On top of that, he worked on A Treatise on the Specific Performance of Contracts, which was published in 1879. For the next four years, he worked on perhaps his most notable work, Equity Jurisprudence. This three-volume text, published between 1881 and 1883, greatly shaped the development of equity law in the United States. Case reporting was developing into its present system at the time, and Pomeroy edited the main West Coast Reporter with his son Carter Pitkin.John C. Leary, John Norton Pomeroy, 1828-1885: A Biographical Sketch, 47 LAW LIBR. J. 138 (1954) Another influential work he published at this time was a series of articles entitled, The True Method of Interpreting the Civil Code. In 1872, California enacted a new substantive Civil Code based on a draft by Field. Pomeroy felt dismayed at how the code operated, deeming it full of ‚Äúdefects, imperfections, omissions, and . . . inconsistencies.‚Äù He believed that judges should use the code simply as a guide of common law rules and practices rather than an authoritative source of law. The California Supreme Court adopted the approached he laid out in his True Method articles in 1888. Later Years and Death Between 1882 and 1884, Pomeroy served as counsel in the Railroad Tax Cases, in involved grave questions of constitutional law. He also served as counsel on behalf of the farmers in the Debris' Case, which shaped the economic history of California by enjoining the industry of hydraulic mining that was polluting the California river ways. Although Pomeroy was known for his writing, he was also a skilled orator in the courtroom. A California judge who he appeared before in San Mateo complimented his presentation, calling it ‚Äúlucid and eminently instructive.‚Äù At the time of his death, Pomeroy was starting a treatise on Equity Pleading, which was set to review the equity practice with the supreme courts of each state. He also intended to draft a modern version of James Kent‚Äôs Commentaries on American Law, Institutes of American Law as well as a second treatise on constitutional law. He died at 56 years old at his home on the corner of Clay and Hyde Streets in San Francisco, after a brief illness of pneumonia on February 15th, 1885.Professor Pomeroy Dead, SAN FRANCISCO CHRONICLE, Feb. 15, 1885, at 8. He was buried in Mountain View Cemetery across the bay in Oakland, California.

A xoanon (, ; plural: ŒæœåŒ±ŒΩŒ± xoana, from the verb ŒæŒ≠ŒµŒπŒΩ, xeein, to carve or scrape [wood] Bennett appends a list of the sixty-six xoana mentioned by Pausanias, who sometimes uses the phrase xylon agalma, \\"sculptured image of wood\\") was an Archaic wooden cult image of Ancient Greece. Classical Greeks associated such cult objects, whether aniconic or effigy, with the legendary Daedalus. Many such cult images were preserved into historical times, though none are known to have survived to the modern day, except as copies in stone or marble. In the 2nd century CE, Pausanias described numerous xoana in his Description of Greece, notably the image of Hera in her temple at Samos. \\"The statue of the Samian Hera, as Aethilos [sicThe name Aethilos in the available text is thought to be a mis- spelling of Aethlios.] says, was a wooden beam at first, but afterwards, when Prokles was ruler, it was humanized in form\\". In Pausanias' travels he never mentions seeing a xoanon of a \\"mortal man\\". Types of xoana Some types of archaic xoana may be reflected in archaic marble versions, such as the pillar- like \\"Hera of Samos\\" (Louvre Museum), the flat \\"Hera of Delos\\" or some archaic kouros-type figures that may have been used to represent Apollo. A different type of cult figure in which the face, hands, and feet were carved of marble and the rest of the body made of wood is called acrolith. The wooden part was usually covered either with cloth or gold leaf. Woods and textiles For Strabo, the \\"carved\\" xoanon might also be of ivory;Thus Strabo describes the chryselephantine sculptures of Phidian Zeus and Polyclitan Hera as xoana, and even the marble Nemesis at Rhamnus, as Frazer noted (Frazer 1897). Pausanias, however, always uses xoanon in its strict sense, to denote a wooden image; at Corinth Pausanias noted that \\"The sanctuary of Athena Chalinitis is by the theater, and near it is a naked xoanon of Herakles, said to be by Daidalos. All the works of this artist, though somewhat uncouth to look at, nevertheless have a touch of the divine in them.\\" Similar xoana were ascribed by the Greeks to the contemporary of Daedalus, the equally legendary Smilis. Such figures were often clothed in real textiles, such as the peplos that was woven and ceremonially delivered to Athena on the Acropolis of Athens into historic times. The wood of which a xoanon was carved was often symbolic: olivewood,The olive is sacred to Athena. pearwood, Vitex, oak,The oak is especially sacred to Zeus. are all specifically mentioned. In Athens, in the Erechtheum, an ancient olivewood effigy of Athena (the Palladion) was preserved. The Athenians believed it had fallen to earth from the heavens, as a gift to Athens; it was still to be seen in the 2nd century CE. On the island of Icaria a rustic piece of wood was venerated for the spirit of Artemis it contained or represented (Burkert).Ovid describes how in the cave of Cybele numerous wooden images are to be seen in . Copies of venerable images Synthesizing the Lady of Ephesus as Diana Aventina: a Roman marble copy of a Greek replica of a lost Geometric period xoanon (18th-century engraving). Such an archaic image of wood of the Tauric goddess was stolen by Iphigeneia and Orestes in Iphigeneia in Tauris (line 1359). The importance of the xoanon in local cult ensured that it would be carefully copied when colonies were founded, and sent out with the colonists from the mother-city. Strabo (4.1) reports that the metropolis Massilia (modern Marseille) was founded by Phocaeans. Their cult of Artemis of Ephesus was transferred with the colony, justified in the founding myth by a dream, and the artistic design of the cult image ‚Äî Strabo uses the term diathesis (Greek Œ¥ŒπŒ¨Œ∏ŒµœÉŒπœÇ) ‚Äî was re-exported to Massiliote sub-colonies, \\"where they keep the diathesis of the xoanon the same, and all the other usages precisely the same as is customary in the mother-city\\".Strabo, as quoted in Similarly, cementing cultural ties between the Phocaean colony at Massilia and the Phocaean community in Rome, \\"Among the others, the Romans have consecrated Artemis' xoanon on the Aventine, taking the same model from the Massiliotes\\" (Strabo, 4.1.5). So the cult image of the Lady of Ephesus, identified as Artemis in Greek understanding, was established as Diana Aventina at Rome, of whom marble copies survive (see illustration at right).

He is worshipped as the god of wisdom, complete and rewarding meditation.Magick of the Gods and Goddesses: Invoking the Power of the Ancient Gods By D. J. Conway p.284 As per scriptures, if a person doesn't have a Paramaguru, then they can consider and worship Lord Dhakshinamoorthy as their Guru. Eventually they will be blessed with a human Self-Realised Guru, if they are worthy. Meaning Lord Dakshinamurti sitting under a Banyan tree. Dakshinamurti literally means 'one who is facing south ()' in Sanskrit. According to another school of thought 'Dakshinya' means Karuna in Sanskrit or kindness (benevolence). So this manifestation of Shiva is a benevolent teacher who accords wisdom to seekers of salvation. Shiva to Shankara: Decoding the Phallic Symbol By Dr. Devdutt Pattanaik p.139 In most of the Siva temples, the stone image of Dakshinamurthy is installed, facing south, on the southern circumambulatory path around the sanctum sanctorum. Perhaps, of all Hindu Gods, he is the only one sitting facing south. The great seer Ramana Maharshi, has said in letter 89: one meaning of Dakshina is efficient; another meaning is ‚Äòin the heart on the right side of the body‚Äô; Amurthy ‚Äômeans Formlessness' . \\"Dakshinamurthy Stotra\\" in Sanskrit, means the \\"Shapelessness situated on the right side\\". Statue of Dakshinamoorthy, Tamil Nadu, 10th century Depiction Dakshinamurti, 16th century, Mus√©e Guimet (museum), Paris. In his aspect as Jnana Dakshinamurti, Shiva is generally shown with four arms. He is depicted seated under a banyan tree, facing the south. Shiva is seated upon a deer- throne and surrounded by sages who are receiving his instruction.For the deer- throne and the audience of sages as , see: Chakravarti, p. 155. He is shown as seated with his right foot on mythical apasmara (a demon which, according to Hindu mythology, is the personification of ignorance) and his left foot lies folded on his lap. Sometimes even the wild animals, are depicted to surround Shiva. In his upper arms, he holds a snake or rosary or both in one hand and a flame in the other; while in his lower right hand is shown in vyakhyanamudra, his lower left hand holds a bundle of kusha grass or the scriptures. The index finger of His right hand is bent and touching the tip of his thumb. The other three fingers are stretched apart. This symbolic hand gesture or Mudra is the Gnana Mudra (or Jnana Mudra or Jana Mudra), a symbol of knowledge and wisdom. Sometimes, this hand is in the Abhaya Mudra, a posture of assurance and blessing. In Melakadambur the statue of the Dakshinamurthy appears seated on a bull under a banyan tree with a hole extending from one ear to the other. Dakshinamurthy is portrayed as a powerful form brimming with ever-flowing bliss and supreme joy while being in the yogic state of abstract meditation. Variations of this iconic representation include Veenadhara Dakshinamurthy (holding a Veena) and Rishabharooda Dakshinamurthy (mounted on a Rishabha - the bull). Significance Worshipers at Dakshinamurthy temple at Brihadeeswarar temple Indian tradition accords a special reverence to the Guru or the teacher. Dakshinamurthy, in the Hindu system of beliefs is regarded as the ultimate Guru - the embodiment of knowledge and the personification of ignorance (as represented by, the demon being crushed under the feet of the deity). The Jnana Mudra is interpreted in this way:- The thumb denotes the God and the index finger denotes the man. The other three fingers stand for the three congenital impurities of man viz. arrogance, illusion and bad deeds of the past births. When man detaches himself from these impurities, he reaches God. Another interpretation is that the other three fingers denote the three states of life: Jagruti (Fully awake through senses and mind), Swapna (Sleep state - When the mind is awake) and Sushupti (True-self - When the senses and mind go into soul - Atma). The Abhaya Mudra, a gesture with the hand lifted above thigh with palm facing out, fingers pointing, is interpreted as His grace upon His students. The rosary or the snake signifies tantric knowledge. The fire represents illumination, removing the darkness of ignorance. Impact on Indian Life The fifth day of the week, Thursday is associated with the planet Jupiter and is referred to as Guru (Guruvar or Guruvaaram). Thursdays are considered auspicious to start any educational endeavours. It is on Thursdays that special worship services are offered to Dakshinamurthy in many Saivite temples. Some temple traditions hold full moon nights, particularly the night of the Guru Purnima as the appropriate time for worship services to Dakshinamurthy. Temples The Gopuram of Kapaleeshwarar temple, Chennai depicts two sculptures of Dakshinamurthy: one playing the veena, another in a meditative state.

Electroblotting is based upon the same principle. DNA extraction Using this method, DNA fragments can be recovered from a particular region of agarose or polyacrylamide gels. The gel piece containing the fragment is excised (cut out from the whole gel) and placed in a dialysis bag with buffer. Electrophoresis causes the DNA to migrate out of the gel into the dialysis bag buffer. The DNA fragments are recovered from this buffer and purified, using phenol/chloroform extraction followed by ethanol precipitation. This method is simple, rapid and yields high (75%) recovery of DNA fragments from gel pieces.

He had the rank of archbishop and the title of nuncio from 1985, fulfilling assignments in Burundi, Indonesia, Cyprus, Israel, Jerusalem and Palestine, and the United States. Biography Sambi was born in Sogliano al Rubicone (Forl√¨-Cesena), Italy, on 27 June 1938. He spoke Italian, English, French and Spanish. He was ordained to the priesthood for the Diocese of San Marino-Montefeltro on 14 March 1964 and earned degrees in theology and canon law. At the Diocesan Seminary in Pennabilli he was responsible for priestly formation and then became Vice Rector. He entered the diplomatic service of the Holy See in 1969, serving first at the nunciature in Cameroon. He moved to the Apostolic Nunciature in Jerusalem on 19 July 1971, and then to the Apostolic Nunciatures in Cuba in 1974, Algeria in 1978, Nicaragua in 1979, Belgium in 1981, and India in May 1984 with the rank of counselor. In Nicaragua, he was named charge d'affaires just after the leftist Sandinistas under Daniel Ortega came to power and mediated between the Catholic bishops who opposed priests' participation in the government and priests who held prominent government offices in the socialist government. On 10 October 1985, Pope John Paul II named him pro-nuncio to Burundi and titular archbishop of Bellicastrum. In 1991 he was made pro-nuncio to Indonesia. On 6 June 1998 he was named to several positions concurrently: Nuncio to Israel and to Cyprus and Apostolic Delegate in Jerusalem and Palestine. When the Basilica of the Nativity in Bethlehem became the center of a stalemate between Palestinian Israeli forces, he negotiated a peaceful resolution. He also criticized Israel's construction of a wall to separate the Palestinian territories from Israel. In March 2003 he warned that Palestinian plans for self-government made no allowance for the practice of religions other than Islam. He also criticized the anti-Semitism found in Palestinian schoolbooks and successfully campaigned for Italy to discontinue support for educational initiatives that used such works. He campaigned for a special status for Jerusalem that would allow it to serve as the center of several major religions. In 2005, he complained that Israel was failing to implement agreements reached with the Holy See over church properties and the treatment of Catholic Arabs in Jerusalem more than a decade earlier. Pope Benedict XVI named Sambi the Apostolic Nuncio to the United States and Permanent Observer of the Holy See to the Organization of American States on 17 December 2005. He was installed in early 2006. He toured the damage left by Hurricane Katrina during the summer of 2006, shortly after his appointment. During Pope Benedict's April 2008 visit to the U.S., Sambi accompanied the Pope and hosted him at the apostolic nunciature, where the Pope held a historic private meeting with five victims of clergy sexual abuse. As nuncio, beginning in 2007, he was tasked with and had little success in enforcing restrictions that Pope Benedict XVI placed on Cardinal Theodore McCarrick, Archbishop emeritus of Washington, because of reports of inappropriate sexual behavior. Sambi received an honorary doctorate from Regis University in Denver, Colorado, on 8 May 2011. He was the 2009 Living Stones Solidarity Award of the Holy Land Christian Ecumenical Foundation for his work in the Middle East. On 22 July 2011, Sambi underwent lung surgery and developed complications that required the use of assisted ventilation. On 27 July, he died Johns Hopkins Medical Center in Baltimore, apparently from complications relating to that surgery.

He was born in Albany, New York, the son of Theodore Sedgwick II (1780‚Äì1839) and Susan Anne Ridley Sedgwick (1788‚Äì1867). He was a grandson of Theodore Sedgwick (1746‚Äì1813). He graduated from Columbia College in 1829. He then studied law and was admitted to the bar in May, 1833. Sedgwick spent 15 months in Europe, primarily a member of Edward Livingston's legation when Livingston served as U.S. Minister to France. On his return home in May 1835, he joined his uncle Robert Sedgwick's law practice in New York. He took over the practice when Robert was debilitated by a stroke in 1838, and remained active until 1850. Ill health forced Sedgwick to retire in 1850. He spent the next several years travelling in Europe, including visits to Italy, Switzerland, France, and England. In 1852, he became president of the Crystal Palace Association, organizing the construction of the building for the New York World's Fair. In 1857, Sedgwick declined President James Buchanan's offers to become Minister to the Netherlands and assistant secretary of state. In 1858, he became United States Attorney for the Southern District of New York. Sedgwick died in Stockbridge on December 9, 1859. He was buried at Stockbridge Cemetery.

The software combines several fields of application and therefore is also referred to as a multi talented image editor. One can not only find the standard image editing functions (draw with pen, remove red eye, add text, etc.) but also extended functions such as displaying anaglyph images, morphing and an integrated webcam support. An anaglyph image can be constructed by shooting two slightly displaced pictures with a digital camera. An illusion of a three- dimensional picture is created by using the software and a pair of 3D glasses. Objects seem to emerge from the computer monitor. The morphing function can transform photos from one person to another. To do so, the persons must be photographed in similar postures and their shapes need to be cut out with the help of the software. After doing so, points of support are set on noticeable spots (eyes, nose, mouth, etc.). Finally, the software calculates the intermediate images and creates a video of the transformation. PicMaster supports multiple possibilities for capturing images from a camera. The image can be placed into the Internet by uploading them on a server with the FTP protocol. Alternatively, the software can turn the computer into a web server using the HTTP protocol. The system can also be run as an alarm system which sends an E-mail containing the image as soon as a movement is detected. The software already includes 300 filter effects which can be described by using mathematical formulas. The integrated formula editor and parser allows a quick creation of image effects (e.g. r=r+20 increases the red portion of the image). Photoshop Plugins can be included as well. More Plugins are available in the Internet. A large image containing many small images (frames) can be created with the mosaic function. From a set of frames, the software can choose the one that fits best the spot in the large image. When viewed from a distance, the frames convert to the large image. The software offers several helpful functions for scanning pictures. Multiple pictures can be put on a scanner and by pressing a button they will be automatically: * separated into frames * straightened * removed from the background border * saved without any dialog (scan & save) * photocopied (scan & print) All working steps can be recorded in a macro and replayed later in order to reduce the amount of work. The actions are saved in a simple text file that can be run on multiple pictures at a later time. This makes it possible to shrink all pictures in a folder without the need to process each one individually.

It was founded as a mail-order business in 1965, when it started selling items, such as dental clamps and other specialty tools. Its first physical location opened in 1973 in Peterborough, New Hampshire. The company's headquarters are currently located in Merrimack, New Hampshire. Brookstone now sells a wide assortment of products, including remote control helicopters and drones, alarm clocks and smartwatches, massage chairs, speakers, iPads and tablet accessories, blankets, pillows, and many other lifestyle items. Most of the products sold at Brookstone stores are designed by the company and sold under its own brand (white brand). Brookstone stores are generally found in airports and also operates an online webstore. The company is distinctive in that it allows customers to play with any product in the store before making a purchase. On April 3, 2014, the company filed for bankruptcy under Chapter 11 of the Bankruptcy Code in the United States Bankruptcy Court for the District of Delaware; in its first-day motions on April 4, the company sought permission to be acquired by the parent of Spencer Gifts. The company's stores were to remain open and running as usual during the bankruptcy process. In June 2014, Brookstone was purchased by the Chinese investment firm, Sailing Capital, and Chinese conglomerate, Sanpower, for more than $173 million. The company emerged from bankruptcy in July 2014. On August 2, 2018, Brookstone announced the closing of all their mall locations to focus on their website and airport locations, days after the company was considering filing for bankruptcy. On August 6, 2018, Brookstone filed for Chapter 11 Bankruptcy and announced the closure of all 101 U.S. store locations.  History = Founding  Pierre de Beaumont and his wife, Mary, began Brookstone in 1965, for $500. After learning accounting by correspondence, they began mailing catalogs to thousands of hobbyists. It was based in their Berkshires farmhouse, and they named the company after their farm. Pierre de Beaumont was known as a tinkerer, and Brookstone's start and initial product base was driven around the purpose of making hard-to-find and useful items/tools. Brookstone started out as a catalog company, with local and long-distance catalog circulations that initially were introduced from a classified ad in a Popular Mechanics magazine in 1965. The demand for the unique products that Brookstone offered developed into a strong consumer, demand-based system that led to a need for specific Brookstone retail stores.  1970s and 80s  Brookstone opened its first store in 1973 in New Hampshire. Due to the growing success of this store, many more followed during the next decade; however the customer-base for Brookstone stores were almost exclusively limited to those who received their distributed catalogs. In March 1980, the Quaker Oats Company bought Brookstone with a $9 million stock exchange. Brookstone fixed their customer base issue in the 1980s by introducing products in their stores that were not available in their catalogs; however, they still focused on unique tools and household goods. New items included products focused on travel, leisure, technology, audio, and games, and even developed a hands-on experience for almost all of their products. Due to the introduction of these new products, more customers developed an interest and sales gradually increased through the 1980s. Looking to reduce debt, Quaker announced in August 1986 they would sell off their specialty retailing group, which included Brookstone as well as Jos. A. Bank Clothiers and Eyelab. Brookstone was purchased by an investment group including Greylock Management, Duncan, Cook and Co. and Fidelity Ventures, as well as Brookstone management. In 1987, sales were posted at $93 million, which Brookstone considered a record. Their income, though, was at a loss of $9.7 million, and this situation continued through the late 1980s. Even though sales were increasing, Brookstone decided to focus on ideas of creating products catered towards women, and converting their stores' overall look driven towards a \\"men's clubhouse\\" feeling. Store arrangements were also changed to provide a less crowded, and more comfortable atmosphere. These efforts proved to be successful as an annual positive income was made at $4.9 million, with sales at $104.6 million in the early '90s. Even with this success, Brookstone wanted more improvements, and decided to sack its computer programming staff that worked on their retail computer system. With needs in the retail scene changing, their initial, already developed retail software systems became useful, which ended up making Brookstone's remaining staffed programmers unnecessary, which developed into strong annual savings for Brookstone.  1990s  In 1992, Brookstone opened kiosks that offered Brookstone items, but contained a limited selection of items. The kiosks were separated from the Brookstone stores, but were contained in the same mall. These kiosks also proved to be a successful business venture with an overall sales jump to $143.7 million. By 1993, Brookstone operated around 100 stores in the US. Sales in these stores accounted for 85 percent of their annual revenue, with their still existing magazine, and kiosk sales contributing to the remaining 15 percent. At this time, Brookstone only had two distribution centers, and decided to add a brand-new one in 1994 in Missouri, which resulted in faster shipments of their products to customers at no cost. By the late 1990s, Brookestone had 150 stores in 32 states, more than 100 kiosks, and an online retail store. Brookstone evolved into a multimillion-dollar company while retaining a strong grip on their original theme of offering unique and interesting products. Over the course of the 1990s, Brookstone moved away from selling tools and similar items, and began to focus more on electronics.  21st century  In the mid-2000s, Brookstone stores were redesigned with tile floors and track lighting. In January 2014, Brookstone missed an interest payment to bondholders on their debt of $125 million from the original Osim/Childs/Temasek buyout. As a result, Brookstone began to consult with firms including Hilco Global and Tiger Capital Group LLC about buying or investing in the company. On March 26, 2014, it was reported that the mall retailer Spencer Spirit Holdings, the parent of Spencer Gifts, would look to acquire Brookstone out of Bankruptcy for $120 million. On April 3, 2014, Brookstone filed for bankruptcy as expected. In June 2014, Brookstone was purchased by the Chinese investment firm Sailing Capital and Chinese conglomerate Sanpower for more than $173 million. The company emerged from Bankruptcy in July 2014. In August 2018, Brookstone filed for its second bankruptcy in 4 years, subsequently announcing the closure of all storefronts in shopping malls. Airport stores and their website will stay.  Competition  Brookstone is in competition with The Sharper Image, a similar company that filed for bankruptcy in 2008, but continues to run its online storefront and catalog. Another competitor was Hammacher Schlemmer, which began as a New York hardware store with a catalog.  Controversy = Employment  In November 2009, Brookstone received media coverage over the firing of Massachusetts man Peter Vadala. Vadala allegedly disagreed with a co-worker's homosexuality in a Boston store, after she made references to her same-sex fiancee, seeking Vadala's congratulations. Brookstone asserts it has a zero-tolerance policy on discriminatory harassment. Vadala asserted that Christians are \\"obviously\\" excluded from that discriminatory harassment policy in a Fox & Friends interview.  Frog-O- Sphere  The treatment of animals in Brookstone's Frog-O-Sphere, an aquarium-like self-cleaning tank which contains two African dwarf frogs, has caused an animal rights controversy. In November 2009, PETA released an undercover video investigation allegedly depicting inhumane treatment of frogs prior to their use in Frog-O-Spheres at their supplier, Wild Creations. PETA alleges that frogs are raised in unfiltered water, infrequently fed, and suffering from fungal infections. Brookstone has denied these charges.

The OT has also been shown to play a role in locomotor and attentional behaviors, particularly in relation to social and sensory responsiveness, and it may be necessary for behavioral flexibility. The OT is interconnected with numerous brain regions, especially the sensory, arousal, and reward centers, thus making it a potentially critical interface between processing of sensory information and the subsequent behavioral responses. The OT is a composite structure that receives direct input from the olfactory bulb and contains the morphological and histochemical characteristics of the ventral pallidum and the striatum of the forebrain. The dopaminergic neurons of the mesolimbic pathway project onto the GABAergic medium spiny neurons of the nucleus accumbens and olfactory tubercle Figure 3: The ventral striatum and self-administration of amphetamine (receptor D3 is abundant in these two areas ). In addition, the OT contains tightly packed cell clusters known as the islands of Calleja, which consist of granule cells. Even though it is part of the olfactory cortex and receives direct input from the olfactory bulb, it has not been shown to play a role in processing of odors. Structure The olfactory tubercle differs in location and relative size between humans, non-human primates, rodents, birds, and other animals. In most cases, the olfactory tubercle is identified as a round bulge along the basal forebrain anterior to the optic chiasm and posterior to the olfactory peduncle. In humans and non-human primates, visual identification of the olfactory tubercle is not easy because the basal forebrain bulge is small in these animals. With regard to functional anatomy, the olfactory tubercle can be considered to be a part of three larger networks. First, it is considered to be part of the basal forebrain, the nucleus accumbens, and the amygdaloid nuclei because of its location along the rostral ventral region of the brain, that is, the front-bottom part. Second, it is considered to be part of the olfactory cortex because it receives direct input from the olfactory bulb. Third, it is also considered to be part of the ventral striatum based on anatomy, neurochemical, and embryology data. One of the most striking features of the olfactory tubercle is the closely packed crescent-shape cell clusters, which are located mostly in layer III and sometimes in layer II. These cells clusters, called the islands of calleja, are innervated by dopaminergic projections from the nucleus accumbens and the substantia nigra, suggesting the role that the olfactory tubercle plays in the reward system. The olfactory tubercle is a multi-sensory processing center due to the number of innervations going to and from other brain regions such as the amygdala, thalamus, hypothalamus, hippocampus, brain stem, auditory and visual sensory fibers, and a number of structures in the reward‚Äìarousal system, as well as the olfactory cortex. Due to its many innervations from other brain regions, the olfactory tubercle is involved in merging information across the senses, such as olfactory‚Äîaudition and olfactory‚Äîvisual integrations, possibly in a behaviorally relevant manner. Thus, damage to the olfactory tubercle is likely to affect the functionality of all these areas of the brain. Examples of such disruption include changes in normal odor-guided behavior, and impairments in modulating state and motivational behavior, which are common in psychiatric disorders such as schizophrenia, dementia and depression. The olfactory tubercle has been shown to play a large role in behavior. Unilateral lesions in the olfactory tubercle have been shown to alter attention, social and sensory responsiveness, and even locomotor behavior. Bilateral lesions have been shown to reduce copulatory behavior in male rats. The olfactory tubercle has also been shown to be especially involved in reward and addictive behaviors. Rats have been shown to administer cocaine into the olfactory tubercle more than the nucleus accumbens and ventral pallidum, other reward centers in the brain. In fact, they will administer cocaine into the olfactory tubercle at about 200 times per hour and even till death. Functional contributions of the olfactory tubercle to olfaction are currently unclear; however, there is evidence of a perceptual role that it may play. Work from Zelano, et al. suggest that the olfactory tubercle may be crucial in sorting out the sources of olfactory information. This suggests that it may also play a role in odor guided behavior. Thus, it may link perception of odor with action through its connections with attention, reward, and motivation systems of the basal forebrain. Functional imaging data from this same group also shows that the olfactory tubercle is highly activated during tasks that engage attention, thus playing a large role in arousal-related systems. Because the olfactory tubercle is a component of the ventral striatum, it is heavily interconnected with several affective-, reward-, and motivation-related centers of the brain. It also sits at the interface between the olfactory sensory input and state-dependent behavioral modulatory circuits, that is the area that modulates behavior during certain physiological and mental states. Thus, the olfactory tubercle may also play an important role in the mediation of odor approach and odor avoidance behavior, probably in a state-dependent manner.  Anatomy  In general, the olfactory tubercle is located at the basal forebrain of the animal within the medial temporal lobe. Specifically, parts of the tubercle are included in the olfactory cortex and nested between the optic chiasm and olfactory tract and ventral to the nucleus accumbens. The olfactory tubercle consists of three layers, a molecular layer (layer I), the dense cell layer (layer II), and the multiform layer (layer III). Other than the islands of Calleja, which are characteristic of the tubercle, it is also noted for the being innervated by dopaminergic neurons from the ventral tegmental area. The olfactory tubercle also consists of heterogeneous elements, such as medial forebrain bundle, and has a ventral extension of the striatal complex. During the 1970s, the tubercle was found to contain a striatal component which is composed of GABAergic medium spiny neurons. The GABAergic neurons project to the ventral pallidum and receive glutamatergic inputs from cortical regions and dopaminergic inputs from the ventral tegmental area.  Morphological and neurochemical features  The ventral portion of the olfactory tubercle consists of three layers, whereas the dorsal portion contains dense cell clusters and adjoins the ventral pallidum (within the basal ganglia). The structure of the most ventral and anterior parts of the tubercle can be defined as anatomically defined hills (consisting of gyri and sulci) and clusters of cells. The most common cell types in the olfactory tubercle are medium-size dense spine cells found predominantly in layer II (dense cell layer). The dendrites of these cells are covered by substance p immunoreactive (S.P.I) axons up into layer III (multiform layer). These cells also project into the nucleus accumbens and caudate putamen, thus linking the olfactory tubercle with the pallidum. Other medium-size cells reside in layers II and III of the olfactory tubercle as well. These include the spine-poor neurons and spindle cells and they differ from the medium-size dense spine cells because they have sparse dendritic trees. The largest cells, and most striking feature of the olfactory tubercle, are densely packed crescent-shape cell clusters, Islands of Calleja that reside mostly in the dorsal portion of the olfactory tubercle, layer III, and can also be found in layer II. The olfactory tubercle also contains three classes of small cells found mostly in layers I and II. The first are pial cells (named as such because of location near pial surface), which look like miniature medium-size dense spine cells. The second are radiate cells and are easily identified by numerous multi- directional spineless dendrites. The third, small spine cells, are similar to the pial cells in that they also look like medium-size spine cells except they are not located near the pial surface. Development Migrating cells from several developmental sites come together to form the olfactory tubercle. This includes the ventral ganglionic eminence (found in ventral part of telencephalon, where they form bulges in the ventricles that later become the basal ganglia, present only in embryonic stages) and the rostromedial telencephalic wall (of the forebrain). Olfactory tubercle neurons originate as early as embryonic day 13 (E13), and the cell development occurs in a layer specific manner. The emergence of the three main layers of the olfactory tubercle begins almost simultaneously. The large neurons in layer III originate from E13 to E16, while the small and medium originate between E15 and E20. Like the small and medium cells in layer III, the cells of layer II and the striatal bridges also originate between E15 and E20 and develop in a lateral to medial gradient. The granule cells of the islands of calleja originate between E19 and E22 and continue to migrate into the islands until long after birth. Fibers from the lateral olfactory tract begin branching into the olfactory tubercle around E17. The lateral portion of the olfactory tubercle (which adjoins the olfactory tract) receives the densest fiber input and the medial portion receives light fiber projections. This branching continues until completion about the end of the first week after birth. Function= Multi-sensory processes  The olfactory tubercle plays a functional role in the multisensory integration of olfactory information with extra modal senses. Auditory sensory information may arrive at the olfactory tubercle via networks involving the hippocampus and ventral pallidum or directly from the olfactory cortex, thus showing a possible role of the olfactory tubercle in olfactory auditory sensory integration. This convergence has been shown to cause the perception of sound, caused by the interaction between smell and sound. This possibility has been supported by work from where olfactory tubercle displayed olfactory‚Äìauditory convergence. Retinal projections have also been found in layer II of the olfactory tubercle, suggesting that it constitutes a region of olfactory and visual convergence. These visual sensory fibers arrive from the retinal ganglion cells. Thus, the olfactory tubercle may play a role in the perception of odors when a visual source is identified. As far as olfaction is concerned, in vitro data from some studies suggest that the olfactory tubercle units have the functional capability of other olfactory center neurons in processing odor. It has been suggested that the olfactory tubercle may be crucial in determining the source of olfactory information and responds to odor inhalations that are attended to.  Role in behavior  The olfactory tubercle has been shown to be concerned primarily with the reception of sensory impulses from olfactory receptors. Because of its connections to regions like the amygdala and hippocampus, the olfactory tubercle may play a role in behavior. Rats rely heavily on olfactory sensory input from olfactory receptors for behavioral attitudes. Studies show that bilateral lesions in the olfactory tubercle significantly reduce stereotyped behavior such as copulatory behavior in male rats and a reduction in sniffing and chewing behaviors. These stereotyped inhibitions may have been caused by the removal of central neuronal processes other than the dopaminergic cells in the olfactory tubercle. Unilateral lesions have been shown to alter attention, social and sensory responsiveness, and even locomotor behavior in rats.  Arousal and reward  The dopaminergic neurons from the ventral tegmental area that innervate the olfactory tubercle enable the tubercle to play roles in reward and arousal and appears to partially mediate cocaine reinforcement. The anteromedial portions of the tubercle have been shown to mediate some of the rewarding effects of drugs like cocaine and amphetamine. This has been shown in studies where rats learn to self-administer cocaine at significantly high rates into the tubercle. Injections of cocaine into the tubercle induce robust locomotion and rearing behavior in rats. Clinical significance The multi-sensory nature of the olfactory tubercle and the many innervations it receives from other brain regions, especially the direct input from the olfactory bulb and innervations from the ventral tegmental area, makes it likely to be involved in several psychiatric disorders in which olfaction and dopamine receptors are affected. Many studies have found reduced olfactory sensitivity in patients with major depressive disorders (MDD) and dementia and schizophrenia. Patients with MDD have been shown to have reduced olfactory bulb and olfactory cortex as compared to normal people. In dementias, especially of the Alzheimer's disease type, the olfactory bulb, anterior olfactory nucleus, and orbitofrontal cortex, all areas of the brain that process olfaction are affected. The deficits observed in dementia include decrease in odor threshold sensitivity, odor identification and odor memory. Patients with schizophrenia exhibit deficits in olfactory discrimination that are not seen in patients with other psychiatric disorders not mentioned here. Rupp, et al. found that in patients with schizophrenia olfactory sensitivity and discrimination as well as higher order identification abilities are reduced. As mentioned earlier, the olfactory tubercle may be involved in the perception of odors due to the inputs received from the bulb and thus, by extension, may play a role in these psychiatric disorders.  History  The olfactory tubercle was first described by Albert von K√∂lliker in 1896, who studied them in rats. Since then, there have been several histological and histochemical studies; done in this area to identify it in other rodents, cats, humans, non-human primates, and other species. Similar studies were done by several authors to find the cell composition and innervations to and from other regions in the OT. Over the years, several other methods have been employed to find the possible functions and role of the OT in the brain. These began with lesion studies and early electrophysiological recordings. Improvements in technology have made it possible to now place multiple electrodes in the olfactory tubercle and record from anesthetized and even awake animals participating in behavioral tasks.

He trained through propeller-driven aircraft up into the Grumman F9F Cougar and F-11 Tiger carrier-based fighters. In 1963, when faced with the choice of either transitioning into the F-4 Phantom or taking an aerial application job back at home, he chose to be with his family, and started flying agricultural operations in fixed wing aircraft and rotorcraft. Handley began flying aerobatics after taking ownership of a Pitts S-1C in the early 1980s, and entered his first International Aerobatic Club contest in 1983.Wayne Handley - Avweb In 2015, with over 27,000 hours of flight time logged, Handley is a highly respected, record-setting aviator who received the California Agricultural Aircraft Association's Outstanding Airman Award in 1985; the International Aerobatic Club named him the California Unlimited Aerobatic Champion also in 1985, the Bill Barber Award for Showmanship in 1996, the Art Scholl Memorial Showmanship Award in 1997, the Crystal Eagle Award in 2000, and the International Council of Airshows Sword of Excellence in 2001, and induction into the International Council of Airshows Airshow Hall of Fame. In 1989, he set the world records for inverted flat spins, with 67 consecutive revolutions. In April 1999, he beat his own record, with 78 rotations flying a Giles G-202. In 1999, he also set multiple time-to-climb records in his Turbo Raven. On the airshow circuit, he initially flew a Pitts Special biplane in an act that he called Agrobatics in which he merged some of the techniques that an agricultural pilot might employ while applying chemicals to crops with his own graceful style of aerobatic flying. He would fly under a ribbon stretched between two poles which simulated power lines; afterwards he performed an inverted cut of that ribbon using his propeller. After a few years in the Pitts, he started work on a one-of-a-kind aircraft which would be known as the Raven. Raven Climbout The Raven is a composite monoplane with a unique paint scheme that paid tribute to the bird species Corvus corax, which has been observed performing aerobatics apparently for fun. Registered as a Kraska Rebel 2300 homebuilt aircraft (N711WH),FAA N-number N711WH Handley modified the design with a wing designed for the Zivko Edge 540, and many other custom details such that the Raven was a one-of-a- kind aircraft of Handley's design. The Raven was capable of +/-16G, over 380 degrees per second roll rate, a per minute rate of climb, stunning tumbles, torque rolls, tailslides, and any other maneuver Handley could create. This aircraft performed for airshow crowds for over a decade up until August 2005, when it was retired to the Evergreen Aviation Museum. In 1998, with sponsorship by Oracle, he set out to create the Oracle Turbo Raven, which was the world's only aerobatic aircraft with a thrust-to-weight ratio higher than one (more thrust than weight). He teamed up with Richard Giles of AkroTech Aviation, and AgAir Systems, and the Oracle Turbo Raven was built and registered as a Giles G-750 (N17HE).FAA N-number N17HE The composite airframe was based on the Giles G-202 design, with an empty weight of 1,600 pounds (725 kg). It was fitted with a Pratt & Whitney PT6A-25C turboprop that generated 2,800 pounds (12,500 N) of thrust, which gave the aircraft a power loading of less than 2.7 lb/hp at ready-to-fly weights. With this power loading, the Oracle Turbo Raven could fly straight up, hover in mid-air, back up, stop, and then accelerate straight up out of the hover. The aircraft also had enough power that it could recover from flat spins simply by flying out of them with the nose still on the horizon. The aircraft had a maximum speed of and a roll rate of 450 degrees per second. On January 20, 1999, Handley once again got into the record books by flying the Turbo Raven from brake release to 3,000 meters in one minute and nine seconds. In July 1999 at EAA AirVenture Oshkosh, the Turbo Raven took three minutes, six seconds to get to 6,000 meters, and established the Turbo Raven as the fastest-climbing propeller-driven aircraft in the world. This aircraft was also able to reverse the pitch of its propeller blades in flight, and could actually slow down while diving towards the ground; Handley used this ability to make very steep approaches to land, as well as for unique maneuvers where he could slow below stall speed while diving. On October 3, 1999, exactly one year to the day after its debut, the Turbo Raven was destroyed after the engine failed to deliver power during one such approach at the California International Airshow at Salinas Municipal Airport, and Handley was unable to accelerate above stall speed with the propeller in reverse pitch. He was seriously injured, but made a full recovery, and was flying within a month after the accident. Handley continues to train, coach, and evaluate aerobatic students and airshow pilots from the ground and in flight as well as presenting safety seminars on spins and unusual attitudes.Wayne Handley Aerosports Inc NotesExternal links *International Council of Airshows *Extra Aircraft *Turbo Raven video from Moffett Field Airshow *Turbo Raven Vertical take-off video *Turbo Raven Crash video from Salinas Airshow Category:1939 births Category:Aerobatic pilots Category:Aviators from California Category:Living people Category:People from Carmel Valley Village, California Category:American aviation record holders ","title":"Wayne Handley"},{"id":"4126326","text":"This is a list of broadcast television stations serving cities in the Commonwealth of Puerto Rico.

Like the other Canadian chartered banks, it issued its own paper money. The bank issued notes 1872-1922. The end dates are the final dates appearing on notes, which may have circulated for some time after. Beginnings The bank had a rough start, including near bankruptcy during the summer of 1879 when six banks in the area had to suspend activities due to financial difficulties. On August 1, 1879, the bank would run into further difficulties when its headquarters burned down; however, the bank would go on to thrive. On July 29, 1896 the Bank of Hamilton's first Winnipeg branch opened. By December 1898, six more branches were opened in Manitoba. This marked the beginning of two decades of explosive growth in the West. In total, between 1898 and 1910, the Bank of Hamilton would go on to open 128 branches throughout Ontario and Western Canada. By 1928, this number had grown to 152 branches. Like the other Canadian chartered banks, it issued its own paper money. The Bank of Canada was established through the Bank of Canada Act of 1934 and the banks relinquished their right to issue their own currency. Expansion By 1905 the bank was doing so well that it decided to expand its head office, adding on an additional 8 stories. This is significant because the bank headquarters became Hamilton's first skyscraper on the corner of King and James Street. This tall building attracted the attention of Harry H. Gardiner of Washington, known as the Human Fly. He climbed the Bank of Hamilton building on November 11, 1918, to celebrate the end of World War I. Architecture The Bank of Hamilton in Winnipeg, Manitoba, built 1916 to 1918 is on the Registry of Historical Places of Canada.http://www.historicplaces.ca/visit-visite/affichage- display.aspx?id=7345 Bank of Hamilton Merger The Bank of Hamilton merged with Canadian Bank of Commerce (later to become the Canadian Imperial Bank of Commerce, or CIBC) on January 2, 1924. It was one of the last surviving banks in Canada that was not headquartered in Toronto or Montreal. Thirty-five members of the Bank of Hamilton from branches across Canada died as a result of their World War I service. Their names were listed on a bronze memorial plaque which is currently displayed at the former Bank of Montreal (1928) building in Hamilton, Ontario.

The 75-year-old company operated traveling carnivals at various summer agricultural shows across North America and is based in Brantford, Ontario and formerly also in West Palm Beach, Florida. The company has a long history in Canada, providing entertainment for generations of kids and adults. The organization used to operate the midway services for some of Canada's largest summer fairs including the Canadian National Exhibition in Toronto, the Calgary Stampede, and Edmonton's K-Days. In 2004, Conklin Shows International route and equipment were sold to North American Midway Entertainment. Two of the remaining companies, World's Finest Shows and Conklin Super Shows, still are part of the Conklin Group of Carnival Companies. World's Finest Shows route includes more than 60 fairs, all in Ontario, Canada. They are both based in Ontario, Canada. Conklin Shows, as it was known in Canada and the US, now operates under North American Midway Entertainment (NAME). The carnival provides the midway at fairs and exhibitions, including, Miami, Florida's Miami-Dade County Fair, Edmonton, Alberta's K-Days Calgary, Alberta's Calgary Stampede and Toronto, Ontario's CNE, The Canadian National Exhibition. History Conklin Shows was founded by James Wesley \\"Patty\\" Conklin, who was born Joseph Renker in 1892 in Brooklyn, New York, and died in 1970. \\"End of an Era\\", ConklinShows.com. Retrieved 27 November 2019 He was brought up by foster parents. By 1906 he had begun selling peanuts without a permit at Madison Square Gardens whenever a circus was in town, and newspapers on the streets of New York, before becoming a sideshow host at Coney Island. When he was 21 his father dropped dead and ended up landing $3300 CAD ($54,000 2020). By 1915 he was running his own gambling games at various midways across the southern United States. After meeting James Wesley Conklin (1861-1920) around 1916, he adopted his surname, Conklin, as his own. In 1916 Patty and J. W. Conklin established Clark & Conklin Shows. Lasting four seasons playing at various shows around the mid west, the company folded after the death of the father. In 1921 Patty moved the show north to play at the Winnipeg Exhibition. Due to a problem with the fair, their participation was canceled. While returning to the United States with a train car full of prize merchandise, Patty stumbled upon a show just outside Winnipeg. They joined up with the operator of the fair, International Amusement Company and worked all of the remaining Canadian shows that year. The War Years After working the road hosting small fairs coast to coast for 20 years, Conklin Shows bid on and won the midway contract for the 1937 Toronto Canadian National Exhibition. The fair, one of the largest in the world, was a prized show. By 1941 the company played at 98% of all the major fairs across Canada. To accommodate travel to the various shows they ran a 45-car specialized train cars. Specialized boxcars painted bright orange 80' long were fitted with custom doors to accommodate speedy loading and unloading of gear. The train carried 15 feature attractions & 21 rides and 700 people including performers and crews. Patty Conklin himself traveled in style with his $65,000 CAD ($1 million 2020) Mexican stylized 5-room 'mansion on wheels' private car. Having the CNE contract helped turn it into a profitable company in the early 1950s Conklin Shows borrowed over half a million dollars and began to build permanent attractions on the CNE fairgrounds of Exhibition Place. In 1953 they constructed the Mighty Flyer, a wooden rollercoaster, that lasted until the early 1990s. The early 1970s saw the company begin to diversify, including establishing Maple Leaf Village (now Casino Niagara) in Niagara Falls Ontario along with running a venue at the base of the CN Tower in Toronto. In 1975 Conklin Shows' biggest rival, Royal American Shows, declined to return to fair dates in Canada due to later disproved charges of tax evasion, charges that several Canadian carnivals aided and encouraged. In 1976 Conklin was awarded the contracts previously held by RAS - including the Calgary Stampede and Vancouver Pacific Exhibition, largely due to Conklin being a Canadian business. The 80s and 90s were a time of growth for Conklin as it operated across the prairies with stops in Winnipeg, Edmonton, Calgary, Regina and Saskatoon. It also opened up a number of smaller fairs as well as provided a schedule and route for many smaller independent shows such as Lauther Amusements and Billy Truax Amusements. These companies, although bound by contracts to the larger Conklin Shows, operated as separate shows. Conklin also became known for its very large and quite unique collection of rides, many of which were large, European built rides rarely seen in North America, and some never even traveled north of the border. One of the most of famous attractions in Conklin's line up was the \\"Doppel Looping\\", North America's first and only traveling double loop roller coaster which was imported in from Germany in the mid 80s. This mammoth coaster, which took 28 trailers to move, only made the trip as far north as Toronto, as even this was not financially feasible after the late 90s. The coaster was eventually sold off in 2008. Some of the other Conklin rides that were one of a kind in an American traveling carnival included the \\"Drop of Fear\\" and the \\"G-Force\\". As time progressed, Conklin began to show signs of financial strain that was synonymous with the entire traveling carnival industry. Favorites such as the Zipper and the Octopus, as well as The Kamikaze and The Rainbow were phased out and sold as cost-cutting measures. Independents that had long traveled as a part of Conklin Shows were also phased out. Finally other rides such as the Drop of Fear, G-Force, Enterprise, Gravitron, Starship 2000, Flying Bobs, Aladin, Break Dance, Crazy Flip, Hi-Roller, Rotor, Devastator, Swiss Bob, Hully Gully, Tip Top, Flic Flac, Tango, Evolution, Spin Out, 1001 Nacht, Chaos, Inverter, Flipper, Touchdown, Cobra, Scorpion, Double Sky Wheels, Paratrooper, Hurricane and the Mark 1 & Wildcat roller coaster were sold to competing companies and shelved in West Palm Beach. Finally, Conklin Shows joined with the former Farrow Shows from Jackson, Mississippi, Thebault-Blomsness (Astro Amusements and All Star Amusements), and former president and CEO of Ticketmaster Group, Frederic Rosen, to form the newly minted North American Midway Entertainment Co. or N.A.M.E. N.A.M.E. Website. This became official in Columbia South Carolina in 2004. In January 2006, N.A.M.E. also acquired Mid America Shows Press Release, and several contracts and rides from Cumberland Valley Shows. N.A.M.E. provides rides at over 145 fairs and events yearly. Now included are Cinco de Mayo in New Orleans as well as the Dade Co. Fair, The Illinois State Fair, the Kentucky State Fair, the Indiana State Fair, and the Big E Eastern States Exposition. New and more expensive rides have been added to its line-up but at the cost of many of the old favorites. Frank Conklin, while owning part of N.A.M.E., has left the management of the combined company to others. In 1984, Jim Conklin donated many antique midway rides from his collection to Calgary's Heritage Park historical village. These restored rides now make up the majority of the rides at Heritage Park's Conklin Lakeview Amusement Park. https://www.heritagepark.ca/park-information/attractions-and-exhibits/conklin- lakeview-amusement-park.html Current operations The Conklin Midway at Toronto's Canadian National Exhibition.

(Chung Chien) Young, was a Chinese paleontologist and zoologist. He was one of China's foremost vertebrate paleontologists. He has been called the \\"Father of Chinese Vertebrate Paleontology\\". Biography Yang (center) at the Lantian Man site in 1965 Yang was born in Hua County, Shaanxi, China. He graduated from the Department of Geology of Peking University in 1923, and in 1927 received his doctorate from the University of Munich in Germany. In 1928 he worked for the Cenozoic Research Laboratory of the Geological Survey of China and took charge of excavations at the Peking Man Site at Zhoukoudian. He held professorial posts at the Geological Survey of China, Peking University, and Northwest University in Xi'an. Yang's scientific work was instrumental in the creation of China's Institute of Vertebrate Paleontology and Paleoanthropology in Beijing, which today houses one of the most important collections of fossil vertebrates in the world. He was director of both the IVPP and the Beijing Natural History Museum. He supervised the collection of fossil remains of and research on dinosaurs in China from 1933 until the 1970s. He presided over some of the most important fossil discoveries in history, such as those of the prosauropods, Lufengosaurus and Yunnanosaurus; the ornithopod, Tsintaosaurus; and the gigantic sauropod, Mamenchisaurus; as well as China's first stegosaur, Chialingosaurus. Legacy Yang's cremated remains are interred behind the museum at the Zhoukoudian site alongside those of his colleagues, Pei Wenzhong and Jia Lanpo. In 2007, when L√º Junchang and colleagues described a second species of Yunnanosaurus, they named it Yunnanosaurus youngi in Yang's honour.Lu, J., Li, T., Zhong, S., Azuma, Y., Fujita, M., Dong, Z., and Ji, Q.

Career Gl√≥ria was born in Rio de Janeiro, Brazil, but had his greatest successes with Benfica in Portugal, guiding the club to nine national trophies. With the Nigeria national team he won the 1980 African Cup of Nations. In his first period with Benfica, the club was transformed to professional standards. Supported by president Joaquim Ferreira Bogalho, Gl√≥ria founded a home for the players and focused on recruiting players from the periphery of the Portuguese capital and also from the African overseas provinces. In these years between 1954 and 1959 the club won two leagues and three Portuguese Cup. In February 1962 he took on the reins of Olympique Marseille. The club was then stuck in the second division and saw its aspirations to return to the first division endangered. In his four months with the club he did not lose a single match and achieved its objective. In his second tenure with Benfica he had continuous success on the national level, winning two more championships and cups. He also led the club into the 1968 final of the European Cup of Champions in London against Manchester United, which was lost 1‚Äì4. At the 1966 FIFA World Cup in England he led the Portugal national team, with Eus√©bio, who became the tournament's top scorer, to the third place. In the process Portugal inflicted a 1‚Äì3 defeat on Gl√≥ria's home country Brazil. The official head coach of the Portuguese team was then Manuel da Luz Afonso. In 1979, he became with CR Vasco da Gama of Rio de Janeiro runner-up in the Brazilian championship, losing in the final 1‚Äì2 against SC Internacional Porto Alegre, which remained undefeated throughout the competition. In the year thereafter he guided Nigeria through the 1980 African Nations Cup, which the team won in the final in Lagos with 3‚Äì0 against Algeria, and the Olympic Football Tournament 1980 in Moscow. He left this position after poor performances at the 1982 campaign in Libya. Gl√≥ria coached Portugal, in 1982, in qualifying matches for UEFA Euro 1984, but resigned after a 0‚Äì4 defeat in a friendly match with Brazil, the following year.

Meeting Space enables application sharing, collaborative editing, desktop sharing, file sharing, projecting, and simple text-based or ink-based instant messaging across up to 10 users connected to the same network or across the Internet. Meeting Space has the ability to automatically set up an ad hoc wireless network if a connection to a network or the Internet are not available and also enables participants to invite other people to meeting sessions. It is one of the first applications for the new peer-to-peer infrastructure in Windows Vista and hence requires IPv6. Meeting Space is available in all editions of Windows Vista, but its functionality is unavailable in the Starter edition; in the Home Basic edition, it only allows users to join sessions. Meeting Space does not exist in any edition of Windows 7, for which Microsoft recommended Microsoft Office Live Meeting as a replacement. History Meeting Space is a result of Microsoft's peer-to-peer collaboration efforts‚Äîwith an emphasis on mobile computing‚Äîdiscussed during the Windows Hardware Engineering Conference of 2004 when Windows Vista was codenamed \\"Longhorn.\\" At that time, it was reported that Windows Vista would enable users to create \\"ad hoc wireless networks for file sharing and to discover people who are connected nearby.\\" Meeting Space relies on this functionality for its services. Meeting Space was demonstrated by Jim Allchin and Darryn Dieken at the Professional Developers Conference (PDC) in 2005 where it projected a shared PowerPoint presentation. Allchin stated that this demonstration was not to illustrate functions of the application itself‚Äîdevelopment of which was not complete at the time‚Äîbut to illustrate select capabilities of the peer-to-peer framework in Windows Vista. In a later interview with Paul Thurrott, Allchin expressed desire for developers to create applications supporting peer-to-peer capabilities. Overview and features On starting a session, a workspace, which contains a presentation area, is displayed. A list of notes are also shown. A list of users in the local subnet, with whom a collaboration session can be started, are automatically detected by using the People Near Me functionality, based on WS- Discovery in the peer-to-peer networking implementation in Windows Vista. Users outside the local subnet must be sent an e-mail or file invitation to participate. Applications can be shared in the session, which will be local to that session only.

It lies in Lublin Voivodeship, in Lubart√≥w County. It is the capital of the administrative district Gmina Kock. Historically Kock belongs to the Polish province of Lesser Poland and is located in its northeastern corner. , its population numbered 3,509.  Name and location  Kock is located a few kilometers north of the Wieprz river, approximately 150 meters above sea level, near the ≈Åuk√≥w Lowland (R√≥wnina ≈Åukowska). In 1952-1954 it was the seat of Gmina Bia≈Çobrzegi. The town first appears in chronicles in 1258 as Cocsk. In the 15th century, it was called Kocsko or Koczsko, and in 1787, its name was spelled Kocko. Current form has been in use since the 19th century, and the word Kock either comes from the last name or a nickname Kot (a person named so founded the town), or from a plant called kocanka (Helichrysum arenarium), which grows abundantly in the area. History Kock has been recognized as an established community since the 12th century. It received its city charter in 1417, by King W≈Çadys≈Çaw II Jagie≈Ç≈Ço, who granted the charter upon request of Jakub, the Bishop of P≈Çock. In 1518 the town belonged to Mikolaj Firlej, Crown Hetman and the Voivode of Sandomierz. The Firlej family owned Kock until the second half of the 18th century, and at that time the town became an important center of the Protestant Reformation in Lesser Poland. Around the year 1750 Kock passed into the hands of Princess Anna Jab≈Çonowska of the Sapieha family, who invested a lot of money and energy into the town, ordering the construction of a town hall, a palace and a church. Furthermore, she established the market square (or rynek). The residents of the town participated in the January Uprising, for which the Russians deprived Kock of its town rights (1870, recovered in 1915). Several important battles took place at Kock in the 19th and early 20th centuries: * Battle of Kock (1809), May 5, 1809, during the Polish‚ÄìAustrian War, * 17‚Äì20 June 1831, and September 12, 1831 during the November Uprising, * December 25, 1863, during the January Uprising, * Battle of Kock (1920), August 14‚Äì16, 1920, during the Polish‚ÄìSoviet War, * Battle of Kock (1939), October 2‚Äì6, 1939, during the Polish September Campaign, * August 1944, during the Operation Tempest. After World War I, Kock belonged to Lublin Voivodeship. In 1927 large parts of it burned in a fire. The town, located away from rail connections, stagnated. During World War II, the Jewish half of the Kock population, about 2200 of the town's 4600 population, was murdered or died of disease and starvation in the ghetto set up by the Germans in Kock. Kock was one of centers of the Home Army, whose units (27th Volhynian Home Army Infantry Division) freed the town on July 22, 1944. Afterwards, the Soviets disbanded Polish soldiers, and in the resulting civil war, Kock was captured by anti-Communist resistance (May 1, 1945).  Points of interest  * Parish Church (1779‚Äì82), * The House of Jozef Morgensztern (see Menachem Mendel of Kotzk), * Jewish cemetery (18th century), * Military cemetery with the grave of General Franciszek Kleeberg, * Classicistic Palace of Princess Anna Jablonowska (1770).  Jews of Kock  In the 17th century, a Jewish community was established in the town. In Yiddish, the community is known as Kotzk or Kotsk. In the 19th century, it became an important centre of Hasidism as the longtime home of Rabbi Menachem Mendel of Kotzk, the Kotzker rebbe who established the Kotsk dynasty. During World War II, Jews were brutalized by the German occupiers. They along with deportees from other villages, were confined to a ghetto. Though the pre-war Kock Jewish community was only about 2200, by late 1939, the ghetto contained 8000 Jews. Sometimes several dozen people resided in a single room. The overcrowding and lack of adequate sanitation led to a typhus epidemic. In turn, local Christian villagers would not allow Jews to leave the ghetto, so lack of food caused some children to starve. Conditions improved somewhat in 1940 as Jews were resettled in a different neighborhood. Nonetheless, there were epidemics of typhus and tuberculosis from what was still overcrowding and lack of adequate sanitation. By 1941, many Jews were conscripted for forced labor. In 1942, Kock's Jews were deported. In August, some were sent to Parszew and then on to Treblinka where they were immediately murdered. In September, able men were sent to labor camps, and in October, hundreds were sent to Lukow's ghetto where a few weeks later they too were sent to Treblinka to be murdered. During these months, there were several mass killings of Jews in Kock. Only about 30 of Kock's Jews are thought to have survived the The Holocaust during the war. Several were saved by Polish Christian villagers. One survivor was murdered in Kock after liberation. The Jewish community was not reestablished after the war. The brief discussion of the experience of the Jewish population of Kock is described in the Encyclopedia of Camps and Ghettos.

David was a vital part of what many consider to be the best Wallaby side of all time throughout those 1998,1999 & 2000 seasons where the team won everything on offer. The 1999 World Cup win was followed up by Australia's first ever tri nations series win in 2000, following which he retired from test rugby. David moved to the UK to play for NEC Harlequins in the Zurich Premiership. A serious knee injury in the 2001 European Shield Final (Harlequins won the game 42‚Äì33 in extra time) ended Wilson's playing career at the age of 35 and he was forced to retire from the game.

His book The Struggle for Survival revealed much about Churchill's physical and psychological state, possibly including clinical depression, while coping with the strain of high office. It was not, however, the strict historical record that it appeared to be, as it lacked any accredited sources, such as diary-entries or confirmed reporting of conversations. Some people also felt that it breached patient‚Äìdoctor confidentiality. Background Moran was born in Skipton, Yorkshire, young son and youngest of three children of John Forsythe Wilson, a physician and general practitioner from northern Ireland, and his wife Mary Jane, daughter of the Reverend John Julius Hannah, a Presbyterian minister of Clogher. He was educated at Pocklington Grammar School then studied medicine at St Mary's Hospital Medical School, now the Imperial College School of Medicine, graduating with a MBBS in 1908. He took his MD degree in 1913 at the same medical school. As a student he played in the college rugby fifteen as well as at county level for Middlesex. He enlisted in the Royal Army Medical Corps in the First World War, rising to major. He was medical officer to the 1st Battalion of the Royal Fusiliers from 1914 to 1917 and medical officer in charge of the medical facilities at the British 7th Stationary Hospital in Boulogne from 1917 to 1918. He won the Military Cross in 1916 for services during the Battle of the Somme, and the Italian Silver Medal of Military Valour in 1917 and was twice mentioned in despatches. At the end of war he researched into the effects of mustard gas. Later medical career Longer term, based on his frontline experience, he developed his study into the effects of wartime conditions on the resilience of troops which was published in the 1930s as a series of lectures titled The Mind in War and culminated in a book The Anatomy of Courage, published in 1945 at the end of the Second World War. He lectured on courage to officer students at the Staff College in Camberley. He was the dean of St Mary's Hospital Medical School between 1920 and 1945, where he oversaw the rebuilding of the premises, while also maintaining a private practice in London at Number 129, Harley Street. In 1938 he chaired a Home Office committee to plan the organization of London's hospitals to receive casualties expected in the then anticipated Second World War. He was a prominent scientist in his day, and was elected president of the Royal College of Physicians in April 1941 and was re-elected each year until 1950, when he resigned in favour of Russell Brain. He was knighted in 1938 and was created Baron Moran, of Manton in the County of Wilts on 8 March 1943 and made his maiden speech in the House of Lords, the same year, on the Beveridge Report. He was also involved in many other debates on the National Health Service. His skilfulness in negotiations with the British Medical Association and the Ministry of Health gave him the nickname \\"Corkscrew Charlie\\". He helped set up the Spens Committee which laid down the remuneration of general practitioners and dentists, and chaired the government standing committee setting the payment of specialists from 1949 to 1961. He declined a Knight Grand Cross of the Order of the British Empire (GBE) offered at the end of the chairmanship. Churchill's physician and The Struggle for Survival During his time as Winston Churchill's private physician, which began in May 1940, two weeks into Churchill's first term as Prime Minister, Moran accompanied Churchill on most of his travels, and met several prominent figures, including Anthony Eden, Field-Marshal Montgomery (later the 1st Viscount Montgomery of Alamein), Louis Mountbatten and Lord Beaverbrook. He also selected appropriate consulting specialists for Churchill when necessary. Although Moran found the travels frustrating when they conflicted with business planning the NHS in London, according to one biographer, Professor Richard Lovell, Moran saw his patient as \\"the greatest Englishman since Chatham and regarded his care of him as his wartime duty\\". In mid-1964, Clementine Churchill learned that Moran was planning to publish a book detailing his personal relationship with Churchill. Lady Churchill criticised his intentions, \\"I had always supposed that the relationship between a doctor and his patient was one of complete confidence‚Ä¶\\". Moran's book, The Struggle for Survival, is about Churchill during and after the war. It was published in 1966, fifteen months after Churchill's death, and aroused much controversy, as its detailed descriptions of Churchill's failing health appeared to constitute a breach of patient- doctor confidentiality.Wellcome Library Moran maintained that he had compiled the book with Churchill's knowledge, although he had sought no permission to include conversations made in his professional capacity with the Cabinet Secretary, other officials and medical colleagues. The book revealed that \\"Black Dog\\" was the name Churchill gave to \\"the prolonged fits of depression from which he suffered\\",Lord Moran, Winston Churchill: the Struggle for Survival, 1940‚Äì1965 (Constable) leading many later authors to suggest that throughout his life Churchill was a victim of, or at risk from, clinical depression. Formulated in this way, Churchill's mental health history contains unmistakable echoes of the seminal interpretation of Lord Moran's Black Dog revelations made in an essay by Dr Joseph Storr.A. Storr, \\"The Man\\", in A. J. P. Taylor et al., Churchill: Four Faces and the Man (Penguin, 1973). In drawing so heavily on Moran for what he took to be the latter's totally reliable, first-hand clinical evidence of Churchill's lifelong struggle with \\"prolonged and recurrent depression\\" and its associated \\"despair\\", Storr produced a seemingly authoritative and persuasive diagnostic essay that, in the words of John Ramsden, \\"strongly influenced all later accounts\\".J. Ramsden, Man of the Century: Winston Churchill and his Legend since 1945 (Harper Collins, 2003), p. 531. However, Storr was not aware that, as Professor Lovell has shown, Moran, contrary to the impression created in his book, kept no actual diary during his years as Churchill's doctor. Nor was Storr aware that Moran's book as published was a much rewritten account which mixed together Moran's contemporaneous jottings with later material acquired from other sources.R. Lovell, Churchill's Doctor (Royal Society of Medicine Services, 1992) Wilfred Attenborough has demonstrated the key Black Dog \\"diary\\" entry for 14 August 1944 was an arbitrarily dated pastiche in which the explicit reference to Black Dog‚Äîthe first of the few in the book (with an associated footnote definition of the term)‚Äîwas taken, not from anything Churchill had said to Moran, but from much later claims made to Moran by Brendan Bracken (a non-clinician and wartime Minister of Information) in 1958.W. Attenborough, Churchill and the \\"Black Dog\\" of Depression (Palgrave, 2014), pp. 187‚Äì97. Although seemingly unnoticed by Storr and those he influenced, Moran later on in his book retracts his earlier suggestion, also derived from Bracken, that, towards the end of the Second World War, Churchill was succumbing to \\"the inborn melancholia of the Churchill blood\\". Also unnoticed by Storr and others is Moran's statement in his final chapter that Churchill had managed before the start of the First World War \\"to extirpate bouts of depression from his system\\".Lord Moran, Struggle for Survival, pp. 307, 309‚Äì10, 785‚Äì86, 786‚Äì88. Despite the difficulties with Moran's book, the many illustrations it provides of a Churchill understandably plunged into temporary low moods by military defeats and other severely adverse developments make a compelling portrait of a great man reacting to, but not significantly impeded by, worry and overstrain, consistent with the portraits of others who worked closely with Churchill.Sir John Wheeler-Bennett (ed.), Action This Day (Macmillan, 1968); J. Colville, The Fringes of Power (Hodder and Stoughton, 1985); Lord Ismay, Memoirs (Heinemann, 1960); Harriman, A. and Abel, E., Special Envoy to Churchill and Stalin, 1941‚Äì1946 (Hutchinson, 1976). Moreover, it can be deduced from Moran's book that Churchill did not receive medication for depression‚Äîthe amphetamine that Moran prescribed for special occasions, especially for big speeches from the autumn of 1953 onwards, was to combat the effects of Churchill's stroke of that year.W. Attenborough, Churchill and the \\"Black Dog\\" of Depression (Palgrave, 2014), pp. 153‚Äì58. Besides medical observations, Moran also recounted personal political comments made by Churchill in conversation. Visiting Churchill on the afternoon following the announcement of the 1945 General Election results, Moran commiserated with him on the \\"ingratitude\\" of the British public for voting in a Labour government, to which Churchill, referring to the recent wartime hardships, replied \\"I wouldn't call it that. They have had a very hard time\\".Gilbert, Martin. Winston S. Churchill: Never Despair: 1945‚Äì1965 (1988), pp. 57, 107‚Äì09. He also recalled Churchill suggesting in 1946‚Äîthe year before he put the idea (unsuccessfully) in a memo to President Truman‚Äîthat the United States make a pre-emptive atomic bomb attack on Moscow while the Soviet Union did not yet possess nuclear weapons. The motivations behind the publication of Moran's book, The Struggle for Survival, and his criticisms of Churchill, may have been due to Moran's personal grievances against Churchill's staunch imperialist attitudes. He once stated: \\"Winston thinks only of the colour of their skin.\\" Family and later life Moran married in 1919 Dorothy Dufton, daughter of Samuel Felix Dufton, HM Inspector of Schools for Yorkshire. She was a research physiologist, who had been awarded the MBE for work with the Ministry of Munitions in World War I. They had two sons, John (the second Baron) and Geoffrey. He died in 1977 aged 94 at the latter son's home in Newton Valence, Hampshire, and was buried in the churchyard there. He was survived by his wife, who died in 1983. Moran said he was a descendant of essayist William Hazlitt, whose surname was given as a middle name to his own second son. Richard Lovell notes the ancestor was surnamed Haslett.

Team history The Nuggets entered the National Basketball League (NBL) for the first time in 1990. After finishing in the top six in five of their first eight seasons, and making the semi- finals three times in that span, the Nuggets finished in the bottom four in their next 14 seasons, including being perennial wooden spooners. Following a tumultuous 2008 season, where the Nuggets collected their fourth consecutive wooden spoon and had mass player turnover throughout the year, Basketball Otago withdrew the Nuggets from the 2009 season, citing financial concerns.

The R7 was the first major facelift, introduced in 1997, featuring a completely new bonnet, front quarter panels, and grille. This was the last Rodeo to have chrome bumpers. The R9 arrived later in 1998, which replaced the chrome bumper with plastic bumpers on all models. A V6 engine became available for the first time, which proved very popular. An optional driver's airbag became available for the first time in 2000. In 2001, Rodeos received updated tail lights with clear indicators, replacing the previous orange-coloured ones. Larger composite headlights replaced the previous rectangular sealed beams. A final update in 2002 saw the circular Holden logo appear on the grille, replacing the \\"Holden\\" lettering. The 4JB1T turbo diesel engine proved popular in 4x4 models despite its rough running characteristics. 4JB1T in the 4x4 models was not fuel efficient and hampered by 4.55:1 differential ratios giving high engine RPM at highway speeds. By the end of its use in the R9 the 4JB1T reached Euro 2 emission standards. It was superseded late in the R9 lifespan before the all new RA. Although Japanese sales of the Isuzu Faster ceased in October 1994, it remained in production until general exports began in June 2003 of its Thai-produced replacement, the Isuzu D-Max which launched in its home market of Thailand in May 2002.

Fire acts favorably for some species. \\"Passive pyrophytes\\" resist the effects of fire, particularly when it passes over quickly, and hence can out-compete less resistant plants, which are damaged. \\"Active pyrophytes\\" have a similar competing advantage to passive pyrophytes, but they also contain volatile oils and hence encourage the incidence of fires which are beneficial to them. \\"Pyrophile\\" plants are plants which require fire in order to complete their cycle of reproduction.  Passive pyrophytes  Sequoia sempervirens with remainings of a fire older than 100 years These resist fire with adaptations including thick bark, tissue with high moisture content, or underground storage structures. Examples include: * Longleaf pine (Pinus palustris) * Giant sequoia (Sequoiadendron giganteum) * Coast redwood (Sequoia sempervirens) * Cork oak (Quercus suber) * Niaouli (Melaleuca quinquenervia) which is extending in areas where bush fires are a mode of clearing (e.g. New Caledonia). * Venus fly trap (Dionaea muscipula) ‚Äì this grows low to the ground in acid marshes in North Carolina, and resists fires passing over due to being close to the moist soil; fire suppression threatens the species in its natural environment. * White asphodel (Asphodelus albus) For some species of pine, such as Aleppo pine (Pinus halepensis), European black pine (Pinus nigra) and lodgepole pine (Pinus contorta), the effects of fire can be antagonistic: if moderate, it helps pine cone bursting, seed dispersion and the cleaning of the underwoods; if intense, it destroys these resinous trees.  Active pyrophytes  Some trees and shrubs such as the Eucalyptus of Australia actually encourage the spread of fires by producing inflammable oils, and are dependent on their resistance to the fire which keeps other species of tree from invading their habitat.  Pyrophile plants  Other plants which need fire for their reproduction are called pyrophile. The passage of fire, by increasing temperature and releasing smoke, is necessary to raise seeds dormancy of pyrophile plants such as Cistus and Byblis an Australian passive carnivorous plant.

It is fuel injected, has an aluminum-alloy cylinder block and cylinder head, is a SOHC 16-valve design (four valves per cylinder) and utilizes Honda's i-VTEC system. The R series engine has a compression ratio of 10.5:1, features a \\"drive by wire\\" throttle system which is computer controlled to reduce pumping losses and create a smooth torque curve. The engine uses many advanced technologies to improve fuel economy and reduce friction. Piston rings are given an ion plating and weight is reduced with plastic and aluminum parts and variable length intake manifolds that maintain ram air at a wide RPM range. The engine also features piston cooling jets, previously available only on high performance engines, and in the ninth- generation 1.8L Civic (2012-2015) the pistons are treated with molybdenum disulfide applied in a polka-dot pattern. The automatic transmission model is rated at California Air Resources Board (CARB) ULEV-2 (Ultra Low Emissions Vehicle) with fuel economy city, and highway.

Richmond had been made the temporary capital after urging from Thomas Jefferson years earlier, and it was soon decided to make the move permanent. Two months later, on July 2, a charter was written up, and the city was incorporated. Twelve men were to be elected from the City at-large and were to select one of their own to act as Mayor, another to serve as Recorder and four to serve as Aldermen. The remaining six were to serve as members of the Common Council. All positions had term limits of three years, with the exception of the mayor who could only serve one year consecutively. A vote was held at a meeting the following day, and Dr. William Foushee, Sr. was chosen as the first mayor. In March 1851, the decision was made to replace the original Richmond City Charter. It was decided that all city officials were to be popularly elected. After the 12-year tenure of William Lambert and his short-term replacement by recorder Samuel C. Pulliam, elections were held, with Joseph C. Mayo coming out on top. Mayo was deposed in April 1865, weeks before the end of the American Civil War, when Union forces captured the city. The system set forth by the Second City Charter worked as long as the City was small and most voters knew personally, the qualifications of the men for whom they were voting and the requirements for the jobs to which they were elected. Beginning in 1948, Richmond eliminated the popularly elected mayor's office, and instituted a council-manager form of government. This lasted until 2004, when the City Charter was changed once again, bringing back the popularly elected mayor. Former Virginia Gov. L. Douglas Wilder was elected mayor that year. Of Virginia's 38 cities, only Richmond does not have a council-manager form of government.  Offices appointed  The mayor has the power to appoint the directors and administrative leaders of the following city offices and departments: * Chief Administrative Officer * Department of Economic and Community Development * Department of Finance * Department of Public Works * Department of Human Resources * Department of Human Services * Department of Information Technology * Department of Justice Services * Departments of Parks, Recreation and Community Facilities * Department of Planning and Zoning Review * Department of Procurement Services * Department of Public Utilities * Department of Public Works * Department of Social Services * Office of Budget and Strategic Planning * Office of Minority Business Development * Office of the Chief Administrative Officer * Office of the Mayor * Office of the Press Secretary * Richmond Fire Department * Richmond Police Department * Richmond Public Library * Richmond Public Schools  See also  *Government of Richmond, Virginia  References  External links  *Official Website ","title":"Mayor of Richmond, Virginia"},{"id":"4126629","text":"The Taranaki Mountainairs are a New Zealand basketball team based in New Plymouth.

Morasko is a part of the Stare Miasto district of Pozna≈Ñ, in western Poland. It covers a fairly large but little-urbanised area in the north of the city. To the west and north it borders on the village and municipality of Suchy Las, a developing area of suburban housing. To the east of Morasko are the neighbourhoods of Umultowo and Radojewo, and to the south is the densely built residential area of PiƒÖtkowo. For governmental purposes, Morasko is part of the osiedle of Morasko-Radojewo. History Disused part of the mansion. Morasko is first mentioned in 1388, as belonging to the parish of Chojnica, although there was probably a settlement there as early as the 11th century. A wooden church was built in the village (then known as Morawsko) in 1403, and it functioned as a separate parish for a time, but in 1507 it was reincorporated into Chojnica parish. A mansion was built in Morasko in 1783‚Äì1786, in late Baroque style. Between 1857 and 1887 (with the region now under Prussian rule) this was extended, in eclectic style, and a park was laid out around it. At the beginning of the 20th century Morasko was given the German name Nordheim. A Protestant church was built there in 1907, and in 1930‚Äì1931 (with the region again part of Poland) a Catholic church was built. In 1945 the village of Chojnica ceased to exist, being part of the Biedrusko military area, and Morasko became the Catholic parish seat (the parish also including Radojewo to the east). The former Protestant church became the parish church, the Church of the Beheading of St. John the Baptist. The former Catholic church is disused and in disrepair. The west part of the mansion is also in disrepair, while the east part is used as a convent by the Missionary Sisters of Christ the King (Siostry Misjonarki Chrystusa Kr√≥la). Geography The village of Morasko and surrounding areas (particularly those of Huby Moraskie to the south) were incorporated into the city of Pozna≈Ñ in 1987. The village now lies near the city's northern boundary. In the south- east of the wider Morasko area is a complex of buildings belonging to Adam Mickiewicz University, used mainly for natural science teaching. West of Morasko village is the Morasko meteorite nature reserve, a forest area containing a group of depressions believed to be meteorite craters. Also within this reserve is G√≥ra Moraska (Morasko Hill), whose summit is Pozna≈Ñ's highest point, with an altitude of .

Professional clubs compete in the Pro14, European Rugby Champions Cup and European Rugby Challenge Cup, while the Scottish League Championship exists for over 200 amateur and semi-professional clubs, as does a knock-out competition, the Scottish Cup.

The Kirkwall Ba game still takes place, and involves scrummaging. Scottish soccer enthusiasts also cite these games as ancestral to their sport. There is evidence for schoolboys playing a \\"football\\" ball game in Aberdeen in 1633 (some references cite 1636) which is notable as an early allusion to what some have considered to be passing the ball. The word \\"pass\\" in the most recent translation is derived from \\"huc percute\\" (strike it here) and later ' (strike the ball again) in the original Latin. It is not certain that the ball was being struck between members of the same team. The original word translated as \\"goal\\" is ', literally meaning the \\"pillar at each end of the circus course\\" in a Roman chariot race. There is a reference to \\"get hold of the ball before [another player] does\\" (Praeripe illi pilam si possis agere) suggesting that handling of the ball was allowed. One sentence states in the original 1930 translation \\"Throw yourself against him\\" ('). It is clear that the game was rough and tackles allowed included the \\"charging\\" and pushing/holding of opposing players (\\"drive that man back\\" in the original translation, \\"repelle eum\\" in original Latin). It has been suggested that this game bears similarities to rugby football. Contrary to media reports in 2006 there is no reference to forward passing, game rules, marking players or team formation. These reports described it as \\"an amazing new discovery\\" but has actually been well documented in football history literature since the early 20th century and available on the internet since at least 2000.Marples, Morris A History of Football, Secker and Warburg, London 1954 1800s‚Äìpresent The world's oldest continual rugby fixture was first played in 1858 between Merchiston Castle School and the former pupils of The Edinburgh Academy. Scotland was responsible for organising the very first rugby international when a side representing England met the Scottish national side on the cricket field of the Edinburgh Academy at their Raeburn Place ground on 27 March 1871; Scotland won by one goal. The Scottish Football Union (SFU) - later named SRU - was founded in 1873 (in the Staff Common Room at The Glasgow Academy) and was a founding member of the International Rugby Board in 1886 with Ireland and Wales. (England refused to join until 1890). Since that time, Scotland have been regular winners of the Calcutta Cup, the five nations championship (discontinued), and have been participants of (having never actually won) the Six Nations Championship, and every Rugby World Cup. Scotland has played a seminal role in the development of rugby, notably in rugby sevens, which were initially conceived by Ned Haig, a butcher from Melrose as a fundraising event for his local club in 1883. The first ever officially sanctioned international tournament of rugby occurred at Murrayfield as part of the \\"Scottish Rugby Union's celebration of rugby\\" centenary celebrations in 1973. Due to the success of the format, the ongoing Hong Kong Sevens was launched three years later. In 1993, the Rugby World Cup Sevens was launched and the trophy is known as the Melrose Cup in memory of Ned Haig's invention. In 1924 the SFU changed its name to the Scottish Rugby Union. International games were played at Inverleith from 1899 to 1925 when Murrayfield was opened.

The game is divided into professional and non-professional spheres. Previously there had been a domestic league that covered the country, the top division of which was essentially the elite of club rugby in Scotland. This league was established in the early 1970s to replace the complicated \\"unofficial championship\\" that had been competed for previously. Starting in the 1973‚Äì74 season, the clubs were organised into a league of six divisions - what today comprises the Scottish Premiership and National League elements of the League Championship. Originally, below the six divisions (but not connected by promotion or relegation) were a series of District Leagues, covering smaller geographical areas, organised by District Unions and sometimes involving second XVs. Over a period of time, these District divisions have been reformed and integrated into the Scottish rugby union system meaning that today, only four clubs don't have their first XVs in the interconnected league structure. The entire system is sponsored by the Royal Bank of Scotland (or RBS), making it known as the RBS League Championship. This league contains Scottish rugby union's traditional big name clubs, such as Melrose and Hawick, as well as major city clubs such as Boroughmuir, Heriots and Watsonians from Edinburgh, and Glasgow Hawks who were formed from an amalgamation of clubs in the 1990s. Clubs Traditionally, rugby clubs were often formed by universities, ex-pupils of independent schools and large state schools, and many clubs names still to this day include abbreviations such as: * 'High School Former Pupils' (for instance, Dundee HSFP RFC) * 'Former Pupils' (for instance, Stewart's Melville FP RFC) * 'Grammar School Former Pupils' (for instance, Aberdeen GSFP RFC) * 'University' (Aberdeen University Rugby Football Club AURFC) However, with the introduction of the league system in the 1970s and the resulting increase in competitiveness and standard of play, most of these clubs have had to loosen their participation criteria to include non ex-pupils. In most cases though the clubs squads do still comprise a large proportion of individuals with connections to the schools. Often the clubs will be part-financed, and their grounds maintained or even owned, by the schools themselves. In recent years the success of traditional 'Borders' league clubs such as Gala, Hawick etc were superimposed by the new breed of clubs such as Ayr RFC, Glasgow Hawks and Stirling County with Ayr securing three Premniership and Cup wins since 2008. Amalgamations of clubs are also reasonably frequent, and when this occurs the clubs often combine names, as in Hillhead Jordanhill RFC or Waysiders/Drumpellier RFC. Other leagues Scotland is also home to the oldest organised rugby union league in the world, the Border League, which was formed in 1901. The Border League does not take part in the pyramid structure of the National League, but all its clubs participate in it (and thus the Border League is now effectively a supplementary competition). Two small 'independent' leagues remain outside the system, the Highland Alliance League and the Grampian Alliance League but they have only four clubs between them (the remaining membership being second XVs of clubs in the League Championship) and are not likely to remain in existence for much longer. Aside from the schools, the other 'traditional powerhouse' of rugby in Scotland was the universities, and to this day the Scottish universities have their own league system independent of the BUCS system which covers the rest of Great Britain. However, the BUCS Scottish Conference comprises divisions of four or five teams, and therefore not many fixtures each season, so unofficial Saturday University Leagues are organised (somewhat informally) between the universities. As well as having their own leagues the universities often compete in the SRU league structure and cup competitions to a high standard, most notably in 2007‚Äì08 Aberdeen University became the first university side to make the SHE SRU finals day winning the Plate competition. The significance of the universities to the history of the SRU is evident when it is noted that four of the oldest 17 SRU affiliated clubs are university teams. Due to the social and amateur nature of the game, most clubs try to run as many teams as possible so that all their players get games on most weekends, and therefore a large system of what are effectively reserve leagues operate. Known as second XV, third XV, fourth XV, etc. depending on the quality of the players making up each team, their competitive activities were formally all supervised by The Scottish 2nd XV League - however in recent years disputes and breakaways have led to the formation of independent 2nd XV leagues in the Scottish Borders and in and around Edinburgh. See University Leagues in Scotland and 2nd XV Leagues in Scotland for details. For schools rugby see Brewin Dolphin Scottish Schools Cup. Changes for the professional era When professionalism was introduced into rugby union in the 1990s, and the Heineken Cup created for clubs across Europe, the SRU decided that the existing clubs operating in the Scottish leagues were not competitive enough. They were predominantly amateur, or at best paid small wages; they had low supports and small old-fashioned venues; and the quality of their play was, by the nature of these factors, comparatively low versus new professional clubs, provinces and regions in other countries. As a rule their players trained only two nights a week. Scotland has the oldest District provincial rugby sides in the world. The Glasgow - Edinburgh district derby was first played in 1872, hence the 1872 Cup played today. The District sides traditionally drew together the best amateur players from clubs in a given area; and the Scottish Inter-District Championship was founded in 1953. There were four standard districts ‚Äì Glasgow District; Edinburgh District; North and Midlands; and South ‚Äì they occasionally competed with an Anglo-Scots or Exile side as a fifth district in the Championship. The SRU decided to turn these standard Districts into four professional teams based roughly on the old districts: the Border Reivers based in Galashiels (with occasional matches elsewhere), the Caledonia Reds based in Aberdeen and Perth, Edinburgh and Glasgow. The aim of creating these 'pro-teams' or 'super-teams' was ensure that Scotland had fairly competitive sides operating in the European competitions, the Heineken Cup and European Challenge Cup (as well as the European Shield during its short existence), and to drive up standards of rugby in the country including developing players for the national side. Initially the 'pro-teams' were still competing in the Scottish Inter-District Championship, but a Welsh-Scottish League later developed, and from that development came the Celtic League with Ireland's introduction (and for a time there was also a cup competition, the Celtic Cup). The Celtic League has further expanded and is now known as the Pro14 and consists of Scottish, Welsh, Irish, Italian and South African sides. From four teams to two The four professional teams struggled in European competition and were a heavy financial burden for the union and for the formation of the Celtic League they were amalgamated into Edinburgh Reivers and Glasgow Caledonian Reds playing in Edinburgh and Glasgow respectively, and later renamed simply Edinburgh and Glasgow . After a few seasons with two teams, the SRU then reformed a Borders team, initially known as Border Reivers, then renamed The Borders, before reverting to Border Reivers again. At the time of this last change the other two sides were renamed Edinburgh Gunners and Glasgow Warriors. However, the SRU's extreme financial difficulties (they were over ¬£20M in debt) forced yet another re-think (especially when the Border Reivers were rooted to the bottom of the Celtic League season after season) ‚Äì at the end of season 2005‚Äì06, Edinburgh Gunners were sold to a private consortium led by Alex Carruthers, and renamed Edinburgh Rugby. Continuing difficulties However, even with the running costs of two instead of three teams, the SRU were still struggling. Many attempts were made to find private backers for Glasgow or the Borders (although the only investors interested in the latter wanted to move it to Falkirk, Stirling or Aberdeen) but in the end neither of the teams could be sold. As a result, at the end of 2006‚Äì07 the SRU yet again disbanded the Border Reivers, leaving Scotland with two pro-teams, one under private and one under SRU control. The relationship with Alex Carruthers and his ERC Group which owned Edinburgh Rugby proved to be very uncomfortable. The SRU defaulted in a number of payments of competition prize money to ERC, requiring the consortium to invest their own additional funds, and the SRU refused to share bar takings from Edinburgh Rugby matches at Murrayfield with ERC - at the same time, the SRU was unhappy about the signing policy and the unavailability of players for international team training. Following a bitter dispute in the press and media during 2007, in which legal action was started, and for a time Edinburgh Rugby was banned from participating in matches, the SRU agreed to buy back Edinburgh Rugby from Alex Carruthers. This caused much unrest in the Scottish Borders, as their team had been wound up only months before, when the SRU insisted it couldn't finance two pro-teams on its own. The SRU announced shortly after its buy-back that it intended to rename Edinburgh Rugby as Edinburgh RFC at some point in the future. From 2014‚Äì15. the Heineken Cup and original European Challenge Cup were respectively replaced by the European Rugby Champions Cup and European Rugby Challenge Cup. Scotland was guaranteed one place in the Champions Cup, awarded to the Scottish team that finished higher in the previous Pro12 season. The other Scottish team could qualify for the Champions Cup if it was one of the three Pro12 clubs with the best record, outside of the top team from each Pro12 nation (Ireland, Italy, Scotland, Wales). Additionally, starting in 2015‚Äì16, the second Scottish team could potentially qualify through a play-off involving another Pro12 side and one each from the English Premiership and France's Top 14. Otherwise, that team will participate in the Challenge Cup. With Pro12 adding two South African teams in 2017‚Äì18, leading to that competition adopting its current name of Pro14, the qualification system for the Champions Cup was changed. Effective with the 2017‚Äì18 Pro14 season, the top three teams from each of Pro14's two conferences, excluding the South African sides, automatically qualify for the following season's Champions Cup. The previous requirement that each Celtic nation and Italy be represented in the Champions Cup was eliminated. A seventh place in the Champions Cup is awarded to the winner of a play-off between the next best-placed eligible team (again excluding South African sides) from each conference. As in the past, any Scottish side that does not qualify for the Champions Cup receives a place in the Challenge Cup. Most recently, the SRU has invested in Major League Rugby, a fledgling professional league based in the United States. MLR launched in 2018 with seven teams, all U.S.-based, and expanded to nine in 2019 with the addition of single teams in the U.S. and Canada. The SRU purchased a minority stake in Washington, D.C.-based Old Glory DC, one of three U.S. teams set to join MLR in 2020. Popularity The West Stand of Murrayfield Stadium, demonstrating the popularity of Scottish rugby at international level Rugby union is one of the national sport in Scotland. It is most popular in the Borders region where it is played widely, although even here ground is being lost to football, with professionalism and migration contributing to the challenges facing the game .Kelly (2008) Flowers of Scotland?: Rugby Union, National Identities and Class Distinction. Stadion: International Journal of the History of Sport, 34, 1: 83-99 In the rest of the country rugby tends to be played mainly by private schools. Whilst attendances at club matches in Scotland are fairly poor, the national team draws a sizeable crowd to Murrayfield for Six Nations matches. Some traditionalists claim that in recent years the national rugby union team has become a focal point for football-type sporting nationalism. Aside from Murrayfield, there are few major rugby stadiums in Scotland. Many clubs in the Scottish Borders have grandstands and city sides in Edinburgh and Glasgow also have seated, covered stands. Statistics According to the International Rugby Board as of September 2010, Scotland has 241 rugby union clubs; 343 referees; 7,556 pre-teen male players; 13,402 teen male players; 10,556 senior male players (total male players 31,514) as well as 1,303 (total) female players. However, many more pre teen players are not registered with the SRU. Demographics Rugby union is particularly popular in the Borders region. The towns of Hawick, Galashiels, Jedburgh and Selkirk have produced many international players. The national team The first international rugby union match in the world was played between England and Scotland in Edinburgh in 1871. Scotland won 4‚Äì1. The national side is considered by the IRB to belong in the top tier of nations, although they are not as competitive as the elite sides such as New Zealand or South Africa. They usually play their home matches at Murrayfield Stadium in the West End of Edinburgh. Scotland contest the Calcutta Cup with England as part of the Six Nations Championship. The Calcutta Cup was last won by England in the 2020 Six Nations Championship beating Scotland 13-6. Every four years the British and Irish Lions go on tour with players from Scotland as well as England, Ireland and Wales. Scottish players are also regularly selected to represent The Barbarians. Scottish Sports Hall of Fame The following rugby players have been inducted to the Scottish Sports Hall of Fame: *Finlay Calder *Douglas Elliot *Gavin Hastings *Andy Irvine *George MacPherson *Mark Morrison *David Sole *Robert Wilson Shaw *Grahame Budge At least two other rugby players were inducted primarily for achievements in other sports‚ÄîEric Liddell in athletics, and Leslie Balfour- Melville (1854‚Äì1937), who played many other sports, as an all-rounder.

Oily, saucy flavors, enhanced by MSG and starches. Indian Chinese cuisine, Indo-Chinese cuisine, Desi-Chinese cuisine, Sino- Indian cuisine, or Chindian cuisine is a distinct culinary style which combines aspects of both Indian and Chinese foods and flavors. Though the cuisines have mixed throughout history both through trade and influence, the most popular origin story of the fusion food resides with the original Chinese ethnic community of Kolkata, who immigrated to India looking for better prospects and a better life around 250 years ago. Opening restaurant businesses in the area, these early Chinese immigrants adapted their culinary styles to suit the tastes of their Indian patrons. Chinese Indian food is generally characterized by its ingredients: Indian vegetables and spices are used, along with a heavy amount of pungent Chinese sauces, thickening agents, and oil. Stir-fried in a wok, Indo-Chinese food takes Chinese culinary styles and adds spices and flavors familiar to the Indian tongue. This idea of flavorful, saucy Chinese food cooked with Indian spices and vegetables has become integral to the mainstream culinary scenes of both India and Bangladesh, and its diffusion to nations like America, Great Britain, and Canada has shaped and altered the global view of Chinese, Indian, and Asian cuisines. Origins Chinese New Year celebration in Kolkata. (2014) Tiretti Bazaar in Kolkata, India's only Chinatown (2013).  Chinese in India  The most popularized theory for the origins of Indian Chinese food is centered around Chinese immigrants settling in Calcutta (now Kolkata). Calcutta was the capital of British-ruled India when it was governed by the East India Trading Company (from 1757 to 1858). The city's relation to the British crown made it a great place for material prospects and opportunity, which drew businessmen and immigrant workers from surrounding areas. Located in the Northeastern region of India, Calcutta was the most accessible metropolitan area of the country by land from China; thus, this city harbored the very first Chinese settler, a southern Chinese man named Tong Atchew (also referred to as Yang Dazhao or Yang Tai Chow). In 1778, Atchew settled twenty miles southwest of Kolkata (then Calcutta), founding a sugar mill along with five dozen or so Chinese laborers. Following Atchew's footsteps, waves of immigrants from the Guangdong province of China fled to India due to civil war, famine, poverty, and conflict. Hakka Chinese found their niche as cobblers and tanners, while the Cantonese settled majorly as carpenters and the Hubeinese as dentists; however, an occupation popular among all groups, especially of wives supporting their laboring husbands, was a restaurateur. From these first early settlers, communities of Chinese influence sprung up throughout the area, neighborhoods of immigrants cooking and eating foods from their homeland. These Canton cuisines, known in China to be light and fresh in flavor, began to adapt and evolve to the new area. One reason is due to the availability of ingredients and spices being different from those in Guangdong, therefore forcing the flavors to naturally Indianize; additionally, Chinese businesses began to cater their foods to the tastes of their Indian patrons to increase sales, utilizing more spices and heavier douses of sauce and oil than their traditional techniques required. Recognized as one of the first Indo-Chinese restaurants in the country, the still-standing corner eatery of Eau Chew gained its popularity by using the fashionable pull of exotic Chinese foods combined with non-threatening familiar flavors of chili, curry, and corn starch, to attract and keep-on customers. Kolkata today boasts the only Chinatown in the country, a neighborhood known as the Tiretti Bazaar. This being said, nearly every city in India has these adapted \\"Chinese\\" foods, whether found in restaurants or hawked by roadside venders, as the greasy, spicy, stir-fried food has become wildly popular throughout the country. It is important also to note those Chinese returning from India to their homelands in Guangdong province, for they often brought their new culinary practices and flavors with them, working to Indianize the taste of Cantonese-style foods in southern coastal cities such as Hong Kong.  Additional Origin Points  As Indian historian Pushpesh Pant once noted, Indian Chinese food is \\"the result of several isolated encounters.\\" These encounters, in addition to the Kolkata story, include influences of the Silk Road, historical ties, and geography. Each of these aspects has worked in some way to tie the culinary practices and flavors of the two countries together, marking other possible origin points for the Indian Chinese culinary tradition. Silk Road routes connecting the (near and far) East with the West. = Silk Road Cultural Exchange = The Silk Road (or Silk Routes) was a network of trading posts and pathways on land and sea utilized from 130 BCE to 1453 CE spanning from China and the Indonesian islands through India and the Middle East, all the way to northeastern Africa and Italy. The significance of this route to ancient history is undeniable, the exchange of goods, diseases, and ideas from the East to West and vice versa has had a lasting impact upon human history. Chinese and Indian merchants would carry their goods through these neighboring countries: silks, rice, and crockery coming from China, with a plethora of influential spices sprouting from India. Another exchange between China and India was religion, Buddhism came to China from India via the Silk Road, where aspects of Indian culture, practices, and beliefs melded with Chinese traditions, forming the Mahayana Buddhism religion. Just as the Chinese adapted Buddhist practices to their own beliefs, the two cultures adopted certain aspects of the other throughout their historical interactions and exchanges. Indian rice dishes of are found in the nation's South, cooked in Indianized Chinese woks, and there are spices of ginger, cinnamon, and black pepper found in various Chinese culinary styles; in this way, it can be seen how the Silk Road was vital in bringing characteristics of the two cultures together. Indian and Chinese food aspects collided hundreds of years ago to form culinary traditions now inextricable with the nations, these fusion cuisines appearing long before the first Chinese settlers in Kolkata. Expansion of Buddhism throughout Asia. Thai red curry: the red chilies give it color and spice. = Influences on Southeast Asian Cuisine = Geographically, India and China are neighbors; historically, the two nations are ancient empires. Two of the most populous countries in the world today, both India and China boast lengthy histories. Since the second century CE, Hindu rulers presided over Southeast Asian countries and Chinese regimes ruled the more eastern regions, such as Cambodia. Similarly, Asia's southeast was historically populated by immigrants from both China and India, namely the Han and Tamil ethnic groups who joined scattered aboriginal societies. The influences of China and India can be detected in the cuisines of Southeast Asia, where the two culinary practices have been combined, adapted, and developed by generations of people. For example, the Chinese practice of rice cultivation was introduced to the regions of Southeast Asia and Nepal in the thirtieth century BC, where it has existed as an irreplaceable and undeniable staple ever since. Furthermore, now completely embedded within Southeast Asian culinary practices, Chinese cooking and eating implements such as spoons, chopsticks, and woks were other products which were introduced to the region. Evidence of Indian influence, in addition to religious philosophies and ancient architecture, can be found in the spices and flavors of Southeast Asian cooking. Curries‚Äîmeat, fish, or vegetables cooked in a spiced sauce accompanied by rice or bread‚Äîoriginated on the Indian subcontinent, but have since diffused throughout Asia. Spices such as turmeric, coriander, pepper, brown mustard, and ginger are present in curries throughout Southeast Asia, though each country has adapted the practice to utilize their own regional ingredients as well; most notably, Indonesian, Malaysian, Thai, and Cambodian cuisines all have strong ties to Indian-style curry flavors. These aspects of both Chinese and Indian culinary practices and traditions have combined to create the origins of what is now a rich and diverse culinary scene making up Asia's southeastern region. Thus, with the joined influence of the two cultures, Southeast Asian cuisine itself is another example of Indian Chinese food origins. Tibet, Nepal, and Myanmar; bordered by India and China. Momo dumplings; found in Nepal, Tibet, and Northeastern India. = Culinary Diffusion Across Borders = In addition to Southeast Asia, China has been influenced by Indian spices as well, especially in the autonomous region of Tibet, with Nepal (formerly a part of India) also possessing culinary practices hailing from both its Chinese and Indian neighbors. Another origin point of Indian Chinese food can be traced to the cultures of Nepalese and Tibetan peoples, whose lands are encompassed mostly by the two nations (India and China). Although not aligned with the greasy and pungent flavors of the culinary traditions which evolved in Kolkata, the simple foods of Nepal are often accompanied by rice, and consist of curries or spiced vegetables stir- fried or boiled in an Indian-style wok called a karahi. Tibetan food, in addition to high altitude and harsh climates, is geographically influenced by the flavors of the countries surrounding it: notably Nepal, India, and China. Tibet is a nation heavily influenced by Indian Buddhist values (first brought in the fifth century AD), and with beliefs and ideas travels culture and food as well. Noodles and teas from China (vital in making the tsampa eaten with every meal), brown mustard from India, and even a \\"momo\\" dumpling dish shared with Nepal are all significant ingredients and dishes of Tibetan cuisine. With the diffusion of ingredients, culinary styles, and flavors across borders, the regions of Nepal and Tibet (as well as Bhutan) which touch both India and China inadvertently developed cuisines mixing both Chinese and Indian styles and tastes, creating yet another Indo-Chinese food origin. Features Foods tend to be flavoured with spices such as cumin, coriander seeds, and turmeric, which with a few regional exceptions, such as Xinjiang, are traditionally not associated with much of Chinese cuisine. Hot chilli, ginger, garlic, sesame seeds, dry red chilis, black pepper corns and yogurt are also frequently used in dishes. This makes Indian Chinese food similar in taste to many ethnic dishes in Southeast Asian countries such as Singapore and Malaysia, which have strong Chinese and Indian cultural influences. Non-staple dishes are by default served with generous helpings of gravy, although they can also be ordered \\"dry\\" or \\"without gravy\\". Culinary styles often seen in Indian Chinese fare include \\"Chili\\" (implying batter-fried items cooked with pieces of chili pepper), \\"Manchurian\\" (implying a sweet and salty brown sauce), and \\"Schezwan\\" (sic - see below) (implying a spicy red sauce). Dishes=Main courses Ubiquitous main courses, or entrees, include: Chilli Paneer * Chilli Chicken/Prawn/Fish/Mutton/Vegetables/Paneer, dry or gravy * Garlic Chicken/Prawn/Fish/Mutton/Vegetables/Paneer * Schezwan (sic) Chicken/Prawn/Fish/Mutton/Vegetables/Paneer - dishes with this name in fact usually bear very little resemblance to ones from China's Sichuan Province (although they sometimes contain Sichuan peppercorns). They instead center mainly around a sauce containing Indian red chillies and garlic. (The spelling of \\"Schezwan\\" is not a mis-print; this is indeed how the term tends to be spelled in the Indo-Chinese kitchen rather than \\"Sichuan\\", \\"Szechuan\\" or \\"Szechwan\\"). * Ginger Chicken/Prawn/Fish/Mutton/Vegetables/Paneer * Manchurian Chicken/Prawn/Fish/Mutton/Vegetables/Paneer, generally consisting of a variety of meats or paneer with vegetables in a spicy brown sauce.

Availability Indian Chinese food is readily available in major metropolitan areas of India such as Bhopal, Surat, Vadodara, Rajkot, Mumbai, Pune, Chennai, Kochi, Guwahati, Hyderabad, Delhi, Lucknow, Kolkata and Bangalore. It is also available in a number of towns and at dhabas (roadside stalls), also popularly referred to as \\"Fast food\\", adjacent to major Indian roads and highways. Many restaurants have a Chinese section in their menus, and some are even dedicated to serving Indian Chinese food. It can also be found in mobile kitchen carts (lari or rekdi) that ply the streets of cities, prepared in woks over a portable gas burner. Manchurian sauce, Schezwan sauce, soy sauce and Hakka noodles are available in many stores in cities across the country. Many overseas Indian restaurants in the West and the Middle East also cater to the overseas Indians' nostalgic taste for Indian Chinese food. The cuisine is also branching out into the mainstream in major cities of North America, such as New York City, San Francisco, Philadelphia, Chicago, Toronto, Los Angeles, Atlanta, Phoenix and Vancouver. Chinese food in Nairobi, Kenya, also tends to be of this style. It is also available in Australia, especially in Sydney and Melbourne. In many of these places, the restaurants are labelled as Hakka Chinese, when in fact the cuisine itself has very little resemblance to authentic Hakka cuisine. \\"Hakka\\" label in these restaurants are usually referring to the owner's origins, and many Chinese restaurant owners in India were of Hakka origin. Hakka cuisine has since, rapidly been popularized in the west, especially in Ontario, Canada in restaurants like Super Hakka, or Indian-Chinese Hamilton Hakka . As of 2007, Chinese cuisine ranks as India's most favourite cuisine (after local food), growing at 9% annually. It is the most favoured option when young people go out to eat and the second favorite (after south Indian cuisine) when families dine out. Inchin's Bamboo Garden is the biggest Indian Chinese chain in America. Indian Chinese cuisine is also gaining popularity in the Kansai region of Japan.

Islands of differentiation are genomic regions with elevated measures of genetic differentiation. The authors examined island of differentiation within genomes and sought to answer (1) how they are formed and (2) what role they have in speciation. The flycatcher species complex is made up of four sister species and has a broad species range over all of Europe and parts of North Africa. The authors sequenced 200 genomes from 10 populations to an average of 14x coverage. The authors tested two prominent models for the accumulation of islands of speciation, speciation with gene flow and linkage selection. Some of the expected patterns for islands of differentiation forming accumulating under a gene flow model and reduced sequence divergence outside the islands of differentiation compared to the rest of the genome and expansion of the islands of differentiation as reproductive isolation is reinforced during the speciation process. Based on the genomic data, expectations from the speciation with gene flow model were not well supported. Instead there was more support for the linkage selection model for islands of variation model. Such as an inverse correlation between recombination rate and differentiation, low amounts of ancestral variation in low recombining regions, and a positive relationship with nucleotide diversity and recombination rate. Some of the main findings from the study were: *The differentiation landscapes were very similar across the four flycatcher species. *Tests using population genetic parameters to test assumptions indicated that differentiation landscape across the genomes were likely not caused by gene flow. *The signatures for background selection highly outweighed selective sweep signatures. Description The flycatchers in the genus Ficedula are typically small with slender bodies and rounded heads. In many cases they are sexually dimorphic in their plumage, with the males being brightly or strikingly coloured and the females being duller or drabber.

History The origin of the name \\"Offa's Church\\" suggests a connection to Offa, who was King of Mercia from 757 to 796 and the proximity to the manor house of Offchurch Bury lead Dugdale to infer there was a fortification of Offa's here deriving from the Saxon word burh or fortified place.William Dugdale, The Antiquites of Warwickshire, 1656 Camden went further and quoted the legend that Offa's son, Fremund, 'a man of great renown', being murdered and 'buried at his Father's Palace, now called Offchurch'William Camden, Brittania, 1607 the church being built to commemorate his death. The village is not mentioned by name in Leofric's foundation charter of Coventry priory in 1043 or in Domesday Book, but the wording of the confirmation of the charter by Henry III in 1267 implies that the place was in possession of this priory from its foundation. At the time of the dissolution of the monasteries by Henry VIII the estate was purchased by the Knightley family who possessed it until the First World War. The estate was then purchased together with other estates by Joseph Watson, a soap manufacturer from Leeds, created 1st Baron Manton in 1922. He died in March of the same year, aged only 49, from a heart- attack, whilst out hunting beside two of his sons with the Warwickshire Foxhounds, at Upper Quinton, close to his new mansion. He had held his title for less than two months and was buried at Offchurch, in his hunting apparel.The Times, Obituary, 14 March 1922 At this time some development took place in the building of a series of cottages for estate workers during the 1920s (New Cottages, Bridge Cottages, Ford Cottages, Ham Barn Cottages, etc.) to similar designs. After the death of Baron Manton his widow resided at Offchurch Bury manor house, northwest of the village, until her death in 1936. The manor was then purchased by Harry Johnson, a textile manufacturer from Coventry and Macclesfield, whose descendants today retain much of the estate in 2011 and live at Offchurch Bury. Notable buildings The parish church of St. Gregory stands on the crest of the hill above the village. It consists of chancel with north vestry, nave with south porch, and west tower, and is built of the local red sandstone. There is no trace of Offa's church, but the church, rebuilt from 12th century onwards, on the supposed site of Offa's church contains Norman elements.Pevsner & Wedgwood, 1966, pp. 367-368Old Warwickshire Churches, W Hobart Bird 1936 and traces of an Anglo-Saxon cemetery were found about 1875 south of the church close to the road to Long Itchington.'Parishes: Offchurch', A History of the County of Warwick: Volume 6: Knightlow hundred (1951), pp. 194-198. URL: Date accessed: 14 January 2012. A stone coffin is on display in the current church, but there is no direct evidence that this dates from Saxon times. A local legend says that if you go to the top of the church and jump off, King Offa will rise from the ground and catch you. Transport links Offchurch lies just off the Fosse Way, a Roman Road, and the Welsh Road, an important mediaeval drovers' road also passes through the village. Amenities The local amenities include the Church of England parish church of St. Gregory, a redeveloped village hallOffchurch Village Hall (part of the former village school) and the Stag's Head public house, now renamed \\"The Stag at Offchurch\\".The Stag at Offchurch The trackbed of the former railway between Leamington and Rugby, the Grand Union Canal and a network of footpaths make Offchurch a focus for walks in this part of rural Warwickshire.

Prior to the 1970s resignalling it was used for occasional departures, although today this happens very rarely and it is used largely for non-passenger trains. As originally built the station had a fourth platform to the south with its own loco release road, and platform three had no release facility. It seems the original design (as with the Dymchurch bay platform) assumed trains would arrive and then shunt into a different departure platform to release the loco and turn. In the 1920s the layout was altered to make operation more efficient. Platform 4 disappeared in the resignalling, as platforms were extended and has now been incorporated into the car park.

History The monastery, dedicated to Saints Peter and Paul, was founded in the late 8th century by Duke Tassilo III of Bavaria - the last of the Agilolfings, who was deposed by Charlemagne in 788. Under the Carolingian dynasty, the abbey became a possession of the Augsburg bishops. Its name Thierhaupten, which means \\"beasts' heads\\" in German, is supposed to refer to a heathen shrine formerly on the site, possibly the remnants of a pagan cult place. Abbey Church Sts Peter and Paul The abbey was looted by the Hungarians in 910 and again in 955, when they met with East Frankish troops at the nearby Battle of Lechfeld. It was re-established in 1028 at the behest of Bishop Gebhard II of Regensburg and the abbot of St. Emmeram's Abbey. Thierhaupten received further estates from the Wittelsbach emperor Louis IV and was vassalized by the dukes of Bavaria-Landshut upon his death. Devastated by the troops of the Swabian League in the course of the 1504 Landshut War of Succession and again in the Schmalkaldic War of 1546/47, it was re-built and prospered, although it always remained a small community. Heavily affected by the Thirty Years' War and the War of the Spanish Succession, it was finally dissolved in 1803 in the course of the secularisation in the Electorate of Bavaria. Buildings The buildings were sold off to a local businessman. The last abbot, Edmund Schmid, remained in Thierhaupten as the parish priest, and succeeded in 1812 in acquiring the former abbey church for use as the parish church. The remaining buildings were preserved, but gradually fell into disrepair, until they were bought by the Thierhaupten municipality administration in 1983 and renovated.

The Chut are one of the 4 main groups of Vietic speakers in Vietnam, the others being the Kinh, Muong, and Th·ªï. The nearby speakers of the Ngu·ªìn language are related to the Chut, but are classified by the Vietnamese government as Kinh.  Culture  Before 1954, the Chut were ignored by the colonial government. Traditionally, they were nomadic, living in temporary villages. However, they have now adopted a sedentary lifestyle. The name \\"Chut\\" refers to the cave and rock dwellings they once lived in. Originally, the Chut hunted small animals with crossbows and gathered fruit and fungi. They also use different traps to catch monkeys, civets, foxes, porcupines, birds and mice. Now, they grow rice, corn and tobacco, sowing the seeds with a stick. They also raise buffalo and cattle for plowing. Collective hunting is still done with dogs. When a large animal is caught, the hunter gets the back meat and the rest is divided equally among the others. They also catch fish using fishing rods, fishing nets and poisonous leaves. The Chut do not traditionally grow and weave cotton. In the past, traditional clothing was made from bark and consisted of simple loin-cloths and skirts, but now they wear modern clothing. Often, they barter with the Lao and Viet for goods such as farming equipment.  Sub- groups  There are multiple sub-ethnic groups within the Chut designation including the R·ª•c, M√†y, Arem, M√£ Li√™ng people, and S√°ch.

It is five miles (eight km) south of Hythe, and surrounded by flat countryside. The station opened on 16 July 1927 as Dymchurch (Marshlands), to distinguish it from a nearby station called Burmarsh for East Dymchurch and later as Dymchurch Bay. The station has two platforms connected by a footbridge. On the 'up' platform there is a shelter and a station master's house. On the 'down' platform is a station building incorporating a booking office and staff room, a shop selling souvenirs and refreshments, and a women's toilet. The men's toilets are in the supporting pillars of the footbridge, although only that on the 'down' platform is in use. The station is a tourist destination, largely for the sandy beaches nearby, the holiday arcades and an amusement park. It has three staff during the summer (one only, out of season). It is a block station for train control purposes.  History  Originally larger, the 1920s station had three platforms (two through platforms and a bay platform), a signal box, a turntable, and a mainline crossover to allow shuttle trains from New Romney. These never happened, and the turntable was removed in the 1930s. A second crossover was installed before the war and shuttles worked between Dymchurch and Hythe via Burmarsh Road. The signalbox was removed in the 1960s, and the remaining four switches bolted in the normal position, primitive colour-light signals being worked by domestic light switches from the booking office for normal block operations. They were not interlocked with the points, or each other! Today just one siding remains, plus one mainline crossover. This is the only place where a train can pass between the up and down lines in the eight miles between Hythe and New Romney - it is also the only location where a works train can be parked off the main line. The three points required (two crossover, one siding) have been operated from a ground frame since the station was resignalled with the installation of level crossing lights in 1976.  Signals  There are four signals on the Dymchurch control panel - an up home, an up starter, a down home, and a down starter. All of these are three-aspect colour-light signals. All four signals are linked to the lights at the level crossings on either side of the station. The signals are controlled from a panel in the booking office. This control panel also incorporates an Annetts Key which is interlocked with the running signals and allows access to the ground frame controlling a siding at the St Mary's Bay end of the station beside the Up line.

Born in Moscow in the Soviet Union, Eskin emigrated to Israel where he became involved in right-wing politics. He currently resides in Jerusalem. Early life Avigdor Eskin was born as Victor Valeryevich Eskin in Moscow in 1960. His father was from an assimilated Jewish family. His mother was a Ukrainian who was not considered a Jew under Jewish law, but may have had Jewish roots.http://mwcnews.net/focus/analysis/49259-russia-ukraine-and-the- jews.htmlhttps://www.haaretz.co.il/1.1227499https://www.jta.org/1981/05/07/archive/2-former- soviet-jews-in-u-s-to-tell-about-plight-of-soviet-jews When he was 11 years old, he began taking an interest in his Jewish identity after his grandmother told him about the Holocaust, and was further inspired by a religious Catholic friend. He began illicitly listening to Western radio stations such as Voice of America, Kol Israel, and the BBC Russian Service, and attending synagogue. He converted to Judaism soon afterward. He became an Orthodox Jew and committed Zionist. Despite harassment by the KGB, Eskin participated in Zionist activities. He became the youngest underground Hebrew teacher in the Soviet Union (which was illegal at the time), and translated right-wing radical Meir Kahane's Never Again manifesto into Russian. Eskin also became determined to emigrate to Israel, and was granted an exit visa in 1978. He emigrated to Israel in January 1979 at the age of 18. Years later, Eskin's mother and sisters immigrated to Israel.https://www.haaretz.com/israel- news/we-won-1.323092 In Israel, Eskin did military service in the Israel Defense Forces as part of the Hesder program, which combines regular military service with religious studies. Political activities Eskin was a founder of Israeli New Right movement together with the former MK Michael Kleiner and was behind the alliance between the Israeli right and American conservatives, led by senator Jesse Helms. Additionally, he organised the arms supply to the anti-communist guerrillas in Nicaragua. The most controversial of his activities was his support of the White regime in South Africa due to its staunch anti-communist politics, until its collapse in the early 1990s. Eskin laid a Pulsa diNura death curse on Prime Minister Yitzak Rabin in 1995, in response to the Oslo Accords. The Pulsa diNura is generally believed to \\"work\\" within 30 days, and it was 32 days after Eskin‚Äôs curse that Rabin was assassinated by Yigal Amir. In 1999, Eskin defiled the grave of Izz al-Din al- Qassam: He placed a pig's head on the grave. For this, he was sentenced to 30 months in prison, until 20 February 2003. In May 2005, Eskin won a slander case that he filed against Barry Chamish. He later described Chamish as \\"heavy drinking person, who sucked his theories from the bottle\\".  Feud with Avigdor Lieberman  In 2007, Eskin and two private investigators were arrested, but not indicted, on suspicion that they illegally wiretapped Strategic Affairs Minister Avigdor Lieberman and businessman Michael Chernoy. This was part of a long-running feud between Avigdor Eskin and Avigdor Lieberman - with Eskin describing Lieberman as a \\"leftist\\".  Russia and Ukraine  Eskin led the campaign against the awarding of the title of Hero of Ukraine to Stepan Bandera and Roman Shukhevych. The campaign attracted protests by 36 Israeli Knesset members and 10 members of the US Congress. In 2014, Eskin called for the Russian intervention in Ukraine during the Euromaidan revolution, and attempted to rally Knesset's support for it. Since the start of the War In Donbass, he supported the separatists. Eskin frequently lectures in Russia on political science and theological matters. He is liked within the Russian conservative circles, due to his staunch support of Vladimir Putin, and his anti-Ukrainian, anti-Georgian, and anti-Estonian stance.https://sputniknews.com/europe/201503131019458247/ http://www.jpost.com/Opinion/Op-Ed-Contributors/The-crisis-in-Ukraine-and-the- new-Jewish-question-351466http://www.haaretz.com/israel-news/we-won-1.323092 Eskin has close ties to Russian political analyst Aleksandr Dugin, having previously served on the central committee of Dugin's Eurasia Party. In May 2018 Ukraine has forbidden entry for three years with blocking of the right to dispose of assets and the property belonging to him Ukraine has forbidden entry for three years with blocking of the right to dispose of assets and the belonging property.  South Africa  Eskin is active in South African politics, frequently visiting the country, and working as an activist for Afrikaners' rights. In this role, he has caused diplomatic incidents, notably when describing Desmond Tutu as a fascist who is oppressing the Afrikaner people.Israeli activist supports Afrikaners, The Times, South Africa, Sally Evans, 7 October 2010 Personal life Eskin is married, with seven children.

Situated off Jefferstone Lane the station has two platforms, one of which (the 'down' platform) is without station buildings. The other (the 'up' platform) has three buildings. The first is a booking office and when the station is staffed, a passenger waiting room, which also houses the control equipment for the adjacent level crossing. This building is joined to an open-fronted platform shelter with passenger seating. The third building is a toilet block, although this has been out of use for some years. The station is currently used largely by local residents and passengers alighting here for the sandy beach. Also in St Mary's Bay, about a quarter of a mile further north down Dunstall Lane is the now-closed Golden Sands Halt railway station, formerly used by the Maddieson's Golden Sands holiday camp.  History  When first opened this station was named \\"Holiday Camp\\" after a nearby camp run by Allnatt Limited - later to become 'The School Journey Centre'. It has also been known as \\"Jesson\\" (Jesson Lane being the former name for Jefferstone Lane) and \\"Holiday Camp Jesson\\". Since 1946 it has been known as \\"St Mary's Bay\\" apart from a period from the early 1980s until the end of 2000 when it was renamed \\"Jefferstone Lane\\". In 2000/2001 the station was refurbished in the current colour scheme of green and cream. A small garden was also established by the booking office. Until the end of the 1990s this station was fully staffed during the summer period. Since then it has been staffed only on special event days or when surplus staff have been available. Generally passengers are now expected to purchase their tickets at their destination. Although no longer a block post for train control purposes, it was able to be used as such until 2000. The station had a single-aspect signal installation in the 'starter signal' position on the 'down' platform. The one displayable aspect was 'danger' (red). This was unusual in a non-block station. This signal had the outward appearance of being two-aspect, but this was an illusion, as one apparent signal aspect was in fact the repeater flashing light to indicate to train drivers that the adjacent level crossing (with Jefferstone Lane) signals had operated correctly to stop road traffic. A short distance south of St Mary's Bay station a signal box was originally erected to control movements in and out of sidings provided to serve Allnatt's holiday camp, and is marked as such on the title deeds for this part of the station site. When it fell into disuse (and in fact whether it was actually used at all) is unknown. No trace of it can be found today.Title deeds held by the Romney, Hythe & Dymchurch Light Railway Company The station was refurbished and repainted in 2009 by a small group of volunteers, helped by the railway's paid staff, with the aim of the station being opened on special events with small, but appropriate, photographic displays within the booking office. This has already happened during the 2008 and 2009 \\"Home Guard\\" weekends. Once the upgrading work on the level crossing has been completed, which involves the installation of level crossing barriers, there are plans to establish the station as a 'Haven for wildlife'. This will include the building of a dead hedge on the up platform, from the end of the toilet block to the Dymchurch end of the platform. Also the garden area will be replanted to encourage local wildlife along with the current assortment of bird feeders and bird boxes that are already present. The station became a request stop in the early 2010s.

The Brazilian Naval School () is the service academy of the Brazilian Navy, located in Rio de Janeiro, on Villegagnon Island just inside of Guanabara Bay. The Brazilian Naval School is an institution of higher education, which aims to train officers of the Brazilian Navy. History The Brazilian Naval School has its direct origins in the Portuguese Royal Naval Academy created in Lisbon, Portugal in the 18th century. In 1782, the Company of Midshipmen (Companhia dos Guardas-Marinhas) was created to frame and train the midshipmen (naval officer candidates) of the Portuguese Navy. The Company of Midshipmen was installed in the building of the Naval Arsenal of Lisbon. The Royal Academy of the Midshipmen (Academia Real dos Guardas-Marinhas) was created in 1792, as a university-level naval academy. This Academy integrated the already existing Company of Midshipmen as its student corps. In 1807, the Army of Napoleon invaded Portugal. In order not to be captured by the Napoleonic forces and maintain the independence of the Kingdom, the Portuguese Royal Court and government are transferred to the Portuguese colony of Brazil, continuing to rule from there. The Royal Academy of the Midshipmen and its Company of Midshipmen also embark in the naval fleet that carries the Royal Court to Brazil and are installed in Rio de Janeiro, in 1808. In 1823, one year following the independence of Brazil, the faculty and the students of the Academy of the Midshipmen had to choose either the Brazilian or the Portuguese nationality. Those that chose the Portuguese nationality returned to Portugal and the others remained in Brazil. Then, two academies come into existence: the Imperial Academy of Midshipmen (Academia Imperial dos Guardas-Marinhas) in the Empire of Brazil and the Royal Academy of Midshipmen in the Kingdom of Portugal (that would become the present Portuguese Naval School). The Brazilian Imperial Academy of Midshipmen become the School of Navy (Escola de Marinha), in 1858. In 1887, it became the Naval School (Escola Naval). Regatta To celebrate its foundation, every year the Navy promotes the traditional Naval Academy Regatta, the largest sailing race in Latin America.

The degree is usually contrasted with the Master of Science. Those admitted to the degree typically study linguistics, history, communication studies, diplomacy, public administration, political science, or other subjects within the scope of the humanities and social sciences; however, different universities have different conventions and may also offer the degree for fields typically considered within the natural sciences and mathematics. The degree can be conferred in respect of completing courses and passing examinations, research, or a combination of the two. The Master of Arts traces its origin to the teaching license or of the University of Paris. Europe=Germany In Germany, the traditional equivalent of the postgraduate Master of Arts was the Magister Artium. This degree, which usually required 5 years of studies, did exist in former West Germany and in reunited Germany, but not in former East Germany where all degree courses led to Diplom degrees. Traditional Magister degrees were granted in social sciences and most of the humanities (International Business, Affairs, European Studies and Economics included), with the exception of visual and performing arts such as music and theatre. The Magister Artium was either a double major degree or a combination of one major and two minors. German postgraduate Master's of Arts and Master's of Science degrees were introduced in 2001. Therefore, the new Master of Arts and the old Magister Artium degrees existed side by side until the phase out of the old degrees since 2010; Magister Artium degrees are still awarded (as of 2014). The new Bachelor of Arts and Master of Arts degrees together also require 5 years of studies, which is the reason why the new Master of Arts and the old Magister Artium degrees are considered equivalent. Netherlands In the Netherlands, the Master of Arts and the Master of Science degrees were introduced in 2002. Until that time, a single program that led to the doctorandus degree (or the ingenieur degree in the case of technical subjects) was in effect, which comprised the same course load as the Bachelor and Master programs put together. Those who had already started the doctorandus program could, upon completing it, opt for the doctorandus degree (before their name, abbreviated to 'drs.'; in the case of ingenieur, this would be 'ir.'), or simply use the master's degree (behind their name) in accordance with the new standard (so, 'MA' or 'MSc'). Because these graduates do not have a separate bachelor's degree (which is in fact ‚Äì in retrospect ‚Äì incorporated into the program), the master's degree is their first academic degree. Poland The Polish equivalent of Master of Arts is \\"magister\\" (its abbreviation \\"mgr\\" is placed before one's name, like dr). At the technical universities, one is awarded with in≈ºynier (engineer) after three years and then with \\"magister\\" after completing another two years of study and graduating. Such persons use titles \\"mgr in≈º\\". In the 1990s, the MA programs usually lasting 5 years were replaced by separate 3-year bachelor's and 2-year master's programs. The degree is awarded in the arts (literature, foreign languages, filmmaking, theatre etc.), natural sciences, mathematics, computer science fields, and economics. The completion of a research thesis is required. All master's degrees in Poland qualify for a doctorate program. Nordic countries In Finland, Denmark and Norway, the master's degree is a combined taught/research degree, awarded after 2 years of studies after completing the bachelor's degree. The student is required to write a scientific thesis. In Finland, this master's degree is called a filosofian maisteri (Finnish) or filosofie magister (Swedish) degree, and it is abbreviated as FM or \\"fil.mag.\\". In Sweden, there is still an intermediate degree between the Bachelor (kandidat) and Master called magister which only requires one year of studies, including a scientific thesis after completing the bachelor's degree. This fourth year typically constitutes the first half of Master programme. If not, it may be supplemented by a fifth year and a Master's thesis to obtain a master's degree in the field of study. United Kingdom and IrelandMost universities= The MA is typically a \\"taught\\" postgraduate degree, involving lectures, examination, and a dissertation based on independent research. Taught master's programs involve one or two years of full-time study. Many can be done part-time as well. Until recently, both the undergraduate and postgraduate master's degrees were awarded without grade or class (like the class of an honours degree). Nowadays, however, master's degrees are normally classified into the categories of Fail, Pass, Pass with Merit, or Pass with Distinction. This education pattern in the United Kingdom is followed in India and many Commonwealth Nations. The Master of Laws (LLM) is the standard degree taught for law, but certain courses may lead to MA, MLitt, Master of Studies (MSt), and the Bachelor of Civil Law (BCL) at Oxford. All of these degrees are considered substitutes to one another and are thus generally equivalent. =Scotland= In the ancient universities of Scotland, the degree of Master of Arts is awarded in universities as a four-year undergraduate degree, see Master of Arts (Scotland). The Master of Arts is awarded in arts, humanities, theology, and social sciences. However, some universities--particularly those in Scotland--award the Master of Letters (MLitt) to students in the arts, humanities, divinity, and social sciences. =Oxford, Cambridge, Dublin (conferred)= At Oxford, Cambridge and Dublin, the MA is conferred after a certain number of years without further examination to those who are Bachelors of Arts. The title of Master of Arts may also be awarded, in the case of the oldest British universities only, without further examination to those who have graduated as Bachelor of Arts and who have the requisite years' standing as members of the university or as graduates. This happens, in England, only at the universities of Oxford, four years after completing a bachelor's degree, and Cambridge, six years after the first term of study. It is also the case at the University of Dublin in Ireland. The abbreviated name of the university (Oxon, Cantab or Dubl) is therefore almost always appended in parentheses to the initials \\"MA\\" in the same way that it is to higher degrees, e.g. \\"John Smith, MA (Cantab), PhD (Lond)\\", principally so that it is clear (to those who are aware of the system) that these are nominal and unexamined degrees.Debretts Correct Form (2013 edn) - Academics The MLitt is a research degree at the University of Cambridge, where the Master of Philosophy (MPhil) is the name given to the standard one-year taught degree with a unique research element, in contrast to the use of MPhil at other institutions for a research degree. Confusion In February 2011, Labour MP for Nottingham East, Chris Leslie, sponsored a private member's bill in Parliament, the master's degrees (Minimum Standards) Bill 2010‚Äì12, in order to \\"prohibit universities awarding Master‚Äôs degrees unless certain standards of study and assessment are met\\". The Bill's supporters described the practice as a \\"historical anachronism‚Äù and argued that unearned qualifications should be discontinued in order to preserve the academic integrity of the taught MA. Further, they warned that the title gave Oxbridge graduates an unfair advantage in the job market. Research by the universities watchdog, the Quality Assurance Agency for Higher Education, in 2000, showed that two-thirds of employers were unaware that the Cambridge MA did not represent any kind of post-graduate achievement involving study. On 21 October 2011, the master's degrees (Minimum Standards) Bill 2010‚Äì12 received its second reading. The Bill failed to complete its passage through Parliament before the end of the session, meaning it made no further progress. =Oxford, Cambridge (earned)= A number of different master's degrees may be earned at Oxford and Cambridge. The most common, the Master of Philosophy (MPhil), is a two- year research degree. The Master of Science (MSc) and the Master of Studies (MSt) degrees each take one year. They often combine some coursework with research. The Master of Letters (MLitt) is a pure research master's degree. More recently, Oxford and Cambridge offer a Masters of Business Administration. Master's degrees are generally offered without classification, though the top five percent may be deemed worthy of Distinction. Both universities also offer a variety of four-year undergraduate integrated master's degrees such as MEng or MMath.  North America  In Canada and the United States, the Master of Arts (Magister Artium) and Master of Science (Magister Scienti√¶) are the basic graduate-level degrees in most subjects and may be course-based, research-based, or, more typically, a combination of the two. Admission to a master's program is normally contingent upon holding a bachelor's degree. Some programs provide for a joint bachelor's and master's after about five years.See, for example, the program run by Claremont Graduate University for graduates of the Claremont Colleges Some universities use the Latin degree names, such as Artium Magister (AM) or Scienti√¶ Magister (SM). For example, Harvard University, Dartmouth College, the University of Chicago, MIT, the University of Pennsylvania, and Brown University use the abbreviations AM and SM for some of their master's degrees. A Master of Arts may be given in a scientific discipline, common at Ivy League universities. Many universities offer Master of Arts programs, which are differentiated either as Thesis or Non-Thesis programs. Usually, the duration for a Non- Thesis option is one to two years of full-time study. The period for a Thesis option may last longer, depending also on the required level of courses and complexity of the thesis. Sometimes, qualified students who are admitted to a \\"very high research\\" Master of Arts might have to earn credits also at the PhD level, and they may need to complete their program in about three years of full-time candidature e.g. at the universities Harvard in the US and McGill in Canada. A thesis must be a distinct contribution to knowledge. It must demonstrate ability to plan and carry out research, organize results, and defend the approach and conclusions in a scholarly manner. The research presented must meet current standards of the discipline. Finally, the thesis must clearly demonstrate how the research advances knowledge in the field.

Both are produced by Forge World, a subsidiary company of Games Workshop. The Imperial Armour range and rules supplements are designed to incorporate vehicles referred to in the fiction and background material produced for the Warhammer 40,000 fictional universe, but not included in the Codexes due to a variety of reasons. These include super-heavy vehicles (such as the Imperial Baneblade), specialised variants of standard vehicles (such as Tau Empire Hammerhead Gunships modified to carry different turret weapon configurations), aircraft, immobile defenses, and non-combatant vehicles. Vehicles that are featured in the Imperial Armour books are available from Forge World as multi-part resin model kits, or as a series of resin components that can be used to convert existing plastic and metal models. The Imperial Armour range is not limited to conventional vehicles, as the Orks are known to use massive creatures called Squiggoths, and the Tyranids do not possess any vehicles, instead using extremely large bioformed creatures.

Today, only mounds remain. Fort G√∫ta was a fort near the town of G√∫ta (modern day Kol√°rovo) in what is today Slovakia. As of today, no archaeological excavations have been done on its site. The fort played a minor role during its history compared to the fortresses of two nearby cities, √ârsek√∫jv√°r and Kom√°rom (modern day Nov√© Z√°mky and Kom√°rno, respectively) had larger fortresses that played more important roles during past centuries. Specifically, the Siege of √ârsek√∫jv√°r in 1663 was a major event during the Austro-Turkish War, and the fortress of Kom√°rom was the last to resist Austrian and Russian forces during the Hungarian Revolution of 1848.  Description  The original castle from the 14th century was protected with two palisades. These wooden walls ran parallel to each other and were reinforced with wickers. The space between the palisades was filled with mud and dirt for reinforcement. For additional protection, a moat was constructed around the castle. History Fort G√∫ta was built where the Kol√°rovo castle stood before it. According to tradition, Mary, Queen of Hungary ordered that castle to be built around 1349 near the confluence of rivers V√°h and the Little Danube to protect fords and trade routes. However, Mary was born in 1371, 22 years later, and was crowned in 1382; therefore, it is more likely that the castle was either built decades later or it was built on orders from Mary's predecessor, Louis I. It has been repaired and renovated several times according to the period requirements. At the beginning of Turkish occupation the fortress was quickly repaired by the local captain Gregor Martonosi Pesth√©nyi in 1527, to protect it from the approaching army of John Z√°polya, supported by the Ottoman Empire. That year an army commander of Z√°polya, G√°sp√°r R√°skay drew into Guta and conquered the town. Soon afterwards, the fortress fell into the hands of the imperial Austrian army again. Between 1584-1594 the fortress was strengthened with the help of the Italian army engineers. At the time when Gabriel Bethlen was conquering the fortress in Kom√°rno, local Walloon and French soldiers escaped. After the Ottoman Army conquered nearby √ârsek√∫jv√°r in 1663, the Kingdom of Hungary, then part of the Habsburg Monarchy, decided to modernize the fort. In 1664, it was rebuilt in as a Baroque-style star fort with four triangular bastions. Between 1662-1664 being afraid of new attacks of Turks, the fortress was modernized again. Inside there were stone accommodation houses and stone stores for gunpowder and guns. At that time there were 130 mercenaries behind the walls under the command of Matej Fr√∂hwirtha. In the spring of 1707 at the time of the R√°k√≥czi uprising, the count Guido Starhemberg performed the fortification worth 6090 forints with the help of the army engineer Fischer. The kuruc general J√°nos Botty√°n stayed nearby the town for four times. On 12 July 1708 he conquered the fortress with the help of heavy artillery and captured local mercenaries. After fighting the fortress was destroyed and kuruc soldiers retreated with the words \\"Let it be the residence of frogs since now\\". Although the fortress was repaired later, its defamatory name B√©kav√°r (Frog castle) was preserved. Danish garrison was located there by general Heister. In the 1840s the fortress had no importance, only used once by the army of General Art√∫r G√∂rgei, which had a rest there after a lost battle.

It is located close to the Bremen Old Town on the \\"Culture Mile\\" (). The Kunsthalle was built in 1849, enlarged in 1902 by architect Eduard Gildemeister, and expanded several more times, most notably in 2011. Since 1977, the building has been designated a Kulturdenkmal on Germany's buildings heritage list. The museum houses a collection of European paintings from the 14th century to the present day, sculptures from the 16th to 21st centuries and a New Media collection. Among its highlights are French and German paintings from the 19th and 20th century, including important works by Claude Monet, √âdouard Manet and Paul C√©zanne, along with major paintings by Lovis Corinth, Max Liebermann, Max Beckmann and Paula Modersohn-Becker.

The first years of the association's activities were focused on private art exhibitions, with the acquisition of works backed financially from ticket proceeds and business donations. Ten years after its founding, the Society owned 13 paintings, 585 drawings and 3917 leaf prints. The majority of the paintings were Old Masters, including the famous Madonna of Masolino and a series of paintings of Dutch painters of the 17th Century, such as Jan van Goyen and Pieter Wouwerman. After 1843, large public exhibitions were organized in association with similar associations in Hannover, L√ºbeck, Greifswald, Rostock and Stuttgart. By 1846 the society had grown to 575 members.Geschicht: Die Anf√§nge (1823-1847) at Kunstverein Bremen retrieved 1 June 2012.Manya Ocken: The Kunstverein in Bremen in the 19th Century (University of Bonn, 1989).

History of the Kunsthalle  The building of 1849 = The Kunsthalle Bremen in 1849 Supported by numerous foundations and patrons, the Art Society put out a competitive bid for a new museum building. A then very young Lueder Rutenberg - himself a member of the Art Association - won against prominent competitors. The Society broke ground on the Kunsthalle on 1 July 1847, becoming the first Society in Germany with its own building. The construction project was located on a former rubbish dump in the vicinity of the old city ramparts and the building was finished in 1849. Rutenberg's design was of a dignified but understated two-story building with a three-axis central projection of round arches. While the collections were largely owned by the Kunstverein, the property itself was owned by the city. Four stone figures over the entrance are of Raphael, Michelangelo, D√ºrer, and Rubens, created by the sculptor Adolph Steinh√§user (1825-1858).Geschicht: Der Bau der Kunsthalle (1847-1849) at the Kunstverein Bremen retrieved 1 June 2012. = Expansion in 1902 = The Kunsthalle's new central hall in 1902, destroyed in World War II After another competition among Bremen architects, a much-needed enlargement was commissioned in 1898. Albert Dunkel was selected to design the interiors, Eduard Gildemeister for the monumental sandstone facade, and decoration by renowned sculptors Georg Roemer and Georg Wrba. The foundation work was begun in 1899 and on 15 February 1902 the opening ceremony took place. The facade was under construction until 1904. The expansion was funded by foundations and businessmen in Bremen.Geschichte: Der Erweiterungsbau der Kunsthalle (1899-1902)) at the Kunstverein Bremen retrieved 1 June 2012. = Consequences of World War II = Washington Crossing the Delaware (1849‚Äì50) by Emanuel Leutze was destroyed in an air raid on 5 September 1942 The art gallery was closed shortly after the outbreak of war and the collection was initially stored in the basement. In the night of 5 September 1942, a fire bomb destroyed the central staircase and six rooms upstairs. It also burned the painting Washington Crossing the Delaware by Emanuel Leutze, which because of its size could not be removed. Today a second version hangs in the Metropolitan Museum of Art in New York.Kunsthalle Bremen: Geschichte 1914-1945 online retrieved 3 June 2012. After this damage, large parts of the collection were moved to protected areas underneath the Bremer Landesbank and Norddeutschen Kreditbank. As the severity of air raids on Bremen increased, Mayor B√∂hmcker finally decreed that the collection should be housed outside the city in safety. The removal of the artworks began in 1943 to four different places: the paintings, drawings and graphic sheets were divided between Karnzow Castle of Count K√∂nigsmarck near Kyritz, Neum√ºhle Castle of Count von der Schulenburg in Salzwedel, and Schw√∂bber Castle near Hameln. The sculptures were taken to the princely crypt at B√ºckeburg Castle. Karnzow Castle was located in Margraviate of Brandenburg closer to Berlin and it held 50 paintings, 1715 drawings and about 3000 prints from the collection. The castle was taken in May 1945 by Soviet troops and on their return home it was plundered. The Soviets also left the hiding place open, with the result that works of art were within the reach of everyone. Berlin sculptor Kurt Reutti, head of a unit of the Berlin City Council, was able to find several items by extensive research and reclamation from the local black market. However, the losses of the Kunsthalle Bremen stand alongside those of the Prussian Cultural Heritage Foundation and the Dresden art collections as the largest and most devastating of any German museum from the war. In all over 1,500 works from the Kunsthalle remain missing today. = Reconstruction after 1945 = In the immediate postwar period, the conditions of the Museum and the activities of the Art Society were extremely difficult. Between 1947 and 1948, soldiers of the US Army were billeted in the art gallery, Print Room and Board Room. Because of war damage the building was unusable for displaying art, although exhibitions were organized at other locations starting in 1946. In 1948, ten rooms upstairs were again opened to the public for the 125th anniversary of the Art Society. After further repairs, all rooms on the upper floor were usable again by the end of 1951. In 1961 an extensive restoration was carried out which repaired the heavy war damage. The staircase and the front entrance were modernized in the style of the time. = Expansion in 1982 = An extension to the building was completed in 1982 by architect Werner D√ºttmann and caused a scandal. Contrary to the plans which had been approved in sandstone red brick facade was built instead. = Renovations 1990-1999 = In 1990 the Art Society secured financing for the renovation of the workshops, storage areas and the main Print Room of the now structurally and functionally obsolete building. Between 1996 and 1998, more renovations of the Art Gallery continued under the chairman Georg Abegg and director Wulf Herzogenrath. These were urgent because the exhibition halls were in poor condition, the lighting did not meet the requirements and climate conditions did not meet international standards. In 1995 the Art Society's board of trustees began a \\"Save the Art Gallery\\" capital campaign under the leadership of the merchant and deputy chairman Dieter Harald Bergh√∂fer, which reached out to patrons. Within one year it had received 7 million marks, a third of the calculated construction costs (in a city with fewer than 600,000 inhabitants). The state of Bremen and the Federal Republic then provided the other two thirds. Due to unexpected difficulties with the building, construction costs rose to almost 25 million DM, and these additional costs were raised solely by donors who wanted to support the efforts of the Art Society and the Board of Trustees. As a result of the renovation, golden oak parquet replaced the linoleum, while the 24 halls and intimate cabinets in which the permanent collection is grouped are bathed in color. =Extension 2011= Between 2009 and 2011, the older constructions of 1961 and 1982 were demolished and two modernist, cubic wings with of gross floor area were added to the old main building according to the plans by architects Hufnagel, Putz and Rafaelian. The main building with of gross floor area was completely renovated and portions modernized. The project cost around ‚Ç¨30 million. The families of Friedrich and Peter L√ºr√üen of L√ºrssen shipyard fame and the Karin and Uwe Hollweg Foundation contributed a third, and the city of Bremen and the Federal Government each one-third of these costs. Additional costs of ‚Ç¨3.5 million for among others things geothermal heating were covered by the art society.

Baldin Collection  In 1945 Soviet Army officer Viktor Baldin discovered the stored works from the Kunsthalle in the basement of Karnzow Castle. In order to protect them from complete destruction, he grabbed drawings by Rembrandt, Titian, Rubens, Goya, Van Gogh and √âdouard Manet and brought them to the Soviet Union in a suitcase. In 1963 Baldin became Director of the Moscow Architecture Museum. In the autumn of 1989 he visited the Bremen Kunsthalle and reported to the chairman of the Art Society that he had the time to get two paintings and 362 drawings out of Castle Karnzow and had handed them over to the Schtschusev State Research and Science Museum for safekeeping. In the following years he tried repeatedly to return the artwork to the Bremen Art Society by appealing to the highest authorities of the USSR, but without success. The whole issue of \\"looted art\\" from Germany was still taboo at that time. In 1995, a show named after him was held in the Hermitage collection in St. Petersburg. In February 2003, the then Russian Minister of Culture, after a formal request of the Kunstverein in 2000, provided a written commitment that the Baldin Collection should be returned to Bremen. Although the collection is not covered by the Plundered Art Laws, the Russian State Duma has so far refused to return it.

The 1891 Constitution, however, provided for a new election if the presidency or vice-presidency became vacant sooner than two years in office. The opposition then accused Floriano of staying as head of the nation illegally. Second revolt The second revolt started in March 1892, when thirteen generals sent a letter and manifesto to the President Marshal Floriano Peixoto. This document demanded new elections be called to fulfill the constitutional provision and ensure internal tranquility in the nation. Floriano harshly suppressed the movement, ordering the arrest of their leaders. Thus, not legally solved, the political tensions increased. The revolt broke out in September 1893 at Rio de Janeiro, and was suppressed only in March 1894 after a long blockade of the city. battleship Aquidaban bombarding the forts of Rio de Janeiro (drawing of Fouqueray, according to a photography, published in Le Monde Illustr√©, n¬∫ 1.916, 1893.). With many of the Brazilian Navy's most powerful ships either in the hands of the rebels or under repair, the Brazilian government had to improvise a new fleet to battle the rebel fleet. The \\"cardboard squadron\\" had to face off against a mutiny that had overtaken most of the powerful ships of the original navy. Local bloody conflicts in some regions of Brazil ensued. The navy's mutiny off Rio de Janeiro (Guanabara Bay) also was a challenge, and became linked to the Federalist Rebellion. Loyalist torpedo-boat destroyer Gustavo Sampaio The revolt included the powerful battleship Aquidaban and a collection of small ironclads, modern cruisers and older wood 'cruiser' or steam frigate type ships. Two of the navy's major ships were overseas and supposedly away from the conflict: the battleship Riachuelo was under repairs in France, and the corvette Barrozo was on a round-the world training voyage (during which she sank). This did not leave the government with much left to challenge the mutineers, who could have controlled the seas and influenced the concurrent conflicts on land. The government basically bought itself a new naval force on the open markets, of small and sometimes unusual ships including torpedo gunboats, various medium and small torpedo boats, small armed yachts, and a transport converted to carry a Zalinsky \\"dynamite gun\\" (a pneumatic gun launching a dynamite charge of massive explosive force and marginal accuracy). Such improvised stocking up was common at that time: the US pressed a similar mix of ships into action to supplement its fleet in the 1898 war with Spain (or to buy them before Spain could), and Japan also scrambled to purchase available ships for its conflict with Russia in 1904-5. In this case, however, the new fleet was dedicated to confronting the original navy of the same country. Details of conflict On September 13, the fortresses in Rio de Janeiro, held by the Army, began to be bombarded (Gazeta de Not√≠cias, September 14, 1893, under the title \\"The Revolt\\"). The rebel forces' fleet consisted of navy vessels and civilian vessels of Brazilian and foreign companies. In the Navy, the rebels were the majority, but faced strong opposition in the Army, where thousands of young people joined the battalions that supported President Floriano. State elites, especially Sao Paulo, were also in favor of Floriano. Army Fortresses Villegaignon and S√£o Jo√£o sink the Rebel Navy Monitor Javary. At dawn on December 1, Cust√≥dio de Mello, in Aquidab√£, followed by the Rep√∫blica and auxiliary cruisers, went south to join the federalists (O Paiz, December 2, 1893, under the title ‚ÄúThe Revolt‚Äù) . At the time was the Federalist Revolution, a dispute between the federalists (maragatos) and republicans (woodpeckers), the latter supported by Floriano. The Federalists The city of Desterro, as it was then called the capital of Santa Catarina, was dominated by the rebels. On December 7, Rear Admiral Luis Filipe Saldanha da Gama (1846 - 1895), then director of the Naval School, joined the movement, taking over the rebels in Rio de Janeiro, beginning the second phase of the Armada Revolt. By this time, the rebels had little ammunition and no food. The S√£o Jos√© Fortress, on Cobras Island, was practically destroyed by the loyalist troops and, on February 9, 1894, when the rebels, under the command of Saldanha da Gama, landed at Ponta da Arma√ß√£o, in Niter√≥i, were defeated.

Rare photo: Artillery fire exchange between the Rebel Battleship Aquidab√£ and the Army Fortress Villegaignon during the Battle of Guanabara Bay The federal government had acquired warships, which were dubbed the \\"cardboard fleet.\\" The command of this squadron was given to Admiral Jer√¥nimo Gon√ßalves (1835 - 1903), veteran of the Paraguayan War. In March 1894, with the support of the Army and the Paulista Republican Party (PRP), the Armada Revolt was stifled (The Paiz, March 14, 1894 and Gazeta de Not√≠cias, March 16, 1894). The rebels took refuge in the Portuguese ships Mindelo and Afonso de Albuquerque, ending the second phase of the revolt. The Federalist Revolution continued in the south, where Saldanha da Gama and his men were led. Cust√≥dio de Mello had taken the port of Paranagu√° and was united with the federalist leader Gumercindo Saraiva (1852 - 1894). They took the city of Lapa and the government troops moved south. On April 16, 1894, the battleship Aquidab√£ of the rebels was torpedoed in Santa Catarina by the torpedo Gustavo Sampaio, commanded by Lieutenant Altino Flavio de Miranda Correia (Gazeta de Not√≠cias, April 18, 1894, under the title ‚ÄúA Revolt\\").

It was constructed in the year 1848 under the orders of then collector of Malabar, H.V. Conolly initially to facilitate movement of goods to Kallayi Port from hinter lands of Malabar through Kuttiyadi and Korapuzha river systems. The construction was from 1848‚Äì50. The canal was built almost entirely by human labour at a time when no machinery was in place. The Canoly Canal connects various rivers and streams including the Korapuzha river in the north and the Kallai River in the south thus forming part of the line of water communication from Vadakara to Beypore.Illustrated Guide to the South Indian Railway 1926 Page 203 \\"The Conolly canal connects the Kallayi river with the Ellattur river and thus provides an uninterrupted line of water communication from Beypore to Vatakara, a distance of 37 miles ; the canal derives its name from Mr. Conolly, Collector of ...\\" The width of the canal varies between 6 and 20 metres (20 to 65 ft), and the water depth during the monsoon ranges between 0.5 and 2 metres (1.5 to 6 ft). This was the main waterway for the cargo movement between Kochi and Calicut, trade was the definition of the Canolly canal for more than a century. Major coastal towns such as Chavakkad, Ponnani and Kandassankadavu developed because of the freight trade along the canal. The main products of the coastal line, coconut oil and coconut fibre (Chakiri), were transported to Cochin by using \\"kettuvallam\\" (old house boat) through this canal. Many of the things in the once popular Chavakkadu Kuttakkunnu weekly market came through the Canolly Canal. Even the lives of ordinary people were associated with the canal. They used the water of cannoli for all purposes except drinking. The main dependence of the coastal settlers was for bathing and washing clothes. Fishing was also active in small ponds. The sides of most of the canal are lined with dimension stone, but at some locations the lining has collapsed. In a number of places along the canal, trees and bushes and water plants have grown, causing the water flow in the middle stretch of the canal to become weaker. The Canoly Canal Development Samithi in Kozhikode had decided to start speedboat service on the canal from Karaparamba to the Sarovaram park site in September 2009.  Course  The course of Canoly Canal from Kozhikkode to Kodungallur (Kottapuram) of around 170 km is today part of National Waterway 3 through the National Waterways Act, 2016. Its a part of 630 km long Western Coastal canal (WCC) project in Malabar Coast. * The Northern extend of Canoly Canal is Vatakara near the mouth of Kuttiady river. * From there it takes the course of Kuttiyadi river upstream till Thurayur or Payyoli Cherppu. (5 km further upstream on Kuttiady river at Cherandathur, the Vadakara- Mahe canal projects starts. Once that project materialises, Canoli Canal will have navigable access further north up to Mah√©, India) * At Thurayur the canal takes a man made course up till Akalappuzha backwaters. From Akalapuzha through east of Koyilandy town the Canoli Canal take the course of various channels of Korapuzha river system. * Canoli canal leaves the Korapuzha system and enters its man-made urban stretch at Eranhikkal near Elathur, Kozhikode. From there the canal travels next 11.5-km through Kozhikode city till it reaches Kallayi River. During its course through this stretch the canal is severely encroached and polluted. There had been lot of revival projects around 2017. The famous Sarovaram Bio Park is along this stretch. In city Canoli canal travel through areas such as Kunduparamba, Karaparamba, Eranhipalam, Arayidathupalam Junction, Puthiyara, Mooriyad and Mankavu.The Mini Bypass road of Kozhikode city traverse nearly parallel to the Canoli Canal. * From Kallayi river near Mankavu canal begins its southward extension. This man made stretch of canal joining Chaliyar and Kallai River passes through Olavanna Cheruvannur Nallalam and at Kolathara the canal meets Chaliyar river. * In Chaliyar river the canal travels downstream till Chaliyam-Beypore port through Feroke and then from Beypore it takes upstream of another channel on Chaliyar river drainage system through Karuvanthuruthy and Mannoor tiil Kallaampara. *From Kallaampara, Canoli canal then takes a man made channel of 2 km into Kadalundi River system by joining it near Athanickal which is 1.5 km upstream of Kottakadavu bridge (This bridge is an important landmark it connects Parappanangadi with Chaliyam and Feroke. Before this bridge coming into being water transport was the easiest way to get to Beypore from Parappanangadi. Down stream of this bridge comes the famous mangrove system that houses Kadalundi Bird Sanctuary. *The canal then continues for the next 25 km of its course through Kadalundi River till Poorapuzha that's 3 km north of Tanur. In this journey the initial 19 km is upstream till Chuzhali through the main distributary of Kadalundi river that forms river mouth near Kadalundi town. From Chuzhali the next 6 km of the course is through down stream in another distributary of Kadalundi river that form river mouth near Ottumpuram bridge. *Next 18 km is one of the most longest man-made stretch of the canal. It begins from near Pariyapuram on Kadalundi River and ends at Tirur puzha near Koottayi, Tirur. This stretch passes through western side of Tanur. There's heavy siltation, waste dumping, encroachments and presence of numerous low lying cross structures along this reach of the canal. *The canal then goes southwards through Tirur puzha from Koottayi for the next 8 km till it meets the mouth of Bharathappuzha at Ponnani At this area the course of Canoli canal meets the course of TS Canal. From Ponnani to Kodungallur they both along with National Waterway 3 share the same course. *From Ponnani the canal travel through an artificial channel for 4.5 km till it meets Biyyam Kayal near Puthuponnani. *After travelling 1 km through Biyyam Kayal, the canal again starts its man-made stretch, the longest stretch of all for a length of 29 km unill it meets Chettuva Backwater. In this stretch the canal pass through Chavakkad. In past access to the canal brought huge trade and allied developments for Chavakkad market. **South of Chavakkad the canal begins to enter the Northern Kole Wetlands region. Kole Wetlands is a Ramsar site, that is one of the rice bowls of Kerala along with Kuttanad and Palakkad. **Kole Wetlands are fed primarily by Karuvannur River (also called as Puzhakkal River, Thannikudam river etc.) and Keecheri River. The Biyyam kayal and Kanjiramukku rivers forms its northern boundary, Chalakudy River forms its southern boundaries and Canoli canal flows through its western boundary *From Chettuva Backwater the canal enters into a series of natural courses through the Kole region of Thrissur. The initial stretch is it travels for 6 km through upstream of Northern distributary of Karuvannur River from Chettuva Backwater till it reaches Enamakkal Lake. *From Enamakkal Lake the canal travels down stream of the Southern distributary of Karuvannur River and other rivulets through Kole region for almost 45 km until it meets Periyar (river) near Kodungallur. **In this stretch 4 km south of Enamakkal Lake the canal reaches Kandassankadavu. This area was also economically benefitted a lot because of trade and freight movement that happened through Canoli canal in the past. **Almost 25 km south of Kandassankadavu near Padiyoor, there is a small canal from Canoli canal towards Irinjalakuda town. * * The southern extend of Canoly Canal is Kodungallur where it meets the Periyar (river) system and Kottapuram - Kollam stretch of National Waterway 3.

Burns (born 21 February 1958) is a former Australian rules footballer who played for St Kilda. Burns was a tough and uncompromising centreman, who won St Kilda best and fairest twice, in 1984 and again in 1986. He was often one of the few shining lights for the Saints during the club's run of four wooden spoons from 1983 until 1986. His fierce determination to win the ball out of the middle became a trademark and would often stand out in physical contests among opposition of a higher calibre, especially in games at Moorabbin among the often muddy and wet conditions. He made only one appearance - his first in the VFL - in 1978, before playing a further 59 games over the next four years for just 12 wins. In 1983, Burns established himself as the Saints best midfielder, racking up 20 games and 492 possessions (average of 24.6 per game) - an increase on his 261 possessions the season before. Only in 1987, aged 29, did Burns collect more touches of the football in his career during a 21-game, 506 disposals season. He utilised the handball more in this, his tenth seasons in the VFL, handpassing it 202 times, 68 more than any other season.http://afltables.com/afl/stats/players/G/Greg_Burns.html Burns, who shunned the limelight to bigger names at St Kilda, retired in 1989.

Tree shelters are also sometimes known as Tuley tubes or tree tubes. The purpose of tree shelters is to protect young trees from browsing by herbivores by forming a physical barrier along with providing a barrier to chemical spray applications. Additionally, tree tubes accelerate growth by providing a mini-greenhouse environment that reduces moisture stress, channels growth into the main stem and roots and allows efficient control of weeds that can rob young seedlings of soil moisture and sunlight. Tree shelters were invented in Scotland in 1979 by Graham Tuley (Lantagne 1997). They are particularly popular in the UK in landscape-scale planting schemes and their use has been established in the United States since 2000. About 1 million shelters were in use in the United Kingdom in 1983‚Äì1984 (Tuley 1985), and 10 million were produced in 1991 (Potter 1991). Many variations of tree shelters exist. There is considerable debate among tree shelter manufacturers as to the ideal colour, size, shape and texture for optimal plant growth. One style used in northern climates of North America has a height of 5 feet to offer the best protection from deer browse, with vent holes in the upper portion of the tube to allow for hardening off of hardwood trees going into the winter months and no vent holes in the lower portion to shield seedlings from herbicide spray and rodent damage. Studies have shown the positive effects of Tree shelters. Not only do they prevent browse from herbivores. They create a mini greenhouse effect that provides stronger growth. Tree Shelters can provide 100% - 200% additional growth vs unprotected trees. Economics Tree shelters must be assessed alongside alternatives such as fencing to keep animals out, loss if no shelter is employed and visual impacts. References * * Potter, M. J.

PAYGW is sometimes known as \\"Income Tax Withholding (ITW),\\" PAYGI is sometimes known as \\"Income Tax Instalments (ITI)\\". The ATO forwards to each registered business before the end of each reporting period a BAS tailor-made for the business entity. The BAS may be delivered to the business as a paper form, electronically or via the business‚Äôs registered tax agent. Parts of the BAS may be pre-filled. Related to the BAS is the Instalment Activity Statement (IAS), which is used by taxpayers who are not registered for the GST, but have other tax obligations. An IAS is also used by entities that prepare a quarterly BAS but are required to remit their PAYG withholding tax on a monthly basis. The business activity statement reporting system was introduced in 2000 as a part of a major tax reform, which also included the introduction of the goods and services tax (GST). The various forms and reporting methods have changed considerably since the initial introduction of the BAS. Types There are a number of different BAS forms which an organisation can complete. The form which a business receives depends on what tax liabilities it has, referred to as roles. BASs are usually issued quarterly, some roles can be reported at different frequencies depending on the business structure and income. Some roles such as GST can be reported annually, subject to eligibility criteria being met.So BAS is a required statement. Frequency Activity statements are usually required to be submitted quarterly, but some entities may be required to report obligations on a more frequent basis. Some entities may be required to report PAYG Withholding liabilities or GST on a monthly basis. Operations Every activity statement carries a unique document identification number (DIN). Activity statements can be submitted to the ATO on paper (mail), by phone, electronically (via a Tax Agent's electronic lodgment system or \\"ELS\\"), or through the ATO business portal. Activity statements are processed by the Australian Taxation Office through its operations sub-plan. Any errors which occur with activity statements are usually handled by a department known as activity statement product (exceptions {ASP(E)}). ASP(E) operates under the operations sub-plan, client account services (CAS) business service line (BSL). Errors may occur when a business client reports figures incorrectly, where a client includes cent figures (only dollar figures are allowable), where an arithmetic error occurs, when a statement is submitted when no roles are active for the client, or when the handwriting on a paper statement is illegible.

Amongst his pupils were Michel Natalis and Gilles Rousselet. Some of his better known engravings are of Annibale Carracci's The Holy Family, Pietro da Cortona's Adoration of the Shepherds, and Rubens' Meleager. According to Houbraken he traveled to Rome, where he made prints of many Italian paintings.

Before his rise to kingship, he served as a commander of Vonones of Sakastan, who had minted coins with his name and that of another commander, Spalahores, who are both referred to as \\"brother of the king\\". Scholars such as R.C. Senior and Khodadad Rezakhani consider Spalirisos and Spalahores to indeed be Vonones' brothers, while others such as K.W. Dobbins argue that it was an honorific title given to them, whom he considered to be Saka satraps. A major argument against the proposal of a blood relationship between Vonones and the two commanders was due to both of them having Saka names, contrary to Vonones' Parthian name. Saghi Gazerani has suggested that after the Arsacid re-conquest of Sakastan (sometime between 124‚Äì115 BC), which was given as a fiefdom to the Surenid general that led the expedition, the Surenids (who became independent after 88 BC) and Sakas became closely connected, presumably through alliances and intermarriages. Indeed, Parthians and Sakas are often mixed up in Indian literature. The mythological Iranian hero Rostam (who was from Sakastan), is mentioned in Iranian traditions as both Parthian and Saka, thus supporting this dual-identity.

The RACGP is responsible for maintaining standards for quality clinical practice, education and training, and research in Australian general practice. The RACGP represents over 40,000 members across metropolitan, urban, rural and remote Australia. The RACGP develops resources and guidelines, advocates for GPs on issues that affect their practice, and develop standards that general practices use to ensure high quality healthcare.  Organisation = The President and Board  The RACGP is governed by the RACGP Board. The RACGP Broad comprises: * Chair * President *Vice President *Censor-in-Chief *The Chair of each state/territory Council *Chair of RACGP Rural *Chair of RACGP Specific Interests *Chair of RACGP Aboriginal and Torres Strait Islander Health *Chair of the Finance Audit and Risk Management Committee *General Practice Registrar Representative *Any additional Board members co-opted by RACGP Board permitted under the RACGP Constitution.  Faculties  There are nine faculties within the RACGP, representing different geographical regions and special interest groups. Six geographical faculties serve the needs of members practising in their respective regions; Western Australia, Victoria, Queensland, Tasmania, South Australia & Northern Territory, and New South Wales & Australian Capital Territory. RACGP Rural supports and advocates for GPs working in rural and remote communities across Australia. RACGP Aboriginal and Torres Strait Islander Health was formed as part of the RACGP's commitment to raising awareness of Aboriginal and Torres Strait Islander health needs, and therefore to help 'close the gap'. RACGP Specific Interests was established in 2008 to recognise the additional interest and expertise held by GPs in selected areas of general practice. RACGP Specific Interests facilitates GP members practising in these areas to promote the area of specific interest and to share and develop related knowledge and materials.  Membership  The RACGP has more than 40,000 members working in or towards a career in general practice across Australia and internationally.  Categories of membership  The categories of membership are: * Fellow - GPs who have successfully completed all RACGP Fellowship assessment requirements, have satisfied the RACGP Board of their competence through training and/or experience, and who hold current Australian medical registration. *Member - medical practitioners who have five years specialist registration with AHPRA, five years consecutive participation in the QI&CPD; program and two referees, both of whom must be a financial Fellow or Member of the RACGP. *Associate - registered medical practitioners who are not Fellows or 'full' Members. *Registrar Associate - general practice registrars who are participating in general practice vocational training. *Student - medical students who are currently enrolled in an undergraduate or graduate course approved by an Australian medical school, including a Bachelor of Medicine or a Bachelor of Biomedical Science.  Fellowship and examinations = Fellowship of the RACGP  RACGP Fellowship is the admission to the specialty of general practice. It is an important recognition from the RACGP and the profession of general practice, and represents excellence in general practice. In 1996, the Australian Government adopted Fellowship of the RACGP (FRACGP) as the standard for certifying competence to deliver unsupervised general practice services in any general practice setting in Australia ‚Äì urban, regional, rural or remote. Fellowship of the RACGP allows GPs to: * Work unsupervised in general practice * Claim A1 Medicare rebates * Use the post nominal 'FRACGP'  FRACGP exams  The RACGP Fellowship exam consists of three segments; applied knowledge test (AKT), key feature problems (KFP) and objective structured clinical exam (OSCE). The exams are delivered in various locations across Australia and the conjoint Fellowship is delivered in Hong Kong and Malaysia. Passing of each component of the RACGP Fellowship exam is the usual way GPs become eligible to apply for their FRACGP.  Practice Experience Program  The RACGP's Practice Experience Program (PEP) is a self-directed education program designed to support non-vocationally registered (non-VR) doctors on their pathway to RACGP Fellowship. The PEP aims to provide targeted educational support for non-VR doctors (primarily international medical graduates (IMGs)) to help them to prepare for the RACGP exams and to deliver quality general practice care to their patients.  Quality improvement and continuing professional development = QI&CPD; program  The RACGP quality improvement and continuing professional development (QI&CPD;) program supports Australian GPs to provide the best possible care for patients. It does this by recognising ongoing education and promoting the development and maintenance of general practice skills and lifelong learning. Medicare Australia requires all GPs who access any Medicare program or service to participate and complete all requirements of a recognised CPD program. In the absence of fellowship of any of the specialty colleges, a GP will typically take up participation of the QI&CPD; program in order to satisfy medical registration requirements with the Australian Health Practitioner Regulation Agency (AHPRA), the national medical registration body. Participation in the QI&CPD; program is not equivalent to Fellowship of the RACGP.  Advocacy  The RACGP advocates for GPs and general practice, promoting the importance of patient safety, quality care, coordination of care, whole patient care, better recognition and reward for GPs, and investment into primary healthcare infrastructure, teams, training, and technology. The breadth of the RACGP's work is reflected by its various advocacy efforts.  Publications and events = Australian Journal of General Practice  The RACGP publishes the Australian Journal of General Practice (AJGP), Australia's only peer-reviewed scholarly journal for GPs. All articles are subject to a peer-review process before they are accepted for publication. The journal is indexed in MEDLINE, Index Medicus and Science Citation Index Expanded.  Standards  The RACGP has developed and published the Standards for general practice since July 1996. The current edition is the RACGP Standards for general practice (5th edition), which launched in October 2017. The Australian Commission on Safety and Quality in Health Care administers the National General Practice Accreditation (NGPA) Scheme, which supports the consistent accreditation assessment of Australian general practices against the RACGP Standards for general practices.  newsGP  newsGP combines clinical articles directly relating to the treatment of patients with professional articles on policy, procedures or managing a practice. newsGP covers news from the RACGP, explaining position statements and advocacy efforts. newsGP features articles, profiles and opinion pieces.  Guidelines and resources  The RACGP develops guidelines and resources on health issues and topics to support GPs and general practices in delivering patient care.  Events  Each year the RACGP holds an annual conference in a different location around Australia. The 2018 conference was held on the Gold Coast from 11‚Äì13 October under the theme General Practice: The centre of health in Australia and was attended by over 2000 delegates. The RACGP annual conference is an opportunity for GPs and other healthcare professionals to discuss various educational themes, attend clinical workshops and research presentations, and network with one another to support their professional development. The various faculties and departments of the RACGP host many educational and collegial events throughout the year, including fellowship ceremonies, awards nights, workshops and seminars.  History of general practice in Australia and beyond  Prior to the mid 20th century, upon graduation Australian doctors spent time in general practice. A medical career usually included completing an intern year immediately after graduation as a resident in a major teaching hospital. After a period of time in general practice, some doctors would seek specialist qualifications. Possibly reflecting the historical origins of Australia as a series of British colonies, these doctors would travel overseas, most often to the UK, to specialise and then return to establish practice.Bollen M Saltman D, \\"A history of general practice\\", general practice in Australia (2000): Commonwealth of Australia. As the Australian population grew post World War II, the public hospital system also grew demanding an increasing number of specialists. Local training program emerged and therefore the ability of a doctor to enter specialist training directly following the mandatory intern year post graduation without entering general practice. This increasing number of specialists made it increasingly difficult for general practitioners in Australia to hold and retain public hospital appointments, especially in procedural areas such as surgery or obstetrics. This was not a uniquely Australian phenomenon. Worldwide, medical practice was shifting focus onto hospitals with the expansion of pharmaceuticals and medical and surgical interventions. In the United States, the number of doctors identifying as general practitioners fell markedly between 1931 and 1974 from 83% to 18%. This process began as specialisation increased prior to the War. US GPs increasingly felt that health care was becoming fragmented and weakening doctor patient relationships. > \\"There are 57 different varieties of specialist to diagnose and treat 57 > different varieties of disease but no physician to take care of the > patient.\\" Development of professional colleges In 1950, an Australian Graduate, Dr Joseph Collings, conducted a review of general practice in the UK. This 30-page report was published in the Lancet in 1950.Collings J, General Practice in England Today: a reconnaissance. Lancet 1950;i:555-85. > \\"There are no real standards for general practice. What a doctor does and > how he does it depends entirely on his own conscience\\" Dr Collings, 1950. Dr Collings' report was scathing and generated immediate and heated interest. It was undoubtedly a key event in the definition of general practice as a \\"speciality.\\"Petchey R, Colling report on General Practice in England in 1950: unrecognised, pioneering piece of British social research? BMJ 1995;311:40‚Äì42 (1 July) He identified that general practice has no academic underpinning, no evidence upon which to base practice and no consistency of practice. The report did not pull punches. He described rural practice is \\"an anachronism\\", suburban practice is a \\"casualty-clearing\\" service and Inner city practice is \\"at best‚Ä¶ very unsatisfactory and at worst a positive source of public danger\\". There is a direct link between the public criticism of general practice and the move to create a College. Dr Rose and Dr Hunt in the BMJ 1950 write: > \\"There is a College of Physicians, a College of Surgeons, a College of > Obstetricians and Gynaecologists, a College of Nursing, a College of > Midwives and a college of Veterinary Surgeons, all of them Royal Colleges; > there is a College of Speech Therapists and a College of Physical Education, > but there is no college or academic body to represent primarily the > interests of the largest group of medical personnel in this country ‚Äì the > 20,000 general practitioners\\".Rose, F, Hunt J, College of General Practice. > BMJ 1951;ii;908 There was opposition in the UK to the creation of a College by the existing three Medical Colleges ‚Äì Colleges of Surgeons, Physicians and Obstetricians and Gynaecologists ‚Äì who held the belief that general practice should be a joint faculty of general practice linked to the existing Colleges.Hunt J, A history of the Royal College of General Practitioners. 1983. Churchill London. However, put into perspective, in the same document Hunt describes the two original British Colleges sought to stop the creation of the College of Obstetricians and Gynaecologists via legal action in 1929. The development of the Australian College of General Practitioners The British College of General Practitioners was formed in 1953 with many Australian doctors amongst the founding members including the RACGP's first president Dr William Conolly, again reflecting the origins of Australia as a series of British colonies, established a New South Wales faculty of the BCGP. This was followed by the creation of other state based faculties of the British College of General Practitioners in Queensland, Western Australia, Tasmania, Victoria and South Australia over the next 5 years. In keeping with the process for creating Medical Colleges under the British system, a group of Australian General Practitioners met in 1957 at the first Annual Scientific Convention in Sydney to declare an intention to form the Australian College of General Practitioners (ACGP) which was formally founded in 1958. This new College joined the state based faculties. State based faculties remain a key part of the modern day function of the RACGP. Recognition of general practice as a medical specialty In modern Australia, general practice is listed by the AMC as a medical specialty and the RACGP as the specialist college responsible for assessment, as endorsed by the Medical Board of Australia inaugurated in 2010. Yet, on further examination of how general practice is considered across the nation, some of the now-defunct state-based Medical Practitioners' Boards such as Victoria, Queensland and South Australia, did not consider general practice a medical specialty and general practice qualifications, such as the Fellowship of the Royal Australian College of General Practitioners (FRACGP) were not registerable qualifications. The practical implication of the nationalisation of medical registration on the status of general practice as a medical specialty may be unclear. The oddity of general practice in Australia is a lingering and arguably outdated perception that the decision to practise as a GP has low or no standing and status. Comments heard by many GPs including; 'You are just a GP' or 'What do you intend on specialising in?‚Äô reflect something of the community understanding of the general practitioner. This is not without precedent. The history of the general practitioner shows that GPs in early Australia through to GPs in mid and late 20th century, 'defaulted' into general practice having disliked surgical or physician training or having failed exit exams too often. Also, while Australian general practitioners were part of the creation of the Royal College of General Practitioners and instrumental in highlighting the need for professional and practice standards, Australia was one of the last developed countries to recognise general practice as a specialty. It was 1978 before the National Specialist Qualification Advisory Committee (the predecessor to the Australian Medical Council) recognised general practice as a specialty.'NSQAC Regulations', National Specialist Qualification Advisory Committee, 1978, Australia. In contrast, the United Kingdom had a powerful case for recognition by the late 1960s, and the United States recognised general practice in 1969. =Strengthening general practice= The standing of general practice within academic faculties of universities and professionally has undergone a marked increase in recent decades. The RACGP has been a key driver of this shift. The development and consolidation of training programs, standards for training, standards for practice, curriculum of general practice and various evidence based guidelines and publications have occurred internally within the RACGP. Academic general practice Demonstrating again the slow shift towards recognition, Australia was late in accepting that general practice should be taught or regarded as a discipline in its own right. The Whitlam government's Karmel committee into 'Expansion of Medical Education in Australia' compromised with departments of 'community medicine' ‚Äì a confusing anachronism that persisted for many years in Australia's tertiary institutions.Karmel P. Report of the Committee on Medical Schools to the Australian Universities Commission. Expansion of Medical Education. Canberra: AGPS, 1973. The RACGP sought strongly but unsuccessfully that this committee accept general practice into the universities. Today, general practice is listed or has been added alongside community medicine, highlighting the shift since the early 1970s (e.g. Department of General Practice and Community Medicine Monash University) Nine foundation professors of 'Community Practice' were appointed between 1974 and 1976. Again, Australia lagged behind the US and the UK who appointed their first professors and chairs of general practice and family medicine in 1967 and 1963 respectively.Kamien M, A patience of professors.

Ultimately the tour could be considered a success for England in cricketing terms, as they came back from 2‚Äì0 down to draw the series 2‚Äì2 against strong opposition. However the tour had its problems, both on and off the field. The West Indians were disappointed by the English party's reluctance to socialise and the defensive nature of much of their cricket. The English players were dissatisfied with the quality of some of the umpiring. There was crowd trouble at two of the Tests. Lock was called for throwing in the first Test. English team The team of 16 selected by MCC for the tour was arguably the strongest available and the first England touring team in modern times to be led by a professional captain. The team was: * Leonard Hutton, captain * Charles Palmer, player/manager * Trevor Bailey * Denis Compton * Godfrey Evans, wicketkeeper * Tom Graveney * Jim Laker * Tony Lock * Peter May * Alan Moss * Dick Spooner, wicketkeeper * Brian Statham * Ken Suttle * Fred Trueman * Johnny Wardle * Willie Watson Only Palmer, Moss and Suttle had not played Test cricket before the tour, and only Suttle did not play in any of the Tests on the tour. West Indian team The West Indies had played a home five-Test series against the Indians early in 1953, winning the series by 1‚Äì0 with four matches drawn. Of the team that played India, Allan Rae had retired and wicketkeeper Ralph Legall was not chosen for any of the Tests against England. The following existing Test players were selected in the sides to play England: * Jeff Stollmeyer, captain * Robert Christiani * Gerry Gomez * Frank King * Bruce Pairaudeau * Sonny Ramadhin * Alf Valentine * Clyde Walcott * Everton Weekes * Frank Worrell In addition, four players who had played in earlier Test series were recalled: * Denis Atkinson * Wilfred Ferguson * George Headley * Esmond Kentish The West Indies introduced four players new to Test cricket during the series: * Michael Frederick * John Holt (Jr) * Cliff McWatt, wicketkeeper * Garfield Sobers Test series summary Five Test matches were played. The West Indies won the first two, England the third. The fourth match was left drawn after six days and England won the fifth and final match to draw the series. First Test The West Indies introduced three new players ‚Äì Frederick, Holt and McWatt ‚Äì and recalled Headley and Kentish. In so doing, Headley became the oldest cricketer to play for West Indies. With consistent batting, West Indies made 417, with five players reaching 50 and Holt top-scoring with 94. After Holt was out, adjudged lbw, the wife and son of the umpire, Perry Burke, were attacked in the crowd, though they were not seriously hurt. England's reply was woeful, Ramadhin and Valentine taking seven wickets in a total of 170 all out. West Indies captain Stollmeyer was booed by the crowd for not enforcing the follow-on, and he declared at 209 for six wickets, setting England 457 to win. At 277 for two, with Watson making a century, the game looked even. But England lost seven wickets for eight runs and were all out for 316, Kentish taking five wickets for 49 runs. Lock was no-balled for throwing, the first such instance in a Test match since Ernie Jones at Melbourne for Australia against England in 1897‚Äì98. Second Test Walcott scored 220 out of a first-innings total of 383. England then batted painfully slowly, taking 150 overs to make 181 runs. Stollmeyer again did not enforce the follow-on: Holt made a maiden Test century, 166 out of a total of 292 for two declared. Needing 495 to win, England reached 258 for three before another collapse left them all out for 313. Third Test England batted first and made 435 through Hutton's 169 and consistent batting from the others. Though Weekes made 94 and McWatt and the injured Holt added 99 for the eighth wicket, West Indies were all out for 251. The crowd threw bottles and other objects when McWatt was adjudged run out, but Hutton refused to take his players from the pitch. Following on, West Indies fared little better, scoring 256 and leaving England just 73 to win. Moss, who made his debut in the first Test, took five wickets. Fourth Test On a batsman's wicket, the sides took the first five days to complete the first two innings. West Indies' 681 for eight declared was the highest score by a West Indies cricket team: Weekes made 206, Worrell 167 and Walcott 124. England made 537 in reply, with centuries from May and Compton and 92 from Graveney. The game petered out on the sixth day. Fifth Test West Indies, winning the toss, were bowled out for 139 on what had appeared to be a perfect pitch for batting. Bailey took seven wickets for 34 runs, his best Test return. England's reply of 414 was based on a double century for Hutton and some later hitting by Wardle. Facing arrears of 275, West Indies lost wickets consistently, and though Walcott made his third century of the series, England needed just 72 to win. The match was the Test debut of Sobers, aged 17: he scored 14 not out and 26 and took four wickets. Other matches The MCC team played five first-class matches, winning against Jamaica, Barbados, British Guiana (Guyana) and Trinidad and drawing a second match against Jamaica. * In the match against Barbados, in which MCC recorded their first victory for 50 years, Suttle top-scored in both MCC innings, but still failed to be picked for the Tests. He never played for England. * In the match against British Guiana, Watson scored 257 and Graveney 231 as MCC made 607. Their fourth wicket stand of 402 is, as of 2012, the 14th highest of all fourth wicket partnerships in first-class cricket. In minor matches, MCC won one and drew two in Bermuda, won one and drew one in Jamaica, beat the Leeward Islands and drew with the Windward Islands, the latter two teams not being first-class in 1954. Issues arising from the tour Wisden Cricketers' Almanack 1955 edition reported that the tour was beset by controversy. Billed as a kind of world championship, the Test series was subject to much partisanship on the part of both West Indians and English expatriates; umpiring decisions added to the controversy, with the MCC team feeling hard done by over several decisions by local umpires and the crowds reacting with violence over two decisions that went England's way in the First and Third Tests. Wisden recommended that the West Indies draw up a panel of umpires from all the countries rather than using local umpires in each match. But it also had harsh words for England players whose dissent was made public, and also for the excessive caution of the England team in the Second Test. The experiment of using a player-manager on a controversial tour, Wisden said, was also \\"not to be commended\\".

These French colonists had established themselves in 1555 at Guanabara Bay in Rio de Janeiro, in a settlement known as France Antarctique. He was the founder of Rio de Janeiro, now the second largest city in Brazil.

Fico also previously served as a Prime Minister from 4 July 2006 to 8 July 2010. He has been the leader of the Direction ‚Äì Social Democracy (SMER-SD) party since 1999. First elected to Parliament in 1992 (whilst within Czechoslovakia), he was later appointed to the Council of Europe. Following his party's victory in the 2006 parliamentary election, he formed the first Fico Cabinet. After the 2010 parliamentary election, Fico sat as an opposition member of parliament, effectively as leader of the opposition. Following a motion of confidence against the Iveta Radiƒçov√° cabinet, Fico was re-appointed as Prime Minister after leading SMER-SD to a landslide election victory in the 2012 parliamentary election, winning 83 seats and forming a government with an absolute majority in Parliament, the first such since 1989. In 2013, Fico officially declared his candidacy for the 2014 presidential election. Fico lost the election to his political rival Andrej Kiska in the second round of voting on 29 March 2014. On 15 March 2018, in the wake of the political crisis following the murder of J√°n Kuciak, Fico delivered his resignation to President Andrej Kiska, who then formally charged Deputy Prime Minister Peter Pellegrini with the formation of a new government.  Early life  Fico was born on 15 September 1964, in the town of Topoƒæƒçany in the southwestern Nitra Region. His father, ƒΩudovit Fico, was a forklift operator, and his mother, Emilie Ficov√°, worked in a shoe store. He has two siblings; his brother Ladislav is a construction entrepreneur, and his sister Lucia Chabadov√°, who is fourteen years younger, is a prosecutor. Fico grew up and lived with his family in the village of Hru≈°ovany, until the age of six, when they moved to the nearby town of Topoƒæƒçany.  Education  Fico has described his childhood ambitions as wanting to become either a politician, a sports reporter, or an archeologist. After completing elementary school, he enrolled in the local Gymnasium of Topoƒæƒçany, graduating in the summer of 1982. Later the same year he enrolled in the Law Faculty of the Comenius University in Bratislava, in what was then Czechoslovakia. His teachers were impressed with him, and one of his teachers from university, the future prime minister Jozef Moravƒç√≠k, described him as \\"ambitious, very confident and very involved in discussions.\\" He graduated as juris doctor in 1986 specializing in criminal law. After graduating from university, Fico completed his mandatory military service as an assistant military investigator, stationed in the (now-Czech) town of Janovice between 1986 and 1987. He later worked for the Institute of State and Law of the Slovak Academy of Sciences, as well as with the Justice Ministry until 1992. During this period he wrote and completed his PhD degree, with a thesis on \\"The death penalty in Czechoslovakia.\\" In 2002 he completed his postgraduate study, earning him the title of associate professor.  Early political career  Fico joined the Communist Party of Czechoslovakia in 1987, having applied in 1984. After the Velvet Revolution of 1989, and the collapse of the communist regime in Czechoslovakia, Fico joined the Party of the Democratic Left (SDƒΩ), a successor of the Communist Party of Slovakia. He was first elected as a Member of Parliament in 1992. From 1994 to 2000 Fico represented Slovakia as its legal counsel at the European Court of Human Rights but lost all 14 cases which he handled. In 1998 he was elected deputy chairman of the party. Later the same year, Fico ran for the post of general prosecutor, but his party endorsed another candidate instead, arguing Fico was too young. In the 1998 elections that saw the fall of the government of Vladim√≠r Meƒçiar, Fico received the biggest number of preferential votes among his party colleagues. A year later, when support for the SDƒΩ dropped below the threshold required to get into parliament, he left the party, saying he was disappointed with the way the government worked. Fico acted as an independent MP until the 2002 elections. As early as in the autumn of 1998, a four-person group consisting of Fico, his associate Frantisek Hat√°r, political strategist Fedor Fla≈°√≠k, and media executive Monika Fla≈°√≠kov√°-Be≈àov√° had begun to discuss and lay plans for launching a new political party on the left. These plans were driven by the falling popularity of the existing parties, and the rising popularity of Fico. Almost immediately after leaving SDƒΩ, the group founded Direction ‚Äì Social Democracy (SMER), which Fico first labelled a party of the third way, with himself as leader. Fico established himself as an opposition politician criticizing the unpopular reforms of the right-wing government of Mikul√°≈° Dzurinda. In order to keep SMER from repeating the fate of his previous party, Fico introduced a strict set of regulations for his new party, called the \\"clean hands\\" policy. The rules stipulated that no one with ties from the previous communist regime or people who had background with other political parties was allowed to hold party office. This created a new generation of politicians uninvolved in previous corruption scandals; among them was Monika Fla≈°√≠kov√°-Be≈àov√°, Robert Kali≈à√°k and Pavol Pa≈°ka. Another rule was that all party chapters on the regional and local levels were to be 100% financially self-sufficient, and all financial donations were to be made public to the media. Between 2002 and 2006 Smer was the main opposition party in the Slovak parliament. In 2004, it merged with nearly all the leftist parties active on the Slovak political scene, including its parent party SDƒΩ, becoming the dominant single political party in Slovakia.  First term of Prime Minister: 2006‚Äì2010  In the elections in 2006 SMER won with 29.1% of the votes and formed a coalition government with Vladim√≠r Meƒçiar's People's Party ‚Äì Movement for a Democratic Slovakia (HZDS) and J√°n Slota's Slovak National Party (SNS). SNS is a right-wing populist party which has been known for making anti-Roma and anti-Hungarian comments, including a drunken public speech of J√°n Slota, in which he threatened to \\"get in tanks and level Budapest to the ground.\\" One reaction to the coalition came from the EU-wide Party of European Socialists (PES), who suspended SMER's application to join the PES. In late February 2008, however, the Assembly of PES conditionally reinstated the application after both SMER and SNS signed a letter committing themselves to respect minority rights. Fico has never publicly condemned SNS's remarks and speeches, and government-level relations between Slovakia and Hungary deteriorated in his first term in office. Several meetings between the two countries' prime ministers were abruptly cancelled, and those few that did take place resulted in little improvement of relations.  In opposition: 2010‚Äì12  Before the 2010 elections, Fico's party was in a relatively strong position according to several polls. However, just before the election a political scandal broke out, described as one of the gravest in the country's 17-year history. A voice recording surfaced in which a voice strongly resembling that of Fico claims that he raised several million euros in undeclared funds for the 2002 election as well as calling for a \\"parallel financial structure\\" to be created for the financing of Smer's election campaign. Slovak media sources such as SME carried the news about the recording in great detail; however, Fico dismissed it as a forgery. Fico also attacked the media sources that published information about the recording, saying \\"Should I go over there and give you a smack because you are scoundrels? What you are doing is unheard of. You are masturbating on the prime minister every day.\\" Fico has since been questioned on the matter, SME announced. Former Minister of Justice Daniel Lip≈°ic told the press he has \\"handed the recording to the general attorney office.\\" In the election, Fico's SMER remained the biggest party in Parliament, with 62 seats. However, his coalition partners were decimated, with the HZDS being completely shut out. Unable to find a partner willing to give him the 14 seats he needed to stay in office, Fico resigned. He said he \\"respects the election result\\" and expressed his desire to lead a resolute opposition after his narrow loss.  Second term of Prime Minister: 2012‚Äì2016 = 2012 parliamentary election  Following the fall of the centre-right coalition government that replaced his, Fico's Smer-SD returned to power being the first party since the breakup of Czechoslovakia to win an absolute majority of seats. Fico initially sought to form a national unity government with SDKU or KDH, but when this failed he formed the first one-party government in Slovakia since 1993.  2014 presidential election  On 18 December 2013, Fico officially announced his candidacy for the upcoming presidential election in 2014. \\"I understand my candidacy as a service to Slovakia,\\" Fico said on December 18. He argued that he did not see his candidacy as an adventure, an escape or an attempt to culminate his political career. His campaign ran under the motto \\"Ready for Slovakia.\\" On 9 January 2014, the Slovak Parliament, under Speaker Pavol Pa≈°ka, officially approved the candidatures of Fico and 14 other candidates. However, Fico was defeated by the independent candidate Andrej Kiska, whose support from the right wing of Slovak politics led him to victory by a wide margin (approximately 59%‚Äì41%) in the second round of voting on 29 March 2014.\\"Political newcomer Kiska takes wide lead in Slovak presidential election\\", Reuters website, accessed 30.3.2014  2016 parliamentary election  Fico's party won the 2016 parliamentary elections, amassing a plurality of seats, but failed to win a majority. On 7 March 2016, President of Slovakia Andrej Kiska invited each elected party, with the exception of Kotleba ‚Äì People's Party Our Slovakia, for post-election talks. Fico was given the first opportunity by the President to form a stable coalition. On 17 March, incumbent Fico informed president Andrej Kiska that he would form a four-party government coalition, including Smer‚ÄìSD, the Slovak National Party, Most‚ÄìH√≠d and Network, which together held 85 of the 150 seats.  Resignation  On 14 March 2018, Fico publicly stated that he was ready to tender his resignation as prime minister in order to avoid an early election as well as to \\"solve the political crisis\\" involving the murder of investigative journalist J√°n Kuciak, who was writing stories on tax frauds and alleged cronies of the ruling party. Kuciak also examined the work of the Italian mafia 'Ndrangheta in Slovakia. According to the police, M√°ria Tro≈°kov√°, who is an assistant to Robert Fico, could have ties to 'Ndrangheta. Fico's announcement came after a meeting with President Kiska. In that meeting, Fico laid out a number of specific conditions that needed to be met by the president in order for him to resign. Those conditions were amongst others; that the result of the 2016 Slovak parliamentary election be respected, that the current ruling government coalition must continue, and lastly, that Smer- SD as the largest party currently in parliament name the next prime minister. Fico stated that he already had a candidate in mind; Slovak media widely reported that the next prime minister would be Deputy Prime Minister Peter Pellegrini. On 15 March, President Kiska formally accepted the resignations of prime minister Fico and his cabinet, and thereby tasked Pellegrini with forming a new government.  Domestic policy  A large part of Fico's election victory in 2006 was attributed to his loud criticism of the previous right-wing government's economic, tax, social, pension and legislative reforms. The reforms were generally perceived as very positive and successful by such international bodies as the International Monetary Fund, the World Bank or the OECD. However, the reforms negatively affected large segments of the population, particularly low wage earners, the unemployed, and welfare and other social assistance recipients. While in opposition, and more vocally during the election campaign, Fico vowed to reverse and cancel the majority of these reforms. However, upon taking office Fico adopted a more cautious approach, as he wanted to ensure Slovakia could fulfill the Maastricht criteria required for Euro currency adoption. This was successful, and Slovakia adopted the Euro on 1 January 2009.  Labour policies  Among the reforms Fico introduced, several established standards as to how many times employees could be kept on as temporary workers instead of being given permanent contracts. Under legislation of the Mikul√°≈° Dzurinda government, an employer could keep new staff as temps and create a two-tier workforce, which many did. Slovakia's labor policies are now generally in tune with most other EU states. At the start of his second term as Prime Minister in 2012, Fico introduced a new \\"Labour Code,\\" which granted entitlement to a lay-off notice period as well as severance pay, reduced overtime, making layoffs more expensive for employers, shorter temporary work contracts and more power for trade unions. In addition, it curbed the ‚Äòchaining‚Äô of fixed-term employment contracts, whereby currently it is possible to extend a fixed-term employment contract three times over three years. The Code was revised in 2014 when it introduced severe restrictions of the work on agreement performed outside regular employment. Under the latest revision, employers will be able to conclude agreements with employees for 12 months only. In 2010, Fico faced large-scale protests and a blockade of major cities by truckers upset about what they considered to be badly implemented tolls on the highways. Truckers demanded that fuel prices be lowered to compensate for the tolls. Fico initially refused to speak with representatives of the truckers, saying he would not \\"be blackmailed\\", but a few days later capitulated. The cuts given to truckers will amount to about ‚Ç¨100,000,000.  Finance  One of few modifications Fico's government did implement was a slight modification to the unusual flat tax system introduced by the previous government, in a way that slightly decreased or eradicated a tax-free part of income for higher income earners. A lower value added tax was imposed on medications and books, though in spite of his election promises Fico failed to extend this onto a wider group of products such as groceries. Among the measures were controversial legislative changes which effectively banned private health insurance companies from generating profit. As a result, Slovakia is being sued by several foreign shareholders of local health insurers through international arbitrations. In 2007, Fico unsuccessfully tried to regulate retail food prices, an unprecedented effort in a generally free market European Union. In August 2008, Fico threatened the foreign shareholders of a local gas distributor SPP, the French Gaz de France and the German E.ON, with nationalization and seizure of their ownership shares in a dispute over retail gas prices.  Foreign policy = European Union  Robert Fico standing with Donald Tusk, Angela Merkel and Jean-Claude Juncker, September 2016 In foreign relations with Europe, Fico's government faced controversies due to its affiliation with the internationally isolated parties of Vladim√≠r Meƒçiar and J√°n Slota. Under his leadership however, Slovakia entered the Eurozone in 2009, and Fico himself in a speech to the Oxford Union praised Slovakia's entry into the European Union as a \\"success story.\\" Fico opposed the unilateral declaration of independence by Kosovo, which he called a \\"major mistake,\\" as a result of which Slovakia has not recognised Kosovo as a sovereign state.Slovakia: Declaration violates basic international law , B92, 2008-02-25 Responding to the 2013 Euromaidan protests in Ukraine, Fico declared that the \\"EU is no religious obligation\\" as well as that the EU was \\"so in love with itself\\" that it is convinced there is no better alternative to it in the world. He subsequently condemned the use of violence, but acknowledged that the protests were an internal affair in Ukraine. Fico rejected European Commission's plan to distribute refugees and economic migrants from the Middle East and Africa among EU member states, saying: \\"As long as I am prime minister, mandatory quotas will not be implemented on Slovak territory.\\"\\"This East-West split over EU refugee quotas will have long- lasting consequences.\\" The Daily Telegraph. 24 September 2015. He has subsequently sought to associate refugees and Muslims with terrorism, claiming that \\"thousands of terrorists and Islamic State fighters are entering Europe with migrants\\"Slovak election: PM Fico sees Muslim 'threat' and stating that \\"We monitor every single Muslim in Slovakia.\\"Fico: Security more important than migrants' rights In May 2016, he stated that Slovakia will not accept \\"one single Muslim\\" migrant into the country, weeks before the country was scheduled to take over the presidency of EU. He further stated \\"When I say something now, maybe it will seem strange, but I‚Äôm sorry, Islam has no place in Slovakia. I think it is the duty of politicians to talk about these things very clearly and openly. I do not wish there were tens of thousands of Muslims.\\"Slovakian Prime Minister says 'Islam has no place in this country' ‚Äì weeks before it takes over EU presidency Commenting on Brexit in November 2016, he stated that it wasn't clear what the United Kingdom wanted, adding that it \\"must suffer\\" more than the 27 countries who will remain in the bloc. He also stated that the UK will not be allowed to make EU workers \\"second- class citizens\\" while still receiving the benefits of the single market. In light of election of Donald Trump, he commented that it might spur Europe to bolster its military.It‚Äôs Not Clear U.K. Knows What It Wants on Brexit, Slovakia SaysEurope will make Brexit 'very painful' for the UK, claims Slovakia's Prime Minister In August 2017, Fico said: \\"The fundamentals of my policy are being close to the (EU) core, close to France, to Germany. I am very much interested in regional cooperation within the Visegrad Four but Slovakia's vital interest is the EU.\\"\\"Slovakia's future is with core EU, not eurosceptic eastern nations: PM\\". Reuters. 15 August 2017.  Russia  Fico with Russian President Dmitry Medvedev, 7 April 2010 Compensating for his lack of close political allies within the EU (the former head of the Czech Social Democratic Party, Ji≈ô√≠ Paroubek, being a notable exception), Fico sought to strengthen relations with several non-EU countries such as Serbia and Russia. This broke with a pro-NATO, Western-focused trend established after the 1998 Slovak election. After coming to power in 2006, Fico declared that Slovakia's relations with Russia would improve after eight years of \\"neglect.\\" Fico referred to \\"Slavonic solidarity,\\" which was a central theme of the Slovak National Awakening in the 1850s. On April 4, 2008, during a visit by Russian Prime Minister Viktor Zubkov, Fico said: \\"In Slovakia, there have been efforts to deliberately ignore Slavonic solidarity.\\" Slovakia modernised Russian MiG fighters in Russia and did not buy new jets from the West. Additionally, Fico accused Georgia of provoking Russia when attacking South Ossetia in the 2008 Russia‚ÄìGeorgia war. Under his premiership, the Slovak foreign ministry rejected the Crimean referendum which incorporated Crimea into Russia. Fico himself, however, remained silent on the issue. Regarding the EU sanctions against Russia in 2014, Fico denounced them as \\"senseless,\\" and a \\"threat to the Slovak economy.\\"  Hungary  Press conference following the meeting of leaders of Visegr√°d Group, Germany and France, 6 March 2013 Tension between Slovakia and Hungary, unstable from the past, was inflamed in 2006 following the parliamentary election and Fico's decision to include nationalist J√°n Slota and his Slovak National Party into his governing coalition. Slota was known for his fierce anti-Hungarian rhetoric, including that \\"Hungarians are a tumor on the Slovak nation that needs to be immediately removed.\\" In the wake of the election several incidents occurred which further inflamed nationalist sentiment on both sides, including the alleged beating of a Hungarian woman in South Slovakia. Fico reacted by condemning the extremism, but rebuked the Hungarian government by declaring \\"The Slovak government doesn‚Äôt need to be called on to strike against extremism.\\" The row heated up again in September 2007, when Fico's government introduced a law making the Bene≈° decrees inviolable. This was in response to demands from ethnic Hungarian politicians that compensations should be made to persons affected by the decrees. In May 2008, Fico labelled Hungary a potential threat during a speech commemorating the 161st anniversary of the day that Slovaks demanded national equality with other nations within the Austro-Hungarian Monarchy. Fico used the anniversary to openly criticise the political situation in Hungary and warn about the influence it might have on Slovakia. Especially he warned against the Hungarian right-wing politician Viktor Orb√°n, and his party Fidesz, which he called an \\"extreme nationalist party.\\" Since then, however, relations between the two countries have slightly improved.\\"PMs Orban and Fico Promise Better Relations \\". The Daily.hu. 20 May 2012.  United States  U.S. President Barack Obama meets with Fico in the White House, 12 June 2014 Fico was a vocal opponent of the one-time planned construction of new U.S. anti-ballistic missile and radar systems in military bases in neighbouring Czech Republic and Poland and one of his first steps upon taking office was a military pullout from Iraq. In November 2013, Fico visited the U.S. President Barack Obama in Washington D.C., where they spoke about the US-Slovak partnership, which is \\"based on shared democratic values and principles,\\" after which he affirmed the strategic partnership between the two countries.  Relationship with the media  During his press conferences he often verbally attacks, lectures and taunts the present journalists, often accusing them of bias and attacks on his government. On several occasions he has openly and on record used profanities against specific journalists (\\"idiots,\\" \\"pricks\\"). After characterising journalists as \\"hyenas,\\" the broadsheet Pravda adopted a hyena from Bratislava Zoo. In 2009, Fico repeatedly described the Slovak press as a \\"new opposition force\\" that was biased and was harming national and state interests. Fico also accused the press of failing to \\"stand behind the common people.\\" Fico has upheld a long-running boycott of one of the major Slovak daily newspapers, SME. According to Fico, the boycott will last until it apologises for what he calls lies they published about him in the past, going as far as boycotting the main presidential debate prior to the 2014 presidential election, as it was co-hosted by SME. As of March 2018 the boycott is still in place. Fico, on at least one occasion, issued an apology to a foreign politician whose visit to Slovakia was largely ignored by the media. When Russian Prime Minister Viktor Zubkov visited in April 2008, most media did not consider the visit of the virtually unknown Zubkov substantially newsworthy. To make matters worse, during the press conference the journalists were not allowed to ask any questions. Subsequently, Fico sent Zubkov a letter of apology in which he apologized for the Slovak media's lack of interest in his visit. In July 2012 Fico declared \\"Eternal Peace\\" between him and the Slovak press. He also stated his desire to change his attitude towards the media, saying \\"I think it is enough\\" and that he does not plan any further lawsuits against media outlets except in extraordinary situations. Fico further said: \\"You have to spend an incredible amount of energy on it [lawsuits], it means several years of conflict, one conflict takes usually five or six years [to resolve],\\" adding that lawsuits involve \\"legal fees, paying a lawyer, everything around that.\\" In November 2016, he termed journalists questioning him about allegations of public procurement rules during Slovakia's EU presidency, as \\"dirty, anti- Slovak prostitutes.\\" He also accused the accusations of being a targeted attack to smear the country's presidency of EU. After Fico stepped down from his post as prime minister early 2018, following the protests across the country, he renewed his hatred of the media, stating that he was planning on pursuing legal action against a number of notable journalists who slighted him during his time in power.  Personal life  Fico is married to Svetlana Ficov√° (n√©e Svobodov√°), a lawyer and associate professor from ≈Ωilina. They were classmates while both were studying law at the Comenius University in Bratislava, and they married in 1988. They have one son together, Michal, who studied at the University of Economics in Bratislava. In addition to his native Slovak, Fico speaks fluent Czech, English and Russian.  Religion  Fico has rarely discussed in public his religious life. In his application to join the Communist Party in 1984, Fico stated that he was \\"strictly atheistic,\\" as was required in order to be accepted. According to the testimonial from college added to the application, he held a \\"scientific Marxist-Leninist worldview\\" and \\"no problems with regards to religion.\\" In a promotional video during presidential election campaign in 2014, Fico said he grew up in a Roman Catholic family and that he considers himself a Catholic. He discussed his baptism, holy communion, confirmation and how the Catholic faith had impacted his childhood. He stated: \\"Perhaps if I am to do my profile in relation to the Catholic Church, I would end up better off than any MP of the KDH.\\" He also described growing up with his grandfather, a man who \\"very strictly respected the rules of standard Christian life,\\" stating that it profoundly impacted him. However, historian and former researcher of the National Memory Institute Patrik Dubovsk√Ω consider it being an attempt to manipulate public opinion, because \\"confirmation was in direct conflict with Communist Party membership, which political programme was based on atheism.\\" As Dubovsk√Ω stated, religiously active people were severely persecuted, especially after the Charta 77 incident. During televised debate Fico refused to answer a television presenter's question about whether he is a Christian (Catholic) or an Atheist, and said that he considered it a private matter. Regarding his baptism, holy communion and confirmation, Fico said that he was baptised as an infant and the holy communion with confirmation followed afterwards, as it was with every child who grew up in his home village, according to him.  Alleged extramarital affairs  In August 2010, Fico was photographed around midnight in a gay bar in downtown Bratislava together with a woman, who was later revealed to be 25-year-old Jana Hal√°szov√°, a secretary at the Smer-SD party headquarters. It was later revealed that Hal√°szov√° had been given extensive privileges, including her own parking space in the Parliament car park, without being a member. Hal√°szov√° had also bought a luxurious car worth around ‚Ç¨30,000 and bought a new flat without a mortgage in August 2012 in a neighbourhood where a one-room flat costs approximately ‚Ç¨100,000, despite being a secretary without education. In addition, both her sister and step-mother had recently been given jobs within various ministries. In August 2013, Fico was photographed while embracing and kissing his now- secretary Hal√°szov√°, after taking her for a private dinner at a chateau in ƒåere≈àany, 160 kilometres from Bratislava. The photos created another round of speculation about the true nature of their relationship as well as whether or not he had used public funds to pay for the dinner. A month later, the tabloid 7 Plus reported that Fico and Hal√°szov√° had been photographed together in a luxury restaurant while vacationing together in the Croatian town of Opatija. In response to this latest story, Fico filed a defamation lawsuit against 7 Plus magazine. In March 2018, after murder of Jan Kuciak, Slovak investigative journalist Eugen Korda in interview for public ƒåesk√° televize TV alleged that M√°ria Tro≈°kov√°, Fico's assistant, is also his lover.Novin√°≈ô Korda ≈°okuje: Tro≈°kov√° z Kuciakova ƒçl√°nku je Ficova milenka, a≈• odejde i z jeho postele Tro≈°kov√° escorted Fico on multiple high-level diplomatic meetings, including a summit with Angela Merkel, despite unofficial protests from German and Slovak diplomatic corps.O ƒçom rokovala M√°ria Tro≈°kov√° s Angelou Merkelovou? Subsequently, direct connection between M√°ria Tro≈°kov√° and convicted 'Ndrangheta member Antonino Vadala was revealed by the press. While her romantic connection to Fico was not confirmed, her former relationship with Vadala was. Despite the evidence Fico was publicly supporting Tro≈°kov√° and the secretary of the Security Council Viliam Jasa≈à. After the public outrage, Tro≈°kov√° abandoned her position as State Counsellor and Fico's assistant and disappeared from the public eye. ReferencesExternal links *The Fico Threat, by Martin M.

History  Polhemus Memorial Clinic Founded in 1858, the Long Island College Hospital introduced the practice of bedside teaching in 1860, and it later became the first U.S. hospital to use stethoscopes and anesthesia. In 1873 it introduced the first emergency ambulance service in Brooklyn. Its collegiate division would later form the Downstate Medical Center, an academic unit of the State University of New York in 1948. The Polhemus Memorial Clinic, an eight-story 1897 tower that was part LICH until July 2008, is considered to be the first example of skyscraper hospital, anywhere in the world. pp. 222 The hospital was affiliated with the Continuum Health Partners.  Merger and closure =Merger On May 27, 2011, Long Island College Hospital became part of SUNY Downstate's University Hospital of Brooklyn, renamed as University Hospital of Brooklyn at Long Island College Hospital, serving as a clinical campus for medical students in the Downstate College of Medicine.\\"Nurses Roam Empty Halls as Long Island College Hospital Is Prepared to Close,\\" New York Times. Accessed: July 19, 2013. Closure On February 8, 2013, the Trustees of the State University of New York voted to close the hospital.Long Island College Hospital to close New York Daily News A re-vote by the State University of New York board of trustees was taken on March 19, 2013, who again voted to close down the hospital. On April 1, 2013, for a second time the closing of the hospital was stalled in court. On July 19, 2013, the New York State Department of Health approved SUNY Downstate Medical Center's plan to close the hospital, which calls for all remaining patients to be transferred or discharged on or before July 28. The plan also calls for the hospital to stop admitting patients from its emergency department on July 22, and calls for the hospital's elective surgery schedule to be canceled, effective the same day. According to the plan, LICH continued to operate its emergency department until July 29 and did not close July 28 as planned. A state supreme court justice upheld a temporary restraining order preventing SUNY Downstate from shutting it down, and ordered both sides back to court on July 31 to decide its future. As a way of maintaining the hospital, SUNY issues an RFP on July 17, 2013 to seek bids from developers who could turn the property into a profitable venture through mixed use real estate projects while maintaining medical services for the community. On August 20, 2013, Brooklyn Supreme Court Justice Carolyn Demarest ordered the closure of the hospital to be stalled, citing a breach in the agreement by SUNY Downstate, concluding that SUNY \\"didn't buy the 18-building complex in the heart of downtown Brooklyn in good faith.\\". While bids were due for the RFP in September, lawsuits were stalling the effort to find a new plan for the hospital and community medical services. Three days prior to the bids being due, a NY State judge invalidated the effort to sell the property.  Bid process and development plans  Once the lawsuits were settled, the bids were reviewed and a winning bidder emerged, Louis Kestenbaum's Fortis Property Group. The initial Fortis proposal offered SUNY about half of the estimated $500 million value‚Äîfor the 200,000-square-foot complex, of which 15,000 square feet would be made into a facility with an urgent care center, physical therapy center, dental and other surgery space, but no emergency room and no full-use hospital. At the time, mayoral candidate Bill de Blasio opposed the Fortis plan because it did not contain a full hospital and had too much luxury housing compared to what the neighborhood could accommodate. Community organizations and SUNY decided to withdraw the bids and reopen the process to capture bids that would give the \\"community what it wanted\\". As a result, Brooklyn Hospital made a bid for the property that included 1,000 housing units, 1/3 of them to be \\"affordable\\", an outpatient medical facility and a 24-hour emergency services department. In January 2014, SUNY called for revamped bids to reflect the wants of the community and expectations of SUNY. The winning bidder of the 2014 bidding process was Brooklyn Health Partners, which said it would operate a 300- to 400-bed hospital on the site. Skeptics doubted that the deal would be signed by the required date in May 2014. One of BHP's former partners claimed that BHP miscalculated \\"the cost of renovations needed at the site, in order to accommodate a facility with up to 400 beds.\\" The New York Times, as well as Capital New York, a New York City-based political online publication, noted consistencies in the bidding process. The Times noted that the winning bed went to \\"an obscure development group, Brooklyn Health Partners, which has never built anything in New York or tossed up anything remotely as complex as a hospital\\" while Capital New York stated that evaluators were inconsistent in their evaluations, having \\"awarded drastically different scores to several bidders even when their thoughts on a proposal were very similar.\\" On May 5, SUNY issued a notice stating that Brooklyn Health Partners failed to complete the terms of the agreement and had decided to move on to the next highest bidder. BHP suggested that it would sue SUNY to prevent it from negotiating with the runner-up. The following day, SUNY began negotiating with The Peebles Corporation. BHP had gone to court to stop that process and asked the judge, New York State Supreme Court justice Johnny Lee Baynes, to give them more time. Then, another lawsuit was filed by Brooklyn-based six community groups, represented by activist lawyer Jim Walden of Gibson Dunn & Crutcher; Walden asked Baynes to disallow the scores given by six individuals on the LICH scoring committee. On May 15, Justice Baynes returned a ruling declaring that SUNY negotiate with the four bidders, but that his ruling does not impact SUNY's ability to continue finalizing the agreement with Peebles's team, to which the New York Post called the actions of the judge, \\"lunacy\\".  New development  A new development of seven towers was revealed in 2015. The development was to be constructed by Fortis Property Group and known as River Park. It was initially controversial because its high-rise design would have clashed with the mostly low-rise nature of the surrounding neighborhood, and residents were concerned that there would not be sufficient replacement medical facilities. Construction started in 2017 with expected completion through 2023. In 2018, renderings of the towers were released. The tallest tower, the 475-foot 2 River Park, would be one of the tallest buildings in Brooklyn when finished. ReferencesFurther reading * Hartocollis, Anemona.

History The regiment, which was initially styled the 14th/20th Hussars, was created by the amalgamation of the 14th King's Hussars and the 20th Hussars in 1922. It was re-titled the 14th/20th King's Hussars in December 1936. The regiment, which was based in India at the start of the Second World War, dispatched a cadre of personnel to form the 26th Hussars in February 1941. The remainder of the regiment was deployed to Iraq and Persia later that year to guard the oil fields. It landed in Italy in 1944 and then took part in the capture of Medicina in April 1945. After the war the regiment remained in Germany until 1946 when it moved to Cambrai Lines at Catterick Garrison as RAC Training Regiment. It moved to Haig Lines in Church Crookham in January 1951 and then deployed to Libya in November 1952. The regiment joined 20th Armoured Brigade and moved to Portsmouth Barracks in Munster in March 1956 and then transferred to 11th Infantry Brigade and re- located to Haig Barracks in Hohne in November 1960. The regiment deployed to Wavell Barracks in Benghazi in 1962 from where it sent units to Cyprus in December 1963 and again in May 1965. It returned home in January 1966 but joined 6th Infantry Brigade and moved to Barker Barracks in Paderborn in December 1966. In June 1970 it returned home to join 5th Infantry Brigade with its base at Aliwal Barracks in Tidworth Camp from where it deployed units to Northern Ireland at the height of the Troubles. It returned to West Germany in a new role as a recce regiment based at Harewood Barracks in Herford in May 1973 from where it continued to deploy units to Northern Ireland. It moved to Bovington Camp as RAC Centre Regiment in May 1976 and then joined 1st Armoured Division with its new base at Caen Barracks in Hohne in December 1977. The regiment re-roled as RAC Centre Regiment at Cambrai Barracks at Catterick Garrison in May 1985 and then returned to West Germany to join 4th Infantry Brigade based at York Barracks at Munster in March 1988. It was amalgamated with the Royal Hussars to become the King's Royal Hussars on 4 December 1992.

He was world champion in correspondence chess and held the title of Grandmaster in both over-the-board and correspondence chess.  Chess career  Born in St. Petersburg, Ragozin's chess career first came to the fore with a series of excellent results in the 1930s. In the earliest of these, he defeated the respected master Alexander Ilyin-Zhenevsky in a 1930 match and was himself awarded the title of Soviet master. At Moscow 1935, he won the best game prize for his victory against Andor Lilienthal. At the very strong Moscow tournament of 1936, he beat Salo Flohr and Emanuel Lasker and came very close to defeating Jos√© Ra√∫l Capablanca, the ever- resourceful ex-world champion scrambling to find a draw by perpetual check at the game's frantic conclusion. There followed a victory at the Leningrad championship of 1936 and second place shared with Alexander Konstantinopolsky (behind Grigory Levenfish) at the Soviet Championship of 1937. At the 1939 Leningrad-Moscow tournament, he finished third equal, behind Flohr and Samuel Reshevsky, but ahead of Paul Keres. Success continued into the 1940s with first prize at Sverdlovsk in 1942 and a repeat triumph at the Leningrad Championship of 1945. In 1946, he finished outright first at Helsinki and beat Igor Bondarevsky in a match. His greatest achievement in over-the-board chess then followed at the Mikhail Chigorin Memorial tournament of 1947, held in Moscow, where he placed second, half a point behind Mikhail Botvinnik and ahead of such luminaries as Vasily Smyslov, Isaac Boleslavsky and Keres. By the 1950s, he and most of his generation had been overtaken by the new wave of players emerging from the Soviet chess schools, but Ragozin continued his patronage of the Soviet Championship, competing a total of eleven times, from 1934 to 1956. Of his rare post-1950 international tournament appearances, his best result came at the 1956 Wilhelm Steinitz Memorial tournament in Mari√°nsk√© L√°znƒõ, where he finished second behind Miroslav Filip, ahead of Flohr, Ludek Pachman, Gideon St√•hlberg and a young Wolfgang Uhlmann. Throughout his life, he displayed an interest and talent for almost every aspect of the game of chess. For his over-the-board play, he was awarded the title of Grandmaster by FIDE in 1950 and in 1951 he obtained that of International Arbiter. From 1956‚Äì1958, his main focus switched to correspondence chess, where he showed that he was also an expert analyst and theoretician by becoming the second ICCF World Correspondence Chess Champion in 1959 (winning 9 games, drawing 4 games, and losing 1 game). His correspondence chess grandmaster title was awarded the same year.  Second to Botvinnik  With Ragozin's achievements coupled with his creative playing style, he attracted the attention of then world champion Mikhail Botvinnik. He recognised that Ragozin would make an ideal sparring partner and they played many secret training matches, as Botvinnik prepared for important world championship encounters. Ragozin's style had always been experimental and risky, particularly with regard to the sacrifice of pawns for the initiative. As Botvinnik was attempting to put together a repertoire of solid, reliable openings, it was vital that they were rigorously tested against any latent sacrificial play. Accordingly, many historians attribute Ragozin's contribution as a significant factor in Botvinnik's success. Ragozin and Botvinnik also teamed up to train for the 1944 Soviet championship. To simulate the noise that would be present in the tournament hall, they practiced with the radio blasting at high volume. Botvinnik won the tournament, whilst Ragozin, placing 13th out of 17, blamed his defeats on the unusual quietness of his surroundings.  Later career  From 1946 to 1955, Ragozin edited the magazine publication Shakhmaty v SSSR as well as maintaining a career as a civil engineer. He was vice-president of FIDE from 1950 through 1961. He died in Moscow while putting together a collection of his best games, which his friends completed for publication in 1964, under the title Izbrannye Partii Ragozina (Ragozin's Selected Games). It contains 74 games spanning his career.  Contributions to opening theory  His contributions to opening theory mainly concerned the development of systems by which Black could achieve equality in the Queen's Gambit and Nimzo- Indian complexes. The Queen's Gambit Declined Ragozin Defence, typically arrived at via the moves 1.d4 d5 2.c4 e6 3.Nf3 Nf6 4.Nc3 Bb4 (or by transposition) offering Black active play from the start, has enjoyed a resurgence in recent times.

The climate was generally warmer than today. It was preceded by the Boreal, with a climate similar to today's, and was followed by the Subboreal, a transition to the modern. Because it was the warmest period of the Holocene, the Atlantic is often referenced more directly as the Holocene climatic optimum, or just climatic optimum. Subdividing the Atlantic The Atlantic is equivalent to Pollen Zone VII. Sometimes a Pre-atlantic or early Atlantic is distinguished, on the basis of an early dividing cold snap. Other scientists place the Atlantic entirely after the cold snap, assigning the latter to the Boreal. The period is still in the process of definition.There is a good overview of the definition process with pollen diagrams and temperature graphs in Schr√∂der and others (2004). Reconstruction of temperature on the earth during the past 12,000 years. Post-Glacial Sea Level Dating=Beginning of the Atlantic period It is a question of definition and the criteria: Beginning with the temperatures, as derivable from Greenland ice core data, it is possible to define an 'Early' or 'Pre-Atlantic' period at around 8040 BC, where the 18O isotope line remains above 33 ppm in the combined curve after Rasmussen et al. (2006),S.O. Rasmussen, B.M. Vinther, H.B. Clausen, and K.K. Andersen. Greenland Ice Core Chronology 2005 (GICC05) Early Holocene section.

NOAA/NCDC Paleoclimatology Program, Boulder CO, USA. which then would end at the well-known 6.2 ka BC (8.2 ka calBP)-cold-event. Or one single Atlantic period is defined, starting at that just mentioned cold-event. After a lake-level criterion, Kul‚Äôkova and othersCited below. define the Atlantic as running from 8000 to 5000 (cal?) BP. Early Atlantic, or AT1, was a time of high lake levels, 8000‚Äì7000 BP; in Middle Atlantic, AT2, lakes were at a lower level, 7000‚Äì6500 BP; and in Late Atlantic I, 6500‚Äì6000 BP, and II, 6000‚Äì5700 BP, levels were on the rise. Each period has its distinctive ratios of species. End of the Atlantic period According to the ice-core criterion it is extremely difficult to find a clear boundary, because the measurements still differ too much and alignments are still under construction. Many find a decline of temperature significant enough after 4800 BC. Another criterion comes from bio-stratigraphy: the elm-decline. However, this appears in different regions between 4300 and 3100 BC. Description Tree line The Atlantic was a time of rising temperature and marine transgression on the islands of Denmark and elsewhere. The sea rose to 3 m above its present level by the end of the period. The oysters found there required lower salinity. Tides of up to 1 m were present. Inland, lake levels in all north Europe were generally higher, with fluctuations. The temperature rise had the effect of extending southern climates northward in a relatively short period. The treelines on northern mountains rose by 600 to 900 m (2000‚Äì3000 feet). Thermophilous (\\"heat-loving\\") species migrated northward. They did not replace the species that were there, but shifted the percentages in their favor. Across middle Europe, the boreal forests were replaced by climax or \\"old growth\\" deciduous ones, which, though providing a denser canopy, were more open at the base. The dense canopy theory, however, has been questioned recently by F. Vera.2005, under External links. Vera cites his own works dating to 2000. Oak and hazel require more light than is allowed by the dense canopy. Vera hypothesizes that the lowlands were more open and that the low frequency of grass pollen was caused by the browsing of large herbivores, such as auroch and wild horses. Flora During the Atlantic period the deciduous temperate zone forests of south and central Europe extended northward to replace the boreal mixed forest, which found refugia on the mountain slopes. Mistletoe, Water Chestnut (Trapa natans) and Ivy (Hedera helix) were present in Denmark. Grass pollen decreased. Softwood forests were replaced by hardwood. Birch and pine were replaced by oak, linden (lime, both small and large leaf species), beech, oak, hazel, elm, alder, and ash, spreading to the north from further south. The period is sometimes called \\"the alder-elm-lime period\\".Peterken (1993) In northeast Europe, the Early Atlantic forest was but slightly affected by the rise in temperature. The forest had been pine with an underbrush of hazel, alder, birch, and willow. Only about 7% of the forest became broad-leaved deciduous, dropping to Boreal levels in the cooling of the Middle Atlantic. In the warmer Late Atlantic, the broad-leaved trees became 34% of the forest. Along the line of the Danube and the Rhine, extending northward in tributary drainage systems, a new factor entered the forest country: the Linear Pottery culture, clearing the arable land by slash and burn methods. It flourished about 5500‚Äì4500 BC, falling entirely within the Atlantic. By the end of the Atlantic, agricultural and pasture lands extended over much of Europe and the once virgin forests were contained within refugia. The end of the Atlantic is signaled by the \\"Elm decline\\", a sharp drop in Elm pollen, thought to be the result of climate, disease or human food-producing activities. In the subsequent cooler Sub-Boreal, forested country gave way to open range once more.

Denmark was more of an archipelago. Humans lived on the shorelines, exploiting waters rich in marine life, marshes teeming with birds, and forests where deer and boars as well as numerous small species were plentiful. The higher water levels offset the effects of the submarine toxic zone in the Baltic Sea. It contained fish now rare there, such as the anchovy, Engraulis encrasicolus, and the three-spined stickleback, Gasterosteus aculeatus. Also available were pike, whitefish, cod, and ling. Three kinds of seals were found there, the ringed, harp and grey. Mesolithic man hunted them and whales in the estuaries. The main birds were maritime: the red-throated diver, the black-throated diver, and the gannet. The Dalmatian pelican (Pelecanus crispus), which is now found only as far north as south-eastern Europe, has been found in Denmark. The capercaillie, as is the case now, was found in forested areas. In the lofty canopy could be found a continuous zone of smaller animals, such as the ubiquitous squirrel (Sciuris vulgaris). Daubenton's bat (Myotis daubentonii) was common. In and around the big trees hunted the wildcat, pine marten, polecat (Mustela putorius), and wolf. The forest floor was prolific with larger browsers and rooters such as the red deer, roe deer, and wild boar. Not all the former plains mammals had abandoned the country. They remained in the open forest and meadows. These include the aurochs, ancestor of cattle, and the wild horse which, as a discovery, was something of a revelation. The horses were not entirely hunted out, were not confined to the plains further east, and were not entirely the property of the Indo-European cultures there. The Mesolithic Erteb√∏lle people were hunting them in Denmark.They were also being hunted on the Hungarian plain. See the article by Kert√©sz.

The Kongemose culture (6400‚Äì5400 BC) settled on the coastline and lake margins of Denmark. Late in the Atlantic, Kongemose culture settlements were abandoned because of the rising water of the Littorina Sea; and the succeeding Erteb√∏lle culture (5400‚Äì3900 BC) settled more densely on the new shorelines. Northeastern Europe was uninhabited in the Early Atlantic. When the Mesolithic Sertuan Culture appeared there in the Middle Atlantic, around 7000 BP, it already had pottery and was more sedentary than earlier hunter-gatherers, depending on the great abundance of wildlife. Pottery was being used around the lower Don and Volga from about 8000 BP. In the Late Atlantic, Sertuan culture evolved into Rudnya culture, which used pottery like that of the Narva and Dnieper-Donets cultures. That use of pottery upsets the idea that pottery belongs to the Neolithic. Further to the south, the Linear Pottery culture had already spread into the riverlands of Central Europe and was working a great transformation of the land. On the steppe to the east, the Samara culture was deeply involved with large numbers of horses, but it is not yet clear in what capacity.

Born in Germany and raised in England, Don studied at Magdalene College, Cambridge where he met his future wife. They ran a successful a costume jewellery business through the 1980s which ended in almost complete bankruptcy. Don made his television debut in 1989 as a regular on This Morning, which led to further presenting work across the decade, including his own shows for BBC Television and Channel 4. Don began his writing career at this time and published his first of over 25 books, in 1990. Between 1994 and 2006, Don wrote a weekly gardening column in The Observer. In 2003 Don replaced Alan Titchmarsh as the lead presenter of Gardeners' World, only leaving the show in 2008 due to illness before he returned to host from 2011. Since then he has written and produced several garden series of his own; the most recent being Monty Don's American Gardens which was aired in 2020. Early life and education George Montagu Don was born on 8 July 1955 in Iserlohn, West Germany. He is the youngest of five children to British parents Denis Thomas Keiller Don, a career soldier stationed in Germany at the time, and Janet Montagu (n√©e Wyatt). He was named after his two Scottish grandfathers, George and Montagu, but his paternal grandfather considered the Montagu absurd, causing his parents to change his birth certificate to Montagu Denis Don. When Don was ten he added his mother's maiden name, becoming Montagu Denis Wyatt Don. Don is a descendant of botanist George Don and the Keiller family, best known as the inventors of Keiller's marmalade. On his maternal side, he is descended from the Wyatt family of architects. Don had a twin sister who at nineteen, suffered from a broken neck and blindness from a car crash. When Don was one, the family moved to Hertfordshire, England. He described his parents as \\"very strict\\". He attended three independent schools: Quidhampton School in Basingstoke, followed by Bigshotte School in Wokingham, where at seven, he was asked to leave school for being too boisterous. He then attended Malvern College in Malvern, which he hated, followed by a state comprehensive school, the Vyne School, also in Basingstoke. He failed his A-levels and while studying for retakes at night school, worked on a building site and a pig farm by day. During his childhood he had become an avid gardener and farmer. In his late teens, Don spent several months in Aix-en- Provence, France where he worked as a gardener and played rugby in local teams. He returned to England, determined to attend Cambridge University out of \\"sheer bloody-mindedness\\", and passed the entrance exams. He studied English at Magdalene College, during which time he met his future wife Sarah Erskine, a trained jeweller and architect. Don took up boxing to impress his father, a former heavyweight boxing champion in the army, becoming a Cambridge Half Blue for boxing. He gave up after getting knocked out and suffering a concussion. Career=Jewellery business In 1981, Don and Erskine started Monty Don Jewellery, a London-based business that designed, made, and sold costume jewellery. The company became a success and in five years, operated from a shop on Beauchamp Place in Knightsbridge with hundreds of outworkers and had secured as many as 60 outlets across the US, including Harrods, Harvey Nichols, and Liberty. Among their customers were Boy George, Michael Jackson, and Princess Diana. However, the 1987 stock market crash caused an almost complete bankruptcy as it cut off American sales, their biggest market. The situation prompted Don to embark on a career in writing and broadcasting. Reflecting on the experience, he wrote: \\"We were lambs to the slaughter and we lost everything, [...] we lost our house, our business. We sold every stick of furniture we had at Leominster market\\". He was unemployed from 1991 to 1993, and spent all of 1992 on the dole. Some of their jewellery is kept at the V&A; Museum. TelevisionEarly career= By mid-1989, Don had written several gardening articles and granted writers access to his home garden which was featured in various publications. This increased exposure led to Don writing a gardening column for the Mail on Sunday, a book deal, and an invitation to a screen test for a proposed weekly live gardening segment on the ITV television breakfast show This Morning. Don landed the spot and his first segment aired in October 1989, receiving ¬£100 a show. After twenty-six spots on This Morning, Don landed additional television work as presenter on the BBC Television shows Holiday and Tomorrow's World. Though he had some doubts being a presenter, he took the jobs as he felt desperate for work. In November 1999, Channel 4 started to air the gardening series Fork to Fork, in which Don and his wife presented segments on growing and cooking organic vegetables. This was followed by three other series hosted by Don between 1999 and 2003: Real Gardens, Lost Gardens, and Don Roaming. =Gardeners' World= Don presenting at Gardeners' World Live in 2012 In September 2002, the BBC announced Don as the new lead presenter of its long- running series Gardeners' World from 2003, succeeding Alan Titchmarsh. Don is the first self-taught horticulturist presenter in the show's history. Don hosted the show until he put his career on hold to recover from his minor stroke in 2008, and the show continued with Toby Buckland filling in as host. During Don's initial stint, viewing figures fell from 5 million to 2 million, this fall being most frequently blamed on the BBC's decision to change the show's format soon after Don's arrival.https://www.telegraph.co.uk/gardening/6998352/Back-to-basics-at- Gardeners-World-take-two.html After viewing figures fell below two million for the first time in 2009,Smyth, Chris (12 January 2010).

Initially Don filmed episodes of Gardeners' World in Berryfields, a rented garden in Stratford-upon-Avon. When he returned as host in 2011, Don began to present from his own garden, Longmeadow. He was frequently seen on screen with his golden retriever Nigel until the dog died in May 2020, shortly before his 12th birthday. In 2016, Don introduced viewers to his new golden retriever, Nell. This was followed by the addition of Pattie, a Yorkshire terrier, in April 2020. In 2020, Don signed a contract with the BBC to continue presenting Gardeners' World for three years. =Own series= Don is also known for writing and presenting his own series. In 2005, he setup a smallholding in Herefordshire so a group of young drug offenders could work the land. The project was documented for the BBC series Growing Out of Trouble, airing in 2006. This was followed by the ambitious BBC series Around the World in 80 Gardens in 2008, where Don visited eighty gardens of a variety of styles worldwide. In 2010, Don presented My Dream Farm, a Channel 4 series which helped people learn to become successful smallholders, and Mastercrafts, a BBC series which celebrated six traditional British crafts. Monty Don's Italian Gardens aired on the BBC in 2011,\\"The Italian Job\\" by Monty Don, Daily Mail Weekend magazine, Weekend Gardening section. 12.03.2011.\\"Monty Don‚Äôs Italian Campaign\\". The Daily Telegraph, by Monty Don, 11 March 2011. which was followed by Monty Don's French Gardens, in 2013.\\"Monty Don's French Gardens\\". BBC programme website. Later that year, Don presented an episode of Great British Garden Revival. In 2014, Don became the lead presenter for the BBC's flagship Chelsea Flower Show coverage, again replacing Titchmarsh In 2015, Don presented the four-part BBC series The Secret History of the British Garden, charting the development of British gardens from the 17th to the 20th century. Since 2014, Don has presented three series of Big Dreams, Small Spaces, where he helps amateur gardeners in creating their own \\"dream spaces\\" on a domestic scale. Don's next series was Monty Don's Paradise Gardens in 2018, travelling across the Islamic world and beyond in search of paradise gardens and considering their place in the Quran. This was followed by Monty Don's Japanese Gardens in 2019, and Monty Don's American Gardens in 2020. Writer Don has described himself primarily as a writer, \\"who happens to have lots of television work.\\" By the early 1990s, Don had written two unpublished novels, The Clematis Affair and An Afternoon in Padua. He later described them as \\"excruciatingly bad\\". In January 1994, Allan Jenkins, then editor of The Observer, offered Don to write a weekly gardening column for the newspaper. The column began in February of that year and lasted until May 2006; Jenkins was his editor for seven years. In a piece from 2004 to commemorate the tenth year of the column, Don wrote: \\"It has been more life-changing than any other work I have done in my adult life.\\" Don has written articles for the Daily Mail and Mail Online since 2004. In 2016 Hodder Books published an audiobook of Don's Nigel: My Family and Other Dogs, read by Don. Style and reception Between 2008 and 2016 Don was President of the Soil Association. He is currently a patron of Bees for Development Trust and the Pope's Grotto Preservation Trust. Don had never received formal training as a gardener. He commented, \\"I was ‚Äì am ‚Äì an amateur gardener and a professional writer. My only authority came from a lifetime of gardening and a passion amounting to an obsession for my own garden.\\" Don is a keen proponent of organic gardening, becoming \\"officially\\" organic in his own garden in 1997. The practice of organic techniques often features in his published and broadcast work. The organic approach is most prominent in his 2003 book The Complete Gardener. This has led him into some controversy with those advocating non-organic techniques, with some criticising his position of influence presenting Gardeners' World and exclusion of non-organic solutions to pests and diseases in the garden. Don's sartorial style in the garden has been the subject of some critical attention, with Richard D. North commenting, in 2013: In 2005 Don himself dedicated a whole column to this subject, commenting: Prospect magazine declared Don \\"the nation's gardener\\". Personal life=Family Don married Sarah Erskine in 1983. They have two sons, Adam and Tom, and daughter Freya. The couple lived in Islington, north London, while Don pursued postgraduate study at London School of Economics and worked as a waiter at Joe Allen restaurant in Covent Garden and later as a binman. The couple then moved to the De Beauvoir Town area of Hackney where they made their first garden. In 1989, they relocated to The Hanburies, a country house in Herefordshire. The making of the garden there, and the subsequent loss of the house in the aftermath of the crash of their jewellery business, was the subject of Don's first book, The Prickotty Bush. In 1991, the Dons bought a home in Ivington, Herefordshire where they started to create a new garden named Longmeadow. The home was unfit to live in at the time of purchase, so while they refurbished it they rented a home in Leominster that was infested with rats and had no heating. They moved into their Ivington home at the end of 1992. Don has owned many dogs throughout his adult life. Two that he currently owns are Nellie, a Golden Retriever, and Patti, a Yorkshire terrier; both are seen on camera with Don on Gardeners' World. He also owns dogs that are not featured on the show.https://www.gardenersworld.com/news/monty-on- nigel/ The coppice at Longmeadow holds the graves of Dons' other pets, including dogs Beaufort, Red, Poppy and Barry, and cats Stimpy and Blue. In May 2020, Don announced the death of Nigel, a Golden Retriever who was popular with Gardeners' World viewers. Don said that Nigel had been more than a companion and had helped him with his struggles with depression. Don also has a sheep farm, on which he keeps 500 ewes. Health Don has suffered with depression since his mid-twenties. He first wrote about his experiences with it, and its affect on his personal life, in a piece for The Observer in 2000. His editor recalled that it \\"changed the way that people saw him\\" and Don himself said the article generated \\"a very immediate response\\" from readers. Don recalled \\"great spans of muddy time\\" in his life and realised that gardening \\"heals me better than any medicine\\". At one point, Don's wife threatened to leave with their children if he did not seek help. After receiving cognitive behavioural therapy and taking Prozac, Don quit both when he realised his depression was mostly seasonal and found relief with a lightbox, now a recognised aid for seasonal affective disorder. In August 2007, Don suffered from a bout of peritonitis, an abdominal infection. His wife had found him unconscious on the floor and he was rushed to hospital for emergency surgery. In February 2008, Don suffered from a minor stroke at home. He had been feeling unwell since the Christmas prior, mostly due to exhaustion from travelling to film Around the World in 80 Gardens. When his symptoms did not improve, a brain scan weeks later revealed a temporary blockage in one of his arteries to the brain. In May 2008, he put his career on hold to recover. In 2015, Don said that years of gardening had left him with sore knees, one of which causes constant pain and needs replacing. Other In July 2006 he appeared on BBC Radio 4's Desert Island Discs, choosing an eclectic mix of pop and classical records; the Beatles' \\"A Hard Day's Night\\" was his favourite disc, his book choice was Collected Poems by Henry Vaughan and his luxury item the painting Hendrikje Bathing by Rembrandt.\\"Desert Island Discs: Monty Don\\" 14 July 2006 Shortly before he fell ill with his stroke, Don had launched the Monty Don Project, a charity to help persistent offenders and drug addicts heal themselves by working the land. Honours Don was made an Officer of the Order of the British Empire (OBE) in the 2018 Birthday Honours for services to horticulture, to broadcasting and to charity.

At the age of five, he was recognised, according to Tibetan tradition, as the reincarnation of the 4th Samdhong Rinpoche and enthroned in Gaden Dechenling Monastery at Jol. Two years later he took vows as a monk, started his religious training at Drepung Monastery in Lhasa and completed it at the Madhyamika School of Buddhism.  Exile to India and life as an Educationist  Children of Tibet with Samdhong Rinpoche After his training in Lhasa, he fled to India in 1959, after the Tibet Rebellion, along with the 14th Dalai Lama, Tenzin Gyatso. From October 1961, he served as the religious teacher of Tibetan School in Shimla and in 1963 served as the acting Principal. In 1964 he worked as religious teacher of Darjeeling Tibetan School and in 1965 at the age of 26, he was appointed as the Principal of Central School for Tibetans, Dalhousie and served there till 1970. He received his Lharampa degree in the year 1968 and Ngagrimpa degree in 1969. In 1971 he became Principal of Central Institute of Higher Tibetan Studies (CIHTS) at Varanasi (Benares), and from 1988 to 2001 he was the director. From 1994 to 1995, he was awarded National Lectureship from Indian Council of Philosophical Research (ICPR), New Delhi. He assumed many important responsibilities including President of the Association of Indian Universities (AIU), a strong academic group of more than 250 Vice-Chancellors of Indian Universities, Chancellor of Sanchi University of Buddhist-Indic Studies and Chairman of various Trust and Foundations. He is regarded as one of the leading Tibetan scholars of Buddhism and is also an authority on the teachings of Mahatma Gandhi. He is fluent in Hindi and English, Tibetan being his mother tongue. Rinpoche is one of the very few Buddhist scholars in the world with this depth, experience and clarity in Buddhist philosophy and he also spent many years exploring directly with J. Krishnamurti, who was one of the great educationists in India. Rinpoche has been an honored guest at many forums in India. He has spoken on challenges India faces today, and has stressed on inclusion of the poor masses in development of the country.  Political Activities  In 1991 Lobsang Tenzin was appointed by the Dalai Lama as a member of the Assembly of Tibetan People's Deputies, and later was unanimously elected as its chairman. Rinpoche served twice as the Speaker of the Tibetan Parliament-in-Exile from 1991 to 2001. Between 1996 and 2001 he was an elected member of the Assembly representing exiled Tibetans from Kham province and also its chairman. Rinpoche contributed in drafting the new constitution of Tibetan Government in Exile, introduced educational and economic reforms, and ensured a policy of non-violence, transparency, environmental sustainability and organic farming. In 2000 the Dalai Lama decided that the Tibetan people in exile should elect their own Prime Minister, and in July 2001 Lobsang Tenzin was elected with about 29,000 votes, or about 84% of those cast, which is about 25% of the exile Tibetan population. Juchen Thubten Namgyal, the other candidate, won the remainder.It is Samdhong Rinpoche Since 2001 he has travelled extensively to gain support for the cause of Tibetan autonomy and raise awareness of the Dalai Lama's proposals for negotiating autonomy with the Chinese government. During his Prime Ministership, Rinpoche negotiated many times with the Chinese officials to bring a suitable solution to the Tibetan cause. However no meaningful development could be made in this direction.  Advocacy and teachings  Samdhong Rinpoche is an advocate of Gandhian philosophy, is a lifelong campaigner of non violence and is on the board of trustees of Swaraj Peeth Trust, a Gandhian centre for non violence and peace. He has held lectures and talks with exchange groups in Germany, Switzerland and USA where he spoke extensively on Buddhist ideology and its importance in contemporary politics and economy. A large score of his lectures on general subjects like peace, happiness and compassion, electoral reforms, modern ethics, the environment, Swaraj and non violence are available in audio and video on his website and Soundcloud.  Stance on \\"Middle Way Approach\\"  Rinpoche is a staunch supporter of the middle path and in sync with the views of the Dalai Lama. He is of the opinion that the Tibet issue is alive on the international forum and has received widespread support due to its right direction and commitment to non violence. In his own words ‚ÄúTibet cause is a just cause and not a power struggle. It is neither a political struggle nor a battle against the system. It is the struggle between truth and falsehood; justice and injustice.‚Äù A lifelong campaigner of Gandhian principles, he seeks not only political freedom for the Tibetan people but also to preserve the Tibetan Culture. In an interview he said, ‚ÄúOur ultimate goal is not just political freedom but the preservation of Tibetan culture. What will we gain if we win political freedom but lose what gives value to our lives? It is why we reject the option of violence. For respect for life is an inseparable aspect of the Tibetan culture we are fighting for.\\"  Note on his name  Lobsang Tenzin is his given Tibetan name. His legal name in India is Samdhong Rinpoche, although in fact this is a Tibetan religious title, like the Dalai Lama. In English he is commonly called Professor Rinpoche, and accepts this although it is incorrect. Tibetans address him as Rinpoche, which literally means \\"the precious one\\", used to be styled tulkus (incarnate lamas).

He was the first high-ranking casualty of the Battle of Verdun during World War I. Biography Second lieutenant Driant graduated from Saint-Cyr Born at Neufch√¢tel-sur-Aisne in the Picardy region, Driant graduated from the Saint-Cyr military academy and became an Army officer in 1877. Appointed to infantry, he joined the 4th Regiment of Zouaves in North Africa as a Captain in 1886. In 1888 Driant married the daughter of nationalist General Boulanger. He spent the years 1892‚Äì1896 as an instructor at the Saint-Cyr military academy, and from 1899‚Äì1905 commanded the 1st Battalion of Chasseurs. He resigned his commission in 1906, as he was banned from achieving higher rank due to his controversial father-in-law and by his strong nationalist and Catholic sentiments. He devoted his time to journalism and politics and was elected to the Chamber of Deputies as a representative for Nancy in 1910. Driant devoted his efforts to strengthening France's defenses. Writing In 1888 Driant began writing his first guerre imaginaire (\\"imaginary war\\") novel, which he was to publish using the pseudonym \\"Capitaine Danrit\\". This was (\\"The War of Tomorrow\\"), comprising three stories which told the tale of: La Guerre en forteresse}} (\\"Fortress Warfare\\"), (\\"War in Open Country\\"), and (\\"Balloon Warfare\\"). The action begins with , as reports arrive of a surprise German attack upon France. Driant gave his readers heroic episodes, great victories over the Germans, and in the 1192 pages of his (\\"The Fatal War: France-England\\", 1902), the total defeat of the British by the French. Driant possibly wrote more future-war novels than any other writer before 1914. He published so much fiction, and his stories were so long, that half a century later Pierre Versins said in his (1972) that the hundred pages of Chesney's Battle of Dorking were much more important and revealing \\"than the thousands of white pages soiled day after day by a national hero of France\\" (Driant had a postage stamp dedicated to him in 1956, Scott #788,2003 Standard Postage Stamp Catalogue, vol. 2. Sidney: Scott Publishing, 2002, p. 1026. Yvert et Tellier #1052). World War I Memorial to √âmile Driant and his battalion in the Bois des Caures, Flabas, France. Soon after the beginning of World War I in 1914, Driant was recalled to the Army as a captain. He was promoted to lieutenant colonel and given command of two infantry battalions, the 56th and 59th chasseurs reservists battalions. He still kept his seat in Parliament and was, among other things, involved in the drafting of the legislation to create the Croix de Guerre. In December 1915, he criticised Joseph Joffre for removing artillery guns and infantry from fortresses around Toul and Verdun in order to strengthen other areas of the now-deadlocked Western Front. Despite the support of the Minister for War Joseph Gallieni, no troops or guns were returned. What were supposed to be formidable defences were reduced to a small number of guns and soldiers to man them. Driant claimed that the area was threatened; Joffre denied this. Driant was proved right on 21 February 1916, when the German Army initiated a massive attack on French forces in the Verdun sector. As the French defences crumbled all around them, Driant's two battalions ‚Äì 1,200 men in total ‚Äì began a desperate defence of the Bois des Caures in Flabas. Under his command, the battalions managed to resist the German onslaught until the afternoon of the next day, helping to gain the time that the French High Command needed to rush troops to the threatened sector. When his battalions were outflanked and the position was untenable, Driant ordered the survivors to withdraw. During the withdrawal, he was killed. He was regarded as a hero among the French at the time, and he and his men are still commemorated at a ceremony on 21 February every year. He was buried initially by the Germans, who also wrote to his widow (via Switzerland) to assure her that he had been accorded full military honours. He was re-interred by the French where he fell in the Bois des Caures, where a memorial now stands to him and his men.

Dala dala are minibus share taxis in Tanzania.Thoughts On Dala Dala Buses isteptanzania.wordpress.com, May 29, 2009 Often overcrowded and operated at unsafe speeds, these minibuses developed as a response to an insufficient public transport system in the country. While the name may be a corruption of the English word \\"dollar\\", they are also referred to as thumni. Before minibuses became widely used, a truck with benches placed in the bed was the typical Tanzanian privately owned public transport.Travel Guide to Zanzibar zanzibar.org Called chai maharagwe, these were popular c. 1990. While dala dala may run fixed routes picking up passengers at central locations, they will also stop anywhere along their route to drop someone off or allow a prospective passenger to board. In contrast to most of these minibuses, in Dar es Salaam some dala dala are publicly operated as of 2008. History in Dar es Salaam A dala dala in the city of Dar es Salaam, in 2008. The dala dala developed as illegal taxis in Dar es Salaam, the largest city in Tanzania, due to a deteriorating system of government-run public transport in an environment of rising demand for such services. Between 1975 and 1983, the year dala dala were legalized, the number of buses operating in Dar es Salaam declined by 36% while the population increased by around 80%. In 1983, the government transport company was allowed to sub-contract to private entities, but due to high tariffs, this did little to substantially increase the numbers of licensed dala dala. Further reforms in the late 1990s caused the amount of legal minibuses to swell, and between 1991 and 1998 their numbers rose by 450%. Large amounts of pirate minibuses continued to exist, however, and in 1998 it was estimated that these comprised nearly half of all dala dala in operation. By 1998 dala dala had almost completely superseded government run public transport; in that year a total of 12 government operated buses plied the streets. Around that time there were somewhere between 7,650 and 6,300 dala dala in operation. Conductor Two dala dalas in the city of Mwanza in 2015. Dala dala are often operated by both a driver and a conductor. Called a mpigadebe, the name for dala dala conductors literally means \\"a person who hits a debe\\" (a 4-gallon tin container used for transporting gasoline or water) in reference to the fact that conductors will hit the roof and side of the van to attract customers and notify the driver when to leave a station. Regulation These vehicles for hire have their routes allocated by a Tanzanian transport regulator, Surface and Marine Transport Regulatory Authority (SUMATRA), but syndicates (informal groups that fix fares, collect dues, and manage stations) also exist. Prior to 1983, all forms of privately owned public transport were illegal in Tanzania, and as of 1991 and 1998 at least half of all dala dala continued to operate without a license. In 2002 it was noted that the dala dala market \\"seems to remain under conditions close to classical perfect competition.\\" See also *Boda boda *Matatu *Tro tro *Weyala, share taxi conductors in Ethiopia References Category:Share taxis Category:Public transport in Tanzania ","title":"Dala dala"},{"id":"4127549","text":"Cyprus competed at the 1984 Summer Olympics in Los Angeles, United States.

In the years surrounding the 1917 revolution, artists in Russia produced the first non-figurative art, which was to become the defining art of the 20th century. Costakis by chance discovered some constructivist paintings in a Moscow studio in 1946, and he went on to search for the revolutionary art which might otherwise have been lost to the world.  Family history  Born in Moscow of affluent Greek parents, George Costakis had no artistic education but developed an interest in art during his adolescence and as soon as he was able to, he began buying art. At first he worked as a driver for the Greek Embassy until 1939, when relationships between Russia and Greece broke down due to the Molotov-Ribbentrop Pact. After that he took up work as Head of Personnel for the Canadian Embassy. His work at the Canadian Embassy brought him into contact with many visiting diplomats and he would show them around the Moscow art galleries and antique shops.  The Russian Revolution and art  From the 1860s an art-buying middle class in Moscow had ensured an interest in and a market for Impressionist, Symbolist and Art Nouveau works produced in Russia and the rest of Europe. 'Culture' and collecting paintings had been a long established essential for the wealthy citizen of Moscow (Gray). In the early years of the 20th century the cultural and political climate of Europe as a whole was in a state of change with a cross-fertilisation of ideas across national boundaries. Many French cubist and Italian futurist works were being brought into Russia and exhibited.  Stalinism  At first the Bolshevik Revolution under the leadership of Vladimir Lenin supported the new abstract art but from 1920 onwards the freedom of artists in Russia was increasingly curtailed. Many artists wanted their work to contribute to the creation of a new society whilst others, for example the Suprematists continued to work independently. Lenin died in 1924 and Joseph Stalin who succeeded him as leader of the Communist Party of the Soviet Union, brought about another art ideology. In 1932 socialist realism became the official state policy. It was within this political environment that Costakis experienced the development, suppression and final disintegration of the older art culture in Russia.  The Costakis Collection  At first Costakis had collected the Masters of the Dutch School of Landscape Painters but modernist works by Pablo Picasso and Henri Matisse soon became his main subject, then in 1946 he came across three paintings in a Moscow studio by Olga Rozanova . He described how, in the dark days after the war these brightly coloured paintings of the lost Avant-Garde: :\\"... were signals to me. I did not care what it was... but nobody knew what anything was in those days.\\" (Chatwin, 1977) He was so struck by the powerful visual effect of the strong colour and bold geometric design which spoke directly to the senses, that he was determined to rediscover the Suprematist and Constructivist art which had been lost and forgotten in the attics, studios and basements of Moscow and Leningrad. He hunted for 'lost' pictures, some that were rolled up and covered with dust. He met Vladimir Tatlin and befriended Varvara Stepanova. He tracked down friends of Kasimir Malevich and bought works by Liubov Popova and Ivan Kliun. He particularly admired Anatoly Zverev, Russian expressionist whom he met in the 1950s. Costakis said about Zverev \\"it was a source of great happiness for me to come into contact with this wonderful artist, and I believe him to be one of the most talented artists in Soviet Russia.\\" By the 1960 the apartment of George Costakis in Moscow had become a meeting place for international art collectors and art lovers in general: Russia's unofficial Museum of Modern Art. The 'd√©tente' period following the signing of the Paris Peace Accords in 1973 opened up Russia once again to international cultural exchanges the first of which was the showing of the Costakis Collection in D√ºsseldorf in 1977. The same year Costakis, with his family, left the Soviet Union and moved to Greece, but there was an agreement that he should leave 50 per cent of his collection in the State Tretyakov Gallery of Moscow.

It is known for being one of the oldest trees in Britain, with modern estimates of its age between 2,000 and 3,000 years. Age Modern expert estimates put the age of the tree at between 2,000 and 3,000 years, although it may be a remnant of a post-Roman Christian site and around 1,500 years old.Bevan-Jones (2004) pp. 38‚Äì39 Others have suggested an age as great as 5,000 to 9,000 years. This makes it one of the oldest known trees in Europe,\\"Wanted: Fat, old, gnarled trees\\" (28 June 2007) Telegraph.co.uk. Retrieved on 29 September 2007. \\"The Fortingall Yew near Callendar in Scotland - believed to be the oldest tree in the UK and possibly Europe.\\" although the root system of the Norway spruce Old Tjikko in Sweden is at least 9,500 years old. The Fortingall Yew is possibly the oldest tree in Britain. The tree One trunk of the Fortingall Yew The tree's once massive trunk ( in girth when it was first recorded in writing, in 1769Hon. Daines Barrington, Transactions of the Royal Society, 1769.) with a former head of unknown original height, is split into several separate stems, giving the impression of several smaller trees, with loss of the heartwood rings that would establish its true age.This is also true of the Llangernyw Yew in North Wales. This is a result of the natural decay of the ancient heartwood, which reduced the centre of the trunk down to ground level by 1770.Notice by Thomas Pennant, who measured the girth at 56¬Ω feet, and noted that within living memory the heartwood had conjoined the trunks at a height of three feet (noted by Lindsay (1884): 221). Other than this, the tree is still in good health, and may last for many more centuries. By 1833 it was noted that \\"large arms had been removed and even masses of the trunk, carried off, to make drinking-cups and other curiosities.\\"Patrick Neill, in Edinburgh New Philosophical Journal, noted in Lindsay. It is protected by a low wall, erected in 1785\\"By the father of Dr. Irvine of Pitlochry\\" according to Lindsay. to preserve it, but can still be easily viewed. Kindrogan Field Studies Centre Clippings from the tree have been taken to the Royal Botanic Gardens, Edinburgh, to form part of a mile- long hedge. The purpose of this \\"Yew Conservation Hedge Project\\" is to maintain the DNA of Taxus baccata from ancient specimens in the UK as, worldwide, the trees are threatened by felling and disease.Ross, Shan (7 November 2008) \\"You may not be able to trace your roots back 5,000 years -- but yew trees can\\". Edinburgh. The Scotsman. In 2019 concern was expressed by the Tree Warden for Fortingall and the coordinator of the Tayside Biodiversity Community Partnership that tourist activity on and around the tree posed a threat to its survival. History The area immediately surrounding Fortingall has a variety of prehistoric archaeological sites including C√†rn na Marbh, a Bronze Age tumulus. Place-name and archaeological evidence hint at an Iron Age cult centre at Fortingall, which may have had this tree as its focus. The site was Christianised during the Early Middle Ages, with the yew already full grown, perhaps because it was already a sacred place. A recollection of 1804 noted that \\"the boys of the village\\" had damaged the yew \\"kindling their fire of Bealltuinn at its root.\\"\\"At the commencement of my incumbency, 32 years ago\\", according to Rev. Robert Macdonald in 1836, noted in Lindsay (1884) p. 222 Rev. James MacGregor, author of the Book of the Dean of Lismore, was a minister in the church during the 16th century.Keay and Keay (1994) p. 393. Sex of the tree The yew is male, however in 2015 scientists from the Royal Botanic Garde, Edinburgh reported that one small branch on the outer part of the crown had changed sex and begun to bear a small group of berries, an occurrence occasionally noted in some dioecious plant species, including yews. This is possibly as a result of environmental stress. The seeds have been preserved for study and will be used to help maintain genetic diversity in yews. Legend According to local legend, Pontius Pilate was born in its shade and played there as a child. Dr Paul S Philippou, honorary research fellow in history at the University of Dundee, has suggested the legend is historically inaccurate and is an embellished myth.

Thiotepa is an organophosphorus compound with the formula SP(NC2H4)3. It is an analog of N,N‚Ä≤,N‚Ä≤‚Ä≤-triethylenephosphoramide (TEPA), which contains tetrahedral phosphorus and is structurally akin to phosphate. It is manufactured by heating aziridine with thiophosphoryl chloride. History Thiotepa was developed by the American Cyanamid company in the early 1950s and reported to media outlets in 1953. In 1959, thiotepa was registered with the Food and Drug Administration (FDA) as a drug therapy for several solid cancers. On January 29, 2007, the European Medicines Agency designated thiotepa as an orphan drug. On April 2, 2007, the United States FDA designated thiotepa as a conditioning treatment for use prior to hematopoietic stem cell transplantation. Adienne Pharma & Biotech (Italy), the owner of thiotepa (Tepadina) applied for these designations. Use Thiotepa is indicated for use in combination with other chemotherapeutic agents. This can be with or without total body irradiation (TBI), as a conditioning treatment prior to allogeneic or autologous hematopoietic progenitor cell transplantation (HPCT) in hematological diseases in adult and pediatric patients. These diseases include Hodgkin's disease and leukaemia. Thiotepa is also used with high-dose chemotherapy with HPCT support to treat certain solid tumors in adult and pediatric patients. Thiotepa is used in the palliation of many neoplastic diseases. The best results are found in the treatment of adenocarcinoma of the breast, adenocarcinoma of the ovary, papillary thyroid cancer and bladder cancer. Thiotepa is used to control intracavitary effusions caused by serosal neoplastic deposits. Intravesical use Thiotepa is used as intravesical chemotherapy in bladder cancer. It may be used prophylactically to prevent seeding of tumor cells at cystoscopic biopsy; as an adjunctive agent at the time of biopsy; or as a therapeutic agent to prevent recurrence after cystoscopic resection of bladder tumor (transurethral resection of bladder tumor, TURBT). For intravesical use, thiotepa is given in 30 mg doses weekly, for four to six weeks. Efficacy in tumor control may reach 55 percent. The main toxicity of this therapy is bone marrow suppression due to systemic absorption of the drug. Side effects The main side effect of thiotepa is bone marrow suppression resulting in leukopenia, thrombocytopenia and anemia. Liver and lung toxicity may also occur.

Aalborg Monastery), is a former establishment of the Order of the Holy Ghost in Aalborg, Denmark. It was the hospital of Aalborg from 1431 to 1953 and is one of Denmark's best preserved medieval establishments. These are the oldest buildings in north Jutland, and the former hospital is also the oldest social institution in Denmark. History=Foundation The hospital was founded in 1431 by the wealthy Lady Maren Hemmingsdatter with the gift of a large house, adjoining land and an endowment as a \\"House of the Holy Ghost\\" (), common in Denmark at that period, a charitable institution of a religious nature for the care of the sick, old and poor. In 1434 the house burnt down and the present buildings were built to replace it. Order of the Holy Ghost On 20 August 1451 it formally became a part of the Order of the Holy Ghost, a hospitaller order which had originated in Montpellier, France, with the aim of caring for the sick, the old and orphans. The Aalborg hospital specialised in the care of lepers. It was a double house, with provision for both male and female religious. It gained high status within the order, the prior in Aalborg being the grand master's deputy in Scandinavia. The monastic complex when completed in 1500 consisted of four ranges round a quadrangular garden with the magnificent church on the south side, and separate wings for the male and female religious. It was constructed in late Brick Gothic style. The work of the hospital was paid for with income-producing farms, mills and fishing rights scattered throughout northern Jutland. It even owned its own brick works. The hospital was also authorized to send out \\"gatherers\\" who solicited donations of food, cloth, money or goods for the benefit of the sick poor. Dissolution and after During the Reformation in 1536, the Hospital of the Holy Ghost was dissolved. Its important function as a city hospital was still needed, however, and the city just secularized it: most of the religious simply gave up their religious status and continued doing the same work for the poor. Also, the Order of the Holy Ghost made extensive use of lay people in its hospitals, whose status was unaffected. The hospital continued to operate here until 1953. The church was another matter. After the Reformation, Aalborg had three large churches without religious organisations to provide for their upkeep, and the townspeople did not want the cost of their maintenance. It was therefore decided to demolish the hospital church and the Vor Frue Church, leaving St. Budolfi Church as the city church. (The tower of the hospital church remained standing until 1880). For 300 years the grammar school of Aalborg was also located in the buildings. During the Second World War, Denmark's first resistance group, the Churchill Club, was established here. Present day Today the buildings contain a retirement home with independent apartments for the elderly, as well as meeting and exhibition rooms. There is also a chapel where services are held by clergy from the Budolfi Church, now the cathedral of Aalborg. The present Aalborg Kloster is directed in its social care functions by a board consisting of the Bishop of Aalborg, a representative of the North Jutland Region, the mayor of Aalborg, the Chief of Police and two other church representatives.

He was born in Washington, D.C. and turned 100 in November 2013. During his career he won five Grand Slam doubles tournaments and was a member of the winning Davis Cup team on three occasions. Tennis career While he was the tennis coach at the University of Miami, Mulloy recruited Pancho Segura for the tennis team. Segura won three straight NCAA singles titles in 1943, 1944, and 1945. Segura went on to enjoy a successful professional tennis career, competing against the top touring professional players from 1947 until his retirement in 1962. Mulloy was inducted into the University of Miami Sports Hall of Fame in 1967 as part of its inaugural class of inductees. Mulloy reached the U.S. Championships men's singles final in 1952, losing to second-seeded Frank Sedgman in three straight sets. He reached the U.S. No. 1 ranking the same year and was ranked world No. 6 by Harry Hopman in 1947 and world No. 7 by American Lawn Tennis Magazine in 1949.\\"Gardnar Mulloy Tentatively Ranked No. 1 in Net World\\", The Palm Beach Post, December 14, 1952.\\"Richard Gonzalez World's No. 1: Amateur Lawn Tennis Rankings\\", The Sunday Indian Express, November 18, 1949. The pair of Mulloy and Talbert won the U.S. men's doubles title in 1942, 1945, 1946, and 1948. He also won the Wimbledon doubles with Budge Patty in 1957, at age 43. Mulloy was a Davis Cup team member in 1946, 1948‚Äì50, 1952‚Äì53 and 1957, winning the Cup on three occasions against Australia. His Davis Cup record stands at 11 wins and 3 losses. Mulloy, who served as the commanding officer of LST 32 during World War II in the Mediterranean Theater, was inducted into the International Tennis Hall of Fame in Newport, Rhode Island, in 1972. In 2015 Mulloy was awarded a French Legion of Honor knighthood for his service in the US Navy in relation to operations in Italy and Provence. As such he became the oldest first time recipient of the order ever since it was created by Napoleon. Mulloy was a 1936 graduate of the University of Miami, and tennis coach at the school. He also was a member of Lambda Chi Alpha fraternity. He recruited to Miami and played doubles with George Toley, who went on to win 10 NCAA team titles at the University of Southern California. Probably Mulloy's greatest contribution to tennis was advancing the popularity of senior tennis. He played the senior circuit around the world into his nineties, and established the Mulloy Cup for international competition between men tennis players 80 years of age and over. He won over 127 national championships and 25 international titles in 75 years of playing competitive tennis. As of 2006, Mulloy was still participating in and winning senior matches. Personal life In 1938, Mulloy married Madeline L. Cheney (1917‚Äì1993), with whom he had two daughters, Diane Mulloy Mazzone and Janice Mulloy Poindexter. He married his second wife, Jacqueline Mayer, in 2008, when he was 95 years old. Mulloy died in Miami on November 14, 2016, from stroke complications, aged 102, survived by his second wife, his daughters, four grandchildren, and nine great-grandchildren.

Plummer Roddis building in 1927 Holy Trinity, Hastings: Ward added the Lady Chapel in 1907 Henry Ward ARIBA ( ‚Äì 9 September 1927) was a British architect who designed many large public buildings in and around Hastings, East Sussex, some of which are listed buildings. Biography Henry Ward was born in Peckham, London,1891 England Census1901 England Census the son of tailor Edward John WardLondon, England, Church of England Marriages and Banns, 1754-1932 and Susannah Ward.1861 England Census He arrived in Hastings in his late twenties after being articled at architectural practices in London and Paris. Ward briefly worked for and under the guidance of architect Walter Liberty Vernon and during the 50 years he worked in the town he designed buildings from his architectural practice at 8 Bank Buildings. Designs One of his first designs was the listed Gothic Revival Hastings Town Hall (1881) in Queens Road, which originally included the Police Court with cells. He also designed Bexhill Town Hall (1898). He was responsible for a number of churches in Hastings and around Sussex including the United Reformed Church in Robertson Street, Hastings, St Johns, Bexhill, St Stephens, Bexhill, and The Chapel in Priory Road. In 1907 he added the Lady Chapel to the Holy Trinity Church, Hastings. The commercial buildings he designed include the print-works and offices for Observer Building, Hastings, with its unique for the area terracotta-glazed frontage produced by the brick company Ibstock Hathernware. As of December 2019, the building is being brought back into use under the stewardship of Jess Steele. Besides this, he designed a number of stores around South East England for the Plummer Roddis chain of department stores, the Buchanan Hospital women‚Äôs wing at St Leonards on Sea, the listed tiles and bar at the Havelock Public House, the Buccaneer Public House in Eastbourne, as well as changes to the front of the Queen Victoria Hotel in St Leonards on Sea. Legacy A few days after his death in 1927, the Plummer Roddis department store (now Debenhams) was opened and was regarded as the finest design he had produced and remains as the largest and most imposing building in the Town Centre of Hastings near to his original offices. In his home town and often working with awkward sites, Ward created a range of architectural styles of innovative construction, and in the words of the Obituary published by RIBA: > \\"Many monuments to the ability and artistic skill of the late Mr Ward remain > to keep alive the memory of a man who was widely known and respected > throughout Hastings and in professional circles throughout the country.\\" He died on 9 September 1927. His architectural practice was continued until at least 1960 by his son Mr Henry D Ward.

Plot While escaping from Nazis during World War II, a Jewish man buries two suitcases full of things dear to his heart in the ground. The war deprived him of his family, and afterwards he endlessly turns over the soil of Antwerp to find the suitcases, an obsessive compulsion. He keeps checking old maps and keeps digging, trying to find what he lost. His daughter Chaya is a beautiful modern girl looking for a part-time job. She finds a place as a nanny in the strictly observant Hasidic family with many children, although her secular manners clearly fly in the face of their beliefs. One of the reasons she is accepted is that mother of the family is absolutely overburdened by the household, so Chaya stays despite the resistance of the father, who is normally an indisputable authority in the family. She develops a special bond with the youngest of the boys, four-year-old Simcha, who seems incapable of speaking. She encourages him to speak while walking in the park, and it appears that, after some coaching from Chaya (who needs coaching herself) during the upcoming Passover Seder, Simcha will be able to chant the section of the Haggadah usually reserved for the youngest speaking participant - the Four Questions. At first, Simcha's nerves prevent him from chanting, and his brothers begin to chant instead. Simcha finally lifts his voice. The entire family, including Chaya, applauds his efforts, but his judgmental father does not recognize this great step, but instead criticizes the boy for a mistake. Chaya confronts the father, and in the process, discovers his own pain as a Holocaust survivor, and begins to understand her own parents' grief. The anti- Semitic superintendent of the building is a constant problem for the entire family and now for Chaya. However, as opposed to the observant Jews, she refuses to be a victim and does not put up with his anti-Semitic tricks. She fights him, thus exciting the children's admiration and father's wrath. Unfortunately, walks with Simcha end in a tragedy: after sneaking to the park, he drowns in the pond, while chasing the ducks he loved so much. Some in the community hold Chaya responsible for his death. However, in a scene where Chaya goes to the family's mourning service, the mother feels compassion for Chaya and realizes that Chaya felt a deep connection with Simcha. As an act of acceptance, his mother rips Chaya's shirt, which is a sign of a mourner (a sibling, parent, child or spouse of the deceased) in Jewish tradition. The boy's father finally, albeit silently, acknowledges Chaya's connection with Simcha when she observes the graveside service. Chaya's experience allows her to finally accept her parents' past, and to embrace her own Jewishness. The film is a commentary not only on external (gentile) anti-Semitism, but also on the lack of connection and self-acceptance of assimilated Jews.

The car is based on the original 1984 ('System Porsche') version of the SEAT Ibiza Mark I (1984-1993). After the Ibiza was replaced, the technology and production line were bought by a joint venture between Nanjing Yuejin and the Malaysian Lion Group in 1997. Production did not begin, however, until Fiat took over the Lion Group's share in Jiangsu Nanya Auto, as the company was called. In 1999 the SEAT design was modified for the Chinese market and then rebranded as the Zhongguo Nanjing NJ6400, later as the modernized and fuel injected GHR Encore. This model continued until October 2003 when the Ibiza license expired and the design had to be updated. In March 2004 a Chinese mobile phone manufacturer called Ningbo Bird decided that it too wanted to get into the process of car manufacture. With Ningbo Bird joining the original partners in a 50/50 relationship, the new design was renamed the Soyat. Ningbo Bird then left the company in 2005. Nanjing NJ1020 Unique In addition to the five-door Soyat hatchback, a four- door tall estate (two on the right-hand side) called the Soyat Unique NJ1020 is also available, using a wider and taller rear end borrowed from the more modern SEAT Inca. Although the car's design dates back to 1984, it proved reasonably popular.

Engines available were originally the \\"System Porsche\\" 1.2 and 1.5-litre (70 and 86 hp), the smaller engine has since been replaced with a 1,342 cc version of Toyota origins. All engines were paired to a 5 speed manual gearbox as standard. A facelifted model called NJ7150 was launched in 2004 and this was further modified in 2006 for the NJ7150B model with a new front design, but it was all for nothing and by 2008 Soyat production had ended and Nanjing's new owners SAIC closed down the Wuxi factory. The car was also noted to be reliable, cheap to maintain and cheap to buy. Pricing for the Yuejin Soyat ranged from 44,900 yuan to 48,300 yuan (6,280 to 6,760 USD).

It is located southeast of Hama, northeast of Homs. The city is nicknamed the \\"mother of Cairo\\" because it was the birthplace of the second Fatimid caliph al-Qa'im bi-Amr Allah, whose dynasty would eventually establish the city of Cairo, and the early headquarters of his father Abdullah al-Mahdi Billah who founded the Fatimid Caliphate. The city is an important center of the Shi'ite Nizari Isma'ili and Taiyabi Isma'ili Islamic schools and also the birthplace of poet Muhammad al- Maghut. The population of the city is 66,724 (2004 census).Salamyah city population History Salamiyah is an ancient city which was first known during Babylonian times in 3500 BC. It was the dwelled in by Sumerians at around 3000 BC, the Amorites around 2400 BC, the Aramaeans around 1500 BC, and the Nabateans around 500 BC. The city was destroyed for the first time by the Assyrians in the year 720 BC. After being rebuilt, the city was part of the Roman Empire and ruled by the Royal family of Emesa, a Roman Client Kingdom of Ancient Rome where they built the famous Chmemis Castle on the remains of a former volcano, northwest of Salamiyah. During the Byzantine Empire, Salamiyah existed as a Christian center with its own autocephalic Archbishop, until the city was destroyed for a second time during the Persian invasion of Syria of 637 during the Byzantine-Sassanid Wars by commander Kisra Ibrawiz who razed the city to the ground. The city was rebuilt again in the Islamic era by Abdullah ibn Saleh ibn Ali al-Abassi, the Abbasid governor of southern and center Syria, in 754 and was settled by some Hashimites during the Abbasid era, and al-Abbasi's son Muhammad ibn Abdullah ibn Saleh transformed the city into an important commercial center.See Ya'qubi, quoted in le Strange, 1890, p. 528 According to Isma'ili Muslims, their Imam, Isma'il ibn Jafar died and was buried in the city after going into hiding during the eighth century. The city became the secret headquarters of the Isma'ili movement from the early ninth century until 902, it was from there that missionaries were originally sent for propagating the Isma'ili teachings in different regions. It was from Salamiyah, that the Isma'ili Imams secretly guided the activities of their followers from North Africa to Persia, Azerbaijan, and Central Asia. According to conflicting histories, the Isma'ili Imam, and first Fatimid Caliph, Abdullah al-Mahdi Billah was either born in Salamiyah or came to the city in 882 from Khuzistan, in modern-day Iran where he was raised by his uncle Abul Shalaghlagh the Hujjah (also called Lahiq) or leader of the Isma'ilis of Salamiyah, one of the twelve Isma'ili communities at the time. Abdullah's son Muhammad al-Qa'im bi-Amr Allah, an Isma'ili Imam and the second Fatimid Caliph, was born in Salamiyah in the late ninth century, and both left the city to establish the Fatimid state in northern Africa in the early tenth century. After the death of Abul Shalaghlagh in 899, a dispute arose between Salamiyah Isma'ilis due to the fact that he left no male descendants and apparently had designated his nephew Abdullah as his spiritual successor and leader of the Salamiyah Isma'ili movement. Thereafter, a schism split the movement, provoked by Abdullah's claims on the imamate for himself and his descendants. Hamdan Qarmat and 'Abdan, who may have previously drifted slightly away from the doctrine propagated by the leadership, broke off their support. Qarmat's followers would eventually be known as the Qarmatians, and after Abdullah fled from Salamiyah to found the Fatimid Isma'ili state in North Africa in 899, the Qarmatis would reject the legitimacy of the Fatamids. In 903, Salamiyah was destroyed for the third time by an invasion from the rebel Qarmatians under Yahya ibn Zikrawayh. Salamiyah is mentioned by historians as a very small town with limited rural settlement consequent to the Qarmatian invasion until the early Ottoman period wherein it was apparently deserted due to lack of protection from Bedouin attacks. Salamiyah was rebuilt when permission by the Ottoman Sultan Abdul Hamid II through a firman in July 1849 gave permission for the emigration of Isma'ilis led by Isma'il bin Muhammad, the Isma'ili amir of Qadmus in northern Syria. Isma'ilis from Qadmus and Masyaf among other smaller towns and villages emigrated to the newly rebuilt city which was first occupied by only sixteen families and by 1861, Salamiyah became an agricultural village. The final major Isma'ili immigration to Salamiyah occurred in 1919. Salamiyah is currently the largest population center of Isma'ili Muslims in the Arab world. The remains of Prince Aly Khan, the father of the current Nizari Isma'ili Imam Aga Khan IV, are buried in the city. The headquarters of the Isma'ili Shia Higher Council of Syria are in the city, as are dozens of Jama'at Khana. During the mid- twentieth century, Salamiyah saw a growth of religious diversity with the building of the first Sunni mosque, and now the city is home to almost a dozen Sunni mosques and a Ja'fari Shia mosque in the city's Qadmusite Quarter which is home to most of the city's Ithna Ashari Shia which migrated to the city after ethnic and religious clashes in their hometown of Qadmus in the early twentieth century. Currently, a little more than half of the city's residents are Isma'ili.Syria's diverse minorities, BBC, 9 December 2011 In 1934, Muhammad al-Maghut, the poet credit for being the father of free verse Arab poetry, was born in Salamiyah. In 1991, visitors from the Dawoodi Bohra sect of Isma'ili Shia Islam in Yemen built the Mosque of Imam Isma'il adjacent to the grave of the Isma'ili Imam Isma'il. The mosque was built by order of their leader the Da'i al-Mutlaq Mohammed Burhanuddin according to an inscription on the mosque's wall. Although currently used for worship by Sunni Muslims, the mosque and mausoleum are visited in religious pilgrimages by Dawoodi Bohra worldwide. Situation of land access in Northern Central Syria during Syrian Civil War Salamiyah is located at the crossroadsFrom 2012 to 2017, with the development of frontlines in Syrian Civil War, the city grew in its strategic importance. With Al-Rastan becoming a pocket outside government control along the Homs- Hama Motorway, and the developments in Idlib governorate resulting in the government also losing control of large segments of the main Hama-Aleppo Highway, the Homs-Salamiyah, Hama-Salamiyah, and Salamiyah-Ithriya-Aleppo roads became major lines connecting these government-held areas. This importance was why the town was the target of occasional ISIL or rebel mortar attacks. Also, some of the town's citizens have participated in protests during the Civil War.http://english.al-akhbar.com/node/3679 The importance of Salamiyah diminished following the Syrian Army's securing of the Homs-Hama Motorway on February 1, 2018, during the Northwestern Syria campaign.  Residence history of Salamiyah  The residence history of Salamiyah is as follows:http://www.ismaili.net/histoire/history04/history419.html Wafi Ahmad in Salamia > \\"The Ismaili dais in search of a new residence for their Imam came to > Salamia and inspected the town and approached the owner, Muhammad bin > Abdullah bin Saleh, who had transformed the town into a flourishing > commercial centre. They told him that there was a Hashimite merchant from > Basra who was desirous of settling in the town. He readily accepted and > pointed out to them a site along the main street in the market, where > existed a house belonging to a certain Abu Farha. The Ismaili dais bought it > for their Imam and informed him about it. Wafi Ahmad arrived to his new > residence as an ordinary merchant. He soon pulled down the old building and > had new ones built in its place; and also built a new wall around it. He > also built a tunnel inside his house, leading to the desert, whose length > was about . Money and treasures were carried on camels to the door of that > tunnel at night. The door opened and the camels entered with their loads > inside the house.\\" The photo placed here shows the mausoleum of the Imam. Near his kabra mubarak (\\"blessed grave\\"), the tunnel opening still exists. Culture The city is an agricultural center, with a largely agriculture based economy. Mate is extremely popular in Salamiyah and a drink of major cultural importance in social gatherings.

He has created a unique way in classic Eastern European erudition, which is expressed mainly in his book Sha'arei Yosher, and is characterized by a logical-legal analysis of the basic principles of Halakha, and less than local pilpul.  Early life  Shimon Yehuda Shkop was born in Torez, today in Belarus, in 1860. At the age of twelve, he went to study in the Mir Yeshiva for two years. He then traveled to the Volozhin yeshiva where he studied with Naftali Zvi Yehuda Berlin for six years. He was part of a special group of students with whom Chaim Soloveitchik interacted. His study partners included Gershon Tanchum Grodener (Biletzky), and Chaim Ozer Grodzinski, chief rabbi of Vilna. Telz Shkop married a niece of Eliezer Gordon, and in 1884 was appointed a rosh mesivta at Telz Yeshiva, where he remained for 18 years. While there, he developed a system of Talmudic study which combined the logical analysis and penetrating insights of Chaim Soloveitchik with the simplicity and clarity of Naftali Zvi Yehuda Berlin and which became known as the \\"Telz way of learning\\". In 1903, he was appointed rabbi of Moltsh, and in 1907 of Bransk. Among his students in Moltsh was Yechezkel Sarna, who studied under Shkop for a year in 1906, before leaving to the Slabodka yeshiva when Shkop himself left. During World War I, the communal leaders urged him to leave before the Germans arrived, but he refused and stayed with his community. Grodno Shkop (left) and Chaim Ozer Grodzinski Between 1920 and 1939, at the request of Grodzinski, he succeeded Alter Shmuelevitz as Rosh Yeshiva of the renowned Sha'ar HaTorah in Grodno. He raised the level of the institution and transformed it into one of the finest yeshivos in Poland and beyond. Hundreds of young men flocked there from near and far. One of his students there was Dovid Lifshitz, later to become the Suvalker Rav. For many years, Zelik Epstein, who was married to a granddaughter of Shkop, has headed a successor institution in Queens, known as Yeshiva Shaar Hatorah - Grodno. When he was eighteen, Chaim Shmuelevitz was invited by Shkop to give the third level lecture in the Yeshivah Ketanah in Grodno. At the age of 22, he headed a group of students who transferred from Grodno to Mir. However, his four years in Grodno with Shkop had a profound influence on his approach to Talmudic analysis. Yeshiva University In 1928, Shkop traveled to the United States in order to raise much needed funds for the Yeshiva. After delivering a lecture at Yeshiva University, he eventually acceded to Bernard Revel's invitation to serve as a Rosh Yeshiva of Rabbi Isaac Elchanan Theological Seminary in New York. In his absence from Poland, he was greatly missed by Yisrael Meir Kagan and Grodzinski, who pleaded with him to return. He also received a scathing letter from Yeruchom Levovitz, the mashgiach of Mir, which, according to an eyewitness, he ignored. In 1929, Shkop returned to Europe. https://www.yu.edu/riets/about/mission- history/historic-roshei/shimon-yehudah-hacohen-shkop Character and personality Shkop had a warm and open personality. He was an active member of the Moetzes Gedolei HaTorah of the Agudas Yisroel. Many of his students attained distinction, among them Rabbis Elchonon Wasserman of Baronovitch, Yisrael Zev Gustman, Yosef Shlomo Kahaneman of Ponevezh and Isser Yehuda Unterman, a future Israeli Chief Rabbi. Michoel Fisher of London was also a pupil of Shkop. Shkop formed close bonds with [the younger] Yehuda Zev Segal, the future Manchester Rosh Yeshiva. He would sometimes come to England to raise funds for his yeshiva, and Segal took advantage of these opportunities to serve as his attendant, spending one vacation at Shkop's summer resort, studying with him and accompanying him on his walks. Major works *Sha'arei Yosher (1925) *Ma'arekhet ha-Kinyanim (1936) *Novellae on tractates Bava Kamma, Bava Metzia, and Bava Basra (1947) *Novellae on Nedarim, Gittin, and Kiddushin (1952) *Novellae on Yevamos and Ketuvot (1957) Sha'arei Yosher is largely concerned with the intellectual principles by which the law is established, rather than with concrete laws, and is stylistically similar to the Shev Shema'tata of Aryeh Leib HaCohen Heller, on which it was partly based. Death As the Russian army was about to enter Grodno during World War II, Shkop ordered his students to flee to Vilna. He himself died two days later, on the 9th of Cheshvan 5700 (1939) in Grodno. Shkop is buried in the Jewish cemetery in the Zaniemanski Forshtat section of Grodno.

Series history Wulin Warriors: Legend of the Seven Stars is an English language cut of the 25th season of Pili series (Pili Heroes: Battle of the Kings). The series aired in the United States on Cartoon Network's Toonami in February 2006, but was taken off the block due to poor ratings and complaints. The translation had a number of problems: puns were inserted in places they were not present originally, and Scar (known as Ye Hsiao-Chai in the original), was changed from a mute to a dispenser of wisecracks (normally about pizza). Another complaint was that the show aired on a network that airs cartoons. Of the thirteen episodes produced, only two episodes aired in the U.S. before its ultimate cancellation. From 2008 onwards, episodes that were not shown on TV were available on AOL's Kids Online channel until the service shut down. As of 2016, all 14 episodes can be seen on YouTube. According to Toonami co-creator Jason DeMarco, Toonami didn't have any interest in Wulin Warriors, as in the meeting where Animation Collective came to them and said \\"It's this huge show. There's all these episodes. We're making thirteen. We're re-writing them to be right for American audiences!\\", DeMarco said \\"This sounds like a really bad idea!\\". The head of programming for DeMarco at the time asked Toonami's opinion on it, and according to DeMarco, Toonami replied with disdain. However, the head of programming for DeMarco disregarded this sentiment and proceeded with the deal anyway. Characters=Lone Sword Noted as the finest swordsman of his time, Lone Sword is believed to be the future of fighting for the Wulin. Lone Sword grew up as a mere orphan, but was taken into the hands of the Oracle, where he then on dedicated his life to best his skill. It is known that Lone Sword never really interacted with anyone else other than the Oracle, or his best friend Scar. After the loss of the Lord of the Stars, the Oracle sent Lone Sword on the heavy task of finding the Lord of the Stars. The Oracle is said to have great confidence in the abilities of Lone Sword, believing him to be the most promising among the Wulin Warriors. Due to this fact, there is much jealousy between the other Wulin Warriors. Lone Sword has a relationship and bond with his good friend Scar. The truth is that they are brothers, a fact neither know. As Scarab himself was once a Wulin Warrior, seeing a good ally of his own turn against him leaves a personal mark on Lone Sword. Scar A master of the five major schools of fighting, Scar's diverse array of techniques makes up for the prowess of Lone Sword. Scar and Lone Sword were the closest of friends and lived together on the street as mere orphans. It is thought that the scar on Scar's face is there due to a conflict between one of the Seven Stars. This fact may lead up to why he shows so much distrust between them. Scar is also suspicious of Scarab, who he considered power-hungry. Scar also does not think the highest of one of his allies known as Phoenix. Even though Scar bares many grudges, he is still jovial and lighthearted. Scar truly respects the Oracle, and vows to gain its respect. He is voiced by Sean Schemmel. Phoenix The son of Lu Pin, Phoenix, was the former king of the northern lands. However, Phoenix's father, Lu Pin was soon replaced by the Dragon King, who was more popular. Phoenix left his region blemished with shame. Phoenix swore to get revenge against the Dragon King, in which he teamed up with the other Wulin Warriors under the Oracle, in order to become a much greater warrior. However, at the time of Phoenix's first training with the Oracle, he was at a mere age of 6. Even though that was so, he still truly proved himself as a Wulin Warrior. Phoenix greatly looks forward to the day when he will finally take back the throne. Phoenix also puts much pride in his noble birth, believing that it will be the reason to prove that he is the greatest warrior. His subordinates however don't much think so, even though his skills still only rank slightly below that of Scar and Lone Sword. Phoenix soon finds out how much the Oracle truly admires Lone Sword compared to him due to the different balance of skill. Because of this, Phoenix hides deep envy. Yet with all of these flaws, he is still a great friend to the other Wulin Warriors. Phoenix has a very strong sense of self- worth, and takes pride in his great abilities. Because of his envy for Lone Sword, Phoenix was manipulated into joining Scarab's army. Scarab Scarab at one time himself was a Wulin Warrior who joined Oracle at the same time of Lone Sword, and Scar. At that time however, Scarab was the strongest of all the Wulin Warriors, and the favorite of the Oracle, at the time. However, Scarab was unable to show humility and self-sacrifice rather than lust for power, along with failing in a test of compassion. As a result of Scarab's lack of discipline, he was immediately sent into exile. Having to do this truly hurt the Oracle deeply, as Scarab was his most promising student. Scarab then vowed revenge against the Oracle and the rest of the Wulin Warriors. After hearing of the disappearance of the Seven Stars, Scarab knew he had a great opportunity to start a rebellion at that time. After a time, Scarab assembled his own army, and through his great skills at manipulation, he convinced Phoenix himself to join him, effectively becoming his right-hand man. He is voiced by Scottie Ray. The Oracle Even though the Oracle is never truly known at leaving his perch atop the mountain, he still provides a large quality of insight and training to the Wulin Warriors. The Oracle is also seemingly frail, and always demonstrates himself to be a great instructor and molder of young warriors. There however was a rumor passing around at that time that the Oracle was the first Wulin Warrior many generations in the past. The time they are in now is uttered with great confusion, and only the Oracle knows of where the Lord of the Stars truly is. The Oracle also spends most of his time training the Wulin Warriors in order to gain a deep sense of intellect and leadership. The Oracle also provides many prophecies to Lone Sword and Scar, which in the end turn out to be true. The Oracle is voiced by Maddie Blaustein.http://qawithmaddieblaustein.blogspot.com/ Rainbow The seventh member of the Seven Stars hierarchy of the Seven Stars of Wulin, Rainbow, s a female mercenary, and seems to care little about anything else other than her next task at hand.

The Lord of the Stars is counted among as the 1st member of the Seven Stars, along with being the eye of the Great Dragon Constellation, in which each of the other stars orbit. However, since the Lord of the Stars suddenly disappeared, many have begun to believe he may have been kidnapped or killed. The Oracle at one time discussed with the Lord of the Stars about how his power is slowly waning. Due to the fading of the stars, the stars are slowly losing their control over Wu. The era of the Stars is therefore coming to a close. A new era will be born under the Wulin Warriors. The Lord of the Stars having gone into hiding as a result, the Oracle sent Lone Sword and Scar after him. The Lord of the Stars has forced them into the final battle of Wulin, reasoning that they should defeat the Stars or become allies with them.

The fourth series was called You Are What You Eat: Gillian Moves In. Methods The show often uses shock tactics to get the participants to lose weight. In each episode, all food eaten in one week by the person(s) taking part is placed on a table to highlight problem areas of their diet. Another technique is the analysis of the participant's faeces by McKeith to detect certain problems and make them known to the person involved. This aspect of the show gained McKeith the nickname \\"The Awful Poo Lady\\". Emphasising the possibility of the participant's death is sometimes used, with references to children they might not see growing up or a mock grave being prepared. Generally, editions would have these scenes in the first part of the show followed by the participant's attempts to follow McKeith's diet and exercise regimes in the second. The fourth series was expanded from half to one hour programmes, with the contestants moving to McKeith's London house and being visited overnight at their homes for inspection. International versions Localized versions of You Are What You Eat were produced by Viasat and aired in Sweden, Norway, Denmark, Hungary and the Czech Republic. Viasat was the first company in the world to adapt the format locally. MTV3 also produced a local version of the show in Finland. The show was a success and it was the frequently most viewed show in Finland. Controversy In the first series of the show, McKeith was sometimes referred to as \\"Doctor\\", and she has continued to use the title in some media, although the later series referred to her as a \\"holistic nutritionist\\", using the title \\"Ms. Gillian McKeith\\" at some points. It emerged in December 2005 that Gillian McKeith has no accredited doctorate. McKeith received her PhD via a distance learning programme from the American Holistic College of Nutrition, Alabama, which later became the Clayton College of Natural Health before closing in 2011.\\"Gillian McKeith, round 2\\". Goldacre, Ben. Guardian News and Media Limited, 19 August 2004. Retrieved 19 December 2008. The Clayton College of Natural Health stated that it was \\"accredited by the American Association of Drugless Practitioners and the American Naturopathic Medical Accreditation Board\\". However, this accreditation was never recognised by the U.S. Secretary of Education. McKeith is also a member of the American Association of Nutritional Consultants, a controversial organisation which seeks to enhance the reputation of Nutritional and Dietary Consultants by consolidating them into a professional organisation. It offers examination and certification, or association membership which does not require an examination but requires the payment of the $60 membership fee.

The V√¢lve are believed to walk over the hilltops at night, and are subdivided into V√¢lve Albe (\\"White V√¢lve\\"), who are considered beneficial, and V√¢lve Negre (\\"Black V√¢lve\\" or \\"Dark V√¢lve\\"), who are considered evil. In certain contexts, they are believed to have human form (especially when they came to protect villages from a storm). They may also appear under various guises, such as shadows or black cats. They also have the ability to shapeshift. Types of V√¢lve The V√¢lve include several types, among which are: V√¢lva Apei (\\"of the water\\"), considered as a sort of guardian of the water sources and fountains; V√¢lva Bucatelor (roughly, \\"of the morsels\\"), protector of the poor people, and of crops; V√¢lva BƒÉilor (\\"of the mines\\"), defender and protector of mines and tunnels, whose departure means that the deposit is coming to an end; V√¢lva Banilor (\\"of the money\\"), protector of money; V√¢lva Comorilor (\\"of the treasures\\"), protector of treasures, who can also signal the spot where these are buried; V√¢lva PƒÉdurii (\\"of the forest\\"), protector of woodlands, similar to Muma Padurii; V√¢lva Ciumei (\\"of the plague\\"), controlling bubonic plague and other diseases; V√¢lva Zilelor (\\"of the days\\"), protector of the days (there is one for each day of the week); V√¢lva CetƒÉ≈£ilor (\\"of the citadels\\"), defender of ancient ruins. V√¢lve of the mines The best known among oral tradition are, still, the V√¢lve of the mines. Legends about them flourish around traditional metal exploitation areas in Romania, such as Ro≈üia MontanƒÉ, a place extremely rich not only in gold, but also in folklore and myth. There, the people still say that you cannot find any gold in the mines without the help of a V√¢lvƒÉ (which is white). But if one gets too greedy, or spends the money foolishly, or if someone steals the gold or money from the family it was originally revealed to, the V√¢lvƒÉ will become a black one and will not stop until she will avenge the injustice and disrespect to her. Miners say that anyone can hear her knocking through the galleries just in the next corridor, even if there is no knowledge of that place in the rock or if you know for sure no one can be there at that time. She is producing that strange sound to search for gold to show them, or to help them not get lost. If they don't listen to her advice, the galleries collapse on them.

Also illustrated is the Jazz FM chameleon and the \\"Listen in Colour\\" branding. 100.4 Jazz FM (launched as JFM 100.4) was an independent local radio station for the North West England playing jazz music. 100.4 Jazz FM played its own music from its Salford studio during the day, whereas specialist shows like Dinner Jazz and Legends of Jazz with Ramsey Lewis were networked from London's 102.2 Jazz FM. The station was replaced by Smooth FM 100.4 in 2004. History In 1993, Golden Rose Communications was awarded the regional FM licence for the North West, beating ten other applications for the licence. Jazz FM was launched as JFM on 1 September 1994 and broadcast from Exchange Quays, in Salford, England. It was originally known as JFM in order to try to appeal to more listeners who were put off by the \\"jazz\\" in Jazz FM. The station name reverted to Jazz FM, a decision also made to its sister London station in 1995 when Richard Wheatly became chief executive officer for Golden Rose Communications. Jazz FM originally played a wide variety of jazz, pandering to more smooth jazz during the daytime to attract the 25- to 45-year-old target market Jazz FM needed to make the station a success. The station before the rebrand, however, played more soul and softer R&B; alongside jazz. In 2003, the Guardian Media Group did extensive research into the type of music the listeners in the north-west wanted to listen to. They concluded that many people were put off by the name \\"jazz\\" in the station name. As a result, 100.4 Jazz FM closed on 13 February 2004 and relaunched as 'Smooth FM' on 1 March 2004. Smooth FM 100.4 relaunched as Smooth Radio 100.4 in March 2007 at the same time as London based 102.2 Smooth FM. Return to the airwaves Hierarchy of Jazz FM from 1990 to presentOn 28 February 2008 GMG Radio's chief executive John Myers made an announcement that Jazz FM would be brought back in the North West, London and the West Midlands on DAB. Myers also said that he believed it would make more sense for there to be a dedicated radio station for jazz listeners than the commitments to play jazz on Smooth Radio 100.4, as required by the licence granted to them by Ofcom. The closure of theJazz on Digital One was also part of the reason for the return of Jazz FM. The relaunch of jazzfm.com, under a three-year deal with The Local Radio Company happened on 6 October 2008.

She is the wife of crime boss the Kingpin (Wilson Fisk) and the mother of Richard Fisk, although she herself is not portayed as a villain, and does not approve of her husband's criminal activities. Vanessa has been featured in a number of stories about the Kingpin, usually in those revolving around the superheroes Daredevil and Spider-Man. The character has appeared in several media adaptations, including the Netflix television series Daredevil, in which she was portrayed by Ayelet Zurer, and the 2018 animated film, Spider-Man: Into the Spider-Verse, in which she was voiced by Lake Bell. Publication history Created by writer Stan Lee and artist John Romita Sr., she first appeared in The Amazing Spider-Man #70 (March 1969). Fictional character biography Little is known about Vanessa Fisk's personal life and early years other than her maiden name \\"Mariana\\", which was retroactively written into her backstory following the release of the Netflix show. As the wife of Wilson Fisk, the \\"Kingpin\\" of New York's criminal underworld, Vanessa did not approve of her husband's criminal activities. At one point their son Richard Fisk became involved in a plot to overthrow his father's criminal syndicate after discovering he was the Kingpin. After the Kingpin had a near-death experience, Vanessa gave him an ultimatum; he had twenty-four hours to get out of crime, or she would leave him. The Kingpin was about to kill Spider-Man when the deadline passed, and Vanessa forced him to choose between Spider-Man's life or their life together. He chose his wife and spared Spider-Man as a result.The Amazing Spider-Man #197. Marvel Comics. The two went into retirement in Japan. Kingpin prepared to settle his remaining business with his fellow mobsters by cooperating with the authorities and leaving the world of crime forever. This infuriated one of Kingpin's closest advisors, Lynch, who believed that Vanessa was a liability and had turned the once mighty Kingpin into a henpecked husband. When Fisk's former lieutenants in New York caught wind of his plans to sell them out in exchange for immunity, they kidnapped Vanessa, who was in town to secure the legal services of Matt Murdock and Foggy Nelson.Daredevil #170. Marvel Comics. Fisk started a gang war against the mob in New York to rescue his wife. The mob bosses attempted to ransom Vanessa off in exchange for the evidence against them Fisk had intended to turn over to the authorities, but during the exchange, Kingpin used a sonic device to stop the criminals, and found her bound and gagged in a building. However Lynch fired an explosive at Vanessa, in an attempt to deprive Fisk of the thing that kept him retired and bring him back as the Kingpin of Crime. However, she was buried alive in the rubble and presumed dead, although she did not actually die.Daredevil #171. Marvel Comics. As planned, this drove Kingpin back into the world of crime, although he found out Lynch was behind the explosion, partially due to a headache he gained, and took revenge by murdering his traitorous advisor. He then forced the remaining mob leaders to confess to hiring the assassin Bullseye to kill several of Fisk's men.Daredevil #172. Marvel Comics. Weeks later, Matt Murdock's alter ego, Daredevil, found Vanessa in the sewers. Being buried alive had left Vanessa amnesiac and mentally unstable, and she ended up taken in by a grotesque mutant who lived in the sewers. Daredevil ultimately used her as leverage to force Kingpin to order his puppet Randolph Cherryh, newly elected to the office of Mayor, to resign and to confirm to the media that he was indeed a mob puppet. After reuniting with her, Kingpin had his now- catatonic wife shipped off to a sanitarium in Europe in order to have her regain her sanity. This would take years, as Vanessa's husband's organized crime empire would fall and be rebuilt during the period that Vanessa was institutionalized. Ultimately Vanessa would recover, and she would remain in Europe. But when her husband was the victim of an assassination attempt orchestrated by her son, Vanessa arranged for her husband to be shipped out of the country to recover from his injuries, and to cut a deal with his fellow mob bosses to divide up Fisk's recently rebuilt crime syndicate in exchange for a truce. Vanessa then took the final, brutal step of personally murdering her own devoted son, who admitted to Vanessa that his motivation was to rid the family of his father, who he blamed for his family's troubles. The act of murdering her own beloved son caused a horrific physical toll on Vanessa, causing her to slowly lose the will to live, which along with the injuries she sustained when she was buried alive, culminated in her body undergoing terminal organ failure. Blaming both her husband and Matt Murdock, who had recently been revealed to be Daredevil, for the endless cycle of violence that had consumed her family, Vanessa faked the death of Foggy Nelson in an attempt to provoke Murdock into killing Fisk while they were both in prison. When that failed, she manipulated the superhero Iron Fist into posing as Daredevil, which ultimately drove Matt to break out of prison to find Foggy's murderer and the identity of the man impersonating him, culminating in her confronting Matt with an offer to clear his name in exchange for him clearing Kingpin, so that the two would be free to try and kill each other anew.Daredevil vol. 2 #92. Marvel Comics. Though Daredevil refused this deal, Vanessa went ahead and arranged for the murder of Leland Drummond, the corrupt FBI director who outed Matt in order to advance his own career within the FBI. To discredit his outing of Daredevil, the murder was made to look like a suicide and a false and highly damning suicide note was planted at the scene, claiming that Drummond took his own life after it became apparent that his scheme to frame Matt Murdock was about to be exposed. Shortly afterwards, Vanessa died and Murdock found himself morally guilted into serving as the Kingpin's lawyer, getting the charges dropped on the grounds that the evidence was too tainted to bring him to court. But Daredevil would exact his own form of a Faustian bargain with Kingpin, as he forced the crime boss to renounce his American citizenship and leave the country forever in exchange for his nemesis' legal services, stating that any attempt to continue their vendetta would be an insult to the memory of the good woman Vanessa had once been.Daredevil vol. 2 #93. Marvel Comics. Wilson Fisk is later seen at her grave where he breaks down emotionally. She has since been talking to Wilson as a ghostly vision taunting him that he will never regain his former glory, an indication that her death still greatly affects him. The Arbiters bring Vanessa back as a revenant as a part of a test intended to gauge the Kingpin's worth as the head of the Hand. Reluctant to combat his wife, Fisk tries to appeal to whatever humanity that she may still have left in her, and kills her when she still flings her weapons at him, unaware that she was actually aiming at the assassin who was approaching him from behind.

After the fight is over, Matt forces Fisk to return to jail and leave Karen and Foggy alone under threat of Vanessa's role in Nadeem's death being exposed. Vanessa is last seen being taken away by the police as Brett Mahoney refuses to let Fisk give her one last goodbye as Nadeem \\"didn't say goodbye\\" to his own wife. Film Vanessa Fisk appears in Spider-Man: Into the Spider-Verse, voiced by Lake Bell. This version never knew about her husband's criminal activities, until she and Richard Fisk witnessed him fighting Spider- Man, and fled in horror. While driving away, Vanessa and Richard were hit by an oncoming truck and killed. This motivated Wilson to create a particle accelerator in order to find alternate versions of his family in other universes. Novel Vanessa Fisk appears in the novel Spider-Man: Forever Young written by Stefan Petrucha, a retelling of the Tablet storyline that introduced Silvermane. The novel also includes a follow-up story set a couple of years later, when Vanessa asks Spider-Man to help her retrieve the tablet from a restored Silvermane so that she can use it to cure her husband- currently in a trauma-induced coma- with Vanessa offering to use her resources to help the ill May Parker in the process (aware that Peter Parker and Spider- Man are connected without knowing that they are the same man). At the tale's conclusion, Vanessa abandons the idea of using the tablet after witnessing what it has done to Silvermane, who is left randomly aging through his use of the serum, but she nevertheless covers May's medical bills as agreed, leaving a message for Parker that he lived up to his end of their arrangement and she acknowledges that he is not at fault that the tablet has been confirmed to not be an option.

When the system was implemented in 2004, the government promoted it with a major public campaign, including the slogan \\"Remember the Numbers; Make Driving Easier\\" (). The system comprises nine major series of roads in Hong Kong, numbered routes 1 to 5 and 7 to 10, which can be classified into three categories: the three north-south routes, the five east-west routes and the New Territories Circular Road. The route numbers are displayed as black on yellow \\"road-shields\\" on overhead roadsigns. The entirety of the system offers some level of limited access, with a significant portion being expressway. The system also utilises exit numbering with the exits of each route are numbered sequentially; some exit numbers are suffixed with a letter. Exit numbers are indicated by white-in-black rectangular boxes on overhead and roadside signs. Features There are no traffic lights on the expressways. Traffic interchange with other roads is entirely via slip roads, maximising vehicular flow and land space usage. There are some stack interchanges. The Strategic Route System has traffic lights on only a few roads, such as Waterloo Road (Route 1) and Kwun Tong Road (Route 7). The road surface is asphalt. The lanes are separated by white dashed lines, while unbroken white lines are used to mark the edges of the median and shoulder. The shoulder is reserved for stops due to breakdowns and emergencies, and motorists are prohibited by law from travelling on it. Lanes are numbered from right to left, with lane 1 being the closest to the median. Crash barriers, cat's eyes and rumble strips are also used to ensure road safety. Signs mark the start and end of an expressway at its entry and exit points respectively. These expressways do not have rest areas. The speed limits for most vehicles (see the paragraph below for exceptions) on the Hong Kong highways are 110 km/h for North Lantau Expressway, 100 km/h for the New Territories roads and West Kowloon Highway, 80 km/h for the most expressways and 70 km/h, due to the older ones such as Island Eastern Corridor, East Kowloon Corridor, West Kowloon Corridor and Tsuen Wan Road. A speeding offence less than 10 km/h over the speed limit is not usually enforced ‚Äì many drivers in Hong Kong travel within this range. Cameras will shoot when it is above 15 km/h, with their fines imposed. As stipulated by the Laws of Hong Kong Cap 374 s 40 (5) and (5A), medium goods vehicles, heavy goods vehicles and buses or any vehicle driven by a driver with a probationary driving licence shall travel no faster than the speed limit of the road or 70 km/h, whichever is slower; while minibuses shall travel no faster than the speed limit of the road or 80 km/h, whichever is slower. Many vehicles of these types actually ignore this and simply follow the speed limit of the road on the Hong Kong highways, thereby committing speeding offence. However, this law is not usually enforced ‚Äì cameras are not tuned to be triggered differently by these types of vehicle. Route number system The \\"Exit 2\\" and \\"Route 5\\" signs at the entrance of Kai Tak Tunnel The three north-south routes are Route 1, Route 2, and Route 3. They connect Hong Kong Island, metro Kowloon and the New Territories via a series of flyovers and tunnels. They pass through the three tunnels crossing Victoria Harbour, and their sequence of numbering follows the order of opening dates of the three tunnels: *Route 1: Cross-Harbour Tunnel (opened 1972) *Route 2: Eastern Harbour Tunnel (opened 1989; formerly Route 6) *Route 3: Western Harbour Crossing (opened 1997) The five east-west routes ‚Äî Route 4, Route 5, Route 7, Route 8 and Route 10 ‚Äî are numbered from south to north. The pattern indicates that Route 6 will most likely be built between Routes 5 and 7. Route 4 runs along the north shore of Hong Kong Island, connecting the eastern and western ends of the island, whereas Routes 5 and 7 link southern New Territories with parts of Kowloon. Route 8 provides direct access to Chek Lap Kok Airport, and was extended to Sha Tin in 2008. Route 10 provides access to the border crossing at Shekou, Shenzhen. *Route 4: formerly Routes 7 and 8 (opened 1990) *Route 5: formerly Tsuen Wan ‚Äì Ngau Tau Kok section of Route 2 (opened 1970-1980s) *Route 7: formerly Route 4 (opened 1970s) *Route 8: formerly Route 9 (Tsing Yi ‚Äì Airport section opened 1997; Tsing Yi ‚Äì Cheung Sha Wan section opened December 2009; Cheung Sha Wan ‚Äì Sha Tin section opened 2008) *Route 10 (opened 2007) The circular route, Route 9, circumscribes the New Territories, with the exit at the Shing Mun Tunnels in Sha Tin as the starting point of exit-numbering. It links up the network of expressways and trunk roads in the New Territories into a large ring. *Route 9: formerly Route 5 + Fo Tan ‚Äì Lok Ma Chau section of Route 1 + Tsuen Wan ‚Äì Lok Ma Chau section of Route 2 (construction from 1974‚Äì2007) Exit number system In parallel with route numbering, the junctions between routes and exits from routes are also labelled with exit numbers. On every route, exits are numbered from one end to the other with ascending consecutive integers with a mixture of alphabet-suffixed labels (1, 2, 2A, 2B, 3, 4... etc.), similar in function to UK motorway junction markers. History=First generation The first generation of the route number system in Hong Kong was envisaged in the 1968 Hong Kong Long Term Road Study by Freeman, Fox, Wilbur Smith & Associates, in which trunk routes were given single-digit numbers, and distributors with double-digit ones. Also included in the road study was an unnumbered Western Harbour Crossing (WHC), which in the plan involved a bridge crossing the Victoria Harbour between Cherry Street in Mong Kok and Kennedy Town, by way of Stonecutters Island and Green Island. Numbered routes included in the study were: *1: Aberdeen to Fanling, via Aberdeen Tunnel, Cross Harbour Tunnel, Lion Rock Tunnel, Tai Po Road **11: Ngau Tau Kok to Butterfly Valley Interchange, via Prince Edward Road East, Prince Edward Road West and Lai Chi Kok Road for westbound, Cheung Sha Wan Road and Boundary Street for eastbound **12: Kowloon City to Mong Kok, via Argyle Street and Cherry Street, connecting to WHC **14: connecting routes 1 and 4, via Choi Hung Road and Po Kong Village Road *2: Junction between route 1 and Chatham Road to Sheung Shui, via Gascoigne Road, West Kowloon Corridor, Kwai Chung Road, Tsuen Wan Road, Tuen Mun Road, Castle Peak Road **21: Chatham Road South **22: Ferry Street and Canton Road **23: Nathan Road and Tai Po Road until Tai Wo Ping Interchange *3: Junction between route 1 and Chatham Road to Yau Tong via Kai Tak Tunnel (then Airport Tunnel) and Kwun Tong Road **31: Ma Tau Wai Road and Ma Tau Chung Road *4: Butterfly Valley Interchange to Kwun Tong, via Ching Cheung Road, Lung Cheung Road and a suggested flyover of what was to become Kwun Tong Bypass **41: Kwun Tong to Tseung Kwan O (then Junk Bay) **42: Choi Hung Interchange to Clear Water Bay *5: Kwai Chung to Sha Tin, via what was to become Shing Mun Tunnels *6: Castle Peak Road, Kwai Chung and Tsuen Wan sections *7: Aberdeen to Causeway Bay, via suggested road between Aberdeen and Kennedy Town, Connaught Road, Harcourt Road and Gloucester Road **71: Pok Fu Lam Road, Third Street and Water Street *8: Causeway Bay to Chai Wan via suggested flyover above King's Road; predecessor to present-day Island Eastern Corridor **81: Chai Wan to Wong Chuk Hang by way of Tai Tam and Repulse Bay; never built Second generation The second generation of route numbers came into use in 1974. All distributors lost their numbers, retaining only trunk routes in the system. It was replaced in 2004 by the present-day third generation. At the new system's conception, some numbers were reserved for future road plans at that time. There were 11 routes in the system, of which nine (routes 1 to 9) were used as of 2004. *1: Aberdeen to Lok Ma Chau, 47.3 km, previously route 1. Split into routes 1 and 9 *2: Ngau Tau Kok to San Tin, 54.4 km, previously routes 2 and 3. Split into routes 5 and 9 *3: Sai Ying Pun to Au Tau, 27.7 km. Still route 3 today *4: Lai Chi Kok to Tseung Kwan O, via Kwun Tong Road, 17 km. Today's route 7 *5: Tsuen Wan to Sha Tin Racecourse, 9.5 km. Part of route 9 today *6: Tai Koo Shing to Ma Liu Shui, via Kwun Tong Bypass and Tate's Cairn Tunnel, 19.5 km. Today's route 2 *7: Causeway Bay to Aberdeen, 13.5 km, previously also route 7. Merged with route 8 to form today's route 4 *8: Island Eastern Corridor, 9.6 km, previously also route 8. Merged with route 7 to form today's route 4 *9: Chek Lap Kok to Tai Wai, 33.7 km. Today's route 8 *10: Green Island to Shenzhen Bay, 29.5 km. Still route 10 today *11: West Kowloon to Tseung Kwan O, via Central Kowloon Route, 14 km. Today's route 6, still under planning Third generation The third generation of route numbers came into use in 2004, and is the system used at present.

In a career spanning more than 40 years, Smash came to prominence in the late 1970s as the backing vocalist, trumpet player and dancer for the English band Madness. In addition to trumpet, Smyth plays the bass guitar (having initially joined Madness as a bassist), acoustic guitar and other various percussion instruments. He occasionally performs the lead vocals, such as on the songs \\"Michael Caine\\", \\"Wings of a Dove\\", \\"One Step Beyond\\" and \\"Madness (Is All in the Mind)\\". He was initially an occasional songwriter, but became a more regular contributor over the course of Madness's career and was credited as co-writer on the band's major international hit, \\"Our House\\". Early years Cathal Joseph Smyth was born on 14 January 1959, in Middlesex Hospital, Fitzrovia, London, England, and grew up in Marylebone. As a child he went by the name of Carl. His parents were Irish immigrants. His father worked in the oil business and moved the family from Ireland to England, and then to the Middle East because of his work. The Smyths were competitive Irish dancers, and Cathal grew up around dance, but never took much of an interest until he began to dance as a performer. In 1976, the North London Invaders recruited Smyth to play the bass guitar with them when he was only 17 years old, but he was replaced a year later by Gavin Rogers. During the late seventies, Cathal became friends with members of the band Madness, and performed as a dancer onstage at their concerts. Music career In 1980, Smyth became the last of the seven original Madness members to join the band. He soon moved on to playing other instruments instead of bass. After Madness broke up in 1986, he formed a new short-lived band The Madness in 1988 along with Suggs, Lee Thompson and Chris Foreman. In 1990, Cathal became an executive for Go Discs where, at his suggestion, the label signed The Stairs. He was also responsible for reforming Madness in 1992 for Madstock!, but he left Go Discs to reform the band. In 1989/1990, he became friends with former Smiths singer Morrissey, who had once asked him to be his manager. Smyth declined, claiming that \\"I didn't fancy having to iron his socks.\\" Smyth introduced Morrissey to Boz Boorer, who went on to work with him from 1991 onwards. Cathal is also the subject of the 1992 Morrissey single, \\"You're the One for Me, Fatty\\". He also provided backing vocals on Morrissey's version of the Jam's \\"That's Entertainment\\". Cathal also had a small part in Suggs' solo career, co-writing the song \\"Green Eyes,\\" and he also performed backing vocals on The Lone Ranger album. In 1999, Smyth formed and fronted the folk-influenced band The Velvet Ghost, which played at the Fleadh festival in 2000. In 2002, Cathal started up his own record label, Rolled Gold Records (RGR Music), at an office in Camden Town. He released a debut single, \\"We're Coming Over\\", with The England Supporters Band (billed as Mr. Smash & Friends) and it reached number 67 in the UK Singles Charts. RGR released an album and three singles by London rapper, Just Jack. The label also released material by dance and rap artists Autamata and Border Crossing. In 2004, after briefly moving his office to Islington, he closed RGR. In 2009 Madness released their first album of new material in ten years, The Liberty of Norton Folgate. About this time, Smyth was rumoured to be working on several solo projects, including a dubstep album, according to Mojo. In 2012 Madness followed up \\"Norton Folgate\\" with Oui Oui, Si Si, Ja Ja, Da Da. His debut solo album, A Comfortable Man, was released in May 2015 and it reached no.68 in the UK album chart. In 2016 Madness released Can't Touch Us Now, the first Madness album since One Step Beyond to be recorded without Smyth being credited as a member of the band. Personal life Smyth became a Freemason in 1994. After being a couple since their teen years, Smyth and his wife of 28 years, Joanna Brown, separated in 2005. He has three grown-up children from the marriage: Caspar, Milo, and Eloise. He appeared with Eloise at the 2012 Q Awards ceremony. After his marriage ended, Smyth started to practise Transcendental Meditation. He also spent time in rehab in Arizona and moved to Ibiza in 2008.

She was given the name 'Annapurna' by former Maharaja Brijnath Singh of the former Maihar Estate (M.P.), and it was by this name that she was popularly known. She was the daughter and disciple of Allauddin Khan, the founder of Maihar gharana, and Madina Bibi and the first wife of the sitar player, Ravi Shankar. After her separation from Ravi Shankar, she moved to Bombay and never performed again in public. She remained a private person, yet continued to teach music for free. Her students include many notable disciples including Hariprasad Chaurasia, Nityanand Haldipur and Nikhil Banerjee. Biography Annapurna Devi was born on 15 April 1927 [confirmed by Lajo ji] at Maihar, a small princely state of British India (now a part of Madhya Pradesh, India). Her father Alauddin Khan was a royal court musician at the court of Maharaja Brijnath Singh, who named the newborn girl 'Annapurna'. Her father and guru Alauddin Khan, founder of the \\"Senia Maihar gharana\\" or \\"Senia Maihar School\\" of Hindustani classical music, was a noted musician and guru of Indian classical music. Her uncles, Fakir Aftabuddin Khan and Ayet Ali Khan, were noted musicians at their native place Shibpur, in the present-day Bangladesh. Her brother Ali Akbar Khan was a legendary Sarod maestro and was considered a \\"national living treasure\\" in India and the USA. Annapurna was initially instructed by her father in the sitar and vocals. She then switched to the surbahar which she played in the traditional style of a rudra veena. One of her earliest concerts of note was with the surbahar when she played in honour of the Raja of Maihar. She was rewarded with a large tract of land for her performance. Annapurna Devi married renowned sitarist, Ravi Shankar, on 15 May 1941 in Almora and divorced him in October 1982. Between 1946 and 1955, Annapurna appeared on stage with Shankar in a handful of sitar-surbahar duets in Delhi and Bombay (now Mumbai). They had a son, Shubhendra Shankar (1942‚Äì1992), who was also a musician. Annapurna married Rooshikumar Pandya in Bombay on 9 December 1982. Rooshikumar Pandya, who was 42 years old at the time of their marriage, was a well known communication expert and a successful sitarist in the United States. Rooshikumar had been learning sitar from her since 1973 at the recommendation of her brother, Ali Akbar Khan, who was also his guru (as was Ravi Shankar). He died in 2013 suddenly of a cardiac arrest at the age of 73.https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/city/kolkata/Every-Note-Annapurna-Devi- Plays-Is-Like-An-Offering-Rooshikumar- Pandya/articleshow/41890785.cmshttp://archive.indianexpress.com/news/death-of- a-caregiver/1108875/ Annapurna Devi died of age related issues on 13 October 2018 in Mumbai. Career Annapurna Devi became a very accomplished surbahar (bass sitar) player of the Maihar gharana (school) within a few years of starting to take music lessons from her father Alauddin Khan. She started guiding many of her father's disciples, including Nikhil Banerjee and Bahadur Khan, in classical music as well as in the techniques and intricacies of instrumental performances. In 1941, age 14, she married one of her father's talented students, Ravi Shankar. She converted to Hinduism upon marriage.\\"Unveiling the mystique of a reclusive artiste\\", The Hindu - 28 June 2005 In the 1950s, Ravi Shankar and Annapurna Devi performed duets in Delhi and Calcutta, principally at the college of her brother, Ali Akbar Khan. But later, Shankar she decided not to reduce and finally stop performing in public. Her student Vinay Ram says that she was uncomfortable accepting payment for concerts, as it was her belief that it was akin to selling Saraswati (the Goddess of learning). Devi and Shankar's son, Shubhendra Shankar, (or \\"Subho\\", as he was popularly known) received rigorous training in sitar under her tutelage, until his father chose to interrupt his musical talim or training and took him to the United States. Shubhendra died at an early age, after a marriage and the birth of three children. Shubhendra did not have a solo career in classical music, but did for a period accompany his illustrious father Ravi Shankar in concerts in the USA and abroad. As per one of her students Vinay Ram, a conflict regarding the upbringing and musical teaching of Subho was the main reason for Devi and Shankar's separation, though they continued to remain in touch on amicable terms till the end. Teaching Annapurna Devi was an acclaimed instructor and one of the first women gurus of note in modern times. Her pupils were not restricted solely to sitar or surbahar players and encompassed various fields in Hindustani classical music. They included the sitarists Debi Prasad Chatterji, Bahadur Khan (a cousin), Hiren Roy, Indranil Bhattacharya, Kartik Kumar, and Nikhil Banerji, the sarodists, Dhyanesh Khan and Ashis Khan (sons of Ali Akbar), Basant Kabra,Pradeep Barot and Suresh Vyas, the bansuri players, Hariprasad Chaurasia and Nityanand Haldipur, the dilruba artist Dakshina Mohan Tagore, and the violinist Satyadev Pawar. She was also the key figure of Acharya Alauddin Music Circle (an association in the memory of the late Alauddin Khan for promoting Indian classical music), in Mumbai. Honours * 1977, she received the Padma Bhushan (India's third highest civilian honour). * 1991, she received the Sangeet Natak Akademi Award (the highest Indian honour in performing arts). She is the only surbahar player to be so honoured. * 1999, the Desikottama, an honorary doctorate degree by Visva-Bharati University. * In 2004, she was made a fellow of the Sangeet Natak Akademi.

He was one of the \\"Big Four\\" founding professors at the Johns Hopkins Hospital.Johns Hopkins Medicine:The Four Founding Professors. Hopkinsmedicine.org. Retrieved on 2012-03-12. He was the first dean of the Johns Hopkins School of Medicine and was also the founder of the Johns Hopkins School of Hygiene and Public Health, the first school of public health in the country. Welch was more known for his cogent summations of current scientific work, than his own scientific research. The Johns Hopkins medical school library is also named after Welch. In his lifetime, he was called the \\"Dean of American Medicine\\" and received various awards and honors throughout his lifetime, and posthumously. Biography=Early life He was born on April 8, 1850, to William Wickham Welch and Emeline Collin Welch in Norfolk, Connecticut. He had a long family history of physicians and surgeons, starting with his grandfather Benjamin Welch. Benjamin was also on the medical forefront of his time, establishing his county's medical association. William H. Welch was educated at Norfolk Academy and the Winchester Institute, a boarding school. His father and a grandfather and four of his uncles were all physicians. William Henry entered Yale University in 1866, where he studied Greek and classics. Initially, Welch was not interested in becoming a physician; his primary ambition was to teach the Greek language. He received an A.B. degree in 1870. As an undergraduate, he joined the Skull and Bones fraternity.William Henry Welch and the Heroic Age of American Medicine by Simon Flexner and James Thomas Flexner Johns Hopkins University Press (1993). Early career After a short period of teaching high-school students in Norwich, New York, Welch went to study medicine at the Columbia University College of Physicians and Surgeons, in Manhattan. In 1875, he received his MD. From 1876 to 1877, he studied at several German laboratories to work with, among others, Julius Cohnheim and Rudolf Virchow. This experience abroad prompted Welch to model his plans for a new medical institute on the Institute of the History of Medicine at the University of Leipzig. He returned to America in 1877 and opened a lab at Bellevue Medical College (now a part of New York University Medical School).  Later career at Johns Hopkins  Welch is widely known at the time for his pathology residency program, which later attracted many bright minds from across the country. In 1884, he was the first physician recruited to be a professor at the newly forming Johns Hopkins Hospital and Medical School at Johns Hopkins University in Baltimore. By 1886, he had 16 graduate physicians working in his laboratory ‚Äì the first postgraduate training program for physicians in the country. He helped the trustees recruit the other founding physicians for the hospital ‚Äì William Stewart Halsted, William Osler, and Howard Kelly. Welch became head of the Department of Pathology when the hospital opened in 1889. In 1893, he also became the first dean of the Johns Hopkins University School of Medicine, and in 1916, he established and led the Johns Hopkins School of Hygiene and Public Health, the first school of public health in the country. During this time, Welch was also involved in creating a new medical library for Johns Hopkins. He embarked on a sabbatical in Europe, where he visited the University of Leipzig's Institute and various other universities, as well as libraries and bookstores. These German institutions influenced Welch's design for the Institute of the History of Medicine at Johns Hopkins, which was established in October 1929.Institute of the History of Medicine history. Welch.jhu.edu. Retrieved on 2012-03-12. The new institute also built on the already existing Johns Hopkins Hospital Historical Club (est. 1890), of which Welch had been a co-founder. Welch is also the founding editor-in-chief of the American Journal of Epidemiology. Caricature of William Welch with his students, by Max Br√∂del, 1910 Graduates of Welch's training programs were highly coveted as academic physicians. Medical schools and institutes across the country vied for Welch's former students and graduate scientists to fill top posts. Many of his residents went on to become highly prominent physicians, including Walter Reed, co-discoverer of the cause of yellow fever, Simon Flexner, founding director of the Rockefeller Institute for Medical Research, and future Nobel laureates George Whipple and Peyton Rous. Welch's research was principally in bacteriology, and he is the discoverer of the organism that causes gas gangrene. It was named Clostridium welchii in recognition of that fact, but now the organism usually is designated as Clostridium perfringens. From 1901 to 1933, he was founding president of the Board of Scientific Directors at the Rockefeller Institute for Medical Research. He was an instrumental reformer of medical education in the United States as well as a president of the National Academy of Sciences from 1913‚Äì1917. He also was president of the American Medical Association, the Association of American Physicians, the History of Science Society, the Congress of American Physicians and Surgeons, the Society of American Bacteriologists, and the Maryland State Board of Health. Welch was a founding editor of the Journal of Experimental Medicine. Welch served in the U.S. Army Medical Corps during World War I, and played a major role in the response to the 1918 Influenza Pandemic. He remained in the Reserve Corps for three years thereafter, attaining the rank of brigadier general (07). For his service during the war, Welch received the Distinguished Service Medal.  Death  Welch died on April 30, 1934, at the age of 84, of prostatic adenocarcinoma at Johns Hopkins Hospital.

Early life Watt was born in Marylebone, London and grew up in Barnes, the son of Scottish jazz bandleader and arranger Tommy Watt and showbusiness writer Romany Bain. He has four older half brothers and sisters. Recording artist Watt began recording in 1981 on the indie label Cherry Red. His first single 'Cant' was produced by folk-maverick Kevin Coyne and featured Richard Allen on viola and tambourine. His second release, 1982's 5-track EP Summer into Winter featured Robert Wyatt on backing vocals and piano. His debut album North Marine Drive was released in 1983 and reached UK Independent Album Charts Top 10. He then put his solo career on hold and joined forces with vocalist Tracey Thorn, with whom he wrote and recorded for 17 years‚Äîtogether they created nine studio albums as Everything but the Girl (EBTG) after signing to Blanco Y Negro through Warners in 1984, and then Virgin in 1995. EBTG have received eight gold, and one platinum album BPI Certifications in the UK, and one gold album RIAA Certification in the US. The song Missing reached number two on the US Billboard Hot 100 in 1996. Following EBTG's self-imposed hiatus in 2000, Watt immersed himself in the world of underground electronic music both as a DJ and recording artist/producer. His recorded output during this period includes club tracks such as Lone Cat (Holding On), A Stronger Man featuring Sananda Maitreya (formerly known as Terence Trent D'Arby), the Outspoken EP Part 1 including Pop A Cap in Yo' Ass featuring Estelle, Just a Blip and Guinea Pig. In 2014 Watt returned to his folk-jazz roots and released Hendra, his first solo album since 1983, the content of which was recorded with a new band including Bernard Butler, formerly of the band Suede‚ÄîWatt explained that he knew that Butler would be the \\"perfect counterpoint to bring some darkness to the light.\\" Watt also worked with Berlin-based producer Ewan Pearson and David Gilmour of Pink Floyd. The album is released on a new record label, Unmade Road, founded by Watt in 2014. Watt completed over sixty live shows in support of Hendra including tours of UK, North America, Japan and Australia. The album won the 'Best 'Difficult' Second Album' category at the AIM Independent Music Awards 2014. It was included at No 27 in Uncut's Top 75 Albums of 2014. Rolling Stone (Germany) made it their No 2 best album of 2014. Japan's Music Magazine made it their No 3 best album of 2014. April 2016 saw the release of his third solo album Fever Dream. Self-produced at RAK Studios in London, it continued his relationship with Bernard Butler, and added guest cameos from MC Taylor of North Carolina folk-rock band, Hiss Golden Messenger, and Boston singer-songwriter Marissa Nadler. It received a 9/10 review in Uncut magazine. In a four-star review, The Guardian said: 'In his early 50s, he is making some of the best music of his career.' Writer Watt's first memoir Patient - The True Story of a Rare Illness (Penguin, 1996) describes his life-changing ordeal with Churg-Strauss syndrome (Eosinophilic granulomatosis with polyangiitis), a rare life-threatening auto-immune disease with which he was diagnosed and hospitalized in 1992, on the eve of a North American tour with Everything But The Girl. \\"An astonishingly assured anatomy of his ordeal, by turns terrifying, mordantly funny and intensely moving. Many people suffer the pain and indignities of intensive medical treatment; but few have written about it with quite such alarming vividness or clarity\\", wrote Mick Bown in The Daily Telegraph. The book was listed as a New York Times Notable Book of the Year, a Sunday Times Book of the Year chosen by William Boyd and a Village Voice Literary Supplement Favorite Book of the Year, and was also a finalist for the Esquire-Waterstones Best Non-Fiction Award in the UK. His second memoir, Romany and Tom‚Äîa portrait of his parents' lives and marriage‚Äîwas published by Bloomsbury in February 2014. \\"Neither sentimental nor savage, yet often wise, moving and entertaining within the same paragraph, Romany and Tom is a major achievement to rival any of Watt's recordings,\\" said The Guardian. \\"Watt captures what real life feels like, and he captures it with breathtaking clarity, beauty, and precision,\\" said the Los Angeles Review of Books. In September 2014 it was long-listed for the Samuel Johnson Prize 2014. DJ, remixer, label owner=Lazy Dog (1998‚Äì2003) In 1998 Watt established the London deep house Sunday club night and compilation series Lazy Dog with Jay Hannan. The club night - where both Watt and Hannan DJ'd in a tag-team style - was hosted twice-monthly at the Notting Hill Arts Club in west London, and later every two months at The End in central London. Success led to appearances at the Miami Winter Music Conference and several tours of the United States. Watt produced a string of dance remixes for Sade, Sunshine Anderson, Zero 7, Maxwell, Meshell Ndegeocello and Sandy Rivera. Lazy Dog ended on 16 May 2003 with a farewell closing party at The End in central London. Two mix compilations - Lazy Dog Vol. 1 and Lazy Dog Vol. 2 were released by Virgin Records in 2000 and 2001 respectively. Neighbourhood and Cherry Jam (2002‚Äì2005) For three years between 2002 and 2005, Watt was a co-owner/founder of the West London nightclubs Neighbourhood and Cherry Jam. Under Watt's creative direction Cherry Jam hosted underground club nights, art exhibitions, the inaugural events for the long-running spoken word night Book Slam and The Libertines' official debut show. At Neighbourhood, Watt brought in artists such as Groove Armada and many international DJs to perform at his own in-house club nights. Watt also hosted the 25th Anniversary of the Rough Trade Records music label and the inaugural House Music Awards ceremony. Buzzin' Fly Records (2003‚Äìpresent) In April 2003, Watt launched his own independent deep house and techno record label Buzzin' Fly Records (named after the Tim Buckley song). The label proceeded to foster the careers of young and emerging producers/DJs such as Justin Martin, Mademoiselle Caro & Franck Garcia, and Rodamaal. The label hosted Watt's own club productions as well as work from remixers such as Ame, Radio Slave, Charles Webster and John Tejada. Between 2003-2007 Watt also compiled and mixed four compilation albums, Buzzin' Fly Volumes 1‚Äì4, mixing tracks from the label with tracks from other artists. Buzzin' Fly won Best Breakthrough Label at the House Music Awards in 2004, and was awarded the Runner-Up Best British Label by the DJ Magazine Awards in both 2007 and 2008. In April 2013, on the label's tenth anniversary, Watt announced he was scaling back the label's activities to focus more fully on his own creative work. After a period of relative inactivity in 2017 Buzzin' Fly took control of the majority of the Everything But The Girl back catalogue, previously held by Warner Music. The transfer of rights was the result of Warner Music's obligation to release assets into the independent sector as part of the conditions surrounding its acquisition of EMI assets from Universal Music. A licensing deal with Chrysalis Records was simultaneously arranged for the shared curation of the catalogue. A new Buzzin' Fly website was launched the same year presenting a new home for all three labels within the Buzzin' Fly group - Buzzin' Fly, Strange Feeling and Unmade Road. DJ After several years of mostly London residencies, Watt performed as a DJ on the festival circuit in 2005, appearing at the Good Vibrations Festival in Australia, Homelands and Lovebox in the UK, Coachella in the US, and Ireland's Electric Picnic. In 2008 he opened the Sonar Festival in Barcelona, appeared at the Exit Festival the same year and was a resident DJ from 2007‚Äì2009 at We Love Sundays on the Space Terrace in Ibiza. Giant Step promoted his three-year residency at Cielo in New York, and he played on the main stage at the inaugural Electric Zoo Festival on New York City's Randall's Island in 2009. He was nominated four years running (2008-2011) as Best Deep House DJ at the global DJ Awards held in Ibiza, and for Outstanding Contribution to Dance Music at the DJ Magazine Best of British Awards 2009. Strange Feeling Records (2007‚Äìpresent) Building upon the foundation of Buzzin' Fly, Watt launched Strange Feeling Records in 2007 as a sister label that would release alternative/indie music. The critically acclaimed Copenhagen band Figurines and the Hungarian trio The Unbending Trees were early signings of Strange Feeling. In 2010 the label globally released and distributed the third solo album Love and Its Opposite by Watt's wife Tracey Thorn on 17 May 2010‚Äîthe album was the label's fifth release. This was followed by her alternative Christmas album, Tinsel and Lights, in 2012. 2015 saw the release of Thorn's original soundtrack to The Falling - the debut feature film by British film director Carol Morley. Unmade Road (2014‚Äìpresent) In 2014 Watt launched Unmade Road, a new label and production company to act as a vehicle for his return to recording and touring as a singer-songwriter. He secured a licensing deal for the label with Caroline International. The label released Watt's albums Hendra in 2014 and Fever Dream in 2016. Radio presenter In 2006 Watt launched the online Buzzin' Fly radio show to showcase upcoming music from the label, new releases and guest mixes. It was re-broadcast on the Galaxy Network and Kiss. In 2009, after more than 150 editions, Watt presented his last show and accepted an invitation to move the BBC Radio 6 Music's flagship electronic radio show as a resident DJ on the 6 Mix until it was cancelled in 2014. Personal life Watt lives with his spouse and creative partner Tracey Thorn in Hampstead, north London. They met at Hull University in 1981; after 27 years together, they married in 2008 at the Chelsea Register Office. Their twin daughters Jean and Alfie were born in 1998, and their son Blake was born in 2001. In 1992, Watt was diagnosed with Eosinophilic granulomatosis with polyangiitis (EGPA), an extremely rare and potentially deadly autoimmune condition. He eventually had 5 m (15 ft) of necrotized small intestine removed (about 75%), leaving him on a permanently restricted diet. He later wrote the memoir Patient about his experiences with the disease and recovery.

Black Stallion started out as a stock 1982 Ford F350 back in 1982, owned and modified by Michael Vaters. The first modification was a homemade 12\\" lift kit, since such kits were unavailable at the time. Mike then later added two sunroofs, an Alpine stereo system, a Ford 460 Engine, Rockwell 5 ton toploaders, Clark 20 ton planetaries, 66\\" terra tires, a 9\\" television and later on, a 1988 Ford F series front end. Between 1990 and 1991, Mike realized the future of monster trucks, which was racing. To be competitive, Mike replaced the leaf springs with airbags, the old heavy split ring rims with lightweight one piece rims, fiberglass body pieces, cutting the tires, gutting the interior out, 4 linking the truck and putting in a bigger engine. The modifications proved to be beneficial to Mike, with close races with First Blood, and competing in some Pendaliner Special Events racing events. After a violent rollover in Bloomsburg Pennsylvania in 1991, Mike decided to put King shocks on the truck, which he later added coil springs in 1992. Along with the coil springs, Mike also removed the airbags. Mike is credited as the first owner to use bypass shocks. Also for 1992, Mike changed the front clip to a 1992 Ford F-series front end. Mike rarely ran this truck after he built the popular Boogey Van in 1993, driven by his then wife, Pam Vaters. Due to this, the truck was nicknamed Rodney, after the comedian, Rodney Dangerfield. Mike then built a truck for the 1996 season for research and development, named Black Stallion 2000, since his crew members joked about Mike not building a new truck for himself until the new millennium. This chassis is still running strong to this day. For his 20th anniversary, Mike decided to repaint Black stallion, with the front of the truck yellow, going into black with a horse face painted on. The truck currently has the same paint scheme. The drivers for 2016 are Michael Vaters & Matt Cody. Vaters will compete in the Fox Sports 1 Championship Series. Cody will travel to Birmingham, Toronto, Newark, Charleston, Columbia, Worcester, Wheeling & Baton Rouge.

It is the administrative centre of the Abu Kamal District and the local subdistrict (Abu Kamal Subdistrict). Just to the south-east is the Al-Qa'im border crossing to the town of Husaybah in the Al-Qa'im District of Iraq's Al Anbar Governorate.  Etymology  When part of the Ottoman Empire, Abu Kamal was called kƒ±≈üla, pronounced locally as \\"qashla\\", which is a Turkish word for \\"military barracks\\". This name \\"Qashla\\" is still used by some inhabitants of the area, especially by elderly villagers. The name \\"Al-Bukamal\\" () means \\"the family of Kamal\\", Kamal being the tribe that lives there, whereas the name \\"Abu Kamal\\" means \\"the father of Kamal\\".  History  In the 17th century, Abu Kamal was the seat of a sanjak of the Ottoman Empire in the Rakka Eyalet. It was a kaza (subdistrict) center within Zor Sanjak until the end of Ottoman rule in 1918.http://tarihvemedeniyet.org/ekutuphane107 In 1896, the old mud village was relocated a mile upstream because it was in danger of being ruined by flooding. The new village was built from stone and had wide streets. The village and its subdistrict formed the center of the Arab Uqaydat tribe and was largely Sunni Muslim, with the exception of a small Christian community originally from Deir ez-Zor and Mosul. At the beginning of the 20th century, it contained eighty houses, the residence of the kaymakam (kaza governor), a police station, a ferry, and had a population of about 500. The kaza of Abu Kamal in 1890 had a population of 15,000. Abu Kamal became part of the French Mandate for Syria and the Lebanon in 1921, and the French made it the seat of a large garrison. In 1946 it became part of independent Syria. Abu Kamal's position at the border of Syria and Iraq has made it an important commercial as well as political center. Abu Kamal is located near to Al-Qa'im, a crossing point for the Iraqi insurgency and the location of Operation Steel Curtain in November, 2005. On 27 October 2008, during the Iraq War, four US helicopters carried out a raid on the village of Sukkariyeh in Abu Kamal district. It was the first known raid inside Syria by the US. News reports indicate that at least seven people were killed, four of them children.Al-Jazeera The Syrian Foreign Minister Walid Muallem stated that \\"Killing civilians in international law means a terrorist aggression.\\"  Syrian Civil War  Abu Kamal, one of the districts (November 19, 2017) During the Syrian Civil War, in late July 2012, the Free Syrian Army (FSA) took over the town, along with its associated border post with Iraq. In early September 2012, France 24 reported that the Hamdan military airport was under attack by FSA. On 16 November 2012, FSA took over the nearby Hamdan military airport, which was once used to transport farm produce, but was converted to a base for helicopters and military tanks. The capture of Hamdan meant that the Syrian Army forces now only held one air base in the province - the main military airport in Deir ez-Zor city. ISIL takeover Abu Kamal was captured by ISIL forces between late-June and early- July 2014 during a three-month offensive across Deir ez-Zor Governorate. On 3 July 2014, SOHR said that city of Mayadin, the second biggest town in Deir Ezzor province, was also \\"now under IS control, after Al-Nusra Front evacuated its headquarters there, and IS raised its banner\\". On 3 July 2014, all towns and villages on the route from Abu Kamal to Al-Bab, passing through the Raqqa province, were under Islamic State control. Owing to its distance from the frontline, the town would see little fighting between its capture by ISIL in 2014 and ISIL's retreat in 2017. During the lull in conflict, the town was the target of a failed opposition attack by the US-backed New Syrian Army in June 2016; the offensive lasted only a day and led to a total reversal of New Syrian Army advances to Abu Kamal. On October 14, 2017 the Syrian Arab Army took the city of Mayadin, located 80 kilometers from Abu Kamal. After that Abu Kamal was the only large city that remained under ISIL control.Abu Kamal, destroyed buildings (November 19, 2017)On October 25, the road Al Qaim ‚Äì Abu Kamal ‚Äì Mayadin ‚Äì Deir ez-Zor was blocked after a series of airstrikes conducted by Russian Air Force. From 1 to 4 November 6 Russian Tu-22M3 strategic bombers conducted airstrikes on ISIL objects near Abu Kamal. On November 7 the SAA started operation to take Abu Kamal with support of allied forces, like the Iranian-backed Hezbollah and the Iranian Revolution Guard Corps (IRGC). On 9 November 2017, ISIL retreated from the town, leaving fighters dispersed in villages and small towns in the desert. Army spokesman Gen. Ali Mayhoub stated: > ‚Ä≥The liberation of Abu Kamal is of great importance because it is a > declaration of the fall of this group‚Äôs project in the region generally and > the collapse of its supporters‚Äô illusions to divide it, control large parts > of the Syria-Iraq borders and secure supply routes between the two > countries.‚Ä≥ One day later Commander of the Russian force grouping in Syria Colonel General Sergei Surovikin confirmed the retaking of Abu Kamal: > ‚ÄúUnits of the 5th Assault Corps, assault groups of brigadier general Suheil > and militias with support of Russian Air Force took part in liberating Abu > Kamal. In the final stages of hostilities the Syrian Arab Army gained > control over the Syrian-Iraqi border near the Euphrates River‚Äù. However, on November 11 the city was recaptured by ISIL. The Syrian Army and its allies retook complete control of the city by 19 November. Concerns have been raised about what would happen to the village once ISIL was removed. Iranian presence Following the elimination of ISIS, Iranian-allied militias have occupied Abu Kamal and its countryside since late 2017. Since the end of 2017, the Iraqi Popular Mobilization Forces, which are linked to the Iranian Islamic Revolutionary Guard Corps (IRGC), had control of the al- Qa'im border crossing, while Hezbollah and the Haidarion, Fatimion and Zeinabiyun militias had control of Mayadin, west of Abu Kamal, both on the south bank of the Euphrates River. The Syrian Democratic Forces (SDF) had control of the north bank. Fox News reported on 4 September that a new ‚Äúclassified Iranian project‚Äù, the Imam Ali military base, was being constructed near Abu Kamal,Airstrikes at Al Bukamal? The alleged Iranian base and the 'explosions' which was confirmed by satellite images. On 9 September 2019 reports emerged that ‚ÄúIranian‚Äù or ‚ÄúIranian-backed militias‚Äù had been targeted in airstrikes, that appeared to be similar to a June 2018 airstrike that targeted a Kata'ib Hezbollah base at a similar location. At least 18 Iranian and pro-Iran fighters were killed in the September attack. There were also five similar mysterious airstrikes in Iraq between 19 July and 25 August. On 30 September 2019, after eight years of closure, Syria and Iraq reopened the Al-Qa'im border crossing between Abu Kamal and Al-Qa'im. On 25 December 2019, there was a missile attack on sites belonging to Iranian militias in the Deir Ezzor area of eastern Syria near the border with Iraq, according to the Syrian Observatory for Human Rights, the second attack reported in the area in a week. Five people were killed in the attack and three in the earlier attack. The headquarters of an Iranian militia in the city and a site in Al-Jalaa located north of the city were struck in the attack.5 killed in strikes against Iranian militias in eastern Syria The reports say the nearby military site under a control of Hezbollah was targeted.Report: Five killed in missile strike on pro-Iranian militias in Syria  Climate  Abu Kamal has a hot desert climate (BWh) in the K√∂ppen‚ÄìGeiger climate classification system.

A member of the Scottish Labour Party, she was previously MSP for the Coatbridge and Chryston constituency from 1999 until 2016.  Early life and career  Smith was born in Coatbridge, North Lanarkshire and attended St Patrick's School, a local co-educational Roman Catholic school. She studied Economics and Politics at Glasgow College and then trained as a Modern Studies and Economics teacher at St Andrews College, a Catholic teacher-training institution in Glasgow. She worked as a secondary school teacher before becoming a local government officer, also gaining a Diploma in Public Sector Management. Political career Smith was elected as a Scottish Labour MSP for her local constituency of Coatbridge and Chryston in the 1999 Scottish Parliament election, with a majority of 10,404. She subsequently went on to be returned in 2003, 2007 and 2011, with majorities of 8,571, 4,510 and 2,741 respectively. On 11 May 2011, she was elected to serve as one of two Deputy Presiding Officers of the Scottish Parliament. In 2013, Smith voiced her opposition to same-sex marriage, claiming at a session of the Equal Opportunities Committee that its introduction could lead to polygamy. Smith supported Jeremy Corbyn during both the 2015 and 2016 Labour Party leadership elections. During the 2016 European Union membership referendum, she backed Britain leaving the European Union, contrary to the position of the Labour Party. In the 2016 Scottish Parliament election, Smith lost her seat by 3,779 votes after watching her vote share drop by 17.6%. She gained a list seat as one of seven additional members for the Central Scotland region and was returned for the new session. Following the retirement of Tricia Marwick, she attempted to be elected Presiding Officer of the Scottish Parliament. However, she was defeated by Ken Macintosh, a fellow Labour MSP and one of the additional members for the West Scotland region. After standing down as a Deputy Presiding Officer, she became a member of the Standards, Procedures and Public Appointments Committee. Smith supported Richard Leonard in the 2017 Scottish Labour Party leadership election. Following Leonard's victory, she was appointed to his Shadow Cabinet and was given the new role of Shadow Cabinet Secretary for Eradication of Poverty and Inequality. Her appointment was controversial because of her record of opposing same-sex marriage. In February 2018, Smith invited pro-life academic Professor Priscilla K. Coleman to speak at an event in the Scottish Parliament discussing what Coleman believes is the harmful impact of abortion on mental health. After facing criticism from Scottish Labour colleagues, Smith withdrew the invitation, citing a \\"diary clash\\". In response to the backlash, Richard Leonard said \\"It has been made clear to Elaine that she needs to comply with the party‚Äôs policy on issues like a woman‚Äôs right to choose.\\" In September 2019, Smith announced she would be standing down at the 2021 Scottish Parliament election on health grounds. Later that month, she became Scottish Labour Parliamentary Business Manager, replacing Neil Findlay.  Personal life  Smith is a member of the trade unions Transport and General Workers' Union (TGWU), later Unite the Union, and General Teaching Council for Scotland (GTC).

He was the grandson of Ustad Allauddin Khan, and the half-brother of Norah Jones and Anoushka Shankar. He was also the nephew of dance choreographer Uday Shankar, Sarod maestro Ali Akbar Khan and a cousin of musician Ananda Shankar and actress Mamata Shankar. He learned the sitar from his mother Annapurna Devi. He had not completed his \\"taalim\\" (training) with her when he left for the USA with his father Ravi Shankar. While living in his father's home in Hollywood, he painted and drew, and earned a degree in fine arts from the Otis Art Institute of the Parsons School of Design in Los Angeles. In 1971, within two years of his arrival in the US, Shubho Shankar performed in a concert for the first time, playing with his father at New York's Carnegie Hall. The performance was titled \\"Fathers and Sons\\" and included tabla players Alla Rakha and his son Zakir Hussain. Career Shubho Shankar performed frequently on concert tours, composed music for films and recorded several albums. He performed with his father, appearing throughout Europe, Asia and the United States, including performances at the Kennedy Center in Washington, D.C.. After marrying, he gradually dropped out of the music scene and stopped playing the sitar for almost eight years. At the age of 40, he took his father's advice to return to his music full-time. He gave lessons in sitar playing, singing and flute in Orange County, San Diego and Los Angeles. In 1989‚Äì1990, Shankar went on a concert tour of England, Europe and India. On this trip, which also was to be his last visit to India, he met his mother after a gap of 20 years during which the two had no communication. He resumed learning the sitar under his mother. Shankar played together with his father at the Sawai Gandharva Festival in Pune in 1990, where some music critics commented that he was out of tune. Shankar was dejected, and refused to stay in India to complete his sitar education, saying it was \\"too late now\\". He returned to the US, and in his last few months cut himself off from everyone. Personal life At a concert he gave at Whittier College, Shubho met Linda, from North Carolina, soon to be his wife. They had two children, son Somnath and daughter Kaveri. Gradually he lost interest in playing the sitar. He worked as a clerk in a liquor store, painted pictures, and drew illustrations for telephone directories, in order to support his wife and two children. Death Shankar died of pneumonia at Los Alamitos Medical Center following an illness of several months at his home in Garden Grove. He was cremated and his remains dispersed in the ocean off Marina del Rey.

Lehane () is an uncommon Irish surname, typically from County Cork. √ì Liath√°in is more frequently anglicized as Lane or Lyons. Most people with this surname derive from the ancient Munster kingdom of U√≠ Liath√°in, which was powerful in the early to mid 1st millennium, and one of the few important Irish kingdoms to have colonies in Britain, documented in both Irish and Welsh sources (see Byrne 2001; √ì Corr√°in 2001). Later U√≠ Liath√°in became politically marginalized when the E√≥ganachta, or more specifically the descendants of Conall Corc, came to power - although the rath they accepted from the new dynasty was the largest (Byrne 2001) - but remained relatively independent until disintegrating in the later Middle Ages. U√≠ Liath√°in was the sister kingdom of U√≠ Fidgenti, and thus its people share common ancestry with the O'Donovans, √ì Coile√°ins, and others. More distantly all are related to the historical E√≥ganachta in the stricter sense, if not by common origins in Ireland then at least by nearly two millennia of alliances and intermarriage. The earliest documented ancestor of the U√≠ Liath√°in and U√≠ Fidgenti is the 3rd or 4th century D√°re Cerbba (D√°ire Cearba), otherwise known as Maine Muncha√≠n.

History The club was founded as SC Riesa in 1903 in the cellar of the local pub \\"Bodega\\" and was renamed Riesaer SV two years later. In 1917, they fused with FC Wettin and went on to play quietly as a local club until 1936 when they advanced to the Gauliga Sachsen, one of sixteen divisions in the top flight of German football during the Third Reich. After World War II the club was dissolved and replaced by the SG Riesa in late 1945. Three years later the club developed an affiliation with the local steelworkers and came to be known as BSG Stahl Riesa. The football team played independently of the sports club from 1952 to 1957 before rejoining the parent club. They climbed into the second division in 1955 and in 1968 they played their way into the top tier DDR-Oberliga for the first time. Stahl would spend sixteen of the next twenty seasons in the top level, but frequently struggled to avoid relegation. Their best finish came in the 1974‚Äì75 season when they finished sixth and narrowly missed qualifying for the UEFA Cup tournament. With German re-unification in 1990 the club took on the name FC Stahl Riesa but returned to its old name of Riesaer SV within a year. In an attempt to remain financially viable it absorbed other local clubs including Riesaer SV Blau-Wei√ü in 1996 and SC Riesa-R√∂derau (formerly Chemie Riesa) in 1998. Initially seeded into the third division of the NOFV-Oberliga S√ºd, the club quickly slipped to play in the fifth division Landesliga Sachsen. The new millennium brought another name change, this time back to FC Stahl Riesa. Unfortunately, like many other clubs in the former East Germany, Riesa found it tough to keep going financially: in 2002 they filed for bankruptcy and the club was officially dissolved on 30 June 2003 for reason of insolvency. A handful of former coaches and players formed the TSV Stahl Riesa, a successor club, that started play in the 2. Kreisklasse Riesa-Grossenhain (XI) and has since worked its way up to the Bezirksliga Dresden (VII), including an unbeaten run of 78 games between 2003 and 2006, a German record.Die Welt ‚Äì Wie der TSV Stahl Riesa den Weltrekord jagtDer Freitag ‚Äì Wie Stahl Riesa Geschichte schrieb In March 2012 the club changed its name back to BSG Stahl Riesa (BSG now stands for Ballsportgemeinschaft, \\"Ball sports community\\").

They currently play in the Welsh National League Division Five West and are a feeder club for the Llanelli Scarlets. They are known locally as the Scarlets relating to the colour of their shirts. Historyhttp://www.pitchero.com/clubs/pembroke/a/history-9463.html Pembroke Rugby Football Club was established in 1896. It celebrated its centenary in the 1996‚Äì1997 season with a centenary dinner held in a marquee on the club ground. David Vaughan (Dunvant) was the chief guest. The club was not granted Welsh Rugby Union status until 1919, immediately after World War I. Between the Wars the club competed in the local cup and league competitions. In 1922‚Äì23 the club were the K.O Cup Winners whilst in 1935‚Äì36 it repeated this feat in becoming the West of Llanelly K.O. Cup Winners. After the Second World War, the club resumed its activities and in 1947‚Äì48 under the captaincy of Chris Leonard, became the Pembrokeshire and District League K.O. Champions. This feat was repeated in 1960‚Äì61 under the captaincy of Derek Hayward. Unfortunately this is the last occasion on which the K.O. Cup has come to Crickmarren. 1954‚Äì55 was probably one of the most successful in the club's history under the vigorous captaincy of John Shanklin the team were both the Pembrokeshire and District League Champions and runners up in the K.O. Cup tournament. This period in the club's history also saw the club win the county 7-a-side tournament on several occasions. Homeground Pembroke RFC play all their home games at the Crickmarren Field located on Upper Lamphey Road. There is a stand with seating on one side of the pitch. Also located here is the clubhouse and changing rooms. There is also a training pitch located down the lane behind the rugby club and also a small pitch designed for Mini-Rugby known as 'The Cage' due to the wire fence around its perimeter. Kit Pembroke RFC traditionally play in scarlet coloured shirts with white shorts and scarlet socks. As for their away kit they play in a green and red style. League Pembroke were promoted from Division 6 West at the end of the 2003/04 season and moved to Division 5 West. They were also promoted the following season to Division 4 West for the 2005/06 season. Cups Pembroke have been victorious in the Pembrokeshire K.O. Cup on several occasions. These were in the 1922‚Äì23, 1935‚Äì36, 1947‚Äì48 and 1960‚Äì61 seasons. Rivalries Pembroke's main rival is Pembroke Dock Harlequins RFC (known as the Quins), although there are fierce rivalries with the other Pembrokeshire teams. Individual honours The Club has seen many of their products gain various international honours. Beginning with Randall Huzzey, who won his Welsh Schoolboy Cap from East-End School in 1931, the club has seen several of its members win caps in both schools and youth international matches. It is also proud to have Junior Rugby Union internationals in its ranks, whilst three of its products went on to gain senior Welsh international caps with Jonathan Thomas still participating in an active role with the Welsh team. Mike Knill ‚Äì with Cardiff. Robert Appleyard ‚Äì with Swansea. Jonathan Thomas ‚Äì with Ospreys After World War II, Pembroke was also fortunate to gain the services of Eddie Woodgate who gained an England Cap before coming to reside in Pembroke from Devon. In later years two of the club's exiles gained international honours playing for Luxembourg.

The facility began as a ballroom in 1956, added an arena in 1964 and grew to a six-building complex which closed in August 2016. At one time, it hosted the Dayton Jets basketball team and Dayton Gems (1964‚Äì1977, 1979‚Äì1980 and 2009‚Äì2012), Dayton Blue Hawks, Dayton Owls, Dayton Bombers, Dayton Ice Bandits, Dayton Demonz, Megacity Hockey Club and Dayton Demolition ice hockey teams and the Marshals indoor football team.  History  The site was originally the family-owned fruit orchard of Harold and Ralph Wampler. The name stems from HA from Harold and RA from Ralph. In 1956, the Wampler Ballroom was erected, which still stands today in the six-building complex. The arena itself opened in 1964. Both of the arena's founders were Shriners, and originally founded the venue after realizing that there was nowhere suitable in the area to hold the Shrine Circus. The original plans did not include an ice rink, but were changed to accommodate the Dayton Gems who were looking for a home arena. As of 2016, the complex spanned which includes the main arena, four exhibition halls, a conference center, a pub and a golf course. The Arena regularly used the slogan in advertising \\"Nowhere Else But Hara.\\" On July 29, 2016, it was announced that the facility would close after hosting a final event August 27, 2016 due to ongoing financial issues and a 20-year long legal fight over the unresolved estate of founder Harold Wampler. At the time of the closure announcement, the facility was said to have a $36 million annual impact to the area. The closure forced events, like the annual Dayton Hamvention, to search for an alternative venue. It also forced the Dayton Demolition ice hockey team to cease operations after only one season. Prior to its closure, the Arena was said to have had a parking lot filled with potholes and not received any significant update since 1975. As of March 2018, the property had been abandoned for over a year-and-a-half, at times vandalized and broken into. In December 2017, PNC Bank foreclosed on the property, seeking to collect on $350,000 owed to the bank. It was reported that many had called Trotwood's government with ideas for the property, which had a list price of $775,000, but anyone seeking to acquire the property would need a \\"specific plan for the complicated situation of 'well over $1 million' in taxes that are due, and the multiple parcels of land and arena.\\" In April 2018, YouTube video from a self-described \\"local explorer\\" illicitly entering the arena showed disrepair and deteriorating conditions. The city of Trotwood had made attempts to secure the property, but with limited success, and it was reported to have hundreds of code violations. On May 2, 2018, it was revealed that the property was purchased by Michael Heitz, a developer based in Louisville, Kentucky. Heitz stated that he had bought the income tax liens from Montgomery County and hoped to close on further liens with the banks later in the week. Heitz stated that his first priority was to clean up the site and secure the property. He is known for purchasing other distressed properties within the area and getting them shovel ready for users. On February 25, 2019, at least three individuals were arrested for breaking into the property in an attempt to steal air conditioning parts. On the night of May 27‚Äì28, 2019, the property suffered extensive damage when tornadoes and severe storms moved through the area. The roof and sides of the structure were blown off in several places. In response, Heitz stated that he was cautiously optimistic that the building could be salvaged, but if not, it would have to be demolished. He noted that much of the main arena looked fine and that the metal which had been lost could be replaced and likely needed to be replaced anyway. He also stated that he had recently secured a grant to conduct a phase 2 environmental study of the site, with the possibility of selling the building to another buyer, which would bring new jobs to the area. Hara Arena, 12-31-2019, badly damaged by an EF4 tornado and tagged with graffiti In October 2019, it was reported the existing facility would not be able to be salvaged due to the already existing damage having been compounded by the tornado. The owners planned to request rezoning from entertainment from commercial to attract interest that would aid the facility's cleanup and redevelopment. It was estimated that the facility suffered $7.5 million in damages, the most for any property in the Montgomery County area. In March 2020, it was announced the property had been rezoned and that demolition was likely to start soon. However, it was unclear how any such plans might be affected by the increased restrictions and financial difficulties put in place shortly afterwards due to the COVID-19 pandemic. In May 2020, Heitz revealed that a multi-million dollar NASDAQ corporation was interested in the plot and could bring at least 50 new jobs to the area. He and the client planned to present a plan for construction to Trotwood in late July, with demolition to start immediately if the plan was approved. In September 2020, Trotwood officially announced plans to demolish the arena and rezone the land.

Hara also hosted Georgia Championship Wrestling in 1983 and 1984. It also hosted a WWF Superstars of Wrestling TV taping in March, 1987, a WWF Wrestling Challenge taping in August, 1988, and the Pay-Per-View events as follows: the 1995 WCW Great American Bash, WCW/NWO Souled Out (1998), and ECW Heatwave 1998 and ECW Heatwave 1999. Hara Arena was known as being \\"legendary\\" for wrestling, with the WWF's first show at the Arena featuring the famed Andr√© the Giant. The Sheik held his first event at Hara Arena in 1965, just one year after its opening.  Notable events  Interior of the arena during the 2003 Hamvention. The arena was also venue to many types of concerts, music festivals, trade shows and conventions, formerly including the annual Dayton Hamvention (which, starting in 2017, is held at the Greene County Fairgrounds and Expo Center). The Miami Valley Home Improvement Show was also held annually here. According to the American Radio Relay League, the 2016 Hamvention had been the 65th held in Dayton and the Hara complex hosted more than 25,000 visitors in that final year. Over a 60-year history, the facility hosted many musical performances from bands ranging from the Rolling Stones and the Grateful Dead to Guy Lombardo And His Royal Canadians. The facility, in fact, hosted one of the first-ever U.S. performances of the Rolling Stones, which was attended by only 648. Heavy metal band Pantera performed at the facility numerous times between the years of 1990-2001, and were officially named the house band of the venue in 1998. Hara Arena was where Wayne Gretzky played his first professional hockey game; a pre-season game between the Indianapolis Racers and the Cincinnati Stingers, on September 27, 1978. The Arena was also home to many popular touring shows, such as Disney on Ice and Sesame Street on Ice. Karen Wampler, arena marketing director at the time of its closure, cited a visit from the Ringling Bros. Circus as being particularly memorable, due to it to being the last stop on the tour for the circus.

In a career spanning more than 40 years, Thompson came to prominence in the late 1970s as the founder and saxophonist for the English ska band Madness. Early years Prior to forming Madness, Thompson and future Madness keyboardist Mike Barson gained some notoriety as graffiti artists in the mid-1970s. After reading about the emerging New York graffiti scene, they spray-painted their nicknames (\\"Kix\\" and \\"Mr B\\") along with two friends' names \\"Cat\\" and \\"Columbo\\" around North London. They managed to spray their nicknames on George Melly's garage door, prompting Melly to write a newspaper article declaring: \\"If I ever catch that Mr B, Kix and Columbo, I'm going to kick their arses\\". Music career Thompson founded Madness with Mike Barson and Chris Foreman in 1976, and wrote the group's debut single, \\"The Prince\\". Among the other songs, he wrote or co- wrote the singles \\"Embarrassment\\", \\"House of Fun\\", and \\"Uncle Sam\\". His experiences of being a petty criminal and serving time in borstal in his youth inspired his lyrics for \\"Land of Hope and Glory\\" and \\"One's Second Thoughtlessness\\", the latter an unusual diversion into synthpop for the group. Thompson performed lead vocals for both tracks. He also sang the vocals on his own composition, \\"Razor Blade Alley\\", which was a regular inclusion in early Madness shows. Thompson reunited with all seven original Madness members in 1992. After Madness disbanded in 1986, Thompson formed a new band The Madness with Foreman, Suggs and Chas Smash, but they broke up after releasing one album in 1988. Thompson then joined forces with Foreman, and the pair began to write songs. They soon recorded an album at Liquidator Studios with Thompson on vocals and saxophone and Foreman playing the other instruments. This album included the song \\"Magic Carpet\\", which was co-written with Suggs and originally intended to be included on a Madness album. When it came to promoting their debut album, they found they needed to form a group and also decide on a name. Due to an error at the printers, the band name and album title were accidentally switched, and they started off as The Nutty Boys. . The album was re-released in 2002, and the mistake was rectified, with the group now known as Crunch! During this time Lee was often found in the early hours flyposting with part time keyboard player of Crunch Mark Sexbery in the East End. Thompson founded The Dance Brigade with Keith Finch in 2007, and they were joined by Jennie Matthias of The Belle Stars. The other musicians came from projects that they had all been involved in. He also fronted and played saxophone with a covers band called The Camden Cowboys. Thompson was featured floating while playing a red, white, and blue-colored saxophone in the closing ceremonies of the 2012 Summer Olympics. In 2011, Thompson began performing with The Lee Thompson Ska Orchestra who released the album The Benevolence of Sister Mary Ignatius in 2013. They released the single \\"Fu Man Chu\\" featuring Bitty McLean from this album and, in February 2014, released the follow up single \\"Bangarang\\" featuring Dawn Penn and Sharon Shannon. Personal life In 1984, Thompson married Debbie (n√©e Fordham). They have three children named Tuesday, Daley and Kye.

The Copenhagen Fire of 1728 was the largest fire in the history of Copenhagen, Denmark. It began on the evening of 20 October 1728 and continued to burn until the morning of 23 October. It destroyed approximately 28% of the city (measured by counting the number of destroyed lots from the cadastre), left 20% of the population homeless, and the reconstruction lasted until 1737. No less than 47% of the section of the city, which dates back to the Middle Ages, was completely lost, and along with the Copenhagen Fire of 1795, it is the main reason that few traces of medieval Copenhagen can be found in the modern city. Although the number of dead and wounded was relatively low compared to the extent of the fire, the cultural losses were huge. In addition to several private book collections, 35,000 texts including a large number of unique works were lost with the University of Copenhagen library, and at the observatory on top of Rundet√•rn, instruments and records made by Tycho Brahe and Ole R√∏mer were destroyed.  Timeline  Section of Joachim Hassing's map color-coded to illustrate the approximate progress of the fire, showing the origin of the fire (bright yellow) and the area affected by midnight on Wednesday (dark yellow), by midnight on Thursday (orange), by midnight on Friday (red) and by Saturday (purple).  Wednesday 20 October  The exact time that the fire started is unknown. Various sources mention times between 6:00 and 8:00 p.m., and 7:30 p.m. is the best estimate. However, the exact location of the origin of the fire is known. Almost directly across the street from Vesterport (the West Gate) was Lille Sankt Clemens Str√¶de. On the corner facing Vestervold, there was a small house on lot \\"Vester Kvarter 146\\" (according to the cadastre of 1699) owned by Signe, widow of Boye Hansen. The lot is almost identical to the one on the corner of present-day Frederiksberggade (the western end of Str√∏get) and The City Hall Square. Among the widow's tenants were restaurant manager Peder Rasmussen and his wife, Anne Iversdatter. It was on the second floor of the restaurateur's apartment that the fire started. At the inquiries held after the fire was over, both he and his wife stated that their seven-year-old son had started the fire by accidentally upsetting a candle, but it is more likely that it was the result of carelessness on behalf of the parents while casting candles and that they blamed the child to avoid punishment. The watchmen were quick to sound the alarm, but given the fire department's relatively primitive equipment, the fact that the streets of Vester Kvarter were too narrow for the fire pumps, the strange dispositions of those fighting the fire, and a series of unlucky events, the fight was nearly hopeless. The wind blew from the southwest that evening, carrying the fire along Lille Sankt Clemens Str√¶de, Store Sankt Clemens Str√¶de, Vombadstuestr√¶de, Antiquitetsstr√¶de and Hellig-Kors Str√¶de. By 9:00 p.m the main street of Vestergade was burning on both sides. From here the fire spread along Store Lars Bj√∏rns Str√¶de, Lille Lars Bj√∏rns Str√¶de and Studiestr√¶de. Map of Vester Kvarter where the fire started with the lot numbers from the cadastre of 1699. The numbers of the burned lots are underlined in red. Later that evening, the fire reached Sankt Peders Str√¶de, where the Valkendorfs Kollegium dormitory (lot \\"N√∏rre Kvarter 122\\") was engulfed in flames. Professor Peder Horrebow, who lived at the dormitory, lost most of his possessions. Presumably simultaneously, the fire also reached Professor Hans Steenbuch's room on Studiestr√¶de (lot \\"N√∏rre Kvarter 60\\"). Around midnight, the fire reached the priest's residence by the church Sankt Petri Kirke. On N√∏rregade, another fire started at a brewery Wednesday evening ‚Äì possibly between 10 p.m. and 11 p.m. Just prior to that the original fire had reached Gammeltorv, where people fought to keep the fire back. For that reason, help was sent late to deal with the new fire. Around midnight the wind shifted to the west, and the situation on N√∏rregade turned critical as the fire was driven towards the street along a wide front. At first people sought to keep the fire on the western side of N√∏rregade, but nevertheless it spread to the eastern side during the night. Simultaneously, the fire moved from present day N√∏rre Voldgade towards N√∏rreport (North Gate).  Thursday  Early Thursday morning, a final desperate attempt to keep the flames from spreading was made at Gammeltorv. Already-burning houses were fired upon with cannons to make them collapse. When that did not work, an order was given to blow up the houses with black powder charges. The building housing the wine cellar known as \\"Blasen\\" on the corner of Vestergade and N√∏rregade was to be the first demolition, but this dangerous undertaking failed when the gunpowder blew up while men were still carrying in the charges. While the building did go down, people were killed and injured and the explosion ignited nearby buildings, including the church Vor Frue Kirke. By 9:30 a.m. the church spire had fallen into the street, and soon after the whole church was engulfed in flames; the personal property that people had brought to the church to keep them safe from the fire was lost. At N√∏rregade, the fire reached Sankt Petri Kirke around 8 a.m. By 9 a.m., the flames reached bishop Christen Worm's residence (lot \\"N√∏rre Kvarter 112\\"), which burned to the ground. The bishop who was travelling, was left with the clothes on his back and three prayer books. At Nytorv, the flames consumed Det Kongelige Vajsenhus (The Royal Orphanage) (now the location of the Copenhagen District Court). The City Hall of Copenhagen - then located between Nytorv and Gammeltorv - was now in peril. Around 10 a.m., the flames had taken hold of the building and it was soon added to the list of buildings lost. From Gammeltorv the inferno made its way down Kl√¶deboderne, Skindergade, Skoubogade and Vimmelskaftet, heading towards Amagertorv, while from Nytorv the fire found fuel on R√•dhusstr√¶de towards Frederiksholms Canal and Slotsholmen. New fires were reported: Count Adam Christoffer Knuth's house in Pustervig, a cellar in K√∏bmagergade (Market Street) and a haystack at N√∏rreport (Northern Gate) all broke out in flames; the latter likely ignited by embers carried by the wind. When the fire had consumed Vor Frue Kirke, the University of Copenhagen saw one building after another burn. The Community Building (Kommunitetsbygningen), which was used to help support students by giving them free meals; the university's head building (Studieg√•rden/The Study Courtyard), at the same location as the current head building; and the Anatomy Building (Domus Anatomica) and Anatomy Theatre (Theatrum Anatomicum) were all lost. Aforementioned, Professor Hans Steenbuch had sought refuge at Professor Hans Gram's home, where both he and his possessions found temporary safety. But now the fire reached Gram's home next to Vor Frue Kirke (lot \\"Kl√¶debo Kvarter 245\\"), and there was not enough time to save Steenbuch's possessions, although Gram saved most of his own from destruction. Along Kannikestr√¶de, one by one University of Copenhagen professors' homes fell prey to the flames. Several more student dormitories were lost but along K√∏bmagergade a wing of buildings were saved including the church Regenskirken. The next notable victim of the fire was the church Trinitatis Kirke, which housed the University Library in its attic. The flames got a hold the church around 5 p.m. and when the ceiling gave around 10 p.m., the entire library's collection was delivered into a sea of flames. Rundet√•rn was left for the most part undamaged, but the observatory at the top burned out. From Gammeltorv, the fire spread out to Ulfeldts Plads, now Gr√•br√∏dretorv, around 4 p.m. The monument that shamed traitor Corfitz Ulfeldt lost a few letters in the heat. A few hours later, the fire closed in on the church Hellig√•ndskirken and at 8 p.m. its carillon bells came to life as they did every half-hour - playing Thomas Kingo's Vreden din afvend, herre Gud, af Naade (Eng. Turn your anger, Lord, by mercy) - just before they crashed into the fire below. From Trinitatis Church, the fire continued down Landem√¶rket towards Gothersgade. Here, the fire met up with the other branch of the fire which ate its way down present day N√∏rre Voldgade. Around midnight, the church Reformert Kirke was ablaze. The only place in the city where there was some control over the fire was around Vandkunsten.  Friday  Friday morning the wind shifted again, this time to the north. The firefighting finally started to show some semblance of organization, and efforts were waged to stop the fire in the neighborhood around Magstr√¶de. This failed, though, when the fire took the soap factory on Magstr√¶de around noon. The wind was now blowing northwest and the firefighting moved via Snaregade to Nybrogade, Nabol√∏s and Gammel Strand, but failed to save Nybrogade. Further east, the fire proceeded south to Klareboderne and M√∏ntergade. Poul Fechtels Hospital on M√∏ntergade was drowned in flames with some of the residents still inside. Close by, Professor Ludvig Holberg left his home on K√∏bmagergade (lot \\"K√∏bmager Kvarter 18\\"). Around midnight, the blaze was close to Silkegade and Store Regnegade.  Saturday  Over the course of the night the wind settled and stopped the forward march of the fire. Thirty-six homes were selected for demolition to create a firebreak, which did stop the fire at the corner of Store Regnegade and Gothersgade. Further west, Amagertorv and the church Sankt Nicolai Kirke had been threatened, but the blaze was stopped close to Amagertorv, where only the three houses furthest north (\\"Frimands Kvarter\\" lots 8, 10 and 11) were lost. The fire on Magstr√¶de at the soap factory was still a threat. The fire ate its way along Snaregade. At the end of Snaregade was the house (lot \\"Snarens Kvarter 2\\") of the vice mayor, Christian Berregaard, which the people tried to save. The houses around it were torn down, and the houses on the opposite side of the street were blown up with black powder. The outcome was hardly any better than that of the earlier attempt at the wine cellar, though. The gunpowder went off, people had to run for their lives and the vice mayor's house was set afire and burned to the ground. After the failed attempt to save the house, the fire was stopped from spreading further, though, and among other things the weigh station of Christoffer Valkendorf was saved. In line with Christian interpretation of the day, the slowdown of the fire during Saturday was seen as a result of divine intervention. To thank God, king Christian VI introduced on 23 October as a new annual holiday in 1731 on which every church in Copenhagen held a service of thanksgiving. This holiday was abolished at the holiday reform of 1770. Losses Old statistics attached to the back of the map by Joachim Hassing, according to which 1640 houses burned and another 39 were \\"ruined\\". The number is probably a bit too high. Property losses from the fire can be accounted for with relative certainty as detailed surveys were made immediately afterwards. City surveyor S√∏ren Balle submitted the first survey on 1 November 1728 and on 13 April 1729 the Magistrate of Copenhagen finished a second, made according to a royal request of 12 December 1728. The differences between the two surveys are limited to the extent of the damages on 43 lots, so it is fairly certain that 1,227 lots containing about 1,600 buildings were lost in flames. All of Copenhagen consisted of about 4,500 lots (per the cadastre of 1699), so about 28% of the lots were lost. For the medieval part of town the ratio is 47%. The magistrate also made a survey of the spared parts of town from which it appears that 8,749 former residents of the parts touched by fire had found new lodgings. It is estimated that as many as 15,000 had become homeless. This is about 20% of the population, which is estimated at 70,000. However the number of dead and wounded is unknown. It is possible to deduce some information from parish registers and other sources, but the number remains uncertain. It is probably low in comparison with the extent of the fire, though. While the human and property losses were staggering, the cultural loss is still felt today. The University of Copenhagen library was without a doubt the greatest and the most frequently mentioned of such. 35,000 texts and a large archive of historical documents disappeared in the flames. Original works from the historians Hans Svaning, Anders S√∏rensen Vedel, Niels Krag, and Arild Huitfeldt and the scientists Ole Worm, Ole R√∏mer, Tycho Brahe and the brothers Hans and Caspar Bartholin were lost. Atlas Danicus by Peder Hansen Resen and the archive of the Diocese of Zealand went up in flames as well. The archive of the diocese had been moved to the university library the very same day the fire started. Several other book collections were lost as well. Professor Mathias Anchersen made the mistake of bringing his possessions to safety in Trinitatis Church. √Årni Magn√∫sson lost all his books, notes and records, but did manage to rescue much of his valuable collection of handwritten Icelandic manuscripts. At Borchs Kollegium 3,150 volumes burned along with its Museum Rarirorum containing collections of zoological and botanical oddities. The burned out observatory in Rundet√•rn had contained instruments and records by Tycho Brahe and Ole R√∏mer. The professors Horrebow, Steenbuch and the two Bartholins lost practically everything. And on top of all that a large part of the city archive of records burnt along with city hall. Consequences Map of Vester Kvarter after the fire with new cadastre numbers and streets When the reconstruction of Denmark's capital was begun a number of changes were introduced. A commission was appointed to regulate the streets. After surveyings among the ruins this commission submitted a suggestion to create 12 to 15-metre wide main streets with 10-metre wide side streets with none of the surrounding houses being half-timbered. This plan was not followed in the reconstruction. Although half-timbered houses were banned at first, the ban was lifted in 1731 as brick houses were considerably more expensive. Medieval Copenhagen, however, had changed permanently when the reconstruction was complete by 1737. Streets and alleys no longer followed the original paths and some even ceased to exist. The fire houses One of Johan Cornelius Krieger's fire houses The term ildebrandshuse (English: fire houses) today refer to a type of townhouses that was built in large numbers in the years immediately after the fire. Many of them were modelled on generic renderings made by Johan Cornelius Krieger with inspiration from Christof Marselis. The houses are two or three storeys high, five bays wide and have a prominent wall dormer. The fa√ßade towards the street is in brick while the rest of the house has timber framing. They are typically painted in bright colours. Well- preserved examples are today found in locations such as Gr√•br√∏dretorv and Gammel M√∏nt. An example of an eight-bay fire house is situated at Valkendorfsgade 36.

It is the capital of the Mayadin District, part of the Deir ez-Zor Governorate. Mayadin is about 44 kilometers southeast of Deir ez-Zor. The Euphrates River flows through the town. In the 2004 census, the population was 44,028, making it the second most populous town in the governorate. History=Ancient era Mayadin has been identified to be the ancient Audattha known to Ptolemy, though some suggest Audattha was where Haditha now stands in Iraq. Middle Ages Mayadin is the successor of the medieval town and fortress of Rahbat Malik ibn Tawk, founded by the Abbasid lord and the original town's namesake, Malik ibn Tawk. Strategically located at a crossroads on the western bank of the Euphrates and considered the key to Syria from Iraq, control of the town was highly contested by the Muslim powers and Bedouin tribes of the region. It grew to become one of the major Muslim towns of the Euphrates valley and was an administrative center. An earthquake destroyed Rahbat Malik ibn Tawk in 1157, after which it was granted by the Zengid ruler Nur ad-Din to Asad ad-Din Shirkuh, the paternal uncle of future Ayyubid sultan, Saladin. Shirkuh relocated the fortress about four kilometers southwest of the original site. The new settlement, known as \\"al-Rahba al-Jadida\\", remained the significant center of the Euphrates region through much of the Ayyubid‚ÄìMamluk era (12th‚Äì15th centuries), and today is a ruined fortress known as \\"Qal'at al- Rahba\\". The original settlement eventually became known as \\"Mashhad Rahba\\". The latter was located at the present site of Mayadin. Modern era Mayadin is the administrative center of Nahiya Mayadin and the Mayadin District. In the early 20th century, Mayadin was the administrative seat of the Asharah kaza (subdistrict) of the Sanjak of Zor district and contained the residence of its qaimmaqam (governor). In a British military intelligence report from the 1900s, the town had a population of 2,000 mostly Sunni Muslims and a small minority of Christians. There was a bazaar, several shops and a mosque with a leaning minaret. According to Czech explorer Alois Musil, who visited in 1912, Mayadin had a garrison of twelve gendarmes, ten policemen and ten mule riders. There was a boys' primary school in the town. The population was about 2,500, consisting of roughly four hundred Muslim families, fifteen Syriac Orthodox families (mostly refugees from Mardin), and three Jewish families, living in a total of 380 houses. On June 19, 1947, Pan Am Flight 121, crewed by third officer Gene Roddenberry (who went on to create the original Star Trek television series), crashed 4 miles (6.4 km) from the town. =Syrian Civil War= During the Syrian Civil War, Free Syrian Army captured the town in late August 2012 after fighting in the town. The only part still in regime hands was the Mayadin military base, an artillery position on a hill overlooking the town, which was captured on 22 November. This gave the rebels control of a large amount of territory east of the base to the Iraqi border. On 3 July 2014, ISIL captured Mayadin and raised their black standard. A local underground resistance movement of moderate Sunni Muslim fighters attacked ISIL checkpoints in the city in 2015. This forced ISIL to dig a defensive position around the city. On 3 April 2017, during the SDF's offensive to capture Raqqa, it was reported that ISIL was possibly in the process of moving its capital from Raqqa city to Mayadin. This followed months of gradual relocation of resources and senior ISIL leaders from Raqqa to Mayadin. On 21 April 2017, the United States announced that they had conducted a ground raid in Mayadin and killed Abdulrakhman Uzbeki, an ISIS leader. On 18 June 2017, Iran hit ISIL targets in Mayadin using domestic-based surface-to-surface mid-range missiles.http://www.iransview.com/why-iran- targets-isis-positions-in-syrias-deir-ezzur/1729/ By the 10 October 2017, the town was besieged by the SAA and fighting had begun in the suburbs in preparation to storm the town. https://muraselon.com/en/2017/10/video-syrian- forces-combat-isis-al-mayadeen-suburbs/ On 11 October 2017, the Syrian Army made huge advances inside the town of Mayadin and has taken control of about 60 percent of the town.Breaking: ISIS almost driven-out of capital city by elite Syrian forces On 14 October 2017, the Syrian Army retook the town thus ending the 4 year long ISIL rule over it.El Ej√©rcito sirio toma la ciudad de Al Mayad√≠n, uno de los √∫ltimos reductos del Estado Isl√°mico en SiriaEl Ej√©rcito sirio toma la ciudad de Al Mayad√≠n, uno de los √∫ltimos reductos del Estado Isl√°mico en SiriaBreaking: Syrian Army liberates ISIS capital city In June 2018, ISIL unsuccessfully attempted to retake the town.

Cunhambebe (more correctly pronounced Quonambec in his native Tupi language) was an aboriginal Indian chieftain of the Tupinamb√° tribe, which dominated the region between present- day Cabo Frio (Rio de Janeiro) and Bertioga (S√£o Paulo). He lived in a village in Iperoig (near present-day Ubatuba). Military career Cunhambebe was also the main force and elected chief of the Tamoyo Confederation, a military alliance between the sea coast tribes against the Portuguese colonists. The Tamoyo Confederation waged war against the Portuguese until the Peace of Iperoig in 1567. They also fought the Portuguese forces in alliance with the French invaders commanded by Nicolas Durand de Villegaignon (1510‚Äì1571), a Huguenot admiral, in the historical episode which became known as the France Antarctique. According to the description of French priest Andr√© de Thevet, the German soldier of fortune and sailor Hans Staden (1525‚Äì1579) was a prisoner of Cunhambebe's father (who had the same name) between 1554 and 1557. The Tupinamb√° were fierce warriors and cannibals, as described by Hans Staden, who narrowly escaped several times of being killed and eaten by Cunhambebe's Indians. 1642 depiction from a book by Ulisse Aldrovandi The war waged by the Tamoyo Confederation was strongly affecting the Portuguese colonisation efforts, so the two Portuguese Jesuit priests who had founded S√£o Paulo dos Campos de Piratininga (which became the present-day megalopolis of S√£o Paulo), Manoel da N√≥brega (1517‚Äì1570) and Jos√© de Anchieta (1534‚Äì1597) started a peace mission by doing a high risk visit to Cunhambebe's village. Although they were received with mistrust, Anchieta spoke Tupi language very well and they were spared death. Eventually, Anchieta succeeded in negotiating a peace treaty, which was respected by Cunhambebe and the Tupinamb√°s. The peace treaty ended when an attack force led by Portuguese knight D. Est√°cio de S√° (1520‚Äì1567) tried to expel the French invaders. In this occasion, the Tamoyo tribes came to help the Frenchmen, particularly because they felt betrayed by the Portuguese, and also because the Temimino tribes, their traditional and bitter enemies, fought on the side of the Portuguese. Death Cunhambebe died of bubonic plague just after the arrival of Villegaigon's fleet to the Guanabara Bay in Rio de Janeiro, before the events which eventually led to the almost complete destruction of the Tamoyos towards the end of the 16th century.

At the Federal level, it is primarily governed by the Fair Debt Collection Practices Act (FDCPA). In addition, many U.S. states also have debt collection laws that regulate the credit and collection industry and give consumer debtors protection from abusive and deceptive practices. Many state laws track the language of the FDCPA, so that they are sometimes referred to as mini-FDCPAs. Laws regulating telemarketing and phone solicitation can also apply to debt collection practices, including the Federal Telephone Consumer Protection Act of 1991 (TCPA).  State regulation  U.S. state laws on fair debt collection generally fall into two categories: laws which require persons who are collecting debts from consumers to be licensed, registered or bonded in order to collect from consumers in their states, and laws that protect consumers from specific unfair practices by debt collectors, which may include collection agencies and sometimes original creditors. Unlike the FDCPA, many state laws also apply to the debt collection activity of original creditors, thus providing greater protections to consumers than the Federal FDCPA. Although not all states have such laws, some states track violations of debt collection practices laws. Some states bar debt collectors from engaging in collection activity against residents of the state unless the collection agency has complied with state licensing or bonding requirements, while others exempt out-of-state collectors from those requirements. Many state fair debt collection laws provide for a private right of action (consumers can sue the debt collector) by consumers against debt collectors that violate their provisions. Examples of prohibitions of unfair practices by collectors include contacting employers after having been given notice not to do so, pretending to be a government agency, pretending to be an attorney or falsely threatening a debtor with a lawsuit.

He is best known as the musical director and composer of the music for Doctor Who from 2005, until he stepped down in 2018 after the tenth series aired in 2017. He has been nominated for five BAFTAs. Born in Portsmouth to a Jewish family, Gold initially pursued drama as a vocation, writing and playing music as a hobby, but switched to music when he became musical director for the University of Cambridge's Footlights society. Television Gold has been nominated for a BAFTA five times in the category Best Original Television Music, for Vanity Fair (1999), Queer as Folk (2000), Casanova (2006) and twice for Doctor Who (2009 and 2014). His score for the BAFTA winning film Kiss of Life was awarded the 'Mozart Prize of the 7th Art' by a French jury at Aubagne in 2003. He has also been nominated four times by the Royal Television Society in categories relating to music for television. He has worked with Russell T Davies, the former writer and executive producer of Doctor Who, many times in the past on projects such as Casanova (starring David Tennant), The Second Coming (starring Christopher Eccleston) and Queer as Folk 1 & 2. He has also provided the incidental music for the 2000s version of Randall & Hopkirk (Deceased) alongside James Bond composer David Arnold, who provided the theme tune. He wrote the theme tune for the Channel 4 series Shameless and scored the period drama The Devil's Whore. More recently Gold scored another David Tennant series, in BBC1's Single Father. In this, Gold opted for a more popular music style ensemble rather than writing for orchestra. Since 2012 Murray Gold has composed the musical score for the drama series Last Tango in Halifax. In 2014, Gold scored the BBC series The Musketeers. In 2019, Gold reunited with Russell T Davies for his series Years and Years, a drama based around a family and how the political, cultural and technological changes around the world affected them. Doctor Who and related series From 2005 to 2017, Gold served as musical director of science fiction drama Doctor Who for the BBC. In this capacity, he created a new arrangement of the show's theme (originally composed by Ron Grainer) and also composed the show's incidental music. Silva Screen released a compilation of Gold's Doctor Who incidental music from the first and second series, entitled Doctor Who: Original Television Soundtrack, on 11 December 2006. A second CD, Doctor Who: Original Television Soundtrack ‚Äì Series 3, was released on 5 November 2007 and a third, Doctor Who: Original Television Soundtrack ‚Äì Series 4, was released in November 2008. He has also been seen very briefly in the show itself, making a cameo appearance (and wearing a false moustache) in the 2007 Christmas special \\"Voyage of the Damned\\". Also, music from the 2008‚Äì2010 specials was released on 4 October 2010, entitled Doctor Who: Original Television Soundtrack ‚Äì Series 4: The Specials, and on 8 November music from Series 5, entitled Doctor Who: Original Television Soundtrack ‚Äì Series 5, was released. Gold's initial arrangement of the Doctor Who theme did not include \\"middle eight\\" portion originally used in the theme, although he later reinstated it for a rearrangement of the theme introduced in the series' 2005 Christmas episode and subsequently used in the 2006 series of the programme. Gold has created many themes to be associated with various elements of the show, creating two themes for The Doctor (\\"The Doctor's Theme\\" and \\"The Doctor Forever\\"), Rose Tyler, Martha Jones, Donna Noble, Gallifrey, The Master, Astrid Peth, the Cybermen, and the Daleks. Gold re-arranged the Doctor Who opening theme in 2010 for Series 5. With the 2010 series, Gold also created two new musical identities for the Eleventh Doctor (\\"I Am The Doctor\\" and \\"A Madman With A Box,\\" replacing themes previously associated with the Ninth and Tenth Doctors), a theme for Amy Pond, the Silurians and the Daleks. He also continued to use the theme for the Cybermen, as well as several action cues such as \\"Corridors and Fire Escapes\\" and \\"All the Strange, Strange Creatures.\\" Although his music for the 2005 series of Doctor Who relied largely on sampled sounds, his later arrangements for the show, beginning with \\"The Christmas Invasion,\\" have been more orchestral, often being recorded by the BBC National Orchestra of Wales, supplemented by vocal performances with Melanie Pappenheim and others. One of the most well-known orchestral numbers is 'Abigail's Song', sung by Katherine Jenkins, from the 2010 Christmas special \\"A Christmas Carol\\", whose soundtrack was released in March 2011. The orchestral scoring (partly reflecting a larger budget) contrasts strongly with music for the classic 1963-1989 series of Doctor Who, as produced by the BBC Radiophonic Workshop, Mark Ayres et al., which generally had an electronic feel, with innovative instrumentation. Gold also wrote the theme tunes for Doctor Who spin-offs The Sarah Jane Adventures and Torchwood, and composed music for the latter series alongside Ben Foster. A selection of their compositions, entitled Torchwood: Original Television Soundtrack, was made available during August 2008. He arranged the theme tunes to Totally Doctor Who and Doctor Who Confidential, both of which are variations on the Doctor Who theme. Gold has created, arranged and orchestrated three special live concerts for the music from Doctor Who. The first, \\"Doctor Who: A Celebration\\", was played at the Millennium Centre in Cardiff in 2006; the second, the 2008 Doctor Who Prom, was part of the BBC Proms on 24 July 2008 at the Royal Albert Hall in London; the third, the 2010 Doctor Who Prom, was part of the BBC Proms hold on 24 and 25 July 2010 at the Royal Albert Hall again. In March 2010, his Doctor Who soundtrack entered UK radio station Classic FM's Hall of Fame as that year's second highest new entry. In 2011, it remained in the Hall of Fame, but three places lower at number 228 out of 300.\\"Hall of Fame 228\\" Classic FM Retrieved 22 June 2011 Gold announced in February 2018 that he would step down as the programme's composer, having served as the musical director since 2005, and that he would not be composing the music for the eleventh series, which would be instead composed by Segun Akinola. Film, stage and radio Gold has scored a number of British and American films, including the BAFTA-winning Kiss of Life directed by Emily Young, Death at a Funeral directed by Frank Oz and Mischief Night, directed by Penny Woolcock. Other projects include Ant & Dec's 2006 film Alien Autopsy and 2009 drama film Veronika Decides to Die. In 2001, his radio play Electricity was given the Imison Award‚Äînamed after former BBC radio drama script editor Richard Imison‚Äîfor best new play after its broadcast on Radio 3 in 2000. It subsequently transferred to the West Yorkshire Playhouse in 2004 and was performed with Christopher Eccleston in the lead role. Others of his plays include 50 Revolutions performed by the Oxford Stage Company at the Whitehall Theatre, London in 2000 and Resolution at Battersea Arts Centre in 1994. Gold also wrote the radio play Kafka the Musical, broadcast on Easter Sunday 2011 on BBC Radio 3, starring David Tennant. It won the 2013 Tinniswood Award for the Best Original Radio Drama.

In 1895 Norton Malreward was combined with the neighbouring hamlet of Norton Hawkfield (also spelt Hautville) into a single parish, which has a population of 246.  History  Norton Malreward is listed as Nortone in the Domesday Book of 1086, meaning 'the north enclosure' (from the Old English and }}). Malreward is a corruption of the Norman surname Malregard ( ‚Äòevil eye/glance'), that of a tenant of the bishop of Coutances in 1238. During the reign of Edward I the manor was held by John Le Sore of Backwell. Later lords of the manor included Hawisia de Burton, John de Burton, Robert Grayndor, Robert Basset and Sir William Basset. In 1701 the manor was sold to Richard Holder and sold again in 1718 to Francis Freeman and Samuel Prigg. Just north of and overlooking the village is Maes Knoll Tump, a tumulus , and in height, the start of the Wansdyke. The remains of this Iron Age hillfort lie at the eastern end of the Dundry Down ridge. The hillfort consists of a fairly large flat open area, roughly triangular in shape, that was fortified by ramparts and shaping of the steep-sided hilltop around the northern, eastern and southwestern sides of the hill (the flat area in World War II was dotted with stone cairns to deter the landing of enemy gliders to invade Bristol; a detachment of the Dundry Home Guard had a draughty corrugated-iron look-out shed on the top of the tumulus).Bristol Record Office accession 44394 Maes Knoll provides a splendid view over the lands it would have once commanded. From here, there are clear views north to Bristol, east to Bath and the Cotswold Hills, and south over Stanton Drew stone circles to Chew Valley Lake and the Mendip Hills. The parish was part of the hundred of Chew. Ammonites and fossil nautili are abundant in this neighbourhood. The village lies on the route of the Monarch's Way long-distance footpath.  Governance  The parish council has responsibility for local issues, including setting an annual precept (local rate) to cover the council's operating costs and producing annual accounts for public scrutiny. The parish council evaluates local planning applications and works with the local police, district council officers, and neighbourhood watch groups on matters of crime, security, and traffic. The parish council's role also includes initiating projects for the maintenance and repair of parish facilities, such as the village hall or community centre, playing fields and playgrounds, as well as consulting with the district council on the maintenance, repair, and improvement of highways, drainage, footpaths, public transport, and street cleaning. Conservation matters (including trees and listed buildings) and environmental issues are also of interest to the council. Norton Malreward is part of the Chew Valley North Ward, which is represented by one councillor on the unitary authority of Bath and North East Somerset which was created in 1996, as established by the Local Government Act 1992. It provides a single tier of local government with responsibility for almost all local government functions within its area including local planning and building control, local roads, council housing, environmental health, markets and fairs, refuse collection, recycling, cemeteries, crematoria, leisure services, parks, and tourism. It is also responsible for education, social services, libraries, main roads, public transport, trading standards, waste disposal and strategic planning, although fire, police and ambulance services are provided jointly with other authorities through the Avon Fire and Rescue Service, Avon and Somerset Constabulary and the Great Western Ambulance Service. Bath and North East Somerset's area covers part of the ceremonial county of Somerset but it is administered independently of the non- metropolitan county. Its administrative headquarters is in Bath. Between 1 April 1974 and 1 April 1996, it was the Wansdyke district and the City of Bath of the county of Avon. Before 1974 that the parish was part of the Clutton Rural District. The parish is represented in the House of Commons of the Parliament of the United Kingdom as part of North East Somerset. It elects one Member of Parliament (MP) by the first past the post system of election.  Demographics  According to the 2001 Census, the Chew Valley North Ward (which includes Chew Magna and Chew Stoke), had 2,307 residents, living in 911 households, with an average age of 42.3 years. Of these 77% of residents describing their health as 'good', 21% of 16- to 74-year-olds had no qualifications; and the area had an unemployment rate of 1.3% of all economically active people aged 16‚Äì74. In the Index of Multiple Deprivation 2004, it was ranked at 26,243 out of 32,482 wards in England, where 1 was the most deprived LSOA and 32,482 the least deprived.  Religious sites  Church of Holy Trinity The Anglican parish Church of Holy Trinity dates from the late 12th century.

In the Golgulsa temple area can be found the oldest historical Buddhist ruins on Mt. Hamwol and the only cave temple in Korea.  History  Golgulsa Temple (Korean: Í≥®Íµ¥ÏÇ¨, Chinese: È™®Á™üÂØ∫, Pronounced ‚ÄúGol-gul-sa‚Äù) was established on Mt. Hamwolsan, along with Girimsa, by Master Gwangyu and his retinue who came to Korea from India about 1,500 years ago. Golgulsa Temple is the oldest grotto temple in Korea, emulating those in India. According to a painting of Jeong Seon (pen name; Gyeomjae) during the mid-Joseon era, Golgulsa Temple was established by constructing a wooden antechapel in front of several stone grottoes and covering it with tiles. The temple was left in ruins after it was burnt down in the mid to late Joseon era. Then about 70 years ago, the Bak clan of Gyeongju moved there and began reconstruction. The temple was sold to an individual in 1989, but Ven. Seol Jeogun, then head of Girimsa, eventually purchased it. Currently Golgulsa is registered as a branch temple of Bulguksa, the head temple of the 11th religious district, Jogye Order of Korean Buddhism. The seated rock-carved Buddha (Treasure No. 581), the main Buddha of Golgulsa Temple, faces the underwater tomb of King Munmu, and around the Buddha are many grotto Dharma halls, such as Avalokitesvara Grotto, Ksitigarbha Grotto, Medicine Buddha Grotto, Arhat Grotto and Guardian Deities Hall. There are also relics of traditional folk religions such as rocks carved into phalluses and vaginas. Recently ex-Master Monk of Kirimsa (Kirim Temple), Seol Jeog-un constructed a road while simultaneously renovating the Golgulsa Temple.  Cultural properties  Statues of a Deva king The seated rock- carved Buddha of Golgulsa Temple was carved into the limestone cliff in the 9th century during the United Silla Dynasty; it is the main Buddha of the temple. The statue gazes toward the Sea of Japan with a gentle smile and beautiful nimbus in which luxurious lotuses and flames are carved. Nearer the ocean, about 10 kilometers (6 miles) from Golgulsa Temple, are the Gameunsa Temple ruins and the underwater tomb of King Munmu. Located southeast of the seated rock-carved Buddha, the ruins of Gameunsa Temple consist of two Three- Story Stone Pagodas (National Treasure No. 112). Standing 13.4 meters (44 feet) high, the two pagodas are aesthetically pleasing and well balanced; they are regarded as the standard of Korean stone pagodas. Southeast of the ruins lies a small rocky island rising from the ocean; this is the underwater tomb of King Munmu and it is a symbol of King Munmu's will to fend off the invading Japanese even in death. The tomb was established on this rock which is about 200 meters (656 feet) in circumference. Two waterways form a cross shape that divides the island, one running east to west and the other north to south. In a sunken area in the center is a small pool: that is his tomb.  The Breath of Seon  Sunmudo training is composed of: ‚Äústill training,‚Äù which includes ‚Äúchwason,‚Äù or sitting meditation, yoga-like exercises as well as ‚Äúactive training,‚Äù which includes gymnastics and martial arts. There is usually ‚Äústill training‚Äù in the morning and ‚Äúactive training‚Äù in the evening. Golgulsa Temple occupies half a mountain and actually contains several temples, administrative building, training hall, several dormitories, dining hall, and so on.  Sunmudo Martial Art  Golgulsa monk practicing Sunmudo In recent years Golgulsa Temple has established the Seonmudo Practice Center to teach this traditional Buddhist martial art. The formal name of Sunmudo is Bulgyo Geumgang Yeong Gwon. It is a training method taught at Golgulsa Temple designed to extinguish worldly pains and attain enlightenment. The goal of this training is harmonization of mind and body united with breathing. Golgulsa temple has run Sunmudo training programs since 1992 for those who would like to experience the traditions of Korean Seon (Zen) Buddhism including Sonmudo.

Previous structures occupying the urban lots have been demolished, leaving patchy areas of green space that are usually untended and unmanaged, forming an involuntary park. Sometimes, however, the prairie spaces are intentionally created to facilitate amenities, such as green belts, community gardens and wildlife reserve habitats.Graybill, Jessica K. \\"Rust-to-Resilience: Local Responses to Urban Vulnerabilities in Utica, New York.\\" In Dooling, Sarah & Simon, Greg, eds. (2012). [https://books.google.com/books?id=jU0gGCBkLAUC&pg;=PA176 ' 'Cities, Nature and Development: The Policies and Production of Urban Vulnerabilities], p. 176. Ashgate Publishing Limited. History Detroit neighborhoods as abandoned houses are demolished. Urban prairies can result from several factors. The value of aging buildings may fall too low to provide financial incentives for their owners to maintain them. Vacant properties may have resulted from deurbanization or crime, or may have been seized by local government as a response to unpaid property taxes. Since vacant structures can pose health and safety threats (such as fire hazards), or be used as a location for criminal activity, cities often demolish them. Sometimes areas are cleared of buildings as part of a revitalization plan with the intention of redeveloping the land. In flood-prone areas, government agencies may purchase developed lots and then demolish the structures to improve drainage during floods. Some neighborhoods near major industrial or environmental clean-up sites are acquired and leveled to create a buffer zone and minimize the risks associated with pollution or industrial accidents. Such areas may become nothing more than fields of overgrown vegetation, which then provide habitat for wildlife. Sometimes it is possible for residents of the city to fill up the unplanned empty space with urban parks or community gardens.Gallagher, John (2010). Reimagining Detroit: Opportunities for Redefining an American City, p. 24. Wayne State University Press. Urban prairie is sometimes planned by the government or non-profit groups for community gardens and conservation, to restore or reintroduce a wildlife habitat, help the environment, and educate people about the prairie.Missouri Conservation News Detroit, Michigan is one particular city that has many urban prairies. In the case of the city of Christchurch in New Zealand, earthquake damage from the 2011 earthquake caused the underground water table to raise and leak significantly in places, preventing reconstruction of damaged buildings. Many former residential areas in eastern Christchurch suburbs have been purchased by the government and demolished, as the soft soil causes the houses to shift and pose significant danger to the inhabitants. It is unknown if many of the waterlogged areas of Christchurch will ever fully recover. Urban prairies may be established to lower the burden of mowing and related upkeep by the governmental entity that is overseeing it, letting weeds develop.

The committee was composed of the painters Eug√®ne Delacroix, Carrier-Belleuse, and Puvis de Chavannes, and among the exhibitors were L√©on Bonnat, Jean-Baptiste Carpeaux, Charles-Fran√ßois Daubigny, Gustave Dor√©, and √âdouard Manet. In 1864, just after the death of Delacroix, the society organized a retrospective exhibition of 248 paintings and lithographs of this famous painter and step- uncle of the emperor ‚Äì and ceased to mount further exhibitions. The 19th century in French art is characterised by a continuous struggle between traditionally educated artists supported by official politics, and a growing rate of artists who preferred to work individually and at their own risks. Reviewing the historical situation is difficult, even a century later. But evidently opponents to the official politics gained ground after the fall of the 2nd Empire, and were instrumental to redirect French cultural politics to liberal positions. Thus, the splitting-off of the Soci√©t√© Nationale des Beaux- Arts in 1890 can be considered as the first Secessionist manifestation. 1890 In 1890, the Soci√©t√© Nationale des Beaux-Arts was re-vitalised under the rule of Puvis de Chavannes, Ernest Meissonier, Carolus-Duran, Bracquemond and Carrier-Belleuse, and since then its annual exhibition was reviewed as the Salon de Champ-de-Mars, traditionally opening a fortnight later than the official Salon de Champs-√âlys√©es, organised by the Soci√©t√© des artistes fran√ßais. Suzanne Valadon became the first female painter to be admitted to the Soci√©t√© in 1894. A new way After World War I, in 1926, the \\"Puvis de Chavannes\\" prize was created consisting in a retrospective exhibition of the main works of the prizewinning artists, in Paris. During the twentieth century, this exhibition was located at the Grand Palais or the Mus√©e d'Art Moderne.

It is located on Lake Erie, adjacent to Long Point. The lakeside community has a population of fewer than 1500 people and sports a number of traditional small businesses such as Twin's Ice Cream Parlour, which has been operating in the town for decades. Walking through Port Rowan is simple provided that caution is taken around traffic. The streets can get busy at times but the amount of traffic is light compared to cities like Hamilton, Kitchener, or London. Recommended activities include walking, hiking, running, and cycling. While most of the streets have sidewalks, people are safer to walk in a single line. Walking in this community is possible on a year-round basis and most of the streets are gravel unlike Delhi or Langton where the streets are asphalt.Port Rowan Urban Trail information at Ontario Trails Port Rowan is the home of Robert F. Hill, a film director, screenwriter and actor who worked in Hollywood from the 1910s to the 1960s; specializing in silent films. History Port Rowan's earliest known inhabitants, from around the year 1000 until approximately 300‚Äì350 years later, were the Algonquin nation. They were noted flint-workers and evidence of the skill in crafting arrowheads is still to be found in open worked field areas surrounding the hamlet. The next wave of inhabitants were the Attawandaron nation, the Neutrals, who occupied the region from about 1350 until their absorption by the Iroquois in the year 1651. The last significant native nation to occupy the area was the Mississaugas. Key buildings, including John Backhouse\`s mill, that date back to the 18th century, remain in existence today. During the War of 1812 American soldiers burned all the mills on Lake Erie\`s north shore, from the St Clair River to the Grand River, except for the Backhouse mill, and one other. According to Ron Brown, in ‚Ä≥The Lake Erie Shore: Ontario's Forgotten South Coast‚Ä≥, Backhouse\`s mill was skipped due to powerful connections within the USA. The South Norfolk Railway reached Port Rowan in 1886. It was acquired by the Canadian National Railway, which operated it until 1965. By the mid-1960s, Port Rowan was noted for its close proximity to hunting, fishing, and recreation. However, the practicing dentist of that time choose to retire after serving the community since the 1930s. As a result, approximately 6000 people were in dire need of a dentist.Dentist Required at Google Books In 1970 New Democratic Party MPP Morton Shulman asserted that Port Rowan was the destination of secret meetings of mafia leaders. In 2001, Haldimand-Norfolk was dissolved into two separate single-tier counties. Port Rowan became part of the newly formed County of Norfolk. In 2017, Port Rowan was officially named the birdhouse capital of Canada.  Demographics  The majority of Port Rowan's residents between 70‚Äì79 years of age as of 2016; meaning that most Port Rowan residents stopped being members of the active work force around 2006 and lack the computerized skills needed for many of today's jobs. Most of the residents were born in Canada, but there are 25 individuals who were born in the United States of America and nearly 200 people born in Europe. English is the most commonly spoken language there; although other languages are spoken by a fair amount of the residents.

It is a United Empire Loyalists cemetery which has at least 498 individuals and/or families stored underneath the ground. Winter grave decorations are permitted while live plants are not permitted to be on the cemetery grounds. Common last names found at the cemetery include Abbott, Backhouse, Backus, Bantam, Brown, and Chamberlain.Bayview Cemetery at Port Rowan, Ontario at Find a Grave The oldest female buried at this cemetery is Emma Dedrick (who died in 1838 in her second year) while the oldest male buried in this cemetery is Thomas Backhouse (who died in 1849 in his 64th year). Due to the community being mainly inhabited by elderly people and people who are currently unable to find jobs in other communities, there are currently no Millennials (people born between 1980 and 2005) buried in this cemetery.Memorials in Bayview Cemetery at Find a Grave Economy During the 18th century fishing, milling, and timber processing were the main industries, exploiting the water power of nearby watercourses. In 1850 the town processed of timber. 1850 marked the beginning of shipbuilding in Port Rowan. With the decline of the fishing, lumber and milling industries, tourism is the main economic activity in the region. Local sports include angling and boating in the Long Point Inner Bay and golfing at Stark's Golf Course at the edge of town. Bird Studies Canada is based at Port Rowan. Port Rowan in 2011 built a state of the art Water Treatment Plant, which assures future growth capacity in the town and its burgeoning retirement community. Its proximity to Long Point, a major bird flight-path, and World Biosphere Reserve, makes Port Rowan a popular destination for bird-watchers. Some of the few remaining stands the old growth Carolinian forest that were present all over Southern Ontario can be found near Port Rowan.

Calls to Tillsonburg are considered to be long-distance to Port Rowan residents so that banking by phone simply isn't an option. The majority of the retirement population must choose between maintaining a vehicle on the road or having Internet access due to old age pension payments not matching up to the rising cost of goods and services. All the small businesses were not equipped to deal with Internet banking and may face significant financial difficulties in the future. Online banking has gained popularity in both urban and rural areas due to its fast and reliable service.CIBC to close Port Rowan, Jarvis branches at Simcoe Reformer The Long Point Country Chamber of Commerce was attempting to attract a credit union in the town similar in nature to Tangerine but to no avail. Meanwhile, the well-established banks are removing their presence away from the rural communities of Ontario at a fast pace. Places like Service Ontario and the Backus Heritage Conservation Area are destined to face some form of setbacks as a result of the bank closure and may have to stop operating; leading to an almost-immediate loss of jobs in the area.CIBC will transfer accounts to Hagersville at Simcoe Reformer It was suggested that Port Rowan was going to experience Internet speeds and a level of reliability that is roughly comparable to Delhi by the year 2020 thanks to an underground cable system. This underground cable system would be similar to those found in communities like Langton, Courtland, and St. Williams, giving reliable broadband Internet access that was not normally found in the area during the start of the 21st century. There are plans to eventually the entirety of Southwestern Ontario into some form of high-speed Internet/cable television service sometime within the next 30 years.High-speed Internet coming to Courtland at Simcoe Reformer Climate From the late 1990s onwards, winters became more mild due to changes in climate brought on by global warming. Port Rowan traditionally belongs to the humid continental climate zone, even with the recent mild winters and warmer dry summers. Like in all communities, towns, and cities throughout the world, global warming due to human industrial activity has drastically altered the climate of Port Rowan throughout the decades. Port Rowan's first mild winter since Confederation occurred in the year 1975. The warmest summers that Port Rowan has witnessed occurred in 1998, 2003, 2005, 2006, 2007, 2009 (with the exception of the month of July), 2010, 2012, 2013, 2014, 2015 and 2016. Should the sea levels rise by , Port Rowan would not be affected by flooding. However, it may be affected by droughts as a by-product of the dislocation of available freshwater and may be forced to rely on desalinated salt water piped in from the Eastern United States. Constructing the proper infrastructure to carry the water hundreds of miles away would take considerable manpower along with significant economic costs and an unprecedented level of cooperation from multiple federal, state/provincial, and municipal governments.

Early life Champ was born in Maldon, Essex, England the son of Captain Thomas Champ and his wife Mary Anne n√©e Blackaller. Champ was educated at the Royal Military College, Sandhurst. He joined the army as an ensign when 18 years old and later became an adjutant. Army and police career Champ was serving with the 63rd Regiment of Foot as an ensign by 1826 and was posted with them to Sydney, New South Wales in October 1828. Some of the regiment was detached as a garrison force for the Macquarie Harbour Penal Station, Van Diemens Land (now Tasmania) in 1829, and Champ was amongst them. As a lieutenant with the 63rd, he took part in the Black War campaign which was an attempt to segregate Tasmanian Aborigines near the end of 1830. The 63rd left New South Wales and Van Diemens Land in 1834 to deploy to India and Burma and Champ left with the regiment. However, he had apparently enjoyed his time in Australia and later in 1834 he resigned his army commission and returned to Van Diemens Land to enter the civil service. Champ then became an assistant police magistrate, before being appointed as the commandant of Port Arthur penitentiary (succeeding Charles O'Hara Booth) in 1844. Political career In 1852 Champ became a colonial secretary to Governor Denison. In the 1850s, the British parliament passed legislation that would give Tasmania a responsible 'independent' government. This created the Tasmanian House of Assembly. The first elections for the House of Assembly took place in 1856. Prior to this Champ was a member of the Tasmanian Legislative Council chosen by the Governor from 1852 until 1856. He was elected as the member for Launceston in the new House of Assembly and became first Premier of the responsible government on 1 November 1856. Champ held office of premier for 117 days, until 26 February 1857. Shortly into his term, his ministry collapsed and he was unable to govern. He was briefly opposition leader in 1857 but resigned shortly after. He left Tasmania and became inspector-general of penal establishments in Victoria. He later entered politics in Victoria, becoming a member of the Victorian Legislative Assembly for East Bourke Boroughs from April 1871 until May 1873. He died in Melbourne, Victoria on 25 August 1892. References * Parliamentary Library profile *John V.

In passing in Chad (also a French colony then), he entered in active politics in the Chadian Progressive Party (PPT), a nationalist and radical African political party founded in 1947 and led by Gabriel Lisette. By 1958, he had left the PPT to form with others the Chadian National Union (UNT), a Muslim progressive party, but he turned quite early to the PPT and, after the independence of Chad, was minister of Education of the President Fran√ßois Tombalbaye. However the President's discrimination against Muslims in Chad brought him to become a member of the rebel insurgent group FROLINAT, formed in 1966 to oppose the rule of Tombalbaye. After the death of the organization's first secretary-general in 1968, a vicious battle for leadership ensued, which terminated with the victory of Siddick in 1969, even though he was perceived as an Anti-Arab and was suspected of being a moderate leftist and not having any revolutionary apprenticeship. He made Tripoli the headquarters of the front; and Libya took the place of Sudan as key supplier of the FROLINAT. While he was internationally recognized as the head of the FROLINAT, he was losing control of the units on the ground. In 1971 he tried to reassert his authority by proposing to unify the insurgent forces active in Chad, but Goukouni Oueddei, head of the Second Liberation Army of the FROLINAT, broke with Siddick, who managed to at least keep a loose control over the First Liberation Army. Siddick's fragile authority depended much on Libyan support (which was official from 1971) but when in 1973 there was a rapprochement between Libya and Chad, Siddick was forced to move his headquarters from Tripoli to Algiers. What nominal control was left over the troops on the ground completely vanished in 1976, when almost all his cadres rebelled against his authority and accused him of never hearing his lieutenants and of never going himself to the field of operations. The rebels, led by Mahamat Abba Sa√Ød, assumed control over most of the First Liberation Army of the FROLINAT, that became known under his leadership simply as the First Army. Two years later, in 1978, he lost even his formal leadership of the movement when in a congress of the FROLINAT held in Faya-Largeau, Goukouni was nominated leader. The collapse of all central authority in Chad, in 1979, gave Siddick as leader of a so-called \\"Original FROLINAT\\" (FROLINAT Originel) a chance to re-enter the fray. But he, Ahmat Acyl, Mohamat Said, and Adoum Dana were excluded from the first peace conference held at Kano in Nigeria in March. When these excluded people threatened to build a counter-government, they were invited to a new peace conference at Kano, in April. In this meeting, the resolution of Hiss√®ne Habr√© and Goukouni Oueddei to not let those not present at Kano I to enter in the new government failed, as Sidick, Dana, and Acyl were accused by both of not having any troops on the ground. In retaliation, a pro-Libyan counter-government was formed by Siddick, Acyl, and Said, called Front for Joint Provisional Action (FACP), shortly after called Revolutionary Democratic Council (CDR). This led to the first conference of Lagos, which was boycotted by the major forces: only at the second and last peace conference at Lagos did the Transitional Government of National Unity (GUNT) finally emerge, in which all forces were represented. In the Lagos Accord, approved on the August 21, Goukouni Oueddei became President, Habr√© Defence Minister, Acyl Foreign Minister and Siddick Health Minister. Siddick at first remained with Goukouni when Habr√© broke with the GUNT in 1980, but when in January 1981 Goukouni and the Libyan President Qaddafi issued a joint communiqu√© stating that Chad and Libya had agreed to \\"work for the realization of complete unity between the two countries\\", he and the Union pour la d√©mocratie et la paix (UDP) tried to depose Goukouni and become independent of Libya. Shortly after this, Siddick broke with the GUNT and fled in exile to Sudan, ceasing to play any part in the civil war. Siddick died in Paris on 1 December 2017, three weeks before his 93th birthday.

Background Fraser River Pile & Dredge Ltd. (\\"Fraser River\\") owned a derrick barge \\"Sceptre Squamish\\", that it chartered to Can-Dive Services Ltd. (\\"Can-Dive\\"). Can-Dive accidentally sank the barge while it was chartered. Fraser River collected on a $1.1 million insurance policy for the barge. The original policy between Fraser River and its insurer contained a subrogation clause which waived the insurer's right of subrogation against any third parties. Fraser River and its insurer entered an agreement which waived the original subrogation waiver, intending to allow the insurance company and Fraser River to sue Can-Dive. In its defence, Can-Dive claimed the insurer already waived its subrogation rights and so could not unwaive them. The question before the Supreme Court was whether Can-Dive could rely on the waiver of subrogation in the original insurance policy. Reasons of the court Justice Iacobucci, writing for a unanimous court, held in favour of Can-Dive on the basis it was able to rely on the subrogation clause. The case turned on the existence of any exceptions to privity. Iacobucci first affirmed the existence of an agency exception to privity, and then expanded on the \\"principled exception to the privity of contract doctrine\\" established in London Drugs Ltd v Kuehne & Nagel International Ltd. He noted that in cases where the agency exception did not apply, as in this case, courts \\"may nonetheless undertake the appropriate analysis, bounded by both common sense and commercial reality, in order to determine whether the doctrine of privity with respect to third-party beneficiaries should be relaxed\\". This principled approached, he believed, was preferable to having \\"yet another ad hoc exception\\". A two-stage test was devised to determine if the exception could be applied: \\"(a) Did the parties to the contract intend to extend the benefit in question to the third party seeking to rely on the contractual provision? and (b) Are the activities performed by the third party seeking to rely on the contractual provision the very activities contemplated as coming within the scope of the contract in general, or the provision in particular, again as determined by reference to the intentions of the parties?\\" (see decision at para 31) Iacobucci acknowledged this exception was a departure from the doctrine of privity. However, it was only \\"incremental\\" in nature and did not abdicate any existing principles. Since the exception was dependent on the intention within the contract, it would not frustrate the expectations of the parties to the contract. On the facts, Iacobucci found the policy was clearly intending to extend a benefit to Can-Dive satisfying the first stage. It was noted that parties to a contract cannot unilaterally revoke the rights of a third party once they have received an actual benefit. On the second stage, the requirements were easily satisfied since Can-Dive was acting in accordance with the charter agreement.

Houghton Mifflin Company, 1992. The 195 model was also used by the United States Air Force, United States Army, and Army National Guard as a light transport and utility aircraft under the designations LC-126/U-20.Harding 1997, pp. 82‚Äì83. Development The Cessna 190 and 195 were Cessna's only postwar radial- engined aircraft. The first prototype flew in 1945, after the end of World War II and both the 190 and 195 entered production in 1947.Plane and Pilot: 1978 Aircraft Directory, page 92. Werner & Werner Corp, Santa Monica CA, 1977. The 195 was the first Cessna airplane to be completely constructed of aluminum and features a cantilever wing, similar to the pre-war Cessna 165 from which it is derived. The wing differs from later Cessna light aircraft in that it has a straight taper from root chord to tip chord and no dihedral. The airfoil employed is a NACA 2412, the same as used on the later Cessna 150, 172 and 182. The 190/195 fuselage is large in comparison to other Cessna models because the 42\\" diameter radial engine had to be accommodated in the nose. There are two rows of seats: two individual seats in the first row, with a comfortable space between them and up to three passengers can be accommodated on a bench seat in the second row. The 190/195 has flat sprung-steel landing gear legs derived from Cessna's purchase of the rights to Steve Wittman's Big X. Many have been equipped with swiveling crosswind landing gear which allows landing with up to 15 degrees of crab. While the crosswind gear simplifies the actual landing, it makes the aircraft difficult to handle on the ground. The 195 is equipped with a retractable step that extends when the cabin door is opened, although some have been modified to make the step a fixed unit. The aircraft was expensive to purchase and operate for private use and Cessna therefore marketed them mainly as a business aircraft under the name \\"Businessliner\\". The engines fitted to the 190 and 195 became well known for their oil consumption. The aircraft has a oil tank, with the minimum for flight. Typical oil consumption with steel cylinder barrels is per hour. A factory-produced floatplane version was equipped with a triple tail for improved yaw stability. The tail resembles that of the Lockheed Constellation. The Cessna 195 produces a cruise true airspeed of (170 MPH) on a fuel consumption of per hour. It can accommodate five people. Including the LC-126s, a total of 1180 190s and 195s were built. The 190 was originally introduced at a price of USD$12,750 in 1947 (). When production ended in 1954 the price had risen to USD$24,700 () for the 195B. This compared to USD$3,495 for the Cessna 140 two seater of the same period.Christy. Joe: The Complete Guide to Single Engine Cessna, 3rd Edition, page 12. Tab Books, 1979. LC-126/U-20 The LC-126 was the military version of the Cessna 195 and could be fitted with skis or floats. 83 LC-126s were delivered, including: *USAF - Cessna LC-126 - 15 *Army National Guard - Cessna LC-126B - 5 *US Army - Cessna LC-126C - 63 Once made surplus the majority of LC-126s were sold as civil aircraft, once modified by a Cessna civil kit. Operational history The Cessna 190 and 195 are considered \\"one of the finest classics ever built\\" by pilots and collectors and are much sought after on the used aircraft market. Brazilian-registered Cessna 195 at Marte airfield, Sao Paulo in 1975 On July 24, 2017 the number of 190s and 195s still registered in the USA were: *86 Cessna 190 *225 Cessna 195 *125 Cessna 195A *126 Cessna 195B In February 2014 there were three Cessna 190s, eleven Cessna 195s, two Cessna 195As and two Cessna 195Bs registered in Canada.

His most significant book was The New Found World, or Antarctike which compiled a number of different sources and his own experience into what purported to be a first hand account of his experiences in France Antarctique, a French settlement near modern Rio de Janeiro. Life Andr√© Thevet Cosmographie du Levant, 1556, Lyon. Thevet was born in Angoul√™me. At ten years of age, he entered the convent of Franciscans of Angoul√™me. He visited Italy at the same time as Guillaume Rondelet. In 1549, thanks to the support of John, Cardinal of Lorraine, he embarked on an extended exploration trip to Asia, Greece, Rhodes,Jean-Pierre Thiollet, Bodream ou r√™ve de Bodrum, Anagramme Editions, 2010, p. 94. Palestine and Egypt. He accompanied the French ambassador Gabriel de Luetz to Istanbul. Almost immediately after this, he set sail again as the chaplain of the fleet of Nicolas Durand de Villegaignon intended to establish a French colony near what is now Rio de Janeiro. Thevet arrived there on 10 Nov 1555 but only stayed in the colony for about 10 weeks before returning to France. He was made an almoner to Catherine de M√©dici and later was employed by the king. Thevet claimed in his Histoire de deux voyages, inaccurately, to have accompanied Guillaume Testu to America in 1550. Thevet died in Paris on 23 November 1590. Career Soon after Thevet's return to France from the near East in 1554, he published an account of his voyage under the title of Cosmography of the Levant. On return from the Americas, Thevet in 1557 or 1558 published a book, Les singularitez de la France Antarctique. Although purportedly based on his first hand experiences, Thevet also used previous published sources, but also verbal accounts from other explorers and sailors, and from indigenous Canadians who had been brought back to France. Thevet later settled a court case with another scholar who claimed to have been responsible for the actual writing. An edition of Les singularitez de la France Antarctique was printed in Antwerp by Plantin in 1558 and an English edition, The New Found World, or Antarctike, was printed in 1568. Thevet's use of such a variety of sources not otherwise printed, despite the considerable errors and contradictions, means that his work remains valuable for the ethnography of both eastern Canada and Brazil. Les singularitez de la France Antarctique contains the first descriptions in European texts of plants such as the manioc, pineapples, peanuts and tobacco, as well as of the animals macaw, sloth and tapir. The text includes an account of cannibalism that was one of the influences on Montaigne's essay on cannibalism. Once Thevet was established as cosmographer to the French court he compiled his Cosmographie Universelle, intended to describe every part of the known world. A dispute arose with a collaborator, Fran√ßois de Belleforest, who left Thevet's employ to publish his own Cosmographie in 1572 before Thevet's work finally appeared in 1575. In 1584 Thevet published a collection of biographies, Vrais pourtraits et vies des homes illustres, which was critical of Protestants. He left two unpublished manuscripts. One was an almanac of islands, Grand Insulaire, and the other, Histoire de deux voyages was an account of his travels.  Works  * 1554 Cosmographie de Levant. Lyon : Ian de Tournes et Guil.

Early life Gregson was born in Buckton, Northumberland, England, the son of John Gregson who was the nephew of Anthony Gregson, Snr. (d. 1806) the squire of Lowlynn. John Gregson possibly lived at Lowlynn with his family but was not the landowner of that estate. In 1806 Anthony Gregson Jnr inherited: Thomas George Gregson was to inherit from his bachelor cousin Anthony Gregson but after a family dispute Lowlynn passed to another family member a Henry Knight, son of the Rev. Thomas Knight of Ford. Thomas Gregson was educated in Edinburgh and migrated to Van Diemen's Land, (later renamed Tasmania) in 1821 with his wife as the result of the family differences. He brought over ¬£3000 with him and was given a grant of 2500 acres (10 km¬≤). Subsequently, he received an additional 1000 acres (4 km¬≤). Gregson was made a magistrate and in 1825 was assisting Andrew Bent in his conflict with Governor Arthur for the liberty of the press. Political career In July 1842 Gregson became a member of the Tasmanian Legislative Council, and three years later led the opposition to the governor, Sir Eardley-Wilmot, in his attempt to raise the import duties. Shortly afterwards he resigned with five other members as a protest against the voting of expenditure the colony could not bear, and, among other things, the statement by the governor that he would carry the estimates by his casting vote. The six members became known as \\"the patriotic six\\" and Gregson was presented by the colonists with two thousand guineas and a piece of plate. At the end of 1850 he was elected to the new legislative council, and, when responsible government was granted, was elected a member of the Tasmanian House of Assembly for Richmond in September 1856 and held the seat for many years. On 14 February 1857 Gregson moved and carried a motion in favour of reductions in the salaries of the governor, colonial secretary, colonial treasurer and attorney-general. The William Champ ministry resigned and Gregson became premier and colonial secretary. But he was found to be unsuitable for his office; he lacked moderation, self-control and tact, and his government was defeated about eight weeks later. He was never in office again, though often a turbulent critic of other administrations. In January 1862 he was more than once committed to the custody of the sergeant-at-arms and was once expelled from the house. He retired from parliament not long before his death at Risdon on 4 January 1874. He was survived by his wife and two spinster daughters; a son John Compton Gregson (died 1867) was a Hobart barrister and attorney-general in the Gregson cabinet. Legacy Gregson was also an amateur artist and exhibited at the first art exhibitions held in Hobart in 1845 and 1846. He is represented in the Beattie collection at Launceston by a sketch of the Rev. Robert Knopwood on his white horse. He worked hard for the good of the colony to the neglect of his own interests for he died comparatively poor. Gregson was particularly important as a reformer in his early days, fighting for the liberty of the press, for trial by jury, and the abolishment of penal transportation. His 58 days in office marks the shortest tenure of any Tasmanian Premier. References *F. C.

She denied she had ever been in the house of murder victim Marion Ross, but Detective Constable McKie was initially suspended, then sacked, then arrested by Strathclyde Police in 1998, and tried and acquitted in 1999. A scandal subsequently developed because of allegations of misconduct on the part of the SCRO and the police. With continuing public concern over what became known as the Shirley McKie fingerprint scandal, Scottish Justice Secretary Kenny MacAskill announced in March 2008, that a public inquiry into the case would begin in September of that year (see Fingerprint Inquiry).Scottish Police Services Authority : Public Inquiry FAQ Case in brief On 6 January 1997, the body of Marion Ross was found in her home in Kilmarnock. She had been stabbed multiple times during what is presumed to have been an act of housebreaking. David Asbury, a handyman who had once worked on the Ross house, developed as a suspect. A fingerprint found on a tin box in Asbury's home was reported to be that of Marion Ross by examiners at the Scottish Criminal Records Office. The SCRO also reported they had identified a fingerprint found on the gift tag on an unopened Christmas present inside the Ross home as that of David Asbury. While checking other, unidentified fingerprints from the victim's home, examiners reported one of those prints to have been identified as Constable McKie's. During Asbury's murder trial in which he was found guilty, McKie testified she had not been inside the home and could not have left her fingerprint. Because Marion Ross was known to hoard possessions, making it possible for Asbury to have left a print on the gift tag years earlier while he was working at the home, the print on the tin box in Asbury's home became the key piece of evidence in the case against him. McKie's testimony at Asbury's trial that she could not have left a print inside the Ross home implied, if true, that the SCRO examiners were capable of error in a fingerprint comparison. David Asbury was subsequently freed from a life sentence due to questions raised about the identification of the print on the tin box.  Exonerated of perjury charge  In March 1998, DC McKie was arrested and charged with perjury. However, in May 1999, the Scottish jury at the High Court of Justiciary rejected the SCRO's fingerprint evidence and McKie was unanimously found not guilty of perjury. U.S. fingerprint experts Pat Wertheim and David Grieve testified during McKie's trial that the fingerprint inside the Ross house was not McKie's.  Compensation suits and payment  McKie sued her employers regarding the manner in which she was arrested. She lost the case against Strathclyde Police in February 2003 and faced a legal bill of ¬£13,000. McKie faced bankruptcy as a result, but an anonymous donor paid the legal bill in June 2004, and McKie was reported to be \\"absolutely overjoyed\\". A second civil action was then raised suing the Scottish Executive amongst others on the basis that a malicious prosecution had been caused by dishonesty of the SCRO fingerprint experts. On the morning that this was to be heard, in February 2006, McKie was offered and accepted ¬£750,000 from the Scottish Executive in full settlement of her compensation claim, without admission of liability. The case was then dropped. At an earlier stage of the case against the Scottish Executive the Lord Advocate Colin Boyd argued that expert witnesses should always be immune from prosecution - even if they gave false evidence.  Parliamentary inquiry  The Scottish parliament decided to refer the McKie case to its Justice 1 Committee whose inquiry began in April 2006 and took evidence from more than 30 witnesses. Ms McKie, accompanied by her father Iain and a team of legal advisers, appeared before the committee of MSPs on 23 May 2006.McKie appears before parliamentary inquiry Her accusers - the four SCRO fingerprint officers Hugh Macpherson, Fiona McBride, Anthony McKenna and Charles Stewart - appeared a week later on 30 May 2006. The Justice 1 Committee proceeded to request the Scottish Executive to provide it with four McKie case reports: *the Mackay report *two reports by fingerprint expert, John MacLeod *the report by independent expert, Michael Pass Although the Lord Advocate, Colin Boyd, responded by refusing to release the Mackay report for reasons relating to \\"fundamental principles of our democracy, including the presumption of innocence\\", Justice minister Cathy Jamieson agreed to release to MSPs reports by John MacLeod and Michael Pass. Despite Boyd's refusal, a leaked copy of Mackay's 56-page report was published by the BBC. In September 2006, the four fingerprint officers were reported to have been offered a deal by the SCRO to resign or take early retirement. Their union, Unison, criticised the timing of the offer (before the Justice 1 Committee had reported) and argued that the SCRO officers were being \\"harassed\\". The report of the Justice 1 committee of the Scottish parliament published its 230-page report on 15 February 2007 (pages 189-190 deal specifically with Ms McKie's out-of-court settlement).  Public inquiry  Following the out-of-court settlement, Opposition parties in the Scottish parliament called for a public inquiry to be held into the McKie case. In March 2006, Shirley McKie's father, Iain, and Dr Jim Swire, father of Lockerbie bombing victim Flora, met to launch a campaign for a judicial inquiry which they hoped would investigate recent revelations of a link between the McKie case and the Pan Am Flight 103 bombing trial. After the meeting, Dr Swire said: :\\"The reputation of our country and its criminal justice system will depend upon how these cases are sorted out.\\"Iain McKie and Dr Jim Swire call for judicial inquiry However, the Scottish Executive ruled out any question of a judicial inquiry (which has the power to compel the attendance of witnesses) whilst Shirley McKie and her family announced their campaign for a public inquiry would end on 9 January 2007 - exactly ten years after the Marion Ross murder investigation began: :\\"We have given ten years of our lives to this and we are not giving any more. It is the politicians' job now to do something about it,\\" said her father, Iain McKie. \\"It is not our role to fight for justice: it is their role.\\"McKie's campaign for public inquiry to end In March 2008 it was announced that a public inquiry would be held. In October 2008 a public inquiry into the case was opened in Glasgow, led by former Northern Ireland judge Sir Anthony Campbell. A procedural hearing was scheduled for 21 November 2008 and proceedings started in June 2009.The Fingerprint Inquiry, Scotland  Inquiry proceedings  Sir Anthony Campbell opened the inquiry proceedings at 10.30 am on Tuesday 2 June 2009 in Maryhill Community Central Hall, Glasgow. Following Sir Anthony's introductory statement, senior counsel to the inquiry Gerry Moynihan QC made a public presentation of all the material that has been collected. Thereafter, lawyers for the core participants are expected to make their opening statements. The hearing of oral evidence was scheduled to commence at 10.15 am on Tuesday 9 June. Following the hearing of evidence at the Inquiry during 2009 the Chairman Sir Anthony Campbell published his report on 14 December 2011 in Glasgow. A full copy of this report can be obtained online at Fingerprint Inquiry homepage.  Protest song  Scottish folk singer and poet Michael Marra has written a protest song condemning the way the McKie case was handled. The lyrics include: \\"I am Shirley McKie. She is me and I am she. You are too, Shirley is you. We are she because Shirley is we.\\" And referring to first minister Jack McConnell, they say, \\"We lecture children if they're telling lies, they will not prosper and they will not thrive...

His family name is the double-barrelled name \\"Scott Moncrieff\\". Early life Charles Kenneth Michael Scott Moncrieff was born at Weedingshall, Stirlingshire, in 1889,J.M. Scott Moncrieff and L.W. Lunn (eds), C.K. Scott Moncrieff: Memories and Letters, (1930), p. 1 the youngest son of William George (1846‚Äì1927), Advocate, Sheriff Substitute, and Jessie Margaret Scott Moncrieff (1858‚Äì1936). He had two elder brothers Colin William (1879‚Äì1943), the father of the Scottish author and playwright George Scott Moncrieff, and John Irving (1881‚Äì1920). Education=Winchester College In 1903, Scott Moncrieff was accepted as a scholar to Winchester College.Memories and Letters, p. 8. In 1907, while a scholar at Winchester College, Scott Moncrieff met Christopher Sclater Millard, bibliographer of Wildeana and private secretary to Oscar Wilde's literary executor and friend Robbie Ross.Maureen Borland, Wilde's Devoted Friend: A Life of Robert Ross (Oxford: Lennard Press, 1990) In 1908, he published a short story, 'Evensong and Morwe Song', in the pageant issue of New Field, a literary magazine of which he was the editor.See David Leavitt and Mark Mitchell (eds.), Pages Passed from Hand to Hand: The Hidden Tradition of Homosexual Literature in English from 1748 to 1914 (1998), pp. 375‚Äì80 The story's sensational opening implies fellatio between two boys at a fictional public school 'Gainsborough' but its action principally concerns the hypocrisy of William Carruthers, the elder of the boys, who as headmaster of 'Cheddar' school, goes on to expel, for the same offence, the son of the boy he seduced. The story was republished in 1923 by Uranian publisher John Murray in an edition of fifty copies for private circulation only.Timothy d'Arch Smith, Love in Earnest: Some Notes on the Lives and Writings of English \\"Uranian\\" Poets from 1889 to 1930 (1970), p. 147 The magazine was hastily suppressed, but it is unclear whether Scott Moncrieff was himself expelled. Edinburgh University After Winchester, Scott Moncrieff attended Edinburgh University, where he undertook two degrees, one in Law and then one in English Literature. Thereafter, he began an MA in Anglo-Saxon under the supervision of the respected man of letters, George Saintsbury. In 1913 he won The Patterson Bursary in Anglo Saxon and graduated in 1914 with first class honours. This stood him in good stead for his translation of Beowulf five years later. During his time at Edinburgh, Scott Moncrieff met Philip Bainbrigge, then an undergraduate at Trinity College, Cambridge, later a schoolmaster at Shrewsbury and the author of miscellaneous homoerotic odes to Uranian Love.D'Arch Smith, Love in Earnest, pp. 148‚Äì50 Bainbrigge was killed in action at √âpehy in September 1918. First World War and after In August 1914 Scott Moncrieff was given a commission in the Kings Own Scottish Borderers and served with the 2nd Battalion on the Western Front from 1914 to 1917. He made a conversion to Catholicism while at the Front in 1915.Memories and Letters, pp. 92-3. On 23 April 1917, while leading the 1st Battalion in the Battle of Arras he was seriously wounded by a shell explosion which tore into his left leg. Although he avoided amputation, his injuries disqualified him from further active service and left him permanently lame.Memories and Letters, pp. 127‚Äì8 After his release from hospital in March 1918, Scott Moncrieff worked in the War Office in Whitehall. He supplemented his income by writing reviews for the New Witness, a literary magazine edited by G. K. Chesterton. At the January 1918 wedding of Robert Graves, Scott Moncrieff met the war poet Wilfred Owen in whose work he took a keen interest. Through his role at the War Office Scott Moncrieff attempted to secure Owen a Home posting which would have prevented his return to the Front. According to Owen's biographer the evidence suggests a 'brief sexual relationship that somehow failed'.Dominic Hibberd, Wilfred Owen: A New Biography (2002), p. 315 After Owen's death, Scott Moncrieff's failure to secure a \\"safe\\" posting for Owen was viewed with suspicion by his friends, including Osbert Sitwell and Siegfried Sassoon. During the 1920s, Scott Moncrieff maintained a rancorous rivalry with Sitwell, who depicted him unflatteringly as \\"Mr. X\\" in All at Sea.Osbert Sitwell, All at Sea: a social tragedy in three acts for first class passengers only, with a preface entitled A few Days in an Author's Life (Duckworth: London, 1927) Scott Moncrieff responded with the pamphlet \\"The Strange and Striking Adventure of Four Authors in Search of a Character, 1926.\\", a satire on the Sitwell family. Through his friendship with the young No√´l Coward, he made the acquaintance of Mrs Astley Cooper and became a frequent house guest at her home Hambleton Hall. He dedicated the first volume of his translation of Proust to Cooper.Philip Hoare, No√´l Coward: A Biography, (University of Chicago Press, 1998) After the war, Scott Moncrieff worked for a year as private secretary to the press Baron, Alfred Harmsworth, Lord Northcliffe, owner of The Times, thereafter transferring to the editorial staff in Printing House Square.Memories and Letters, p. 150. In 1923 his health compelled him to move to Italy,Memories and Letters, p. 152. where he divided his time between Florence and Pisa, and later, Rome. He subsequently supported himself with literary work, notably translations from medieval and modern French. Remembrance of Things Past Scott Moncrieff published the first volume of his Proust translation in 1922, and continued work on the enormous novel until his death in February 1930, at which time he was working on the final volume of the Remembrance. His choice of the title Remembrance of Things Past, by which Proust's novel was known in English for many years, is not a literal translation of the original French. It is, in fact, taken from the second line of Shakespeare's Sonnet 30: \\"When to the sessions of sweet silent thought / I summon up remembrance of things past\\". By the autumn of 1921 Scott Moncrieff had resigned his employment and determined to live from then on by translation alone. He had already successfully published his Song of Roland and Beowulf, and now undertook to translate Proust's huge masterpiece in its entirety. He persuaded Chatto & Windus Publishers to issue the complete Remembrance of Things Past (as he now christened the novel in English). On 9 September 1922 Sydney Schiff, an English admirer and friend of Proust, was alarmed by the following publisher's announcement in The Athenaeum: Schiff hastened to inform Proust that the titles in the English version were \\"hopelessly inaccurate\\". Proust, highly distressed, considered stopping publication. But Swann's Way came out in English as scheduled on 19 September 1922. \\"Despite his shaky acquaintance with English, Proust was relieved a little as he struggled through his own copy by the beauty he dimly perceived.\\" The English reviews too were extremely complimentary to the work itself and even more so to the translation. Thus on 10 October 1922, Proust wrote to Scott Moncrieff, thanked him for \\"the trouble you have taken,\\" and complimented him on his \\"fine talent.\\" But his tone was still grudging and prickly. \\"The verses you have inserted and the dedication to your friends are no substitute for the intentional ambiguity of my , which corresponds to the that appears at the end of my work.\\"Letter from Proust to Scott Moncrieff dated 10 October 1922 in National Library, Edinburgh And Swann's Way might‚Äîso Proust said‚Äîhave been better called To Swann's Way.George D. Painter: Marcel Proust, A Biography Scott Moncrieff, \\"equally ruffled\\", replied as follows: \\"My dear Sir, I beg that you will allow me to thank you for your very gratifying letter in English as my knowledge of French‚Äîas you have shown me, with regard to your titles‚Äîis too imperfect, too stunted a growth for me to weave from it the that I would fain offer you. Are you still suffering‚Äîwhich I am very sorry to hear, and wish that my real sympathy could bring you some relief‚ÄîI am making my reply to your critiques on another sheet, and by the aid of a machine which I hope you do not abominate: it is the machine on which Swann and one-third of the Jeunes Filles have been translated. Thus you can throw away this sheet unread, or keep it, or inflict it upon M. Gallimard.\\" As Proust died very shortly after, on 18 November 1922, this correspondence had no sequel. The further volumes of Scott Moncrieff's Remembrance were published in the years that followed in grand sequence: *II. Within a Budding Grove (1924) *III. The Guermantes Way (1925) *IV. Cities of the Plain (1928) *V. The Captive (1929) *VI. The Sweet Cheat Gone (1930) Scott Moncrieff died in 1930 only 40 years old, leaving the translation of the final volume of the Remembrance to other hands. Death and after The original French text of the Remembrance was re-edited in later years, in two successive editions, and these additions and revisions were subsequently incorporated in later English translations. Thus, Terence Kilmartin revised the Scott Moncrieff translation in 1981, and an additional revision was made by D.J. Enright in 1992. The work in the Enright edition is given the more literal title of In Search of Lost Time. Most recently, and under the same overall title, Yale University Press has begun to publish a new version of Scott Moncrieff's translation, edited and annotated by William C. Carter, with the first two volumes published in 2013 and 2015. Scott Moncrieff died of cancer at Calvary Hospital in Rome in 1930. He was buried in the Campo Verano. His remains lie in a small communal ossuary with those who died in the same month at the same convent. The exact place can be located by doing a search by name and date of death at the gate. The Society of Authors administers the annual award of a Scott Moncrieff Prize for French Translation. Chasing Lost Time: the Life of C K Scott Moncrieff, Soldier, Spy and Translator by his great-great-niece Jean Findlay was published in 2014.

Darker dots indicate more protein. A dot blot (or slot blot) is a technique in molecular biology used to detect proteins. It represents a simplification of the western blot method, with the exception that the proteins to be detected are not first separated by electrophoresis. Instead, the sample is applied directly on a membrane in a single spot, and the blotting procedure is performed. The technique offers significant savings in time, as chromatography or gel electrophoresis, and the complex blotting procedures for the gel are not required. However, it offers no information on the size of the target protein.  Uses  Performing a dot blot is similar in idea to performing a western blot, with the advantage of faster speed and lower cost. Dot blots are also performed to screen the binding capabilities of an antibody.  Methods  A general dot blot protocol involves spotting 1‚Äì2 microliters of a samples onto a nitrocellulose or PVDF membrane and letting it air dry. Samples can be in the form of tissue culture supernatants, blood serum, cell extracts, or other preparations. The membrane is incubated in blocking buffer to prevent non-specific binding. It is then incubated with a primary antibody followed by a detection antibody or a primary antibody conjugated to a detection molecule (commonly HRP or alkaline phosphatase). After antibody binding, the membrane is incubated with a chemiluminescent substrate and imaged.  Apparatus  Dot blot is conventionally performed on a piece of nitrocellulose membrane or PVDF membrane. After the protein samples are spotted onto the membrane, the membrane is placed in a plastic container and sequentially incubated in blocking buffer, antibody solutions, or rinsing buffer on shaker. Finally, for chemiluminescence imaging, the piece of membrane need to be wrapped in a transparent plastic film filled with enzyme substrate. Vacuum-assisted dot blot apparatus has been used to facilitate the rinsing and incubating process by using vacuum to extract the solution from underneath the membrane, which is assembled in between several layers of plates to ensure good seal between sample wells, hold waste solution, and deliver suction force. For chemiluminescence signal detection, apparatus need to be disassembled and the membrane need to be taken out and wrapped in a transparent plastic film.

Foster, is an Irish historian and academic. He was the Carroll Professor of Irish History from 1991 until 2016 at Hertford College, Oxford. Early life Foster was born on 16 January 1949 in Waterford, to two teachers: Betty Foster (n√©e Fitzroy), a primary teacher, and 'Fef' (Ernest) Foster, a teacher of Irish. His father, Fef, was a native of Drung, a tiny hamlet and parish located between Cavan Town and Cootehill in County Cavan. Roy attended Newtown School in Waterford, a multi-denominational school that was founded as a Quaker school in the late 18th century. He won a scholarship to attend St. Andrew's School in Delaware for a year before reading history at Trinity College Dublin. He was awarded an M.A. and PhD by Trinity College, where he was taught by T. W. Moody and F. S. L. Lyons, and was elected a scholar in History and Political Science in 1969. Academic career Prior to his appointment to the Carroll professorship, he was Professor of Modern British History at Birkbeck, University of London, University of London, and held visiting fellowships at St Antony's College, Oxford, the Institute for Advanced Study, Princeton, and Princeton University. Based in London as well as at Hertford College in Oxford, Foster visits Ireland frequently. His work is generally published under the name R. F. Foster. He has written early biographies of Charles Stewart Parnell and Lord Randolph Churchill, edited The Oxford History of Ireland (1989), and written Modern Ireland: 1600‚Äì1972 (1988) and several books of essays. Foster produced a much-acclaimed two-part biography of W. B. Yeats, which was awarded the James Tait Black Memorial Prize, and collaborated with Fintan Cullen on a National Portrait Gallery exhibition, 'Conquering England: the Irish in Victorian London'. Seamus Deane wrote a review in The Irish Times of 27 September 2003 quoting W. B. Yeats as saying \\"My glory was that I had such friends\\". Deane then suggests Yeats was also lucky to have such a biographer as Foster. In 2000 Foster was a Booker Prize judge.

The abbey church, dedicated to Saint George, completed in 1125, is the first major church building of the so-called \\"School of Hirsau\\" in Bavaria. It is a Romanesque basilica with a transept . The Romanesque wall-paintings are well-preserved. The first abbot, Erminold, is supposed to have been killed by the monks because of his strictness. The tomb built in his honour by Bishop Heinrich II of Regensburg in 1283 was the work of one of the most important Regensburg cathedral master-builders.

It was first built as the club house for the Teutonic Club serving the expatriate German community in Singapore, and later converted into a hotel. The hotel was the first in Singapore to have a swimming-pool on the premises, and an air- conditioned wine cellar. The Tower Block of the hotel has been gazetted as a national monument of Singapore. Architecture The Goodwood Park Hotel building was built in 1900 to the design of R. A. J. Bidwell, of Swan and Maclaren. Its architecture has an eclectic Victorian flavour, with its turrets and decorated fa√ßade. The Tower Block has elements of the Queen Anne Revival style, and the tower itself may have been influenced by those found on castles in Germany's Rhineland region. The building was constructed for the sum of St$20,000. History Tower Block of the Goodwood Park Hotel The Teutonia Club was an exclusive enclave first established on 28 June 1856 for the expatriate German community in Singapore. The club was housed in a couple of different locations until it purchased a piece of land on Scotts Road in 1861 to build a club house. Additional plot of land adjacent to the site was later purchased to enlarge the compound and construct a new building for the club. Construction of the new clubhouse began in 1899. On 21 September 1900, the new clubhouse opened as the Deutsches Haus (German House) with a ball attended by about 500 guests, including James Alexander Swettenham, then Acting Governor of the Straits Settlements. However, when the First World War broke out, the British government in Singapore classified all Germans as enemy forces. Most of the Germans in Singapore either fled or were shipped to Australia, and the Teutonia Club seized by the Custodian of Enemy Property. In 1918, the building was auctioned off by the Custodian of Enemy Property to three Jewish brothers ‚Äì Morris, Ezekiel and Ellis Manasseh, who also bought five other houses behind it. The entire estate was renamed Goodwood Hall, after the famous Goodwood Racecourse in England. A bar was added, as well as a restaurant and caf√©, and it was registered in 1922 as a restaurant-caf√©-entertainment establishment, It served as a venues for social gatherings and entertainment, hosting for example a performance by the ballerina Anna Pavlova. It also host sports amenities. In April 1929, the building was turned into a hotel named the Goodwood Park Hotel, with rooms added to the Tower Wing and the houses at the rear used as suites. During World War II the Goodwood Park Hotel used as a residence for high-ranking officers of the Japanese Imperial Army. After the war, the Singapore War Crimes Court conducted war crimes trials in a tent on the grounds of Goodwood Park. Ezekiel Manasseh died during the war as a prisoner of the Japanese, and the hotel was returned to Ezekiel's stepson, Vivian Bath, after the war in 1947. Bath spent about $2.5 million in revamping the hotel, adding for example the first swimming pool in a hotel in Singapore. The renovations were completed in 1963, and Bath sold the hotel to the Malayan Banking Group the same year. The new owner had intended to demolish the old building and build a new hotel, shopping mall, and high rise apartments, but the plan was shelved after it was met with criticisms. The Tower Wing was again extensively renovated in 1978, and its original roof replaced. The hotel was also extended to include more guest rooms, with 17 suites were added on the first floor, including the Brunei Suite. On 23 September 1989, the Tower Block of the Goodwood Park Hotel was gazetted as a national monument. In late 2005, the hotel lobby was renovated to give it a modern look. In June 2013, Goodwood Park Hotel launched a renovated Mayfair Wing and rooms, refurbished at an estimated cost of SGD$2million. The Mayfair Wing has 77 rooms and suites over three floors, and a Balinese-inspired Mayfair Pool. The interior was designed by Ernesto Bedmar of Bedmar & Shi who was also responsible for the hotel's past renovation and upgrading projects since the nineties. Facilities Goodwood Park Hotel has 233 rooms and suites which are divided into four wings ‚Äì Lobby, Mayfair, Tower and Parklane. The hotel has two outdoor swimming pools (Main and Mayfair).

Named after its capital and largest city, Palmyra, it encompassed the Roman provinces of Syria Palaestina, Arabia Petraea, and Egypt, as well as large parts of Asia Minor. The Palmyrene Empire was ruled by Queen Zenobia, officially as regent for her son Vaballathus, who inherited the throne in 267 at age ten. In 270, Zenobia rapidly conquered most of the Roman east, attempting to maintain relations with Rome as a legitimate power. In 271 she claimed the imperial title for both herself and her son, fighting a short war with the Roman emperor Aurelian, who conquered Palmyra and captured the self-proclaimed Empress. A year later the Palmyrenes rebelled, which led Aurelian to destroy Palmyra. Despite its brief existence, the Palmyrene Empire is remembered for having been ruled by one of the most ambitious and powerful women in late antiquity. It is also hailed in Syria, where it plays an important role as an icon in Syrian nationalism.  Background  Following the murder of Roman emperor Alexander Severus in 235, general after general squabbled over control of the empire, the frontiers were neglected and subjected to frequent raids by Carpians, Goths and Alemanni, in addition to outright attacks from the aggressive Sassanids in the east. Finally, Shapur I of Persia inflicted a disastrous defeat upon the Romans at the Battle of Edessa in 260, capturing the Roman emperor Valerian and soon, Quietus and Macrianus rebelled against Valerian's son Gallienus and usurped the imperial power in Syria. The Palmyrene leader Odaenathus was declared king, and remained nominally loyal to Gallienus, forming an army of Palmyrenes and Syrian peasants to attack Shapur. In 260, Odaenathus won a decisive victory over Shapur in a battle near the Euphrates. Next, Odaenathus defeated the usurpers in 261, and spent the remainder of his reign fighting the Persians. Odaenathus received the title Governor of the East, and ruled Syria as the imperial representative, and declared himself King of Kings. Odaenathus was assassinated along with his son Hairan in 267; according to Joannes Zonaras and the Augustan History, he was killed by his cousin, whose name is given by the latter source as Maeonius. The Augustan History also claims that Maeonius was proclaimed emperor for a very brief period, before being executed by the soldiers. No inscriptions or other evidence exist for Maeonius' reign, and he was probably killed immediately after assassinating Odaenathus. Odaenathus was succeeded by his minor son with Zenobia, the ten-year-old Vaballathus. Under the regency of Zenobia, Vaballathus was kept in the shadow while his mother assumed actual rule and consolidated her power. The queen was careful not to provoke Rome and took for herself and her son the titles that her husband had, while working on guaranteeing the safety of the borders with Persia, and pacifying the dangerous Tanukhid tribes in Hauran.  Establishment  Vaballathus (right) as king on the obverse of an 199x199px Zenobia started an expedition against the Tanukhids in the spring of 270, during the reign of emperor Claudius Gothicus aided by her generals, Septimius Zabbai (a general of the army) and Septimius Zabdas (the chief general of the army) Zabdas sacked Bosra, killed the Roman governor, and marched south securing Roman Arabia. According to the Persian geographer Ibn Khordadbeh, Zenobia herself attacked Dumat Al-Jandal but could not conquer its castle. However, Ibn Khordadbeh is confusing Zenobia with al-ZabbƒÅ, a semi-legendary Arab queen whose story is often confused with Zenobia's story. In October of 270, a Palmyrene army of 70,000 invaded Egypt, and declared Zenobia queen of Egypt. The Roman general Tenagino Probus was able to regain Alexandria in November, but was defeated and escaped to the fortress of Babylon, where he was besieged and killed by Zabdas, who continued his march south and secured Egypt. Afterward, in 271, Zabbai started the operations in Asia Minor, and was joined by Zabdas in the spring of that year. The Palmyrenes subdued Galatia, and occupied Ankara, marking the greatest extent of the Palmyrene expansion. However, the attempts to conquer Chalcedon were unsuccessful. The Palmyrene conquests were done under the protective show of subordination to Rome. Zenobia issued coinage in the name of Claudius' successor Aurelian with Vaballathus depicted as king, while the emperor allowed the Palmyrene coinage and conferred the Palmyrene royal titles. However, toward the end of 271, Vaballathus took the title of Augustus (emperor) along with his mother. Reconquest by Rome Vaballathus as Augustus, on the obverse of an Antoninianus. Zenobia as Augusta, on the obverse of an Antoninianus. Aurelian-Zenobia war. In 272, Aurelian crossed the Bosphorus and advanced quickly through Anatolia. According to one account, Marcus Aurelius Probus regained Egypt from Palmyra, while the emperor continued his march and reached Tyana. The fall of Tyana lent itself to a legend; Aurelian to that point had destroyed every city that resisted him, but he spared Tyana after having a vision of the great philosopher Apollonius of Tyana, whom he respected greatly, in a dream. Apollonius implored him, stating: \\"Aurelian, if you desire to rule, abstain from the blood of the innocent! Aurelian, if you will conquer, be merciful!\\". Whatever the reason for his clemency, Aurelian's sparing of Tyana paid off; many more cities submitted to him upon seeing that the emperor would not exact revenge upon them. Entering Issus and heading to Antioch, Aurelian defeated Zenobia in the Battle of Immae. Zenobia retreated to Antioch then fled to Emesa while Aurelian advanced and took the former. After regrouping, the Romans first destroyed a Palmyrene garrison stationed at the fort of Daphne, and headed south to Apamea, then continued to Emesa and defeated Zenobia again at the Battle of Emesa, forcing her to evacuate to the capital. Aurelian marched through the desert and was harassed by Bedouins loyal to Palmyra, but as soon as he arrived at the city gates, he negotiated with the Bedouins, who betrayed Palmyra and supplied the Roman army with water and food. Aurelian besieged Palmyra in the summer of 272, and tried to negotiate with Zenobia, on the condition that she surrender herself in person to him, to which she answered with refusal. The Romans tried to breach the city defenses several times but were repelled, however, as the situation deteriorated, Zenobia left the city and headed east to ask the Persians for help. The Romans followed the empress, captured her near the Euphrates and brought her back to the emperor. Soon after, the Palmyrene citizens asked for peace, and the city capitulated. Aftermath Sol, defeats the Palmyrene Empire, and celebrates ORIENS AVG, the Augustus Rising Sun. Aurelian spared the city and stationed a garrison of 600 archers led by a certain Sandarion, as a peacekeeping force. The defenses were destroyed and most of the military equipment was confiscated. Zenobia and her council were taken to Emesa and put on trial. Most of the high-ranking Palmyrene officials were executed, while Zenobia's and Vaballathus's fates are uncertain. In 273, Palmyra rebelled under the leadership of a citizen named Septimius Apsaios, and contacted the Roman prefect of Mesopotamia, Marcellinus, offering to help him usurp the imperial power. Marcellinus delayed the negotiations and sent word to the Roman emperor, while the rebels lost their patience and declared a relative of Zenobia named Antiochus as Augustus. Aurelian marched against Palmyra and was helped by a Palmyrene faction from inside the city, headed by a man with a senatorial rank named Septimius Haddudan. Aurelian spared Antiochus, but razed Palmyra. The most valuable monuments were taken by the emperor to decorate his Temple of Sol, while buildings were smashed, people were clubbed and cudgeled and Palmyra's holiest temple pillaged. Evaluation and legacy The ultimate motive behind the revolt is debated; when dealing with the rise of Palmyra and the rebellion of Zenobia, historians most often interpreted the ascendancy as an indication of cultural, ethnic or social factors. Andreas Alf√∂ldi viewed the rebellion as a completely native ethnic opposition against Rome. Irfan Shah√Æd considered Zenobia's revolt a pan-Arab movement that was a forerunner of the Arab expansion of the Caliphates; an opinion shared by Franz Altheim, and an almost universal view amongst Arab and Syrian scholars such as Philip Khuri Hitti. Mark Whittow disagreed that the revolt was ethnic in its nature and emphasized that it was a reaction to the weakness of Rome and its inability to protect Palmyra from the Persians. Warwick Ball viewed the rebellion as aimed at Rome's throne, not just Palmyrene independence. Vaballathus' inscriptions indicated the style of a Roman emperor; according to Ball, Zenobia and Vaballathus were contenders for the Roman imperial throne, following a plan similar to that of Vespasian, who ascended the throne after building his power-base in Syria. Andrew M. Smith II considered the revolt as a bid for both independence and the Roman throne. The Palmyrene royalty used Eastern titles such as king of kings, which had no relevance in Roman politics, while the conquests were in the interest of Palmyrene commerce. Finally, it was only in the last regnal year of Zenobia and Vaballathus that the Roman imperial rank was claimed. Fergus Millar, although tending toward the view that it wasn't only an independence movement, believes there is not yet enough evidence to draw a conclusion on the nature of Palmyra's revolt. During the mid-twentieth century, interest in the Palmyrene Empire was briefly revived by the advent of Syrian nationalism. Modern Syrian nationalists viewed the empire as a uniquely Syrian civilization which attempted to liberate the masses of the Levant from Roman tyranny. A Syrian TV show was produced based on Zenobia's life, and she was the subject of a biography written by Syria's former minister of defense Mustafa Tlass.

The Blake family owned the house until 1825 when it was acquired by the Williams family. In 1891, the City of Boston acquired the house. In order to save the house from demolition in 1896, the Dorchester Historical Society acquired the property from the City and moved the house less than 500 feet from its original location by Massachusetts Avenue to its current location. In 1978, the interior and exterior of the house were designated as a Boston Landmark by the Boston Landmarks Commission. The immediate area, as well as the house, have been undergoing an extensive renovation and preservation. The house was completely re-shingled and the grounds improved.

It supports contemporary Australian artists and encourages a wider appreciation of their work by buying artworks which it then rents to public and private sector clients. History Artbank was modelled on Canada's Art Bank, after then federal minister for the arts, Bob Ellicott, saw the Ottawa collection in 1979 and convinced Prime Minister Malcolm Fraser of the value of the idea. Fraser was enthusiastic, but treasurer John Howard took a little more convincing, before allotting in seed funding. The collection was founded in 1980 with an endowment of 600 artworks from the National Gallery of Australia. By 1992 Artbank had become so profitable that its government funding was cut off and it operated on self-generated income. It was nearly shut down in 1997, under the Howard government, but it was saved after much lobbying. At the end of the 2000 Australian financial year, its operating profit was recorded as and its total assets million. Function and governance Artbank is part of the Department of Infrastructure, Transport, Regional Development and Communications (until January 2020, Department of Communications and the Arts, and various departments preceding that one). The Director of Artbank () is Tony Stephens. The two core objectives of Artbank are \\"to provide direct support to Australian contemporary artists through the acquisition of their work and to promote the value of Australian contemporary art to the broader public\\". It is funded by leasing out artworks from its collection. It also supports the Government's cultural diplomacy aims, and, for the broader community, it makes Australian contemporary art accessible in a way that galleries and other institutions cannot do, by placing artworks in workplaces and a variety of public and private places around Australia and the world. Description , it has over 11,000 works by more than 3,500 Australian culturally diverse artists, including paintings, sculpture, video art, photographs, and ceramics. Prominent artists represented in the collection are Jeffrey Smart, Julie Dowling, John Olsen, Bill Henson, Gwyn Hanssen-Pigott, Robert Klippel, Emily Kame Kngwarreye, Bronwyn Oliver, William Robinson, Kitty Kantilla, Rover Thomas, Patricia Piccinini, Tracey Moffatt and Del Kathryn Barton. Because the artworks are chosen on cultural value and not in order to turn a profit, the institution is able to acquire some riskier pieces. it has the fastest growing collection of digital and multimedia art in Australia. Artbank has collection stores in Sydney, Melbourne (opened 1996 in Armadale; moved to a converted warehouse in Collingwood in 2018) and Perth, Australia. The Collingwood location also offers a studio program to artists and designers, open to applications by residents. Leasing Artbank lends its artworks to corporations, government agencies, and private individuals. Restaurateur Kylie Kwong leased a number of artworks for her restaurant at Carriageworks arts centre in Sydney in 2018. Businesses are able to claim a 100% tax deduction for leasing from the institution. Works are sold from time to time, as part of stocktaking process. The cost of leasing an artwork ranges from to per year, with lease periods lasting from six months to a year, with the ability to extend indefinitely.

Largely forgotten today, Rabl left only a small number of works, all of them early ones, from the twilight of the Romantic era. At the age of 30 he stopped composing entirely and devoted himself to conducting and vocal coaching the rest of his life. Rabl is a member of the prominent Rabl family. Life Walter Rabl was born in Vienna and as a child became an excellent pianist. He attended the Institut Le Rosey, a boarding school in Rolle, Switzerland. He went to Salzburg and there studied music theory and composition with J. F. Hummel, director of the Mozarteum. He graduated with honours from the Kaiserlich und K√∂niglich Staatsgymnasium (Royal and Imperial State School) in Salzburg in 1892. Rabl returned to Vienna to study with Karl Navratil (1836-1914) and then enrolled in the doctoral program at the German University in Prague as a student of the musicologist Guido Adler. At 25, he completed his doctorate and soon after accepted a position at the Royal Opera of Dresden as coach and chorus master. Beginning in 1903 Rabl conducted throughout Germany and championed works by progressive composers such as Gustav Mahler, Karl Goldmark, Franz Schreker, Erich Korngold, and Richard Strauss. In 1905, Rabl married the soprano Hermine von Kriesten and conducted her in major Wagnerian roles such as Br√ºnnhilde and Elektra. After his retirement from conducting in 1924, he continued to use his impressive piano skills in accompanying and coaching many notable singers. Rabl is a relative of Carl and Rudolf Rabl. Chamber music Rabl‚Äôs Quartet in E-Flat Major for Clarinet, Violin, Cello, and Piano, Op. 1 won first prize in 1896 in a prestigious competition for young composers sponsored by the Vienna Tonk√ºnstlerverein (Musicians‚Äô Society) of which Johannes Brahms was honorary president and a judge of the competition. Brahms recommended the piece to his own publisher, Simrock, who released it the following year along with three other Rabl works: the Fantasy Pieces for Piano Trio, Op. 2, and two sets of Four Songs, Op. 3 and Op. 4. The Op. 1 quartet appears to be the first work ever written for that combination, which was later more famously used by Messiaen in his Quatuor pour la fin du temps (\\"Quartet for the end of time\\"), composed in 1941. The parts to the Op.1 Quartet were reprinted by Edition Silvertrust in 2007. In 1899, Simrock published four additional pieces by Rabl: Four Songs, Op. 5; the Violin Sonata, Op. 6; Three Songs, Op. 7; and the Symphony, Op. 8. His next series of compositions, Opp. 9‚Äì15, consisted entirely of songs. They were published in Leipzig by the house founded by Daniel Rahter (D. Rahter).the later songs were generally published after the premiere of the opera, generally around 1905; see e.g. a 1905 notice of publication of the Op.13 set of songs. Opera Most of Rabl's work was in the tradition of Brahms and Robert Schumann. But his opera, Liane (1903) based on a romantic fairy tale took a different turn, a turn in the direction of Richard Wagner. Although the reception of the opera was highly favorable, Liane was Rabl‚Äôs last work.Strauss, pp.viii-ix.

It was the first jet engine to be financially supported by the RLM, bearing the official name 109-001. Had development continued it would have been known as the Heinkel 001, but it does not appear this was used in practice. The HeS 8 was intended to power the Heinkel He 280 twin-engine fighter, although both Heinkel and von Ohain preferred the axial HeS 30. A lengthy gestation period meant it was finally becoming ready for production at about the same time as the Junkers Jumo 004 and BMW 003. In 1942 work was ended on the HeS 8 and HeS 30, and Heinkel was ordered to move on to the larger Heinkel HeS 011 instead. The He 280 was left engineless, and was eventually abandoned. Design and development By the time the HeS 3 program wound down in 1939, it appears that von Ohain no longer favoured the centrifugal compressor for jet engines. He had been \\"sold\\" on the axial compressor as early as 1938, after a meeting with D. Encke of AVA, but continued with the centrifugal design in the HeS 3 because it was much easier to work with. It is likely he would have developed an axial design as a follow-on to the HeS 3, but it appears the RLM was interested in keeping him working on centrifugal designs as a backup in case the various axial designs ran into problems. The main problem with the centrifugal compressor was the large cross-sectional area. von Ohain had been looking at solutions to this problem as soon as the HeS 1 design was winding down in 1937. His first attempt at the HeS 3 was to separate the compressor and turbine --which were back-to-back in the HeS 1-- and place the combustion chambers between them. Various problems in this original HeS 3 design forced them to abandon this layout for an updated HeS 3b, but it appears von Ohain felt it was still the best solution, and he returned to it for the HeS 8. The result was an engine that was only slightly wider than the compressor disk, whereas earlier models had piping lying outside the compressor disk and were therefore somewhat larger. Another problem with the original engine series was that the compressor was fairly sensitive to disturbances in the intake airflow. To address this, the HeS 8 added a low-pressure impeller in the intake in front of the main compressor. The impeller did not add much to the compression, but by increasing pressure on the compressor face the airflow was greatly stabilized. The 14-blade impeller and 19-blade compressor were both made of milled aluminum. The 14-blade turbine was made of steel, and uncooled, which suggests turbine burnout would be common. The various components were connected together on a common tubular power shaft, supported by three ball races. The combustion chamber consisted of two diffusers that slowed the airflow from the compressor, and then injected fuel through 128 nozzles arranged in two sets at different \\"depths\\". Various accessories, including the starter, were grouped around the intake and did not add to the overall diameter. Work progressed slowly, and by the time the first He 280 prototype was ready in September 1940 the engine was nowhere near ready for flight. The prototype then started glider testing while work on the engines and additional airframes continued. The engines were finally considered ready to go in early 1941, although at only 500 kg thrust instead of the planned 700 kg. The engines were later fitted and the He 280 first took to the air on 2 April 1941, although the cowlings had to be left off as the engine proved to leak fuel. Three days later the aircraft was demonstrated for a party of RLM officials, who were impressed, and full backing for Heinkel's program was forthcoming. Cancellation Development of the engine stalled at this point, and by early 1942 the thrust had crept up to only 550 kg. An attempt to improve the design by adding a single axial compressor stage behind the centrifugal compressor was used from V15 (the 15th prototype) on, and new airflow routing in the compressor started on V16. It appears about 30 engines were completed in total, the later models with the various improvements generating about 600 kg of thrust. But by this point the various all-axial designs, including Heinkel's own HeS 30, were progressing nicely. Helmut Schelp, in charge of jet development at the RLM, decided that the BMW 003 and Junkers Jumo 004 were \\"good enough\\", and cancelled all work on Heinkel's existing designs. Instead he asked them to move onto a \\"Class II\\" engine design of about 1,300 kg thrust, which would evolve as the Heinkel HeS 011. Variants Several modifications of the basic HeS 8 design were also explored over the project's lifetime. The HeS 9 appears to be a modification adding a second axial compressor stage, and replacing the full centrifugal stage with a new \\"diagonal compressor\\" that Schelp favoured. Little is known about this design other than the fact that RLM ordered ten of them, but none was built. It appears it was this layout that was used to develop the 011. Another modification, the HeS 10, placed a complete HeS 8 engine inside a larger nacelle, and expanded the intake impellor to be larger than the engine. The HeS 10 appears to have been the first example of what would today be called a turbofan engine. In order to extract more power from the exhaust to drive the fan, an additional single axial-stage turbine was added behind the HeS 8's existing centrifugal one. The only real difference between the HeS 10 and a modern turbofan engine was that the fan was not powered independently of the core, although, given the separate axial turbine stage, this would not have been difficult to arrange.

As part of a series of similar-styled games released by the company, Who Shot Johnny Rock? introduces a different setting than most of the others, while maintaining almost identical gameplay. The game was re-released by Digital Leisure around 2003 with updated video and sound, in addition to several bonus options. Plot The game is set a Hollywood version of 1930s Chicago, where one plays a private detective that has been hired to find out who murdered a nightclub singer named Johnny Rock. The player must attempt to reach Johnny Rock's killer, shooting villains and interrogating individuals. The game takes the player through the gangs of four gangsters with suggestive names - Measles, Mumps, Smallpox, and Lockjaw Lil, who all knew Rock - and locations such as a warehouse, a pool hall, a garage and a casino. Gameplay As is the case with other American Laser Games releases, the format is from a first-person perspective of the player watching the full motion video, listening to the various characters and shooting the right enemies at the right time with a powerful Tommy gun. Most other games produced by the company - with minor exceptions such as The Last Bounty Hunter, where the player can use a shotgun for a limited amount of time - feature no more than a simple pistol, which must be used to eliminate successive foes. Also, the player narrates the story. Unlike previous games, such as Mad Dog McCree and Crime Patrol, the player's Tommy gun does not need to be reloaded, but one does need to buy extra ammunition. Also, when health is lost, the player needs to have enough money to be able to pay the city doctor to give him or her an extra life. If money runs out, the game is over. The player must also try to avoid hitting innocent bystanders, as doing so results in having to pay funeral expenses. The doctor also gives advice (usually fake) and criticizes the player's actions. Along the way, clues have to be collected and it is them that will eventually allow the player to determine Johnny Rock's murderer; one of the final sequences takes place in Rock's mansion, where a final clue will point to the killer, who must be eliminated to end the game. As in most rail shooters by American Laser Games, the DOS and 3DO versions include mouse and light gun support. The Sega CD version supports the Konami Justifier light gun. Development Who Shot Johnny Rock? was showcased at the 1991 Las Vegas Amusement Expo, at the time under the title \\"Who Killed Johnny Rock?\\". Reception Electronic Gaming Monthly gave the 3DO version a 4.8 out of 10. They commented that the game's whodunnit concept is appealing, but that the graphics are poor by 3DO standards, the gameplay is frustrating, and the cursor moves too slow when using the control pad, making it impossible to progress in the game without a Gamegun, which was sold separately. Computer Gaming World said in June 1994 of the PC version that \\"The storyline and acting are decent for this sort of game, but the gameplay is simplistic to the extreme\\". The game appeared on the 1992/1993 series of GamesMaster, with Tony Slattery playing. During the segment, Slattery stated that he hated video games, and later failed the challenge by shooting an innocent victim.

It is located on the east side of the mouth of the St. Marks River, on Apalachee Bay. Historic background In the 1820s, the town of St. Marks, Florida was considered an important port of entry. The town served as a port for the prosperous planting region of Middle Florida and some counties of South Georgia. Growers hauled their agricultural products down to the port town in wagons by way of an early road which connected the then territorial capital of Tallahassee to the town of St. Marks. Later, this road would be widened and improved upon by the Tallahassee Railroad Company and would become the state's first railroad. Once the agricultural products reached the new port town, they were loaded aboard boats for shipment to New Orleans and/or St. Augustine. There were, however, problems in navigating both the Apalachee Bay and the St. Marks River. In many places both bay and river were shallow, and it was not too uncommon for boats to run aground and/or get mired in the muddy shallows. Lighthouse commission In 1828, Florida's territorial Governor William Pope Duval wrote a letter to Joseph M. White, a territorial delegate in which he stressed a great need for a lighthouse at the St. Marks location. White, in turn, wrote a letter to New Hampshire Senator Levi Woodbury, who chaired the Senate Committee on Commerce, reiterating the importance of establishing a light at St. Marks. Eleven days later, the committee issued a report which recognized the town of St. Marks as an official port of entry and recommended the building of a lighthouse in the area. On May 23, 1828, the U.S. House of Representatives passed an act which authorized the construction of a lighthouse at St. Marks and appropriated $6,000 for its construction. Construction After a survey was completed of the St. Marks area by Robert Mitchell, the Collector of Customs at Pensacola, and a site chosen for the lighthouse, it was discovered that the initial construction sum of $6,000 would be insufficient. The appropriation was increased to $14,000, and by mid-1829 a contract was signed with Winslow Lewis of Boston for the construction of a tower in the St. Marks area for $11,765. The finished product was not accepted by the Collector of Customs for St. Marks, Mr. Jesse H. Williams, because it had been constructed with hollow walls. Williams felt that the tower should be constructed with solid walls and, therefore, refused to accept the work. Calvin Knowlton was brought in to rebuild the tower. He oversaw its completion, and in 1831, Williams, satisfied that the light was built according to the contract, accepted the work. That same year saw the tower's whale-oil lamps lit for the first time by Samuel Crosby, who had been appointed the first Keeper of the St. Marks Lighthouse the previous year. Threats to the lighthouse=Second Seminole Indian War Samuel Crosby was still Keeper of the St. Marks Lighthouse in 1835, when the Second Seminole War broke out, and soon learned of the Indian attacks on both the Cape Florida and Mosquito Inlet lighthouses. Fearing for the safety of his family, Crosby wrote authorities and requested that a small detachment of troops be quartered near his lighthouse in order to protect both it and his family against hostile attack. His request was refused. Crosby, still not satisfied with his situation, again wrote authorities and this time requested that a small boat be provided, which he could use to evacuate his family in the event of an emergency. This request was also refused. Fortunately, the Seminole Indians chose not to attack the St. Marks Lighthouse and Crosby continued in his duties as head keeper for another four years. Natural disasters 1840 St. Marks Lighthouse U.S. Coast Guard Archive In 1842, erosion threatened the lighthouse and Winslow Lewis was again called in. He was given a contract to move the tower to a safer location. Lewis's contractors dismantled and removed the lantern and illuminating apparatus, then tore down the original 1829‚Äì1831 brick tower. Another site was selected farther inland, away from the water, and a new tower was constructed, then the original lantern and illuminating apparatus were reinstalled. The new tower survived the destructive hurricanes of the 1840s and 1850s, including the disastrous hurricane of September 1843, which destroyed most of the town of Port Leon and caused major damage to the town of St. Marks. Civil War By the 1860s, however, a new threat to the lighthouse arose: The Civil War. In 1865, Confederate troops were stationed near the lighthouse to defend the area against a Union attack. The tower's lighting apparatus had been removed earlier in order to prevent the lighthouse from aiding ships of the Union blockade, which were patrolling the Apalachee Bay. In March of that year, a Federal fleet of 16 ships appeared off the coast and began to shell the vicinity of the lighthouse in preparation for landing a force. The Confederates attempted to blow up the lighthouse during their retreat in order to deny it as a lookout for the Union forces. Though they were unsuccessful in destroying the tower, nevertheless, the damaged inflicted was substantial, necessitating a complete rebuild of the tower immediately following the war. During this subsequent rebuild, the tower was heightened to its present focal plane of above sea level, and the original lighting apparatus was restored. Improvements made The Lighthouse was automated in 1960 and remains today an active aid to navigation for vessels on the Apalachee Bay. The Coast Guard spent $150,000 in 2000 to stabilize the lighthouse. In July 2005, Hurricane Dennis broke a window of the lantern, flooding the inside of the tower. The lighthouse is within the St. Marks National Wildlife Refuge. References *The text of this article is taken primarily from http://www.fws.gov/saintmarks/lighthouse.html.

Etymology  Paraiyar as a word referring to a occupational group first appears in the second century CE writings of Mangudi Kilar. Robert Caldwell, a nineteenth-century missionary and grammarian who worked in South India, was in agreement with some Indian writers of the same period who considered the name to derive from the Tamil word parai (drum). According to this hypothesis, the Paraiyars were originally a community of drummers who performed at auspicious events like weddings and funerals. As their population increased, they were forced to take up occupations that were considered unclean, such as burial of corpses and scavenging and because of this they came to be considered an untouchable caste. M. Srinivasa Aiyangar, writing a little later, found this etymology unsatisfactory, arguing that beating of drums could not have been an occupation of so many people. Some other writers, such as Gustav Solomon Oppert, have derived the name from the Tamil word poraian, the name of a regional subdivision mentioned by ancient Tamil grammarians, or the Sanskrit pahariya, meaing \\"hill man\\". More recently, George L. Hart's textual analysis of the Sangam literature ( 300 BCE‚Äì300 CE) has led him to favour Caldwell's earlier hypothesis. The literature has references to the Tamil caste system and refers to a number of \\"low-born\\" groups variously called Pulaiyar and Kinaiyar. Hart believes that one of the drums called ki·πáai in the literature later came to be called pa·πüai and the people that played the drum were paraiyar (plural of paraiyan).  History = Pre-British period  Hart says that the pulaiyar performed a ritual function by composing and singing songs in the king's favour and beating drums, as well as travelling around villages to announce royal decrees. They were divided into subgroups based on the instruments they played and one of these groups the Kinaiyan \\"was probably the same as the modern Paraiyan\\". He says that these people were believed to be associated with magical power and kept at a distance, made to live in separate hamlets outside villages. However, their magical power was believed to sustain the king, who had the ability to transform it into auspicious power. Moffatt is less sure of this, saying that we do not know whether the distancing was a consequence of the belief in their magical powers or in Hinduism's ritual pollution as we know of it nowadays. * Inscriptions, especially those from the Thanjavur district, mention paraicceris, which were separate hamlets of the Paraiyars. Also living in separate hamlets were the artisans such as goldsmiths and cobblers, who were also accorded low status in the Sangam literature. * In a few inscriptions (all of them from outside Thanjavur district), Paraiyars are described as temple patrons. * There are also references to \\"Paraiya chieftainships\\" in the 8th and 10th centuries, but it is not known what these were and how they were integrated into the Chola political system. Burton Stein describes an essentially continuous process of expansion of the nuclear areas of the caste society into forest and upland areas of tribal and warrior people, and their integration into the caste society at the lowest levels. Many of the forest groups were incorporated as Paraiyar either by association with the parai drum or by integration into the low-status labouring groups who were generically called Paraiyar. Thus, it is thought that Paraiyar came to have many subcastes. During the Bhakti movement ( 7th‚Äì9th centuries CE), the saints ‚Äì Shaivite Nayanars and the Vaishnavite Alvars ‚Äì contained one saint each from the untouchable communities. The Nayanar saint Nandanar was born, according to Periya Puranam, in a \\"threshold of the huts covered with strips of leather\\", with mango trees from whose branches were hung drums. \\"In this abode of the people of the lowest caste (kadainar), there arose a man with a feeling of true devotion to the feet of Siva.\\" Nandanar was described as a temple servant and leather worker, who supplied straps for drums and gut- string for stringed instruments used in the Chidambaram temple, but he was himself not allowed to enter the temple. The Paraiyar regard Nandanar as one of their own caste. Paraiyars wear the sacred thread under rituals such as marriage and funeral. Scholars such as Burchett and Moffatt state that the Bhakti devotationalism did not undermine Brahmin ritual dominance. Instead, it might have strengthened it by warding off challenges from Jainism and Buddhism.  British colonial era  By the early 19th century, the Paraiyars had a degraded status in the Tamil society. Francis Buchanan's report on socio-economic condition of South Indians described them (\\"Pariar\\") as inferior caste slaves, who cultivated the lands held by Brahmins. This report largely shaped the perceptions of the British officials about contemporary society. They regarded Pariyars as an outcaste, untouchable community. In the second half of the 19th century, there were frequent descriptions of the Paraiyars in official documents and reformist tracts as being \\"disinherited sons of the earth\\". The first reference to the idea may be that written by Francis Whyte Ellis in 1818, where he writes that the Paraiyars \\"affect to consider themselves as the real proprietors of the soil\\". In 1894, William Goudie, a Weslyan missionary, said that the Paraiyars were self-evidently the \\"disinherited children of the soil\\". English officials such as Ellis believed that the Paraiyars were serfs toiling under a system of bonded labour that resembled the European villeinage. However, scholars such as Burton Stein argue that the agricultural bondage in Tamil society was different from the contemporary British ideas of slavery. Historians such as David Washbrook have argued that the socio-economic status of the Paraiyars rose greatly in the 18th century during the Company rule in India; Washbrook calls it the \\"Golden Age of the Pariah\\". Raj Sekhar Basu disagrees with this narrative, although he agrees that there were \\"certain important economic developments\\". The Church Mission Society converted many Paraiyars to Christianity by the early 19th century. During the British Raj, the missionary schools and colleges admitted Paraiyar students amid opposition from the upper-caste students. In 1893, the colonial government sanctioned an additional stipend for the Paraiyar students. The colonial officials, scholars, and missionaries attempted to rewrite the history of the Paraiyars, characterising them as a community that enjoyed a high status in the past. Edgar Thurston (1855-1935), for example, claimed that their status was nearly equal to that of the Brahmins in the past. H. A. Stuart, in his Census Report of 1891, claimed that Valluvans were a priestly class among the Paraiyars, and served as priests during Pallava reign. Robert Caldwell, J. H. A. Tremenheere and Edward Jewitt Robinson claimed that the ancient poet-philosopher Thiruvalluvar was a Paraiyar.  Buddhist advocacy by Iyothee Thass  Iyothee Thass, a Siddha doctor by occupation, belonged to a Paraiyar elite. In 1892, he demanded access for Paraiyars to Hindu temples, but faced resistance from upper-caste Brahmins and Vellalars. This experience led him to believe that it was impossible to emancipate the community within the Hindu fold. In 1893, he also rejected Christianity and Islam as the alternatives to Hinduism, because caste differences had persisted among Indian Christians, while the backwardness of contemporary local Muslims made Islam unappealing. Thass subsequently attempted a Buddhist reconstruction of the Tamil religious history. He argued that the Paraiyars were originally followers of Buddhism and constituted the original population of India. According to him, the Brahmanical invaders from Persia defeated them and destroyed Buddhism in southern India; as a result, the Paraiyars lost their culture, religion, wealth and status in the society and become destitute. In 1898, Thass and many of his followers converted to Buddhism and founded the Sakya Buddha Society (cƒÅkkaiya putta ca·πÖkam) with the influential mediation of Henry Steel Olcott of the Theosophical Society. Olcott subsequently and greatly supported the Tamil Paraiyar Buddhists.  Controversy over the community's name  Jean- Antoine Dubois, a French missionary who worked in India between 1792-1823 and had a Brahmin-centric outlook, recorded the community's name as Pariah. He described them as people who lived outside the system of morals prescribed by Hinduism, accepted that outcaste position and were characterised by \\"drunkenness, shamelessness, brutality, truthlessness, uncleanliness, disgusting food practices, and an absolute lack of personal honour\\". Moffat says this led to pariah entering the English language as \\"a synonym for the socially ostracised and the morally depraved\\". Iyothee Thass felt that Paraiyar was a slur, and campaigned against its usage. During the 1881 census of India, he requested the government to record the community members under the name Aboriginal Tamils. He later suggested Dravidian as an alternative term, and formed the Dhraavidar Mahajana Sabhai (Dravidian Mahajana Assembly) in 1891. Another Paraiyar leader, Rettamalai Srinivasan, however, advocated using the term Paraiyar with pride. In 1892, he formed the Parayar Mahajana Sabha (Paraiyar Mahajana Assembly), and also started a news publication titled Paraiyan. Thass continued his campaign against the term, and petitioned the government to discontinue its usage, demanding punishment for those who used the term. He incorrectly claimed that the term Paraiyar was not found in any ancient records (it has been, in fact, found in the 10th-century Chola stone inscriptions from Kolar district). Thass subsequently advocated the term Adi Dravida (Original Dravidians) to describe the community. In 1892, he used the term Adidravida Jana Sabhai to describe an organisation, which was probably Srinivasan's Parayar Mahajana Sabha. In 1895, he established the People‚Äôs Assembly of Urdravidians (Adidravida Jana Sabha), which probably split off from Srinivasan's organisation. According to Michael Bergunder, Thass was thus the first person to introduce the concept of Adi Dravida into political discussion. Another Paraiyar leader, M. C. Rajah ‚Äî a Madras councillor ‚Äî made successful efforts for adoption of the term Adi-Dravidar in the government records. In 1914, the Madras Legislative Council passed a resolution that officially censured the usage of the term Paraiyar to refer to a specific community, and recommended Adi Dravidar as an alternative. In the 1920s and 1930s, Periyar E. V. Ramasamy ensured the wider dissemination of the term Adi Dravida.  Right-hand caste faction  Paraiyars belong to the Valangai (\\"Right-hand caste faction\\"). Some of them assume the title Valangamattan (\\"people of the right-hand division\\"). The Valangai comprised castes with an agricultural basis while the Idangai consisted of castes involved in manufacturing. Valangai, which was better organised politically.

It often develops in three stages: skin abrasion, folliculitis (which looks like a small, reddish acne), and finally abscess. Because it most commonly starts with skin abrasion, it is desirable to reduce the factors which lead to skin abrasion. Some of these factors include: * Reducing the friction. In equestrian activities, friction is reduced with a proper riding position and using properly fitting clothing and equipment. In cycling, friction from bobbing or swinging motion while pedaling is reduced by setting the appropriate saddle height. Angle and fore/aft position can also play a role, and different cyclists have different needs and preferences in relation to this. * Selecting an appropriate size and design of horse riding saddle or bicycle saddle. * Wearing proper clothing. In bicycling, this includes cycling shorts, with chamois padding. For equestrian activity, long, closely fitted pants such as equestrian breeches or jodhpurs minimize chafing. For western riding, closely fitted jeans with no heavy inner seam, sometimes combined with chaps, are preferred. Padded cycling shorts worn under riding pants helps some equestrians, and extra padding, particularly sheepskin, on the seat of the saddle may help in more difficult situations such as long-distance endurance riding. * Using petroleum jelly, chamois cream or lubricating gel to further reduce friction. If left untreated over an extended period of time, saddle sores may need to be drained by a physician. In animals such as horses and other working animals, saddle sores often form on either side of the withers, which is the area where the front of a saddle rests, and also in the girth area behind the animal's elbow, where they are known as a girth gall. Saddle sores can occur over the loin, and occasionally in other locations. These sores are usually caused by ill-fitting gear, dirty gear, lack of proper padding, or unbalanced loads.Hayes, Capt. M. Horace, Veterinary Notes for Horse Owners, Stanley Paul, London, 1977 Reducing friction is also of great help in preventing equine saddle sores. Where there is swelling but not yet open sores, the incidence of sore backs may be reduced by loosening the girth without immediately removing the saddle after a long ride, thus allowing normal circulation to return slowly.

The game was re-released for several platforms by Digital Leisure around 2003, with updated sound and video, among other American Laser Games titles. Plot The player assumes the role of a star ranger (as in all American Laser Games releases except Who Shot Johnny Rock?, the player character's name is not given, and he is referred to throughout the game as \\"Star Ranger\\") who picks up and responds to a transmission by Ursula Skye, the commander of a starship called Colonial Star One. The SOS call lets the star ranger know that the ship has been invaded by an evil group called the Black Brigade, led by Captain Talon. As the entire colony on board the ship is in danger, the player answers the distress call. Following a short target practice tutorial, consisting of shooting at fast- moving asteroids, the player heads out to the Black Dragon to defeat the space pirates. After the star ranger succeeds in freeing the captives aboard, including Commander Skye, the next task is to find and assemble the Star- Splitter Cannon, which, aside from its main component, requires three crystals to work: the Aqua Blue, the Crimson Red and the Emerald Green. Each of the components can be found on a separate planet, bringing the total of planets the player can visit in any order up to four. However, the crystals must be placed in the weapon in a specific order, which is given to the star ranger by Commander Skye. On the four planets, the star ranger encounters heavy opposition, but once the elements are collected, the final task is to destroy the Black Dragon with the Star-Splitter Cannon, then eliminating its captain. Gameplay Space Pirates is similar to all other full motion video releases by American Laser Games in that the player rarely makes decisions other than selecting a planet and shooting villains. The action is propelled automatically, and only stops when one fails to kill a foe - who, in such cases, does not spare the player - or hits an innocent civilian or colonist. When this happens, energy units are deducted from the Star Ranger's life- support system, and a short clip is shown in which an old man - played by Ben Zeller, the prospector and stagecoach driver in Mad Dog McCree and Mad Dog II: The Lost Gold, respectively - gives general advice and scolds the player for the mistake made. The Star Ranger's weapon of choice is a laser gun, which also happens to be used by the Black Brigade. The energy in the gun is limited, but can be quickly restored an infinite number of times. The gun is also used to choose paths and make simple decisions like shooting the appropriate spot in order to free prisoners. In the PC and 3DO versions of the game, the player can use either a mouse or a light gun to control the action; the 3DO version is also compatible with standard gamepads. The PC version lacks a two-player mode. Reception GamePro gave the 3DO version a mixed review. They criticized that the targeting is inaccurate whether using the standard controller or Gamegun, though they nonetheless felt the gameplay to be \\"mindless fun\\". They particularly praised the game's futuristic setting, saying that the imaginative characters and scenery make the game much more visually appealing and atmospheric than most full motion video games. Next Generation complained that American Laser Games' usage of the same basic format for all their games was becoming tiresome, but acknowledged that the game had good quality video and enjoyable acting and gameplay. They scored it two out of five stars, deeming it \\"entertaining enough, in a brain-dead sort of way\\".

There, he began experiencing a pinching sensation in the shoulder of his right arm.Van Benschoten may miss season He ultimately had surgery to repair a tear to the labrum of his right shoulder as well, and missed the entire 2005 season.Pirates Minicamp: Burnett, Van Benschoten on target Van Benschoten returned to play in August 2006, but made only 5 starts (split between the Bradenton Pirates, Altoona Curve, and Indianapolis Indians) before a further arm injury ended his season. Van Benschoten started the 2007 season at Indianapolis. He made his first start with the Pirates in the 2007 season on June 16 as a starter against the White Sox. Van Benschoten would go back to Indianapolis and be recalled later during the season only to finish the season with no wins and seven losses. Van Benschoten would likewise start the 2008 season with the Indianapolis Indians and remain on the inactive roster for the Pirates. After posting a 4-0 record and a 1.88 ERA with the Indians, he was called up by the Pirates on April 27 to be on the active roster. He currently holds the all-time major league record for highest career ERA with at least 75 innings pitched.Pittsburgh Tribune-Review - Osoria to begin rehab He became a free agent at the end of the season.

They are primarily used as tracers to see how things move around within the ocean-atmosphere system, within terrestrial biomes, within the Earth's surface, and between these broad domains.  Isotope Geochemistry  Chemical elements are defined by their number of protons, but the mass of the atom is determined by the number of protons and neutrons in the nucleus. Isotopes are atoms that are of a specific element, but have different numbers of neutrons and thus different masses. In a specific object, you can have a ratio between two isotopes of an element. This ratio varies slightly in the world, so in order to study isotopic ratio changes across the world, changes in isotope ratios are defined as deviations from a standard, multiplied by 1000. This unit is a \\"per mil\\". As a convention, the ratio is of the heavier isotope to the lower isotope. \\\\delta \\\\ce{^{13}C} = \\\\left( \\\\frac{\\\\left( \\\\frac\\\\ce{^{13}C}\\\\ce{^{12}C} \\\\right)_{sample}}{\\\\left( \\\\frac\\\\ce{^{13}C}\\\\ce{^{12}C} \\\\right)_{standard}} -1 \\\\right) \\\\times 1000 ‚Ä∞ These variations in isotopes can occur through many types of fractionation. They are generally classified as mass independent fractionation and mass dependent fractionation. An example of a mass independent process is the fractionation of oxygen atoms in ozone. This is due to the kinetic isotope effect (KIE) and is caused by different isotope molecules reacting at different speeds. An example of a mass dependent process is the fractionation of water as it transitions from the liquid to gas phase. Water molecules with heavier isotopes (18O and 2H) tend to stay in the liquid phase as water molecules with lighter isotopes (16O and 1H) preferentially move to the gas phase. Of the different isotopes that exist, one common classification is distinguishing radioactive isotopes from stable isotopes. Radioactive isotopes are isotopes that will decay into a different isotope. For example, 3H (tritium) is a radioactive isotope of hydrogen. It decays into 3He with a half-life of ~12.3 years. By comparison, stable isotopes are more stable, decaying much more slowly and having much longer half-lives. Examples of stable isotopes are 86Sr and 87Sr. These isotopes of strontium have half- lives on the order of billions of years or are unmeasured because of how stable they are. On timescales that geologists and environmental scientists investigate, these isotopes are stable. Both of these types of isotopes are useful to scientists. Radioactive isotopes are generally more useful on shorter timescales, such as investigating modern circulation of the ocean using 14C, while stable isotopes are generally more useful on longer timescales, such as investigating differences in river flow with strontium stable isotopes. These isotopes are used as tracers to study various phenomena of interest. These tracers have a certain distribution spatially, and so scientists need to deconvolve the different processes that affect these tracer distributions. One way tracer distributions are set is by conservative mixing. In conservative mixing, the amount of the tracer is conserved. An example of this is mixing two water masses with different salinities. The salt from the saltier water mass moves to the less salty water mass, keeping the total amount of salinity constant. This way of mixing tracers is very important, giving a baseline of what value of a tracer one should expect. The value of a tracer as a point is expected to be an average value of the sources that flow into that region. Deviations from this are indicative of other processes. These can be called nonconservative mixing, where there are other processes that do not conserve the amount of tracer. An example of this is ùõø14C. This mixes between water masses, but it also decays over time, reducing the amount of 14C in the region.  Useful Elements  The most used environmental isotopes are: * deuterium * tritium * carbon-13 * carbon-14 * nitrogen-15 * oxygen-18 * silicon-29 * chlorine-36 * isotopes of uranium * isotopes of strontium  Ocean Circulation  One topic that environmental isotopes are used to study is the circulation of the ocean. Treating the ocean as a box is only useful in some studies; in depth consideration of the oceans in general circulation models (GCM's) requires knowing how the ocean circulates. This leads to an understanding of how the oceans (along with the atmosphere) transfer heat from the tropics to the poles. This also helps deconvolve circulation effects from other phenomena that affect certain tracers such as radioactive and biological processes. A summary of the path of the thermohaline circulation. Blue paths represent deep-water currents, while red paths represent surface currents. Using rudimentary observation techniques, the circulation of the surface ocean can be determined. In the Atlantic basin, surface waters flow from the south towards the north in general, while also creating gyres in the northern and southern Atlantic. In the Pacific Ocean, the gyres still form, but there is comparatively very little large scale meridional (North-South) movement. For deep waters, there are two areas where density causes waters to sink into the deep ocean. These are in the North Atlantic and the Antarctic. The deep water masses formed are North Atlantic Deep Water (NADW) and Antarctic Bottom Water (AABW). Deep waters are mixtures of these two waters, and understanding how waters are composed of these two water masses can tell us about how water masses move around in the deep ocean. This can be investigated with environmental isotopes, including 14C. 14C is predominantly produced in the upper atmosphere and from nuclear testing, with no major sources or sinks in the ocean. This 14C from the atmosphere becomes oxidized into 14CO2, allowing it to enter the surface ocean through gas transfer. This is transferred into the deep ocean through NADW and AABW. In NADW, the ùõø14C is approximately -60‚Ä∞, and in AABW, the ùõø14C is approximately -160‚Ä∞. Thus, using conservative mixing of radiocarbon, the expected amount of radiocarbon in various locations can be determined using the percent compositions of NADW and AABW at that location. This can be determined using other tracers, such as phosphate star or salinity. Deviations from this expected value are indicative of other processes that affect the delta ratio of radiocarbon, namely radioactive decay. This deviation can be converted to a time, giving the age of the water at that location. Doing this over the world's ocean can yield a circulation pattern of the ocean and the rate at which water flow through the deep ocean. Using this circulation in conjunction with the surface circulation allows scientists to understand the energy balance of the world. Warmer surface waters flow northward while colder deep waters flow southward, leading to net heat transfer towards the pole.  Paleoclimate  Isotopes are also used to study paleoclimate. This is the study of how climate was in the past, from hundreds of years ago to hundreds of thousands of years ago. The only records of these times that we have are buried in rocks, sediments, biological shells, stalagmites and stalactites, etc. The isotope ratios in these samples were affected by the temperature, salinity, circulation of the ocean, precipitation, etc. of the climate at the time, causing a measurable change from the standards for isotope measurements. This is how climate information is encoded in these geological formations. Some of the many isotopes useful for environmental science are discussed below.  Delta O18  One useful isotope for reconstructing past climates is oxygen-18. It is another stable isotope of oxygen along with oxygen-16, and its incorporation into water and carbon dioxide/carbonate molecules is strongly temperature dependent. Higher temperature implies more incorporation of oxygen-18, and vice versa. Thus, the ratio of 18O/16O can tell something about temperature. For water, the isotope ratio standard is Vienna Standard Mean Ocean Water, and for carbonates, the standard is Pee Dee Belemnite. Using ice cores and sediment cores that record information about the water and shells from past times, this ratio can tell scientists about the temperature of those times. Lisiecki and Raymo (2005) showing oscillations in the Earth's temperature over time. These oscillations have a 41 kyr cycle until about 1.2 million years ago, switching to a 100 kyr cycle that we see now. This ratio is used with ice cores to determine the temperature at the spot in the ice core. Depth in an ice core is proportional to time, and it is \\"wiggle-matched\\" with other records to determine the true time of the ice at that depth. This can be done by comparing Œ¥18O in calcium carbonate shells in sediment cores to these records to match large scale changes in the temperature of the Earth. Once the ice cores are matched to sediment cores, highly accurate dating methods such as U-series dating can be used to accurately determine the time of these events. There are some processes that mix water from different times into the same depth in the ice core, such as firn production and sloped landscape floes. Lisiecki and Raymo (2005) used measurements of Œ¥18O in benthic foraminifera from 57 globally distributed deep sea sediment cores, taken as a proxy for the total global mass of glacial ice sheets, to reconstruct the climate for the past five million years. This record shows oscillations of 2-10 degrees Celsius over this time. Between 5 million and 1.2 million years ago, these oscillations had a period of 41,000 years (41 kyr), but about 1.2 million years ago the period switch to 100 kyr. These changes in global temperature match with changes in orbital parameters of the Earth's orbit around the Sun. These are called Milankovitch cycles, and these are related to eccentricity, obliquity (axial tilt), and precession of Earth around its axis. These correspond to cycles with periods of 100 kyr, 40 kyr, and 20 kyr. Œ¥18O can also be used to investigate smaller scale climate phenomena. Koutavas et al. (2006) used Œ¥18O of G. ruber foraminifera to study the El Ni√±o‚ÄìSouthern Oscillation (ENSO) and it's variability through the mid-Holocene.Koutavas A, Demenocal PB, Olive GC, Lynch-Stieglitz J. 2006. Mid-Holocene El NiÀú no- Southern Oscillation (ENSO) attenuation revealed by individual foraminifera in eastern tropical Pacific sediments. Geology 34:993‚Äì96 By isolating individual foram shells, Koutavas et al. were able to obtain a spread of Œ¥18O values at a specific depth. Because these forams live for approximately a month and that the individual forams were from many different months, clumped together in a small depth range in the coral, the variability of Œ¥18O was able to be determined. In the eastern Pacific, where these cores were taken, the primary driver of this variability is ENSO, making this a record of ENSO variability over the core's time span. Koutavas et al. found that ENSO was much less variable in the mid Holocene (~6,000 years ago) than it is currently.  Strontium isotopes  Another set of environmental isotopes used in paleoclimate is strontium isotopes. Strontium-86 and strontium-87 are both stable isotopes of strontium, but strontium-87 is radiogenic, coming from the decay of rubidium-87. The ratio of these two isotopes depends on the concentration of rubidium-87 initially and the age of the sample, assuming that the background concentration of strontium-87 is known. This is useful because 87Rb is predominantly found in continental rocks. Particles from these rocks come into the ocean through weathering by rivers, meaning that this strontium isotope ratio is related to the weathering ion flux coming from rivers into the ocean. The background concentration in the ocean for 87Sr/86Sr is 0.709 ¬± 0.0012. Because the strontium ratio is recorded in sedimentary records, the oscillations of this ratio over time can be studied. These oscillations are related to the riverine input into the oceans or into the local basin. Richter and Turekian have done work on this, finding that over glacial-interglacial timescales (105 years), the 87Sr/86Sr ratio varies by 3*10‚àí5. Decay series of Actinides, including Uranium, Protactinium, Thorium, and Lead  Uranium and related isotopes  Uranium has many radioactive isotopes that continue emitting particles down a decay chain. Uranium-235 is in one such chain, and decays into protactinium-231 and then into other products. Uranium-238 is in a separate chain, decaying into a series of elements, including thorium-230. Both of these series end up forming lead, either lead-207 from uranium-235 or lead-206 from uranium-238. All of these decays are alpha or beta decays, meaning that they all follow first order rate equations of the form dN/dt=\\\\lambda N, where Œª is the half-life of the isotope in question. This makes it simple to determine the age of a sample based on the various ratios of radioactive isotopes that exist. One way uranium isotopes are used is to date rocks from millions to billions of years ago. This is through uranium-lead dating. This technique uses zircon samples and measures the lead content in them. Zircon incorporates uranium and thorium atoms into its crystal structure, but strongly rejects lead. Thus, the only sources of lead in a zircon crystal are through decay of uranium and thorium. Both the uranium-235 and uranium-238 series decay into an isotope of lead. The \\"half-life\\" of converting 235U to 207Pb is 710 million years, and the \\"half- life\\" of converting 238U to 206Pb is 4.47 billion years. Because of high resolution mass-spectroscopy, both chains can be used to date rocks, giving complementary information about the rocks. The large difference in half-lives makes the technique robust over long time scales, from on the order of millions of years to on the order of billions of years. Another way uranium isotopes are used in environmental science is the ratio of 231Pa/230Th. These radiogenic isotopes have different uranium parents, but have very different reactivities in the ocean. The uranium profile in the ocean is constant because uranium has a very large residence time compared to the residence time of the ocean. The decay of uranium is thus also isotropic, but the daughter isotopes react differently. Thorium is readily scavenged by particles, leading to rapid removal from the ocean into sediments. By contrast, 231Pa is not as particle-reactive, feeling the circulation of the ocean in small amounts before settling into the sediment. Thus, knowing the decay rates of both isotopes and the fractions of each uranium isotopes, the expected ratio of 231Pa/230Th can be determined, with any deviation from this value being due to circulation. Circulation leads to a higher 231Pa/230Th ratio downstream and a lower ratio upstream, with the magnitude of the deviation being related to flow rate. This technique has been used to quantify the Atlantic Meridional Overturning Circulation (AMOC) during the Last Glacial Maximum (LGM) and during abrupt climate change events in Earth's past, such as Heinrich events and Dansgaard-Oeschger events.  Neodymium  Neodymium isotopes are also used to determine circulation in the ocean. All of the isotopes of neodymium are stable on the timescales of glacial-interglacial cycles, but 143Nd is a daughter of 147Sm, a radioactive isotope in the ocean. Samarium-147 has higher concentrations in mantle rocks vs crust rocks, so areas that receive river inputs from mantle-derived rocks have higher concentrations of 147Sm and 143Nd. However, these differences are so small, the standard notation of a delta value are no blunt for it; a more precise epsilon value is used to describe variations in this ratio of neodymium isotopes. It is defined as \\\\epsilon \\\\ce{_{Nd}} = \\\\left( \\\\frac{\\\\left( \\\\frac\\\\ce{^{143}Nd}\\\\ce{^{144}Nd} \\\\right)_{sample}}{\\\\left( \\\\frac\\\\ce{^{143}Nd}\\\\ce{^{144}Nd} \\\\right)_{standard}} -1 \\\\right) \\\\times 10000 The only major sources of this in the ocean are in the North Atlantic and in the deep Pacific Ocean. Because one of the end-members is set in the interior of the ocean, this technique has the potential to tell us complementary information about paleoclimate compared to all other ocean tracers that are only set in the surface ocean.

Knobelsdorff was born in Kuck√§del, now in Krosno Odrza≈Ñskie County. A soldier in the service of Prussia, he resigned his commission in 1729 as captain so that he could pursue his interest in architecture. In 1740 he travelled to Paris and Italy to study at the expense of the new king, Frederick II of Prussia. Knobelsdorff was influenced as an architect by French Baroque Classicism and by Palladian architecture. With his interior design and the backing of the king, he created the basis for the Frederician Rococo style at Rheinsberg, which was the residence of the crown prince and later monarch. Knobelsdorff was the head custodian of royal buildings and head of a privy council on financial matters. In 1746 he was fired by the king, and Johann Boumann finished all his projects, including Sanssouci. Knobelsdorff died in Berlin. His grave is preserved in the Protestant Friedhof I der Jerusalems- und Neuen Kirchengemeinde (Cemetery No. I of the congregations of Jerusalem's Church and New Church) in Berlin-Kreuzberg, south of Hallesches Tor. Karl Begas the younger created a statue of Knobelsdorff in 1886. This originally stood in the entrance hall of the Altes Museum (in Berlin) and is now in a depot of the state museum. Life and works=Military service and artistic development Georg Wenzeslaus von Knobelsdorff, the son of Silesian landed gentry, was born on February 17, 1699 on the estate of Kuck√§del (now Polish Kukadlo) near Crossen (now the Polish city Krosno Odrza≈Ñskie) on the Oder River. After the early death of his father he was raised by his godfather, the chief senior forester Georg von Knobelsdorff. In keeping with family tradition he began his professional career in the Prussian army. Already at 16 years of age he participated in a campaign against King Charles XII of Sweden, and in 1715 in the siege of Stralsund. While still a soldier he developed his artistic talents in self-study. After leaving military service he arranged to be trained in various painting techniques by the Prussian court painter Antoine Pesne, with whom he shared a lifelong friendship. Knobelsdorff also acquired additional expertise in geometry and anatomy. He saw his professional future in painting, and his pictures and drawings were always highly appreciated, even after the focus of his activities turned elsewhere. His interest in architecture developed in a roundabout way, and came from representing buildings in his pictures. Later, the pictorial aspect of his architectural sketches was often noted and met with varying reactions. Heinrich Ludwig Manger, as an architect more a technician than an artist, wrote with a critical undertone in 1789 in his Baugeschichte von Potsdam, that Knobelsdorff designed his buildings \\"merely in a perspective and picturesque way\\", but praised his paintings. Frederick the Great, in contrast, commented positively on the architect's \\"picturesque style\\" (gout pittoresque). There is also no evidence that the informal style of his drawings ever posed a serious impediment to the execution of his buildings. Knobelsdorff acquired the expertise needed for his new profession again primarily in self-study, after a brief period of training under the architects Kemmeter and von Wangenheim. This breed of \\"gentlemen architects\\" was not unusual in the 16th and 17th centuries, and they were esteemed both socially and because of their specialized competence. They trained themselves by studying actual buildings on extensive travels as well as collections of engravings showing views of classical and contemporary buildings. Knobelsdorff's ideal models, the Englishmen Inigo Jones (1573‚Äì1652) and William Kent (1684‚Äì1748) as well as the Frenchman Claude Perrault (1613‚Äì1688), likewise grew into their professions in a roundabout way and were no longer young men when they turned to architecture. Neuruppin and Rheinsberg Design for the Apollo Temple in Neuruppin View of Rheinsberg 1737, excerpt from a Knobelsdorff painting Rheinsberg Castle around 1740, excerpt from an engraving Knobelsdorff gained the attention of King Frederick William I of Prussia (the \\"Soldier-King\\"), who had him join the entourage of his son, crown prince Frederick, later King Frederick II (Frederick the Great). After his failed attempt to flee Prussia and subsequent imprisonment in K√ºstrin, (now Polish Kostrzyn nad OdrƒÖ), Frederick had just been granted somewhat more freedom of movement by his strict father. Apparently, the king hoped that Knobelsdorff, as a sensible and artistically talented nobleman, would have a moderating influence on his son. (The sources vary as to what prompted the first meeting between Knobelsdorff and Frederick, but they all date the event as being in 1732.) At the time the crown prince, who had been appointed a colonel when he turned 20, took over responsibility for a regiment in the garrison town of Neuruppin. Knobelsdorf became his partner in discussions and advised him on issues of art and architecture. Immediately in front of the city walls they jointly planned the Amalthea garden, which contained a monopteros, a little Apollo temple of classical design. This was the first construction of its type on the European continent and Knobelsdorff's first creation as Frederick the Great's architect. This was where they made music, philosophized, and celebrated, and also after the crown prince had moved to nearby Rheinsberg Castle he frequently visited the temple garden during visits connected with his duties as commander in the Neuruppin garrison. In 1736 the crown prince gave Knobelsdorff an opportunity to go on a study tour to Italy, which lasted until spring 1737. His stops included Rome, Naples and vicinity, Florence and Venice. His recorded his impressions in a travel sketchbook which contains almost one hundred pencil drawings, but only of part of his trip since on the return stretch he broke his arm in a traffic accident between Rome and Florence. He was unable to carry out a secret mission which involved engaging Italian opera singers to come to Rheinsburg since the available funds were inadequate. Knobelsdorff wrote to the crown prince that \\"The castrati here cannot be tempted to leave [...] regular employment, especially for those from the poorer classes, is the reason why they prefer 100 Rthlr (Reichstaler) in Rome to thousands abroad. In autumn 1740, shortly after Frederick assumed the throne, Knobelsdorff was sent on another study tour. In Paris only the work of the architect Perrault impressed him‚Äîthe frontage of the Louvre and the garden side of the castle in Versailles. As to paintings, he listed those of Watteau, Poussin, Chardin and others. On the return trip via Flanders he saw paintings by van Dyck and Rubens. Rheinsberg Palace and the modest household of the crown prince became a place of relaxed communion and artistic creativity, quite in contrast to the dry, matter-of-fact atmosphere at the Berlin court of the soldier-king. This was where Frederick and Knobelsdorff discussed architecture and city planning, and developed their first ideas for an extensive program of construction which was to be realized when the crown prince assumed the throne. Rheinsberg was where Knobelsdorff received his first major architectural challenge. At that time the palace consisted only of a tower and a building wing. In a painting from 1737 Knobelsdorff depicted the situation before the alterations, as viewed from the far shore of Lake Grienericksee. After preliminary work by the architect and builder Kemmeter and in regular consultation with Frederick, Kobelsdorff gave the ensemble its present form. He extended the grounds by a second tower and matching building wing and by a colonnade connecting both towers. Forum Fridericianum As a significant construction, this design was planned already in Rheinsberg as a signal for the start Frederick's reign. In Berlin the king wanted to have a new city palace that could stand up to the splendid residences of major European powers. Knobelsdorff designed an extensive building complex with inner courtyards and in front a cour d'honneur and semicircular colonnades just north of the street Unter den Linden. In front of that he planned a spacious square with two free-standing buildings‚Äîan opera house and a hall for ball games. Soon after Frederick acceded to the throne in May 1740, foundation testing began, as well as negotiations about the purchase and demolition of 54 houses that interfered with the project. Already on August 19, 1740 all these preparations were discontinued, supposedly because the intended ground was unsuitable. But in fact the king's distant relatives refused to sell their palaces, which were located in the middle of the planned square. Frederick attempted to rescue the situation and sketched in modifications on the plan of the layout. When the First Silesian War (1740‚Äì1742) began, decisions about the Forum had to be postponed. However, even while the war was being waged the king wanted Knobelsdorff to begin construction of the opera house, today's Berlin State Opera (Staatsoper Unter den Linden). Work languished on the Forum also after the end of the war. Beginning of 1745 Frederick's increasing interest in Potsdam as a second residence became evident and the original plans moved into the background. Construction on the square with the opera house (Opernplatz, today's Bebelplatz) moved in another direction. In 1747 work began on St. Hedwig's Cathedral, in 1748 on the Prince Heinrich Palace, and between 1775 and 1786 the Royal Library was erected. The final square bore little resemblance to the original plan, but was highly praised already by contemporaries and also in this form caused the royal architect to achieve great eminence. The terms \\"Frederick's Forum\\" and \\"Forum Fridericianum\\" only appeared in specialist literature in the 19th century and were never officially used to refer to the square. Opera House and St. Hedwig's Cathedral Berlin Opera House and St. Hedwig's Cathedral in 1850 Knobelsdorff was involved in the construction of St. Hedwig's Cathedral, but it is uncertain to what extent. Frederick II presented the Catholic community with complete building plans, which were probably primarily his ideas which were then realized by Knobelsdorff. The opera house, by contrast, was completely designed by Knobelsdorff and is considered to be one of his most important works. For the frontage of the externally modestly structured building the architect followed the model of two views from Colin Campbell's \\"Vitruvius Britannicus\\", one of the most important collections of architectonic engravings, which included works of English Palladian architecture. For the interior he designed a series of three prominent rooms with different functions, which were at different levels, and were decorated differently: the Apollo Hall, the spectator viewing area, and the stage. By technical means they could be turned into one large room for major festivities. Knobelsdorff described the technical features in a Berlin newspaper, proudly commenting that \\"this theater is one of the longest and widest in the world\\". In 1843 the building burned down to the foundation. In World War II it suffered several times from bombing. Each time the rebuilding followed Knobelsdorff's intentions, but there were also clear modifications of both the facing and the interior. Soon after they were completed, the opera house and St. Hedwig's Cathedral were featured in textbooks and manuals on architecture. Tiergarten park and dairy The Tiergarten Park in Berlin, 1765 Already in Neuruppin and Rheinsberg Knobelsdorff had designed together with the crown prince gardens which followed a French style. On November 30, 1741, Frederick II, now king, issued a decree which initiated the redesign of the Berlin Tiergarten to make it the \\"Parc de Berlin\\". The document pointed out that Baron Knobelsdorff had received precise instructions concerning the changeover. The Tiergarten, in times past the private hunting grounds of the Electors and greatly neglected under Frederick's father, was to be turned into the public park and gardens of the royal residence city Berlin. In order to protect the newly cultivated areas the practice of driving cattle on the grounds was forbidden with immediate effect. Frederick's interest in this project can also be recognized in a later decree, which forbade the removal of large bushes or trees without the specific permission of the king. As a precondition to redesigning the Tiergarten, large portions of the grounds had to be drained. In many cases Knobelsdorff gave the necessary drainage ditches the form of natural waterfalls, a solution which Friedrich II later praised. The actual work began with the improvement of the main axis of the park, a path which extended the boulevard Unter den Linden through the Tiergarten to Charlottenburg (now Strasse des 17. Juni. This road was lined with hedges, and the junction of eight avenues marked by the Berlin victory column (Siegess√§ule) was decorated with 16 statues. To the south Knobelsdorff arranged for three so-called labyrinths (these were actually mazes) in the pattern of famous French parks‚Äîareas separated off with artistically designed intertwined hedgerows. Especially in the eastern part of the park near the Brandenburg Gate there was a dense network of pathways which constantly intersected and contained many \\"salons\\" and \\"cabinets\\"‚Äîsmall enclosed areas so to speak \\"furnished\\" with benches and fountains. Knobelsdorff's successor, the court gardener Justus Ehrenreich Sello, began the modification of these late Barock pleasure grounds in the style of the new ideal of an English landscape park. Toward the end of the 18th century there was hardly anything left of Knobelsdorff's version except for the main features of the system of paths. But the fact remains that he designed the first park in Germany open to the public from the very beginning. Beginning of 1746 Knobelsdorff purchased at a good price extensive grounds on the verge of the Tiergarten at an auction. It was situated between the victory column and the Spree River, about where today Bellevue Palace is located. The property included a mulberry plantation, meadows and farmland, vegetable beds and two dairys. Knobelsdorff had a new main building erected, externally a plain garden house. The wall and ceiling paintings in several rooms were considered to be a present from Antoine Pesne to his student and friend. The building was demolished in 1938. A number of biographers were of the opinion that Knobelsdorff used his property in the Tiergarten only to spend the idyllic summer months there together with his family each year. But the fact is that this land was intensively cultivated as both a fruit and a vegetable garden and turned out to be a useful investment. Knobelsdorff himself read books about the care of fruit trees and the cultivation of vegetables. One of them, (Ecole du Jardin potageur) contained a taxonomy of various kinds of vegetables, organized according to their curative powers. This gave rise to the suspicion that Knobelsdorff hoped for some relief from his chronic health problems from the plants in his garden. Monbijou, Charlottenburg, Potsdam City Palace The structural modifications to these three palaces are part of the extensive program that Knobelsdorff tackled on behalf of Frederick II right after he acceded to the throne, or a few years thereafter. Monbijou Palace started out as a single- storey pavilion with gardens on the Spree and was the summer residence, and after 1740 the widow's seat, of queen Sophie Dorothee of Prussia, the mother of Frederick II. The pavilion soon turned out to be too small for the queen's representational needs, having only five rooms and a gallery. Under Knobelsdorff's leadership the building was expanded in two phases between 1738 and 1742 into an extensive, symmetrical structure with side wings and small pavilions. Surfaces with strong colors, gilding, ornaments and sculptures gave structure to the lengthy building. This version was gone already by 1755. Up until its almost total destruction in World War II the facing had a smooth white plaster coating. All remains of the building were cleared away in 1959/60. Charlottenburg Palace was hardly used under Frederick William I. His son considered residing there and right at the beginning of his reign had it enlarged by Knobelsdorff. Thus a new part of the building arose, east of the original palace and known as the new wing or Knobelsdorff wing. It contained two rooms famous for their decoration. The White Hall, Frederick the Great's dining and throne room with a ceiling painting by Pesne, leaves a restrained, almost Classicist, impression. By contrast, the Golden Gallery with its very rich ornamentation, green and gold colors is considered the epitome of Frederician rococo. The contrast between these two neighboring rooms makes clear the range of Knobelsdorff's artistic forms of expression. The king's interest in Charlottenburg waned as he began to consider Potsdam as a second official residence, started to build there, and finally lived there. Charlottenburg Palace was heavily damaged in World War II and after 1945 reconstructed in a form faithful to the original to a large extent. Potsdam City Palace. This baroque edifice was completed in 1669. After plans for a new palace residence in Berlin were abandoned, Frederick the Great had the castle rebuilt by Knobelsdorff between 1744 and 1752, with rich interior decorations in rococo style. His changes to the frontage had the goal of lightening up the massive building. Pilasters and figures of light colored sandstone clearly projected from red plaster surfaces. Numerous decorative elements were added and the blue-lacquered copper-covered roofs were crowned with richly decorated chimneys. Many of these details were soon lost and not replaced. In World War II the building was badly damaged and 1959/60 what was left was completely removed. The Brandenburg State Parliament decided to have the City Palace rebuilt by 2011, at least as to its exterior. Since 2002 a copy of part of the building, the so-called Fortuna portico, has been reconstructed at its historic location.

He had made quite specific sketches of what he desired, and had Knobelsdorff take care of the realization. They specified a single storey building resting on the ground of the vineyard terraces on the southern slope of the Bornstedt Heights in northwest Potsdam. Knobelsdorff raised objections to this idea; he wanted to increase the height of the building by adding a souterrain level to serve as a pedestal, plus a basement, and to move it forward to the edge of the terraces since it would otherwise look as if it had sunk into the ground if viewed from the foot of the vineyard hill. Frederick however insisted on his version. Even the suggestion that his plan increased the possibility of suffering from gout and catching cold did not cause Frederick to change his mind. Later he ran into these very difficulties, but bore them without complaint. After only two years of construction, Sansoussi Palace (\\"my little vineyard house\\") was how Frederick referred to it) was dedicated on May 1, 1747. Frederick the Great usually resided there from May to September; the winter months he spent in the Potsdam City Palace. Decorative art Schloss Charlottenburg, Golden Gallery. Detail Evidence for Knobelsdorff's artistic versatility is found in his designs for garden vases, mirror frames, furniture and coaches. This kind of activity culminated in the design of large representational rooms, such as the spectator area of the Berlin State Opera Unter den Lindon and the large rooms in Charlottenburg Palace. Decorative ornamentation was an important feature of European rococo. Three French masters of this art, Antoine Watteau, Jules Aurele Meissonier and Jaques de La Joue, had created patterns and models which found wide circulation in the form of etchings and engravings. Knobelsdorff was obviously especially influenced by Watteau's work, whose motifs he had taken over and adapted in Rheinsberg for mirror and picture frames. This influence turned out to be determinative for the design of the Golden Gallery in the New Wing of Charlottenburg Palace, a masterpiece of Frederician rokoko, built between 1741 and 1746. It was destroyed in World War II and later rebuilt. The artist, who himself had a lifelong affinity with nature, created here an artistic realm which was intended to evoke and glorify nature. At the same time the scenery of the actual palace park was brought into the room with the help of mirrors. The gallery is 42 meters long; the walls are covered with chrysoprase green scagliola; ornaments, benches and corbels are gilded. The walls and ceiling are covered with ornaments based in most cases on plant motifs. Watteau's notion of ornamental grotesques‚Äîa frame of fanciful plants and architectonic motifs surrounds a scene showing trees and people undertaking rural pleasures‚Äîclearly often served as inspiration. The French church in Potsdam The French Church is one of Knobelsdorff's late works. For the Hugenot congregation he designed a small round building which recalled the Pantheon in Rome. Construction was carried out by Jan Boumann, whose talents as an architect were not esteemed by Knobelsdorff, but who was often preferred for commissions in later years. The church has an oval ground plan of about 15:20 meters and a free-floating dome which 80 years later Karl Friedrich Schinkel declared to be very daring as to its statics. The modest interior gives the impression of an amphitheater because of the encircling wooden balcony. As specified by the French Reformed Church service there were no embellishments‚Äîno cross, no baptismal font, no figural decoration. Frederick II handed over the completed church to the Potsdam congregation on September 16, 1753, the day of Knobelsdorff's death. In the 19th century Schinkel modified the interior fittings, since they had in the meantime come into disrepair. The church had been built on a damp foundation so damages appeared in quick succession. The church had to be closed several times for periods of years, but in the end it even managed to survive World War II intact. The latest extensive renovations took place from 1990 to 2003. Illness and death In 1753 Knobelsdorff's long-time liver disease became more troublesome. A journey to the Belgian therapeutic baths at Spa brought no relief. On September 7, 1753, only a short while before his death, Knobelsdorff wrote to the king, \\"when the pain briefly stopped\\". He thanked him \\"for all the kindness and all the benefits Your Majesty has showered on me during my lifetime\\". At the same time he requested that his two daughters be recognized as his legal heirs. That was problematic because the girls came from a liaison not befitting his social class. The long-time bachelor Knobelsdorff had entered into a relationship with the \\"middle class\\" daughter of the Charlottenburg sacristan, Sch√∂ne, in 1746, thereby earning the disapproval of court society. Frederick II agreed to his request, however with the restriction that his title of nobility not be bequeathed. Knobelsdorff died on September 16, 1753. Two days later the Berlinische Nachrichten reported, \\"On the 16th of this month the honorable gentleman, Mr. George Wentzel, Baron of Knobelsdorff, artistic director of all royal palaces, houses and gardens, director-in-chief of all construction in all provinces, as well as finance, war and domain councillor, departed this life after a prolonged illness in the 53rd year of his renowned existence.\\" On September 18 he was buried in the vault of the German Church on Gendarmenmarkt. Four years later his friend Antoine Pesne was buried next to him. When the church was rebuilt in 1881 these mortal remains were transferred to one of the cemeteries at Hallisches Tor; his grave was marked with a marble slab and a putto. This gravesite was destroyed by a bomb in World War II. Today a simple white marble memorial on an honorary grave of the State of Berlin in Cemetery No. 1 of the Jerusalem and New Church congregation brings to mind Knobelsdorff and Pesne. Models As an architect Knobelsdorff was greatly influenced by Andrea Palladio's buildings and theoretical works on architecture. This important Italian architect of the High Renaissance published in 1570 the definitive work, \\"Quattro libri dell¬¥architettura\\" containing his own creations as well numerous drawings of antique architecture. Stimulated by Palladio, a building style developed which was widespread in the 17th century in Protestant and Anglican Northern Europe, especially England. In contrast to the simultaneous baroque style with its silhouettes and concave-convex frontage reliefs, Palladianism made use of classically simple, clear shapes. Knobelsdorff also undertook to follow this style on almost all his buildings, at least as far as the exteriors. He did not simply copy the models but converted them into his own style (only after his death did direct copies of foreign frontages become common in Berlin and Potsdam). In the broad sense he already represented Classicism, which in the narrow sense only began in Prussia in the late 18th century and achieved its apex in the early 19th century with Karl Friedrich Schinkel. As to interior decoration, Knobelsdorff followed from the beginning the main fashions of his time and provided superb examples of late baroque decorative art in his Frederician rococo style, which was inspired by French models. Art collection Knobelsdorff was an enthusiastic collector of art, a fact unknown until the recent discovery of old inventory lists. He bequeathed to his friend, Lieutenant Colonel von Keith, an extensive collection of paintings and engravings virtually unmatched in 18th century Berlin. The trustees of his estate counted and appraised 368 paintings valued at ca. 5400 Reichstaler and over 100 engravings worth 400 Reichstaler. It is not clear how Knobelsdorff could have purchased such a considerable collection. There was no regular art market at that time in Berlin; at most, there were individual sales or legacy auctions which sometimes also included works of art. Probably contacts with Amsterdam and Rotterdam, centers of a thriving Dutch art market, were of use. The focus of his art collection was on landscape painting, especially Dutch paintings from the second half of the 17th century. Portraits were another important part of the collection, and there were also some scenes of battles, reflecting the taste of the times. Contemporary painters were hardly represented, and there were 37 specimens of Knobelsdorff's own work. Soon after his death the collection was dispersed and sold. Knobelsdorff and Friedrich II. Knobelsdorff's relationship to Frederick II was a central aspect of his life. Something akin to friendship arose in Neuruppin and Rheinsberg from their joint interest in art and architecture. This almost constant personal contact and focus on only a few subjects important to both of them came to a natural end when the crown prince acceded to the throne as Frederick II in 1740 and concentrated on new areas such as waging war and administering the state, which meant he had to establish and maintain contacts with a much larger circle of advisors and collaborators. Since Frederick recognized the qualities of Knobelsdorff and expected great things of him he immediately bombarded him with work, but also gave him titles and awards and allocated a magnificent house in Leipziger Strasse for his use while in his service. He was given overall control of all royal buildings, and was also director of plays and musical performances (until 1742). Besides his specific architectural duties he had to carry out administrative tasks and deal with many side issues, such as arranging for fireworks in the Charlottenburg Palace gardens, design decorations for the opera, and deal with horse stables in Berlin. Although Knobelsdorff usually provided only plans and projections and left their realization to experienced architects and technicians, the work was sometimes more than he could manage. This annoyed the impatient king. In 1732 he urged him to work faster, \\"so that I will have no reason to show my displeasure and to make changes in arrangements for the house I gave you as a residence in berlin.... He does not carry out anything the way I want it and is as lazy as an artillery horse\\". In the beginning such disagreements were the exception . Frederick the Great's sketch showing his intentions for Sanssouci Palace The deer garden colonnade in Sanssouci Park, which did not survive Proposal for the Neptune grotto in Sanssouci Park But from the start there was a fundamental disagreement which gradually became more and more evident. For Knobelsdorff, who was a serious artist, architecture and painting were at the core of his being. Frederick the Great had a lively interest in both and developed some pertinent expertise, but remained an outsider for whom concern with architecture could not be the main focus of attention. He sometimes compared his interest in these matters with the lighthearted pleasure of a child playing with dolls. Both the king and his architect were uncompromising, occasionally brusque personalities. Accordingly, different views about factual issues increasingly turned into personal tensions. When Knobelsdorff decidedly contradicted the king concerning plans for Sanssouci Palace, he was removed from his position of responsibility for the construction of the palace in April 1746‚Äîostensibly for health reasons. In 1747 complete disorder was discovered in the expense accounts managed by the building controller, Fincke, who had for years been involved in major projects under Knobelsdorff's leadership. Frederick thereupon wrote a letter to his architect which \\"expressed his extreme displeasure\\" with the fact that he \\"no longer pays attention to orderliness and correctness.\\" This was the start of a permanent estrangement. Although Knobelsdorff continued to receive all types of building assignments‚Äîhe designed the deer garden colonnade (Marble Colonnade), the Neptune grotto in Potsdam, the Neustadt Gate, several residences, the French Church, the obelisk on the market square and many other objects‚Äîfor years he kept at a distance to the royal court. An attempt to bridge this gap ended in failure. The king summoned him to Potsdam in summer 1750, but soon got annoyed about some comment of the architect's and ordered him to return to Berlin. Knobelsdorff immediately set out, but halfway to Berlin a Feldj√§ger (military policeman) caught up with him with the message that he was to return to the court. According to tradition his response was, \\"The king himself ordered me to return to Berlin. I well known whether I have to follow his orders or those of a Feldj√§ger\\", whereupon he continued his journey. After that episode he never saw the king again. Frederick II had apparently provided sketches of his own for all major buildings on which Knobelsdorff worked, and it is not always possible to determine the extent of his contribution. Whoever wants to evaluate his share in the creative process must also consider that the king's sketches might reflect the results of joint deliberations with his architect. In the beginning the young crown prince regarded Knobelsdorff, who was 13 years older than he, as his mentor in questions of art and architecture, and followed his suggestions. Later he frequently insisted on his own views in particular cases and enforced them with the authority of his superior position. But basically his artistic opinions were in agreement with those of Knobelsdorff. Even after the latter's death he had, for example, the theater room and the marble hall of the Potsdam City Palace, both designed by Knobelsdorff, copied in the New Palace of Sanssouci‚Äîwhich suggests that the tensions which finally arose were not primarily a result of artistic differences but rather of personal touchiness. Personal Assessments Jakob Friedrich Baron von Bielfeld, who was for a time part of the crown prince's retinue in Rheinsberg, wrote in 1739: \\"Mr. von Knobelsdorff is a gentleman of serious disposition and with a somewhat stern visage, but of considerable merit. His external appearance is neither charming nor courtly, but that makes him no less admirable. I compare him to a beautiful oak tree, and you know, it is not at all necessary for all the trees in a garden to be trimmed into arches as gracefully as in Marly\\" (translation). Heinrich Ludwig Manger mentions Knobelsdorff in his \\"Baugeschichte von Potsdam\\" (1789/90). After listing 30 pieces of architecture which were realized in Potsdam alone according to his plans, he also writes about Knobelsdorff as a painter: \\"Although it does not really belong in a history of architecture.‚Äîhe produced many paintings, all of them directly from nature. He paid attention to every detail which he thought could be of possible future use, and sketched them in his notebook, which he kept in a particular place of his clothing. These drawings are free and easy and dashed off in his own masterly way. [...] The same can also be said of his landscape paintings, because everything in them was painted from nature with a wonderful blending of colors, without being hard or too colorful\\" (translation). Fredrick the Great wrote a commemorative address on Knobelsdorff in French and had it read on January 24, 1754 before the Academy of Sciences, to which Knobelsdorff had belonged since 1742 as an honorary member. He referred in it to the tensions which had arisen between the two of them in Knobelsdorff's last years, but made it very clear that he continued to admire him: \\"Knobelsdorff was on the whole held in high esteem because of his sincere and upright character. He loved the truth and believed it could not harm anyone. Agreeableness he considered to be a constraint and he avoided everything that seemed to restrict his freedom. One had to know him well to fully appreciate his merit. He encouraged young talents, loved artists, and preferred being sought out to putting himself in the forefront. Above all it must be said in his praise that he never confused competition with jealousy, two very different feelings [...]\\" (translation).

In his boyhood, he journeyed to Przemy≈õl, Red Ruthenia, to study the Talmud under Rabbi Samuel ben Phoebus of Krak√≥w. He returned to his native country, and continued his Talmudic studies in the city of W≈Çodzimierz (Volodymyr, Volhynia) under Rabbi Joshua Falk. After his marriage to the daughter of Rabbi Samuel of Brest-Litovsk, he became rabbi of the city of Grodno, whence he was called to the rabbinate of Tiktin (Tykocin), and later to that of Przemy≈õl. In 1639 he became rabbi of Lemberg (Lviv, Ukraine) and in the following year he was appointed head of the yeshiva of Krak√≥w. At Krak√≥w Joshua devoted all his time to matters pertaining to the yeshiva, din (law), and religious decisions. As he was a man of wealth, he accepted no salary for the services he rendered to the Jewish community of Krak√≥w. Joshua was one of the most eminent Talmudic analysts of his age. Like many of his learned contemporaries, Joshua had a taste also for the Kabbalah, but he did not allow mystical teachings to influence his halakhic decisions. On account of his extensive erudition in Talmudic literature, the number of his pupils at the yeshivah constantly increased. Many of them became noted rabbis. Among his students was Rav Shabbatai HaKohen (1621‚Äì1662), also known as The Shach, one of the greatest commentators on the Shulchan Aruch.

He is currently concentrating on his Aviator project and has recorded and released an album with Michael Blyth as Michael Michael Blyth and the Wild Braid, getting 4/5 star reviews in Uncut/Mojo/Maverick and Classic Rock. Biography Although having taught himself to play bass at an early age by listening to new wave bands such as The Stranglers and Siouxsie and the Banshees, Wilkinson took an interest in jazz and went on to tour the jazz circuit across the north west of England and North Wales. He gained a college diploma in the genre before deciding that he would never be able to move out of the small clubs he was already playing whilst playing jazz. In 1990, Wilkinson joined Shack with whom he worked on the album Waterpistol. The album however would not be released until 1995, due to problems with the loss of the master tapes and the original record label folding leading to the band splitting up. In 1992, he co-founded Cast with former La's bassist John Power whom fronted the band. Following the band's split in 2001, Wilkinson released a solo album in October 2002 Huxley Pig Part 1 under the guise of Aviator. He also began working as a session musician, playing with artists including Ian McCulloch, Echo & the Bunnymen, Canadian songwriter/vocalist Simon Wilcox and The Hours with whom he took on lead guitar duties. In 2005, Wilkinson rejoined the reformed Shack, who released two albums on Noel Gallagher's record label, Sour Mash. Wilkinson also composes and performs music for TV commercials. In 2010, Wilkinson re-joined the reformed Cast for a UK tour in November 2010. The band went on to release the album Troubled Times in 2012 with drummer Steve Pilgrim replacing Keith O'Neill who was too busy tour managing to participate. Following an abrupt departure from a tour in December 2014, Wilkinson confirmed in March 2015 that he had left the band and wouldn't be working on their forthcoming album or touring with the band, Wilkinson released the long delayed Aviator follow up album Huxley Pig, Part 2 in 2012 and follow up single Desolation Peaks on limited edition 7\\" via Eighties Vinyl Records in 2013.

The entire park lies at an elevation of more than above mean sea level. The National Park was inscribed a World Heritage Site by UNESCO in 1988.Official UNESCO site It was later expanded and renamed as Nanda Devi and Valley of Flowers National Parks in 2005. Within the National Park lies the Nanda Devi Sanctuary, a glacial basin surrounded by a ring of peaks between and high, and drained by the Rishi Ganga through the Rishi Ganga Gorge, a steep almost impassable defile. The National Park is embedded in the sized Nanda Devi Biosphere Reserve, which, in turn, is encompassed in the World Conservation Monitoring Centre Kala, Chandra Prakash 2005.

Best time to visit Nanda Devi National Park is from May to October.Nanda Devi National Park - HillTaxi.com History The first recorded attempt to explore the sanctuary was in 1883 by W. W. Graham, who could proceed only up to Rishi Ganga. Other attempts by explorers in 1870, (T. G. Longstaff) 1926, 1927 and 1932 (Hugh Ruttledge) did not fetch fruitful results. Eric Shipton and H. W. Tilman entered the inner sanctuary through Rishi Ganga in 1934, thus opening the extensive exploration in the sanctuary. In 1939, the area was declared as a game sanctuary. Layout of the Nanda Devi Sanctuary Contour map of the Nanda Devi Sanctuary The Nanda Devi Sanctuary within the National Park can be divided into two parts, Inner and Outer. Together, they are surrounded by the main sanctuary wall, which forms a roughly square outline, with high, continuous ridges on the north, east and south sides. On the west side, less high but still imposing ridges drop from the north and south toward the Rishi Ganga Gorge, which drains the sanctuary towards the west.Garhwal-Himalaya-Ost, 1:150,000 scale topographic map, prepared in 1992 by Ernst Huber for the Swiss Foundation for Alpine Research, based on maps of the Survey of India. It is in the extreme northern part if india on the countries border with China. it takes up a great deal of mountain space in Uttarakhand. The Inner Sanctuary occupies roughly the eastern two-thirds of the total area, and contains Nanda Devi itself and the two major glaciers flanking the peak, the Uttari (north) Rishi Glacier and the Dakshini (south) Rishi Glacier. These are fed by the smaller Uttari Nanda Devi and Dakshini Nanda Devi Glaciers respectively. This region was already inhabited by the aryanic, Mongolian and Himalayan indigenous peoples as per vedas and natural history but the first recorded entry of the British into the Inner Sanctuary was by Eric Shipton and H. W. Tilman in 1934, via the Rishi Gorge.H. W. Tilman, The Ascent of Nanda Devi, Cambridge University Press, 1937. Reprinted in The Seven Mountain-Travel Books, The Mountaineers, Seattle, 2003, . The Outer Sanctuary occupies the western third of the total sanctuary, and is separated from the Inner Sanctuary by high ridges, through which flows the Rishi Ganga. It is split in two by the Rishi Ganga; on the north side lies the Ramani Glacier, flowing down from the slopes of Dunagiri and Changabang, and on the south lies the Trisul Glacier, flowing from the peak of the same name. This portion of the sanctuary is accessible to the outside (though requiring the crossing of a pass). The first serious climbing expedition to pass through the Outer Sanctuary was that of T. G. Longstaff, who climbed Trisul I in 1907 via the eponymous glacier.  Fauna  Common larger mammals are Himalayan musk deer, mainland serow and Himalayan tahr. Goral are not found within, but in the vicinity of the park. Carnivores are represented by snow leopard, Himalayan black bear and perhaps also brown bear. Langurs are found within the park, whereas rhesus macaque are known to occur in the neighboring areas of the park. In a scientific expedition in 1993, a total of 114 bird species was recognized.  Flora  Nanda Devi National Park is home to a wide variety of flora. Some 312 floral species that include 17 rare species have been found here. Fir, birch, rhododendron and juniper are the main flora. Vegetation is scarce In the inner sanctuary due to the dryness of the conditions. One will not find vegetation near Nanda Devi Glacier. Ramani, alpine, prone mosses and lichens are other notable floral species found in Nanda Devi National Park. Named peaks of the park and environs=Within the sanctuary Nanda Devi peak Apart from Nanda Devi, the following peaks lie on ridges dividing the Inner and Outer Sanctuary areas. * Nanda Devi: * Devistan I, II: , * Rishi Kot: On the sanctuary wall These peaks are listed in clockwise order, starting from just north of the Rishi Gorge.

Before the advent of spy satellites much of the clandestine intelligence gathering relied on ground based sensors. The Chinese missile testing facility was north of the Himalayan range which was a big hurdle in picking missile telemetry signals. CIA was looking for a Himalayan peak high enough to secure a direct line of sight to the Chinese missile testing zone. Together with the Intelligence Bureau of India, they planned a secret mission to install a nuclear powered listening device on top of the peak of Nanda Devi. A joint team of CIA hired US mountaineers together with Indian contingent from the defense forces were detailed to carry out the secret mission.https://www.wired.com/2013/04/cia- himalayan-spies/ By that time the mountaineering season was concluding and the mission met with adverse climatic conditions. They left behind the plutonium fueled device with the intention of renewing their attempt during the next year's climbing season. The follow-up Indian expedition during the next season found the device missing from where it was anchored. Probably fell down due to rock fall and slid towards the glaciers carrying its plutonium with it. All the follow-up secret expeditions launched to retrieve the device met with failure. In 2018 it was reported that the Tourism Minister of Uttarakhand State Mr. Satpal Maharaj met the Prime Minister of India to express his apprehensions that the atomic device that had gone missing over 50 years ago might be polluting waters of the Ganges.https://economictimes.indiatimes.com/news/defence/james-bond-in-the- himalayas-the-buried-secret-of-nanda-devi/articleshow/65350186.cms See also * Indian Council of Forestry Research and Education ReferencesExternal links * Biodiversity Heritage Library Category:National parks in Uttarakhand Category:Protected areas established in 1982 Category:World Heritage Sites in India Category:1982 establishments in India ","title":"Nanda Devi National Park"},{"id":"4128720","text":"In mathematics, more specifically in ring theory, a cyclic module or monogenous module is a module over a ring that is generated by one element.

Their chemical structure is defined by a 16-membered lactone ring scaffold. Bafilomycins exhibit a wide range of biological activity, including anti-tumor, anti-parasitic, immunosuppressant and anti- fungal activity. The most used bafilomycin is bafilomycin A1, a potent inhibitor of cellular autophagy. Bafilomycins have also been found to act as ionophores, transporting potassium K+ across biological membranes and leading to mitochondrial damage and cell death. Bafilomycin A1 specifically targets the vacuolar-type H+ -ATPase (V-ATPase) enzyme, a membrane spanning proton pump that acidifies either the extracellular environment or intracellular organelles such as the lysosome. At higher micromolar concentrations, Bafilomycin A1 also acts on P-type ATPases, which have a phosphorylated transitional state. Bafilomycin A1 serves as an important tool compound in many in vitro research applications; however, its clinical use is limited by a substantial toxicity profile.  Discovery & History  Bafilomycin A1, B1 and C1 were first isolated from Streptomyces griseus in 1983. During a screen seeking to identify microbial secondary metabolites whose activity mimicked that of two cardiac glycosides, bafilomycin C1 was identified as an inhibitor of P-ATPase with a ki of 11 ŒºM. Bafilomycin C1 was found to have activity against Caenorhabditis elegans, ticks, and tapeworms, in addition to stimulating the release of Œ≥-aminobutyruc acid (GABA) from rat synaptosomes. Independently, bafilomycin A1 and other derivatives were isolated from S. griseus and shown to have antibiotic activity against some yeast, Gram- positive bacteria and fungi. Bafilomycin A1 was also shown to have an anti- proliferative effect on concanavalin-A-stimulated T cells. However, its high toxicity has prevented use in clinical trials. Two years later, bafilomycins D and E were also isolated from S. griseus. In 2010, 9-hydroxy-bafilomycin D, 29-hydroxy-bafilomycin D and a number of other bafilomycins were identified from the endophytic microorganism Streptomyces sp. YIM56209. From 2004-2011, bafilomycins F-K were isolated from other Streptomyces sp. As one of the first identified and most commonly used, bafilomycin A1 is of particular importance, especially as its structure serves as the core of all other bafilomycins. With its large structure, bafilomycin has multiple chiral centers and functional groups, which makes modifying its structure difficult, a task that has been attempted to reduce the compound's associated toxicity. Chemical structures of several Bafilomycin compounds.  Target of Bafilomycin  Depiction of the molecular subunits that make up V-ATPase, the main target of Bafilomycin A1. Attribution: NOchotny at the English language Wikipedia. Within the cell, bafilomycin A1 specifically interacts with the proton pump V-ATPase. This large protein depends on Adenosine triphosphate (ATP) hydrolysis to pump protons across a biological membrane. When bafilomycin and other inhibitors of V-ATPase, such as concanamycin, were first discovered in the 1980s they were used to establish the presence of V-ATPase in specialized cells types and tissues, characterizing the proton pump's distribution. Structurally, V-ATPase consists of 13 distinct subunits that together make up the membrane spanning Vo and cytosolic V1 domains of the enzyme. The V1 domain in the cytosol is made up of subunits A through H whereas the Vo domain is made up of subunits a, d, e, c, and c\\".  V-ATPase Mechanism of Action  In order to move protons across the membrane, a proton first enters subunit a within the Vo domain through a cytoplasmic hemichannel. This allows conserved glutamic acid residues within the proteolipid ring of Vo subunits c and c\\" to become protonated. Adenosine triphosphate (ATP) is then hydrolyzed by the V1 domain of the enzyme, enabling both the rotation of the central stalk of the pump, made up of subunits D, F and d, and the rotation of the proteolipid ring. This rotation puts the protonated glutamic acid residues in contact with a luminal hemichannel located in subunit a. Within subunit a, arginine residues serve to stabilize the deprotonated form of glutamic acid and allow the release of their protons. This rotation and proton transfer brings the protons through the pump and across the membrane.  Bafilomycin- V-ATPase Interaction  For more than ten years after bafilomycin was discovered as a V-ATPase inhibitor, the site of its interaction with V-ATPase was unclear. Beginning studies used the chromaffine granule V-ATPase to suggest that bafilomycin interacted with the Vo domain. Two further studies confirmed this hypothesis using V-ATPase from bovine clathrin coated vesicles. They showed that application of bafilomycin inhibited proton flow through Vo and that this inhibition could be overcome by adding back the Vo domain to the coated vesicles. Further narrowing bafilomycin's interaction site, they found that specific addition of just Vo subunit a could restore function. This suggested bafilomycin interacted specifically with subunit a of V-ATPase; however, another study contradicted this finding. A group found that by using a bafilomycin affinity chromatography column V-ATPase could be purified, and that addition of DCCD, an inhibitor of the Vo c subunit, drastically decreased bafilomycin's affinity for V-ATPase. This suggested that bafilomycin interacted more strongly with subunit c of the Vo domain. Two further studies then confirmed this interaction using radiolabeling and protein crystallization. It was further found, however, that amino acid changes within subunit a could also lower V-ATPase-Bafilomycin interaction, indicating a minor role of subunit a in bafilomycin binding in addition to subunit c. Overall, bafilomycin binds with nanomolar efficiency to the Vo c subunit of the V-ATPase complex. Specifically, bafilomycin interacts with the proteolipid ring of Vo, inhibiting proton translocation. Although the interaction between bafilomycin and V-ATPase is not covalent, its low dissociation constant of about 10 nM describes the strength of its interaction and can make the effects of bafilomycin difficult to reverse. = V-ATPase Localization and Function = V-ATPase is ubiquitous in mammalian cells and plays an important role in many cellular processes. It is localized to the trans-golgi network and the cellular organelles that are derived from it, including lysosomes, secretory vesicles and endosomes. V-ATPase can also be found within the plasma membrane. In mammals, location of the V-ATPase can be linked to the specific isoform of subunit a that the complex has. Isoforms a1 and a2 target V-ATPase intracellularly, to synaptic vesicles and endosomes respectively. Subunits a3 and a4, however, mediate V-ATPase localization to the plasma membrane in osteoclasts (a3) and renal intercalated cells (a4). If located at the lysosomal membrane, this results in the acidification of the lysosome as lumenal pH is lowered, enabling activity of lysosomal hydrolases. When V-ATPase is located at the plasma membrane, proton extrusion through the pump causes the acidification of the extracellular space, which is utilized by specialized cells such as osteoclasts, epididymal clear cells, and renal epithelial intercalated cells.  Intracellular Function  As it promotes the acidification of lysosomes, endosomes, and secretory vesicles, V-ATPase contributes to processes including: * vesicular/protein trafficking * receptor recycling * endocytosis * protein degradation * autophagy * cell signaling With its role in lysosomal acidification, V-ATPase is also crucial in driving the transport of ions and small molecules into the cytoplasm, particularly calcium and amino acids. Additionally, its acidification of endosomes is critical in receptor endocytosis as low pH tends to drive ligand release as well as receptor cleavage which contributes to signaling events, such as through the release of the intracellular domain of Notch.  Plasma Membrane Function  When at the plasma membrane, V-ATPase function is critical in the acidification of the extracellular environment, which is seen with osteoclasts and epidiymal clear cells. When present at the plasma membrane in renal epithelial intercalated cells, V-ATPase is important for acid secretion, which contributes to the acidification of urine. In response to reduced plasma pH, increased levels of V-ATPase are typically trafficked to the plasma membrane in these cells by phosphorylation of the pump by Protein Kinase A (PKA). = V-ATPase in Disease = Clinically, dysfunction of V-ATPase has been correlated with several diseases in humans. Some of these diseases include male infertility, osteopetrosis, and renal acidosis. Additionally, V-ATPase can be found at the plasma membrane of some invasive cancer cells including breast, prostate and liver cancer, among others. In human lung cancer samples, V-ATPase expression was correlated with drug resistance. A large number of V-ATPase subunit mutations have also been identified in a number of cancers, including follicular lymphomas.  Cellular Action of Bafilomycin  As the target of Bafilomycin V-ATPase, is involved in many aspects of cellular function, Bafilomycin treatment greatly alters cellular processes.  Inhibition of Autophagy  Bafilomycin A1 is most known for its use as an autophagy inhibitor. Autophagy is the process by which the cell degrades its own organelles and some proteins through the formation of autophagosomes. Autophagosomes then fuse with lysosomes facilitating the degradation of engulfed cargo by lysosomal proteases. This process is critical in maintaining the cell's store of amino acids and other nutrients during times of nutrient deprivation or other metabolic stresses. Bafilomycin interferes with this process by inhibiting the acidification of the lysosome through its interaction with V-ATPase. Lack of lysosomal acidification prevents the activity of lysosomal proteases like cathepsins so that engulfed cargo can no longer be degraded. Schematic representing the formation of an autolysosome and the points of intervention of bafilomycin A1. Since V-ATPase is widely distributed within the cell, Bafilomycin is only specific as an autophagy inhibitor for a short amount of time. Other effects are seen outside this short window, including interference in the trafficking of endosomes and proteasomal inhibition. In addition to blocking the acidification of the lysosome, Bafilomycin has been reported to block the fusion of autophagosomes with lysosomes. This was initially found in a paper by Yamamoto, et al. in which the authors used bafilomycin A1 to treat rat hepatoma H-4-II-E cells. By electron microscopy, they saw a blockage of autophagosome-lysosome fusion after using bafilomycin at a concentration of 100 nM for 1 hour. This has been confirmed by other studies, particularly two that found decreased colocalization of mitochondria and lysosomes by fluorescence microscopy following a 12-24 hour treatment with 100 or 400 nM Bafilomycin. However, further studies have failed to see this inhibition of fusion with similar bafilomycin treatments. These contradictory results have been explained by time differences among treatments as well as use of different cell lines. The effect of Bafilomycin on autophagosome-lysosome fusion is complex and time dependent in each cell line. In neurons, an increase in the autophagosome marker LC3-II has been seen with Bafilomycin treatment. This occurs as autophagosomes fail to fuse with lysosomes, which normally stimulates the degradation of LC3-II.  Induction of apoptosis  In PC12 cells, bafilomycin was found to induce apoptosis, or programmed cell death. Additionally, in some cell lines it has been found to disrupt the electrochemical gradient of the mitochondria and induce the release of cytochrome c, which is an initiator of apoptosis. Bafilomycin has also been shown to induce both inhibition of autophagy and subsequent induction of apoptosis in osteosarcoma cells as well as other cancer cell lines.  K+ transport  Bafilomycin acts as an ionophore, meaning it can transfer K+ ions across biological membranes. Typically, the mitochondrial inner membrane is not permeable to K+ and maintains a set electrochemical gradient. In excitable cells, mitochondria can contain a K+ channel that, when opened, can cause mitochondrial stress by inducing mitochondrial swelling, changing the electrochemical gradient, and stimulating respiration. Bafilomycin A1 treatment can induce mitochondrial swelling in the presence of K+ ions, stimulate the oxidation of pyrimidine nucleotides and uncouple oxidative phosphorylation. Ascending concentrations of bafilomycin were found to linearly increase the amount of K+ that traversed the mitochondrial membrane, confirming it acts as an ionophore. Compared to other ionophores, however, bafilomycin has a low affinity for K+.  Research Applications = Anti- tumorigenic  In many cancers, it has been found that various subunits of V-ATPase are upregulated. Upregulation of these subunits appears to be correlated with increased tumor cell metastasis and reduced clinical outcome. Bafilomycin application has been shown to reduce cell growth in various cancer cell lines across multiple cancer types by induction of apoptosis. Additionally, in vitro bafilomycin's anti-proliferative effect appears to be specific to cancer cells over normal cells, which is seen with selective inhibition of hepatoblastoma cell growth compared to healthy hepatocytes. The mechanism by which bafilomycin causes this cancer specific anti-proliferative effect is multifactorial. In addition to the induction of caspase-dependent apoptosis through the mitochondrial pathway, bafilomycin also causes increased levels of reactive oxygen species and increased expression of HIF1alpha. These effects suggest that inhibition of V-ATPase with bafilomycin can induce a cellular stress response, including autophagy and eventual apoptosis. These somewhat contradictory effects of V-ATPase inhibition in terms of inhibition or induction of apoptosis demonstrate that bafilomycin's function is critically dependent on cellular context, and can mediate either a pro- survival or pro-death phenotype. In vivo bafilomycin reduced average tumor volume in MCF-7 and MDA-MB-231 xenograft mouse models by 50% and did not show toxic effects at a dosing of 1 mg/kg. Additionally, when combined with sorafenib, bafilomycin also caused tumor regression in MDA-MB-231 xenograft mice. In a HepG2 orthotropic HCC xenograft model in nude mice, bafilomycin prevented tumor growth. V-ATPase dysregulation is thought to play a role in resistance to cancer therapies, as aberrant acidification of the extracellular environment can protonate chemotherapeutics, preventing their entry into the cell. It is unclear if\` V-ATPase dysregulation is a direct cause of associated poor clinical outcome or if its dysregulation primarily effects the response to treatment. Although, treatment with bafilomycin and cisplatin had a synergistic effect on cancer cell cytotoxicity.  Anti-fungal  Bafilomycins have been shown to inhibit plasma membrane ATPase (P-ATPase) as well as the ATP-binding cassette (ABC) transporters. These transporters are identified as good anti-fungal targets as they render organisms unable to cope with cation stress. When Cryptococcus neoformans was treated with bafilomycin, growth inhibition was observed. Bafilomycin has also been used in C. neoformans in conjunction with calcineurin inhibitor FK506, displaying synergistic anti-fungal activity.  Anti-parasitic  Bafilomycin has been shown to be active against Plasmodium falciparum, the causative agent of malaria. Upon infection of red blood cells, P. falciparum exports a membrane network into the red blood cell cytoplasm and also inserts several of its own proteins into the host membrane, including its own V-ATPase. This proton pump has a role in maintaining the intracellular pH of the infected red blood cell and facilitating the uptake of small metabolites at equilibrium. Treatment of the parasitized red blood cell with bafilomycin prevents the extracellular acidification, causing a dip in intracellular pH around the malarial parasite.  Immunosuppressant  The inflammatory myopathy Inclusion Body Myositis (IBM) is relatively common in patients over 50 years of age and involves over activation of autophagic flux. In this condition, increased autophagy results in an increase in protein degradation and therefore an increase in the presentation of antigenic peptides in muscles. This can cause over-activation of immune cells. Treatment with bafilomycin can prevent the acidification of lysosomes and therefore autophagy, decreasing the number of antigenic peptides digested and displayed to the immune system. In Lupus patients, the autophagy pathway has been found to be altered in both B and T cells. Particularly, more autophagic vacuoles were seen in T cells as well as increased LC3-11 staining for autophagosomes, indicating increased autophagy. Increased autophagy can also be seen in na√Øve patient B cell subsets. Bafilomycin A1 treatment lowered the differentiation of plasmablasts and decreased their survival.  Clearance of protein aggregates in neurodegenerative diseases  Neurodegenerative diseases typically display elevated levels of protein aggregates within the cell that contribute to dysfunction of neurons and eventual neuronal death. As a method of protein degradation within the cell, autophagy can traffic these protein aggregates to be degraded in the lysosome. Although it is unclear the exact role continuous autophagy, or autophagic flux, plays in neuronal homeostasis and disease states, it has been shown that autophagic dysfunction can be seen in neurodegenerative diseases. Bafilomycin is commonly used to study this autophagic flux in neurons, among other cell types. To do this, neurons are first put into nutrient rich conditions then into nutrient starved conditions to stimulate autophagy. Bafilomycin is co- administered in the condition of nutrient stress so that while autophagy is stimulated, bafilomycin blocks its final stage of autophagosome-lysosomal fusion resulting in the accumulation of autophagosomes. Levels of autophagy related proteins associated with autophagosomes, such as LC3, can then be monitored to determine the level of autophagosome formation induced by nutrient deprivation.  In vitro Drug Interactions = Lysosomotropic Drugs  Some cationic drugs, such as chloroquine and sertraline, are known as lysosomotropic drugs. These drugs are weak bases that become protonated in the acidic environment of the lysosome. This traps the otherwise non- protonated compound within the lysosome, as protonation prevents its passage back across the lipid membrane of the organelle. This phenomenon is known as ion trapping. Trapping of the cationic compound also draws water into the lysosome through an osmotic effect, which can sometimes lead to vacuolization seen in in vitro cultured cells. Diagram showing how protonation of weak bases like chloroquine in the acidic environment of the lysosome results in ion trapping, or accumulation of the weak base in the lysosome. Bafilomycin inhibits this trapping through its action on V-ATPase, which normally acidifies the lysosome. When one of these drugs is co-applied to cells with bafilomycin A1, the action of bafilomycin A1 prevents the acidification of the lysosome, therefore preventing the phenomenon of ion trapping in this compartment. As the lysosome cannot acidify, lysosomotropic drugs do not become protonated and subsequently trapped in the lysosome in the presence of bafilomycin. Additionally, when cells are preloaded with lysosomotropic drugs in vitro, then treated with bafilomycin, bafilomycin acts to release the cationic compound from its accumulation in the lysosome. Pretreating cells with bafilomycin before administration of a cationic drug can alter the kinetics of the cationic compound. In a rabbit contractility assay, bafilomycin was used to pre-treat isolated rabbit aorta. The lipophilic agent xylometazoline, an alpha-adrenoreceptor agonist, displayed an increased effect when administered after bafilomycin treatment. With bafilomycin, faster contraction and relaxation of the aorta was seen as bafilomycin prevented the ion trapping of xylometazoline in the lysosome. Without pre-treatment with bafilomycin, the functional V-ATPase causes the lysosome to become a reservoir for xylometazoline, slowing its effect on contractility.  Chloroquine  As a lysosomotroic drug, chloroquine typically accumulates in the lysosome disrupting their degradative function, inhibiting autophagy, and inducing apoptosis through Bax-dependent mechanisms. However, in cultured cerebellar granule neurons (CGNs) low treatment with Bafillomycin of 1 nM decreased chloroquine induced apoptosis without affecting chloroquine inhibition of autophagy. The exact mechanism of this protection is unknown, although it is hypothesized to lie downstream of autophagosome-lysosome fusion yet upstream of Bax induction of apoptosis.  Chemotherapeutics  Bafilomycin has been shown to potentiate the effect of taxol in decreasing Matrix Metalloprotease (MMP) levels by depressing Bcl-xL's mitochondrial protective role. Additionally, within cisplatin resistant cells, V-ATPase expression was found to be increased, and co-treatment of bafilomycin with cisplatin sensitized these cells to cisplatin-induced cytotoxicity. Bafilomycin has also been shown to increase the efficacy of EGFR inhibitors in anti-cancer applications.

Generally, in the radiopharmaceutical industry, enriched water () is bombarded with hydrogen ions in either a cyclotron or linear accelerator, creating fluorine-18. This is then synthesized into FDG and injected into a patient. It can also be used to make an extremely heavy version of water when combined with tritium (hydrogen-3): or . This compound has a density almost 30% greater than that of natural water The accurate measurements of rely on proper procedures of analysis, sample preparation and storage. Paleoclimatology In ice cores, mainly Arctic and Antarctic, the ratio of to (known as Œ¥) can be used to determine the temperature of precipitation through time. Assuming that atmospheric circulation and elevation has not changed significantly over the poles, the temperature of ice formation can be calculated as equilibrium fractionation between phases of water that is known for different temperatures. Water molecules are also subject to Rayleigh fractionation as atmospheric water moves from the equator poleward which results in progressive depletion of , or lower Œ¥ values. In the 1950s, Harold Urey performed an experiment in which he mixed both normal water and water with oxygen-18 in a barrel, and then partially froze the barrel's contents. The ratio / (Œ¥) can also be used to determine paleothermometry in certain types of fossils. The fossils in question have to show progressive growth in the animal or plant that the fossil represents. The fossil material used is generally calcite or aragonite, however oxygen isotope paleothermometry has also been done of phosphatic fossils using SHRIMP. For example, seasonal temperature variations may be determined from a single sea shell from a scallop. As the scallop grows, an extension is seen on the surface of the shell. Each growth band can be measured, and a calculation is used to determine the probable sea water temperature in comparison to each growth. The equation for this is: :T = A + B \\\\cdot \\\\left( \\\\left( \\\\delta \\\\ce{^{18}O} \\\\right) \\\\overbrace\\\\ce{CaCO3}^\\\\text{calcite} - \\\\left( \\\\delta \\\\ce{^{18}O} \\\\right) \\\\overbrace\\\\ce{H2O}^\\\\text{water} \\\\right) Where T is temperature in Celsius and A and B are constants. For determination of ocean temperatures over geologic time, multiple fossils of the same species in different stratigraphic layers would be measured, and the difference between them would indicate long term changes. Plant physiology In the study of plants' photorespiration, the labeling of atmosphere by oxygen-18 allows us to measure the oxygen uptake by the photorespiration pathway. Labeling by gives the unidirectional flux of uptake, while there is a net photosynthetic evolution. It was demonstrated that, under preindustrial atmosphere, most plants reabsorb, by photorespiration, half of the oxygen produced by photosynthesis. Then, the yield of photosynthesis was halved by the presence of oxygen in atmosphere. 18F production Fluorine-18 is usually produced by irradiation of 18O-enriched water (H218O) with high-energy (about 18 MeV) protons prepared in a cyclotron or a linear accelerator, yielding an aqueous solution of 18F fluoride. This solution is then used for rapid synthesis of a labeled molecule, often with the fluorine atom replacing a hydroxyl group. The labeled molecules or radiopharmaceuticals have to be synthetized after the radiofluorine is prepared, as the high energy proton radiation would destroy the molecules. Large amounts of oxygen-18 enriched water are used in positron emission tomography centers, for on-site production of 18F-labeled fludeoxyglucose (FDG). An example of the production cycle is a 90-minute irradiation of 2 milliliters of 18O-enriched water in a titanium cell, through a 25 Œºm thick window made of Havar (a cobalt alloy) foil, with a proton beam having an energy of 17.5 MeV and a beam current of 30 microamperes. The irradiated water has to be purified before another irradiation, to remove organic contaminants, traces of tritium produced by a 18O(p,t)16O reaction, and ions leached from the target cell and sputtered from the Havar foil.http://www.iaea.org/inis/collection/NCLCollectionStore/_Public/46/048/46048804.pdf See also * Willi Dansgaard ‚Äì a paleoclimatologist * Isotopes of oxygen * Paleothermometry * P√¢t√© de Foie Gras (short story) * Œî18O *Global meteoric water line References Category:Environmental isotopes Category:Isotopes of oxygen ","title":"Oxygen-18"},{"id":"4128751","text":"Isometheptene (usually as isometheptene mucate) is a sympathomimetic amine sometimes used in the treatment of migraines and tension headaches due to its vasoconstricting properties; that is, it causes constriction (narrowing) of blood vessels (arteries and veins).

Location and description The ecoregion covers and encompasses the alluvial plain of the upper Brahmaputra River as it moves westward through India's Assam state (with small parts of the ecoregion in the states of Arunachal Pradesh and Nagaland and also south Bhutan). The valley lies between the Himalayas to the north and the Lushai hills to the south and when the river floods during the June to September monsoon it brings up to 300 cm of water onto the plain carrying rich soils to create a fertile environment which has been extensively farmed for thousands of years. Other rivers that water the plains as well as the Brahmaputra include the Manas and the Subansiri. Flora/plants The extensive farming has meant that the original semi- evergreen forest now exists only in patches. Typical canopy trees include the evergreen Syzygium, Cinnamomum and Magnoliaceae along with deciduous Terminalia myriocarpa, Terminalia citrina, Terminalia tomentosa, Tetrameles species. Understory trees and shrubs include the laurels Phoebe, Machilus, and Actinodaphne, Polyalthias, Aphanamixis, and cultivated Mesua ferrea and species of mahogany, cashews, nutmegs and magnolias, with bamboos such as Bambusa arundinaria and Melocanna bambusoides. Fauna/animals Despite the centuries of human clearance and exploitation, the forests and grasslands along the river remain a habitat for a variety of wildlife including tiger (Panthera tigris), clouded leopard (Pardofelis nebulosa), capped langur, (Semnopithecus pileatus), gaur (Bos gaurus), barasingha deer (Cervus duvaucelii), sloth bear (Melursus ursinus), wild water buffalo (Bubalus arnee), India's largest population of Asian elephants (Elephas maximus) and the world's largest population of Indian rhinoceros, while Asian black bears live in the higher slopes of the valley sides. Most of these mammals are threatened or endangered species. The Brahmaputra is a natural barrier to the migration of much wildlife and many species, such as the pygmy hog, hispid hare, or the Malayan sun bear, pig-tailed macaque, golden langur, stump-tailed macaque, western hoolock gibbon live on one side of the river only. The area is a meeting point of species of Indian and Malayan origin. The endemic mammals of the valley are the pygmy hog and the hispid hare, both of which inhabit the grasslands of the riverbanks. The valley is home to rich bird life with 370 species of which two are endemic, the Manipur bush quail (Perdicula manipurensis) and the marsh babbler (Pellorneum palustre) and one, the Bengal florican is very rare. Woodland birds like kalij pheasant, great hornbill, rufous necked hornbill, brown hornbill, Oriental pied hornbill, grey hornbill, peacock pheasant and tragopan are quite common. Threats and preservation This area has been densely populated for centuries and most of the valley has been and still are used for agriculture but some blocks of natural habitat do remain, mainly in national parks the largest of which are Manas, Dibru- Saikhowa and Kaziranga National Parks in India. In Bhutan, these areas are part of Royal Manas National Park. Protected areas In 1997, the World Wildlife Fund identified twelve protected areas in the ecoregion, with a combined area of approximately 2,560 km2, that include 5% of the ecoregion's area.Wikramanayake, Eric; Eric Dinerstein; Colby J.

Built by the (now defunct) Sandock Austral shipyard in Durban, it is the largest and most sophisticated warship to have been built in South Africa.  Design  The design and shortcomings of heavily influenced the designers of Drakensberg. Drakensberg is able to carry 5,500 tons of diesel fuel, 210 tons of fresh water, 100 tons of dry provisions, over 30 tons of frozen food, 230 tons of containerized cargo or 1,000 tons of palletized and general cargo. The loading and offloading of this cargo is made possible with one 20-ton crane, four 2-ton cranes and a 5-ton hoist, assisted by two lifts of 2.5 and 7.5 tons respectively. Replenishment at sea (RAS) is from two abeam positions or from the RAS deck astern, with the ability to pump 40 tons of fuel per hour and 15 tons of fresh water per hour. In addition, an on-board plant enables the ship to produce of fresh water from sea water daily. The ship carries two rigid-hulled inflatable boats (RHIB) called 'Stingrays' for small-craft duties, as well as two Delta-80 LCUs for limited amphibious use.  Operational history  In 1988 Drakensberg set sail along with SAS Frans Erasmus for Chile on 15 February, returning to South Africa on 15 April. This was followed two years later in May 1990, when Drakensberg accompanied the strike craft SAS Jan Smuts and Hendrik Mentz on a voyage to Keelung in the Republic of China (Taiwan), without stopping at any ports along the way (a procedure necessitated by South Africa's political isolation at the time). This was the first time since 1945 that a South African naval vessel had \\"shown the flag\\" in the Far East; it also provided an opportunity for joint exercises with the Taiwanese Navy. Under Operation Pullen in 1990, Drakensberg became the first South African naval vessel to visit the then-Zaire in over 30 years, laying the groundwork for a series of additional visits to African nations, signifying South Africa's gradual return from isolation. The next year, it set sail on a humanitarian relief mission, offloading 630 tons of supplies in Chittagong, Bangladesh, and 35 tons of supplies in Mersin, Turkey. In 1992, it became the first SAN vessel to proceed further south than 54 degrees south latitude, in a mission to assist the damaged S. A. Agulhas. Operation Narsau in May 1994, followed South Africa's first fully democratic elections and the election of Nelson Mandela. In three months, it visited Lisbon, Rosyth, Copenhagen, Rotterdam, Zeebrugge, Rouen, London, Cadiz, S√£o Tom√© and Pr√≠ncipe, Bioko Island and Gabon in the process becoming the first SAN vessel to visit Denmark and Belgium. While not quite living up to the high standards set by the 1994 voyage, the 1995 voyage to Abu Dhabi, Karachi, Mumbai and Muscat is also notable for its diversity in destinations. SAS Drakensberg, Buenos Aires (2010) In 1996, Drakensberg became the first SAN vessel in over 20 years to visit the United States, when it called at the ports of Norfolk, Newport and New York City, which followed a naval exercise with over 25 other vessels at the US Navy's base at Roosevelt Roads, Puerto Rico. Three years later Drakensberg embarked on another long- range voyage, this time to Brazil, Argentina and Uruguay to partake in the Atlasur IV naval manoeuvres. In 2006, Drakensberg was sent to Antwerpen Belgium by President Thabo Mbeki to collect a giant rotor to replace the damaged rotor at Koeberg nuclear power station. In 2011, Drakensberg was sent to West Africa, officially for training purposes. The deployment drew criticism from the Economic Community of West African States (ECOWAS), who claimed that the deployment was related to ongoing conflict in Cote d'Ivoire. In 2020, the Drakensberg engaged in counter-piracy patrols off the coast of Mozambique.

Macaulay made his Arsenal debut against Sunderland on 23 August 1947 and in his first season with the Gunners, he played 40 league matches and won a First Division Championship medal. He continued to play for Arsenal as a near ever-present figure for the next two seasons, although he missed out on Arsenal's 1950 FA Cup triumph after manager Tom Whittaker preferred fellow Scot Alex Forbes in the final. Macaulay left Arsenal for Fulham in June 1950; in all he made 108 appearances in three seasons, scoring one goal. He also won six more caps for Scotland while at Arsenal, bringing his total tally to seven. He spent three seasons at Fulham, though he could not save them from relegation to Division Two in 1951‚Äì52. He moved to Guildford City after that, to become the club's player-manager. Managerial career In 1957 he succeeded Tom Parker as manager of Norwich City, where he led the Third Division side to the FA Cup semi-finals in 1959 in one of the most famous FA Cup runs of all time, and promotion to the Second Division the following year. In 1961 he moved on to West Bromwich Albion, though the Baggies did little under his two-year reign, instead enjoying mid- table obscurity. Macaulay finished his managerial career at Brighton & Hove Albion between 1963 and 1968, leading the club to promotion from the Fourth Division in 1965. After that, he left football management completely, and later worked as a traffic warden. He died in June 1993, aged 77.

Dynamin is part of the \\"dynamin superfamily\\", which includes classical dynamins, dynamin-like proteins, Mx proteins, OPA, mitofusins, and GBPs. Members of the dynamin family are principally involved in the scission of newly formed vesicles from the membrane of one cellular compartment and their targeting to, and fusion with, another compartment, both at the cell surface (particularly caveolae internalization) as well as at the Golgi apparatus.Hinshaw, J. \\"Research statement, Jenny E. Hinshaw, Ph.D.\\" National Institute of Diabetes & Digestive & Kidney Diseases, Laboratory of Cell Biochemistry and Biology. Accessed 19 March 2013. Dynamin family members also play a role in many processes including division of organelles, cytokinesis and microbial pathogen resistance.  Structure  alt= Dynamin itself is a 96 kDa enzyme, and was first isolated when researchers were attempting to isolate new microtubule-based motors from the bovine brain. Dynamin has been extensively studied in the context of clathrin-coated vesicle budding from the cell membrane. Beginning from the N-terminus, Dynamin consists of a GTPase domain connected to a helical stalk domain via a flexible neck region containing a Bundle Signalling Element and GTPase Effector Domain. At the opposite end of the stalk domain is a loop that links to a membrane-binding Pleckstrin homology domain. The protein strand then loops back towards the GTPase domain and terminates with a Proline Rich Domain that binds to the Src Homology domains of many proteins.  Function  During clathrin-mediated endocytosis, the cell membrane invaginates to form a budding vesicle. Dynamin binds to and assembles around the neck of the endocytic vesicle, forming a helical polymer arranged such that the GTPase domains dimerize in an asymmetric manner across helical rungs. The polymer constricts the underlying membrane upon GTP binding and hydrolysis via conformational changes emanating from the flexible neck region that alters the overall helical symmetry. Constriction around the vesicle neck leads to the formation of a hemi-fission membrane state that ultimately results in membrane scission. Constriction may be in part the result of the twisting activity of dynamin, which makes dynamin the only molecular motor known to have a twisting activity. Types In mammals, three different dynamin genes have been identified with key sequence differences in their Pleckstrin homology domains leading to differences in the recognition of lipid membranes: * Dynamin I is expressed in neurons and neuroendocrine cells * Dynamin II is expressed in most cell types * Dynamin III is strongly expressed in the testis, but is also present in heart, brain, and lung tissue. Disease implications Mutations in Dynamin II have been found to cause dominant intermediate Charcot-Marie-Tooth disease. Epileptic encephalopathy‚Äìcausing de novo mutations in dynamin have been suggested to cause dysfunction of vesicle scission during synaptic vesicle endocytosis.

As well as the horror theme, various parts also have pure humour elements, and it is considered a horror/comedy by some newspapers that rated it. The film takes place in a small town in northern Sweden during midwinter, making the environment perfect for vampires‚Äîbecause there are no sunny hours during the dark and cold Nordic winter days.  Plot  During World War II in Ukraine, 1944, the remnants of the 5th SS Panzer Division Wiking are fleeing from The Red Army. They seek shelter in an abandoned cabin, but as darkness falls they are attacked by vampires inhabiting a hidden crypt under the cabin. In present-day Sweden, doctor Annika and her teenage daughter Saga are moving to a town in Lappland, so Annika can work close to the famous geneticist Gerhard Beckert. The polar night has begun, with one month until dawn, much to Saga's dismay. Saga finds a friend in the enigmatic goth girl Vega, who invites her to a party. Saga decides to go, having nothing better to do. At the local hospital the medical student Sebastian finds some pills which Beckert has been using to treat a comatose patient. Sebastian thinks the pills are drugs and tries them. Rather than getting high, he starts to develop acute hearing and improved vision, is able to talk to dogs and tormented by extreme thirst. Vega shows up at Sebastian's house to pick up the drugs she paid him to provide for the party. Sebastian tells her he has forgotten to get them, but as Sebastian rushes to meet his girlfriend Cornelia's parents, Vega finds the pills and steals them. At the hospital, Annika looks after the coma patient who suddenly bites her. Annika looks to Beckert for aid, but he knocks her unconscious when he realises what has happened. It turns out that Beckert is the last survivor of the massacred platoon who, after a showdown in the cabin, was left the only survivor along with a child vampire named Maria. Beckert brought Maria to northern Sweden with the intention to create a cure for vampirism, but eventually he changed direction to create a new species of human-vampire hybrids. The pills are capsules of vampire blood Beckert has used to covertly spread and study vampirism. Annika manages to free herself and fight off Beckert who turns into a monstrous vampire form. Annika drives a stake into Beckerts heart and runs him over with an ambulance, destroying him. Vega gives the pills to John - the party host - who consumes a pill. John puts the remainder in a bowl of punch to liven up the party, unwittingly infecting multiple guest including Vega. John eventually turns into a vampire and starts mauling his guests. As others succumb to vampirism, the party turn into a bloodbath. Saga hides in the basement, but is attacked by Vega. Saga manages to escape into the backyard, followed by Vega. Saga impales Vega on a garden gnome, who disgruntledly complains about her undignified death. The police arrive to investigate noise complaints (the neighbours mistake the vampires for drug users), and are soon overrun by the vampires. Saga is driven off in an ambulance as the vampires surround the police. John taunts them by saying Don't worry. This will be over any minute. Dawn is... just a month away! In the ambulance Saga encounters Maria who tells her that they will be sisters. As Saga looks to the driver seat she sees Annika looking back with red vampire eyes.

Ander Banke and Magnus Paulsson had been trying to make a Swedish horror film for years but with little success, until a script by Daniel Ojanlatva was sent to them about vampires showing up in Norrland. Daniel Ojanlatva had grown up in Kiruna and thought it was just right to add vampires. Originally the film was set to be a Pulp Fiction-style movie with several stories and characters who went in and out of them. It was going to be called Something Wicked this Way Comes. Pidde Andersson joined the crew and did some work on the dialog and suggested the new title Frostbiten. The movie was mostly shot in Kalix in the winter of 2005 and the board scenes were shot in the Ystad Studios. Anthony Lledo, who had worked with Anders Banke before, was selected to write the score. The producers drew inspiration from vampire films such as The Lost Boys, Fright Night, The Fearless Vampire Killers and Peter Jackson's Bad Taste. Petra Nielsen was cast as Annika; she was always Banke's first choice for the part. Grete Havensk√∂ld, who had starred in Astrid Lindgren films as a child, was cast as Annika's daughter Saga. Per L√∂fberg had been in the hit romcom Ha ett underbart liv and in the cult film Evil Ed and was cast in a then-secret role, and Carl-√Öke Eriksson had played small parts in several films and television series was cast as the professor. Most of the cast were selected in open auditions. The film was shot on Kinor cameras. The producers had trouble finding a Swedish distributor for their film, until Paramount took over the DVD sales after seeing only the 20 first minutes of the film. In the promotion, mostly through the now defunct Beckert website, moviegoers were deceived that Gerhard Beckert would be the \\"Abraham van Helsing\\" of the film. Special effects Frostbiten was the most special-effects-heavy film ever made in Sweden at that time, and two companies were employed to handle them. Swedish effect company Fido Film and Ulitka Post, the same team who did special effects for Night Watch. The special effects were delayed as several of the animators were employed for Peter Jackson's King Kong. Ulitka Post created the opening title, removed wires and created the long, physically impossible take in the cabin scene. Fido Film and Kaj Steveman did all the creature design, created the different vampires, animated the talking mouths on the dogs and created the knife stabbings. CGI and practical effects were heavily mixed. The hideous supervampire that appears at the end was played by actor Kristian Pehrsson wearing a full body suit. The suit took over 6 weeks to make and Pehrsson was unable to defecate and to sit down while wearing it. His ears were glued tightly to his head and every inch of his body was covered in the tight foam latex suit. Over 300 fx shots are in the film, which was the Swedish record until Kenny Begins beat the record. Frostbite is currently the second most effects-heavy Swedish film of all time. Music The music was composed by Anthony Lledo, conducted by Allan Wilson and performed by the Slovak National Symphony Orchestra who later carried on their Swedish vampire legacy by performing the score of Let the Right One In. An album featuring much of the score is available on iTunes Store. The score was very well received by critics. Rue Morgue called it one of the most stirring horror soundtracks in recent years. Missing from the album is Tyomnaja Notch by Leonid Utyosov that is played over the opening credits. The name of the song means \\"Dark Night\\". Other than the score the soundtrack is mostly made up of Swedish pop- and rock-music, among those Millencolin, Lule√• hardcore punk band Raised Fist, Langhorns, Quit Your Dayjob, Son Kite and then newcomers BWO. Diabolic Scheme by The Hives is played over the closing credits. #\\"War\\" 1:23 #\\"Ukraine\\" 1944 0:53 #\\"Abandoned Cabin\\" 1:34 #\\"The Vampire\\" 2:08 #\\"The Coffin\\" 3:35 #\\"Saga\\" 0:31 #\\"Stake Through The Heart\\" 0:48 #\\"Talking Dog / The Kitchen\\" 2:03 #\\"Rufus, Lord Of Evil\\" 0:30 #\\"Beckert's Story\\" 4:48 #\\"Sebastian's Transformation\\" 1:46 #\\"Lamppost Lunch\\" 0:42 #\\"You Are One of Us\\" 1:39 #\\"They're All Dead / John Attacks\\" 1:43 #\\"The Hunt\\" 2:19 #\\"There You Are...\\" 0:56 #\\"Like An X\\" 0:41 #\\"Annika Stabs Beckert\\" 0:42 #\\"Hit The Lights\\" 0:57 #\\"Get The Hell Out Of Here\\" 0:41 #\\"Maria\\" 0:45 #\\"Frostbite Trailer\\" 1:01 Release The film opened at Gothenburg Film Festival on February 3, 2006. At the Cannes Film Festival, the movie was applauded, and sold for distribution to over 40 countries. According to the producers, and to director Anders Banke, Frostbiten became the first horror movie ever to be screened in North Korea. The movie was a big hit in Russia and launched Anders Banke's career in the Russian film industry. Reception In Sweden the film was met with mediocre to negative reviews, with a few exceptions. The movie had average success at the box office in Sweden and seemed to be a failure. After Cannes, Frostbiten was by far the most popular Swedish movie on the foreign markets that year. Svenska Dagbladet gave the film a 3/6 score and praise the cinematography and special effects. Aftonbladet gave it a 3/5 score, calling it an enjoyable horror film. Expressen panned the film, calling it \\"a meaningless splatterfilm\\". Swedish film site Moviemix gave the film a 5/6, but said the film did not deliver the splatter climax he wanted at the end. A reviewer for the site Film Threat wrote, \\"Ever since Buffy the Vampire Slayer and Scream infiltrated the fear-film genre, something's been rotten in Transylvania. Playing horror for winking insider references and juvenile giggles, any real juice has been extracted from the cutting-edge school of cinema that spawned Re-Animator, Dead Alive, and Evil Dead, three brilliant examples of horror that combined ferocious splatter with truly inspired humor. In comparison, Frostbite is too little, too late.\\" G√∂teborgs Posten gave the film another 3/5 score. as did Cinema and complained over the lack of a true character to the film. Film Forum on the other hand gave it a 4/5 score and cited it as a fresh. IGN gave it a 7 out of 10 score and said that, despite its shortcomings, it was very entertaining. The reviewer also pointed out that the setting was perfect and commented that the Swedish landscapes provided a wonderful backdrop for the movie's dark subject matter and that it looked beautiful in a very gruesome kind of way. The reception was better internationally; Bloody Disgusting gave the film 4/5, calling it a masterpiece, saying that the film had a strong cast, great special effects and the film the most enjoyable vampire film since the 80s, filling in: \\"The way the screenplay is written is fantastic, as you can see above the film has many plants that grow and flourish into one hell of a film\\". The horror site Eatmybrains.com gave it 4/5 stars and comments: \\"Banke‚Äôs film exhibits a laid back, droll sensibility perfectly in keeping with its national temperament, and has a unique deadpan sense of the comedic that perfectly complements the material without cheapening it\\". Film4 gave the film 3.5/5, saying that the wartime neutrality of Sweden theme and anxieties about migration (Becket dishonestly sneaking into Sweden and creating a master race) made the reviewer uncomfortable and it took away some of the fun. Most critics praised Emma √Öberg's performance as Vega, saying that she stole every scene she was in. Jonas Karlstr√∂m also received praise for his part as the unfortunate intern Sebastian and mentioned the scene where the newly vampiric Sebastian meet Cornelia's priest father and is served garlic-braised trout as one of the film's strongest and funniest moments. Frostbiten won the best film award at Fantasporto and collected the several awards at Screamfest. Snarkerati ranked this Frostbite as the 43rd best vampire film based on critic rating statistics and on December 26, 2012 IMDb listed Frostbite as the fourth most popular Swedish horror title. Title The title is an obvious play on frostbite, because the movie takes place in a frozen environment and has vampires who bite people in it. The original title was Something Wicked This Way Comes (a phrase from William Shakespeare's Macbeth and also the title of Ray Bradbury's 1962 novel and its 1983 film adaptation). The producers liked the title Frostbiten more since it was more international, and by just cutting the last letter they had an English title. Teasers and trailers on film festivals therefore wore the name Frostbite. However, it was only called Frostbite in the United Kingdom. In the United States the movie is called Frostbitten, the exact translation of the original title. Other release dates * October 21, 2006 * December 15, 2006 Background Frostbiten is Sweden's first vampire movie (unless you consider Ingmar Bergman's Hour of the Wolf to count). Analysis In an analysis of Swedish genre films such as Storm (2005; Swedish title: Tempestade) and Kenny Begins (2009) by Dan Sj√∂str√∂m, Frosbite is discussed in detail. He describes the vampires of Frostbite as representing several different types appearing in the genre; Beckert is in one way the stereotypical mad scientist, but is also a loner vampire in the style of Nosferatu, residing in his castle (in this case the rundown town hospital). He describes the teen vampires as a more sadistic and brutal breed of the undead, an anarchist and aggressive pack straight out of The Lost Boys. Sj√∂str√∂m notes that, rather than joking away the horror, horror and comedy are wrapped tightly together, as in the scene where Saga walks into the aftermath of the bloodbath and encounters John, who laughs grimly at her with a helium voice, or as in the film's infamous \\"gnome-scene\\". He lays weight on the fact that, while following traditional vampire mythology closely, the film puts it into context with modern Sweden. In the spirit of Swedish secularism, the priest role in the film is reduced. He argues that if the film had been made in a more religious country, the priest would have been a main character, who would have provided information about the vampires and lead the fight against them. Instead, the teens know everything about vampires and are just surprised that they are real, rather than confused what to do. The filmmakers trust that the audience, much like the teens, know about vampires, so that information on how to fight vampires is obsolete. Sarah Clyne Sundberg of Sweden.se suggested that the film possibly reflected unprocessed Swedish war guilt. She also mentioned that the film had some great visual and verbal puns and described it as good old-fashioned gore fest. Film4 read the film in a similar way, stating: somewhere amidst the monstrous transformations and belly laughs is an uncomfortable critique of Sweden's much-vaunted wartime neutrality, and her current anxieties about immigration. For this is the tale of a Nazi soldier finding refuge in Sweden with surprising ease, and continuing unchecked in a eugenics programme of his own (with bloodsuckers as the new master race) - and the locals either fail to notice what's happening in their midst or else fall in line with alarming gusto. Frostbite is analysed along with Let the Right One In in the book New Vampire Cinema.

Chlorine has two stable isotopes and one naturally occurring radioactive isotope, the cosmogenic isotope 36Cl. Its half-life is 301,300 ¬± 1,500 years. 36Cl decays primarily (98%) by beta- minus decay to 36Ar, and the balance to 36S. Trace amounts of radioactive 36Cl exist in the environment, in a ratio of about (7-10) √ó 10‚àí13 to 1 with stable chlorine isotopes. This corresponds to a concentration of approximately 1 Bq/(kg Cl). 36Cl is produced in the atmosphere by spallation of 36Ar by interactions with cosmic ray protons. In the top meter of the lithosphere, 36Cl is generated primarily by thermal neutron activation of 35Cl and spallation of 39K and 40Ca. In the subsurface environment, muon capture by 40Ca becomes more important. The production rates are about 4200 atoms 36Cl/yr/mole 39K and 3000 atoms 36Cl/yr/mole 40Ca, due to spallation in rocks at sea level. The half-life of this isotope makes it suitable for geologic dating in the range of 60,000 to 1 million years. Additionally, large amounts of 36Cl were produced by irradiation of seawater during atmospheric and underwater test detonations of nuclear weapons between 1952 and 1958. The residence time of 36Cl in the atmosphere is about 2 years. Thus, as an event marker of 1950s water in soil and ground water, 36Cl is also useful for dating waters less than 50 years before the present. 36Cl has seen use in other areas of the geological sciences, including dating ice and sediments.

It shows exhibits from the pre- and early history of Rome, with a focus on archaeological findings from the period of Ancient Rome. History Founded in 1889 and inaugurated in 1890, the museum's first aim was to collect and exhibit archaeologic materials unearthed during the excavations after the union of Rome with the Kingdom of Italy. The initial core of its collection originated from the Museo Kircheriano (Kircherian Museum), archaeologic works assembled by the antiquarian and Jesuit priest, Athanasius Kircher, which previously had been housed within the Jesuit complex of Sant'Ignazio. The collection was appropriated by the state in 1874, after the suppression of the Society of Jesus. Renamed initially as the Royal Museum, the collection was intended to be moved to a Museo Tiberino (Tiberine Museum), which was never completed. In 1901 the Italian state granted the National Roman Museum the recently acquired Collection Ludovisi as well as the important national collection of Ancient Sculpture. Findings during the urban renewal of the late 19th century added to the collections. In 1913, a ministerial decree sanctioned the division of the collection of the Museo Kircheriano among all the different museums that had been established over the last decades, such as the National Roman Museum, the National Etruscan Museum of Villa Giulia and the Museum of Castel Sant'Angelo. Its seat was established in the charterhouse designed and realised in the 16th century by Michelangelo within the Baths of Diocletian, which currently houses the epigraphic and the protohistoric sections of the modern museum, while the main collection of ancient art was moved to the nearby Palazzo Massimo alle Terme, acquired by the Italian state in 1981. The reconversion of the area of the ancient bath/charterhouse into an exhibition space began on the occasion of the International Exhibition of Art of 1911; this effort was completed in the 1930s. Palazzo Massimo alle Terme Palazzo Massimo alle Terme. Coins on display in the basement of the Palazzo Massimo. A Dionysus Sardanapalus from the Palazzo Massimo. History of the building The palace was built on the site once occupied by the Villa Montalto-Peretti, named after Pope Sixtus V, who had been born Francesco Peretti. The present building was commissioned by Prince Massimiliano Massimo, so as to give a seat to the Jesuit Collegio Romano, originally within the convent of the church of Sant'Ignazio. In 1871, the Collegio had been ousted from the convent by the government which converted it into the Liceo Visconti, the first public secular high school of Italy. Erected between 1883 and 1887 by the architect Camillo Pistrucci in a neo-cinquecentesco style, it was one of the most prestigious schools of Rome until 1960. During World War II, it was partially used as a military hospital, but it then returned to scholastic functions until the 1960s, when the school was moved to a newer seat in the EUR quarter. In 1981, lying in a state of neglect, the Italian government acquired it for 19 billion lire and granted it to the National Roman Museum. Its restoration and adaptation began in 1983 and was completed in 1998. The palazzo eventually became the main seat of the museum as well as the headquarters of the Soprintendenza Speciale per i Beni Archeologici di Roma (Agency of the Ministry of Cultural Heritage and Activities of Italy, in charge for the archaeological heritage of Rome). The museum houses the ancient art (sculpture, painting, mosaic work and goldsmith's craft from the Republican Age to the Late Antiquity) as well as the numismatic collection, housed in the Medagliere, i.e. the coin cabinet. =Ground floor and first floor= Altar of Romulus and Remus A Seleucid prince as hero. The ground floor features the notable bronze statues of the Boxer at Rest and the Athlete. One room is devoted to the mummy that was found in 1964 on the Via Cassia, inside a richly decorated sarcophagus with several artefacts in amber and pieces of jewellery also on display. Sculptures of the period between the late Roman Republic and the early imperial period (2nd century BC to 1st century AD), include *Tivoli General *Tiber Apollo *Via Labicana Augustus *Aphrodite of Menophantos *Hermes Ludovisi from Anzio *Torlonia Vase *Sleeping Hermaphroditus *Dionysus Sardanapalus *Portonaccio sarcophagus =Second floor= Frescoes, stuccoes and mosaics, including those from the villa of Livia, wife of Augustus, at Prima Porta on the Via Flaminia. It begins with the summer triclinium of Livia's Villa ad Gallinas Albas. The frescoes, discovered in 1863 and dating back to the 1st century BC, show a luscious garden with ornamental plants and pomegranate trees. =Basement= The Museum's numismatic collection is the largest in Italy. Among the coins on exhibit are Theodoric‚Äôs medallion, the four ducats of Pope Paul II with the navicella of St Peter, and the silver piastre of the Pontifical State with views of the city of Rome. Palazzo Altemps=History of the building An Apollo Citharoedus from the Palazzo Altemps. Exterior view of the Palazzo Altemps. Dionysus with a panther and satyr, from the Palazzo Altemps. The building was designed in the 15th century by Melozzo da Forl√¨ for Girolamo Riario, a relation of Pope Sixtus IV. There is still a fresco on one wall of the rooms in the palazzo that celebrates the wedding of Girolamo to Caterina Sforza in 1477, showing the silver plates and other wedding gifts given to the couple. When the Riario family began to decline after the death of Pope Sixtus IV, the palazzo was sold to Cardinal Francesco Soderini of Volterra, who commissioned further refinements from the architects Sangallo the Elder and Baldassarre Peruzzi. When the Soderini family fell on hard times, he in turn sold it in 1568 to the Austrian-born cardinal Mark Sittich von Hohenems Altemps, the son of the sister of Pope Pius IV. Cardinal Altemps commissioned the architect Martino Longhi to expand and improve the palazzo; it was Longhi who built the belvedere. Cardinal Altemps accumulated a large collection of books and ancient sculpture. Though his position as the second son in his family meant Marco Sittico Altemps became a cleric, he was not inclined to priesthood. His mistress bore him a son, Roberto, made Duke of Gallese. Roberto Altemps was executed for adultery in 1586 by Pope Sixtus V. The Altemps family continued to mix in the circles of Italian nobility throughout the 17th century. Roberto's granddaughter Maria Cristina d'Altemps married Ippolito Lante Montefeltro della Rovere, Duke of Bomarzo. The Palazzo Altemps became the property of the Holy See in the 19th century, and the building was used as a seminary for a short time. It was granted to the Italian state in 1982 and after 15 years of restoration, inaugurated as a museum in 1997. Collections The palazzo houses the museum's exhibits on the history of collecting (sculptures from Renaissance collections such as the Boncompagni- Ludovisi and Mattei collections, including the Ludovisi Ares, Ludovisi Throne, and the Suicide of a Gaul (from the same Pergamon group as the Dying Gaul) and the Egyptian collection (sculptures of eastern deities). The palace also includes the historic private theatre, at present used to house temporary exhibitions, and the church of Sant' Aniceto. Crypta Balbi=History of the building In 1981, digging on a derelict site in the Campus Martius between the churches of Santa Caterina dei Funari and Santo Stanislao dei Polacchi, Daniel Manacorda and his team discovered the colonnaded quadriporticus of the Theatre of Lucius Cornelius Balbus, the nearby statio annonae and evidence of later, medieval occupation of the site. These are presented in this branch of the museum, inaugurated in 2001, which houses the archaeological remains and finds from that dig (including a stucco arch from the porticus). Collections As well as new material from the excavations, objects in this exhibition space come from *the collections of the former Kircherian Museum *the Gorga and Betti collections *numismatic material from the Gnecchi collections and the collection of Victor Emmanuel III of Savoy *collections from the Roman Forum, in particular a fresco and marble architrave from the late-1930s Fascist deconstruction of the medieval church of Sant'Adriano in the Curia senatus. *Museum of the Palazzo Venezia *the Capitoline Museums *the communal Antiquarium of Rome *frescoes removed in 1960 from the church of Santa Maria in Via Lata. =Basement= The building's basement contains archaeological remains. Access is only by guided tour. =Ground floor= The first section (\\"archaeology and history of an urban landscape\\") presents the results of the excavations, and puts them in the context of the history of the area. As well as showing the remains from the site itself, this section also tells of the Monastero di Santa Maria Domine Rose (begun nearby in the 8th century), of medieval merchants' and craftsmen's homes, of the Conservatorio di Santa Caterina dei Funari (built in the mid-16th century by Ignatius of Loyola to house the daughters of Roman prostitutes) and of the Botteghe Oscure. =First floor= A second section (\\"Rome from Antiquity to the Middle Ages\\") is the Museum of Medieval Rome and illustrates the life and transformation of Rome between the 5th and 10th centuries AD. Baths of Diocletian Michelangelo's Cloister Small cloister The garden in front of the seat of the branch of the Museum housed at the Baths of Diocletian Cloister of Michelangelo The cloister of the charterhouse of the church of Santa Maria degli Angeli e dei Martiri, this is often referred to as \\"Michelangelo's Cloister\\" as he was tasked by the Pope with transforming the Baths into a church and chapterhouse. However, it is more likely that Michelangelo just came up with the layout and that a pupil of his, Giacomo del Duca, was responsible for most of the actual architecture, at least in the initial phase of construction. The cloister was built only after Michelangelo's death in 1564. Construction began in 1565 but took at least until 1600. The upper floor was finished in 1676 and the central fountain dates to 1695. Inside the square of the cloister, a 16th-century garden features outdoor displays of altars and funerary sculpture and inscriptions. These notably include some colossal animal heads, several of which date from Antiquity and were found near Trajan's Column in 1586. Prehistory section On the upper floor of the cloister, this exhibit shows the development of the culture of Latium from the Bronze Age (11th century BC) to the Orientalizing Period (10th to 6th century BC) by means of archaeological findings from the region around Rome. Small cloister The small cloister of the charterhouse has been recently renovated. It occupies around a third of the area previously occupied by the natatio (swimming pool) of the Baths of Diocletian. It was originally built alongside the church. Construction began in the mid-16th century but continued beyond the 17th century. With a side length of 40 meters (half the size of Michelangelo's Cloister) it today features exhibits on the Arval Brethren and on the Secular Games. The late 16th-century travertine well in the centre was added during the recent renovation. Epigraphic section Showing over 900 exhibits on inscriptions/writings, over three floors of a modern building, this collection houses over 10,000 inscriptions. Aule delle Olearie These were the storage facilities created by Pope Clement XIII in some of the former halls of the Baths of Diocletian. These large halls (numbered I to XI), most of them without roof cover, have been part of the museum since 1911. Aula of Saint Isidore A small square room built next to a granary known Annona in 1640. In 1754 it was converted into a chapel dedicated to Saint Isidore. Octagonal Aula This was part of the central complex of the Baths of Diocletian. It was the last of the four halls next to the caldarium. It was converted into a grain store in 1575, and in 1764 became a storage facility for oil. The dome is still the original one. The hall served as an exhibition site in 1911 but was then turned into a cinema and, in 1928, into a planetarium. The hall was restored in 1991. It is devoted to sculptures found on baths sites in Rome.

F. Foster, was a memory training promoter and the prolific writer of more than 50 nonfiction books. He wrote primarily on the rules of play and methods for successful play of card, dice, and board games. Alan Truscott wrote 20 years after his death that Foster \\"had been one of the great figures in whist and bridge\\" for 60 years. Biography R. F. Foster was born in Edinburgh, Scotland on May 31, 1853, the son of Alexander Frederick and Mary E. Macbrair, and \\"connected with some of the best families in Great Britain\\". He was educated as an architect and civil engineer. He emigrated to the United States (probably in 1872) where he engaged in surveying and gold prospecting and then in manufacturing before turning to the memory training and writing businesses in 1893. Foster married Mary E. Johnson in 1891 and became card editor for the New York Sun in 1895. He filled that position to 1919The Official Encyclopedia of Bridge. Edited by Ely Culbertson.

One of his last editions was included in the 1939 New York World's Fair Westinghouse Time Capsule, to be opened in 5000 years. Having written numerous whist and bridge books by 1935, he was considered \\"the dean of living bridge authorities\\". At that time he directed duplicate bridge at the St. George Club in Brooklyn (Hotel St. George). At some time he lived four years in Germany; at another time, \\"three years in South Africa, where he lectured and taught bridge in sixty-five towns.\\" He crossed the Atlantic 97 times in all. Foster was a member of several card, athletic, and golf clubs‚Äîincluding Knickerbockers Whist and the Cavendish Club‚Äîand a member of the Society of American Magicians.

Memory trainer Foster left employment at one of the largest manufacturing houses in Baltimore to become the business manager for \\"Professor Alphonse Loisette\\" (later identified as Marcus Dwight Larrowe), a lecturer and promoter of systems and methods to develop and improve memory skills. Foster resigned in April 1888, wishing not to be associated with Loisette's unethical personal and business practices and accusing him of being a \\"humbug and a fraud\\". Foster subsequently joined William Joseph Ennever and others in a similar business venture, the Pelman School of Memory Training, a correspondence school based in Chicago and London. He delivered lectures and wrote training materials, most notably The Secret of Certainty in Recollection, plainly stated, simply taught: The Pelman‚ÄìFoster System, a book of five correspondence lessons dating from around 1905.

Ring (born October 19, 1970) is a former American attorney and congressional staffer; he served Republicans in both the House and the Senate, including U.S. Representative John T. Doolittle (R-CA). He also served as a counsel on the Senate Judiciary Committee's Constitution, Federalism and Property Rights Subcommittee. In 2000 Ring started work as a lobbyist with Jack Abramoff, particularly to support Native American tribes trying to develop and gain approval for gaming casinos. Ring and Abramoff were each indicted in the Abramoff Indian lobbying and bribing scandal. He went to trial on September 1, 2009, resulting in a hung jury. In a second trial beginning October 18, 2010, Ring was convicted of charges of corruption and honest services wire fraud; he was sentenced in October 2011 to 20 months in prison. He lost his appeal in January 2013, and the US Supreme Court denied certiorari in October 2013 to hear his case. He also faces trial on charges of obstructing congressional and criminal investigators. Life and career Ring has a B.A. in political science from Syracuse University and graduated from the Columbus School of Law at Catholic University of America in Washington, D.C. He entered private practice as a member of the Maryland Bar after having worked as a staffer in both the House of Representatives and Senate. In 1993, he joined the staff of U.S. Representative John T. Doolittle. In 1995, he was promoted to legislative director. In 1998, he was named by then-U.S. Senator John Ashcroft (R-Mo) to serve as a counsel on the Senate Judiciary Committee's Constitution, Federalism and Property Rights Subcommittee. Among other duties, he advised Ashcroft on federal judicial nominations. In 1999 he returned to the House to become executive director of the Conservative Action Team, a group of conservative House Republicans. In 2000, Ring went to work for Jack Abramoff at Preston Gates Ellis & Rouvelas Meeds LLP, the lobbying arm of the law firm Preston Gates & Ellis LLP, based in Seattle. A year later, he followed Abramoff to Florida-based law firm Greenberg Traurig, where he worked until October 2004. In 2002 and 2003, he was named a \\"Top Rainmaker\\" by The Hill newspaper in its annual rankings of Washington's premier lobbyists. In 2004, his book, Scalia Dissents: Writings of the Supreme Court's Wittiest, Most Outspoken Justice, was published. After leaving Team Abramoff at Greenberg Traurig, he joined Barnes & Thornburg LLP law firm in Washington, D.C. Many of his clients followed him there even as he was identified in several congressional investigations of Abramoff. He resigned from Barnes and Thornburg on April 13, 2007, the same day the FBI raided John Doolittle's home. Abramoff scandal In 2005, Ring was subpoenaed to appear before the Senate Indian Affairs Committee as part of its Abramoff probe. Asked to discuss his work with Abramoff on behalf of several federally recognized tribes seeking to establish gaming, Ring asserted his Fifth Amendment right against self incrimination. He said, \\"I'm sorry the clients for whom I worked have had to endure the enormous emotional and financial burden\\", though he was still working for said clients, the Mississippi Band of Choctaw and the Mashpee Wampanoag TribeFed letter demands 8 pages of tribe's letters to Abramoff, others , Cape Cod Today, October 9, 2007. as their paid Washington lobbyist. Ring has two daughters and is separated from his wife, who asked for a divorce after the Abramoff scandal unfolded. Although he has never spoken publicly about the charges and did not testify at his trial, he touched on the scandal in an essay written for an online fatherhood magazine. Arrest and trials On September 8, 2008 Ring was arrested \\"on conspiracy, fraud and obstruction-of-justice charges in connection with his alleged role in a four- year scheme to lavish tickets and trips on lawmakers and government officials in return for help for his clients\\". The indictment also charged him with obstruction of justice, \\"including false statements about his knowledge of Abramoff's financial relationship with lobbyist Michael Scanlon; his own receipt of a $135,000 referral fee; and his knowledge of how Abramoff obtained a job for the wife of Representative 5\\". While not named in the indictment, \\"Representative 5\\", thought to be Congressman John Doolittle, allegedly took a series of official actions that benefited Ring and Abramoff's lobbying clients. In return, Doolittle and his aides received numerous free meals, tickets to concerts and sporting events, campaign contributions and a part- time job for Doolittle's wife, Julie, who owned a consulting firm, that netted her $96,000. Ring was said to have been an intermediary in the hiring of Julie Doolittle‚Ä≤s consulting firm by Abramoff and his firm, Greenberg Traurig, to do fundraising for a charity he founded. Neither Doolittle nor his wife were charged to date. During this time Ring still represented the Mashpee Wampanoag of Massachusetts, who came to his defense. In 2007 Mashpee Wampanoag Tribal Chairman Glenn Marshall told reporters, \\"Kevin (Ring) is a good man. He's an honest guy who's done everything for the tribe above-board.\\" Marshall was subsequently convicted on five felony counts associated with the tribe's casino lobbying, including more than 50 illegal campaign contributions facilitated by Abramoff and Ring. The Mashpee Band remained supportive of Ring even after Marshall's arrest, with new Tribal Council Chair Shawn Hendricks affirming the former chair's endorsements and keeping Ring on the Wampanoag payroll through 2008.Cape tribe feels heat from lobbyist scandal , Cape Cod Times, 11 September 2008. Prosecutors relied on e-mail messages associated with work on behalf of the Mashpee Wampanoag to show that Ring provided tickets to sporting events and pricey meals to Robert E. Coughlin, the former Deputy Chief of Staff, Criminal Division, of the United States Department of Justice. He pleaded guilty in April 2008, saying he had accepted meals, concert tickets and luxury seats at Redskins and Wizards games from Ring. In return Coughlin helped secure a $16.3 million grant for the Mississippi Band of Choctaw Indians, whom Ring and Abramoff represented. Coughlin also helped students attending a school run by Abramoff quickly clear immigration hurdles. Court documents also asserted that Ring had provided gifts for Ann Copland, who was senior staff for Republican senator Thad Cochran. E-mails from Ring were subsequently part of the documents submitted when Copland pleaded guilty in March 2009. =First trial= On September 5, 2008, a federal grand jury had indicted Ring for conspiracy (Count I), payment of an illegal gratuity (Count II), and honest services wire fraud (Counts III, IV, V, VI, VII, and VIII). Before the trial, Ring had been meeting with investigators extensively. Apparently negotiations had broken down and Ring would not accept the proferred plea deal. The jury trial began on September 1, 2009 and resulted in a hung jury on all counts. On October 15, 2009, U.S. District Court Judge Ellen Segal Huvelle declared a mistrial. According to TPMmuckraker, a former prosecutor with the Justice Department's Public Integrity unit, called the case against Ring \\"'an extremely problematic prosecution', since the favors that Ring was accused of doing for public officials weren't in themselves illegal\\". In the interval between the first trial and the start of the second trial, the US Supreme Court issued a ruling on the Honest Services Theft issue (Skilling vs. U.S., June 24, 2010), calling the original law too vague. Its ruling limited the government‚Ä≤s application of a 1988 \\"honest services fraud\\" statute used in Ring's first trial, ruling that it applies only to bribes and kickbacks for specific acts. Before, prosecutors could target patterns of corruption and influence-peddling without proving an explicit quid pro quo. Legal analysts predicted the retrial of Ring would serve as a barometer of the effectiveness of tools available to prosecutors to combat corruption among congressional and executive branch officials. =Second trial= Ring‚Ä≤s second trial began on October 18, 2010. Following the two-week trial, the jury couldn't reach a verdict and sent a note to Judge Huvelle, asking her to explain the difference between legal and illegal gifts. After four days of deliberations, the jury returned a verdict of guilty on five counts on November 15, 2010. Ring was found \\"guilty on one count of conspiring to corrupt congressional and executive branch officials by providing things of value to them and their staffs to induce or reward those who took official actions benefiting Ring and his clients. In addition, [he] was convicted of one count of paying a gratuity to a public official and three counts of honest-services wire fraud for engaging in a scheme to deprive U.S. citizens of their right to the honest services of certain public officials. The jury acquitted [him] on three counts of honest-services fraud\\". According to testimony, \\"Ring sought to further his clients' interests by lobbying public officials in the legislative and executive branches of the federal government,... identified public officials who would assist them and their clients, and then groomed them by providing things of value with the intent of making them more receptive to requests on behalf of their clients in the future. The things of value ... included all-expenses-paid travel, meals, drinks, golf outings, as well as tickets to professional sporting events, concerts and other events, and an employment opportunity for the wife of a congressman ‚Äì which were often billed to Ring's and Jack Abramoff's clients... Ring's corrupt actions resulted in his clients receiving, among other actions, $14 million in congressional transportation appropriations and an additional $7 million from the Justice Department to build a jail.\\" Ring‚Ä≤s attorney said Ring had only been doing his job of influencing public officials. He did not know of specific illegal acts and was not responsible for the capital‚Ä≤s lobbying culture, stating: \\"The way our government works and the role lobbyists play in our government are not on trial, Kevin Ring is on trial\\". The Justice Department asked for a sentence of 17 to 22 years. \\"One reason for the astronomical sentence, according to the government: Mr. Ring was the only lobbyist who went to trial instead of pleading guilty and cooperating with the United States.\\" The government backed off this assessment ... after a rebuke from Judge Huvelle\\" who wrote: \\"Defendant's position is that the government is retaliating against him for exercising his Sixth Amendment right to trial\\", adding \\"It is easy to see why such an inference might be justified\\". Ring was asking for five years' probation. On October 26, 2011, Ring was sentenced by Judge Huvelle to 20 months in prison and to 30 months of supervised release following his prison term. Two more charges are still pending, and may result in a third trial if there is no plea bargaining. He is free on bail while he appeals his conviction, having \\"shown by clear and convincing evidence that he is not likely to flee or pose a danger to the community\\". Ring appealed his conviction, but it was upheld by the U.S. Court of Appeals for the District of Columbia Circuit on January 25, 2013. He appealed that decision to the United States Supreme Court, which denied certiorari on October 7, 2013.

Like many Latvian modernists, his formal artistic training and the choice of his most compelling subjects derived from his experience as a refugee during World War I. Kazaks style contained elements of Impressionism, West European Old Masters, modern French painters and early 20th century Latvian Modernism. He was also profoundly inspired by the series of paintings of his fellow countryman Jazeps Grosvalds, bringing to these themes his own intimist painter's sensitivity. He used his influences and interests to create a personal style characterised by expressiveness, simplicity, synthesis and distortion of forms. He was involved in the formation of the Expressionists' Group in 1919 and then the Riga Artists' Group as its theoretician and first chairman. Several of his major works portray the everyday life of refugees, he also painted portraits and self-portraits. His medium was conditional colour pattern in oil and water colour which he augmented with various graphic techniques (Indian ink, drawing, linocut, woodcut).

Life Highmore was born in London, the third son of Edward Highmore, a coal merchant, and nephew of Thomas Highmore, Serjeant Painter to William III. He displayed early ability but was discouraged by his family from taking up art professionally, and began a legal training instead. At the ending of a clerkship at the age of 17 (during which he continued to attend a drawing academy run by Godfrey Kneller and lectures on anatomy by William Cheselden), he abandoned the law and started to work as a painter. On the revival of the Order of the Bath in 1725, he was selected to paint the knights in full costume. The years 1732 to 1734 were spent on a tour of the Netherlands and France. In the next few years he received patronage from the royal family, but during the 1740s began to cater more for a middle-class clients. In 1762 Highmore sold the contents of his studio and retired to Canterbury, where he lived with his daughter and son-in- law. Highmore died aged 87 on 3 March 1780. He was buried in sheep's wool (to comply with a 17th-century statute to encourage the wool trade) in the fifth bay of the south aisle of Canterbury Cathedral. Family His wife Susanna Highmore (n√©e Hiller) was a poet, though little of her work was published. His son Anthony Highmore (1719‚Äì99) was an artist, one of whose 15 children, Anthony Highmore Jnr. (1758‚Äì1829), became a writer on legal affairs and a social activist. Works Pamela teaching her children (1743‚Äì45). Fitzwilliam Museum, Cambridge In addition to his work as a portraitist, Highmore painted works illustrating biblical subjects, historical painting being a style which Highmore had picked up on his travels in France. One such biblical painting is Hagar and Ishmael, which Highmore donated to the Foundling Hospital for the purpose of decorating its Court Room. The painting is now part of the Foundling Hospital art collection at The Foundling Museum in London. In 1744, Highmore painted a series of 12 paintings after scenes from Samuel Richardson's Pamela, or Virtue Rewarded, which were engraved by Benoist and Louis Truchy. Some of them were displayed within the temporary exhibition, Basic Instincts , curated by Jacqueline Riding at The Foundling Museum from September 29, 2017 to January 7, 2018. The exhibition explored Georgian attitudes to love, desire, and female reputation through the radical paintings of Joseph Highmore . One of the most prominent paintings displayed was The Angel of Mercy (c.1746), which is thought to be a painting draft for a larger piece.

Early life Abdul Qayyum Khan was born in the State of Chitral but had Kashmiri origin. His father, Khan Abdul Hakim, was originally from the Wanigam village in the Baramulla district, Jammu and Kashmir, but worked as a Tehsildar in the North-West Frontier Province (N.W.F.P., now called Khyber Pakhtunkhwa in Pakistan in 2017) of British India. Khan was educated at Aligarh Muslim University and the London School of Economics. He became a barrister of the Lincoln's Inn. One of his brothers, Abdul Hamid Khan (Azad Kashmiri politician), was a prime minister of Azad Jammu and Kashmir, and another brother, Khan Abdul Rauf Khan, was a renowned lawyer. Legal career Abdul Qayum Khan was one of the eminent lawyers of N.W.F.P. During his professional career he conducted some very important cases. He used to practice in criminal law. Mirza Shams ul Haq was his most trustworthy colleague, who remained always close to him during profession and politics. Abdul Qayum was also assisted in his chambers by Muhammad Nazirullah Khan advocate, who later served as a provincial secretary general and senior vice president of Pakistan Muslim League. Political career= Indian National Congress  Starting his political career in 1934 with the Indian National Congress, Khan quickly rose to serve as an elected member of the Central Legislative Assembly (1937‚Äì38) and the deputy leader of the Congress in the Assembly. At that time he admired Khan Abdul Ghaffar Khan. He authored a book, Gold and Guns on the Pathan Frontier, in which he praised Ghaffar Khan and denounced Jinnah and the two-nation theory. Abdul Qayyum Khan said that the North West Frontier Province would resist the partition of India with its blood. He switched his loyalties to the Muslim League in 1945. He later claimed that Ghaffar Khan was plotting Jinnah's assassination.M.S. Korejo (1993) The Frontier Gandhi, his place in history. Karachi : Oxford University Press. He banned his own book after he became the Chief Minister in the N.W.F.P. The book however continued fetching royalties even after he joined the Muslim League.  Muslim League and Partition  In the 1946 provincial elections, Khan campaigned for the All-India Muslim League along with Pir of Manki Sharif. However, the Muslim League won only 17 seats in comparison to the 30 seats of the Congress Party. The Congress Party formed the provincial government under the premiership of Khan Abdul Jabbar Khan (popularly known as \\"Dr. Khan Sahib\\"). Abdul Qayyum Khan was put in charge of destabilising the Congress government in the province through street agitations, ideological rhetoric and acquisition of sympathetic Muslim officers in the government. The presence of a Congress government at the extreme north-west of the Indian subcontinent was anomalous, and the province became a bone of contention between the Congress and the Muslim League as part of the Partition of India. Eventually, the British decided to hold a referendum to determine which dominion the province should go to. Abdul Ghaffar Khan demanded a separate nation of 'Pakhtunistan' comprising both the North-West Frontier Province and Pashtun parts of Afghanistan. When it was denied by the British Raj, he and his party boycotted the referendum held by the British government. The Muslim League won an easy victory for Pakistan (289,244 votes against 2,874 for India). Within a week of the independence of Pakistan, the Congress government was dismissed under orders from Governor General Jinnah. Abdul Qayyum Khan was put in charge of a minority government on 23 August 1947. Khan navigated through the troubled waters ably, winning the defection of enough Congress legislators to support his government.Religious parties to rule NWFP a second time, Dawn, 20 October 2002.  First Kashmir War  Qayyum Khan was a key instigator of the First Kashmir War, if not the chief instigator.  North- West Frontier Province  As the premier of the NWFP, Qayyum Khan faced internal dissension. The Pir of Manki Sharif, who was a key figure in the campaign for referendum, was miffed that he was passed over for the post. He objected to Khan holding both the premiership of the state and the presidency of the provincial Muslim League. The Pir gathered disgruntled legislators and intended to bring a vote of no-confidence against Khan. Khan diffused his efforts. Then the Pir formed a separate party under the banner of All Pakistan Awami Muslim League. An exasperated Khan responded with \\"full fury and force\\". He forced out the Pir of Manki Sharif from the NWFP and imprisoned nine other leaders. Despite the crackdown, the Awami Muslim League contested the provincial elections in 1951 to win 4 seats. Qayyum Khan's administration was known for its development work in the province, including the construction of Peshawar University and the Warsak dam. He introduced compulsory free education up to middle school level in Frontier province, the first province of Pakistan to have this reform. He also made poor friendly amendments to the land revenue laws. He evoked opposition from a section of the feudal class due to his egalitarian policies. His political stand was opposition to the Khudai Khidmatgar movement of Ghaffar Khan.Jalal, Ayesha(1991)The State of Martial Rule: The Origins of Pakistan's Political Economy of Defence. Lahore. Vanguard His alleged role in ordering the Babrra massacre is one which he faces much criticism. He led the Muslim League to a landslide victory in the 1951 elections, despite opposition from the Khudai Khidmatgar movement and opposition from federally backed fellow Muslim league opponents like Yusuf Khattak.Afzal, M. Rafique (2002). Political Parties in Pakistan: 1947‚Äì1958, Vol. 1. Islamabad, National Institute of Historical and Cultural Research. Qayyum Khan served as the Chief Minister till 23 April 1953.  Central Government  He served as central minister for Industries, Food and Agriculture in 1953. Arrested by the Ayub Khan regime, he was disqualified from politics and imprisoned for two years before finally being released. Contesting the 1970 General Election in Pakistan from three seats as leader of the Pakistan Muslim League-Qayyum faction, he won two National Assembly of Pakistan seats, one provincial seat and, in 1973, entered into alliance with the Pakistan Peoples Party (PPP) after East Pakistan broke away in the Bangladesh Liberation War. Appointed federal interior minister by Zulfiqar Bhutto, he served in that post till the 1977 elections, when his party suffered a near total rout. After Zia-ul-Haqs assumption of power, Qayyum Khan tried to unify all the disparate Muslim League factions. His efforts were inconclusive and he died on 22 October 1981. He was always opposed by Khan Habibullah Khan; they were lifelong rivals since they were young classmates at Islamia College, Peshawar. Criticism= Babrra massacre Under the orders of Abdul Qayyum KhanPakistan: History and Politics, 1947‚Äì1971 (1 April 2002) by M.Rafique Afzal p38 OUP Pakistan the Babrra massacre occurred on 12 August 1948 in the Charsadda District of the North-West Frontier Province (now Khyber Pukhtunkhwa) of Pakistan, when workers of the Khudai Khidmatgar movement were fired upon by the provincial government.Miscreants and militants DAWN. Retrieved 15 September 2008 According to official figures, around 15 protestors were killed while around 40 were injured. However, Khudai Khidmatgar sources maintained that around 150 were killed and 400 were injured. In September 1948, then Chief Minister, Abdul Qayyum Khan gave a statement in the provincial assembly, \\"I had imposed section 144 at Babra. When the people did not disperse, then firing was opened on them. They were lucky that the police had finished ammunition; otherwise not a single soul would have been left alive\\". Khan Qayyum said hinting at the four members of the opposition in the provincial assembly.

The APG II system (2003) treats the family in the order Liliales, in the clade monocots. This is a slight change from the APG system, of 1998, which left the family unplaced as to order, but did assign it also to the monocots. Taxonomy The family is usually taken to include three genera, Corsia, Corsiopsis, and Arachnitis with a total of 27 known species. As the members of this family are achlorophyllous non-autotrophic herbs (i.e. they are not green, and do not photosynthesize) they have sometimes been included in the family Burmanniaceae which, however, according to APG II is not even in the same order. The APG companion site cites a reference which suggests the family should consist of Corsia only, with Arachnitis better placed nearer to family Burmanniaceae.

The extremist UK- based Islamist groups al Ghurabaa and The Saviour Sect staged a controversial protest march from London Central Mosque near Marylebone Station to the Danish Embassy near Knightsbridge Underground station. Al Ghurabaa call Muslims to protest Al Ghurabaa published an article on their website entitled, \\"Kill those who insult the Prophet Muhammad\\". The article states, \\"The insulting of the Messenger Muhammad is something that the Muslims cannot and will not tolerate and the punishment in Islam for the one who does so is death\\". Then on 31 January 2006 they issued a press release calling \\"all Muslims to rise & defend the honour of the Messenger Muhammad.\\"http://www.alghurabaa.co.uk/pr/danishdemo.htm They stated that the \\"Islamic verdict on individuals who insult any Prophet needs to be passed by an Islamic Court and implemented by the Islamic State\\" but go on to explain how they believe the \\"55 Muslim countries in existence today all implement non-Islamic law and their insults to the Messenger Muhammad are worse than what appears in the newspapers....Clearly were it not for the fact that they fear being overthrown by an angry Muslim population, not a word would have been mentioned about the current incident from the leaders of Saudi Arabia, Egypt, Bahrain, Pakistan, Kuwait, etc\\". The protest The protest occurred on Friday 3 February. The Metropolitan Police stated in a briefing that 450 protesters attended the Friday demonstration, 3,500 attended on Saturday in protests by other groups. Some protesters waved placards reading slogans such as \\"Massacre those who insult Islam\\", \\"Butcher those who mock Islam\\", \\"Be prepared for the real holocaust\\", \\"Europe you will pay, your 9/11 is on the way\\", or \\"7/7 is on its way\\"; \\"Europe you will pay, Bin Laden is on his way\\", \\"Freedom go to hell\\" and \\"Europe you'll come crawling, when the Mujahideen come roaring\\". Despite the similar theme on al Ghurabaa's website, their spokesman, Anjem Choudary, said he did not know who wrote the placards. Bricklaying student Omar Khayam, 22, from Bedford, was photographed wearing a garment resembling a suicide bomber's jacket outside the Danish Embassy. Police tried to stop press photographers from taking pictures of Omar in the 'bomb vest'. Omar said he had no regrets about his style of dress, telling the Daily Express, \\"I didn't go there to cause anyone any harm. I went along just to attend a protest. Yet I have been branded a suicide bomber overnight. Did I say, 'Kill Jews?' No. Did I have racist signs on me? No. So why this reaction?\\" He went on, \\"Yes, I would do it again to make a point. I could have gone along and held up banners or something, but this made the point better\\". Two men attended the protest to stage a counter-demonstration, handing out leaflets reading \\"Free speech or no free speech? You decide\\" and \\"Should these cartoons be banned?\\". Reactions The Embassy of Denmark in London, pictured in 2008. David Davis, the Shadow Home Secretary, said that slogans such as \\"Massacre those who insult Islam\\" amounted to incitement to murder and that police should take \\"a no tolerance\\" approach to them. He told the Sunday Telegraph, \\"Clearly, some of these placards are incitement to violence and indeed incitement to murder.\\" Dominic Grieve, the Conservative legal affairs spokesman, expressed concern that it could prove impossible to identify those responsible because arrests had not been made at the time. He said, \\"It is certainly not a happy state of affairs where such a demonstration takes place and those people who are acting in that way don't end up under arrest before the demonstration is ended.\\" David Winnick, on the Commons home affairs committee, said those carrying banners threatening violence should be prosecuted and, where possible, deported. \\"Those who are temporarily in Britain, the sooner they are out of the country the better,\\" he said. \\"Those who have been given permission to live here, insofar as it is possible in law, it would be better for this country and indeed for the Muslim community if that right was removed.\\" The Labour MP Shahid Malik, also on the committee, wrote to Sir Ian Blair, head of the Metropolitan Police, calling for prosecutions. Tony Blair said, \\"There is a real sense of outrage....it is very important for our overall good relations in this country that people understand there is no political correctness that should prevent the police from taking whatever action they think is necessary\\". Simon Hughes, Liberal Democrat President states, \\"To forbid the freedom to offend is not compatible with modern multi-cultural societies. But inciting violence is always wrong and a crime. The leaders of the great faith communities should together make clear that the strength of their religions can withstand all attacks, satirical or otherwise. They should respond to attacks with frankness and clarity but never with hate or retaliation.\\" UK newspapers express disgust at Omar Khayam's protest and his picture made the front page of The Sun. Pictures of Khayam was among those studied by the Scotland Yard team, which also examined police CCTV and sound recordings to identify any offenders and pass on evidence of any offences to the Crown Prosecution Service. The Metropolitan Police, under fire for the lack of arrests, issued a statement, \\"Those gathered were well natured and in the main compliant with police requests. Arrests, if necessary, will be made at the most appropriate time. This should not be seen as a sign of lack of action ... The decision to arrest at a public order event must be viewed in the context of the overall policing plan and the environment the officers are operating in. Specialist officers were deployed on both days to record any potential evidence should it be needed at any point in the future. All complaints will be passed to the public order crime unit for further investigation\\". On 6 February, the Home Office requested briefing from the Metropolitan Police's Public Order Branch to provide assessment of two demonstrations. This document was later obtained by the BBC under the Freedom of Information Act and its contents were reported, including some controversial claims. The document states that the Saturday protesters \\"were encouraged by a large group of photographers and cameramen\\" although no news organisations or individual's names were given. The protest was also condemned by the Muslim Public Affairs Committee UK, an organisation which encourages British Muslims to vote against politicians who support the Iraq war and/or Israel. MPACUK's leader Asghar Bukhari called for the arrest of the protest's leaders. Aftermath=Apology On 6 February 2006, Omar Khayam, accompanied by the chairman of his local mosque and by Patrick Hall MP apologised \\"wholeheartedly\\" to the families of the July 2005 London bombings and said it had not been his aim to cause offence. He said, \\"Just because we have the right of free speech and a free media, it does not mean we may say and do as we please and not take into account the effect it will have on others. But by me dressing the way I did, I did just that, exactly the same as the Danish newspaper, if not worse.\\" In 2002 Khayam was jailed for possessing crack cocaine with intent to supply. Having been released on parole in 2005 after serving half of his six-year sentence, he was arrested the next morning for breaching his parole conditions, and returned to prison. The Daily Mirror interviewed an 'insider' who knew Khayam at Springhill Prison. Their source said, > He was a very quiet guy and would only ever speak out when he was with other > extremists. He told people that he would use the money from drugs for the > cause, meaning radical Muslim groups. He has obviously become even more > radicalised since he got out. It was well known that Omar made a lot of > money from drugs. He was part of a large crew in Bedford. His street name is > Skinner and there are a lot of drug users in the town who know him through > these connections. When he got involved with these groups linked to terror I > think a lot of non-Muslim prisoners felt they didn't want much to do with > him any more. Glorification of terrorism debate On 14 February 2006, the Muslim Council of Britain (MCB) urged Parliament to vote for the removal of the 'glorification of terrorism' clause from the Terrorism Bill. The MCB say the Bill is perceived as \\"unfairly targeting Muslims and stifling legitimate debate.\\" Tony Blair managed to win the battle, banning the glorification of terrorism, by 315 to 277 votes.MPs back ban on glorifying terror , news.bbc.co.uk, 15 February 2006 He said, \\"The new law will mean that if people are going to start celebrating acts of terrorism or condoning people who engage in terrorism, they will be prosecuted, and if they do not come from this country, they should not be in this country. We have free speech in this country, but you cannot abuse it.\\" William Hague, standing in for David Cameron, said at Prime Minister's Questions that the inclusion of \\"glorification\\" in the Bill was mere spin, an attempt to give the impression that tough action was being taken. \\"Wouldn‚Äôt it be better to have a watertight law designed to catch the guilty, rather than a press release law designed to catch the headlines?\\" he said. Tony Blair replied, \\"If we take out the word 'glorification' it sends a massive counter productive signal\\". Blair insisted that an offence of glorifying terror was the only way to prosecute demonstrators who carry banners praising the 7/7 bombers. He said that existing laws only allowed prosecutions for preaching hate by word of mouth, but not by the written word or through placards. Hague said that he was mistaken. Criminal charges There was considerable outcry at the perceived inaction on the part of the police to counter the protests. David Davis wrote to the Home Secretary stating that \\"[t]here is a clear public interest in ensuring that those who incite murder are appropriately dealt with and an equal public interest that there is no unnecessary delay. Furthermore, not to take action is to let down the moderate Muslim majority\\". It was reported that members of the public made more than 500 complaints to Scotland Yard about the demonstration. The two charges of using either spoken or written words to cause 'Intentional Harassment, Alarm Or Distress', under Section 5 of the Public Order Act 1986, carry a maximum sentence of 6 months' imprisonment,Police Law, \\"Public Order Act 1986 Section 5\\" whereas those causing 'Racially Aggravated Intentional Harassment, Alarm Or Distress', under Section 31 of the Crime and Disorder Act 1998, carry a maximum sentence of 2 years' imprisonment.Police Law, \\"Crime and Disorder Act 1998 Section 31\\" On 7 March 2006, having reviewed 60 hours of footage from closed-circuit television, amongst other evidence, and after consultation with and authorisation by the Crown Prosecution Service, the Metropolitan Police announced, \\"We have been advised today that there are sufficient grounds to arrest individuals for offences under the Public Order Act. This includes offences that are racially or religiously aggravated\\". On 15 March 2006, five men were arrested and charged for their roles in the protests; one of them was charged and held in custody, two were charged and released on police bail to attend court, and the remaining two were released on police bail for further inquiries.

It is the second busiest railway station in Belgium and one of three principal railway stations in Brussels, together with Brussels-South and Brussels-North (see List of railway stations in Belgium). First completed in 1952 after protracted delays caused by economic difficulties and World War II, it is the newest of Brussels' main rail hubs. History During the late 19th and early 20th centuries, Brussels-North and Brussels-South were the primary railway stations in Brussels (Brussels-North slowly supplanted the original / Station near the same site). However, they were joined only by an inadequate single track running along what is today the route of the Brussels inner ring road. Many proposals were put forward to link the two stations more substantially. A law was finally passed in 1909 mandating a direct connection. Draft of Brussels Central Station by left The famed architect Victor Horta was awarded the design of the Central Station building complex in 1910. He finished the initial version in 1912. Plans for the station originally featured a major urban redevelopment project, for which land was purchased and over 1,000 buildings demolished in the 1920s.Aubry, Fran√ßoise; Vandenbreeden, Jos (1996). Horta ‚Äî Art Nouveau to Modernism. Ghent: Ludion Press. The Putterie/Putterij district began to be razed to make way for the underground station and building complex. However, work was halted by the World War I. Financial constraints limited work after the war, and in 1927, the government suspended the project altogether. In 1935, a new office dedicated to the project was set up and work resumed. The Central Station was planned as a hub in the connection. However, World War II slowed construction again. The interruptions and delays to construction left large areas filled with debris and craters for decades. Horta returned to work on the station after the end of the war. The building was completed according to Horta's plans by an architectural team led by Maxime Brunfaut, who expanded them by adding a new train line to the national airport and several underground passageways for pedestrians.Aubry, Fran√ßoise; Vandenbreeden, Jos (1996). Horta ‚Äî Art Nouveau to Modernism. Ghent: Ludion Press.M. Nilsen; Railways and the Western European Capitals: Studies of Implantation in London, Paris, Berlin, and Brussels, Springer, 2008, p. 156. An Islamic jihadist attempted to detonate a bomb in the station in the June 2017 Brussels attack. Railway station The railway station has six tracks, served by three island platforms. These are underground, beneath the city blocks within /, /, the Kantersteen and /. The main entrance and ticket office are at ground level on Boulevard de l'Imp√©ratrice, and there are several other entrances on the other streets. The station was renovated between 2004 and 2010 in an attempt to better equip it to present levels of usage (which can reach 150,000 passengers/day on the busiest days). Two new entrances were created on that occasion, and the main entrance was extensively renovated. The /, a pedestrianised square, was created in front of the station. Plans then came for the renovation of the tunnel which links the main station with the metro stop. It has been described as dilapidated, dirty, and permanently tinged by the smell of urine. An architectural firm had been retained in 2010 to implement the project designed to make the hallway a better \\"window\\" to Brussels for the many travellers who begin their journey there. The new tunnel with hops and a more luminous, graffiti resistant environment were completed in 2013. Although Brussels' Central Station is at the very heart of the city, its capacity is not adapted to present usage levels ( 70,000 passengers on a weekday), let alone future levels. The interior and the platforms have been renovated in recent years, but the main problem (i.e. lack of capacity) has not fundamentally been addressed. There have been suggestions to expand the station, but none of them has gained widespread acceptance. Today, at peak times, about 96 trains an hour use the six platforms of the station. With passenger growth expected to average 4% per year in the coming decade, Infrabel, the administrator of the Belgian rail network, has determined that an expansion of the rail capacity and of the Central Station will be necessary. The CEO of Infrabel has estimated the cost of an adequate expansion at least ‚Ç¨1 billion, and has said it will be necessary to complete the project by 2020. However, the task of getting all relevant authorities to agree on a plan has so far proved difficult. Some credit a general taboo against discussions of expanding the North‚ÄìSouth rail axis as a result of the history of extended delays and widespread destruction of neighbourhood blocks that the initial construction brought between 1911 and 1952.

The Ph√¶no Science Center Ph√¶no arose from urban planning by the City of Wolfsburg. In 1998 City officials were developing a plot of vacant, public land immediately adjacent to Wolfsburg's railway station and just south of VW's huge, then-unfinished attraction Autostadt. An art museum was planned for the site, but Dr. Wolfgang Guthardt, then the City's Director for Culture, Sports and Education, knew that such an institution would compete with Wolfsburg's successful Kunst Museum (Art Museum) and needed other options. Guthardt visited Technorama, a science center in Switzerland and became convinced that a science center in Wolfsburg would complement both Autostadt and the Kunst Museum. Preliminary planning began in November 1998, and one year later Joe Ansel, an American consultant and designer, was approached to handle the exhibitions and other operational aspects of the project. An architectural design competition was held in January 2000 and the prominent architect Zaha Hadid won, in conjunction with structural engineers, Adams Kara Taylor. About five years later, Ph√¶no opened to the public on November 24, 2005 with over 250 interactive exhibits from Ansel Associates, Inc. all enclosed in an astounding concrete structure designed by Zaha Hadid, her German associate, Mayer B√§hrle architects and Adams Kara Taylor. The architectural design has been described as a \\"hypnotic work of architecture - the kind of building that utterly transforms our vision of the future.\\" The design won a 2006 RIBA European Award as well as the 2006 Institution of Structural Engineers Award for Arts, Leisure and Entertainment Structures. The building stands on concrete stilts, allowing visitors to the Autostadt to pass through without interfering with the workings of the building. Ph√¶no is connected to the Autostadt by a metal bridge accessed by escalators and stairs either side. The underside of Ph√¶no and the \\"stilts\\" are illuminated. Dr. Guthardt is now Ph√¶no's first Executive Director. Ph√¶no has enjoyed high attendance and broad public acceptance since its grand opening. The Science Center has a theme song, \\"Phaenomenal,\\" which was written and performed by American singer/songwriter Amanda Somerville for the opening. The Ph√¶no was included on a list of the 7 wonders of the Modern World (objects built since 2000) by The Financialist.  Movie appearances  The Phaeno appears in the movie The International as headquarters of an Italian weapons company - digitally inserted in front to a cliff at the Iseo Lake.

It is the third book in the Wess'Har Series. Plot summary The Bezeri are no more. The effects of the cobalt-salted nuclear weapons have had devastating effects on their population and has wiped them out completely. Aras and the rest of the Wess'Har have a strong desire to see those responsible punished. They have already destroyed the Actaeon and its crew that refused to abandon ship. Those who did are now the occupants of the habitat called Umeh Station on the planet Umeh, as it is called by the Isenj who live there. Aras is battling his conflicting loyalties and genetics. Part of him wants to blame Bennett for Shan's death as he was involved and another part recognizes that Bennett now shares genes with himself and Shan. Aras and Bennett take a trip to the transplanted colony from Constantine, now called Mar'an'cas. Aras feels the need to see the Garrod family and see to the colony's well-being. He finds, unsurprisingly, that he is no longer welcome. The admit him as they do not have the force to stop him but they make their feelings clear. Eddie Michallat is increasingly becoming more involved in the politics of the different worlds interacting. He is friends with the Isenj Minister Ual; who is finding that as he fights to preserve his world from the potential wrath of Eqbas Vorhi, so Umeh seems intent on its own destruction. He is inescapably bound to Wess'ej as tries to honor the memory of Shan Frankland and her sacrifices for everyone involved and his growing friendship with Aras, Bennett and the Wess'Har community. He still is a reporter at heart but that seems to be changing as his conscience affects his decisions for stories more and more. The information he provides now has the power to create war on Earth and the realization is sobering. Eddie decides to tell the real reasons for the destruction of Christopher, the death of Shan Frankland and also of the coming of the World Before and its possible ramifications, to the people of Earth. Wess'Har has demanded the delivery of Mohan Rayat and Lindsay Neville. Minister Ual has been told by his government that they will only do so only if the Destroyer of Mjat (name given to Aras for the destruction of the Isenj city on Bezer'ej) is turned over to them. Ual, knowing that the Wess'Har do not negotiate, has decided to oppose his government by secretly allying with Eddie and the Royal Marines at Umeh Station to capture Neville and Rayat and turn them over to the Wess'Har. He knows this will be the end of his career and possibly his life but for the sake of Umeh, he feels he must do this. The Wess'Har scouts have discovered the body of Shan Frankland. Nevyan takes a shuttle out to recover her body. To her surprise and astonishment, they discover, once her body is aboard, that Shan is still alive. She has been floating, frozen in the depths of space for months and her c'naatat has somehow kept her dormant but alive. Her body appears as a mummy; waxy and emaciated. They return to F'nar and reveal this to Bennett, Aras, Eddie, and the rest of the F'nar community. They immediately set about taking care of her to nurse her back to health. She does eventually recover enough to wake up. Meanwhile, the World Before has come. A patrol ship lands and disgorges a crew of only males. They are the first ship and advise that another will be along as well. The Wess'Har do what they can to be accommodating but Nevyan does not like the way the Eqbas males seem interested in c'naatat. Eventually the second ship from Eqbas Vorhi arrives and it is massive. The ship itself rearranges and two smaller ships split off from it; one to reconnoiter Bezer'ej and the other for Umeh. The tension on Umeh heightens with this and the Isenj try to make the Wess'Har withdraw but to no avail. Shan is filling out and getting stronger thanks to the care of Ade and Aras. She finds that she has feelings for both men and Aras, whose people practice polyandry, finds this acceptable and would like a house brother but fears that Shan will come to prefer Ade because of their shared homeworld. Ade is having a harder time contemplating a polyandric relationship but is coping as best he can. As Shan gets stronger she begins getting involved in the politics and the goings-on of F'nar. She also makes a trip to Bezer'ej to view the destruction and what the Eqbas are doing to repair the damage. While there, they discover that the blast did not destroy the c'naatat and that there are some survivors of Bezeri. The Bezeri only want to talk to Aras, though. When Aras journeys to the world, the Bezeri tell him that they want those responsible turned over to them for \\"balancing\\". Aras knows that the Bezeri would include the Royal Marines in their list of those responsible, so to protect Ade, Aras lies and says that it was just Neville and Rayat. The Bezeri also want Aras to come stay with them underwater to help them rebuild and recover what they've lost. Aras is torn by his duty to the Bezeri and his duty to stay with Shan and make her happy. The Eqbas are moving right into their roles as peacekeepers and environmental control. They advise both Earth and Umeh to prepare for their coming and the changes that will entail. In the instance of Umeh, population control and environmental cleansing‚Äîand in the case of Earth, they plan to restore the plants and animals held in the gene bank; whether Earth likes it or not. They are also cleaning up the damage on Bezer'ej in record time. On Wess'Har, one Eqbas named Shapakti, is performing miracles. He has found a way to separate c'naatat from its human host, using sample tissue from Shan, but not from its wess'har host. He also started creating a jungle habitat using DNA and genomes from the gene bank. Aras decides that he will go live with the Bezeri in spite of the pain it will cause him to be separated from Shan. Ade wants Shan to be happy and feels that he is in the way of Shan's and Aras' happiness so he decides to force Aras not to go. The solution presents itself in the form of Mohan Rayat and Lindsey Neville. Lindsey wants to redeem herself (and not die) and feels that the best way to accomplish this is to live underwater and serve the Bezeri. This would mean becoming infected with c'naatat. Ade agrees to this and infects both her and Rayat and send them to the depths with the Bezeri. Shan knows nothing of all this at this point and seems to finally accept her role as an isan to Ade and Aras in their polyandric relationship.

It ends at a junction with U.S. Route 44 (US 44) and NY 55 east of the city limits in Arlington, a hamlet in the town of Poughkeepsie. NY 376 was originally designated as part of NY 39 in the mid-1920s.

After this, the speed limit returns to . NY 376 passes by the Dogwood Knolls Country Club before meeting County Route 29 (CR 29) in the hamlet of Fishkill Plains, at which point NY 376 proceeds west. Immediately after crossing from the town of East Fishkill into the town of Wappinger, NY 376 turns north at an intersection with CR 93\\\\. It continues north for about through the hamlet of Diddell, where it turns west again towards the hamlet of New Hackensack. Here, the route meets CR 94 and CR 104\\\\. NY 376 turns north at this intersection, running along the eastern perimeter of and providing access to the passenger terminal of Dutchess County Airport. North of the airport, NY 376 runs closely parallel to Wappinger Creek, briefly entering the town limits of La Grange before crossing the Wappinger Creek into the town of Poughkeepsie. Roundabout on NY 376 at Vassar College In the Poughkeepsie hamlet of Red Oaks Mill, NY 376 meets the eastern end of NY 113 (Spackenkill Road) and the northern end of CR 77 (Vassar Road) at the center of the community. NY 376 approaches the intersection at a 45-degree angle, resulting in a series of sharp traffic movements between the three roads‚Äîthe sharpest being the 135-degree turn between NY 376 northbound and Vassar Road southbound. Past the junction, NY 376 continues north on New Hackensack Road, the northward continuation of Vassar Road. After heading north and northwest for , NY 376 turns right onto Raymond Avenue at Vassar College. Its continuation on New Hackensack Road is known as Hooker Avenue and is designated NY 983T, an unsigned reference route, to the Poughkeepsie town/city line about from its junction with Cedar Avenue (known as CR 74 south of the city limits). NY 376 follows Raymond Avenue for about a mile (1.6 km) to the hamlet of Arlington. Here, it meets US 44 and NY 55, both of which follow a one-way couplet along Haight Street (eastbound) and Maple Street (westbound) through the city of Poughkeepsie. In between the two streets, NY 376 intersects Main Street (CR 114). The route ends upon intersecting westbound US 44 and NY 55, at which point the routing of NY 376 becomes an unnumbered town road named Van Wagner Road. History=Route designation Signage for NY 376 near the route's southern terminus NY 376 was originally designated as part of NY 39, a route extending from Patterson to Poughkeepsie by way of West Patterson and East Fishkill, in the mid-1920s. In the 1930 renumbering of state highways in New York, NY 39 was reassigned to another highway in western New York while its former routing in the Hudson Valley was broken up into several routes. One of these was NY 202, a new route that began in East Fishkill and ended in Poughkeepsie. The rest of NY 39 became part of NY 52 from East Fishkill to the western fringe of Patterson, and NY 311 for the rest of the routing.Automobile Legal Association (ALA) Automobile Green Book, 1930‚Äì31 and 1931‚Äì32 editions, (Scarborough Motor Guide Co., Boston, 1930 and 1931).

In order to avoid a numbering conflict, NY 202 was renumbered to NY 376 that day. Roundabouts In 2006, the New York State Department of Transportation (NYSDOT) converted NY 376's intersections with the main gate of Vassar College and College Avenue into roundabouts. Both of the roundabouts replaced traffic lights. A traffic signal used to control traffic for a pedestrian crosswalk was also removed as part of their construction. Another roundabout was constructed in 2008 at Fulton and Collegeview Avenues. NYSDOT has called the installation of roundabouts a success, stating that it has significantly calmed traffic, decreased congestion and increased traffic flow. Roundabouts on NY 376 in front of Vassar College The construction of the roundabouts was controversial from the outset. The first two roundabouts were installed by NYSDOT even though both the town and city of Poughkeepsie declared that they were opposed to the roundabouts. Additionally, the roundabouts have drawn much controversy from local residents because they remove a lane of traffic in each direction, reducing Raymond Avenue (NY 376) from a four-lane road to a divided two-lane boulevard and significantly altering pre-existing traffic patterns. A moderate amount of traffic has diverted onto alternate local routes as a result. In response, NYSDOT installed traffic calming measures on these parallel roads prior to the construction of the Fulton Avenue roundabout.

They made use of the forests of the Pacific to build dug-out canoes, and houses made of evenly split planks of wood. They used tools made of stone and wood. The native peoples of the Pacific coast also made totem poles, a trait attributed to other tribes as well. In 2000 a land claim was settled between the Nisga'a people of British Columbia and the provincial government, resulting in the transfer of over 2,000 square kilometres of land to the Nisga'a.

Background and education Scott was the second son of Walter Montagu Douglas Scott, 5th Duke of Buccleuch and Lady Charlotte Anne Thynne, daughter of Thomas Thynne, 2nd Marquess of Bath. He was educated at Eton. He suffered from severe asthma and it was recommended by physicians he spend the cold British winters in a warmer climate. Accordingly, from the age of 15, he and his tutor, the Rev Henry Stobart, travelled overseas each winter. These trips became longer and took them further afield. Madeira, Egypt, the West Indies, Turkey, Greece, South Africa, and the Pacific Islands were visited over the next 14 years. In March 1853, he and his friend, Lord Schomberg Kerr, and their tutor arrived at Sydney. Young British aristocrats were rare visitors to New South Wales and Sydney matrons with unmarried daughters ensured they did not lack invitations to dinners, balls and other social events. Lord Henry made many sketches and paintings in the colony, some of which are now held by the Mitchell Library and John Oxley Library in Australia.Suzanna de Vries Evans (1983), Historic Sydney as seen by early artists, Sydney, Angus & Robertson, pp.140-1.

He was official Verderer of the New Forest from 1890 to 1892, and Honorary Colonel of the 4th Hampshire Rifle Volunteers from 1885. In 1885 he was raised to the peerage as Baron Montagu of Beaulieu, in the County of Southampton.

He works in several genres, concentrating on fantasy, but also writing science fiction, and mystery and media tie-ins. Biography Macdonald was born in 1954, and raised in White Plains, New York. He attended the University of Rochester, and went on to serve in the US Navy for fifteen years. He has been writing professionally since the early 1990s and has published 35 novels. Educational work Macdonald is well known for his work in educating aspiring authors, particularly for his advice on avoiding literary scams. Early in his career he was asked by such an author how much he had paid to have his books published, and in response began a campaign of educating other writers about the problems of vanity publishers. As part of this campaign, he coined Yog's Law, which states \\"Money should flow toward the author.\\" This rule is named after \\"Yog Sysop\\", a nickname of Macdonald that refers to Yog-Sothoth. It is often quoted by professional authors such as John Scalzi and Teresa Nielsen Hayden when giving advice on finding an agent and getting published. Atlanta Nights and PublishAmerica One target of his campaign is PublishAmerica, a company that claims not to be a vanity publisher but a \\"traditional publisher\\" that accepts or rejects books based on their quality. Macdonald organized a group of professional authors to test whether that company was actually reading any submissions for clarity and realism before accepting them. One day after Macdonald issued a press release announcing that PublishAmerica had accepted a manuscript that was created to be as bad as possible, the company withdrew the offer to publish it. Awards and honors Knight's Wyrd was awarded the Mythopoeic Fantasy Award for Children's Literature, 1992, and named to the New York Public Library Books for the Teen Age list in 1993. In 1997, he was awarded Best Young-Adult Science Fiction by the Science Fiction Chronicle for Groogleman.

Beginnings  Charles Henry Bennett was born at 3 Tavistock Row in Covent Garden on 26 July 1828 and was baptised a month later in St. Paul's Church, Covent Garden. He was the eldest of the three children of Charles and Harriet Bennett, originally from Teston in Kent. His father was a boot-maker. Nothing is known of Charles's childhood, although it is likely that he received some education, possibly at St. Clement Dane's School on nearby Stanhope Street. At the age of twenty, Charles married Elizabeth Toon, the daughter of a Shoreditch warehouseman, on Christmas Day 1848, also in St. Paul's Church. Their first son (another Charles) was born a year later and by 1851 the family was settled in Lyon's Inn in the Strand. At the time of their wedding, Charles was attempting to support his family by selling newspapers, but three years later, in the 1851 census, he described himself as an artist and portrait painter. Charles and Elizabeth's family kept growing and moving, and by 1861 they were living in Wimbledon with their six children. Charles, the eldest, was by this time at school, while the youngest, George, was just seven months old.  The early life of an artist and a bohemian  As a child, Charles developed a passion for art, drawing for his inspiration the motley crowds he saw daily in the market. His father was unsympathetic and stern in his dismissal of what he considered a waste of time. As an adult, Charles became part of the London bohemian scene, and was a founder member of the Savage Club, each member of which was \\"a working man in literature or art\\". As well as socializing over convivial dinners, members of the club published a magazine, The Train. Charles Bennett contributed many illustrations, signed 'Bennett' rather than with his CHB monogram, but the magazine was short-lived. The middle of the nineteenth century saw the launch of many cheap, mostly short-lived periodicals in London. The Devil in London, The Penny Trumpet, The Whig Dresser and The Squib only lasted a few weeks, while The Man in the Moon survived for two and a half years. In 1847, James Hannay, novelist, journalist and prot√©g√© of Thackeray, founded Pasquin, followed in 1848 by The Puppet Show and The New Puppet Show (1849). Charles Bennett contributed small illustrations to these and other magazines, although identifying them is hindered by the absence of his distinctive monogram. By 1855 he was better known and was invited to design the masthead and front page cartoon for the first issue of the Comic Times (1855). He also contributed to Diogenes (1855) and Comic News (1863-1865) as well as mainstream illustrated magazines such as The London Journal (1858), Good Words (1861), London Society (1862-1865) and Every Boy's Magazine (1864-1865). His occasional full-page illustrations (such as the page of characters from Twelfth Night) appeared in Christmas and New Year editions of The Illustrated London News.  Children‚Äôs books  From The Adventures of Young Munchausen, 1865 1858 saw the publication of the first of more than a dozen children's books illustrated by Charles Bennett. Old Nurse's Book of Rhymes, Jingles & Ditties (1858) was, as the title suggests, a collection of children's verse with colour illustrations on every page and a frontispiece illustrating ‚ÄòOld Nurse at Home.‚Äô Among the children's books that followed were the very short Nine Lives of a Cat (1860), with its twenty rather crudely illustrated pages and The Adventurers of Young Munchausen (1863), the story of a young man whose fantastic adventures ranged from discovering the source of the Nile to travelling in space in a balloon. The Stories that Little Breeches Told (1863) is dedicated by the author to his daughters Harriet and Polly (Mary), with a suggestion that he was already ill, as follows: > DEAR HARRIET AND POLLY, > As soon as Little Breeches had told me these stories, I told them to you; > but I am afraid I should soon have forgotten them, every one, if you had not > so carefully treasured them up. Now when they are in print, and the pictures > are all etched on copper-plates, I am made happy indeed, by your kindness in > allowing me to dedicate them (in this new form) to you. > And remain, > All that is left of me, > Your affectionate Father, > CHARLES BENNETT Charles H Bennett's signature In addition to this dedication, the book has a strong family flavour, with comments from family members after each story. As well as Charles, Elizabeth and the children, there are also comments from Grandmamma, Grandfather, Uncle George (Toon) and an unnamed aunt. Similarly, The Sorrowful Ending of Noodledoo (1865) was dedicated to his son George who had been ill, although \\"as he got better his temper fell sick.\\" Lightsome and the Little Golden Lady (1866), probably his best children's book, also begins with a family dedication. Charles thanks \\"my dear Charley\\" (by now 16) who had written down the story from his father's telling, a task which had given them both much enjoyment. In addition to his own children's books, Charles Bennett provided the illustrations for Tom Hood's Jingles and Jokes for the Little Folks (1865) as well as for books of fairy tales by Henry Morley and Mark Lemon. Shadows and Fables A Queer Fish, from the Shadows series Among Charles Bennett's best known and best loved books were his Shadows series. In Shadow and Substance (1860), Charles Bennett and Robert Barnabas Brough (with whom he had collaborated on the 1854 edition of Punch and Judy) describe the eidolograph, a magic lantern of which Charles Bennett is named as the \\"sole inventor and original patentee.\\" The shadows cast by the eidolograph indicate the true character and personality of the sitter. Thus a fat schoolboy's shadow is portrayed as a snail while Charles Bennett becomes an ass. The collection of shadow pictures was reprinted several times in coloured versions without the accompanying text and seems to have been something of a best seller. The shadow of a man leaning on a post shows him to be \\"A Queer Fish\\" and that of a young woman servant depicts a black slave. The Shadows illustrations first appeared in the Illustrated Times, which also published his weekly series of Studies in Darwinesque Development in 1853. These circular drawings, in which various animal species evolve into human beings, were published posthumously in the book, Character Sketches, Development Drawings and Original Pictures of Wit and Humour, in 1872. The most reprinted of Charles Bennett's books has been his illustrated version of Aesop's fables. First published in 1857, it has reappeared many times, most recently in 1978, with a French translation in 1979 (Le renard qui avait la queue coup√©e et autres fables adapt√©es et dessin√©es par Bennett).  Pilgrim's Progress  'Timorous', from Pilgrim's Progress Towards the end of the 1850s, Charles Bennett prepared an illustrated version of Bunyan's Pilgrim's Progress, for which he produced more than 120 drawings, including sparely drawn caricatures of all the characters. He initially had great difficulty getting this work published, until it came to the attention of Charles Kingsley, who provided a preface for the book, whereupon Longmans accepted it for publication. In his letter to Charles Bennett, Kingsley agreed that an appropriately illustrated version of the book was needed and offered his views on the style to be used. He cautioned against imaginative freedom at the cost of beauty of form and pointed to a strong German element in Bunyan, which should be expressed by a tendency to the grotesque. He concludes the letter by urging the artist to put the visions on paper as they appeared to the mind of the seer himself. ‚ÄúNow we know that Bunyan saw these people in his mind's eye, as dressed in the garb of his own century. It is very graceful and I should keep to it, not only for historic truth's sake, but because in no other way can you express Bunyan's leading idea, that the same supernatural world which was close to old prophets and martyrs was close to him; that the devil who whispered in the ears of Judas, whispered in the ears of a cavalier over his dice, or a Presbyterian minister in his Geneva gown.‚Äù Perhaps feeling that he was being too prescriptive, Kingsley concluded, ‚ÄúTake these hints as meant, kindly.‚Äù Charles Bennett added a small illustration at the end of the preface showing the writer (Kingsley) helping the artist (Bennett) up the hill of fame. The two became friends and Charles Bennett visited Kingsley at home in Eversley, where he was the rector, returning home with gifts for Elizabeth from Mrs Kingsley. His other two serious books from this period were Quarles‚Äô Emblems (1861) and London People: Sketched from Life (1863). Francis Quarles was a seventeenth century poet who was a cupbearer to the future Queen Elizabeth and subsequently secretary to James Usher, the primate of all Ireland, who was best known for his biblical chronology which claimed to establish the date of the creation as the night preceding Sunday, 23 October 4004 BC. Quarles' Emblems (originally published in 1635) consisted of a series of paraphrases from the Bible expressed in ornate and metaphorical language, each concluding with an epigram of four lines. Originally popular, Emblems was panned by 17th and 18th century critics but the publication of a new edition illustrated by Charles Bennett and W Harry Rogers indicated that it may still have been popular in the 1800s. London People contains some of Charles Bennett's best illustrations. Co-authored with John Hollingshead, the book brings together sketches from the Cornhill Magazine, ‚Äúdesigned to exhibit faithful delineations of physiognomies characteristic of different classes of LONDON PEOPLE as they appear, not aiming at humorous exaggeration on the one hand or ideal grace on the other. In 1865, Charles Bennett contributed a frontispiece and three illustrations to The Reverend John Allan's temperance tale, John Todd and How He Stirred His Own Broth-pot.  The Punch years  Charles Henry Bennett's distinctive monogramCharles Bennett‚Äôs drawings appeared in Punch from time to time and in 1865 he was invited to join the Punch Council, which included Mark Lemon (Editor), Shirley Brooks and John Tenniel. By March 1866 Charles was a regular attendee and another member of the Council, Henry Silver, recorded in his diaries some of Charles Bennett‚Äôs contributions to discussion and reported that he was deaf in his right ear and smoked cigars. Silver also mentions that Charles was left handed although he sometimes drew with his right hand. In a discussion of recurring nightmares, Shirley Brooks‚Äô was swimming in a sea of butter, while Charles Bennett described how he had to tie up a parcel but was unable to find a piece of string the right length, despite cutting a hundred bits. Parliament as a toy box, 1865His regular contributions began in February 1865 at the beginning of a new parliamentary session with a cartoon of Mr Punch opening parliament. Over the next two years he contributed nearly 200 drawings, identified by his characteristic CHB monogram from March 1865 onwards. He specialised in very elaborate initial letters, such as the letter Z at the beginning of Punch's Essence of Parliament in April 1866. He occasionally contributed political cartoons, and in September 1866 he depicted the Pope as a turnip propped up by a musket, about to be knocked away by Louis Napoleon. Charles Bennett's bohemian appearance, apparently the result of his financial straits, seems to have been the cause of comment even around the Punch table. In October 1866, therefore, the Council passed the following resolution: > Resolved > ‚Ä¢ That this meeting deeply sympathises with C. H. Bennett on the state of > his hair > ‚Ä¢ That this meeting appreciates the feeling which detains the said Bennett > from the Council until his hair shall have been cut > ‚Ä¢ That this meeting deplores the impecuniosity which prevents the said > Bennett from attending a barber > ‚Ä¢ That this meeting, anxious to receive the said Bennett to its bosom once > again, organizes a subscription to enable him to attend the said barber > ‚Ä¢ That this meeting, having (limited) confidence in Mr. Mark Lemon, entrusts > him with the following subscriptions in aid of the above object, and > requests him to communicate with the aforesaid Bennett, to the end that he > may have his damn hair cut, and rejoin the assembly of the brethren. This resolution was signed by ten members of the Council, who each contributed one penny by attaching a penny red stamp to the letter. It seems unlikely that the state of his hair was the true reason for Charles's absence from Council meetings, it being more likely that his deteriorating health was already keeping him away. His final attendance at the table was apparently on 12 December 1866 and Henry Silver recorded his absence the following week, but made no further reference to his subsequent presence.  An early death  By the beginning of 1867, Charles and Elizabeth were living in Caversham Road, Kentish Town. His health was failing and his final cartoon appeared in Punch on 23 March. Shirley Brooks visited him on 31 March, recording in his diary: \\"Went off to enquire about Bennett, who has just got into a new house in the Kentish Town wilds ... Never having been in the region, I managed to forget the directions of the map and found myself in the Holloway Road, but soon worked my way round to the spot, which is pleasant enough. Saw his son only, a very nice boy, who said Bennett was \\"a little better\\".\\" Charles Bennett died on 2nd April between eight and nine in the morning. His death certificate recorded the cause of death as neuralgia and atrophy (although his widow subsequently asserted that he had died of consumption) and his occupation was given as \\"Draftsman on wood.\\" Brooks recorded in his diary: \\"I am very sorry. Bennett was a man one could not help loving for his gentleness. Such a wonderful artist\\", and Henry Silver wrote the following day: \\"Intelligence of poor Bennett‚Äôs death yesterday. So we didn‚Äôt dine.\\" An obituary appeared in Punch on 13 April. Charles Bennett was buried in Brompton Cemetery on 8 April. His wife and one of his sons were later buried in the same grave. Two days later the Punch Council discussed the needs of his widow, Elizabeth, with eight children and another on the way, \\"although no debts.\\" Because of his long illness, his life had been too hazardous for insurance. They agreed that there was a case for a public appeal and that they would press their private channels as well. The published appeal, over the names of Charles Kingsley, Mark Lemon and John Everett Millais as well as Brooks himself, was distributed widely and appeared as a letter in the Times. With the help of Charles's friends at Punch, his widow also approached the Artists‚Äô Benevolent Institution and the Royal Literary Fund. As well as soliciting donations through advertisements and personal contacts, the Punch Council decided to stage a benefit performance for the family. The Adelphi Theatre in London was duly booked for the afternoon of Saturday, 11 May 1867, just five weeks after Charles Bennett's death. The afternoon included the first public performance of Cox and Box, Arthur Sullivan's first opera, given by the Moray Minstrels, along with performances by Kate Terry, Florence Terry and Ellen Terry and others. The afternoon was clearly a success and another benefit performance was arranged in Manchester at the end of July. There is no record of the total amount raised for his family, but by the time of the 1871 census Elizabeth (who described herself as an \\"Annuitand\\") and the children were living in Gainford Road, Kentish Town. In 1881 she was able to claim to have \\"Means derived from dividends\\"‚Äô despite having considered taking lodgers at the time of Charles‚Äôs death.  Personality  In his obituary of Charles Bennett for Punch, Shirley Brooks records that \\"he was a very able colleague, a very dear friend. None of our fellow‚àíworkers,\\" it continues in the generous style of obituaries, \\"ever entered more heartily into his work, or laboured with more earnestness to promote our general purpose. His facile execution and singular subtlety of fancy were, we hoped, destined to enrich these pages for many a year. It has been willed otherwise, and we lament the loss of a comrade of invaluable skill.\\" The reference to his \\"earnestness\\" contrasts with his nickname of \\"Cheerful Charley\\" and his reputation as an eccentric bohemian. In the History of Punch, M H Spielmann reports that, in the words of Augustus Sala, Charles Bennett was \\"sober, industrious, and upright, and scarcely a Bohemian; but throughout his short life he was ‚ÄòMurad the unlucky'.\\" The Dalziel brothers, noted 19th century engravers, also described him as an \\"earnest man concerning his work ‚Ä¶ time should never be allowed to enter into the question; the task should be defined but never trammelled by 'How long will it take?' \\" His prodigious output - well over 1000 illustrations in his short working life - is an indicator of how hard he worked and suggests an earnest approach to every project. A fuller description of his nature appeared nearly thirty years after his death in The Magazine of Art (1895), where M H Spielmann described him as \\"one of the best known, and most keenly appreciated amongst the humorous artists of the century.\\" Spielmann asserted that his nature \\"was largely made up of that love & pity, of that breadth of sympathy and depth of emotion which are to be found in the heart of all true humourists. He was, moreover, a man of deep religious thought, profoundly moved by the love of children; and accordingly religion and childhood inspired much of his art and produced most of his happiest works. The strength of the man‚Äôs nature, too, declared itself in its technique, which, however halting at the beginning, was always firm in touch and resolute in design; and to these qualities he owes it that we forgive much of the obvious lack of training with which his earlier work was tainted.\\" Charles Bennett's love of children comes out clearly in his children's books, with their family dedications and references. Many of the wonderful, beguiling ideas in these books were the outcome of happy morning walks with his children in Wimbledon. He considered walking a profitable pastime and would trudge for miles thinking up new characters and imagining fresh faces. The same Magazine of Art article asserts that \\"most of the roads of Kent knew him as a familiar figure, and Canterbury, Ashford & Maidstone were his constant goal when he started, knapsack on back, with no other companion than his sketchbook, pipe & stick.\\" Opinions of his work vary, from those who consider Charles Bennett to have been among the leading illustrators of the 19th century to other critics who have found his drawings outdated and over-characterised. It is clear, however, from the few written observations that survive, that he was affectionately respected by colleagues and revelled in his family life, telling stories to his children and illustrating them for publication. He combined an earnest single- mindedness in his work with a cheerful and sympathetic manner, which justified the assertion in the Punch obituary that Charles Bennett was \\"one of the kindliest and gentlest of our associates, the power of whose hand was equalled by the goodness of his heart.\\"  Bibliography = Illustrated books by Charles H Bennett  * Fables of Aesop (1857) * Old Nurse's Book of Rhymes, Jingles and Ditties (1858) * The Faithless Parrot (1858) * Birds, Beasts and Fishes (1859) * Proverbs with Pictures (1859) * The Nine Lives of a Cat (1860) * Little Breeches (1863) * The Book of Blockheads (1863) * Nursery Fun: the Little Folks‚Äô Picture Book (1863) * The Frog who Would A-Wooing Go (1864) * The Sorrowful Ending of Noodledoo (1865) * The Adventures of Young Munchausen (1865) * The Sad History of Greedy Jem (1865) * Lightsome and the Little Golden Lady (1867) * Mr. Wind and Madam Rain (1867)  Other books illustrated by Charles H Bennett  * The Wonderful Drama of Punch and Judy (1854) * Umbrellas and Their History (1855) * John Cargill Brough's The Fairy Tales of Science (1859) * Pilgrim's Progress (1860) * Shadow and Substance (1860) * Henry Morley's Fables and Fairy Tales (1860) * Games of Skill and Conjuring (1861) * Henry Morley's Oberon's Horn (1861) * Francis Quarles' Emblems (1861) * W.

It was released as the lead single from their debut album Psyence Fiction (1998). The song features vocals from British musician and Radiohead member Thom Yorke. The song was written by Yorke and UNKLE member Josh Davis and produced by UNKLE, the track heavily utilizes samples from other songs. The track takes its title from a quote from the thriller film Jacob's Ladder (1990); dialogue from the film is also one of many samples on the song. The song also appears to sample the percussion from Talk Talk's \\"New Grass\\" from their album Laughing Stock (1991). Musically, \\"Rabbit in Your Headlights\\" combines Yorke's vocals with a variety of samples from sources ranging from Dutch band Supersister, to the film Contact (1997). While the single was not a commercial success, the song was positively received by critics. The song's accompanying music video, directed by Jonathan Glazer and starring actor Denis Lavant, was widely acclaimed for its direction and cinematography, and won numerous awards. Music video The song's music video, directed by Jonathan Glazer, premiered in November 1998. The critically acclaimed video won the MVPA's Best International Video of the Year Award in 1999. In 2006, Stylus Magazine ranked it number one on their list of the Top 100 Music Videos of All Time. It is anthologised on the DVD Directors Label, Vol. 5: The Work of Director Jonathan Glazer. The video recalls imagery from the Alan Clarke-directed film \\"Made in Britain.\\" The video uses a technique which Glazer would later use for the \\"A Song for the Lovers\\" video, being shot in real-time and allowing the diegetic sounds produced by objects and characters to be audible above the music. The music itself is non-diegetic. Plot The video stars Denis Lavant as a man wearing a heavy parka and walking along the middle of the road in a busy car tunnel. He appears to be disoriented, mumbling and shouting incoherences, only occasionally including intelligible words such as \\"Cristo\\", \\"Allahu Akbar\\", and \\"sinner!\\" Some of the cars honk at him and swerve out of his way. All of a sudden a car hits him from the side, and he is left on the ground. The car, a Saab 900, continues its course without stopping or slowing down. After a while, the man stands up and starts walking again as if nothing had happened. Then another car hits him; this time the hit occurs straight on and sends him flying a couple of feet. A passing motorist watches with contempt as the man rolls in the street. The man gets up again. A car swerves by and slows down alongside the man, occupied by three young men played by British actor Craig Kelly as the vehicle's driver and UNKLE's James Lavelle and Richard File as passengers. The driver repeatedly inquires as to the man's destination, who for his part seems oblivious to their presence and continues along his way blurting, \\"Saint Christopher\\"; the driver soon tires of this and speeds off whilst calling out, \\"Nice coat, man!\\" Another car hits the man, and he gets up almost instantly. More accidents occur, some cars honk, some cars swerve out of the way ‚Äî but none stop. The man removes his parka and throws it on the ground. He is shirtless underneath, and we see his chest covered with bruises and cuts. After the ritornello, leaving just a piano and drums playing, the man stops as well. He smiles and opens his arms in a crucifix-like position. A Vauxhall Cavalier MK2 is coming his way and makes no intention of stopping. The car hits the man, but this time he stands unmoved, and the car is destroyed upon impact.

Originally, seawater was used, but today it is more common to use tap water with a very generous amount of salt added. After cooking, the water is removed and the potatoes are briefly left in the pot on the stove to dry off, until they become shrivelled with a fine salt crust.

It entered service in 1942 and continued in production until 1945. Designed for reconnaissance, and liaison between armoured units, it provided protection only against light arms fire, so was not a front line vehicle. More importantly it was small and fast and could quickly evade trouble. It became the shape format for the post war Ferret armoured car which began production in 1952. History Humber Scout Car, side view. Although at the outbreak of the Second World War the British Army had already selected the Daimler Dingo for production, the need for scout cars could not be met by Daimler alone, so other companies were required to produce similar vehicles. One of these companies was Humber which along with other companies in the Rootes Group was already producing armoured cars and the Humber Light Reconnaissance Car. In 1942 they built a vehicle similar to the Dingo in layout. To comply with the official requirement to keep the weight down, the Daimler \\"Dingo\\" was open top (the Humber had an unarmoured floor). The vehicle carried a crew of two, with an emergency seat for a third member. It was equipped with a No. 19 radio set. The armament consisted of one Bren light machine gun with a 100-round drum. A second Bren could be added if necessary. This was mounted above the roof, and could be operated from inside the vehicle using a system looking similar to bicycle handlebars, where the \\"brake\\" levers fired the triggers of the Brens. Production of the vehicles continued until 1945. At least 4,298 were ordered and at least 4,102 delivered, 1,698 of them Mk I. They were used by British armoured units (e.g. the 11th Armoured Division and the Guards Armoured Division) for scouting and liaison and were generally considered less capable and reliable than the Dingo. A number of vehicles were given to the Polish II Corps and the 1st Czechoslovak Armoured Brigade. After the war, some European armies used the Humber. The Belgian army used the Mk II in their tank and reconnaissance units until 1951. A unknown number of these vehicles were then handed over to the Belgian police which continued to use the car until 1958. Most of the vehicles were destroyed in the 1960s when the British Army used them as targets for tank gunnery practice. There are now currently only about 20 known to exist.

It featured two former members of celebrated Derry pop-punk band The Undertones plus ex-members of fellow Derry bands Bam Bam and The Calling and The Corner Boys. They recorded five albums between 1986 and 1994, exploring an eclectic fusion of alternative rock, post-punk, garage rock and dance music (including sampling) which in part anticipated and overlapped with the dance-pop era of the 1990s. Following a 14-year break, the band reunited in 2008 for various dates, tours and festival appearances before returning to hiatus in 2010. Four members of the band went on to form The Everlasting Yeah. Career=Formation and debut single Following the split of The Undertones, John O'Neill (the band's former guitarist and principal songwriter) returned to his hometown of Derry and teamed up with friend and fellow guitarist Raymond Gorman (ex-Bam Bam And The Calling) and Mickey Rooney to DJ together at Derry's 'Left Bank' club.\\"Such a good thing we do ‚Äì in conversation with The Everlasting Yeah‚Äôs Raymond Gorman, part one\\" - interview by Malcolm Wyatt in Writewyattuk, 18 August 2014 Inspired by the records they were playing, the two formed first a new songwriting project and then a new band, playing a couple of gigs with a drum machine and Gorman's then-girlfriend as singer. Another friend, drummer Ciaran McLaughlin (formerly with The Corner Boys), but who had also played a few Undertones gigs covering for an absent Billy Doherty)\\"The Everlasting Yeah: Raymond Gorman Of That Petrol Emotion Interviewed\\" - interview by Odhran MacGabhann in The Quietus, 5 February 2014 was the next member to join. In autumn 1984, the nascent That Petrol Emotion relocated to London, where the existing three members were joined by John's brother and former Undertones lead guitarist Damian O'Neill (who not only agreed to switch to bass guitar, but turned down an invitation to join Dexys Midnight Runners in order to work with TPE). Charismatic Seattle-born American singer Steve Mack (at the time, on a year out from his studies and working in a pizzeria in London) completed the lineup.Band biography on That Petrol Emotion homepage (hosted on the Wayback Machine) In 2020, comedian Paul Whitehouse revealed that he had unsuccessfully auditioned for the band during this period. That Petrol Emotion's influences encompassed artists as diverse as The Beatles, Afrika Bambaataa, Television, Sly & the Family Stone, Captain Beefheart and Can. Following some initial interest from Creation Records, they released their debut single \\"Keen\\" on Pink Records in July 1985. The sound of the new band severed overt musical links with The Undertones due to its darker, more edgy sound: That Petrol Emotion were also far more political and outspoken than The Undertones had been, with the Irish members listing their names in their Irish language forms on the sleeve art and (in their songwriting) beginning to look into issues relating to the Irish Troubles. O'Gorman would later described the band as having been \\"like the Undertones after discovering drugs, literature and politics, with a lot more girls in the audience dancing.\\" As with The Undertones, John O'Neill emerged as principal songwriter (although songwriting contributions were made by all group members). Manic Pop Thrill and Babble Following a busy period gigging in small venues and becoming \\"ridiculously popular on the pub circuit\\", plus the release of a second single in September 1985 (\\"V2\\", which the band put out on their own temporary Noiseanoise label), That Petrol Emotion signed a deal with Demon Records. Their debut album Manic Pop Thrill, released in 1986, charted at number 1 in the UK Indie Chart. It was received with rave reviews from the critics, especially by Undertones champion John Peel. They were described by Rolling Stone magazine as \\"The Clash crossed with Creedence\\", and the New York Times described them in 1987 as \\"a youthful Rolling Stones\\" crossed with a \\"revved-up Television\\". The band's second album and major label debut Babble (released in 1987 on Polydor Records) broke into the UK Albums Chart and won universal acclaim, being voted as one of the albums of the year by Rolling Stone magazine critics, and receiving an A- 'grade' from Robert Christgau. In the UK, the single \\"Big Decision\\" was released in 1987 which charted at number 42. This would be the band's highest chart position for a single release. Demonstrating an intensification of the band's political stance, the back sleeve of \\"Big Decision\\" had contained text criticising the Diplock Courts in Northern Ireland and their potential ability to convict on false or forced confessions.Artwork for 'Big Decision' (hosted on www.discogs.com) Twenty-seven years later, Raymond O'Gorman would comment \\"with regard to the politics and having grown up with Protestants, my thing was always to go back to civil rights. To make people understand that the only reason the IRA were in existence in the first place was due to the intransigence of the British and the Unionists. The whole situation in Northern Ireland is too difficult to explain and hard for most outsiders to grasp. Once we started talking about politics the music almost became secondary.\\" The next TPE single of 1987, \\"Genius Move\\", was banned from being aired by the BBC due to a reference in the sleeve artwork to Sinn F√©in politician Gerry AdamsArtwork for 'Genius Move' (hosted on www.discogs.com) (at the time, a hate figure for the UK establishment due to his suspected links with the IRA, which would lead to his voice being banned from British media between 1988 and 1994). O'Gorman has pointed out \\"there was no need for any reference to (Adams) 'cos the quote was from Liam Mellows, but I think it had been left to our tour manager to sort out the sleeve and without thinking he included a reference to Adam‚Äôs book. It will haunt us forever that one. Pretty poor excuse all the same to ban us/the single; pathetic, really; however, no one knew we were banned as they didn‚Äôt make a fuss a la Frankie Goes To Hollywood, very smart on their part.\\" By this stage, That Petrol Emotion had won the praise of significant alternative rock figures such as Robert Smith and Robin Guthrie. However, the band's failure to gain further hit singles led to problems with Polydor when the latter's management changed in this period. Following demands made to the band to deliver immediate hit singles, That Petrol Emotion exploited a loophole in their contract and left Polydor, only to be snapped up within a few weeks by Virgin Records. Lineup shuffle: End of the Millennium Psychosis Blues and Chemicrazy On the eve of the recording sessions for the third That Petrol Emotion album, End of the Millennium Psychosis Blues, John O'Neill announced his imminent departure from the band. Although he stayed to record the album, the sessions were fraught with tension and foreboding. O'Gorman has recalled \\"it was a complete bombshell. When I look back now, we should have thrown him out there and then and got on with the new recording ourselves. Instead we meekly accepted everything and he hung around for another three or four months. It was a toxic situation.\\" Upon release in 1988, End of the Millennium Psychosis Blues was greeted with confusion by critics and fans alike. It was meant to emulate the eclectic mixtapes the band listened to and loved on their tour bus but this dance and sample experimentation (\\"Groove Check\\", \\"Here It Is... Take It!\\", \\"Tension\\") mixed with heavy alt.rock (\\"Under the Sky\\"), Celtic ballads (\\"Cellophane\\") and indie (\\"Sooner or Later\\", \\"Every Little Bit\\") proved too disjointed and diverse to break into the mainstream at the time. However, the album has been reappraised, with many critics and fans admitting that, while this diversity in style did alienate people on the contemporary scene, That Petrol Emotion were very much before their time and were even trailblazers for the Britpop and Madchester indie-dance scene (thanks to their early experiments mixing up indie rock with funk and dance). Having completed tour dates to promote the album, John O'Neill left That Petrol Emotion in October 1988. Following his departure, a reshuffle took place in the band. Drummer Ciaran McLaughlin and guitarist Raymond Gorman picked up major songwriting duties (blossoming as writers in the process) whilst John Marchini (who had covered on guitar for an ailing Gorman on some of the tour dates) joined on bass guitar to allow Damian O'Neill to take up the guitar alongside Gorman. This new dynamic of musicians and songsmiths led to the 1990 album Chemicrazy, produced by Scott Litt. Working with Litt, the band developed a more alt rock style than before, as hinted at on the final track of the previous album \\"Under the Sky\\". Although the album's song were more intense than previous work, Chemicrazy also maintained a pure pop heart, exemplified by singles \\"Sensitize\\", \\"Tingle\\" and \\"Hey Venus\\" (the former track sounding particularly R.E.M-esque). Frustratingly for the band, however, the massive predicted sales for Chemicrazy never happened. The album stalled at UK number 62 and its disappointing performance led to the end of the band's contract with Virgin Records. Independence: Fireproof and split After being dropped by Virgin, That Petrol Emotion also parted company with bassist John Marchini (he was replaced by Belfast-born Brendan Kelly) and set up their own record label, Koogat. Kelly's playing pushed That Petrol Emotion towards their heaviest, most riff-laden album to date - Fireproof, released in 1993 - which, like their debut, reached number 1 in the UK Indie Chart. However, despite the generally positive press coverage (and the loyal fan base they had garnered over ten years and five full-length albums), That Petrol Emotion were failing to attain the level of sustained commercial success, or popularity, enjoyed by contemporaries such as My Bloody Valentine and Sonic Youth. As a result, the band split amicably in 1994. A documentary of That Petrol Emotion's farewell concerts in London and Dublin was released posthumously in 2000 as Final Flame (Fire, Detonation And Sublime Chaos). Following the band's breakup, drummer Ciaran McLaughlin played jazz for a while\\"A whole lot of Everlasting Yeah! The Raymond Gorman interview ‚Äì part three\\" - interview by Malcolm Wyatt in writewyattuk, 20 August 2014 before switching to guitar and returning to work as a solo singer-songwriter. Singer Steve Mack returned to Seattle, where he would later play bass with Seattle pop-group Cantona and form Anodyne with fellow songwriter Harris Thurmond: an Anodyne album, Tensor, was released in 1998 (using the project name \\"Marfa Lights\\" in Europe). Raymond Gorman, Brendan Kelly and Damian O'Neill formed a new band called Wavewalkers in 1996, which played six shows in London, Derry and Paris before splitting up (Gorman would later resurrect the name for a solo project). In 2000, Damian O'Neill released a 12-inch single, \\"Higher Grace\\", on the Toy's Factory label (under the name of X-Valdez, featuring arrangements by Xavier Jamaux and vocals by Athena Constantine) and, in 2001, signed to Alan McGee's post Creation label Pop Tones in order to release the experimental electronic album A Quiet Revolution.Other Projects page on That Petrol Emotion homepage (hosted by The Wayback Machine) Former TPE guitarist and songwriting mainstay John O'Neill had already formed the intermittently active Northern Irish trip hop band Rare in 1990, scoring a hit single in 1996 with \\"Something Wild\\" and releasing a lone album, Peoplefreak, in 1998. In November 1999, the O'Neill brothers reunited in a reformed Undertones (with a new lineup minus estranged original frontman Feargal Sharkey) which continues to perform and release records to this day. Reunion On 26 March 2008, Steve Mack announced that That Petrol Emotion were reforming (in their Fireproof lineup) to play reunion concerts in the summer. In August 2008 the reunited band played London's The Boston Arms and Dundalk's Spirit Store, then went on to play at the Electric Picnic festival in Stradbally, Ireland. In March 2009 the band played at the South by Southwest festival in Austin, Texas. In the same month their official site confirmed that That Petrol Emotion would be playing the Hop Farm Festival in Kent, England in July 2009. Shortly afterwards a UK tour also in July 2009 was announced along with stints at Oxegen Festival in Ireland and T In The Park in Scotland. That Petrol Emotion continued their reformation with a spot at the My Bloody Valentine curated Nightmare Before Christmas All Tomorrow's Parties festival in December 2009, followed by dates in the UK and the US. Hiatus (2010-present) and spinoff band The Everlasting Yeah (2012-present) Since 2010, That Petrol Emotion have been on an indefinite hiatus, due to Steve Mack choosing to stay in Seattle and concentrate on parental duties.\\"That Parental Emotion\\" (Steve Mack posting on TPE homepage, 11 December 2010 - archived at The Wayback Machine) Gorman, McLaughlin, Kelly and Damian O'Neill continued working together (initially with the intention of carrying on with the existing band) but in 2012 announced that they had formed a new band named The Everlasting Yeah playing kosmische/Krautrock-influenced music. The new band's debut gig was in London in support of The June Brides, while their debut album - Anima Rising - was released on their own label Infinite Thrill in 2014. Via crowdfunding, Damian O'Neill recorded the Refit Revise Reprise album with new project The Monotones for release in 2018.Damian O'Neill & The Monotones Pledge Music page Legacy That Petrol Emotion's body of work remains critically acclaimed within the music press. It is widely agreed that, while never achieving chart success, the band left a lasting influence on the Britpop and Madchester movements, specifically on such artists such as The Stone Roses, Happy Mondays, Manic Street Preachers, Andrew Bird, Spoon, Blur and Radiohead. They were posthumously described as having perfected \\"the art of the scuzzed up alternative pop song\\" during the 1980s.

It is the second largest of the eleven Midriff Islands or Islas Grandes. It is part of the state of Baja California, located northwest of Tibur√≥n Island. The island is uninhabited, and is a biological reserve called Isla Angel de la Guarda National Park. The island is part of the Mexicali municipality. The geologically active Ballenas Fault runs along the seabed of the linear Canal de Ballenas. A 6.9 magnitude earthquake occurred on this fault in 2009. Geography The island is extremely dry, with no sources of freshwater other than washes following rainfall. It has an area of and a chain of mountains runs along its 69 km length, reaching a maximum of 1,300 meters (4,300 feet) above sea level. It runs northwest to southeast. The west coast is roughly straight in that direction, but the east coast runs inward near the middle before heading outward until it reaches the island's widest point. The coast then runs south for a while before finally returning to its southeasterly direction. Much of the island is inaccessible due to mountains at or near the shore, especially on the west coast. There are a few flat areas on the coast at the outlets of washes that were created by sediment. These alluvial fans are mostly on the east coast, but a large one is found on the west coast where the island narrows in the middle. Much of the island's geology is made up of volcanic and alluvial sand deposits. Biology Despite its extreme dryness, the island is relatively diverse in plant and animal life. There are many types of birds and reptiles, especially lizards. The Angel Island speckled rattlesnake (Crotalus angelensis) and Angel Island mouse (Peromyscus guardia) occur only on the island.

The first creation came into the Peerage of England in 1681 when the fourteen-year-old Sir George Carteret, 2nd Baronet, was made Baron Carteret, of Hawnes in the County of Bedford (now Haynes Park). The peerage was originally proposed for his grandfather Sir George Carteret, 1st Baronet, a celebrated royalist statesman, but he died before he was granted the title and as his eldest son, Philip, predeceased him, it was eventually bestowed on his grandson, George, with remainder to the latter's brothers. The Baronetcy, of Metesches in the Island of Jersey, had been created for George Carteret in the Baronetage of England on 9 May 1645. Lord Carteret married Lady Grace Granville, daughter of John Granville, 1st Earl of Bath. In 1715 Lady Grace was raised to the Peerage of Great Britain in her own right as Viscountess Carteret and Countess Granville (see Earl Granville for a more details on these two peerages). Lord Carteret and Lady Granville were both succeeded by their son John Carteret, the second Baron and second Earl. The titles became extinct on the death of the latter's son Robert Carteret, the third Earl, in 1776. However, the late Earl Granville bequeathed his lands to his nephew the Honourable Henry Thynne. he was the second son of Lady Louisa Carteret by her husband Thomas Thynne, 2nd Viscount Weymouth and was the younger brother of Thomas Thynne, 1st Marquess of Bath. In accordance with the terms of the legacy Henry Thynne assumed the surname and arms of Carteret in lieu of his patronymic and in 1784 was raised to the Peerage of Great Britain as Baron Carteret, of Hawnes in the County of Bedford, with remainder to the younger sons of his brother, the Marquess of Bath. He was succeeded according to the special remainder by his nephew George Thynne, the second Baron. He notably served as Comptroller of the Household between 1804 and 1812. He was childless and was succeeded by his younger brother John Thynne, the third Baron (who like his elder brother the second Baron had retained the original family surname of Thynne). He held political office as Vice-Chamberlain of the Household between 1804 and 1812. He also had no children and the title became extinct on his death in 1849.

The site is located south of Mohenjo Daro on Hyderabad-Dadu Road more than 100 kilometres north of Hyderabad, Pakistan. Archaeology This site had multi-level structures, although it was never a big city. Amri culture is named after the site. Pre-Harappan stage Situated near the foothills of Kirthar Mountains, this was an important earlier urban center in Lower Sindh. Amri is close to Balochistan where development of earlier farming communities from 6000 BC to 4000 BC ultimately led to urbanization. The ancient mounds of 8 hectares on the west bank of Indus River have been extensively excavated. The earliest phase was a fortified town that flourished from 3600 to 3300 BC, and belonged to the Pre- Harappan stage of the Indus Valley Civilization. Amri is dated after Rehman Dheri. The pottery discovered here had its own characteristics and is known as Amri Ware. Sohr Damb (Nal) is a related site in Balochistan to the west of Amri. Their pottery is sometimes collectively described as 'Amri-Nal ware'. Like other Pre Harappa towns, no writings were found at this site. Evidence indicates widespread fire at the town around 2500 BCE. Later phases In period II (ca. 2750-2450 BC), more and more elements of Indus Valley culture appear. Period III (ca. 2450-1900 BC) belongs almost entirely to Indus Valley culture. Period IV (ca. 1900-1300 BC) is marked by the mingling of cultural traditions. Elements of the Jhukar culture appear, and co-exist with the last phase of the Indus Valley culture. Later, the elements of Jhangar culture appear. Period V is Muslim and dated much later. Based on the evidence from this site, Indus culture was probably not developed directly from Amri culture. Also, at least at this location, rather than suddenly being replaced by the Amri culture, there was a co-existence of both cultures.

It involves humanity's contact with a number of alien species with conflicting interests and beliefs, while her central character, Shan Frankland, is caught in the middle of a coming conflict. All six novels have been published by Eos, an imprint of HarperCollins: City of Pearl, Crossing the Line, The World Before, Matriarch and Ally (formerly Task Force). The last book of the series, Judge was released on March 25, 2008. Volumes *City of Pearl (2004) *Crossing the Line (2005) *The World Before (2005) *Matriarch (2006) *Ally (formerly Task Force) (2007) *Judge (2008) Featured alien species * Bezeri: first seen in City of Pearl. The bezeri are native to the planet Bezer'ej in the Cavanagh's Star system. They are aquatic creatures whom humans liken to squid. They communicate primarily by bioluminescence. Living underwater and thus without access to fire, their technology is at the neolithic level, although with some biotechnology based on selective breeding; the latter has allowed them to build \\"podships\\" for faster underwater travel, and for hurling small numbers of explorers out of the water to investigate (briefly) what they term the \\"Dry Above\\". * Wess'har: first seen in City of Pearl. Humanoid in appearance, with heads that humans liken to seahorses and with distinctive four-lobed pupils. Their sense of smell is more acute than that of humans, and pheromonal signals play a greater role in their interactions. Their culture is matriarchal, with matriarchs establishing a hierarchy through emission of the jask pheromone. In their ethical system, motive is considered irrelevant when judging the rightness of actions; only outcomes are considered important. Ecological balance is a primary value of wess'har society; they take great pains to minimize their environmental footprint and do not consider sentient creatures to have more rights than nonsentient ones. :The wess'har that the Earth expedition first encounters have been living on Wess'ej, Bezer'ej's moon (itself a fully habitable world), for thousands of years, following the philosophy of the thinker Targassat, who believed in the supreme importance of non-intervention in the affairs of other species except in extreme cases. In The World Before they meet wess'har from Eqbas Vorhi (\\"The World Before\\"), the species' homeworld five light-years from Cavanagh's Star. The eqbas believe in unsolicited intervention to preserve planetary ecologies and have done so many times. They consider the Wess'ej wess'har to be agrarian primitivists, even though wess'har technology is fantastically advanced compared to humanity's. * Isenj: first seen in City of Pearl. The isenj are native to the planet Umeh in the Cavanagh's Star system; they also live on Umeh's habitable moon Tasir Var, and once had colonies on Bezer'ej and possibly worlds in other star systems. Humans liken them to spiders, although they have more than eight legs, and their primeval ancestors appear to have occupied an ecological niche similar to that of termites on Earth. They possess a genetic memory which lets them remember the experiences of their ancestors, and which has profound effects on their psychology and culture. Talented engineers, the isenj have constructed an interstellar instantaneous communication network, based on quantum mechanical principles, which humans refer to as \\"ITX\\". They are either unable or unwilling to control their population growth, to the extent that at the time of the novels, Umeh's land area has been completely urbanized with the only other life present on the planet being food organisms grown industrially. * Ussissi: first seen in City of Pearl. The ussissi co-evolved with the wess'har on Eqbas Vorhi and expanded into space with them. Humans liken them to meerkats or ferrets in appearance. The ussissi play many support roles in both wess'har cultures and are especially valued as interpreters, as they are talented mimics of alien sounds and excel at learning languages. In the Cavanagh's Star system the ussissi pilot spacecraft between the inhabited worlds, and also between Umeh's continents and Tasir Var. * Skavu: first seen in Ally. The skavu are native to the planet Garav, about four light-months away from Cavanagh's Star. Garav was the subject of a rather bloody eqbas ecological intervention, and the surviving skavu are fanatical about preserving ecological balance to the point of cheerfully slaughtering entire populations to bring it about. Humanoid in form, humans liken their features to a mix of iguanas and seals. * C'naatat: first seen in City of Pearl. C'naatat is a microscopic organism native to Bezer'ej, which, when it infects other species, forms a symbiotic relationship that grants many powerful traits to the host organism: aging stops, wounds heal very quickly, and adaptation to many different extreme environments becomes possible. This results in the host being virtually immortal and unkillable except by being blown to pieces with explosives. C'naatat strains can transfer biological traits of the organisms they have passed through to their new hosts (for example, granting the ability to emit wess'har pheromones, bezeri bioluminescence, or a shared memory like that of the isenj). The organism is also able to defend itself from attempts to remove it from a host - it improvises countermeasures that render the removal attempt ineffective.

It is located about 480 km west of Karachi on the Makran coast near Gwadar, close to the Iranian border, in Pakistan's Baluchistan Province. The site is near the western bank of the Dasht River and its confluence with a smaller stream, known as the Gajo Kaur. It was a smaller settlement with substantial stone walls and gateways. Excavations Sutkagan Dor was discovered in 1875 by Major Edward Mockler, who conducted small-scale excavation. In 1928 Aurel Stein visited the area as part of his Gedrosia tour, and carried out further digs. In October 1960, Sutkagan Dor was more extensively excavated by George F. Dales as a part of his Makran Survey, uncovering structures made from stone and mud bricks without straw. Architecture This site measures approximately 4.5 hectares (300 √ó 150 m). Along with the typical \\"citadel\\" and \\"lower town\\", there is a massive fortification wall of semi-dressed stones. This citadel wall varies in height and thickness due to the irregular contours of the natural rock foundation, but at one point about midway along the eastern wall, it is approximately 7.5 m thick at the base. The inner face of the wall is slightly battered, whereas the outer face has a decided slope, varying from 23¬∞ to 40¬∞. Coastal route Though inland at present, the site may have been near navigable water in ancient times, on a trade route between other centers. A coastal route existed linking sites such as Lothal and Dholavira to Sutkagan Dor on the Makran coast. It has been suggested that the site may well have been an important trading post, connecting seaborne trade from the Persian Gulf and the Arabian Sea to the hinterland. Findings Stein recovered 127 flint blades without cores measuring up to 27.5 cm. Stone vessels, stone arrowheads, copper arrowheads, shell beads, pottery, and various other items were found. A copper-bronze disc probably associated with the Bactria‚ÄìMargiana Archaeological Complex (BMAC) was also discovered there.

This game is an example of a ‚Äúfully observable‚Äù system that has an element of chance introduced by the roll of special dice and an element of strategy (the strategy being the pawn the player decides to move after the roll of the dice). While traditionally played with 4 or 6 cowry shells, dice can also be used. History The game of Chowka Bhara is one of the oldest board games extant, still being played in certain parts of India.A person can make a gatii when a person as a single pon.There are references of this game in some ancient Indian epics like the Mahabharata. Names This game is called by various names in different languages in different regions of India. This list shows the name, the language and then the region: *Chauka Bara - Kannada - Mysuru region *Katte Mane - Kannada - Rural Mysuru *Gatta Mane - Kannada - Rural Mysuru *Chakaara or Chakka - Kannada - North Karnataka *Pakidakali - Malayalam - Kerala region *Ashta Chamma - Telugu - Andhra Pradesh/Telangana *Daayam or Thaayam - Tamil - Tamil Nadu *Atthu (‡§Ö‡§ü‡•ç‡§†‡•Ç) - Hindi - Madhya Pradesh *Kanna Kauri (‡§ï‡§®‡•ç‡§®‡§æ ‡§ï‡•å‡§°‡§º‡•Ä) - Hindi - Jabalpur,Madhya Pradesh *Kavidi Kali - Malayalam - Kerala *Chunga (‡§ö‡§Ç‡§ó‡§æ) - Hindi - Madhya Pradesh * Champool/ Kach kangri - Marathi - Maharashtra *Ahmedabad Baji - Gujarati *Chomal Ishto - Gujarati *Kaangi chaala - Gujarati *Changa po - Rajasthan *Cheeta - Madhya Pradesh *Chanda - Madhya Pradesh Teri chowk- Chhattisgarh Setup Chowka bhara normally has a 5x5 square board and four players, but one can also increase the number of squares depending on the number of players to any odd number squared (for example, 11x11). Assuming the size of the board is NxN (with N being odd), then each player will have N-1 pawns. Example of a chowka bhara board showing the path of Player 1. The 5x5 version is shown in the example diagram. Four players each have four pawns, starting at different positions at the four crossed squares at the outermost ring. Play Cowrie shells used as dice, though in this picture six were thrown instead of the four used in this game. Shows three as is and three inverted. The game is controlled by throwing four cowry shells and counting how many are 'as it is' versus those that land 'inverted': if all four shells land inverted it is called \\"chamma\\" and if all land as it is then it is called an \\"ashta\\". Each player takes a turn to roll the cowrie shells. The mouth of the shell landing upwards has a value of 1 and downwards has a value of 0. However, if every shell shows a value of 0, then the value of the roll is 4 and if all of them shows a value of 1, then the value of the roll is 8. Therefore, the possible values are 1, 2, 3, 4 and 8. Casting 4 or 8 gives the player an additional turn, which can continue until that player rolls a number other than 4 or 8 (namely 1, 2, or 3). Depending on the number rolled, the player can move one (or more) of their pawns that many number of squares on the board. Each player has a fixed path to move pawns, which is in an anti- clockwise direction. The path for Player 1 is given in the example diagram. Each player's piece must completely traverse the outer squares before moving into the inner squares. The tokens enter the board only after a Chamma or Ashta is thrown. Since each cowrie carry 2 points, 2 tokens for Chamma and 4 tokens for Ashta are entered on the board. The tokens travel anti-clockwise in outer squares, clockwise in inner squares and finally lands up in central square (home), with a throw of Ashta or Chamma. If a player's token lands on a square occupied by opponent's token, then the opponent's token is \\"killed\\" and the player gets an extra turn to play. The killed token returns to its starting home square and has to go round all over again. In crossed boxes, killing is not possible. When a token reaches the square left of its home square, it further moves up into the inner squares and now moves in clockwise direction. However the tokens enter the inner squares, only when at least one of the opponent's tokens are killed. Otherwise they keep circling around until at least one of the tokens of opponent is killed by them. Every token need not kill an opponent. Each token finishes its race when it manages to get into the home. The first player to get all his tokens into home wins the game. Whenever a Chamma or an Ashta (4 or 8) is obtained during a throw of cowry shells, the player gets a bonus turn to throw the cowries. When a player cuts an opponent's token, he gets an extra turn to play. During an extra turn, either the same token or some other token can be played. If a player throws either a Chamma or an Ashta three times consecutively during his turn, he is out, and cannot use any of the moves. If a player has cut once, all the coins can move into the inner circle, not necessary for every coin to cut opponent. When most of the tokens are dead, it is possible to bring back the dead tokens. For Ashta, 2 tokens and for Chamma 1 token can be brought back. Cowries and their values: *3 as it is, 1 inverted - Move 1 square *2 as it is, 2 inverted - Move 2 squares *3 inverted, 1 as it is - Move 3 squares *4 inverted Chamma - Move 4 squares *4 as it is Ashta - Move 8 squares In Senior board (8x4=32) tokens of four distinct colors are used. Since each cowry carries 1 point, 4 tokens for Chamma and 8 tokens for Ashta are entered on the board. The rules of playing Senior board is same as that of Junior board. When most of the tokens are dead, it is possible to bring back the dead tokens. For 8, 1 token, for Ashta, 4 tokens and for Chamma 2 tokens can be brought back Cases when cowries are cast: *1 inverted and 7 as it is; move 1 square & In some places there is no move of 1. If you throw 1 inverted and 7 as it is ; you move 11 squares and this is also a bonus chance. *2 inverted and 6 as it is; move 2 squares ; & In some places a player can move Two tokens opposite of the closing square and by throwing 2 one can declare Two tokens finishing the race. As 1 doesn't exist. But making two tokens stand opposite the clearance square also puts the player at higher risk as the opponent can kill two tokens at one time and they have to do the whole race again. *3 inverted and 5 as it is; move 3 squares *4 inverted and 4 as it is; move 4 squares *5 inverted and 3 as it is; move 5 squares *6 inverted and 2 as it is; move 6 squares *7 inverted and 1 as it is; move 7 squares. If one gets 7 he cannot kill an opponent token by this move and can only carry on a movement normal. *8 inverted Chamma; move 4 squares Or Is considered as 12 and gets a bonus to throw again. In ashta chamma played by Telugu people of Andhra Pradesh. *8 as it is Ashta; move 8 squares *8 inverted drakshi move 16 squares Objective of the game For a player to win, he/she must move all their pawns to the center square. Rules This game has several intricate rules which need to be followed. Although there are several variations of this game, the following rules are for the standard implementation. 1\\\\. A player casts the shells to determine the number of square his/her pawns can move. If a player has cast 1,2 or 3, then he/she needs to choose one of their pawns and move it that many squares along the path designated for that player. The player needs to be able to smartly choose a pawn to move, so that it optimizes his chance of winning the game. If a player has cast either a 4 or an 8, the player will have another turn to cast the dice. The player does not have to move any of his pawns until he has cast 1, 2, or 3. For example, if a player casts a 4, he will get another chance to roll the dice. If on the second turn he gets a 3, then the player can move one of his pawns 4 squares and one of his other pawns 3 squares. He can of course choose to move the same pawn (4+3) 7 squares if he wants to. This argument can be extended to the player getting 3 or more consecutive turns. 2\\\\. \\"Hit\\": Pawns of two players cannot exist in the same square, other than a \\"Safe\\" square, which are marked with an X in the figure. For a 5x5 board this is simply the starting positions of each of the players and the center square. However, for higher dimension boards, more safe squares can be added symmetrically across the board. So if the pawn of player X lands on the same square of a pawn of player Y, then player X has \\"hit\\" player Y. Player Y's pawn is returned to its starting square and this pawn needs to start over. For a player's pawn to progress into the inner squares, he should have \\"hit\\" at least one of his opponent's pawns. This condition is imposed on the player and not on his pawn. For example, even if one of the player's pawns has hit one of the opponent's, then all his other pawns will be eligible to enter the inner square. If it so happens that a player cannot move any of his pawns because he has not \\"hit\\" any of his opponents, then the player will lose that turn. 3\\\\. \\"Double\\": It is possible for a player to have two of his pawns in the same square. This is called a \\"double\\". If a player forms a double on the outer square, then it blocks the opponent's pawns behind him for one move; i.e. if an opponent's pawn crosses the double, then that move is voided and the opponent loses a turn. However, on the next turn for the same opponent, his pawn can go past (or \\"cross\\") the double. This rule is applicable for every opponent of the player in the game. This rule is not valid once the double is formed on the inner squares. For the player forming the double, there are two choices on his subsequent moves. He can \\"break\\" the double by moving only one of the pawns in it, or keep the double and advance the pawns together. In case a player has got multiple turns (as he may have thrown 4s and 8s), he can treat the double as one pawn and make it move to one of the values on the dice. 4\\\\. Double vs Single: It is not possible for a single pawn to \\"hit\\" a double. A player cannot move his single pawn to the same square as an opponent's double. A player cannot move past an opponent's double for 1 move. However, a double can \\"hit\\" a single pawn, and make it move back to its home square. If 2 singles are in the same square,then the double can \\"hit\\" only one of the singles.the other single is not affected at all. 5\\\\. Reaching the central square: A pawn needs to reach the central square exactly. For example, if a pawn is 3 squares away from the center and the player throws a 4, then that pawn cannot be moved. If that is the only pawn left for the player to move (which may be because of a variety of reasons such as being blocked by double, or by virtue of being the last pawn left), the player will lose his turn. Tools * Four pawns per players (Maximum players - 4, Minimum players - 2) * Four tamarind seeds or four shells or a dice * Piece of chalk * An even surface for the board and to roll the dice (draw 5x5 square on the plane space) Popular culture Ashta Chamma plays a pivotal role in the 2006 Indian art house film Vanaja.

It lies 15 minutes by bus from the centre of Birmingham and comprises 63 acres (25 hectares) of landscaped grass slopes, including a large boating lake and a smaller pond fed by the Farcroft and Grove Brooks, flower beds, mature trees and shrubs with a diversity of wildlife, adjoining St. Mary's Church, Handsworth to the north, containing the graves of the fathers of the Industrial Revolution, James Watt, Matthew Boulton and William Murdoch, and the founders of Aston Villa Football Club and the Victoria Jubilee Allotments site to the south opened on 12 June 2010. The completion of a ¬£9.5 million restoration and rejuvenation of Handsworth Park was celebrated with a Grand Re-Opening Celebration led by Councillor Mike Sharpe, the Lord Mayor of Birmingham, speaking from the restored bandstand at 2.00pm on Saturday 8 July 2006, followed by a count down by a large enthusiastic crowd and the release of clouds of confetti; in the words of one observer \\"Great wedding! Now we must make the marriage a success.\\" Founding 1904 OS map St Mary's glebe before the ParkHandsworth Victoria Park was founded in the 1880s by the Handsworth Local Sanitary Board - a body instituted by the government, and led by locally elected citizens, to oversee the supply of clean water and the laying down of sewers for the growing population of the area. As the Civic Gospel of municipal improvement spread from centre of Birmingham into the growing suburban estates of Handsworth, its local government leaders saw a public park as a benefit for the district. Following the setting up of an education board and a free library, the adoption and proper kerbing of roads, street lighting, tramways and the construction of sewers, influential voices in the district began to speak of the need for a 'lung' in the city. They did not pursue this idea simply out of expediency or to raise the value of their properties. Such self-interest was present - used unashamedly to strengthen their case among the practically minded citizens of Handsworth - but opposition to the Park from that quarter was at times so intense that calculative motives alone would not have carried the project through. The first part of Handsworth Park was laid out to the west of the original London and North Western RailwayLondon and North Western Railway Society and was opened on 25 December 1890 despite initial opposition. At a public meeting in the council offices off Soho Road on 11 January 1887, the Rector of St. Mary's Church, Handsworth Dr. Randall, who could be seen as the voice of receding rural Staffordshire against the spreading metropolis of Birmingham, rose amid the uproar to make what the Handsworth News reporter, with irony, called the speech of the evening: \\"Allow me to say that from my heart I am the last man in the parish to stand between any object which is for the welfare of the people of the parish. It is because I don't think it is for the well-being that we should have the park that I lift up my voice against it. We have an agricultural parish, and we have some of the finest air in the kingdom, and I believe that the park will be more for the benefit of the roughs of Birmingham.\\" This view was described by the reporter as being received with \\"a perfect howl of dissent, uproar for at least a minute and cries of 'shame' followed by alternations of groaning and cheering\\". (Baddeley 1997) The park is divided into two parts by a working railway line and was the site of Handsworth Wood railway station until 1942. Its western half was landscaped by the award-winning landscape architect Richard Hartland Vertegans who had a liking for broad tree-lined boulevards leading visitors to unexpected prospects. Far from being a disadvantage, the railway running through the completed park would prove consistent with Vertegan's intention, since, to this day, there are people who speak of \\"never having been to the other side of the park\\". The eastern side of Handsworth Park - Victoria Park Extension - was laid out 10 years later under the supervision of the local surveyor, Edwin Kenworthy, by the new Handsworth Urban District Council on St. Mary's glebe- land, with the support of a new vicar, the Rev. Prebendary Hodgson, and amid a steady downpour of rain declared \\"open to the people for ever\\" by the 6th Earl of Dartmouth on 30 March 1898. The completed park contains a cricket ground, pavilion, leisure centre - built on the remains of Grove House whose estate was bought to create the original park - a children's play-area, a small distinctive building previously used by the 'Sons of Rest' movement founded by Lister Muff in 1927, small monuments and a bandstand built at the Lion Foundry of Kirkintilloch, near Glasgow. Over the railway bridge you will find a large peaceful looking lake surrounded by plenty of wildlife and flowerbeds filled with colour. Just by the lake there is a new Boathouse. The boats were reintroduced to the lake in June 2009. Thanks to The Handsworth Park Association and a local resident (Mark Bent), The Boathouse has a cafe and is open to the public 7 days a week. The Park has a zero tolerance policy and its well patrolled by the park rangers and local police. The park was incorporated, with the old Handsworth Urban District - successor to the Handsworth Sanitary Board - into Birmingham City Council in 1911 and was the venue, for many years, of the Birmingham Flower Show and other citywide and national events including dog shows, Girl Guides' and Boy Scout Jamboree. The Civic Society GardenIn 1922 The Birmingham Civic Society designed and paid for the creation of a new formal garden which they called a \\"Sunk Garden\\" near the Grove Lane entrance. The site of the garden was previously an irregular hollow, but the executed design carries on the axial line of the park entrance and featured as its centrepiece a bronze sculpture of a child holding a lamb atop a Portland stone plinth. This was meant to symbolise the historic use of the land as glebe land. The statue was unveiled on 15 January 1937 and was designed by John P. Walker. Unfortunately it was stolen in 1988 and has not been recovered. For more information on the sculpture, follow the Public Monuments & Sculpture Association link below on External Links From the 1970s the Handsworth Carnival (now removed to Perry Park, Perry Barr, as Birmingham International Carnival, having been said by the acting Head of Parks to have \\"outgrown Handsworth Park\\") and later the festival of Vaisakhi. Neglect, rediscovery and restoration Winter in Handsworth Park From the 1970s Handsworth Park, like many across the UK, was increasingly neglected, though needed by, happily remembered, respected and enjoyed by citizens from the diverse communities of Sandwell, Handsworth, Soho & Perry Barr, as well as visitors from further afield. In 1994 a group of local people began to campaign against a plan to build on the site of the old swimming pool, demolition of one of the last 'Sons of Rest' building in the city - most others being already demolished with the exception of the one in Cannon Hill Park - and the sale and development of the Victoria Jubilee Allotments site next to the park. Originally called 'Save Handsworth Park', the group renamed itself the 'Handsworth Park Association', when it became clear that the park was to be improved and cared for. From then on members of this group worked in consultation with the City Council's Landscape Practice Group on plans for the restoration of Handsworth Park. The objectives of the Association are: a) to preserve Handsworth Park for the benefit of the community locally and in the surrounding area. (b) to promote the educational use of the park. c) to encourage a general appreciation of the history, flora and wildlife of the Park. The park from the air, in 2008. St Mary's Church is bottom-right Consultant for Birmingham City Council, Dr Hilary Taylor, observed: > There is no doubt that Handsworth Park is a successful design, one where > everything from the basic landform to the elements of planting and ornament > were the outcome of careful consideration, both of the site and the > requirements of the local community.

The value of parks in cities was once again acknowledged by politicians. Amid the slow burning social fragmentation of Britain's post-industrial Midlands, Handsworth Park, with other parks across the city, was being placed on a par with local housing, education, health and policing as part of what made the area a place where people might actually desire to live and work.

The ecoregion covers an area of , and despite its name, comprise not only the state of Meghalaya, but also parts of southern Assam, and a tiny bit of Nagaland around Dimapur. It also contains many other habitats than subtropical forests, but the montane subtropical forests found in Meghalaya is an important biome, and was once much more widespread in the region, and for these reasons chosen as the most suitable name.Note: The Meghalaya subtropical forests [IM0126] ecoregion was chosen by the World Wildlife Fund (WWF) to be almost identical to the previous biogeographical unit North-East Hills (19b) from The scientific designation is IM0126. The Meghalaya subtropical forests are part of the larger Indo-Burma biological hotspot with many endemic species not found anywhere else in the world. Together with the Western Ghats, Northeast India are the only two regions of India, endowed with rainforest. For these, and other, reasons, protection and conservation of the Meghalaya subtropical forests are important on a local, national, regional and even global level. The ecoregion is one of the most species-rich areas in India, with a rich diversity of birds, mammals, and plants in particular. The lowlands holds mostly tropical forests, while the hills and mountains, that comprise most of the area, are covered in grasslands and several distinct types of forest habitats, including subtropical moist broadleaf forests in some of the montane areas above 1,000 metres. The region is one of the wettest areas in the world, with some places, notably Mawsynram and Cherrapunji in the south of Meghalaya, receiving up to eleven meters of rain in a year. The Brahmaputra Valley semi-evergreen forests ecoregion lies to the north, the Mizoram-Manipur-Kachin rain forests ecoregion lies to the east, and the Lower Gangetic Plains moist deciduous forests ecoregion lies to the west and south in Bangladesh. Flora Fog and mist are persistent in these continuously moist forests The elevated and damp forest ecoregion is a center of diversity for the tree genera Magnolia and Michelia, and the families Elaeocarpaceae and Elaeagnaceae. Over 320 species of orchids are native to Meghalaya. The endemic pitcher plant (Nepenthes khasiana) is now an endangered species. About 3,128 flowering plant species have been reported from the state, of which 1,236 are endemic.Khan et al., 1997 In the later half of the 1800s, Joseph Dalton Hooker, a British botanist and explorer, made a huge taxonomic collection for the Kew Herbarium from Khasi and Jaintia Hills and remarked the place as one of the richest biodiversity spots in India, perhaps in all of Asia as well.Hooker, 1872-97 Meghalaya state is rich in medicinal plant species, but the natural occurrence of most medicinal plants has decreased due to habitat loss. A total of 131 RET (Rare, Endemic and Threatened) medicinal plant species, including 36 endemic and 113 species under different threat categories, are found within Meghalaya.Mir et al., 2014 As in other rural areas of India, Meghalaya villages have an ancient tradition of nurturing sacred groves. These are sacred spots within the forest where medicinal and other valued plants are grown and harvested sustainably, and they present a very high biodiversity. In Meghalaya these sacred groves are known as Law Kyntang or Law Lyngdoh.

Fauna There is a rich diversity of birds in these forests. Several types of Hornbills are here (Rufous-necked hornbill). The Western hoolock gibbon is the only ape in India, and they are dependent on these forests. The montane ecoregion is home to a diverse mix of birds, with a total of 659 species recorded as of 2017. Some of the birds living here are endemic to the Indo- Burma ecoregion, and quite a few species are threatened or near threatened on a global scale. Of these, two kinds of vultures, the Oriental White-backed Vulture and the Slender-billed Vulture, are both in need of extra protection as critically endangered species near extinction. The Meghalaya forests are not only important as a wildlife refuge for birds, it is also important to migratory birds on their long-distance flights. The subtropical forests presents a diverse range of reptiles, with as much as 56 species of known snakes, in addition to several lizards and turtles. The Tokay Gecko, among the largest geckos in the world, are here, as are three different kinds of monitor lizards, all of them to be protected since 1972, and a new species of skink (sphenomorphus apalpebratus) was discovered in the forests as late as 2013. Both Brahminy Blind snake and Copperhead Rat Head are among the more common snakes encountered in the forests, but there are several venomous and deadly serpents too, such as the Green Pit viper and the King Cobra, the longest venomous snake in the world. Many of the snake species here are elusive (and rare), such as the Cherrapunji keelback, Khasi keelback or Khasi earth snake. The damp and moist environment of the Meghalaya forests also supports what is the most diverse range of amphibians in North-east India, with a total of 33 recorded species living here. The two frog species Shillong bush frog and Khasi Hill toad are endemic, and both rare and threatened. Molluscs are thriving in the moist conditions and are abundant throughout, both on land and in the water, As much as 223 species has been recorded by science, and many of the land-dwelling molluscs are endemic to Meghalaya. Fresh water molluscs are generally considered a good indicator species of clean waters, and Meghalaya's waterways are home to 35 species, with a lot of paludomus-snails in the hill streams. Several types of fresh water snails are part of the hill tribes diet, including the large bellamya bengalensis snails. Situated between the mighty Brahmaputra in the north and the Barak River to the south, Meghalaya's many waterways are also home to a diverse range of fish species. 152 known species has been observed as of 2017. Two types of mahseer (neolissochilus and tor) are fished for sport. The subtropical forests are home to 110 species of mammals, none of which are endemic. By far, most of these species comprise smaller mammals, in particular bats and small carnivores, and the population of large mammals is comparatively sparse. The Western hoolock gibbons in the forests of Meghalaya are globally endangered, and also threatened in this particular habitat, but they have a special place among the local tribes who cherish their song. Other large mammals important to conservation here includes the tiger (Panthera tigris), clouded leopard (Pardofelis nebulosa), Asian elephant (Elephas maximus), dhole or Asiatic wild dog (Cuon alpinus), sun bear (Ursus malayanus), sloth bear (Melursus ursinus), smooth-coated otter (Lutrogale perspicillata), Indian civet (Viverra zibetha), Chinese pangolin (Manis pentadactyla), Indian pangolin (Manis crassicaudata), Assamese macaque (Macaca assamensis), bear macaque (Macaca arctoides), and capped leaf monkey (Semnopithecus pileatus).

In addition, Meghalaya holds a total of 712.74 km2 reserved forest and 12.39 km2 protected forest. * Balphakram National Park, a large national park in south Garo Hills * Nokrek National Park, in east Garo Hills * Nongkhyllem Wildlife Sanctuary * Siju Wildlife Sanctuary, a bird sanctuary * Narpuh Wildlife SanctuaryNote: Narpuh Wildlife Sanctuary was created in 2015 but is rarely presented as a wildlife sanctuary, perhaps because of local opposition. * Baghmara Pitcher Plant Sanctuary, a small sanctuary park of 2 hectares Some of the reserved forest is used by locals for voluntary wildlife reserves, in particular to help save the threatened Hoolock Gibbons. Other parts of the reserved forest are maintained as wildlife corridors, for elephants for example, and to safeguard against damaging habitat fragmentation. Related parks and gardens  The nature and wildlife of Meghalaya, and the montane rainforests of the ecoregion in particular, is of interest to the tourist industry in the area, and to cater for these interests, an Eco Park has been created in Cherrapunjee. Several waterfalls and caves of the region are also of interest to nature loving tourists. The state of Meghalaya maintains a total of three botanical gardens, all three are in the capital of Shillong.  Conservation status  The Meghalaya subtropical forest ecoregion is part of the larger Indo-Burma biological hotspot with many endemic species not found anywhere else in the world. Together with the Western Ghats, Northeast India are the only two regions of India, endowed with rainforest. For these, and other, reasons, protection and conservation of the Meghalaya subtropical forests are important on a local, national, regional and even global level. As seen in other rainforests of the world, deforestation occurs on an alarming scale in Meghalaya too, with accelerated clearcutting for agriculture, industry, mining and infrastructure projects since the 1990s. Apart from the obvious loss of primary forest, this has also caused local problems with soil erosion and fragmentation of habitats. The clearcut areas in Meghalaya are sometimes allowed to regrow, but the second-growth forests are much less species-rich (both flora and fauna), than the original forest. In addition to these problematic issues, the dense forest habitats of Meghalaya are also dwindling because of tree thinning. This forestry practise puts extra pressure on species that can only thrive in dense forests. The root motivation for the increase in these environmentally changing practises are thought to be a high population growth and increased industrial activity in Meghalaya.

It is currently on the United States Fish and Wildlife Service list of endangered species. The rat grows to 260 grams and feeds on fruit, leaves and buds. It has a gray-brown back and white belly, chest, and throat, and a hairy tail. Only 6500 animals were thought to remain in North Key Largo in the late 1980s. Taxonomy Although a 1923 article described woodrat nests on Key Largo, the form was not scientifically described until 1955, when H.B. Sherman described it as Neotoma floridana smalli, a subspecies of the widespread eastern woodrat (Neotoma floridana). In 1987, Lazell suggested that it is distinct enough to be considered a separate species, but this proposal has not been accepted. The mitochondrial DNA of Key Largo woodrats is distinct by at least 0.6% from that of the most similar subspecies, the Florida woodrat (Neotoma floridana floridana) from further north in Florida, but members of that subspecies differ about as much from each other as from the Key Largo woodrat. Description The Key Largo woodrat is similar to the Florida woodrat (Neotoma floridana floridana) and cannot be distinguished from it in size or external anatomy. It differs in the shape of the sphenopalatine vacuities (openings in the roof of the mesopterygoid fossa, the gap behind the palate), which are narrower and shorter than in N. f. floridana. On average, males are a bit larger than females. In the holotype, an adult male, total length is , tail length , hindfoot length , ear length , dimensions of the testis , and mass is . Distribution and habitat The animal is found exclusively in the northern part of Key Largo, at least 210 km removed from its nearest kin, the Florida woodrat. It is endemic to the tropical hardwood hammocks of Key Largo, where its habitat has shrunk by half since the 1920s, and the remainder is fragmented, thinned, and developed. It retains some 850 ha, most of which is in the Dagny Johnson Key Largo Hammock Botanical State Park and the adjacent Crocodile Lake National Wildlife Refuge. Behaviour=Shelter The Key Largo woodrat builds nests out of sticks; these nests can be as high as a man's shoulder. They are handed down from generation to generation, and some are possibly centuries old. Conservation Since the Key Largo woodrat has a small and specific habitat, it is susceptible to human encroachment. Since the 1920s, it has lost almost half of its traditional habitat. In the early 1980s, biologists began equipping rats with radio devices to count them and study them; by the end of the 1980s, a study showed that the rat had disappeared from Key Largo proper and its total population had dwindled to some 6500 animals on North Key Largo. Its fate in Key Largo was tied to that of the American Crocodile, and when a planned reservation for the crocodile in North Key Largo bogged down during the presidential transition in the US Administration in 1980, the woodrat was threatened with extinction; the crocodile reservation was to be a haven for the woodrat, and also for the rare Schaus Swallowtail butterfly. A project called Port Bougainville, with 15 hotels besides condos, would add 45,000 inhabitants to North Key Largo by the year 2000, adding to the pressure on the crocodile and other animals. The project, which by 1982 included a planned 2806 units, ran into opposition from environmental groups and by 1984 had ground to a halt after one of the investors withdrew a $54 million investment. in 1983 already, the administration had intervened and declared the Key Largo woodrat and the Key Largo cotton mouse endangered on a \\"temporary emergency basis\\"; the developer of a golf course, for instance, was ordered to restore the area he was illegally developing, to preserve the woodrat's habitat. Since 1984, the Key Largo woodrat is on the United States list of endangered species, along with the Schaus Swallowtail and the Key Largo Cotton Mouse. By the 1990s, the animal's habitat had shrunk to about three square miles, and the Key Largo woodrat was called \\"one of the rarest creatures on earth.\\" The animal also suffers from competition with the infamous Rattus rattus. As of 2005, the Key Largo woodrat population was still struggling to survive among the half-built condominiums of the former Port Bougainville project, which in 2003 became part of the Dagny Johnson Key Largo Hammock Botanical State Park. of the developer's land were bought up by the Federal Deposit Insurance Corporation in 1987; the Botanical State Park now takes up . Besides in this area, the rat finds refuge in the Crocodile Lake National Wildlife Refuge, which has a captive breeding program currently in operation but increasing development continues to threaten the animal. Cultural importance alt=A rat, brownish above and white below, sitting on a nearly vertical stem within dense vegetation. The threat to many threatened species but especially the woodrat and the cotton mouse generated broad interest in the Florida Keys in the 1980s, with many environmental groups being formed. Anna Dagny Johnson (1918‚Äì2003), a well-known environmentalist, led efforts by the Upper Keys Citizens Association, Friends of the Everglades, and the Izaak Walton League to stop development around North Key Largo; the Florida Division of Recreation and Parks honored her by naming the Dagny Johnson Key Largo Hammock Botanical State Park for her, a year before she died. The rat's habit of building large nests (\\"4ft by 6ft homes\\") was seen as proof that \\"even wildlife in Florida want enormous homes.\\" Novelist Lydia Millet paid homage to the woodrat in her 2008 novel How the Dead Dream, a story of a young real estate developer from Los Angeles who, after some personal turmoil, takes an obsessive interest in vanishing species. A 1997 collection of poetry and prose by a writers cooperative from Key West features a poem (\\"The Place We Live\\" by Robin Orlandi) in which the woodrat is mentioned as one of three \\"endangered native species,\\" alongside the Key deer and the Stock Island Snail, Orthalicus reses reses.

Victoria County History, London, 1939: http://www.british- history.ac.uk/vch/oxon/vol1/pp281-303 is the site of an ancient Roman town. The site is not included in any ancient references so the Roman name is not known. However, Eilert Ekwall contended that it appears as Alavna in the Ravenna Cosmography, with the addition of the Old English ceaster to signify a Roman fort.Eilert Ekwall, The Concise Oxford Dictionary of English Place- names, p.5. It lies about south of Bicester, in the northwest corner of the civil parish of Wendlebury in the English county of Oxfordshire. Alchester had a strategic location in Roman Britain at a crossroads on the Silchester- Dorchester on Thames-Towcester road and the Cirencester-St Albans road (Akeman Street). Recent excavations have shown that it was the site of one of the earliest legionary fortresses in Roman Britain after the invasion of 43 AD. The site has been the subject of investigation since 1996, first under the auspices of Oxford University Archaeological Society, then under those of Leicester and Edinburgh Universities. Alchester: shedding new light on the Roman invasion of Britain: http://www.ed.ac.uk/history-classics- archaeology/research/knowledge-exchange/heritage-museums/alchester History Archaeology has shown an Iron Age settlement close to the later Roman town, and that Roman occupation of the site began in the Claudian period in the form of a fort soon after the invasion of Britain in 43 AD. Military Phase From the time of the Roman invasion Alchester was in a strategic position in the border region of the Catuvellauni and Dobunni tribes, and in an ideal position to exercise control over wide areas. During the first few years after the invasion, a large legionary fortress of the Legio II Augusta commanded by Vespasian was built here. Alchester was situated behind the early military front line of the Fosse Way in an ideal position as a supply base. After the conquest of most of the rest of Roman Britain, the legion moved to Exeter before AD 68 and abandoned the fortress. Civilian Era The town continued to grow, helped by its location at a road junction. Walls were built around the town during the turbulent times of the late 3rd century. After the 5th century the place was deserted. Archaeology=The Legionary Fortress Playing-card-shaped enclosures with ditches were shown on aerial photographs taken in 1943‚Äì45. Excavations in 1990 focussed initially on the Roman military enclosure near and under the later Roman town, and then on its fortified annex. This proved that the larger enclosure was indeed surrounded by an army- style V-shaped ditch characteristic of a fort. The spread in time and frequency of early objects and the buildings shows that the fort was more substantial than a vexillation camp, and existed for a longer time than a temporary camp for use only during the invasion. Investigation of the gate of the annex revealed two wooden gateposts preserved in waterlogged conditions for which Dendrochronology gives both of them felling dates of between October AD 44 and March AD 45. The main fortress must have been built earlier and probably in the year of invasion, 43 AD. The smaller enclosure, with its U-shaped ditch and square corners was atypical for Roman forts, and was interpreted as a parade ground. Parallels for this have been found associated with legionary fortress of Lambaesis (Algeria), as well as at Tomen y Mur (Gwynedd). The presence of this would also support the idea of a fairly permanent military base. The discovery in 2003 of smashed fragments of the tombstone of Lucius Valerius Geminus, a veteran of the Legio II Augusta is significant in that it shows he retired from the legion while stationed at Alchester even though he came from north-west Italy and lived in the vicinity until his death. The fortress must have been well-established and probably associated with a nearby vicus. The inscription reads: > Dis Manibus/ L(ucius) Val(erius) L(uci filius) Pol(lia tribu) Gemi/nus > For(o) Germ(anorum)/ vet(eranus) Leg(ionis) [I]I Aug(ustae)/ an(norum) L > h(ic) s(itus) e(st)/ he(res) c(uravit)/ e(x) t(estamento) > \\"To the souls of the departed: Lucius Valerius Geminus, the son of Lucius, > of the Pollia voting tribe, from Forum Germanorum, veteran of the Second > Augustan Legion, aged 50(?), lies here. His heir had this set up in > accordance with his will.\\" The size of the fort at 14-15ha including the annex is larger than that estimated for the previous fortress of Legio II Augusta at Strasbourg. Other finds also support the conclusion that this was its legionary fortress soon after invasion of Britain and before it moved to Exeter, and that its commander Vespasian was located here rather than in southern England at this time. Evidence from coins found at the site suggest abandonment was likely to have taken place before the death of Emperor Nero in AD 68. The Town Outside the western defences, excavation in 1766 of what was then a prominent mound known as the Castle uncovered a sizable Roman bath. Excavations in 2003 of the town wall near the west gate showed this had been robbed of building stone in post-Roman times, except for two stones that were found in situ and the wall's rubble foundations. The area bounded by defences, about , is almost square, with the earliest defences consisting of a gravel rampart and one or more ditches; later, a stone wall was added to the rampart. The dating of these two phases is obscure. The planning of streets approaches a rectangular grid, uncommon in smaller Romano-British towns. Along the main street, aerial archaeology has revealed a number of narrow, rectangular strip buildings. Near the centre of the town lay a building with a central court, surrounded by a portico on three sides.

Following the German surrender after the Battle of Stalingrad, he became a member of the National Committee for a Free Germany. Adam later served in the National People's Army of East Germany. World War II Born in 1893, Adam attended from 1908 to 1913 the teacher training college in Schl√ºchtern. From October 1913 to January 1919 Adam served in the Imperial German Army. He saw action during World War I and reached the rank of Lieutenant. Adam and his wife had two children, a daughter and a son. His son was killed in France at the start of World War II on 16 May 1940. In 1939 Adam was appointed an adjutant in the XXIII Army Corps, under the Army Commanders Walther von Reichenau and later in 1941, Friedrich Paulus. On 17 December 1942, he was awarded the Knight's Cross of the Iron Cross. On 31 January 1943, now a colonel, Adam was captured by the Soviet Army after the surrender at Stalingrad, where he was interrogated by Nikolay Dyatlenko.Beevor, Antony, Stalingrad, London: Penguin, 1999, pp. 378‚Äì9 While a prisoner of war, he went to the Central Antifa (i.e. Anti-Fascist) School at Krasnogorsk and became a member of the National Committee for a Free Germany. He was also sentenced to death in absentia by a Nazi German court. Concerning the war, Adam states, \\"That the Second World War started by Hitler's Germany was a crime not only against the peoples attacked by us, but also against the German nation, did not occur to us. And because of this, we did not recognize the deeper reasons for the defeat on the Volga, superiority of the socialist state and social system, whose sharp sword was the Soviet army.\\" Post-war period In 1948, Adam returned to the Soviet Zone of Germany. He was among the co-founders of the National Democratic Party of Germany, an East German political party that acted as an organization for former members of the Nazi Party and the Wehrmacht. From 1948 to 1949 he worked as a consultant for the Saxony state government. From 1950 to 1952 he was Saxony's finance minister and from 1949 to 1963 a member of East Germany's Volkskammer. In 1952, Adam became a colonel in the Kasernierte Volkspolizei (KVP) (\\"Barracked People's Police\\"), the forerunner of the East German National People's Army. From 1953 to 1956 he was commander of the Officers' College of the KVP ‚Äì and later became the National People's Army. In 1958, Adam was sent into retirement. He kept on working, though, for the Working Group of Former Officers.

Controversies In March 2016, a news crew for Australia's 60 Minutes working with Jan Sjunnesson came under attack, including having stones thrown on them and a car running over the foot of a cameraman who was trying to prevent it from leaving in the immigrant- dominated district of Rinkeby of Stockholm. 60 Minutes published the video, on which reporter Liz Hayes states \\"there are now 55 declared no-go zones in Sweden.\\" In April 2016, Tara Brown and eight other people (including three other staff members of Nine, David Ballment, Stephen Rice, and Ben Williamson) were arrested on allegations of child abduction in Beirut. According to Lebanese authorities, 60 Minutes allegedly paid $115,000 directly to the Child Abduction Recovery International Agency, despite claims that the exchange was made by the mother of the children. The abduction agency used has also been widely discredited, with fake recovery stories being posted on Facebook and their operators having been arrested all over the world. The recovery involved the team waiting in a parked car on the street and then snatching the children from their grandmother and nanny before driving away. \\"A Lebanese judicial source\\" told The Guardian that the group were to be charged with \\"armed abduction, purveying threats and physical harm\\" ‚Äì crimes which carry sentences of twenty years' imprisonment with hard labour. The group were released from custody only after Nine paid a substantial money settlement to the father of the children the subject of the abduction attempt. This operation sparked wide debate about the ethics of the journalism being conducted. In May 2019, a jury ruled that a 60 Minutes story aired in 2015 about the 2011 Grantham floods defamed four members of the Wagner family, from Toowoomba, Queensland, by implying they were responsible for the 12 deaths that occurred during the disaster. In November, a court ordered Channel Nine to pay $2.4 million plus $63,000 in interest to the family. Nick Cater, a journalist featured in the program, was ordered to pay an additional $1.2 million in damages. Justice Peter Applegarth, who was in charge of the case, stated that while Cater had information contradicting the program's allegations, he did not include them in the story. Applegarth also concluded that Channel Nine failed to inform the Wagners of the allegations until after the program had been publicised, and when the family did send a statement to Nine, they did not include it in the program.

The north coast is marked by Cape Enniberg, the second-highest sea cliff in Europe at and the highest promontory in the world. Looking to the west from Vi√∞arei√∞i, one has a view of the mighty northern peaks on Bor√∞oy and Kunoy. Turning around, one can see through the crag and tails of the isthmus to the eastern Island of Fugloy. Finally, to the south of the town, the high cone- shaped mountain of Malinsfjall can be seen during good weather. Vi√∞arei√∞i is a departure point for a vast area of hiking. In the community, there is not only a small grocery store, but also the Hotel Nor√∞ with its restaurant that serves traditional cuisine.  History  Vi√∞arei√∞i Church In the 17th century, the old church was destroyed in a storm. It is said that a part of the cemetery was washed away by the sea and that coffins from the cemetery were recovered in Hvannasund and reburied in Vi√∞arei√∞i. The current church was built in 1892. The church silver is a gift from the British government, thanking Vi√∞arei√∞i's citizens for the rescue of the brig Marwood, which was shipwrecked near Vi√∞arei√∞i during a winter storm in 1847.

These warrior Kshatriyas later came to be known by Mistri mainly because of their occupation. These Mistris have founded the Juna Vaas and contributed a lot to the development of all early infrastructure, temples of the village and erection of other architects of Kutch. The Patel Kanbi community moved into the village around 1576 AD (V.S. 1633). Navo Vaas (New Residence) was started in around 1857, by which time Madhapar had become congested and other communities like the Kanbis had also increased and prospered. The village was not heavily affected by the 2001 Gujarat earthquake that had caused severe damage in the region. However, some of the century-old houses of Mistris in Juna Vaas (Old Residence) with unique architect were damaged in the earthquake of 26 January 2001. Schools The first government boys' school was started in 1884. Bhimji Devji Rathod of Mistri Community built and started the first girls' school in Madhapar in 1900. The first high school, Madhapar Vidhyalay Saraswati High School, was founded in 1968. Present status The town of Madhapar, with a population of more than ninety two thousand people, some 3 km from the main town of Bhuj in the province of Kutch (Gujarat), is wealthiest town in the whole of Southern Asia with an average GDP of $132,000 per person. In recent times, the town has become greener, with new lakes, check dams and deep bore artesian wells that provide fresh water all year round. It has new health centers, playing fields, parks and temples. Geology There are two large lakes in Madhapar. One is called Jagasagar and was built by Mistri railway contractor Jagamal Bhima Rathod around the year 1900; it is named after him. His brother, Karasan Bhima Rathod also built an artificial lake with steps near the Suralbhit Temple, which today is known as Karasan Bhimjee's Pond. The other is called Meghrajji Lake, named after Meghrajji, the last ruler of the Cutch State. Temples Sanatan Thakor Mandir, Mahadev Temple, Barla Temple and Swaminarayan Temple (1949) are in Madhapar. Kuldevi Temples of Momai Mata of Solanki, Rathods are also there.

Started and run by women in the 1970s and bolstered by the success of the Women's Liberation Movement (WLM), Virago has been credited as one of several British feminist presses that helped address inequitable gender dynamics in publishing. Unlike alternative, anti-capitalist publishing projects and zines coming out of feminist collectives and socialist circles, Virago branded itself as a commercial alternative to the male dominated publishing industry and sought to compete with mainstream international presses.Murray, Simone. Mixed Media : Feminist Presses and Publishing Politics, Pluto Press, 2004. ProQuest Ebook Central.  History  Virago was founded in 1973 by Carmen Callil, primarily to publish books by women writers. It was originally known as Spare Rib Books, sharing a name with the most famous magazine of the British women's liberation movement or second wave feminism. (The first issue of Spare Rib magazine, whose founders included Rosie Boycott and Marsha Rowe, was published in June 1972.) From the start, Virago published two sorts of books: original works, and out- of-print books by neglected female writers. The latter were reissued under the \\"Modern Classics\\" insignia, which launched in 1978 with Frost in May, a novel by the British author Antonia White originally published in 1933. The Virago list also contains works with feminist themes by male authors such as H. G. Wells. Valentine Cunningham has praised Virago for trawling \\"most impressively and fruitfully in the novel catalogues\\" of the 1930s for women's fiction to reprint. In 1982, Virago became a wholly owned subsidiary of the Chatto, Virago, Bodley Head, and Cape Group (CVBC), but in 1987 Callil, Lennie Goodings, Ursula Owen, Alexandra Pringle, and Harriet Spicer put together a management buy-out from CVBC, then owned by Random House, USA. The buy-out was financed by Rothschild Ventures and Robert Gavron. Random House UK kept a ten per cent stake in the company, and continued to handle sales and distribution. In 1993 Rothschild Ventures sold their shares to the directors and Gavron, who thus became the largest single shareholder. After a downturn in the market forced a reduction in activity, the board decided to sell the company to Little, Brown, of which Virago became an imprint in 1996 (with Lennie Goodings as Publisher and Sally Abbey as Senior Editor). The sale to Little Brown, a large company owned by the telecommunications giant Time Warner, was met with negative publicity and raised questions about the future of feminist publishing houses. In 2006, Virago's parent company became part of publishing group Hachette Livre. Lennie Goodings remains as editor and publisher.

Berardino (born 1950) is an American businessman, Certified Public Accountant, and managing director at Alvarez and Marsal. Beradino was formerly managing partner and CEO of Arthur Andersen and chairman and CEO of Profectus Bioscience. Career=Arthur Andersen Berardino joined the Big 5 accounting firm Arthur Andersen's New York City office in 1972, after graduating from the Fairfield University Dolan School of Business with a B.S. in accounting. He was admitted to the partnership in 1982, rising to head of Andersen's U.S. audit practice. In 1998, then United States Securities and Exchange Commission (SEC) Chairman Arthur Levitt launched an attack on the auditing business. At that time, it was felt that accounting firms were conflicted by selling consulting services to the same companies whose books they were auditing. In 2000, Berardino negotiated a compromise with the SEC. Auditing and consulting fees would henceforth be disclosed. At Andersen, Berardino was admired for having negotiated this compromise, because a prohibition from signing consulting contracts with audit clients would have been very damaging to Andersen's business. Levitt praised Berardino's leadership in his book Take on the Street.... Berardino became managing partner ‚Äì chief executive officer of Andersen Worldwide (the governing body of Andersen's operations in 84 countries including 85,000 people) in January 2001 shortly after its split with Andersen Consulting (Accenture). When Andersen's client Enron declared bankruptcy in the highly publicized Enron scandal, Berardino appeared before Congress and announced a series of steps to improve Andersen and the accounting profession. In early 2002, when Andersen discovered that its auditors had been involved with shredding documents related to the Enron audit, Berardino disclosed this activity voluntarily to the U.S. Department of Justice and the SEC. While in Tokyo meeting with Asia- Pacific partners in an attempt to keep the firm together, Berardino received the news that the U.S. Justice Department was likely to indict the firm. Berardino hired former Federal Reserve chairman Paul Volcker in February 2002 to create an independent oversight board and reform Andersen into a pure auditing business. On March 14, 2002, the Justice Department indicted Andersen for obstruction of justice based on the document shredding which took place. Initially, the firm's 18-strong Board of partners asked Berardino to stay on. He resigned on March 26, 2002, in the hope that justice would reconsider the indictment. They did not, and Andersen was convicted of obstruction of justice on June 15, 2002. By the end of August, it surrendered its licenses to audit public companies in the US. In 2006, the Supreme Court of the U.S. overturned this conviction in a unanimous opinion. It was a symbolic victory for the defunct accounting firm. Profectus BioScience He was chairman and chief executive officer of Profectus BioSciences in Baltimore, Maryland up until January 24, 2008. Berardino continued with the company as a director through 2010. He had joined the company as a director in 2004. Profectus Biosciences, Inc. is a biotechnology start-up that develops therapeutic and vaccine technologies intended to reduce the morbidity and mortality caused by viral diseases. The company's near-term target is the Human Immunodeficiency Virus (HIV). On the vaccine front, Profectus is trying to target HIV as it attempts to enter a cell. The company's therapies aim to cool the body's overheated immune system after it is infected with HIV. Profectus is a spin-off from the Institute of Human Virology and was created to commercialize its work. Alvarez & Marsal Berardino is currently a managing director (since 2008) based in New York. Joe works with public companies in need of corporate transformation typically caused by disruptions to their historic business models. Affiliations Berardino served on the boards of directors of Quiksilver (NYSE:ZQK); ValueVision Media (aka ShopHQ from 2008 to 2012; NASDAQ:VVTV) and Neuberger Berman from 2011 to 2012 and has served for eighteen years on the board of trustees of Fairfield University. He has served since 2019 on the board of directors of ettain, a company owned by Alvarez & Marsal Capital Partners and its employees. In 2001, he received Fairfield University's Beta Alpha Sigma Award, as well as a Doctor of Law, Honoras Causas, from the University of the East in the Philippines. In 2004 Berardino was invested as a Knight of Malta in 2004.

In addition to its own line between Monroe and Social Circle, Georgia, the railroad operates the Athens Line, LLC and the Hartwell Railroad. Clay, feldspar, grain, machinery, fertilizer, woodchips, plastics, pulpwood, and silica are carried by the railroad, generating around 3,650 annual carloads. History The railroad between Social Circle and Monroe was originally constructed by the Walton Railroad beginning in 1880. In March 1884 the railroad was consolidated with the Gainesville, Jefferson and Southern Railroad and later leased to the Georgia Railroad. Following acquisition by the Georgia Railroad the line continued to operate as a separate division, the Monroe Railroad, until 1917. The Georgia Railroad was merged into the Seaboard System Railroad in 1983, and CSX Transportation in 1986. The branch from Social Circle to Monroe was sold to the Georgia Eastern Railroad in February 1987. On March 30, 1987, the Georgia Eastern sold the line to the Great Walton Railroad. In addition to the Monroe branch, Norfolk Southern Railway leased a branch from Covington to Shady Dale under the Thoroughbred Shortline Program to the Great Walton on April 10, 1989.

Operation  Instead of the effect being controlled by a pedal, as on a standard wah-wah, the effect alters in response to the volume of the input signal.The Boss Book: The Ultimate Guide to the World's Most Popular Compact Effects for Guitar, 2002, Hal Leonard Corporation Like a wah, it works by adjusting a peaking filter, which amplifies a specific frequency and cuts off other selected frequencies. Since the electronic circuits in the effect can respond much faster than a human musician can physically move a pedal, certain effects that a standard wah cannot achieve are only possible with auto-wah. The response of the effect is highly interactive with the dynamics of the input signal - this makes it possible to vary the response at will via slight adjustments to playing technique. Therefore it may take some practice before the response of the auto-wah can be wilfully controlled in order to achieve a consistent sound. A typical auto-wah circuit uses an envelope detector to produce a voltage representing the overall volume of the input. This signal is then used to sweep the cutoff frequency of a filter. The filter usually has a low-pass or bandpass response. The Boss AW-3 is an example of such a device. There is a variant of auto-wah that utilizes a low-frequency oscillator (LFO) instead of an envelope detector to alter the effect. The filter response varies constantly with time and is not linked to playing dynamics. The Boss AW-2 is an example of such a device. The difference in sound is subtle, but careful listeners will notice the constant period of the filter sweep. The song \\"Falling Into Grace\\" by the Red Hot Chili Peppers is an example of an LFO controlled auto-wah applied to the bass guitar. Typical controls on an auto- wah include a sensitivity control to adjust the input level to match the level expected by the envelope follower and other circuitry, a control for the initial cutoff point of the filter, and a control for the depth of the filter sweep. Some more sophisticated units offer controls for the resonance of the filter, multiple filter types, and options for sweeping the filter up or down. Notable examples  The first envelope-controlled filter built for musical instruments was the Mu-Tron III, invented by Mike Beigel. Other examples include the MXR Envelope Filter and the Boss AW-2 Auto Wah (LFO controlled).

The lake has an elongated shape, its south shores are high, steep and wooded, and the north slant. Lake Varna was formed in a river valley by the raising of sea level near the end of the Pleistocene. Its bottom is covered by a thick alluvium of slime and hydrogen sulphide mud in the deepest parts; there are large deposits of medicinal fango (mineral mud). A number of rivers pour into the lake, including Devnya and Provadiyska that empty near the western shores of Lake Beloslav, which is connected to Lake Varna. Until the 20th century, fresh water from the lake emptied into the Black Sea through the Devnya River, but following the construction of the modern Port of Varna East (and the subsequent draining of the river), a canal was dug through the strip of sand between the sea and the lake between 1906 and 1909, which led to the lake's level dropping by 1.40 m and the incursion of sea water into the lake, which became brackish. In 1976, when a new 12 m-deep canal crossed by the Asparuhov most began operating, the lake was dredged along the stream. Another navigable canal to the west lead through the neighboring Lake Beloslav to the Port of Varna West and the Railroad Ferry Terminal. A couple of smaller specialized ports dot Lake Varna's north shore, notably the Port of LesPort and the Port of Varna Thermal Power Plant. Industrialization came at the cost of the lake's reputation of a rich fishing ground that had sustained human settlements for nearly 100,000 years. The Varna Necropolis, where the oldest gold treasure in the world was found, is located near the north shore, while the city of Varna is situated at the lake's eastern extremity. Also along the north shore are the villages of Kazashko and Ezerovo, and the villages of Zvezditsa and Konstantinovo overlook the lake from the southern heights.

Its plot centers on the 1958 ill-fated Japanese scientific expedition to the South Pole, its dramatic rescue from the impossible weather conditions on the return journey, the relationship between the scientists and their loyal and hard-working Sakhalin huskies, particularly the lead dogs Taro and Jiro, and the fates of the 15 dogs left behind to fend for themselves. The film was selected as the Japanese entry for the Best Foreign Language Film at the 56th Academy Awards, but was not accepted as a nominee.Margaret Herrick Library, Academy of Motion Picture Arts and Sciences It entered into the 34th Berlin International Film Festival, and at the Japan Academy Awards was nominated for the best film, cinematography, lighting, and music score, winning the Popularity award for the two dogs Taro and Jiro as most popular performer, as well the cinematography and reader's choice award at the Mainichi Film Awards. It was a big cinema hit, and held Japan's box office record for its homemade films until it was surpassed by Hayao Miyazaki's Princess Mononoke in 1997. The original electronic score was created by Greek composer Vangelis, who had recently written music for Chariots of Fire and Blade Runner. The soundtrack is available worldwide on CD-audio as Antarctica. Plot In February 1958, the Second Cross-Winter Expedition for the Japanese Antarctic Surveying Team rides on the icebreaker S≈çya to take over from the 11-man First Cross-Winter Expedition. The First Cross-Winter Expedition retreats by helicopter, leaving 15 Sakhalin huskies chained up at the Showa Base for the next Expedition. Due to the extreme weather conditions, S≈çya can not get near enough to the base and it is decided not to proceed with the handover, leaving the base unmanned. The team is worried about the dogs, as the weather is extremely cold and only one week of food for the dogs has been left. They wish to rescue them but in the end are unable to, due to a shortage of fuel and drinking water. Eight of the fifteen sled dogs manage to break loose from their chains (Riki, Anko, Shiro, Jakku, Deri, Kuma, Taro, and Jiro), while the other seven starve. As the eight journey across the frozen wilderness, they are forced to survive on their own feces, on hunting penguins and seals on the ice shelves and even on eating seal excrement. As the months pass, most die or disappear. Riki is fatally injured by a killer whale while trying to protect Taro and Jiro, Anko and Deri fall through the ice and drown in the freezing waters, Shiro falls off a cliff to his death, and Jakku and Kuma disappear in the wilderness. Eleven months later, on 14 January 1959, Kitagawa, one of the dog handlers in the first expedition, returns with the Third Cross-Winter Expedition, wanting to bury his beloved dogs. He, along with the two dog-handlers Ushioda and Ochi, recover the frozen corpses of the seven chained dogs, but are surprised to discover that eight others have broken loose. To everyone's surprise, they are greeted warmly at the base by Taro and Jiro, brothers who were born in Antarctica. It is still unknown how and why they survived because an average husky can only live in such conditions for about one month. In the movie, the director used the data available, together with his imagination, to reconstruct how the dogs struggled with the elements and survived.

It was released in Japan in 1983, and in France in 1985. , the film is available on DVD in Japan (Japanese subtitles) and Hong Kong (Chinese and English subtitles). The breed of dog also became briefly popular. However, concerns were raised that the dogs who took part in the filming might have been subjected to extreme conditions to obtain the degree of realism involved. American Humane withheld its \\"No Animals Were Harmed\\" disclaimer, rating the film \\"Unacceptable\\" due to what it regarded as deliberate cruelty on the set.American Humane Association review retrieved on July 15, 2017 The director responded that the emotions shown by the dogs during the film were painstakingly captured and then edited into the relevant parts. In order to recreate the death scenes the dogs were carefully anesthetized. The parts where the dogs drowned or fell were done in the studio and blue-screened with the actual filming location. The blood on the dogs was fake. It remained unclear whether the deaths of the prey animals (a seabird and a seal) were also simulated.
