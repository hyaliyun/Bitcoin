It is named for the pirate Edward Davis, who supposedly sighted it in 1687. Never found again, it was also believed by William Dampier to possibly be the coast of Terra Australis Incognita. Discovery It was sighted in 1687 by Edward Davis, a pirate who was carrying out raids on Spanish settlements along the coast of Mexico, Peru, and Chile, while he was sailing in the Pacific Ocean southwards from the Galapagos Islands towards Cape Horn. He saw a low sandy island and in the distance, hills extending to the northeast. Davis made no attempt to investigate any further, more interested in continuing his voyage home. Davis's supposed discovery was along the southern latitude of 27 to 28 degrees, which was on the same latitude as the Spanish-controlled gold mines of Copiap√≥. At the time, it was believed that gold could be found elsewhere along this latitude so on learning of the news of Davis Land, several navigators were instructed to seek it out on their voyages. In 1767, the French explorer Jean-Fran√ßois-Marie de Surville set out from Pondicherry in French India on an exploration and trading voyage with one of its objectives being to locate Davis Land and set up a trading post there. He was encouraged by rumours of the recent discovery by Samuel Wallis, of , of a rich island, inhabited by Jews. In actual fact, this was Tahiti, but the French conflated the discovery of \\"Wallis's Land\\" with Davis Land. Surville ended up rediscovering the Solomon Islands, made his way to the northern coast of New Zealand and then onto Peru, where he drowned seeking help for his ailing crew. In 1770 Felipe Gonz√°lez de Ahedo found Easter Island and named it Isla de San Carlos or de David. It was translated as \\"Davis's Island\\". In Wikimedia Commons. Never found, Davis Land was also believed by William Dampier, who had sailed with Davis for a time, to possibly be the coast of Terra Australis Incognita. By the 1770s, with the Pacific now much better known, cartographers began to remove Davis Land from their maps. Dunmore notes that it is likely that Davis had sighted the islands of San Ambrosio and San Felix, part of the Desventuradas group of islands.

It was selected for production, but only a small number were built before a change in the Japanese Navy's training needs led to production being stopped. Development and design In 1937, the Imperial Japanese Navy drew up a specification for a 12-shi primary floatplane trainer to replace its Yokosuka K4Y or Navy Type 90 Primary Seaplane Trainer. The specification was issued to the established builders of aircraft for the Navy, Kawanishi and Watanabe and to the relative newcomer Nihon Hikoki (also known as \\"Nippi\\"). The specification required use of the same Gasuden Jimpu radial engine used by the K4Y, and the three designs showed little changes from the aircraft they were to replace. Kawanishi's design, which was given the short designation K8K1, was, like the other two designs, a single-engine biplane with a fabric-covered steel-tube fuselage and a wooden wing, with two floats. The trainee and instructor sat in individual open cockpits. The first of three prototypes made its maiden flight on 6 July 1938 was handed over to the Navy for testing in August that year. Nippi's submission (the K8Ni) was disqualified from the competition because it was completed too late, and the K8K was found to be much better than the K4Y which it was intended to replace. It was selected in preference to Watanabe's Watanabe K8W and placed in production as the Navy Type 0 Primary Seaplane Trainer. After 12 more aircraft had been built, however, production was stopped, with the Navy deciding to use the more powerful Yokosuka K5Y to carry out primary floatplane training.

He was the first black person elected to any office by voters in Brooklyn. Early life Baker was born on the island of Nevis in the British West Indies and immigrated to the United States via Ellis Island in 1915, when he was 17 years old. He settled in Brooklyn, N.Y., obtained a degree in accounting from La Salle Extension University correspondence school in Chicago, and became a U.S. citizen in 1924. Baker became a bookkeeper at Cox & Nostrand, a lighting manufacturer in Brooklyn, where he worked his way up to head of the bookkeeping and then the accounting departments. After being denied a promotion that he said was because of his race, he went into private practice as an accountant. Political career In the early decades of the 20th century, blacks were largely aligned with the Republican Party, which was still considered the party of Abraham Lincoln. However, as an immigrant without historical ties to the Republicans, Baker realized that Democrats were growing in numbers and power in Brooklyn, and he joined the local Democratic club, located on Gates Avenue in what is now Bedford-Stuyvesant. The club was controlled by the Irish, but Baker realized that they were the people with whom he ‚Äî and other blacks ‚Äî should align. He recruited other blacks to the Democratic Party, and after observing white political clubs, formed his own organization, the United Action Democratic Association. His volunteers in Bedford-Stuyvesant delivered votes on Election Days, and Baker gained political influence. In 1939, Baker was appointed to a patronage job as United States Deputy Collector of Internal Revenue in the income tax division in Brooklyn. Through the 1940s, he served as a \\"confidential inspector\\" for John Cashmore, the Brooklyn borough president, an Irish-American, and was a liaison between Cashmore and the growing black community in central Brooklyn. In 1945, Baker ran for a seat on the New York City Council, but finished in 14th place among candidates from Brooklyn, not high enough to win a seat. When the state Democratic Party bosses realized that their election slates could no longer remain all white, they made a deal to get Baker elected to office. They promised the local incumbent assemblyman, John J. Walsh, another Irish-American, that if he ran for the party's renomination in the primary but then withdrew, they would nominate him for a judgeship instead. With the proper timing, under New York State Law and party rules, the party bosses had the right to appoint a replacement nominee to run for the assembly, and that was Baker. By that time, his area of Brooklyn was reliably Democratic, and in November 1948, Baker became the first black elected to any political office by voters in Brooklyn. (As the result of his election, Baker also became the second person to serve in the New York State Assembly who was born in Nevis, after Alexander Hamilton ‚Äì something that he was fond of telling.) Baker was a member of the New York State Assembly from 1948 to 1970, sitting in the 167th, 168th, 169th, 170th, 171st, 172nd, 173rd, 174th, 175th, 176th, 177th, 178th, and 179th New York State Legislatures. During his tenure in the assembly, Baker sponsored bills prohibiting various types of discrimination, most notably New York's fair housing law. The Metcalf-Baker Act, which was sponsored in the State Senate by George R. Metcalf, an upstate Republican, was one of the first laws anywhere that outlawed discrimination in housing. The first version was signed into law by Governor Averell Harriman in 1955 and covered only housing with mortgages insured by the Federal Housing Administration. A revised version was signed by Governor Nelson Rockefeller in 1963 to include all housing except owner- occupied one and two-family dwellings. The federal Fair Housing Act, with even broader reach, was not passed until 1968. Baker eventually rose to become the assembly's majority whip in 1966, and remained in the assembly until his retirement from politics at the end of 1970. Personal life Baker married Irene Baker on December 10, 1919. She was born in Brooklyn in 1901. Her parents had immigrated from Nevis four years earlier; Bertram and Irene Baker were also first cousins. Baker was an avid tennis player, and was the executive secretary of the American Tennis Association from 1936 to 1966, which promoted tennis to black communities and campaigned for the sport's integration. In that capacity, he championed tennis to many who otherwise could not have played, and helped to successfully negotiate with white tennis administrators to accept Althea Gibson into their competitions. Baker also served as president of the New York State Tennis Association. Death Baker died on March 8, 1985 in Brooklyn. He was survived by his wife Irene, his two daughters Marian Baker-Howell of Brooklyn and Lillian Bemus of Queens, four grandchildren, and six great-grandchildren. Legacy Baker lived at 399 Jefferson Avenue in Brooklyn for many years. His block, Jefferson Avenue between Tompkins and Throop Avenues, was co-named Bertram L. Baker Way by the New York City Council in 2011. Baker's niece is Diane Bemus Whiting Patrick, who was the first lady of Massachusetts from 2007 to 2015.

H√§rm's career as an actress began as a teenager in the early 1960s. After appearing onstage and in several films, she retired from acting in the early 1970s to focus on writing. Early life and education Viiu H√§rm was born in German occupied-Tallinn during World War II to parents Evald and Liidia H√§rm (n√©e Kiive). She is the eldest of two children; her brother is ballet dancer/master and choreographer Tiit H√§rm. She attended Tallinn 29th Incomplete Secondary School from 1951 until 1958 and Tallinn 7th Secondary School from 1958 until graduating in 1962. Upon graduating from secondary school, she enrolled in the Performing Arts Department of the Tallinn State Conservatory (now, the Estonian Academy of Music and Theatre) to study acting under instruction of Voldemar Panso and Vello Rummo, graduating in 1966. Among her graduating classmates were Rudolf Allabert, Helgi Ilo, Enn Kraam, T√µnu Mikiver, and T√µnu Tamm. Career =Acting= Viiu H√§rm's career as an actress came to prominence as an eighteen-year-old when she was cast in the starring role of Salme in the 1962 Leida Laius-directed Tallinna Kinostuudio (now, Tallinnfilm) war-drama √ïhtust hommikuni, based on the 1960 short story by author Heino Puhvel (under the pen name Mart Kalda). This was followed by a supporting role in the 1963 Igor Yeltsov-directed drama √úhe katuse all, based on the story √úhes majas by Estonian author Hans Lebrecht and also released by Tallinna Kinostuudio. In 1967, she appeared in her final film role, that of Paula, in the Veljo K√§sper- directed and Lilli Promet-penend Tallinnfilm drama T√ºtarlaps mustas. She has also appeared in several television productions. When H√§rm's former Tallinn State Conservatory instructor and theatre pedagogue Voldemar Panso helped establish the Estonian SSR State Youth Theatre (now, the Tallinn City Theater) in 1965, H√§rm was among the first group of actors to receive an engagement with the theatre. She was employed at the theatre until 1971 when she retired for health reasons. =Writing= After retiring from acting before the age of thirty, H√§rm began to concentrate on writing. Her first works of poetry were published in the youth magazine S√§de and the journal Noorus; her later works were consistently published in Estonia's oldest literary journal Looming. In 1973, Eesti Raamat published her first collection of poetry Pealkirjata. Since then, a number of collections of poetry and two novels have been published. Her 2004 novel √ïhuaken won the 2005 Eduard Vilde Literary Award. ;;Selected works'' *Pealkirjata (poetry collection, 1973) *Luuletusi, lugusid ja midagi ka Margareetast (poetry collection, 1978) *Valge vaikus (poetry collection with Peeter Tooming and Ants S√§de, 1979) *Sina, j√µgi (poetry collection with photographer Peeter Tooming, 1984) *Avamaastik / Kusagil tuksub mu s√ºda (poetry collection with husband Paul-Eerik Rummo, 1989) *Duubel kaks: n√º√ºd, kus ma midagi ei k√ºsi...

She was elected to the Boston School Committee several times in the 1970s, and served three two-year terms. Though she was cleared of bribery charges related to the Boston School Committee in 1981 this ultimately led to the loss of her Committee seat. Early life Elvira Palladino and her twin sister Rosamond Totela were born in 1932 in East Boston to an Italian shoemaker. Before becoming involved in politics, Palladino was primarily a \\"housewife and mother of two,\\" as well as a \\"a Girl Scout leader [and] organizer of a girls hockey team\\". Her work led to her being elected for the \\"executive committee of the Curtis Gyld Elementary School Home and School Association\\" and then moved up to being \\"president of [her oldest daughter's East Boston High] Home and School Association and an East Boston representative on the city wide federation\\". This career in school organizations transitioned into politics when she joined others in the Home and School Association in opposing the \\"'racial imbalance law,' an early effort at voluntary busing\\". She participated in a campaign that defeated an \\"East Boston priest-representative who had supported the racial imbalance law\\".  Personal life  Palladino married Nunzio Palladino and had two children with him, a boy and girl. The two later divorced at some point prior to her death on August 31, 2006 from diabetes at the Melrose-Wakefield Hospital.  ROAR  Palladino headed ROAR's \\"Easy Boston branch (the One If by Land, Two If by Sea Civic Association)\\". She served on the executive board of the organization called ROAR (Restore Our Alienated Rights), which was created by Councilwoman Louise Day Hicks. She represented East Boston while serving on this board. While Hicks described ROAR as nonviolent, \\"ROAR was behind some of the violent clashes that marked Boston's school desegregation efforts\\" and members reportedly spat on Senator Edward M. Kennedy. Palladino insisted racial prejudice contributed to her opposition to busing, claiming \\"...don't touch our children and take them out of our schools and send them into an area like Roxbury where the crime is so high\\". Palladino was also often compared to Hicks, though the two were \\"temperamentally at odds\\". Pixie Palladino \\"confronted her wold with gritty pugnacity\\", was caustically anticlerical, and rarely hesitated to speak her mind, often \\"in explicit street language, which earned her the nickname 'Garbage Mouth'\\". When Monsignor Mimie Pitaro (a state legislator) opposed the repeal of the Racial Imbalance Act, Palladino reportedly \\"intercepted him outside the chamber and gave him 'the Italian kiss of death' -- three fingers taken to the lips, then quickly moved toward the target\\". On September 8, 1965, at McKay Elementary School, Palladino met with Lucille Roberts and seventeen other ROAR members (with one male member), \\"who came to protest in the name of 'fredom of choice' and constitutional rights of assembly [...] Palladino hollered at Roberts, who was on the playground, 'You fucking white trash, you fuck niggers, you're a nigger lover.' Palladino's actions were not isolated and trickled down to the next generation\\". In 1973, Palladino told the East Boston Community News that she doesn't \\"believe in integration. God made people of different colors and once we lose our identity, we have nothing.\\" She later denied those remarks, but her position on race was less equivocal than Hicks. After her election to the School Committee in November 1975, Palladino \\"became the spokesperson for those in the anti-busing movement who accused Louise of pulling her punches\\". On June 3, 1975, an article in the Real Paper by Rep. Raymond Flynn claimed there was a secret alliance between Mayor Kevin H. White and ROAR, claiming that \\"the mayor had met Nov. 20 with the board; that one ROAR activist and the husbands of Elvira Palladino of East Boston and Janet Palmariello of West Roxbury had gotten jobs on the city payroll after the November meeting\\". Mayor White dismissed the claim, responding that it was entirely false on June 2, 1975 though he did provide some aid to the antibusing crowd. During the mid-1970s, Palladino led an \\"enormous amount of antibusing energy [out of] East Boston\\" thanks in part to her election to the School Committeee in 1975. Consequently, \\"throughout the Northeast, of course, Italian-Americans participated prominently in white backlash movements and 'produced white-hope saviors like Frank Rizzo in Philadelphia, Tough Tony Imperiale in Newark, and Mario Procaccino in New York City'\\". = Protests = On June 8, 1975 Elvira \\"Pixie\\" Palladino led ROAR (Restore Our Alienated Rights) members in a protest outside of John I. Taylor's South Natick home. More than 1000 antibusing demonstrators showed up in total. Taylor was the \\"president of Affiliated Publications, the parent company of The Boston Globe... and was one of 25 directors of the United Way\\". Palladino, characterized as the ROAR leader at the time, \\"charged The [Boston] Globe with not being objective in its coverage of the busing issue\\". She mentioned opposing both Taylor and Federal Judge W. Arthur Garrity Jr. (who ordered busing to desegregate Boston schools). ROAR members and supporters \\"assembled at the South Shore Plaza at 1 p.m. before driving on Rtes. 128 and 16 in a motorcade of about 250 cars to South Natick\\". Three police officers blocked access to the home by standing in the driveway. ROAR protestors once again protested against The Boston Globe on June 21, 1975. This time they marched outside of The Boston Globe on Morrisey, and Palladino participated in the protest. = Exit = Palladino claimed in a press conference on March 10, 1976 that she would resign from the executive board of ROAR if \\"her ouster is called for in a vote of the entire membership and if other 'political figures' on the board resign\\". Palladino was ousted from the executive board in early March 1976, on account of her also being an elected public official. At the time, Louise Day Hicks was still a ROAR member but did not sit on the ROAR executive board. In addition, the South Boston chapter of ROAR \\"voted, 340-2, against Palladino's continuing as a board member\\". This was a contentious issue as ROAR members believed that the organization was inherently nonpolitical. Members of local ROAR chapters voted on kicking Palladino off the executive board. On March 9, 1976 members of the West Roxbury chapter of ROAR voted \\"in favor of the ouster of Elvira Palladino from the executive board of the citywide antibusing group.\\" All 60 members, except three absentee members, voted against Palladino. Powder Keg, the Charlestown chapter of ROAR, voted on March 9, 1976 to endorse the ouster of Elvira Palladino. The vote against Palladino \\"was 85-25... [with] five abstentions.\\" Following the initial actions to oust Palladino, members of the ROAR executive board announced on March 6, 1976 that they would suspend \\"their weekly citywide meetings in Boston's City Hall\\".  Career  On November 4, 1975, Pixie Palladino was elected to Boston's School Committee. Her campaign platform focused on \\"magnet schools, vocational education, better reading programs and a voluntary busing plan\\". She attributed her win to \\"'the little people' of Boston\\". During the time of her election, she was still living in her twin sister's house. Palladino legally changed her first name to Pixie for her candidacy (her given name is Elvira). She was \\"the first Italian-American in recent memory to serve on the normally all-Irish School Committee. She replaced the incumbent Paul Ellison, who at the time was awaiting trial \\"on charges of pocketing school department funds and attempting to tamper with the grand jury investigating him\\". During Palladino's time on the School Committee, she said she would ask the Committee to \\"rescind its approval of Jerome Winegar as headmaster of South Boston High School\\". She claimed that he was a failure at his previous school, Wilson Junior High School in St. Paul, Minnesota, \\"because the school he administered was closed April 1 and 2 [1976, due to] racial fighting\\". = Presidential Committee Vote = In December 1979, Elvira Palladino regained a seat on the Boston School Committee, after being defeated in 1977. At the time, she could \\"provide the third vote John J. McDonough need[ed] to become president of the five-member committee Jan. 7\\". McDonough historically opposed busing, but was perceived as a moderate on the issue. He claimed that he would not change his stance on busing for votes. = Familial Connections = As of July 11, 1980, Palladino's nephew‚ÄîWilliam D. Manning Jr. -- was hired to the Boston School Committee as \\"assistant to the deputy superintendent of management,\\" with a wage of $21,000. His hiring bypassed normal hiring practices, as his appointment was approved by the committee \\"as part of a package of personnel actions,\\" with many committee members not knowing what they were voting on. The approval vote was 5-0. Other relatives of hers have been hired onto the School Department's payroll. \\"Her daughter, Nancy O'Brien, serves as her secretary. And a son, Robert, has worked as a per diem custodian\\". = Voting History = Palladino voted against \\"virtually every progressive program to come before the committee... [including] multicultural activities, bilingual programs, university participation, district planning and parental education\\". Her reasoning was that she wanted to give \\"direct services to kids\\" and that she always voted against \\"federally funded contracts,\\" believing the federal funds destroyed local school systems. Committee member Robert Wood often suggested progressive programs, that were often passed with the usual dissenting vote from Palladino (and sometimes from Gerald O'Leary.) Wood was ultimately ousted in a 3-1 vote, with Palladino voting to get rid of Wood due to a budget deficiency and an instance of unprofessionalism. Elvira Palladino was the fourth vote on the Boston School Committee, to lay off nearly 1000 teachers on August 18, 1981 at a meeting held at West Roxbury High School. The total 960 layoffs (nearly a fifth of all teachers) was made up of \\"710 tenured teachers and 250 provisionals\\". School Superintendent Robert R. Spillane claimed \\"it may be possible to rehire 120 to 125 of the dismissed teachers with $3 million in over-budgeted funds\\". Superior Court Judge Thomas R. Morse Jr. ruled that the motion could only be passed with a four out of five vote to make the layoffs. Due to a lack of funds, he \\"refused Boston Teacher Union appeals to uphold the job security provision in its three-year contract\\". At the time, people believed Palladino would vote against the action in favor of affirmative action, due to the seniority violations in the measure. Due to Judge W. Arthur Garrity Jr.'s ruling on Boston's school desegregation case, \\"four white teachers had to be laid off for every black teacher, so the level of black teachers in the system did not slip below its current 19 percent\\". Consequently, many white teachers will be laid off. At the time of John J. McDonough's bribery trial, Palladino was trying to get re-elected to the School Board Committee (a five-member committee) which would be her third two- year term; she placed sixth in the primary. = Television = In 1987, WGBH's Frontline produced a PBS documentary called Street Cop which focused on \\"relations between the police and the black community in Boston\\". Palladino was present at the \\"advance screening of the film at Boston's World Trade Center\\". She \\"dismissed the film as 'a fairytale,' [and asserted]: We're back where we started. This film is being shown at the wrong time. I asked Channel 7 and the mayor of Boston that this picture not be shown at this time. It's very sad for the people of Charlestown. I don't think this film does this justice'\\".  Bribery Trial  In October 1980, Elvira Palladino appeared before a grand jury in a bribery trial for School Committeeman John J. McDonough. She denied receiving any bribes, claiming \\"she had been implicated falsely because of her strong anti-busing stand\\". In addition, during her appearance before the grand jury, she did not invoke her Fifth Amendment privilege. Elvira Palladino was subpoenaed by the defense at a subsequent bribery trial. Palladino was served the subpoena on the same day her former School Committee colleague, Gerald F. O'Leary, testified he gave both her and McDonough a $5000 bribe from a bus company. The charges were that she accepted the money in \\"exchange for a favorable vote on a School Committee bus contract\\". Palladino denied O' Leary's allegations, calling his testimony \\"complete fabrication and lies\\" in a press conference on September 28, 1981. O'Leary alleged that Palladino was part of a bribery scheme \\"involving ARA Services Inc., a bus company with a $40 million School Department contract\\". After a three-week trial, Palladino was cleared of all charges in mid-October 1981. McDonough was also ultimately cleared of all charges. Both McDonough and Elvira Palladino lost their School Committee seats. As both School Committee members were city employees at the time of the hearings, the city was technically liable. The fees \\"may be deducted from the School Committee's $210 million budget\\" or Boston taxpayers would have to pay an estimated $77,000 in total fees for the defense of both School Committee members. Palladino paid $5000 for her legal defense, provided by Attorney Robert Stranziani.

Life and career In his younger years, Pisnik was member of various social-democratic youth and trade union organizations. He joined the SDAP√ñ in 1928. From 1926 to 1929 he finished an apprenticeship as a machinist. Subsequently, in 1933, after another three years of training, he received a qualification as an electrical engineer. In 1934 he participated in the Austrian Civil War, in the course of which he was arrested, but freed soon after.

It originated around the 1860s, after the abolition of slavery. The vocals are typically call-and-response, and it is accompanied by all kinds of typical Surinamese percussion, such as the skratji. Like many South American music genres, the rhythm of the kawina originates in Africa. African slaves took their religions, such as Winti, and music with them to Suriname. To dissipate the time, the slaves sung during the work on the plantations, often in a typical pattern of one voice that asks for, and is answered in unison (\\"call-and-response\\"). The music was performed so rhythmically that it became a dance. In the beginning, the lyrics were religious. After abolition of slavery, it became entertainment music, with lyrics that are more socially critical in tone. From then on, kawina is performed by orchestras containing about ten band members, on various Surinamese percussion instruments. Typical instruments are the double-skinned drums, the zigzag or shaker and the kwa-kwa bangi (idiophone). The vocals have always remained in the call-and-response pattern. If a drum kit forms part of the occupation, it is called kaskawi - a subgenre that arises in the 1970s. In the following years, kawina also mixed with other musical genres such as kaseko and rhythm and blues. Kawina became known in the Netherlands by bands like Sukru Sani, Ai Sa Si, Explosion, La Rouge and La Caz.

On May 7, 1955, at the conclusion of the 25th anniversary ceremony, the Society's first meeting was held. The meeting was attended by Gantt, Howard Liddell, Edward Kempf, David Rioch, and William G. Reese. The agreement reached at that meeting was for the society's membership to be initially limited to thirty-five people. Early in its history, the Pavlovian Society held its annual meetings in or near Baltimore and/or New York City, but this began to change as the society began to attract more members from other countries. John J. Furedy, a former president of the society, claimed that it was unique among psychological learned societies in being truly open to \\"genuine debate and discussion\\", which he argued was representative of a pre- Socratic philosophy.

Some of the water makes it all the way to the lower mantle and may even reach the outer core. Mineral physics experiments show that hydrous minerals can carry water deep into the mantle in colder slabs and even \\"nominally anhydrous minerals\\" can store several oceans' worth of water.  Introduction  In the conventional view of the water cycle (also known as the hydrologic cycle), water moves between reservoirs in the atmosphere and Earth's surface or near-surface (including the ocean, rivers and lakes, glaciers and polar ice caps, the biosphere and groundwater). However, in addition to the surface cycle, water also plays an important role in geological processes reaching down into the crust and mantle. Water content in magma determines how explosive a volcanic eruption is; hot water is the main conduit for economically important minerals to concentrate in hydrothermal mineral deposits; and water plays an important role in the formation and migration of petroleum. Schematic of tectonic plate boundaries. Discussed in the text are a subducting plate (5); an island arc (15) overlying a mantle wedge; a mid-ocean ridge (12); and a hotspot (3). Water is not just present as a separate phase in the ground. Seawater percolates into oceanic crust and hydrates igneous rocks such as olivine and pyroxene, transforming them into hydrous minerals such as serpentines, talc and brucite. In this form, water is carried down into the mantle. In the upper mantle, heat and pressure dehydrates these minerals, releasing much of it to the overlying mantle wedge, triggering the melting of rock that rises to form volcanic arcs. However, some of the \\"nominally anhydrous minerals\\" that are stable deeper in the mantle can store small concentrations of water in the form of hydroxyl (OH‚àí), and because they occupy large volumes of the Earth, they are capable of storing at least as much as the world's oceans. The conventional view of the ocean's origin is that it was filled by outgassing from the mantle in the early Archean and the mantle has remained dehydrated ever since. However, subduction carries water down at a rate that would empty the ocean in 1‚Äì2 billion years. Despite this, changes in the global sea level over the past 3‚Äì4 billion years have only been a few hundred metres, much smaller than the average ocean depth of 4 kilometres. Thus, the fluxes of water into and out of the mantle are expected to be roughly balanced, and the water content of the mantle steady. Water carried into the mantle eventually returns to the surface in eruptions at mid-ocean ridges and hotspots. This circulation of water into the mantle and back is known as the deep water cycle or the geologic water cycle. In . Estimates of the amount of water in the mantle range from to 4 times the water in the ocean. There are 1.37√ó1018 m3 of water in the seas, therefore, this would suggest that there is between 3.4√ó1017 and 5.5√ó1018 m3 of water in the mantle. Constraints on water in the mantle come from mantle mineralogy, samples of rock from the mantle, and geophysical probes.  Storage capacity  Dependence of temperature on depth in Earth's upper 500 kilometers (black curve). An upper bound on the amount of water in the mantle can be obtained by considering the amount of water that can be carried by its minerals (their storage capacity). This depends on temperature and pressure. There is a steep temperature gradient in the lithosphere where heat travels by conduction, but in the mantle the rock is stirred by convection and the temperature increases more slowly (see figure). Descending slabs have colder than average temperatures. Phase transformations of olivine moving through the upper mantle, transition zone, and lower mantle. In the core, water might be stored as hydrogen bound to iron. The mantle can be divided into the upper mantle (above 410 km depth), transition zone (between 410 km and 660 km), and the lower mantle (below 660 km). Much of the mantle consists of olivine and its high-pressure polymorphs. At the top of the transition zone, it undergoes a phase transition to wadsleyite, and at about 520 km depth, wadsleyite transforms into ringwoodite, which has the spinel structure. At the top of the lower mantle, ringwoodite decomposes into bridgmanite and ferropericlase. The most common mineral in the upper mantle is olivine. For a depth of 410 km, an early estimate of 0.13 percentage of water by weight (wt%) was revised upwards to 0.4 wt% and then to 1 wt%. In . However, the carrying capacity decreases dramatically towards the top of the mantle. Another common mineral, pyroxene, also has an estimated capacity of 1 wt% near 410 km. In the transition zone, water is carried by wadsleyite and ringwoodite; in the relatively cold conditions of a descending slab, they can carry up to 3 wt%, while in the warmer temperatures of the surrounding mantle their storage capacity is about 0.5 wt%. The transition zone is also composed of at least 40% majorite, a high pressure phase of garnet; this only has capacity of 0.1 wt% or less. The storage capacity of the lower mantle is a subject of controversy, with estimates ranging from the equivalent of 3 times to less than 3% of the ocean. Experiments have been limited to pressures found in the top 100 km of the mantle and are challenging to perform. Results may be biased upwards by hydrous mineral inclusions and downwards by a failure to maintain fluid saturation. At high pressures, water can interact with pure iron to get FeH and FeO. Models of the outer core predict that it could hold as much as 100 oceans of water in this form, and this reaction may have dried out the lower mantle in the early history of Earth.  Water from the mantle  The carrying capacity of the mantle is only an upper bound, and there is no compelling reason to suppose that the mantle is saturated. Further constraints on the quantity and distribution of water in the mantle comes from a geochemical analysis of erupted basalts and xenoliths from the mantle. = Basalts = Basalts formed at mid-ocean ridges and hotspots originate in the mantle and are used to provide information on the composition of the mantle. Magma rising to the surface may undergo fractional crystallization in which components with higher melting points settle out first, and the resulting melts can have widely varying water contents; but when little separation has occurred, the water content is between about 0.07‚Äì0.6 wt%. (By comparison, basalts in back- arc basins around volcanic arcs have between 1 wt% and 2.9 wt% because of the water coming off the subducting plate.) Mid-ocean ridge basalts (MORBs) are commonly classified by the abundance of trace elements that are incompatible with the minerals they inhabit. They are divided into \\"normal\\" MORB or N-MORB, with relatively low abundances of these elements, and enriched E-MORB. The enrichment of water correlates well with that of these elements. In N-MORB, the water content of the source mantle is inferred to be 0.08‚Äì0.18 wt%, while in E-MORB it is 0.2‚Äì0.95 wt%. Another common classification, based on analyses of MORBs and ocean island basalts (OIBs) from hotspots, identifies five components. Focal zone (FOZO) basalt is considered to be closest to the original composition of the mantle. Two enriched end-members (EM-1 and EM-2) are thought to arise from recycling of ocean sediments and OIBs. H1MU stands for \\"high-Œº\\", where Œº is a ratio of uranium and lead isotopes (). The fifth component is depleted MORB (DMM). Because the behavior of water is very similar to that of the element cesium, ratios of water to cesium are often used to estimate the concentration of water in regions that are sources for the components. Multiple studies put the water content of FOZO at around 0.075 wt%, and much of this water is likely \\"juvenile\\" water acquired during the accretion of Earth. DMM has only 60 ppm water. If these sources sample all the regions of the mantle, the total water depends on their proportion; including uncertainties, estimates range from 0.2 to 2.3 oceans. = Diamond inclusions = Diamond from Ju√≠na, Brazil with ringwoodite inclusions suggests presence of water in the transition zone. Mineral samples from the transition zone and lower mantle come from inclusions found in diamonds. Researchers have recently discovered diamond inclusions of ice-VII in the transition zone. Ice-VII is water in a high pressure state. The presence of diamonds that formed in the transition zone and contain ice-VII inclusions suggests that water is present in the transition zone and at the top of the lower mantle. Of the thirteen ice-VII instances found, eight have pressures around 8‚Äì12 GPa, tracing the formation of inclusions to 400‚Äì550 km. Two inclusions have pressures between 24 and 25 GPa, indicating the formation of inclusions at 610‚Äì800 km. The pressures of the ice-VII inclusions provide evidence that water must have been present at the time the diamonds formed in the transition zone in order to have become trapped as inclusions. Researchers also suggest that the range of pressures at which inclusions formed implies inclusions existed as fluids rather than solids. Another diamond was found with ringwoodite inclusions. Using techniques including infrared spectroscopy, Raman spectroscopy, and x-ray diffraction, scientists found that the water content of the ringwoodite was 1.4 wt% and inferred that the bulk water content of the mantle is about 1 wt%.  Geophysical evidence  = Seismic = Both sudden decreases in seismic activity and electricity conduction indicate that the transition zone is able to produce hydrated ringwoodite. The USArray seismic experiment is a long-term project using seismometers to chart the mantle underlying the United States. Using data from this project, seismometer measurements show corresponding evidence of melt at the bottom of the transition zone. Melt in the transition zone can be visualized through seismic velocity measurements as sharp velocity decreases at the lower mantle caused by the subduction of slabs through the transition zone. The measured decrease in seismic velocities correlates accurately with the predicted presence of 1 weight % melt of H2O. Ultra low velocity zones (ULVZs) have been discovered right above the core- mantle boundary (CMB). Experiments highlighting the presence of iron peroxide containing hydrogen (FeO2Hx) aligns with expectations of the ULVZs. Researchers believe that iron and water could react to form FeO2Hx in these ULVZs at the CMB. This reaction would be possible with the interaction of the subduction of minerals containing water and the extensive supply of iron in the Earth's outer core. Past research has suggested the presence of partial melting in ULVZs, but the formation of melt in the area surrounding the CMB remains contested.  Subduction  As an oceanic plate descends into the upper mantle, its minerals tend to lose water. How much water is lost and when depends on the pressure, temperature and mineralogy. Water is carried by a variety of minerals that combine various proportions of magnesium oxide (MgO), silicon dioxide (SiO2), and water. At low pressures (below 5 GPa), these include antigorite, a form of serpentine, and clinochlore (both carrying 13 wt% water); talc (4.8 wt%) and some other minerals with a lower capacity. At moderate pressure (5‚Äì7 GPa) the minerals include phlogopite (4.8 wt%), the 10√Ö phase (a high pressure product of talc and water, 10‚Äì13 wt%) and lawsonite (11.5 wt%). At pressures above 7 GPa, there is topaz-OH (Al2SiO4(OH)2, 10 wt%), phase Egg (AlSiO3(OH), 11‚Äì18 wt%) and a collection of dense hydrous magnesium silicate (DHMS) or \\"alphabet\\" phases such as phase A (12 wt%), D (10 wt%) and E (11 wt%). The fate of the water depends on whether these phases can maintain an unbroken series as the slab descends. At a depth of about 180 km, where the pressure is about 6 gigapascals (GPa) and the temperature around 600 ¬∞C, there is a possible \\"choke point\\" where the stability regions just meet. Hotter slabs will lose all their water while cooler slabs pass the water on to the DHMS phases. In cooler slabs, some of the released water may also be stable as Ice VII.

Chukwuocha (born November 16, 1970) is an American politician and poet. He is a Democratic member of the Delaware House of Representatives, representing District 1. He is also the current Poet Laureate of Delaware, along with his twin brother, Al Mills.  Early life and career  Chukwuocha was born on November 16, 1970, in Wilmington, Delaware, two minutes before his twin brother, Albert Mills. Their father, William \\"Hicks\\" Anderson, was a \\"legendary\\" community leader in Wilmington and the city's only community center is named after him. Chukwuocha described his upbringing as a \\"community-centered family.\\" From an early age, the brothers were interested in writing and poetry. They began writing at age six and were performing together by age seven to children at their grandmother's foster home. A pivotal moment of their lives was when their younger brother died after being struck by a stolen car. Chukwuocha enlisted in the United States Army and was stationed in Alaska. His brother also served in the Army, in both Iraq and Kuwait during the first Gulf War. Chukwuocha is a social worker and works as a director at Interfaith Community Housing of Delaware. With his brother, he founded a nonprofit, Art for Life, that seeks to \\"use the power of the arts to save and transform lives by empowering individuals and communities to create, utilize and support life giving art.\\" He has worked in the nonprofit field for over 30 years.  Twin Poets  Chukwuocha and his brother, Al Mills, are known as the \\"Twin Poets\\". Both brothers are veterans of the U.S. Army and social workers from Wilmington, Delaware. They have written and performed together since a young age. Their poetry deals with issues such as gun violence, poverty, and the criminal justice system, and is informed by their social work and daily engagement with vulnerable populations in Wilmington. The brothers work collaboratively in their creative process. They have a strong rapport on-stage, often speak in unison or intermingle their voices, and are able to uniquely punctuate one another with their \\"rhythmic\\" spoken poetry. Mills described his brother as writing longer poems. The Twin Poets have won several awards for their work and appeared on HBO's Def Poetry. They were the subject of a documentary called Why I Write. = Delaware Poets Laureate = On December 13, 2015, the Twin Poets were named the 17th Poets Laureate of the State of Delaware. As poets laureate, they serve as ambassadors and advocates of poetry for the state. They are the first co- laureates appointed by any state and are the first siblings to share the position. During their swearing-in ceremony, they recited the oath of office in \\"perfect unison.\\"  Political career  In 2012, Chukwuocha was elected to the Wilmington City Council, where he was elected president pro tempore in 2018. He was appointed to serve on the Wilmington Education Improvement Commission by Jack Markell. In 2018, he was elected to the Delaware House of Representatives after defeating incumbent Charles Potter Jr. in the Democratic primary race. He represents District 1, which covers the area north of the Brandywine River and west of North Market Street in Wilmington. In November 2018, Chukwuocha's twin brother was unanimously recommended to be his replacement for his Wilmington City Council seat by a council committee after hours of hearings that were closed to the public. The committee recommendation was voted down by the full council after a contentious debate in late December. A decision on the replacement was pushed forward until February 2019.  Personal life  Chukwuocha is a vegetarian. Electoral history *In 2018, Chukwuocha won the Democratic primary with 2,306 votes (59.5%) against incumbent Charles Potter Jr. He was elected unopposed in the general election.

Drinker (1808-1858) and Susannah Budd Shober (1813-1860). Sandwith made his first trading voyage to China about 1845, and was joined there about 1849, by his wife and two children, Catherine (1841-1922) and Robert (1842-1890). Their fourth child, Elizabeth (1855-1919), was born in Macau. Sandwith died of dysentery at Macau in January 1858, and Susannah and the children returned to the United States.

Drinker left the LVRR in 1905, to become the university's fifth president, the first alumnus to hold the position. Lehigh then consisted of the College of Engineering and the College of Liberal Arts, and could no longer afford to be tuition-free. Students were responsible for finding their own housing and meals off campus. Drinker sought to improve the student experience--the first dormitories and student dining hall were built on campus, the athletic facilities were expanded, and the first fraternity buildings were erected on university land.Willard Ross Yates, Lehigh University: A History of Education in Engineering, Business, and the Human Condition (Lehigh University Press, 1992).

He made visits to the United States, but never had a close relationship with either daughter. Cecilia displayed artistic talent as a teen, and took private lessons with the art teacher at her finishing school--Catherine Ann Drinker (Henry's older sister). Henry and Etta Drinker had six children: *Henry \\"Harry\\" Sandwith Drinker (1880-1965), lawyer, musician and composer *James Blathwaite Drinker (1882-1971), banker, executive with J.B. Drinker & Co. *Cecil Kent Drinker M.D. (1887-1956), physician and professor, founder of the Harvard School of Public Health *Aimee Ernesta Drinker (1892-1981), interior decorator and writer *Philip Drinker (1894-1972), chemical engineer and industrial hygienist, co-inventor of the iron lung *Catherine Drinker Bowen (1897-1973), historian and biographer, winner of the 1958 National Book Award for Nonfiction Cecilia Beaux attended the Pennsylvania Academy of the Fine Arts. Her first major success, Les Derniers Jours d'Enfance (The Last Days of Infancy) (1884), was a portrait of Etta holding a 3-year-old Harry. It was exhibited at PAFA, where it won the 1885 Mary Smith Prize, and at the 1887 Paris Salon.Tara Leigh Tappert, Cecilia Beaux and the Art of Portraiture, exhibition catalogue, (National Portrait Gallery, Smithsonian Institution, 1995), p. 3. Beaux became a noted artist, and painted numerous portraits of Drinker family members. For the first year of their marriage, Henry and Etta Drinker lived with her grandmother Leavitt (and sister Cecilia), in a West Philadelphia house at 4305 Spruce Street. Their first child, Harry, was born there.Tara Leigh Tappert, \\"Aim√©e Ernesta and Eliza Cecilia: Two Sisters, Two Choices,\\" The Pennsylvania Magazine of History and Biography, vol. 124, no. 3 (July 2000), pp. 249-91. Between 1880 and 1893, the couple and their growing family lived at various West Philadelphia addresses, before building a large suburban house on the campus of Haverford College. Sons Harry, James and Cecil all graduated from Haverford.Biographical Catalogue of the Matriculates of Haverford College (Haverford College Alumni Association, 1922), pp. 391, 431, 497. Drinker accepted the presidency of Lehigh University in 1905, and the family moved to Bethlehem, Pennsylvania. The Drinkers occupied the university's President's House from 1905 to 1920. Son Philip graduated from Lehigh; daughter Catherine married a Lehigh professor. In retirement, Henry and Etta Drinker lived in a suburban house in Merion Station, just outside Philadelphia. His sister Catherine and their son Philip were living with them in 1921, and their son Harry and his wife Sophie were living nearby. At age 80, Henry Sturgis Drinker completed an autobiography (1931, unpublished).Catherine Drinker Bowen, Family Portrait (Boston: Little, Brown and Company, 1970). He died in 1937, at age 86.

The ensemble tours internationally and includes over 100 musicians, almost all of whom are undergraduates at the university. Every academic year, the Princeton University Orchestra holds eight or nine concerts in Richardson Auditorium in Alexander Hall. The current Music Director of the Princeton University Orchestra is Michael J. Pratt. Michael Pratt has held this position since 1977, rendering this his 41st season at the helm of the ensemble.  History  = Early beginnings = The roots of music performance at Princeton can be traced back to 1791, when a group of student musicians filled the belfry of a candle-lit Nassau Hall and serenaded the guests of President Witherspoon's second wedding. Student groups calling themselves the \\"Instrumental Club\\" existed in the late 1800s, and precisely one century after the 1791 wedding ceremony, the name \\"Princeton University Orchestra\\" made its first-ever appearance in the 14 January 1891 publication of the New York Times. The official founding date of the ensemble recognized by Princeton's Department of Music is 13 February 1896, when professional musicians from New York orchestras performed several concerts in Alexander Hall. For its first 25 years of history, the Princeton University Orchestra was relatively small and largely student-led; after the conclusion of the first World War, however, Richard L. Weaver was appointed as the symphony's first proper Music Director. In 1935, the Music Director roles for both the University Orchestra and the University Glee Club were officially established as full-time positions within Princeton's Department of Music. Over the subsequent forty years, PUO grew to as many as sixty students, and Music Directors of the ensemble included Harold Berkeley, Mortiz von Bomhard, Russell Ames Cook, Nicholas Harsanyi, Robert S. Freeman, Peter T. Westergaard, Mordechai Sheinkman, and Bruce Ferden. = Expansion and growth = The modern history of PUO begins with the appointment of the orchestra's present Music Director, Michael J. Pratt, in 1977. Through the fifties and sixties, the ensemble shrank down to as few as thirty students amid \\"music-is-better-seen- than-heard\\" mentalities in music academia, as well as insufficient rehearsal and performance spaces on campus. Following Pratt's appointment to the orchestra's podium, this downward trend quickly reversed itself into an upwards explosion. In 1984, the orchestra's home, Alexander Hall, was renovated from a large auditorium into a professional-grade concert hall following generous support from David Richardson. Additionally, unprecedented interest in music performance among students, coupled with growth in the overall undergraduate class size and the development of Princeton's dedicated extracurricular hours (two hours every weekday during which classes are forbidden from meeting), allowed PUO to quickly expand into the large symphonic orchestra of over 100 students that it remains today. In response to students in the orchestra expressing a desire to continue as musicians after their studies at Princeton, Michael Pratt established the Music Department's Certificate Program in Music Performance in 1990, and he was a major architect in the general integration of performance into Princeton's wider curriculum. Undergraduate musicians in the Music Performance certificate receive complementary lessons and are eligible to spend a semester abroad studying at the Royal College of Music, which has been named one of the top music conservatories in the world. Following the creation of a strong music performance program, the conductor noted a significant upswing in Princeton University applicants with exceptional musical talent and interest, which in turn allowed the Princeton University Orchestra to grow into an even stronger ensemble, able to tackle any piece in the classical repertoire. In 2018, there were enough applicants to the incoming class alone to fill multiple large symphonic orchestras.  The orchestra today  Nowadays, the orchestra is recognized for its musical excellence, and its Music Director, Michael Pratt, has been named an honorary member of the Royal College of Music in London by Charles, Prince of Wales. The Princeton University Orchestra is now one of two undergraduate full-orchestras at Princeton University. The other undergraduate full-orchestra is the Princeton University Sinfonia, which is led by the associate conductor of PUO, Ruth Ochs PhD, and features a less-demanding rehearsal and concert schedule. Auditions for both orchestras, which are held in early September before Department of Music faculty, are open to all University students, and all returning members are required to re-audition. A week after the audition, students receive notice whether they have been tapped for one of the department orchestras. = The Lewis Arts Complex = Until 2017, the Princeton University Orchestra held rehearsals thrice per week in its home, Richardson Auditorium in Alexander Hall. In the fall of that year, following the grand opening of Princeton University's $330 million dollar performing-arts center, the orchestra's rehearsals were moved to the new 3,500 square-foot Lee Rehearsal Room, which was designed for the orchestra specifically and features both adaptive acoustics and equipment for high- fidelity audio recordings. During concert weeks, the orchestra returns to its home in Richardson Auditorium for dress rehearsals. In addition to housing a state-of-the-art rehearsal space, the New Music Building within the Lewis Arts Complex also features practice rooms and rehearsal studios suspended by wires for sound-isolation. All musicians in the Princeton University Orchestra receive discounted music lessons with department faculty in these rooms and are granted access to them for free. As stated by former University President Shirley Tilghman, who championed the planning and development of the new Lewis Arts Complex, the aim for the New Music Building is establish Princeton University as an international hub for art and music alike ‚Äî the hope is that Princeton is one day as well known to the world for its music and performing- arts as it is for its rigorous academics and research. = Repertoire and tour = The late-Romantics form the foundation of the Princeton University Orchestra's repertoire. The ensemble performs a work by Gustav Mahler roughly three out of every four years, and frequently collaborates with the Princeton University Glee Club on works that require a concert choir. In addition to performing large symphonic works from the established classical canon, the ensemble also gives frequent premieres of new works composed by faculty and even undergraduate students. Every season, there is one concerto concert that features musicians from the orchestra; concerto auditions are held in January. Thanks to generous donations from University Alumni, the Princeton University Orchestra tours internationally every other year; tour costs are funded entirely through the ensemble's shared endowment with the Glee Club. The Princeton University Orchestra's first international tour was to the United Kingdom in 1994. Since then, PUO has performed in Germany, Austria, the Netherlands, Czechia, Slovakia, Hungary, Spain, Portugal, and Ireland, among others. In late January 2019, the orchestra will return to Spain for concerts in Barcelona, Zaragoza, and Madrid. = Gustavo Dudamel Residency = In celebration of Princeton University Concerts' 125th anniversary, conducting sensation Gustavo Dudamel was chosen as the Princeton University artist-in- residence for 2018 ‚Äì 2019. Throughout the academic year, Dudamel will visit the campus for cross-disciplinary discussions, academic panels, and cultural celebrations. He has curated three chamber concerts in Alexander Hall that feature musicians from the Los Angeles Philharmonic, the Metropolitan Opera Orchestra, and the Berlin Philharmonic. As the culmination of his residency, Dudamel will conduct the Princeton University Orchestra and the Princeton University Glee Club twice in-concert, the first of which will be held in Richardson Auditorium, and the second of which will be held at the Trenton War Memorial. This will be Dudamel's first concert engagement with any university orchestra.

Bebinca originated from a tropical depression over the South China Sea on August 9. Maintaining this intensity for a few days near the Guangdong coast, the system intensified into a tropical storm south of Jiangmen on August 13. The storm moved slowly to the east and then curved back on the next day, before making landfall in the Leizhou Peninsula on August 15. Bebinca crossed the Gulf of Tonkin and made landfall in Vietnam on August 16, before dissipated on the next day. In China, 6 people were dead and the economic losses by the storm reached ¬•2.31 billion (US$333 million). In Vietnam, Bebinca killed 13 people. Moderate damage to agriculture and infrastructure were reported in Northern Vietnam, with heavy rains caused multiple landslides and blocked the road. Total damage in Vietnam were over ‚Ç´1.34 trillion (US$57.6 million). Meteorological history Late on August 9, the Japan Meteorological Agency (JMA) began to monitor a tropical depression over the South China Sea. The system generally moved northward slowly under a subtropical ridge, and then turned to northeast on the next day. Despite moving over warm waters, the depression remained poorly organized. It moved ashore near Hailing Island, Yangjiang, Guangdong Province at 10:35 a.m. CST on August 11 (02:35 UTC). The depression made an anti-clockwise loop inland and moved back to the sea later that day. The system moved slowly southeastward, because Yagi and Leepi in the northwestern Pacific prohibited the extension of the subtropical ridge, therefore the steering current remained weak for days in the South China Sea. After moving back to the sea, the depression gained some organization, and the Joint Typhoon Warning Center (JTWC) finally classified it as a tropical depression and gave the numerical designation 20W on August 12. After maintaining tropical depression status for more than 3 days, 20W finally intensified to a tropical storm and the JMA gave the international name Bebinca early on August 13. Throughout that day, Bebinca's low-level circulation center (LLCC) was exposed because of moderate to strong easterly wind shear. Despite this, the JTWC upgraded the system to a tropical storm later that day. Tropical Depression 20W lingering south of Guangdong, China on August 12 Bebinca remained a sheared cyclone on August 14, while continued to slowly drifting to the east. After Leepi made landfall in Japan and dissipated, the subtropical ridge can finally extend and build over China, and Bebinca began to curve back to the west. Although wind shear remained strong on August 15, Bebinca still began to intensify as it was situated over very warm waters with , and the system was able to develop a central dense overcast. Bebinca made its second landfall in Leizhou, Guangdong at 9:40 p.m. CST (13:40 UTC), and emerged to the Gulf of Tonkin about four hours later. Once moving into the warm waters of the Gulf of Tonkin, Bebinca began another intensification trend. This prompted the JMA to upgrade Bebinca to a severe tropical storm, but it was revoked in the post-storm analysis. Bebinca weakened slightly before making its third and final landfall in Nam ƒê·ªãnh Province, Vietnam at 5:30 a.m. ICT on August 17 (22:30 UTC on August 16), with winds of 75 km/h (45 mph). Bebinca weakened quickly once moving inland, and the JTWC issued its final warning early on August 17. The JMA also downgraded Bebinca to a tropical depression, and Bebinca dissipated later that day, over Laos. Preparation and impacts =China= Shortly after the formation of Bebinca, the Hainan Meteorology Administration warned that the rainfall in parts of the Hainan Island peaked at , with strong winds occurring in the Hainan Island and its nearby areas. As Bebinca meandering near the Guangdong coast, the agency urged that the northern part of the island were still affected by the strong winds and heavy rainfall on August 12‚Äì13. Wind gusts of were recorded at Haikou. Due to the slow movement of Bebinca, Hainan Island was affected by extremely heavy rains. Rainfall in Haikou peaked at while rainfall in Lingao County were at . Through out the country, 6 people were dead and the economic loss were at ¬•2.31 billion (US$333 million). =Hong Kong= The Hong Kong Observatory (HKO) issued the standby typhoon signal No. 1 at 5:15 p.m. HKT on August 9. Because of the slow movement of Bebinca, the standby typhoon signal No. 1 was hoisted for more than four days, the second-longest in recorded history. As Bebinca began to approach the Guangdong coast, the HKO raised the typhoon signal to No. 3 early on August 14. The HKO has warned that low-lying areas may be prone to flooding or backflow of seawater because of storm surge, and that members of the public should stay away from the shoreline due to rough seas. =Macau= The Direc√ß√£o dos Servi√ßos Meteorol√≥gicos e Geof√≠sicos (SMG) issued the signal No. 1 at 5:00 p.m. MST on August 9. As Bebinca began to approach the Zhujiang Delta, the SMG raised the signal to No. 3 early on August 11. Similar to Hong Kong, due to the slow movement of the storm, the signal No. 3 remained hoisted for more than three days, until it was replaced by signal No. 8 late on August 14. This broke the longest storm signal hoisted in recorded history. =Vietnam= Bebinca, known in Vietnam as ' (Typhoon No. 4), made landfall over northern Vietnam early on August 17 in local time. The storm brought strong winds and heavy rains to the region, killing 10 people and 3 went missing. Besides, Bebinca damaged thousands of houses, causing moderate damage to agriculture. Heavy rains triggered numerous landslides and lead to some road accidents. Damages in Ngh·ªá An Province were at ‚Ç´1.341 trillion (US$57.6 million).

Her mother had taken her on an airplane ride in the 1920s in Asbury Park, New Jersey and it inspired her as a young girl to want to be a pilot. Cronan earned her commercial pilot's license in 1941. She was personally invited by Jacqueline Cochran to join the Women's Airforce Service Pilots (WASP) in 1943. Cronan continued to fly after World War II, competing in air races. She joined the pilots' organization, the Ninety-Nines, in 1944. In 1948 she was unable to participate in an air race because she could not find anyone to watch her twin sons. She eventually taught her husband, Walter Cronan, to fly, but when he had an accident in an airplane, the couple decided that only one of them should fly.

Originally intended to be the first phase of a longer system, low ridership and decreasing revenues led to the second phase never materializing. Due to Portuguese federal laws that prohibit municipal assets to operate at a loss for three consecutive years, SATUOeiras was expected to close as early as 2014. The service was officially terminated on May 31, 2015 after nearly eleven years of operation. As part of the public‚Äìprivate partnership agreement, Teixeira Duarte assumed the deficit. Isaltino Morais, the former mayor of Oeiras who had originally been in power at the time of SATUOeiras's creation, was elected again as mayor in 2017 on a platform to reopen and expand the system. The municipality of Oeiras has since been in discussions for possible funding options. Currently the line's infrastructure remains but station entrances have been locked up to prevent public access. Route SATU's route had its southern terminus at Navegantes Station in the historic parish of Pa√ßo de Arcos. This station acted as a transfer to the Lisbon commuter rail network and was just over from Pa√ßo de Arcos Station on the Cascais Line. The route's northern terminus was Forum Station connected to the Oeiras Parque Shopping Center and not far from the Parque dos Poetas. Tapadas Station was located between the two termini and served a residential community and school. Phase two would have extended SATUOeiras an additional to Lagoas Park, a business park in Porto Salvo. Future phases would have extended the line even further to TagusPark and eventually Agualva-Cac√©m Station in Sintra, providing a link between the Cascais and Sintra Lines. Operations SATUOeiras utilized a MiniMetro automated people mover system on an elevated track. The rolling stock were two non-motorized cars that each had a capacity of 106 passengers. Cars were propelled by a cable system powered by an electric motor based at Navegantes Station, not unlike a cable car on a guided track. The line consisted of a single track which split into two at stations. SATUOeiras operated at four-minute intervals during peak times, but would also operate as an on-demand system at times of lowest ridership. During these times, riders would summon a SATU car by pressing a button at the station. Fares from SATUOeiras were not transferable to other public transport systems in the Lisbon region. A single fare was ‚Ç¨1.15 for a one-way trip or ‚Ç¨1.65 for a same-day return trip. SATU also offered an unlimited daypass for ‚Ç¨2.85, a 10-trip pass for ‚Ç¨6.15, and a 20-trip pass for ‚Ç¨10.25.

WorldCat. =Subsequent developments= The book was published at a time when there were still no known photographs of a live giant squid, which Ellis described as \\"the most elusive image in natural history\\". This soon changed as the first years of the 21st century saw a number of breakthroughs in live giant squid imaging that ultimately culminated in the first recordings of live animals in their natural deep-water habitat in July 2012. These events marked a turning point in the scientific understanding of the giant squid's life history and biology, which Ellis himself discussed in a TV interview, commenting: \\"now my book is a little obsolete\\". Synopsis The book consists of ten chapters covering the biology, mythology and history of the giant squid, as well as popular culture depictions and notable models thereof. An appendix lists all \\"authenticated giant squid sightings and strandings\\" known to the author (expanded from a similar list in Ellis's Monsters of the Sea), comprising 166 entries and spanning five centuries, from 1545 to 1996.

The > mix of all these sources, dissected and analyzed with an appropriate dash of > skepticism, and an occasional pinch of speculation, yields a volume that > surely will be read and re-read by the full range of readers from monster- > lovers to scientists. Martin Wells, a zoologist at the University of Cambridge, considered the book \\"serious and very well researched\\" and a \\"gold-mine of fact and fantasy, for we scientists who work on cephalopods and for all of us who love monsters\\".[Anonymous] (1999). New in paperback. Nature 401(6755): 743. Reviewing the work for The New York Times Book Review, Laura Miller agreed that it was \\"rigorously researched\\", but opined that some pages \\"contain more data than anyone but the most devoted squid buff could desire\\". This sentiment was echoed by David Wicinas in the University of Pennsylvania's Gazette, who wrote that though the book is \\"painstakingly researched [...] the sheer amount of data may daunt all but the most motivated readers\\". Biologist and author E. O. Wilson praised Ellis's writing style, remarking that he \\"uses his exceptional gifts in image and words to evoke the wonder and mystery of the sea\\". While giving an overall positive appraisal, Michael Dirda, writing for The Washington Post, commented that \\"Ellis's easygoing prose suffers from needless repetitions [...] The Search for the Giant Squid could have been more tightly edited and [...] just a bit flashier\\". But he concluded that \\"Ellis is fun to read, knowledgeable and enthusiastic\\" and praised Lyons Press for producing \\"a beautiful book, starting with its striking dust jacket (the author's own painting of a reddish giant squid with an enormous staring eye) and continuing with generous margins, thick paper and lots of drawings and photographs\\". The visual aspects of the work were also singled out as a strength in a review for Publishers Weekly, particularly its \\"30 b&w; photographs and 35 line drawings, many historical, several of the drawings by Ellis himself\\". The Adventure of the Giant Squid by N. C. Wyeth ( 1939), used as the cover illustration on certain editions of Ellis's Monsters of the Sea. Though fictional accounts often involve giant squid attacking boats, live animals found at the surface are almost invariably sick or dying, and no injuries resulting from such encounters have ever been documented. In a review for Whole Earth magazine, Jaron Lanier wrote: \\"Richard Ellis has written the definitive giant squid book, achieving a superb blend of scientific reporting and cultural history.\\" Similarly, in the malacological journal Folia Malacologica, Beata Pokryszko concluded that the \\"book combines history, zoology, adventure and myth in an admirable way\\", and the Publishers Weekly review described it as \\"an absorbing work of natural history and a classic of cryptozoology\\", in which \\"Ellis vivifies and celebrates [the giant squid] with erudition and consummate skill\\". Neurologist and writer Oliver Sacks likewise thought that Ellis had done a \\"splendid job bringing together virtually every known account (mythical, fictional, and factual), and producing a narrative at once gripping and meticulously balanced\\". Peter Benchley, whose 1991 novel Beast features a giant squid as its primary antagonist, wrote: \\"In researching an animal about which so little is known, Richard Ellis has managed to assemble an astonishing amount of material [...] This is an amazing book about an amazing creature.\\"The Search For The Giant Squid. ShowIdeas.com. [Archived from the original on 28 April 1999.] The Search for the Giant Squid was briefly featured in the March 1999 issue of Scientific American, under \\"The editors recommend\\", where it was noted for providing \\"a huge amount of information\\". A Booklist review called it \\"a fascinating compendium\\" and opined that \\"Ellis's illustrated books about sea creatures have long made delectable reading\\". David K. Bulloch, author of Underwater Naturalist and The Wasted Ocean, wrote: \\"Ellis has assembled a potpourri of ancient myth, rare sightings, and occasional bodily remains into a mosaic on Architeuthis, the Kraken, cryptic squids of the abyssal depths\\". Reviewing both The Search for the Giant Squid and Monsters of the Sea for Newfoundland and Labrador Studies, Jon Lien‚Äîonce a member of giant squid expert Frederick Aldrich's \\"squid squad\\"‚Äîwrote that the former \\"thoroughly covers our knowledge of this exciting creature\\" and \\"is enjoyable and informative but I found it a bit less interesting than [Monsters of the Sea]\\".Lien, J.

Newfoundland and Labrador Studies 16(2): 276‚Äì279. He was also of the view that \\"Ellis is hard on Aldrich's efforts to study [the giant squid] and on his speculations regarding its biology\\". =Later appraisal= Writing for Atlas Obscura in 2018, Eric Grundhauser opined that despite developments in the field since its publication, the book \\"is still the best read on the subject\\" and that \\"for anyone looking for a thorough primer on these mysterious creatures, this 1998 book remains essential\\".

The architect received over 300 requests for architectural drawings of the building in 1904, and the St. Louis Globe-Democrat said of the building, \\"This is the ideal ranch house that the St. Louis exposition has created, and if remembered for nothing else by western people, the world's fair will always be recalled by the constantly growing number of houses constructed after the fashion of Idaho's pretty building.\\"Reprinted in the Herald, Architecture The exterior of the 1-story building was 60 feet square with minimal decoration, cream colored walls, with windows six feet above ground. The roof was red clay tile. Inside the building, ten rooms surrounded a small courtyard and fountain. Interior rooms featured paneling and open beam ceilings of wood from Idaho's forests. Transparency photographs of Idaho scenery hung inside the windows, and Native American artifacts were displayed. A writer for the Omaha Daily Bee said that \\"Idaho's building is a cosy bungalow, with a great smoking room that has polished floors, bearskin rugs and other signs of elegant comfort.\\" Prizes The Idaho Building took second place among all state buildings exhibited at the fair. During the exhibition, Idaho received the grand prize for grains and agricultural products. Idaho also received 17 gold medals, 14 silver medals, and 22 bronze medals awarded to agricultural exhibitors. Idaho's fruit exhibit received the gold medal, and fruit exhibitors received 3 gold medals, 28 silver medals, and 26 bronze medals. Idaho's mineral exhibit received the gold medal, and mining and mineral exhibitors received one gold medal and eight silver medals. Governor and Mrs. Morrison Idaho governor John T. Morrison and his wife, Grace (Mackey) Morrison, attended the opening of the Idaho Building on May 14, 1904, and Mrs. Morrison served afternoon tea at the building, returning daily until the end of May. In 1905, Idaho Building architect J. Flood Walker designed the John T. Morrison House, located in Boise's State Street Historic District. The Morrison House is a chalet design, smaller yet similar to a former Idaho Building at the 1893 World's Columbian Exposition in Chicago. In September, 1904, the Idaho Building was purchased by J.C. Adams who later moved it on rail cars to San Antonio, Texas, where the building eventually became two adjacent houses.

Legal scholars and political scientists have characterized constitutional hardball as a threat to democracy, because it undermines shared understanding of democratic norms and undermines the expectation that the other side will comply with democratic norms. As a result, the use of constitutional hardball by one side of partisans encourages other partisans to respond in similar fashion. The concept stems from a 2004 article by Mark Tushnet of Harvard Law School.Tushnet, Mark V. (2004) Constitutional Hardball, PDF 37 J. Marshall L. Rev. 523-553 John Marshall School of Law Harvard University political scientists Daniel Ziblatt and Steven Levitsky have argued that democracies such as Argentina and Venezuela, shifted to authoritarianism in part through constitutional hardball, as Juan Per√≥n and Hugo Chavez used legal court- packing schemes to cement power. In the United States David Pozen, Professor of Law at Columbia Law School, wrote in 2018 that \\"the concept of constitutional hardball seemed to be passing into common usage\\" in the United States. Examples of constitutional hardball include the use of the debt ceiling to force others to agree to one's demands (hostage-taking), disenfranchising voters for the opposing party (voter suppression), routine use of the filibuster, routine refusal of appointments, court-packing, actions by lame-duck administrations and legislatures to curb the powers of incoming legislators and administrations, and using pardoning powers on oneself or one's associates. It has been suggested that the use of constitutional hardball in the United States Congress has strengthened the role of the executive in policy-making, as the President becomes more likely to use the powers of office to circumvent the legislature; Obama's use of executive orders is mentioned as an example of constitutional hardball.

It was the last steam engine built by Baldwin for the North American market. In 1976, it was moved to the B&O; Railroad Museum for static display. The engine was later purchased in 2014 by the Western Maryland Scenic Railroad which began operational restoration with the intention of returning it to service as the Western Maryland Scenic Railroad 1309. History Chesapeake & Ohio Railway 1309 was built by Baldwin Locomotive Works in 1949. It was the last Class 1 mainline locomotive built by Baldwin, maker of over 70,000 locomotives since 1832. It was ordered by the Chesapeake and Ohio Railway to pull heavy coal trains in the mountainous terrain of West Virginia and Kentucky which it did from 1949 until 1956, after which it was stored for twenty years at their roundhouse at Peach Creek, West Virginia. The engine, along with several others, all considered impractical to restore to working condition, were moved to the B&O; Railroad Museum in Baltimore, Maryland in 1976 for cosmetic restoration and static display. It remained there until 2014 when it was purchased by the Western Maryland Scenic Railroad for restoration. When returned to service, it will be the largest steam locomotive in regular scheduled service in the United States. The Western Maryland intends to use the locomotive on excursion trains between Cumberland and Frostburg, Maryland. Description No. 1309 was built from a 40-year-old design, with mechanical lubricators, stoker, and superheater, the last of a series of 2-6-6-2s that the C&O; began in 1911. A very similar design, the USRA 2-6-6-2, was chosen by the United States Railroad Administration as one of its standard designs thirty years earlier during World War I. The engine is a Mallet articulated locomotive. This design was a compound locomotive where steam was expanded once in smaller rear cylinders and the exhaust captured and expanded a second time in larger lower-pressure front cylinders. While compound locomotives are more efficient than single-expansion machines, their extra complication led to very few United States railroads using them after the turn of the century. The added length of two sets of cylinders required the engines to be articulated to enable operation on tight radius turns common in mountainous areas in West Virginia and Kentucky coal country, which added even more complication. It also had two cross compound air compressors mounted on the smokebox door to supply enough air for frequent heavy braking needed in mountain railroading. While complicated and uncommon, the C&O; had a long history with Mallets and they were ideal for slow speed work in West Virginia. The Chesapeake and Ohio ordered 25 of these engines in 1948 to pull coal trains. When coal production dramatically fell due to labor unrest in 1949, the order was revised to just ten engines (numbered 1300 to 1309), and 1309 became the last domestic steam locomotive built by Baldwin. Restoration The Western Maryland's restoration, which began in July 2014, includes returning all parts to meet or exceed original specifications. The railroad claims the engine will be \\"better and more reliable than it was in 1949\\". The engine and tender were disassembled and then rebuilt with new parts where necessary. The engine's cab and floors were among the pieces replaced. In early January 2017, the railroad said the reassembly process at the shop in Ridgeley, West Virginia would begin that month and announced that the inaugural trip of the restored engine would be on July 1, 2017; it began selling tickets for the excursion. That schedule was not met due to funding issues. The railroad had spent $800,000 but needed a matching grant of $400,000 from the state of Maryland to continue work. In August 2017, planned operation in November was further delayed until 2018 after corrosion was found on the locomotive's axles requiring additional work on the axles, wheel boxes, and crank pins. Restoration almost stopped in the fall of 2017 due to a lack of funding, although work on the wheels continued with donations. The railroad announced in November 2017 that restoration had stopped. $400,000 provided by the state of Maryland had been spent and the railroad estimated it would take at least $530,000 more to complete the restoration, including $120,000 for the running gear and $115,000 for the boiler. The railroad was soliciting donations from individuals, seeking additional grants, and raising money with \\"freight photo charters\\". In January 2018, Maryland state senator Wayne Norman proposed that Allegany County provide $530,000 to complete the restoration. The senator said there would be an economic benefit to the county in tourism, even drawing people from Europe and Asia. The county provides a $140,000 annual operating subsidy to the railroad, matched by $250,000 from the state of Maryland. In February 2018, the restoration project suffered another setback when the railroad learned that an employee had stolen parts, including bronze bearings and wear plates, and sold them for scrap at a salvage yard. The thefts were discovered by the Allegany County Sheriff's Office after they were alerted by the scrap yard. Stolen parts included 12 original crown brasses and 12 hub liners. The parts would have to be remade as they were damaged during removal. The scrap yard had paid the employee a total of $14,662 for the parts, some of which weighed . Formal charges have been filed against the employee. In June 2018, the boiler passed a hydrostatic test required by the Federal Railroad Administration. The boiler was pressurized to 25% above its maximum operation pressure of . Stationary test firings to check for boiler leaks occurred several months later. The restoration had cost $1.8 million as of mid-2018, including $800,000 provided by the state of Maryland. The Western Maryland Scenic General Manager estimated the final cost will be $2.4 million. In September 2019, the project was again halted due to a lack of funds shortly after the front drivers were attached to the engine. The railroad said it would no longer make estimates of when the restoration will be complete. The total spent on the project was at $2.8 million. As of February 2020, a new Crowdfunding campaign has been announced to try and raise the remaining $390,000 needed to finish the restoration. Once the money is raised, the organizers claim the restoration can be completed in six months. In early May 2020, restoration work resumed. A successful fund raising effort promoted by Trains Magazine raised over $100,000.00 to get the work started again. The WMSR estimates they are still around $200,000.00 short of completing the work and developing a fund to cover initial operating expenses and facilities for fuel, water, and ash removal to name a few items.Trains Magazine News Wire, May 13, 2020, \\"Work Resumes on Western Maryland Scenic #1309\\" The restoration of WMSR 1309 is expected to be completed in 2021.

Developed by the United States Navy's Naval Research Laboratory, it shared satellite space with and provided cover for the Navy's GRAB 2 (Galactic Radiation And Background), a secret electronic surveillance program. The satellite was launched atop a Thor DM-21 Ablestar rocket on June 29, 1961 along with Transit 4A and the University of Iowa's Van Allen Belts Injun 1 satellite. After reaching orbit, SOLRAD 3/GRAB 2 and INJUN 1 separated from Transit 4A but not from each other. Though this reduced SOLRAD 3's data-transmission ability by half, nevertheless, the satellite still returned valuable information regarding the sun's normal levels of X-ray emissions. The SOLRAD experiment package also established that, during solar flares, the higher the energy of emitted X-rays, the more disruption caused on the Earth's thermosphere (and radio transmissions therein). The GRAB mission was also highly successful, returning so much data on Soviet air defense radar facilities that an automated analysis system had to be developed to process it all. Background The United States Navy's Naval Research Laboratory (NRL) established itself as a player early in the Space Race with the development and management of Project Vanguard (1956‚Äì59), America's first satellite program. After Vanguard, the Navy's next major goal was to use the observational high ground of Earth's orbit to survey Soviet radar locations and frequencies. This first space surveillance project was called \\"GRAB\\", later expanded into the more innocuous backronym, Galactic Radiation and Background. As American space launches were not classified until late 1961, a co-flying cover mission sharing satellite space was desired to conceal GRAB's electronic surveillance mission from its intended targets. The field of solar astronomy provided such cover. Since the invention of the rocket, astronomers had wanted to fly instruments above the atmosphere to get a better look at the sun. The Earth's atmosphere blocks large sections of sunlight's electromagnetic spectrum, making it impossible to study the sun's X-ray and ultraviolet output from the ground. Without this critical information, it was difficult to model the sun's internal processes, which in turn inhibited stellar astronomy in general. On a more practical level, it was believed that solar flares directly affected the Earth's thermosphere, disrupting radio communications. The Navy wanted to know when its communications were going to become unreliable or compromised. Sounding rockets had shown that solar output was unpredictable and fluctuated rapidly. A long-term, real-time observation platform above the Earth's atmosphere ‚Äì in other words, a satellite ‚Äì was required to properly chart the sun's radiation, determine its effects on the Earth, and correlate it with ground-based observations of the sun in other wavelengths of light. Thus, the SOLRAD project was conceived to address several NRL goals at once: * to make the first long-term continuous observations of the sun in ultraviolet and X-ray light, and to correlate these measurements with ground-based observations. * to evaluate the level of hazard posed by ultraviolet and X-ray radiation. * to better understand the effect of solar activity (including solar flares) on radio communications. * to cheaply and efficiently produce a satellite for the GRAB surveillance mission by using a proven design. * to obscure the GRAB mission under a scientific cover. A dummy SOLRAD was successfully launched on April 13, 1960, and SOLRAD 1 went into orbit on June 22, 1960, becoming both the world's first surveillance satellite (as GRAB-1) and the first satellite to observe the sun in X-ray and ultraviolet light. SOLRAD 2, a duplicate of SOLRAD 1, was launched on November 30, 1960, but was lost when its booster flew off course and had to be destroyed. Spacecraft Like its two predecessors, SOLRADs 1 and 2, SOLRAD 3/GRAB 2 was a 51 cm diameter sphere based on the Vanguard 3 satellite. Unlike SOLRAD 1 and the abortive SOLRAD 2, the satellite's scientific package did not include Lyman-alpha photometers. This is because it had been discovered since SOLRAD 2's failed launch that the ultraviolet radiation level remained constant during solar flares. Instead, SOLRAD 3 carried two X-ray photometers designed to cover a greater range of wavelengths than the first SOLRAD. In addition to a photometer that, covered the same 2-8√Ö range as the earlier SOLRADS, SOLRAD also carried one that measured the bandwidth from 8-14√Ö. As was the case with most early automatic spacecraft, SOLRAD 2, though spin stabilized, lacked attitude control systems and thus scanned the whole sky with no source in particular. So that scientists could properly interpret the source of the X-rays detected by SOLRAD 2, the spacecraft carried a vacuum photocell to determine when the sun was striking its photometers and the angle at which sunlight hit them. SOLRAD 3/GRAB 2 was significantly heavier than its predecessors (25 kg versus 19 kg for SOLRAD 1, 18 kg for SOLRAD 2) as its GRAB package included equipment for monitoring two radar frequencies rather than just one, as in prior flights. In addition to monitoring Soviet air defense radars in the S band (1,550-3,900 MHz), GRAB 2 could also detect long-range air surveillance radars operating in the UHF band at around 500 MHz. Mission and science results SOLRAD 3's Thor Able Star takes off. SOLRAD 3/GRAB 2 was launched on June 29, 1961 at 04:22 UTC on a Thor DM-21 Ablestar rocket, along with Transit 4A and the University of Iowa's Van Allen Belts Injun 1 satellite from Cape Canaveral pad LC17B. Its course to orbit was more northerly than that of its predecessors to avoid the possibility of fragments falling on Cuba in the event of a mission failure (as had happened with SOLRAD 2). After reaching orbit, SOLRAD 3/GRAB 2 and INJUN 1 separated from Transit 4A but not from each other, causing them to rotate more slowly than planned. Moreover, because electro-magnetic interference generated by the spacecraft prevented ground controllers from requesting data from both spacecraft at the same time, SOLRAD 3/GRAB 2's transmissions were limited to odd-numbered days, INJUN's to even-numbered days; thus, data was only recovered for half of each satellite's lifetime. Nevertheless, the SOLRAD package on the satellite made several important findings. It established the Sun's normal X-ray radiation levels during times of inactivity at levels below 14√Ö in wavelength (less than 5√ó10‚àí3 ergs/cm2/sec). The satellite also found that the higher the hardness (energy level) of X-rays emitted during solar flares, the greater the disturbances and microwave bursts in the thermosphere, both affecting radio communications. GRAB results The GRAB 2 portion of the satellite began transmission of information on Soviet radars starting July 15, returning a large volume of information over the next fourteen months. As opposed to the cautious approach exercised by former President Eisenhower, President Kennedy did not require personal authorization for the satellite to receive and transmit collected data. As a result, data was collected quicker than analysts could process, and by October 1961, a new automated analysis system was implemented not only to process the backlog of existing data but also data from upcoming electronic surveillance flights and even the Air Force's SAMOS reconnaissance satellites. Legacy and status The SOLRAD/GRAB series flew twice more (both unsuccessful missions), finishing with the SOLRAD 4B mission launched April 26, 1962. In 1962, all U.S. overhead reconnaissance projects were consolidated under the National Reconnaissance Office (NRO), which elected to continue and expand the GRAB mission starting July 1962 with a next-generation set of satellites, code-named POPPY. With the initiation of POPPY, SOLRAD experiments would no longer be carried on electronic spy satellites; rather, they would now get their own satellites, launched alongside POPPY missions to provide some measure of mission cover. Starting with SOLRAD 8, launched in November 1965, the final five SOLRAD satellites were scientific satellites launched singly, three of which were also given NASA Explorer program numbers. The last in this final series of SOLRAD satellites flew in 1976. In all, there were thirteen operational satellites in the SOLRAD series. The GRAB program was declassified in 1998. SOLRAD 3 (COSPAR #1961-015B) is still in orbit (as of January 2019) and its position can be tracked.

Education Anderson received a B.A. in Psychology and Christian Ministries at Malone University and pursued graduate studies at Trinity Lutheran Seminary and Portland State University. He received an MDiv from the Earlham School of Religion and a PhD from Glasgow University. Research and Career =Thesis= Anderson's Glasgow thesis on The Christology of the Fourth Gospel (1996, 1997, 2010) found diachronic theories of John's composition insufficient in terms of stylistic, contextual, and theological evidence; and because 85% of its material is distinctive, with none of the contacts with other gospels being identical or verbatim, John's tradition is not derivative from Synoptic traditions. Anderson's monograph thus identified four sources of John's theological tensions: the dialectical thinking of the evangelist, the Jewish agency schema (Deut. 18:15-22), the dialectical Johannine situation (featuring several crises over several decades), and the rhetorical designs of the narrator. John's theological, historical, and literary riddles are unpacked more fully in Anderson's introduction to John (The Riddles of the Fourth Gospel, 2011), where his overall Johannine theory (the Dialogical Autonomy of the Fourth Gospel) is laid out as an improvement over alternative views. =Johannine Theory= Anderson's overall Johannine theory builds on the views of Bultmann, Schnackenburg, Brown, Barrett, Lindars, Borgen, Culpepper, and others, advancing three complementary paradigms. (1) In terms of composition, Anderson follows Lindars and Ashton inferring a basic two- edition theory, seeing John's first edition as the second gospel narrative constructed (ca. 80-85 CE), to which John the Elder (author of the Epistles) added the Prologue (John 1:1-18), 19:34-35, and chs. 6, 15-17, and 21) after the death of the Beloved Disciple (ca. 100 CE). (2) John's relations to the Synoptics sees John's first stages of development as reflecting an augmentation and modest correction of Mark (perhaps heard as it was narrated among the churches), thus featuring five signs of Jesus not included in Mark-- filling out the picture chronologically and geographically. Given that Luke departs from Mark over six dozen times in ways that coincide with John, Anderson builds on the view of Lamar Cribbs, who argued that the Johannine tradition was known by Luke. Likewise, the Q tradition shows evidence of some Johannine features (esp. Matt. 11:27; Luke 10:22) implying some sort of contact. The Matthean and later Johannine traditions (and perhaps the pre- Markan and early Johannine traditions) reflect some sort of cross-influence (or interfluence) regarding models of church governance (with Matthew) and illustrative details (with Mark). (3) The history of the Johannine situation reflects engagements with (a) Judean religious leaders and (b) followers of John the Baptist (30-70 CE); (c) leaders of local Jewish synagogues and (d) the impending Roman imperial cult (70-85 CE); and (e) traveling docetizing ministers and (f) tensions with emerging institutional Christian leaders such as the primacy-loving Diotrephes (3 John 9-10). (g) Engagements with synoptic and other gospel traditions continued from the beginning to the end of the Johannine tradition's development. These dialectical engagements within the emerging Johannine situation are largely sequential but somewhat overlapping, as issues never totally disappear but are displaced by more acute crises. =Dehistoricization of John= Given the fact that John's narrative reflects a self-standing Jesus tradition, despite being theologically developed, it deserves consideration as an overlooked resource for Jesus research. Anderson's monograph on The Fourth Gospel and the Quest for Jesus (2006) lays out the case for its historical contribution alongside other gospels, and in 2002, Anderson helped found the John, Jesus, and History Project at the Society of Biblical Literature. Since then, the project has received international scholarly engagement, having published essays by over two hundred New Testament scholars.Anderson, Paul. The John, Jesus, and History Project-New Glimpses of Jesus and a Bi-Optic Hypothesis Bible and Interpretation, February 2010. The project has published eight monographs, five of which Anderson has been a co-editor,John, Jesus, History SBL Retrieved 10 February 2019. Anderson's research has included the proposition that John has been dehistoricized in scholarship for its distinctive theological and narrative traits, which must be balanced with John's archaeologically detailed narrative and continuity with the Synoptic Gospels.Richeson, Michael. The Fight for the Fourth Gospel. George Fox Journal, 2010 This calls for a Fourth Quest for Jesus, in Anderson's view, as the first three have programmatically excluded John from the mix, and problematically so. =Popular work= Anderson has reviewed the six-part mini-series Finding JesusGordon, Seth.

Anderson also served on a team working on a new translation for the New American Bible. Reception According to James Charlesworth at Princeton Theological Seminary, Anderson's book The Fourth Gospel and Quest for Jesus (T&T; Clark) \\"is more than an exhortation to include John in the study of the historical Jesus; it is a polemic against the myopic use of the Synoptics.\\" Larry Hurtado has also received Anderson's work on the christology of John's Gospel in light of Johannine redaction criticism, writing that \\"in a recent study of unity and diversity in the Johannine presentation of Jesus, Paul Anderson has acutely and persuasively shown that such judgments reflect inaccurate readings of GJohn\\"Hurtado, Larry. Lord Jesus Christ: Devotion to Jesus in Earliest Christianity Eerdmans, 2005, 393-394. but also criticizes his suggestion that the Epistles of John reflect the separation of more than one secessionist group from John's community.Hurtado, Lord Jesus Christ, 416-7 On Anderson's work reassessing and challenging the traditional view that the Gospel of John features anti-Semitic tendencies, R.

Following the establishment of Voyageurs National Park in the 1970s, the Minnesota government finalized the donation of the property to the National Park Service (NPS) in 1987. The NPS continues to use the property as one of the four administrative and visitor entrances to Voyageurs. With The Kabetogama Ranger Station District contains 10 contributing properties: six buildings (a 1921 patrol cabin, 1935 ranger station/residence, 1935 warehouse, 1936 boathouse, 1936 oilhouse, and a 1937 privy), three structures (a 1933 retaining wall, circa-1936 tramway, and 1936 breakwater and moorage basin), and one site (the circular road system, laid down around 1935). The current Kabetogama Lake Visitor Center was built in 1988 and is considered a non- contributing property to the historic district. In 1993 the district was listed on the National Register of Historic Places for its local significance in the themes of architecture, conservation, landscape architecture, and social history. It was nominated for representing the construction and conservation projects of the CCC during the Great Depression, which provided immediate economic benefits and a lasting legacy embodied in distinctive National Park Service rustic architecture.

Publication history  Cover of Rigel-Interlunium After a first series of three volumes self-produced by the author from '99 to 2001 that did debut at Lucca Comics, Rigel becomes a small \\"publishing phenomenon\\", and in fact just two years after its debut, goes to publication with Panini Comics, first with the miniseries \\"Rigel Interlunium\\" that will be sold out and reprinted several times (the last in 2012 in deluxe-variant version) and then continue with the monographic Anedonia, giving life to a new narrative arc of the character. Rigel Interlunium is not in continuity with self-production. The titles of the three self-produced volumes are: * Rigel ‚Äì La Settima Congrega * Rigel ‚Äì Il requiem dell'unicorno * Rigel ‚Äì Creature dell'Altrove The self-production is now sold out since a long time, and in the new chapters produced by Panini Comics (Rigel Interlunium, composed of four volumes of 96 pages each) also participated Fabrizio Palmieri for the screenplay. Panini Comics then reissued the miniseries twice more times: initially, after the immediate sold out of the first edition, and again in 2012, dedicating to Rigel a variant deluxe edition with sixteen brand new pages and two new covers. Rigel's self- production was published under the Anatema label. It consists of three volumes plus a \\"spin-off\\" untitled T√¨nebra. Interlunium was produced by Panini Comics, under the Cult Comics label and is made up of four volumes published between 2002 and 2004. The Interlunium series, even if it includes some characters from the past self-production, is to be considered completely separated from it. In fact, between self-production and Interlunium there is no continuity. Even the graphic style changes a lot. The series was followed in 2014 by the one-shot monohraphic book volume Anedonia, consisting of 144 pages, again published by Panini Comics in 2014 and entirely written, screened and designed by Elena de' Grimani. The old characters, although not mentioned in this monographic (apart from the cat-familiar \\"Sortilegio\\") are always present in the setting of the comic. It is therefore an evolution of the character on a character level, but not a zeroing of the original setting: nothing of what happened in Interlunium is denied or canceled. The self-contained volume \\"Rigel-Anedon√¨a\\" therefore simply means the narration of the phase of passage and change of the nature of Rigel between the two narrative arcs: the old course, and what will come in the future. The metal band Rammstein authorized the full use of \\"Sonne\\" lyrics for a whole sequence of the book. Other episodes of Rigel have been published in the Vampire and Concrete anthology magazines published by Absoluteblack. In 2008 a special monographic book with Rigel as main character, with the title Gioco di Sangue, is published by Cartoon Club as \\"one shot\\" for the \\"Rimini Comix\\" comicbook fair.  Characters = Rigel = Rigel is a vampire of about eight centuries. She's a \\"child chosen by the fire\\". It possesses, in other words, particular powers due to a particularly powerful and rare blood (only seven girls for each generation have this type of blood). Because of this his parents, accused of witchcraft, were burned on the Death at the stake fire when she was very young. Or at least this is the version that has always been told, as Rigel remembers very little of his past as a human. He continued to live with his aunt and uncle brother Caleb (of whom he has not remembered since he was a vampire) and the cat Sortilegio. Meanwhile, one sorcerer and vampire, Artemius, began to study her, introducing herself to her as imaginary friend and ending, once she grew up, for fall in love. At [Caleb's death (for reasons still unknown to readers), Rigel attempted suicide. She was found almost bloodless by Artemius, who, in order not to lose her, turned her into a vampire. To allow this, since the blood left in Rigel was not enough, he gave her half his soul. Being a character created by the author in 1999, with the passing of the years and of the publications, Rigel has undergone various evolutions both graphic and of character. In the monographic Rigel-Anedon√¨a released in 2014 for Panini Comics, the vampire manages to free herself from her \\"human side\\" after ten years of \\"torpor\\". The setting and the supporting characters will remain the same (as far as in this monographic see only Sortilegio), and the \\"world\\" of the character remains the same as \\"Rigel- Interlunium\\". It is the nature of the character itself that changes, without anything that has been narrated in \\"Interlunium\\" being denied or canceled, including supporting characters and settings. In fact, \\"Rigel-Anedon√¨a\\" is a passage book between the old and the new narrative arc. As is well-specified in the introduction of the last released graphic novel, it is not by chance that this monograph is titled \\"Anedonia\\": this passage story in fact is meant to be a metaphor of depression, on how to isolate from the world (Rigel in fact \\"disappears\\" hiding under the ground for ten years, letting herself go into a \\"torpor\\" as a clear will and decision to close all contacts, and at the same time \\"emprisons\\" metaphorically his human part ‚Äì that was her peculiar characteristic, the only thing that made her able to experience feelings and emotions, making her different from other undeads, in a \\"glass sphere\\" that isolates her soul from everything, and then continues to live in the real world but without being able to \\"taste\\" anything, thus protecting itself from pain ... but also from positive feelings.

These markers were a pair earthen mounds and denoted the distance in ri () to Nihonbashi, the \\"Bridge of Japan\\", erected in Edo in 1603.They were typically planted with an enoki or Japanese red pine to provide shelter for travelers. Since the Meiji period, most of the ichirizuka have disappeared, having been destroyed by the elements, modern highway construction and urban encroachment. In 1876, the \\"Ichirizuka Abolition decree\\" was issued by the Meiji government and many were demolished at that time. Currently, 17 surviving ichirizuka are designated as national historic sites. In the case of the Tarui ichirizuka, there is only a single mound, which is located on the southern side of the Nakasend≈ç, one of the major routes between Edo and Kyoto. This marker is 112 ri from Nihonbashi. The mound is also located near the site of the Battle of Sekigahara, and was erected on the location of the field headquarters of Asano Yoshinaga.

Bryan by an extremely narrow quarter percent margin. Background In 1862, Sherman had appointed a committee which recommended that Chicago pass a new city charter which would annex Bridgeport and Holstein, lengthen the terms for mayor, treasurer, collector, city attorney, and clerk of police each from one to two years. Ultimately, such a charter and measures came to pass before the 1863 mayoral election. This made 1863 the first mayoral election held to a two-year term. Since his 1862 mayoral victory, Sherman had, in October 1962, lost a congressional election to Isaac N. Arnold.Rogues, Rebels, And Rubber Stamps: The Politics Of The Chicago City Council, 1863 To The Present by Dick Simpson, Routledge, Mar 8, 2018 (page 30) The election was held on April 21.https://www.chipublib.org/mayor-francis-cornwall-sherman-biography/ It was the third of four Chicago mayoral elections which took place during the course of the American Civil War. Tensions between the two parties were strong in the spring of 1863. Alderman C.P. Holden (Sherman's 1862 mayoral opponent) had introduced several resolutions which Sherman vetoed for being too partisan. Republicans sought to see Democrats provide greater support for war measures, while Democrats were critical of President Lincoln's handling of the war. At the time the Common Council's swing vote was Alderman Shimp, a Democrat voted with the Republicans. Campaigning The Republican (National Union) party nominated Thomas B. Bryan. He had previously been an unsuccessful candidate in the 1861 mayoral election. The Democratic Party renominated Mayor Sherman. Bryan had been a reluctant candidate, as was the case when he ran in 1861. Sherman's candidacy benefited immensely from the support of Irish and German voters from the newly-annexed neighborhoods of the city. The Chicago Tribune characterized Sherman as being sound in his position on the war, but criticized his affiliation with the Chicago Times and copperheads. The Bridgeport ward of Chicago was nicknamed the \\"Egypt of Chicago\\". Democrats believed the ward alone would secure Sherman's victory, a prediction which ultimately proved true. Results With the exception of the nullified March 1844 mayoral election, Sherman's margin of victory was the narrowest in Chicago mayoral election history. By winning this election, Sherman became the first individual to be elected to three terms as mayor of Chicago. In the Common Council elections held simultaneously, nineteen Democrats and twelve Republicans were elected, with an additional seat being vacant. Nearly the entire Democratic ticket was elected by majorities between 250 and 300 votes. =Controversy= With a narrow vote, Republicans claimed that the Democrats had won through electoral fraud. They appointed a committee to investigate, and Bryan notified Sherman that he would contest the result. Ultimately, Bryan did not contest. While he believed that he had received a majority of the legal votes, and was pressured by friends to contest the election he was not greatly enough concerned about the result of the election to pursue the process of contesting it.

Season 2 was released on DVD and Blu-ray in the United Kingdom on October 22, 2018 and worldwide on November 13, 2018.  Reception  Rotten Tomatoes reported a 89% approval rating for the second season based on 83 reviews, with an average rating of 8.35/10. The website's critical consensus read \\"The Crown continues its reign with a self-assured sophomore season that indulges in high drama and sumptuous costumes.\\" On Metacritic, the second season holds a score of 87 out of 100, based on 27 critics, retaining the first season's indication of \\"universal acclaim\\". Foy and Smith both earned significant praise from critics. Chancellor Agard of Entertainment Weekly wrote \\"As always, Claire Foy turns in an amazingly restrained performance.\\" Reviewing the first episode, Gabriel Tate of The Daily Telegraph wrote that Foy and Smith have \\"seldom been better\\". Hugo Rifkind of The Times said \\"While ardent monarchists might bristle at the way this is going, for the rest of us it's getting better and better.\\" Alison Keene of Collider said \\"each new episode makes its mark and tells its own complete story... It's another exceptionally strong season of television, full of compelling drama and sweeping grandeur.\\" Krutika Malikarjuna of TV Guide argued that the public is attracted to the royals' celebrity and star power, and said: \\"The brilliance of this framing becomes clear as the show evolves into The Real Housewives of Buckingham.\\" Sophie Gilbert wrote for The Atlantic that the portrayal of a monarch who \\"would rather be living any other life\\" is \\"riveting\\", and that it is \\"gorgeously shot, with flawless re-creations of everything from the Throne Room in Buckingham Palace to a 1950s hospital ward. And it's surprisingly funny.\\" The Wall Street Journal critic John Anderson said \\"The Crown attains genuine sexiness without sex. Margaret, √† la Ms. Kirby's interpretation, smolders, as does Elizabeth, at least on occasion.\\" Meghan O'Keefe of Decider wrote that the season \\"continues to romanticize the British royal family, but the romance comes from how they're normal, not divine\\". Less complimentary reviews saw the season criticised for what some regarded as failing to meet the emotional intensity of the first. John Doyle wrote for Globe and Mail that despite being \\"lavishly made\\" and \\"breathtaking\\", it \\"now leans toward a three-hanky weeper about marriage. It is less than it was, like the monarchy itself, and of interest to monarchy fans only.\\" Alan Sepinwall of Uproxx added \\"Many of the season's wounds are self-inflicted\\" and that Prince Philip \\"still comes across as a whiny man-child\\". Phil Owen of The Wrap described the season as \\"trashy\\" and saw dry comedy in Northam's portrayal of Prime Minister Anthony Eden: \\"I'm assuming that creator Peter Morgan meant for it to be comedy. There's really no other explanation for why Jeremy Northam played Prime Minister Anthony Eden like he's having a nervous breakdown in every scene.\\"  References  Category:2017 American television seasons Category:2017 British television seasons Category:Cultural depictions of Elizabeth II Category:Cultural depictions of Winston Churchill Category:Cultural depictions of John F.

Herrero studied in Madrid and later in both Paris and Brussels before he began his profession in pediatrics in his hometown of Alicante where he served his entire life. He was arrested during the Spanish Civil War but released not long after his arrest after the Alicante populace demanded his release. He dedicated himself to aiding the poor and would often visit poorer neighborhoods in order to tend to children. His services as a doctor earned him several accolades in his later life including an appointment to the town's civic council. Herrero's reputation for holiness had been noted during his life to the point that the bishop presiding over his funeral said he would initiate his beatification cause; it opened in the 1990s and he became titled as a Servant of God. Herrero was named as Venerable in 2017 after Pope Francis confirmed that the late doctor had lived a life of heroic virtue. Life Pedro Herrero Rubio was born in Alicante on 29 April 1904 as the sole child born to Pedro Herrero Mart√≠nez and Emilia Rubio Cabrera. Herrero studied under the Marists in his hometown before doing additional studies at the Santo Domingo de los Jesuitas school in Orihuela under the Jesuits. He studied medicine from 1924 in Madrid in the Facultad de San Carlos in the Madrid college where he first specialized in gynecology though later switched to pediatrics. He also studied in both Paris (at its main college from 1927 after receiving a scholarship) and Brussels and then following the completion of his studies began working in Alicante. Herrero was a student of the Nobel Prize recipient Santiago Ram√≥n i Cajal and the future Prime Minister Juan Negr√≠n L√≥pez. Herrero dedicated himself to the poor of his hometown (also working with the Red Cross on occasion) and would often use his own material resources in order to render aid to those poorer families that sometimes could not afford proper medical care. Herrero also visited poorer neighborhoods often in order to care for ill children. He also did not hesitate in baptizing children who were in danger of death irrespective of whether or not those children came from Catholic backgrounds. He married Patrocinio Javaloy Liz√≥n on 29 April 1931 but the couple had no children. During the Spanish Civil War the anti-religious sentiment forced him to receive the sacraments in secret in clandestine Masses. Herrero was arrested in 1937 in Alicante during the conflict though was released soon after in 1938 after women and workers from his hometown demanded his release based on his generous dedication to their health in his work as a doctor. Upon his arrest he was moved to Valencia where he was jailed in the Santa √örsula convent that had been remodeled into a prison. Upon his release he would tend to victims wounded in the conflict. From 1954 until 1960 he served as a councilor in his hometown because the provincial governor appointed him for his characteristics and dedication and not because Herrero had a certain political affiliation. In October 1970 he was given a position to an important medical commission in recognition of his services while in October 1974 was given a golden medal for his work. In June 1976 he was awarded the First Class Cross and White Badge of the Civil Order of Charity and granted the title of Illustrious Son of Alicante in recognition for his work and for the impact he had on the lives of others in Alicante. During a train trip he suffered a hernia prompting him to be admitted to hospital where he was diagnosed as having an intestinal obstruction. He was admitted for an operation but died in the operating room in the Hospital de Sant Pau in Barcelona on 5 November 1978. During his funeral the diocesan Bishop Pablo Barrachina Estevan announced that he would initiate the steps for the late doctor's beatification cause thus attesting to the strong reputation for holiness that Herrero had in life. Beatification process Bishop Pedro Barrachina Estevan announced during Herrero's funeral that he would initiate the steps leading to the beatification process and in 1991 the Bishop (now cardinal) Francisco √Ålvarez Mart√≠nez announced that he had authorized further steps to enact the cause. Herrero became titled as a Servant of God on 28 January 1997 after the Congregation for the Causes of Saints issued the official \\"nihil obstat\\" decree (no objections to the cause) thus enabling for the cause to proceed with their approval. The diocesan process was initiated under Bishop Victorio Oliver Domingo on 30 June 1997 and was closed on 9 June 1998; the C.C.S. issued a decree on 21 May 1999 validating the process as having complied with their regulations for conducting causes. In 2011 the postulation - officials in charge of the cause - submitted the Positio dossier to the C.C.S. for assessment. This dossier included documentation and witness interrogatories essential to exploring Herrero's life and reputation for holiness. Herrero became titled as Venerable on 27 February 2017 after Pope Francis confirmed that he had lived a model life of heroic virtue. His beatification depends on the papal confirmation of a miracle - in most cases a healing - that both medicine and science cannot explain. One such case was investigated under a diocesan tribunal and received validation from the C.C.S. on 9 March 2007. The current postulator for this cause is Dr. Silvia M√≥nica Correale.

It is found from Indochina to the south-west Pacific. Description Schoenorchis micrantha is a small epiphytic herb that forms small, tangled clumps. It has thin, curved, twisted, branched stems long and many thick, curved fleshy, linear leaves long and wide. Between five and thirty densely crowded, tube- shaped to bell-shaped white flowers, about long and wide are arranged on a flowering stem long.

The side lobes are short and erect and the middle lobe is short with a short spur. Flowering occurs between April and July. Taxonomy and naming Schoenorchis micrantha was first formally described in 1825 by Carl Ludwig Blume from an unpublished description by Caspar Reinwardt and the description was published in Bijdragen tot de flora van Nederlandsch Indi√´. The specific epithet (micrantha) is derived from the Ancient Greek words mikros meaning \\"small\\" or \\"little\\" and anthos meaning \\"flower\\".

The film got the attention of the faith-based filtering service VidAngel, which was embroiled in a copyright infringement lawsuit with major Hollywood studios and thus seeking original content to distribute. VidAngel suggested putting the short film on Facebook as a concept pilot to generate interest for Jenkins' idea of a multi-season series. The short film received over 15 million views around the world.Largest-Ever Crowdfunding Campaign for a TV Show Issues Equity to Investors (The Hollywood Reporter) Jenkins was introduced to video marketing strategist Derral Eves and the two partnered to create and own The Chosen, with Eves as executive producer.

In XX, Eves, Jenkins and others worked with an investment bank to raise $13 million in financing for the project. Consulted by a Messianic rabbi, a Catholic priest, and an evangelical professor, the show has an evangelical tendency. VidAngel, along with Eves and Jenkins, turned to crowdfunding to raise money to produce the first season, utilizing a provision of the JOBS Act of 2016 which allows companies to use equity crowdfunding to offer a share of ownership and profits from the company to online investors, rather than the arbitrary \\"perks\\" offered by regular crowdfunding. At the end of the first fundraising round in January 2019, the project had raised over $10.2 million from over 16,000 investors, unseating Mystery Science Theater 3000 as the top crowdfunded filmed project.Story about life of Jesus emerges as largest crowdfunded entertainment project in history (Fox News) Each investor received equity in the show and is regulated by the US Securities and Exchange Commission (SEC).

Named after its parent station, 5 Plus served as complementary channel for 5 with its programs primarily produced by its sports division, ESPN5. 5 Plus was launched on January 13, 2019, as AksyonTV, a Filipino-language news channel launched by TV5 in 2011, bifurcated into two new separate channels (the other one being One PH on Cignal). However 14 months after its launch, on March 7, 2020, 5 Plus ceased its broadcasting to give way for One Sports. History Prior to January 13, 2019, the network was known as AksyonTV, a 24-hour news channel launched by TV5 Network (then known as ABC Development Corporation) in February 2011 after taking over the airtime of NBC television and radio stations In 2010 (TV5 Network was acquired by NBC's parent MediaQuest Holdings from the Cojuangco / Media Prima group earlier that March). Its original programming included simulcasts from Radyo5 and independently produced newscasts and information programs from News5. However, in June 2013, AksyonTV began to carry over the sports programs from AKTV, a primetime and weekend block of Sports5 airing over government- sequestered Intercontinental Broadcasting Corporation (IBC), after TV5 decided not to renew its agreement with IBC due to high airtime costs and low ratings.MediaQuest block time agreement with IBC ends in May, MVP says retrieved January 10, 2019 This move was heavily criticized by viewers for putting news programs and coverage on-hold. Such move, as well as losses and cost-cutting measures by TV5 Network, forces all news and current affairs programs produced by AksyonTV to be cancelled, leaving Radyo5 simulcasts intact (which in turn, is hampered by the addition of home shopping programs). Cignal, a sister company of TV5, soon launched its 24-hour satellite news channel, One News which combines the news content of the media companies owned by MediaQuest, including News5 on May 28, 2018, replacing News5-owned Bloomberg TV Philippines. AksyonTV continued to reformat its programs in 2017, as the network started airing reruns of American series that air or aired on TV5, including Arrow and Supernatural, as well as the movie block Movie Max 5, home shopping and classic programs of TV5 in lieu of live sports programming. Following TV5's relaunch as 5 in February 2018, shifting its position from a general entertainment network to a network focusing heavily on news and sports, on November 30, T5N announced that AksyonTV will be relaunched as 5 Plus on January 13, 2019. The new channel carried \\"atypical sports\\" programming with additional coverage from ESPN5 and new sports-related contents which would target a younger, more adventurous audience or the millennials. Selected Radyo5 simulcast programs and other news content were later moved to a new stand-alone satellite Filipino news, One PH on Cignal, effectively bifurcating AksyonTV into two separate channels, with 5 Plus taking over analog channel 41 and digital subchannel channel 5.2 by DWET-TV. Upon the appointment of Jane Basas as president and CEO of TV5 in June 2019, 5's morning sports programming moved to 5 Plus. It included the National Football League and the NCAA (U.S.). The vacated morning block on the flagship station was used for reruns of old entertainment programs and expanded movie blocks. On March 7, 2020, the channel was officially dissolved as One Sports took over its channel space the following day. Meanwhile, the original Cignal TV channel was renamed to One Sports+. The former space of the channel on Cignal channel 15, However, Was still operating, showing a test card of a promotion launch of One Sports, and was removed on March 30 upon temporary sign off of One Sports, due to coronavirus pandemic. Final programming 5 Plus' programming included extreme sports, collegiate sports, e-sports, sports entertainment, and other sports-related content. Occasionally as time permits, the network would take on the responsibility of airing sports programs produced by ESPN5 in the event that 5 was unable to carry them due to breaking news or any special programming. A selection of 5 Plus' sports coverage will be made available online through their official website and various social media platforms. 5 Plus is now home to the NFL and NCAA (U.S.). This is due to the decision of 5 to reformat its daytime lineup, which affected the schedules of both sporting leagues. Also, during to the 2019 Southeast Asian Games, the NFL games were aired on a delayed, late night timeslot instead during days when the games were aired.

Early life Fletcher was born in Durham, North Carolina in 1940. He dropped out of high school and worked a number of jobs, including driving an ambulance, working as a party clown, and he claimed to have run a topless bar. He left Durham in 1970, after being convicted for writing bad checks five times and facing lawsuits for unpaid debts. In May 1971, Fletcher married Shirley Connour, a singer and musician who performed with a traveling evangelist. They had a son, John Wesley Jr, in September 1973. Career During the 1970s, Fletcher became an Assemblies of God pastor with an evangelical foundation located in Oklahoma City and started making regular appearances on the PTL Club television program towards the end of the decade. Downfall and later years In 1980, PTL Club host Jim Bakker became estranged from his wife, Tammy Faye Bakker, and he asked Fletcher to \\"bring [him] a woman\\". Fletcher arranged for church secretary Jessica Hahn to meet Bakker. Hahn later claimed that Fletcher and Bakker subsequently raped her but both claimed to have had a consensual sexual encounter with her. The following year, the Assemblies of God defrocked him after allegations of homosexuality were made against him. Other sources state he was defrocked twice for alcoholism. In early 1987, Fletcher came to national attention when news of the sexual encounter was made public. Fletcher subsequently told Penthouse that he had had sex with Bakker three times, and he repeated the claim in front of a grand jury. Bakker denied these claims under oath. Fletcher gave conflicting statements to the grand jury about whether sex was the only reason that he arranged Hahn to meet Bakker and was charged with perjury. He pleaded guilty and Judge Robert Daniel Potter sentenced him to three years' probation in May 1990. During the scandal, Fletcher attempted suicide twice and his wife of 18 years divorced him. He filed for bankruptcy and his ministry collapsed. In 1989, Fletcher was arrested twice for public intoxication and he had his license revoked after being arrested for driving under the influence. Fletcher stated that he \\"lost all that's dear and precious to me because I was loyal to [Bakker].\\" At the time of his sentencing, he had been working as a roofer. Death On June 21, 1996, Fletcher died at the age of 56 in Hillsborough, North Carolina.

The intervention was an involvement in the Russian Civil War on the side of the White movement, but ended in failure. Reasons behind the campaign On 11 November 1918, the German Army capitulated on the Western Front, which created a vacuum in German-controlled Ukraine. Fighting broke out between Bolshevik, White Russian and Ukrainian Independist forces. French Prime-Minister Georges Clemenceau decided to send an International French-led expedition to Ukraine, to assure the retreat of the Germans, to stop the spread of Bolshevism and to establish an economic sphere of influence. In their attempt to give the expedition an International character, the French only found a response in Greece, when Eleftherios Venizelos decided to send a sizeable contingent (the 2nd and 13th Divisions) under Major General Konstantinos Nider, aiming to gain support for Greek claims in the ongoing peace negotiations. Also some Polish, Romanian and Czech units arrived in the following months. Command of the expedition was given to general Henri Bertholot, commander of the French Army of the Danube in Romania.  The intervention  The situation in Ukraine in December 1918 was very complex. There was the German-backed Hetman of Ukraine Pavlo Skoropadskyi, who had just been overthrown by the Nationalist Ukrainian People's Republic, led by Symon Petliura. Then there was the Pro-Russian White Volunteer Army led by Anton Denikin. Further there were the Bolshevik forces, which had invaded Ukraine and were marching upon Kiev. Finally, there were also a number of independent smaller armies or bands, which switched sides at their convenience. The French landed in Odessa on 18 December 1918, in Sevastopol on 26 December, and in Nikolaev (now Mykolaiv), Kherson and Tiraspol in January 1919. In Odessa, an 7-hour battle ensued between the French and the forces of the Ukrainian People's Republic before they gained full control of the city. They found a very tense situation between Petliura's Ukrainian Army and the White Volunteer Army. They were also appalled by the lack of discipline and military qualities of their Russian allies. Another unpleasant surprise was the hostile reaction of the population towards the French and especially towards the Greeks, who were seen as invaders and not as liberators. All these factors increased the war-weariness amongst the Allied troops, some of which even became susceptible to Bolshevik propaganda. By the end of January 1919, Berthelot complained that he still had less than 3,000 soldiers to occupy all of Ukraine, and that he needed 20 divisions in total. But in the meantime, the Bolsheviks and their allies had already come to the same conclusion. = Kherson, Nikolaev and Odessa = A local warlord, Ataman Nikifor Grigoriev, aligned himself with the Bolsheviks on 18 February 1919 and advanced his army against the foreign invaders. With his army of 10-12,000 men, he first attacked Kherson on 2 March which was occupied by just 150 French, 700 Greek and a few hundred Volunteers of questionable reliability. After heavy fighting, the city was taken on 9 March, and the allied soldiers were evacuated by the French Fleet under cover of an intense bombardment. The allied soldiers not only had to fight the forces of Grigoriev, but had also come under sniper fire from inhabitants of the city. The French lost 4 killed and 22 wounded, while the Greeks had some 250 casualties. Local Greek residents were also killed in the aftermath. After the conquest of Kherson, Grigorev turned his forces against Nikolaev, where there were even less allied troops present. There were still 12,000 well equipped German troops in the city, but they had no intention to participate in the fighting. The local French commander was allowed to negotiate a truce with Grigoriev, and on 14‚Äì16 March all allied and German troops were evacuated by sea without any fighting, leaving considerable quantities of war material behind. These defeats to a disorderly and partisan band greatly undermined Allied prestige. The White force's confidence in the permanence of the Allied regime in Odessa was shaken, and the Allied troops' morale collapsed when they realised they would have to engage in fighting. The morale of the French troops and the sailors of their fleet in the Black Sea was already low, and most wanted to be demobilised and sent home. The morale of the Greek and Polish interventionist forces was no better. The allies fell back on their last stronghold, Odessa, where the situation looked very grim. Although they had 25,000 soldiers in the city, the strength of Grigoriev's Army was now estimated between 30,000 and 40,000 men. The allies were outnumbered, their forces were discouraged, there was a shortage of supplies and revolution was simmering amongst the population. The Bolsheviks blockaded the city and supplies were so short that ships could not sail, meaning that ties with the outside world were now endangered. Bertholot, who had asked for reinforcements several times, asked to be relieved of his command on 16 March. In the meantime, the pro-Bolshevik forces, now some 17,000 men strong, approached the city from the North, easily overrunning Berezovka (now Berezivka) on 18 March and Ochakov (now Ochakiv) a few days later. Supreme Commander of the Allied Army of the East, Franchet d'Esperey, arrived in Odessa on 20 March and quickly concluded that an evacuation was unavoidable. The situation in Odessa was tense, since all political groups in the city (with the exception of the extreme right) deplored the French actions. Representatives of the city Duma, local Mensheviks and Socialist Revolutionaries all protested against the violation of Russia's sovereignty.Kenez, p. 189 Franchet D'Esperey asked General D'Anselme to start preparations for the evacuation, but he didn't inform the Volunteer Army nor the Greek allies. On 29 March, Franchet d'Esperey received permission from Clemenceau for the withdrawal. On 1 April Franchet d'Esperey ordered D'Anselme to execute his evacuation plan and by 6 April, all allied troops, their material and some 50,000 civilians had left the city. Not every one was evacuated over sea, a large part of the Army marched to Romania. File:Men of the 5-42 Evzone Regiment, Odessa 1919.jpgGreek troops in Odessa.

File:Entry of the Red Army in Odessa, April 1919.jpgEntry of Grigoriev's Army in Odessa, April 1919. = Sevastopol and the Crimea = Clemenceau urged Franchet d'Esperey to hold on to Sevastopol and the Crimea as a bastion for further action in Southern Russia, but the problems here were the same as in Odessa. By 14 April there were only 7,000 allied soldiers in, including 2,000 Greek and 1,500 Algerian and Senegalese troops. On 3 April, Bolshevik forces (2nd Ukrainian Soviet Army) had already easily broken through the Perekop Isthmus and were advancing quickly towards Sevastopol, reaching the outskirts of the city on 14 April. A first attack was launched upon the city on 16 April, but beaten off by artillery fire from French ships. The next day, the French asked for a truce to evacuate the city. On 19 April a mutiny broke out on the French ships France and Jean Bart from a combination of war-weariness, Communist sympathizers in the crew, and difficult conditions. The mutiny was suppressed, but delayed the evacuation until 29 April, when the Bolsheviks entered the deserted city.  Reasons for the failure  The Allied intervention was a complete failure for several reasons: * The invasion was badly organized, insufficiently supplied and ill-defined in its objectives. * There was war-weariness among the Allied troops, who had more sympathy for the Reds than for the Whites, what even led to refusals to obey orders and mutinies. * The population in Southern Russia was predominantly hostile to the allied troops. * The Bolshevik military opposition was disciplined and efficient, while the White soldiers in the region were of little military value.  Aftermath  Allied policy turned from direct intervention to indirect aid to the White forces and a diplomatic cordon sanitaire against the Bolsheviks. Odessa was soon retaken by the Russian White Army, but finally by the end of 1920 the Soviet Red Army managed to overpower both the Ukrainian and Russian White Army and secure Ukraine.

Friedrich David Gr√§ter (1768 - 1830) was one of the founders of the field of Scandinavian studies and Germanic philology in Germany. A native of Schw√§bisch Hall, Gr√§ter studied theology, philosophy, and philology in Halle and Erlangen. He worked as a gymnasium teacher of Greek and Hebrew in Schw√§bisch Hall from 1804 as rector. He was a member of Pegnesischer Blumenorden from 1781 and member of the Berlin Academy of Sciences from 1792. He married Christiane Spittler in 1799. They had no children and divorced in 1803. In 1805, Gr√§ter married Maria Elisabetha, n√©e Hofmann, widowed Seiferheld und Haspel, with whom he had a daughter.Heinz H√§rtl, Ludwig Achim von Arnim, Briefwechsel III (1805-1806) (2011), p. 660. In 1818, he became rector of the gymnasium at Ulm. He retired in 1826 and moved to Schorndorf. Gr√§ter was among the first scholars to systematically approach old German and Scandinavian philology in the 1780s and 1790s. He published an anthology of Old Norse poetry in 1789 (Nordische Blumen). He was the editor of the journals Bragur and Idunna und Hermode. He bitterly criticized the Romanticist character of the early publications of the Brothers Grimm.

The old station building was renamed the Tai'an Railway Culture Park and is preserved as a historical monument by the Taichung City Government. As of 2018, there are no scheduled passenger services at this station.  History  The station was opened on December 1, 1910 as the Da'an River Signal Station, which served as a signal box. A passenger building opened on July 1, 1912 and renamed to Da'an railway station in 1920. The 1935 Shinchiku-Taich≈´ earthquake destroyed the original wooden station building. In its place, a concrete building was constructed. On March 1, 1954, the station was renamed as Tai'an railway station. When operation of the Former Mountain Line terminated on September 24, 1998, the station also ceased operation. A new station was built further west to accommodate passengers. Tai'an Old station was preserved as a historical monument and all railroad switches in the station were left untouched. However, the overhead power lines as well as the railroad to Houli station were demolished. The station building remained open as a tourist site. Between June 5-9, 2010, to promote tourism, the Former Mountain Line resumed service between Tai'an and Sanyi station, using a steam locomotive numbered CK124. The Taiwan Railways Administration also attempted to renovate the line for operation, but the construction bidding attracted no contractors. Since then, the Miaoli County Government has hosted an additional six events using steam locomotives. Other than that, there are no scheduled passenger services at this station.

The Free-Germany Movement () was a movement of German exiled opponents to the rule of Adolf Hitler during the Second World War. The movement was led by Otto Strasser. Founding The Free-Germany Movement was founded on January 30, 1941 (the 8th anniversary of Hitler's take-over of power in Germany), in part as a continuation of emigre remnants of Strasser's Black Front group.Friedmann, Germ√°n Claus. Nacionalsocialistas anti-hitleristas y cuesti√≥n jud√≠a: Los casos de Die Schwarze Front y Frei-Deutschland Bewegung en la Argentina. Universidad Nacional del Centro de la Provincia de Buenos Aires. Facultad de Ciencias Humanas. Instituto de Estudios Hist√≥rico-Sociales ¬´Prof. Juan Carlos Grosso¬ª; Anuario IEHS; 31; 1; 6-2016; 15-36 Strasser modelled his organization on the 'Free France' of Charles de Gaulle. The group began publishing propaganda material in German, English and Spanish languages. In its first proclamation the Free-Germany Movement called for \\"struggle against Nazism and punishment of the guilty\\" as well as calling for a democratic constitution, federalism and autonomy, peace between democracies and God-fearing policies. Organization Whilst Strasser was living in Canada at the time, the group had most of its followers in Latin America. The organization had two main offices, one in New York City headed by Kurt Singer and one in Buenos Aires headed by Bruno Fricke. Strasser named Fricke as the leader of the Free- Germany Movement in Latin America, a role Fricke had also occupied in the Black Front. Friecke was also named First Vice Chairman of the organization. In Uruguay the landesleiter was Erico Schoemann who was an old Black Front support and who ran the publication Die Zeit/El Tiempo in Montevideo. The Free-Germany Movement also had small units in West Canada, China and South Africa (the latter unit was led by August Pokorski). The Free-Germany Movement was politically broader than Strasser's previous grouping, gathering people with Christian, national-conservative or social democratic backgrounds. For example the landesleiter ('Country Leader') of the Free-Germany Movement in Brazil was Helmut H√ºtter, an Austrian who hailed from a conservative Catholic background. In Bolivia, where the size of the organization was rather marginal, it was led by Hugo Efferoth, a former social democrat. Disintegration Whilst Strasser had built an impressive organization on paper, the organization soon withered apart. He tried to impose himself as the sole authority in the movement, but the organization was far too heterogenerous for such an approach to work. The sole key characteristic of all members of the organization was their anti-communist orientation. In November 1941 Strasser dismissed his landesleiter in Colombia, in 1942 the landesleiters in Venezuela and Chile. By late 1942 the organization was largely defunct. Isolation in emigre community Strasser had also hoped to build unity with other German exiled opposition groups, but found himself politically isolated. For example he sought contact with the Social Democrat Albert Grzesinski in the United States and the Anti-Nazi Freedom Movement in Colombia. The nationalist, clerical, conservative and authoritarian tendencies of Strasser's grouping made collaboration with German leftist and Jewish exiled opposition groups impossible. The organization was frequently attacked in the progressive emigre German press in Latin America. Failed overture to Allies The movement aspired to build a 'Free-German Legion' to join the war on the Allied side.Sozialistische Mitteilungen, Nr. 28 - 1941 The effort was not successful. On the contrary, Strasser was placed in Allied internment camp 1943-1946. On Austrian question Keeping a Greater German nationalist outlook, the Free-German Movement opposed the formation of an exiled Austrian national government. Rather than organizing an 'Austrian' section, Austrian members of the organization joined their respective 'Gaue'. Later period The influence of the Free-Germany Movement dwindled, albeit Die Zeit continued to appear in Montevideo until 1946. As of 1946, the Free-Germany Movement welcomed Nuremberg trials sentences against Hermann G√∂ring and Julius Streicher, but considered the sentencing of Karl D√∂nitz unjust.

Kelly is a Lifetime documentary detailing sexual abuse allegations against American singer Robert \\"R.\\" Kelly (which he has denied). It aired over three nights, from January 3 to January 5, 2019. Filmmaker and music critic Dream Hampton served as executive producer together with Joel Karsberg, Jesse Daniels and Tamra Simmons. Musicians Chance the Rapper, John Legend and Stephanie \\"Sparkle\\" Edwards appeared in the documentary. Its premiere episode on January 3, 2019, was Lifetime's highest-rated program in more than two years, with 1.9 million total viewers. It received critical acclaim, with a 95% positive rating on Rotten Tomatoes. The documentary also spurred several musicians who previously collaborated with Kelly on projects, including Lady Gaga and Ciara, to condemn Kelly and remove their works with him from streaming services. Shortly after the docuseries aired, Kelly's record label dissolved its working relationship with him. In February 2019, Kelly was formally charged with 10 counts of aggravated criminal sexual abuse. On December 11, 2019, it was announced that there would be a second season titled Surviving R. Kelly Part II: The Reckoning, which premiered on January 2, 2020. Episodes =Season 1 (2019)= =Season 2: Part II: The Reckoning (2020)= Production A documentary series focused on R. Kelly's history of alleged sexual abuse was green-lit by Lifetime in May 2018. \\"We've been working for over a year to bring forth the stories of these women,\\" executive producer Joel Karsberg told The Hollywood Reporter. \\"We are proud to team with Lifetime to shed light on these stories as well as an industry that has looked the other way for so many years.\\" Hampton was invited onto the project by an executive at Bunim/Murray Productions. \\"[...] That executive, Jesse Daniels, and Tamara Simmons, another co-EP on this project, have been holding these relationships with some of his survivors for months before I came on board,\\" Hampton said in an interview with NPR. \\"I remember talking to them early on, kind of figuring out if we were going to work together...Having been adjacent in some ways to the music industry, when there was one, I knew that it took dozens, if not hundreds of people, for R. Kelly to operate as long as he has in the way that he has.\\" Hampton said that Simmons would call prospective interviewees late into the night. \\"She was handling and had the relationships with, not just the women and girls who survived R. Kelly, but also the families,\\" Hampton said. \\"We had three families who were trying to get their daughters back. So she in particular, she and Jesse, had been caring for those relationships. And then I came on as showrunner and made it a show.\\" Many musicians who worked with R. Kelly refused to participate in the series. \\"When it comes to celebrities, it was incredibly difficult to get people who had collaborated (artistically) with Kelly to come forward,\\" Hampton said. \\"We asked Lady Gaga. We asked Erykah Badu. We asked Celine Dion. We asked Jay-Z. We asked Dave Chappelle. (They're) people who have been critical of him. That makes John Legend even more of a hero for me.\\" Reception =Critical response= The review aggregator website Rotten Tomatoes reported a 95% approval rating for the first season with an average rating of 8.19/10, based on 21 reviews. The website's critical consensus reads, \\"By unearthing previously suppressed histories, Surviving R. Kelly exposes the dangers of enabling predatory behavior and gives necessary voice to its survivors.\\" Metacritic, which uses a weighted average, assigned a score of 86 out of 100 based on 9 critics, indicating \\"universal acclaim.\\" =Ratings= Season 1 The January 3 premiere episode was Lifetime's highest-rated program in more than two years, with 1.9 million total viewers. Season 2 =Impact= The National Sexual Assault Hotline in the United States, operated by the Rape, Abuse & Incest National Network (RAINN), experienced a 27% increase in calls during the airing of the documentary. Following the documentary, the office of Cook County, Illinois, State's Attorney Kim Foxx said on January 10, 2019, that it had received numerous new calls alleging sexual abuse by R. Kelly and that it was investigating the claims. Lady Gaga also released a statement saying she regretted working with R. Kelly on their 2013 duet \\"Do What U Want\\" and said she was working on removing it from online streaming services. \\"I stand behind these women 1000%, believe them, know they are suffering and in pain, and feel strongly that their voices should be heard and taken seriously\\", she wrote in a statement. \\"I think it's clear how explicitly twisted my thinking was at the time...If I could go back and have a talk with my younger self I'd tell her to go through the therapy I have since then.\\", however the single with Christina Aguilera was kept. Other artists that have previously worked and collaborated with Kelly as well, such as Chance the Rapper, Celine Dion, and Ciara, also took down their songs with him from music streaming services and retailers. Nielsen SoundScan has reported that after the initial airing of the series, Kelly's music saw a two-fold increase in streaming popularity. But, in contrast, after the series aired, many urban contemporary radio stations ‚Äì where R. Kelly was a mainstay ‚Äì in various markets have decided they would no longer play his music. Stations like KKDA-FM and KRNB in Dallas, KJLH in Los Angeles, WBLS in New York City, and WAMJ in Atlanta have made the announcement they will not play R. Kelly anymore, while other radio stations that quietly banned his music did not make a public announcement on their decision. Kelly's record label, RCA Records, dropped him shortly after the docuseries aired. On February 22, 2019, R. Kelly was formally charged with 10 counts of aggravated criminal sexual abuse. On March 6, 2019, in a CBS This Morning interview with Gayle King, R. Kelly broke down crying while strongly denying all allegations and charges made against him. =Awards= Surviving R.

It has a stem long and flattened green photosynthetic roots long, wide and pressed against the substrate. Between five and ten resupinate, pale green, tube-shaped flowers about long and wide open one at a time. The sepals and petals are fleshy with only the tips spreading apart from each other. The labellum is boat-shaped, about long, wide, green and fleshy with a blunt appendage and a spur on its end. Flowering occurs from August to December. Taxonomy and naming Taeniophyllum confertum was first formally described in 1985 by Bruce Gray and David Jones and the description was published in The Orchadian. The specific epithet (confertum) is a Latin word meaning \\"pressed together\\", \\"crowded\\", \\"thick\\" or \\"dense\\".

It can be used as a guideline for divers descending or ascending, for depth control in blue-water diving, and as a guide for transfer of tools and equipment between surface and diver by sliding them along the downline at the end of a messenger line. A shotline is a special case of downline which uses a heavy weight at the bottom and a float at the top. A jackstay is a more lateral equivalent, that commonly follows a surface, and will not usually allow materials transfer without a messenger line from the destination end.  Arrangement and use  There is no definitive arrangement. A downline is a generic piece of support equipment that can be set up using available components and is defined by its function. The top end can be secured to any suitably secure point in an appropriate place. This can be a large float or buoy, the dive boat or diving platform, or other substantial item on the shore. The bottom end can be secured to any suitably secure point at ot near the worksite, such as heavy structure, the actual bottom rock, a large weight or an anchor. Enough tension to keep the catenary suitable for use is needed, and that may not be very much for a near vertical line. A downline used for open ocean diving is much the same as a shotline , but does not reach all the way to the bottom. An open-ocean downline is weighted at the bottom, and attached to a substantial float at the surface, which may be tethered to the boat. It may be marked at intervals by knots or loops, and may be attached to the decompression trapeze system. In some cases a sea anchor may be used to limit wind drift, particularly if attached to a boat with significant windage.  Variations  * The anchor cable is commonly used by divers as a downline for ascent and descent. They may use granny lines from the entry point of the boat to the anchor cable as an aid for divers in currents, or low visibility. A basic granny line has a large, heavy shackle sliding over the anchor cable to tension it, and is tied off at the boarding area, usually at the stern of the boat. Divers entering the water at the stern of the vessel will be down- current of the anchor cable, but can use the granny line to pull themselves to the downline, which takes less effort than swimming up-current. On the return the anchor cable and granny line will guide the diver to the exit ladder or platform. * Shotlines are near-vertical downlines that use a weight at the bottom and a float at the top. Several methods can be used for tension control when needed. * A lazy shot, blue-water downline, or midwater downline, is a weighted line supported by a large float or boat, which does not extend all the way to the bottom, and is used for blue-water diving work, usually by scientific divers on scuba.

It lies on NH15 south of Rewari at about on the Rewari-Bawad road. History Buddha Prakash, a scholar of the Kurukshetra University, states that Bharawas was likely the seat of the historical Bhadanaka kingdom that was conquered by the 12th century Chahamana king Prithviraj Chauhan. According to Buddha Prakash, this kingdom comprised old Gurgaon district, part of Alwar and Bhiwani tahsil.Buddha Prakash, 1967, Glimpses of Haryana, Kurukshetra, page 29-32. However, Cynthia Talbot of University of Wisconsin-Madison identifies Bhadanaka territory as the area around Bayana in Bharatpur; historian Dasharatha Sharma identifies it as the present-day Bhiwani to north, Rewari west and Alwar to southwest. =Maratha era= The Maratha general, Mahadji Scindhia stayed at Rewari in 1787, to regulate the affairs and collect land revenue from here. On Mahadji's departure a rebel mughal courtier of Delhi, Najaf Qui Khan (son of Mirza Najaf Khan), occupied the fort of Gokalgarh, 3 km north of Rewari. Mughal Emperor Shah Alam II marched his army from Delhi to punish the rebellious leader. The Emperor encamped at Bharawas, eight kilometres south of Rewari. He was accompanied by the Begum Samru and her forces from her principal cantonment at Jharsa. On 12 March 1788, Najaf Quli inflicted heavy losses on the Mughals in a night attack. But Begum Samru's artillery proved effective and compelled Njaf Quli to sue for peace.Jadunath Sarkar, 1964, Fall of the Mughal Empire, v6l. III, pp. =British colonial era: Bharawas cantonment= Bharawas district and cantonment: In 1804-05, British created a new district of Bharawas, and in 1805-06, they established a cantonment at Bharawas about 7 km from Rewari. In 1818, Bharawas district was disbanded and its headquarter was relocated to Jharsa in Gurugaon, forming Gurugaon as a new district for the first time. In 1821, Bharawas Cantonment too was abandoned, the civil quarters were relocated to Nasirabad in Ajmer and cavalry to Gurgaon which was named as the Hidayatpur Cantonment. Gurgaon was merely a village till 1818. At Bharawas, there are now remains of two ruinous gun powder magazines and a cemetery with dilapidated smaller tombs, tomb stones and graves.Yashpal Gulia, 2012, Heritage of Haryana.Gurugram plan a misdirected govt move from history to myth, Times of India. In the aftermath of Indian Rebellion of 1857, a temporary garrison was also setup near Rewari after Rao Tula Ram and his cousin Rao Gopal Dev forces were defeated.SDS Yadava, 2006, Followers of Krishna, Lancer Publishers, page 49-55. It now lies in ruins. After the annexation of Gurugram in 1803, the headquarters of civil offices of the district were at Bharawas near Rewari. Gurgaon was then a cavalry station to check the troops of Begum Samru of Jharsa. After the cession of the Ajmer territory the British frontier moved from Haryana to southern Rajasthan, the Bharawas force was transferred to Nasirabad near Ajmer and civil offices were shifted to Gurugram which was made a new district headquarter in 1821.Gurugram history .Haryana gazateer VOl I, Chapter 5.

He was the first Indian Navy Officer to be awarded the Maha Vir Chakra (MVC) in 1972 for his actions of bravery and gallantry in the Indo- Pakistani War of 1971. He was also the first Indian Navy officer to be granted the MVC, which is the country‚Äôs second highest gallantry award, and given for acts of gallantry in the face of enemy, whether on land, at sea or in the air.

Life Lower was born in Cornwall about 1610, the only son of John Lower of Tremere and his first wife Jane. He did not attend Oxford or Cambridge University, but \\"spent some time in Oxon in the condition of an Hospes, for the sake of the public Library and Scholastic Company\\", as his cousin Richard Lower, a physician, informed Anthony Wood. \\"... he troubled himself not with the crabb'd studies of Logic and Philosophy\\", travelled in France, and became a \\"perfect master of the French tongue\\". In 1639 he published The Phoenix in her Flames: a Tragedy, dedicated to his cousin William Lower. John Genest, in Some Account of the English Stage (volume 10, page 69), gives an abstract of the plot, which he describes as \\"romantic, but interesting\\". =The civil war= Lower was a lieutenant in Sir Jacob Ashley's regiment in the King's army, and was promoted captain, but lost his company, which proved mutinous and deserted. In June 1644, being then lieutenant-governor of Wallingford, he received orders from the King to raise ¬£50 a week from the town of Reading for the garrison at Wallingford. Lower took the mayor to Wallingford as a hostage; he then plied the corporation with diplomatic letters, which failed, however, to extract from them more than a fraction of the sum required. His zeal was subsequently rewarded by a knighthood, conferred upon him probably on 27 March 1645. On 19 January 1646 he was taken prisoner by the parliamentary garrison of Abingdon and taken to London; he was released on 11 January 1647. =In Cologne and Holland= He is thought to have remained in England until 1655, when he visited Cologne, and cheered the royalists there with the assurance that Cromwell could not live long. Leaving Cologne after a short residence, he seems to have held some post in the household of the Princess Royal of Orange at the Hague, and occupied his time in translating French plays. In 1658 he published at the Hague another original play, The Enchanted Lovers: a Pastoral. In 1660, during the negotiations between Charles II and the English parliament, Lower prepared his sumptuous \\"Relation in the form of a Journal of the Voiage and Residence which the most mighty and excellent Prince Charles II ‚Ä¶ hath made in Holland from 25 May to 2 June 1660, rendered into English out of the Original French.\\" The work, a thin royal folio, was issued in September (in Dutch and French, as well as English), by Adrian Ulack of the Hague. The plates contain some two hundred portraits, both foreign and English. =Return to England= In June 1660 Lower wrote to Edward Nicholas, Secretary of State to Charles II, from the Hague, asking for a place in the King's service. The death of his cousin Thomas Lower, by which he became sole heir, executor, and chief representative of the family, recalled him to England in 1661. He died early in the following year, his will being proved on 7 May 1662. His wife, of whom nothing is known, predeceased him; he left most of his estate to his daughter Elizabeth, held in trust until the age of 21. Lower was buried, Anthony Wood believed, in the church of St Clement Danes in Westminster, though there is no record of his interment either there or at St Winnow or at Landulph, where his inherited estate was situate. Works Thomas Seccombe, in the Dictionary of National Biography, wrote, \\"Though there are a few good lines in The Phoenix, most of Lower's verse is very commonplace, and his translations, without being even laborious, are dull.\\" Richard Lower described him to Anthony Wood as \\"an ill poet, and a worse man.\\" His works are: * The play The Phoenix in her Flames (1639), a tragic romance set in Arabia * The play The Enchanted Lovers (1658), a pastoral set on the island of Erithrea * Translations of plays by Pierre Corneille: Polyeuctes (1655) and Horatius (1656) * Translations of works about religious martyrs, by Ren√© de Ceriziers: The Innocent Lady (1654), The Innocent Lord (1655) and The Triumphant Lady (1656) * Translations of plays by Philippe Quinault: The Noble Ingratitude (La G√©n√©reuse Ingratitude) (1659), dedicated to the Princess Royal of Orange, and The Amorous Fantasme (Le Fant√¥me Amoureux) (1660), dedicated to Elizabeth Stuart, Queen of Bohemia References Attribution * External links * Category:1610 births Category:1662 deaths Category:People from Cornwall Category:17th-century English dramatists and playwrights Category:17th-century translators Category:Military personnel of the English Civil War ","title":"William Lower (dramatist)"},{"id":"59589219","text":"Mirwan Kassouf (born 12 November 1964) is a Lebanese boxer.

Early life and education  Andr√©e was born in 1934 in Li√®ge, Belgium, the daughter of the physicist Yvonne Rosenfeld and the physicist L√©on Rosenfeld. After the Second World War the Rosenfeld family moved to Manchester. She studied for a BSc in Physics at Bristol University in 1956, where she took up caving. Andr√©e studied for a Master of Science and then obtained a PhD in 1960 from the Institute of Archaeology, with a thesis on the sedimentology of caves from sites in Devon supervised by Frederick Zeuner. During her postgraduate research she excavated the palaeolithic cave sites in Devon, Torbryan and Three Holes Cave.  Career  After completing her PhD research she worked at the Institute of Archaeology as Zeuner's research assistant. Her first book, The Inorganic Raw Materials of Antiquity, built upon the technical skills learnt in this period. Rosenfeld was appointed as a curator of Palaeolithic collections at the British Museum in 1964, where she was based until 1972, and guest-lectured at the Department of Anthropology, UCL. During the 1960s she worked at Arcy-sur-Cur√© alongside Leroi-Gourhan. She was considered as a European expert in archaeological science and provided advice on microscopic study of use-wear. She undertook research on the Magdalenian artefacts within the British Museum's collections. In 1972 she moved to Australia, with her partner Peter Ucko, where she taught at the recently established Department of Archaeology and Anthropology at the Australian National University (ANU) from 1973. During her time at ANU, Rosenfeld commenced several crucial projects for the development of Australian archaeology, where she applied her previous scientific training and research experiences. Her excavations at the Early Man Site in Cape York Peninsula, Queensland provided the first evidence that rock art in Australia was Pleistocene in date, and made the methodological development of linking excavated evidence with rock art, described as a \\"milestone in the establishment of rock art research in Australia\\". Her 1985 book, commissioned by the Australian Heritage Commission, was the founding study of rock art conservation in Australia. Rosenfeld's scholarship focused on both methodological and theoretical interpretations of rock art, and research in the late 1990s focused on the social context of rock art. Her teaching career at ANU included establishing courses in the archaeology of art and material culture, and she is noted for incorporating ethnography into the study of art. During her career she held visiting fellowships at the Getty Research Institute in Los Angeles in 1988, and Oxford University in 1989. She retired from her position as Reader at ANU in 1997, and moved to Rathdowney in Queensland where she enjoyed an active retirement. She died from pancreatic cancer in 2008. = Legacy = Her major contribution in archaeology was in the field of rock art research, and the application of scientific techniques to the study of art. Rosenfeld was described as a ‚Äúrigorous and generous scholar, and a lovely, gentle person‚Äù and ‚Äúan enthusiastic and accomplished teacher‚Äù. She taught a number of students who became leading archaeologists, such as Jo McDonald, Paul Tacon, Howard Morphy, Robert Layton, and Claire Smith. Through her supervision of postgraduate students, a flourishing of rock art research took place in Australia in the late 1980s and 1990s.  Honours and awards  The Andr√©e Rosenfeld Chair of Rock Art was established at ANU in recognition of her service to the university. A portrait of Andr√©e by Robin Wallace-Crabbe and Diane Fogwell is in the collection of the National Portrait Gallery. Rosenfeld was elected as a Fellow of the Australian Academy of the Humanities.

McAuliffe also worked with Patrick Moraz while he was a member of the rock band Yes, singing on his first two solo albums. She also worked with Gerry Rafferty on his number one album City to City. History In 1968 McAuliffe was a founder member of a loosely-based artistic co- operative called the Principal Edwards Magic Theatre at Exeter University. They were one of the first groups signed up with BBC Radio 1 disc jockey John Peel on his record label Dandelion Records. McAuliffe was the lead vocalist of the band. They used theatre as part of their act, however tensions between theatre and rock group developed which led eventually to the break-up of the group in December 1971. The Principal Edwards Magic Theatre produced two albums while McAuliffe was still a member; Soundtrack in 1969 and The Asmoto Running Band in 1971, both on the Dandelion label. After leaving the Principal Edwards Magic Theatre, McAuliffe joined Affinity. They had first met McAuliffe at Exeter University while they were playing one of their last gigs with their original line-up. They had material for a whole new set and club dates soon followed. However, they never released a studio album, and it wasn't until 2003 that 1971‚Äì1972 was released after the band had split up in 1972. Three members of Affinity‚ÄîMo Foster (bass guitar), Mike Jopp (guitar), and Grant Serpell (drums)‚Äîwent off to tour with Mike d'Abo (former member of Manfred Mann), and subsequently the band split up. McAuliffe went onto sing with various bands around London. She also sang on many records, with artists such as Gerry Rafferty on his album City to City, Patrick Moraz's The Story of I and Out in the Sun and ex-members of Genesis, including Phil Collins and Anthony Phillips on The Geese & the Ghost. In later life McAuliffe worked with the fashion designer John Galliano, and eventually became a senior lecturer at the London College of Fashion.

Although planned for construction in the 18th Century, work did not start until 1837 and it was completed in 1842. History Following the 1755 earthquake that affected much of Portugal the Marquis of Pombal, who was placed in charge of reconstruction, created an organized Lighthouse Service in 1758 and ordered six lighthouses to be built. The Berlenga lighthouse was intended to be one of these but, unlike the other five, it was not built. Only in December 1836 did the Portuguese Ministry of Finance commission an engineer, Gaud√™ncio Fontana, to construct a lighthouse on the island. The equipment consisted of a catoptric device, with sixteen oil-fired Argand lamps with parabolic reflectors, giving off a white light with ten-second flashes. The rotation movement was activated by a clockwork mechanism. The long duration of the infrequent flashes led to it being criticized for poorly serving navigation as it could be easily confused with other lights. In 1896, while a new optical device was being fitted, two interim beacons were used. The new device, supplied by the French company of Barbier, Benard, et Turenne, began to function definitively on November 6, 1897, making one complete rotation in 30 seconds, with a group of three flashes in this time. The light source was derived from petroleum vapor until 1926, when generators were introduced, allowing a light bulb to be used, with a range of 36 nautical miles. One of the two Fresnel lens used is now on display at a museum operated near Lisbon by the Lighthouse Directorate, which is a branch of the Portuguese Navy, and the other is at the Santa Marta Lighthouse museum in Cascais. The lighthouse was automated in 1985 and the existing light was replaced by a Pharos Marine PRB-21 sealed beam optic. The lighthouse and staff residences started to use solar energy from 2000. The PRB 21 was removed and a modern high-performance rotary headlamp was introduced, with an estimated range of 20 nautical miles. A new foghorn was also introduced. In 2001 the Lighthouse Directorate was awarded the National Defense and Environment Prize, which aims to encourage good environmental practices in the Portuguese Armed Forces, for the use of solar energy at the Berlenga Lighthouse. In 2009 the TRB-400 was replaced by two LED optics. The tower is quadrangular, 29 metres high, constructed of masonry and painted white. It has a balcony at the top. The light has an altitude of 121 metres. Although it is automated, lighthousekeepers still live on-site but, since 1975, their families have been accommodated at the mainland Cape Carvoeiro lighthouse in Peniche.

In five hour-long film documentaries, directed by David Pearson for the BBC, her story attracted an audience of nearly nine million viewers for the first episode, George and Julia, in 1979. The series was transmitted on BBC2 as A Change of Sex, and described by Pearson as \\"intimate, frank and observational\\". Episodes were broadcast from that year until 1999, charting new stages in her life.  Early life  Born in Blackpool, Lancashire, she was the eldest child of Phillip Roberts, a trawlerman, and his wife, Jessica, and brought up in nearby Fleetwood. Jessica was an alcoholic, and attempted suicide several times, whilst Phillip was a violent drunkard who tried to rape Julia when she was a child. As one of eight children, Julia often cared for her younger brothers and sisters. She also spent periods in a children's home in Preston, and as a teenager, prostituted herself to men. This was said to be \\"a misguided cry\\" for the affection that she did not get from her parents, and she used the money for sweets.  Television fame and gender reassignment  In 1974, after a failed marriage, she moved to London, and in 1978, when the BBC began filming, she was a catering manager who performed as a drag queen. However, it became apparent that drag did not feel right to her, and the BBC filmed her last programme. Julia had realized that she was not a male homosexual, and wanted to live as her true self. As a precondition for receiving treatment at the Charing Cross Hospital unit ‚Äì at the time, the main clinic in the UK dealing with transgender patients ‚Äì Julia began living, working and dressing as a woman. She asked the BBC series director Pearson for name suggestions, and from this list, chose Julia Grant. The NHS psychiatrist who ran the clinic was persuaded to let the BBC film all of his consultations with Julia, although with the stipulation that he would not be named on air, or be seen on screen. According to Pearson, \\"his voice suggested a plummy sense of entitled authority, tinged with arrogance, often expressing stereotypical attitudes towards women, even by 70s standards.\\" The psychiatrist was later revealed to be a man called John Randell. The week before the first programme in the series was shown, Sunday tabloids published hostile stories about Julia and the films. Despite this, she was determined to become the \\"woman I want to be\\". It was this, says Pearson, coupled with her \\"gritty humour while overcoming her setbacks\\" ‚Äì such as the way she was treated by Randell ‚Äì which \\"convinced many TV viewers that her cause was legitimate\\", and the BBC received a large amount of letters in support of Julia and the films. Grant was living with Amir, a refugee who had fled from persecution in Iraq, who accepted her as a woman. As they wished to progress their relationship, the operations would not wait. In a series of \\"combative encounters\\", Randell was dismissive of Julia's goals, as he did not believe her to be ladylike enough, and thought her too \\"pushy\\". Grant ignored Randell's advice, and found a way to get breast implants at a private clinic. Randell was \\"furious\\" and Grant realised that he would not support her ambition for full genital surgery. A private surgeon, Michael Royle, and his colleague, was sympathetic to Grant's problem, and agreed to operate. When Grant woke up after the operation, she was \\"in great pain but ecstatic\\". It seemed to have been a success, but Grant needed time to recover, and filming was put on hold for several years. She later told the programme makers that, several weeks after the surgery, she had collapsed bleeding and been taken to hospital unconscious, where she was treated for a suspected miscarriage by doctors who were not aware of her medical history. Her surgery was damaged, and she was unable to have sex; she was embarrassed to get help or to confide in Amir about the reason they could not have sex, and their relationship worsened. The couple split up, and he left the UK. Grant thought that she would not be able to receive any further treatment, in a period described by Pearson as \\"perhaps the lowest point of her life\\".  Subsequent life  Grant wrote two books about her experiences, George & Julia (1980) and Just Julia (1994). In the late 1990s, the final BBC film caught up with Grant living in Manchester and running the busy Hollywood Show Bar. She wanted to marry her new partner, Alan Sunderland, and her former surgeon Royle said that he could resolve her surgical problem. However, Grant, together with Sunderland, decided that she would not proceed with more surgery, and could instead \\"be happy as they were\\". The couple had a church blessing, and Grant thought of herself as married. She owned a number of cafes and bars in Manchester's Canal Street Gay Village, fought against redevelopment plans for the area, and was active in establishing local LGBTQ events. Grant and her partner moved to France's Creuse region, where she built up a ceramics business, and locals called her \\"La Madame Anglaise\\". However, one morning, Sunderland ate breakfast and departed from Grant's life for good. She went to live in Spain, where she ran a hotel in Benidorm and began Benidorm Gay Pride. Grant told people wanting gender reassignment that changing sex \\"would not solve all their problems\\", and some members of the trans community found her views controversial: for example, that children should not be allowed to have gender reassignment surgery. She spent time in America counselling young people who were thinking about it.  Illness  After being diagnosed with bowel cancer, Grant returned to the UK in 2015, and committed herself to helping other trans people. She encouraged improved trans care services, and took part in discussions at the NHS's Nye Bevan Academy, a facility which trains health service leaders.  Death  Grant survived bowel cancer, but suffered from multiple health problems, and died on 2 January 2019 following a short illness. She was survived by her sisters, Shirley, Jeanne, Lesley, Julie and Beverley, her brothers, Gary and Danny, and an aunt, Mary.

He was known for his Beatle haircut and knack for humorous one-liners. Life and career Originally Van Broeckhoven was a civil servant. He presented the music shows Njam Njam and Hitbox on Radio 2, where Etienne Smet made the musical selections. Van Broeckhoven was known for his playful style, coming up with humorous one-liners and puns in between musical segments. Many of these quotes and one-liners were later compiled in various books. Van Broeckhoven was once temporarily suspended from airplay because he had played an anti-religious song by Robert Long on the air. Another time he made a joke about Roy Orbison, claiming that \\"his glasses might benefit from a premium for insulated glazing\\". The president of the Belgian Roy Orbison fanclub sent him a message that he and the club members would come to the radio station to protest. When they indeed turned up Van Broeckhoven waited until the evening fell before he snuck away. At the end of the 1980s Van Broeckhoven presented similar music-themed shows at radio channel Magdalena. When the commercial radio station Radio Donna went in the air in 1992 Van Broeckhoven worked together with Michel Follet and Erik Strieleman. He presented the show Nogal Wiedes for many years. During the last years of his life, Van Broeckhoven was very ill, bedridden, and he no longer appeared in public. He died at the age of 69.

The King of Spain receives the Prime Minister, the Minister of Defence, the Chief of the Defence Staff, the Chiefs of Staff of all branches, the Grand Masters of the Royal and Military Orders of San Fernando and San Hermenegildo, the Civil Guard chiefs and the Spanish Veterans Brotherhood. The holiday begins with the review of the troops (composed mainly by the Royal Guard) by the Monarch in the courtyard of the Royal Palace after being saluted by the Prime Minister and the Chiefs of Staff. After this, they go to the Throne Room of the Royal Palace where the Monarch rewards some military officers. During this day, both the Monarch and the Defence Minister hold speeches to the Government, the highest officers of the Armed Forces and other authorities. These speeches usually reflect the Spanish political and geostrategic situation. Along with Madrid, the holiday is celebrated in the rest of the country in the different military headquarters. Origin King Charles III established this ceremony on the occasion of the capture of Menorca to the British, carried out by a Franco-Spanish army of 52 ships in 1782 and the Spanish Navy Marines. As an expression of joy, Charles III ordered the Viceroys, Captain Generals, Governors and Military commanders to gather the garrisons at the feast of the Epiphany and to notify their commanders and officers of the armies of their congratulations on their behalf. The Military Easter has gone from being a historical memory to a solemn and important military act with which the military year begins, a balance is made of the previous year and the lines of action to be developed are marked in which it begins. Criticism The Chief of the Defence Staff between 2008 and 2012 in Spain, Julio Rodr√≠guez, is of the opinion that this event could be an opportunity to open up the Spanish Armies to the public, instead of keeping a ceremony closed just for the military. Professional associations of armed forces (the nearest to an union for the Spanish military) and the Military Life Observatory (Observatorio para la Vida Militar) should take part on it, according to Rodr√≠guez.

In May 2019 she was elected to the European Parliament. She served as mayor of Cascina from June 2016 to June 2019.  Family and early life  The family of her father (Roberto) originated from the hamlet of Vaglie in the comune of Ligonchio and she is a distant cousin through her paternal grandfather of the singer Iva Zanicchi. Francesco Ceccardi, brother of her paternal grandfather, died in the hamlet of Busana on the Apennine Mountains, killed by the army of the Italian Social Republic in January 1945 and is locally honored by a way- side cross with a plaque.. Her family was left-wing but her parents moved their vote to the Northern League in the 1990s. She graduated at classical high school and she later enrolled at Law School at the University of Pisa, where she began her political activity as student representative. She took all the exams but never graduated.  Political career  =Cascina= She was elected at the municipal council of Cascina in 2011 and she participated as a regular guest in the political talk show Announo on the national channel LA7. In 2015 she was a candidate at the Tuscan regional election but did not get a council seat. In 2016 she obtained at the Cascina mayoral election 28.4% in the first round and 50.3% in the run-off, while her party got 21.3%. Immigration was a core topic of the campaign. At the time her victory interrupted 70 years of leftwing local leadership and Cascina became the first large municipality won by Lega Nord Toscana in the region and the second in general after Bagni di Lucca in the 1990s. in a region which is a traditional left stronghold. She was also the only member of Lega Nord elected mayor in the whole region before Siena, Pisa and Massa followed suit in the June 2018 local elections. The result was not considered local and was seen as a key example of the political shift fuelled by the topic of immigration which later occurred at the national general election in 2018. =Role in Tuscany = Susanna Ceccardi's role was considered crucial for the elections in the local constitutencies of her assessors Edoardo Ziello and Rosellina Sbrana in March 2018 to the Italian Chamber of Deputies and the Senate, respectively, and for the victory of the right-wing candidate Michele Conti at the mayoral election in the bigger neighboring comune of Pisa few months later.

The tourists were visited by Gambaccini before the start of the travel, and equipped with protective masks. Ceccardi stated she undertook the initiative after not receiving specific reply from the Italian authorities. The Italian Minister of Foreign Affairs Luigi Di Maio later asked the rescue mission to be stopped when the bus was already in France. The initiative was criticized by the left parties as unnecessary, but also by other local politicians of Fratelli d'Italia. =2020 Tuscan regional elections= Eugenio Giani with Susanna Ceccardi (top candidates for the upcoming regional elections) at the July 2020 electoral debate in the main building of La Nazione in Florence. After the good performance of the possible allied parties at the 2019 European elections, Ceccardi declared herself as a possible candidate for the president of Tuscany at the incoming regional elections of 2020. However, possible allies criticized the weak performance of the center-right coalition at the runoff votings of the 2019 municipal elections under her strategical leadership and criticisms of her activism emerged also inside her own party. In March 2020 Ceccardi was proposed as candidate for the center-right coalition to the 2020 Tuscan regional election. The candidature was formalized for the whole center-right coalition in June 2020, when the date of the election was confirmed after the COVID-19 lockdown.  Political views She has been described as an example of younger Italian politicians supporting a more critical view of the European Union especially compared with the older right-wing officeholders of the previous decades. In 2016 she gave honorary citizenship to Magdi Cristiano Allam, a former Muslim who converted to Christianity and is noted for his criticism of Islamic extremism. She opposes the construction of mosques and, in exchange for the celebration of the Eid al-Fitr in a public space by the local Senegalese community, she required that they \\"firmly condemned\\" all acts of violence induced by Islamic fundamentalism.

He confessed to around 12 murders, earning the nicknames \\"The Chihuahua Ripper\\" and \\"The Urban Development Ripper\\". He can be classified as an organized, sedentary and hedonistic murderer motivated by sexual compulsion. He was sentenced to 120 years imprisonment in 2017.  Modus operandi  Castillo, who was a narcomenudist, attracted his victims (young men who used methamphetamines) with the promise of giving them drugs, driving them to secluded places on the outskirts of town or their own home, where he would drug and intoxicate them. Afterwards, he would hit them on the head with a blunt object to first incapacitate and rape them, before hitting them on the head to kill them. The bodies would then always be dismembered with a coping saw. Castillo would then transport the remains in a wheelbarrow to abandon them in vacant places, where he would either hide them partially or bury them completely. It is known that at least one of his victims had been buried under the floor of his house. Additionally, he would always leave toys next to the mutilated bodies as a \\"signature\\".  Confirmed victims  = Murder of Lorenzo Ernesto Olivas Barrios = Castillo's first identified victim was Lorenzo Ernesto Olivas Barrios, a 22-year-old man from Delicias, who had moved months before his death to the city of Chihuahua to work in a food company. He lived with relatives in Colonia Vista Hermosa before disappearing on November 13, 2015, saying to a relative that he would go buy \\"some dinner\\", but never returning. Three days later, on November 16, his relatives reported his disappearance; they would not hear any news about him until the following day, when the dismembered remains of a man were found by some neighbors of the Urban Development Company. The arms and legs were found inside an abandoned house on Novena and San Abel Streets. Two days later the torso and head were found on a street next to the house, on the streets Once y √Ålamos, partially hidden inside a tree trunk at the bottom of a dry stream, and above the remains a front half of a tricycle was found. DNA tests confirmed the victim's identity. According to subsequent inquiries, it was determined that on the night of November 13, Olivas would have gone to a bar called \\"California\\" on Nueva Espa√±a Street and R. Alameda, where he met with Castillo. He accompanied him to his home on Ninth Street in the same neighborhood, where after consuming methamphetamines, Andr√©s assaulted, raped and murdered him, hitting his head with a hammer until the skull was destroyed. After dismembering the body in the bathroom, he then coerced with threats of killing a teenager to help him transport the remains. Both then returned to his home on Ninth Street, where they cleaned and painted the walls stained with blood. Castillo later raped the young man. = Murder of Daniel Alfonso Rodr√≠guez Morales = On December 13, 2015, more dismembered remains from another man were found, in exactly the same stream, very close to where the first ones were found. The body had only had its legs cut at the knees that were wrapped in a blanket, with the rest of the body also being partially hidden in the trunk, the skull smashed with blows to the head, but there were also two wounds by a .22 caliber firearm. Near the body, the rear half of the same tricycle used in the first case was also found. All the similarities between the two findings, that of Lorenzo Olivas' remains and this new discovery, made it clear that they had been killed by the same person. The victim was identified as Daniel Alfonso Rodr√≠guez Morales, nicknamed \\"El Troya\\", 22 years old, who lived in the same Urban Development neighborhood, and had been seen alive for the last time on the same day on the discovery of his remains. Two years earlier, the victim had been arrested for trying to break into a car. According to the reconstruction of the events after the murder of Lorenzo Olivas, the murderer moved with deceit to the house of a friend located on √Ålamos Street in the Urban Development neighborhood, continuing to harass the teenager whom he forced to help him and made him move into his house on December 13. Castillo then invited his new victim to a friend's house, drugging him in front of the host and the teenager, and proceeding to hit him on the head with a rock to kill him. He forced the two witnesses under the threat of death to help him get rid of the body. = Murder of Fernando Valles Gandarilla = The last confirmed victim was Fernando Valles, who disappeared on the same day that Daniel Rodr√≠guez was murdered and his mutilated body found, Fernando was the brother of a \\"friend\\" of Andr√©s Castillo, Jes√∫s Valles Gandarilla, who was the main caretaker of the latter, who had lost both of his legs in an accident. Jes√∫s would declare that he knew that his brother had visited Andr√©s before disappearing, but he told him that his brother had left the house and did not know where he went. Jes√∫s believed Castillo, thinking that his brother had simply \\"abandoned\\" him. The truth was that Andr√©s drugged, raped and beat him in the same house where he had killed Daniel Rodr√≠guez. The body on Fernando Valles was found on December 18, 2015, under the floor of Andr√©s' room, whom had made a pit to place the body and covered it with rocks and cement. The face and entire skull were destroyed.  Possible victims  Upon his arrest, Andr√©s Castillo confessed to killing 12 people, but according to the prosecution of Chihuahua, he might be involved in about 20 murders. Some of the victims attributed to the killer are: * Jos√© Ur√≠as Hern√°ndez: beaten to death, his body was found next to a warehouse on Calle Industrial Sur N#1, on the Robinson Industrial Complex. * Miguel √Ångel Castillo Quintana: 21-year-old man, murdered on August 7, 2015; his killer had hit him on the head to kill him, and he was found on the day of his death in the Ferro-construction warehouse building on Nueva Spain Avenue. He was face down, naked from the waist down. * Gabriel Garc√≠a Hern√°ndez: his dismembered body was found on August 3, 2015, beaten to death. * Guillermo Ju√°rez Portillo: his mutilated body was found in the Robinson Industrial Complex on May 8, 2015, beaten to death. * \\"John Doe\\": the dismembered body of an unidentified man was found under a bridge on Pacheco Avenue, on November 29, 2014. * \\"John Doe\\": the dismembered body of an unidentified man was found on the railway tracks in the interjection with Pacheco Avenue, on August 2, 2014. * Gustavo Adri√°n Salda√±a Hern√°ndez: his dismembered body was found on Cesar Sandino Street and Francisco Villa Colony on April 3, 2012. * Jos√© Manuel Chavira Olivas: his dismembered body was found on R. Almada and Perif√©rico Neandertal Street, on October 2, 2009.  Psychiatric profile  Image of a toy tricycle; Andr√©s Castillo left next to the bodies of his penultimate and antepenultimate victims half of a toy tricycle Andr√©s Castillo was characterized by profilers as a psychopath and a classic sexual sadist. It is known that Castillo was the victim of repeated sexual abuse during his childhood, and in the opinion Nicol√°s Gonz√°lez, the fact that all his victims were male and the way in which he committed the murders is a sign of the \\"emotional charge\\" of the abuses performed on him. According to the hypothesis of the criminal profilers, Andr√©s would've relieved the sexual abuses he experienced by switching roles, where he was no longer the helpless victim but the perpetrator with absolute power. Within the modus operandi of the \\"Chihuahua Ripper\\", it highlights his obsessive behaviors as the fact that he used the same coping saw in each of the homicides and especially the ritualistic behavior of leaving toys next to the bodies, according to a hypothesis of the specialists of the prosecutor's office these toys represented \\"the gifts that he could've received as a child\\", apparently projecting himself as he was a child to his victims, culturally with the toys being a common ofrenda for a dead child.  Detention and conviction  Andr√©s Castillo was arrested on January 6, 2016 in Vista Cerro Grande colony, as he was in possession of several doses of methamphetamine. He emphasizes the fact that in the last of his crimes he would have been very careless in contrast to the previous murders, where he conducted himself in a methodical way that he left no evidence, believing that he would never be captured. On December 5, 2017, he was sentenced to 120 years imprisonment.  External links  * View of √Ålamo Street, Urban Development Colony, in Chihuahua City, Chihuahua.

Jahrhundert. Edition by Paul List, Leipzig 1903, . better known by his pseudonym Henrion Poly, (13 December 1834 ‚Äì 1 May 1875) was an Austrian writer and actor.  Life  Born in Vienna, the son of the painter Lorenz Kohl von Kohlenegg, he was to pursue a military career, but could assert himself in the family and was allowed to go to the theatre. In 1848 he made his debut as an actor at a theater in Vienna, according to the √ñBL. According to Eisenberg, however, he was first an officer in Austrian service, who left the army unit after the Peace of Villafranca and then went to Paris and later to Hamburg in order to make his debut under the pseudonym Henrion after a short period of preparation. In 1860, at the age of 26, he got an engagement at the Thaliatheater in Hamburg, and in 1861 he went for one year to the Hoftheater in Stuttgart. In 1862 he entered the city theater in Mainz not only as an actor but also as a theatre director. From 1867, Kohlenegg made many tours, among others to Frankfurt, Prague, Vienna and K√∂nigsberg. On these tours his first own plays could already be played successfully. In his hometown Vienna, to which Kohl von Kohlenegg liked to return again and again, he was mainly active as a writer. He often used the pseudonym Henrion Poly.In Eisenberg's encyclopedia, Henrion Poly is printed in bold, so it can be assumed that Henrion Poly is a two-part surname pseudonym and Poly is not a first name. When looking at Eisenberg's side, this immediately catches the eye: the actors in front are Henneberg A n n a and Hennig A d o l f and the actors behind are Hensel' H e i n r i c h and Hensel W i l h e l m. This spelling is valid for the entire encyclopedia. For a short time he was editor of the Dresdener Presse in 1872, and from 1873 also its editor. Kohl von Kohlenegg is the father of Viktor von Kohlenegg. On May 1, 1875 Kohl von Kohlenegg died in Saalfeld (Thuringia).

Concertmaster and conductor at La Scala for 23 years, his musical production consisted mainly of ballets represented in Milan and in other major theatres.  Life  Biographical information on Baillou is fragmentary. Born in Milan from Francesco Baillou, he probably studied violin under the guidance of Nicolas Capron in Paris. From 1762 he lived in Stuttgart, where he worked in the court orchestra of the Duke of W√ºrttemberg, of which he became concertmaster in 1771. Dismissed in 1774, he moved to Milan, where he dwelled till his death. Most of his compositive output dates after his return to Italy, and only a handful compositions of doubtful attribution date back to his permanence in Germany. His main genre was ballet, nevertheless it is hard to formulate a judgment on the quality of his production, since most of his music did not survive and few critic judgments from his era are known. Between 1775 and 1777 he wrote six ballets, and in 1778 two ballets for the Teatro Comunale in Florence and one opera for Stuttgart. In 1779 he became concertmaster and director at Teatro alla Scala, position he maintained for 23 years. Between 1783 and 1788 he wrote seven ballets for La Scala, and in the same period he was also concertmaster at the Pio Istituto de' Professori di Musica. In 1797, under the French occupation, he wrote a ballet of republican inspiration. In 1802 he was arbiter in a controversy between the theatre management and the orchestra. In 1803 he left his position at La Scala, where he was replaced by Alessandro Rolla. Baillou died in Milan in 1804 and was buried in Cimitero di San Gregorio, demolished in the end of XIX century. His last ballet, La disfatta di Abderamo, was premiered posthumous in 1809. Several of his children and grandchildren became musicians and worked at La Scala. Apart from ballets, Baillou wrote five symphonies and an orchestral ouverture of fairly simple style, a duo and five trios for violins of elementary difficulty, most likely intended as didactic material, and two didactic books on arpeggios and solf√®ge.

In past some biographers wrongly placed his birth in Paris. The discovery of his baptismal certificate in the Cathedral of Milan, however, locates the event in the Italian city.

Arrest  On September 16, 2015, Linda Doms was murdered in Zemst, Flemish Brabant. Her corpse was discovered a few days later by a neighbor. Several people were interviewed, including Hardy, a former friend of Doms. Initially, the investigators had no evidence of Hardy's involvement and he was released. When the investigators found images on Hardy's memory card showing the crime scene, Hardy was rearrested on September 21, 2015. During the arrest, the Mechelen court again opened an investigation into older files. From DNA traces a link was established to the murder of 82-year-old Marie Walschaerts, which was committed in Leest in May 2014, and an attempted murder in September 2014 in Bonheiden. He is also the suspected perpetrator of an attack on Belgian actress Veerle Eyckermans in February 2015, who at the time lived near Hardy. He is also considered responsible for the murder of an 85-year-old in Boortmeerbeek in December 2011. Hardy had been arraigned a week before Doms' murder, with the help of sex offender Doris Corbeel, because in 2014 he had shot a passer-by with an air gun. In his own words, he saw the woman riding on the bike and suddenly had the urge to harm her.  Parkinson's  In 2007, doctors diagnosed Hardy with Parkinson's disease. The disease and its influence on his actions received much attention during his trial, with some Belgian media even calling him the \\"Parkinson's murderer\\". It was also mentioned that he took medicine to treat the disease, where a well-known neurologist, Chris Van Der Linden, stated that he had become a murderer due to the addicting medication. Also during the trial, Hardy's defense often cited the disease as a mitigating factor.  Condemnation  The trial began on February 9, 2018. After almost a month, on March 8, 2018, Hardy was declared guilty by the people's jury.Volksjury verklaart Renaud Hardy over volledige lijn schuldig: ‚ÄúHij handelde weloverwogen en gepland‚Äù, hln.be, 7 maart 2018 He was sentenced to life imprisonment.

Club career Daiane began her formal football training at Clube de Regatas do Flamengo's soccer school in Uberl√¢ndia. At 16 years old she had a successful trial with Associa√ß√£o Desportiva Centro Ol√≠mpico, but was unable to raise enough funds to relocate to S√£o Paulo and take up her place. Instead she tried out with Kindermann's under-17 team, where she impressed enough to be brought straight into the adult first team. During 2014 Daiane played futsal for Associa√ß√£o Desportiva 3R's under-17 team and for Joinville at the Joguinhos Abertos de Santa Catarina (). In 2015 she played football for both XV de Piracicaba and Tiradentes, before spending 2016 with Rio Preto. At XV de Piracicaba she was switched from playing on the wing to central defence. She proved a revelation in her new position and was soon attracting notice from scouts. In her season at Rio Preto the team won the Campeonato Paulista and were runners-up in the Campeonato Brasileiro. She agreed a transfer to Norwegian Toppserien club Avaldsnes for their 2017 season, which culminated in them winning the Norwegian Women's Cup for the first time. In August 2018, Paris Saint-Germain of the Division 1 F√©minine signed Daiane to a three-year contract. In August 2019, Daiane joined CD Tac√≥n in the Primera Divisi√≥n. International career Daiane was called up to the Brazil under-20 selection for the first time in August 2015. She played well at the 2016 FIFA U-20 Women's World Cup in Papua New Guinea, being named player of the match in Brazil's 1‚Äì1 draw with Sweden. In January 2018, national team coach Vad√£o named Daiane in the senior Brazil women's national football team squad for the first time. She made her debut on 13 March 2018, in a 7‚Äì0 win over Bolivia at the 2018 Copa Am√©rica Femenina. Brazil remained undefeated and won the tournament, securing qualification for the 2019 FIFA Women's World Cup in France. Daiane retained her place in the squad for the 2018 Tournament of Nations in July and August 2018. Daiane was not included in Brazil's initial squad for the 2019 FIFA Women's World Cup, but received a late call-up when √ârika withdrew with a calf injury. Personal life Daiane is from a large family, variously reported as being among 18 or 23 siblings. When she turned professional she began sending money to her family in Uberl√¢ndia, explaining that her priority was helping her parents to buy their own house.

After winning a minor event on her debut she took the Prix Vanteaux and was then awarded the Prix Saint-Alary on the disqualification of We Are. She failed to win in three subsequent starts and was retired from racing at the end of the year. Background Vazira is a bay mare with no white markings bred in France by her owner, Aga Khan IV. She was sent into training with Alain de Royer-Dupr√© in France and was ridden in all but one of her races by Christophe Soumillon. She was from the first crop of foals sired by Sea the Stars who won the 2000 Guineas, Epsom Derby and Prix de l'Arc de Triomphe in 2009. His other major winners have included Harzand, Taghrooda, Stradivarius and Sea The Moon. Vazira's dam Vadaza showed good racing form, winning one race and being placed twice at Listed level before becoming a very successful broodmare whose other foals included Vadapolina (Prix de Psych√©) and Vadawina (Prix Saint-Alary). She was a half-sister to Valixir and closely related to both Valyra and Val Royal. Racing career =2014: three-year-old season= Vazira was unraced as a two-year-old and made her debut on 31 March 2014 in a maiden race over 1900 metres on the synthetic Polytrack surface at Saint-Cloud. Starting the 1.7/1 favourite she led the field into the straight and rallied after being overtaken in the last 200 metres to regain the advantage and win by half a length from Salawi. Less than a month after her maiden win, the filly was stepped up in class and started the 8/11 favourite for the Group 3 Prix Vanteaux over the same distance on very soft turf at Longchamp Racecourse. After racing in mid- division in the six-runner field she made progress in the straight and took the lead 200 metres out. Despite hanging right in the closing stages she kept on well under pressure to win by a short neck from the Jean-Claude Rouget- trained Kenzadargent with the pair finishing three lengths clear of Crisolles in third. On 25 May Vazira was moved up in class and distance for the Prix Saint-Alary over 2000 metres at Longchamp and started the 5/4 favourite ahead of the unbeaten We Are. The best of the other five runners appeared to be Goldy Espony (Prix Penelope), Lady Penko (Prix Caravelle) and Stormyra (Prix La Camargo). She bucked exiting the starting stalls and raced at the rear of the field before beginning to make progress in the straight. Despite staying on well she never looked likely to win and was beaten three lengths into second place by We Are. The winner was subsequently disqualified after a post- race test revealed an \\"excessively high\\" level of testosterone in her sample and the race was awarded to Vazira. In June Vazira was sent to England to contest the Ribblesdale Stakes over one and a half miles at Royal Ascot and headed the betting at odds of 9/4. After being restrained at the rear of the twelve-runner field she kept on well in the straight but never looked likely to win and came home fourth, one and three quarter lengths behind the winner Bracelet. After a break of two months the filly returned for the Prix de la Nonette over 2000 metres at Deauville in which she was ridden by Christophe Lemaire and finished fourth of the seven runners behind Avenir Certain. In October Vazira ended her career with a step up in distance to contest the 3000 metre Prix Chaudenay at Longchamp and started 3/1 favourite in a nine-runner field. After being reluctant to enter the stalls she was in contention for most of the way but faded badly in the straight to finish last. Breeding record Vazira was retired from racing to become a broodmare for the Aga Khan's stud. Her foals include: *Variyann, a colt, foaled in 2016, sired by Shamardal Pedigree *Vazira is inbred 4 √ó 4 to Mr. Prospector, meaning that this stallion appears twice in the fourth generation of her pedigree.

In 1920, it became a standing committee in the House of Commons. History Margaret Bondfield, a member of the CCWE. The Central Committee on Women's Employment (CCWE) was created on 20 August 1914, by the Home Secretary. The committee had fourteen members, of whom five were women. Lady Crewe, the wife of Robert Crewe-Milnes, 1st Marquess of Crewe, was appointed the chairman, Harold Tennant's wife Margaret was appointed the treasurer, and Mary Macarthur was appointed secretary of the organisation. Labour movement members Susan Lawrence, Margaret Bondfield, and Marion Phillips were also members of the committee. The CCWE received funding from the newly formed Ministry of Labour, and the Queen consort Mary of Teck donated money from the Queen's Fund. After the War, ¬£500,000 was given from the National Relief Fund to the CCWE for women whose incomes and opportunities had been affected by the War. The CCWE aimed to provide employment for women, especially those who had become unemployed or displaced due to the First World War. It initially encouraged women to take up war-related jobs, such as providing army clothes for the War Office and the British Army, and knitted jumpers for babies. The Labour movement through the committee campaigned for women's rights, in particular equal pay for equal work, and jobs at the end of the war, as well as the reduction of short time working hours for women. In September 1914, the employment rate for women was 8.5% lower than the previous month. In 1914, the minimum rate for women to be paid for relief work was 3d per hour, up to a maximum of 10/- including housing allowance. For other jobs, women could receive more than 3d, for example cleaners typically received 5d per hour. After the War, the organisation became the Central Committee on Women's Training and Employment (CCWTE). The CCWTE focused on retraining women who became unemployed when the men returned. During the inter war years, Violet Markham was the CCWTE's chairwoman. In 1919, the government pledged HM Treasury money for \\"housecraft\\" training, and gave the CCWTE ¬£50,000 to help with other training. In 1920, the Central Committee on Women's Employment became a standing committee in the House of Commons. Courses that trained women in midwifery, hairdressing, massage, teaching, as well as domestic work, ended in 1922 when funding ran out. Using funding from the Empire Settlement Act 1922, the CCWTE set up a home training centre in Market Harborough, and later set up home training centres in Glasgow, Harrogate, Newcastle, Leamington Spa, and London. Other In 1915, an Irish Central Committee for the Employment of Women (CCEW) was created, to serve a similar purpose in Ireland.

Since January 2019, Miranda has served as the Democratic Massachusetts State Representative for the Fifth Suffolk district. Her district comprises parts of the Dorchester and Roxbury neighborhoods of Boston. She is a member of the Massachusetts Black and Latino Legislative Caucus.  Early life and education  Miranda was born on June 29, 1981 in Dorchester, Boston. Her mother was a high school junior at the time of Miranda's birth, motivating her to drop out of education and begin to work to support her family. From 1998 to 2002, Miranda attended Wellesley College, from which she graduated after four years with a Bachelor of Arts in Africana studies and urban studies.  Death of her brother  On August 20, 2017, Miranda's 28-year-old brother, Michael A. Miranda, was shot and killed outside a nightclub in Boston's theater district. He was pronounced dead at 7:17 p.m. EST. This has inspired some of her campaign issues on stronger gun control, criminal justice reform, youth education (by introducing alternatives to violence) and the treatment of the distribution and oversight of firearms as a federal issue.  2018 State House campaign  Citing President Trump's 2016 election as an important motivating factor, Miranda launched a campaign to seek the fifth Suffolk seat in the Massachusetts House of Representatives after the incumbent, Evandro Carvalho, opted not to run for reelection, launching instead an unsuccessful bid for the Democratic party's nomination in the position of Suffolk County district attorney. She faced a largely contested Democratic primary, but garnered a total of 59.4 percent of the votes in a field of four declared candidates. In the general election, she faced Republican nominee Althea Garrison, a perennial candidate for the seat who had previously served as the district's representative from 1993 to 1995. Miranda won overwhelmingly in the general election, with 88.7 percent to Garrison's 11 percent. Subsequently, Miranda was sworn into the State House on January 2, 2019.

Probably of Khurasani and Iranian origin, they were rivals of the Turkish guard, and played a major role in the court conflicts that marked the decade of the \\"Anarchy at Samarra\\" in the 860s. Origin The term derives from the Persian chƒÅkir, \\"household servant\\", later also with the meaning of \\"bodyguard\\". The term appears in the Umayyad period, but exclusively for the native Iranian armed retinues of Transoxianian potentates, both Arabs and non-arabs. The term vanishes from the sources after the Abbasid Revolution, and reappears only in a letter by the Khurasani Iranian noble Tahir ibn Husayn to Caliph al-Ma'mun (), during civil war of the Fourth Fitna. It then appears as a distinct group in 839/840, in al-Tabari's history of the reign of al-Mu'tasim (). By the reign of al-Wathiq, but likely already during the reign of al-Mu'tasim, they had been formed into a distinct contingent or regiment of the regular army. In the sources, they usually appear along with the jund, which in earlier times signified the free Arab warriors, as distinct from the Turkish corps of slave soldiers (mawƒÅlƒ´ or ghilmƒÅn) created by al-Mu'tasim. They were administered by a special fiscal department, the dƒ´wƒÅn al-jund wa-al-shƒÅkiriyya. In the sources they only appear as cavalry, and in small detachments of a few hundred, although the total force probably numbered a few thousand (but not likely more than 5,000). Unlike the Turks, who were concentrated around the Caliph in Samarra, the new capital established by al-Mu'tasim, the shƒÅkiriyya were spread out. They had cantonments not only in Samarra, but also in the old capital Baghdad, in Raqqa in Upper Mesopotamia, along the road to Mecca, in Egypt, Fars, and possibly also Adharbayjan. Ethnic Composition and Politics Their ethnic composition is not discussed explicitly in the sources, but it appears that they were mostly of Khurasani Iranian origin, drawn from the troops that had fought for al-Ma'mun in the Fourth Fitna. In the list of cantonments of the regular regiments in Samarra a number of Khurasani commanders (quwwƒÅd) and their followers (a·π£hƒÅb) are mentioned as settled \\"in the jund and the shƒÅkiriyya\\", and in the few occasions where shƒÅkirƒ´ commanders are mentioned, their names denote a Khurasani origin. Hugh N. Kennedy suggested that these troops were raised by Tahir ibn Husayn for service in the west, and that the name was chosen as \\"a sort of honorific, referring back to a heroic and chivalrous past\\". Kennedy also suggested that remnants of the pre-civil war Abbasid army, the abnƒÅ æ al-dawla, may have been incorporated in the jund and shƒÅkiriyya. From their very origin, the shƒÅkiriyya were rivals of the Turks for power and influence at court; on his accession, Caliph al-Mutawakkil () paid them double the donative given to the Turks, as a deliberate move to court their favour and use them as a counterbalance to the latter. Likewise, the shƒÅkiriyya appear to have been partisans of the Tahirid governors of Baghdad, the heirs of Tahir ibn Husayn, at least until the Abbasid civil war of 865‚Äì866. History In 839/840, the governor of Yemen, Ja'far ibn Dinar al-Khayyat, attacked \\"those of the shƒÅkiriyya that were with him\\", causing the ire of al- Mu'tasim, who dismissed and briefly imprisoned him. In 844/845, when the Banu Sulaym Bedouin in the Hejaz became restive, al-Wathiq sent Hammad ibn Jarir al-Tabari with 200 shƒÅkiriyya to prevent them from entering Medina. As the rebellion continued, more troops under Bugha the Elder were dispatched, including Turks and shƒÅkiriyya. Bugha defeated the tribes and suppressed the uprising. In 848/849, the shƒÅkiriyya participated in repeated efforts of quelling the resistance of the rebel Muhammad ibn al-Ba'ith ibn Halbas in Adharbayjan. Ibn al-Ba'ith had fortified himself with his followers in the city of Marand and withstood several Abbasid attacks, until Bugha al-Shabir managed to turn many of his supporters away with letters of pardon and safe- conduct (amƒÅn). In the same year, many of the shƒÅkiriyya escorted the prominent Turkish leader Itakh when he went on the Hajj, but when the latter entered Baghdad on his return journey, the local shƒÅkiriyya supported the moves of the Tahirid governor of Baghdad, Ishaq ibn Ibrahim al-Mus'abi which led to Itakh's arrest and death. Forty shƒÅkiriyya horsemen participated along with 30 Turks and 30 MaghƒÅriba horsemen in the escort for the prisoner exchange with the Byzantines in early 856. The presence of shƒÅkiriyya stationed in Egypt is mentioned by al-Tabari for 855/856, during the revolt of the Bujah people. When a disgruntled faction of the Turks murdered Caliph al- Mutawakkil in 861, the jund and the shƒÅkiriyya gathered before the Public Gate of the palace to protest. In the summer of 862, a contingent of shƒÅkiriyya participated in the army of 10,000 men led by Wasif al-Turki against the Byzantine frontier region, that resulted in the capture of Faruriyyah. On 9 June 862, two days after the accession of al-Musta'in (), a group of fifty shƒÅkiriyya, joined by Tabariyya cavalry and other soldiers, as well as the \\"hotheads and the rabble from the market\\", charged the escort of the caliph, provided by the Ushrusaniyya and Maghariba regiments, shouting \\"Victory to al- Mu'tazz\\", the son of al-Mutawakkil who had been forced to renounce his succession rights in April, under pressure from the Turkish commanders. The riot was suppressed with heavy losses on both sides. On 26 March 863, amidst the emotional response of the Baghdadi populace over the news of the recent death in battle against the Byzantines of two of the most distinguished Muslim commanders, Umar al-Aqta and Ali ibn Yahya al-Armani, the jund and the shƒÅkiriyya rioted in Baghdad, demanding their salaries. In 864/864, the jund and the shƒÅkiriyya in Fars rioted against the governor, the Tahirid Abdallah ibn Ishaq ibn Ibrahim, and looted his residence; Abdallah barely escaped with his own life, while one of his guests was killed. During the siege of Baghdad in the civil war of 865‚Äì866, the shƒÅkiriyya were among the most important defenders of Baghdad and Caliph al-Musta'in against the Samarra forces, and shƒÅkiriyya flocked to the city from outlying garrisons as far as Raqqa and Malatya to sustain the struggle. One of the Tahirids, al-Husayn ibn Isma'il, was a commander of the shƒÅkiriyya during the conflict. When the Tahirid governor of Baghdad Muhammad ibn Abdallah ibn Tahir negotiated a settlement that ended the war with the recognition of the Samarra-based caliph al-Mu'tazz (), the shƒÅkiriyya felt betrayed, and rioted on 24 September 866, when their salaries fell in arrears. They managed to maintain their position in Baghdad after Muhammad's death in 867, until Sulayman ibn Abdallah ibn Tahir, arrived from Khurasan in 869 with loyal troops of his own, led by a certain Muhammad ibn Aws al-Balkhi. Their arrival, and the demand that they now receive the proceeds of the Tahirid estates in Iraq, triggered a clash between the forces of Ibn Aws and the shƒÅkiriyya and the populace of Baghdad, who were led by junior members of the local Tahirid branch: al-Husayn ibn Isma'il and a former Tahirid mawla, al-Shah ibn Mikal. In the end, Ibn Aws and his men were expelled from the city and became brigands in the area of the Nahrawan Canal. During the brief reign of al-Muhtadi (), the shƒÅkiriyya again opposed the Turks, bringing the Caliph to safety, and clashing openly with the Turks after the death of one of their commanders, Attab ibn Attab. Following the rise of Caliph al-Mu'tamid () and his brother al-Muwaffaq to power in 870, however, the shƒÅkiriyya disappear from record as a distinct body. It is likely that as part of al-Muwaffaq's deal with the Turks, the latter achieved a monopoly in the military, and all other groups, including the shƒÅkiriyya, were disbanded. The men of the shƒÅkiriyya may have been otherwise enrolled in the army after that, and it is certain that some of the figures associated with them remained in influential positions for some time‚Äîal-Husayn ibn Isma'il remained chief of police (·π£ƒÅ·∏•ib al-shur·π≠a) in Baghdad at least until 884/885‚Äîand according to Kennedy it is possible that some of the old shƒÅkiriyya soldiers served with them.

The project is part of a larger \\"data art\\" movement and the developing field of climate change art, which seeks to overcome human tendency to value personal experience over data by creating accessible experiential representations of climate change data. Tempestries are produced by knitting or crocheting a single row in a specified color representing the high temperature each day for a year, and multiple works are typically displayed together to show change over time. The project began in 2017 in Anacortes, Washington, US, and has since spread throughout the country and around the world. The word \\"tempestry\\" is a portmanteau of \\"temperature\\" and \\"tapestry.\\" History The first tempestry was created using 2016 data from the Naval Air Station on Whidbey Island, Washington. Emily McNeil, Marissa Connelly, and Justin Connelly, having read about climatologists trying to preserve climate research data in preparation for anticipated removal of such data from US government websites by the Trump administration, were \\"joking\\" that \\"we should return to more concrete forms of data storage.\\" In January 2017 McNeil, Marissa Connelly and Justin Connelly founded the project in Anacortes, Washington to encourage other fiber artists to produce \\"striking visuals that communicate changes at an intimate, local scale.\\" According to Justin Connelly, \\"The science articles talk about what's happening at the poles. For many people, that's not their experience and so they don't relate to it in a powerful way...but even here [outside Seattle], in a temperate place, you can see stark change over the last 40 years or so. It puts it in their backyard.\\" The project name is a portmanteau of the words \\"temperature\\" and \\"tapestry.\\" The organization offers kits including yarn, instructions, and a data sheet of daily temperatures in a given location. In 2017 they sold 40 kits and in 2018, 500. The 2018‚Äì19 United States federal government shutdown temporarily affected production for the US, as the National Oceanic and Atmospheric Administration (NOAA) restricted access to the databases used to provide historical weather data for the United States. The concept was inspired by a similar fiberwork concept called a \\"temperature blanket\\", an afghan- or bedspread-sized project commemorating a particular year by working stripes or bands of colors representing each day's high or low temperature for a year. As of December 2018 projects had been created by fiber artists in nearly every U.S. state and in 20 other countries. Production Color cards for Fahrenheit and Celsius Each tempestry is knitted or crocheted, one row each day, in the specified color for each date's high temperature starting on January 1 and ending on December 31 for a given year in a single location to form a banner the size of a scarf that graphically represents a year of daily high temperatures in a single location. Colors for each five-degree temperature range are standardized and temperature data is collected from the NOAA so that collected displays of work by different artists working in different locations and on different years can be interpreted as direct comparisons. Because gauge is different between crochet vs. knitting, for different knit stitches, and among different crafters, finished tempestries will vary in length and width depending on whether they're created by the same crafter using the same stitch or are created by different crafters using a variety of stitches. Some crafters' gauge varies, and two works created even by a crafter with a very stable gauge using the same stitch will inevitably vary slightly. Display Tempestries for Deception Pass, WA, USA (L - R: 1950 to 2017) at the Museum of Northwest Art Tempestry banners are typically hung vertically, the first row (representing January 1) at the bottom and the final row (December 31) at the top, in groupings of two or more to show how daily high temperatures have changed year-to-year in a given location. Project pieces were first publicly displayed in Anacortes, Washington. In 2018 projects were displayed at the Museum of Northwest Art and at the Creative Climate Awards in New York City. In May 2019 a project consisting of 27 tempestries representing 100 years on Orcas Island in 4-year increments was displayed at the Pacific Northwest Quilt and Fiberarts Museum. In 2020 pieces were displayed at the San Juan Islands Museum of Art and at Temple University's Ginsberg Health Sciences Library. Projects In 2019 a group of US knitters organized a National Park Tempestry Project, inviting crafters to create a tempestry for 2016 ‚Äì the year of the National Park Service Centennial ‚Äì and one for the earliest year for which data was available for each US National Park. In 2019 the Schuylkill Center for Environmental Education near Philadelphia organized a project using data provided by the Franklin Institute to create tempestries for the city, one for every fifth year from 1875 through 2018. Crafters in Mexico City organized a similar project. Similar artworks According to data journalist David McCandless, tempestries and similar creations are part of a larger data art movement in which data is represented in novel ways. Grace Ebert, writing for Colossal, calls such projects \\"part of a larger movement to document micro weather changes that may serve as indicators of broader climate issues.\\" =Works inspired by The Tempestry Project= Faculty at North Central Michigan College produced a similar exhibit in 2018 inspired by The Tempestry Project. Pennsylvania State University professor Laura Guertin contributed a poster to the American Geophysical Union's 2017 Fall meeting displaying similar works for January through April 1917, 1967, and 2017. Some fiber artists have created banners similar to tempestries, but using daily low temperatures. =Other climate change art= Other artists and scientists are experimenting with climate change art as a way to overcome humans' hardwired tendency to value personal experience over data and to disengage from data-based representations by making the data \\"vivid and accessible\\". In 2018, artist Xavier Cortada's project Underwater Home Owner's Association placed signs in front yards throughout Miami, Florida indicating each property's height above sea level to illustrate what sea level rise would flood that property. Ed Hawkins' \\"alt=a series of thin vertical stripes in various shades of blue and red, showing more blues at one end and more reds at the other to represent increasing average temperatures over time In 2016, Ed Hawkins, a climate scientist at the National Centre for Atmospheric Science and the University of Reading, created \\"Climate Spirals,\\" a series of data art representations of climate change, and followed in 2018 with \\"warming stripes,\\" a series of color stripes representing chronologically ordered average annual temperature anomalies for a given location. In 2015, University of Georgia marine scientist Joan Sheldon produced a scarf illustrating average yearly temperature from the 1600s to the present using one row per year. In 2012, filmmaker Jeff Orlowski made Chasing Ice, documenting photographer James Balog's Extreme Ice Survey, which uses time-lapse photography to show the disappearance of glaciers over time. In 2007, artist Eve Mosher used a sports-field chalk marker to draw a blue \\"high- water\\" line around Manhattan and Brooklyn, showing the areas that would be underwater if climate change predictions are realized. Her HighWaterLine Project has since drawn high-water lines around Bristol, Philadelphia, and two coastal cities in Florida. =Other fiber data art= In 2005, the Knitting Map, a European Capital of Culture project in Cork, Ireland, recorded the city's daily temperatures and citizen walking patterns to create a \\"fiber representation of the city.\\" Sarah-Marie Belcastro uses knitting to explore mathematics, such as knitting a \\"non-orientable surface of genus 5\\".

She is currently serving a life imprisonment sentence for four murders and other crimes. Their similar backgrounds, psychopathology and modus operandi led the media to refer to Fabi√°nov√° as \\"the Czech Aileen Wuornos.\\"  Adolescence and first crimes  Jaroslava Fabi√°nov√° was born in 1965 and was a victim of repeated sexual violence in early childhood. Her parents divorced when she was 13 years old, and since neither parent showed interest in their children, she was abandoned. In 1981, in Dƒõƒç√≠n, she joined a group of her Roma peers who engaged in petty theft and occasional prostitution. Later that year, Fabi√°nov√° took part in several burglaries. In October, she killed 78-year-old Vladimir Z. using a masonry hammer and a kitchen knife when he refused to pay her for sexual services. She stabbed him in the face with a stitching awl. She was apprehended one day after the murder and charged with murder and her earlier burglaries. As a minor, she was sentenced to 7 years imprisonment, but served only 4 years and 9 months. After serving her sentence, she became a switchman at ƒåesk√© dr√°hy, but continued engaging in prostitution, later drugging and robbing her clients. In 1996, she was arrested for the death of a Hungarian tourist, who died of an overdose as a result of her drugging his beer with a hypnotic to rob him. Fabi√°nov√° was sentenced to 10 years in prison, followed up with a 5-year ban on visiting Prague, serving her sentence in the Pardubice women's penitentiary. She was released on parole in 2001. Despite her legal banishment from Prague, she stole a cell phone there on February 23 and sold it to a pawnbroker. However, she sold it using her own ID, and was arrested and sentenced to one year in jail with 3 years probation.  Apprehension and conviction  On June 5, 2003, Augustin K. was found in Prague's Po≈ô√≠ƒç√≠ district. He had been murdered in the kitchen with a cleaver, with the corpse then pulled out of the living room, sat in a chair and covered with a blanket. The apartment was then robbed of three paintings and electric tools worth 50,000 crowns. DNA traces found at the scene matched Jaroslava Fabi√°nov√°. A woman present in the building on the day of the murder recognized Fabi√°nov√°. Another witness said that she helped her by selling one of the stolen paintings to a gallery for 10,000 crowns. Originally, Fabi√°nov√° had offered all three paintings, but she sold one later herself for 2,000 crowns and she later disposed of the last one because it was damaged. After this, a warrant for her arrest was issued. At the beginning of August, she was hospitalized in Prague, and after release, she decided to stay in the city. On August 8, she met 31-year-old Richard S. on a tram, who invited her to a disco and then to his home. There, Fabi√°nov√° stabbed him 38 times in the bathroom with a knife. Her DNA was found on the victim's fingernails. On August 22, she was arrested and charged with both murders. During the investigation, she claimed that Augustin K. gave her the paintings, and because he did not feel well, she left the apartment. In the case of Richard S., she admitted that she had robbed the man, but denied having hurt him. In 2005, she was found guilty and became the third woman in the history of the Czech Republic to be sentenced to life.  Media  Jaroslava Fabi√°nov√° (renamed \\"Ms. Fialov√°\\") was portrayed by Anna Pol√≠vkov√° in the P≈ô√≠pady 1. oddƒõlen√≠ episode \\"Nen√°vist\\" (\\"Hatred\\").

Kauba produced a number of innovative designs and the company built several prototypes, with the SK 257 fighter-trainer entering limited production before being cancelled. The company ceased to exist at the end of the war. History Otto Kauba was an Austrian engineer who developed a novel idea for a flying bomb during World War II. His personal friendship with Hermann G√∂ring led to a joint collaboration with the ≈†koda Works. The ≈†koda- Kauba Flugzeugbau was opened in Prague, Czechoslovakia in 1942.Saffek & Plocek (1992). Kauba went on to produce a number of innovative aircraft and the company built several prototypes, with the SK 257 fighter-trainer entering limited production before being cancelled. The company ceased to exist when Prague was liberated at the end of the war in 1945.Titz & Zazvonil (1965). After the war Kauba returned to his native Austria and later designed the country's first postwar type to fly, the OFW OK-15. Aircraft designs Otto Kauba produced a variety of aircraft designs, many of them novel. Several were completed and flown, and one briefly entered production. =Unconventional lightweight prototypes= ≈†koda-Kauba built a succession of lightweight experimental prototypes, many of them re-using parts from earlier ones. The V1A was a manned test prototype for an unconventional flight control arrangement, intended for use on a proposed flying bomb. The wing was tailless, with elevon control surfaces mounted on double booms trailing behind the outer wing section. Directional control was by differential drag surfaces on the wing trailing edges. It crashed on its first flight. The next example, designated simply V1, was similar but also fitted with a conventional rudder and flew after a fashion. The V2 was similar to the V1 but had a swept wing, reducing the length of the mounting booms, but its performance was little better and the flying bomb project was terminated. The V3 was a conventional light aircraft built using parts from the V1A, the V6 used parts from the V1 to create a pusher design with twin tail booms and conventional flight controls, and the V7 cannibalised the V2 wing for another pusher with a canard foreplane though it was never completed. The V6 design was subsequently modified as the SL6, with its twin booms repositioned and an outboard tail fitted, to test yet another novel control system, this time being developed by Blohm & Voss for their P208 pusher-powered high-speed fighter. =Fighters and trainers= The SK V4 was a conventional design for a fighter trainer and a prototype was flown. The prototype was sufficiently promising for a production version, designated the SK 257, to be developed. The SK 257 was a conventional fighter and entered production. manufacturing was allocated to the nearby Avia factory, where the manufacturing quality proved so poor that the contract was cancelled after only a handful had been built. Development work also began on a more powerful fighter variant, the V5. It progressed as far as wind tunnel testing before the RLM decided that it really did not need another fighter project and cancelled it in favour of the Focke-Wulf Ta 152. =Ramjet power= Kauba became interested in a ramjet propulsion unit being developed by Eugen S√§nger. He designed a novel interceptor fighter, the P14, around it with the large ramjet powerplant forming an integral part of the aircraft structure. The ramjet project was cancelled in 1944 and the P14 design abandoned. =List of types= Types designed by Kauba included:Nowarra (1993). * ≈†koda-Kauba V1: Piloted test prototype with novel control surfaces. * ≈†koda-Kauba V1A: Variant of the V-1 with conventional rudder added. * ≈†koda- Kauba V2: Variant of the V-1 with swept wing. * ≈†koda-Kauba V3: Single-seat light plane of conventional design. * ≈†koda-Kauba V4: Conventional fighter trainer prototype. * ≈†koda-Kauba V5: Fighter project, developed from the SK 257. * ≈†koda-Kauba V6: Twin-boom pusher prototype. * ≈†koda-Kauba V7: Canard pusher project. * ≈†koda-Kauba V8: Two-seat primary trainer prototype. * ≈†koda- Kauba V9: Lightweight aircraft project. * ≈†koda-Kauba V10: Trainer project. * ≈†koda-Kauba V11: Advanced trainer project. * ≈†koda-Kauba V12: Forward-swept research project. * ≈†koda-Kauba SK 257: Production fighter trainer. * ≈†koda- Kauba SL6: Outboard tail modification of the V6. * ≈†koda-Kauba P14: Ramjet powered fighter project.

The company has worked with the UK government, and is linked with the Conservative Party, Dominic Cummings, Vote Leave, and Cambridge Analytica. The company was founded in 2014, by Marc Warner, Se Miao Angie Ma, and Daniel James Hulme. While Warner and Ma remain at the company, Hulme resigned from the company in 2016. The company was a supplier to the Vote Leave campaign during the 2016 United Kingdom EU referendum. Between 2017-2018, journalist Carole Cadwalladr exposed Faculty's (then ASI Data Science) involvement in the Facebook‚ÄìCambridge Analytica data scandal,and reported that members of ASI Data Science were part of an intricate web performing work for Vote Leave, Steve Bannon, Donald Trump, Nigel Farage, and Cambridge Analytica. The Guardian reported in 2020 that Faculty had received ¬£260,000 from Dominic Cummings personal firm to work on Vote Leave. Following the Cambridge Analytica scandal, ASI Data Science rebranded as Faculty in 2019. Following the company's involvement with Vote Leave, Marc Warner has spoken publicly about the benefits of Brexit and the advantages to the AI industry. Controversy  In February 2018, the Home Office and ASI developed a terrorist content blocking tool that claimed to identify 94% of Daesh propaganda, aiding in preventing it from being uploaded to the Internet. Despite considerable hype by Faculty, the tool was widely criticised and it was reported by Wired (magazine) that Daesh could easily dodge the tool. In 2019, it was then reported by the Financial Times that the tool had not been adopted by any companies, even after it had been offered free of charge. During the coronavirus pandemic, Faculty and the CIA-backed Palantir carried out data analysis work for the UK government. The Guardian reported in May 2020 that Faculty had won seven government contracts in 18 months at a time when Warner's brother Ben Warner had gone to work with Dominic Cummings as a data scientist. It further emerged that Warner had also attended SAGE meetings. The government contracts were raised at a Cabinet Office meeting, and when Warner was asked how he ensured that he \\"did not influence\\" the awarding of several contracts to Faculty, he declined to answer the question. The newspaper noted that a source at the UK's Department of Health had described Marc Warner dropping Cummings‚Äô name in his meetings, saying the chief executive of Faculty gave the impression he had the personal support of the prime minister‚Äôs chief adviser. ‚ÄúIt felt like he was bragging about it,‚Äù the senior source said, saying Warner would casually tell officials: ‚ÄúDon‚Äôt worry, I‚Äôll text Dom,‚Äù or ‚ÄúI‚Äôm talking to Dom later.‚Äù The same month it was reported that Faculty had secured a ¬£400,000 contract with the Ministry of Housing, Communities and Local Government (MHCLG) to \\"analyse social media data, utility bills and credit rating scores\\" in order to \\"identify trends, and then develop \\"interactive dashboards\\" to inform policymakers\\". According to The Guardian, the contract was awarded directly to Faculty without it being put out to tender for other firms to bid on it. Theodore Agnew, the Cabinet Minister with responsibility for promoting the use of technology in public services had a shareholding in the company worth ¬£90,000 raising questions of potential conflict of interest.

Fiestas patronales (patron saint festivals) are held in the central plaza every year. History Puerto Rico was ceded by Spain in the aftermath of the Spanish-American War under the terms of the Treaty of Paris of 1898 and became a territory of the United States. In 1899, the United States conducted its first census of Puerto Rico finding that the combined population of Las Mar√≠as Pueblo and Maravilla barrios was 1,235. (At the time, the census takers didn't distinguish between the current three separate Maravilla barrios- Maravilla Este, Maravilla Norte and Maravilla Sur). The central plaza history The central plaza, or square, is a place for official and unofficial recreational events and a place where people can gather and socialize from dusk to dawn. The Laws of the Indies, Spanish law, which regulated life in Puerto Rico in the early 19th century, stated the plaza's purpose was for \\"the parties\\" (celebrations, festivities) (), and that the square should be proportionally large enough for the number of neighbors (). These Spanish regulations also stated that the streets nearby should be comfortable portals for passersby, protecting them from the elements: sun and rain.

It is a remake of the Bengali film Badshah. The film stars Dev Kumar, Indrani Mukherjee and Mala Sinha. It focuses on a stonehearted dacoit who, when thrust with the responsibility of bringing up a lost child he finds on a riverbank, mends his ways and becomes an honest wage- earner.  Plot  Badshah is a stonehearted dacoit. One day he goes to rob a house, but the arrival of the police forces him to flee. He hides at a place where he finds a girl named Jamna kidnapped and tied; he rescues the girl, who works as a street dancer. Jamna develops an immediate liking for Badshah, despite knowing his profession. One day, Badshah sees one of his enemies and pursues him on a small boat in the Ganges. But the boat drowns in the flood. Badshah survives and finds a young boy crying at the shore. The boy was trapped in the flood and actually belonged to a married couple of the village. Badshah cannot bring himself to leave the boy alone, so he takes the boy. He goes to Jamna to give her the child so that she can take care of him. But she refuses, thinking the child is Badshah's son. Badshah takes responsibility of the child who he names Bacchu. Developing a deep attachment towards Bachhu, Badshah redeems himself by abandoning dacoity. Elsewhere, Bacchu's biological mother Madhu is grief-stricken at having lost her only child. Badshah begins making a living by singing and dancing on the streets. Ten years later, he falls ill one day and Bacchu goes to sing alone, at which point he meets his mother. Both Madhu and her husband recognise Bachhu as their son by his locket. They go to Badshah to seek permission for taking Bacchu along with them. After initial hesitation, Badshah assents so that Bacchu can have a better home and education. But both Badshah and Bacchu are really sad to have parted from each other. Badshah falls ill and his condition seriously deteriorates. Bacchu flees from his home to meet Badshah, but by the time he arrives, Badshah has already died.  Cast  * Dev Kumar as Badshah * Indrani Mukherjee as Jamna * Mala Sinha as Madhu  Production  Mere Lal, a remake of the Bengali film Badshah, was directed by Satyen Bose and produced by Jyotsna Sen under S. S. Chitra Mandir. It was edited by Mukhtar Ahmed, and photographed by Marshall Braganza.  Soundtrack  The soundtrack was composed by the duo Laxmikant‚ÄìPyarelal.  Release and reception  K. L. Arora of the magazine Thought wrote, \\"Though it is not as tear-strung a film as [Bose's] other productions, yet Mere Lal has a few poignant moments which would melt the tears of the stone-hearted among the audience.\\" He praised the performance of Kumar as Badshah but criticised Braganza's cinematography, and a scene where a doctor prescribes a water-soaked cloth massage on the forehead of a pneumonia patient, saying \\"Not even a quack would do that.\\" The film was commercially successful.

Murillo's many artistic depictions of the immaculate conception of the Virgin Mary were enormously influential on later art. This painting is regarded as one of his best. It was earlier identified as the Immaculate Conception of the Granja due to a mistaken understanding of its history. Background Although the doctrine that Mary was conceived without sin was not dogmatically defined in the Catholic Church until 1854, that she was sinless was declared in 1661 by Pope Alexander VII, a declaration for which the Spanish church and the Franciscan order had long been strong proponents. To the Spanish Marian cult, not just Mary's purity but the concept that she had been conceived without sin was essential. This was the belief held by Spain and the Franciscans; by contrast, the Dominican order argued that she had been conceived in sin but purified while unborn in her mother's womb. Even though the immaculate conception doctrine would not be embraced for several centuries, the Spanish rejoiced at the declaration of purity, and many Spanish artists were commissioned to depict the theme. Murillo himself produced 20 such paintings. Composition Painted in oil, the work is displayed on a canvas by . It depicts Mary as a young woman in a white dress and blue cloak, hands clasped in prayer and eyes upraised, ascending on a crescent moon born by cherubs. These carry roses, lilies, a palm frond, and a mirror, all references to her purity and martyrdom. The crescent moon is a reference to the description of the woman of the Apocalypse, clothed with the sun and the moon under her feet, although in this version Mary (as the woman is often identified) is not crowned or pregnant. The near disappearance of the cherubs at the top of the image have been attributed with an overall sense of weightlessness of the piece. The work is simplified from some of Murillo's earlier efforts, a result of Murillo's ongoing efforts to distill the depiction to its most iconographic form. It is, accordingly, described as \\"perhaps the most perfectly resolved\\" of Murillo's Immaculate Conception images in 2005's Seventeenth-century Art and Architecture. Several influences on Murillo are found in the painting. His depiction of the age of Mary reflects the guidance of artist Francisco Pacheco, official censor of Seville's Inquisition, that the Virgin Mary should be shown always as a beautiful girl of 12 or 13 years old. Additionally, Murillo had been introduced to the works of Van Dyck and Rubens by Francisco Herrera the Younger, who was sub-director of the Seville Academy under Murillo. The influence of these painters is visible in the delicate and airy coloration of the piece. The work is dated between 1660 and 1665. Because no contract for a commission for the piece has been located, the exact date is undetermined, but the range is presumed because of the style of the piece compared to his other works of the period and because of a drawing by Murillo from 1664 of the Immaculate Conception which, though it features Mary in different pose, uses the same two cherubs from the right of this work. Legacy It is unknown whether or not the painting was produced on commission or when and why it was produced, but the image is believed to have found its way to the royals collections after purchase by Charles III in Seville. It was then part of the collection of Charles IV, following which it was registered among his collections in the Casita del Pr√≠ncipe in the Escorial. It is from this registration that the title derives. Previously believed to have been in the Granja palace, it was for some time titled the Immaculate Conception of the Granja. Murillo's formulation of the Immaculate Conception theme became a major influence on many subsequent artists. He has been described as \\"the quintessential painter of the theme of the Immaculate Conception\\" - this is one of four in the collection of the Prado. Failed restoration of another version In June 2020, it was reported that a copy of the Immaculate Conception of uncertain origin had been handed to a furniture restorer for restoration, at a cost of ‚Ç¨1,200 ($1,355; ¬£1,087). The restoration was botched, with the face of Mary left unrecognisable after two attempts. Spain's Professional Association of Restorers and Conservators (Acre) called the attempted restoration vandalism. Comparisons were made to the 2012 'Monkey Christ' incident, a similarly botched restoration of Ecce Homo.
