Heathrow Hub proposes extending both of the existing runways up to a total length of about 7,000 metres and dividing them into four so that they each provide two, full length, runways, allowing simultaneous take-offs and landings.Financial Times - Pilot plots longer Heathrow runways - 10 March 2013 The aim is to complete the construction within five years and with 100% private funds.CPS paper - Double Upon Heathrow - July 2013 Available capacity would be doubled while keeping a percentage of the slots unused in order to alter noise levels. In addition, early morning flights could land much further west along the extended runways so reducing the noise footprint for a large area of west London.The Times - Increased capacity at Heathrow - 30 October 2013 Other noise mitigation techniques include using two-stage approaches, and steeper, curved climb-outs. The Heathrow Hub concept includes a new multimodal air, rail and road interchange located approximately two miles north of Heathrow‚Äôs Terminal 5 to accommodate passenger growth. This includes a new terminal, a new railway station connecting Heathrow to the West Coast Mainline and Crossrail and direct access to the M25 motorway.

In 1966, while a student at Joseon High School, his poem ‚ÄúField of Flowers‚Äù (Kkotbat) was chosen for a prize in a nationwide writing contest for high school students sponsored by Korea University. Later his poem ‚ÄúSong of the Wind‚Äù (Baramui norae) was chosen in a similar contest put on by the Sorabol College of Arts, and in 1967 his poem ‚ÄúOn a Sleepless Night‚Äù (Bulmyeonui bame) won a prize in the spring literary contest held by the Chonnam Daily newspaper. In 1968, due to the outcome of the contest, he entered Sorabol College of Arts.\\"Song Giwon\\" LTI Korea Datasheet available at LTI Korea Library or online at: http://klti.or.kr/ke_04_03_011.do# His personal life was more tangled. Song Gi-weon was reared from early boyhood by a step-father following his parents‚Äô divorce. His biological father, an alcoholic and opium addict, lay down on railroad tracks in a state of drunkenness and lost his life when Song was just 18. As an unsettled youngster, Song often got into trouble for fighting with his classmates, but he was also a consistent winner at annual literary composition contests, and his literary talent was recognized at a young age. While maintaining a self- deprecatory view of himself as one having ‚Äúbad blood‚Äù, Song's younger years were fueled by his strong desire to be a professional writer. Song Giwon volunteered for service in the Vietnam War in 1970, but was struck by malaria and was sent home after his hospital stay. Song characterizes his Vietnam experience as a self- destructive time in his life when he put himself at death's doorway. After surviving his brush with death, he began writing poems and novels in 1974. At the early stage of his writing career, he began focusing his attention on Korea's oppressive political situation. His self-destructive instinct re- emerged at this time as ‚Äúresistance.‚Äù During the late 1970s, he employed his writing talents as a leading figure in the ‚ÄúDeclaration of the National Political Situation.‚Äù Then, in 1980, he was imprisoned for some time for his involvement in the Gim Daejung (then an opposition party leader) Incident. Afterwards, he helped plan and publish several progressive journals (Silcheon munhak, Minjung Gyoyuk, Nodong munhak, etc.) and acted as a leader in the democratization and people's movements, for which he was arrested and imprisoned several times. This temporarily halted his writing Starting in the 1990s, Song was able to return solely to creative writing. Following his travels to India and Myanmar in 1997, he became enraptured with Buddhism and turned to writing about Buddhist themes and self- observation. He has also been an active poet. Work The Wolmunli series of poems written at the beginning of Song Giwon's career affirms the vast distance between peasants and intellectuals and follows the process of discovering the wisdom hidden in the lives of the former. From the perspective of a first-person observer, the author portrays the social conditions of peasants and underscores labor as the mediating activity between man and nature. In doing so he confirms the power of land and explores the possibilities for a connection between intellectuals and peasants. ‚ÄúAt Wolmunli, IV‚Äù (Wolmunlieseo IV) contains a scenes at its end in which an old man from North Korea, Cho Mandol, who displays no interest in politics even when the entire nation is clamoring about reuniting separated families, unexpectedly decides to go in search of his younger brother. This last scene is particularly impressive, in that is successfully captures the lives of the peasants and their hard-bred wisdom, both of which sustain themselves without break during the most turbulent of times. Song writes that their lives are \\"the hardest sort of earth, and an enormous and mysterious force in that earth which pushes upward to rise through the cracks it will make and the holes it will bore without regard for rock or the sharp edges of hoes or blades of shovels.\\" In ‚ÄúAgain at Wolmunli‚Äù, the conclusion of the Wolmunli series, the scene in which the protagonist, in prison, hears of his mother's death is repeatedly juxtaposed with the scene of his visit to her grave until the two are brought to an end with the protagonist's conviction that he 'will not live as easily as mother'. The protagonist's appreciation and understanding of his mother, and his own self-revelations at the end of the poem-cycle combine to produce a highly affecting and memorable piece. Song's most recent work, Come to Me, I Will Gladly Go to You (Neoege gama naege ora) is set in a marketplace and portrays the great pains of the common people in their search for love and hope. Although their lives are tainted by despair, insanity, and violence, the author convincingly portrays their corrupt behavior as arising not from a corrupt nature, but from their desolation. Song's lyrical style is here particularly effective in portraying their grotesque lives as possessing a shimmering, haunting beauty.

It includes cards printed by hand like those produced by Sockl and Nathan and also mass-produced cards (a subsequent production method) like those produced by Marcus Ward & Co and Raphael Tuck & Sons. Some of the cards hold special significance, like Britain's first commercially produced Christmas card dating from 1843. The collection is catalogued in Laura Seddon's book A Gallery of Greetings. Another section of the collection includes 450 Valentine's Day cards dating from the early nineteenth century, which Seddon also catalogued. The cards vary from loving to crude and show a different side to the Victorian values that might be expected. The cards include fake wedding certificates, cards that make references to haliotis and others that suggest that the recipient may face being \\"left on the shelf\\".Valentine cards reveal Britain‚Äôs relationship history, Manchester Metropolitan University, retrieved 22 November 2013 History Laura Seddon got the idea for this collection after attending a presentation by Sir Harry Page, a Manchester City Council treasurer, where she saw his collection which included 276 bound scrap-albums created between 1752 and 1935. Page's aim had been to avoid collections of press cuttings but to try to find writings, paintings, \\"the prints and scraps\\" which had been gathered together by \\"young ladies\\". He had gathered many of these but his collection had spread its focus but always retaining a discernment.Scraps on Albums, Birkbeck College, 2006, retrieved 22 November 2013 Page's meta-collection suggested to Seddon that she might create her own collection. She decided to focus on early greeting cards from both the Victorian and Edwardian periods. The card collection was curated by Laura Seddon over a period of twenty years initially using George Buday's book \\"History of the Christmas Card\\". The collection became so important that she was able to donate it to the Manchester Metropolitan University. Seddon became an Honorary Fellow of the University in 1992 in recognition of her donation and achievement. Together with the Sir Harry Page collection (which was purchased by this University), these makes up the two Victorian Ephemera collections of the MMU Special Collections.

Overview The airfield of La Noblette was used by the French Air Services since summer 1915, on the northeast side of the village. At the end of 1917, the French SPA 124 escadrille which had hosted the American volunteer pilots since April 1916, was part of the \\"Groupe de Combat no 13\\", working for the French fourth army, in the Champagne area. It became \\"Escadrille Lafayette\\", while a new SPA 124 with French pilots was created, but was soon disbanded sometime in February 1918 and its pilots joined the 103rd Aero Squadron arriving at La Noblette on 13 February after its ground troops had been at Issoudun Aerodrome where they had arrived on Christmas Eve, 1917. The 103rd was incorporated in the French \\"Groupe de Combat no 21\\", still working for the French fourth army, until 10 April, when it moved further west at La Bonne Maison Aerodrome near Fismes, this time flying missions for the French sixth army. La Noblette was used by the French Air Services until March 1919, then returned to agricultural use. Today it is a series of cultivated fields located southeast of Mourmelon-le-Grand, with no indications of its wartime use.

The new definition would \\"allow a veteran or veterans‚Äô family member fleeing domestic violence or sexual assault to be categorized as homeless in order to receive certain benefits offered by the Department of Veterans‚Äô Affairs.\\" The law would increase the per diem payments that homeless veterans receive for assistance in finding a new home and authorize the payment of per diems to the dependents of homeless veterans. It passed in the United States Senate during the 113th United States Congress. Background There is a related bill, , that was introduced into the United States House of Representatives during the 113th Congress. Provisions of the bill This summary is based largely on the summary provided by the Congressional Research Service, a public domain source. The bill S. 287 would include in the formal definition of a homeless veteran, for purposes of eligibility for benefits through the Department of Veterans Affairs (VA), a veteran or veteran's family fleeing domestic or dating violence, sexual assault, stalking, or other dangerous or life- threatening conditions in the current housing situation, including where the health and safety of children are jeopardized, there is no other residence, and there is a lack of resources or support networks to obtain other permanent housing. Congressional Budget Office report This summary is based largely on the summary provided by the Congressional Budget Office, as ordered reported by the Senate Committee on Veterans‚Äô Affairs on July 24, 2013. This is a public domain source. S. 287 would reauthorize and expand several programs for homeless veterans that are administered by the Department of Veterans Affairs (VA). The Congressional Budget Office (CBO) estimated that implementing the bill would cost $842 million over the 2014‚Äì2018 period, assuming appropriation of the specified and estimated amounts. In addition, the CBO estimated that enacting the bill would decrease net direct spending by $294 million over the 2014‚Äì2023 period; therefore, pay-as-you-go procedures apply to the bill. Enacting S. 287 would not affect revenues. S. 287 contains no intergovernmental or private-sector mandates as defined in the Unfunded Mandates Reform Act (UMRA). Procedural history=Senate S. 287 was introduced into the Senate on February 12, 2013 by Sen. Mark Begich (D, AK). It was referred to the United States Senate Committee on Veterans' Affairs, which held a hearing about the bill on May 9, 2013. The bill was accompanied by Senate Report 113-110. The Senate voted by Unanimous consent on November 6, 2013 to pass the bill.

Overview The airfield was one of the major airfields used by the French Air Service about Verdun, from early 1916 to the end of the war, with Vadelaincourt other major airfield touching it. For probably some operational reason, the American 186th Aero Squadron moved here from nearby Souilly Aerodrome on 7 November 1918, already back there on 24 November, after the Armistice had been signed. Eventually, the airfield was returned to agricultural use. Today it is a series of cultivated fields located northwest of Lemmes. The airfield was located west of the D 1916, which takes its symbolic number from the fact that it was the only road always open during the Battle of Verdun for bringing supplies to the city and the front units.

New information on the skull of the enigmatic theropod Spinosaurus, with remarks on its size and affinities. Journal of Vertebrate Paleontology 25 (4), 888‚Äì896. Two other formations comprise the Kem Kem beds: the underlying Ifezouane Formation and the overlying Akrabou Formation.  Description  late Early Cretaceous (105 Ma) The Aoufous Formation was first reported by Dubar (1948) as part of the ‚ÄúSillon Preafricain‚Äù. Dubar described it from a lithological point of view as consisting mainly of clay-sandstones and green marls with gypsum. Dubar dated the sediments to the Albian / Cenomanian stages. Later, Sereno et al. (1996) reported an informal division of the Kem Kem Beds: a lower red sandstone unit (\\"gres infrecenomanien\\") and an upper marley unit (\\"marne versicolores a gypse\\"). Because of the absence of hiatuses between and within the three formations, the represented time scale is of around 8 million years, covering the time from the Early Cenomanian to the Middle Turonian. The Aoufous Formation is exposed from the Anti-Atlas and High Atlas mountain ranges up to the Sahara craton, in the southeastern part of Morocco. The formation is thick.Cavin et al., 2010, p.394  Geological history  In the early Mesozoic Era, the main displacement of the African continent was from south to north, in the direction of Europe. The Atlantic Ocean was opening with high rates of expansion. This caused the uplift of the western part of Morocco, causing exposure of Precambrian and Paleozoic rocks, and prevented a continuous deposition of Mesozoic sediments in western Morocco. In the Jurassic, most of modern Morocco had already emerged. The first marine transgression is dated to the Early Barremian. During the Barremian-Aptian, two elongated marine gulfs extended northwards along the Middle-Atlas and from the western Essaouira Basin. In the Early Cretaceous, Northern Africa was covered with deltaic and brackish environments. These deposits comprise the Kem Kem Beds and thus the Aoufous Formation too.  Age  The Aoufous Formation shows a similar fauna to that one found in the Bahariya Formation of Egypt. In both these formations, Carcharodontosaurus saharicus and Spinosaurus aegyptiacus are found. In addition, several species of crocodilians and fishes are shared. The Bahariya Formation is well dated to the Early Cenomanian. The rare microfossils found in the Aoufous Formation were not helpful in dating these sediments. For these reasons, the age of the Aoufous Formation is considered early Cenomanian.  Facies  The Aoufous Formation is characterized by three facies: variegated claystones, gypsum layers and dolomitic limestones. Claystones contain organic matter. Vertebrate remains (mostly fishes) are found in these claystones. No calcitic shells are found there, but apatitic microfossils are present. Quartz and marcasite (typical of a reducing environment) are quite frequent. In carbonaceous facies, vertebrate fossils are present. The dolomitisation of these sediments destroyed any organic presence in them. Gastropods, thin-shelled and thick- shelled ostracods and some rare agglutinated foraminifers are present in this facies. Quartz is present with different morphologies, suggesting eolian (wind-based) and fluvial (river-based) transport. In the gypsum layers, fossils are absent. These layers testify to long periods of dryness connected to evaporation of salty waters. The facies and the fossil remains suggest a paleoenvironment as a coastal lagoon or a paralic sebkha. = OT1 = OT1 is a locality ( away from Tafraout) characterized by lenses of claystone. Several fossil articulated fishes, gastropods and crustaceans specimens were recovered from this locality. The stratigraphic position of these lenses of claystone lies within the Aoufous Formation. Several features differentiate this facies from the others that are commonly encountered in the Aoufous Formation, and, for this reason, they are usually described apart. The fauna of these lenses is characterized from three cladistians (Serenoichthys kemkemensis and two other unnamed genera), an indeterminate actinopterygian, and the oldest known freshwater acanthomorph (Spinocaudichthys oumtkoutensis). The paleoenvironment of OT1 has been interpreted as a quiet lake, where the process of fossilization was quite rapid (soft tissues are generally preserved).  Vertebrate assemblage  Because fossils from the formation are usually retrieved by local people who are untrained as geologists, it is difficult to know the exact provenance of many of them. For this reason, the provenance of a fossil from the Ifezouane and the Aoufous Formations is not generally specified; in any case the two formations seem to present the same fauna. The most common vertebrate remains belong to the elasmobranch fish Onchopristis numidus. Another seven elasmobranchs are reported: Asteracanthus aegyptiacus, Distobatus nutiae, Tribodus sp., Lissodus sp., Haimirichia amonensis, Cretoxyrhinidae indet., and Marckgrafia lybica. Lungfish fossils are referred to Ceratodus humei and Neoceratodus africanus. Coelacanth remains are referred to Mawsonia lavocati and to the genus Axelrodichthys. Several taxa of Cladistia and two genera of seminiomorphs (an unnamed Lepidotes-like species and Oniichthys falipoui) are recovered in the Kem Kem beds. Teleosteans are represented by Cladocyclus pankowskii, Palaeonotopterus greenwoodi, Erfoudichthys rosae and Concavotectum moroccensis. Amphibians are also present: Kababisha sp., the pipid frog Oumtkoutia anae and non-pipids frogs. Turtles are represented by several species: Dirqadim schaefferi, the podocnemidids Hamadachelys escuilliei, the bothremydids Galianemys whitei and G. emringeri, and the araripemydids Araripemys sp. Crocodilians are commonly found; four species are present: Elosuchus cherifiensis, a genus belonged to the Trematochampsidae, Araripesuchus rattoides and Laganosuchus maghrebensis. In regards to dinosaurs, a rebbachisaurid (Rebbachisaurus garasbae) and some ornithischian footprints were recovered in the Kem Kem Beds; the most important presence belongs to theropods. Among theropods, two carcharodontosaurids (Carcharodontosaurus saharicus and Sauroniops pachytholus), one spinosaurid (Spinosaurus aegyptiacus), one coelurosaur (Deltadromeus agilis), an unnamed abelisaur and an unnamed dromaeosaur characterize the assemblage. Pterosaurs are also present, although their fossils are extremely rare and enigmatic: an azhdarchid, an ornithocheirid, a tapejarid and a pteranodontid are recognized.

The town was located at roughly the present intersection of Fillmore Street and North Nevada Avenue in Colorado Springs. History The town of Roswell, built north of Colorado Springs in 1889, was named for a man from New York, Governor Roswell P. Flower, who felt that Colorado Springs' climate was only second to Saranac, New York for its curative benefits for tuberculosis patients. (See Tuberculosis treatment in Colorado Springs). By 1899, he was an investor in mining and the Manitou and Pike's Peak Railway. The town was located on Monument Creek at the junction of the Denver and Rio Grande Western Railroad (D&RG;) and Chicago, Rock Island and Pacific Railroads (CRI&P;). The Denver and Rio Grande Western Railroad had reached the area about 1875 and in 1889, Roswell had a Chicago, Rock Island and Pacific Railroad (CRI&P;) yard. Roswell had a stone Rock Island Round House and an Atchison, Topeka and Santa Fe Railway bridge over the CRI&P; railway. There were 448 residents in 1900. In 1902, Roswell was a \\"considerable settlement\\". Its streets included: Brewster, Cable, Elm (a northern city boundary), Holly, Laurel, Low, Myrtle, Parker, Poplar, Rock Island, Roswell, Sage, and part of Cedar. Roswell had a school, Methodist Episcopal Church, and the Roswell Hotel by 1903. That year, the Roswell Park had an equestrian race track and a ballpark. According to the 1910 United States Federal census, there were 426 residents in Roswell (El Paso County precinct 22). By 1911, the population had reduced to 250 people. By 1919, Roswell was a transfer station for coal loads from the Pikeview mine to the north and the Keystone mine to the east. In the 1940s, the Roswell race track was used as an automobile speedway.

Since the 1990s, the main locations of the lights have been on and around the Medell√≠n River and La Playa Avenue, although the event has expanded to include over one hundred other locations around the city. The event usually lasts from the beginning of December until the beginning of January, and the lights are designed and sponsored by Empresas P√∫blicas de Medell√≠n (EPM), the city's public utilities company. Because of its attraction to tourists, the event has gotten bigger each year, with a widening availability of energy resources and budgets, and increasing participation by local citizens. The ceremony traditionally began on 7 December, the Day of the Little Candles and the unofficial start to the Christmas season in Colombia. However, in recent years the lighting has begun sooner to accommodate the increase in tourism. All recreational parks and all the museums have free entry for children under 12 years old, and the Museum of Antioquia admission is free for everyone during this season. In the month of December 2012, the Lighting of Medellin was selected among the top ten cities to view holiday lights by the National Geographic website. Route Christmas lights on La Playa Avenue in 2011. The starting point of the Lighting is on La Playa Avenue, and its main attraction is on the Medell√≠n River. The main route of lighting starts at the Pablo Tobon Uribe Theater, down La Playa to Bol√≠var Park. Since 2013, a projector there plays videos on the fa√ßade of the Metropolitan Cathedral of Medell√≠n. The route then takes Carabobo Street to San Juan Street, then by that road to the Medellin River, and parallel the river, from the San Juan Bridge to the Guayaquil Bridge. Overall, the Lighting can be viewed from over 100 parks, as well as several other avenues and streets in Medell√≠n. Other notable areas with lights include Botero Park, Nutibara Hill, 70th Street, 80th Street, 33rd Avenue and Las Palmas Road. History The first public lighting for Christmas in Medell√≠n took place in 1851 at Plaza Mayor, which today is the location of a large convention center. The tradition of Christmas lighting in Medell√≠n began again in 1955, when Empresas P√∫blicas de Medell√≠n consolidated as a public utilities company. For the holiday season, part of the city was modestly adorned with special lights jointly contributed by EPM, the government, and the press. Local citizens would go out at 6 p.m. to walk along La Playa Avenue and look at the lights. By 1967, EPM assumed the role as the creative team for the city's lights each year, and therefore decided their design, installation, and costs. Over time, these lighting systems were broadening in scope and becoming one of the biggest tourist attractions in Medellin in the year-end season. EPM has offered its flagship lights every year since then, only modified in 1992, when the Colombian energy crisis forced EPM to suspend the lighting for that year. Mi Rio Project Pueblito Paisa Church on Nutibara Hill in 2006. In the 1990s, the Medell√≠n government endorsed a strategy of sustainable development for the city, which included a project called Mi R√≠o (My River) that sought to clean up the Medell√≠n River. As part of this plan, citizens living near the river were encouraged to pick the themes for the seasonal Christmas lights that would adorn the city and the river itself. Over time, the avenues along the Medell√≠n River became one of the main points to view the lighting as a result of these plans. 2006-12 Seasons The official slogan for the lights in 2006 was \\"Colombia is light\\". EPM invested in 12.5 million lights that year. In December 2008, EPM used 14.5 million multicolored lights, in addition to rope lights, light projectors, and screens for the holiday design throughout the city, which was estimated to have cost 6,200 million pesos (approx $2.6 million). That year's lighting employed approximately 1,000 people for the season, which lasted from 1 December to 15 January. For the 2009 season, the Christmas festival began on 5 December. That year, the EPM Intelligent Building debuted a new outdoor fountain. For the Christmas season, the fountain was adorned with sophisticated multimedia effects for color, water movement, and sound. In 2011, the lighting began on 3 December, four days earlier than usual, to accommodate tourism. 2013 Season For the 2013 Christmas season, the city planned to hang over 27 million lights and 472 miles of rope lights in 90 points. The slogan for this year was \\"Our Christmas\\" and its theme was the history and traditions of Antioquia. The manager of EPM, Federico Restrepo said that the lights would \\"highlight Christmas customs and traditions\\" of the communes and districts. The lighting began on 1 December at 6 p.m. and ended on 6 January. A 10-minute video was played on the fa√ßade of the Metropolitan Cathedral of Medell√≠n in Bol√≠var Park. In five segments, the video played the history of the construction of the cathedral, the evolution of transportation in Medellin, as well as its art, culture, architecture, wealth of natural resources, and major Christmas attractions. Another show was presented on the western side of the EPM Intelligent Building, called \\"The Wonders of Colombia\\". This 12-minute show was narrated by three characters known as Gotica, Copet√≥n and Linda Calle. The Lighting along the river in 2010. On the corner of Oriental Avenue and La Playa, a \\"House on the Corner\\" was created out of a metal frame, mesh, paper and LED rope lights. The construction represents the typical architectural style of Antioquian houses. The eastern side of the Guayaquil Bridge featured an interactive water screen that used properties of water conductivity for people to make drawings and figures using sprays, sponges, brushes, pencils or their own hands with the water. The Alumbrado was visited by approximately 4 million people that year, with approximately 60,000 visitors daily. 2014 Season This was the first year that EPM wanted to create a story, and not just a theme, for the Lighting. They asked citizens to submit their ideas for the story's central theme. EPM received 1,555 responses, which predominately featured three concepts: fairy tales, magic worlds, and personal values that can create an equal and peaceful society. EPM chose \\"values\\" as the theme and the slogan for this year's Alumbrado is \\"Values illuminate Christmas\\". The story they created centers on a girl named Paloma who travels on a boat on the river of peace (the Medell√≠n River) and makes stops along the way on various ports to learn about different human values. The 2014 celebration began on 29 November at 7:00 p.m. at the fountain near EPM's Smart Building. Visitors can view the lights from 6 p.m. to 1 a.m. Juan Fernando Sierra is this year's design coordinator. The lighting will have over 30 million LED lights, 800 kilometers of rope lights, 11 tons of metallic decorative paper, and 170 tons of ironwork, among other things. The total cost was about $9 million (21 billion pesos). The festival ran until 12 January 2015.

The recording was produced by George Harrison and its release marked the first in a series of occasional collaborations between the two musicians that lasted until the Chants of India album in 1997. Shankar recorded the EP in Los Angeles, to help raise international awareness of the plight faced by refugees of the Bangladesh Liberation War, in advance of his and Harrison's Concert for Bangladesh shows at Madison Square Garden, New York. Side one of the disc consists of two vocal compositions sung in Bengali, of which the title track was a message of unity to the newly independent nation, formerly known as East Pakistan. The third selection is a duet by Shankar and sarodya Ali Akbar Khan, supported by Alla Rakha on tabla, a performance that presaged their opening set at the Concert for Bangladesh. Joi Bangla was the first of four Shankar-related releases on the Beatles' Apple label, closely followed by the Raga soundtrack album. The EP has been out of print since soon after its release. Of the three tracks, only \\"Oh Bhaugowan\\" has been reissued ‚Äì on the Harrison-compiled Ravi Shankar: In Celebration box set (1996). Background A Bengali by birth, Ravi Shankar was deeply concerned by the plight of the cyclone- and war-ravaged people of East Pakistan during the first six months of 1971.The Editors of Roling Stone, p. 123. To help raise funds to try to alleviate the misery, he turned to his friend George Harrison,Raghavan, pp. 146‚Äì47. then riding a wave of popularity with the success of his first post-Beatles solo album, All Things Must Pass.Lavezzoli, pp. 187, 189.Neal Alpert, \\"George Harrison's Concert for Bangladesh\\", Gadfly Online, 3 December 2001 (retrieved 24 August 2014). Within six weeks, Madison Square Garden in New York was booked for two UNICEF shows on Sunday, 1 August; Western stars such as Eric Clapton, Bob Dylan, Ringo Starr and Leon Russell had pledged to be there; and Harrison's purpose-made single \\"Bangla Desh\\" was receiving airplay on US radio. Shankar later described it as a \\"miracle\\", the speed at which Harrison had made things happen.Olivia Harrison, p. 286. According to Shankar, speaking in London later in August, Harrison wrote \\"Bangla Desh\\" within three hours of their conversation about the refugee crisis. Shankar said he then wrote \\"Joi Bangla\\" as an improvisation on Harrison's melody.Chris Welch, \\"Shankar ... Spreading Peace and Music\\", Melody Maker, 14 August 1971, pp. 1, 11. Recording With the Apple documentary film Raga in post production and awaiting release, the Beatles' record label would also be issuing a Shankar benefit disc,Spizer, p. 341. a three-track EP.Lavezzoli, pp. 187, 190. For the sessions in mid July,Castleman & Podrazik, p. 103. most likely held at the Record Plant West like Harrison's,Madinger & Easter, p. 434. Shankar wrote a new composition, \\"Joi Bangla\\", which became the EP's title track. As with the Raga soundtrack album, Joi Bangla was produced by Harrison.Rodriguez, p. 236. \\"Joy Bangla\\", the slogan and war cry of the Bangladesh independence movement, written in Bengali alphabet Harrison's single had targeted listeners in the West with its call to \\"Relieve the people of Bangla Desh\\".Lavezzoli, p. 189. Shankar instead addressed the victims themselves, as his \\"distant relatives\\" and his guru's family were among the tens of thousands pouring into neighbouring India.Clayson, p. 308. The lyrics are sung in Bengali, Shankar's first language.Shankar, pp. 70, 77. Apple's picture sleeve provided an English translation, in which Shankar calls on Bangladeshis to \\"be triumphant\\", and for unity \\"beyond conscience or creed\\". The song title translates as \\"Victory to Bangladesh\\" and was taken from \\"Joy Bangla\\", the slogan adopted by the Bangladesh Forces (Mukti Bahini) during the war. In India at this time, \\"Joi Bangla\\" was a form of greeting between people sympathetic to Bangladesh's struggle for independence.Salil Tripathi, \\"Bangladesh\\", Drik.net, 2012 (archived version retrieved 3 September 2020). The EP's other vocal performance was \\"O Bhaugowan\\". In this song, Shankar provided what author Peter Lavezzoli describes as \\"a prayer for help\\",Lavezzoli, p. 190. asking: \\"O God, where have you gone / ... Sickness, cyclones, floods / Are upon us / Do you not care for us?\\" The final selection, \\"Raga Mishra Jhinjhoti\\", was a sitar and sarod jugalbandi (duet) in dadra tal, featuring Shankar and Ali Akbar Khan, with Alla Rakha on tabla.Castleman & Podrazik, p. 205. According to a note on the picture sleeve, the piece was inspired by the folk melodies of Bengal.Sleeve credits, Joi Bangla EP (Apple Records, 1971; produced by George Harrison). Release Apple Records issued the Joi Bangla EP in America on 9 August (as Apple 1838) ‚àí eight days after the Concert for Bangladesh shows ‚àí and on 27 August in Britain (Apple 37). In an interview with Rolling Stone on 3 August, Shankar expressed relief that months of personal anguish over the crisis had come to an end, saying, \\"With George's single, 'Bangla Desh', my single, the film that has been made of the concert, the [live] album coming out and whatever the gate monies from this concert ... it will all add up to a substantial amount.\\" He added that the funds raised would be minuscule relative to the size of the problem, but young people had been galvanised, and: \\"It is like trying to ignite ‚Äì to pass on the responsibilities as much as possible to everyone else. I think this aim has been achieved.\\" The songs on side one of the record were credited to \\"Ravi Shankar & Chorus\\", while side two's duet was credited to Shankar, Khan and Rakha. Khan's name also appeared on the picture sleeve's front cover, given equal billing as Shankar, while Rakha's appeared on the reverse. In The Spectator, Duncan Fallowell wrote of Shankar's gesture towards his homeland: > Ravi Shankar decided to make public his concern for the events in Bengal in > the only way which now makes sense, by supporting the Free Bengal movement > against the horrifying brutality of their military overlords from West > Pakistan ... With the same destination in view, Apple have released George > Harrison's record, Bangla Desh, and one also from Mr Shankar, Joi Bangla, at > 49 pence each, both worth it. The first is George at his most sinuous and > plaintive ... the second has the kind of high spirits encountered in > musicals shown at the Godeon [Cinema], Southall (these musicals by the way, > produced in prodigious quantities, are ‚Äì let me warn you ‚Äì tragically > addictive).Duncan Fallowell, \\"More Than Polo\\", The Spectator, 10 September > 1971, p. 382/22 (retrieved 8 November 2013). Record World recognised Shankar as Bengal's \\"foremost musician\\" whose new release coincided with \\"the eyes of the world focused on the tragedy of Bangla Desh\\".\\"Single Product\\", Record World, 21 August 1971, p. 12. Cash Box described \\"Joi Bangla\\" as \\"Intriguing raga sparkling with the George Harrison production touch\\". The reviewer said that the chorus singing added a degree of commercial appeal and the song was sure to gain extensive play on FM and underground radio.\\"Cash Box Singles Reviews\\", Cash Box, 21 August 1971, p. 14. In January 1972, Billboard listed \\"Joi Bangla\\" and \\"Oh Bhaugowan\\" together at number 4 in a chart compiled by Poland's Music Clubs' Co-Ordination Council.\\"Hits of the World\\", Billboard, 8 January 1972, p. 39 (retrieved 6 August 2016). Legacy Shankar and Harrison's efforts to raise awareness of the refugees' plight ensured that the crisis became a central issue in the West.Raghavan, p. 142. In mid August 1971, Shankar told Melody Maker that Indian music was now more popular than ever before in the West, adding that he, Rakha and their accompanists might perform some of the songs at his upcoming concert at the Royal Albert Hall in London. Following the example set by Shankar and Harrison's topical records, Allen Ginsberg wrote the poem \\"September on Jessore Road\\", after visiting the area, and Joan Baez wrote \\"Song of Bangladesh\\", released in 1972.Fahmim Ferdous, \\"When the World Sang for Bangladesh\\", The Daily Star, 16 December 2015 (retrieved 3 September 2020).Raghavan, pp. 146‚Äì47. Joi Bangla was the only extended-play release by an Apple Records artist (discounting promotional EPs, where two or more acts from the Apple roster were combined). Among latter-day reviewers, author Alan Clayson considers the title track \\"more melodiously uplifting than any other of George [Harrison]'s Indo-pop productions\\".Clayson, p. 315. Writing on the occasion of the Concert for Bangladesh film's DVD release in 2005, Francis C. Assisi, a reviewer for The Canadian India Times in the early 1970s, recalled the juxtaposition of reading about the \\"holocaust\\" caused by the Bangladesh Liberation War and the regional cyclone, and seeing his two-year-old son \\"joyfully revelling in the recently released Ravi Shankar‚ÄìAli Akbar Khan duet 'Joi Bangla'\\".Francis C. Assisi, \\"After 34 years, The Concert for Bangladesh Just Keeps on Giving\\", INDOlink.com, 28 October 2005 (archived version retrieved 3 September 2020). In his book on Harrison's musical career, Simon Leng describes \\"Raga Mishra Jhinjhoti\\" as \\"stirring ... [a] masterful performance\\" and similarly highlights \\"Oh Bhaugowan\\" for its \\"impassioned and moving appeal for divine assistance\\".Leng, p. 112. The songs on Joi Bangla received little in the way of repackaging after their original 1971 release. \\"Oh Bhaugowan\\" was included on the In Celebration box set (1996),World Music: The Rough Guide, p. 116. appearing on disc four, which contains, in the words of AllMusic critic Bruce Eder, \\"the lion's share of the 1970s vintage material recorded under the auspices of Harrison, as well as capturing Shankar working in a vocal music mode (including his own vocals, which are astonishingly beautiful and affecting)\\".Bruce Eder, \\"Ravi Shankar Shankar: In Celebration\\", AllMusic (retrieved 15 February 2012).

Kennedy, who had worked at the Kansas State School for the Deaf, was the director of the school. He and his wife had children who attended the school. William Jackson Palmer donated land to build a permanent school on Knob Hill, east of Colorado Springs. In 2014, there are 500 students across the state. Union Printers Home The Childs-Drexel Home for Union Printers was dedicated on May 12, 1892. It was run by the International Typographical Union to take care of ill and elderly patients. The home was bought by Heart Living Centers in 2014. Tesla Experimental Station The inventor Nikola Tesla's wireless power experimental station was located on Knob Hill at a site near the current Kiowa and Foote Streets, between the Colorado School for the Deaf and Blind and the Union Printers' Home. It was built and operated in 1899 and was torn down in 1904. A street car came to Knob Hill, at that time at the edge of the prairie. St. Francis Hospital The St. Francis Hospital was built on Institute Heights at the east end of Pike's Peak Avenue, near the Knob Hill street car line.

The advection of the scalar Œ¶ used to define flow depends on the magnitude and direction of the local velocity field. In general, however the velocity field is not known. These algorithms are hence employed to obtain the solution. The standard Euler equations (fluid dynamics) can be given by: The continuity equation : \\\\frac{\\\\partial \\\\rho u }{\\\\partial x} + \\\\frac{\\\\partial \\\\rho v }{\\\\partial y} = 0 The momentum equations Obtained by substituting Œ¶ with standard directional vectors of the velocity field u, v, and w. : \\\\frac{\\\\partial \\\\rho u u }{\\\\partial x} + \\\\frac{\\\\partial \\\\rho vu }{\\\\partial y} = \\\\frac{\\\\partial \\\\frac{ u \\\\partial u} { \\\\partial x}}{\\\\partial x} + \\\\frac{\\\\partial \\\\frac{ u \\\\partial u} { \\\\partial y}}{\\\\partial y} - \\\\frac{\\\\partial p}{\\\\partial x} + S_u : \\\\frac{\\\\partial \\\\rho u v }{\\\\partial x} + \\\\frac{\\\\partial \\\\rho vv }{\\\\partial y} = \\\\frac{\\\\partial \\\\frac{ u \\\\partial v} { \\\\partial x}}{\\\\partial x} + \\\\frac{\\\\partial \\\\frac{ u \\\\partial v} { \\\\partial y}}{\\\\partial y} - \\\\frac{\\\\partial p}{\\\\partial y} + S_v where \\\\rho is the density, u, v, are the x- and y-directional components of velocity, p is the pressure field and Su,v are the source terms. These equations are however hard to solve due to quasilinearity in the momentum equations and interdependence of the pressure term in all three equations. Also, for a general purpose flow equation, the pressure field is also unknown and is to be solved for as well. If the flow field is compressible, the above equations act as the standard temperature and density equations and pressure can be found as it is a function of them both. If, however the flow is in-compressible, the pressure is independent of density. Hence, coupling is necessary to induce a constraint on the solution. The resulting fields will then satisfy the continuity equations. Both these issues are solved via the application of the SIMPLE Algorithm and its derivatives. For general purpose and definition of these algorithms, a Staggered CFD Grid shall be used. It ensures the presence of very real non-zero pressure gradient across the nodes in any condition, even in the case of a checkered grid. The staggering also ensures realistic behaviors of the descretized momentum equations for spatially oscillating pressures. Also, the direction of the velocity vectors are exact.  The staggered grid  Standard staggered grid in computational fluid dynamics The above shows a standard grid used to solve staggered applications. The east, west, north and south notations are used. They direct the vector fields. The u component of velocity is stored in the e and w directions and the v component in the n and s directions. If 3-D fields are to applied, t and b can be used. These are basically vector control volumes different from the scalar pressure control volumes and different from each other. The pressure gradient equations take a different form: : \\\\frac {\\\\partial p}{\\\\partial x} = \\\\frac{ P_p - P_w} { \\\\partial x_u} in the x-direction : \\\\frac {\\\\partial p}{\\\\partial y} = \\\\frac{ P_p - P_s} { \\\\partial y_v} in the y-direction Furthermore, the momentum equations now take the form: : a_i,_J u_i,_J = \\\\sum a_nb u_nb - \\\\Delta V_u \\\\frac {P_I,_J - P_{I-1},_J}{\\\\partial x_u} + S \\\\Delta V_u The summation covers all nodes and volumes in the immediate vicinity of the selected node. Their values are shown in the next figure. Refined segregated Grid Following this, The algorithms can be applied to get the solutions for the basic staggered grid equations.  SIMPLE algorithm  The acronym stands for Semi- Implicit method for pressure-linked equations. It is essentially a guess and correct procedure for the calculation of the staggered grid pressure field. These have been illustrated using a two dimensional steady flow. Flow chart for SIMPLE Algorithm Step 1 :- A pressure field p* is guessed. Step 2 :- The Discretized momentum equations are solved using the value of p* to get velocity components u* and v*. Step 3:- Define the correction pressure as p' such that p = p* + p' Step 4:- Similarly define the correction values for the velocities as u' and v' such that u = u* + u' and v = v*+ v' Step 5:- Substitute the correct pressure field p in the momentum equations to obtain the correct velocity field (u,v). Step 6 :- Subtract equations obtained in step 5 from those in step 1. We should get the equations in term of the correction terms (u‚Ä≤ and v‚Ä≤) Here we apply an assumption that \\\\sum a_{nb} u'_{nb} and \\\\sum a_{nb} v'_{nb} are 0 . This is the major assumption in the SIMPLE Algorithm. This should then allow us to obtain the correction terms u' and v' of the Momentum Equations. We can similarly find the correction terms for all nodes. Step 7 :- Solve the continuity equation for the entire control volume. i.e. n,s,e,w nodes surrounding each node of the staggered grid, using the density terms. Step 8 :- Substitute the corrected velocity equations in the continuity equations and separate the term containing the correction pressure p'. This represents the equation for pressure correction p'. Step 9 :- Solve the thus obtained equation to get the correction term and get the correct pressure. Use the new correct pressure to reiterate the entire process till a convergence is obtained. Sometimes, the solution might not converge due to a large difference in the guessed field and correct pressure field. The new p= p* + Œ±p'. Œ± is kept between 0 and 1 to ensure convergence. The choice of Œ± decides the cost effectiveness of the solution.  SIMPLER algorithm  Flow chart for the SIMPLER Algorithm The acronym for SIMPLE Revised, this algorithm is an improved version of the SIMPLE algorithm. Here the Discretised continuity equation is used to derive the correct intermediate pressure field instead of the correction pressure. Refer to flow chart. SIMPLEC algorithm The SIMPLE Consistent Algorithm is almost same as the SIMPLE Algorithm, except that the manipulations are changed to ensure lesser omissions.

Shult and Arthur Yanushka in 1980.Shult, Ernest; Yanushka, Arthur. \\"Near n-gons and line systems\\". Shult and Yanushka showed the connection between the so-called tetrahedrally closed line-systems in Euclidean spaces and a class of point-line geometries which they called near polygons. These structures generalise the notion of generalized polygon as every generalized 2n-gon is a near 2n-gon of a particular kind. Near polygons were extensively studied and connection between them and dual polar spaces Cameron, Peter J. \\"Dual polar spaces\\". was shown in 1980s and early 1990s. Some sporadic simple groups, for example the Hall-Janko group and the Mathieu groups, act as automorphism groups of near polygons.  Definition  A near 2d-gon is an incidence structure (P,L,I), where P is the set of points, L is the set of lines and I\\\\subseteq P\\\\times L is the incidence relation, such that: * The maximum distance between two points (the so-called diameter) is d. * For every point x and every line L there exists a unique point on L which is nearest to x. Note that the distance are measured in the collinearity graph of points, i.e., the graph formed by taking points as vertices and joining a pair of vertices if they are incident with a common line. We can also give an alternate graph theoretic definition, a near 2d-gon is a connected graph of finite diameter d with the property that for every vertex x and every maximal clique M there exists a unique vertex x' in M nearest to x. The maximal cliques of such a graph correspond to the lines in the incidence structure definition. A near 0-gon (d = 0) is a single point while a near 2-gon (d = 1) is just a single line, i.e., a complete graph. A near quadrangle (d = 2) is same as a (possibly degenerate) generalized quadrangle. In fact, it can be shown that every generalized 2d-gon is a near 2d-gon that satisfies the following two additional conditions: * Every point is incident with at least two lines. * For every two points x, y at distance i < d, there exists a unique neighbour of y at distance i ‚àí 1 from x. A near polygon is called dense if every line is incident with at least three points and if every two points at distance two have at least two common neighbours. It is said to have order (s, t) if every line is incident with precisely s + 1 points and every point is incident with precisely t + 1 lines. Dense near polygons have a rich theory and several classes of them (like the slim dense near polygons) have been completely classified.De Bruyn, Bart. Near Polygons  Examples  * All connected bipartite graphs are near polygons. In fact, any near polygon that has precisely two points per line must be a connected bipartite graph. * All finite generalized polygons except the projective planes. * All dual polar spaces. * The Hall‚ÄìJanko near octagon, also known as the Cohen-Tits near octagonhttp://www.win.tue.nl/~aeb/graphs/HJ315.html associated with the Hall‚ÄìJanko group. It can be constructed by choosing the conjugacy class of 315 central involutions of the Hall-Janko group as points and lines as three element subsets {x, y, xy} whenever x and y commute. * The M24 near hexagon related to the Mathieu group M24 and the extended binary Golay code. It is constructed by taking the 759 octads (blocks) in the Witt design S(5, 8, 24) corresponding to the Golay code as points and a triple of three pairwise disjoint octads as lines.https://www.win.tue.nl/~aeb/2WF02/Witt.pdf * Take the partitions of {1, 2, ..., 2n + 2} into n + 1 2-subsets as points and the partitions into n ‚àí 1 2-subsets and one 4-subset as lines. A point is incident to a line if as a partition it is a refinement of the line. This gives us a near 2n-gon with three points on each line, usually denoted Hn. Its full automorphism group is the symmetric group S2n+2.  Regular near polygons  A finite near 2d-gon S is called regular if it has an order (s,t) and if there exist constants t_i, i \\\\in {1,\\\\ldots,d}, such that for every two points x and y at distance i, there are precisely t_i + 1 lines through y containing a (necessarily unique) point at distance i - 1 from x. It turns out that regular near 2d-gons are precisely those near 2d-gons whose point graph (also known as a collinearity graph) is a distance-regular graph. A generalized 2d-gon of order (s, t) is a regular near 2d-gon with parameters t_1 = 0, t_2 = 0, \\\\ldots, t_d = t  See also  * Finite geometry * Polar space * Partial linear space * Association scheme * Hall‚ÄìJanko graph  Notes  References  *. *. *. *. *. *. * . * . *.

The battle ended with the complete destruction of an Italian flotilla of small minesweepers and auxiliary vessels evacuating Tripoli. Background The British Royal Naval destroyers HMS Kelvin and HMS Javelin were patrolling the area off Zuwarah, Libya. Part of a task force, their mission was to cut off the escape route of the last Italian ships fleeing from Tripoli, which would be conquered by Allied troops on 23 January 1943. Kelvin and HMS Nubian had forced the Italian torpedo boat Perseo to retire damaged and then sunk the 4,537 ton D'Annunzio, a merchant ship fleeing from Tripoli, on 15 January 1943. On the night of 19/20 January 1943 Javelin's Type 271 radar detected a number of ships heading directly towards the Tunisian coast, coming from Tripoli. It was the Tripoli minesweeping flotilla, which had been ordered to leave the city and evacuate to Tunisia and then to Italy to avoid capture. The flotilla, under the command of Lieutenant Giuseppe Di Bartolo, was made up of four small minesweeping tugs (RD 31, RD 36, RD 37 and RD 39, of which RD 36 and 37 were crewed with Italian Guardia di Finanza personnel); the trawler Scorfano (the largest ship in the convoy); the small tanker Irma; the auxiliary minesweepers DM 12 Guglielmo Marconi (a requisitioned brigantine); R 26 Angelo Musco and R 224 Cinzia (two former fishing vessels); the auxiliary patrol vessel V 66 Astrea (a motor sailing vessel); and the pump boat S. Barbara (towed by the Scorfano). Battle Javelin and Kelvin moved to an area of interception and sent star shells into the air, illuminating the lead ships. Realizing this was a group of Italian vessels (mistaken for a convoy), the British opened fire and the battle commenced. The Italians, under heavy fire, were able neither to fight back effectively (the RD minesweepers being armed with a 76 mm gun and two 6,5 mm each, while the other ships were only equipped with machine guns) nor to escape (having lower speed than the destroyers). RD 36, the flagship of the flotilla leader, tried to fight back to help the retreat of the other ships, but was soon sunk with all hands (the ship and her crew were awarded the Gold Medal of Military Valour for the action against overwhelming odds). The other vessels, fleeing towards the coast in the attempt to allow their crews to escape, were pursued, picked up one by one and destroyed. RD 37 and Scorfano were sunk with no survivors; Marconi was set afire but allowed all of her crew to escape before to sink, and the Irma was finished off with a torpedo. By the morning of 20 January, the flotilla had been completely annihilated. Kelvin had expended 300 rounds of her 4.7 inch guns and Javelin 500 rounds.Langtree, p. 157 Javelin and Kelvin quickly retreated to Malta, where they arrived safely the next day. 180 men were killed on the Italian side, while the survivors either swam to the shore or were picked up by Italian vessels the next day.

Biography Aguirre was the son of the militia captain Carlos Aguirre Ponce de Solis and Teresa Carbo Cerezo, both from Guayaquil. He studied at the San Luis Seminary College in Quito, where he lived for thirty years (almost half of his life). In 1758 he entered the Society of Jesus. Aguirre taught in Quito at the San Gregorio Magno University until the Jesuits were expelled from Spanish America in 1767. On August 20 of that year he left South America from Guayaquil bound for Faenza, Italy, where the Jesuits of Quito had taken refuge. Once in Italy, Aguirre was the superior of the Jesuit convent school in Ravenna and rector of the college in Ferrara. After the Order of the Jesuits was terminated by Pope Clement XIV in 1773, he settled in Rome under the papacy of Pope Pius VI. He was a friend of the bishop of Tivoli, Monsignor Gregorio Bamaba Chiaramonti, future Pope Pius VII. Aguirre wrote poems of varying topics, including religious, moral, and love poems.

Act III/Lear continue to own the two Rob Reiner directed films it produced, Stand By Me and The Princess Bride. Act III/Lear continues to hold an interest in Village Roadshow Pictures/Village Roadshow Entertainment. Village Roadshow Pictures Through a group led by Act III Communications, in January 2006, Norman Lear and his partner Hal Gaba purchased 50% of Village Roadshow Pictures (VRP), the Los Angeles-based, U.S. film production arm of Village Roadshow Limited, one of Australia‚Äôs leading entertainment and media companies. Their entity, Crescent Film Group included longtime associate Michael Lambert through Lambert Media Group and Clarity Partners as investors.Lambert Media Group Overview PDF Crescent invested $115 million for the interest in VRP. The Australian parent, Village Roadshow Limited (VRL) also operates movie theaters; film production and distribution in Australia; TVand Video distribution; radio stations; and theme parks including \\"Warner Movie World.\\" VRP co-produces and/or co-finances 6-8 movies per year. Historically a long-term partner with Warner Brothers, VRP moved its distribution to Sony Pictures in 2014. VRP's library includes films such as The Great Gatsby, Winter's Tale, The Lego Movie, the Matrix trilogy, Miss Congeniality, Training Day, Ocean‚Äôs Eleven and its sequels, Charlie and the Chocolate Factory, and others. This interest has been diluted with subsequent expansion and re-capitalizations of VRP but remains a significant interest for Act III. Village Roadshow Pictures used the $115 million invested by Crescent to repay an inter-company loan of $100 million owed to its parent company, as well as pay a $15 million dividend to the existing VRP shareholders and management. Variety July 27, 2005 Concord Music Group Norman Lear is also chairman emeritus of the Concord Music Group (aka Concord Records) one of the world‚Äôs largest independent record and music publishing companies, which was acquired by Lear and his associate Hal Gaba in 1999 and divested to Wood Creek Capital in 2013. Concord is one of the leading producers and distributors of classic and contemporary Jazz musicians and also owns the legendary Stax label which it acquired in 2004 as part of the Fantasy Records acquisition. Concord was acquired as a labor of love at the urging of Lear's long time associate and then-CEO of Act III Communications Hal Gaba. Gaba was CEO of Act III from late 1990, when he succeeded Tom McGrath, until his death in 2009. Gaba had long dreamed of owning a record company and in 1999 he developed the Concorde opportunity. The Concord Music Group had/has an extensive roster of household name artists that includes one of Gaba‚Äôs favorite singers, who was also a personal friend - Frank Sinatra (Gaba produced a live tribute show regarding Frank Sinatra that included marrying archival film footage with live performances called Sinatra, His Voice, His World that played Radio City Music Hall). Other artists on Concord's labels include Ray Charles, Ella Fitzgerald, Thelonious Monk, Chick Corea, John Coltrane, Miles Davis, Sergio Mendes and Creedence Clearwater Revival. Concord Records started a relationship with Starbucks in 2003 that reached a high point with the release of Genius Loves Company, Ray Charles‚Äô last recording. The album went on to win 8 Grammy Awards, including Album of the Year. In early 2007, Concord and Starbucks launched a joint venture record label - Hear Music. With guaranteed distribution at thousands of Starbucks store, the label attracted Paul McCartney who left EMI for the new label. James Taylor, John Mellencamp and Joni Mitchell all recorded for Hear Music before the partnership was terminated by Starbucks which was reacting to the general decline in physical sales of recorded music that made the label unprofitable.\\"Starbucks Refines Its Entertainment Strategy\\" News.starbucks.com Village Roadshow Entertainment Group In 2008, Concord Music Group merged into Village Roadshow Pictures to form Village Roadshow Entertainment Group (VREG).

In January 1989, Tractebel S.A., a large Belgian utility company with interests in Cable TV in Europe acquired a 20% equity stake in Act III Communications for $30 million, placing a value on the start-up venture's equity of $150 million. Tractebel was headed by Baron Philippe Bodson who oversaw the formation of Tractebell from the merger of Tractionel and Electrobel. Soci√©t√© G√©n√©rale de Belgique (SGB) holds 50.3%of Tractebel's stock. SGB, Belgium's largest holding company, is in turn controlled by France's Suez-Lyonnaise, the holding giant formed by the merger of Compagnie de Suez and Lyonnaise des Eaux in early 1997. Tractebel sold its shares back to Act III and related parties in 1991.

She was used to carry various cargoes (mainly grain) until 1952, when a diesel engine was fitted, after which she was used in various Thames Sailing Barge matches, winning several. She was a museum ship for a time, and was restored in 2010 to offer charter trips on the River Medway. Her winter moorings are at Lower Halstow, where she opens during the weekend as a tearoom. History The Thames sailing barge Edith May was built for her original owners, William Barrett of 153 Mornington Road, Leytonstone, Essex and her first skipper was Captain Howard. She was then sold to Alfred Sully (also known as G.F. Sully based in London), who managed the barge from just after the First World War. They owned many Thames sailing barges at that time, with Edith May the smallest barge. The barge continued in the ownership of Sully‚Äôs throughout her working life, carrying cereal products, wheat, barley etc. between East Anglia and London. Her largest cargo was 133 tons of wheat (from Manitoba, Canada), but more typically she would carry around 120 tons. In 1952 an auxiliary engine was fitted (a Ford diesel engine of 120 hp). In 1953, she won the Thames Barge Sailing match under the skippership of Chubb Horlock. It was believed to be the Coronation Match of that year. In September 1957, she was converted into a motor barge at Colchester. Then Vernon Harvey bought the barge from trade and she was re-rigged with the gear from the famous racing barge, Veronica when her career ended in 1963. Regarded as a latter day racing Queen, the Edith May dominated the Sailing Barge Matches of the 1960s, 1970s and early 1980s and to this day her reputation is still revered amongst bargemen. After 1961, she was re-rigged by Jack Spitty (an Essex-born barge skipper) for the owner. In January 1961, she operated as a motor barge, skippered by Bob Childs, a local bargeman. Bob in his retirement, wrote the book Rochester Barges. In 1971, Jack Spitty (aged 79) also won the Blackwater Sailing barge race.The best of the Saturday Book, John Hadfield,1981 She was sold and moved to Liverpool during the 1980s (to become a museum ship) before returning to Maldon in 1987.Sea Breezes Publications August 2011. To operate as a charter barge. She sat in St Katharine Docks, London (while owned by Roger Angus), for several years and was not maintained very well. Then on 7 October 1999 she was bought by Geoff Gransden who moved her to Lower Halstow on the River Medway. Current usage Edith May coming toward Sun Pier Chatham In September 2009, a sail maker began measuring up for new sails. On 21 November 2009, she was open to the public for an exhibition of local artists (from the Medway area). She then opened to the public every weekend after that date. On January 2010, she was award a sustainability grant of ¬£1500 for her sails, which was made from the Strategic Development Fund of National Historic Ships. She held a launch party on Saturday 10 July 2010. In 2010, she attended the Rochester Sweeps and Charles Dickens Festivals. In 2011 she was featured in Yachting Monthly, under the title 'An Essex girl back in the groove'. In April 2012, she became the Flagship of the Year 2012 and awarded ¬£1,000 from the Strategic Development Fund of National Historic Ships UK. Martyn Heighton,(Director, National Historic Ships UK) was quoted In September 2012, the 82nd Thames Sailing Barge Match took place. Cambria won and Edith May came fifth behind Thalatta, Lady of the Lea and Pudge. The Edith May team were delighted to receive the Flagship award from National Historic Ships at their presentation ceremony aboard on Wednesday 24 October 2012. The Princess Royal handed out the certificate, complimenting the barge on a very busy season. In 2013 another Thames Barge Match took place. Edith May battled among nine other barges in various classes, coming second in the Champion staysail class. She sails from Rochester, Chatham, Queenborough and Lower Halstow (which is also her Winter mooring point). Since 2007, the Edith May has hosted a popular weekend tea-room. Media In 1966, Jack Spitty became the Skipper in several matches. Anglia Television produced a programme about Jack Spitty and his barge Edith May as part of the Bygones series. In April 2012, Edith May was selected for Avenue of Sail in the Queen‚Äôs Diamond Jubilee Pageant on 3 June 2012. According to Guinness World Records, this was the largest ever parade of boats, surpassing the previous record of 327 vessels. In 2016, Lower Halstow creek and the Barge is featured in the Wonder Woman film, pretending to be a location in Belgium.

As the variance of \\\\Theta is 0< \\\\Theta <1, the scheme to be used to calculate T_P depends on the value of the \\\\Theta  Different Schemes  1\\\\. Explicit Scheme in the explicit scheme the source term is linearised as b = S_u + {S_P}{T_P}^0 . We substitute \\\\theta = 0 to get the explicit discretisation i.e.:An Introduction to Computational Fluid Dynamics H. K. Versteeg and W Malalasekera Chapter 8 page 171 a_P T_P = a_w {T_w}^0 + a_e {T_e}^0 + \\\\left[ {a_P}^0 - \\\\left( a_w + a_e - S_P \\\\right)\\\\right] {T_P}^0 + S_u where a_P = {a_P}^0 . One thing worth noting is that the right side contains values at the old time step and hence the left side can be calculated by forward matching in time. The scheme is based on backward differencing and its Taylor series truncation error is first order with respect to time. All coefficients need to be positive. For constant k and uniform grid spacing, \\\\delta x_{PE} = \\\\delta x_{WP} = \\\\Delta x this condition may be written as \\\\rho c \\\\frac { \\\\Delta x } { \\\\Delta t } > \\\\frac {2K} { \\\\Delta x } This inequality sets a stringent condition on the maximum time step that can be used and represents a serious limitation on the scheme. It becomes very expensive to improve the spatial accuracy because the maximum possible time step needs to be reduced as the square of \\\\Delta x http://opencourses.emu.edu.tr/mod/resource/view.php?id=489 topic 7 2\\\\. Crank Nicholson scheme : the crank Nicholson scheme results from setting \\\\theta = \\\\frac {1}{2}. The discretised unsteady heat conduction equation becomes a_P T_P = a_E \\\\left[ \\\\frac {T_E + {T_E}^0} {2}\\\\right] + a_W \\\\left[ \\\\frac {T_W + {T_W}^0} {2}\\\\right] + \\\\left[ {a_P}^0 - \\\\frac {a_E} {2} - \\\\frac {a_W} {2}\\\\right] {T_P}^0 + b Where a_P = \\\\frac {a_W + a_E} {2} + {a_P}^0 - \\\\frac {S_P} {2} Since more than one unknown value of T at the new time level is present in equation the method is implicit and simultaneous equations for all node points need to be solved at each time step. Although schemes with \\\\frac {1}{2} < \\\\theta < 1 including the Crank-Nicolson scheme, are unconditionally stable for all values of the time step it is more important to ensure that all coefficients are positive for physically realistic and bounded results. This is the case if the coefficient of {T_P}^0 satisfies the following condition {a_P}^0 = \\\\left[ \\\\frac {a_E + a_W} {2} \\\\right] which leads to \\\\Delta t < \\\\rho c \\\\frac { \\\\Delta x^2} {K} the crank Nicholson is based on central differencing and hence is second order accurate in time. The overall accuracy of a computation depends also on the spatial differencing practice, so the Crank-Nicolson scheme is normally used in conjunction with spatial central differencing 3\\\\. Fully implicit Scheme when the value of —≤ is set to 1 we get the fully implicit scheme. The discretised equation is: http://opencourses.emu.edu.tr/course/view.php?id=27‚ü®=en topic 7 a_P T_P = a_W T_W + a_E T_E + {a_P}^0 {T_P}^0 + S_u a_P = {a_P}^0 + a_W + a_E - S_P Both sides of the equation contain temperatures at the new time step, and a system of algebraic equations must be solved at each time level. The time marching procedure starts with a given initial field of temperatures T^0 . The system of equations is solved after selecting time step \\\\Delta t . Next the solution T is assigned to T^0 and the procedure is repeated to progress the solution by a further time step. It can be seen that all coefficients are positive, which makes the implicit scheme unconditionally stable for any size of time step. Since the accuracy of the scheme is only first-order in time, small time steps are needed to ensure the accuracy of results. The implicit method is recommended for general purpose transient calculations because of its robustness and unconditional stability References Category:Computational fluid dynamics ","title":"Finite volume method for unsteady flow"},{"id":"41024389","text":"Climbing skin Ascent with skins, John Surr en route to Slide Peak, CA Climbing skins are strips that attach to the bottom of nordic, alpine touring or randonn√©e skis to help while ascending backcountry slopes. They are designed to be removed for skiing downhill. They are typically attached to the skis via a loop on the ski tip, a hook on the tail, and adhesive on the base of the skin. They are called skins because they resemble sealskin, from which the first ski skins were made. They are typically made from nylon or mohair or a combination thereof, and are designed to let the ski slide forward on snow but not backward. They are usually narrower than the ski to allow the ski edges to get a grip. Some ski resorts permit skinning.Cranmore Mountain Resort: Uphill Travel, accessed 18 July 2017Bolton Valley Uphill Policy, accessed 7 February 2020  History  Various ethnic groups living in the Arctic regions created a means of transportation across the ice and snow surfaces of their regions, with innovations such as the ski. Attuned to maximizing the use of their materials, one outcome of their innovation was the use of animal skins to gain traction in traveling. As these groups were nomadic, the technology of skis for transportation was integral to continual movement across the region, as well as in maximizing transportation speed while reducing energy expenditure.

Among his many adventures during this walk he petted a full-grown buffalo, kissed a fawn on the mouth, rode on the country's last pole-driven ferry, jumped off a cliff into a water-filled quarry, and participated in a world-record-setting skinny dip at a naturist resort.  Writing career  As a freelancer, Bill Glose has written hundreds of articles and essays for The Writer, The Sun (magazine), Southern Arts Journal, and numerous other publications. During the 1999 college football season he wrote for The Pigskin Post as their Big East correspondent. That same year, he began reviewing books for The Virginian-Pilot, which led to his position as a contributing editor at Virginia Living (March 2003-April 2020). In 2005, Glose became a feature writer for Super Lawyers magazine, interviewing and writing profiles about top national lawyers.Super Lawyers Articles Written by Bill Glose He has also worked as a technical writer for Newport News Shipbuilding and as a writing coach with Professional English, where he coached NASA scientists, business managers and students.

Jackie Mohan: ‚ÄúVirginia is in good hands as Glose's well-honed expertise with language and lyricism takes the reader on a journey across the state. While some poems ruminate on nature more generally, his poems are strongest when he describes the quirks and histories of specific locations, from Tangier Island to the James River to Norfolk, such as how Norfolk got its mermaids. His poems also tell the stories of the people he encountered along his way, from notable figures of times long gone, such as Capt. John Smith, to the lives of Virginians today.‚Äù Poets Alphin, Glose see Virginia through different eyes, The Virginian-Pilot, March 22, 2019. Lyn C. A. Gardner: ‚ÄúThis accomplished collection by a Hampton Roads poet touches both the horrors and wonders of human life, providing philosophical reflections about life and relationships and taking the time to understand and empathize with both strangers and family. Starting from his own encounters but reaching far beyond them, Bill Glose succeeds admirably at the difficult task of making the poet's specific, personal experience universal.‚ÄùReview of The Human Touch , Virginia Libraries Journal, Vol. 56, No. 3, Page 32.

Applications  Dazomet is a chemical used to kill pests that inhibit plant growth through gaseous degradation. Dazomet is used as a soil sterilant on a variety of sites such as golf courses, nurseries, turf sites, and potting soils. Dazomet is used for soil sterilization as an alternative to methyl bromide. Although less effective it is still used to kill pests because of its comparatively lower toxicity. Dazomet is applied to wet soil, which causes dazomet itself to decompose into a gaseous form, which is what actively controls pests. The decomposition of dazomet releases methyl isothiocyanate (MITC) a gas toxic to pests that would prevent or kill plant growth. Synthesis Dazomet is synthesized from carbon disulfide (CS2) and diluted methylamine (CH3NH2). After stirring for 1-2 hours, an oily substance is formed, which is the intermediate methylcarbamodithioic acid (HS2CNHCH3). Then, formaldehyde (CH2O) is added to the intermediate to form and precipitate out the dazomet .Cao, Y.; Lu, Y. Process for preparing dazomet dustless stable fine granules. CN1543787, Nov. 10, 2004.  Toxicology and safety  Dazomet is irritating to the eyes and its degradation product, MITC, is a dermal sensitizer. Dazomet is very toxic to aquatic organisms, and also acutely toxic to mammals. Exposure to dazomet can occur through several means; interaction with unincorporated granules, inhalation of it decomposition product, MITC, and/or water runoff. Mass spectrum The molecular ion peak of dazomet is at 162 m/z. There are two major fragment peaks, one at 89 m/z and one at 42 m/z. The fragment peak at 89 m/z represents the loss of MITC, which is the major, gaseous degrade of dazomet.NIST Chemistry WebBook. 2H-1,3,5-Thiadiazine-2-thione, tetrahydro-3,5-dimethyl-. http://webbook.nist.gov/ (accessed Oct. 5, 2014).

The bill would have whistleblowers first file a retaliation claim with the United States Department of Labor before going to federal court. The bill passed the United States Senate during the 113th United States Congress. Background The bill was written in response to a July 2011 report from the Government Accountability Office on whistleblowing and price fixing. Provisions of the bill This summary is based largely on the summary provided by the Congressional Research Service, a public domain source. The Criminal Antitrust Anti-Retaliation Act of 2013 would prohibit discharging or in any other manner discriminating against a whistleblower in terms and conditions of employment because: (1) the whistleblower provided information to the employer or the federal government concerning a violation of antitrust law or another criminal law committed in conjunction with a potential violation of antitrust law; or (2) the whistleblower participated in, or otherwise assisted, an investigation relating to such a violation. The bill would allow a whistleblower who alleges discharge or other discrimination to seek relief: (1) by filing a complaint with the Secretary of Labor; or (2) if the Secretary has not issued a final decision within 180 days of filing such complaint, to bring an action at law or equity. The bill would entitle a whistleblower who prevails in any such action to all relief necessary to make such whistleblower whole. Procedural history=Senate The Criminal Antitrust Anti-Retaliation Act of 2013 was introduced into the Senate on January 22, 2013 by Sen. Patrick J. Leahy (D, VT). It was referred to the United States Senate Committee on the Judiciary. On November 4, 2013, the Senate voted to pass the bill with unanimous consent. Debate and discussion The National Whistleblowers Center supported the bill and encouraged readers to write to their Senators about the bill. The executive director Stephen Kohn said that \\"this bill is a major step forward in plugging a loophole in the patchwork of whistleblower protection that currently exists.\\" See also *List of bills in the 113th United States Congress Notes/ReferencesExternal links *Library of Congress - Thomas S. 42 *beta.congress.gov S. 42 *GovTrack.us S. 42 *OpenCongress.org S. 42 *WashingtonWatch.com S. 42 Category:Proposed legislation of the 113th United States Congress Category:Whistleblower protection legislation Category:Whistleblowing in the United States ","title":"Criminal Antitrust Anti-Retaliation Act of 2013"},{"id":"41024645","text":"Daishowa-Marubeni International Ltd v Canada is a significant case of the Supreme Court of Canada concerning the application of Canadian income tax law, as well as the purposive interpretation of statutes. Background Daishowa‚ÄëMarubeni International Ltd., a company owned by Daishowa Paper Manufacturing and Marubeni Corporation, operated pulp mills in Peace River, Alberta and in Quesnel, British Columbia. Through separate subsidiaries in High Level, Alberta (\\"High Level\\") and Red Earth Creek, Alberta (\\"Brewster\\"), it carried on the business of harvesting logs and manufacturing finished timber. At the beginning of 1999, the subsidiaries were amalgamated into the parent company. High Level was sold later in 1999 to Tolko Industries Ltd., and Brewster in 2000 to Seehta Forest Products. Both transactions included the sale of timber licences, each of which is considered to be a \\"timber resource property\\" under the Income Tax Act (Canada). Under Alberta law, consent was granted for the transfer of such licences subject to the condition that the purchaser assume all obligations relating to the reforestation of the land covered by the licence. In filing its 1999 and 2000 tax returns Daishowa did not include the amounts relating to the assumption of such liabilities as part of the proceeds of disposition relating to the sale of such properties. The Minister of National Revenue asserted that it should have been part of such amount, relying on the definition set out in the Act at s. 248(1): The Minister accordingly reassessed, adding into the proceeds of disposition $11,000,000 in respect of High Level and $2,966,301 in respect of Brewster, based on the estimated cost in DMI's accounting records, and accordingly adjusted Daishowa's taxable income for the years in question. Daishowa appealed the reassessment to the Tax Court of Canada, contending that the fair market value of those liabilities was not determinable at the time of closing and thus should not be included. The courts below At the TCC, Miller J allowed DMI's appeal of the Minister's reassessment in part. He agreed with the Minister, observing: However, he held that it was not appropriate to add the entire estimated cost of the obligations to the proceeds, preferring to restrict the amount added back to the estimated cost that would take place within the 12 months following each sale, plus 20 percent of the estimated cost of the activities that would take place thereafter. The Federal Court of Appeal dismissed Daishowa's appeal, allowed the Minister's cross-appeal and set aside the Judge's decision. In his ruling, Nadon JA (as he then was) agreed with Miller J as to the whether assumption of liabilities formed part of consideration, but held that there was no basis for reducing the value in question: Mainville JA dissented, arguing that the reforestation obligations depressed the value of the timber resource properties, and thus resulted in a lower purchase price than would otherwise have been obtained for the sale.FCA, par. 130 Daishowa appealed the FCA ruling to the Supreme Court of Canada. At the SCC Appeal was allowed, and the matter was returned to the Minister for appropriate reassessment. In a unanimous ruling, Rothstein J dealt with two issues: #Are the reforestation liabilities to be included in the proceeds of disposition because the vendor is relieved of a liability or are they integral to and run with the forest tenures? #Does it make any difference that the parties agreed to a specific amount of the future reforestation liability? On the first issue, he held: :* Mainville J was correct in stating that the obligations much like needed repairs to property are a future cost embedded in the forest tenure that serves to depress the tenure's value at the time of sale.SCC, par. 29 :* as the cost of reforestation is not a distinct existing liability of the vendor, the assumption of such cost is thus excluded from proceeds of disposition independent of whether the cost is absolute or contingent.SCC, par. 40 :* the Minister's approach, which would have resulted in different values for the vendor's proceeds of disposition and the purchaser's adjusted cost base, is thus avoided, as \\"an interpretation of the Act that promotes symmetry and fairness through a harmonious taxation scheme is to be preferred over an interpretation which promotes neither value.\\"SCC, par. 43 On the second issue:SCC, par. 4446 :* the Minister and the lower courts were mistaken in relying on the company's accounting estimates as a basis for their reasoning :* any amount that the parties assigned to the reforestation obligations in the sale agreement was simply a factor in determining the fair market value of the forest tenures :* It is also irrelevant that Daishowa estimated the cost of future reforestation to compute its income for accounting purposes, as financial accounting and income tax calculation serve distinct purposes Impact In Daishowa, the SCC made a distinction between obligations that do not affect the value of assets (such as mortgages) and those that affect the value of property (such as the need for repairs). The assumption of the former would be included in the proceeds of disposition, while assumption of the latter would reduce the value (and therefore the purchase price) of the property. This suggests that the distinction can be made based on whether a liability can be described as being embedded in a specific property right or not, which causes the following questions to arise: :* would pension deficits or post-retirement benefit obligations affect the value of property rights such as workforce in place or goodwill? :* should an agreed estimate of such liabilities be included in proceeds of disposition to the vendor? :* should the assumption of such obligations be reflected as an addition to the cost of assets acquired by the purchaser, and does such an addition occur at the time of acquisition or when such expenses are actually incurred? During the SCC's hearing of the case, the Canadian Association of Petroleum Producers, acting as an intervener, submitted that statutory obligations to reclaim mined land may be so physically connected to the process of mining itself that the obligations cannot be separated from the property right. Rothstein J declared in obiter: While of considerable economic significance to Canadian resource industries, and praised by observers as reflecting commercial common sense, Daishowa also has great importance in assessing the SCC's \\"modern\\" approach to statutory interpretation. Although not as extensive in its use of the purposive approach as it was in Rizzo Shoes or in its earlier case of Stubart Investments Ltd. v. The Queen, it did employ a more restrained approach as seen in Copthorne Holdings Ltd. v. Canada where Rothstein J (in his decision there) observed that interpretation should not be based on \\"a value judgment of what is right or wrong nor with theories about what tax law ought to be or ought to do.\\" Further reading * * (comment on FCA decision) * References Category:Supreme Court of Canada cases Category:Taxation in Canada Category:2013 in Canadian case law Category:Taxation case law Category:Marubeni Category:Nippon Paper Industries ","title":"Daishowa-Marubeni International Ltd v Canada"},{"id":"41024658","text":"Hyuk, also spelled Hyok or Hyeok, is a single-syllable masculine Korean given name, as well as an element in some two-syllable Korean given names.

Background  Shankharikathi market is located in Alukdia village, which now falls under Kachua Upazila in Bagerhat District of Khulna Division. In 1971 it was within the Bagerhat sub-division of erstwhile greater Khulna district. During the Bangladesh Liberation War, Jamaat-e-Islami leader AKM Yusuf Ali formed the Razakar force at Khan Jahan Ali Road in Khulna with 96 Jamaat members. The Razakars had set up camp all over erstwhile greater Khulna, including the Daibagyahati camp in present-day Bagerhat District. In the middle of July a group of Razakars forcibly converted around 200 Hindus to Islam at the Shankharikathi market. The Hindus were given Islamic names and forced to consume beef, an act considered a sacrilege for Hindus.  Killings  On 3 November, the Mukti Bahini had attacked a Razakar camp in Daibagyahati, now in Morrelganj Upazila of Bagerhat District. During the attack, the Razakars captured one Mahadev Saha, who happened to be from Alukdia village. On the afternoon of 4 November, a contingent of armed Razakar from the Daibagyahati Razakar camp, led by Commander Mujibur Rahman Mollah, arrived in Alukdia village with Mahadev Saha in captivity. They encircled the Shankharikathi market from three sides and rounded up around 90 Hindu males of various ages. The captive Hindus were tied up in pairs and made to stand in a line. With the blow of a whistle, they were shot by the Razakars. 42 Hindus died while the rest survived with injuries. The Razakars looted some of the adjacent Hindu villages and set them on fire. On the evening of 6 November, the local villagers rescued the wounded from the Shankharikathi market. Later the Razakars forced the villagers to take the corpses of the deceased to the banks of Bishkhali River, where they were buried.  Commemoration  On 4 November 2010, the victims of the massacre were officially commemorated for the first time through a ceremony. Later a plaque with the names of the victims on it were erected at the site of the killings.  Investigations  On 9 January 2013, a nine-member team of the International Crimes Tribunal (Bangladesh) visited Shankharikathi to investigate the war crimes committed by A. K. M. Yusuf. The massacre in Shankharikathi was committed by a unit of the Razakar forced founded by Yusuf. According to investigating officer Mohammad Helal Uddin, Sirajul Islam Master was the platoon commander of the Razakar unit.

Tyrrell (c. 1831-April 3, 1920) was an Irish American detective of the United States Secret Service who, as head of the field office in Chicago, became involved in foiling a plot to steal the remains of President Abraham Lincoln on November 7, 1876. Biography Tyrrell was born in Dublin2008:Will America's Political Civil War End? - LFTC - Letters From The Capitol and moved to the United States as a child, growing up in Buffalo, New York. He entered law enforcement in 1856 in Dunkirk, New York, and later became a detective for the Erie Railroad.Emerson, p. 192. He moved to Chicago in 1869, where he and his wife Kate resided at a lakefront home near Lincoln Park; initially working as a private detective, he joined the Chicago Police Department under Chief Elmer Washburn. After Washburn was named Chief of the Secret Service in 1874, Tyrrell became one of his agents.Craughwell, p. 55. In 1875, Tyrrell led the hunt for Benjamin Boyd, a prominent engraver who worked for a Chicago-based counterfeiting ring, and Nelson Driggs, a known dealer in counterfeit money. After a hunt that lasted eight months across five states, Tyrrell and his agents captured Boyd and his wife Almiranda in Fulton, Illinois on October 21, 1875; Chief Washburn apprehended Driggs in Centralia that same day.Craughwell, p. 75. Boyd and Driggs were sentenced to ten and fifteen years respectively, and were held at the Illinois State Penitentiary in Joliet.Stealing Lincoln's Body  The History RatSTEALING LINCOLN: MYTHS & MYSTERIES OF LINCOLN'S TOMB For his work in bringing down Boyd and Driggs, Tyrrell was promoted to chief operative of the Chicago field office in January 1876. The plot to steal Lincoln's body After Boyd's arrest, Irish crime boss James \\"Big Jim\\" Kennally (or Kinealy) came up with a plan to steal the body of Abraham Lincoln from its tomb at Oak Ridge Cemetery in Springfield and hold it in exchange for Boyd's release and a full pardon, as well as a cash ransom. After an earlier plan by associates of Kennally in Logan County, a known hotbed for counterfeiting, failed in the summer of 1876, Kennally recruited Terence Mullen and Jack Hughes to carry out the plan, to steal Lincoln's body and bury it in the Indiana Dunes along Lake Michigan in exchange for a full pardon for Ben Boyd and $200,000 ($4,255,319 in 2012 dollars) in cash. At the Hub, a saloon on the South Side of Chicago, Mullen and Hughes recruited a third man, Lewis Swegles, who was in fact one of Tyrrell's informants. On learning of the plot, Swegles brought word to Tyrrell, who immediately wired the new Chief of the Secret Service, James Brooks, requesting instructions; though it was not a counterfeiting case, Mullen and Hughes were known counterfeiters, and Tyrrell, horrified by the implications of the plot, called it a \\"damnable act\\" and a matter of \\"national importance\\". On October 27, 1876, Tyrrell met with Lincoln's only surviving child, Robert Todd Lincoln, and attorney Leonard Swett, who had contributed to Lincoln's presidential campaign in 1860. In that meeting, Tyrrell explained all the details he had of the plot and requested that he allow the crime to go forward in order to catch the criminals in the act; after an initial hesitation, Robert Lincoln agreed. On November 2, Brooks approved Tyrrell's request to act on the information.Emerson, p. 196.Craughwell, p. 98. Tyrrell then recruited a group of Secret Service agents and Pinkerton detectives to assist him in stopping the plot and apprehending the grave robbers. Mullen and Hughes decided on November 7, the day of the presidential election, to make their move. Tyrrell and his agents followed the grave robbers on the overnight train from Chicago to Springfield on the evening of November 6 and met with John Carroll Power, the custodian of Lincoln's tomb, who agreed to assist Tyrrell in the stakeout. On the evening of November 7, while Mullen and Hughes made their move on the tomb, Tyrrell, Power and his agents were waiting in the vestibule for Swegles to signal them; fearful of the echoes on the marble floor as they paced, they had removed their boots. Finally, Swegles gave the pre-arranged code word, \\"wash\\", and the agents moved in, but one of the Pinkertons accidentally discharged his pistol, causing the robbers to make a hasty retreat. Tyrrell briefly became embroiled in a gun battle with some of the Pinkerton detectives in the confusion that followed. Tyrrell and his agents arrested Mullen and Hughes in Chicago several days later.Emerson, p.197-199. Later life and legacy In 1879, Tyrrell and his family moved to Topeka, Kansas, within the St. Louis District of the Secret Service. He and his wife divorced in 1899, and he subsequently retired from the Secret Service and returned to Chicago.Craughwell, p. 203. He occasionally wrote \\"Stories of the Secret Service\\", one of which appeared in an edition of the Watertown Herald in Watertown, New York in 1905. Tyrrell died in Chicago on April 3, 1920, at the age of eighty-nine. After a High Requiem Mass at his parish church, St. Elizabeth's, on the South Side, Tyrrell was buried at Calvary Cemetery in Evanston. For his role in foiling the plot, Robert Lincoln gave Tyrrell a full-size portrait of his father in 1877,Craughwell, p. 154. followed by a written tribute to Tyrrell dated April 14, 1887; both of these items remain in the possession of Tyrrell's great-great-grandson, R.

Life and work Hudson was born in Montana and then lived in Wyoming for the first five years of his life. Although he experimented with different art forms as a child, he didn't become interested in sculpture until college. After studying for two years at the Dayton Art Institute, Hudson switched to travelling for a year. He spend six months working in West Africa with his father and the other six working at the Kunstakademie in Stuttgart, Germany. After a motorcycle accident Hudson returned to the states and worked as the assistant to sculptor Charles Ginnever. After a year with Ginnever he then went back to school and earned his Bachelor and Master of fine arts degrees at the California Institute of the Arts in 1972 and Dayton Art Institute, Dayton, Ohio in 1975. Hudson has been creating public sculptures since 1976 and since then his sculptures have been installed in 27 countries around the world. Hudson's first international commission was for two sculptures to be displayed at the World Expo 88 in Brisbane, Australia. Hudson's sculpture Paradigm, at 100 feet high in stainless steel, was the first in the world to be designed with the help of a computer, and the first to have a computerized lighting system installed. Hudson usually works with stone and steel but has also worked with brass, copper, bronze, and more. He is currently based in Ohio.

It was composed almost entirely of German- speaking residents of Philadelphia and newly arrived German immigrants. Total enrollment, over the course of the war, was 1,293 officers and men. The 75th Pennsylvania participated in several major battles including Second Bull Run, Chancellorsville, and Gettysburg. The regiment was transferred to the Western Theater in September, 1863.

History Organization Henry BohlenHenry Bohlen, a wealthy Philadelphia liquor merchant, financed, recruited, and organized the 75th Pennsylvania (originally designated the 40th Pennsylvania) during August and September 1861. As his second in command, Bohlen selected 35-year-old, Francis Mahler. The regiment fitted out at Camp Worth in Hestonville in West Philadelphia. On September 25, 1861, the regiment, by then numbering about 800 men, departed camp on foot and marched to downtown Philadelphia. There, the unit was presented with its regimental and national colors. At midnight, the troops departed Philadelphia for Washington, D.C. by train. Winter of 1861-1862 After arriving in the nation's capital, the 75th Pennsylvania crossed the Potomac by way of the Long Bridge and went into camp near Roach's Mills on Four Mile Run. In October, it moved into permanent winter quarters near Hunter's Chapel, Virginia. In November, 1861, the regiment was assigned to The Third Brigade of Louis Blenker's Division, composed primarily of German-American regiments. On November 22, the regiment participated in the review of the Army of Potomac at Bailey's Cross Roads by President Lincoln and General McClellan. 1862 Shenandoah Valley Operations Beginning on March 10, 1862, the 75th Pennsylvania served as forward guard during the advance on Manassas, Virginia. The men passed through Annandale, Burke's Station, and Fairfax Courthouse. They then marched west to Centreville, Virginia, and, from there, continued through Newmarket, Manassas, Milford, Weaverville, and Cattlett Station. By March 26, the regiment had arrived in Warrenton Junction. During this march, the troops suffered severely from want of provisions and shelter. After passing through Upperville and Paris, the regiment was ordered across the Shenandoah River at Berry's Ferry. The river was swollen with melted ice and snow. A boat carrying troops from companies I and K capsized in mid river, resulting in the loss of 53 lives. The accident was described as follows: > On the 15th [the regiment] was ordered to cross the Shenandoah, and move to > Winchester, in pursuit of Stonewall Jackson's force then confronting Banks. > Several rafts were constructed to cross the troops. The river was high, and > the current rapid. Company D, the skirmish company, crossed in safety, when, > to save time, and old ferry boat which had been partly burned by the enemy, > was repaired, and a rope stretched across the stream to guide it. Companies > I and K embarked, and when near the middle of the stream, the boat swamped > and suddenly began to sink. It was a moment of terror. A shriek of agony > rent the air as they were suddenly engul[f]ed. Scores of knapsacks covering > the surface of the water were all that was visible of the unfortunate men as > they floated, thus burdened, in the river. Captain Christian Wyck, of > company K, Lieutenant Adolf Winter, of company I, First Sergeant Joseph > Tiedemann, of company K, and fifty enlisted men were drowned. Sergeant > Tiedemann, an expert swimmer, sacrificed his life in a vain attempt to save > that of his Captain. Those troops remaining on the east side of the river eventually crossed at Snicker's Ferry. The regiment reached Winchester, Virginia, on April 18, where the men received new uniforms, shoes, tents, and rations. Colonel Bohlen received his commission as brigade commander and command of the regiment fell to Lieutenant-Colonel Mahler. Beginning on May 6, the men of the 75th Pennsylvania marched west from Winchester, passing through Romney and Petersburg, West Virginia, before arriving in Franklin, West Virginia. At Franklin, the men endured a period of near starvation. On May 26, the regiment arrived back in Petersburg, where the men were provided with rations that again proved insufficient. After leaving Petersburg, the troops endured a grueling march, during which they passed through Moorefield, before they eventually emerged into the Shenandoah Valley. In pursuit of rapidly retreating Confederate troops, they marched south through the valley passing through Strasburg, Woodstock, Mount Jackson and New Market, Virginia.thumbright400pxJackson's Valley Campaign, showing the route taken by the 75th Pennsylvania, while under the command of General Freemont, from Franklin, West Virginia, to the Battle of Cross Keys. Battle of Cross Keys On June 8, the 75th Pennsylvania participated in the Battle of Cross Keys near Harrisonburg, Virginia. The regiment arrived in an open area to the left of the Cross Keys Road, just past Pirkey's farm, at a little after 2:00 p.m. The men formed into double columns, but were held in reserve. The 75th Pennsylvania advanced to relieve other units on the left flank, sustaining heavy losses. However, as the regiment started to deploy, it was ordered to retreat into a gully to give the artillery a clear lane of fire. Thereafter, the regiment executed an orderly withdrawal. The next morning, federal troops found that the Confederates had abandoned their positions during the night. The Battle of Cross Keys was considered a Confederate victory. On June 26, the 75th Pennsylvania was placed within the Second Brigade of the Third Division of the newly formed First Corps under the command of Major-General Sigel. On June 30, upon assuming command of the First Corps, Sigel dispatched a communication to Major General Pope from Middletown, Virginia, which read in part: \\"The troops forming the First Corps are not in good condition; they are weakened and poorly provided.\\" In early July, the troops marched south, passing down the Luray Valley before arriving at Luray. From Luray, the regiment proceeded east and, after passing through Thornton's Gap, it arrived at Sperryville, Virginia. The regiment remained in this location for several weeks. Skirmish at Freeman's Ford The Battle of Rappahannock Station (Freeman's Ford), by Davenport, showing the death of Brigadier General Bohlen.On August 20, the 75th Pennsylvania crossed the Rappahannock River at Warrenton Sulphur Springs. The men then marched downstream along the north bank until they reached a point near Rappahannock Station. Also, on that date, a series of promotions altered the command structure of the regiment. Lieutenant-colonel Mahler was promoted to colonel, Major Alwin Von Matzdorf was promoted to lieutenant-colonel, and Captain August Ledig was promoted to major. On the morning of August 22, the 75th Pennsylvania moved upstream to Freeman's Ford. The regiment waded across the Rappahannock and mounted the steep bank on the far side. General Sigel had ordered the troops to reconnoiter the area to the left of the ford. After moving inland a short distance, they encountered Confederates in heavy force and fell back toward the river. During the skirmish at Freeman's Ford, which is considered part of the First Battle of Rappahannock Station, Brigadier General Bohlen, the original commander of the 75th Pennsylvania, was killed by enemy fire. Second Manassas On August 28, the 75th Pennsylvania was first ordered to march toward Manassas, but was then redirected toward Centreville. On August 29, the regiment was thrown forward against the forces of Confederate Generals Ewell and Jackson about a mile east of Groveton. The men crossed the turnpike then forded Young's Branch. The troops moved north toward an unfinished railroad embankment. Skirmishers soon encountered a strong force of the enemy. The Confederates advanced in mass and a general battle erupted. The 75th Pennsylvania furiously engaged the enemy until the Fifty-eighth New York Volunteer Regiment could be brought forward. At great cost, the men succeeded in driving the enemy back and gained possession of the railroad embankment. General Carl Schurz, in his report on the engagement, observed, \\"The conduct of the Seventy-fifth Pennsylvania, which displayed the greatest firmness and preserved perfect order on that occasion, deploying and firing with the utmost regularity, deserve[s] special praise.\\" At just after 3:00 p.m. on August 30, the 75th Pennsylvania was positioned near Dogan's farm house, facing toward Groveton. There it received a heaving shelling from an enemy battery. The men were ordered forward and managed to seize the crest of a wooded hill. At that point, a fierce firefight erupted. Colonel Mahler, who was in command of the regiment, was wounded. When a Confederate battery opened, the men were forced to seek cover in a ravine about 100 yards behind the position they had previously occupied. A general retreat was ordered. Just after 2:00 a.m., the men waded across Bull Run and, by 7:00 a.m. they arrived in Centreville. During the Second Battle of Manassas, another defeat for the Union Army, the 75th Pennsylvania suffered 133 casualties. The regiment spent the winter of 1862-1863 in the defenses of the capital, moving between Centreville, Stafford Courthouse, and Brook's Station. 1863 ChancellorsvilleAfter the 75th Pennsylvania was routed along with the remainder of the Eleventh Corps in General Stonewall Jackson's flank attack, scattered elements of the regiment made a brief stand near the Wilderness Church at Chancellorsville. In January, 1863, the 75th Pennsylvania participated in General Burnside's failed second advance, the infamous \\"Mud March.\\". It then moved to Hartwood Church, near Falmouth, before returning to Stafford Courthouse. On, April 27, the regiment marched from camp near Brook's Station, proceeding northwest. The men crossed the Rappahannock River by pontoon bridge at Kelley's Ford, and proceeded south, crossing the Rapidan River on a makeshift bridge at Germanna Ford. After passing the Wilderness Tavern, on April 30, the regiment arrived at a location about two miles west of Chancellorsville, in an area known as \\"the Wilderness.\\" The men were positioned in a clearing astride the Chancellorsville Turnpike in the spot where it joined the Orange Court House Plank Road. The clearing contained a farmhouse, the Hawkins' farm, the Wilderness Church, and an inn known as Dowdall's Tavern. On May 2 Union commanders received reports of a large body of Confederate troops marching rapidly to the west. Major General Howard, in charge of the Eleventh Corps, of which the 75th Pennsylvania was part, ignored this potential threat. Just before 6:00 p.m., Confederate General Jackson attacked the Union flank with 28,000 troops. Several elements of the 75th Pennsylvania were overtaken. Due to the confusion and the thickness of the undergrowth surrounding the area, several groups of men became separated from the main force. The men retreated in disorder as one unit collapsed back upon the next unit further to the east. Casualties were high. Altogether, the Confederates captured 40 men from the regiment, including Lieutenant-Colonel Alwin Matzdorff. The 75th Pennsylvania did not see any serious action for the remainder of the battle, which was a resounding Confederate victory. On May 5, General Hooker ordered a general retreat, and the regiment returned to its camp near Brook's Station. The German-speaking troops were made the scapegoats for the Union defeat at Chancellorsville. Morale within the regiment hit an all-time low. Confederate forces attack the Eleventh Corps, 2:00-4:00 p.m. on July 1, 1863. The 75th Pennsylvania, under Schurz and Krzyzanowski, was positioned just east of the Carlisle Road and west of Barlow KnollGettysburg On June 12, 1863, the 75th Pennsylvania embarked on an exhaustive series of marches, in response to a threatened Confederate invasion of Maryland and Pennsylvania. On June 25, the regiment crossed the Potomac River at Edward's Ferry, and proceeded northwest into Maryland. By June 30, the men had reached Emmitsburg, Maryland, where they camped on the grounds of the St. Joseph's Seminary. On the morning of July 1, the regiment was rushed toward Gettysburg, Pennsylvania, along the Taneytown Road. After passing through town, the regiment advanced northward across open fields under enemy fire. At about 2:00 p.m. the men were arrayed in a line of battle just east of the Carlisle Road. There, an intense firefight occurred. The 75th Pennsylvania held this position for nearly an hour. However, a Confederate flanking maneuver and the collapse of adjacent regiments exposed the men to an enfilading fire that cut large gaps in the ranks. Colonel Mahler, the regiment's commander, was hit in the leg at the same moment that his horse was shot out from under him. Mahler was able to drag himself from under the stricken animal and stayed in the fight. However, he was soon struck by a second shot and lay mortally wounded. Mahler would die in a field hospital on July 5. Captain Saalmann of Company C was also severely wounded at this time. Lieutenant Sill was shot through the leg, which was later amputated. He died in a field hospital several weeks later. In the midst of these mounting casualties, Major August Ledig took command. A general retreat was ordered. The 75th Pennsylvania fell back through town, rallying at Cemetery Hill. Over the next two days, the regiment was positioned in the defenses of Cemetery Hill on the far right of the Union Army. From this position, it continued to exchange fire with the enemy. During the Battle of Gettysburg, the 75th Pennsylvania lost many men and officers, with 31 killed, nearly 100 wounded, and six taken prisoner. These losses amounted to 72 percent of those who participated in the battle. Only one other regiment at Gettysburg, the 1st Minnesota, which recorded losses of 82 percent, sustained higher casualties. The overwhelming bulk of the casualties occurred within a relatively short period, perhaps 20 minutes, on the afternoon of July 1. Lieutenant Steiger spoke of the losses as follows: > While there were many regiments who suffered terrible and naturally > sustained great loss in this action, yet we claim that the magnitude of its > loss, here sustained, as made manifest in its shrunken ranks, was painfully > evident to all as the regiment proceeded on the march from Gettysburg to > follow the retreating troops of the Confederate army, when its largely > depleted ranks presented an object lesson of grim significance. For such was > the decimation in its ranks that the little band of men, numbering but > fifty-two survivors, evoked the tender sympathy of troops of the emergency > corps, whom we passed drawn up in line as we went through the village of > Middletown while on the march in pursuit of General Robert E. Lee's > retreating army ‚Ä¶ These troops viewed with amazement the passing column of > battle scarred men ‚Ä¶ which in themselves practically constituted the remnant > of this regiment as it emerged from the battlefield of Gettysburg.\\" Transfer to Tennessee During late summer 1863, much of the Union Army lay besieged in Chattanooga, Tennessee. To alleviate this situation, about 18,000 troops from the Army of the Potomac were transported to the Chattanooga area by train. The 75th Pennsylvania was among those units transferred. On September 24, the regiment received marching orders and immediately broke camp at Warrenton, Virginia. The troops marched east through the night, arriving at Warrenton Junction the following morning. They then turned north along the tracks of the Orange and Alexandria Railroad reaching Manassas at 5:00 p.m. on the afternoon of the 25th. There, the men were herded aboard railroad cars. In a complex movement that entailed several changes of trains and engines, the troops passed through Washington, D.C., Harper's Ferry, Maryland, Grafton, West Virginia, and Columbus, Ohio, before arriving in Indianapolis, Indiana. From there, they travelled south, passing through Louisville, Kentucky, and Nashville, Tennessee, before arriving in Bridgeport, Alabama, on October 2, 1863. Operations around Chattanooga The Battle of Chattanooga and assault on Missionary Ridge. On October 19, 1863, the 75th Pennsylvania was assigned to the Third Brigade of the Third Division of the Eleventh Corps, under Colonel Hecker. In the early morning hours of October 29, the regiment engaged in a rare night battle near Wauhatchie, Tennessee. It did not sustain any serious losses during this Union victory. Between November 23 and November 26, the regiment played a role in the Battle of Chattanooga. According to Lieutenant Steiger, the regiment \\"participated in all the movements and fighting of the division around Chattanooga, culminating on the 25th in carrying Missionary Ridge and establishing the complete rout of the enemy.\\" On November 28, the regiment, as part of the Eleventh Corps, was ordered to proceed to the relief of General Burnside, who was under siege at Knoxville, Tennessee. After a difficult winter march, which took the troops eastward through Cleveland, Sweetwater, Philadelphia, Loudon, and Unitia, they arrived in Louisville, Tennessee, on December 5. There they learned that the siege had been lifted. They were ordered to return to the vicinity of Chattanooga. 1864 and 1865 The Battle of Franklin was a Union victory that exacted a high toll in Confederate lives. On January 2, 1864, the 75th Pennsylvania was remustered into the army as a veteran organization. The troops received a 30-day furlough, which enabled them to visit their families in Philadelphia. The furlough ended on March 8, when the troops left Philadelphia by train, the ranks having been swelled by new recruits. The men of the regiment eventually arrived at Bridgeport, Alabama, and resumed duties similar to those performed before their departure. The regiment participated in the Battle of Franklin, Tennessee, on November 30. Of this engagement, Lieutenant Steiger reported: > At the battle of Franklin, Tennessee ‚Ä¶ where the Southern Army, under the > command of General Hood, received a disastrous check in its advance upon > Nashville, a mounted detachment of the Seventy-fifth Regiment occupied the > town, and companies A, C, F, G, H, I and K ‚Ä¶ were encamped at Fort Granger, > on the north bank of the Harpeth. The several detachments ‚Ä¶ were under fire > but ‚Ä¶ suffered only a small loss. Company E, however, under the command of > Lieutenant Wiegand, which had for some time been stationed at a point > several miles south of the town on the Tennessee and Alabama Railroad, was > captured by the advancing rebel army ‚Ä¶This unfortunate episode entailed a > loss of one commissioned officer and about thirty enlisted men, who, after > several months' confinement as prisoners of war, were released on parole and > sent to their homes. During the remainder of its service, the regiment played a supporting role, guarded and transported prisoners, guarded the railroad, and engaged in provost duty in the vicinity of Franklin and Nashville, Tennessee. The 75th Pennsylvania was mustered out of service on September 1, 1865. On September 9 the regiment departed Murfreesboro, Tennessee, and arrived back in Pennsylvania on September 12.

The first, dedicated in 1876, is located in the national cemetery southeast of town. The front panel reads \\"In Memoriam of Our Comrades.\\" The second monument, completed in 1888, is north of town on Howard Road, just east of Carlisle Road. This monument marks the position held by the 75th Pennsylvania on the afternoon of July 1, 1863, before it was overrun by Confederate forces. The front panel reads: \\"75th Pennsylvania Infantry 2nd Brigade, 3rd Division, 11th Corps. July 1. Fought on this position from 2 p.m. until the Corps retired. July 2 & 3\\\\.

The Abbey was founded by Irish and Scottish monks at the beginning of the 8th century, on an island in the Rhine close to the present day village of La Wantzenau (and Honau, which is part of Rheinau), which was later built on Abbey lands. The first abbot was Benedict (alias Beno√Æt). In 721, Duke Adalbert of Alsace, the brother of Saint Odile, built a new abbey for the monks, just four years after he had built the Abbey of St Stephen in Strasbourg. The Abbey was dedicated to Saint Michael the Archangel, a popular saint at the time, as can be testified by the establishment of the abbeys of Mont St Michel in Normandy and Saint Mihiel in Lorraine in the same period. On Adalbert's death in 723, the abbey passed to King Theuderic IV. The abbey continued to benefit from numerous generous donations. Benedict, who was still living in 726, eventually resigned as abbot and chose Tuban as his successor. Tuban is mentioned in several records of donations to the Abbey (Grandidier, op.cit.). The subsequent abbots were Etienne, followed by Beatus. In 776 the Abbot Beatus is mentioned in a Charter from Charlemagne, referring to him as bishop and confirming that the Abbey would continue to be administered by Irish monks (Grandidier, op.cit.). According to Grandidier, the number of monks increased considerably during the time of Beatus and monks were sent out to found other churches and monasteries, including those at Luttenbach, in Alsace Aschaffenburg in Germany and Munster in Switzerland, all of which depended on Honau. Beatus was succeeded as Abbot by Edigan, who in turn was succeeded by Thomas. The first five abbots were all referred to as saints in the calendar of Saint Pierre le Vieux in Strasbourg, which, at the time of Grandidier, still claimed to hold relics of all five. Although some writers claim the Abbey as a Benedictine foundation, this is disputed by Hunkler, who argues that it has not proved possible to associate the abbey to any particular monastic order. Several of the early abbots had the title bishop, leading to speculation that the abbey was the seat of a bishopric, but it is more probable that they were regional bishops. In the 11th century, the Abbey became secularised, a chapter was created (Hunkler, op. cit.) In 1290, the Abbey was abandoned, when the island was threatened by floodwaters. On 7 September 1290 Conrad de Lichtenberg, the Bishop of Strasbourg, transferred the Chapter to Rhinau, where a new Abbey was built, this too on an island in the Rhine. The same fate befell this second Abbey, which was abandoned in 1398 due to flooding. The Chapter then moved to Strasbourg on 22 May 1398, where the canons were permitted to practice their liturgy in the church of Saint Pierre le Vieux (Hunkler, op. cit.). They stayed there until 1790, when the Chapter was wound up, apart from the period 1529 to 1683 when, because of the Reform, they were not allowed to use the Church. The cartulary of Honau The now lost cartulary of Honau, written in 1079, and described by a 17th- century Jesuit, recorded over a thousand charters from the foundation of the abbey until the time of Charlemagne. Some of these are listed in Bishop Reeves' article.

Eight were constructed. Development The Anfibio Verese was designed by Angelo Mori and built by the Tommaso Dal Molin Gliding Group in the grounds of a primary school in Varese. It was a high-wing monoplane, its two spar wing supported centrally on a fuselage pedestal and braced on each side with a faired V-strut from the spars near mid-span to the lower fuselage. It was mounted with some dihedral and in plan was rectangular with blunt tips. The Anfibio Varese had a caulked plywood covered, hexagonal section fuselage with an open cockpit immediately ahead of the wing pedestal. The fuselage tapered slightly rearwards to the tail, where the rectangular tailplane was mounted on top, supported by a single small strut on each side, and carried constant chord elevators. The fin was small but the balanced rudder was tall and somewhat pointed; it extended down to the keel and moved in an elevator cut-out. The fuselage underside was formed into a single step hull, though there was also a standard glider skid, running from just aft of the nose via the step to aft of mid-chord, assisted by a very small tail skid for land operations. Its first flight was in 1933. On 16 September 1934 eight Anfibio Vareses and one other amphibious glider were bungee-launched from the summit of the Campo dei Fiori di Varese, alighting on Lake Schiranna near Varese.

Atkins (born April 29, 1970) is a former American politician and member of the Delaware House of Representatives from 2003 until 2014 representing District 41. Atkins was originally elected as a Republican in 2002, then switched to the Democratic Party in 2008 after resigning over a drunk driving incident. He eventually lost his seat to newcomer Richard G. Collins in the 2014 general election. Atkins has been \\"repeatedly accused of violence against women\\" and arrested multiple times for domestic assault. In August 2018, he pled guilty to misdemeanor assault and breach of release charges, and was sentenced to 22 days in prison along with one year of probation. Political career Atkins began his political career as a Republican when he won a three-way race in 2002 to replace retiring Democrat Charles P. West, who had held the 41st district seat since 1977. In 2007, Atkins was arrested for drunk driving and tried to influence the officer by presenting his State Representative identification. He was ticketed, but later that night assaulted his wife and was arrested again for domestic violence. Atkins had a close relationship with Speaker of the House Pete Schwartzkopf, who defended Atkins after he was served with a protection order to stay away from his estranged wife. The House Ethics Committee investigated the incident and found cause to begin expulsion proceedings. Atkins then resigned. A special election was held to fill his seat and was won by Republican Gregory Hastings. Although Atkins had resigned his seat as a Republican, he switched his party registration to Democrat. In the 2008 general election, now Democrat Atkins, won against Hastings who was occupying his old seat. As a Democrat he was re-elected twice more until losing his seat to Republican Richard Collins in the 2014 general election. Legal troubles and domestic violence arrests On October 29, 2006, Atkins was caught drunk driving and used his representative identification to gain leniency from the Ocean City, Maryland police officers and avoid arrest for the incident. An investigation by the House Ethics Committee found that Atkins had continued to drive across the Delaware state line after being instructed to refrain from driving and was arrested later that morning on a charge of offensive touching following a physical altercation with his then wife. He had attempted to avoid the domestic violence arrest by making \\"several attempts to speak with Millsboro police chief.\\" Fellow Republican Richard C. Cathcart sponsored House Resolution 13 to censure Atkins, and it was approved by the House Ethics Committee. The proposed sanctions included requiring him to forgo use of his legislative identification card and legislative license plate, be removed as chairman from any legislative committees, pay a fine, receive an alcohol evaluation, and comply with court-ordered counseling. Atkins resigned from his seat on March 27, 2007, before the official censure took effect. He subsequently switched his party registration to Democrat and was reelected in the next election as part of the Democratic Party. In 2012, Atkins resigned from the Public Safety and Homeland Security Committee after attacking a police officer in an angry email. He had received a verbal warning from the police officer after being caught speeding and sent the email to a state police captain to complain. On June 5, 2014, the Delaware Family Court issued a restraining order for Atkins to stay away from his estranged wife and children due to allegations of violence and abuse. The next day, Atkins filed a petition against his wife claiming she was the one being abusive. As of June 13, 2014, Atkins and his wife were sharing joint custody of their children, although his wife maintained allegations of harassment and abuse. In June 2016, Atkins was arrested after a physical altercation with his ex-girlfriend. He was charged with offensive touching and criminal mischief, and decided against a bid to regain his seat that he had been considering. The charges were later dropped on the basis of insufficient evidence. In July 2018, Atkins was arrested and charged with felony strangulation and assault after an argument with his then girlfriend where he squeezed her neck until she could not breathe. He was arrested two more times that month for domestic violence and harassment that violated a no-contact order. On August 17, 2018, he pled guilty to misdemeanor assault and breach of release charges, and was sentenced to time served, which was 22 days in prison, along with one year of probation. He remained incarcerated until he received an electronic GPS device and was prohibited from possessing a firearm for five years.

He is best known as the bassist in the band Lava, but was also recognized as music producer, musician and songwriter for other artists like Randy Crawford, Mezzoforte and Sissel Kyrkjeb√∏. He also released three solo albums and was editor of the journal \\"Musikkpraksis\\".  Career = Musician  Graf was raised in a musical family and was greatly inspired by his older brother Haakon known from bands like 'Ruphus', 'Hawk on Flight', and collaborations with such as Terje Rypdal and Jan Garbarek. Graf started his career in 1967 on trumpet, and debuted as a soloist 1 Christmas Day 1972 in Manglerud church. In 1974 he substituted the trumpet to bass guitar and started the following year a rock band together with the guitarist Marius M√ºller. In 1979 he got his first professional studio job as a funk bass player. Graf was among the first funk bassists in Norway that restrained slap and snap technique, and the artist and vocalist Alex, or Alex Naumik Sand√∏y, who was among the first artists to introduced the funk rock in Norway, hired him to play on her album Daddy Child, because her bass player and producer Svein Gundersen failed to play this new style. The same year he also received a request from Svein Dag Hauge to join the band Lava, where Marius M√ºller just had joined and recommended Graf, after meeting with Hauge. Lava's second album Cruisin', sold to Silver and climbed the charts. Grafs first composition, \\"Take Your Time\\" (with lyrics by Ivar Dyrhaug), climbed to the top of the European summit. Seven CD album was recorded at Lava and a variety of studio work, as well as a composer and producer on numerous recordings. In 1985 Graf recorded his debut solo album The Boy Next Door, which was released in 13 European countries. This led to appearances in British and Danish TV shows. From the mid 1980s onwards 1990s Graf worked in various compositions, including with Olav Stedje og Egil Eld√∏en in the band project 'Stedje/Graf/Eld√∏en', and this was the first band to play at the opening of Rockefeller Music Hall in 1986. Otherwise contributed Graf as a studio musician with artists like Sissel Kyrkjeb√∏, Randy Crawford and Elisabeth Andreassen. For a period in the 1990s, Graf worked in Los Angeles and New York as a songwriter and producer, and had the production of an American band called 'The Ancestors' where he replaced the producer Eddie Kramer, and collaborated with musician and actor Rick Springfield as songwriter. Graf has also produced the debut album Stille vann by Norwegian artist Torhild Nigar in the New York studio Manhattan Center Studios. Lava made their comeback album Polarity in 2003. This led to a lot of activity on the Norwegian music scene, and appearances on NRK television along with Hanne Boel, among others. In 2005 the band released the sequel Alibi, and in 2009 Lava released their last album, Symphonic Journey, in collaboration with Kringkastingsorkesteret.  Composer  Graf was invited to participate as a composer in Melodi Grand Prix 1983, and delivered the song \\"Melodi\\" performed by Olav Stedje as number four. In Melodi Grand Prix 1985 he performed his self-composed song, \\"II & II\\". Since this he participated several times in the 1980s and 1990s, but then only as a songwriter. In 1984 he launched a side project called 'Mr. Walker & The Walkmen' together with Steinar Fjeld and St√•le Rasmussen, and got a hit with \\"This Is Your Walkman Talking\\". During 1985, 30 of his compositions released on record with different musicians, including himself. Best known from this time were the ballad \\"Shine\\", performed together with Egil Eld√∏en and the Swedish singer Frank √Ödahl. The song was the highlight of Grafs debut solo album, The Boy Next Door. The album was released in 13 countries, and Graf appeared on television in England and Denmark.  Producer  As a producer worked Graf with several other musicians, including Randy Crawford (USA), Mezzoforte (Iceland), The Ancestors (USA), Tindrum, Aina Olsen, Trine Rein, Jan Werner Danielsen, Torhild Nigar and 'Floweryard'. He also created music for the movies Frida ‚Äì med hjertet i h√•nden, Petra og kuule sm√•kryp by Torhild Nigar and Br√∏drene Dal Og Vikingsverdets Forbannelse. In 1996 he produced the album I evighet by Elisabeth Andreassen, who received second place in the international Melodi Grand Prix final in Oslo Spektrum. Late 1980s Graf started a trio with Egil Eld√∏en and Olav Stedje. Musically, this was a continuation of the acoustic, country rock, inspired by Eagles and Crosby, Stills & Nash. The trio was disbanded before they managed to make a record together. In the early 1990s he was oriented towards Latin music within the trio 'Some Like It Hot' including Lakki Patey (band leader) and Sergio Gonzales (reunited in 2004). In 2001 Graf finally found time to record a new solo album Oddity Two Acceptance, where he played almost all the instruments by himself. The album also includes a retake of \\"Shine\\". Graf also taught in 'Knowledge of the music industry' at 'Nordisk Institutt for Scene og Studio', and wrote a recipe for the project Opp og Fram on behalf of H√∏gskolen i Harstad. In recent years (2011) Graf worked with other musicians and artists like Ronni Le Tekr√∏ and Jan Ingvar Toft. Graf was buried in Holmenkollen Chapel 11 July 2013.

It was constructed in 1922‚Äì23 by Calouste Gulbenkian as a memorial to his parents, and the architect was Arthur Davis. It is the only church in England to have been built in the traditional Armenian style. Its design is inspired by the 13th century freestanding bell tower of Haghpat Monastery. It is the seat of the Diocese of the United Kingdom of the Armenian Apostolic Church. History Dedication to Gulbenkian's parents at the entrance of the church. The construction of the church was funded by Calouste Gulbenkian, an Ottoman-born Armenian oil magnate. He agreed to finance it with the precondition to dedicate it to his parents, Sarkis and Takouhi. Besides being his father's name, Sarkis is also the name of one of Armenia's most celebrated saints‚ÄîSaint Sarkis the Warrior. The church was designed by Arthur Joseph Davis and built by Holloway Brothers. Its construction began in February 1922 and it was consecrated on 11 January 1923. The church was expanded twice; first in 1937 a baptistery was added to the north side along with a new entrance, and, in 1950, a sacristy was added in the south-east side of the church. Catholicos Vazgen I visited the church twice, in 1978 and 1983. Architecture The church follows traditional Armenian church architecture. It is modeled after the freestanding bell tower of Haghpat Monastery, built it 1245. The exterior, similar to the Haghpat bell tower, has three stages/levels. The church has been described as an \\"exotic eastern edifice\\" by The Economist.The Economist, Volume 216, 1965, page 344 \\"...the Armenian church of St Sarkis.

The entrance has an English inscription recording its dedication to Gulbenkian's parents \\"in the Armenian Era 1372.\\" The altarpiece contains a painting of Virgin and Child with gilded relief carving of angles in the gable made by the Bromsgrove Guild of Applied Arts. There are also sculptures of Gulbenkian family members inside the church.

November 8th, 2013 Following the phylloxera epidemic of the mid-19th century and the economic devastation of the World Wars of the early 20th century, plantings of Pallagrello nero declined greatly and the variety was thought to be extinct until it was rediscovered growing in an abandoned Campanian vineyard in the 1990s.J. Robinson, J. Harding and J. Vouillamoz Wine Grapes - A complete guide to 1,368 vine varieties, including their origins and flavours pgs 761-762 Allen Lane 2012 Despite having similar names and both varieties originated in Campania, Pallagrello nero is not a color mutation of the white Campanian wine grape Pallagrello bianco though DNA profiling has not determined yet if the two varieties are closely related. Likewise, despite Pallagrello nero also being known under the synonym of Coda di Volpe , DNA analysis has ruled out a relationship with the white Campanian wine grape, Coda di Volpe, which, itself, is also known under the synonym Pallagrello and has similar looking \\"fox tail-shaped\\" grape clusters. There is some DNA evidence to suggest that Pallagrello nero maybe related to an old red Campania variety grown in the province of Caserta known as Casavecchia but the exact extent of that relationship is not yet known. History and name Pallagrello nero was one of the grape varieties included by architect Luigi Vanvitelli in his 1775 Vigna del Ventaglio vineyard for the royal palace at Caserta. Ampelographers believe that Pallagrello nero is likely native to Campania and originated in what is now the province of Caserta. The name Pallagrello is likely derived from the Italian word pagliarello which refers to the straw mat that some grape varieties (such as Pallagrello bianco) were laid on after harvest to dry out before fermentation to produce straw wine. The first written records of the grape date back to the late 18th century under the synonym Pallarelli. Under another old synonym, Piedmonte rosso, Pallagrello nero was one of the varieties included in the fan-shaped Vigna del Ventaglio vineyard created in 1775 by architect Luigi Vanvitelli for King Ferdinand's royal palace at Caserta. Planted on sloping terrain in the San Leucio frazione near the palace, the vineyard was planted in a semicircle design subdivided into 10 segments (or \\"fan blades\\") each planted to a different grape variety. Like many Italian grape varieties, plantings of Pallagrello nero sharply declined in the decades following the phylloxera epidemic of the mid-19th century and the economic devastation of the World Wars of the early 20th century. The variety was thought to be extinct until it was rediscovered in 1990s, along with Pallagrello bianco, by a local winemaker growing in an abandoned Campanian vineyard. Viticulture and relationship to other grapes Pallagrello nero is a mid to late ripening grape variety that has a natural tendency to be very low yielding. The grape has good resistance to many viticultural hazards including to botrytis bunch rot and contains a high natural content of phenolic compounds including anthocyanins which contribute to the color of wine. Even though both varieties likely originated in the same part of Campania and the two grapes have historically been linked by synonyms and association, ampelographers have determined that Pallagrello nero is not a color mutation of Pallagrello bianco (in the same way that, for example, Pinot blanc is a color mutation of Pinot noir) though DNA profiling has yet to determine exactly how the two grapes may be related. Other DNA studies have instead suggested a relationship between Pallagrello nero and an old Campania variety, Casavecchia, that is native to the Caserta region Wine regions The province of Caserta Today Pallagrello nero is grown almost exclusively in the Campania region, particularly in the province of Caserta where it has a long historical association with. The majority of the grapes plantings can be found around the communes of Alife, Alvignano, Caiazzo and Castel Campagnano. Outside of Caserta, some minor plantings can be found in the provinces of Avellino in Campania and Campobasso in Molise. Styles Pallagrello nero is rarely seen as a varietal and is currently only permitted to be made as one under the Indicazione geografica tipica (IGT) designation of Campania. According to Master of Wine Jancis Robinson, those rare varietal examples tend to be dominated by peppery spice and cherry flavors with noticeable tannins that gives the wines some aging potential. Synonyms Over the years, Pallagrello nero has been known under a variety of synonyms including: Coda di Volpe , Pallarelli, Pallagrella , Pallagrello, Piedilungo and Piedimonte rosso.Vitis International Variety Catalogue (VIVC) Pallagrello nero Accessed: November 8th, 2013 References Category:Red wine grape varieties ","title":"Pallagrello nero"},{"id":"41025599","text":"Chileulia stalactitis is a species of moth of the family Tortricidae.

From 2006 to 2008 RRC undertook a strategic planning process to serve as a 5-year guide for the organization. Waxman was central in the strategic plan's development. The \\"Key Issues\\" addressed by the plan included: demographics of the Jewish community, image and influence, and the educational program. Regarding the plan, Waxman stated: In the \\"Making Change Happen\\" section of the plan Waxman explained that the ideas the strategic planning committee considered \\"most potent\\" include \\"the expansiveness and creativity inherent in Kaplan's definition of Judaism as the evolving religious civilization of the Jewish people [and] the sense of both empowerment and responsibility embedded in that concept and in the ensuing mandate that every generation of Jews must reconstruct Judaism for its own time.\\" About the committee's motivation, Waxman said: During the fourth year of the five-year plan (2012) the Reconstructionist movement as a whole underwent a restructuring. At that point the Jewish Reconstructionist Federation (JRF)--the union of Reconstructionist congregations‚Äîand RRC became one organization and RRC then became the \\"primary national organization\\" of the Reconstructionist movement, under the leadership of RRC President Rabbi Dan Ehrenkrantz. Ehrenkrantz explained \\"our congregations voted to restructure, closing the doors of the Jewish Reconstructionist Federation (JRF) and bringing together most movement activities under one roof at the Reconstructionist Rabbinical College (RRC). On October 9, 2013, that more broadly structured RRC named Deborah Waxman as its next president, the first to be appointed to lead the new RRC organization. She is believed to be the first woman rabbi to head a joint Jewish congregational union and Jewish seminary. Before she began her presidency on January 1st, 2014, Waxman was \\"working on completing the merged organization's first-ever strategic plan. ... Waxman said the organization's goal is to further engage people involved in Reconstructionist Judaism and to provide an avenue into Jewish life ‚Äî be it cultural, religious or activist ‚Äî for anyone who is searching. In the wider American landscape, she views Reconstructionism as a strong voice for a progressive religion that is deeply engaged in social-justice issues.\\" In addition to her experience in strategic planning, Waxman has written grant proposals that have won support from funders such as the Kresge Foundation, Wexner Foundation and Cummings Foundation and has stewarded major RRC donors. Pulpit Rabbi Waxman served as High Holy Days rabbi at Congregation Bet Havarim in Syracuse, NY for 11 years. Personal life Waxman was born and raised in West Hartford, Connecticut. She has two siblings. She was raised a Conservative Jew and was one of the first girls in Connecticut to have a Conservative Bat Mitzvah on a Saturday morning (in 1979). Her father was a traveling salesman and her mother was president of the sisterhood of their synagogue in Bloomfield, Connecticut. Waxman lives in Elkins Park, in suburban Philadelphia with her partner, Christina Ager, a Jew by choice.

Life  In the third century many Germanic peoples invaded the Roman Empire and plundered the border regions. Among these, the Goths were the biggest people crossing the Roman borders and devastating the Balkan peninsula and also the coasts of the Black Sea and even the Aegean Sea. Especially while emperor Aurelian, the magister equitum of emperor Claudius Gothicus, who had died of the plague, was fighting the dead emperor‚Äôs brother and rightful heir Quintillus and later the Vandals and Juthungi in Italy, Tervings under their leader Cannabaudes devastated the provinces of the lower Danube and sacked some cities. On his march to the East to reintegrate the Palmyrene Empire to the Roman Empire, Aurelian drove them out of his empire and, unlike others before him, followed them over the Danube. It came to a battle, and Cannabaudes died along with 5,000 of his men. For this victory Aurelian received the surname Gothicus Maximus.CIL XII 5549; ILS 8925. At his triumph after his victory over the Palmyrene Empire, he carried with him Gothic women, dressed as Amazons, and a chariot, carried by four stags, that is said to have belonged to Cannabaudes. Despite his victory over Cannabaudes, Aurelian abandoned the province of Dacia, which was populated by barbaric tribes such as the Goths. So, Aurelian had averted the Gothic menace for a century. On one hand, they were frightened off, on the other hand they were busy with the vacant lands in Dacia. How powerful Cannabaudes was, is not sure. While some historians call him a king of the Goths,Goltz 2008, 461; Watson 1998, 54f.; Wolfram ¬≥1990, 106; ¬≤2005, 34. others believe that he was only one more powerful leader among many.Burns 1984, S. 31; Heather 1996, S. 44. The only ancient source mentioning his name is the Historia Augusta,HA Aurelian 22,2. which is not always reliable for this time. Nevertheless, Cannabaudes is seen as a historic person by most historians. Some historians want to identify Cannabaudes with Cniva,Groag 1903, 1378; Wolfram ¬≥1990, 46; 2001, 36. the Gothic leader who defeated and killed emperor Decius at the Battle of Abrittus twenty years earlier, others think he might rather be his son.Barnes 1978, 70. In the altered form of his name, Cannabas, Herwig Wolfram assumes a cacography of the name Cannabaudes, to make it sound like cannabis.Wolfram ¬≥1990, 394; 2005, 108.

The structure is topped with towers, from which long walls descend on a sharp slope viewing the river. The preserved fortification area is , among the largest in northwestern Serbia. Vestiges indicate that the walls were from cut stone and lime mortar. Two sides feature sharp edges, strengthened almonds to prevent access. On the third side \\"Duzon\\" guard tower built at the end of narrow steep rocks that are difficult to pass. On the fourth side the fortress was protected by the river. On the top of the fortress, from the east side, a 5x7 m tower rose. On the west side at the lowest elevation is a 7,1 x 6,6 m tower. Other towers are thought to be similar in size. There are remains of a 5th-6th century church that was destroyed in an Avar or Slavic attack at the end of the 6th century. It was built on the foundations of a building that burned in the 4th century, with dimensions of 13 m by 9 m. Its walls rose 1.7 m to 1.3 m above the cliffs fronting the river. Near the church was found two more premises (connected to the church, with the walls younger than the church walls) and a tomb 2 x 1 m, that was robbed in the ancient period, with the remains of four persons.  History  The city was built in the 4th century to serve as an episcopal seat in the Roman Balkans. Researchers found the a remains of a church and the remains of the episcopal throne within. The fortress and the city were destroyed and rebuilt several times during barbarian invasions. In the 10th century it was abandoned, perhaps due to a Magyar-Serb conflict during Serbian Prince ƒåaslav (r. 926‚Äì960). The church was only about two feet from the cliffs in the southwest corner of the fortress. This indicates that within the walls of the city there was a well-developed settlement that hosted many buildings. The church was built on the city's outskirts. Stratigraphic data in tower 1 and the church dates to around the 6th century. The city's construction techniques belong to the tradition of early Byzantine military architecture. During the 6th century, starting from the reign of Anastasius I Dicorus came a major renovation of the northern part of the Empire. The renovation lasted until the middle of the century. The fortress may have been built in that time. The Gradac canyon was of great importance during the Roman Empire because, it reached one of the main cities, Simriy, near the metalliferous area of Podrinje and east Bosna's border. Trade reached Dalmatia and was one of the key economic systems of this part of the Empire. The fortress may have been built on an earlier city. Archaeologists found two layers of arson and destruction, one from the first half of the 5th century, and the other from the end of the 6th century. It developed into a significant regional center that likely connected to the minerals industry in the region. The fortifications were possibly improved later, at the end of the 4th century, to protect the settlement from the river. Communities within the city walls were later moved a few miles downstream, on the Grabac and Kolubara deltas, where the core of the modern city of Valjevo formed. Evidence of bitter struggle between Slavs against invaders was excavated, including remnants of broken arms lost in combat and metal objects (primarily iron used to build wooden structures). The need for metals at that time led the Slavs to sift through the ashes looking for metal. Little remains of the fortress' walls and buildings. Among the most interesting locations within the fortress is the remains of the \\"donjon\\" (keep) tower, episcopal church and Lent premises. The National Museum of Valjevo contains artifacts of Jerina. Etymology Veselin ƒåajkanoviƒá believed that the Slavic name Jerinin grad was actually derived from Hellene ethnonym. This is implied also by the fact that the city emerged under the Roman Empire, and then became part of the Byzantine (eastern) empire. The city's first large-scale destruction came from Huns and their allies. Towards the end of the 5th century, the Byzantines retook it. As Slavs and Serbs arrived in this Greek-dominated empire, it is logical that they called towns \\"Hellenic\\" (Greek). Another interpretation is that the term \\"damned Jerina\\" (prokleta Jerina) comes from the oldest Slavic fairy (vila) and that \\"damned\\" means condemned to eternal wandering in the ruins of the city.

V. Kumar under his banner Thirukumaran Entertainment and Fox Star Studios. It stars Vishnu Vishal and Nandita Swetha, with Kaali Venkat, Ramdoss, and Anandaraj in supporting roles. The film is set in the 1980s in a fictional village called Mundasupatti, where people believe bad luck will befall them if they are photographed. The story illustrates what happens when two photographers visit the village. It is based on a short film which was directed by Ram Kumar himself in 2011 for the TV show Naalaya Iyakunar. Principal photography commenced in August 2013, with Sathyamangalam being served as the primary location for the film. The shoot was completed within 57 days. The film's technical crew includes Sean Roldan as the music director, while cinematography and editing for the film were handled by P. V. Shankar and Leo John Paul respectively. Mundasupatti released on 13 June 2014 to positive critical response and became a hit at the box office.  Plot  Gopi (Vishnu Vishal), a Sathyamangalam-based photographer, and his assistant Alagumani (Kaali Venkat) arrive at a remote village called Mundasupatti on an assignment. The natives of this village are superstitious; they fear getting photographed, believing it will lead to death.  Cast  * Vishnu Vishal as Gopi * Nandita Swetha as Kalaivani * Kaali Venkat as Azhagumani * Ramdoss as Muniskanth * Anandaraj as Zamindar Ekambaram * Gajaraj as Kalaivani's father * Kovai Uma as Kalaivani's mother * Aadesh Bala as Shanmugam * Vinod Sagar as Mokkaiyan * Supergood Subramani as Priest * Winner Ramachandran  Production  Ram Kumar had shot about 10 short films for the TV show, Naalaya Iyakunar. When Kadhalil Sodhappuvadhu Yeppadi (a film developed from a short film) released, he said he was inspired to make his own film. He took a year off to work on the script and to select his actors. He called it a challenge to convert the script for a short film into a full- length one and stated that he had added new characters for the film version. Vishnu Vishal was cast for the lead role, with the director stating that he wanted \\"someone who is funny, but very subtly so\\". Vishnu, who had till then only played characters that were emotional, for the first time attempted a full-length comedy role, who felt it was \\"very refreshing\\" and added that \\"for the first time, I could relate to my character\\". Nandita Swetha was signed for the lead female role, and Ram said that he wanted \\"someone who is dusky\\" for the role of Kalaivaani, adding that he was impressed by her performance in Attakathi. Kaali Venkat who had been part of the original short film played the assistant to Vishnu's character. Ramdoss, seen in small roles previously, was given the role of an aspiring actor, a \\"fantastic role\\", according to him, that, he said, gave him \\"a lot of scope for acting\\". The filming started on 28 August 2013 and was completed by October 2013. The film was shot in 57 days, in Sathyamangalam, which has houses that are over a 100 years old. Vishnu's Hollywood Photo Studio was located at Nirmala Theatre Road, Sathyamangalam.  Soundtrack  The film's soundtrack was composed by independent musician Sean Roldan. It was the first film project he had signed on, although two of his soundtrack albums got released before the release of Mundasupatti. Sean Roldan had composed seven tracks for the film, besides singing three of them. The lyrics for the songs were written by Muthamil and GKB. The soundtrack album was launched along with the film's trailer on 9 May 2014 at the Suryan FM 93.5 Radio Station, Chennai. The songs as well as the score received very positive feedback by critics. Behindwoods gave it 3.25 out of 5 stars and called it \\"one of the most enterprising albums of this year\\". Musicaloud.com gave it a score of 8.5 out of 10 and wrote, \\"There seems to be no stopping Sean Roldan\\". Rediff wrote, \\"Sean Roldan's rustic songs and background score are definitely the highlights of the film, especially the folk styled Rasa Maharasa and the beautiful melody Idhu Enna\\". Deccan Chronicle wrote, \\"The [other] standout of the film was Sean Roldan's background and music. His catchy but affectionate songs fit very well with the clayey tones of the film ‚Äì which is to say that they mould and reshape the landscape in lieu with the plot\\". Milliblog reviewed \\"Like Santhosh Narayanan, Sean Roldan is truly on a roll with his inventive spin on conventional Tamil film music.\\" The Rare Field reviewed as \\"Composer Sean Roldan hits the bulls-eye yet again, and with Mundasupatti, he has a hat-trick on his hands!\\"  Release  The satellite rights of the film were sold to STAR Vijay. To promote the film the makers had created an interactive application on the website, www.mymundasupattistyle.com that allowed visitors to create their own avatars akin to characters from Mundasupatti. The idea was well received and had gone viral on the social networking sites. A special screening of Mundasupatti was arranged for distributors and exhibitors couple of days prior to the release. Subsequently, the film opened across nearly 207 screens in Tamil Nadu, which was considered \\"very high for a Vishnu film\\". The film released on 13 June 2014 alongside five other Tamil releases, but according to Sify.com, it got \\"the best of screens and prime shows in multiplexes\\".  Reception = Critical reception  The film received generally positive feedback from critics.https://www.ibtimes.co.in/mundasupatti-review-roundup-fun-filled- entertainer-602226 The Times of India gave 3.5 stars out of 5 and wrote, \\"Director Ram Kumar, who is the latest promising find from the TV show Naalaya Iyakkunar, certainly knows how to end a joke with a punchline. The film is a tad overlong ... and some of the comedy feels repetitive but Ram Kumar manages to keep things playful and entertaining at all times ... that we look past some of the indulgences\\". Sify.com wrote, \\"Mundasupatti is a rip-roaring rocker! It is a full length laugh riot which is fresh and entertaining. The wacky story and treatment of debutant director Ram Kumar, makes it tickling and an absolute fun ride\\". Deccan Chronicle gave 3.5 out of 5 and wrote, \\"They say that a tragedy today is bound to be a comedy tomorrow ‚Äì an unfortunate incident, a set of beliefs to explain that incident, and the culture of fear and superstition that this broods are all probable misnomers that we all will look back at and have a mighty laugh. Take it a step further by adding situational comedy to an initial tragedy and what we have is a film that succeeds in many levels with the possible muse of timing and pacing\\". Silverscreen.in wrote, \\"Mundasupatti is set in the 80s. Fascinatingly so. It is perhaps a bizarrely comical version of a Stephen Leacock essay, but fashionably vintage and very Indian\\". The New Indian Express wrote, \\"the debutant director has lived up to the expectations, establishing his credentials with his very first effort. The plot is refreshing, the screenplay engaging, the dialogue sparkling with wit and humour. The director moves his narration deftly and with confidence. Mundasupatti with no big names to boast of, yet again proves it. It's a film not to be missed\\". Baradwaj Rangan wrote, \\"I wish more had been done with the central conceit. This is not a lazy film by any stretch. But a comedy should be light on its feet. Linger too much, and it can begin to seem out of focus\\". Behindwoods gave it 3 stars out of 5 and wrote, \\"Mundasupatti could have used some trimming as it gets slightly tedious at times but the feeling while coming out, is one of satisfaction. This debut offering from director Ram Kumar has turned out to be a worthy product from the CV Kumar ‚Äì Fox Star Studios camp\\" and concluded that the film is \\"A feel- good comedy entertainer\\". Indiaglitz gave 3 out of 5 and wrote, \\"though being predictable, this one glues you to the seat for an enjoyable two and half hours. Revolving entirely around the sentiments attached to camera, with a young and vibrant crew, the film is a thorough entertainer\\". Rediff.com gave it 2.5 out of 5 stars and called the film \\"an entertaining rom-com\\" and \\"a decent attempt by debutant D Ram Kumar\\", but criticized that \\"the narration is extremely slow paced and the film too long, taking away some of the fun\\". OneIndia gave 2.5 out of 5 and concluded, \\"Mundasupatti is a fun-filled drama. Entertains at first watch\\". The Hindustan Times gave 2.5 out of 5 and concluded, \\"Mundasupatti has some delightful moments of freshness to offer\\". Rajasekar S, from Cinemalead called Mundasupatti as a long and tiring ride, rating it at a half baked 2.5 out of 5.  Box office  Mundasupatti collected 3.1 crore in its opening weekend in Tamil Nadu, which was the highest ever opening for a C V Kumar film.The film collected in Chennai in first weekend.

He excels in his game and turns out to be a star player. Seeing his performances, a local cricket club offers him a chance to join and train with them, for which his father disagrees saying that his academic performance is poor due to cricket and he may not get a job in future.

Then comes the tournament that selects the players for the Tamil Nadu Ranji Trophy team and as expected both Jeeva and Ranjith get selected. But the real trouble starts after joining the Team. The Tamil Nadu team mostly comprises players from a particular community and since Jeeva and Ranjith are from a different community, they are sidelined for most of the games. They are given chances in tough conditions where it's hard to score more runs. But still they manage to put up a decent performance. Jeeva even once gets applauded by the Captain of the Rajasthan team, who is a veteran national team member.

He is extremely happy as his coach tells that if he performs well in the CPL, he can directly enter the National team. Jeeva Runs home with tears of joy. The story comes back to the present, where Jeeva actually gives interview to TV channels, as a star player of the national cricket team. He narrates his experience on his debut CPL match, where he smashes the very first ball he faces for a sixer, and he puts up a great performance time and again which seals his place in the national team. Jeeva ends his interview by saying that \\"in other countries, players lose by playing; But only in India, the players lose even without getting a chance to participate\\".

The film titled Veera Dheera Sooran was said to be an original story, to be made simultaneously in Tamil and Telugu. In early 2012, it was reported that director Pandiraj would write the film's dialogues. However the director opted to concentrate on other projects before starting the film. He subsequently began a different project with Vishnu and production work on the film began again in August 2013. The project initially began as a bilingual, with Sundeep Kishan selected to portray the lead role in the Telugu version, but scheduling problems meant that the version was dropped.http://www.thehindu.com/entertainment/movies/suseenthiran-talks-about- nenjil-thunivirundhal-sundeep-kishan-and-vikrams- rajapattai/article19981479.ece Sri Divya was signed on to play a college girl in the film after the director was impressed with her performance in Varuthapadatha Valibar Sangam. Surabhi, who debuted in Ivan Veramathiri was signed as another heroine. She had to opt out later due to conflicting schedules. Vinoth Kishan was initially signed to play a supporting role, but was later replaced by Lakshman Narayan, who had played the lead role in Bharathiraja's Annakodi (2013). The title of the film was officially announced to be Jeeva in January 2014. Soundtrack The film's score and soundtrack are composed by D. Imman under Sony Music India's label. The film notably had its songs' lyrics written by Vairamuthu and his two sons Madhan Karky and Kabilan Vairamuthu, becoming the first such album to have the trio from the same family. A launch event was held on 12 September 2014. Track list=Release Actors Vishal Reddy's Vishal Film Factory and Arya's The Show People banner bought Tamil Nadu theatrical rights of the film in September 2014. The satellite rights of the film were sold to STAR Vijay. The film was released on 27 September 2014 Reception The film was released to positive reviews. The Times of India gave the film 3 stars out of 5 and wrote, \\"Suseenthiran pads up the film with the tropes that the genre needs. Though it has its heart in the right place the problem with Jeeva is that it is uneven. Cricket takes a backseat every time the director decides to focus on the love angle, taking some fizz out of the film\\". The Hindu wrote, \\"A film has stayed true to its soul if it replays in your mind long after you‚Äôve left the theatre. In most parts, Jeeva does that\\". Indo-Asian News Service gave 3 stars out of 5 and wrote, \\"Jeeva is gripping with a moving second half, but not as inspiring as Nagesh Kukunoor's Bollywood film Iqbal. Suseenthiran's desperate act to portray his film as a commercial entertainer and not as a sports-drama doesn't go down too well. It somehow distracts you from the film's core subject and that's a big letdown. If only these crucial comprises were handled with care, the film would've been highly satisfying\\". Sify wrote, \\"Jeeva is sure to provide inspiration to many youngsters with similar cricket dreams and aspirations...it is a nice entertaining film, and another feather on the director's cap\\".

A limited film production goes on North Italy. Vivere ancora, began by Leo Longanesi in Rome the last year, is completed in Turin by Francesco de Robertis.

In Rome, Vittorio De Sica directs The gates of heaven, produced by the Vatican.

On February 1, 1733, the King of Poland and Grand Duke of Lithuania Augustus II the Strong died in Warsaw, leaving the Polish-Lithuanian Commonwealth without a monarch. Another royal election was necessary. This time, the Polish ‚Äì Lithuanian nobility firmly opposed a foreign candidate, such as Portuguese Duke Infante Manuel, Count of Ourem, who was supported by the Russian Empire and the Habsburg Empire (see Treaty of the Three Black Eagles). During the Convocation Sejm (June 1733), the Primate of Poland, interrex Teodor Potocki suggested that no foreign candidacy should even be considered in the election. This motion was accepted by two most powerful magnate families: the Potocki family and the Czartoryski family. Furthermore, the conservative Roman Catholic nobility banned Protestants from all public offices. In the light of these events, former King Stanis≈Çaw I Leszczy≈Ñski emerged as the most obvious candidate. Leszczy≈Ñski himself was not well- remembered in the Commonwealth, as during his reign (1704‚Äì1709) he was a puppet of the Swedish Empire, and left the Commonwealth after the Battle of Poltava. In 1725, his daughter Marie married Louis XV of France, and became Queen consort of France and Navarre. As a result of this marriage, Leszczy≈Ñski‚Äôs popularity among the Polish nobility was widespread, as there were hopes that his election would elevate the international position of Poland, and end internal arguments within the Commonwealth. At the same time, courts in Vienna, St. Petersburg and Berlin opposed the pro-French Leszczy≈Ñski, fearing that it would strengthen the Kingdom of France. In July 1733, Leszczy≈Ñski appeared in Versailles, and soon afterwards, France assembled a naval force, which was to transport the Pole from Brest to Gda≈Ñsk. These preparations, however, were a ruse of Cardinal Andre-Hercule de Fleury, who did not want to risk a conflict with England. Therefore, Leszczy≈Ñski, disguised as a merchant named Ernest Bromback, accompanied by French Army officer Dandelot, reached Poland by land, after a trip through Germany. On September 12, 1733, the nobility, gathered in Wola near Warsaw, elected Leszczy≈Ñski new king of Poland. In the popular vote, he received the support of 13,500 electors. This news was received in Paris with joy, but soon after the election, the new king had to flee to Gda≈Ñsk, where he awaited French military assistance. Leszczy≈Ñski feared a 30,000 strong Russian army, which entered the Commonwealth in early August. The Russians organized a separate royal election (October 5), with only 1,000 electors, who voted for Augustus III, the son of Augustus II the Strong. These events marked the beginning of a major European conflict, known as War of the Polish Succession. A civil war also broke out in the Commonwealth. Russian army captured Krak√≥w, where Augustus III was crowned on January 17, 1734. Eventually, Russian and Saxon armies defeated the supporters of Leszczy≈Ñski (see Siege of Danzig (1734)), and in 1736, the Pacification Sejm confirmed the accession of Augustus III to the Polish throne.

Pointer jumping allows an algorithm to follow paths with a time complexity that is logarithmic with respect to the length of the longest path. It does this by \\"jumping\\" to the end of the path computed by neighbors. The basic operation of pointer jumping is to replace each neighbor in a pointer structure with its neighbor's neighbor. In each step of the algorithm, this replacement is done for all nodes in the data structure, which can be done independently in parallel. In the next step when a neighbor's neighbor is followed, the neighbor's path already followed in the previous step is added to the node's followed path in a single step. Thus, each step effectively doubles the distance traversed by the explored paths. Pointer jumping is best understood by looking at simple examples such as list ranking and root finding.  List ranking  One of the simpler tasks that can be solved by a pointer jumping algorithm is the list ranking problem. This problem is defined as follows: given a linked list of nodes, find the distance (measured in the number of nodes) of each node to the end of the list. The distance is defined as follows, for nodes that point to their successor by a pointer called : * If is , then . * For any other node, . This problem can easily be solved in linear time on a sequential machine, but a parallel algorithm can do better: given processors, the problem can be solved in logarithmic time, , by the following pointer jumping algorithm: * Allocate an array of integers. * Initialize: for each processor/list node , in parallel: ** If , set . ** Else, set . * While any node has : ** For each processor/list node , in parallel: *** If : **** Set . **** Set . The pointer jumping occurs in the last line of the algorithm, where each node's pointer is reset to skip the node's direct successor. It is assumed, as in common in the PRAM model of computation, that memory access are performed in lock-step, so that each memory fetch is performed before each memory store; otherwise, processors may clobber each other's data, producing inconsistencies. The following diagram follows how the parallel list ranking algorithm uses pointer jumping for a linked list with 11 elements. As the algorithm describes, the first iteration starts initialized with all ranks set to 1 except those with a null pointer for . The first iteration looks at immediate neighbors. Each subsequent iteration jumps twice as far as the previous. An example of performing the parallel pointer jumping technique to compute list ranking. Analyzing the algorithm yields a logarithmic running time. The initialization loop takes constant time, because each of the processors performs a constant amount of work, all in parallel. The inner loop of the main loop also takes constant time, as does (by assumption) the termination check for the loop, so the running time is determined by how often this inner loop is executed. Since the pointer jumping in each iteration splits the list into two parts, one consisting of the \\"odd\\" elements and one of the \\"even\\" elements, the length of the list pointed to by each processor's is halved in each iteration, which can be done at most time before each list has a length of at most one.  Root finding  Following a path in a graph is an inherently serial operation, but pointer jumping reduces the total amount of work by following all paths simultaneously and sharing results among dependent operations. Pointer jumping iterates and finds a successor ‚Äî a vertex closer to the tree root ‚Äî each time. By following successors computed for other vertices, the traversal down each path can be doubled every iteration, which means that the tree roots can be found in logarithmic time. Pointer doubling operates on an array \`successor\` with an entry for every vertex in the graph. Each \`successor[i]\` is initialized with the parent index of vertex \`i\` if that vertex is not a root or to \`i\` itself if that vertex is a root. At each iteration, each successor is updated to its successor's successor. The root is found when the successor's successor points to itself. The following pseudocode demonstrates the algorithm. algorithm Input: An array parent representing a forest of trees. parent[i] is the parent of vertex i or itself for a root Output: An array containing the root ancestor for every vertex for i ‚Üê 1 to length(parent) do in parallel successor[i] ‚Üê parent[i] while true for i ‚Üê 1 to length(successor) do in parallel successor_next[i] ‚Üê successor[successor[i if successor_next = successor then break for i ‚Üê 1 to length(successor) do in parallel successor[i] ‚Üê successor_next[i] return successor The following image provides an example of using pointer jumping on a small forest. On each iteration the successor points to the vertex following one more successor. After two iterations, every vertex points to its root node. Pointer jumping: example execution  History and examples  Although the name pointer jumping would come later, J√°J√° attributes the first uses of the technique in early parallel graph algorithms and list ranking. The technique has been described with other names such as shortcutting, but by the 1990s textbooks on parallel algorithms consistently used the term pointer jumping. Today, pointer jumping is considered a software design pattern for operating on recursive data types in parallel. As a technique for following linked paths, graph algorithms are a natural fit for pointer jumping. Consequently, several parallel graph algorithms utilizing pointer jumping have been designed. These include algorithms for finding the roots of a forest of rooted trees, connected components, minimum spanning trees, and biconnected components. However, pointer jumping has also shown to be useful in a variety of other problems including computer vision, image compression, and Bayesian inference.

Most often that purpose is to commit financial fraud, such as by obtaining loans or credits in the name of the person whose identity has been stolen. Stolen identifying information might also be used for other reasons, such as to obtain identification cards or for purposes of employment by somebody not legally authorized to work in the United States. According to a United States Department of Justice study, in 2012 the direct and indirect cost of identity theft was estimated to be responsible for financial losses of $24.7 billion, approximately twice the $14 billion total cost of other property crimes. By 2014, losses to identity theft decreased to $15.4 billion, mostly due to a reduction in the number of high- value losses (the top 10% of cases). By 2016, the estimated cost of identity theft increased to $16 billion. In 2012, identity theft affected approximately 16.6 million people, approximately 7% of the U.S. population aged 16 or older. In 2014, identity theft affected approximately 17.6 million people, again approximately 7% of the U.S. adult population. In 2014 it was estimated that approximately one third of Americans affected by a data breach ended up becoming a victim of financial fraud in 2013, an increase from one ninth in 2010. When an existing credit card is exposed and then used for fraud, the average estimated loss is $1,251. When a Social Security number is exposed and then used to open new accounts, the average estimated loss increases to $2,330. In 2015, a private study performed by Javelin suggested that incidents of identity theft remained steady from 2014, and that the losses associated with each instance of identity theft had decreased slightly. Tax fraud In 2012, identity theft was blamed for $4 billion of fraudulent tax refunds by the Internal Revenue Service (IRS) and 770,000 taxpayers have been the victims of tax identity theft by 2013. A public-private initiative by the IRS and employers in 2016 resulted in a 50% drop in incidents of taxpayer identity theft reports. In Calendar Year 2016, the IRS stopped 883,000 confirmed identity theft returns.https://www.irs.gov/newsroom/prepared-remarks-of- commissioner-john-koskinen-at-the-security-summit-press-briefing- october-17-2017 Medical identity theft Medical identity theft involves the use of somebody else's identity or insurance information to obtain healthcare, or to bill for healthcare services that are not actually provided. It is estimated that medical identify theft can be more lucrative than credit card theft. At one black-market auction a patient's medical record sold for $251, while credit card records sold for 33 cents. Due to the ability of hackers to access customer data from large health insurance companies, concerns have been raised that health care companies are not doing enough to protect customer's financial and health data. Data breaches For purposes of identity theft, data breaches involve the unauthorized access of consumer data contained on computer systems, with the data being potentially subject to use for purposes of identity theft. The Identity Theft Resource Center said there were 662 data breaches in the United States in 2010, almost a 33% increase from the previous year. Between January, 2015 and September, 2017, the Identity Theft Resource Center estimates that there were 7,920 breaches affecting more than one billion records that could lead to identity theft. Incidents On May 5, 2011, Michaels, a craft store chain, sent an email alert to its customers revealing that its debit card terminals in 20 states had been compromised. Customers who made PIN-based purchases between February 8 and May 6, 2011 may have had their data exposed. A class action lawsuit was filed against Michaels in the county court of Passaic, New Jersey over the incident. On January 25, 2014, Michaels warned of a possible second hacking of its customers' data and urged shoppers to keep an eye on their card statements for fraudulent activity. On April 17, 2014, Michaels confirmed a security breach at some of Michaels' stores and subsidiary Aaron Brothers from May 8, 2013 to February 27, 2014. Between July and September 2011, a $13 million scam resulted in the arrest of 111 people. The scammers used skimming devices to swipe consumer credit card information at retail or food establishments. According to the Federal Trade Commission losses from identity theft in the United States cost about $1.52 billion in 2011. It is estimated that the IRS gave identity thieves $5 billion in refunds. In 2012, about 40 million sets of payment card information were compromised by a hack of Adobe Systems.Skimming Off the Top; Why America has such a hiugh rate of payment-card fraud, 15 February 2014, The Economist On February 15, 2013, Rep. Debbie Wasserman Schultz (D, FL-23) introduced the Stopping Tax Offenders and Prosecuting Identity Theft Act of 2013 (H.R. 744; 113th Congress) into the United States House of Representatives. The bill would increase the penalties on identity thieves in the United States and change the definition of identity theft to include businesses and organizations instead of just individuals. Large U.S. corporations, such as Target Corporation, Home Depot, Neiman Marcus and Barnes & Noble, have been in the news after their credit card system was hacked. In 2014, a malware intrusion at Staples resulted in a credit card breach. 119 stores were impacted between April and September 2014, and 1.16 million customer credit and debit cards may have been stolen. In October 2014, President Barack Obama announced that debit cards that transmit federal benefits like Social Security to Americans will be equipped with a security chip replacing the magnetic strip. The U.S. government will also apply the security chips and personal identification numbers (PIN), to replace signatures of all government credit cards. The measure is expected to reduce fraud. USA Today reported that an estimated 100 million people having been affected by breaches in 2014. In November 2014, Sony Pictures Entertainment suffered a data breach. On December 18, 2014, employees of Sony filed a class action lawsuit against their employer claiming that Sony failed to take necessary actions to secure its employees personal information. The lawsuit was filed in U.S. District Court for the Central District of California . In 2015, there were 781 recorded data breaches in the United States, which compromised the security of over 169 million records. The frequency and severity of data breaches has led forty-seven states to pass security breach notification laws, to ensure that citizens are notified in a timely manner when their records have been exposed.

Originally the Briarcliff Yacht and Golf Club, a nine-hole golf course constructed in 1968, it was purchased by country music singer-songwriter Willie Nelson in 1979. After the purchase, Nelson constructed a studio on the complex, designed by Chips Moman. The first recording on the studio was Nelson's release Tougher Than Leather and his collaboration with Merle Haggard Pancho and Lefty. In 1991, the club was auctioned following Nelson's debt with the Internal Revenue Service. The country club was originally purchased by Nelson's friend Darrell K Royal for safekeeping, but soon the IRS refunded Royal the money upon learning of the operation and resold the property to an Austin investor. With the help of a friend, Nelson retrieved the club the following year, upon agreeing to a higher payment. Throughout the years, Nelson has recorded several of his releases in the studio. History The nine-hole golf course and buildings were designed by Frank Howard, who constructed the complex in 1968 as the \\"Briarcliff Yacht and Golf Club\\". The country club was constructed near Lake Travis, thirty miles west of Austin. By 1977, country music singer-songwriter Willie Nelson placed a bid on the bankrupt club, which was surpassed by another purchaser. Soon after, the development projects of the higher bidder were abandoned, and Nelson ultimately purchased the club for US$250,000 in 1979. The following year, Nelson built a 54,000 square foot cabin; while he placed his family, musicians and roadies in the adjacent existing condominiums of the club. He hired Nashville producer Chips Moman to turn the restaurant and clubhouse into a private recording studio. Moman soon conditioned it to be a 48-track facility, with the works finished in six months. Nelson recorded for the debut of the studio his release Tougher Than Leather, followed Webb Pierce, Roger Miller and Merle Haggard, who respectively cut records on the first days of the facility. In 1985, Nelson and Haggard recorded the album Pancho and Lefty. In 1991, when Nelson's assets were sized by the Internal Revenue Service, the country club was auctioned. To avoid the club being sold to an unknown person, Nelson's friend, coach Darrell K Royal, persuaded Jim Bob Moffett, a supporter of the Texas Longhorns football program to lend him the US$117,000 that the IRS requested for the ranch. Moffett gave Royal the money, who was supposed to receive the club after the 120 days of the \\"right of redemption\\" by the IRS were over. Upon realizing that Royal bought the club for safekeeping, the IRS broke the deal, refunding him the money with a six percent interest. The country club was resold in May, and purchased by James Noryian of the company Investors International for US$230,000. The recording studio was auctioned separately from the club, and purchased by Nelson's nephew Freddy Fletcher. In 1992, with the help Johnny Herrington, an entrepreneur of Branson, Missouri, Nelson purchased the country club back from Noryian for US$470,000 to be paid in a period of three years. Over the years, several of Nelson's releases were recorded on the studio, including Six Hours at Pedernales, Spirit, Rainbow Connection, Remember Me, Vol. 1 and Heroes, Let's Face the Music and Dance, Band of Brothers and December Day.

Designed in 1865 by architect Horatio Nelson Goulty, it replaced an earlier building called the Norfolk Inn and is one of several large Victorian hotels along the seafront. The French Renaissance Revival- style building, recalling E.M. Barry's major London hotels, is \\"tall, to make a show\\": the development of the passenger lift a few years earlier allowed larger hotels to be built. It is a Grade II listed building. History West Street formed the western limit of development in Brighton until the end of the 18th century. At that time, the town was growing from a small fishing and agricultural settlement into a fashionable seaside resort. From 1800 on, seafront land that was formerly part of the West Laine was sold off in parcels to speculative builders. Some large-scale residential development took place, but it was only after 1820‚Äîwhen the road running parallel to the beach was widened and straightened to form a seafront promenade called Kings Road‚Äîthat the area became easily accessible. The hotels, lodging houses and inns built along this stretch of road became the most popular and exclusive in the town at that time. This view of the side elevation shows the elaborate mansard roofs, taken from Embassy Court. The hotel occupies a prominent position on Brighton seafront, near Embassy Court and the stuccoed terraces of Brunswick Town. An inn and hotel called the Norfolk Arms was built west of Bedford Square in or before 1824‚Äîthe year it was first listed in the Baxter's Directory of Brighton. (The square itself, the second such development in Brighton, was built in stages between 1801 and 1818.) Between 1828 and 1830, the inn became famous for its association with Edward Law, 1st Earl of Ellenborough and his wife Jane Digby, Lady Ellenborough; in 1830 there was a scandal when they divorced as a result of Lady Ellenborough's affair with Prince Felix of Schwarzenberg. Brighton!! A Comic Sketch, a poem written in that year, referred to the building satirically: \\"But ladies, use, when you next come / The Schwarzenberg Hotel\\". By 1841, though, its reputation was restored: a guidebook described it as \\"a capital family hotel, which has long enjoyed the patronage of many persons of rank and distinction\\". Architecturally, it had Classical overtones: Ionic columns supported a balcony and veranda across a four-storey central bay with three-storey flanking sections. The 1860s was a time of innovation in hotel building and architecture. By the mid-19th century, staying in hotels had become much more popular than renting a large house for several months, which had been the norm for Brighton's wealthy visitors over the previous century. The Royal Albion and (original) Bedford Hotels of the 1820s were smaller-scale early examples, but only with the development of the passenger lift could they be built on a grand scale. One of Britain's first lifts‚Äîa water-powered \\"ascending omnibus\\", as it was called‚Äîwas fitted in the newly built Grand Hotel on Kings Road in 1864. The following year, the Norfolk Arms was completely rebuilt, retaining nothing of its original form. Architect Horatio Nelson Goulty was commissioned for the job; an important figure in public life in Brighton, he was one of the founders of the Extra Mural Cemetery in 1850 and later in the 1860s designed Congregational churches in Newhaven and Hove. Goulty designed the building (now solely a hotel rather than an inn, and renamed the Norfolk Hotel accordingly) in a similar style to the Grand, albeit \\"slightly more florid\\". The author of Moorecroft's Guide (1866), a guidebook about the resort, called the rebuilt hotel \\"more beautiful than any other building in Brighton\\" despite offering mild criticism of the Grand's very similar architecture. As originally built, the Norfolk was much smaller than the Grand, with 64 bedrooms arranged over five floors compared to the latter's 150 bedrooms and eight storeys. Nevertheless, it was one of the major hotels of Victorian-era Brighton, which is \\"one of the few places in Britain where ... grand hotels of the European model can be seen\\". Along with the Grand and the nearby Metropole (1890), it was one of the \\"great show hotels on the front\\", at which only wealthy visitors would have stayed; the thousands of working-class holidaymakers would have used the poorer lodging-houses in less favourable locations. The building passed into the ownership of AVP Industries in the 20th century. The company sought permission to demolish it and replace it with flats in the 1960s, but after this was not granted it sold the hotel in 1969. Under the name Norfolk Resort Hotel, the building was listed at Grade II on 20 August 1971. Early in the 1980s, ¬£2 million was spent on refurbishment, including the opening of an indoor swimming pool and the creation of a lake surrounded by additional rooms, both in 1985. A nightclub called Rafters also occupied the roof space at this time. The hotel was later taken on by the Ramada Jarvis chain. It still had that identity in 2010, but after the company went into liquidation the Accor hotel group acquired it in October 2011 as part of a deal to buy 24 former Ramada Jarvis hotels. These were rebranded under the Mercure name, and the Norfolk Hotel is now known as the Mercure Brighton Seafront Hotel. Architecture The windows have segmental arches. Those below the central mansard roof are set in a columned arcade. Horatio Nelson Goulty designed the Norfolk Hotel in the French Renaissance Revival style, \\"perhaps to compete with the Grand\\" which, although larger, is similar in appearance. Closest in style to the Norfolk, though, were two contemporary hotels at major London railway stations that were designed by E.M. Barry: the Cannon Street Hotel (1861) and the Charing Cross Hotel (1864). The new building was taller than its predecessor, with five storeys and three large mansard roofs decorated with wrought ironwork. The south-facing fa√ßade is stuccoed, and its windows are set in segmental-arched architraves with prominent keystones. The ground floor projects and is enclosed by a modern glazed lobby area. The main entrance has Corinthian columns on each side, supporting an entablature which in turn supports a balcony spanning the whole of the first floor. Individual cast iron balconies in the same style are set in front of each window at second- and third-floor level. The fa√ßade is of seven bays treated as a symmetrical 2‚Äì3‚Äì2 composition in which the central three bays project slightly and are flanked by pilasters. These three bays also rise to a taller height than the other sections by means of a sixth storey which has six narrow segmental-arched windows in the form of an arcade formed by engaged columns. Norfolk Hotel, the cantilevered four-storey staircase Little original work survives inside. There is cantilevered four- storey staircase with balusters made of cast iron and decorated with monograms (viz \\"NH\\") and openwork. The original \\"ascending omnibus\\" lift was part of the same structure; the gates survive. Near the staircase is a glazed dome with arabesque patterns. To the rear of the hotel, the land redeveloped in 1985 with an ornamental lake and new rooms replaced a garage which had been built on the site of some livery stables. A 19th-century arched gateway survives from this, leading from the hotel into Norfolk Buildings (a short street); it has a black-painted horse's head on the keystone and the inscription . Facilities As originally built in 1865, the Norfolk Hotel had 64 or 65 bedrooms. Extensions over the years have brought the total as of to 117. Three are suitable for wheelchair users, and all are non-smoking. All rooms have flat-screen televisions and Wi-Fi internet access; additional facilities in higher-priced rooms include newspapers, bathrobes, coffee machines and free films. There is 24-hour room service, a 24-hour bar (The Brasserie Bar) and a restaurant (The Brasserie).

It was famous for its Chelsea bun and also did a great trade in hot cross buns at Easter. It was patronised by royalty such as Kings George II, George III and their family. History It was on Jew's Row, by Grosvenor Row, on the main road from Pimlico to Chelsea, near Ranelagh Gardens. It seems to have started business early in the 18th century as Jonathan Swift wrote in his journal to Stella on 28 April 1711: > A fine day, but begins to grow a little warm; and that makes your little fat > Presto sweat in the forehead. Pray, are not the fine buns sold here in our > town; was it not Rrrrrrrrrare Chelsea buns? I bought one to-day in my walk; > it cost me a penny; it was stale, and I did not like it, as the man said, > &c.; Over a hundred years later, Sir Richard Phillips wrote in A Morning's Walk from London to Kew: > Before me appeared the shops so famed for Chelsea buns, which, for above > thirty years, I have never passed without filling my pockets. In the > original of these shops, for even of Chelsea buns there are counterfeits, > are preserved mementos of domestic events, in the first half of the past > century.

These buns > have afforded a competency, and even wealth; to four generations of the same > family; and it is singular, that their delicate flavour, lightness and > richness, have never been successfully imitated. The present proprietor told > me, with exultation, that George the Second had often been a customer of the > shop; that the present King, when Prince George, and often during his reign, > had stopped and purchased his buns; and that the Queen, and all the Princes > and Princesses, had been among his occasional customers. The family to which he referred was the Hand family who had succeeded David Loudon as proprietors. Richard Hand was known as \\"Captain Bun\\". His wife, Mrs. Hand, ran the business after his death. Queen Caroline, who had brought her children there, presented Mrs. Hand with a silver mug containing five guineas. Upon her death, her son ran the business and he also supplied butter to local customers. When he died too, his older brother took over. He was a retired soldier ‚Äî a poor knight of Windsor ‚Äî and, like his brother, was eccentric. There were no more Hands so, on his death in 1839, the property reverted to the Crown and the contents were auctioned off. Easter On Good Friday, it was a tradition for the working classes, such as servants and apprentices, to buy a hot cross bun. The Greenwich Fair was the most well-known Easter fair in London, but great crowds would also assemble on the Five Fields ‚Äî an open space which was subsequently developed as Eaton and Belgrave Squares to form Belgravia. The bun house would open for business as early as three or four in the morning and the crowds would press on it so fiercely that buns would only be sold through openings in the shutters. Constables were required to keep good order and, in 1792, the crowd was so great that Mrs Hand made a public announcement that there would be no sales of hot cross buns in the following year, > Royal Bun House, Chelsea, Good Friday No Cross Buns. Mrs. Hand respectfully > informs her friends and the public, that in consequence of the great > concourse of people which assembled before her house at a very early hour, > on the morning of Good Friday last, by which her neighbours (with whom she > has always lived in friendship and repute) have been much alarmed and > annoyed; it having also been intimated, that to encourage or countenance a > tumultuous assembly at this particular period might be attended with > consequences more serious than have hitherto been apprehended; desirous, > therefore, of testifying her regard and obedience to those laws by which she > is happily protected, she is determined, though much to her loss, not to > sell Cross Buns on that day to any person whatever, but Chelsea buns as > usual. This restraint did not last and so, on its final Good Friday of 1839, the bun house still sold a great number of buns ‚Äì over 24,000 according to The Mirror of Literature, Amusement, and Instruction. Literary references Anne Manning wrote a fictional account of the place in The Old Chelsea Bun-House: a Tale of the Last Century, which was published in 1855. > In short, our Milk and Whey became in such repute that we got on from two > Cows to six, and at length to Twelve, and had the largest Milk-walk in the > neighbourhood.

Sports Diplomacy uses sport to help youth around the world develop important off-the-court skills, including leadership, mutual understanding and academic achievement. The four pillars of the program include Sports Envoys, Sports Visitors, Sports Grants, and the Empowering Women and Girls through Sport Initiative. The program began in 2002 and has since reached thousands of participants in more than 140 countries. An overarching theme in most of Sports Diplomacy‚Äôs programming is disability sport access and inclusion.  History  The U.S. Department of State, through the SportsUnited division, restarted sports programming in 2002 with a grants competition focused on Muslim community outreach. In 2003 the State Department brought a group of Iraqi archers to the U.S. to compete in the World Archery Championship. The State Department implemented the first Sports Envoy program in 2005 through a partnership with the NBA and Reebok. In 2006, the ‚ÄúWorld Cup Sports Initiative‚Äù marked the first large-scale sport diplomacy effort of the nascent SportsUnited Division. The World Cup Sports Initiative brought to the U.S. 30 youth from 13 countries to participate in World Cup- related programming around the theme ‚ÄúA time to make friends.‚Äù The program culminated with a visit to Germany, where the group attended a World Cup match between the U.S. and the host country. Since then, Sports Diplomacy has involved more than 1500 athletes and coaches from over 140 countries in its programs. http://eca.state.gov/programs-initiatives/sports-diplomacy  Programs = Sports Envoys  The Sports Envoy program sends professional athletes overseas to conduct sport camps and engage in dialogue about important life lessons such as education, leadership, conflict resolution, and respect for diversity. Since 2005, the U.S. Department of State has sent nearly 300 Sports Envoys almost 70 countries including Afghanistan, Burma, Japan, and Venezuela. Past envoys include Michelle Kwan, Carl Ripken Jr., and Ken Griffey Jr. http://eca.state.gov/programs-initiatives/sports- diplomacy/sports-envoys-and-sports-visitors/sports-and-public-diplomacy  Sports Visitors  Sport Visitors are non-elite youth athletes and coaches who come to the U.S. for two weeks to participate in sport workshops and learn first-hand about American society and culture. The Sports Visitor program gives young people an opportunity to discover how success in athletics translates into the development of life skills and achievement in the classroom. Since 2003, Sports Diplomacy has brought more than 1,100 young athletes and coaches from 140 countries to the U.S. to participate in Sports Visitor programs.  Sports Grants  The Sports Grants program is an annual open grant competition for U.S.-based, non-profit organizations that work with sport and non-elite youth athletes, domestically and internationally. The grants support programs which address any of the following themes: Sport for Social Change, Sport and Health, and Sport and Disability.http://eca.state.gov/programs-initiatives/sports-diplomacy/sports- grants Between 2002 and 2012, the Sports Grants program has awarded nearly 90 grants to U.S. based non-profit organizations implementing programs in 60 countries. Previous grants recipients have included Partners of the Americas and Mobility International USA. http://www.miusa.org/resource/story/armeniahttp://www.partners.net/partners/NFL_Mexico.asp  Empowering Women and Girls through Sport Initiative  The Empowering Women and Girls through Sport Initiative was launched in February 2011 as a partnership between the U.S. Department of State and espnW. To increase the number of women and girls worldwide who are involved in sports, the Empowering Women and Girls Through Sports Initiative mobilizes all of the U.S. Department of State‚Äôs international sports programming, from Sports Envoys traveling overseas to Sports Visitors traveling to the United States. A cornerstone of this initiative is the Global Sports Mentoring Program which connects women and girls from around the globe with female executives in the sports sector. The 2012 Global Sports Mentoring Program included a diverse group of 17 participants. Between 2012 and 2014, women from 38 different countries have participated in these month-long mentorships, which culminate in an action plan for the mentee to implement in her home country.http://ewgts.wpengine.com/global-sports-mentoring-program/gsmp-2014/  Related organizations  Notable alumni  *Ruthie Bolton *Tamika Catchingshttp://proxy.espn.com/espnw/blog/post/4006/tamika-catchings-others- hold-clinics-young-girls-thailand *Brandi Chastain *Lorrie Fair *Julie Foudy *Michelle Kwan *Barry Larkin *Dikembe Mutombo *Sam Perkins *Cal Ripken *Tony Sanneh  References  External links  * http://eca.state.gov/programs- initiatives/sports-diplomacy * https://www.facebook.com/pages/Sports Diplomacy-US-Department-of-State/10150101343025475 Category:United States Department of State Category:Bureau of Educational and Cultural Affairs ","title":"SportsUnited"},{"id":"41027183","text":"Guy A.

The station was founded in April 2011 by Femi Adeyemi and produces a diverse range of live radio shows, digital media and live music based events. The Guardian described the radio as \\"somewhere between BBC 6 Music‚Äôs diversity and pirate radio‚Äôs DIY spirit\\" and has built a reputation for championing underground scenes and a leading voice in alternative culture. Music Business Worldwide reported in early 2020 that NTS has 1.5 million monthly listeners. NTS has live stations in London, Manchester, Los Angeles and Shanghai. According to the Institute of Contemporary Arts, \\"NTS Radio is a family of like-minded and passionate individuals, dedicated to supporting exciting music and culture through online radio and events. NTS uncovers the best of the musical past, celebrates the present and cultivates the future of the underground music scene, and prides itself on being open-minded and experimental\\". Origins The name NTS is an abbreviation for 'Nuts To Soup', which was the name of a previous blog run by Adeyemi. Adeyemi, who had also been involved in founding Boiler Room, started NTS on a budget of ¬£5,000, inspired by his love of pirate radio, MTV2, US college radio stations like WFMU and the creative community around London nightclub Plastic People (where NTS CEO Sean McAuliffe was a resident). In an interview with Music Business Worldwide in 2020, Adeyemi speaks of starting NTS as a response to a homogenous radio climate; ‚ÄúPirate radio stations were laser focused on specific sounds and the mainstream radio stations the same‚Ä¶ there are so many different tastes in London, why don‚Äôt we just set up this thing that plays everything? Let‚Äôs keep it as diverse as possible.‚Äù Programming and creative Across NTS two live channels, there are currently over 500 resident artists, music producers, DJs and record collectors globally that make up the regular shows on the platform, most of whom own share options in the company.

Every month, NTS curates live music experiences at the Tate Lates event series at the Tate Modern gallery in London - an event that is co-sponsored by clothing brand Uniqlo. NTS has an artist development programme called Work In Progress, which aims to take six artists to the next stages of their musical careers. Supported by Carhartt, Work In Progress is run in partnership with Arts Council England, and attracted over 9,000 applicants in its first year. In 2019, NTS teamed up with independent electronic indie label Warp Records to celebrate their thirtieth anniversary. Over a long weekend, Warp took over both of NTS‚Äô live channels, broadcasting over 100 hours of original content from the likes of Boards of Canada, Brian Eno, Flying Lotus, Death Grips, Ryuichi Sakamoto, Kelela and many more. Celebrated New York jazz record label Blue Note also co-programmed a takeover broadcast with NTS in celebration of their 80th anniversary, which featured radio shows hosted by Jeff Garlin, Dr Lonnie Smith and Don Was. NTS launched a capsule clothing collection with Adidas Originals during the summer of 2019, run under the NTS signature tag line of ‚ÄòDon‚Äôt Assume‚Äô. The marketing campaign for the collection featured musicians and artists as models, including reggae musician Lee \\"Scratch\\" Perry, who was 83-years-old at the time of the photoshoot. In September 2019 NTS and Netflix devised a two-day series of workshops and panels about getting into the creative industries, directed at 16-25 year olds in London. The event featured director Jenn Nkiru, Skepta manager Grace Ladoja, former NTS presenter Tiffany Calver and rap engineer Sean D, alongside Top Boy actors Ashley Walters and Micheal Ward. In January 2018, NTS collaborated with Jeff Mills, in partnership with NASA and the pioneering techno artist‚Äôs Axis record label, to produce a new six part radio series themed around space with original music from Mills, entitled The Outer Limits. In April 2018, Autechre announced a four-week residency on NTS that would go on to be the release of the cult electronic duo's thirteenth album release, NTS Sessions 1‚Äì4. It was not made known that the residency would include new material until after the first session was broadcast, leading many to assume that it would be another of the band's extended DJ mixes. A few days after the first session aired, Warp announced that each of the two-hour sessions would be released as a digital download immediately after broadcast, with 12-LP and 8-CD boxed sets of the entire album, as well as 3-LP pressings of each individual session, to be released in July, primarily through Bleep.com's Autechre store. On 19 February 2020, the Venezuelan experimental musician and artist Arca premiered their new 62-minute new single @@@@@ via a special NTS radio show entitled DIVA EXPERIMENTAL FM. The release was accompanied by a audiovisual directed by Frederik Heyman, and was then widely released on 21 February by XL Recordings. On 2 May 2020, NTS announced a 24-hour charity broadcast called Remote Utopias, raising funds for The Global Foodbanking Network.

As such matters are rarely certain, credit controllers control lending by calculating and managing risk. Overview Credit control is part of the financial controls that are employed by businesses particularly in manufacturing to ensure that once sales are made they are realised as cash or liquid resources. Credit control is a critical system of control that prevents the business from becoming illiquid due to improper and un-coordinated issuance of credit to customers. Credit control has a number of sections that include - credit approval, credit limit approval, dispatch approvals as well as collection process. In a large business a credit process will be run by a senior manager and will include processes as such as Know Your Customer (KYC), account opening, approval of credit and credit limits (both in terms of the amounts and the terms e.g. 30 Days, 30 Days net), extension of credit and effecting collection action. Credit control will normally report to the Finance Director or Risk Management Committee. Procedures for issuing credit During the selling process a potential customer or even a current customer who pays cash may request for credit lines to be extended. At this point the following process may be followed:- 1\\\\. Formal letter of application for credit to be extended to a customer entity 2\\\\. Head of Finance evaluates the credit requested 3\\\\. Risk managers evaluate if the credit fits in with the current risk portfolio 4\\\\. Credit Collection period (usually in Days) is considered both as a stand-alone and as a component of the working capital cycle in particular ensuring that it does not exceed the Payables Period (usually in Days too). 5\\\\. External rating agencies may be invoked to assess the risk attached to extending credit to the customer. Usually credit worthiness of a firm may be assessed independently by firms such as Dun & Bradstreet, Bloomberg, AC Nielsen or other reputable firms. 6\\\\. Fillers are also made into the market to assess the credit worthiness of a firm 7\\\\. An internal evaluation is made considering the risk of Bad or Doubtful Debts against the profit or returns. 8\\\\. After Risk Manager and Finance Director is satisfied that the extension of credit will not result in loss of principal. Credit is extended. 9\\\\. An account is opened with the credit setting set for the agreed terms: Cap of credit the customer will enjoy and the terms or duration which they will enjoy that credit. In other words, the time-limit as well as the value of the credit are sides of the same coin. Non- collectibility of extended credit Extended credit could, despite all efforts made, become noncollectable. In this case a professional Debt collection agency may be hired along with attendant legal, court and other fees. This event is normally dreaded and most Chartered Accountants are reluctant to consider that credit extended has now become noncollectable necessitating a debt write off if the receivable has gone bust or a provision if only a lower amount can ultimately be collected. Risk of credit Unwarranted debt may be a serious strain on the company and could lead to company failure. Many SMEs have failed due to unsatisfactory Debt Collection processes or procedures. During the credit crunch many businesses experienced a serious credit risk and severely curtailed extension of credit to partner firms and businesses. Even though the current situation is much less severe credit extension remains a key, pivotal role in business management.

It is endemic to the Western Ghats, India, where it is known from the states of Kerala and Tamil Nadu. Before its description in 2009, it was confused with Raorchestes femoralis and Raorchestes glandulosus. Description Raorchestes akroparallagi from Wynaad Male Raorchestes akroparallagi are small, in snout-vent length, whereas females are larger, long. It is one of predominantly green Raorchestes. However, the colouration of its dorsum (back) is highly variable even within a single location, from almost uniformly green to various colours and markings. Indeed, its specific name, akroparallagi, is derived from Greek words akro, meaning 'extreme' and parallagi, meaning 'variation'. Reproduction Raorchestes akroparallagi has direct development, with all growth inside the egg and no free-swimming tadpole stage. Males attract females with their calls. Mating takes place during the night. A pair in amplexus may move around before settling on a leaf and starting to lay eggs on its upper side. Egg laying takes hours and results in a clutch of 20‚Äì41 eggs. Eggs are white, about in diameter, and hatch after four weeks as fully developed froglets. There is no parental care. (N.b.

During the late 1970s, Chen Da became a voice of socio-cultural resistance against the Kuomintang (KMT) in the eyes of many supporters of the Tangwai movement, as the democracy movement was called. As a folk singer, he \\"has inspired a host of musicians ... in Taiwan.\\"  Early life = Early exposure to Hengchun folk music  Chen Da was born on May 12, 1906 in K≈çshun District (modern-day Hengchun), a rural district in southern Taiwan, then under Japanese rule.The registrar who documented the date of birth on the basis of the first post-WWI census recorded April 16, 1906, however. Other sources mention other years of birth, perhaps based on hear-say.See: \\"Chen Da\\" (biographical data), in: Musicians of Taiwan, (published by NCFTA), ibidem. As a child, he witnessed the repression of anti-colonial protests by the Japanese military in his area which resulted in many victims in 1914. This experience influenced him considerably. In 1917, due to poverty-related problems at home, he was sent away and lived with a married elder sister in the Taitung area, near the east coast, for a time. The eleven-year-old boy went to work in sugarcane plantations of the area, together with his sister's husband. It was then that he began to learn to sing Hengchun ballads. He returned to Hengchun in 1922.  A young street singer  In 1925, Chen Da started to sing Hengchun ballads in public together with his brothers, encouraged by the example of his elder brother who was already a professional folk singer. His intake used to consist of two or three bowls of boiled rice per day, and some small change. During the Great Depression which affected Japan and her colonies severely (and which also triggered the expansionist urges of Japanese capital and the aggressive course that the government embarked on by invading China), Chen Da's survival as a street singer became even more difficult. Chen Da suffered a brain stroke in 1934. From then on he could not use his hands and feet properly. His mouth remained slanted, and his eyesight was badly impaired. As a handicapped person, it was almost impossible for him to earn a living in any other way than by singing. His life as a street singer condemned him to extreme poverty.The fact that Chen Da's entire life was marked by dire poverty becomes apparent in several articles about him. Ho Yi writes for instance that \\"Chen lived most of his life in poverty...\\" See: Ho Yi, \\"A living folk legend remains true to his grassroots spirit,\\" in: The Taipei Times, Aug. 27, 2006, p.18.

Such poverty was, however, characteristic of the lives of the common people, most notably rent-paying peasants in rural districts.  The Post-war years  In the aftermath of World War II, Taiwan was handed over to Chinese rule. Chen Da continued his life as a street singer performing in the villages of remote districts of the rural south of Taiwan. It is not known how he reacted to the massacres of 1947 that came to be known as the February 28 Incident, or how he was affected by the subsequent years of White Terror. As a poor and physically handicapped street singer, Chen Da found it impossible to marry. He lived with a widowed woman from 1946 until 1948, however. After their separation, this woman, surnamed Xie, gave birth to his only son. In 1949, Chen Da lived at the east coast, in Taitung County. Here, he found another widow who was willing to live with him. Two years later, in 1951, the couple moved from Fugang Village (Peinan Hsiang, Taitung Hsien) to Hengchun Township. In the 1951, Chen Da performed for the first time in a local cultural program. He was joined by another folk singer, Zhang Xi (Èï∑ÊÉú). As a duo, they improvised Hengchun folk songs. Music scholars point out that Chen Da often improvised the lyrics.Jian, Shangren (2009); Shih, Weiliang (Âè≤ÊÉü‰∫Æ ) (ed.), (1971); Xu, Li-sha (=L.Hsu ÂæêÈ∫óÁ¥ó ) and L. Lin (Lin Liangzhe ÊûóËâØÂì≤) (2006). This was a common feature of Chinese folk ballad delivery. Various regional versions circulated and interpreters frequently changed the text, reacting both to given situations and the audience. Chen Da would also invent ballads spontaneously. For this reason, he has been referred to as a poet. While there existed much space for spontaneous variation or fresh creation with respect to the lyrics in Hengchun folk music (ÊÅÜÊò•Ê∞ëË¨† Hengch≈´n minyao), Chen Da ‚Äì like other folk singers ‚Äì used traditional tunes. The delivery of these tunes by the singer and the accompaniment on the yueqin or moon guitar was also marked by improvisation.Speaking of Chen Da's performances, P.-S. Tsai (Ëî°‰Ω©Áèä) notes his use of \\"Hengchun folk tunes (ÊÅÜÊò•Ê∞ëË¨† Hengch≈´n minyao)... coupled with improvised lyrics (ÈÖç‰∏äÂç≥ËààÊ≠åË©û p√®i sh√†ng j√≠x√¨ng gƒìc√≠).\\" See: Pei-Shan Tsai (C√†i P√®ishƒÅn Ëî°‰Ω©Áèä),\\"ÂæûÊ∞ëË¨†ÁúãÂè∞ÁÅ£Â•≥ÊÄßÁöÑÂ†ÖÈüåÔºç‰ª•„ÄäÈùíËöµ‰ªîÂ´Ç„ÄãÁÇ∫‰æã (C√≥ng m√≠ny√°o k√†n T√°iwƒÅn n«öx√¨ng de jiƒÅnr√®n --- y«ê \\"qƒ´ng h√©z«ê s«éo\\" w√©i l√¨ / Recognizing the tenacity of Taiwan's women in folk music --- \\"Qƒ´ng h√©z«ê s«éo / Green oyster Sister\\" as an example),\\" in: . (This is the online copy of a printed article.) As a singer, Chen Da was a story teller. Improvisation of the stories told by this ballad singer was both a result both of Chen Da's restless life as a wandering bard (thus Helen Rees) and of the fact that he confronted changing audiences and paid attention to the situation that existed while he was facing a specific audience. It reflected his awareness of the events that 'moved' people. But above all, it shows his rootedness in an oral tradition and his illiteracy which made it impossible to refer to and merely reproduce, in a slavishly 'faithful' manner, existing written lyrics. On the occasion of the traditional Mid-Autumn Festival in 1951, Chen Da was invited for the first time to take part in a ballad singing contest (Ê∞ëË¨†Ê≠åÂî±ÊØîË≥Ω). This contest took place at the Fu An Temple (Á¶èÂÆâÂÆÆ) in Checheng Village (ËªäÂüéÈÑâ). It was the first folk singing contests held at the Fuan Temple. Since 1951, it has taken place every year.Under Japanese occupation, temples were often hotbeds of political and cultural resistance. It cannot be excluded that in rural Southern Taiwan districts and perhaps all over Taiwan, they continued to perform this function, even though mildly and with utter caution, under the watchful eyes of the KMT-regime. For Chen Da, participation in the contest was a small breakthrough. Still, not everyone in South Taiwan respected him. Jen Shangren remarks that in the eyes of some local citizens, he was just a \\"beggar\\" performing in the streets, hoping to get a few mao (cents) in order to survive.Jen Shangren (Shang-Jen ChienÁ∞°‰∏ä‰ªÅ) writes that \\"he was only a 'beggar living on performance' in the eyes of ordinary people.\\" See: Jen Shangren, ibidem. Jen Shang-ren also notes, however, that Chen Da \\"received considerable acclaim from his audience and deeply touched them\\" when performing.Jen Shangren, ibidem.  The early and mid-1960s  Since 1960 until his death the folk singer lived alone, as the woman he had lived with since 1949 left him in that year. His domicile remained a simple, straw- thatched \\"hut at Shawei Road (Á†ÇÂ∞æË∑Ø ) in Hengchun Township\\" until his death in 1981. His biography says very little about Chen Da's life as a street singer in the early 1960s. White Terror and KMT rule had initimated large segments of the population since 1947. It chilled the atmosphere on the island and it is hardly possible that this did not have an effect on street performances. Both ways: it made singers and audiences careful and apprehensive, and it must have fanned veiled commentaries by a singer who is known to have commented, in his ballads, on social ills and historical injustice.See his ballad \\"The Gangkou Incident / Ah Yuan and Ah Fa ‚ÄìTragic story of a father and a son.\\" „ÄäÊ∏ØÂè£‰∫ã‰ª∂‚îÄÈòøÈÅ†ËàáÈòøÁôºÁà∂Â≠êÁöÑÊÇ≤ÊÖòÊïÖ‰∫ã„Äã(Gangkou shijian / A Yuan yu A Fa fuzi de beican gushi\\") ‚Äì according to a critic, a noteworthy \\"piece of Hengchun social realism.\\" This sly resistance, worthy of The Good Soldier ≈†vejk, a proverbial figure invented by the satirical writer Jaroslav Ha≈°ek, is even more likely in a social- cultural setting far from the cities, with an audience that consisted almost exclusively of non-Mainlanders who suffered from considerable discrimination under KMT-rule.  'Discovered' in 1967  The \\"White Terror\\" enacted in the wake of the massacres of 1947 receded somewhat in the second half of the 1960s. But being suspected could still mean death. Between the end of the Pacific War and the late 1960s, a considerable number of citizens were executed. The US Vice Consul in Taipei at the time of the February 28 Incident gives an estimate of 20,000 merely for the massacres in late February, 1947; others put that figure at 30,000. About 140,000 citizens received long prison sentences when suspected of opposition to the dictatorship of Generalissimo Chiang Kai-shek (Ëî£‰ªãÁü≥).Regarding this last figure, 140,000, see: G√ºnter Schubert and Axel Schneider, Taiwan an der Schwelle zum 21. Jahrhundert: Gesellschaftlicher Wandel, Probleme und Perspektiven eines asiatischen Schwellenlandes. Institut f√ºr Asienkunde, 1996, p.118. Regarding the White Terror, many US publications supply information. See for instance: Ming-sho Ho and Jeffrey Broadbent, Introduction to Taiwanese Society, Culture, and Politics. (Book publication, also online: http://homepage.ntu.edu.tw/~msho/book.files.B10.pdf) The trial and sentencing of the poet Bo Yang (ÊüèÊ•ä) in the spring of 1968 shows that there is no reason to talk of a 'liberalization' of the regime in this period. Apparently in retribution for cartoons drawn by him, Bo Yang, who was also a cartoonist and journalist, was imprisoned from March 7, 1968 to April 1, 1977 under extremely harsh conditions in the labor camp on Green Island, Taiwan ‚Äì a concentration camp for political prisoners since 1947.See the Introduction, in: Bo Yang, Poems of A Period, transl. by Stephen L. Smith and Robert Reynolds. Hong Kong (Joint Publishing Co.) 1986. While dissidents were still silenced by severe repression, making it impossible to speak of a softening of the regime's policies, foreign economic historians point out, however, that a 'liberalization' occurred in the economic sphere. One of its consequence was a considerable worsening of the material situation of rural producers, largely due to the decline of the rice price in the late '60s and the '70s. Liberalization in the economic sphere also brought no freedom for workers to strike or organize. Trade unions and strikes remained banned under martial law until 1987. If the regime itself was not becoming more liberal, politically, and the life of peasants and generally the common people in the rural districts turned from bad too worse while folks in the working class quarters of the large cities suffered from low wages, abysmal pollution, and poor housing conditions, then at least many young middle-class people could escape the repressive situation in Taiwan by studying abroad. Many came back as liberals. It took two liberal composers trained as ethno-musicologists in the West, Shih Wei-liang (Shi WeiliangÂè≤ÊÉü‰∫Æ) and Hs√º Tsang-houei (Xu Changhui Ë®±Â∏∏ÊÉ†), to 'discover' Chen Da in 1967. Liu Ching-chih notes that Hs√º Tsang-Houei (a composer and professor who became very involved in folk music research as an ethnomusicologist) had pursued advanced studies in West Germany in the 1960s.See: Liu Ching-chih, A Critical History of New Music in China. Hong Kong (Chinese University of Hong Kong) 2010, p.616. ‚Äì . Having returned to Taiwan in 1965, he \\"set up the Chinese Youth Music Library\\" in 1966 and started to \\"collect national music.\\"See: Liu Ching-chih, ibidem, p.562. Shih Wei-liang was also a \\"composer, musicologist and professor.\\"See: Liu Ching-chih, ibidem, p.553; see, more generally, pp.551ff. (passim). Thus, the year 1967 became a turning point in Chen Da's life as a folk artist even though he hardly realized this at the time. Chen Da was actually discovered by chance during field work undertaken by Shih and Hs√º in South Taiwan. Presenting the more general context that led to Chen Da's discovery, Liu Ching-chih writes that \\"(i)n 1976, Shih and Hsu Tsang-houei [had] founded the Research Center for Chinese Ethnomusicology, and started a tide of enthusiasm for the collection of folk songs. They systematically collected more than 3,000 songs from the plains and mountains of Taiwan, the largest-scale collection campaign ever carried out in the island. However, lack of funding meant that the work continued for only two years.\\"Liu Ching-chih, ibidem, p. 562. The two researchers patterned their field trip according to the paradigm established by the folk music researchers John and Alan Lomax in the 1930s. They had a good sense of quality. When they encountered Chen Da in Hengchun, they were immediately impressed by his style of singing, the tonality, the authenticity of his ballads. At the time, Chen Da \\"was already old and half blind, but still able to improvise long ballads telling stories and teaching morals. His simple and straightforward voice and lyrics (we)re deeply moving...\\"Wang Ying- fen, ibidem, p.239. Chen Da was valued highly as a musician, both due to the emotional expressivity of his singing style, and the honesty his audience as well as most music scholars discovered in his delivery. As Liu Ching-chih writes, \\"the important question is whether or not a work of music expresses the true thoughts and emotions of the composer\\" respectively the creative ballad singer, \\"or, to put it another way,\\" whether or not he \\"has made full use of his capacity for musical expression (technique) and moral strength (honesty).\\" Referring to socially and politically committed music, Liu added, \\"There are some good examples from the Anti-Japanese War\\" that showed how such music need not necessarily become cheap and superficial music, thus mere propaganda.Liu Ching-chih, ibidem, p.616.  A folk music craze on Campus leads to Chen Da's first record  The advent of the Campus Folk Song Movement (xiaoyuan minge yundong Ê†°ÂúíÊ∞ëÊ≠åÈÅãÂãï) in Taiwan ‚Äì that was inspired by the American folk music revival ‚Äì improved the perception and degree of appreciation of folk music in the early 1970s. The folk music revival in the U.S. had peaked in the second half of the 1960s. Partly due to the presence of American GIs, transferred to Taiwan ‚Äì from the Vietnam battleground ‚Äì for R&R; (rest and recreation), songs by Bob Dylan and others, but also U.S. rock music arrived in Taiwan and were heard not only in U.S. clubs but also in Taiwanese avant-garde venues like the Scarecrow Coffee House and the Columbia Restaurant (both in Taipei) during the early 1970s. Commercial labels, radio and television slowly took note, as a small educated public discovered its taste for folk songs ‚Äì especially American and British folk singers like Bob Dylan, Joan Baez or Judy Collins. Later, as the Campus Folk Song Movement gathered speed, it also led to the emergence of socially and politically committed new Taiwanese respectively Chinese folk music in Taiwan. It thereby created a receptive cultural environment (at least on campus) that made possible the discovery of Chen Da not only by musicologists but by campus youths. The presence of an urban audience that cared for foreign folk music encouraged Prof. Shih (Âè≤ÊÉü‰∫Æ) and Hsu (Ë®±Â∏∏ÊÉ†) to contact a record company, on behalf of Chen Da, although without his knowledge. In 1971, they were able to invite the old folk singer to Taipei. The music critic Yatin Lin later on commented that \\"Shih Wei-liang (Âè≤ÊÉü‰∫Æ) and Hsu Chang-hui (Ë®±Â∏∏ÊÉ†) ... brought him to the capital city of Taipei to record albums to preserve this 'dying' singing style.\\"Yatin Lin, \\"Choreographing a flexible Taiwan: Cloud Gate Dance Theatre and Taiwan's Changing Identity\\", in: Alexandra Carter and Janet O'Shea (eds), The Routledge Dance Studies Reader. Abington ( Routledge) 2nd ed. 2010; pp. 256. - ). In 1971, one album featuring Chen Da was recorded. It was entitled \\"A Folk Musician: Chen Da and his Ballads.\\"In literature about Chen Da, this is also quoted as \\"Folk musician - Chen Ta and his songs.\\" The song from this album that became most widely known is the long ballad Sixiang qi (Thoughts Arising).The title of this ballad has also been translated as \\"To recall.\\" One source refers to it as \\"Reminiscing,\\" a folk song by Chen Da from deep southern Taiwan...\\" As Shen Shiao-Ying noted, \\"the song 'Ssu Hsiang Ch'i' (Sixiang qi)\\" is \\"an old Taiwan ballad made popular by Chen Ta (Chen Da).\\"Shen Shiao-Ying, \\"Obtuse Music and the Nebulous Male: The Haunting Presence of Taiwan in Hong Kong Films of the 1990s\\", in: Laikwan Pang and Day Wong (eds.), Masculinities And Hong Kong Cinema. Hong Kong (Hong Kong Univ. Press) 2005, pp. 120-121. - . Shen Shiao-Ying adds that the ballad is heard at the beginning and in the final sequence of a popular Chinese film entitled Farewell China (1990). According to the music director of the film, Mr. Shen Sheng-te, \\"the song expressed an all-encompassing Chineseness.\\"Shen Shiao- Ying, ibidem, p.121. In Shen Shiao-Ying's opinion, it also \\"expresses lament toward the tragic state of Chinese people who have left their homeland.\\"Shen Shiao-Ying, ibidem, p.121f. ‚Äì It is well-known that many Chinese left their homeland, some fleeing poverty, some due to the prolonged civil war. Taiwan was not the only destination. The interpretation offered by Shen Shiao-Ying reflects the sadness expressed by the ballad and by Chen Da's particular rendition. Shen Sheng-te's reading of the ballad accentuates Chen Da's attachment to the Chinese motherland and his longing for reunification. The latter sentiment was later on also expressed by another ballad Chen Da sung that remembered, in an allusive way, the massacres in the wake of February 28, 1947. Sadness has been a recurrent characteristic of Chen Da's songs, but so has been their penchant to \\"remember.\\"Regarding the sadness of most ballads sung by Chen Da, see: P. Lin (ÊûóÁèÄÂß¨ Lin Poji), \\"Nian gechang qu jie youmen‚Äîtan Taiwan fulao geyao de changfa Âî∏Ê≠åÂî±Êõ≤Ëß£ÊÜÇÊÇ∂‚ÄîË´áÂè∞ÁÅ£Á¶è‰Ω¨Ê≠åË¨†ÁöÑÂî±Ê≥ï (Reading the singing style of songs and interpreting sadness / On the rendition of Taiwanese Fulao Songs), ibidem. ‚Äì Lin Poji sees Taiwan's folk songs generally tainted by sadness.  Chen Da's \\"encounter\\" with a regime \\"interested\\" in him  The media and certain scholars have claimed that the early 1970s brought a certain relaxation of the repressive policies that the K.M.T. continued to enact until the lifting of martin law in 1987. In 1972, Chiang Ching-kuo (Ëî£Á∂ìÂúã), the eldest son of Chiang Kai-shek, became prime minister in Taiwan. Perhaps Chiang Ching- kuo (who had a noteworthy record already, as head of the secret police) read the signs of the time when he began, as prime minister, to make modest overtures directed at those citizens who had been discriminated and intimidated in the past. Political parties that could function as opposition parties remained forbidden and trade unions remained outlawed. But now soap operas using the Taiwanese dialect (spoken by the vast majority of the islanders) appeared on television. In September 1973, in the context of a policy that aimed to coopt native Taiwanese citizens, a group of about one hundred senior citizens from South Taiwan were invited by a Christian Welfare Association close to the KMT to take part in a bus tour to Taipei. The folk singer Chen Da was among those selected for the tour, perhaps in view of the fact that he was by now moderately well known in Northern Taiwan. The members of the group were guests of a so-called welcome party organized by the mayor of Taipei that was also attended by a high-ranking aide of Premier Chiang Ching-kuo for P.R. reasons. Subsequently, the KMT-controlled press reported that Chen Da \\"praised and thanked the government\\" and that he was \\"profoundly impressed\\" by Premier Chiang, cherishing the photo of the premier that he had received and keeping it as a precious memory. Under the existing conditions, Chen Da had hardly any choice but to show himself \\"impressed.\\"N.N., \\"Kuangye de beige ‚îÄ‚îÄChen Da /Êõ†ÈáéÁöÑÊÇ≤Ê≠å‚îÄ‚îÄÈô≥ÈÅî (Chen Da - The Wilderness Elegy) ‚Äì Biography of Chen Da. Ibidem. Chen Da's real position towards the KMT became apparent when Premier Chiang came to Hengchun later on, in the context of one of his public relation tours. The premier sought to see the folk singer, apparently hoping to win sympathies among native speakers of Taiwanese. Chen Da avoided him, however, by hiding somewhere. Later on, he claimed diplomatically that he was 'sad' that he had missed the chance to meet Chiang Ching-kuo. The follow-up to this reveals a lot about both the regime and the singer. Feeling (or fearing) negative consequences, Chen attempted subsequently to see the premier in Taipei. As he approached the presidential palace and tried to enter, he was arrested by the military police, described as 'deluded' and locked away for a brief period in a psychiatric hospital. \\"In the hospital, he fiddled with his old yueqin\\" and began to sing ‚Äì while improvising the lyrics, as he would usually do: \\"(...) '... how can my destiny be so sad, subject to such treatment...! I am no psychopath.'(...)\\" For those who reported these words, they were merely proof of delusion or the approaching dementia of an old and ill-educated man. For others, they document the way his creativity as a singer-songwriter worked. He would seize the moment, and was always inspired by what moved him, emotionally and intellectually.  The folk singer Chen Da ‚Äì a symbolic figure since 1976 or 1977  Wind of Spring or A period of so-called liberalization in Taiwan = On April 5, 1975, the ailing dictator Chiang Kai-shek (Ëî£‰ªãÁü≥) died at the age of 87. It became easier for persons with a regional Taiwanese rather than mainland Chinese background to pursue careers within the K.M.T. government. For some, the cooptation policy seemed to work. KMT membership increased. On the other side of the political spectrum, dissidents became more daring. Xiangtu wenxue literature ÈÑâÂúüÊñáÂ≠∏ (referred to by many scholars abroad as Taiwan Nativist Literature) began to flower. It was sharply attacked by most scholars and journalists close to the KMT from the beginning. The reason was that like the works of writers connected with the May Fourth Movement, it was considered as subversive. The books of May Fourth authors like Zhang Ailing (Eileen ChangÂºµÊÑõÁé≤), Qian Zhongshu(Èå¢ÈçæÊõ∏), Xiao Hong(Ëï≠Á¥Ö), Lao She (ËÄÅËàç), Cao Yu (ÊõπÁ¶∫), Mao Dun (ËåÖÁõæ) and especially, Lu Xun (È≠ØËøÖ) were banned in Taiwan throughout the martial law period. During the 1970s, it was mentioned on campus that books by these authors were available only to loyal professors at Chengchi (Political) University in Mucha (Muzha) for research purposes. The books were kept in a \\"poison cabinet\\" reserved for \\"dangerous literature\\" to which only \\"dependable\\" persons with a proven academic interest had access. But otherwise, it was forbidden to possess such books. They could not be published and should not be read by average citizens in Taiwan.Unnoticed by censors, students who were not allowed to read these works could find translations in English language anthologies, for instance on the bookshelves of the Tamkang university library. = The Coca Cola Incident: Li Shuangze and the emergence of the \\"Sing your own songs movement\\" = The mid-1970s were also a period when the Campus Folk Song Movement (xiaoyuan minge yundong Ê†°ÂúíÊ∞ëÊ≠åÈÅãÂãï) gathered speed. From its start, singer- songwriters like Hu Defu (ËÉ°Âæ∑Â§´), \\"Yang Xian, Li Shuangze, Wu Chuchu and Yang Zujun\\" were involved in this movement.Liu Ching-chih, ibidem, p.550. Hu Defu and Li Shuangze (ÊùéÈõôÊæ§) had both been singing American folk songs at the Scarecrow, opposite Taida, in the early 1970s. They met at this place and became friends. By the mid- and late 1970s, the Campus Folk Song movement became commercially successful, though only as segment of the market controlled by the local \\"music industry.\\" A typical Campus Folk Song or School campus song (Chinese) in Taiwan was partly akin to American folk rock, partly more soft and sentimental. Campus Folk singer/songwriters would stick exclusively to Lyrics in English, at least in the early years. Then, something remarkable happened. During a folk concert that took place on the Tamkang campus in 1976, the folk singer, writer and painter Li Shuangze (ÊùéÈõôÊæ§) challenged the exclusive focus on U.S. folk music. It was a political and cultural scandal that became known in the furious KMT-controlled press as the \\"Tamkang Incident\\" or \\"Coca-Cola incident.\\" Li Shuangze, who was \\"a charismatic and heroic singer\\" and a Tangwai movement (dangwai Èª®Â§ñ) \\"activist,\\" reached many university students. In the exuberant words of a young music critic writing in the Tamkang Times, he \\"shook the youth of his generation\\" out of their political passivity and cultural submission to Americanized tastes in music. He did so \\"by ... smashing a Coca-Cola bottle on the stage,\\" shouting, Why don't you sing your own songs? Sing your own songs! before he started to sing during \\"a Tamkang Western Music Concert in 1976\\" ‚Äì in Chinese! Obviously, he had been \\"taunting the audience(...)\\" because up to this point they had kept \\"favoring western songs.\\"All quotes referring here to Li Shuangze are from Hu Ying-hsueh. See: Ying-hsueh HU, \\"Musical Feast at the 'Zoo',\\" in: Tamkang Times, No.598. March 1, 2005 (printed version, published by Tamkang University; also online: . It was the start of the Sing Your Own Songs Movement. Opposing the westernized Campus Folk Song Movement, \\"Li Shuangze, Wu Chuchu and Yang Zujun... launched campaigns for 'modern Chinese folk songs,' (or) 'new folk songs' (xin minge)\\" and sought for roots in Taiwan's socio-cultural reality, including its folk culture. Like Li Shuangze, the singer Yang Zujun (Ê•äÁ•ñÁè∫) worked closely together with Liang Jingfeng (Liang Ching-feng Ê¢ÅÊôØÂ≥∞) who wrote the lyrics of several songs, among them the lyrics of Meilidao (Formosa), sung by Li Shuangze. The song Meilidao later became the anthem of the Tangwai movement and provided the name for an important opposition journal, Meilidao or Formosa Magazine.The magazine played an important role in organizing opposition to KMT rule and it became famous abroad because of the Kaohsiung Incident that led to widespread arrests and the closing of this magazine in December 1978. The new folk songs that were written can be considered for the most part as protest songs. \\"The songs were composed through fusing instrumental and melodic elements from American folk rock, along with the expression and themes from Chinese folk music, both of which were familiar to the youth of the time. Songs from the genre are characterize as having a forward-looking, optimistic, simple, and youthfully naive feel (...)\\"Chris Roughan, in his article on \\"Campus Folk Movement\\", published online in: http://chrisroughan.webs.com/taiwancampusfolk.htm. Roughan supplies this version of the origine of the Let's Sing Our Songs movement: \\"'Where are our own songs?' Li Shuangze asked the audience in a 1976 Western music concert at Tamkang University. 'On my journeys to the Philippines, Taiwan, the US and Spain, I found that youngsters around the world drink Coca-Cola and sing English songs. But where are our own songs?' This incident was later recorded as the Tamkang Event. / Li's call to \\"sing our own songs\\" awakened his generation. The ripple effect came in a series of reports published in the Tamkang school magazine which stimulated a vibrant climate for song writing and gradually resulted in the campus folk song movement. Exchanges between students from different schools also helped to expand the scale of the movement.\\" http://chrisroughan.webs.com/taiwancampusfolk.htm In its opposition to Westernization (xihua Ë•øÂåñ), the \\"New Folk Song\\" (xin minge Êñ∞Ê∞ëÊ≠å) movement or Sing your own songs movement [that is to say, the Sing your Chinese ‚Äì i.e. Mandarin and/or Taiwanese and/or Hakka ‚Äì protest songs movement] was allied with the authors and readers of Taiwan Nativist Literature movement: with xiangtu literature. It also tended toward the Democracy (= Dangwai Èª®Â§ñ ) Movement that challenged the KMT regime and its conservative backers abroad. But above all, the singer-songwriters and lyricists of this movement discovered Chen Da and soon got in touch with him. It is well known that the 'folk craze' in the U.S. had not been unconnected with the civil rights movement and, somewhat later, anti-war sentiment and even active opposition to the war in Vietnam. In a similar vein, the new interest that developed since 1976 in new Taiwan protest songs ('xin minge Êñ∞Ê∞ëÊ≠å) and, likewise, in traditional Taiwanese folk music, was re-enforced by the two parallel and simultaneous phenomena just mentioned: nativist (that is to say, socially critical, realist) literature (‰π°ÂúüÊñáÂ≠¶ xiangtu wenxue) and the new Tangwai movement (subsequently referred to as dangwai (Èª®Â§ñ) or pro-democracy movement). Now, Chen Da became a point of reference, and soon a symbolic figure. The affinity of 'nativist literature' and Chen Da's folk songs was recognized by the xiangtu novelist and Dangwai activist Wang Tuoh (Wang Tuo ÁéãÊãì) in 1977. In his collection of essays entitled Alley Drums, Wang Tuo deals with nativist literature and its definition. He reflects on the reasons why it became a target and object of controversial debate in the media. He also deals with the allegation (voiced in the KTM-controlled media at the time) that it was subversive. He focuses on the history of Chinese literature in Taiwan since the end of the civil war in 1949. And he deals with the folk music of Chen Da as well as the paintings of Hong Tong ‚Äì folk paintings that are akin in essence to the nativist literature.See: T. Wang (Wang Tuo ÁéãÊãì ), Jie xiang gu sheng Ë°óÂ∑∑ÈºìËÅ≤ (Alley Drums). Taipei (Yuan hang chuban she ÈÅ†Ë°åÂá∫ÁâàÁ§æ )1977. Despite the fact that Chen Da had been able to record his first album in 1971, he had to wait five more years, till 1976, before Prof. Shih Weiliang (Âè≤ÊÉü‰∫Æ) and Prof. Hsu (Ë®±Â∏∏ÊÉ†) were finally able to obtain a chance for him to sing on TV. In that same year, Shih (Âè≤ÊÉü‰∫Æ) and Hsu (Ë®±Â∏∏ÊÉ†) also made Chen Da's participation in a folk concert possible. And they saw to it that he could make some money by singing in a Taipei restaurant, in all likelihood the Scarecrow restaurant. The reaction in the press was surprisingly positive. The desolation expressed by his ballad was noted, the poetry of his lyrics was praised, the accompaniment on his yueqin admired. What the press did not say when Chen Da was praised, was that there was a reason why his ballads were sad. They were sad because Taiwan's history and the experience of the common people was sad. The regime required that the fine advance made under its leadership should be extolled. The desolation expressed by Chen Da's songs was the same desolation, however, that was also expressed by the socially critical novels and short stories of Wang Tuoh (Wang Tuo ÁéãÊãì;, b. 1944), Chen Ying-chen (Chen Yin-zhen Èô≥Êò†Áúü, b. 1937), Yang Ch‚Äôing-ch‚Äôu (Yang Qingchu Ê•äÊ∏ÖÁüó;, b.1940), Wu Cho-liu (Wu Zhuoliu Âê≥ÊøÅÊµÅ (1900‚Äì1976)), or even Hwang Chun-ming (Huang Chunming ÈªÉÊò•Êòé), and by the poems of Bo Yang (ÊüèÊ•ä;). Three years later, in late 1979, Wang Tuoh and Yang Ching-chu would be arrested and sentenced to long prison terms for their political commitment to the democracy movement, like many other Dangwai activists. Sad ballads reflected not only the situation of Chen Da but generally of the common people in Taiwan. Also in 1976, \\"Prof. Shih Weiliang (Âè≤ÊÉü‰∫Æ), who was already sick in bed with lung cancer, was worried about the plight of Chen Da, and contacted the Harvard Business Foundation for Education and Culture in June in order to discuss the possibility of producing an album of this folk musician in the U.S.; the proceeds of the record should then go to Chen Da.\\" When Shih Wei-liang (Âè≤ÊÉü‰∫Æ) died in early 1977, Chen Da sang his famous ballad \\"Sixiang qi\\" during the memorial union in Taipei. In early 1977, people who wanted to help Chen Da and who knew that he had a hard time trying to earn a living, helped him to get an offer to perform in Taipei. Thus, Chen Da performed (again?) at the \\"Scarecrow restaurant\\" in Taipei in January, and once more in April, 1977. He was now already past 70. = Li Shuangze and others invite Chen Da to sing on campus in Tamsui = In March, 1977 when Chen Da was back in Hengchun, he sent a letter to Professor Hsu (Ë®±Â∏∏ÊÉ†) saying that his life was very difficult. It had remained so despite a few public performances in North Taiwan and despite the recognition accorded to him by ethno-musicologists like Hsu and by young urban lovers of folk music. As a consequence, a letter, written by Prof. E. Lin (Êûó‰∫åÊïôÊéà ), appeared in the \\"United Daily News\\" that appealed to the public to face the plight of folk artists.See: United Daily News, March 24, 1977. Then, on March 31, 1977, Chen Da participated in the \\"Night of Chinese folk songs\\" (Zhongguo minsu geyao zhi ye / ‰∏≠ÂúãÊ∞ë‰øóÊ≠åË¨†‰πãÂ§ú) that took place at Tamkang University. It was the first time Chen Da performed in front of a mass audience. The event had been organized by pro-democracy (dangwai Èª®Â§ñ ) activists. The choice of Tamkang was hardly accidental. The campus in Tamsui was perhaps less efficiently controlled due to the fact that Tamkang was a private institution.Tamkang was owned by the majority owner(s) of Evergreen Lines, capitalist(s) with native Taiwanese roots. Among those very active in organizing this event, Li Shuangze (ÊùéÈõôÊæ§) as well as three of his friends, the lecturers Liang Jingfeng (Liang Ching-feng Ê¢ÅÊôØÂ≥∞ ), Lee Yuan-chen (Li Yuanzhen ÊùéÂÖÉË≤û, a feminist activist) and Wang Ching- ping (Wang Jinping ÁéãÊ¥•Âπ≥) must be mentioned. They all played a role in the 'Tangwai movement. Before and after the concert, proscribed music cassettes with Taiwanese folk songs had been distributed on campus. As Nimrod Baranovich later noted, \\"[t]he simple technology and low cost in cassette recording made the production and dissemination of alternative, unofficial culture easier than ever before.\\"Nimrod Baranovitch, China's New Voices, Berkeley (University of California) 2003, p.13. ‚Äì . Of all the songs the crowd heard in that night, a song by Chen Da is well remembered that referred allusively to the \\"February 28 Incident\\" (er'erba shijian ‰∫å‰∫åÂÖ´‰∫ã‰ª∂ : the massacres on 2/28/1947 by the KMT army and police). It was a love song, ostentatively of the sort sung by fisherfolk, and the singer had managed to artfully weave two, two and eight into the text: obviously a strong accusation of the KMT dictatorship which had outlawed and would punish any talk about the events of February 1947. The longing that the fisher and his distant beloved felt for each other was immediately understood as a poetic expression of the deep longing for reunification with the motherland. Several years later this longing waned in many dangwai activists. Some, like the writer Wang Tuoh, became disillusioned with the 'motherland' after visiting the PR China. Democracy mattered as much as social justice, after all. But this was after the lifting of martial law in Taiwan. By that time, Chen Da and the night of Chinese (rather than Taiwanese) folk song in Tamkang was a memory already. = Chen Da's second album and his collaboration with Lin Hwai-min = On February 10, 1978, Prof. Hsu (Ë®±Â∏∏ÊÉ†) was in charge of the first recording session done for a collection of albums by various Chinese folk musicians that he was putting together as \\"editor-in- chief.\\" The first album was to feature Chen Da's rendition of Hengchun folk ballads. In November 1978, the writer, choreographer and dancer Lin Hwai-min, founder and 'director' of the internationally acclaimed Cloud Gate Dance Theater, invited Chen Da to record a ballad that was then integrated into a dance performance entitled \\"Legacy.\\" Professor Yan L√ºfen (È°èÁ∂†Ëä¨) recalls the recording session and a bit of conversation between Lin and Chen Da: \\"In 1978, Lin Huai-min decided to create (sc. the dance theater performance) Legacy. He went to the recording room (sc.with Chen Da). The old man put down the yueqin (i.e. his moon guitar) and asked what he should sing today. Lin said, Sing \\"Tangshan guo Taiwan de gushi\\" (ÂîêÂ±±ÈÅéÂè∞ÁÅ£ÁöÑÊïÖ‰∫ã). Chen Da, with his desolate hoarse voice, improvised the song \\"Sixiang qi zuxian xian xinguo Taiwan\\" (ÊÄùÊÉ≥Ëµ∑Á•ñÂÖàÈππÂøÉÈÅéÂè∞ÁÅ£)...\\" \\"1978Âπ¥ÔºåÊûóÊá∑Ê∞ëÁÇ∫‰∫ÜÂâµ‰Ωú„ÄäËñ™ÂÇ≥„Äã„ÄÇÂà∞‰∫ÜÈåÑÈü≥ÂÆ§ÔºåËÄÅÂÖàÁîüÊîæ‰∏ãÊúàÁê¥ÔºåÂïè‰ªäÂ§©Ë¶ÅÂî±‰ªÄÈ∫º„ÄÇ ÊûóË™™ÔºåÂî±„ÄàÂîêÂ±±ÈÅéÂè∞ÁÅ£„ÄâÁöÑÊïÖ‰∫ã„ÄÇÈô≥ÈÅîÁî®‰ªñËíºÊ∂ºÊ≤ôÂïûÁöÑÂóìÈü≥ÔºåÂç≥ËààÁöÑÂî±Âá∫ÈÄôÈ¶ñ„ÄäÊÄùÊÉ≥Ëµ∑Á•ñÂÖàÈππÂøÉÈÅéÂè∞ÁÅ£„Äã...\\" ( Transl.:) \\"In 1978, Lin Huai-min decided to create (sc. the dance theater performance) Legacy.

Chen Da, with his desolate hoarse voice, improvised the song \\"Sixiang qi zuxian xian xinguo Taiwan\\"„ÄäÊÄùÊÉ≥Ëµ∑Á•ñÂÖàÈππÂøÉÈÅéÂè∞ÁÅ£„Äã...\\" ‚Äì Quoted in: Chengguo zhanshi ÊàêÊûúÂ±ïÁ§∫ , Chen Da's reaction to Lin's suggestion says a lot about the old man. Incidentally, Prof. Yan was not the only one who noted the beauty of Chen Da's \\"hoarse voice,\\" a quality he had in common with Bob Dylan (for instance). On Dec.16, \\"Legacy\\" had its premiere in Chiayi, Central Taiwan. \\"Legacy\\" was performed both in Taiwan and Japan. As Yatin Lin noted, \\"Chen Da's epic songs about Taiwanese immigrants laid the blueprint for Lin's Legacy, with Chen's hoarse voice inserted as interludes between dance sections [of Lin Hwai-min's Cloud Gate Dance Theater]. Through such narrative and musical associations, the transition from identifying with an 'imaginary' home in mainland China [...] to a new 'home' [...] was being proposed\\" by the choreographer, in the opinion of Yatin Lin.Yatin Lin, \\"Choreographing a flexible Taiwan: Cloud Gate Dance Theatre and Taiwan's Changing Identity\\", in: Alexandra Carter and Janet O'Shea (eds), The Routledge Dance Studies Reader. Abington (Routledge) 2nd ed. 2010; p. 256. - . In other words, Yatin Lin interprets Legacy and Chen Da's delivery of Sixiang qi as an endorsement of a Taiwan identity that includes the latest wave of immigrants from the mainland. This is an interpretation, however, that is influenced by the direction in which the thought of many Dangwai activists developed in the 1980s and 1990s. Thanks to Professor Hsu (Ë®±Â∏∏ÊÉ†), who acted as producer/editor, Chen Da recorded a second album in 1979. The album, entitled Chen Da, Hengchun ballads (\\"Chen Da yu Hengchun diao shuochang\\" „ÄäÈô≥ÈÅîËàáÊÅÜÊò•Ë™øË™™Âî±„Äã), was released in August 1979. According to a critic, the album included a noteworthy \\"piece of Hengchun social realism,\\" a ballad entitled \\"The Gangkou Incident / Ah Yuan and Ah Fa ‚ÄìTragic story of a father and a son.\\" „ÄäÊ∏ØÂè£‰∫ã‰ª∂‚îÄÈòøÈÅ†ËàáÈòøÁôºÁà∂Â≠êÁöÑÊÇ≤ÊÖòÊïÖ‰∫ã„Äã(Gangkou shijian / A Yuan yu A Fa fuzi de beican gushi\\"). This ballad was just another proof of Chen Da's commitment to social justice. In the words of the critic, who noted \\"\\"Chen Da's verdant and luxuriant singing,\\" the ballad opened \\"another 'page' in a history of blood and tears (...)\\" of the island. It is not for nothing; however, that this critic describes the style of singing as 'verdant,' that is to say, fresh and characterized by surprising improvisation (very much like Taiwan's 'green' vegetation) as well as 'luxuriant' ‚Äì thus 'rich' and characterized by surprising musical inventiveness. It goes to show that \\"social realism\\" need not be drab.The quote is from the article \\"Gannian Xu Changhui hengchun minyao jixing ÊÑüÂøµË®±Â∏∏ÊÉ†ÊÅÜÊò•Ê∞ëË¨†Á¥ÄË°å Appreciating Prof.Hsu's Travel Notes on Hengchun Folk Music,\\" more specifically the paragraph titled \\"Ban sui zhuo luoshan fengchuan lai \\"sixiang qi\\" gesheng / ‰º¥Èö®ËëóËêΩÂ±±È¢® ÂÇ≥‰æÜ„ÄäÊÄùÊÉ≥Ëµ∑„ÄãÊ≠åËÅ≤\\" (mainly about the ballad \\"Sixiang qi ÊÄùÊÉ≥Ëµ∑ .\\" The article appeared initially in the official magazine published by the National Taiwan Symphony Orchestra for public relations purposes; it was also published online on the website of the National Taiwan Symphony Orchestra / Guoli Taiwan jiaoxiang yuetuan ÂúãÁ´ãÂè∞ÁÅ£‰∫§ÈüøÊ®ÇÂúò.. - Listed in the \\"External links\\" section as additional information. More recordings appeared posthumously, notably Songs of A Mountain Town (Â±±ÂüéÂ∞èÂî± Shancheng xiao chang), published in 2000 by Wind Records in Taipei Âè∞Âåó. Chen Da's occasional performances in Taipei restaurants (and his appearance on television) had not lifted him above the position of a representative of a music genre that lacked the prestige of classical music. Folk music was a minor art, in the eyes of the cultural bureaucracy and of many members of the upper class and the middle class.It must also be added that his performances in these small venues did not generate enough revenue to really improve his life. Performing in these small Taipei venues had been a step on the way to being better known in Northern Taiwan, however. It had targeted a small public that had a specific kind of music (including blues, foreign and Chinese folk music) at heart. Quite a few were artists, writers, in short, intellectuals who saw Chen Da as one of their own, as a \\"Nativist\\" ‚Äì somebody rooted in the native culture of the common people, just like the realist literature that focused on Taiwan and its social problems. All of this let him pose no hazard to the regime, from the point of view of the bureaucracy, as long as there had been no mass audience. The concert of March 1977, in Tamkang, had been a different matter: Here, Chen Da had been playing in front of a crowd. The event showed that he could move people. It turned him, more than ever, into the symbolic figure that Wang Tuoh saw in him. He was a man who sang in Taiwanese. He was a man who had sung a ballad that was banned when the censors began to understand the allusive way in which the massacres that started on February 28, 1947 were remembered. = Chen Da's Performances on Campus in the wake of the December 1979 crack-down = That Chen Da could move and inspire people, became especially significant in 1980, a year that was to usher in a period of enormous tension. In that year, not without reason, he was again invited to perform in front of a crowd at the Tamkang Ê∑°Ê±ü campus. When he came, the performance had an implicit symbolic significance: that of resistance. It was a resistance that was necessitated by the crackdown that began with the Kaohsiung Incident in December 1979. In late 1979 and early 1980, more than one hundred Dangwai leaders and many ordinary Dangwai activists had been arrested in the wake of their participation in the banned International Human Rights Day demonstration in the South Taiwanese port city of Kaohsiung (the so-called Kaohsiung Incident). The leading dissidents had received long prison sentences. Among them were the novelists Chen Yinzheng and Wang Tuoh, and women's rights activist Annette Lu. The political climate would remain tense throughout the first half of the 1980s while the sentiment of resistance was increasing in the population. The regime reacted in its own way. In 1983, for instance, Lu Hsiu-yi (Áõß‰øÆ‰∏Ä) ‚Äì a teacher at the Chinese Cultural College who had studied in France ‚Äì was arrested and sentenced to prison for \\"presumption of rebellion.\\" Presumption of rebellion was indeed a weird charge, a bit like suspicion of being a subversive ‚Äì a typical charge between 1947 and 1970. Lu Hsiu-yi was only released in 1986 when the regime, under internal pressure in the streets, was finally beginning to release political prisoners.This softening of the formerly harshly repressive course was also seen as necessary by important foreign friends of the regime who pushed key KMT leaders in this direction. The regime was now determined to achieve an understanding with 'moderates' in the Tangwai movement, in order to engineer a controlled 'transition' to limited democracy, while splitting the opposition. Film censorship continued to be in effect, after the lifting of martial law, and other vestiges of the former undemocratic regime remained in force, as well, when an agreement was reached with Dangwai representatives. The democracy movement had to accept the KMT condition that the old constitution would remain in force. This clause has weakened the chance of the anti-KMT forces to be represented in parliament in accordance with their true popular support. Like others, Chen Da braved the climate of the crack-down in 1980. He would not only sing in Tamkang ‚Äì the campus where he had first performed in front of democracy movement supporters and activists, three years ago. Now, he was also invited to a number of other universities. Again, he performed in front of enthusiastic crowds. It is likely that they were lovers of the native folk music heritage. But, for the most part, they were Tangwai movement supporters and dangwai sympathizers who saw the concerts as an act of defiance. In the course of 1980, Chen Da performed at the Chinese Cultural College (WenhuaÊñáÂåñ, today known as Chinese Culture University), at National Chengchi University in Mucha (a Taipei suburb), and then at the Kaohsiung Junior College as well as the Pingtung College of Agriculture, both in South Taiwan. There were also other tertiary institutions that made Chen Da's participation in folk concerts possible in 1980. None of these concerts amounted to a distraction from issues that moved people at the time. They constituted no innocent entertainment; they were acts of cultural resistance organized by students and academics. Those who participated, singers, audience and organizers of the event, were aware of it. The army officers stationed on campus were aware of it. They had always watched what students were doing and they had received daily reports about 'suspicious' words spoken by teachers in the context of their courses and lectures. All of them knew that the events reflected widespread popular resentment of the crack-down in the wake of the so-called Kaohsiung incident (also known as the Meilidao incident). If the dangwai leaders were jailed, at least the normal people could demonstrate obvious dissent, in the face of a government bent on silencing dissent.  The Final Year  Chen Da is known to have derived a sense of satisfaction from singing and playing the yueqin (or moon guitar) in front of other people. He knew that he had something to say and wanted to say it. But he also would play his instrument and sing all by himself. Even though he was an old man ‚Äì an illiterate person from a poor peasant family in the South Taiwanese countryside, and yet a poet, as several scholars have emphasized ‚Äì, he must have understood the situation that Taiwan faced when a policy that had brought limited though reluctant \\"tolerance\\" of opposition was reversed in Dec. 1979. In 1980, Chen Da had traveled a lot and taken part in quite a few campus-based folk concerts. There had been an echo. But the performances had also produced a lot of stress and fatigue. Returning to Hengchun from these tours, he seems to have felt at a loss what to do. A biographer speculates that perhaps his energy was waning in his last few months. Some observers have suggested a certain aimlessness. They claim that, in the last year of his life, he was often seen wandering in the streets.The explanations discussed are manifold: Was this due to the memory of how he had been singing and playing the yueqin in the streets of the Hengchun region for so many decades? Did he engage now in an aimless search for an audience in Hengchun, haunted as he was by this memory and driven by a waning desire to play because performing seemed the most obvious thing he should do? Or was he more determined and capable than many think he was, and actually continued to performe in the streets, almost up to his last minute? It is unclear whether he had ceased to perform in the final days of his life. Some journalists close to KMT-newspapers have even claimed after his death that he was increasingly deluded in the last few years of his life. This is unlikely, in view of his many important concerts in 1980. If it is not a purposeful denunciation, perhaps they misread symptoms of loneliness and fatigue. On April 11, 1981, carrying his yueqin' with him as usual, Chen Da was trying to cross a road in his hometown, Hengchun. All of a sudden, progress ‚Äì or should one say, modernization? ‚Äì hit him, in the form of a speeding tourist bus. The old folk singer died on the way to the hospital, at age 76.\\"Chen Da\\" (biographical data), in: Musicians of Taiwan, (published by NCFTA), ibidem.

In 1995, Entwistle put together a backing band with producer Steve Luongo that he christened as simply 'The John Entwistle Band'. The outfit also featured guitarist Godfrey Townsend and keyboardist Gordon Cotten with harmony vocals performed by all the members. The group documented their 1998 tour, during which they performed a mix of new, solo and classic songs from The Who. The song \\"Under a Raging Moon\\" is written by John Parr (from St Elmo's Fire fame) and Julia Downes and is included on Roger Daltrey's 1985 solo album of the same name, the track is a tribute to The Who's drummer Keith Moon who died in 1978. It was said that Entwistle wanted to play this song instead of Won't Get Fooled Again at Live Aid with The Who but Pete Townshend disagreed so Entwistle wanted to record his own version instead as a tribute to Moon. When Allmusic rated the album they said, \\"John Entwistle may be the most esteemed bass guitarist in rock & roll ‚Äì and he's a proven songwriter, too.

Cambridge University Press, Cambridge, 1950, pp.286-7, appendix 1 but as was remarked upon by Woodger, her suggestion that Sir Richard Arches (died 1417) was the son of Ralph Arches, son of John Arches (d. circa 1405) of East Hendred was clearly physically impossible. Career Between 1394 and 1395 he took part in the first military expedition to Ireland of King Richard II and was knighted soon afterwards. He was elected MP for Buckinghamshire in 1402. He was appointed a Commissioner of Array for Buckinghamshire in 1403 and served as a Justice of the Peace for Oxfordshire from 1410 to 1412. In July 1417 he embarked in King Henry V's army for the conquest of Normandy, serving in the retinue of Thomas Montagu, 4th Earl of Salisbury (1388‚Äì1428). He died in Normandy on 5 September 1417, presumably killed in action. Marriages and children He married twice: *Firstly, before 1410, to Joan Ardern (born circa 1375), granddaughter and co-heiress of Sir Giles Ardern (died 1376) of Drayton, Oxfordshire, Oxfordshire, from whom she inherited the Oxfordshire manors of Horley, Ilbury and Wykeham. These thus became possessions of Sir Richard Arches, who moved his residence to Oxfordshire. She was the widow of William Greville of Horley, Oxfordshire, younger son of the great Gloucestershire wool-merchant William Greville (died 1401), of Chipping Campden, another of whose sons was the husband of Joan's sister Margaret Ardern. By Joan Ardern Richard Arches had the following two children: **John Arches (born 1410), aged 7 at his father's death,Cokayne, Complete Peerage, new edition, Vol IV, p.377 (Baron Dinham), note h, quoting Sir Richard's Inquisition post mortem who died as a child shortly after his father, without issue, leaving his sister Joan his sole heiresses. **Joan Arches (1410‚Äì1497), who became a substantial heiress. She was a minor aged 7 at her father's death and in 1420 disposal of her marriage was granted to Thomas Chaucer, (died 1434), son and heir of the poet Geoffrey Chaucer and 14 times MP for Oxfordshire. Chaucer had acquired in 1415 most of the lands of Sir Richard Arches' uncle Sir Richard II Adderbury (died 1416), twice MP for Oxfordshire, which included Donnington Castle and manor, Berkshire. In 1421 at the age of 11 she also became heir to the lands of her half-brother Richard Greville (died 1421), of Ilbury in Deddington, Oxfordshire, MP for Oxfordshire in 1420, her mother's son from her first marriage. Joan was married to Sir John Dinham (1406‚Äì1458) of Nutwell, Devon. Their son and heir was John Dinham, 1st Baron Dinham (1433‚Äì1501), KG; they also had at least five daughters.Cokayne, Complete Peerage, new edition, Vol IV, p.377 *Secondly before May 1417, during the last year of his life, Arches married Joan Frome (c. 1386 ‚Äì 1434), daughter and co-heiress of John Frome (died 1404) of Buckingham, Buckinghamshire and Woodlands (in Horton), Dorset, councillor to King Henry IV and 6 times MP for Dorset and once for Buckinghamshire. She was the widow of William Filliol (c. 1380 ‚Äì 1416), MP and after Arches' death she remarried before March 1420 (as his 2nd wife) Sir William Cheyne (died 1442), Chief Justice of the King's Bench. Joan died 1 July 1434. She left a will dated 31 March 1420. Lands held In Buckinghamshire:\\"Eythorpe\\", Cranwell & Little Kimble, per Cokayne, Complete Peerage, new edition, Vol IV, p.377 (Baron Dinham) *OvingHoP biog *Little Kimble, held from the honour of Wallingford.Victoria County History, Buckinghamshire, Vol.2, 1908, Parishes: Little Kimble *Eythrope, in the parish of Waddesdon,Modern spelling, formerly Eythorpe, Ethorp (Lysons, Magna Britannia, 1806, re: Waddesdon) etc. held from the honour of Wallingford.

Arches also inherited, or possibly purchased at reduced cost, five Oxfordshire manors from his childless uncle Sir Richard II Adderbury (died 1416), of Donnington Castle, Berkshire, twice MP for Oxfordshire. These manors were Souldern, Steeple Aston, Sibford, Ludwell, and Glympton. In addition he acquired, via his first wife's inheritance, possession of the Oxfordshire manors of Horley, Ilbury and Wykeham. Succession His son and heir John Arches (born 1410) died as a child soon after his father's death, and thus his heir became his daughter Joan Arches, later the wife of Sir John Dinham (1406‚Äì1458) of Nutwell, Devon. Their son and heir was John Dynham, 1st Baron Dynham (1433‚Äì1501), KG.Cokayne, Complete Peerage, new edition, Vol IV, p.377 (Baron Dinham) The arms of Arches were later quartered by Lord Dinham and later by his heirs the Bourchier family, Earls of Bath.http://www.middlesex- heraldry.org.uk re:monument of Lady Frances Bourchier (died 1612) in the Earl of Bedford's chapel at Chenies, Bucks ReferencesSources *Woodger, L.S., biography of Sir Richard Arches, published in The History of Parliament: House of Commons 1386-1421, ed.

The mall is in the Summit-University neighborhood just across from the Frogtown neighborhood. The Rondo Community Outreach Library is west across Dale Street. The Dale Street station on the Green Line is also at the intersection. The idea for the mall was first started in 1971 as part of the Model Cities Program. The project's ideal result was to create a suburban shopping mall in the heart of the city. The project was pushed by neighborhood activists on city planners. Construction of the mall was completed in 1978 with the mall losing money from 1979 to 1989. In 1987 there were plans to move a nightclub and restaurant to the mall. The mall was owned and operated by Kraus-Anderson in 1988. The anchor of the store in 1989 was the Disabled American Veterans Thrift Store. Plans were brought up in 1989 to do a $6.3 million renovation so the mall could host \\"United Noodles Oriental Food Inc., a drug store, a food court, and several specialty shops.\\" A 1989 report on the surrounding neighborhood described the mall has a failure and noted the mall's perennial problem of finding suitable tenants. The tenants that did exist, such as a welfare office, were not were not of the type that was originally intended. The mall was described as nearly empty 1992 article detailing the problems the surrounding community faced. The mall appeared to be faring better in 2000 when the vice-president of Kraus-Anderson described the mall as fully leased. The mall has hosted a farmers' market on weekends in the parking lot since 1998. The Saint Paul Public Schools district had plans to purchase the property to host adult literacy education and multicultural programs. The Saint Paul Area Learning Center moved to Unidale Mall on February 1, 1991. Those programs eventually moved out of the mall and became Gordon Parks High School.

He briefly considers the Army's infantry division and the Navy before deciding to join the Air Corps; when the recruiter asks Porky for his name, he responds, \\"Porky Cornelius Washington Otis Lincoln Abner Aloysius Casper Jefferson Philbert Horatius Narcissus Pig,\\" a full name unused before or since. He applied to one of the jobs. The sergeant (similar to MGM's Spike) sends Porky through a series of tests, which he fails disastrously. When the other soldiers are being issued rifles, Porky is issued a feather duster and ordered to clean a voice-activated robot plane. Meanwhile, Little Kitty is playing with a puppy, and the plane's control unit picks up her voice. The plane takes Porky on an incredibly wild ride. It destroys a military balloon (the crew parachute to safety). It levels a building except for the clock tower. It crashes through a circus tent, causing trapeze performers to do tricks on his plane. It goes through the ocean, chasing a fish and getting chased in turn by a whale. It even crashes into a wagon load of hay, turning the cargo into straw hats. It nearly destroys several other planes, but they nimbly escape. Finally, a number of other children show up and shout constant commands at the puppy, causing the plane to go totally berserk. Finally, the exhausted puppy's owner tells him to come home, and the plane does so, crashing into the hangar. Porky goes racing from the building and dashes into the office of the infantry division, proclaiming that he wants to \\"l-l-learn to m-m-march\\".

Citadel Square Baptist Church was the fourth Baptist church built in Charleston, South Carolina. The church began as an outgrowth of the First Baptist Church when, in 1854, a dozen members sought permission to establish a new church for the upper peninsula. The new church was to have been known as the Fourth Baptist Church but, when an existing Baptist church closed, leaving only three Baptist churches, the name was changed to Citadel Square Baptist Church. The name refers to the church's location on upper Meeting St., immediately across from Marion Square, which at the time was the location of the Citadel. The Charleston architectural firm Jones & Lee designed the building and construction of the church at 328 Meeting St. began in June 1855. The new building was opened on November 23, 1856. A hurricane in 1885 blew over the original steeple and a year later, the 1886 Charleston earthquake damaged the tower. The tower was repaired and a steeple designed by the Boston, Massachusetts architect Edward Silloway was installed. Following Hurricane Hugo, which blew the steeple off of the church, it was rebuilt at 210 feet, shorter than the steeple of St. Matthew's across Marion Square; the choice was to avoid a race for the tallest steeple. A Sunday school building added in 1891 was replaced in 1921. In April 1951, an educational building was added to the campus. The church was the first in Charleston to televise its services, doing so for more than 40 years until ending the practice in 1998.

It lies at the western end of the South Downs, immediately to the north of the Hampshire Basin and south-east of Salisbury Plain. Structure The M3 motorway cutting through the southern limb of the anticline. The fold is around long, running from north of Michelmersh near the River Test to East Meon in the valley of the River Meon. In the Winchester area the core of the anticline has been eroded to expose the older Cenomanian Zig Zag Chalk formation in Chilcomb and Bar End (the 'Lower chalk'). This is surrounded by progressively younger rings of the Turonian Holywell Nodular Chalk and New Pit Chalk Formation (the 'Middle chalk') and the Coniacian Lewes Nodular Chalk and Santonian Seaford Chalk Formation ('Upper chalk'). This results in a near-complete ring of inward- facing chalk scarp slopes including Magdalen (Morn) Hill to the north, Chilcomb Down, Cheesefoot Head and Telegraph Hill to the east, Deacon Hill, Twyford Down and St. Catherine's Hill to the south. To the west, cut off by the valley of the Itchen are Compton Down and Oliver's Battery. The core of the anticline is crossed by the M3 motorway, completed in the 1990s. In order to avoid the Itchen Valley close to Winchester this cuts deeply through the younger beds to the north and south. Here the structure has dips of around 10¬∞ on the northern side and around 2¬∞ to the south. To the east of Winchester the fold swings southwards towards East Meon as the Winchester-Meon Pericline. This has a slightly westward plunge, reflecting the axis of the Wealden Anticline. To the west of the Meon is Beacon Hill. Towards the eastern end near Warnford the West Melbury Marly Chalk member is exposed in the Meon Valley and at East Meon; this represents the bottom of the chalk. Between these outcrops lie Old Winchester Hill and Henwood Down. To the west of Winchester the fold runs on slightly southwards through Farley Mount. To the south-west across the Test is a similar fold, the Dean Hill Anticline. Parallel folds to the north include the Winchester-King's Somborne Syncline, the Stockbridge Anticline and the Micheldever Syncline. As with other nearby folds, the structure is controlled by movement of fault blocks within the Jurassic strata below. The anticline has been explored for hydrocarbons, especially around Cheesefoot Head. Seismic surveys show faulting at depth in the Jurassic, but this tends to be represented in the Cretaceous at the surface by fold axes.
