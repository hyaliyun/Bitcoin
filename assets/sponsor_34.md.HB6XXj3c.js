It also is an important historic landmark and a well-known meeting point, with many coffee shops and restaurants. The cornerstone was laid on 29 August 1864, and it was constructed over an earlier and smaller market. Frederico Heydtmann designed the building, but his plan was substantially altered and enlarged. The inauguration took place on 3 October 1869. In 1886, 24 small shops were installed in the inner yard. In 1912, while undergoing renovation, a fire destroyed all the stalls in the inner area. A second floor was added by 1913. The market suffered from a major flood in 1941, and from additional fires in 1976, 1979 and 2013. In the administration of Telmo Thompson Flores, it ran the risk of being demolished, but the outcry led to the reconsideration of the decision. In 1990 the City administration organized a multidisciplinary team to develop a Restoration Project, which focused on the following goals: *Rescue of the aesthetic quality of the building; *Optimizing supply potentials; *Creation of spaces of sociability. The works included a modern structure of steel and glass to cover the large area of the inner yard, regained the visual perception of the inner arcades, renewed the internal circulations, created new living spaces, and deployed network infrastructure needed to handle the daily activities of a large and busy market. The new cover allowed the integration between the ground floor and second floor. The second floor, where there were offices and public offices before, now has several popular establishments such as restaurants, snack bars, and coffee shops. With the works, the market also expanded its number of shops. The inauguration took place on 19 March 1997. The Public Market is part of the traditions of the city, mainly for its \\"Banca 40\\" (an ice cream parlor), its centenary restaurant Gambrinus and one of the most traditional bars in town, the 101 years old Bar Naval (Navy Bar). There are about 109 shops, selling fresh produce and baked goods, locally raised meats and dairy products, and various other food items and also handcrafted goods. There are over 100,000 items for sale. On 6 July 2013, the Public Market caught fire again. The fire is believed to have started at 20h30 on the upper floor at the corner of Avenida Borges de Medeiros and J√∫lio de Castilhos. Recent reports say that no people were injured, but 30% of the structure appeared to have burned down. The inner yard after restoration Notes References *Franco, S√©rgio da Costa.

Description and history The Peter Jeppesen House at 4107 North Albina Avenue in Portland, Oregon is a one and one-half story, symmetrical, hip-roofed bungalow with dormers. Its distinctions are its general European character and solid double-walled brick construction. Designed by a noteworthy Danish-born Portland architect, the bungalow is faintly reminiscent of the avant-garde work of Adolph Loos and Austrian proponents of the Arts and Crafts movement. It meets National Register Criterion C as a well-documented example of a collaboration between architect and builder; a house produced by a craftsman in his own medium for his own use. Peter Jeppesen (1861-1956), brick mason, and Emil Schacht, architect, were Danish emigres. Jeppesen was the contractor not only for numerous buildings but for a number of sidewalk construction projects around the city which can be identified today by his imprimature. Schacht (1854-1926) is noted in Oregon architectural history as the designer of the Oriental Building for the Lewis and Clark Centennial exposition of 1905. He also designed the 1912 unit of the Police Block on Oak Street in Portland which has been entered into the National Register, the Lenox Hotel and the building occupied by the Povey Brothers' well-known art glass manufactory. Jeppesen acquired the nominated property in payment for construction work elsewhere in North Portland. He acquired the adjoining lot at the same time and developed there an income-producing, four-unit apartment building, for which plans were provided once again by his fellow countryman. The house may be seen as a tangible reminder that Albina was a settlement area for Scandinavian immigrants in the years surrounding the turn of the century. Jeppesen was active through his long and productive career in Portland in the Danish Aid Society and the Danish Brotherhood. Like other newly arrived immigrants, Peter Jeppesen was attracted to Albina, a once-separate settlement ultimately annexed to Portland, for its large concentration of Scandinavians. Albina was important as an industrial area of Portland in the boom years following the Lewis and Clark Exposition of 1905. Before its annexation by Portland in 1891, the area known as Albina was one of many small river towns along the Willamette, such as St. John's and Linnton.https://npgallery.nps.gov/NRHP/GetAsset/NRHP/87001535_text File:House Soon After Construction Facing Northwest 1910.fw.png4107 N Albina Soon After Construction Facing Northwest 1910 File:House Soon After Construction Facing West.fw.pngHouse Soon After Construction E.

He notably toured with Cora Brown-Potter in the 1880s and 1890s, and was cast as the leading man in many stage productions alongside her. He was also a signwriter, gold prospector and rancher mainly in Australia. Bellew family history and early life Bellew was born in Prescot, Lancashire, the son of Rev. John Chippendall Montesquieu Bellew. He was the second son and third-born of the four Bellew children. He had an older brother, Evelyn Montesquieu Gambier (born 25 October 1847) and an older sister, Eva Sibyl Bellew (born October 1848 in Worcester). His younger sister, Ida Percy Clare, was born 17 June 1852 in Calcutta, India. Evelyn Bellew emigrated to the United States in the late 1860s, married Anita Killen and died childless on 1 December 1900. Sibyl Bellew married civil engineer John Hooper Wait in March 1873 and lived in Bhownuggur, India until her husband's suicide on 27 June 1876. At the time of the 1891 Census, she was living as a nun in the Poor Clares convent on Cornwall Street, Kensington; she died childless in 1927. Clare Bellew married Joseph Boulderson, of the 68th Regiment, in 1874 and had two children, Ida Sybil Mary and Shadwell Joseph Boulderson, before dying at age 49 in the first quarter of 1902. His mother, Eva Maria Money (born 12 June 1824) was the youngest daughter of Vice-Admiral Rowland Money, C.B., R.N., and Mary Ann Tombs. She married her first husband Henry Edmund Michell Palmer, a soldier in the Indian Army, on 8 February 1843. However, Palmer died of \\"hill fever\\" in Madras, India on 9 November 1846. The young widow then married John Chippendale Montesquieu Bellew on 27 March 1847. John Bellew was born John Chippendall Higgin in Lancashire on 3 August 1823 to Robert and Anne Maria (n√©e Bellew) Higgin. Bellew was an acquaintance of Eva's brother-in-law, the Reverend Samuel Gambier, who believed him to be a natural-son of his friend and actor, William Macready, whom Bellew did resemble and correspond with regularly until 1850. Bellew changed his name to his mother's maiden name in 1844 while still a student at St Mary Hall, and he was ordained an Anglican priest in 1848. Bellew was first appointed curate of St Andrew's in Worcester in 1848, and was transferred to Prescot, Lancashire, in 1850, where Kyrle Bellew was born. Young portrait of Bellew by Ernest Ferdinand Ritz, before 1890 In late 1851, the Reverend Mr Bellew was appointed as an assistant chaplain to St John's Cathedral in Calcutta, India. The Bellews arrived in India on 17 November 1851 aboard the passenger ship HotspurStaff. \\"Passengers arrived.\\" Allen's Indian Mail, 3 January 1851: 10(188); pg. 10 and moved into a large house on Harrington Street in Calcutta. However the Bellews did not have a happy marital life in India, the two separating in November 1853 after John Bellew discovered licentious correspondence between Eva and 23-year-old Ashley Eden, a civil servant with the East India Company. John Bellew sued for divorce from Eva on 6 March 1855 on grounds of adultery. Eva counter-sued, claiming ill-treatment. John Bellew named Eden as his wife's lover and was granted a divorce on unequivocal grounds. Ashley Eden married Eva Bellew on 13 August 1861, and she lived in India until her death on 10 January 1877. John Bellew received custody of the children and left India in 1855. Kyrle Bellew described this tumultuous time in his life in his posthumous work Short Stories. While erroneously stating that the Bellew family left India during the 1857 Indian Mutiny, he relates that the return voyage to England solidified what would become a lifelong love of the sea for Bellew.Bellew. (1912) Short Stories. pg. 11 On their return to England, the family first settled in St Johns Wood where the Rev. Mr Bellew was assistant priest at St Philip's on Regent St. The family moved to Hamilton Terrace, Marylebone in 1857 after John Bellew was placed in charge of St Mark's. John Bellew married Emily Louisa Wilkinson (n√©e East) in Dublin, Ireland on 23 September 1861 and the Bellews resided at Bedford Chapel in Bloomsbury from 1862 to 1868. Kyrle Bellew was educated at the Lancaster Royal Grammar School and received lessons from private tutors, notably learning Latin along with Leslie Ward. However his home life was not happy because Kyrle Bellew did not get along with his new stepmother or stepsister, Maud Wilkinson. In the early 1860s he attempted to run away from home to the East India docks to start a life at sea, but he was ultimately returned home to his worried father. While John Bellew thought he should enter the ministry, the elder Bellew agreed to allow Kyrle Bellew to have a naval career. In 1866, Bellew was sent to train on , a famous training ship. Conway was one of four training ships moored on the Mersey River that taught young boys how to be adept sailors, and it was specifically catered to developing officers for the Merchant Marines. Bellew spent two years on board the ship. Career Bellew, circa 1894 With romantic profile and blond looks, Bellew was well suited for romances and melodramatic adventure stories of the day. In the 1880s and 90s he toured the world with a famous leading lady Mrs. Brown-Potter who was also known as Cora Brown Potter. They took Shakespearean and other classic plays from the United States to Australia. In Australia Bellew prior to being an actor was a reader, goldminer, and apparently bought a large amount of property.Bellew. (1912) Short Stories pg. 5 In 1888 Bellew began giving acting lessons to Mrs. Leslie Carter, a married socialite. In 1889, Bellew was named as a co-respondent in the highly publicised divorce case of Mrs. Leslie Carter. By the mid-1880s he was an actor of note and was considered a proper tutor for Caroline Dudley, Mrs. Carter's birth name. His preparing of Dudley for the stage required ample amounts of time with her and away from her husband. Eventually Mr. Carter became jealous and suspicious of the attention his wife was receiving, leading him to name Bellew and other men as his wife's lovers. In the last decade of his life, Bellew tended to his mining property in Australia, requiring making the long journeys back and forth to the United States. Finally at the turn of the century and in the US for good, he continued his popularity on Broadway premiering such plays as Raffles the Amateur Cracksman to US audiences. He found time to venture into primitive motion pictures, which at the time were considered well beneath an actor of his stature; in 1905 he featured in Adventures of Sherlock Holmes; or, Held for Ransom. He died of pneumonia on 2 November 1911, in Salt Lake City, Utah, where he had been appearing in a play called The Mollusc. Personal life Le Grande in the 1880s Eug√©nie Marie Seraphi√© Le GrandeHer last name has also been spelled Legrand and Le Grand. was a French stage actress who was born and educated in Paris. She first appeared in the French vaudeville productions, Les Faux Bonshommes and Un Menage en Ville, and then moved on to Shakespearean theatre at Sadler's Wells Theatre in London before relocating to Australia. Le Grande travelled to Melbourne via the passenger ship Lincolnshire from London on 4 December 1872 in the company of noted tragic actor Boothroyd Fairclough. She gave birth during the voyage on 15 January 1873 and arrived in Hobson's Bay on 20 February with an infant. Bellew married Le Grande on 27 October 1873 at St Patrick's Cathedral under the name Harold Dominick Bellew. Bellew and Le Grande separated within a few weeks of marriage and did not live together again. One account of the brief marriage holds that Le Grande was previously the mistress of Boothroyd Fairclough. She secretly wed Bellew but returned to Fairclough when he discovered them on their honeymoon. In Bellew's posthumous book, Short Stories, he relates a tale, attributed to a friend named Jack, that details the specifics of a sham marriage to a French actress. Several of the details in the story parallel known facts about Bellew and Le Grande, such as their marriage dateBellew (1912) Short Stories pg. 30 and the presence of an illegitimate child. Bellew formally divorced Le Grande on 16 May 1888. Le Grande reportedly bore Bellew a son, Cosmo Kyrle Bellew, whose birth date is often cited as 1885. However, Cosmo Bellew's World War I draft registration card lists a birth date of 23 November 1874, with his nearest relative listed as Marjorie Bellew. There is no mention of a son in any of Kyrle Bellew's obituaries, Bellew was estranged from Le Grande following their wedding and the fate of Le Grande's previous child remains unknown. After divorcing Bellew, Le Grande married Hector Alexander Wilson and continued to tour with acting companies in the United States, Britain and Canada. Hector Wilson died in January 1893 and left an estate in Australia valued at ¬£ 27,000 to Eug√©nie.

The earthquake was centred northwest of the city of Pichilemu. The earthquake was caused by increased regional stress arising from an earthquake on 27 February, centered offshore Maule Region, which was felt throughout central Chile. The 11 March earthquake was at first thought to be an aftershock from the 27 February event, but University of Chile seismologist Jaime Campos identified it as an independent earthquake. The Hawaii-based Pacific Tsunami Warning Center pointed out the possibility of local tsunamis within of the epicentre, although small, but violent waves were seen in the Pichilemu and Bucalemu area. One person was reported dead. At least eleven aftershocks immediately followed, causing panic throughout coastal towns between the Coquimbo and Los Lagos regions. The earthquake was especially destructive in the epicentre town, Pichilemu, capital of Cardenal Caro Province. The city hosts five National Monuments of Chile, of which two, the Agust√≠n Ross Park and the Agust√≠n Ross Cultural Centre, were seriously damaged by the earthquake. It also damaged the villages of La Aguada and Cardonal de Panilonco. Rancagua, the capital of O'Higgins Region, was also damaged, leading President Sebasti√°n Pi√±era to declare a catastrophe state in O'Higgins Region. Background The city of Pichilemu suffered major damage in the 27 February 2010 earthquake and tsunami. Nearly all of the territory of Chile is subject to earthquakes, arising from strains in the subducting Nazca and South American Plates or shallow strike-slip faults. The subduction zone along the Chilean coast produced the most powerful earthquake ever recorded, the 1960 Valdivia earthquake. Some earthquakes which occurred near the epicentre of the 11 March 2010 event are the 1985 Algarrobo and Rapel Lake earthquakes. On 27 February 2010, a strong earthquake, which reached a magnitude of 8.8 on the moment magnitude scale, hit central Chile. The earthquake occurred in the region of the plate boundary between the Nazca and South American plates, offshore Maule Region. The earthquake produced a tsunami which caused great damage in cities and towns along the Chilean coast; Pichilemu was badly damaged after the earthquake and tsunami struck. The 6.9 earthquake of 11 March 2010 occurred two weeks after the 27 February event. Chilean seismologists, including Sergio Barrientos from the University of Chile Seismological Service, had suggested that the absence of an aftershock greater than magnitude 6 following the February 27 quake indicated that there remained energy with the potential to be released. Two foreshocks of the 11 March event occurred on 5 March: one reached magnitude 5.7, and the other magnitude 5.2; both were felt between the Valpara√≠so and Maule regions. Geology The Pichilemu earthquake was caused by the change in regional stress from the 27 February earthquake. Preliminary analyses by the United States Geological Survey (USGS) of the 11 March earthquake locations and seismic-wave radiation patterns suggested that the event resulted from normal faulting within the subducting Nazca plate or the overriding South America plate, unlike the 27 February earthquake, which occurred as thrust faulting on the interface between the two plates. Later in 2010, University of Chile Seismologist Sergio Barrientos stated that the earthquake was produced inside the South American plate. While news media reported the earthquake as an aftershock of the February earthquake in Chile, a preliminary geological summary issued by the USGS considered it to be an independent earthquake, a conclusion which seismologist Jaime Campos of the University of Chile also reached. Seismic hazard near the epicentre of the earthquake. The earthquake's depth was estimate as by the University of Chile Seismological Service (Servicio Sismol√≥gico de la Universidad de Chile), and by the United States Geological Service. On 15 March 2010, seismologist Mario Pardo from the University of Chile Seismological Service ruled out that Pichilemu was experiencing a seismic swarm, after public concerns about the continued aftershocks in the area; as of that date, more than 50 aftershocks had occurred in the area, the strongest of them measuring 6.7 in the moment magnitude scale, minutes after the initial quake. From the pattern of aftershocks, it has been suggested that this earthquake originated from rupture along a previously unknown geological fault, the Pichilemu Fault, between Pichilemu and the commune of Vichuqu√©n in Maule Region, at 15 km depth, 40 km in length and 20 km wide. At first it was not known whether this fault was formed during the earthquake or if it was just reactivated, however geologist Jos√© Cembrano from the University of Chile affirmed that \\"[the fault] corresponds to a long life fault, in a million years time, whose activity had not been detected before.\\" In a 2012 publication titled Aftershock Seismicity of the 27 February 2010 Mw 8.8 Maule Earthquake Rupture Zone, it was stated that, in total, 10,000 aftershocks were located in the Pichilemu area for the first six months after the mainshock; this pronounced crustal aftershock activity with mainly normal faulting mechanisms found in approximately a wide region, with sharp inclined borders and oriented oblique to the trench. Reaction President Sebasti√°n Pi√±era was sworn in at the National Congress of Chile. The earthquake took place minutes before the new President of Chile, Sebasti√°n Pi√±era, was sworn in, at about , at the Chilean congress in Valpara√≠so, where the shaking was clearly felt. Pi√±era was at the Palace of Cerro Castillo at the time of the earthquake, and as he left the place, he was seen \\"looking worried\\"; Michelle Bachelet, the outgoing president, was also seen \\"worried\\" by the earthquake as she entered the Congress. La Naci√≥n newspaper reported some journalists attempted to flee the Congress building. According to Spanish newspaper El Mundo, there was \\"nervousness\\" at the ceremony, and the ceremony narrator called for calm, adding that the Congress building could even stand stronger earthquakes. President Pi√±era's visit to Rancagua on the earthquake day Presidents N√©stor Kirchner of Argentina, Evo Morales of Bolivia, √Ålvaro Uribe of Colombia, Rafael Correa of Ecuador, and Fernando Lugo of Paraguay were present at the ceremony, but television footage showed that the inauguration was not interrupted, even though there was a tsunami warning in place; however, it was reported the ceremony was concluded more quickly than planned. President Pi√±era cancelled the ceremonial lunch with his visitors and traveled to Rancagua, one of the cities most affected by the earthquake; Pi√±era subsequently declared a catastrophe state in O'Higgins Region as a result of the earthquake, and appointed Army General Antonio Yackcich as Area Commander in Chief (Jefe de Plaza) for the region, while he was visiting Rancagua that day. The declaration meant that \\"the military would occupy the area to keep order and prevent the kind of looting that occurred in Concepci√≥n during the first two to three days after last month's quake\\", according to The New York Times. Tsunami Travel time map of the tsunami triggered by the 11 March 2010 Pichilemu earthquake. Army personnel at La Cruz Hill, Pichilemu, shortly after the earthquake occurred. A Pacific-wide tsunami warning was not issued by the Pacific Tsunami Warning Center, although the organization pointed out the possibility of local tsunamis within of the epicentre, roughly the area between La Serena and Concepci√≥n. Half an hour after the earthquake, the Hydrographic and Oceanographic Service of the Chilean Navy (Servicio Hidrogr√°fico y Oceanogr√°fico de la Armada, SHOA) issued a tsunami warning for the area between Coquimbo and Los Lagos regions, as a way of \\"keeping people protected\\" against the possible occurrence of new tsunamis. President Pi√±era urged coastal residents to move to higher ground in case of a tsunami. Following the tsunami alert, thousands of residents of central Pichilemu fled to La Cruz Hill, with some of them staying there for several days, and received advice from members of the Army. People from the village of C√°huil stayed at Cord√≥n. The tsunami warning emitted by SHOA was lifted that same day at around . According to a preliminary report by the National Office of Emergency of the Interior Ministry (Oficina Nacional de Emergencias del Ministerio del Interior, ONEMI) on 11 March 2010, only 'small waves, without any [special] kind of characteristics' were seen in the area surrounding Pichilemu, while the USGS reported a small tsunami, with sea wave heights of 16 centimetres (0.525 ft) at Valpara√≠so, and 29 centimetres (0.951 ft) at San Antonio. Interior Minister Rodrigo Hinzpeter reported violent waves in Pichilemu and Bucalemu. Damage and casualties Locals set an improvised camp at the La Cruz Hill in Pichilemu, shortly after the tsunami warning was decreed The Pichilemu post-office building was severely damaged by the February and March earthquakes. At Pichilemu, the epicentre town, the earthquake destroyed the balustres surrounding Agust√≠n Ross Park, damaged severely the recently re-inaugurated Agust√≠n Ross Cultural Centre, and the Espinillo, and Rodeillo villages. The earthquake was accompanied by \\"great noise\\", according to witnesses from the Pichilemu villages of Cardonal de Panilonco and La Aguada; most of the already damaged buildings in La Aguada fell down, including the local church. The road to Cardonal de Panilonco was damaged, and many houses built with adobe did not resist the shaking. Outside Pichilemu, in Rancagua, local mayor Eduardo Soto reported severe damage to homes in the town. The Santa Julia highway overpass located between Rancagua and Graneros collapsed, and part of the Pan-American highway was damaged. A power outage affected Pichilemu for two days, beginning right after the earthquake struck, and there were partial power outages in Mostazal, San Fernando and Peumo. In Santiago, \\"windows rattled, buildings trembled and cellphone service failed\\", according to a The New York Times article. The old Bas√≠lica del Salvador in Santiago, which was damaged during the 1985 Algarrobo earthquake and was never repaired, suffered additional damage. In Nilahue Barahona, a village near the town of Pumanque, electric cables fell to the ground during the earthquake, causing a fire that burned of a pine, eucalyptus and grassland forest. The earthquake was also reported to have been felt in Mendoza, Bariloche, C√≥rdoba, San Rafael, Buenos Aires, Montevideo, and Asunci√≥n. One person died of a heart attack during the earthquake in Talca, Maule Region. A United States Geological Survey summary of the earthquake reported damage at Rancagua, 177 kilometers northeast of Pichilemu. Relief efforts for the 27 February earthquake stalled for about six hours because of the constant aftershocks. According to the U.S. National Oceanic and Atmospheric Administration's National Geophysical Data Center, the damage provoked by the earthquake and its accompanying small tsunami was \\"limited\\", adding that \\"a rough estimate of the dollar amount of damage\\" was \\"roughly corresponding to less than one million\\". Aftershocks Several buildings in Pichilemu were damaged after the earthquake and its aftershocks. Following the main shock, there were two aftershocks of magnitude 6 or greater. The first of them occurred at , fifteen minutes after the initial quake, and was centered in the commune of La Estrella, Cardenal Caro Province, at a depth of , reaching a magnitude of 6.7; another aftershock, of magnitude 6.0, took place eleven minutes later, at , this time centered in Pichilemu, at a depth of . In total, there were ten aftershocks within the six hours after the 6.9 magnitude earthquake, two of magnitude 6 or greater, and seven between 5 and 6. Almost two months later, on 2 May 2010, an aftershock of magnitude 5.8 MW struck the Chilean O'Higgins Region, at . The aftershock was centered southwest of Navidad, and occurred at a depth of , according to the University of Chile Seismological Service. The National Emergencies Office (ONEMI) reported that the aftershock was felt most strongly in Talca, south of Santiago, and that there were no casualties, only some telephone lines had collapsed. Six other aftershocks subsequently hit the Pichilemu area that day. The United States Geological Survey measured the aftershock with a magnitude of 5.9. A further aftershock of the Pichilemu earthquake occurred on 29 September 2010 at . It reached magnitude 5.6, and its epicentre was centered southwest of Lolol, southwest of Santa Cruz, at a depth of . Telephone lines collapsed in O'Higgins Region. No infrastructural damage or casualties was reported. The aftershock was felt between the Valpara√≠so and Maule regions. The event reached Mercalli V intensity in Rancagua, Navidad, Talca, Curic√≥, amid other cities and towns. As of February 2013, there have been about 8,500 aftershocks of the Chilean February and March 2010 earthquakes according to the University of Chile Seismological Service, with most taking place in the proximities of Pichilemu. Seismologist Sergio Ruiz said that \\"a significant number of aftershocks\\" will take place at least until 2015. Media coverage One of the headlines of nationally distributed newspaper El Mercurio of 12 March 2010 was about the Pichilemu earthquake, along with the oath ceremony of President Pi√±era on the day before. The earthquake was reported by local, national and international news media. Locally, online newspaper Pichilemu News published an article named \\"First signs of change?: Shaken handover ceremony in Chile because of new earthquake aftershocks\\" (\\"¬øLos primeros signos del cambio?: Movido cambio de mando se vivi√≥ en el pa√≠s ante nuevas r√©plicas del terremoto\\") on 11 March; five days later, local newspaper El Expreso de la Costa published an interview with Mario Pardo, seismologist in charge of the geophysics department of the University of Chile, who recommended people of Pichilemu to \\"try to remain calm, the worst already happened\\". The only local radio that continued broadcasting through the day of the earthquake was Radio Entre Olas, directed by Jorge Nasser Guerra, who along with two other radio workers, reportedly were the only not to be evacuated after the earthquake in Pichilemu. Because the earthquake provoked a power outage, the radio worked with \\"emergency equipment\\". Previously, after the 27 February earthquake, Entre Olas did not stop broadcasting either, despite there was a power outage that lasted for several days. Nationally distributed newspaper El Mercurio published on its 12 March 2010 main page the headline \\"6.9 [magnitude] aftershock marks the most seismic day after the earthquake\\" (\\"R√©plica de 6,9¬∞ marca el d√≠a m√°s s√≠smico post terremoto\\"), adding that \\"[s]eventeen of the twenty seisms that occurred yesterday [11 March] in central-southern Chile had their epicentre in Pichilemu, Region of O'Higgins, which was declared in Disaster State yesterday.\\" On that same day, Santiago-based newspaper La Tercera published on their headline: \\"Pi√±era faces first crisis as he takes office as new President\\" (\\"Pi√±era enfrenta primera crisis al asumir como nuevo Presidente\\"); La Tercera elaborated: \\"The 6.9 Richter magnitude earthquake, which occurred minutes before the power handover took place, added an additional quota of drama to the oath of Sebasti√°n Pi√±era, whose agenda was already modified by the 27 February disaster.\\" Other newspapers of national distribution where the earthquake was reported on its main page included Las √öltimas Noticias (which featured a photograph of President Pi√±era aboarding a helicopter in military dress), Publimetro, and La Naci√≥n, whose main headline said \\"Emergency measures marked start of Pi√±era['s presidency]\\" (\\"Medidas de emergencia marcan partida de Pi√±era\\"). The New York Times included a headline on their 12 March 2010 main page titled \\"For Chile, More Aftershocks and An Inauguration\\", featuring a photograph of presidents Lugo and Correa during the earthquake. Throughout Chile, regional newspapers also reported the earthquake and tsunami warning on their edition of 12 March 2010. Among these are La Estrella de Arica (Arica), La Estrella de Iquique (Iquique), El Mercurio de Antofagasta, La Estrella del Norte (both from Antofagasta), El Mercurio de Calama, La Estrella del Loa (both from Calama), El Diario de Atacama, Diario Cha√±arcillo (both from Copiap√≥), El D√≠a (La Serena), El Mercurio de Valpara√≠so, La Estrella de Valpara√≠so (both from Valpara√≠so), El L√≠der (San Antonio), El Tip√≥grafo (Rancagua), La Prensa (Curic√≥), El Sur (Concepci√≥n), El Austral de Temuco (Temuco), El Diario Austral de Los R√≠os (Valdivia), El Austral de Osorno (Osorno), El Llanquihue (Puerto Montt), and La Prensa Austral (Punta Arenas). Among the international media who reported on the quake were the BBC, CNN, CBS News, The Huffington Post, and news agencies Al Jazeera, Reuters, and Associated Press. The New York Times included on their 12 March 2010 main page a photograph of Presidents Fernando Lugo of Paraguay and Rafael Correa of Ecuador \\"re-acting to an aftershock felt Thursday [11 March] in Valpara√≠so, Chile, the strongest since the devastating Feb. 27 earthquake\\"; the photograph was followed by the headline \\"For Chile, More Aftershocks, and an Inauguration\\". The newspaper published an extensive article titled \\"Aftershocks Jolt Chile as New President Is Sworn In\\", which stated that the earthquake \\"almost overshadowed the inauguration of Chile‚Äôs first right-wing leader in 20 years [Pi√±era].\\" Other newspapers who included headlines on the earthquake on their 12 March 2010 main pages include El Mundo, El Pa√≠s, ABC (the three from Madrid, Spain), Clar√≠n (Buenos Aires, Argentina), Bild (Berlin, Germany), El Colombiano (Medell√≠n, Colombia), El Tiempo (Bogot√°, Colombia), The Dallas Morning News (Dallas, Texas, United States of America), El Comercio (Lima, Peru), and Exc√©lsior (Mexico City, Mexico).

He was born and died in Seville, where he lived for the majority of his life and for which there is always a special affection in his writings. He studied humanities and law at Seville and Salamanca universities. He maintained correspondence with Erasmus of Rotterdam, Luis Vives and Juan Gines de Sepulveda. In 1548, he was appointed official chronicler of the court of Emperor Charles V. His major work is Silva de varia lecci√≥n (A Miscellany of Several Lessons) (1540), which became an early best seller across Europe. It was reprinted 17 times in the sixteenth century and was translated into Italian (1542), French (1552) and English (1571). Within a century, Silva reached 31 editions in Spanish, and 75 in foreign languages. It is an encyclopedic miscellany or mixture of subjects of interest across the diverse repertoire of humanistic knowledge of the time. The work takes material from the Attic Nights by Aulus Gellius, the Banquet of the Sophists by Athenaeus, the Saturnalia of Macrobius, the Memorable deeds and sayings of Valerius Maximus, the Inventor of all things by Polidoro Virgilio, the Moralia and Parallel Lives of Plutarch and, above all, the Natural History of Pliny the Elder. It also contains work by Erasmus of Rotterdam. Traces of this miscellany can be found in works by Mateo Alem√°n, Miguel de Cervantes, Shakespeare and Montaigne, to mention only a few of the authors he influenced.

Jones proposed to construct of railroad.Official Guide of the Railways, January 1910, page 570. Construction work started soon and on April 23, 1909, the first official train ran the eight miles (12.9 km) from Abilene to Iberis, Texas. From September 11 the same year, the road was operating from Abilene to Ballinger, Texas, a total of , where a connection to a branch line of the Gulf, Colorado and Santa Fe Railway was established. Finally, on October 1, 1910, a railroad from Anson, Texas to Hamlin, Texas () was opened. Plans for further extensions to Sonora and San Angelo, Texas were dropped soon thereafter. Between Abilene and Anson (), the Abilene & Southern used existing tracks built in 1907 by the Abilene and Northern Railway and meanwhile operated by the Colorado and Southern Railway. The total trackage used by the Abilene & Southern was . On April 25, 1927, the Texas and Pacific Railway was authorized by the Interstate Commerce Commission to buy the entire stock of the Abilene & Southern which continued to operate the road. The ICC allowed abandonment of the Anson‚ÄìHamlin track including the end of the trackage rights over the railroad from Abilene to Anson on January 9, 1937, and in February that year operations north of Abilene ceased. The stretch from Winters to Ballinger () lost rail traffic in 1972 and was torn up. In 1976 the Texas & Pacific merged with the Missouri Pacific Railroad and the Abilene & Southern ceased to exist on November 1, 1978,Texas State Historical Association when it was also merged with the Missouri Pacific. The remaining railroad from Abilene to Winters was later abandoned.  Passenger operations  Before the railroad to Hamlin was opened, there was one daily train from Abilene to Ballinger. With the new road, a second train, running daily except Sunday from Hamlin to Ballinger, was inaugurated.Official Guide of the Railways, November 1913, page 1314. Passenger trains ceased to use the Colorado & Southern trackage between Abilene and Anson during World War I and the Hamlin train now ran only between Anson and Hamlin.Official Guide of the Railways, March 1920, page 684. Later the link was reestablished and the Hamlin train now ran to Abilene, but the Abilene‚ÄìBallinger train was dropped on Sundays. In 1926, both trains operated as mixed train s.Official Guide of the Railways, June 1926, page 1024. In December 1941 regular passenger service ended. The mixed train now ran on irregular schedule subject to freight connections.Official Guide of the Railways, June 1943, page 714. This lasted until May 1957 when the line became freight-only.

The movement was a collection of unassociated individuals and organizations. The movement developed in the aftermath of the Panic of 1873 that led to a recession in the United States and parts of the western European economy. It assailed Jews and capitalism; along with this critique it opposed liberalism and it represented a fear of social democracy. Finally, the movement came out of a racial conception of national identity on the part of the German middle class. The movement had several leaders. The journalist and author Otto Glagau led a journal, Der Kulturk√§mpfer, [The Culture Warrior] that propagated these ideas. The Lutheran theologian and politician, Adolf Stoecker, led the Christian Social Party. He was the only elected representative of the party in the Reichstag. The movement lost strength after the CSP's losses in the 1887 elections. Additionally, the Chancellor Otto von Bismarck distanced himself from the party. The significance of the movement laid in its being the first anti-Semitic movement in modern Germany.

The rally, organised by the Coalition for Clean and Fair Elections (Bersih), was supported by Pakatan Rakyat, the coalition of the three largest opposition parties in Malaysia, but was deemed illegal by the government. Bersih, chaired by former president of the Bar Council Ambiga Sreenevasan, were pushing the Election Commission of Malaysia (EC) to ensure free and fair elections in Malaysia. It demanded that the EC clean up the electoral roll, reform postal voting, use indelible ink, introduce a minimum 21-day campaign period, allow all parties free access to the media, and put an end to electoral fraud. The police vowed to stop any rallies from taking place on the planned date on the grounds that all public gatherings without police permits are illegal. Having originally planned to march through the streets of Kuala Lumpur, Bersih decided to hold its rally at Merdeka Stadium after consultations with the Yang di-Pertuan Agong, Malaysia's head of state. Supporters of Bersih claim that demands for electoral reform made during the 2007 demonstration fell on deaf ears. UMNO Youth and Perkasa planned counter-rallies, dismissing Bersih's demands for electoral reform, but Perkasa called off its counter-rally due to its inability to secure a venue and permit. Estimates of the turnout ranged between 10,000 and over 20,000. The protesters were unable to congregate at Merdeka Stadium as many were forced to disperse by police who were heavily deployed throughout the city. Police arrested more than 1600 protesters, including Ambiga and several opposition figures. Background The ruling coalition in Malaysia, Barisan Nasional (BN), which consists of parties representing the major racial groups in Malaysia, has won every federal election since independence in 1957. Opposition parties and civil society organisations have long claimed that BN has been manipulating elections in its favour. Pan-Malaysian Islamic Party (PAS) deputy president Mohamad Sabu said there were many \\"concerns\\" about how the next general election will be conducted. He accused BN of cheating tactics, including registering foreign nationals as BN voters. PAS information chief Tuan Ibrahim Tuan Man said the EC and the National Registration Department (NRD) \\"were committing abuses,\\" and that there were \\"rampant media abuses.\\" Democratic Action Party (DAP) member of parliament Teresa Kok accused BN of \\"gerrymandering\\" and \\"malapportioning\\" electoral constituencies. She also pointed out how the opposition parties' share of seats in parliament was a lot less than their share of the popular vote. Leader of the Opposition Anwar Ibrahim claimed that BN would lose power if elections were free and fair. Civil society organisation Aliran claimed that there are \\"severe restrictions on political freedom\\" on opposition politicians in Malaysia. It highlighted structural problems such as access to the media, short notices of election dates, and short campaign periods. Human rights group SUARAM also claim abuses by the ruling party such as gerrymandering constituencies, using public funds for projects to win political support, and the \\"unscrutinised\\" counting of postal ballots. Transparency International's Malaysian branch, criticising both BN and opposition parties, spoke out against financial rewards promised by political parties to voters while campaigning, calling the practice \\"vote buying\\" and \\"corrupt.\\" Both the Election Commission and BN have denied allegations of abuse. =Protests in Malaysia= Street demonstrations are rare in Malaysia, but the public has become more vocal with the rise of alternative media and a resurgent opposition. Gatherings in Malaysia of five or more people must receive a police permit, which is rarely granted. The government has used heavy police presence to block rallies as well as arrest protest leaders to stop illegal public protests. Former prime minister Abdullah Ahmad Badawi said he was willing to sacrifice public freedoms in the interest of national stability. Four rallies in 2007 ended with arrests made by police. A protest in 2009 against the Internal Security Act was also broken up by tear gas and water cannons. =Bersih= A scene from the 2007 rally. Protesters on the left are dressed in yellow. They are met by the Federal Reserve Unit, the riot police (in red helmets). Standing in between the protesters and the riot police are PAS's Jabatan Amal volunteer unit (dressed in maroon). Bersih, short for the Coalition for Clean and Fair Elections (), is a coalition of 62 non-governmental organisations founded in November 2006. Since its founding, Bersih has been supported by the three main opposition parties, Parti Keadilan Rakyat (PKR), PAS, and DAP. Bersih is the Malay word for \\"clean\\" in reference to the claims of large scale corruption in the leading party. The first Bersih rally on 10 November 2007 was estimated to have drawn between 30,000 and 50,000 people. It was broken up by police using tear gas and chemical-laced water cannons. The rally was said to play a major role in helping the opposition parties make big gains in the 2008 general election. Bersih 2.0, as the organisation branded itself for the 2011 rally, is chaired by former Bar Council president Ambiga Sreenevasan. Ambiga served as president of the Bar from 2007 to 2009 and is a recipient of the US State Department's International Women of Courage Awards. =Demands= Ambiga has summed up the main issues raised by the organisation she leads as \\"unhappiness... in the Sarawak [election], unhappiness about corruption, [and] unhappiness about the independence of our institutions.\\" She said demands made during the first rally in 2007 have not been addressed, hence the follow-up rally. The communiqu√© issued by Bersih issued in 2007 called for reforms to Malaysia's first-past-the-post electoral system, ensuring the independence of the Election Commission (EC), eliminating electoral practices deemed unfair to opposition candidates, eliminating corrupt campaign practices, equal access to the media for all political parties, and instituting a caretaker government during election periods, among others in the long term. The 2011 rally's immediate demands were: # Clean the electoral roll # Reform postal voting # Use of indelible ink # A minimum campaign period of 21 days # Free and fair access to mainstream media # Strengthen public institutions # Stop corruption # Stop dirty politics After agreeing to abandon plans for a street demonstration, Bersih also called for a Royal Commission into election practices. =Plans= The rally's original plan was to have protesters gather at the KL Sogo shopping center, Kuala Lumpur City Hall building, and the Kampung Baru Mosque before marching to the Istana Negara to deliver a memorandum to the Yang di-Pertuan Agong. After consultations with the King, Bersih decided to hold the rally in a stadium instead. However, their request to use Merdeka Stadium was rejected by police. Bersih accused the government of reneging on a previous offer to let them rally in a stadium instead of the streets. Bersih insisted on gathering at Merdeka Stadium, despite preventative measures taken by police. Abroad Simultaneous rallies in support of Bersih were planned by Malaysian citizens in more than 30 cities in New Zealand, Australia, Japan, South Korea, the Philippines, Taiwan, Hong Kong, Singapore, Thailand, Indonesia, Egypt, Switzerland, Sweden, Austria, France, Great Britain, Ireland, Canada, the United States and Cambodia. Lead-up to the rally =Announcement= After frustration at by being shut out of observing the April 2011 Sarawak election, Bersih announced in a press release on 26 May that it had decided to organise a gathering on 9 July to press for electoral reform. =Counter-rallies= Perkasa Malay Supremacy movement Perkasa spoke out strongly against the rally. On 15 June, Perkasa announced that it had secured the support of over 30 non-governmental organisations and challenged Bersih organisers over who could stage a bigger rally on 9 July. It called on Bersih to cancel its rally, warning that clashes might occur. Perkasa president Ibrahim Ali warned \\"[If they proceed] there will be a clash. If that happens, it is for the better.\\" On 19 June, Perkasa held a gathering to protest the Bersih rally and to launch an opposing coalition of NGOs known as Gerak Aman. During the gathering, images of Ambiga‚Äîdescribed by flyers as \\"a dangerous Hindu woman\\"‚Äîwere burned, while Ibrahim warned the Chinese community not to participate in the Bersih rally. On 8 July, Perkasa announced the cancellation of its counter-rally due to its inability to secure a venue and a police permit. UMNO Youth UMNO Youth leader Khairy Jamaluddin announced that UMNO Youth will hold another rally on the same day (known as the \\"Patriot Rally\\" or Himpunan Patriot) to \\"strengthen the democratic system\\" and show that \\"the voice of the people does not belong only to the opposition.\\" He added that they had \\"a right to assembly guaranteed by the constitution.\\" Khairy and Ibrahim became involved in a war of words over the latter's comments on regarding the Chinese community, with each side calling for the other to be investigated under the Sedition Act. Ibrahim later backtracked from his comments. UMNO Youth's plan was to gather at Bukit Bintang and possibly march towards Merdeka Stadium. =Election Commission reaction= Bersih's demands were repeatedly dismissed by the Election Commission (EC), who sought to tie the organisation to the opposition's agenda. EC deputy chairman Wan Ahmad Wan Omar claimed Bersih was working with Pakatan Rakyat to \\"overthrow the government.\\" In turn, Ambiga criticised the EC's conduct, asking them to remain independent from politics. On 20 June, the EC extended an offer to Bersih to meet and discuss its demands, on the condition that the rally be called off. He claimed that during a previous meeting with Bersih in 2010, it had agreed that its demands were met. Bersih rejected the EC's offer. Speaking to reporters while observing the Thai general election in July, Abdul Aziz said the EC was considering allowing international observers to monitor the next Malaysian general election. =Government reaction= Prime minister Najib Razak warned that Bersih would be responsible if chaos ensued from the rally. Home Minister Hishamuddin Hussein warned against the rally, fearing the chaos that might ensue. He affirmed on 7 June that the rally was \\"illegal,\\" and urged the organisers to call it off. He promised to clamp down on demonstrators if they threatened national security. On 22 June, he confirmed that none of the three rallies would receive police permits to hold gatherings on 9 July. The government also outlawed the wearing and distribution of Bersih's yellow shirts and declared Bersih an illegal organisation under Section 5 of the Societies Act 1966. Bersih countered that as a coalition of groups it need not be registered. Najib initially offered Bersih the opportunity of holding the rally in a stadium instead of the streets. The government later rejected Bersih's request to hold the rally at Merdeka Stadium, and asked them to use a stadium in Selangor instead. However, the Sultan of Selangor had previously condemned demonstrations. =Opposition reaction= PAS deputy president Mohamad Sabu gave the rally his party's full backing. Calling the event the \\"Walk for Democracy,\\" he asked for 300,000 PAS members to attend the gathering. PAS president Abdul Hadi Awang ordered all of its members (numbering one million) to join the rally. The Leader of the Opposition, Anwar Ibrahim, will also take part in the rally. The DAP also pledged support for the rally. On 19 June, Anwar reportedly told members of his Parti Keadilan Rakyat (PKR) that he would ask Ambiga to cancel the rally if the government met Bersih's demands. His statement was rebuffed by Ambiga the following day. Anwar later claimed he was misquoted. This incident was criticised by ruling coalition parties, who have argued that the rally is in fact an opposition tool to gain support. =Non- governmental organisations= The Bersih rally was backed by the Human Rights Commission of Malaysia (Suhakam), Transparency International Malaysia (TI-M), and the Malaysian Consultative Council of Buddhism, Christianity, Hinduism, Sikhism and Taoism (MCCBCHST). The MCCBCHST also backed Perkasa and UMNO Youth's right to hold their rallies. Amnesty International called on the government to end the \\"mass repression\\" of Bersih activists. Human Rights Watch urged the government to release all detained activists, return confiscated material, and permit the rally to proceed. Deputy Asia director Phil Robertson said \\"Governments that elected Malaysia to a second term on the UN Human Rights Council might feel duped.\\" The Asia-Europe Peoples' Forum (AEPF), consisting of 120 international NGOs, condemned the Malaysian government for the crackdown on activists. =International response= On 5 July, the Office of the United Nations High Commissioner for Human Rights voiced concern about the restriction of freedom of expression in Malaysia and urged the government to release detained Bersih activists. =Threats of violence= On 23 June, Ambiga received a death threat via text message. She remained defiant, saying \\"nothing has changed\\" and the rally will go on. The grandmaster of the Malaysian Silat Lincah Organisation (PSSLM) reportedly threatened to \\"wage war\\" against Bersih activists. Najib subsequently endorsed silat groups, including PSSLM. =Yang di-Pertuan Agong's intervention= Malaysia's head of state, the Yang di-Pertuan Agong, Tuanku Mizan Zainal Abidin, issued a statement on 3 July urging moderation by all parties. He said \\"street demonstrations bring more bad than good although the original intention is good,\\" and called for Bersih to resolve its differences with the government peacefully. He also expressed confidence in Prime Minister Najib Razak's administration. Following an audience with the King, Ambiga announced that Bersih accepted the government's offer to hold the rally in a stadium instead of the streets. Despite Bersih's meeting with the King, the government maintained its stance that Bersih is illegal. =Police reports and reaction= At least 2,136 police reports, from business operators, travel agencies, and UMNO Youth, were filed against Bersih since the rally's announcement. On 15 June, the police announced that permits would not be issued for any rally, saying that the rallies would \\"disturb the peace\\" and \\"cause traffic chaos.\\" Bersih remained defiant despite not receiving the permit, and promised to co-operate with police during the gathering. Police also investigated allegations that Ambiga received funds from foreign NGOs \\"to cause chaos in Malaysia.\\" Police recorded statements from Ambiga, Ibrahim, and opposition politicians ahead of the rally. On 1 July, the police ceased discussions with Bersih, Perkasa and UMNO Youth and promised to prevent any street rallies from taking place. Pre-rally arrests and raids The police enforced road blocks throughout the city to discourage turnout. More than 150 people were arrested before 9 July for Bersih-related activities, including distributing leaflets. Most were released after several hours of questioning. 30 members of Parti Sosialis Malaysia (PSM) were arrested in Penang on 26 June on suspicion of spreading communism and conspiring to overthrow the government. Six members, including MP Michael Jeyakumar Devaraj, remain held under the Emergency Ordinance 1969, which allows indefinite detention without trial. Police also raided and vandalised Bersih's office in Petaling Jaya on 30 June. One day before the planned rally, police released a list of 91 individuals, including Ambiga, Khairy and Ibrahim, barred from entering Kuala Lumpur's central business district on 9 July. Lockdown Police began imposing roadblocks in the Klang Valley on Wednesday, 6 July, which led to massive traffic congestion and complaints from the public. They described it as a \\"preventive\\" move to stop protesters from participating in the protest. On 8 July, police sealed off Merdeka Square and rolled in water cannon and riot police trucks. At midnight on 9 July, major roads in the city was shut and public transportation suspended. Protests Kuala Lumpur was described as a \\"ghost town\\" on the morning of 9 July. Many offices and shops were closed as police maintained heavy presences in key areas. Crowds began pouring in by noon, where they were met by police who took \\"extraordinary\\" security measures, known as \\"Operation Erase Bersih.\\" Many were arrested and transported to the police training center (Pulapol). The protesters were arrested under Section 27 of the Police Act for planning to participate in illegal rallies, and face several years in prison if convicted. Protesters marching the streets of Kuala Lumpur peacefully before the police confronted them. A member of the Federal Reserve Unit prepares to disperse the protesters with tear gas. The police force charging at a crowd of regrouping protesters. Independent assessments put the rally numbers at between 10,000 and over 20,000, while Bersih claimed a turnout of 50,000. Major gathering points included Menara Maybank, Jalan Pudu, and Puduraya where riot police confronted protesters. Thousands tried to reach Merdeka Stadium from various parts of the city, chanting \\"Hidup rakyat!\\" (\\"Long live the people!\\"). Police responded by firing numerous rounds of tear gas and chemical-laced water, causing the crowds to disperse into nearby buildings. Police continued to fire tear gas and chemical-laced water at the buildings. Many buildings were targeted by the police including a hospital which the police denied happened even though there are pictures of the water cannons spraying the hospital. At 14:00, Bersih and Pakatan Rakyat leaders began their march towards Merdeka Stadium. Shielded by hundreds of supporters, they pushed past three lines of police personnel awaiting them outside KL Sentral. Around 14:30, while walking with supporters in Brickfields, Ambiga and fellow steering committee member Maria Chin Abdullah were arrested. Opposition politicians detained include Abdul Hadi Awang, Mohamad Sabu, Salahuddin Ayub, Mahfuz Omar, Dzulkefly Ahmad, Azmin Ali, Tian Chua, Fuziah Salleh, Sivarasa Rasiah, and Ngeh Koo Ham. Anwar Ibrahim said he sustained a bruise on his head and a cut leg when police fired live rounds. PAS MP Khalid Samad was said to have suffered a serious head injury and was admitted to hospital. UMNO Youth's rally in Bukit Bintang however, was allowed to on peacefully without intervention from the police. Around 1,000 protesters eventually reached Merdeka Stadium, including national laureate A. Samad Said and PAS's Husam Musa. At around 16:00, the crowd voluntarily began dispersing. However, police continued to fire tear gas and chemical-laced water at any individual and moved in to arrest them. Another group of protesters tried to reach the National Palace, while a third group gathered at Kuala Lumpur City Centre (KLCC) Park beneath the Petronas Twin Towers. Thousands eventually gathered at KLCC but were dispersed by police using tear gas and chemically-laced water. By 18:40 in the evening, police had confirmed 1,667 arrests, including 167 females and minors. Most of the arrested protesters, including Ambiga, were freed by the end of the day. One death was reported. Protester Baharuddin Ahmad accidentally inhaled tear gas fired by police. He was later arrested, but when he started to black out police didn't do anything and just stood there and watched. He was restrained by handcuffs which made the matters worse and he wasn't released because police lost the keys. After 15 minutes, an ambulance was called but never arrived. Finally, a volunteer took Baharuddin to a nearby hospital but it was already too late. Police said he died of heart complications.http://www.malaysiakini.com/news/169469http://www.malaysiakini.com/news/169480 =International protests= Bersih rallies also commenced in Melbourne, Sydney, Perth, Adelaide, Brisbane and Canberra, Australia, attracting around 750 people, 300 people, 200 people, 150 people, 50 people and 30 people respectively. Rallies were also reported in Auckland, Wellington and Christchurch, New Zealand,http://www.greenleft.org.au/node/48113 as well as in London, England. A gathering of about 120 people was reported at the Speaker's Corner at Hong Lim Park, Singapore.http://www.straitstimes.com/BreakingNews/Singapore/Story/STIStory_689148.html Further rallies were reported in central Hong Kong,http://www.malaysiakini.com/news/169410 Taiwan,http://www.taipeitimes.com/News/taiwan/archives/2011/07/10/2003507872 Japan, South Korea, Switzerland, Sweden, France, England, Scotland, Ireland, Canada and the United States. Aftermath National laureate A. Samad Said called the rally a \\"great success\\", lauding the multiracial unity among the protesters. Ambiga, speaking after being released, congratulated those who attended the rally, saying \\"we were not intimidated.\\" The Bersih leadership commended protesters for behaving peacefully and condemned the police for reacting harshly to the demonstration. They said the gathering was \\"not the end, it is but one more step in the long walk for clean and fair elections in Malaysia.\\" Leader of the Opposition Anwar Ibrahim said the rally was a \\"success\\" despite \\"police brutality.\\" DAP secretary-general Lim Guan Eng said the \\"police abuse\\" was \\"a big blow to the image of Malaysia.\\" Prime Minister Najib Razak downplayed the rally, insisting it only represented a minority of the population. He also said the anti-government sentiment among the protesters confirmed the government's fears that Bersih's agenda had been hijacked by the opposition. Home Minister Hishamuddin Hussein praised the police for keeping the rally under control and said the rally revealed itself to be an opposition plot. The United States expressed concern over the crackdown. State Department spokesman Mark Toner said \\"We stand for... the right for people to freely express their democratic aspirations and express their views freely.\\" Amnesty International released a statement saying: \\"This brutal crackdown on peaceful protesters is undermining Malaysia‚Äôs claim to be a moderate democracy. Mr. Najib‚Äôs government has chosen the path of repression, not reform.\\" Lawyers for Liberty released a statement saying that the police deliberately shot gas canisters against the protesters.http://www.malaysiakini.com/news/169623 =Reform proposals= On 15 August 2011, Najib announced that a parliamentary select committee will be formed to examine the electoral system. He said the committee will consist of members of parliament from both the government and opposition coalition who will discuss electoral reform issues \\"so that a mutual agreement can be reached.\\" In his Malaysia Day 2011 address in September, Najib announced the government's intentions to repeal the Internal Security Act, Emergency Ordinance, remove the annual renewal of press and publication permits, and review Section 27 of the Police Act. In November 2011, the government tabled the Peaceful Assembly Act to replace Section 27 of the Police Act. Coverage and analysis =Pre-rally= The lead-up to the rally has received polarising coverage in Malaysia's print and internet news media. Malaysia's print media are subject to the Printing Presses and Publications Act, which stipulates they can only publish with a license granted by the Ministry of Home Affairs. A news website has alleged that the Malaysian Communications and Multimedia Commission instructed radio and television stations to omit coverage of police violence and focus on the damage done by rally participants. State news agency Bernama quoted several political analysts saying that the rally will tarnish Malaysia's image abroad and is a distraction from Anwar Ibrahim's ongoing sodomy trials. It claimed the 1998 demonstrations against Anwar's arrest and the 2007 Bersih rally caused \\"inconvenience to the public and damage to public property, attracting bad publicity from the international media.\\" One analyst said elections are \\"already fair as fair can be.\\" Bernama also reported analysts saying that Ambiga has a history of provoking Muslims and working against interests of the Malay community. Print media Utusan Malaysia, a newspaper owned by the United Malays National Organisation (UMNO), a governing party, criticised the rally as \\"dirty\\" on a 12 June editorial. In particular, it made reference to Anwar's sodomy trial and sex video allegations, calling him a hypocrite and urging Malaysians to protest against the opposition leader instead. It also warned against disunity among Malays, and claimed that the DAP, backed strongly by Chinese constituents, would benefit most from the rally. Utusan reported that 70 percent of the 1000 who attended the Bersih 2.0 pre-launch on 19 June were non-Malay. The newspaper has also portrayed the rally as anti- Islam. They quoted pro-UMNO political analysts attacking Ambiga for \\"angering Muslims and Malays,\\" as well as reported that foreign Christian organisations are funding the rally. Tay Tian Yan wrote in the Sin Chew Daily, the highest circulated daily in Malaysia, that the rally is a repeat scenario of the 2007 protest, where the opposition cashed in on public discontent over rising prices and staged the rally to generate momentum ahead of the general election. He also noted that the counter-rally by UMNO Youth is a ploy by BN to mitigate the Bersih rally's momentum, as opposed to suppressing the rally outright, which he said would swing public opinion against BN. Lim Sue Goan noted the involvement of Pakatan Rakyat and UMNO in opposite rallies, and said the event has grown from becoming a mere march to demand free elections to a political showdown between the government and opposition. In a 22 June editorial, The Star, owned by the Malaysian Chinese Association (MCA), also a governing party, said opposition parties are colluding with the rally's organisers to discredit the authorities in an attempt to gain support ahead of the elections. It accused Bersih of \\"[creating] cynical distrust in the authorities to give [themselves] and their political ringleaders a psychological advantage.\\" Johan Jaaffar, chairman of Media Prima (owned by UMNO), the parent company of the New Straits Times, wrote in the paper: \\"The government of the day is not perfect. So, too, the system... we don't solve problems on the streets. That's not us, nor our way.\\" M Faqih, writing in the PAS organ Harakah Daily, compared the planned rally to the September 1998 protests in Kuala Lumpur against then-deputy prime minister Anwar Ibrahim's sacking and detention on sodomy and corruption charges, which he described as peaceful unlike the revolutions in Tunisia and Egypt. He called on the opposition to seize the initiative with public discontent over government policies and use the rally as a stepping stone to victory in next general election. Internet news Josh Hong of Malaysiakini questioned the law requiring protest organisers to obtain permits, saying the freedom of speech and right to assembly are guaranteed by the Constitution. He also criticised the government's record of cracking down civil rights campaigners and political activists and the mainstream media's demonisation of the Bersih rally. Fellow columnists Mariam Mokhtar and Dean Johns criticised the government's crackdown on Bersih. News website The Malaysian Insider called the government's tough stand against the Bersih rally \\"double standards,\\" deriding the government's non-action against Ibrahim Ali, who had earlier called for jihad against Christians. It also blamed the police for the chaos that occurred during the 2007 rally and dismissed the government's concern for national security and threat to tourism as self-caused. The website reported analysts saying the rally will help PAS cement the growing support the party has gained among the Malay community. Free Malaysia Today, another news website, argued in favour of the rally, saying that concerns that it will serve as a \\"spring offensive\\" to overthrow the government are exaggerated. It lamented what it perceived as Malaysia's flawed democracy, saying \\"[there] are two ways to punish political perverts who have raped democracy: vote them out or take to the streets.\\" It also criticised the government for threatening to clamp down on protesters, saying that the ruling coalition is using public order as an excuse to preserve its stay in power. In another editorial the day before the rally, FMT was highly critical of the government, asking the people to \\"decide the course of history\\" and defy a \\"harsh and repressive\\" state. International In an op-ed for The Wall Street Journal, former US ambassador to Malaysia John R. Malott said Najib's UMNO is \\"running scared\\" of losing power and is waging a campaign of intimidation against Bersih. He called the protest \\"a brave step\\" towards the country's transition to full democracy. Professor Clive Kessler of the University of New South Wales in an interview with ABC Radio stated that the Agong's intervention was a rebuke to Umno and the government and an acknowledgement of Bersih‚Äôs legitimacy. =Reactions to the rally= Newspapers owned by Barisan Nasional parties were highly critical of the rally, accusing Bersih of disturbing the peace. Utusan Malaysia called the police operation to foil the illegal rally a success. The Star remarked in an editorial the following day: \\"If every complaint made one or the other party take to the streets, bringing a city to a standstill, people would not be getting much work done.\\" It said Bersih achieved the publicity it sought, and that everyone should move on. The New Straits Times said there was \\"no winner in this madness\\" as many were hurt, and \\"Bersih's intentions were hijacked by the opposition coalition.\\" NST's 10 July front page featured a photo of a protester throwing an object with the headline \\"Peaceful?\\" The Malaysian Insiders Debra Chong said Najib's administration \\"took a massive punch to its gut,\\" as accounts of police personnel using tear gas and water cannons against unarmed civilians were reported by international media. She said the rally showed the willingness of the middle class and civil society to stand up to the government. TMI's Sheridan Mahavera said the rally was a display of racial unity. Jeswan Kaur of Free Malaysia Today said Najib and the police were to blame for the chaotic scenes. Ibrahim Suffian, head of the Merdeka Center, an independent think tank, said the actions of Bersih and the government polarised Malaysians of opposite political opinions. \\"For Pakatan Rakyat supporters, it has just increased their scepticism of the [BN- ruled] government. For those who are pro-government, it has hardened their belief that the PR is out to cause trouble.\\" One analyst accused Barisan Nasional of abusing public institutions to protect its power, while another added that \\"the police lost more credibility than the protesters.\\" International reaction was unanimously critical of the government. The Singapore Straits Times added that Malaysian society has been polarised by the country‚Äôs divisive politics as clearly demonstrated when thousands braved a security lockdown of Kuala Lumpur. In an editorial, the Jakarta Post described Malaysia as a \\"rich but not free\\" country, with its leaders still \\"laboring under an old paradigm\\" and refusing to allow its people to exercise their rights to free speech by invoking racial tension. Al Jazeera English's Teymoor Nabili said the government acted out of fear of an Egypt-style revolution. Bloomberg columnist William Pesek calls the rally a part of the \\"rising call for political change in Asia\\" that play a decisive role in foreign investment to Asian countries. The Asian Sentinel stated that although Najib Tun Razak appears to have won the battle by closing down Kuala Lumpur on Saturday and arresting 1,667 mostly peaceful marchers and would-be marchers, the consensus seems to be that Malaysia has suffered a blow to its international reputation as a moderate, democratic country.http://www.asiasentinel.com/index.php?option=com_content&task;=view&id;=3307&Itemid;=251 The Guardians Simon Tisdall slammed Malaysian Prime Minister Najib Razak's harsh treatment towards the peaceful rally participants, noting that the British Prime Minister David Cameron should tell Najib that \\"strong-arm tactics against protesters are unacceptable\\" and that \\"Malaysia's leaders should wake up and smell the coffee\\".Malaysia's Najib must abandon the Mubarak model =Censorship= The Economists coverage of the rally was partially censored by the government. Four lines in the article titled \\"Taken to the cleaners ‚Äì an overzealous government response to an opposition rally\\" was inked out. Najib later admitted that censoring parts of the article was a mistake which generated negative publicity. Criticism =Election Commission= The Election Commission of Malaysia (EC) has dismissed Bersih's claims, saying that it has already met the organisation's demands. EC chairman Abdul Aziz Mohd Yusof, who met with Bersih officials in December 2010, slammed Bersih chairman Ambiga's knowledge of voter registration as \\"shallow.\\" Abdul Aziz also claimed that Bersih had a political agenda, saying that the opposition parties were propping up the organisation. He claimed the opposition were using the EC as a scapegoat for political gain. Response to demands * Responding to Bersih's demand that voter registration be automatic once a citizen reaches voting age, Abdul Aziz said such a proposal would contravene Article 119 (4) of the Constitution, which he claims clearly states that registration as a voter can only be done through application by the voter him/herself. EC deputy chairman Wan Ahmad Wan Omar added that unregistered voters are \\"indifferent,\\" and will not bother to vote anyway. * Abdul Aziz also defended against allegations that the EC is lackadaisical in tackling phantom voting. He said that the EC cannot strike names of dead voters off the electoral roll unless the family of a dead voter requests it and produces the dead voter's death certificate. He also blamed allegations of voting in multiple constituencies on voters who refuse to change the addresses on their identification cards when they move homes. * Wan Ahmad said the use of indelible ink is \\"regressive\\" and only practised in less developed countries. He also raised the possibility of voters not wanting their fingers inked and voters who somehow inked their fingers before voting. Abdul Aziz said the EC was considering a biometric fingerprinting system instead. * Wan Ahmad said a 21-day campaign period is \\"unnecessary\\" as Malaysia has a relatively small land area and population. =Government= The rally has been roundly criticised by government politicians, who claim that the opposition are using the rally, purportedly a non-partisan protest, to advance its own political agenda. Some ministers also accused the rally organisers of attempting a coup d'√©tat. Prime minister Najib said claims that elections are unfair \\"did not make sense,\\" adding that the opposition are using instability to their political advantage. He challenged them to take on the government in the polls instead. The Home Minister, Hishamuddin, responding to early reports announcing the rally, criticised public demonstrations in particular. He slammed Bersih for trying to \\"instill hatred\\" and \\"show the world that our country is chaotic.\\" Deputy Prime Minister Muhyiddin Yassin said the planned rally is \\"undemocratic\\" and claimed that it is supported only by a small segment of the population. He also warned of foreign powers taking advantage of instability in Malaysia. =UMNO= UMNO's information chief Ahmad Maslan said that the event might risk damaging the economy and national security. UMNO Youth leader Khairy Jamaluddin said Anwar's attempts to exert influence over the rally on 19 June was proof that Bersih was \\"compromised\\" by the opposition. UMNO Youth executive council member Tengku Azman Tengku Zainol Abidin said public rallies should not be held on the streets and that the 2007 Bersih rally \\"achieved nothing.\\" Anwar's former political secretary Senator Ezam Mohd Noor called Anwar a hypocrite, saying that Anwar's own PKR party election in 2010 was rife with allegations of manipulation. =Perkasa= Perkasa has criticised the rally for threatening to spread chaos, claiming that the opposition will use the rally to trigger an uprising similar to Egypt and Libya. Perkasa president Ibrahim Ali also threw his support behind the EC, arguing that they had already answered demands for free and fair elections. Ibrahim Ali also warned Chinese community should avoid joining this rally and stay away from it by keeping food at home. =Independents= \\"Independent\\" Member of Parliament Zulkifli Nordin questioned the need for the rally, claiming that democracy was already \\"alive,\\" citing the result of the previous election as an example. Fellow independent MP Wee Choo Keong hinted that Bersih's cause is \\"politically motivated,\\" and advised Ambiga to join a political party instead of \\"hiding behind a non-governmental organisation.\\" =Business= Sections of the business community initially condemned the proposed street rally, arguing that business operators would have suffered losses on 9 July, a Saturday. Among the groups opposed to the rally were the KL and Selangor Indian Chamber of Commerce and Industry, the Malaysian Associated Indian Chamber of Commerce and Industry, and the Executive Taxi Owners' Association. UMNO encouraged business operators and taxi drivers to sue Bersih for any losses that may be caused by the rally.

He infamously committed his crimes while wearing a Ronald Reagan mask, earning him the nickname Pumpgun Ronnie. Kastenberger's criminal life was the basis for the 2010 film The Robber. On 25 January 1977 Kastenberger robbed a Volksbank branch in Pressbaum, making off with 70,000 Austrian Schillings (~‚Ç¨5,000). Shortly thereafter, police arrested Kastenberger on a train at Wien Westbahnhof based on descriptions given to police by the bank's employees. He served a seven-year prison sentence for the robbery. Upon release, he moved in with his girlfriend in the Simmering district of Vienna. On 13 August 1985 Kastenberger stormed the Raiffeisen Bank in Hafnerbach, but had to flee without having taken any money. The police suspected Kastenberger immediately, but his girlfriend gave him a false alibi. On 20 November 1987 he robbed the Raiffeisen Bank in Haunoldstein, making off with 88,000 Schillings (~‚Ç¨6,400). On 19 February 1988 he hit three banks in succession, making off with a combined total of more than 1.8 million Schillings (~‚Ç¨133,000). His biggest haul was on 21 March 1988, at a L√§nderbank in Vienna, where he captured two million Schillings (~‚Ç¨145,000). The next two days he robbed two more Viennese banks, netting one million Schillings for each. Murders On 13 August 1985, the same day he committed his first bank robbery after being released from prison, Kastenberger shot and killed Ewald Pollhammer, a 28-year-old man from Upper Austria with whom he had been annoyed during a vocational training course. Additionally, Kastenberger is regarded the prime suspect of three other murders: *Kastenberger is suspected of having robbed a gas station in Purkersdorf on 26 May 1984, shooting and killing 51-year-old station attendant Helene Bubendorfer with an assault rifle. *Kastenberger is suspected of using an assault rifle to kill officer Friedrich Roger in front of a police station in Vienna on 25 July 1986. *Kastenberger is suspected of using a stolen government service weapon to kill Brigitte Hranka, who worked as a prostitute. Arrest, flight and death On 11 November 1988 Kastenberger was arrested and convicted of all deeds, after which he made a confession. In his apartment, investigators found two keys for safe deposit boxes containing almost 5.5 million Schillings (~‚Ç¨400,000). Two days later, during his confession proceedings, Kastenberger jumped out the window on the first floor, landed on the hood of a parked car and escaped. The next day he tried to steal a woman's car in Gaaden, but fled when a police patrol drove by. The next day, he overpowered a man in Maria Enzersdorf, bound him and stole his car. The man freed himself and alerted police who discovered the stolen vehicle on the motorway shortly thereafter. Kastenberger noticed the police, pulled over to the guardrail, then ran through the woods and stole another vehicle in Waasen, with which he escaped via the West Highway. Just before Sankt P√∂lten, he broke through a roadblock and was shot in the back. Before Kastenberger could be apprehended by police, he took his own life with a gunshot to the head. The pursuit of Johann Kastenberger was the largest investigation in Austria's post-war history, involving more than 450 officers. Other Kastenberger was a successful marathon runner. In the 1980s he won several national races in Austria and in 1988 became the record holder of Kainach Mountain Marathon with a time of 3:16:07. In 2009, director Benjamin Heisenberg dramatized Kastenberger's career as a runner and bank robber in his film The Robber, with Andreas Lust in the title role, based on Martin Prinz's 2002 novel of the same name. The novel was translated into English in 2005 by Mike Mitchell and renamed On the Run. The film premiered in February 2010 at the 60th Berlin Film Festival.

The film, featuring M√©li√®s and his frequent collaborator Jehanne d'Alcy, is a version of the traditional artistic subject of the temptation of Saint Anthony, showing Anthony the Great's faith and chastity tested by visions. Synopsis Saint Anthony's devotions in a cave are disrupted by sudden appearances from young women, whom he banishes in attempts to return to his prayer book. The saint kisses a skull relic only for it to transform into a woman, who is rejoined by the others to encircle him before vanishing. The saint kneels before an image of Christ on the cross, only for this to transform into one of the women. He is finally saved by the appearance of an angel who returns all to normal. Production The popular artistic subject of Saint Anthony's temptation had already been filmed in 1896 by Eug√®ne Pirou, including the imagery in which the crucified Christ is transformed into a temptress. In M√©li√®s's version, he himself plays Saint Anthony, and Jehanne d'Alcy appears as one of the three temptresses. The special effects are worked using multiple exposures and substitution splices. Release The Temptation of Saint Anthony was completed in the winter of 1898‚Äì1899. It was released by M√©li√®s's Star Film Company and numbered 169 in its catalogues; the earliest English-language listing gives the title as Temptation of Saint Anthony, without an initial article. According to M√©li√®s's later recollections, when the film was shown at one Paris fairground, the Foire du Tr√¥ne on the Cours de Vincennes, the Prefect of Police took umbrage at the sacrilege and had the film removed from the bill.

Located near Felicity in Clermont County, the site appears to have been a base camp for nomads during the Late Archaic period. The site comprises three loci: two significant areas of various debris and a large midden that underlies everything else. From these components, which cover an area of approximately by , collectors and archaeologists have recovered hundreds of artifacts, including stone tools, weapons, and bone tools. Because the site is located in a farm field, it has frequently been cultivated, and the plow has brought at least five burials to the surface from a cemetery on the edge of the site.Owen, Lorrie K., ed. Dictionary of Ohio Historic Places. Vol. 2. St. Clair Shores: Somerset, 1999, 138-139. Among the types of features found at the site are ovens, trash pits, and postmolds. Bodies at the site were generally adorned with red ochre and buried in a flexed position.Otto, Martha P., and Brian G. Redmond, eds. Transitions: Archaic and Early Woodland Research in the Ohio Country. Athens: Ohio UP, 2008, 344-345. The culture of the Bullskin Creek Site (so named because it sits atop a terrace above Bullskin Creek, near its mouth at the Ohio River) has been archaeologically classified as \\"Central Ohio Valley Archaic,\\" along with at least three other sites in Hamilton and Clermont counties. Like the other sites, which are known as Dravo Gravel, DuPont Village, and Logan, the Bullskin Creek Site is believed to have been inhabited during the middle portion of the Late Archaic, between 2750 and 1750 BC according to radiocarbon dating. Among the types of tools found both at Bullskin Creek and at the others are distinctive flint knives, parts of atlatls, and stone axes and pestles. These sites are distinguished from other Late Archaic sites in the region by the knives, which are of a type only found in the region surrounding the Great Miami River. Unique to Bullskin Creek was the presence of what appears to have been religious articles: one artifact cache comprised a wide range of artifacts that suggest that they were the collection of a shaman. Conversely, no grave goods were found with any of the burials. In the 1970s, excavations by the University of Cincinnati demonstrated that the Bullskin Creek Site was richer than any other site investigated by the university in the previous few years. Because of its archaeological value, the site was listed on the National Register of Historic Places in 1978.

Built on the site of the former Clarendon Hotel, the fa√ßade of the historic building was kept in the redevelopment and was protected by the New Zealand Historic Places Trust as a Category II heritage structure. Following damage from the February 2011 Christchurch earthquake, the 17-storey building has been demolished. History =Clarendon Hotel= The original Clarendon Hotel in 1902 prior to its demolition The first Clarendon, an early wooden hotel, was established in a former private house. It was located at 78 Worcester Street, on the corner of Oxford Terrace. The first occupier of the site was Guise Brittan in 1851, the land agent for the Canterbury Association. He operated the Christchurch land office, located diagonally opposite the intersection on the site that is these days occupied by Our City, a former home of the Christchurch City Council. Brittan sold his building in 1859 to Irish migrant Rowland Davis, who obtained a liquor licence and enlarged the house. Thus, the history of the site as a public house began. A subsequent owner, George Oram, changed the name of the hotel to Clarendon in 1866, after the then British foreign secretary, the Earl of Clarendon. The quality of the hotel was recognised in 1869 when the Duke of Edinburgh stayed there and bestowed on Oram the title of 'Hotel Keeper by Appointment to His Royal Highness Prince Alfred the Duke of Edinburgh'. The Clarendon Hotel was often used for inquests into drownings as it was located on the bank of the Avon River. It was also used as the departure point for Cobb and Co coaches to the West Coast. Clarendon Hotel soon after its construction in 1903 The much extended building was demolished and in 1902/03, a new hotel was erected for the Crown Brewery Company. Joseph Clarkson Maddison was the architect and he designed the three- storey building in Renaissance Revival style. Maddison was a notable architect in Christchurch at the time and designed 14 hotels over a period of 28 years (including Warner's and Carlton Hotels), the Old Government Building and the buildings for the New Zealand International Exhibition in 1906 in Hagley Park. The construction work was carried out by J. Otley. Some notable people stayed in the hotel, including the Duke of Edinburgh (1869), Lee Kuan Yew (the 1st Prime Minister of Singapore), King George VI (1948), Queen Elizabeth II (1954) and the Queen Mother (1958). The biggest crowd was drawn when The Beatles stayed here during their 1964 tour. Demolition of the hotel was first proposed in 1981, causing considerable controversy in Christchurch. Eventually, the Christchurch City Council suggested that the fa√ßade be retained with the redevelopment as an office high rise building. The hotel was demolished in 1986, with 2/3 of the Oxford Terrace and all of the Worcester Street fa√ßade being kept. =Clarendon Towers= Clarendon Tower at daybreak (2007) Clarendon Tower western side The 17-storey Clarendon Towers, designed by Warren and Mahoney, was constructed in 1986/87. It was the first example of facadism in Christchurch. Local artist Bill Sutton described the new creation as \\"a boy with his trousers around his ankles\\", a comment which many agreed with, whilst others were grateful for the retention of the historic fa√ßade. Heritage listing On 24 June 2005, the historic fa√ßade was registered by the New Zealand Historic Places Trust as a Category II historic place, with the registration number 1858. It marks the site where one of the pioneering Christchurch settlers, Brittan, had his first home. It was one of the early hotels, established in 1859 and it became one of the most notable hotels in Christchurch, accommodating notable guests. It is an example of one of the many important buildings designed by Maddison and it part of the heritage fabric of the area, with other notable buildings like the Public Trust Office Building and the second civic offices in Oxford Terrace, and the Avon Theatre and the Regent Theatre in Worcester Street. The Scott Statue is on the riverbank in front of the Clarendon Tower. Earthquake damage in 2011 The high rise was badly damaged by the February 2011 Christchurch earthquake. Internal staircases collapsed over several floors, with people in the building trapped for hours. The floors disconnected from the concrete frames, with the floors at risk of collapse. The Canterbury Earthquake Recovery Authority ordered the demolition of the high rise. Two demolition options were put forward by the building owners, including an option using explosives. The demolition method agreed on was 'cut and crane', where the building was cut into pieces that were removed by crane. Demolition finished in February 2013.

He rejects the use of the word primitive when discussing art because he argues that this implies that the origins and early development of art is then evident in art in modern cultures.Layton 1991: 1‚Äì4 (see) In his later theoretical work Robert Layton has also critically reflected on a theoretical approach outlined by Alfred Gell in Art and Agency.Art In particular, Layton focuses on Gell's definition of art as defined by the distinctive function it performs in advancing social relationships through 'the abduction of agency'. He focuses on Gell's employment of Charles Sanders Peirce's term 'index', and notes that Peirce's approach deflects attention from signification towards the link between art works and the things to which they refer. In doing so, he considers what Peirce meant by abduction, and concludes that while Gell made a good case for the agency of art objects he does not explain the distinctive ways in which art objects extend their maker's or user's agency.Layton, Robert H., 2003.

Pilot was John H. Turner. \\"Six officers and men of the army's 93rd bombardment pursuit squadron [sic], March field [sic], were killed yesterday when their 22-ton B-17 four-motored bomber crashed and burned at the 6,700-foot snow line of Marion mountain in the San Jacinto range. Four bodies were hurled from the giant flying fortress as it plunged into the boulder-strewn, heavily-wooded mountain slope, three miles northeast of Idyllwild, in the San Bernardino national forest. The victims: First Lieut. Harold J. Turner, pilot, Riverside, formerly of Corning, Iowa. First Lieut. Donald T. Ward, co-pilot, Riverside, formerly of West Los Angeles. First Lieut. Vernon McCauley, navigator, Riverside. Staff Sergt. Thomas F. Sweet, engineer, Riverside. Corp. Frank J. Jirak, assistant engineer, Salem, Ore. Pvt. James C. Sessions, radioman, Bisbee, Ariz. At 10:45 a.m. yesterday the plane appeared to encounter mechanical trouble. Ground witnesses at the Idyllwild inn and at Pine Cove, nearby, reported that it circled several times, its engines seemingly missing. Clouds closed in on the bomber at 8,000 feet, and in a few minutes, it roared earthward at full throttle. A rescue party arrived 20 minutes later from Pine Cove to find the plane a mass of red-hot, fused metal. Two bodies were in the smashed fuselage. The 105-foot [sic] wing had sheared through a big pine tree. Residents of the two resort towns said they had heard a loud explosion, indicating that the gasoline tanks ignited with the impact. The noise was heard as far as six miles. The crash occurred approximately 400 yards from the Banning-Idyllwild highway, near the home of Harris Marchant, writer. It was the first accident to one of the new Boeing four-motored bombers since the army air corps adopted them as standard equipment, although the original model smashed up at Dayton, Ohio, in 1935. Members of an army board of inquiry said at least two, and possibly three or all of the four motors were cut out at the time of the crash, although there was no apparent indication that any of the occupants had attempted to bail out. They expressed the theory that pilot Turner was attempting to shift gasoline tanks when he ran into a cloud bank that concealed the side of the mountain. Fliers in the squadron described the wrecked bomber as a ship which had caused difficulty in stalled motors twice in flights when it was stationed at Langley Field, Virginia. Lieutenant Turner was an army air corps reserve veteran of six years experience and was on a practice flight with the B-17. March field [sic] operates 36 of these bombers. With a full load, they can climb to 30,000 feet. Lieutenant Turner is survived by his widow, Kathryn, Riverside, and his father, J. H. Turner, Corning, Iowa. He was the nephew of former Iowa Gov. Dan W. Turner. Co-Pilot Ward leaves a widow in Riverside and a father, E. A. Ward, West Los Angeles. Navigator McCauley leaves his widow, Mrs. Virginia McCauley, Riverside. Sweet's widow, Mrs. Anna M. Sweet, lives in Riverside. Jirak's father, Frank J.

France. The screenplay concerns a man in Paris who turns out to be a doppelganger of a spy operating in the French capital. Plot While walking along a Paris street, Englishman Robert Stevens is shot by an unknown assailant, but luckily he is only struck glancingly and rendered unconscious. When he awakens in Beaujon Hospital, he initially thinks he was injured in an aeroplane crash. His father, Sir James Stevens, confirms he left England in an aeroplane, but ten days before. However, his father does not believe he cannot remember anything about those missing ten days. (It turns out that Robert is an irresponsible ne'er-do-well who had disappeared before.) Robert decides to find out what happened. His only clue is a note that was found on him signed by \\"D.\\" In an office, Fran√ßois is on the telephone telling someone that Barnes was shot and is in the hospital, but should be out soon. Lanson enters. He is worried that the police may be watching Barnes. He instructs Fran√ßois to get results, then returns to London. When Robert leaves the hospital, he begins making enquiries. Fran√ßois contacts him and directs him to Andr√©. Andr√© informs him that \\"Mademoiselle\\" is concerned that this shooting incident may bring unwanted police notice and end his usefulness. Robert confirms that Mademoiselle is \\"D\\". Andr√© orders him to rendezvous with Mademoiselle and that Lanson wants him \\"to keep a closer watch on Captain Victor\\". At the appointed place, an attractive blonde orders him to go home with her. An encounter with a policeman over a parking ticket reveals that she is Diane de Geurmantes and she believes him to be her chauffeur, Barnes. He finds that Barnes' driver's license photograph looks just like him. At Diane's palatial chateau, he encounters other residents, including Denise, a servant and one of Lanson's spies. He notices a photograph of a man in uniform signed \\"Victor\\" in Diane's suite. Denise tells him the captain, Diane's fianc√©, is here for dinner. After dinner, Diane retires, leaving the aged General de Guermantes, Victor and a British liaison officer to discuss military matters. The next day, the general is taken for an inspection of an extensive secret underground military facility that Lanson is desperate to locate. Meanwhile, Diane and \\"Barnes\\" drive out into the countryside to prepare an outdoor picnic for Victor and the general. However, they first fall into the water while trying to raise a tent, then they are chased up a tree by three dogs. Diane is annoyed at first, but later finds the mishaps amusing. After the wreckage of Robert's aeroplane and a charred, unidentified body are reported in the newspaper as having been found, Lanson goes to see Sir James. The latter has been warned by British military intelligence to pretend the body is that of his son, but Lanson suspects otherwise and sets a trap, sending a telegram to the chateau addressed to Robert Stevens, telling him to meet his father. Robert falls for it and is held at gunpoint by Andr√©, but manages to kill him and escape. Lanson discovers, purely by chance, that the general has a model of the installation at the chateau. He orders Denise to photograph it and, after learning that Andr√© is dead, sends a couple of men to pick up Robert. Robert overpowers Denise, locks her in a closet and takes her camera. Then he informs Diane what has been going on. While driving to the authorities, they are captured by Lanson's men, along with Denise's camera. With the information obtained from the film, Lanson decides to plant a bomb on the nightly ammunition train to destroy the installation. Robert manages to disarm the sole guard left behind and, by re-enacting William Tell's shooting of an apple from his son's head (this time with progressively smaller targets atop the henchman), persuades the man to tell all. While chasing the train, Robert and Diane reveal their feelings for each other. They are able to foil the sabotage, though Robert ends up back at the hospital. The woman who shot him initially is brought in; it turns out to have been a case of mistaken identity. Cast * Rex Harrison as Robert Stevens * Kaaren Verne as Diane de Guermantes * C.V.

It debuted on iTunes on June 6, 2011 and was later released on CD on August 23, 2011. History The original concept for the album was envisioned by singer/guitarist Billy McCarthy while touring with his previous band, Pela. The title was the first idea he had. McCarthy's experiences with his mother and brother, both of whom where diagnosed schizophrenic, influenced nearly all of the writing for the album. McCarthy, Sanderson and the other two members had recorded most of the original album, but decided to scrap about 80 percent of it \\"because it just wasn't strong.\\" Fights with their manager and record label along with disagreements within the band ultimately lead to the break up of Pela before the album could be finished. During that time, McCarthy's brother James committed suicide, further increasing the issues within the band. McCarthy and Sanderson stayed in contact and eventually recorded a new song, ‚ÄúBook of James‚Äù, with producer David Newfeld. The duo decided they wanted to finish the entire album. McCarthy and Sanderson worked on the tracks in Sanderson's home studio. Once they finished, they released the album independently through iTunes and UNFD. They announced their existence as a band by performing ‚ÄúBook of James‚Äù, ‚ÄúChapel Song‚Äù and other songs at the Cutting Room Studio with John Richards of KEXP. \\"Chapel Song\\" was featured on Starbucks' free 10-song Summer Mix sampler for 2011 and in a commercial for REI. A music video for \\"Chapel Song\\" was produced/directed by Matthew C. Mills, an Emmy Award-winning Director and owner of Spacestation, who is known for his work on MTV Unplugged. Critical reception The album has drawn high acclaim from critics. Justin Iger of Liquid Hip wrote, \\"Nearly every track on the 12-song album is perfectly executed as the set explores trying to carry on with life,\\" and gave the album a 9.9 out of 10. Ryan Masteller of Critical Masses praised the album's deep meaning - writing, \\"Rise Ye Sunken Ships plays like a transformation ‚Äì it‚Äôs horrific and captivating to see the stripping and reinterpretation of family meaning unfold as nakedly as it does.\\" Steve Rippin of The Beat-Play Experiment wrote, \\"This band is the real deal and they have the real life strife to back up raw emotion on their debut record.\\" Russell Mardell of Spike Magazine lauded McCarthy's vocals saying the album is, \\"brought to life in McCarthy‚Äôs astonishing vocals; a voice that could seep in to the soul as easily as it could break you to pieces.\\" Luke Dixon of Live4Ever (UK) enjoyed the album, especially the track ‚ÄúBook of James‚Äù (a tribute to McCarthy's brother), which he states is, \\"a fitting tribute...from the moment you hear the first crack of the snare drum in the intro you are hooked, drawn along by its energy, stylish breakdowns and lyrical poignancy.\\" Al Kaufman of Atlanta Music Guide referred to the album as \\"true genius\\" and predicted it would \\"end up on a lot of year end best-of lists.\\" Sherin Malick of Riot Magazine stated, \\"Rise Ye Sunken Ships is a perfect album.\\" iTunes named Rise Ye Sunken Ships \\"Best Alternative Album\\" of 2011 in their Rewind year-end review.

She was often credited as Mai Bacon. She was the eldest daughter of Mr. Hartley Bacon, who was living in Roundhay, Leeds at the time of The Great War. Early acting career During the early stages of WW1,she was often requested to perform at charity concerts and provided entertainment to wounded soldiers in the West Riding of Yorkshire. In February 1915, she appeared in a Leeds Grosvenor Amateur Dramatic Society‚Äôs comedy ‚ÄòBrother Officers‚Äô. According to a contemporary news report, Bacon's early performances also included comedic male impersonation routines. She became a professional actress later on in 1915. In February 1928, she starred in the musical play ‚ÄòLumber Love‚Äô at the Grand Theatre in Leeds. There she appeared alongside a number of well-known entertainers, actors and singers of the early twentieth century such as Jamieson Dodds, Joan Lockton, Dorie Sawyer, Fred Kitchen and Basil Howes' Plaza Tiller Girls. By 1933, she had become a well-known figure to theatre-goers throughout in Yorkshire as a whole and was known for her musical comedy roles. =Start of film career= In 1933, Bacon appeared as a London accented barmaid in the first film adaptation of J.B.Priestley's humorous novel 'The Good Companions' which featured famous actors such as John Gielgud. She stated herself in an interview that she went to a screening of the film in Blackpool and reported that 'Filmwork...is very interesting and fascinating and I hope to do more of it...but for preference please give me a happy laughing audience like this at Blackpool.' During the 1930s, she appeared in further musical comedy films such as The Public Life of Henry the Ninth (1935), the romantic comedy Second Best Bed (1939) and the Victorian set comedy Riding High (1939). World War 2 and E.N.S.A performances In 1939, she joined ENSA and for the duration of the war she performed as a comedian and singer entertaining armed forces personnel at home and overseas. In 1940, Bacon apparently regularly performed with the violinist Arthur Anton as part of her ENSA concert parties. She also performed with Baritone player Denis Darling and pianist Miss Dorothy James. In March 1940, she returned to London after spending 15 weeks entertaining British troops of the British Expeditionary Force in France. The tour which apparently kept going through the bitterly cold and notoriously bad winter of 1939/40 saw Bacon perform to soldiers in tents in freezing conditions. She claimed she had icicles on her dress during one ENSA concert party. A Yorkshire-based newspaper reported in April 1940 that Bacon had helped to trap two suspected spies whilst she was in France. Everything in the tour had gone as normal, until she arrived at a certain town where British troops were based. There, the military authorities warned her that there were two men in the town who they suspected were conducting espionage. In June 1945, the Lancashire Daily Post reported that she had completed her 2500th show since joining ENSA. This milestone was made while she was entertaining British troops in Germany in the weeks after VE-Day. Later film and television career The years following WW2 marked a slight change in direction in her film career. She began taking roles in a wider variety of film genres. In 1951, she appeared in the crime drama Pool of London (1950/51) which was set against the backdrop of shipping and the Port of London. She also had a role in the detective drama The Delavine Affair (1955) which starred Honor Blackman. She also had a part in the unusual science fiction comedy Child's Play (1954) in which children are able to split the atom. She also appeared in an episode of The Veil entitled Jack the Ripper which was part of an American 11 episode horror TV series hosted by Boris Karloff. She still appeared in comedy-drama films and had a significant role as Maggie, the wife of the protagonist in the football centred comedy drama Up For The Cup. In the 1960s and 1970s, she appeared mainly in single episodes of particular television series such as the British police drama No Hiding Place, the BBC hospital drama Angels, and Yorkshire Television's Hadleigh. Personal life In early 1916, she married Lionel Calvert, who was the only son of the James Calvert of Danehill, Sussex. He was an officer in the Royal Engineers. She was widowed shortly after marriage as Lionel was killed on the Western Front. Second- Lieutenant Lionel Calvert was killed at Vimy Ridge whilst assigned to a Tunnelling Company of the Royal Engineers. Bacon had been introduced to him by another serving officer, who later became a high-ranking officer in the RAF. In 1940, that particular officer, Air Vice Marshal Patrick Playfair escorted Bacon to the cemetery where her late husband Lionel Calvert was buried during winter 1939/40. After being left a widow by the Great War, she did remarry. She married fellow movie actor Morris Harvey, who predeceased her in 1944. Her marriage to Lionel Calvert did produce a son named James Lionel. He went on to attend Sedbergh School between 1931-4 and then joined the Royal Airforce. James had qualified as a pilot sometime before the outbreak of WW2. However, tragedy was to strike the family again on 20 September 1939, when he died of wounds after his Fairey Battle light bomber crashed while on a reconnaissance flight whilst serving with the RAF's 150 Squadron.

A roman √† clef, its protagonist, August (Gus) Bailey, is an alter ego of the author. Plot Living in New York, Gus Bailey, a writer for Park Avenue, a monthly magazine, takes a last look as an insider into the affairs of the rich and famous. As a popular guest at parties people talk to him, but with his writings he made enemies. Thus he is sued by former congressman Kyle Cramden for slander for falsely linking him to the murder of a female intern, he is facing the potential vengeance of Elias Renthal, a financier about to be released from prison, and he is being investigated by Perla Zacharias, the third richest woman in the world, who has been unhappy about Gus' interest in the circumstances of the death of her banker-husband in a mysterious fire at his penthouse. Gus interacts with members of New York high society, among them Lil Altemus who at the age of 76 starts working as a real estate agent to improve her financial situation, Ruby Renthal, Elias' wife who prepares for her husband's return into society, and Addison Kent, the kleptomane \\"walker\\" of Perla Zacharias, and attends the funeral of its Grand Old Dame, the 105-year-old Adele Harcourt. Gus's life is coming to an end, too; he learns that he has cancer. Perla is aware that Gus is about to write a novel based on her life and determined to stop it. She links up with his enemies, seems to employ Mossad agents, places a rumor that he is a pedophile, and pressures his publisher to back out of the project. Through philanthropic lavishness she is trying to \\"buy\\" herself into the high strata of society. Refuting the ugly rumor Gus \\"comes out\\" about his former bisexuality, and claims to have been celibate for two decades. He settles the lawsuit, amends with the Renthals, and finds a new backer for his book to proceed with his final project. Comments Dunne, known for writing \\"fact- based fiction\\" about high society and crime, delivered a book that may be more about him than about scandals. Gus' situation reflects on aspects of Dunne's life towards its end, his legal entanglement with Gary Condit, his terminal cancer, questions about his sexuality, his dealings with Vanity Fair, and his disdain for certain social climbers, notably Lily Safra, an aim of his parting shot even \\"beyond his grave\\". Some of the appeal of the book is trying to find out who is who in real life and separating fact from fiction. The book describes lives in the upper echelons of the New York society as well as the people who surround it, walkers, florists, cooks, and undertakers. Many of the characters had been described in People Like Us and having not emotionally grown, live in a world separated from main society, preoccupied with trivial gossip and fierce infighting about their standing and recognition. The final book has been found to have certain shortcomings; descriptions and characterizations are repetitive and sentences are loaded with information where items are bought and how much they cost, making for \\"clumsy\\" reading.

In 1963, the company moved to Honolulu and changed its name to King's Hawaiian. In 1977, the company expanded to the mainland United States by opening a bakery in Torrance, California. By the 1980s, Taira's company, King's Hawaiian Bakery, was grossing US$20 million annually. In 1988 the company moved its headquarters to the mainland. The Honolulu bakery closed in 1992. Taira died in May 2003 and left the company under the control of his family. In October 2003, King's Hawaiian moved its bakery to a 151,000-square foot facility in the Harbor Gateway neighborhood of Los Angeles (which has a Torrance postal address).

Suspicion rests on refined young married Peter, who has disappeared, and is known to have spent week-ends with the young woman in question, apparently with the full knowledge of his charming wife [Mary]. She, on hearing of the murder, does everything in her power to screen her spouse.

Origins The quasi-military Nigerian Marine Department was established in 1914 and cooperated with the Royal Navy in capturing Cameroon in the First World War. The Nigerian Navy came into official existence in 1956, staffed by 200 people from the Marine Department, with the tasks of mine-sweeping, ports examination and naval control services. The Nigerian Marine Training School, established in April 1952, provided basic training in seamanship to the Navy, Merchant Navy, Inland Waterways Department and Nigerian Ports Authority. The Nigerian National Shipping Line was established by the Nigerian government in 1959. Despite heavy investment and subsidies, the state-owned company was unable to compete with European lines. Much of the investment went to enriching the political elite. A 1964 book describes careers in the Nigerian Merchant Navy, which offered apprenticeships for craftsmen and Officer Cadetships for aspirants to become Navigating or Engineering officers. In 1988 the National Maritime Authority granted six Nigerian shipping lines \\"national carrier\\" status, including the state-owned Nigerian National Shipping Line, the Nigerian Green Line, Africa Ocean Line, Nigerbras Shipping Line, Brawal Line and the Nigerian South American Line. The NMA had plans to extend this status to more domestic companies so as to reduce control of trade by foreign-owned lines. However, by 1992 foreign shippers were carrying over 80% of cargo. The oil extraction companies ignored rules to use Nigerian ships and instead supplied their own tankers to transport most of the crude to their refineries abroad. The industry has been represented at international conferences by members of the Merchant Navy Officers' and Water Transport Senior Staff Association. Thomas Kemewerigha, the national President of this association, described it in a 2010 interview as a trade union organization affiliated with the Trade Union Congress (TUC) and with the International Transport Workers Federation (ITF). Status and activities Although the Nigerian Merchant Navy has a long history, it is not a legally recognized body. The Nigerian Maritime Administration and Safety Agency (NIMASA) undertook an investigation in 2007 after hearing that President Olusegun Obasanjo had authorized establishment of a Nigeria Merchant Navy Corps. In November 2007 the Director General of NIMASA said in a letter to Presidency that \\"the so-called Nigerian Merchant Navy is not known in the law establishing the NIMASA (NIMASA ACT 2007) nor the Nigerian Merchant Shipping Act 2007 that delegated the function of the Maritime Safety Administration to NIMASA\\". When the police announced a ban of an organization calling itself the \\"Nigerian Merchant Navy\\" in July 2010, due to alleged illegal activities of some members of that organization, Kemewerigha said the ban did not apply to his Nigerian Merchant Navy Officers and Water Transport Senior Staff Association, which was recognized in the Federal Gazette. He said \\"We have written a lot of letters as far back as 2006, when we discovered a mystery Merchant Navy body. We wrote to the Police, Navy, SSS and every other agency but nothing was done\\". Kemewerigha describes the Merchant Navy job as being \\"in water transportation, cargo vessels, tankers, creek operations, inland water ways, offshore, service vessels, harbour handling, FPSO's\\". He talked against the use of uniforms on land, which his organization did not allow. He said that cadets wore the uniform, which is the same as the Navy uniform apart from the badge, so they could get free transport. The Merchant Navy suffers from lawlessness in the territorial waters. In July 2010, Comrade Kingsley Enahoro issued a statement reading in part: \\"The Executive and entire members of the fishing zone of the Nigeria Merchant Navy want to bring to the notice of the Federal/State Government as well as the International community and the General Public of the threat and killing suffered by sailors as a result of the insurgence of sea pirates in the Nigeria/Cameroon waters\\". Kemewerigha has been highly critical of NIMASA, which is meant to protect merchant vessels, saying that despite all the money received by NIMASA they were unable to maintain one helicopter in flight-worthy condition. In May 2011 the Nigerian Senate was considering a bill for an Act to Provide for the Establishment of the Nigerian Merchant Navy Security and Safety Corps. Unauthorized organizations In November 2009 the Nigerian Tribune published a report titled \\"Navy uncovers plot to destabilise Nigeria\\" that said the Nigerian Naval Command had reported discovery of plans by a group headed by Commodore Benson Edema to destabilise the country. The Navy was quoted as saying that the group had allegedly recruited youths and trained them in use of arms, dressing them in naval uniforms. This appears to have related to an earlier incident in December 2007 where \\"Commodore\\" Benson Edema was transferred to the custody of Nigerian Navy after being arrested for allegedly assaulting men of the Lagos State Transport Management Authority. Edema claimed he had recruited 10,000 men to his \\"Nigerian Merchant Navy Corps\\" with the job of policing the nation‚Äôs waterways. Edema, who was never a Navy Commodore but had been a welder with Nigerian National Shipping Line (NNSL) from 1994 to 1996, was arrested for alleged impersonation. Responding to the Tribune report, the Director-General of the self-styled Nigerian Merchant Navy, Commodore Allen Edema, called for President Umaru Yar'Adua to investigate the Nigerian Navy, implying it might be involved in import of illegal arms, contraband and hard drugs. Edema describing the Tribune report as a \\"baseless tissues of lies meant to mislead the public, incite public hatred and misgiving against the Nigeria Merchant navy who go about their legitimate business within the law\\". Edema went on to claim the Navy was involved in various illegal activities. He also accused the Nigerian Maritime Administration and Safety Agency of accepting pay-offs from foreign-owned ships who should have been employing Nigerian seamen. He agreed that the NMA had been engaged in training, but said the training was in seafaring and basic maritime safety and security. In August 2010 \\"Commodore\\" Aderemi Olatinwo, Director-General of the Nigerian Merchant Navy, called for formal recognition of an autonomous Merchant Navy to undertake coast guard duties. According to Olatinwo, Nigeria has the most porous coast in the world, with stolen crude oil being smuggled out and arms and other contraband smuggled in. In a May 2011 interview the head of the NMN Lagos command, Captain Ichukwu Agaba, said the NMN originated with the colonial Marine Department, which had the function of ensuring safety on the waterways, stopping piracy and preventing foreign invasion. He noted there were \\"strong arm politics in play to outlaw the merchant navy\\", and said the NMN had been fighting their ejection from their Lagos premises since 2009. Agaba said NMN crew are trained to combat crimes at land and sea. Asked of the difference in roles between the NMN and the Navy, Agaba evaded the question but stressed the NMN's security roles. Unlicensed academies In June 2009 two men were arrested by the Navy and handed over to police for running an illegal Merchant Navy Academy on a merchant vessel, MT James, in Lagos. The operators of the Lagos Aviation and Maritime Business School (LAMBS) were offering training to a group of young men on how to navigate a vessel, as well as military training, so they could qualify as Merchant Navy personnel. Some of the students had started to wear Merchant Navy uniforms while on shore. According to a naval spokesman only the Nigerian Maritime Academy at Oron, Akwa Ibom, and the Institute of Oceanography and Marine Research on Victoria Island, Lagos were licensed to train merchant navy personnel. Another Merchant Navy Maritime Academy was established in 2008 in Iperu in Ogun State. It was registered with the Corporate Affairs Commission as a private commercial venture under the Company and Allied Matters Acts (CAMA). For effective practical training for cadets of the institution another company was registered with Corporate Affairs Commission to absorb most of the cadets, the Merchants Navy Shipping Line Limited. In an April 2010 interview Captain Bola Nuga, Commandant of the Merchant Navy Academy, said there was an acute shortage of marine engineers and nautical engineers. The Maritime Academy in Oron and the College of Science in Victoria Island, Lagos were unable to meet the demand for qualified merchant navy staff, and the universities were not offering the courses needed. The academy was founded to help fill the gap, of vital importance to the economy. In December 2010 the Commandant-General of the NMN, Commodore Aderemi Latinwo, said the academy was moving from Iperu to Iwopin in the Ogun Waterside Local Government Area of Ogun State. The academy head, Bola Nuga, praised the ruler of Iwopin, Oba Julius Adekoya and former President Olusegun Obasanjo for helping the academy to acquire the defunct Iwopin Paper Mill as its new operational base. In January 2011 Aderemi Latinwo and three other senior officers of the NMN were arrested by the police, who alleging that they were running a fake maritime academy. Rear Admiral Emmanuel Ogbor accused Latinwo of presenting himself as a Commodore. He stated that Latinwo had never been in the Nigerian Navy. He also said the school was not registered with the Corporate Affairs Commission or approved by the Ministry of Transport, so had no legal right to operate. Sunday Adelani, the NMN Director of Communication, described the arrests as a calculated attempt to sabotage the academy and the maritime industry in Nigeria. He stated that the Merchant Navy Maritime Academy was a legal and duly registered institute, recognized by the National Assembly. Adelani said the Minister for Interior, Captain Emmanuel Ihenacho \\"is a captain from Nigerian Merchant Navy formation, and he was the class mate of Commodore Olatinwo in the academy. So it is wrong to say Nigerian Merchant Navy is fake\\". Adelani said \\"For anybody or group of persons to tarnish the image of a noble institution like the Merchant Navy, especially in view of its strategic importance to the Nations economy is callous and wicked\\". He said the Nigerian Navy should cease its persecution of the Nigerian Merchant Navy and instead view it as a sister organization with complementary goals.

Postal index ‚Äî 453194, Russian Classification on Objects of Administrative Division code - 80248845009. Previous name of the village is Tyaterbashevo. History The population migrated from Chuvashia in about 17th century and originally settled in Artukhovsky volost of Belebeevsky county of Orenburg province (now it is Sterlibashevsky rajon of the Republic of Bashkortostan), it is about 3-4 kilometers from village Smorodinovka, in the lands of a landowner from Saint Petersburg, not so far from a not existing currently village Baranovka. The Orenburg province in 1865 was divided into two provinces: Ufa and Oregburg. The village Tyater‚Äôbash (the name used to be written with soft sign) became a part of the Ufa province Sterlitamak county Artukhovsky volost. =Location history= Fire There was a fire and the whole village burned away. The inhabitants had no wish to construct the new houses at the place of hearth and home, and decided to migrate to another place. The version is supported by some part of inhabitants of today's Tyaterbash, which insist that that year the summer was really hot. The majority of the village was on haymaking and couldn‚Äôt take part in fighting a fire. When they‚Äôve returned from haymaking there were only dying embers instead of their houses. And, insofar as according to ancient Chuvash belief it is not good to build houses at the place of fire, so, people decided to move to a new place. Today, there is no documentary proof of the version. Nevertheless, it is the version of the migration of the village to the current location that was told by great- grandfather and great grandmamma of village inhabitant Mr. A.G. Petrov.

He was a key factor in the program's success and in their units being assigned to combat duty. Parrish was born and raised in the south-east United States; he joined the U.S. Army in 1930. He served in the military from 1930 until 1964, and retired as a brigadier general in 1964. Parrish's association with the Tuskegee Airmen began when he was assigned to be the Assistant Director of Training of the Eastern Flying Training Command. On December 5, 1941, Parrish was promoted to the position of Director of Training at Tuskegee Army Flying School in Alabama. One year later in December 1942 Parrish became the Tuskegee Army Air Field commander. The prestigious \\"Brigadier General Noel F. Parrish Award\\" was so named due to Parrish's efforts to desegregate his troops, reduce overcrowding, increase morale, and improve relations between Tuskegee's residents and the inhabitants of the base. Tuskegee's highest award has been named the \\"Brigadier General Noel F. Parrish Award\\" in honor of its titular namesake. Early life and career Born in Versailles, Kentucky, to a Southern white minister, Parrish spent parts of his youth living in Alabama and Georgia. His birthplace is often listed as being in nearby Lexington, Kentucky. He graduated from Cullman High School, Cullman, Alabama in 1924 and Rice Institute, Houston, Texas in 1928. He dropped out of graduate school after one year and decided to hitchhike to San Francisco. The lack of work meant hunger, so he chose to join the United States Army's 11th Cavalry Regiment as a private on July 30, 1930, serving in Monterey, California. After a year in the horse cavalry, Parrish became an aviation cadet in June 1931 and subsequently qualified as an enlisted pilot. He completed flight training in 1932 and was assigned to the 13th Attack Squadron at Fort Crockett, near Galveston, Texas. One year later in September 1933 Parrish joined the Air Corps Technical School at Chanute Field, Illinois; later transferring to the First Air Transport Squadron at Dayton, Ohio. In July 1935 he rejoined the 13th Attack Squadron as assistant operations officer, then located at Barksdale Field, Louisiana. Parrish became a flying instructor at Randolph Field in April 1938, and by July 1939 he was a supervisor at the Air Corps Flying School in Glenview, Illinois. Commissioned as a lieutenant in 1939, Parrish attended the Air Command and Staff School at Maxwell Field, Alabama. As a captain, and still a student at Maxwell, his association with the Tuskegee Airmen began as in March 1941 when he was assigned as Assistant Director of Training of the Eastern Flying Training Command. Upon graduation in June 1941, he chose to remain at Maxwell, and work with the Tuskegee Institute as a primary flight instructor. By doing so, he gave up his own desires for a combat command. On December 5, 1941, two days before the attack on Pearl Harbor, he was promoted to Director of Training at Tuskegee Army Flying School in Alabama, assuming command of Tuskegee Army Air Field a year later, in December 1942. Tuskegee Airmen Experiment =Formation of the Tuskegee Airmen Experiment= Black Americans were not permitted to fly for the U.S. armed services prior to 1940. The Air Corps at that time, which had never had a single black member, was part of an army that possessed exactly two black Regular line officers at the beginning of World War II: Brigadier Generals Benjamin O. Davis, Sr. and Benjamin O. Davis, Jr. The first Civilian Pilot Training Program (CPTP) students completed their instruction in May 1940. Eleanor Roosevelt and Charles \\"Chief\\" Anderson on April 19, 1941. The creation of an all-black pursuit squadron resulted from pressure by civil rights organizations and the black press who pushed for the establishment of a unit at Tuskegee, an Alabama base, in 1941. The Tuskegee Institute was selected by the military for the \\"Tuskegee (Airmen) Experiment\\" because of its commitment to aeronautical training. Tuskegee had the facilities, engineering and technical instructors, as well as a climate for year-round flying. Eleanor Roosevelt, who was interested in the Tuskegee aviation program, took a 40-minute flight around the base in a plane piloted by Charles \\"Chief\\" Anderson on April 19, 1941. Anderson was a self-taught black civilian and experienced aviator who learned how to fly before the war. He was hired by the Tuskegee program to be its Chief Flight Instructor. Anderson has been referred to as the 'Ancient Mariner' of black aviation, having flown long before many of the new recruits were of age. The Tuskegee program was then expanded and became the center for African-American aviation during World War II. Members of the Tuskegee unit became known as the Tuskegee Airmen. Formation of the black air units was announced by Under Secretary of War Robert P. Patterson on January 16, 1941. On March 19, 1941, the 99th Pursuit Squadron (Pursuit being an early World War II synonym for \\"Fighter\\") was established at Chanute Field in Rantoul, Illinois and activated three days later on March 22. Over 250 enlisted men formed the first group of black Americans trained at Chanute in aircraft ground support trades. This small number became the core of other black squadrons subsequently formed at Tuskegee and Maxwell Fields in Alabama. Later in 1941, the 99th Pursuit Squadron moved to Maxwell Field and then Tuskegee Field before deploying to combat in the Mediterranean Theater of Operations in 1943. Pilots, commanders, instructors, and maintenance and support staff comprised the \\"Tuskegee (Airmen) Experiment\\". In December 1941, Noel F Parrish became the Director of Training at the school. By the end of 1942 Parrish had been promoted to the position of Tuskegee Army Air Field Commander. As Director of Training and later Tuskegee Field commander, Parrish played a key role in the program's success. There were approximately 14,000 ground support personnel at Tuskegee Field during WW II and almost 1,000 graduating pilots, of which about 450 saw active combat during the war. Exercises at a Booker T. Washington monument located at the Tuskegee Institute commemorated the beginning of black American pre-flight training for military aviation. The first twelve candidates for officer-flier positions were cited by America's black press as \\"the cream of the country's colored youth\\". The first classes started at the institute, and flying lessons soon began at the Tuskegee Army Air Field (TAAF) some approximately ten miles away. After it was built, government press releases recounted that the air field was developed and built by Negro contractors both skilled and unskilled. Of the original class, five students graduated in March 1942. The PTI3A Stearman was the first type of training plane to be used in teaching the new recruits. The AT6 Texan, and P-40 Warhawk followed as the aircraft of choice over time. Much of the primary flight training was done at Moton Field at Tuskegee. Tuskegee trained over 1,000 black aviators during the war, about half of whom served overseas. =Initial problems= Noel Parrish (R) with Lena Horne and Tuskegee Airmen Local white residents of the area objected almost immediately. They complained about black MPs challenging white people and patrolling the town while brandishing their military weapons. The first commanding officer, Major James Ellison, was supportive of his MPs; however, he was soon relieved of his command. A segregationist colonel replaced Ellison, and enforced segregation both on and off the base. This prompted black newspapers to protest his assignment. The colonel was transferred with a promotion, and Noel Parrish then took command as 'director of training'. The lack of assignments according to background and training led to an excess of non-aviation black officers without a mission. This became disparaging to morale, as the facility became overcrowded. As there was little in the line of recreation, Parrish began to arrange for celebrities to visit and perform at the base. Lena Horne, Joe Louis, Ella Fitzgerald, Ray Robinson, Louis Armstrong, and Langston Hughes were among the many guests. Parrish also desegregated the base to a much larger extent than his predecessors. Parrish demanded high standards of performance of his men and did not view race as an issue. Parrish felt that what mattered was professionalism and an individual's capacities, techniques, and judgement. Parrish held his black trainees to the same high standards of performance as whites; and those who did not meet those standards were failed out of the program. =Tuskegee Airmen Experiment results= Benjamin O. Davis, Sr. (L), Noel F. Parrish (C), and Benjamin O. Davis, Jr. (R) at Tuskegee during World War II. History views the results of the \\"Tuskegee Airmen Experiment\\" as a tremendous success, in which Parrish played a significant role, and proved that blacks could perform well in both leadership and combat roles. Parrish felt people should be judged by their capability, not their color. During its development Parrish would often return from Washington DC depressed because of the massive resistance to the Tuskegee program. Decades later at Tuskegee Airmen reunions, when Parrish's name was called everyone applauded with a standing ovation. The experience of the AAF during World War II necessitated that the military review its policies on the utilization of black servicemembers. Confrontation, discussion, and coordination with both black and white groups led AAF leaders to the conclusion that active commitment, leadership, and equal opportunity produced a more cost-effective, viable military force. In 1948, President Harry Truman signed an Executive Order on equality of treatment and opportunity in the military, due in no small part to the successes of the Tuskegee Airmen. Parrish was commander of Tuskegee Field from 1942 to 1946 and historians generally give him credit for improving morale, living conditions, relations between blacks and whites, and relations with local citizens. Parrish, stated in his memoirs that he often mediated between the Army officials, whites near Tuskegee who felt that the airmen were uppity, and the aviation trainees themselves. Dr. Frederick D. Patterson, the third president of Tuskegee Institute, wrote to Parrish on September 14, 1944: \\"In my opinion, all who have had anything to do with the development and direction of the Tuskegee Army Air Field and the Army flying training program for Negroes in this area have just cause to be proud.... The development had to take place in a period of emergency and interracial confusion.\\" After Tuskegee Parrish stayed in command of the Tuskegee Airmen through the end of World War II in 1945 until August 20, 1946 when he was assigned to the Air University at Maxwell. During this time the war was winding down and the struggle to integrate the United States military heated up. Virtually all commanders submitted reports claiming that blacks took longer to train and performed more poorly than whites. Parrish was one of the few who did not do so. Parrish pointed out instances that showed blatant discrimination occurred against black airmen during the war, such as when there was a shortage of bomber pilots in Europe, white fighter pilots were sent to replace them despite the fact that fully trained black bomber pilots were available, even though flying fighter planes requires skills quite different from flying a bomber. Parrish also commented: \\"It is a discouraging fact that officers of the Army Air Force, whose scientific achievements are unsurpassed, and whose scientific skill is unquestioned in mechanical matters and in many personnel matters, should generally approach the problem of races and minorities with the most unscientific dogmatic and arbitrary attitudes.... Whether we like or dislike Negroes ... they are citizens of the United States having the same rights and privileges of other citizens....\\" In August 1947 he entered the Air War College at Maxwell Field and graduated the following June. He then became deputy secretary of the Air Staff at Air Force Headquarters, Washington, D.C. and became a special assistant to the vice chief of staff there in January 1951. In September 1954 he became Air Deputy to the North Atlantic Treaty Organization Defense College, which was then located in Paris, France. On September 1, 1956, he became deputy director, Military Assistance Division, United States European Command, also in Paris. In May 1958 he returned to Air Force headquarters and became assistant for coordination to deputy chief of staff for Plans and Programs. He eventually became a Brigadier General‚Äîretiring from the Air Force on October 1, 1964. His military decorations include the Legion of Merit and Air Medal. He earned a PhD from his alma mater, Rice University, and taught college history in Texas. Parrish died on Tuesday, April 7, 1987 of cardiac arrest at the Veterans Administration Medical Center in Piney Point, Maryland. At the service Lieutenant General Davis Jr. said \\"He may have been the only white person who believed that blacks could learn to fly airplanes.\\" Family and personal life Parrish was married twice, the second time to Dr. Florence Tucker Parrish-St.John, and had three stepsons Joseph Tucker, III of Dallas, Texas, F. Steven Tucker of Bel Air, Maryland, and James D. Tucker of Douglasville, Pennsylvania. He wrote magazine articles under a pen name and was interested in music and painting. Parrish was considered charming, witty, and likable. Looking younger than his years, he was also considered to be a ladies' man. Prior to being assigned to Tuskegee, he had not been actively involved with any of the black Americans' causes. Parrish had as a youth, however, hiked three miles to see where a black man had been lynched. He later recalled that when people heard of the project to train black pilots and mechanics, he often heard \\"weird and worried kind of laughter\\" from white people and that a visiting British flying ace once stated that it was better to have a \\"Messerschmitt on his tail than to try to teach a Negro to fly\\". Legacy According to a 2001 presentation that won top prize at a National History Day competition, an 18-year-old Topeka High School student John Freeman wrote that the Tuskegee Airmen, America's first black military pilots, helped lay the groundwork for the civil rights movement. The most prestigious award of the association of Tuskegee Airmen, which is presented at the Tuskegee Airmen, Inc. annual convention, was named 'the Brigadier General Noel F. Parrish Award' in his honor. For many years the award was presented in person by his widow, Florence. In recognition Mrs. Parrish received the General Daniel James Jr. Distinguished Service/Achievement/Leadership Award at the 2010 convention. Historians generally give credit to Colonel Noel Parrish, Commander of Tuskegee Field from 1942 to 1946, for his enlightened leadership and fair treatment of cadets which improved morale by reducing the amount of segregation and overcrowding and improving relations with both blacks and whites in the town of Tuskegee. The record of the Airmen became a driving force for President Harry S Truman's decision to desegregate the U.S. military in 1948.

He is also referred to as \\"Mac Daddy\\" and is a member of the Louisiana Music Hall of Fame. Martinez began singing in public at the age of eight in his home church in Carencro, Louisiana. He began his professional music career after graduating from Teurlings Catholic High School in Lafayette, Louisiana in 1974 by performing in the local nightlife scene of South Louisiana. Career From 1981 through 1984 Martinez was frontman and bandleader of Gregg Martinez and Kingfish. In 1985 he began to tour nationally with a new backing group called the Heat. Within a few months he landed an exclusive contract with the Donald Trump casinos in Atlantic City, NJ, where he would appear regularly through 1988 and relocated to in 1986. He signed a recording contract with multi-platinum songwriter/producer/musicians Victor Carstarphen and Keith Benson - veterans of the Philadelphia, PA recording scene which included Teddy Pendergrass, The O'Jays, and Patti Labelle. His recordings were not released. Martinez relocated briefly to Nashville in early 1989 but by the end of the year had moved to north TX near Wichita Falls. In 1990 Martinez began a new chapter in his musical journey in the Contemporary Christian Music field. He released three Christian albums from 1991-1997. With the releases of For the Ages and All the Days, 1999, 2001, he began to blend the Christian music with the Rhythm and Blues of his earlier days. He formed Gregg Martinez Outreach in 1998 which most notably consisted of a public school anti-drug program which reached many thousands of students around the country. By 2006 Martinez had relocated back to his native Louisiana and had also returned to the R&B;/Blues/Swamp Pop genre with the release of Big Bad Daddy. At this time he also joined the legendary blue-eyed soul group the Boogie Kings. He wrote the title song for The Boogie Kings' 2007 release Never Go Away. Martinez'CD, Soul of the Bayou, was released April 30, 2016 on Louisiana Red Hot Records. It reached #2 on the national soul chart and #4 on the national R&B; chart according to RootsMusicReport.com.

Though his life remains somewhat of a mystery, his works are still consulted by academic and popular history writers today.For example, The Antient and Present State of Muscovy was used by Lindsey Hughes for his Sophia, Regent of Russia: 1657-1704 (New Haven: Yale University Press, 1990. ) and by Robert K. Massie for his Pulitzer Prize winning biography Peter the Great: His Life and World (New York: Ballantine Books, 1981. ) Early life and education Crull was born in Hamburg, then a free state of the Germanic Confederation, of a family part of that city's patriciate.Schroeder's Lexikon der Hamburgischen Schriftsteller,i.,608 He applied himself to medicine at Holland's Leiden University. The M.D. was attained in 1679 with Crull's inaugural essay: Disputatio medice-chymica exhibens medicamenti veterum universalis, recentiorumque paticularium verum in medicina usum, etc.Praes. Theodorus Craanen. Apud Viduam & Heredes Johannis Elzevirii: Lugduni Batavorum; British Museum 1185.g.15.(26) Life in England Subsequently, Crull settled in England although he may have been a public school student there before he matriculated at Leiden. He was created M.D. of Cambridge by royal mandatea decree from Charles II; \\"by royal mandate\\" (royal decree) - issued by His Majesty, and one that had to be consistent with the dignity of the Crown otherwise the mandate would not be worthy of the paper on which it was written -evincing that Crull was no ordinary fellow on 7 August 1681;Munk's College of Physicians (1878),i. 497 elected a fellow of the Royal Society on 23 November 1681 and admitted on 30 November;See List of Fellows of the Royal Society A,B,C, and later admitted a licentiate of the Royal College of Physicians on 22 December 1692.Lists of the College of Physicians in the British Museum Crull's life remains rather ambiguous for some accounts speculate that he subsisted mainly by doing translations and compilations for booksellers while seeming to have met with little success in his profession since there are a number of omissions of his name on the annual list of the Fellows of the Royal Society which, according to the author (Gordon Goodwin) of the Crull entry in the 1917 D.N.B., suggest an inability to pay. Other accounts imply the likelihood that Crull may have been a dilettante and eccentric who had the means to follow his interests and who may not have paid his fees to the Royal Society with regularity since he may not have attached a great significance to being listed yearly. Where he practised medicine could have been in London or its environs for he settled in London but resided outside of the city because of \\"country\\" being appended to his name on the lists. The fact that Crull could entreat Sir Hans Sloane's vote at the coming election of a navy physician Sloane MSS (No.4041),p.288 or interact with Sir Isaac Newton and other luminaries of his age shows that he was comfortable with himself; and that the latter view of him runs counter to Goodwin's portrayal of him in the D.N.B., an entry which also neglects to mention that Crull Though Crull is often perceived as a German surname, it was originally Norman. A common name among England's and Ireland's Norman nobility, it gradually evolved into other variations such as Kryle or disappeared altogether as in the case of the barons and earls of Ashburnham. By the time Crull enrolled at the University of Cambridge his surname had all but disappeared with only a few still carrying it in England and Anglo Ireland, including John Crull, a student at Dublin's Trinity College whose father was an armiger (esquire) - source: George Dames Burtchaell, M.A., K.C., M.R.I.A. Alumni Dublinenses London: Williams and Norgate, 1924, p. 199 and Appendix B. The Crull name flourished as a Dutch patrician name and one of well-connected High German burghers and members of the Northern German lower nobility; and died out as a Reichsadel and Russian noble name received the M.D. from King's College in the University of Cambridge in 1681. Crull's degree was awarded Lit. Reg., i.e. by \\"royal decree.\\" Given that Crull was at King's prompts queries: Why King's? How did he meet the Eton College requisite? Why did he come to England in the first place? Had he been there before Leiden? etc. Works Crull's works were published either anonymously or with his initials only.

It features the life and work of Ralph Zavadil whose Cap'n Video series on a community cable channel consisted of outlandish stunts which resembled those seen in the later Jackass series. Zavadil also discusses aspects of his personal life, such as working at the local GM plant, and his family which were affected by his drinking problem. Scenes Zavadil began his Cap'n Video series on St. Catharines, Ontario cable channel 10 in 1990. One such incident involved an attempt at an \\"instant razor\\" where Zavadil applied combustible liquid on his face then set it on fire. The film begins with a clip of Zavadil's most notorious stunt in which he attempted to dive into a covered swimming pool from a ladder. The ladder was unstable and his jump resulted in a head-first landing on the concrete deck. Zavadil then fell into the tarp of the pool, and nearly drowned as it sank until a neighbor came by and saved him. Zavadil fractured his neck as a result requiring a six-month recovery. The news of the failed stunt received attention from various international television shows. Cap'n Video was cancelled in 1995 following a controversial Easter-themed episode in which Zavadil licked off chocolate sauce that was applied to a dog. The episode also featured a rabbit hung from a bungee cord. These scenes prompted criticism from viewers and the local Humane Society. The documentary includes interview footage with Zavadil and excerpts from his Cap'n Video series. Other interview subjects include his mother (Barbara Zavadil) and his former girlfriend (Nancy Dewar). The film's title is based on Zavadil's recurring use of the phrase, \\"It's going to be a beauty day\\".

Early life  Eileen Dennes, born Eileen Amhurst Cowen was an Irish silent film actress who was born in 1898 in Dublin, Ireland. She began on the stage in the early 1910s. She travelled to America in 1917. She found work at the Empire Al Star Film Co. and was offered the role of Ethel Fielding in her first film ‚ÄòThe Unforseen‚Äô. She made more than one film in Hollywood that year with Olive Tell. She then decided to find work in England, it was there that Cecile Hepworth offered her a contract and she made her first English film as Rhoda Meredith in ‚ÄôSheba‚Äô starring Alma Taylor in 1919. After this Dennes was given the chance at starring roles in films such as ‚ÄôOnce Abroad the Lugger‚Äô in 1920, ‚ÄòMr. Justice Raffles‚Äô in 1921 and ‚ÄòThe Pipes of Pan‚Äô in 1923 9again with Alma Taylor. Dennes‚Äô last film appearance was as Lucy in ‚ÄòThe Squire of Long Hadley‚Äô with Brian Ahearn for the Stoll Film Co. in 1925.  Career  While Irish male actors made such a big impression on the silent-film industry in Hollywood, a couple of Irish women stand out. A Dublin actress, Dennes, born in 1898, had a much shorter career. Dennes arrived in Hollywood in 1917 and found work at the Empire All-Star Film Co and was offered the role as Ethel Fielding in her debut film 'The Unforeseen' with Olive Tell she made one more film in Hollywood that same year and decided to find film work in England, Cecil Hepworth offered her a contract and she made her first British film as Rhoda Meredith in 'Sheba' starring Alma Taylor and Gerald Ames in 1919 afterwards Hepworth gave her the chance in starring roles, such as in 'Once Aboard the Lugger' in 1920, 'Mr. Justice Raffles' in 1921 and 'The Pipes of Pan' again with Alma Taylor in 1923. The final film that she worked on with Cecil Hepworth was \\"Comin Thro The Rye\\", in 1923. After this film she never worked with Hepworth again and the next director that she worked with was Fred LeRoy Granville on his film \\"The Sins Ye Do\\", in 1924. Dennes last film appearance was as Lucy in 'The Squire of Long Hadley' with Brian Aherne for the Stoll Film Co in 1925. Between 1919 and 1925, she appeared in a dozen silent films, then her movie career petered out. In retrospect, it's amazing how many Irish actors contributed to the silent-movie era in Hollywood, which flourished for a mere 15 years.

He was most noted for his time as Brigadier of the North Belfast Ulster Defence Association (UDA). After falling from grace, Simpson spent a number of years outside Northern Ireland. He returned to Belfast in 2014 in a move related to an ongoing loyalist feud. Early years Simpson, a native of the Tiger's Bay area of north Belfast, joined the UDA in the early 1970s, claiming later that he did so as he felt that \\"there was no one to defend our streets from republicans in the New Lodge [a neighbouring Catholic district]\\".Henry McDonald & Jim Cusack, UDA ‚Äì Inside the Heart of Loyalist Terror Penguin Ireland, 2004, p. 346 He would go on to assume command of the North Belfast brigade, making him one of the six Inner Council members that led the UDA. He had taken over from Brigadier Tom Reid, who in his turn had succeeded Davy Payne following the latter's arrest in 1988. Brigadier Simpson was, along with Jackie McDonald, John Gregg and Billy McFarland, one of the brigadiers on stage during Johnny Adair's \\"Loyalist Day of Culture\\" on the Lower Shankill on 19 August 2000. In a move that Simpson and the other brigadiers were unaware of, Adair used the day as the starting point for a bloody loyalist feud with the Ulster Volunteer Force (UVF).McDonald & Cusack, UDA, p. 327 For his part Simpson was reluctant to join the fight against the UVF but many within his brigade admired Adair and some became openly involved in the feud, not least David Greer, who had been involved in the Loyalist Day of Culture when Adair's men attacked the UVF stronghold, the Rex Bar. Greer was killed by the North Belfast UVF on Mountcollyer Street on 28 October whilst two days later the Tiger's Bay UDA retaliated by killing Herbert Rice, a 63-year-old Progressive Unionist Party (PUP) activist who had been in the UVF in the late 1960s.McDonald & Cusack, UDA, p. 334 Tommy English, an Ulster Democratic Party (UDP) spokesman and veteran street-fighter, was killed by the UVF that same night in Newtownabbey, and before long John Gregg's UDA South East Antrim Brigade joined the growing feud.McDonald & Cusack, UDA, p. 335 By the early years of the 21st century, Simpson's control in north Belfast had become nominal as the brigade had witnessed an influx of young members who were attracted by Adair's militancy. They were loyal to the West Belfast brigadier rather than Simpson.Wood, Ian S., Crimes of Loyalty: A History of the UDA, Edinburgh University Press, 2006, p. 278 One of the activities he was able to organise was a pipe bomb campaign, combined with large-scale rioting, along the boundaries between Tiger's Bay and the New Lodge throughout 2000 and 2001. Simpson believed that Catholics were attempting to encroach on Protestant territory, largely due to the overcrowding on the New Lodge and the presence of many empty houses in Tiger's Bay. Sinn F√©in's North Belfast spokesman, Gerry Kelly, had called on the Northern Ireland Housing Executive to move the peace lines to build new housing for Catholics, a statement Simpson regarded as provocative.McDonald & Cusack, UDA, p. 345 One of his last acts as brigadier was part of the Holy Cross dispute in which loyalists began to picket a Catholic primary school in Ardoyne. Several residents of Glenbryn who had been involved in the protests filed suits against the Royal Ulster Constabulary (RUC), alleging heavy-handed treatment. In response to the claims, Simpson issued a statement claiming that if this treatment continued then the police and their families would be targeted by the North Belfast UDA. A subsequent statement claimed that the targeting would take the form of protests outside their houses rather than paramilitary attacks, although it also underlined that the policemen's families in particular would be made to \\"pay the price\\".McDonald & Cusack, UDA, p. 359 Removal Simpson, who had long borne the nickname \\"The Bacardi Brigadier\\" because of his voracious appetite for alcohol, was described as a \\"sad shambling figure\\" by the Belfast News Letter.OPINION: The question now is what will happen to the gang? His drunken rages had also become more frequent, and in one incident he even had to be forcibly ejected from the Mount Inn after he threw a set of pool balls around the bar, damaging a toilet door. His violent mood swings became a feature of life in his Tiger's Bay stronghold, where intimidation and petty violence became rife, whilst he also co-ordinated a network of protection rackets and supported his wife \\"Tootsie\\" in her large- scale fencing operation. Simpson was finally deposed by the pro-Adair wing in mid-2002 and, following a personal recommendation from a freshly released from prison Adair, the Inner Council endorsed Andre Shoukri as his successor.Wood, Crimes of Loyalty, p. 280 Shoukri's physical takeover proved surprisingly easy: with guns borrowed from Adair he and his followers stood Simpson down without firing a shot, Simpson being apparently relieved to be leaving the position.David Lister & Hugh Jordan, Mad Dog: The Rise and Fall of Johnny Adair and 'C' Company, Mainstream, 2004, p. 310 Andre Shoukri and his brother Ihab both had brief spells as brigadier before being imprisoned leading to the appointment of William \\"Bonzer\\" Borland, a former footballer with Linfield, to the role in 2003. Sensing that Borland, who had little background in the UDA, was a weak replacement, Simpson began to openly criticise his lack of experience and made a play to regain command for himself. On 13 October 2003 around forty of Simpson's closest allies in the UDA went on the rampage in the Ballysillan and Glenbryn estates attacking houses and shops owned by Borland supporters before attempting, unsuccessfully, to kidnap the new brigadier. The attempted coup was not a success and several of Simpson's men found themselves the victims of punishment shootings soon afterwards.Wood, Crimes of Loyalty, p. 304 According to David McKittrick Simpson's attempted coup had also been inspired by his reluctance to hand over part of the proceeds of a ¬£5000 robbery in which he had been involved to the new North Belfast leadership.Paramilitaries feud over sex and money as Adair leaves behind a power vacuum South Belfast brigadier Jackie McDonald, who had emerged as the UDA's leading figure after forcing Adair out of Northern Ireland earlier in the year, stepped in as he felt that the image presented by Simpson in his final years as brigadier was one that was too damaging to the UDA to be allowed to resume. He led the Inner Council in condemning the actions of Simpson and in ordering him to leave Belfast and not return.Wood, Crimes of Loyalty, pp. 304‚Äì305 A subsequent letter from Simpson's supporters to the North Belfast leadership warned that they would be back to regain control.LVF drugs ring \`smashed'; UDA feud lingers on Simpson himself was reported as having fled to England with the proceeds of the robbery.Nothing or nobody is certain any more In 2014, it was reported in the Belfast Telegraph that Simpson had returned to Northern Ireland and was living under the protection of the UDA West Belfast Brigade. The Brigade, which was involved in machinations against the leadership of John Bunting in North Belfast, were reported to be considering attempting to return Simpson to power. Simpson died of lung cancer on 11 October 2018 at his home in Shankhill Road, west Belfast, at the age of 60. He was buried at Carnmoney Cemetery in County Antrim.

It is found in eastern North America. Taxonomy First described in 1895 as Omphalina semivestipes by Charles Horton Peck, the species was transferred to Mycena in 1947 by Alexander H. Smith. The type collection was made in Newfoundland, Canada. Description The cap is initially convex to somewhat conical before flattening out in age; it attains a diameter of wide. The cap surface, smooth and slightly lubricous, is deep viscous to dark brown in the center. The margin is somewhat translucent, so that the grooves made by the gills are discernible. The thin flesh has a firm texture similar to cartilage, a distinct strong nitrous odor, and a mild to somewhat bitter taste. The gills have an adnate attachment, but often recede from the stipe as the mushroom matures. Their color is white to dirty pink. They can develop reddish-brown spots in age. Interspersed between the gills are two or three tiers of lamellae (short gills). The stipe measures long by thick, and is roughly the same thickness throughout its length. Its surface texture is smooth or lightly pruinose (as if dusted with a fine white powder), and it is dark brown at the base and whitish at the top. There can be fine hairs at the base, particularly in young specimens. The spore print is white. Spores are thin walled, ellipsoid, hyaline (translucent), and measure 5‚Äì7 by 3‚Äì3.4 Œºm. They are amyloid. The basidia are four-spored, club shaped, and measure 21‚Äì30 by 4.5‚Äì5.4 Œºm. Cheilocystidia (cystidia on the gill edge) are club-shaped, hyaline to dark grey, and measure 24‚Äì34 by 5‚Äì11 Œºm. Habitat and distribution Mycena semivestipes is a saprobic species that obtains nutrients from the decomposing logs and stumps of hardwoods, in which it fruits in dense clusters. Fruiting occurs in later fall and winter in eastern North America.

Career  W√ºster became enthusiastic about Esperanto when he was 15, soon coming to the fore as an Esperanto translator and as the author of various monographs and numerous articles, particularly on questions of Esperanto terminology and lexicography. He trained in electrical engineering and later took over his father's factory. From mid-1918 to 1920, as a 20- to 22-year-old student, he compiled the core of the legendary encyclopedic Esperanto-German dictionary,:eo:Enciklopedia Vortaro Esperanta-Germana which is still unmatched to this day for its detailed and faithful presentation of the early vocabulary of Esperanto and the usage of its founder, L.L. Zamenhof. The experience W√ºster acquired in compiling this dictionary formed the basis for his Stuttgart thesis,Internationale Sprachnormung in der Technik, besonders in der Elektrotechnik (International language standardization in technology, particularly in electronics), Berlin 1931 which is regarded as a seminal work on Terminology Science (2nd edition, Bonn 1966). Due to his research on international technical communication, the Technical Committee for Terminology Standardization of the International Organization for Standardization (ISO/TC 37) was established in 1936. W√ºster forged the international principles of terminology standardization and contributed significantly to the foundations of the modern information society. The influence of W√ºster's terminology ideas has been enormous especially in the medical field, where it has also given rise to a critical reaction.Barry Smith, Werner Ceusters and Rita Temmerman, ‚ÄúW√ºsteria‚Äù, Medical Informatics Europe (MIE 2005), Geneva, Studies in Health Technology and Informatic, 116 (2005), 647‚Äì652.

The film premiered at the 2011 Sundance Film Festival and went into general release on June 3, 2011. The film explores the consequences of mining and burning coal, with a particular focus on the use of a method for coal strip-mining in Appalachia commonly known as mountaintop removal mining. Based in part on Robert F. Kennedy, Jr.'s 2005 book, Crimes Against Nature and featuring Kennedy and a cast of activists and experts, the film considers the health consequences of mining and burning coal and looks at the context and history of environmental laws in the United States. Exploring a proposal to build a wind farm on a mountain in the heart of \\"coal country,\\" rather than deforesting and demolishing the mountain for the coal seams within, the film suggests that wind resources are plentiful in the U.S., would provide many domestic jobs and that wind is a more benign source of power than coal and has the potential to eliminate the destructive aspects of coal. Story The Last Mountain tells the story of the fight for Coal River Mountain in West Virginia, where community members and environmental activists are pitted against a coal company in the struggle to save one of the last large mountain ranges in‚Äì the area from mountaintop removal. Massey Energy (purchased by Alpha Natural Resources in 2011) has many of the necessary permits and plans to blow up the mountain and fill the nearby valleys and streams with the resulting rubble, but the activists would like to build a wind farm on the mountain‚Äôs ridges instead. They have even commissioned a study demonstrating that Coal River Mountain has a high wind potential ‚Äì high enough to produce 328 megawatts of electricity, which can power 70,000 homes. Both approaches ‚Äì a wind farm or a coal strip mine ‚Äì would produce needed electricity, however the results are very different. Massey and the coal industry maintain that they are creating jobs and would reclaim the mountain, while the activists present a very different picture and claim that with mountaintop removal mining the land cannot be properly reclaimed, that the practice destroys their air and water, produces fewer jobs than traditional underground mining. While the locals work these jobs and worry constantly if they will have a job the following day. The film is told from the point of view of environmental litigator and activist Robert F. Kennedy, Jr. and several activists including Maria Gunnoe (Goldman Prize winner), Bo Webb (Purpose Prize winner), Ed Wiley and West Virginia based environmental attorney Joe Lovett of the Appalachian Mountain Advocates (formerly the Appalachian Center for the Economy and the Environment.) The coal industry‚Äôs perspective is explained by the president of the West Virginia Coal Association, Bill Raney, while the infamous ex-CEO of Massey Energy, Don Blankenship, presents his views in several public forums. The film also h12ui3r¬ßiu2r3y¬ß2op7i4rtyipyedgblefyo27trk2u3egegh3io7rt] and Mountain Justice who participate in acts of civil disobedience to stop coal mining all together, surface and underground: chaining themselves to mining equipment, climbing giant cranes, and camping out at the tops of trees in mid-winter to stop Massey Energy from demolishing the mountain. The film highlights statistics on mining including the fact that five hundred of Appalachia‚Äôs mountains have been flattened by mountaintop removal coal mining while being rebuilt by land reclamation projects and of streams that only have water in them during hard rains moved to the sides of the valley fills. Experts including Alan Hershkowitz, Senior Scientist at the Natural Resources Defense Council, former dean of the Yale School of Forestry & the Environment Gus Speth, and Vanity Fair writer and Coal River author Michael Shnayerson, put the story in political and environmental context. Scientists including Ben Stout III and Devra Davis provide additional explanation on the dangers of the toxins which are produced by coal mining, coal processing and coal burning. The Last Mountain makes the point that the fight for Coal River Mountain, although a local story, has national and international significance. As of the making of the film, nearly 50% of America‚Äôs electricity came from burning coal, 30% of that coal came from Appalachia, and burning coal was the number one contributor to greenhouse gas emissions worldwide. The film maintains that huge amounts of money are poured into the political system from coal mining, coal transportation and coal burning industries and that in the face of this, the resulting political system is not fully engaged in the regulation of these activities, and that the democratic system itself is compromised. Characters The Last Mountain begins by introducing local activist Maria Gunnoe, who describes how the hills surrounding her home in the town of Bob White, WV have been \\"turned inside out\\" and demolished, stripping away forest cover and topsoil and leaving less permeable rock in its place. She argues that this is the cause of flash floods in the community, and one flood in particular that nearly washed her and her family away. She also describes how her and her friends work has caused people to move out because of the fewer jobs available in the community. The film takes viewers to the town of Prenter, West Virginia, in the Coal River Valley where a citizen-turned- activist Jennifer Hall-Massey explains that six of her immediate neighbors have died of brain tumors and the only thing they all have in common is well water. As reported by the NY Times, Hall-Massey along with 264 of her neighbors, are suing the local coal companies and state that the companies have pumped millions of gallons of coal slurry into the ground surrounding the town of Prenter, polluting their well water with heavy metals like arsenic and lead, and causing disease. Another citizen activist, Ed Wiley, a former mountaintop removal coal miner himself, who lives in the Coal River Valley, is trying to move his granddaughter's school, Marsh Fork Elementary, to a safer location. The school sits several hundred feet below an earthen dam holding back a slurry pond with of coal waste discharged by an industrial coal preparation plant next door to the school. Wiley‚Äôs granddaughter told him that the coal was making the children sick, driving Wiley to take his protest to then Governor Joe Manchin (now a U.S. Senator from West Virginia), and demand help from the state. Manchin and other West Virginia politicians argue that the state‚Äôs economy and its jobs depend on coal mining. Manchin calls himself \\"friend of coal\\". But the film presents statistics showing that over the last 30 years while coal production has increased 140% due to the use of massive mining equipment and explosives, the number of jobs has decreased by 65%, due to the use of technology. While members of the coal industry maintain that environmental regulations take away jobs, others in the film suggest that the use of machines and explosives ‚Äì in particular in the pursuit of strip mining ‚Äì has been the cause of job losses in recent decades. The film presents Don Blankenship as an antagonist. The ex-CEO of Massey Energy does not believe in climate change, believes that environmentalists are \\"extremists\\", and continues by saying, \\"they are making American labor the real endangered species as they tell us that their goal is to save the planet.\\" The film presents statistics asserting that between 2000 and 2006, Massey was cited for 60,000 environmental violations by the federal Environmental Protection Agency, but given a fine of less than 1% of what the regulations call for ‚Äì and then continued to violate environmental laws 8,500 more times in the subsequent months. Meanwhile, activists like Bo Webb and Lorelei Scarbro, who live in the shadow of Coal River Mountain, have organized a group of citizens to propose that instead of destroying the mountain, a sustainable wind farm be built on the mountain‚Äôs ridges instead ‚Äì an energy project that could power 70,000 homes with renewable energy virtually forever. But Massey Energy and now Alpha Natural Resources has a permit to destroy over of the mountain instead. Over time, the wind farm would provide more jobs to the community, and on day-one it would pay more taxes to the county than the coal strip mine, Scarbro explains. Members of Climate Ground Zero pull off a tree-sit in the blasting zone of Coal River Mountain one winter night and sit in protest for nine days until they are arrested for attempting to halt the destruction of this symbolic mountain. While Robert F. Kennedy, Jr. maintains that \\"The United States is the Saudi Arabia of wind,\\" The Last Mountain concludes by exploring small scale wind projects on the coast of Rhode Island which have paid for themselves within a few years. The film ends with the fate of Coal River Mountain still in the balance and Maria Gunnoe's assertion that, \\"Coal is mean. Coal is cruel and coal kills. And the American people need to find their position where that is. You're connected to coal, whether you realize it or not. Everybody's connected to this. And everybody's causing it, and everybody's allowing it.\\" Criticism Green For All writer Eric Mathis called the wind study presented in the movie \\"misleading\\", and said the movie paradoxically maintains the \\"destructive mechanism\\" that it opposes. Ken Ward noted that \\"The movie has problems, though. A bit of the effort to tell the story with Bobby Kennedy as the central character seems overly forced. Also, to fit into their narrative, the filmmakers ignore the fact that a major rule making change that helped mountaintop removal continue was started by the Clinton administration, not by George W. Bush.‚ÄùThe Charleston Gazette (June 10, 2011).A Few Thoughts on the Last Mountain.

(though it was primarily a reprint title from 1978 to the end of its run). Telling fictional stories of the United States Army, it was a sister title of the other Charlton war comics Fightin' Air Force, Fightin' Marines, and Fightin' Navy. In the late 1960s, Fightin' Army was the host of the ongoing feature \\"The Lonely War of Willy Schultz,\\" written by Will Franz and illustrated by Sam Glanzman. Other notable contributors to Fightin' Army included Jon D'Agostino, Sanho Kim, Jack Keller, Rocke Mastroserio, and Warren Sattler. Don Perlin drew a majority of covers in 1972‚Äì1973. Editors Pat Masulli (1957‚Äì1966) and George Wildman (1971‚Äì1984) both had long tenures in charge of the title.  Publication history  As with many comic book titles published at the time, Fightin' Army did not start with issue number one; it was a renaming of a series called Soldier and Marine Comics, which published five issues, numbered #11‚Äì15, from Dec. 1954 - Aug. 1955. The title became Fightin' Army with issue #16, published in January 1956. Early issues of Fightin' Army sported such taglines as \\"Breathtaking Action Stories,\\" \\"Action Packed Battle Stories,\\" \\"Thrill Packed Combat,\\" and \\"Rip-Snorting Combat Tales.\\" Issues #120 ‚Äì #126 (Sept. 1975 ‚Äì Oct. 1976) featured painted covers. Like the entire Charlton line, Fightin' Army went on a publishing hiatus between January and August 1977, issues #126 and #127. From issue #132 (Apr. 1978) onward, Fightin' Army was primarily a reprint title, mostly using material from earlier issues, as well as the 1963‚Äì1970 Charlton title Army War Heroes. Fightin' Army ran through issue #171, publishing a total of 157 issues.  Features  The Fightin' Army letter column was called \\"Weapons, Wars, and Wisdom.\\" Reader letters were answered by the fictional \\"General Knowett.\\" The bulk of the stories in Fightin' Army take place during World War II, but as the series moved along, more were set during the Korean War. The Vietnam War was only rarely featured, and only made the cover of two issues, #65 (Dec. 1965) and #135 (Nov. 1978). = \\"The Lonely War of Willy Schultz\\" = From 1967‚Äì1970, Fightin' Army ran an ongoing World War II feature called \\"The Lonely War of Willy Schultz,\\" written by Will Franz and illustrated by Sam Glanzman. \\"Willy Schultz\\" was a departure from most other combat features of this time, with its conflicted hero caught between loyalties, in part because of his German heritage. During combat in the European Theater, U.S. Army captain Schultz is falsely accused and convicted of murder; he escapes and blends into the German Army while seeking a way to clear his name and retain his Allied allegiance. The feature, reprinted as late as 1999,The Lonely War Of Willy Schultz #1‚Äì4 (May-Nov. 1999), published by Avalon Communications / America's Comics Group was serialized in Charlton's Fightin' Army #76‚Äì92 (Oct. 1967 - July 1970), skipping only issue #81.

Founding  One impetus of the charity's creation was a 2009 episode of the comedy series Moving Wallpaper which featured transphobic jokes. One of the co-founders of TMW is Josephine Shaw, a longtime activist for trans rights. She worked directly with the organisation from 2009-2012 and continues external activism for similar causes related to trans and intersex rights. Some of her main accomplishments heading the organisation included being at the forefront of Memorandum of Understanding with Channel 4 that took place in 2011 as well as research for Channel 4 following, helping to establish the BBC Trans Comedy award, and was a key player in the Leveson Inquiry. Research In April 2010, TMW published 'How Transgender People Experience the Media', which describes the findings of a study conducted between November 2009 and February 2010 to learn how transgender people in the UK feel about the media portrays them. The research concluded that humiliating and demeaning characterisations of trans people in the media play a significant role in encouraging societal prejudice and abuse towards the community.  Memorandum of understanding  In March 2011, UK broadcaster Channel 4 became the inaugural signatory of TMW's memorandum of understanding (MoU), a document which calls for better media representation of trans people. In May 2011, Women in Journalism became a signatory, acknowledging the killing of eminent human rights lawyer and trans woman Sonia Burgess, and its subsequent prejudicial media coverage, as stimulus to do so. The Observer newspaper also took notice of TMW due to Burgess' death, saying there is a \\"need for sensitivity and respect\\" when dealing with transgender stories. Paris Lees, a British transgender journalist, worked with Trans Media Watch to persuade the broadcaster to commit to removing all transphobic material from their content. She was working for Channel 4 at the time and was instrumental in getting the broadcaster to be a signatory. At the MoU launch, held at Channel 4's London headquarters, Lynne Featherstone, the junior Minister for Equality, said \\"Congratulations to Trans Media Watch for this brilliant initiative and to Channel 4 for being the first (hopefully of many) broadcasters to sign up.\\" The signing was criticised by Channel 4‚Äôs disability editorial manager, Alison Walsh. Her concern was that the memorandum, which calls for positive, well- informed representation of transgender people in the media, was a form of media censorship. The chair of Trans Media Watch, Jennie Kermode responded by affirming that the purpose of the memorandum is to provide a balanced and accurate coverage, and was not to discourage honest or challenging portrayals of transgender people.  Leveson inquiry  In December 2011, Trans Media Watch made a submission to the Leveson Inquiry into the \\"culture, practice and ethics of the press,\\" in which it described the \\"unethical and often horrific and humiliating treatment of transgender and intersex people by the British press.\\" In February 2012, a TMW representative gave evidence in person. Other activities In 2012, Trans Media Watch hosted a journalism and broadcasting conference at the University of London Union. The event, called Trans Media Watch European Conference 2012, took place on 7 October 2012, and was open to non-professionals so that transgender and intersex people could learn about the British and European media. In May 2015, Trans Media Watch filed a complaint with the Independent Press Standards Organisation (IPSO), for discriminatory remarks and violations of privacy published by The Sun in 2014. The complaint was a response to disparaging remarks made by journalist Rod Liddle at the expense of Emily Brothers, a transgender politician who was standing for election as a member of parliament for the Sutton and Cheam constituency. After a process of adjudication, the IPSO upheld the complaint, and ruled that Mr Liddle and The Sun were in breach of the Editors' Code of Practice. The TMW did not represent Ms Brothers in their complaint, but raised the issue as a \\"representative group\\" affected by Mr Liddle's implications.  Trans Media Action  In September 2011, Trans Media Watch and On Road Media launched the Trans Media Action initiative, with support from the BBC and Channel 4. Trans Media Action comprised a series of workshops and other initiatives designed to facilitate understanding between transgender people and journalists.

Osprey feed on northern pike, which in turn feed on perch which eat bleak A food chain is a linear network of links in a food web starting from producer organisms (such as grass or trees which use radiation from the Sun to make their food) and ending at apex predator species (like grizzly bears or killer whales), detritivores (like earthworms or woodlice), or decomposer species (such as fungi or bacteria). A food chain also shows how the organisms are related with each other by the food they eat. Each level of a food chain represents a different trophic level. A food chain differs from a food web, because the complex network of different animals' feeding relations are aggregated and the chain only follows a direct, linear pathway of one animal at a time. Natural interconnections between food chains make it a food web. A common metric used to the quantify food web trophic structure is food chain length. In its simplest form, the length of a chain is the number of links between a trophic consumer and the base of the web. The mean chain length of an entire web is the arithmetic average of the lengths of all chains in the food web. The food chain is an energy source diagram. The food chain begins with a producer, which is eaten by a primary consumer. The primary consumer may be eaten by a secondary consumer, which in turn may be consumed by a tertiary consumer. For example, a food chain might start with a green plant as the producer, which is eaten by a snail, the primary consumer. The snail might then be the prey of a secondary consumer such as a frog, which itself may be eaten by a tertiary consumer such as a snake. Food chains are very important for the survival of most species. When only one element is removed from the food chain it can result in extinction of a species in some cases. A producer can use either solar energy or chemical energy to convert organisms into usable compounds. Because the sun is necessary for photosynthesis, life could not exist if the sun disappeared. Decomposers, which feed on dead animals, break down the organic compounds into simple nutrients that are returned to the soil. These are the simple nutrients that plants require to create organic compounds. It is estimated that there are more than 100,000 different decomposers in existence. Many food webs have a keystone species. A keystone species is a species that has a large impact on the surrounding environment and can directly affect the food chain. If this keystone species dies off it can set the entire food chain off balance. Keystone species keep herbivores from depleting all of the foliage in their environment and preventing a mass extinction. Food chains were first introduced by the Arab scientist and philosopher Al-Jahiz in the 10th century and later popularized in a book published in 1927 by Charles Elton, which also introduced the food web concept. Food chain length This food web of waterbirds from Chesapeake Bay is a network of food chains The length of a food chain is a continuous variable providing a measure of the passage of energy and an index of ecological structure that increases through the linkages from the lowest to the highest trophic (feeding) levels. Food chains are often used in ecological modeling (such as a three-species food chain). They are simplified abstractions of real food webs, but complex in their dynamics and mathematical implications. Ecologists have formulated and tested hypotheses regarding the nature of ecological patterns associated with food chain length, such as increasing length increasing with ecosystem size, reduction of energy at each successive level, or the proposition that long food chain lengths are unstable. Food chain studies have an important role in ecotoxicology studies, which trace the pathways and biomagnification of environmental contaminants. Producers, such as plants, are organisms that utilize solar or chemical energy to synthesize starch. All food chains must start with a producer. In the deep sea, food chains centered on hydrothermal vents and cold seeps exist in the absence of sunlight. Chemosynthetic bacteria and archaea use hydrogen sulfide and methane from hydrothermal vents and cold seeps as an energy source (just as plants use sunlight) to produce carbohydrates; they form the base of the food chain. Consumers are organisms that eat other organisms. All organisms in a food chain, except the first organism, are consumers. Food chain length is important because the amount of energy transferred decreases as trophic level increases; generally only ten percent of the total energy at one trophic level is passed to the next, as the remainder is used in the metabolic process. There are usually no more than five tropic levels in a food chain. Humans are able to receive more energy by going back a level in the chain and consuming the food before, for example getting more energy per pound from consuming a salad than an animal which ate lettuce. However, this does not work in all cases. For example, humans do not have the ability to directly digest grass or the nutrients from wild plants but can naturally obtain these nutrients by (killing and) consuming the meat from deer, antelope, or other grass-eating animals. Food chains are very important for the survival of most species. When only one element is removed from the food chain it can result in extinction of a species in some cases. The efficiency of a food chain depends on the energy first consumed by the primary producers. The primary consumer gets its energy from the producer. The tertiary consumer is the 3rd consumer, it is placed at number four in the food chain. Producer ‚Äî‚Äî‚Äî- Primary Consumer ‚Äî‚Äî‚Äî‚Äî Secondary Consumer ‚Äî‚Äî‚Äî‚Äî Tertiary Consumer.

He was known in medieval Europe as Jesu Occulist. He was the author of the influential Memorandum of the Oculists, where for the first time in the literature a surgical anaesthetic is prescribed. He wrote the landmark textbook on ophthalmology in medieval Islam, Notebook of the Oculists, for which he was known in medieval Europe as Jesu Occulist, with \\"Jesu\\" being a Latin translation of \\"Isa\\", the Arabic name for Jesus. Ibn 'Isa is considered one of the most famous physicians of the tenth century. His famous Notebook of the Oculists combined information obtained from both Greco-Roman and Arab sources. The book encompassed information on treatment and classification of over one hundred different eye diseases. In the book, eye diseases were sorted by their anatomical location. The Notebook of the Oculists was widely used by European physicians for hundreds of years. Ibn Isa‚Äôs book was one of the first, along with Hunayn ibn Ishaq‚Äôs Ten Treatises on the Eye, to illustrate anatomy of the eye. Specifically, Ibn Isa illustrated the optic chiasm and brain. Ibn Isa was the first to describe and suggest treatment for an array of diseases. For example, he was the first to discover the symptoms of Vogt‚ÄìKoyanagi‚ÄìHarada syndrome (VKH) - ocular inflammation associated with a distinct whitening of the hair, eyebrows, and eyelashes. Ibn Isa was also the first to classify epiphora as being a result of overzealous cautery of pterygium. In addition to this pioneering description, Ibn Isa also suggested treatments for epiphora based on the stage of the disease ‚Äì namely treatment in the early stages with astringent materials, for example ammonia salt, burned copper, or lid past and a hook dissection with a feathered quill for chronic stages of epiphora. Ibn Isa is also thought to be the first to describe temporal arteritis, although Sir Jonathan Hutchinson (1828‚Äì1913) is erroneously credited with this.

Annada Mangal (), or Nutan Mangal (), is a Bengali narrative poem in three parts by Bharatchandra Ray, written in 1752-53. It eulogizes Hindu goddess Annapurna, a form of Parvati, worshipped in Bengal. It is the only poem in medieval Mangalkavya tradition that does not create a separate subgenre as no other poet ever ventured to praise Annapurna in their works. Annada Mangal is divided into three Books: Annada Mangal or Annada Mahatmya, Bidya Sundar or Kalika Mangal and Mansingh or Annapurna Mangal. Annada Mangal or Annada Mahatmya has three separate narratives. The first narrative describes the stories of Shiva and Dakshayani, the birth of Parvati, the marriage of Shiva and Parvati, the founding of Varanasi and Parvati's staying in Varanasi as Annapurna. The second narrative describe Vyasa‚Äôs attempt to found Vyasakashi and his subsequent failure while the third narrative describes the story of Hari Hor and Bhabananda Majumdar, the ancestors of Krishna Chandra Roy, king of Nadia and Bharatchandra's patron. Bidya Sundar, borrowed from the legend of Princess Bidya of Bardhaman and Prince Sundar of Kanchi, is a popular love story, which, in later years, was frequently adopted for stage. This part belongs to Kalika Mangal, a minor subgenre of Mangalkavya. Mansingh or Annapurna Mangal is a historical narrative of Mansingh, Bhabananda Majumdar and Pratapaditya of Jessore. The narratives are borrowed from various puranic text, chronicles and legends including Kashi Khanda Upapurana, Markandeya Purana, Bhagavat Purana, Chaurapanchashika by Bilhana, Kshitishvangshavali Charitam as well as popular hearsays. A lively use of Sanskrit metres and rhetoric is found in the poem. The surviving manuscripts of the text were dated from 1776 to 1829. Annada Mangal was first published by Ganga Kishore Bhattacharya in 1816. Iswar Chandra Vidyasagar‚Äôs edition of the poem (1853) is now considered as the standard one.

Dispute overview  Louis Pasteur a French chemist, supported the idea that fermentation was a biological process. Justus von Liebig, a German chemist, supported the idea that fermentation was a mechanical process. Both chemists had different methods of experimentation, and they focused on different aspects of fermentation because they had different ideas about where the fermentation began in an organism. The Liebig‚ÄìPasteur feud started in 1857 when Pasteur said that fermentation can occur in the absence of oxygen. The two were aware of the other's works, but continued working with their own theories. The two mention each other's names, as well as other scientists‚Äô names, in articles and other publications about the processes and causes of fermentation.  Pasteur‚Äôs position  Pasteur observed that fermentation does not require oxygen, but needs the yeast, which is alive. The fermentation process is a biological process, not a reduction and oxygen chemical process. He used two slender bottles. One of the bottles had a curved neck; this is called a Swan neck duct. Pasteur poured liquid broth into the two bottles, and heated in the bottom of the bottles. When the bottles of liquid boiled, he let them cool. Pasteur observed that the broth in the curved bottle stayed clear, except when the bottle was shaken. Pasteur explained that the two bottles were filled with air, but the curved bottle could stop most of the particles in the air, and it kept its nature. However, the liquid in the other bottle degenerated. Therefore, he concluded that fermentation does not require oxygen, but needs the yeast. When yeast is allowed to grow over time, the substance will spoil or rot. Pasteur's view of fermentation can be said to fall under the vitalism point of view. He observed that living organisms were responsible for the process of fermentation. Liebig‚Äôs position Liebig formulated his own theory claiming that the production of alcohol was not a biological process but a chemical process, discrediting the idea that fermentation could occur due to microscopic organisms. He believed that vibrations emanating from the decomposition of organic matter would spread to the sugar resulting in the production of solely carbon dioxide and alcohol. The change was facilitated by ferment or yeast, which has the characters of a compound of nitrogen in the state of putrefaction. Given that the ferment's susceptibility to change, it is submitted to decomposition, by the action of air (from which oxygen is provided), water (from which moisture is obtained), and a favorable temperature. Prior to contact with oxygen, the constituents are arranged together without action on each other. Through the oxygen, the state of rest (or equilibrium) of the attractions that keep the elements together has been disturbed. As a consequence of this disturbance, a separation or new arrangement of the elements has been formed. Fermentation occurs due to the transference of molecular instability from the ferment (atoms in motion) to the sugar molecules, and continues as long as the decomposition of the ferment continues.Gateway, UM-MEDSEARCH. The Lancet Volume I . London, 1841. Liebig's view of fermentation can be said to fall under a mechanism point of view. From his work, he saw that fermentation, as well as other catalysts happened by a chemical and mechanical process.  Liebig‚ÄìPasteur communications Pasteur responded to Liebig's works, often through his own writings, and using results from his own experiments to support his theories. For example, in 1858, Pasteur wrote a paper trying to disprove Liebig's theory that fermentation cannot be caused by the growth of the yeast when it takes place when yeast is added to pure sugar-water. Pasteur thought that in pure sugar-water, yeast was both growing and disintegrating, and developed experiments to support his theories. Liebig, however, was not convinced, and claimed that Pasteur was not solving the questions he had about the decomposition in fermentation. In 1869, Liebig responded to Pasteur's challenge, which he had made public ten years before. Liebig still held this ground, and mentioned that some of Pasteur's experiments were difficult to replicate and use effectively. Pasteur was furious, and suggested the Royal Academy hire a third scientist who replicate his experiments and verify his results in order to support his theories. Liebig nor the academy responded. Later on, Pasteur demanded a meeting with Liebig, but Liebig did not receive cordially, and refused to discuss the topic of fermentation.  Eduard B√ºchner  = Discovery of the active agent of fermentation = The famous controversy between Pasteur and Liebig over the nature of alcoholic fermentation was uncovered by Eduard B√ºchner, a German chemist and zymologist. Influenced by his brother Hans, who became the famous bacteriologist, B√ºchner developed an interest in the fermentation process in which yeast breaks down sugar into alcohol and carbon dioxide. He published his first paper in 1885 which revealed that fermentation could occur in the presence of oxygen, a conclusion contrary to the current prevailing view held by Louis Pasteur. By 1893, B√ºchner was fully involved in seeking the active agent of fermentation. He obtained pure samples of the inner fluid of yeast cells by pulverizing yeast within a mixture of sand and diatomaceous earth, then squeezing the mixture through a canvas filter. This process avoided the destructive method of using solvents and high temperatures which had foiled previous investigations. He assumed that the collected fluid was incapable of producing fermentation because the yeast cells were dead. However, when he attempted to preserve the fluid in concentrated sugar, he was startled to observe carbon dioxide being released, a sign that fermentation was taking place. B√ºchner hypothesized that the fermentation was caused by an enzyme which he named zymase. His findings that fermentation was the result of chemical process both inside and outside cells, were published in 1897.  Legacies of the Liebig‚ÄìPasteur dispute  Neither Liebig nor Pasteur was completely right. However, each of their arguments led to more discoveries that created a lot of today's fields in science and medicine. Berzelius had defined the word \\"ferment\\" as being an example of catalytic activity. Soon after, Schwann discovered pepsin was the substance responsible for albuminous digestion in the stomach. He believed this was what Berzelius defined as catalysts, or the force for chemical reactions of mineral, organic and living matter. Liebig opposed the idea by saying that the terms catalysts and pepsin are not supposed to be used as they are only representatives of an idea. Charles Cagniard-Latour,Cagniard-Latour, C. (1837): M√©moire sur la fermentation vineuse. In: Annales de chimie et de physique. Bd. 68, 1837, S. 206‚Äì222 Theodor Schwann and Friedrich Traugott K√ºtzing identified independently yeast as a living organism that nourishes itself by the sugar it ferments, a process which referred to the ethanol fermentation (alcoholic fermentation). Liebig, Berzelius, and Wohler rejected the ideas of Schwann, Latour and Kutzing. In 1839, Liebig and Wohler published a paper on the role of yeast in alcoholic fermentation. In 1858, Liebig's student Moritz Traube enunciated the theorem, which was used for alcoholic fermentation, that all fermentations produced by living organisms are based on chemical reactions rather than a vital force itself. The dispute between Liebig and Pasteur had, in a way, slowed down the advances of science and medicine in the area of fermentation, alcohol fermentation, and the enzymes. On the other hand, the conflicting ideas sped up the research in the area of fermentation and enzymes through other scientists and chemists. Through B√ºchner and his experiment in fermentation, the world of science and medicine went further as to pave ways in enzyme and fermentation studies and marked one of the critical points of the history of modern chemistry.

Construction Atlanta, launched May 28, 1908, was the first vessel built at the Houghton shipyard after it had been taken over by Captain John L. Anderson from its former owners, Captains George Bartsch and Harry Tompkins, and renaming it the Anderson Shipyard before it was later renamed to Lake Washington Shipyard. This process had begun in 1906 at the suggest of Jacob Furth, a banker who had also financed the La Conner Trading and Transportation Company.Kline and Bayless, Ferryboats, at pages 147-48. Atlanta was built entirely of wood. The vessel and was long, beam, and was 87 gross tons and 59 registered tons in overall size. Atlanta was equipped with a double expansion compound steam engine, with cylinder dimensions of and with stroke of , generating .Newell, ed., McCurdy Marine History, at 446.

Anderson, and his firm, the Anderson Steamboat Company faced competition from government-owned and built ferries. Even so, he used his own vessels, the Fortuna and the Atlanta to transport people to Rainier Beach on Lake Washington to witness the launching, on December 5, 1913, of the new King County ferry Leschi.Newell, ed., McCurdy Marine History, at page 224. In 1917 Atlanta was still owned by Anderson Steamship Company. In the summer of 1922, Atlanta was successfully used as a tourist vessel by Capt. John L. Anderson, making a popular two-hour cruise of Elliott Bay, the Ballard Locks, Lake Union, the Lake Washington Ship Canal, and Lake Washington.Kline and Bayless, Ferryboats, at page 100. By this time, Anderson had sold his interests in his first business, the Anderson Steamboat Company, and was operating Atlanta under the business name of Anderson Water Tours.Kline and Bayless, Ferryboats, at page 154. Later years Anderson later sold Atlanta to King County, but leased it back from the county as part of his agreement to operate the county's ferry fleet. In November 1938, Anderson turned Atlanta back to the county, which, having no use for the vessel, sold it at a sheriff's auction for $510 to Russel T. Gibson. He then sold the vessel to Delta V. Smyth, an Olympia lumber mill owner who owned a number tug boats. Smyth removed Atlanta 's compound steam engine, and installed it in his tug Olympian. Walter House, who worked for Smyth's company, then installed a diesel engine in the Atlanta hull, and converted the vessel into a houseboat.Newell, ed., McCurdy Marine History, at page 466. In 1943, the diesel engine that had been placed in Atlanta was removed and installed in the tug Margaret S, which belonged to the American Tug Company, an Everett, Washington concern. Atlanta then became a shoreside house on Lake Union, where it was still in existence as of 1966.

The original lineup consisted of Renee LoBue, Ray Ketchem and Peter Langland-Hassan. The band released two albums, Status and Hold Tight the Ropes, in 2000 and 2002, respectively. After the second album, Langland-Hassan left the band, which led to the inclusion of Sean Eden and Barbara Endes. They released New Believers in 2007 under the new lineup, and it was followed by House of Tongues in 2010.  History  The band was formed after Langland-Hassan auditioned for Melting Hopefuls, a band that Ketchem and LoBue had been part of since 1990. The trio decided to have a fresh start with a new name for the band, rather than pretend that they were still the old one. The name refers to Elk City, an unincorporated community in Barbour County, West Virginia. Ketchem, a West Virginia native, drove past the town's sign one day, and he thought it would make a good name. LoBue later commented that they liked that the name combined a rural element (an elk) with an urban element (a city). When they started, the band's only instruments were an electric guitar and drums, played by Langland-Hassan and Ketchem, respectively, while LoBue and Langland-Hassan shared the lead vocals, but shortly after LoBue started playing bass on a Novation Bass Station analog synthesizer. They spent the next three years playing on small venues, working on developing their sound as they traveled together. In 1999, the band released an extended play, Dreams of Steam, with Starrysky Records. In early 2000, they changed the Bass Station for a Fender Rhodes Piano Bass, and later that year the band released their first full-length album, Status. It was released by Hidden Agenda Records (now Parasol Records) in the United States, and by Talitres in Europe in 2001. In November of that same year, London-based label Earworm Records released \\"Freeze Two Over Eight\\", one of the songs from Status, as a 7\\" single. The single featured the song \\"Judori\\" as a B-side, which is not included in any of their studio albums. The band had performed \\"Judori\\" at the late-1999 wedding of two of Langland-Hassan's friends, Jude and Midori. In 2000, Parasol Records included the band in volumes 1 and 2 of their Parasol's Sweet Sixteen series, with the songs \\"Dream of Steam\\" and \\"Love's Like a Bomb\\", respectively, as well as in Parasol Presents Christmas Singles with the song \\"Deer Crossing\\". In 2001, soon after the release of Status in Europe, the band played on Black Sessions, a French radio show hosted by Bernard Lenoir, and that was followed by a two-week tour in Europe. Also that year, one of their songs, \\"Three Ears\\", was included in This Is Next Year: A Brooklyn-Based Compilation, released by Arena Rock, while \\"Love's Like a Bomb\\", from Status, was included in Journey to End of Twilight: US Pop Life Vol. 9 North East, a compilation album released by Japanese label Contact Records. After their return to the U.S., the band signed a deal with Warm Records to release their next two recordings: an EP, The Sea Is Fierce, released on October 23, 2001, and their second studio album, Hold Tight the Ropes, released on May 7, 2002, by Warm Records in the U.S., and by Talitres Records in Europe that same month. During 2002, the band kept touring in the U.S., and near the end of the year they went on a tour in Europe that included shows in France, Greece, Italy and Spain. While on the tour they opened for American dream-pop/indie-pop band Luna on their presentations in Barcelona and Madrid, Spain, as part of their own European tour. In February 2003, \\"Summer Song\\" was included in Flak Magazine's compilation album Got No Songs on the Radio: The Best Music of 2002. The album takes its name from a lyric in Elk City's song. Langland-Hassan left the band after the release of the second album. LoBue and Ketchem continued playing as Elk City, with LoBue taking charge of performing all the vocals. In 2005, Sean Eden, ex-guitarist of Luna, and Barbara Endes, ex-bassist of The Lovelies, joined the band. On April 17, 2007, their third album, New Believers, was released by Friendly Fire Recordings, and that was followed by House of Tongues, released on June 1, 2010, by the same label; House of Tongues features Carl Baggaley on keyboards as part of the band. The band has participated on several tribute albums released by American Laundromat Records. They have covered: * \\"Monkey Gone to Heaven\\" for Dig for Fire: A Tribute to Pixies, released on November 13, 2007. * \\"Helpless\\" for Cinnamon Girl: Women Artists Cover Neil Young for Charity, released on February 12, 2008. * \\"Close to Me\\" for Just Like Heaven: A Tribute to The Cure, released on January 27, 2009. * \\"I Know It's Over\\" for Please, Please, Please: A Tribute to The Smiths, released on December 13, 2011.

In March 2011, 13 prisoners at the prison, including 80-year-old former judge Haitham al-Maleh and lawyer Anwar al-Bunni began a hunger strike to protest government oppression and the holding of political prisoners. On July 1, 2013, female detainees in the prison began hunger strike in response to negligence of their cases by the public prosecution of the Counterterrorism Court, and absence of approval of their respective trials. As of December, 2014, the jail is well beyond its 2,500 person capacity at over 7,000 prisoners of all types of accused offenders, from murderers to traffic violators. In August and September, 2015, Jaysh al- Islam shelled and stormed the prison, taking control of two buildings.

Performing live and in studio, his rhythm style may best be described as improvisational, melodic, progressive, and bluesy, over a wide variety of styles; reflecting influences from many genres of music. He is perhaps best known for his work as the original drummer for the Santa Cruz, California band Camper Van Beethoven, playing on all 17 tracks of their album Telephone Free Landslide Victory and many other tracks from various other Camper Van Beethoven releases. He was the principal drummer for Calm Down Juanita, World Entertainment War, Heaven On, Box O' Laffs, I Die Every Day, and he is currently the drummer for Fearporn. Biography Kevin Guess was born in 1964 and raised in King City, California, where he started playing drums as a young child. He attended San Lorenzo Elementary School in King City, where he studied music under Bruce Graham and later, Leon Olson, bandleader at King City Joint Union High School. At age 15, he played in It Became Monster (IBM) with Fidel Tirado and occasionally David Rodriguez, with whom he also played in another band, Whirlwind. At 16, he played in the Red Mountain Band with Pete Carney and with his elementary school drum teacher, Bruce Graham. He also played drums in many other duos and combos with local groups around the Salinas Valley. Around 1981, he began traveling to Santa Cruz with guitarist and childhood friend, Fidel Tirado, with whom he played in a duo, to take drum lessons from Rick Walker and to play music with Tirado; sometimes taking the Greyhound bus both ways, for the 75 mile trip to Santa Cruz to take those one-hour lessons. From 1983 to 1984, he played in a reggae band from Salinas, called Katchabeat aka Battlecry, with bassist Roger Rodgers and Brett Briggs on guitar, and then later with Kevin Nuckolls. on guitar in Briggs' place. Eventually, Guess left Katchabeat and he was replaced on drums by Nuckolls' brother, Darren Nuckolls. Guess also played drums in Grupo Tres Angles, teaming with Rodgers on bass again with guitarist Brett Briggs. Guess moved to Santa Cruz, California in 1984, a year after Tirado moved there, and he continued taking drum instruction from Rick Walker, who was at the time the drummer for the Santa Cruz band Tao Chemical. In 1985, performing as Anthony Guess, kevtone was principal drummer for the eclectic Santa Cruz band Box O' Laffs, playing with bassist David Lowery and keyboardist Chris Molla (both later of Camper Van Beethoven also) and also with guitarist Chris Hart and vocalist Eric Curkendall, on Box O' Laffs' 1985 album, Dogbook. Around the same time, the rhythm team of Guess and Nuckolls joined Heaven On; a young band formed around 1985 also, by vocalist and lyricist Xtremity X and guitarist George Earth, who had been working as a roadie for Guess' drum instructor's band. Keyboardist Kennedy Cosker, of The Quiet Ones, with whom Guess had previously played, joined Xtremity, Earth, Nuckolls, and Guess at the last minute, to compete in a contest, and together the five-member band won the 1986 Battle of the Bands at the Louden Nelson Center for Performing Arts in Santa Cruz. Heaven On disbanded shortly after that performance, though Guess, Nuckolls, and Earth would form a separate improvisation performance project that year and continue on as Circus Boy. They performed two shows in that grouping, once at a house party and once at Diane's Place in Santa Cruz, before Guess and Earth began jamming with bassist Daniel Vee Lewis, Lewis' wife, Pipa Pi√±on, and keyboardist David Hannibal. Anthony Guess played, recorded with, and contributed work to the alternative rock band Camper Van Beethoven on several releases, including their 1985 debut, the critically acclaimed and influential Telephone Free Landslide Victory, with its hit \\"Take the Skinheads Bowling\\"; in a lineup that included vocalist and guitarist Lowery, bassist Victor Krummenacher, violinist Jonathan Segel, and guitarist Molla. In 1986, Guess and George Earth together conceived of the unnamed band that would later become World Entertainment War. Guess played drums and co-wrote songs with Earth on lead guitar. They invited both Daniel Vee Lewis and David Hannibal to play bass and keyboards, respectively, for the new group, which still remained nameless. Rick Walker suggested they contact another local musician friend of his, Rob Brezsny, also of Tao Chemical, who was developing a new and broad idea that he called \\"World Entertainment War\\". After seeing Brezsny perform a spoken word show to a pre-recorded music tape, they did a jam show together a few weeks later. Brezsny was invited to join the band as lead vocalist and co- writer and together they then adopted the name and the concept, World Entertainment War. Singer Darby Gould was recruited six months later to join the band as co-lead vocalist. Keyboardist Hannibal left the band shortly and was replaced briefly by Sam Loya, who was then replaced by Amy Excolere. They performed regularly and recorded two albums; a self-titled debut and a follow- up called Give Too Much, consisting of the same recordings with two added tracks recorded at the same time, both released in 1991 by MCA Records. Guess continued doing live performances with World Entertainment War in a variety of venues until the group disbanded in 1993. Guess and bassist Daniel Lewis would later join another Santa Cruz-based band, Jivehounds, playing disco and old- school funk with vocalist Dante Dark and keyboardist Derek Sherinian. Guess played with them briefly and also was playing at the time with Shrida Honky, Cake, and Violin Sanity with Jim Hurley (musician). Guess left Santa Cruz in the summer of 1994, and moved to Seattle, Washington, where he would go on to perform as Kevin Guess. He continued playing and recording with a wide variety of other bands and performers; most notably, the Seattle-based Calm Down Juanita, a writing collaboration he formed with Steve Wilmans and Tyler Willman, that drew several other notable musicians into the studio with them, including bassist R. Cole Peterson, III, bassist-recording engineer Steve Feasley, saxophonist Skerik, Stone Gossard, Josh Freese, and John Doe. That project produced two albums, Calm Down Juanita and Undertown. Since 2000, Kevtone has worked with spoken word artist, Chris Daikos and has recorded several avant-garde songs with Daikos. Recordings included musicians such as Bob Antone, Hugh Pinkiepie, Jeff Warren, Alan Paisley, Steve Feasley, Chris Cronas and \\"Bama\\" James Ray. He continues his professional work as kevtone; recording or performing in some capacity with many other bands, including I Die Every Day, with James Stamper and Bama James Ray, in 2010 and The Mysterious Fatmen 2017 with Hugh Pinkiepie & Jeff Warren.

Habersham is credited with opening the first direct trade between Savannah, Georgia, and London, England. He was an influential advocate for slavery in the colonies and served as King Secretary of the Province and as President of the King's Council. In opposition to his adult sons, Habersham remained a Loyalist during the American Revolution. All three of Habersham's sons became actively involved in the Revolutionary movement. Joseph Habersham became a zealous revolutionary in 1774. After July 1776, both he and brother John took up arms against the British and their loyalist allies, while James Jr. contributed to the revolution through political and financial service. The senior Habersham's death in 1775 prevented the painful family division from extending into the war years. Early years Habersham was born in Beverley, Yorkshire, England, the son of a freeman and burgess, on 26 January 1712. He was baptised in the Anglican church of St. Mary's on 26 January 1715/16. In 1722, he moved to London, where he worked as a merchant apprentice. In the 1730s, Habersham began following the teachings of George Whitefield and converted to Wesleyan Methodism. At Whitefield's behest, Habersham traveled to the Georgia Colony as a missionary and schoolmaster in 1738. The decision changed the trajectory of Habersham's life. In addition to Whitefield, Habersham was associated with William Piercy, an English curate whom the Countess of Huntington had appointed to serve as president of Bethesda Orphanage, now the Bethesda Academy, near Savannah, Georgia. It is the oldest extant charity in North America. Habersham taught at Bethesda, and it was there, in Savannah, that Habersham met and married Mary Bolton. Business career In 1744, he became a merchant and set up a partnership with Francis Harris to make commercial trans-Atlantic trips to England. He and Harris's business was considered the first successful commercial endeavour in Georgia. With resources from this business, Habersham acquired land along rivers for rice planting. After the slavery ban in Georgia was lifted, his rice fields developed into a massive 15,000-acre plantation with 200 slaves. Politics By the 1750s Habersham had become politically influential. His advocacy for the economic benefits of slavery influenced a repeal on the ban of slavery. He was a senior counselor to the royal government of the colony and in 1754 was appointed King Secretary of the province. Beginning in 1767, Habersham served as president of the Upper House of the General Assembly. As president of the council, he also assumed the position of acting governor of Georgia during the 19-month absence to England of Governor James Wright in 1771/1772. All three of his sons became supporters of the American Revolution, but Habersham pledged his loyalty to the crown. He died on 28 August 1775. He is buried in Savannah's Colonial Park Cemetery.

He was involved in multiple revolts in Northeastern Brazil during the early 19th century.Homero do R√™go Barros, Frei Caneca: her√≥i e m√°rtir republicano (1983), 8 pages He acted as the main leader on the Pernambucan Revolt. As a journalist, he founded and edited Typhis Pernambucano, a weekly journal used on the Confederation of the Equator. Evaldo Cabral de Mello described him as: \\"The man in the history of Brazil that embodied the quintessential nativist sentiment was curiously a Lusitanian 'jus sanguinis'.\\" Early life Frei Caneca was the oldest son of Portuguese parents. His father, Domingos da Silva Rabelo, was a cooper from whom he got his nickname. His mother, Francisca Maria Alexandrina de Siqueira, was the cousin of a Carmelite nun. The family resided in Recife, more precisely in Fora-de-Portas, today known as Comunidade do Pilar, built during the Dutch Brazil era. He became a novice at the Carmo and took the Religious habit in 1796 and professed the next year (1797).  Career  Frei Caneca. He was ordained into the Carmelite Order in 1801, with the necessary apostolic dispensation of age 22, and created the Semin√°rio de Olinda. He was authorized to attend the courses that the Order had not offered. He attended the seminary and oratorians libraries in Recife. In 1803 he was designated to teach rhetoric and geometry at his convent. Later he taught rational and moral philosophy. At some point, \\"his interest goes beyond the walls of the cloister, as indicated by its provision in public chair geometry of Alagoas region.\\"It remained there a short time, given the prospect of appointment to the same chair in Recife, which failed to materialize by the Pernambucan Revolt of 1817. Frei Caneca shared liberalist ideas, republican thoughts, and attended the Academia do Para√≠so, one of the meeting places of those who, influenced by the French Revolution and US independence, conspired against Portuguese rule. Participation in revolts 349x349px = Movement in Pernambuco and prison in Bahia = Caneca's first foray into political life was during the Pernambucan Revolt when Pernambuco and other nearby states rebelled against the Portuguese royal court, which had relocated to Brazil during the Peninsular War. They felt that the government was ignoring the sugar-producing north in favor of the coffee-producing south, which was closer to Rio de Janeiro. The revolt proclaimed a Republic and organized the first independent government in the region. No reference to his participation survived: \\"In the opening events of sedition on March 6, as the formation of the provisional government. Thus it is that the list of voters who chose him, not in his name. His presence only detects the last weeks of existence of the regime, to monitor the republican army, which marched to the south of the province, in order to face the troops of the Count of Arcos, at which, according to the indictment, would have exercised captain of guerrillas.\\" He was the adviser to Republican South Army, which was commanded by Colonel Suassuna. After the rebellion was put down, he was imprisoned in Salvador for four years. During that time, he dedicated himself to the drafting of the Portuguese Grammar. = Return to Pernambuco = PardonedNossa Hist√≥ria. Year 3 issue 35. S√£o Paulo: Vera Cruz, 2006, p.44 in 1821, in the context of the constitutionalist movement in Portugal, Frei Caneca returned to Pernambuco and resumed political activities. During his trip, he came to be held in a gaol of Campina Grande. In 1821 he was involved in the so-called movement of Goiana, a second sedition emancipationist movement that proclaimed adherence to the Lisbon Cortes with the support of the principal owners of the north woods and cotton provincial support. An army of rural militias and frontline troops marched against Recife, without occupying the city. The goianistas failed to find substantial support in the southern forest. The \\"Beberibe Convention\\" consecrated in September the \\"status quo\\", predicting that Recife and Goiana would continue to operate in the areas under their control, pending the decision of the Courts. These determined the election of a provisional board that became the first self-government of the province in October 1821. = The Governing Board of Gervasio = Frei Caneca supported the formation of the first Board of Governors of Pernambuco, chaired by a trader, Gervasio Pires Ferreira, who appointed him to the public chair of geometry in Recife. It was a very Recifean Board, where the power came from the clergy, the urban strata, trade, the armed forces and the liberal professions - the defeated forces in 1817. Gervasio was the dominant figure of a government that wanted consensus. He was the leader of a Portuguese trade sector that was already nationalized by residence, by birth, and by family ties to the land. In 1822 Frei Caneca, who enthusiastically supported the Board, wrote the \\"Dissertation on what is meant by country citizen and duties to this with the same country.\\" He wanted to give theoretical formulation to one of the main objectives of Gervasio, which was to reconcile the Portuguese trade in the province with the new order. His main thesis was that the Portuguese domiciled in the ground and connected to it by family ties and interests should be considered as Pernambuco's main interest. Evaldo Cabral de Mello stated, \\"The Cortes of Lisbon, on one hand, and the regency of Dom Pedro, on the other, embodied in terms of 1817 aspirations, equally legitimate options, although incomplete and contradictory. On one hand, the Sovereign Congress offered a liberal regime, under a constitutional monarchy, though, from February 1822, was clear in Brazil that they would charge the price of not pure and simple restoration of the commercial monopoly, it was impossible to resurrect but a preferential system for trade and Portuguese navigation. In turn, the regency of Rio promised freedom of trade and independence but with the expected bill of building an authoritarian regime based in south-central (region of Brazil).\\" A battle during the Pernambucan Revolt. The government of Gervasio tried to gain time, waiting for a situation that would protect both options without entirely ruling out the separation from both Lisbon and Rio. The Board will be anathematized Varnhagen Jose Honorio Rodrigues, accused of lack of national feeling, their defense was made by Barbosa Lima Sobrinho). Under the pressure of a military riot, the joint Gervasio Pires Ferreira was coerced to join the cause of Rio de Janeiro and ended up deposed by a military uprising, forming a so-called \\"Yokels Government\\" in October 1822. = The Board of Yokels = On September 23, 1822, the so-called \\"Board of Yokels\\" was elected, which replaced the Gervasiana Board. This government lasted until December 1823. It was dominated by representatives of large landed property. elected members of the Board were President Afonso de Albuquerque Maranhao, Secretary Jose Mariano de Albuquerque and members Francisco Pais Barreto, squire Cape; Francisco de Paula Gomes dos Santos, Manuel Inacio Bezerra de Melo, Francisco de Paula Cavalcanti de Albuquerque and Jo√£o Nepomuceno Carneiro da Cunha. This led Frei Caneca to join the fray. His polemic with Jos√© Fernandes Gama and his nephew, Judge Bernardo Jos√© da Gama, conspiracy leaders criticized Gervasio, writing \\"Pythia Letters to Daman\\". 'Pedrosada' was a failed attempt to overthrow the Board of Yokels. Afterwards, the Gamas tried to recover in court and denounced what they called the Republican faction of the province, drawing up a list of suspects that included Frei Caneca. \\"Brother Mug sided with the opposition without fighting it, but he preferred to engage against the group in Rio de Janeiro, which intended to dictate the fate of the province. Frei Caneca even pronounced a gratitude prayer on the occasion of the thanksgiving ceremony in the Church of the Holy Body, by Pedro I acclamation as emperor. Only from the constitution of Manuel de Carvalho Pais de Andrade government that seven months after the inauguration proclaim the Confederation of Ecuador, there were signs of close collaboration of Frei Caneca with power, but also in the form of journalistic activity and, sporadically, giving his opinion on some of the big decisions that the government should take.\\" The first of his letters went out March 17, 1823, shortly after the 'Pedrosada'. It was published in the Mail of Rio de Janeiro, a periodical property of Jo√£o Soares Lisboa, who participated in the Confederation of the Equator, and died on September 30, 1824, wounded in combat during his escape through the interior of Pernambuco next to Brother Mug and other companions. Pedro da Silva Pedroso, or Pedrosa, was the governor of arms of the province that retraced the Pais Barreto alliance that toppled Gervasio, without which could depose him, for his support of Gama, in court. Frei Caneca never fought the Board of Yokels. He preferred to focus on the Pernambuco faction of the Court, endorsing the personnel policy of the emperor, be it under Jose Bonif√°cio, or under his successors. As for the Pedrosada, the established wanton that pronounced Pedrosa and Paula Gomes and Jos√© Fernandes Gama members of the government, and due to the imperial protection none of them were to be punished. Divided and demoralized, the Board of Yokels dragged a sad resistance until December 1823 when he resigned. Faced by the opposition of the old gervasistas around the mayor of Manuel de Carvalho Andrade, Navy Parent, and Cipriano Barata, who had returned from Lisbon Cortes; and the pressures of Rio de Janeiro, which required Pernambuco monthly amounts of the king's time and further two million, equivalent to shipments to Portugal after the departure of the king. = The Confederation of Ecuador = He and others soon grew frustrated with the constitution of the newly formed Empire of Brazil,Enciclop√©dia Barsa.

S√£o Paulo: Globo, 2005, p.56 In addition, he published Typhis Pernambucano, a pro-Confederation newspaper critical of Pedro I and the imperial government from 1823 to 1824. It is essential to know the political and provincial context of Brother Mug political works, the situation in which they lived Pernambuco and the other provinces to understand the movement that represented the Confederation of Ecuador - muffled under \\"the weight of Saquarema's tradition in Brazilian historiography Independence\\", that is, which Evaldo Cabral de Mello called \\"the historiography of Rio de Janeiro state court and its epigones in the Republic\\" claiming for the three great provinces of the Southeast the role of builders of nationality. The revolutionary Pernambuco cycle cannot, of course, be considered separatists - but the presumption of separatism was the result of the gap occurred between the emancipation process in the Southeast and Northeast. In Rio, says Cabral de Mello, \`The Independence began as a dispute between absolutists and liberals around the United Kingdom of Portugal organization and even then not cogitated separation Portugal, only to preserve the status acquired by Brazil within the Lusitanian empire. The situation was very different in the Northeast, where independence has started with a dispute between colony and metropolis, with the difference that the latter was no longer in Lisbon but in Rio de Janeiro... The bay of Recife, and the reefs that gave the city its name. In 1823 during the movement known as 'Pedrosada', Brother Mug I wrote \\"The Hunter\\" and \\"Pythia Letters to Daman\\". Says Cabral de Mello, page 29 of the cited work: \\"In the euphoria that followed the liberal revolution of the Kingdom, the expectations of reducing the burden of taxes in trade and agriculture were not lower than the rest of Brazil. They were perhaps larger, since the installation of the court in 1808, Pernambuco was burdened with new taxes for including the public lighting of Rio, promptly revoked by Gervasio's Board. (...) The state of bankruptcy that had reduced Banco do Brasil with the return of King John VI and the establishment of provincial boards had severely limited the action of the Court, which had only the customs resources and province of Rio de Janeiro time the other provinces also denied resources. Thus, the north accession to the emperor was above all a matter of urgent financial, coffee not as profitable at the mid-30s, so the main line of the tax revenue which had to come from sugar and cotton, products predominantly northerners.\\" He took part with Cipriano Barata, as one of the leaders in the Ecuadorian Confederation, republican and separatist movement. His arguments are not directed against the emperor but against what he considered the authoritarian drift of Jose Bonifacio. After September 7, \\"the intensification of the fight between Jose Bonifacio and the liberals of the Court had led to censorship of the press, with the closure of newspapers and the attack on the director of the Malagueta, and the arrest of more than 300 individuals, the same who had beaten for independence since the departure of John VI\\". There were other dissatisfaction reasons: requirements of Rio de Janeiro state treasury, the draft constitution published by the Correio Brasiliense in September 1822, the creation of the Swiss battalion, the foundation of the Apostolate, the institution of Imperial Cruise Order, seen as \\"the club of servile aristocrats.\\" Evaldo Cabral de Mello believes it would be more appropriate instead of Pernambuco republicanism, consider itself autonomous.\\"The Revolution project was ancient in Pernambuco\\" later comment on the judge of Appeals that dismissed the motion. There was \\"a reinterpretation of provincial history in the light of revolutionary modernity represented by the political philosophy of the Enlightenment and the French Revolution.\\" For Brother Mug and the Autonomous Party, punished by Republican failure in 1817, \\"the provincial autonomy had priority over the form of government.\\" They would be ready to enter into a commitment to the Rio, which in exchange for acceptance of the monarchical regime, would give ample relief to provinces. There would be no reason to reject the monarchy, since authentically constitutional and since preserved the franchises. Reading the newspaper, Cipriano Barata, \\"The Sentinel of Liberty\\", denied the charges of republicanism. In 1824 Frei Caneca became one of the advisers of Manuel de Carvalho Pais de Andrade, opining against recognizing Francisco Pais Barreto, the squire of the Cabo, as president of Pernambuco. He opined the Alagoas invasion, in order to eradicate the counter-revolutionary forces squire of Cabo; and against the oath of the Constitution bestowed by D. Pedro I. Says Evaldo Cabral de Mello that \\"Brother Mug underestimated the means at the disposal of Rio Court, overestimating the other hand, the local will of resistance to Rio's despotism.\\" D. Pedro I suspended constitutional guarantees in the province, punishing it territorially, amputating the district of San Francisco, on which was the left bank of the river San Francisco, now incorporated into the territory of Bahia. Recife underwent naval blockade, this time by Admiral Cochrane, who bombarded the city. Pernambuco was invaded from the south by the troops of Brigadier Lima e Silva. Since the sugarcane owners in the south woods remained neutral, his troops easily occupied Recife on September 12, 1824. Again defeated, he took refuge with a part of his troops in the countryside and fled north towards Cear√°. During this flight, he started writing the \\"Route\\".  The Typhis Pernambucano  On December 25, 1823 circulated the first issue of \\"Typhis Pernambucano\\" newspaper that would be the trench of Brother Mug until the settlement of the Confederacy.

On December 18 he was tried by a military commission, found guilty, and sentenced to death by hanging. In court documents, Frei Caneca was indicted as one of the rebellion's leaders and for writing incendiary papers. The two other leaders were Stinho Bezerra Cavalcanti, captain of grenadiers and commander of the 4th Battalion Gunners Henriques, and Francisco de Souza Rangel. Altogether the execution involved eleven confederates, including three in Rio de Janeiro. The first was Brother Mug, who charged with sedition and rebellion. On January 13, 1825, was set up the hanging of the show before the walls of the Fort of Five Points. Stripped of religious habit, i.e. \\"without the orders in the Rosary church, the sacred canons form\\" still having three executioners who refused to hang him. The Military Commission ordered his death by firing squad, (\\"since it can not be hanged for disobedience of the executioners\\"). Attached to one of the gallows rods, by a platoon under the command of the same official. His body was placed near one of the gates of the Carmelite church in the center of Recife, being collected by religious and buried in place until now unidentified. The wall against which the cleric was shot, next to the Five Points Fort, still stands. The site is marked by a bust and an allusive plaque placed by the Archaeological Institute, History and Geography Pernambucano in 1917. The iconography of Brother Mug, the best-known work is the public \\"Execution Frei Caneca\\", by Murillo La Greca.

Legislator ;Opposition member B√©langer was first elected to the Quebec legislature in a by-election held in the Montreal division of Anjou on January 20, 1992. The seat had previously been held by the Quebec Liberal Party, and B√©langer's election was regarded as demonstrating increased support for Quebec sovereignty.Robert McKenzie, \\"By-election in Montreal seen as PQ bellwether,\\" Toronto Star, 20 January 1992, A9; Patricia Poirier, \\"Parti Quebecois wins by- election,\\" Globe and Mail, 21 January 1992, A2; \\"Win boosts PQ's hopes,\\" Kitchener-Waterloo Record, 21 January 1992, A1; Sandro Contenta, \\"PQ sweeps Montreal by-election,\\" Toronto Star, 21 January 1992, A9; Robert McKenzie, \\"By-election bodes ill for Quebec Liberals,\\" Toronto Star, 28 January 1992, A15.

The following year, he announced that the Bouchard government would appeal a Quebec Superior Court ruling that the province had no jurisdiction over acts committed by people based outside Quebec in the 1995 referendum on sovereignty.

It is commonly known as the feather duster worm, feather duster or fan worm.Introduced marine species of Hawaii It is native to tropical waters of the Indo-Pacific but has spread to other parts of the world. It is popular in aquariums because of its distinctive appearance and its ability to remove organic particles and improve water quality.Fan Worms & Feather Dusters (Annelids) Polychaetes, or marine bristle worms, have elongated bodies divided into many segments. Each segment may bear setae (bristles) and parapodia (paddle-like appendages). Some species live freely, either swimming, crawling or burrowing, and these are known as \\"errant\\". Others live permanently in tubes, either calcareous or parchment-like, and these are known as \\"sedentary\\". Taxonomy This worm has a complex taxonomic history. It was known as Sabellastarte sanctijosephi when it first appeared in Hawaii in the 20th century. The names S. punctata and S. indica were used by Hartman (1966) Hartman, O. 1966. Polychaetous annelids of the Hawaiian Islands. Occ. Pap. B.P. Bishop Mus. 33(11): 163‚Äì252. and others. In 2003 Knight-Jones and Mackie undertook a revision of the genus Sabellastarte and determined that Sabellastarte spectabilis was the correct name. Description This large worm can reach millimetres in length and in width. It is buff in colour with purple specks. It lives in a tough, leathery tube covered with fine mud. Projecting from this is a branchial crown of branched tentacles, the radioles, which form a plume. The tentacles are striped in dark and pale brown bands and bear neither stylodes nor eye spots. There are two long, slender palps and a four-lobed collar. Distribution The native range of S. spectabilis is the Indian Ocean and the Red Sea, but it is now also found on the coasts of Africa and Mozambique and the Gulf of Mexico. In 2002 it was reported on pilings, floating docks and harbour walls in Hawaii.USGS Habitat S. spectabilis is found in holes and cracks and among algae on reefs and rocky shores. It is sometimes found growing in crevices in the coral Pocillopora meandrina, under boulders in still water, in holes in lava, in tidal pools and in channels exposed to heavy surf. Biology S. spectabilis is a filter feeder. Cilia on the tentacles cause currents in the water and organic particles are caught as they float past. They are channelled along mucus-filled grooves to the mouth. Larger non-food particles are used for building the tube. The tentacles are also used as gills for gas exchange. This worm can reproduce asexually by fragmentation, and can regenerate body parts after being damaged. Reproduction can also be by sexual means. Most worms are either male or female and the gametes mature in the coelom before being released into the water column. Some specimens, particularly larger ones, have both male and female gametes and a study concluded that this was consistent with sequential hermaphroditism. Fertilization is external, and after a short time in the plankton, the trochophore larvae settle out and grow into adult worms.

So, every vote that a gay or lesbian can cast is referred to as the pink vote. Most prevalent in Britain, the concept has already spread to [US, where gays and lesbians are substantially more likely to vote democrat , and Canada with many other countries like South Africa and Australia starting to acknowledge it. The Pink Vote is now well-established across countries in Western Europe with gay and lesbian voters being notably more inclined to vote for social democratic parties over other right-wing parties and to be far more supportive of EU integration. In addition, there are socio-political movements and political groups formed by LGBT people who are linked to political parties. United Kingdom According to the Office for National Statistics (ONS), 1.00% of the total population in UK is homosexual and so, 480,000 people consider themselves gay or lesbian. Political parties in Britain now aim at the pink vote bank and leave no stone unturned to persuade the homosexual community to vote in their favour. The significance of pink vote has increased considerably with the changing times. Charles Kennedy of The Liberal Democrats pitched for the \\"pink vote\\" and even promised a package of ways to boost homosexual rights. United States According to the research report by Gallup, Americans interviewed estimated the gay population to be around one in every fifth person in the US which would account for almost 20% of the overall population, while actual numbers are estimated to be 10% or less. This percentage does play a big role in the elections and political parties try every way to attract these pink voters. LGBT Democrats (linked to the Democratic Party) and Log Cabin Republicans (linked to the Republican Party) are two of the largest American political groups advocated to LGBT rights issues in politics. Changing times With the visible impact of the pink vote in Britain, Canada‚Äôs political scenario also caught up with the pink vote politics. This new idea has also been a topic of debate in the Australia's political system. There are countries like South Africa where the pink vote is yet to acquire such importance and the homosexual community is yet to be given any added importance in elections. Recent polling of LGBT voters has revealed queer voting habits to be more complex than previously thought. In focus There have also been debates about the impact of pink votes and their existence in politics. In spite of such debates, fever of the pink vote even caught up Oscars as well.

On 29 July 2011, the members of AFC were informed that the legal committee was in agreement that an Extraordinary Congress for the election of President may be convened in the event that the office of President falls vacant for more than one year. This means that an Extraordinary Congress for this purpose could not be convened until after 30 May 2012 and Zhang will act as President until that date. In the end, Zhang indeed acted as the first executive chairman due to the suspension of Bin Hammam. He was also elected as a member of the FIFA Executive Committee. In September 2012, due to his age Zhang retired from his role as foreign affairs director at the State Sports General Administration, but continued to preside over the AFC in his capacity as Acting Chairman. In February 2013, Zhang Jilong announced that he would withdraw from the elections of the next AFC President and FIFA Executive Committee  2002 World Cup draw  Originally, for World Cup 2002 FIFA wanted to carry out the seeding of the teams by calculating and referencing to the match records from the previous three World Cups. However, on the day before the draw, the president of FIFA, Joseph \\"Sepp\\" Blatter, suddenly decided that instead of looking at the previous three records, the records from the previous two World Cups and the previous two Asia Cups will be used as a reference for the seeding. Because this new rule would work against the Chinese team, Zhang called the secretary of the Asia Football association, Veerapan, and asked to personally meet up with Blatter to discuss the proposed rule. Zhang asserted that \\"FIFA should not interfere with the internal affairs of the Asia Football association\\" and asked Blatter to take back the new rule. Veerapan accepted Zhang's proposal and announced that he would discuss the matter with Blatter. Finally, the draw for the games took place in Bangkok on June 1, 2001, and the draw followed the rules originally set by the Asia Football Association instead of the new proposed rule. As a result, the Chinese football team achieved a \\"lucky draw\\" and was seeded with the United Arab Emirates, Uzbekistan, Qatar, and Oman. China won first place in the group and successfully entered the finals of the game.

It also includes economic behaviour and laws as well as governmental policies that target or disportionately impact the economic status, occupations or behaviour of Jews. In some cases, stereotypes and canards have motivated economic behaviour and governmental actions that targeted or disportionately impacted Jewish people or families. In other cases, economic behaviour, laws and/or governmental policies have fed the propagation of those stereotypes and canards. Relationship to religious antisemitism Leon Poliakov writes that economic antisemitism is not a distinct form of antisemitism but merely a manifestation of theological antisemitism (without the theological causes of economic antisemitism, there would be no economic antisemitism). On the other hand, Derek Penslar contends that in the modern era, economic antisemitism is \\"distinct and nearly constant\\" but theological antisemitism is \\"often subdued\\". Stereotypes and canards A World War II- era Slovak propaganda poster exhorts readers not to \\"be a servant to the Jew\\". Derek Penslar describes modern economic antisemitism as a \\"double helix of intersecting paradigms, the first associating the Jew with paupers and savages and the second conceiving of Jews as conspirators, leaders of a financial cabal seeking global domination\\". Throughout history, stereotypes of Jews as being connected to greed, money-lending and usury have stoked anti-Jewish sentiments and still, to a large extent, influence the perception of Jews today. Reuveni and Wobick-segev suggest that we are still haunted by the image of \\"the mighty, greedy Jew\\". Allegations on the relationship of Jews and money have been characterised as underpinning the most damaging and lasting antisemitic canards. Antisemites have often promulgated myths related to money, such as the canard that Jews control the world finances, first promoted in the Protocols of the Elders of Zion, and later repeated by Henry Ford and his Dearborn Independent. Many such myths are still widespread in the Islamic world such as in books like The Secret Relationship Between Blacks and Jews, published by the Nation of Islam, as well as on the internet. Abraham Foxman cites examples of economic antisemitism found around the world, particularly in the United Kingdom, Germany, Argentina, and Spain. He also cites many modern instances of money-related antisemitism that are found on the Internet.Foxman, p. 164-175 Gerald Krefetz summarizes the myths as Jews \\"control the banks, the money supply, the economy, and businesses ‚Äì of the community, of the country, of the world\\".Krefetz, p. 45 He gives as illustrations many slurs and proverbs, in several different languages, suggesting that Jews are stingy, greedy, miserly, or aggressive bargainers.Krefetz, p. 6-7 Krefetz suggests that during the 19th century, most of the myths focused on Jews being \\"scurrilous, stupid, and tight-fisted\\", but after the Jewish Emancipation and the rise of Jews to the middle and upper classes in Europe the myths evolved and began to assert that Jews were \\"clever, devious, and manipulative financiers out to dominate\\" world finances.Krefetz, p. 47 Foxman describes six facets of canards used by proponents of economic antisemitism: #All Jews are wealthy.Foxman, p. 84 #Jews are stingy and greedy.Foxman, p. 89 #Powerful Jews control the business world.Foxman, p. 93 #Judaism emphasizes profit and materialismFoxman, p. 98 #Jews may cheat non-JewsFoxman, p. 102 #Jews use their power to benefit \\"their own kind.\\"Foxman, p. 105 =Statistics= The Anti Defamation League conducted a poll in Europe in 2007 that asked respondents if they agreed with the statement that \\"Jews have too much power in international financial markets\\". Polling data showed that respondents agreed with that statement as follows: 61% in Hungary, 43% in Austria, 40% in Switzerland, 40% in Belgium, 21% in the United Kingdom and 13% in the Netherlands. Another poll conducted by the ADL in 2009 found that 31% of Europeans surveyed blamed Jews for the global financial crisis that began in 2008. Motivations =Allegations of unethical business practices= William I. Brustein describes popular economic antisemitism in Europe before the 19th century as based on accusations of Jews using alleged unethical business practices in second-hand trade, petty commerce and money-lending. In the 17th and the 18th centuries, anecdotal remarks from Christian merchants and traders show that there were negative feelings towards Jewish business people, who were sometimes regarded as liars or cheats. Werner Sombart hypothesized that the perceptions of cheating or dishonesty were simply a manifestation of Christian frustration at innovative commercial practices of Jews, which were contrary to the customs and traditions of the Christian merchants but were otherwise ethical.Sombart, p. 118-120: :\\"Why were [Jews] able to become such keen competitors of the Christian traders? [‚Ä¶] Let us refer to contemporary opinion [of Christian merchants who made complaints in the 17th and 18th centuries, who unanimously said] the Jews were more successful because of their dishonest dealing. [Sombart quotes several merchants] 'Jews [‚Ä¶] have one law and custom [‚Ä¶] it is called lying and cheating [‚Ä¶] 'Jews are cheats' [‚Ä¶] '[Jews] make their living by robbing and cheating, which, in their opinion, are no crimes' [‚Ä¶] 'The Jews [‚Ä¶] are supposed not to be able to carry [business] on with strict honesty and trustworthiness'. What do these accusations amount to? Even if the term 'cheating' is to be given a very wide connotation, the commercial practices of many Jews hardly came within its scope. When it was asserted that Jews were cheats, that was only an epithet to describe the fact that Jews in their commercial dealings did not always pay regard to the existing laws or customs of trade. Jewish merchants offended in neglecting certain traditions of their Christian [peers], in (now and again) breaking the law, but above all, in paying no heed to commercial etiquette. [‚Ä¶] the conflict between Jewish and Christian merchants was a struggle between two outlooks, between two radically differing ‚Äì nay, opposite ‚Äì views on economic life\\". =Restrictions on occupations and professions= One form of economic antisemitism in the Middle Ages was a mass of legal restrictions imposed on the occupations and professions of Jews. Local rulers and church officials closed many professions to the Jews, pushing them into marginal occupations considered repugnant, such as tax- and rent-collecting and money-lending, but tolerated then as a \\"necessary evil\\". Catholic doctrine then held that lending money for interest was a sin and forbade it to Christians. Not being subject to that restriction, Jews dominated this business. The Torah and the later sections of the Hebrew Bible criticise usury, but interpretations of the Biblical prohibition vary. Since few other occupations were open to them, Jews were motivated to take up money-lending. That was said to show Jews were usurers, which then led to many negative stereotypes and propaganda. Natural tensions between creditors, typically Jews, and debtors, typically Christians were added to social, political, religious and economic strains. Peasants who were forced to pay their taxes to Jews could personify them as the people taking their earnings and remain loyal to the lords on whose behalf the Jews worked. Also present in the Middle Ages was the coercion of Jews into being economic objects, possessions and even slaves by groups of nobles, as is evident in examples from the English code Leges Edwardi Confessoris. Jews were pressed into various economic occupational roles and so became a people that could be coveted, sold or traded for economic purposes by those in power at the time. That use of Jews also had political causes and ramifications in the time period, but the economic practice of using Jews to fill particular roles in economic sectors was prevalent. =Occupational preferences= Throughout history, the economic status and occupations of Jews have been the subject of antisemitic stereotypes and canards. Some of the stereotypes and canards are based on economic and social restrictions placed on the Jews. Writing about 130, the Roman satirist Juvenal mockingly depicted Jews as grotesquely poor. Another aspect of economic antisemitism is the assertion that Jews do not produce anything of value but instead tend to serve as middlemen, acting as \\"parasites in the production line\\" of non-Jews, who are doing the real work. Krefetz lists middlemen occupations subject to that canard as distributors, shoppers, wholesalers, brokers, financiers, and retailers and writes that they are \\"all notably Jewish occupations\\".Krefetz, p. 70 Since the Middle Ages, Diaspora Jews have been characterised by a real or perceived \\"inverted occupational pyramid\\": they were perceived to be more prevalent in the tertiary sector, working in service jobs such as accounting, finance, medicine, law or commerce, than in the secondary and primary sectors.Perceptions that Jews are more prevalent in certain occupations or in the professions (medicine or law) have been the target of antisemitic sentiment at different periods in history. Jews have been the targets of antisemitic criticism for their occupational preferences. For example, Robert von Mohl characterised European Jews of the 19th century as being concentrated in trade and finance, with some representation in the artistic and intellectual fields. Perceptions of overrepresentation of Jews in certain occupations have driven antisemitic sentiment in the Soviet Union. There have been a number of theories for the reason for the \\"inverted occupational pyramid\\". Gerald Krefetz writes that the livelihood of Jews, particularly their business activities, has been influenced by religious, cultural, social and historical factors. Krefetz asserts that those factors have led to a predisposition for occupations marked by independence, professionalism and scholarship.Krefetz, p. 11 Jews have tended to show an \\"entrepreneurial spirit\\" and \\"capacity for risk-taking\\", which lead them to innovate financial concepts like negotiable instruments of credit, international syndicates, department stores, holding companies and investment banks.Krefetz, p. 12 Krefetz suggests that Jews have frequently chosen professions that are \\"portable\\" or involve duties as a middleman,l because of their long historical background, based on trading and \\"heightened awareness of continual persecution\\". In a similar vein, Foxman argues that many medieval Jews were especially well suited for commerce because the Jewish diaspora caused many Jews to have far-flung networks of friends and family, which facilitated trade:Foxman, p. 58: :\\"This [commerce] was a business to which the Jews were well suited for historical reasons [‚Ä¶] many Jews had friends and family members spread out over a large part of the then-known world, which became the basis of trading networks [‚Ä¶]\\" Zvi Eckstein and Maristella Botticini argue that widespread literacy and a focus on education are primary factors in Jewish occupational tendencies. During the first century, high priest Joshua ben Gamala made it mandatory for all young Jewish boys to get a primary education.http://www.bu.edu/econ/files/2012/11/dp124.pdf, 3 Mandatory primary education was not a common practice during this time and did not become so for the rest of the world till well over a millennium later.http://www.bu.edu/econ/files/2012/11/dp124.pdf, 11 Another factor in widespread literacy among Jews was the focus on study and interpretation of the Torah, Mishna, and Talmud. This led to the acquisition of basic literacy and argumentative skills. These cultural and religious developments caused many Jews to adopt a skill set that was well adept for urbanization and modernization. According to Werner Sombart, one complaint of Christian businesses was that Jews did not limit themselves to one particular trade or market but were often \\"jack of all trades\\" or \\"ubiquitous\\" and \\"paid no heed to the demarcation of all economic activities into separate categories\\".Sombart p. 134 When Jews entered trades or business areas in Europe, that frequently resulted in complaints from Christian competitors that the Jews were depriving them of customers and profit.Sombart p. 116 Sombart, analysing 17th- and 18th-century Christian views of Jewish merchants, concluded that Jewish merchants were considered to pursue profit blatantly, openly and aggressively in contrast to the Christian approach, which was willing to seek profit but viewed the aggressive pursuit of profit as unseemly, uncivilized and uncouth.Sombart p. 133 Sombart also asserts another cause of Christian frustration with Jewish businesses, who imported raw materials, which was considered inappropriate by Christian merchants.Sombart p. 136 =Jealousy= Niewyk and Nicosia describe economic antisemitism as focusing on \\"excessive\\" Jewish wealth and power growing out of the Jews' success in commerce, banking and professional careers. Marvin Perry asserts that much antisemitism in the European commercial world derived from the fact that non-Jewish merchants could not match the \\"economies of scale and advertising promotions\\" of Jewish competitors.Perry p. 141 Mark Twain (Samuel Clemens) wrote, \\"I am persuaded that in Russia, Austria, and Germany nine- tenths of the hostility to the Jew comes from the average Christian's inability to compete success fully with the average Jew in business in either straight business or the questionable sort\\".Twain, Mark, \\"Concerning the Jews\\", Harper's Magazine, March 1898. Twain is quoted in Perry, p. 119 Similarly, Foxman writes that it is likely that non-Jews in medieval or Renaissance Europe had feelings of fear, vulnerability and hostility towards Jews because they resented being beholden to Jewish lenders.Foxman, p. 65 He claims that money-based antisemitism is a result of resentment and jealousy of Jews.Foxman, p. 81 Krefetz also makes a similar point: the ability of Jews to make money occasionally stirs jealousy and hate in non-Jews, contributing to a fear that Jews will \\"ascend too high\\" in the economic sphere and begin to manipulate and control world finances.Krefetz p. 31 Krefetz asserts that US antisemitism seems \\"rooted less in religion or contempt and more in envy, jealously and fear\\" of Jewish affluence and of the hidden power of \\"Jewish money\\".Krefetz, 1985 However, Dennis Prager and Joseph Telushkin offer a different perspective. Addressing the premise that \\"the Jews' disproportionate wealth and concentration in business and in the professions is said to provoke anti-Jewish hostility\\", they assert that \\"while economic factors can and often do exacerbate antisemitism, [‚Ä¶] economic factors do not cause Jew-hatred; they only provide opportunities for it to be expressed\\". As one of the arguments supporting their thesis, Prager and Telushkin point out, \\"Jews have often suffered the worst antisemitism when they were poor, as was true with the overwhelming majority of Jews in [‚Ä¶] Poland and Russia, and have encountered the least amount of antisemitism when affluent as in the United States and Canada today\\". =Anti-mercantilism= Penslar characterised economic antisemitism as \\"an extreme form of the antimercantile sentiments that are rooted in pagan antiquity and the early Christian tradition\\". =Blame for the ills of capitalism= In the 19th century, Jews came to be so closely associated with capitalism that some even viewed the Jews as the \\"creators of capitalism\\".Krefetz, pp. 41-44 According to Muller, those who embraced capitalism tended to be sympathetic to Jews, and those who rejected capitalism tended to be hostile to Jews.Muller, p. 12 Karl Marx Richard Levy writes that although there were local variations, most modern economic antisemitism is defined by \\"the scapegoating of Jews for capitalism's ills\\". Similarly, Steven Beller writes that economic antisemitism at the turn of the 20th century was \\"based on fear and envy at the supposed stranglehold of 'the Jews' over finance and accused Jews of being behind the depredations of capitalism on the traditional economy\\". Laurel Platt attributes antisemitic attitudes that extend back to the Middle Ages for the tendency to blame Jews for the problems of capitalism and urbanisation that arose in the late 19th century. Scholars have noted the antisemitic attitudes of mid-19th-century French socialists such as Charles Fourier and Pierre-Joseph Proudhon. Fourier vilified the Jews as the \\"incarnation of commerce: parasitical, deceitful, traitorous and unproductive\\". Proudhon used even more vehement invective, attacking Jews as the \\"incarnation of finance capitalism\\" and characterizing them as anti- producers by temperament. Alphonse Toussenel, a follower of Fourier, wrote finance, meaning the Jews, was dominating and ruining France. Similarly, Auguste Blanqui commented in his correspondence on Jews as being usurers and \\"Shylocks\\". Karl Marx, himself from a Jewish background, argued that earning a living from collecting interest or acting as a middleman was an unjust and exploitive aspect of capitalism.Perry, pp. 153-156 Because many Jews were employed in occupations that Marx considered \\"non-productive\\", he singled out Jews for particular criticism and blamed Judaism for the exploitation and alienation of workers.Perry, pp. 153-6 Moses Mendelssohn argued to the contrary that commercial activity was just as valid and beneficial as manual labour: \\"Many a merchant, while quietly engaged at his desk in forming commercial speculations, [‚Ä¶] produces [‚Ä¶] more than the most active and noisy mechanic or tradesman\\".Muller, p. 112, quotes from Moses Mendelssohn, \\"Response to Dohm\\" (1782), in Mendes-Flohr, Jews in the Modern World, Oxford University Press US, 1995, p. 46 Penslar wrote that Marx argued not that Jews merely embraced capitalism but that they \\"embodied\\" it. Penslar stated that Marx claimed that the Jewish religious culture shared many key characteristics of capitalism, such as materialism and egoism. Marx concluded that Judaism was responsible for the alienation of many workers. That idea became a component of his theory of communism. Marx viewed Judaism as a commercial practice, not a theology.Perry, p. 156: :\\"Because of Judaism, money has become [quoting Marx] 'the essence of man's life and work, which have become alienated from him. This alien monster rules him and he worships it [‚Ä¶] Only then [under the rule of Judaized Christianity] could Jewry become universally dominant and turn alienated man and alienated nature into alienable, salable objects, subject to the serfdom of egotistical needs and to usury. Sale is the practice of alienation'. Jews are the embodiment of capitalism (money-system) in action and the creators of all its evil consequences for humanity. Judaism is not a theology but the commercial and industrial practice of a money-system.\\" According to Perry, Marx believed that \\"Jews are the embodiment of capitalism (money-system) in action and the creators of all its evil consequences for humanity\\".Perry, p. 156 Marx's views were shared by Bruno Bauer, who claimed that the essence of Judaism was egotism and materialism. Marx claimed that money was the Jewish worldly god.Muller, p. 36Perry p. 153-155: :\\"[Marx believes] that Jews lack a sense of 'higher values', are materialistic and thus are devoted only to material survival [‚Ä¶] [Bruno] Bauer and Marx [‚Ä¶] make egoism the essence of Judaism and who denounced Judaism of imparting a loathsome lust for gain to Christianity [‚Ä¶]. In his essay 'On the Jewish Question' published in 1844, Marx saw zeal for money as the essential feature of historic Judaism and the Jew of his day: '[‚Ä¶]What is the Jew's foundation in our world? Material necessity, private advantage. What is the object of the Jew's worship in this world? Usury/huckstering. What is his worldly god? Money?'.\\" Several commentators note that economic antisemitism increases in times of recession or economic hardship, such as during the Depression of 1873.Perry, p. 145Krefetz, p. 33Foxman, p. 38Geisst, Charles R., Wheels of Fortune: The History of Speculation from Scandal to Respectability, John Wiley and Sons, 2003, pp. 66-68 =Identification of Jews as socialists or communists= Jewish Bolshevism is an antisemitic canardKrzysztof Szwagrzyk, ≈ªydzi w kierownictwie UB. Stereotyp czy rzeczywisto≈õƒá?, Biuletyn IPN (11/2005), p. 37-42 that is based on the claim that Jews have been the driving force behind or are disproportionately involved in communism, sometimes more specifically Russian Bolshevism.Alderman, G. (1983): The Jewish Community in British Politics. Clarendon Press, Oxford. The expression was the title of a pamphlet, The Jewish Bolshevism, and became current after the 1917 October Revolution in Russia, featuring prominently in the propaganda of the anti- Bolshevik \\"White\\" forces during the Russian Civil War. That idea spread worldwide in the 1920s with the publication and circulation of The Protocols of the Elders of Zion. That was popularised by the Jewish ancestry of many leading Bolsheviks, most notably Leon Trotsky, during and after the October Revolution. Daniel Pipes says that \\"primarily through the Protocols of the Elders of Zion, the Whites spread these charges to an international audience\\".Pipes, Daniel (1997): Conspiracy: How the Paranoid Style Flourishes and Where It Comes From (The Free Press ‚Äì Simon & Schuster), p. 93. James Webb wrote that it is rare to find an antisemitic source after 1917 that \\"does not stand in debt to the White Russian analysis of the Revolution\\".Webb, James (1976): Occult Establishment: The Dawn of the New Age and The Occult Establishment, (Open Court Publishing), p.295. The label \\"Judeo-Bolshevism\\" was used in Nazi Germany to equate Jews with communists, implying that the communism served Jewish interests and/or that all Jews were communists.Laqueur, Walter (1965): Russia and Germany (Boston: Little, Brown and Company) Jews and Communists were both blamed for having allegedly betrayed Germany during World War I and resulting in Germany signing The Treaty of Versailles, in what is known as the \\"stab-in-the-back myth\\". In Poland before World War II, ≈ªydokomuna was used in the same way to allege that Jews were conspiring with the Soviet Union to invade Poland. According to Andr√© Gerrits, \\"The myth of Jewish Communism was one of the most popular and widespread political prejudices in the first half of the 20th century, in Eastern Europe in particular\\". The allegation still sees use in antisemitic publications and websites today. Historical development Jerome Chanes identifies six stages in the historical development of antisemitism: #Pre- Christian anti-Judaism in ancient Greece and Rome, which was primarily ethnic in nature #Christian anti-semitism in antiquity and the Middle Ages, which was religious in nature and has extended into modern times #Traditional Muslim antisemitism, which was, at least in its classical form, nuanced in that Jews were a protected class #Political, social and economic antisemitism of Enlightenment and post-Enlightenment Europe, which laid the groundwork for racial antisemitism #Racial antisemitism, which arose in the 19th century and culminated in Nazism #Contemporary antisemitism, which has been labelled by some as the New Antisemitism =Middle Ages= According to Norman Roth, \\"far more attention has [been] focused on Jewish moneylending than on any other occupation\\". He asserts that general histories of the medieval period, if they mention Jews at all, refer to them as moneylenders or as being involved in the slave trade. He asserts that there is not a great abundance of research on commercial activity of Jews in the Middle East. He accuses scholars of making \\"sweeping generalizations that would be \\"laughable and unthinkable in any other context\\". Throughout the Middle Ages, Jews were subjected to a wide range of legal disabilities and restrictions, some of which lasted until the end of the 19th century. At times, even moneylending and peddling were forbidden to them. The number of Jews permitted to reside in different places was limited. They were concentrated in ghettos were not allowed to own land, they were subject to discriminatory taxes on entering cities or districts other than their own, they were forced to swear special Jewish Oaths and they suffered a variety of other measures. The exclusion of Jews from many trades and craft guilds began after the First Crusade (1096‚Äì1099). The exclusion often came at the urging of the clergy, local guild members, state and local governments.Sachar Jews were excluded in certain places from certain crafts as they were excluded by the craft guilds in certain trades and, indirectly, agriculture by bans on land-ownership. That often led Jews into peddling, second-hand goods, pawnbroking and moneylending.Perry, p. 125Foxman, p. 57-8: :\\"[‚Ä¶] the gradual exclusions, beginning in medieval times, of Jews from most traditional professions. By the 13th century Jews were forbidden to own land in virtually all of Europe, which meant, in practice, that they were forbidden to take part in agriculture (which had been their chief occupation in Biblical times). They were also increasingly barred from participation in crafts and manufacturing [‚Ä¶] These restrictions left only a handful of occupations in which Jews could earn a living [‚Ä¶] One of these was commerce ‚Äì the buying and selling of goods [‚Ä¶]\\" In Southern Europe, Christian competitors of Jews in several occupations, including moneylending, asked leaders to expel Jews to reduce competition. The result of those occupational restrictions was to push Jews into marginal roles, considered socially inferior, such as tax and rent collecting and moneylending, which were tolerated as a \\"necessary evil\\". Although Jews had not been particularly associated with moneylending in antiquity, a stereotype of them doing so was developed beginning in the 11th century. Jonathan Frankel notes that the stereotype, though obviously an exaggeration, had a solid basis in reality. While not all Jews were moneylenders, Jews were probably disproportionately represented in that trade. Catholic doctrine then held that lending money for interest was a sin and so was an occupation forbidden to Christians. Not being subject to the restriction, Jews made that business their own despite possible criticism of usury in the Torah and later sections of the Hebrew Bible. Unfortunately, that led to many negative stereotypes of Jews as insolent, greedy usurers, and the understandable tensions between creditors, typically Jews, and debtors, typically Christians, added to social, political, religious and economic strains. Peasants who were forced to pay their taxes to Jews could see them as personally taking their money while they were unaware of those on whose behalf those Jews worked. Howard Sachar wrote that the occupations that were left for Jews to engage in were often the occupations that Christians disdained, such as peddling, hawking and moneylending. He estimated that three fourths of Jews in Central and Western Europe were occupied in those occupations in the 18th century. Sachar stated, \\"In their [Jews'] struggle for livelihood, they generated a sizable underclass of beggars, fencers, pimps, even robbers, thereby creating a self-fulfilling gentile scenario of Jews, one that would endlessly invoked by Jew-haters throughout the late eighteenth and nineteenth centuries\\". Similarly, Todeschini wrote that the perception of Jews as dishonest and immoral became a self-fulfilling prophecy because the exclusion from other professions forced them to engage in moneylending and other marginal professions that were regarded as unethical.Todeschini, p. 111 One of the reasons that moneylending was open to Jews as a profession was that European Christian culture regarded moneylending as sinful or immoral. That caused Christians to avoid the profession, leaving a vacuum for which Jews could fill. The Christian abhorrence of moneylending was rooted in the Old Testament laws of , , and .Foxman p. 59 Those biblical rules were emphasized in the Middle Ages again in the Lateran councils,Perry, p. 123 particularly the Second Lateran Council in 1139, and the Fourth Lateran Council in 1215, but proclamations of the Catholic Church outlawed excessively-high interest rates, not all interest. Max Dimont asserts that moneylending, of all professions, was the \\"most reviled\\". The occupation of moneylending was considered a \\"degenerate\\" profession in the 14th century by many Christians, including Franciscans in England such as John Peckham, who engaged in discussions of usury and debt.Todeschini, p. 111: :\\"[Archbishop of Canterbury] John Peckham's [14th century] treatise is a very interesting segment of the complex Franciscan ethical-economic structure. The text is explicitly about the connection existing for the Franciscan writer between Jews and usury: the Jews are generally usurarii manifeti and it can be presumed that all their wealth would have originated from lending on interest. This statement, a heritage of the twelfth-century polemic, is now becoming [in the 14th century] a paradox: Jews must be compelled to do honest labor, but all the jobs that could associate them with Christians ‚Äì surgery, commerce, domestic service ‚Äì are prohibited. The result is that the degenerate business, usury, is proscribed but remains the only practicable one for Jews [‚Ä¶] It is very important to understand that in John Peckham's response [‚Ä¶] just as in the Summa astesana, usury becomes, more than a standard vicious economic contract, the sign of the economic activity of Jews as infidels, and at the same time their unique, as well as forbidden, possibility of earning and living [‚Ä¶]\\" One reason that Christians permitted Jews to engage in moneylending, despite it being considered a sinful activity, was that Jews were already considered to be damned and so they may as well commit the sin of usury, thus saving the souls of Christians who would otherwise be forced to lend money.Dimont, p. 269Dimont, p. 269: :\\"Why were Jews the only ones engaged in this moneylending? [‚Ä¶] The answers hinge on a definition. The Church called the lending of money not 'banking' but 'usury'. To modern man, 'usury' means the lending of money at exorbitant rates, in medieval times it simply meant the lending of money at interest, no matter how low [‚Ä¶] How then could it [the Church] permit Christians to lend money if that meant that their souls would go to hell? With Jews it was another story. As the Jews were not Christians and in the eyes of the Church were headed for hell anyhow, one more sin ‚Äì that is, moneylending ‚Äì could not add much to the punishment they would receive in the hereafter. One could suggest that the Church keep the Jews as 'bankers' in the same way Jews kept Christians as 'Sabbath-goys' to perform functions for them which they were not allowed to perform for themselves\\". Moneylending became an important occupation for Jews, beginning in the early Middle Ages, and continuing into the modern era. Moneylending was first noted as a significant occupation in the 9th century, and in the 10th century, some Jews were large scale financiers.Kahan, p. 257 That prevalence in the field of moneylending has led to scholarly debate, which considered why Jews gravitated towards money- related occupations. Dimont writes that the Jewish role in moneylending was the most important contribution of Jews to medieval society since the feudal culture might have failed without a flow of capital.Dimont, p. 268 Foxman writes that the moneylending profession gave rise to the modern financial industries, including banking. Over time, Jews became very skilled at both commerce and moneylending.Foxman, p. 58 Some European leaders encouraged Jews to engage in moneylending because it enhanced economic activity and provided personal benefit to the leaders themselves. In addition, leaders benefited from Jewish moneylenders by collecting fees and taxes.Perry, p. 126 Throughout Europe, Jews filled the role of Court Jew for virtually every seat of nobility. However, some European leaders expelled Jews from their countries (England 1290, France 1306 and 1394), depriving themselves of the economic benefits provided by the moneylenders. Although most scholars attribute the large number of Jews in the moneylending occupation to the exclusion from other crafts and trades, Werner Sombart, in his The Jews and Modern Capitalism, asserted that moneylending was an occupation that many Jews preferred and chose.Sombart, p. 300-301 As evidence, he pointed out his book that Jews had heavily been engaged in moneylending before the era when they were excluded from trades and crafts and also that Jews' religion and culture predisposed them to commercial and financial endeavours.Sombart, pp. 309-310 Because Sombart speculated on anthropological and racial explanations, his work has been described as antisemitic and racist.Perry, p. 158-163 However, some modern scholars characterise his presentation of the topic as sympathetic and valid.Dimont, p. 263Krefetz, p. 42. Krefetz called Sombart's ideas \\"philo- Semitic\\" and wrote, \\"Sombart put the Jewish contribution to finance and business development in a new light [extending Marx and Weber]. It was the first generally positive statement about Jews and money for hundreds of years- and the first in the 20th century\\". Sombart's work was a watershed in the scholarship of Jewish culture because it prompted subsequent historians and economists to begin to examine the relationship between Jews and money. Sombart contends that many of the trade and craft prohibitions were rarely enforced and so Jews could have found employment in many of the proscribed occupations if they had desired. However, Sombart writes that Jews were absolutely excluded from government jobs, that exclusion being more significant than the putative trade exclusions. He also suggests that exclusion from government jobs had some incidental benefits for Jews because it freed them from problems associated with political partisanship.Sombart, pp. 177-8 =Early modern period= Penslar asserted that the \\"more fantastic aspects of medieval antisemitism, which include the demonization of Jews, and accusations of ritual murder and black magic were (incompletely) suppressed, to some extent, by the combined forces of Protestantism and the modern state\\", but economic antisemitism did not share the same fate because \\"it has fit as well into a rationalized worldview as a magical one, into a secular sensibility as a theological one\\". According to Perry and Schweitzer, \\"Jewish economic endeavors labored under the stigma, variously, of being 'unproductive', sterile, parasitic, usurious, dangerous, dishonest, criminal and the like\\". =19th-century Europe= Prior to around 1820 in Europe, most Jews were peddlers and shopkeepers, but after the Jewish emancipation, in the 19th century, Jews were able to migrate to the middle and upper classes and to engage in a wider variety of occupations.Perry, p. 139 In 1859, the Austrian Empire had guilds abolished, which was an opportunity for Jews to enter \\"liberal professions\\" such as law, journalism and medicine.Perry, p. 136 In the mid-19th century, a number of German Jews founded investment banking firms, which later became mainstays of the industry. Most prominent Jewish banks in the US were investment banks, rather than commercial banks. Jonathan Knee postulates that Jews were forced to focus on the development of investment banks because they were excluded from the commercial banking sector. After legislation supporting the equality of French Jews with other citizens during the French Revolution, similar laws promoting Jewish emancipation were enacted in the early 19th century in parts of Europe over which France had influence.Paul Webster (2001)Petain's Crime. London, Pan Books: 13, 15Dan Cohn-Sherbok (2006) The Paradox of Anti-Semitism. Continuum: 44-46 The old laws restricting them to ghettos and the many laws that limited their rights to property, worship and occupation were rescinded. Despite the lifting of official economic restrictions against Jews throughout Europe, economic stereotypes and unofficial or semiofficial restrictions on the economic activity of Jews continued. Bernard Lazare commented, \\"Economic antisemitism to-day is stronger than it ever was, for the reason that to-day, more than ever, the Jew appears powerful and rich. Formerly he was not seen: he remained hidden in his Ghetto, far from Christian eyes. He had but one care, to conceal his wealth, that wealth of which tradition regarded him as the gatherer, and not the proprietor. The day he was freed from his disabilities, the day the restrictions put to his activities fell away, the Jew showed himself in public\\". Howard Sachar wrote that throughout much of the 19th century, popular literature and theatrical performances in the Austrian and German empires were merciless in their caricatures of the Rothschilds as \\"Jewish cash bags\\" or \\"Jews behind the throne\\". Those caricatures evolved from mere political satire to more-overt antisemitism in the early 20th century. Sachar noted the irony that Jewish proponents of communism, such as Marx, were partially responsible for antisemitism targeting the relationship between Jews and capitalism. One example of economic antisemitism was promulgated in France by √âdouard Drumont in his 1879 pamphlet What we Demand of Modern Jewry that contrasted the poverty of French workers with the wealth of Jewish bankers and industrialists.Mendes-Flohr, Paul R,The Jew in the modern world: a documentary history , Oxford University Press US, 1995, p. 340 =19th-century United States= By the time of the American Civil War, tensions over race and immigration and economic competition between Jews and non-Jews combined to produce the worst American outbreak of anti-Semitism until then. Americans on both sides of the slavery issue denounced Jews as disloyal war profiteers and accused them of driving Christians out of business and aiding and abetting the enemy. Major General Ulysses S. Grant was influenced by such sentiments and issued General Order No. 11, expelling Jews from areas under his control in western Tennessee: > The Jews, as a class violating every regulation of trade established by the > Treasury Department and also department orders, are hereby expelled [‚Ä¶] > within twenty-four hours from the receipt of this order. That order was quickly rescinded by President Abraham Lincoln, but it already been enforced in a number of towns. According to Jerome Chanes, Lincoln's revocation of Grant's order was based primarily on \\"constitutional strictures against [‚Ä¶] the federal government singling out any group for special treatment\\". Chanes characterised the order as \\"unique in the history of the United States\\" because it was the only overtly-antisemitic official action of the US government. Grant later issued an order \\"that no Jews are to be permitted to travel on the road southward\\". His aide, Colonel John V. DuBois, ordered \\"all cotton speculators, Jews, and all vagabonds with no honest means of support\\" to leave the district. \\"The Israelites especially should be kept out‚Ä¶ they are such an intolerable nuisance\\". From the early 1880s, declining farm prices also prompted elements of the Populist movement to blame the perceived evils of capitalism and industrialism on Jews because of their alleged racial/religious inclination for financial exploitation. More specifically, they alleged financial manipulations by Jewish financiers such as the Rothschilds. Although Jews played only a minor role in the nation's commercial banking system, the prominence of Jewish investment bankers, such as the Rothschilds in Europe, Jacob Schiff, and Kuhn, Loeb & Co. in New York City, made the claims of anti-Semites believable to some. In the 1890s, Mary Elizabeth Lease, an American farming activist and populist from Kansas, frequently blamed the Rothschilds and \\"British bankers\\" for farmers' ills.Levitas, pp. 187-88 The Morgan Bonds scandal injected populist anti- Semitism into the 1896 presidential campaign. It was disclosed that President Grover Cleveland had sold bonds to a syndicate that included J. P. Morgan and the Rothschilds. The syndicate was now selling the bonds for a profit, and the Populists used that as an opportunity to uphold their view of history that both Washington, DC, and Wall Street were in the hands of international Jewish banking houses. Another focus of anti-Semitism was the allegation that Jews were at the middle of an international conspiracy to fix the currency, and thus the economy, to a single gold standard. =The Protocols of the Elders of Zion= Protocols of the Elders of Zion The Protocols of the Elders of Zion, an antisemitic text, purported to describe a Jewish plan to achieve global domination and to document the minutes of a late-19th-century meeting attended by world Jewish leaders, the \\"Elders of Zion\\", conspiring to take over the world. The fraudulent Protocols included plans to subvert the morals of the non-Jewish world, to control the world's economies by Jewish bankers, to have the press in Jewish control of the press and ultimately destroy civilisation. The document of 24 \\"protocols\\" was analysed by Steven Jacobs and Mark Weitzman, who documented several protocols that suggested that Jews would employ control of the worlds banking system to dominate the world. Those that focus on economic issues are 2, 3, 4, 21 and 22.Korey, William, Russian antisemitism, Pamyat, and the demonology of Zionism, Psychology Press, 1995, p. 4Krefetz, pp. 47-8 =Henry Ford and the Dearborn Independent= Dearborn Independent Henry Ford was a non-interventionist who opposed both world wars and believed that Jews were responsible for starting wars to profit from them: \\"International financiers are behind all war. They are what is called the international Jew: German Jews, French Jews, English Jews, American Jews. I believe that in all those countries except our own the Jewish financier is supreme [‚Ä¶] here the Jew is a threat\\".Perry p. 168-9. Perry quotes Ford. Ford also shared Marx's view that Jews were responsible for capitalism. He believed that in their role as financiers, they did not contribute anything of value to society.Perry p. 168-9 In 1915, during World War I, Ford blamed Jews for instigating the war: \\"I know who caused the war: German-Jewish bankers\\". In 1925, Ford said, \\"What I oppose most is the international Jewish money power that is met in every war. That is what I oppose ‚Äì a power that has no country and that can order the young men of all countries out to death\\". According to Steven Watts, Ford's antisemitism was partially caused by a desire for world peace.Baldwin, Neil, Henry Ford and the Jews: the mass production of hate, Public Affairs, 2002, p. 59 Ford became aware of The Protocols of the Elders of Zion. Believing them to be legitimate document, he published portions of it in his newspaper, The Dearborn Independent. From 1920 to 1921, the Dearborn Independent also carried a series of articles expanding on the themes of financial control by Jews.Jewish influence in the Federal Reserve System, reprinted from the Dearborn independent, Dearborn Pub. Co., 1921 One of the articles, \\"Jewish Power and America's Money Famine\\", asserted that the power exercised by Jews over the nation's supply of money was insidious by helping deprive farmers and others outside the banking coterie of money when they needed it most. The article asked, \\"Where is the American gold supply? [‚Ä¶] It may be in the United States but it does not belong to the United States\\". It drew the conclusion that Jews controlled the gold supply and thus American money. Another of the articles, \\"Jewish Idea Molded Federal Reserve System\\", was a reflection of Ford's suspicion of the Federal Reserve System and its proponent, Paul Warburg. Ford believed that the Federal Reserve was secretive and insidious. Those articles gave rise to claims of antisemitism against Ford,Foxman, pp. 69-72 and in 1929, he signed a statement apologising for the articles.Baldwin, Neil, Henry Ford and the Jews: the mass production of hate, PublicAffairs, 2002, pp. 213-218 =Nazi Germany= Mein Kampf by Adolf Hitler Nuremberg Race Laws Antisemitism and the persecution of Jews represented a central tenet of Nazism. In its 25-point Party Program, published in 1920, Nazi Party members publicly declared their intention to segregate Jews from \\"Aryan\\" society and to abrogate Jews' political, legal and civil rights. Nazi leaders began to carry out their pledge to persecute German Jews soon after their assumption of power. Adolf Hitler rose to power in Germany during a time of economic depression. Hitler blamed Jews for Germany's economic woes. Hitler's book Mein Kampf (German for \\"My Struggle\\") included the following passage, which was representative of much antisemitism in Germany and Europe: \\"The Jewish train of thought in all this is clear. The Bolshevization of Germany ‚Äì that is, the extermination of the national v√∂lkisch German intelligentsia to make possible the sweating of the German working class under the yoke of Jewish world finance ‚Äì is conceived only as a preliminary to the further extension of this Jewish tendency of world conquest [‚Ä¶] If our people and our state become the victim of these blood-thirsty and avaricious Jewish tyrants of nations, the whole earth will sink into the snares of this octopus\\". *James, Pierre, The murderous paradise: German nationalism and the Holocaust, Greenwood Publishing Group, 2001 *English translation from: Downs, Robert B, Books that changed the world, p. 321 From 1933, repressive laws were passed against Jews, culminating in the Nuremberg Laws, which removed most of the rights of citizenship from Jews by using a racial definition based on descent, rather than any religious definition of who was a Jew. Sporadic violence against the Jews became widespread with the Kristallnacht riots, which targeted Jewish homes, businesses and places of worship, killing hundreds across Germany, including the newly-annexed Austria. The ideologically-antisemitic agenda of that culminated in the genocide of the Jews of Europe, known as the Holocaust. The first major law to curtail the rights of Jewish German citizens was the Law for the Restoration of the Professional Civil Service on April 7, 1933. Those who were Jewish or \\"politically unreliable\\" were now excluded from state service. That was the German authorities' first formulation of the so-called Aryan Paragraph, which excluded Jews (and often other \\"non-Aryans\\") from organizations, professions, and other aspects of public life. In April 1933, German law restricted the number of Jewish students at German schools and universities. In the same month, further legislation sharply curtailed \\"Jewish activity\\" in the medical and legal professions. Subsequent laws and decrees restricted reimbursement of Jewish doctors from state health insurance funds. On April 1, 1933, Jewish doctors, shops, lawyers and stores were boycotted. Only six days later, the Law for the Restoration of the Professional Civil Service was passed, banning Jews from being employed in government. Jews were now indirectly and directly dissuaded or banned from privileged and upper-level positions reserved for \\"Aryan\\" Germans. From then on, Jews were forced to work at more-menial positions, beneath non-Jews. In 1936, Jews were banned from all professional jobs, effectively preventing them from exerting any influence in education, politics, higher education and industry. There was no longer to stop the anti- Jewish actions that spread across the German economy. In 1937 and 1938, German authorities again stepped up legislative persecution of German Jews. The government set out to impoverish Jews and remove them from the German economy by requiring them to register their property. Even before the Olympics, the Nazi government had initiated \\"Aryanization\\", the dismissal of Jewish workers and managers of a company and/or the takeover of Jewish-owned businesses by non-Jewish Germans, who bought them at bargain prices, fixed by government or Nazi party officials. On March 1, 1938, government contracts could no longer be awarded to Jewish businesses. On September 30, the government forbade Jewish doctors to treat non-Jews, and it revoked the licences of Jewish lawyers. After the Kristallnacht (commonly known as \\"Night of Broken Glass\\") pogrom of November 9‚Äì10, 1938, Nazi leaders stepped up \\"Aryanization\\" efforts and enforced measures that increasingly succeeded in physically isolating and segregating Jews from their fellow Germans. Jews were barred from all public schools and universities as well as from cinemas, theatres and sports facilities. In many cities, Jews were forbidden to enter designated \\"Aryan\\" zones. German decrees and ordinances expanded the ban on Jews in professional life. By September 1938, for instance, Jewish physicians were effectively banned from treating \\"Aryan\\" patients. By April 1939, nearly all Jewish companies had either collapsed under financial pressure and declining profits or had been forced to sell out to the Nazi German government. That further reduced Jews' rights as human beings, and they were in many ways officially separated from the German populace. =Occupied Europe= Antisemitism was particularly virulent in Vichy France during World War II. The antisemitic demands of right-wing groups were implemented under the collaborating Vichy regime of Marshal Philippe P√©tain after the defeat of the French by the German army in 1940. A law on the status of Jews that year, followed by one in 1941, purged Jews from employment in administrative, civil service and judicial posts; most professions and even from the entertainment industry, restricting most of them to menial jobs. =Soviet Union= William Korey describes a 1977 Academy of Sciences of the USSR report, International Zionism: History and Politics, alleging that \\"Jewish bourgeoisie\\", using Zionism as a cover, sought \\"the expansion of their positions in the economy of the largest capitalist states [‚Ä¶] and in the economic system of world capitalism as a whole\\".Korey, pp. 56-57. The quotes are from the report, as quoted by Korey. The report specifically mentioned six Wall Street investment firms: Lazard Brothers, Lehman Brothers, Kuhn, Loeb & Co., Loeb Rhoades, Bache & Co. and Goldman- Sachs. The report also expounded on the \\"clannish\\" theory that Jewish financial firms around the world were related by family-ties and collaborated unethically.Korey, pp. 56-57 =20th-century United States= In 1922, educational discrimination became a national issue when Harvard College announced that it was considering a quota system for Jewish students. Although it was eventually dropped, the quota was enforced in many colleges by underhanded techniques. As late as 1945, Dartmouth openly admitted and defended a quota system against Jewish students. To limit the growing number of Jewish students, a number of private liberal arts universities and medical and dental schools instituted a quota system referred to as numerus clausus. Those included Harvard University, Columbia University, Cornell University,l and Boston University. In 1925, Yale University, which already had such admissions preferences as \\"character\\", \\"solidity\\" and \\"physical characteristics\\", added a program of legacy preference admission spots for children of Yale alumni in an explicit attempt to put the brakes on the rising percentage of Jews in the student body. That was soon copied by other Ivy League and other schools, and admissions of Jews were kept down to 10% until the 1950s. Such policies were for the most part discarded during the early 1960s, but the last vestiges were not eliminated at Yale University until 1970. Jews encountered resistance when they tried to move into white-collar and professional positions. Banking, insurance, public utilities, medical schools, hospitals, large law firms and faculty positions restricted the entrance of Jews. That era of \\"polite\\" antisemitism by social discrimination underwent an ideological escalation in the 1930s. =Federal Reserve System= The Anti-Defamation League documented one of the more common aspects of money- related antisemitism: the claim that the United States' Federal Reserve System was created by Jews and is run by them for their own financial benefit. The ADL gives examples of that myth repeated by Aryan Nations, Louis Farrakhan, Sheldon Emry and Wickliffe Vennard. Another example cited is Bo Gritz, the 1992 Presidential candidate of the Populist Party, in his book Called to Serve.ADL Report Foxman rebuts the Federal Reserve myth, in his book Jews and Money, by explaining that the Federal Reserve is a quasi-public entity that was created and is controlled by the US Congress.Foxman, p. 138 =Islamic world= Various incarnations of money-related antisemitism have been documented in the Islamic world. In a 1968 conference at the University of Cairo, a speaker proclaimed that \\"money-worship [is among the] inherent qualities in them [the Jews] [‚Ä¶] They are characterized by avarice and many other vices, which arose from selfishness, love of worldly life, and envy [‚Ä¶]\\"Foxman, pp. 118-9 Arabs' discourse on the Holocaust displays various instances of economic antisemitic rhetoric. One such example is Shaykh Muhammad Sayyid al-Tantawi's 1997 book The Israelites in the Qur‚Äôan. He was an integral part of the religious leadership in Egypt, which purported the idea that Jews had undermined Islam throughout history. In the book, Jews are characterised as a swindler people starting both world wars for selfish economic gain and taking over the German economy as a result of their sinister fiscal techniques. Tantawi used that perception of Jews as a justification for Hitler's genocidal agenda and said that it is \\"iittle wonder that the Germans rose against them several times and employed all the means of killing, expulsion, and pillage\\". The Murabitun organization has published policy statements that are antisemitic and concentrate on breaking Jewish control of the world financial system. According to Robert S. Wistrich, both Hamas and Hezbollah routinely blame \\"the world banking crisis on the Jews who supposedly control the American government and economy\\". Osama bin Laden, in his 2002 Letter to America, wrote, \\"You [United States] are the nation that permits usury, which has been forbidden by all religions. yet you build your economy and investments on Usury. As a result of all this, in all its different forms and guises, the Jews have taken control of your economy, through which they have taken control of your media, and now control all aspects of your life making you their servants and achieving aims at their expense.\\"Foxman, p. 63Foxman quotes bin Laden's \\"Letter to America\\", 24 Nov 2002 (online) Mahmoud Ahmadinejad, the president of Iran, told the United Nations General Assembly in 2008 that the ZionistsIranian President Ahmadinejad's 2008 UN Address :The dignity, integrity and rights of the American and European people are being played with by a small but deceitful number of people called Zionists. Although they are a minuscule minority, they have been dominating an important portion of the financial and monetary centers as well as the political decision-making centers of some European countries and the US in a deceitful, complex and furtive manner. It is deeply disastrous to witness that some presidential or premiere nominees in some big countries have to visit these people, take part in their gatherings, swear their allegiance and commitment to their interests in order to attain financial or media support. \\"have been dominating an important portion of the financial and monetary centers [‚Ä¶] in a deceitful, complex, and furtive manner\\".Foxman, p. 40 Foxman also identifies editorials, cartoons and news stories throughout the Middle East as sources that repeat money-related antisemitic myths. =Nation of Islam= The Nation of Islam has promulgated some money-based antisemitic myths, particularly in its book The Secret Relationship Between Blacks and Jews. Volume 1 claims that Jews played a major role in the Atlantic slave trade and profited from black slavery.Foxman, pp. 130-135 Volume 2 of the book alleges that Jews in America exploited black labour and innovation in cotton, textiles, music and banking, for example.Foxman, pp. 130-140 The book also asserts that Jews have promoted a myth of black racial inferiority. Nation of Islam leader Louis Farrakhan has also elaborated on these concepts in speeches, making statements such as \\"The Federal Reserve is the synagogue of Satan, [‚Ä¶] the House of Rothschild\\" and \\"The Black man and woman have always been looked upon as the 'property' of White America, and particularly, members of the Jewish community\\".Foxman, pp. 132-5 =20th-century populism= =White supremacists= In the 1970s, the white supremacist movement in the United States adopted the position that Jews are \\"parasites and vultures\\" who are attempting to enslave Aryans by dominating world banking and media.Law, Randall, Terrorism: a History, Polity, 2009, p. 318 White supremacists such as William L. Pierce have repeated money- based antisemitic myths.Foxman, pp. 122-5 The militia movement in the United States is also a source of money-based antisemitism. Its leaders include Bo Gritz, who alleges that the Federal Reserve System is controlled by Jews, and John Trochman, who believes that the nation's problems are the fault of a Jewish \\"banking elite\\". Dershowitz, Alan, The vanishing American Jew: in search of Jewish identity for the next century, Hachette Digital, Inc., 1997, p. 102Zeskind, Leonard, Blood and politics: the history of the white nationalist movement from the margins to the mainstream, Macmillan, 2009, p. 296 =New economic antisemitism= According to Rosensaft and Bauer, the international Arab boycott constitutes a \\"new economic antisemitism\\". Irwin Cotler elaborates that the new economic antisemitism involves Arab countries applying an international restrictive covenant against corporations in other countries by conditioning their trade with Arab countries to the following: *refrain from doing business with Israel (secondary boycott) *refrain from doing business with another corporation that may be doing business with Israel (tertiary boycott) *refrain from hiring or promoting Jews within the corporation. = 21st-century = The topic of economic antisemitism came to the public spot-light yet again when NBA player LeBron James used Instagram to share a lyric about \\"Jewish Money\\" to 45.8million of his followers. James apologized for his behaviour, but pleaded ignorance by stating that he \\"actually thought it was a compliment, and obviously it wasn't through the lens of a lot of people.\\" This episode came one year after James said that \\"racism may appear hidden, but it is alive every single day in the US, and across the world.\\" Ignorance among factions of the left over economic forms of antisemitism have been blamed for the Labour Party's recent antisemitism controversy. Siobhain McDonagh received controversy from the left wing of the party after she appeared to agree with a statement put forward by John Humphreys that \\"to be anti-capitalist you have to be antisemitic\\".  In literature  Jews have been portrayed as miserly and greedy in both belles- lettres and popular literature.Krefetz p. 7Rosenberg, Edgar, From Shylock to Svengali: Jewish stereotypes in English fiction, Stanford University Press, 1960 =Shylock= Front cover of The Kingdom of Shylock (1917), a pamphlet by Australian politician Frank Anstey asserting Jewish control of banking and finance The character Shylock in William Shakespeare's play The Merchant of Venice is a Jewish moneylender who is portrayed in unscrupulous and avaricious. Penslar asserts that Shylock is a metaphor for the Jewish \\"otherness\\" and that he represents the \\"inseparability of Jewish religious, social, and economic distinctiveness\\". Gerald Krefetz calls Shylock a \\"classic image\\" that has haunted Jews ever since it first appeared since it made Jews a scapegoat. Historian Richard Hofstadter wrote that Shylock was used as the basis for \\"crankery\\" by Charles Coughlin and Ezra Pound. *Hoftstadter, Richard, The Paranoia1 Style in American Politics, 1965. Hofstadter is quoted by: *Gross, John, Shylock: A Legend and Its Legacy, Simon and Schuster, 1994, page 314 John Gross stated that Shylock represents \\"the sinister international financier\\" on both sides of the Atlantic Ocean.Gross, p. 314 Foxman contends that Shylock may have contributed to antisemitism in Japan since The Merchant of Venice has been translated into Japanese more than any other play by Shakespeare.Foxman, p. 77 =Fagin= The character Fagin in Charles Dickens's novel Oliver Twist is depicted as avaricious and has served to support antisemitic stereotypes. Dickens claimed that he held Jews in high regard and that the depiction of Fagin was simply a caricature that was based upon actual persons. In an apparent demonstration of remorse, he removed many occurrences of the word \\"Jew\\" from later editions of the work. =Ezra Pound= Poet Ezra Pound mentions Jewish attitudes towards money in his The Cantos, which has primarily economic and governance themes. In the poem, Jews are implicated in sinister manipulations of the money supply.Levine, Gary Martin, The merchant of modernism: the economic Jew in Anglo-American literature, Psychology Press, 2003, p. 154-156 Foxman asserts, \\"The Cantos include a \\"vicious diatribe against interest-paying finance\\" and that it has sections with antisemitic passages.Foxman, p. 62 In Canto 52, \\"Stinkschuld's [Rothschilds] sin drawing vengeance, poor yitts paying for / Stinkschuld [Rothschilds] / paying for a few big jews' vendetta on goyim\\" had the name Rothschilds replaced by \\"Stinkschulds\\" at the insistence of Pound's publisher.Bruce, Ira Nadel, The Cambridge companion to Ezra Pound, Cambridge University Press, 1999, p. 293 See also *List of Jewish American businesspeople *Secular Jewish culture#Economic activity *Conspiracy theories about George Soros References Sources *ADL Report, \\"Jewish 'Control' of the Federal Reserve: A Classic Anti-Semitic Myth\\", July 1995 *Aris, Stephen, The Jews in Business, Cape, 1970 *Arkin, Marcus, \\"Not of Pure Aryan Stock: The Jewish Impact on the Economic Transformation of Modern Germany\\", in A new Jewry: America since the Second World War, Peter Medding (Ed.), Oxford University 1992, pages 237‚Äì240.

The epithet Sultanzade means son of a sultana. Biographies He was born in 1596/1603. His father, Osman Bey, was a grandson of R√ºstem Pasha and Mihrimah Sultan, making him a descendant of Suleiman the Magnificent. His mother, Ay≈üe Hanƒ±m Sultan, was a daughter of Cƒ±ƒüalazade Yusuf Sinan Pasha.  Early years  In 1637, he was appointed as the governor of Egypt. Three years later, during the reign of ƒ∞brahim, he returned to ƒ∞stanbul as a vizier in the Ottoman divan. In 1641, he was appointed as the governor of √ñz√º (modern Ochakiv in Ukraine) and tasked with capturing the fort of Azak (modern Azov in Russia), which had recently been lost to the Cossacks. He was successful in recapturing the fort. In 1643, he was appointed as the governor of Damascus (in modern Syria). This appointment was probably due to the secret power struggle between him and the grand vizier, Kemanke≈ü Mustafa Pasha.Ayhan Buz: Osmanlƒ± Sadrazamlarƒ±, Neden Kitap, ƒ∞stanbul, 2009,  As Grand Vizier  In 1644, he succeeded the grand vizier Kemanke≈ü Mustafa Pasha, who was executed. Kemanke≈ü Mustafa Pasha was a victim of palace intrigues and a quack hodja named Djindji Khodja. Well aware of hodja's influence on the sultan and the tragedy of the previous grand vizier, he was too cautious in governance and became an ineffective grand vizier. He became a yes man of the sultan. According to Lord Kinross,Lord Kinross: The Ottoman centuries (translated by Meral Gaspƒ±ralƒ±), Altƒ±n Kitaplar, ƒ∞stanbul, 2008, , p. 306 one day the sultan asked why he never opposed any opinion to which he replied, \\"Every opinion of the sultan has a deep aphorism even if subjects are unable to understand.\\" Although he was against declaring war on the Republic of Venice,Prof. Ya≈üar Y√ºce-Prof. Ali Sevim: T√ºrkiye tarihi Cilt III, AKDTYKTTK Yayƒ±nlarƒ±, ƒ∞stanbul, 1991 p. 90 his cautious objections were not taken into consideration and the Cretan War (1645‚Äì1669) soon began in 1645, which was financially disastrous to both sides.  Later years  In 1645, Sultan Ibrahim deposed him. His next mission was on the island of Crete (in modern Greece), which was the theatre of the recently started war as the commander of the army () but he soon died of natural causes.

It is a legal intervention in which a person who is deemed to be harassing, threatening or stalking another person is ordered to stop, with the goal of reducing risk of further threat or harm to the person being harassed. Some restraining orders are limited to domestic partners, but the CHO is not. It is frequently used with the purpose of preventing harassment by co-workers, neighbours, strangers and acquaintances. Pursuant to California Code of Civil Procedure section 527.6(b), in order to justify a CHO, the harassment must be \\"such as would cause a reasonable person to suffer substantial emotional distress and must actually cause substantial emotional distress to the victim.\\" Provisions and process A CHO can require the harasser to stop initiating contact with the victim, and/or to stay away from the victim's family, workplace, home, and/or school. A temporary CHO will be in effect until a court hearing can be held, normally within 15‚Äì22 days. A \\"final order\\" CHO, which may be granted following the court hearing, remains in effect for up to three years. A CHO does not go into effect until it is served to the person being restrained. Serving the CHO is the responsibility of the petitioner. Service can be carried out by the Sheriff's Department of the county where the harasser lives or works, or by any adult who is not a party named in the case. Punishment for violation The crime of stalking is punishable in California by imprisonment in a county jail for not more than one year, or by a fine of not more than one thousand dollars ($1,000), or by both that fine and imprisonment, or by imprisonment in the state prison. The punishment for violating a CHO is 2‚Äì4 years of imprisonment. Other types The CHO is one of six types of restraining orders used in California. The Emergency Protective Order, the Domestic Violence Temporary Restraining Order and the Criminal Protective (\\"No Contact\\") Order, are aimed at protecting against domestic violence. The Elder or Dependent Adult Protective Order is aimed at protecting victims who are over 65 years old and/or who have certain disabilities. The Workplace Violence Restraining Order is aimed at protecting employees from violence in the workplace. Several hundred thousand restraining orders are in effect in California at any time, and between 80 and 95 per cent cover domestic violence involving adults. Effectiveness Experts disagree on whether restraining orders are effective in preventing further harassment. A 2010 analysis published in the Journal of the American Academy of Psychiatry and the Law reviewed 15 U.S. studies of restraining order effectiveness, and concluded that restraining orders \\"can serve a useful role in threat management.\\" However, a 2002 analysis of 32 U.S. studies found that restraining orders are violated an average of 40 per cent of the time and are perceived as being \\"followed by worse events\\" almost 21 per cent of the time, and concluded that \\"evidence of [restraining orders'] relative efficacy is lacking,\\" and that they may pose some degree of risk. A large America-wide telephone survey conducted in 1998 found that, of stalking victims who obtained a restraining order, more than 68 per cent reported it being violated by their stalker. Threat management experts are often suspicious of restraining orders, believing they may escalate or enrage stalkers. In his 1997 book The Gift Of Fear, well-known American security specialist Gavin de Becker characterized restraining orders as \\"homework assignments police give to women to prove they're really committed to getting away from their pursuers,\\" and said they \\"clearly serve police and prosecutors,\\" but \\"they do not always serve victims.\\" References Category:California law Category:Court orders Category:Harassment ","title":"Civil Harassment Restraining Order"},{"id":"32078809","text":"Species are grouped trophically on the left, however distinctions such as herbivore and predator are merely the simplest definitions. Trophic species are a scientific grouping of organisms according to their shared trophic (feeding) positions in a food web or food chain. Trophic species have identical prey and a shared set of predators in the food web. This means that members of a trophic species share many of the same kinds of ecological functions. The idea of trophic species was first devised by Joel Cohen and Frederick Briand in 1984 to redefine assessment of the ratio of predators to prey within a food web. The category may include species of plant, animal, a combination of plant and animal, and biological stages of an organism. The reassessment grouped similar species according to habit rather than genetics. This resulted in a ratio of predator to prey in food webs is generally 1:1. By assigning groups in a trophic manner, relationships are linear in scale. This allows for predicting the proportion of different trophic links in a community food web.

The highway runs northeast past Ellis Field to intersect Highway 293 in rural Drew County. North of this junction, Highway 138 passes two cemeteries, including the nearby Taylor Log House and Site. Highway 138 continues northeast through farmland to enter Winchester in the northeast corner of the county. Just east of Winchester, Highway 138 intersects US 65/US 165, a divided highway at an at-grade intersection. The route next enters Desha County, serving as the southern terminus of Highway 159. Highway 159 is a minor route within the county, serving only county roads from this point eastward. The highway meets Highway 1 at Kelso, where it terminates. The road is a two-lane, undivided, rural route for its entire length. FHWA maps indicate that Highway 138 is on the National Highway System east of US 65 / US 165,National Highway System: Arkansas, October 1, 2012 even though it is a minor two-lane road. History Highway 138 intersects US 65/US 165 near Dumas The route became a state highway in 1930, running from Highway 4 south to McGehee, with Highway 4 running east to Tillar. Prior to 1940, Highway 4 was rerouted onto the former Highway 138, with the former routing to Tillar becoming Highway 138. This change is still apparent on the highway map, as Highway 4 was later replaced by US 278, which creates today's \\"kink\\" in US 278 in east Drew County. The routing of today's Highway 138 appears on the state highway maps beginning in the mid‚Äì1950s, but is not numbered. Around 1960, a segment from Winchester to Kelso becomes Highway 138, in addition to a segment from Tillar north to Winchester. The Kelso segment was redesignated Arkansas Highway 277 in the mid-1960s, which enabled a contemporaneous extension of Highway 138 from Winchester west to the current Highway 293. By 1966, the route was extended to Monticello. The road was paved from Monticello north in 1967, as the segment between US 65/US 165 and Kelso was paved upon its earlier designation.

If approved, it would become Europe's largest open-pit gold mine and it would use the gold cyanidation mining technique. Currently, the project is on-hold awaiting a parliamentary decision. The benefits of the state consist of 20% of the shares owned by the publicly owned company Minvest Deva and the 6% royalties of the gold and silver extracted not taking into consideration other valuable metals such as Wolfram, Uranium, Tellurium, Germanium, Titanium, Molybdenum, Vanadium, Nickel, Chrome, Cobalt, Gallium, Bismuth, Arsenic or the Potassium- Feldspar. a Romanian company established in 1997, in Alba County, based in Ro»ôia MontanƒÉ, whose shareholders are the State-owned mining company Minvest Deva - with 19.31%, Gabriel Resources ‚Äì with 80.46% (listed on the Toronto Stock Exchange (GBU symbol)) and other minority shareholders ‚Äì with 0.23%. The project met a significant resistance from environmental groups and from neighbouring European countries,Ro≈üia MontanƒÉ: Political and Social Risk Management in the Land of DraculaPressematerial zur EU-Delegenation nach Ro≈üia MontanƒÉ culminating in the nationwide protests by thousands of people across the country since September 2013. A number of locals refuse to sell their properties to the Ro»ôia MontanƒÉ Gold Corporation and, in order for the project to commence, the state would need to exercise eminent domain. History Frank Timi»ô, a Romanian-born Australian, founded a company, Gabriel Resources, in the Channel Island of Jersey in 1995. Timi»ô negotiated with the Romanian state and, in 1996, they signed a contract with state-owned Regia AutonomƒÉ a Cuprului Deva for the creation of a joint venture (Eurogold Resources) for the exploitation of auriferous residues from previous exploitations. Gabriel Resources was allowed to have 60% of the shares in the new company but, in a new protocol a year later, the Gabriel Resources stake was increased to 80%, while state's participation (through Minvest) was reduced to 18.8%, while being still allowed to exploit just around the existing mine. The company was renamed \\"Ro»ôia MontanƒÉ Gold Corporation\\" in 1999. The extraction licenses owned by state-owned Minvest Deva were transferred to the joint venture following a call by Minister of Industries Radu Berceanu in a letter that has since disappeared. Between 1999 and 2000, the operating perimeter was increased from 12 km¬≤ to 20 km¬≤ and later 42 km¬≤. In 2000, RMGC paid $20 million for a pre-feasibility study (done by American company Pincock Allen & Holt) which resulted in an estimate of 8 million ounces of gold. The company claimed to invest $250 million (raised from the stock market, banks and mutual funds) and it promised that within three years the project would create 25,000 jobs. The Social Liberal Union has drifted away from its platform prior to the parliamentary elections and the Government approved a draft law regulating the conditions of participation, passing it to the Parliament for debate. This has sparked massive spontaneous protests still ongoing (see 2013 Romanian protests against the Ro»ôia MontanƒÉ Project) and the presidential candidate Crin Antonescu unexpectedly declared in a press conference that in his opinion the project should be rejected. The Prime Minister Victor Ponta has also digressed claiming that the Government has approved the bill to prevent being sued for compensations and the Parliament will definitely vote against it closing the subject.World-Europe; BBC; accessed . Following this development, the Gabriel Resources shares have plummeted.GBU; Quote Media In November 2013 the Romanian Senat rejected the project, followed by the Chamber of Deputies in June 2014.Vot final √Æn cazul Ro≈üia MontanƒÉ; Radio Romania International Technical aspects Gabriel Resources, the Canadian majority owner of the project, ran a geological survey in 2000, which gave an estimation of 330 tons of gold and 1600 tons of silver in the four mountains surrounding the town of Ro»ôia MontanƒÉ, if the exploitation would use blasting and cyanide extraction. The project would grind a large quantity of rock: 218 million tons according to the technical file of the project or 262 million tons according to the project memorandum,Geological Institute of Romania, Point of View sent to the Parliamentary Commission for Ro»ôia MontanƒÉ\\", September 30, 2013, at Centrul de Investiga»õii Media resulting a dust having particles with a diameter between 74 and 150 micrometres. The dust would be leached with cyanides in order to extract the gold; due to the small diameter of the particles, the resulting sludge would have a large quantity of cyanide compounds: according to RMGC estimates, about 500 tons, out of a total of 214.9 million tons of sludge. The sludge would be deposited in a 45-hectare tailings pond, which would be built on the valley of the Corna River, requiring a dam 600 metres wide and 185 metres high and changing the course of river. =Geology= Ro»ôia MontanƒÉ Gold Corporation claimed that the pond would be safe from infiltration due to the impermeable clay formations on the hillsides. This was disputed in a 2013 report by the Geological Institute of Romania, which claimed that the company ignored the real geological context as the left hillside is made of highly porous sandstone. The Institute argued that the valley cannot be used safely to deposit such a large quantity of tailings and proposed as a solution the reduction of the quantity of tailings through a flotation process combined with porosity sealing of the bottom of the pond. The Geological Institute also voiced concerns that the method of exploitation would lead to the loss of large quantities of germanium, tellurium, arsenic, lead and zinc. The existence of notable quantities of copper, lead and zinc in the ore would lead to an increase in the usage of cyanide, a lower recovery rate for gold and silver, as well as leading to sulphocyanide-rich sludge. The company denies the existence of metals in notable quantities, which is contradicted by the Geological Institute. In October 2013, during the hearing at the Senate, »òtefan Marincea, the President of the Geological Institute, accused his predecessor of signing a notice saying there are no fault lines in Ro»ôia MontanƒÉ, which Marincea contended is false and that there are many fault lines in the area. Marincea also argued that changing the course of the Cernea river is not possible because of the springs on the bottom of the Corna Valley. Opposition Protesters against the mining project marching in Bucharest 1 September Protesters against the mining project marching in Bucharest 15 September Protesters against the mining project sitting in Bucharest on 15 September 2013 Opposition to the project was originally organized by Eugen David, a local farmer who refused to sell his land to Ro»ôia MontanƒÉ Gold Corporation. He was among the founders of \\"Alburnus Maior\\", an association of activists bearing the Roman name of the town. David gained the support of Teddy Goldsmith, an Anglo-French environmentalist and of Swiss-born journalist Stephanie Danielle Roth, who moved to Ro»ôia MontanƒÉ to help David's quest. With help from Stephanie Danielle Roth, David's group was able to obtain grants from international NGOs (including George Soros's Open Society Institute) and to raise the issue of the mine on national level by organizing a hearing with 40 Romanian NGOs, including sections of international organizations such as Greenpeace. Alburnus Maior gained support from British actress Vanessa Redgrave, who, when receiving a prize at the Transilvania International Film Festival, she used her acceptance speech to bring the issue of the project, which led to coverage in the international press. A number of organizations and groups opposed the project, including a group of 83 Romanian professors of economics, a group of artists and intellectuals (among which Horia-Roman Patapievici, the head of the Romanian Cultural Institute) who published a letter in The Guardian in 2006 and a number of international archeologists who voiced their concerns over the destruction of the area's unique Roman mines. The major churches of Romania, the Romanian Orthodox Church, the Roman Catholic Churcha and the Greek-Catholic Church, oppose the project, as does the Romanian Academy. On 1 September 2013 thousands of Romanians protested against the project in dozens of cities across the country, the protests continuing the following days in Bucharest. Environment Major issues regarding the environmental impact of the Ro»ôia MontanƒÉ Project regard the usage of cyanides, as well as the practice of open- pit mining, which would require the usage of a large area, including four mountains, which would, according to the opponents, \\"be turned into a desert\\". The usage of cyanides has been a contentious issue, especially due to the fears of spillage into rivers and the groundwater. This fear was augmented by the precedent of another gold mining company in Romania, which similarly promised a state-of-the-art, self-contained, environmental-friendly project, having a dam burst (see 2000 Baia Mare cyanide spill) and the cyanide-laced water of the tailings pond flowed into the Danube, leading to one of Europe's biggest environmental disasters. The company claims that the local area has been polluted by 2000 years of bad mining techniques and that its environmental-impact analysis shows that the project will help restore the environment. The analysis was however called as bad science by a government panel in Hungary, which claimed that its data is \\"insufficient, deficient, inaccurate or not considered to be representative\\". Since Romania joined the EU, mining in Romania is now subject to strict regulations regarding cyanide concentration. The Rosia Montana mine complies with these regulations and its cyanide concentration will be 20 times less than that of the Baia Mare mine. Archeology and heritage Roman mining gallery; most of such galleries would have to be destroyed In order for the project to proceed, a number of archeological sites, as well as some historic buildings must be destroyed. This includes large parts of the well-preserved 2000-year-old Roman mine galleries, which have attracted talk of a possible nomination to become a UNESCO World Heritage site. Economics The company attempted to get a $100 million loan from the World Bank in 2002, however the loan was canceled at the personal intervention of World Bank president James Wolfensohn. Allegations of corruption The Ro»ôia MontanƒÉ Project has been widely accused by opponents, the media and politicians as being corrupt. For instance, a Deutsche Welle editorial said that the project \\"practiced bribery through professional and systematic processes\\". The \\"Alliance for a Clean Romania\\", an NGO that fights corruption in Romania called for the project to be canceled due to the \\"non-transparent manner\\" through which everything was developed. Politicians, both on the left and right sides of the political spectrum, accused their adversaries of being bribed in order to support the mining project. While in opposition, Social-Democratic leader Victor Ponta opposed the project claiming that the Ro»ôia MontanƒÉ Project stalled because \\"not all politicians can be bought like President BƒÉsescu\\". On the other side of the political spectrum, Democratic-Liberal MP Theodor Paleologu claimed to oppose the project due to \\"the corruption of politicians and journalists\\".

The reserve was listed by UNESCO in 1977 as a Biosphere Reserve under the Man and the Biosphere Programme (MAB). The reserve is significant for its biodiversity in both native plant and animal species. Cultural heritage and historical grazing activities add to the significance of this site as a conservation area. The reserve is the most extensive in New South Wales and shares a border with the Nonbinnie Nature Reserve in the south-eastern corner, and is part of the Central NSW Mallee Important Bird Area. The reserve is situated south of the central-west town of Cobar and west from Sydney. Geography and climate The topography and landscape of the Yathong Nature Reserve is typical of central New South Wales in its predominance of semi-arid characteristics. The reserve is positioned within two Interim Biogeographic Regionalisation of Australia (IBRA) bioregions of the Cobar Peneplain and the Murray Darling Depression. The geography exhibits a mix of flat, undulating plains, ridges and ranges. The dominating ridge system is the Merrimerriwa Range, which is a prominent feature in the landscape that extends south throughout the south-east corner of the reserve. These regions are dominated by soil types that range from thin sandy/stony on the ridges to thicker colluvial, red and earthy types that exhibit texture contrast profiles. The reserve is subject to the dominating semi-arid climate of the region. Hot and dry climatic patterns give rise to hot summers and mild winters with steady rainfall averages throughout the year. Ecological character Regional biospheres share uneven borders both within and in close proximity to the reserve, which greatly influences the reserve's ecological character and structure. These geographic and landscape properties provide a variety of habitats and ecosystems in which plant and animal species thrive. Sub-tropical, arid and semi-arid landscapes and subtle climatic components are an influencing factor for the rich plant communities. This is also the case for the animal population, which also exhibits a richness and diversity. The major vegetation groups include semi-arid woodlands, arid shrub-lands and grassy woodlands. Animal communities are composed of mixed mammals, birds and reptiles; some of which are listed as endangered or rare both regionally and nationally. =Flora= There are a range of plant species that make up the significant mixed floral communities across the reserve. Current records show a total of 460 species within the reserve of which 12 have protection status in New South Wales. Two species, curly-bark wattle (Acacia curranii) and wingless fissure-weed (Osteocarpum pentapterum), have vulnerable and extinct listing respectively. The vegetation communities can be split based on dominating geographic assemblages within the reserve. Roughly 50% of the vegetation is of mallee vegetation types, which include green mallee (Eucalyptus viridis), grey mallee (Eucalyptus morrisii), white mallee (Eucalyptus dumosa), red mallee (Eucalyptus socialis), yorrell white mallee (Eucalyptus gracilis) and dwyers mallee (Eucalyptus dwyeri). The remaining vegetation communities of the reserve are woodland types that have two classes: grassy and semi-arid woodland. They include white cypress pine (Callitris glaucophylla), bimble box (Eucalyptus populnea), black box (Eucalyptus largiflorens), and belah (Casuarina cristata). Both community structure and diversity of the vegetation throughout the reserve has undergone measurable alteration as a result of land clearance and grazing activities. Uncertainty surrounds the pre-European character of distribution and diversity of vegetation and therefore the full extent to which impacts have altered the natural community assemblage is unclear. Mallee communities have a distinctive vegetation assemblage which is predominately made up of eucalypt species. Extensive grazing and agricultural activities following European settlement has reduced the distribution of these distinctive communities. The extent of intact mallee within the reserve highlights the importance for conservation activities for both the distinctive plant communities and the inhabiting fauna. =Fauna= Malleefowl Striated grass wren The reserve hosts a diverse range of animal species with a recorded total of 253 all of which have a protected status in New South Wales. Examples of mammal species include the short-beaked echidna (Tachyglossus aculeatus), brush-tailed rock-wallaby (Petrogale penicillata), yellow-bellied sheathtail-bat (Saccolaimus flaviventris). Three nationally important kangaroo species are all present within the reserve; eastern grey (Macropus giganteus), western grey (Macropus fuliginosus) and red kangaroo (Macropus rufus). Reptile species are also represented well within the reserve and include species such as; marble-faced delma (Delma australis), western blue-tongued lizard (Tiliqua occipitalis) and mallee military dragon (Ctenophorus fordi). Reptiles within the region have a preference for mallee habitat much like that of the malleefowl. The area is rich in bird species with 130 being confirmed and a further concentration of 12 species within mallee habitat. Current records raise the total number of bird species present in the area up to 162. All recorded bird species are listed as protected in NSW; of these 11 are protected and 1 endangered and 4 recognised nationally. Notable species include malleefowl (Leipoa ocellata), red-lored whistler (Pachycephala rufogularis), grey falcon (Falco hypoleucos), pink cockatoo (Lophochroa leadbeateri) and striated grass wren (Amytornis striatus). The malleefowl has gained considerable attention and conservation status within and outside the reserve. This is a result of the combination of encroachment of human activities and the specificity of the habitat requirements of the malleefowl. Management strategies at the time of NPWS reserve plan included breeding programs alongside activities to reduce threatening processes and predatory species. A national recovery plan targeting a range of endangered species, not specific to the reserve, includes actions to protect and promote the malleefowl population. The actions undertaken in NSW will comprise a variety of conservation and management activities. Introduced animal species, data collection and monitoring are the main approaches taken in NSW in the effort to preserve the malleefowl. Many introduces species occur within the area and cause some alterations to the native species that inhabit the reserve. The major introduced species are the European red fox (Vulpes vulpes), feral cats (Felis catus), feral dogs (Canis lupus familiaris), feral pigs (Sus scrofa), goat (Capra hircus) and rabit (Oryctolagos cuniculus). Environmental hazards and threats Feral goat browsing in Yathong Nature Reserve The occurrence of bushfire is the primary environmental hazard that poses a direct threat to the biodiversity of the reserve. The threat of fire has been listed as a Key Threatening Process (KTP) by the NSW Government as it would have a drastic effect on the \\"loss of vegetation structure and composition\\". The fire management plan is one that considers biodiversity and cultural heritage in the approach to managing fires. The size and age of the reserve allows for a greater capacity for drought and fire resistance, which is in part due to the age classes of existing vegetation. The second concern regarding threats comes from predation and encroachment of introduced species. Predation threats for the native species are a result of the feeding habits of the introduce feral animals. Both feral dogs and cats, for instance, pose threats to animal species within the reserve. Feral cat and fox predation on bird species is of particular concern for ground dwelling and nesting birds. Examples of the bird species that are vulnerable include; red-lored whistler (Pachycephala rufogularis), malleefowl (Leipoa ocellata) and striated grass wren (Amytornis striatus). Goats and rabbit species pose a risk to both the plant and animal communities through overgrazing and species competition. This is a raised concern where native animals may rely on a specific habitat such as the malleefowl. Competition, overgrazing and habitat destruction also comes from the three kangaroo species present within the reserve. Introduced and invasive plant species also pose threats to the structure and range of plant communities. Species such as lantana (Lantana camara L. sens. Lat), bitou bush (Chrysanthemoides monilifera) and perennial grasses are a source of competition for native plant species. Subsequent effects on the habit and the dependent native animal species raises concern for the spread of invasive species. Reserve management Yathong Nature Reserve is managed by the NSW National Parks & Wildlife Service (NPWS), an agency of the Government of New South Wales. The management goals of the reserve plan are the protection of floral and faunal communities with wider consideration of natural and cultural heritage and public uses. The key areas for management will focus on native and introduced flora and fauna alongside considerations of fire management. The second area of concern regards the recognition of cultural and historic properties of the park. The Ngiyam and Wiradjuripaa people, traditional land owners, will be involved with works and activities that concern cultural values, heritage and important sites. The development of information and knowledge of the reserve will draw from the knowledge that the traditional land owners possess. The importance of the reserve has drawn interest from groups concerned with flora and fauna communities of the area. The Foundation for National Parks and Wildlife (FNPW) has been involved in the creation of the reserve and subsequent conservation activities, particularly of the malleefowl. The reserve is also listed in the Important Bird Area database, which contributes to monitoring the population's numbers and therefore aiding future protection and conservation efforts. Management activities regarding threats mainly focus on controlling the effect of encroachment and predation by introduced species. Actions undertaken by the NPWS include targeted control plans for endangered and vulnerable native species. Baiting programs exist and target pest species such as foxes and feral dogs and cats.

Despite the original Xbox 360 version only being released in Japan, it was a region-free release. A version for Microsoft Windows has also been released, and was published by Degica. Apart from the main game, two previous Wonderswan games by the developer, Judgement Silversword and Cardinal Sins, came bundled with the Xbox 360 release of Eschatos.  Gameplay  The ship has two modes of fire: the long-range Front Shot and the short-range Wide Shot. The ship features a regenerative shield capable of absorbing enemy bullets, but with overuse can deteriorate. The game has three game modes including Original, Advanced and Time Attack. In Original mode, there are only two pick-up items including 1Ups and the Flash icon which destroys all enemies and enemy shots on-screen. Advanced mode however includes a few more items including an alternate Flash icon and Power Ups. Collecting Power Ups increase player firepower, but decreases shield percentage. The game spans over six stages that are organized with about four to six Areas per stage. There is a unique timing score utilized in each game (Eschatos, Judgment Silver Sword and Cardinal Sins): a timer is set to count up with every enemy wave and boss encounter. The timer stops once all enemies/bosses are defeated and the score is determined with how quickly each enemy wave/boss was destroyed.  Synopsis  Eschatos takes place in the 22nd century where a mysterious organic alien matter - known only as the Purple Erosion - has taken over The Moon.

He became, in the words of The Times, \\"the moving spirit in the transfer of the company from Sadler's Wells Theatre to the London Coliseum\\". He said that his principal aim was to give the company a home \\"where the members can stretch themselves, where it will be possible to develop on all fronts ‚Äì singing, production and design.\\" Among the celebrated productions of the Arlen era were Wagner's The Mastersingers and Ring cycle conducted by Reginald Goodall, whom Arlen rescued from an obscure coaching post at Covent Garden to become, in the words of The Musical Times, \\"undoubtedly today's greatest Wagner conductor\\".Fifield, Christopher. \\"Sir Reginald Goodall: An Appreciation\\", The Musical Times, September 1990, p. 481 The Times singled out \\"such exciting, if controversial, productions as The Damnation of Faust, Carmen and Tales of Hoffmann.\\" Arlen was twice married, first to Narice Ingram and secondly to the soprano Iris Kells, with whom he had a daughter.

The remote and difficult to access 568 ha reserve, at an elevation of 11 m - 55 m (average: 22 m), is home to a nationally important population of 9 different dragonfly species. The Moss is an example of a patterned raised mire system in good condition, which are rare in western Europe. Divided by several burns, the ground is very wet and the water quality is excellent. The reserve supports 14 different species of moss, as well as scarce higher plants. Red deer are culled annually to prevent overgrazing, as they lack natural predators with the extinction of the wolf in Scotland. Visitors are not encouraged to visit the reserve as it is dangerous to walk over, with the many partially hidden bog pools often being of a great depth. It is in any case difficult to access, except by private boat. The only established footpath to the edge of the reserve is the forestry track at Sr√≤n na Gaoithe, south-east of Ardshealach.

Gustavus Hindman Miller (1857‚Äì1929) was a prominent merchant, manufacturer, financier, capitalist farmer, author and public spirited citizen of Chattanooga, Tennessee. Early life Gustavus was born in frontier Texas, September 4, 1857, in a small board house on a ranch, on Raney's Creek, Beat No. 3, near where the present site of Coryell County, now stands. Home of Franklin Lafayette Miller, Coryell County, Texas (1857). He was the eldest son of Franklin Lafayette Miller (b. 1832, Millersburg, Tennessee; m. 18 Dec. 1856) and Emily (McGee) Miller (b. 11 May 1841, Jackson, GA), early pioneer settlers of that county. Interesting sketches of their experiences and accomplishments are given in Millers of Millersburg (1923) a family record published by Gustavus H. Miller in conjunction with J. Bailey Nicklin, Jr. He had two brothers, Felix Grundy Miller III (b. 17 Dec 1859; d. 18 Oct 1863) who died age three, and Franklin Lubbock Miller I (b. 21 Jan 1861), who later became one half of the Miller Brothers. He and his brother Frank were toddlers when their father died in army (CSA) camp in Galveston, Texas, 18 October 1862. Yellow Fever took Franklin Lafayette Miller, he never faced combat. In his book The Millers of Millersburg he Miller reminisced: :\\"It is interesting to follow the illusive tracery in memory across that hazy span of life between the ages of four and seven. My father and Grandmother McGee died when I was about four years of age. I only remember to have seen my father going to the barn or attending to the stock--a colt or calf was prominent in my affection at that age. I only remember to have seen my grandmother when cooking. She must have encouraged me, her second grandson, in loving her, by giving me such dainties as she could prepare from meager after- servings. My grandmother's death lost her children a boundless love. My memory of these two ancestors is no doubt due to an inherited love of saddle and bridle, and a more primitive instinct to look for something to eat. I do not remember having seen my father about the house, or any game he may have played with us.\\" His mother remarried, 20 March 1865, to James Franklin Mayfield (b. 20 Dec. 1846). The orphan brothers were raised in the crowded house of their maternal grandfather (James Lowery McGee b. 29 Dec. 1816, Jackson Co., GA d. 10 Jul. 1895, TX), along with the two groups of children sired by that worthy, and his surviving wife. Between the large number of mouths to feed, and depressed conditions following the Confederate loss of the Civil War, conditions for all the inhabitants of the McGee household were grim. Miller recalled: :\\"About two years after grandmother's death, grandfather married a young widow with two children, Mrs. Hannah Miller, daughter of William Miller. Six children were born to this marriage. Owing to the second marriage of my mother, grandfather became the guardian of my brother and myself. We therefore spent much of our time in his home. When the family was rounded out, there were four sets of children; ten by his first wife, six by his second, two stepchildren, and two grandchildren. :My grandfather was a man of sterling character; the trick fellow who would cheat in a trade did not appeal to him. He had contempt for many successful men because he believed them dishonest. He used to trade in a dry goods store where there were two brothers. He said one was honest, but the other was not. Time proved his insight correct.\\" G. H. Miller obtained his education in the common schools of Coryell county, Texas, 1867‚Äì76, at the old board shanty and the old rock house. In 1870, the census lists Gus and his brother Frank, as living with their mother, stepfather, two half-siblings and a lodger, in Bosque County, Texas. Recollections of their school days by William King Sadler, a close friend of G. H. Miller: :\\"Gus, I think of you more than ever as I get old. The happiest of my days were when we went to school at the old board shanty and the old rock house. ...those were great days. We never dreamed of violating the law; our minds were in a different channel. We were taught honesty if we were taught anything. We ran our own boat from the beginning, almost.\\" :\\"I want to impress upon you that this Rainey's Creek country is level prairie, fine black land, owned by Germans. Gus and I can well remember when it was the greatest country, socially, in the world. The boys and girls who were raised there have proved to be the very highest type of manhood and womanhood. No one ever heard of trouble with the old settlers, that is, between themselves. Then we visited and loved each other and lived peaceably with all mankind. :We were what you folks call wild, but we were sons of adventurers who came here, to land untried. We would ride the wildest horses ever known to the world. We didn't do anybody any harm. I have seen this same polished, shrewd Gustavus Miller ride the wildest horses I ever saw. I saw him tie a red handkerchief around his head, make his horse pitch around the arbor where preaching was to be held for the benefit of the crowd. He didn't charge a cent nor do any harm!\\" Professional life As soon as Gus and Frank were of age, they put aside their textbooks and turned their attention to mercantile interests, Gus left Texas age 20, and he and Frank traveled to Tennessee, where their father had been raised, south of Murfreesboro. He first obtained a position as clerk in a country store at Christiana, Tennessee, January 23, 1877, and subsequently was employed at Waco, Texas. Since age conferred upon him the right of franchise Mr Miller has supported the men and measures of the republican party, while in religious faith he is a Unitarian. In 1879 he opened a general merchandise store at Burrustown, Tennessee. Then started a business of his own at Bellbuckle, Bedford County, Tennessee, 1880; and was engaged in business there from 1883 until 1889. His brother, Frank Lubbock Miller, married Mattie Johnson of Shreveport, Louisiana, 25 January 1887. His busy mercantile life had not kept him from devoting his evenings after business hours to literary pursuits; and as a writer he has won wide and favorable attention, from his pen having come some very bright stories, among them, the following books: * Lucy Dalton, 1883; * Is Marriage a Failure, 1895; * What's in a Dream?, 1901; * Thysparia the Mysterious, 1909; * Tribute to His Brother, 1921; * The Jew, 1921; * and The Millers of Millersburg, in collaboration with John Bailey Nicklin, Jr., 1923. The year 1889, due to various business ventures, witnessed their removal to Chattanooga, Tennessee, where he settled with his younger brother, F. L. Miller, Sr., and became prominent in the business world. They opened their first store at 510 Market Street, where they prospered in the retail business, first in distressed merchandise, eventually moving up to a full-featured department store: the Miller Brothers' Company department store, founded 1889, adding a wholesale department in 1895. They conducted business under the name of Miller Brothers Company, jobbers, brokers and mill agents. Miller Bros. Center: Gustavus Miller, Mayor Watkins, and Franklin Miller. Miller Bros. Co's. Department Store. \\"The store that made Chattanooga famous.\\" After this store burned, the brothers raised the money needed and began planning their new Miller Brothers Department Store in the downtown area of Chattanooga. The architect chosen was Reuben Harrison Hunt. The Miller Brothers Building was constructed in 1898 in a Victorian Romanesque style, initially with of space. The building was designed with much open floor space to allow for display of merchandise. One of the most distinguishing features of the building was the large skylight on the fourth floor with an open atrium to all four floors allowing a substantial amount of light into the interior of the building. When the store opened, it was reputed to have ‚Äúthe greatest display of merchandise that has ever been in a Southern store‚Äù, business was good, and in fact the store became one of the largest retail stores south of the Ohio River. The Miller Brothers strived to keep up with the changing times and in December 1904, the store was fitted with an elevator service. The 1900 census lists Gustavus H. Miller as living at 405 Poplar Street, Chattanooga City, with his wife, three children and two lodgers, who were nephews of Tennessee Miller. Three years later, Who's Who in America (1903), lists him as a Democrat, and living at 416 West 5th Street, with his office at the corner of Market and 7th Streets, Chattanooga, Tennessee. Hamilton National Bank Building. G. H. Miller served as President of this bank. G. H. Miller was the Founder, served as President, and owned controlling stock in Buster Brown's Hosiery Mills and the United (or Miller-Smith) Hosiery Mills Corporation from 1907 until his retirement in 1923. He was also the President, Director, and senior partner/member of the firm Miller Bros. Co. department store; Vice- President and Director of the Hamilton National Bank of Chattanooga and Standard Coosa-Thatcher Company;and owned controlling stock in the Ross- Hindman and Miller investment companies, the latter firm, of which he was also the Director, established to handle his large realty holdings. His name is on the membership rolls of the Mountain City Club and the Golf and Country Club. The 1910 census lists him as living at 509 Walnut Street, Chattanooga City, with his wife, two youngest children and sister-in-law. The 1920 census lists just him, his wife and youngest daughter at the same residence. His brother Frank died first, on the 28 January 1921, age 60, and the businesses were divided. Gus continued with the retail business, and his son Felix eventually took over for him. In 1922, the Millers of Tennessee mainly under the leadership of Mr. and Mrs. Gustavus Hindman Miller published a book at a great cost of $38,000. The book was titled, The Millers of Millersburg. Millersburg refers to Millersburg, Tennessee. :\\"Some of the boys raised on old Rainey's Creek have gone out into the world and have stood the test that makes them the best there is in manhood. More could be said of the girls. / Take Gus and Frank Miller. They went into the business world, met the greatest business talent, traded with them, and made fortunes....\\" :\\"Tireless energy, keen perception, honesty of purpose, a genius for devising the right thing at the right time, joined to everyday common sense, guided by resistless will power, are the chief characteristics of the man. He has been watchful of all the details of his business and of all indications pointing toward prosperity and from the beginning had an abiding faith in the ultimate success of his enterprise. He has gained wealth, yet it was not alone the goal for which he was striving, and he belongs to that class of representative American citizens who promote the general prosperity while advancing individual interests.\\" His mother died at Walnut Springs, Texas, on the 13th of August, 1923, age 82, just a few months after his stepfather, who died on the 15th June 1923, Bosque Co., TX, age 76, and was buried June 17, 1923, at Walnut Springs, TX. Personal life On January 23, 1879, Gustavus Hindman Miller married Miss Nancy Tennessee Jameson (b. Jan 30 1858, Rutherford co, TN), usually known as Tennessee or Tennie, of Millersburg, daughter of Thomas Hamilton and Catherine (Donnelly) Jameson. Her ancestors have been prominent in the history of both England and America. They were married at the home of her mother, Mrs. Catherine Jameson, near Christiana, Rutherford County, Tennessee. They had seven children, three of whom lived into adulthood. # Claudia Miller. b. 6 May 1880; d. 25 May 1883. # Catherine Miller. b. 30 Mar 1882; d. 05 Apr 1885. # Corrine Miller. b. 10 Dec 1884; d. 17 Apr 1886. # Franklin Lubbock Miller. b. 07 Jul 1886; m. 25 Nov 1908, in Hamilton Co., TN, Oscar Handly of Knoxville, TN. # Gustavus Howells Miller. b. 26 Jun 1889; d. 21 Jul 1893. # Emily Jameson Miller. b. 11 Mar 1896; m. 05 Oct 1920, George Blackwell Smith Jr., of Chattanooga, TN; d. 17 Jan 1978, age 81. # Felix Grundy Miller IV. b. 01 Jul 1898; m. 19 Jun 1919, Phyllis Lancaster of Chattanooga, TN; d.

Gus loved traveling, and drank and gambled when not around Tennie. Phyllis (Lancaster) Miller, like her father- in-law, enjoyed everything. Since her husband was occupied with the business, and Gus was somewhat frail, Phyllis accompanied him on many trips. Gus enjoyed drinks and entertainment, especially gambling in the casinos, as did Phyllis, so they had a good time. In addition to in the mercantile and manufacturing business, Mr Miller was a farmer and cattle raiser. At various times he held timber interests. At the time of his death he owned a farm and country home at Kensington, Ga, and a plantation, St. Albans, near Vicksburg, Miss. G. H. Miller Farm at Kensington, Ga. (Lookout Mountain in background.)

Allies of the President without belonging to his party, Ibarra and Juez became two of the leading \\"transversal\\" figures during the Kirchner Presidency. Luis Alberto Juez (born September 13, 1963) is an Argentine politician who served as Mayor of the City of C√≥rdoba and was later elected to the Senate. Life and times =Early life and career= Luis Juez was born in C√≥rdoba, Argentina, to Adela Losada, the daughter of Spanish Argentine immigrants from A Coru√±a, and Gabriel Juez, the son of Arab Argentine immigrants from Syria. Encouraged by his father, a former Army officer, Juez studied at the General Paz Military Lyceum, though he ultimately opted against a military career, and enrolled at the National University of C√≥rdoba. Juez, whose father had been jailed by the dictatorship that overthrew President Juan Per√≥n in 1955, was active in the Peronist Youth, earning a juris doctor in 1985. He married the former Victoria Corte in 1992, and they had four children. He was appointed to the Provincial Legislature in 1994 to fill a vacancy, and in 1995, was elected on a party list headed by fellow Peronist Jos√© Manuel de la Sota. The body's approval of a bill to raise legislators' salaries amid a recession led to his resignation within a year, however. He ran for the office of Mayor of C√≥rdoba in 1998; but he was defeated in the Justicialist Party primaries by Germ√°n Kammerath, who had received de la Sota's endorsement. De la Sota was elected Governor in 1999, and Juez was appointed Director of the Highway Bureau. Governor de la Sota named Juez Director of the Corruption Prosecution Office in 2000. The appointment proved contentious, however, when the director uncovered evidence of racketeering by, among others, Mayor Kammerath, Public Works Minister Carlos Caserio, and the governor's Chief of Staff (and wife), Olga Ruitort. Lacking support from the governor, Juez resigned on October 10, 2002. His alliance with de la Sota ended, though the latter recognized their 20-year friendship by allowing Juez to step down without formally accepting a resignation, which left Juez's health benefits intact; Juez's youngest daughter had been born premature, and required six months' hospitalization. Juez left the Justicialist Party and established the Partido Nuevo (New Party). He was elected Mayor of C√≥rdoba in 2003, defeating Governor de la Sota's nominee, Alfredo Keegan, by 30 points. Juez became a leading figure in the \\"transversal\\" trend among key center-left elected officials who, without belonging to the Front for Victory of President N√©stor Kirchner, became his allies. Juez expanded numerous city services, though by the end of his tenure, the municipal workforce had doubled, absorbing 74% of the city's us$500 million annual budget. =The 2007 elections= He declined to run for a second term in 2007, and instead became a candidate for governor. He again faced a de la Sota nominee, Vice Governor Juan Schiaretti, as well as UCR candidate Mario Negri, and organized a left-leaning Civic and Social Front with the support of the Broad Front, the Socialist Party and others. The election, on September 2, resulted in a victory for Schiaretti by a margin of 1.17%, however. The election became the most contentious in Argentina that year. Juez alleged electoral fraud when in a protracted, 16-hour ballot machine-counting process at the C√≥rdoba Central Post Office from which the press was barred, overloaded circuit breakers shorted numerous times. He appealed the results, requesting a recount in court for all 6,152 precincts. His campaign was, however, granted a recount in only the 676 precincts with disputed results, and on October 2, Juez appealed to the Supreme Court of Argentina. Ultimately, results certified on October 4 narrowed the difference only slightly to 1.13% (18,000 votes). =Election to the Senate= Juez's earlier rapport with Kirchnerism soured, and in 2009, he ran for the Senate on the Civic Front Alliance party list. Running, as Juez did in 2007, against Peronist and UCR opposition, the Civic Front Alliance prevailed by a narrow margin, sending Juez and fellow Civic Front candidate Norma Morandini to the Senate; both joined the Broad Progressive Front ahead of the 2011 campaign season. He ran again for Governor of C√≥rdoba in the 2011 provincial elections. Juez was defeated, however, by his erstwhile boss and ally, former Governor de la Sota.

She is the author of the books The Autobiography of a Sex-worker (2005) and Romantic Encounters of a Sex Worker (2018). She is the coordinator of the Sex Workers Forum of Kerala (SWFK) and is a member of the five non-governmental organisations (NGO). Biography Nalini Jameela was born on 18 August 1954 in Kallur village, Thrissur, India. She worked in the fields planting and harvesting crops until her husband died of cancer when she was aged 24. This left her with no means of supporting her two young children. A prostitute named Rosechechi introduced her to prostitution. Rosechechi arranged her first client, a senior police officer, and she met him in a guesthouse in Trissur that was frequented by politicians. When leaving the guesthouse in the morning she was arrested by the police and beaten. She had left school after the 3rd grade when she was about seven. In the 1990s she furthered her education at the Kallur Government School, eventually reaching the 12th grade. In 2001 she became coordinator of the Sex Workers Forum of Kerala (SWFK), Under her leadership the SWFK held protest marches to draw attention to the plight of street-based sex workers. Jameela is a member of the five non-governmental organisations (NGO). At the fourth meeting of the AIDS Counselling Program in Bangalore, she called on the government not just to distribute condoms, but to provide an education to sex workers and their children. Works =Autobiography of a Sex Worker= In 2005 Jameela wrote the autobiographical book Oru Lymgikathozhilaliyude Atmakatha (Autobiography of a Sex Worker) with the aid of sex work activist I. Gopinath. The book sold 13,000 copies, ran to six editions within 100 days of publication. Originally written in Malayalam, the book was translated to English in 2007 by J. Devika, and into French the following year by Sophie Bastide-Foltz. The book created massive movements in society, and led to many debates and controversies in Kerala. The book was condemned by feminists, who claimed it glorified sex work, and by conservatives who thought the subject should not be publicised. =Romantic Encounters of a Sex Worker= In 2018 Jameela's second book Romantic Encounters of a Sex Worker was published. The book was translated into English by Reshma Bharadwaj, and also translated into Gujarati, Bengali and Tamil. The book includes eight stories from the 1970s to the 2000s, telling of the relationships she developed with her clients. Documentary Sanjeev Sivan, younger brother of noted film director Santosh Sivan, made a 28-minute documentary film, Sex, Lies and a Book, in 2013 about the life Jameela. The documentary was a joint venture of the United Nations Development Programme (UNDP) and the Public Service Broadcasting Trust. Jameela appeared in the film.

Liber Baptizatorum He entered the Dominican Order in the Dominican Church in Rabat on 3 February 1868, receiving the religious name Angelo. Fra Angelo lived in the Convent of Our Lady of the Grotto in Rabat. After he finished his novitiate year he professed on 3 February 1869. He finished all his studies in philosophy and theology at the Dominican College, Saint Thomas Aquinas in Rabat; in the year 1874 he was ordained priest and, two years following, he took the title of Lecturer of Theology. Study and Early Life Portelli started immediately his career as a scholar at Saint Thomas‚Äô College, in Rabat; during the years 1876-1882 and 1885-1892 he taught various subjects, amongst of which philosophy, theology and the Holy Scripture; during the years 1887-1892 he was Regent of Studies whilst being a master of the novice and students in Rabat as well. In the year 1891 he graduated as Master of Theology. While he was still teaching, the Dominican friars of Vittoriosa, in 1883, elected him as their prior; he did not accept this office whole heartedly in fact he resigned before his term was over. Then he went back to teaching at Saint Thomas‚Äô College in Rabat. Father Portelli was a most righteous religious who loves the convent life, studying and preaching; it was for this reason that as soon as he finished his teaching career, in 1893, he was assigned in the Our Lady of Porto Salvo convent in Valletta. During the years 1896-1902, he was the parish priest, of the Parish of Porto Salvo. Living at the Valletta‚Äôs convent made it easier for father Angelo to reach out other cities and villages and could thus accept more preaching invitations; he was able to preach any sort of sermons; panegyric; lent sermons; conferences; and other sort of sermons for special occasions. He did not only do sermons in Malta but also in various Italian cities like; Rome, Turin, Vercelli, Trani and others. Bishop Father Portelli was also very helpful to the Maltese Dioceses; he was an examiner and magistrate at the curia, he was an examiner of philosophy of the Archbishop‚Äôs seminary; and member of the Diocesan Commission against Modernism. In the year 1910 he was appointed as an Apostolic Visitor to all the Nun‚Äôs Congregations in Malta and Gozo; he finished this assignment at the end of the same year. His acquaintance, his discretion and his ability sustained the faith of the ecclesiastical authorities in him; it could be for this reason that, in 1911, he was appointed as a Titular Bishop of Selinonte and Auxiliary Bishop of Malta. Father Angelo Portelli was consecrated bishop on 14 May 1911; he was offered great help as an Auxiliary Bishop to Mgr. P. Pace who was an old man at that time. After his death in 1914, Bishop Portelli was appointed as Apostolic Administrator to the Maltese Dioceses until, Dom Mauro Caruana was appointed as Bishop of Malta in 1915. During his career, Bishop Portelli made sure of helping people from all type of social class; it was for this reason that he won so much the people‚Äôs sympathy and was loved by everyone. Death Mgr. Porelli died on 19 June 1927, in his personal house, very near to the Dominican convent. The following day he was laid in the Oratory of Good Teaching, very near to his formerly house, where the faithful could pay their last respect. In the morning of 21 June 1927 he was taken to the church of Our Lady of Porto Salvo were a solemn funeral was held, to which the highest authorities of the Church, and those of civil and state authorities attended; in the afternoon, a corteo made up of various distinct personalities took the body of the bishop from the Church of Our Lady of Porto Salvo to City Gate. The funeral came to an end at the Church of Our Lady of The Grotto; where he was buried in a reserved grave for him in the Dominican Church in Rabat.

Kirti Mandir is the memorial house kept in memory of Mohandas Karamchand Gandhi and Kasturba Gandhi located in city of Porbandar, Gujarat, India.Kirti Mandir, Porbandar, GujaratKirti Mandir, Porbandar Kirti Mandir has now been converted into a small museum that displays items used by Gandhiji, along with some really old photographs. The museum houses a library that has books either written by Gandhiji or relating to his philosophies. Visitors can also enter the ancestral house of Gandhiji through the museum. As you enter the house, you will come across the big paintings of Gandhiji and his wife Kasturba, some of which include the rare black and white pictures of the two sharing lighter moments. It has been visited by a number of world leaders who still come here to pay their respects. Background The ancestral house of Gandhi family, where Mahatma Gandhi was born on 2 October 1869 is just adjacent to the Kirti Mandir. At the time when Gandhi was released for the last time in year 1944 from the Aga Khan Palace by the British Government, the residential public of Porbandar had decided to construct an ideal memorial on the birth palace of Mahatmaji. At that time, organization of the project was accomplished by the intensive efforts of the easrtwhile Maharaja of Porbandar, H.H. Maharana Shri Natavarsinhji, and Raj Ratna Shri Nanjibhai Kalidas Mehta and his wife, Smt. Santokbehn Mehta. Before the foundation of the Kirti Mandir was started, the adjacent ancestral house was purchased from those members of the Gandhian family who were living in it. Mahatmaji himself, on his own part had given his consent to Nanjibhai in writing, with legal documents for the sale of the whole building. He had signed with his own hand the registration papers, which are displayed at a museum room in Kirti Mandir Complex. The ancestral house, as such, now forms a part of Kriti Mandir complex. History The original three storied house is built like a Haveli, purchased by the great grand father of Mahatmaji, Shri Harjivan Raidas Gandhi, some two hundred years before, in the seventeenth century, from a local woman and the upper stories were added over the years. It was this house where Gandhi's father Karamchand, uncle, Tulsidas and grandfather Uttamchand lived, who had all been Prime Ministers (Dewan) to the Jethwa Rajput rulers of the princely state of Porbandar. Inside view of Kirti Mandir The foundation stone of modern structure and attractive Kirti Mandir was laid in 1947 during the lifetime of Gandhi by Shree Darbar Gopaldas Desai. The whole credit of constructing this national memorial of Mahatma Gandhi goes to the famous industrialist, Nanjibahi Kalidas Mehta, who not only initiated the idea to build a memorial but also donated the whole money purchase the ancestral house and also to build new complex called Kirti Mandir.Kirthi Mandir, the birth-place of the father of our nation, Mahatma Gandhi, is the main centre of attraction for the tourists. It was built by Shri Nanji Kalidas and Shri Purushottam Mistry. The memorial was completed in 1950, by which time Gandhi was no more. The memorial was named Kirti Mandir and then Home Minister, Sardar Vallabhbhai Patel inaugurated and declared open this place for public on 27 May 1950. Afterwards this beautiful memorial was handed over to the Central Government of India. The height of the temple is of 79 feet symbolizes the 79 years of lifespan of Gandhi. The monument Kirti Mandir is symbol of religious integration of six religions, the architectural elements of Hindu, Buddhist, Jain, Parsi temple, Church and Mosque are symbolized at Kirti Mandir integrate, which symbolize Gandhi's respect towards all religion. The whole the architecture of the Kirti Mandir was done by Shri Prushottambhai Mistry, a resident of Porbandar. He completed construction within two years of time limit by working for days and night himself. Memorial There are life size oil paintings of Mahatma Gandhi and Kasturba kept side by side in the centre of Kirti Mandir.

Under this theory, organised crime exists because legitimate markets leave many customers and potential customers unsatisfied. High demand for a particular good or service (e.g. drugs, prostitution, arms, slaves), low levels of risk detection and high profits lead to a conducive environment for entrepreneurial criminal groups to enter the market and profit by supplying those goods and services. For success, there must be: * an identified market; and, * a certain rate of consumption (demand) to maintain profit and outweigh perceived risks. Under these conditions competition is discouraged, ensuring criminal monopolies sustain profits. Legal substitution of goods or services may (by increasing competition) force the dynamic of organised criminal operations to adjust, as will deterrence measures (reducing demand), and the restriction of resources (controlling the ability to supply or produce to supply).

From 1843 to 1849 further extensions and adaptations were undertaken by hotel owner Josef Scheiflinger. Since that time the hotel has remained a family property. From 1944 to 1945, the building was partially destroyed in World War II and was under Soviet administration until 1955. After the Allied Occupation of Austria, the hotel management was restored to Kommerzialrat Felix Scheiflinger, who had succeeded his father Josef Scheiflinger in 1908. In 1961, the management came to Erika Blumauer, Felix Scheiflinger's daughter, who modernised the house and passes management to her son Reinhard Blumauer in 1973.

The club was initially established in 1987 with the name Ipogeng Stars. As the founder and current president of the club, Andrew Seleka, was a big fan of Real Madrid, he decided to rename the club Real Madrid in 1989. After having ended the 2005‚Äì06 season as fourth, in the Free State province of Vodacom League, they were hit by financial troubles, and had to sell their league status. They underwent a change of ownership in June 2006, after which they gained promotion from the SAB Regional League in 2008. At both seasons in 2008‚Äì09 and 2010‚Äì11, Real Madrid managed to win the Northern Cape province of Vodacom League, but subsequently fell short at the Promotional Play-offs, to also win promotion for the National First Division.

The log listed them with 75 points, being 1 point more than their league rivals Steach United. When the two teams met in spring 2011, the match had been abrupt in second half with the score 2‚Äì2, and after the season, Steach United lodged an appeal to have a replay of the match. SAFA however decided, to let the result achieved on the playing field stand, and thus Real Madrid managed to win the division with 1p ahead of Steach United.

It was Father Simplicien who published a further revision in 1726, following the sudden death of his mentor and collaborator, Father Angel, that year. He himself went on to publish several new volumes, completing the project. Lucas died at the priory of his Order in Paris in 1759.

The film attracted 61,223 admissions in the nation's capital, Seoul.http://www.koreanfilm.org/films2003.html#boxoffice Plot Two friends in the Korean Navy, Lee and Kim are both part of an elite diving squad, specialising in emergency deep sea salvage dives. Lee is strait-laced and takes his duties seriously, while Kim treats the Navy as a lark. When Kang, a diving instructor and Kim's former girlfriend, is posted to the unit, this creates tension between the friends as they compete for Kang's affections. The tension is heightened when Lee is promoted ahead of Kim, creating a rivalry between the two. Kim's gung-ho approach to diving, and the danger he poses for himself (and his fellow divers), leads to further problems. Matters come to a head when an incident at sea causes the sinking of a submarine, requiring the unit to attempt a dangerous salvage rescue of the sunken submarine.

It was first used as a prisoner of war (PoW) camp during World War II, and then became an Army training area. It later housed a Royal Observer Corps (ROC) nuclear monitoring post, and a Regional Government Headquarters (RGHQ). History =Second World War= Nissen huts at Cultybraggan Named PoW camp No 21, built in 1941 to house 4,000 Category A prisoners, Cultybraggan was a 'black camp', holding those considered the most committed and fanatical Nazi PoWs, mainly young Waffen-SS, Fallschirmj√§ger and U-boat crew. Army, Kriegsmarine, Air Force and SS prisoners were held in separate compounds, as were the officers. An additional camp was located at Cowden, two miles distant. Ringleaders of the Devizes plot ‚Äì to break as many as 250,000 PoWs out of camps across the country in 1944 and attack Britain from within ‚Äì were sent to Camp 21 at Comrie. These included Feldwebel Wolfgang Rosterg, a known anti-Nazi who was sent by mistake. He was lynched, and five of the prisoners were hanged at Pentonville Prison for his murder, the largest multiple execution in 20th-century Britain. Amongst the prisoners was Heinrich Steinmeyer, soldier in the Waffen SS since 1942, who was captured in Normandy in August 1944. He died in 2014 and left a bequest of ¬£384,000 to the village which has been put into the Heinrich Steinmeyer Legacy Fund. =Post war= Following the war, in 1949, Cultybraggan was opened as a training camp. It was used by the Regular Army, the Territorial Army and was popular with Cadet units for their annual camps. The camp covered some and could accommodate 600 personnel in a mixture of huts and tents. Units rotating through the camp enabled 80,000 'man training days' of military exercising, including adventure training, cross-country driving, and helicopter operations, using the Tighnablair Training Area, leased from the Drummond Estate. Some of the original 100 Nissen huts on the western side of the camp were demolished in the 1970s to make way for a firing range, but the majority remain. The surviving huts, together with an assault course and modern Officers' Mess facility, make Cultybraggan \\"one of the three best preserved purpose-built WWII prisoner of war camps in Britain\\". In 2006, a number of structures at the camp were listed by Historic Scotland. Huts 19, 20, and 44‚Äì46 are category A listed as being of national significance, while huts 1‚Äì3, 21, 29‚Äì39, and 47‚Äì57 are category B listed. =Cold War= Entrance to the RGHQ bunker within the camp As part of the Cold War defence of the nation, an underground Royal Observer Corps (ROC) monitoring post was installed in 1960. Although it closed in September 1991, when the ROC was stood down, it is still accessible. In 1990, an underground Regional Government Headquarters (RGHQ) bunker was completed in the north east corner of the camp site to replace the Scottish North Zone Headquarters bunker at Troywood (Anstruther). In the event of war, the Secretary of State for Scotland, the BBC, British Telecom, and other important organisations would have operated from here. However, the Cold War threat receded almost as soon as the bunker was completed, and the ¬£3.6 million, two-storey, underground structure was declared obsolete, and closed. Sold to the Army, the bunker was added to the military training facilities. Comrie Development Trust The camp ceased to be used by the military in 2004, and now belongs to the Comrie Development Trust, bought through a community right-to-buy option for ¬£350,000 in 2007./ Since taking ownership of the site on 20 September 2007, the Comrie Development Trust's Cultybraggan Working Group have been working towards the sustainable development of this community asset. Major infrastructure works (drainage, electricity, water and telecoms), the conversion of nine Nissen huts to make 12 units for local businesses and the refurbishment of the central mess are included in the first phase. In 2012 it was reported that a communications firm had purchased the underground bunker at Cultybraggan for use as a \\"digital safe house\\". However, the bid failed and the bunker was put back on the market. In April 2014, the bunker was sold at auction to a service provider who are looking to use it for long term data and media storage.

He received his A.B. and M.A. (1957) degrees from Loyola University of Chicago, and a Ph.D. in English Literature from Fordham University in 1970. Phillips was a member of the Society of Jesus (the Jesuits), and was ordained a priest in 1965. His decision to become a Jesuit at age 17 was strongly affected by his viewing of the film The Keys of the Kingdom (1944) as a boy. Since 1970 Phillips had taught at Loyola University of Chicago. He had written or edited more than 20 books on filmmakers and film (see bibliography); several of these have been reviewed by major newspapers. Phillips had served on juries at the Cannes, Berlin, and Chicago International Film Festivals. He had been a member of the editorial board for the journal Literature/Film Quarterly since its founding in 1973; this journal claims to be \\"the longest standing international journal devoted to the study of adaptation\\" (i.e. the adaptation of literature to film). Phillips had been a prolific author of biographical books on filmmakers, and had published extended interviews with many filmmakers including Alfred Hitchcock, Stanley Kubrick, Fritz Lang, and Joseph Losey. He was also a friend, champion and consultant for director Ken Russell, and author of the book Ken Russell (Twayne Publishers, 1979). Phillips was a consultant for The Devils (Russell, 1971) and famously defended the film against charges of blasphemy saying, in the documentary Hell On Earth - The Desecration and Resurection of The Devils (Mark Kermode, 2002), that the film depicts blasphemy, although it is not itself blasphemous.

The poems date to around the 10th century or the late 12th or early 13th century according to Ifor Williams, as well as other academics. There is a manuscript of the earliest texts of Jesus College 3 (c. 1350) and Red Book of Talgarth (around 1400). The poems consists of 73 stanzas with proverbs that are attributed to characters from Welsh folklore or Welsh saints.  Style  The poems are melodic, with each englyn beginning with the opening phrase \\"Did you hear a hundred...?\\", followed by the name of a character from Welsh tradition, or one of the Welsh saints. The answer is in the form of a traditional proverb, most of which are attributed to characters from Welsh folklore, or Welsh and foreign saints. The exceptions are those given in the mouths of animals. The selection of Welsh characters includes a number of characters from Culhwch and Olwen, and the work as a whole describes a selection of mythical, historical or semi-historical heroes and Christian saints.  History  The poem is a reflection of the antiquarian interest of the 13th and 14th centuries when there was a great deal of collecting, composing and recording of proverbial material by learned Welshmen in a spirit which is compared by Kenneth H. Jackson to the antiquarian mindset that later spurred on the editors of The Myvyrian Archaiology of Wales in the early 19th century.  Cynfarch fab Meirchion  One poem describes a proverb attributed to Cynfarch fab Meirchion of the Hen Ogledd (Old North): > \\"Did you hear Cynfarch sing? 'Bid thy shoulder upon thy horse; And we will > not respect nor revere you.\\" Other heroes include Llywarch Hen, Heledd, Urien Rheged , Gwenddolau and Geraint fab Erbin. From the world of legends there are characters such as Culhwch, Drystan, and Cadriaith mab Seidi . The author has a particular fondness for South Wales saints, including Idloes, David , Padarn , Gwynllyw and Teilo, which suggests he is a native of South Wales.

The questions which epistemologists may ask about any particular belief also apply to religious beliefs and propositions: whether they seem rational, justified, warranted, reasonable, based on evidence and so on. Religious views also influence epistemological theories, such as in the case of Reformed epistemology. Reformed epistemology has developed in contemporary Christian religious epistemology, as in the work of Alvin Plantinga (born 1932), William P. Alston (1921-2009), Nicholas Wolterstorff (born 1932) and Kelly James Clark, as a critique of and alternative to the idea of \\"evidentialism\\" of the sort proposed by W. K. Clifford (1845-1879). Alvin Plantinga, for instance, is critical of the evidentialist analysis of knowledge provided by Richard Feldman and by Earl Conee. D. Z. Phillips (1934-2006) takes this further and says that the argument of the reformed epistemologists goes further and challenges a view he dubs \\"foundationalism\\": Much work in recent epistemology of religion goes beyond debates over foundationalism and reformed epistemology to consider contemporary issues deriving from social epistemology (especially concerning the epistemology of testimony, or the epistemology of disagreement), or formal epistemology's use of probability theory. Other notable work draws on the idea that knowing God is akin to knowing a person, which is not reducible to knowing propositions about a person., and Some work in recent epistemology of religion discusses various challenges from psychology, cognitive science or evolutionary biology to the rationality or justification of religious beliefs. Some argue that evolutionary explanations of religious belief undermine its rationality. Others responded to these arguments.

Biography  William Robinson Leigh was born on September 23, 1866 at Maidstone Manor Farm, Berkeley County, West Virginia. He entered the Maryland Institute for the Promotion of the Mechanic Arts (now known as Maryland Institute College of Art) at age 14, then attended the Royal Academy in Munich. He returned to the United States after twelve years abroad and worked painting cycloramas and as a magazine illustrator. An example is the cover illustration of the August 4, 1904 Leslie's Weekly featuring a policeman \\"Piloting Children to Safety at a Crowded New York Crossing.\\" He married twice, and fathered William Colston Leigh, Sr. (1901‚Äì1992).Descendants of Ferdinando Leigh, Dick Purser, undated His first wife was Anna Seng Leigh, mother of his son, their marriage ended in a divorce sometime before 1906. His second wife was Ethel Traphagen Leigh (1883‚Äì1963), was the founder of Traphagen School of Fashion in New York City. In 1906, Leigh traveled to the American West and maintained a studio in New York City. In 1926 he travelled to Africa at the invitation of Carl Akeley for the American Museum of Natural History, and from this experience wrote and illustrated Frontiers of Enchantment: An Artist's Adventures in Africa. In 1933, he wrote and illustrated The Western Pony. His adventures were chronicled in a number of popular magazines including Life, the Saturday Evening Post, and Colliers. He is known for painting the Grand Canyon and Yellowstone National Park, but his primary interest were the Hopi and Navajo Indians. In 1953 he was elected into the National Academy of Design as an Associate member and became a full Academician in 1955. Leigh also made astrobiological art for the March 1908 issue of Cosmopolitan, with four full- page illustrations of an article written by H. G. Wells, \\"The Things that Live on Mars\\", which speculated about Martian life.

It was released by M√©li√®s's Star Film Company and is numbered 110 in its catalogues. The film, one of a series of events related to the Greco- Turkish War of 1897, is set on the gun deck of a man-of-war ship under attack. In reality, there were no naval clashes during the war. Synopsis A naval officer calls his sailors to the deck to assemble around the cannon while he scans the horizon, when the ship is suddenly hit and one of the sailors is injured. Production The film is notable for the deck's realistic pitch- and-toss rolling motion, achieved using an articulated film set that rocked side-to-side in front of a stationary camera. This scenic special effect, which M√©li√®s recreated soon after in his film Between Calais and Dover using the same moving platform, allowed for a degree of realism highly unusual for the time. M√©li√®s himself appears in the film as the officer. The film was shot outside in the garden of M√©li√®s's property in Montreuil, Seine-Saint-Denis, with painted scenery.

The model was developed by Isaac Held and Arthur Hou in 1980. The essence of the model is that air rising from the surface at the equator conserves its angular momentum as it moves poleward. This distribution of wind, in turn, determines the distribution of temperature, which determines the latitudinal extent of the circulation by requiring energy conservation. This stands in contrast to George Hadley's original conception of the circulation, which he argued reached the poles. The Hadley circulation has a cooling effect at and near the equator and a warming effect at higher latitudes within the Hadley Cell. This energy transport can be converted into a mass transport, to determine the strength of the circulation, by normalizing by the appropriate vertical stability. The effects of moisture and seasons on the model have been studied. Earth's atmosphere violates the underlying assumptions of the model: angular momentum is not conserved and the tropical atmosphere is not energetically closed.

The court ruled there was a 90:10 split of ownership in favour of the main child-caring partner who contributed 80% of the equity to the home in which she lived. The non-resident partner had also ceased to pay bills and maintenance for the children for a considerable time. Facts Ms Jones and Mr Kernott met in 1980. In 1981 Ms Jones bought a caravan with the help of a bank loan, and in 1984 Mr Kernott moved into the caravan with her upon the birth of their first child. In May 1985 Ms Jones sold her caravan, and the parties bought 39 Badger Hall Avenue, Thundersley in Essex, for ¬£30,000. Ms Jones contributed ¬£6,000, and the balance was raised by an interest-only mortgage. The house was conveyed into their joint names. From this point on they shared payment of the household bills and the mortgage. In 1986 the couple's second child was born. The parties took out a loan for ¬£2,000 for an extension which was mostly constructed by Mr Kernott. In 1993 the couple separated, and Mr Kernott left Badger Hall Avenue. He stopped paying his share of the bills, and contributed little or nothing towards the maintenance of the children. In May 1996 the parties cashed in a life insurance policy and divided the proceeds. With his share of these Mr Kernott bought 114 Stanley Road, Benfleet in Essex, for ¬£57,000. In May 2006 Mr Kernott sought payment (realisation) of his alleged half-share in Badger Hall Avenue. Ms Jones responded by claiming under the Trusts of Land and Appointment of Trustees Act 1996 (TOLATA) for a declaration that she owned the entire beneficial interest in the property. Judge Dedman, after considering Oxley v Hiscock [2005] Fam 211 and Stack v Dowden [2007] 2 AC 432, held that while the interests of the parties at the outset might well have been that the property should be split jointly, those intentions had altered significantly over the years. He considered that the correct test was therefore what was \\"fair and just\\" between the parties, taking into account the whole course of dealing between them. He concluded, taking into account Mr Kernott's ceasing to pay any bills, the fact that Ms Jones contributed over 80% of the equity, and the lack of assistance provided by Mr Kernott relating to the maintenance of the children, that the correct split would be 90:10 in favour of Ms Jones. Judgment =High Court= The appeal from the decision of Judge Dedman in the Southend on Sea County Court on 21 April 2008 was heard on 12 May 2009, judgment handed down on 10 July 2009, by Mr Nicholas Strauss QC in the High Court of Justice, Chancery Division who dismissed the appeal, as before awarding beneficiary shares in the Badger Hall Avenue house to Jones and Kernott in the ratio of 90:10.[2009] EWHC Ch 1713 =Court of Appeal= On 26 May 2010, Her Majesty's Court of Appeal in England upheld the appeal, finding that the house was held in shares of 50/50.On 26 May 2010 Rimer LJ gave the judgment. =Supreme Court= On 9 November 2011, the Supreme Court of the United Kingdom, overturning the Court of Appeal, held that Mr Kernott and Ms Jones would hold the shares in the house on trust in a ratio of 10% to 90%, to reflect their contributions to the home. Although the Supreme Court unanimously reached the decision, their Lordships concurred on different grounds. Lord Walker, Lady Hale and Lord Collins concluded that there are situations where it would be permissible to impute common intention, while Lord Kerr and Lord Wilson preferred to base their opinions on the fact that the court had the discretion to acknowledge constructive trust in such a manner because it was fair. Lord Kerr said the following. Lord Wilson said the following.

It is one of the old Russian folk art handicrafts, which is produced in and around the town of Kargopol, Arkhangelsk Oblast, in the north of Russia. It started in the 19th century in the areas west of Kargopol. The potters were not professionals, but just peasants who made toys in their spare time. A notable toy-maker in the beginning of the 20th century was Ivan Druzhinin (1887-1949). The handicraft almost became extinct in the 1930s. In the 1950s only one artist, Ulyana Babkina (1889-1977), was making the toys. Eventually, Babkina's toys received all-Russian recognition, were noticed by the Russian Artist Union, and the handicraft was revived. Currently, bright colors (white, red, yellow, black) are typically used, in contrast to the old masters, who used the colored clay and produced toys in rather reserved colors. Kargopol toys are typically single characters, and very seldom they represent a group of two or three characters. The front of a toy gets more decoration, and the toys are thus oriented to the front view. A singular character of Kagopol toys is a Polkan which is a combination of a human and a horse.

It is a chorale cantata performed on Trinity Sunday 8 June 1727 in Leipzig.Texte zur Leipziger Kirchen-Music auf die Heiligen Pfingst-Feyertage und das Fest der H. Dreyfaltigkeit 1727. Leipzig: Immanuel Tietzen, 1727. Quoted in \\"Recent Discoveries in St Petersburg and their Meaning for the Understanding of Bach‚Äôs Cantatas\\" by Tatiana Shabalina, pp. 77-99 in Understanding Bach 4, 2009 Rediscovery of the printed libretto of the cantata in the first decade of the 21st century led to a re-appraisal of prior assumptions regarding the early performance chronology of a few cantatas, including this one.Bach Digital Work at The text of the cantata is a general praise of the Trinity, without a reference to a specific gospel reading. Addressing God the Creator, the Saviour and the Comforter, it could be used for other occasions such as Reformation Day. The cantata is festively scored and ends in a chorale fantasia, like the Christmas Oratorio.  History and words  The cantata was apparently composed for Trinity Sunday. Originally it was thought the cantata may have been performed as early as 16 June 1726. In his second year Bach had composed chorale cantatas between the first Sunday after Trinity of 1724 and Palm Sunday 1725, but for Easter that year he had returned to cantatas on more varied texts, possibly because he lost his librettist. Later Bach composed again chorale cantatas which may have been intended to complete his second annual cycle. This cantata was possibly one of such completing works. Rediscovery of the printed libretto of the cantata in the first decade of the 21st century led to a re-appraisal of prior assumptions regarding the first performance of this cantata: it was performed on Trinity Sunday 8 June 1727. The cantata may also have been performed on Reformation Day. The cantata is based entirely on the unchanged words on the hymn (1665) by Johann Olearius and celebrates the Trinity in five stanzas. The prescribed readings for Trinity Sunday were from the Epistle to the Romans, reflecting \\"depth of wisdom\\" (), and from the Gospel of John, the meeting of Jesus and Nicodemus (). Unlike most chorale cantatas of 1724/25, but similar to the early , and , also composed after the second cantata cycle, Bach left the chorale text unchanged, thus without a reference to the readings.  Scoring and structure  The cantata in five movements is festively scored for three soloists, soprano, alto and bass, a four-part choir, three trumpets, timpani, flauto traverso, two oboes, oboe d'amore, two violins, viola, and basso continuo. # Coro: # Aria (bass): # Aria (soprano): # Aria (alto): # Chorale:  Music  The opening chorus on the first stanza of the chorale begins with a concerto of all the instruments as a ritornello. The trumpets highlight occasionally the interplay of strings and woodwinds. The cantus firmus, a melody of by Ahasverus Fritsch (1679), is sung by the soprano, while the other voices sing sometimes in imitation, sometimes in homophony. The text is a praise of the God the Creator. The following three movements are all arias. In the first aria the bass praises God the Saviour, accompanied only by the continuo. Bach may have thought of the (voice of Christ), and of his humility. The word \\"\\" (praised) is set as an expressive melisma. In the second aria the soprano, accompanied by flute and violin, praises God the Comforter. In the third aria the alto is accompanied by an oboe d'amore in song-like general praise. John Eliot Gardiner suggests that the \\"pastoral dance\\" was \\"inspired, perhaps in its imagery, by the concept of \\"\\" (praised by all things that move in the air). The final chorale is set in a joyful concerto of the instruments, similar to the conclusions of Bach's Christmas Oratorio and Ascension Oratorio. Gardiner calls it \\"punctuated by brass and orchestral fanfares.\\" By this festive ending Bach marked Trinity Sunday as the conclusion of the first part of the liturgical year.  Recordings  * J. S.

Brandeis focused on ensuring that Shaker art in Kentucky was recorded in the Index of American Design. She knew that the Shaker community near Harrodsburg, Kentucky was closed, and that furniture and other items were being auctioned off. In order to keep a record of the Shaker's furniture, weaving, clothing, and other work, Brandeis arranged for four artists to lodge in Harrodsburg and document the surviving Shaker arts for the Index. The materials in the Index informed the later reconstruction of Shakertown. Brandeis was the Director of Louisville Art Association in 1937.John F. Folinsbee Art Trust site, 2007. In 1911 Brandeis presented a paper on \\"The Development of Art in Cincinnati\\" to the Women's Club of Louisville, where she highlighted the crucial role women had played in promoting art in Cincinnati. She encouraged her listeners to work toward the establishment of an art museum and art school in Louisville, which would then lead to greater development of the arts in Louisville. Brandeis wrote for the Louisville Courier-Journal starting in 1945. Among other jobs, she did research for the editorial page. She was the first woman to be nominated to the Board of Trustees of the University of Louisville and served various Kentucky art organizations.

Analytic feminists have attempted to rehabilitate certain key concepts, such as truth, reason, objectivity, agency and autonomy, both because they are normatively compelling as well as in some ways liberating and empowering for women. Not limited to these concepts, analytical feminism has contributed to the historical arena of analytic philosophy such as the philosophy of language, epistemology, metaphysics and the philosophy of science. In 1995, the American philosophical magazine Hypatia published a special issue clarifying the meaning of analytic feminism in the mainstream Anglo-American analytical context and in the range of feminist philosophical positions. In this issue, the authors such as Ann Cudd of the University of Kansas, Ann Garry of California State University Los Angeles, and Lynn Hankinson Nelson of the University of Washington proposed that analytic feminism typically was unrecognized and somewhat depreciated by not only analytical philosophers but academic feminist agenda as well. Considered a sub-category of both analytic philosophy and feminism, analytic feminism acknowledges the philosophical traditions of both fields while simultaneously addressing prominent issues within said fields. Philosophical approach Analytical feminism, as defined by Ann E. Cudd: \\"Analytic feminism holds that the best way to counter sexism and androcentrism is through forming a clear conception of and pursuing truth, logical consistency, objectivity, rationality, justice, and the good while recognising that these notions have often been perverted by androcentrism throughout the history of philosophy.\\" (1996: 20) Analytic feminists engage the literature traditionally thought of as analytic philosophy, but also draw on other traditions in philosophy as well as work by feminists working in other disciplines, especially sociology and biology. They, like most analytic philosophers, value clarity and precision in argument and tend to use more rigorously structured logical and linguistic analysis in reaching their conclusions and positions as compared to other philosophical approaches. The majority of philosophers, including feminist philosophers, have at least some formal training in analytic philosophy, with some possessing extensive education and experience regarding analyticity. There has been a conscious effort to use the word ‚Äòanalytical‚Äô, the reason being that within the field of philosophy there is sometimes an inclination to assume all feminist work as tied to other methods to philosophy, whereas upon review much of the work in feminism is closer in method to analytic conventions. According to most analytic feminists, the best method for scholars to counter sexism and androcentrism in their respective areas of inquiry is by forming a clear conception of and practicing logical consistency and neutrality. =Doctrines= Even though analytical feminists retain only some traditional concepts, it is not doctrinaire‚Äîindeed, there is even a spirit of contrarianism within it. Nevertheless, analytic feminists share a thing that we may call a \\"core desire\\" rather than a core principle, that is to say, the need to hold on to enough of the essential normative notions of the modern European tradition to aid the kind of normativity which is necessary for both feminist political theory and philosophy. This \\"core desire\\" finds its appearance by means of the core concepts of analytical feminism. =Bridge building= Analytic feminists' use of core ideas and their excerpt to the work of traditional analytic philosophers permit them to communicate with and build bridges amongst different types of scholars, for example, traditional analytic philosophers, other feminist philosophers, and, in some cases, scientists or scholars in social studies. =Reconstructing philosophy= One tenet of analytic feminism holds that if philosophers positions are applicable universally, they must be usable by men and women alike, and from a range of social situations. This is a basis for what can be considered the reconstruction of philosophy via analytic feminism. This approach, which somewhat mirrors the construction of feminist philosophy tradition, attempts to limit the creation of areas or categories of philosophy that apply to only some women and feminists. It's an attempt to apply to 'all' (men and women) instead of 'some' (women and/or feminists) with specific examples of topics being feminine ethics, gynocentric ethics, or lesbian ethics. The basis for this universal approach would be an analytic feminist ethics and metaphysics which would create and establish a new criterion of adequacy for the fields of ethics and metaphysics. The goal of Miranda Fricker and Jennifer Hornsby, editors of The Cambridge Companion to Feminism in Philosophy, is to have this position included in the mainstream of the discipline (Fricker and Hornsby 2000). Not basing the approach on any 'essential' characteristics, be they experiences or otherwise, it can maintain the importance of a variety of perspectives, while crafting a 'working' theory. 'Working' is defined as being particularly inclusive, of both men and women, but also simultaneously eliminating oppressive consequences. A wide range of experiences, interests, and background must be reflected with the theory 'working' only if it is applicable to all these issues and concerns. There are a variety of approaches regarding the reconstruction of philosophy within analytic feminism. Some philosophers, such as Bailey (Bailey 2010) and Gary (Garry 2012), include the use of intersectionality in their approach. Miranda Fricker (2007) and Kristie Dotson (2011) make use of concept of Privilege (social inequality) in theirs, particularly with regard to epistemic ignorance and epistemic injustice. In 2018, Alice Crary offered a critique of some of these recent trends in analytic feminism.Crary, Alice. \\"The methodological is political: What‚Äôs the matter with ‚Äòanalytic feminism‚Äô?\\" Radical Philosophy RP 2.02, June 2018  References   External links  * Stanford Encyclopedia of Philosophy: Analytic Feminism * Analytic Feminism at Central APA June 12, 2011 * Paper on Analytic Feminism * The Fordham Law School Institutional Repository -Rethinking Emotional Distress Law: Prenatal Malpractice and Feminist Theory * APA Newsletter * Category:Social theories Category:Analytic philosophy ","title":"Analytical feminism"},{"id":"32080438","text":"This is a list of African poets.

Moyle, a left footed wingman, played his early football at Haileybury College and the Oakleigh Chargers in the TAC Cup. He came to St Kilda through the rookie draft and was nominated for the 2000 AFL Rising Star when he had 26 kicks against the Sydney Swans in round 16.AFL Tables: Brett Moyle The following year he suffered a broken leg mid-season but came back eight rounds later to finish with 15 games for the season, from which he averaged a career high 17 disposals. Complications from a corked thigh meant he missed the first nine weeks of the 2002 AFL season but he missed only one more game for the rest of the year. He then found it hard to keep his spot in the St Kilda team, who were bringing in younger players, meaning he spent much of his time at Springvale After leaving St Kilda, Moyle finished his playing career with the Balwyn Football Club, where he was from 2005 to 2009, during which time he also served as an assistant coach. He was a member of their 2005 and 2008 premiership teams, the latter as captain.Maroondah Leader, \\"Saints accelerate coaching ambition\\", 27 September 2009, Chris Vernuccio He was then appointed senior coach of North Ringwood for the 2010 Eastern Football League season.

The prisoners were brought to build road network Canala-Bourail- Boulouparis. It overlooks Teremba Bay (Uarai Bay), opposite the mouth of the La Foa River, 124 kilometres north of Noumea. The fort was further strengthened following the revolt by Kanak people against the French Colonial rule, in 1878, when they had besieged the prison. The fort was closed in 1898. History The construction of a military fort and a prison along the Bay Uarai began in 1871 at the request of the Governor Eug√®ne Gaultier de la Richerie and sent a contingent of twenty-five convicts, with two supervisors and three policemen. The fort was built by the convict labour. The camp was renamed Fort T√©remba by reference to the island T√©remba which is in the middle of the bay. A small town was set around the camp, with a registry office, a library, a church, a school, post office, a telegraph, a market place and a wharf. After construction of the fort, while men were incarcerated at the newly built Fort Teremba, women prisoners were kept at a prison at Fonwhary (also Panwhary) 6 km away to the north of La Foa. At a time, the prison housed 200 prisoners in the shacks (built with \\"cob stones\\") outside the fort walls, who were engaged in building roads, bridges and buildings. The Kanak revolt started at La Foa, the \\"gendarmes\\" inside the fort were killed, and the revolt spread further south. However, the fort was never taken and at the time it was still in very good condition. After the revolt of 1878, the military fort was redesigned and strengthened to serve as bunkers and possible refuge. To counter the power of the colonial administration, the governor Pallu de la Barri√®re subsequently decided to employ the convicts in the construction of roads and infrastructure. In 1885, the fort came under the control of the prison administration. However, the fort was abandoned in 1897‚Äì98 as deportations came to an end. By 1906, the fort had fallen into neglect; one author commenting in this year talked of the \\"repulsive-looking barracks, so grim and grotesque, and smelling so damp and fusty\\". Having long been neglected, Fort T√©remba was finally restored by the action of the local Association Marguerite in 1984 who have set up the \\"Heritage Interpretation Center, and military prison in New Caledonia\\" spread over 11 ha site. The municipality have bought the site in 1987. The main building was reconstructed and houses a permanent exhibition on the history of the fort. The watchtower, a high stone wall and a guillotine are moot witness to the history of the fort. The circular tower of the fort provides nice vistas of Teremba Bay and the neighbourhood. The fort is approached from RT1 road, 14 km west of La Foa and then along a path of about 3 km to reach the fort. In 1989 the site was classified as a historical monument. Every year, a light and sound show depicting scenes of life at the time, attracted a wide audience. The theme of the show presented for two hours is on the history of fort, the prison and the Kanak revolt, which is enacted by 180 artists (of various historical figures) which is concluded with a very impressive display of fireworks in the backdrop of the fort.

Early life and family He was born in Leeds as Philip Christian von Schunck, the son of Mary Illingsworth and John Edward, Baron von Schunk (1869‚Äì1940), a landowner who renounced his title before the First World War. Christian's paternal grandfather, Edward, Baron von Schunck, had been born in Leipzig, part of an old German family that had, since 1715, held a Barony in the Holy Roman Empire (Freiherr). He settled in Britain and married Kate Lupton, who had been born into the progressive, land-owning and political Lupton family and educated at the school of her relative Rachel Martineau.Lupton, C.A. , The Lupton Family in Leeds, Wm. Harrison and Son 1965. Edward died in 1889. Kate survived him until 1913, the eve of the First World War, and insisted in her will that their only son ‚Äì John Edward, Baron von Schunck ‚Äì change his surname to that of her father, Darnton Lupton, the former Mayor of Leeds. Thus he and his children acquired by Royal Licence the surname Darnton. Christian Darnton's father, John Edward, had two sisters; one of whom ‚Äì Florence von Schunck ‚Äì had married Albert Kitson, 2nd Baron Airedale of Gledhow Hall, near Leeds in 1890. Baroness von Schunck (n√©e Kate Lupton, d. 1913), lived at the adjacent Gledhow Wood Estate which was where she hosted the wedding breakfast of her daughter and son-in-law. The family was extremely well-off and he was educated at home by a governess until he was nine, when he began composing; his musical talents being \\"obvious\\" by the time he went up to Gonville and Caius College, Cambridge in 1924. Darnton's teachers included Charles Wood and Cyril Rootham at Cambridge, and Harry Farjeon at the Royal Academy of Music, where he became friendly with his fellow student Walter Leigh. In 1928 he also spent a year studying with Max Butting in Berlin.Darnton, (Philip) Christian, by Andrew Plant, Grove Music Online, 2001 Career and composition Darnton first came to the general public's attention as a composer on 30 March 1927 when his parents financed a whole evening of music for their 21-year-old son at the Grotrian Hall in London. Although he had been receiving other performances independently (including one of his Octet at the same hall four days earlier), the event had the unintended effect of straining his relationships with other composers and critics. Peter Warlock and Cecil Gray in particular went along to disrupt the proceedings, viewing it as an example of unmerited privilege. The concert included his first string quartet, op 23, and the highly chromatic first piano sonata, op 33 (both composed in 1925). The project was widely criticised in the press - the critic in The Times wrote: \\"it does not amuse us to listen to his amateur modernisms, and we decline to take him seriously until he has shown that he has mastered the laws of music\\"The Times, 1 April 1927, p 12 \\\\- and the criticism prompted Darnton's further course of study in Berlin with Max Butting from 1928. The influence of Butting on Darnton is clear: Butting believed that \\"music is the expression of social perceptions\\" and (like Darnton in later life) his composition style showed a dualism of musical thought between austere uncompromising atonalism (as in the Symphony No 3 of 1928) and a more transparent, simplified style intended for mass consumption over the radio (as in the Sinfonietta, also 1928). After a short spell teaching at Stowe School, Darnton turned to journalism, while continuing to compose. But he had to wait until the mid-1930s before his music started to gain performances and a greater level of interest. The BBC Symphony Orchestra played his Viola Concerto with soloist Bernard Shore (who commissioned the work) conducted by Iris Lemare, on 15 April 1936.Radio Times, Issue 654, 10 April 1936, p 42 On 4 February 1938 the same orchestra played Swansong, five songs for soprano and orchestra, setting poems by Robert Nichols, with soloist May Blyth and Constant Lambert conducting.Lloyd, Stephen. Constant Lambert: Beyond the Rio Grande, 2015 1939 saw his first real critical success with a performance of the forward-looking Five Orchestral Pieces at the International Society for Contemporary Music Festival in Warsaw. In July 1940 Darnton's book You and Music was published as one of the new sixpenny Pelican series of mass- market non-fiction paperbacks aimed at general readers (it is No 68). Reviews were generally positive until Percy Scholes (in a May 1941 Musical Times essay) catalogued so many serious and obvious errors (such as ‚ÄúBinary form may be represented by A.B.A.‚Äù) that he presented the work as an elaborate joke to trap unwary reviewers. Perhaps the most interesting part of the book, beyond the non-technical explanations of music history, theory, form and orchestration, is the criticisms it contains of modern music. For instance, Darnton challenges the term \\"English Musical Renaissance\\", feeling England had produced no \\"composer of international consequence\\" in that period. Darnton joined the Communist Party of Great Britain in 1941. His Communist views led to an abrupt simplification of his musical language as he searched for a more popular, accessible style, but his views may have later hurt his popularity and led to his becoming relatively obscure. The BBC would not broadcast his 1942 cantata Ballad of Freedom (words by Randall Swingler) for reasons of national security.Croft, Andy. Comrade Heart: A Life of Randall Swingler, 2003 But the overture Stalingrad chimed well enough with the country's sympathies at the time, and received its premiere at the Royal Albert Hall in March 1943. For a few years towards the end of the war Darnton scored a series of patriotic documentary films for the war effort, such as A Harbour Goes to France, produced by the Ministry of Information in 1944, later the basis of the orchestral suite Atlantic After the war, Darnton's works included the cantata Jet Pilot and the opera Fantasy Fair, both examples of his more populist style. But disillusioned by his lack of recognition he turned his back on composition from the mid-1950s for two decades. Then came a remarkable renewal (and the return of his dissonant, avant garde style) including the Concerto for Orchestra (1970‚Äì73), the String Quartet No 4 (1973) and the Symphony No 4 (1975-8), which had its premiere in September 1981, six months after the composer's death.Denis ApIvor: ‚ÄòChristian Darnton‚Äô, Composer, no.74 (1981‚Äì2), 13‚Äì19Plant, Andrew. Christian Darnton, 1905-1981, MusicWeb International Personal life Christian Darnton met his first wife, the artist Joan Mary Bell (1905‚Äì2001), while he was in Germany. They married in November 1929 and had two sons. While working in civil defence during the war, he suffered a fall that some have interpreted as a suicide attempt, after which his marriage failed. Darnton then had an affair with Elisabeth Balchin, the wife of novelist Nigel Balchin. Balchin responded by caricaturing Darnton in his 1945 novel Mine Own Executioner.Collett, Derek (2015). His Own Executioner: The Life of Nigel Balchin. SilverWood. . (In the novel the character Stephen is a self-centred poet described as ‚Äúbig and handsome and haunted and so like a creative artist that you wouldn‚Äôt have thought he‚Äôd have the nerve to go around looking like that.‚Äù) He married his second wife, the dancer Vera Blanche Martin, in 1953.

Early life Peter J. Desnoyers was born in Paris, France on August 1, 1772, the son of Charles Roquiley Desnoyers and his wife Charlotte (Mallet) Desnoyers. He worked as a silversmith for his father until he was 18 years old. At that time, his father purchased for him some land from the Sciota Land Company, an American firm who was advertising in Paris for artists and artisans to emigrate. The younger Desnoyers set sail to America with other French citizens, arriving in 1790 in Gallipolis, Ohio, where their lands were supposed to be located. It turned out, however, that the land deal was a swindle, and their deeds were worthless. Life in Detroit A few of the settlers remained, but Desnoyers moved on to Pittsburgh, and in 1796 accompanied General Anthony Wayne's army to Detroit. There he worked as an armorer for the government under Jean Fran√ßois Hamtramck. On July 30, 1798, Desnoyers married Marie Louise Gobeille. The couple had twelve children: Peter (born April 21, 1800; died 1880), Marie Louise Rose (born November 12, 1801), Charles Chrysologus (born 1803; died 1804), Emilie (born July 29, 1805; died 1838), Marie Madeleine (born 1807; died 1808), Victoire (born February 12, 1809; died 1863), Charles Robert (born July 7, 1811; died 1846), Francis Xavier (born 1813), Elizabeth (born August 1, 1815; died 1895), Ann Caroline (born 1818; died 1822), Josephine Sylvie (born May 28, 1821), and Marie Antoinette (born 1827; died 1834). Desnoyers continued as an armorer until 1803, when he went into business as a silversmith. However, the great Detroit fire of 1805 destroyed his store and stock. After the fire, Desnoyers rebuilt, this time constructing a building that housed both a general store and silversmithing works. He ran both businesses until 1822, when he turned his attention wholly to the general mercantile business. Desnoyers retired from his business in 1835 and remained in Detroit. Public Service Desnoyers served in a number of positions of public trust. He was one of the first Trustees on the Board of Regents of the University of Michigan. He served a number of terms as a city alderman, and was director and president of the Bank of Michigan. He died on June 3, 1846 at his home in Detroit.

The engine was constructed in 1777 and worked until 1848. The engine is most obviously known simply for being an early example of an engine built by Boulton and Watt. However it also played a far more important role in the development of steam engines for being the first engine designed to work with an early cutoff, and so to use the expansion of the steam for greater efficiency. It is now preserved in the Power Gallery of the Science Museum, London. It is the oldest surviving Watt engine, and the third-oldest surviving beam engine.  Watt's previous Kinneil Engine  Watt's first engine at Kinneil had been unsuccessful and the parts were taken down and re-used at Boulton's Soho Manufactory in Birmingham. The reworked engine was more successful there, and encouraged Boulton to invest further in this developing steam technology and in Watt's inventions. The Manufactory had been built to use a water wheel to drive its machinery, and the site had been chosen on that basis, but there were concerns over seasonal lack of water to power the wheel. Similar problems in the iron industry had inspired the development of the water-returning engine: a steam pump that could raise water to drive the wheel, in times of low water on the river. The Kinneil Engine had been built as a pump, for use in a coal mine, and so was suitable for this new task. Watt's rotative beam engine had not yet been considered and so the only way to produce rotary work to drive machinery in the Manufactory was by water power. In 1777 Boulton and Watt decided to build a second engine for use at Soho, either to supplement the Kinneil Engine or primarily to experiment with Watt's new idea of expansive working of the steam. The new engine was also to be a water-returning engine Like the earlier Newcomen engines, it was only capable of pumping water rather than driving machinery directly.  Working life  = Construction = As early as 1769, Watt was considering the possibility of working steam expansively, as recorded in a letter of 28 May to Dr. Small. Early engines were incapable of this, as they used a single valve for both inlet and exhaust. As Watt had already begun to use separate valves for each function, it would now be possible to control their timing independently, i.e. to apply lead to the timing of the inlet valve. Watt decided to construct a new engine to demonstrate this principle and was confident of the substantial savings in coal consumption to be offered.Letter to Gilbert Meason, 24 April 1777, Boulton & Watt colln. Construction began in 1777 with the ordering of a 33-inch cylinder (84 cm). The engine was erected and working at Soho by August, although still incomplete. The engine always worked as a water pump and was equipped with two cast iron cylinders at opposite ends of the beam, one for the working cylinder and one for the pump. The pump cylinder was taller and thinner, of diameter and tall, designed for a working stroke within this, although only was used in practice. The pumped water was delivered at a head of . The engine was later described as being of 30 hp in power. The beam was typical for early single-acting beam engines, pulling through wrought iron chains running over a curved arch-head at each end of the beam. At some later point, possibly when reconstructed after the fire, this beam was strengthened by being strutted and bridled with the additional timber and iron triangular trusses that are seen above the beam today. = Beelzebub = Initial operation of the engine was unsatisfactory. Watt was away in Cornwall and Boulton wrote to him, describing the engine's actions as \\"very fierce\\".Letter to Watt, 18 August 1777, Boulton & Watt colln. His opinion was that the engine's cylinder was too large for the work expected of it. This led to it being worked at a pressure of around 5.7 psi, whereas if it were operating at 8 psi, it would be less jerky and violent. This action was so remarkable as to give the engine its initial nickname of Beelzebub. Neither Watt nor Boulton had a solution to the engine's behaviour. Watt's experience with the Chacewater engine, a rebuilt Smeaton engine, at Wheal Busy, suggested that cutoff led to a violent action. In September he recommended throttling the steam supply to the engine.Letter to Boulton, 20 September 1777, Boulton & Watt colln. Boulton favoured further experimentation with cutoff (i.e. valve timing) and in 1779 suggested that a series of more scientific measurements be tried. With hindsight, Boulton's approach was the more thermodynamically efficient, although this lesson was not fully appreciated by locomotive drivers right to the end of steam power. = Fire and reconstruction = One morning in July 1778 the engine house was discovered to be on fire. The fire spread rapidly and within half an hour the roof was burned to the ground. The timberwork and soldered copper piping of the engine were also destroyed or damaged. Even the beam itself, a substantial timber construction, was \\"rendered unfit\\" by the fire. Fortunately the most important part of the engine, its cylinder, survived the fire relatively intact. Within three weeks the engine had been reconstructed and was expected to be working again shortly. While the engine had been damaged, Watt, who was once again away in Cornwall, had advised that \\"no repair farther that the roof ought to be gone about at present\\", with his intention being to reconstruct the engine in some improved manner. The nature of these reconstructions, and their effectiveness, remains unclear. By 1781, the engine had been working in its reconstructed form for some years. Whatever the improvements had been, they left Watt and Boulton still agreeing that this was, \\"one of the worst engines they had\\".Letter from Watt to Boulton, 1781, Boulton & Watt colln.  Closure of the Mint and preservation  The engine operated at the Soho Mint, until the mint's closure in 1848. It was sold for ¬£48, then re-sold for ¬£58 and placed on display on an island in Derrington Pool, outside the metal-rolling works of its new owner, a Mr. Walker. Although much of the Mint's coining machinery had been re-sold for further use at the new Birmingham Mint, this aged and thoroughly obsolete engine appears to have been one of the first artefacts of industrial archaeology to be deliberately preserved. The engine was later re- sold and then presented to the Commissioners of Patents for their Patent Office Museum, which would in turn become the Science Museum. The engine is thus not only one of the Museum's oldest exhibits, but also one of the first to enter its collection. When first displayed, the engine was erected in an open-fronted representation of a brick-built engine house. It is now displayed on free-standing timberwork, allowing a closer inspection of the cylinders. For an engine that had been described as \\"one of the worst engines they had\\" when almost new, it had a relatively long working life of over 70 years. Its name had also shifted from the violent Beelzebub to the rather more friendly Old Bess, indicating a more satisfactory performance. Reports by both Joseph Harrison, Artificer of the Soho MintJoseph Harrison, Science Museum collection and William Buckle support this. In 2009 it was awarded an Engineering Heritage Award by the IMechE.  Confusion between engines  Several confusions exist about this engine, and have been widely repeated. The first of these confusions is that this was Watt's second engine (after the Kinneil engine) and the first by the Boulton and Watt partnership. In fact several engines were built between 1773 (the return of the Kinneil engine to Birmingham) and the construction of Beelzebub in 1777., Chap. IX, The Single Acting Pumping Engine, pp. 111‚Äì119 These include such well-known engines as the 1775 38-inch blowing engine for John Wilkinson's blast furnaces at New Willey, near Broseley, and the 50-inch pumping engine for Bloomfield Colliery near Tipton. The identity of Beelzebub is also confused. Some sources describe this as referring to the rebuilt Kinneil engine at Birmingham. There are two pieces of evidence to support the view that Old Bess and Beelzebub are the same engine. Firstly the name Beelzebub derives from its violent action when used experimentally for expansive working, an experiment applied to the engine built new in 1777. Secondly Beelzebub is described as a 33-inch engine, as is Old Bess on display today. There is no record of Boulton & Watt ever building another engine of this dimension.

South African property law regulates the \\"rights of people in or over certain objects or things.\\"Mostert & Pope 5. It is concerned, in other words, with a person's ability to undertake certain actions with certain kinds of objects in accordance with South African law.A \\"legal object\\" is something in respect of which a person may hold a right (Mostert & Pope 7). Although in some circumstances the term may signify purely one's right of ownership in a legal object, in others it refers to the legal object (tangible or incorporeal) to which that right pertains. Among the formal functions of South African property law is the harmonisation of individual interests in property,the guarantee and protection of individual (and sometimes group) rights with respect to property, and the control of proprietary relationships between persons (both natural and juristic), as well as their rights and obligations.Mostert & Pope 6. The protective clause for property rights in the Constitution of South Africas 25. stipulates those proprietary relationships which qualify for constitutional protection. The most important social function of property law in South Africa is to manage the competing interests of those who acquire property rights and interests. In recent times, restrictions on the use of and trade in private property have been on the rise.Wille 406.Mostert & Pope 6. Property law straddles private and public law,Mostert & Pope 8. and hence \\"covers not only private law relations in respect of particular types of legal objects that are corporeal or incorporeal, but also public law relations with a proprietary character, and the resultant rights and interests.\\"Mostert & Pope 12. Property in the private-law sense refers to patrimonial assets: those, that is, which comprise a person's estate. The law of property defines and classifies proprietary rights (for instance, as either real or personal), and determines the methods whereby they are acquired, lost and protected, as well as the consequences of their exercise and the limitations imposed by factual proprietary relationships which do not qualify as rights.Mostert & Pope 12. History Painting of an account of the arrival of Jan van Riebeeck, by Charles Bell. Until the Constitution was passed in 1994, South African property law was most heavily influenced by Roman-Dutch civil law, and, to a much lesser extent, English property law. English and Roman-Dutch law have very different conceptions of property rights, and these differences had a profound impact on the development of property rights in South Africa. English property law is derived from John Locke's theory that rights to property arise from the realization of the monetary value of property through the application of labour. Locke expressly rejected the idea that conquest can transfer property rights, with certain exceptions. He considered war to be a competition over lives rather than material items, which meant that lives but not items are forfeited or gained. As such, English property law recognizes the possession of property rights through mechanisms such as cession or improvement, but not through conquest. Roman-Dutch law is the opposite. Roman-Dutch property law is derived from Hugo de Groot's theory that property rights arise from just acquisition, and acquisition includes violence. Thus, while English property law forbids the acquisition of property rights through conquest, Roman-Dutch law does not. This fundamental difference between English and Roman-Dutch theories of property would have a major influence on the colonization of South Africa, in which British land acquisitions occurred predominantly by cession and Afrikaner land acquisitions occurred predominantly by conquest. One example of how these two disparate theories of property law impacting South African property law is the legal mechanism of prescription. Under English law, prescription-like devices like limitation periods (equivalent to extinctive prescription) and adverse possession and prescriptive easements (equivalent to acquisitive prescription) operated by creating a procedural bar on raising legal proceedings, but could never completely create or extinguish property rights to land. According to John Salmond, ‚Äòone of the most striking differences between our own [English] and foreign laws of prescription, is that by our own law a title to corporeal things cannot be made by prescription [‚Ä¶] ‚Äúno prescription in lands maketh a right‚Äù‚Äô. Under Roman-Dutch law, prescription creates and extinguishes rights and obligations, rather than barring court action. Early 20th-century statutory enactment in South Africa enshrined the Roman-Dutch understanding over that of the English. Certain property law principles are directly attributable to Roman-Dutch law, such as (1) the view that ownership is an indivisible right which confers on the owner the widest possible powers; (2) restrictions on an owner's absolute right of pursuit (ius persequendi) in favour of certain bona fide purchasers; (3) recognition that a long lease of land creates a real right;Under the Roman- Dutch rule huur gaat voor koop ‚Äòlease breaks sale‚Äô, a real right vests in a lessee of land or buildings and is enforceable against any subsequent purchaser or successor of the lessor. (4) recognition of a way of necessity out of landlocked land; (5) emphasis on delivery as a requirement for the transfer of ownership in movables; (6) use of movable bonds (obligatio bonorum) under the name notarial bonds as real security, etc.C.G. van der Merwe & J.E. Du Plessis, eds., Introduction to the Law of South Africa (The Hague: Kluwer Law International, 2004), 201. English law's influence has been more limited, e.g. the (1) introduction of perpetual quitrent and leasehold;Originally taking the form of a perpetual lease, 99-year lease, or a lease for an indefinite term coupled with right of renewal, they were prevalent in Cape Province, Natal, and the mining areas of Kimberley and Johannesburg. Initially interpreted as the leaseholder having dominium utile and the State dominium directum, the courts eventually equated them with ownership; this view was enacted into law. Leasehold was briefly re- established between 1978 and 1986. (2) penetration of the English tort of nuisance into neighbour law; (3) recognition of ‚Äòatornment‚Äô as a mode of delivery of movables; (4) adoption of technical aspects of the Torrens system; and (5) legislation on apartment ownership.Van der Merwe & Du Plessis, Intro. Law SA, 202. =Development= The Dutch East India Company established Cape Town in 1652. Dutch colonists initially took the land by force from the native San and Khoikhoi during the Khoikhoi‚ÄìDutch Wars. The wars were followed by systematic land grabs of water resources (springs, rivers) and pastureland, legitimised after the fact by exclusive land grants issued by the Company to colonial settlers. As the British slowly assumed control from 1795 to 1806 and the sovereignty over Cape Colony was formally ceded under the Anglo-Dutch Treaty of 1814, some Afrikaners fled inland to the northeast to establish their own colonies, the Boer Republics, taking land from Bantu peoples. Conflicts grew over the later half of the 19th century, as the rich mineral wealth of South Africa became evident. In 1867, diamonds were discovered in the Kimberley and in 1886 gold was discovered in Johannesburg. In 1889, the British South Africa Company was given a Royal Charter to further seek out and exploit areas across Southern Africa where mining could be profitable. Meanwhile, some more simple property rules, such as streamlined land- registration system had been implemented under John Cradock, 1st Baron Howden,Proclamation on Conversion of Loan Places to Quitrent Tenure, 6 August 1813. and in the early 20th century registration practices were codified by the Deeds Registries Acts of 1918 and 1937. After the groundwork laid by the Land Act 1913 and the Group Areas Act 1950, Bantustans or ‚Äòhomelands‚Äô for black South Africans at the end of apartheid were very small and economically deprived. In 1910, the Union of South Africa Act united the post Boer War British and Afrikaner communities, but excluded black South Africans from political involvement.The Hertzog Act 1936 finally stripped the limited franchise from Cape Africans that still remained. Indian or ‚Äòcoloured‚Äô South Africans were also excluded, prompting a younger Mohandas Gandhi to leave in 1914. From this point a series of laws secured white control of South African land and civic property. The Land Act 1913 reserved 92% of South Africa's territory for whites, and only 8% for blacks. This was enlarged to around 13.6% by the Native Trust and Land Act, 1936, although the population of the country that was black stood around 61%. In the Urban Areas Act 1923, it was decreed that blacks could only enter into towns to work. In the 1930s, ideas of racial supremacy became stronger among many white South Africans, and after the war the Afrikaner National Party won a majority at the 1948 election. From this point, the apartheid system was built up through legislation. In the Group Areas Act 1950 the country was categorised into various race-based regions, leading to forced removals and evictions of black people from their homes.Jackson & Wilde 334‚Äì340. See also the Immorality Act 1950 which prohibited sex and marriage between different races. The Group Areas Development Act, 1955 excluded non-white people from living in white areas altogether. The Reservation of Separate Amenities Act 1953 stated that separate toilets, parks and beaches were allocated.See also the Bantu Education Act, 1953, which aimed to educate black people only enough to be able to serve whites. As the apartheid regime continued, the Bantu Homelands Citizenship Act 1970 and the Bantu Homelands Constitution Act 1971 purported to ‚Äòconstitutionalise‚Äô the separate states within the South African state, where black South Africans had to live. Through the 1980s, the world's condemnation of the regime, the slow recognition of its deep injustice unsustainability, and the mounting civil disobedience led to a referendum and new constitution. By 1991 there had been approximately 17,000 statutory measures implemented to regulate land control and racial diversity.Jackson & Wilde 334‚Äì336. The Discriminatory Legislation regarding Public Amenities Repeal Act, 1990 and the Abolition of Racially Based Land Measures Act, 1991 started a process leading to the constitution. This ‚Äòexcessive law making and manipulation of existing notions of property resulted in the collapse of administrative and legal certainty and, moreover, massive underdevelopment‚Äô, and left the post-1994 dispensation with ‚Äòa severely compromised system of land rights‚Äô.Mostert & Pope 12. The new constitution explicitly protects the right to property, including land, in section 25(1), under the Bill of Rights. Section 25(2) and (3) states how property can be regulated and expropriated, with limited compensation from people who were dispossessed after 1913 by racial discrimination. Under section 26, the Constitution created a fundamental right to housing. In 2000, in Government of the Republic of South Africa v Grootboom,[2000] ZACC 19 the Constitutional Court held that although there was a justiciable right under section 26 to housing, this had to be interpreted in the light of administrative difficulties of achieving social and economic rights in practice. The claimant, Irene Grootboom, had been living temporarily in a shack on land that was being repossessed for redevelopment. It was accepted in the course of argument that she would be given temporary housing, but the court did no more than state that the government should aim to fix the housing and slum crisis. In political terms, the 1997 White Paper on Land Policy has been influential in setting up objectives. These were said to be to (1) redress apartheid-era inequities (2) nurture national reconciliation and stability (3) to support economic growth; and (4) to improve welfare and relieve poverty.At v. The new constitutional arrangement supports the regulation and protection of property, mandates the reform of land law, provides explicitly for basic rights like access to housing, and gives equal recognition to common- and customary-law principles. A host of policies have been implemented, and statutory measures promulgated, in the fulfilment of this mandate, which ‚Äòhas already had a significant influence on property law‚Äô.Mostert & Pope 15. Sources The traditional sources of the law of property in South Africa are common law, precedent and legislation.Mostert & Pope 15. Roman-Dutch principles have always provided the backbone, but they have lately been filled out considerably by statute,See especially the Prevention of Illegal Eviction from and Unlawful Occupation of Land Act. as well as by the courts, among whose functions is to interpret and develop the common law. All sources of South African law, however, are now subordinate to and must be viewed and interpreted in light of the Constitution.Mostert & Pope 15.Constitution s 2. The Constitution is itself, therefore, now a source of property law,Mostert & Pope 15. as the Constitutional Court demonstrated by its application in Port Elizabeth Municipality v Various Occupiers.2005 (1) SA 217 (CC) at para 37. Since 1994, the court has entrenched the notions of justice and fairness (especially as articulated in the property-rights clauses25(1).) in determining property relations.Mostert & Pope 16. The move to constitutionalism has given additional importance to sources of law such as customary law, which is now, where appropriate, accorded equivalent consideration with common law, case law and statutory law.Mostert & Pope 16. This elevation, and at the same the subservience of customary law to the Constitution, was made apparent in the judgments of the Constitutional Court in the dispute between the Richtersveld community and the diamond miner Alexkor, concerning the restoration of ancestral lands to an indigenous community; in Bhe v Magistrate, Khayelitsha,2005 (1) SA 580 (CC). with its finding that male primogeniture is unconstitutional; and in Gumede v President of Republic of South Africa,2009 (3) SA 152 (CC). which struck down on grounds of inequality certain provisions in legislation dealing with the property regime of customary marriages. These cases illustrate the changing nature of customary property relations under the new constitution. Protection of ownership South African law \\"jealously protects the right of ownership and the correlative right of the owner in regard to his property, unless, of course, the possessor has some enforceable right against the owner.\\"Oakland Nominees v Gelria Mining & Investment 1976 (1) SA 441 (A). There exists a variety of remedies for the protection of ownership. They may be divided into three distinct categories: real, delictual and unjustified-enrichment remedies.Mostert & Pope 215. =Real remedies= Real remedies are concerned with physical control. They give the owner the power to exclude others from access to and enjoyment of his property.Mostert & Pope 215. Real remedies either restore physical control of the property to the owner or prevent infringement of the owner's entitlements. (An interdict and a declaratory order are also available to owners and possessors of property.) There are two real remedies used to protect the right of ownership: the rei vindicatio and the actio negatoria Rei vindicatio Ownership includes the entitlement of exclusive possession of res. The rei vindicatio, or vindicatory action, is a remedy available to the owner to reclaim his property from wherever it is found and from whosoever is unlawfully holding it. The remedy entitles him to \\"exclusive possession.\\" It is founded on the nemo plus iuris rule,Mostert & Pope 217. which holds that one cannot transfer more rights than one has; more succinctly, that one cannot give what one does not have.Mostert & Pope 193. The remedy is available to the owner in respect of both movable and immovable property, taking, in the latter case, the form of an eviction order, and applying only to business or trade or industrial property.Mostert & Pope 217. It is important to note that the remedy merely restores proprietary interest; it does not award damages. The decision in Mlombo v Fourie1964 (3) SA 350 TPD. Mlombo, the owner of the property, instituted damages against Fourie for having fraudulently ceased to possess it. The court ordered Fourie to make good its value. has been criticised, accordingly, for blurring the distinction between the rei vindicatio and the actio ad exhibendum.Mostert & Pope 219.Badenhorst et al 246. The former is a restorative proprietary remedy, whereas the latter is a delictual one. ;Requirements Three requirements must be met for a claim to be based on the rei vindicatio: # There must be proof of ownership on the part of the person instituting the action; # the property must exist and be identifiable; and # the defendant must be in physical control of the property at the time the action is instituted. In Chetty v Naidoo,1974 (3) SA 13 (AD). Chetty brought a rei vindicatio action against Naidoo in respect of property occupied by Naidoo, who claimed, but could not prove, that she had bought the property. The case sets out the following rules: * The owner need not aver that the defendant is in unlawful control of his property. * How the owner characterises the defendant's control is immaterial. * The burden is on the defendant to prove a right: for example, a lien or a lease. * If the owner concedes any right to the defendant, he must show that the right has been terminated if he still wishes the action to succeed. ;Defences The facta probanda may be challenged in defence against the rei vindicatio. There are four main defences: # The claimant is not the owner of the property. This allegation would clearly require the defendant to produce documentary evidence. # The property in question is no longer identifiable or does not exist; it has, for instance, been destroyed. # The defendant's possession or physical control of the property is not unlawful. # The defendant is in fact not, or no longer, in physical control of the property. Good faith may not be used as a defence against the rei vindicatio. Estoppel may be raised as a defence to the rei vindicatio only in certain circumstances; in others‚Äîsee below‚Äîit may simply vary the effect of the action. ;Limitations There are two types of limitations, statutory and common-law, on the use of the rei vindicatio. The effect of these limitations is to prevent the claimant from vindicating his rights. The common-law limitation of estoppel may act as a defence, or it may vary or limit the effect of the rei vindicatio. As a limitation on the action, estoppel blocks its vindicatory function. Ownership is not disputed, but the owner may not regain possession for the duration of the estoppel. This amounts to a suspension of the owner's entitlement to vindicate his property‚Äîhe is estopped from vindicating it‚Äîbut it is important to note that it does not vest that entitlement on the defendant. Mostly estoppel is deployed in respect of movable property,Grosvenor Motors v Douglas 1956 2 SA 420 (A).Johaadien v Stanley Porter 1970 (1) SA 394 (A).Kia Motors v Van Zyl 1999 (3) SA 640 (O). but it may also be used for immovable property.AGS van Suid-Afrika v Capes 1978 (4) SA 48 (C). It is required for estoppel that the owner have negligently or culpably made a misrepresentation,Johaadien v Stanley Porter.Quenty's Motors v Standard Credit Corp. through conduct or otherwise, that the property had been transferred to the controller, so that the controller had the power to transfer it in turn. The person who raises the estoppel must have acted on that misrepresentationStandard Bank v Stama 1975 (1) SA 730 (AD).ABSA v Jordasche 2003 (1) SA 401 (SCA). and suffered harm or loss as a result.Quenty's Motors. As for statutory limitations, the Insolvency ActAct 24 of 1936. provides that property sold and transferred after an insolvency action cannot be subject to the rei vindicatio,s 36(5). while, in terms of the Magistrates Courts Act,Act 32 of 1944. a sale in execution of property cannot be impeached against a good-faith purchaser in the absence of a defect.s 70.Menqa v Markom 2008 (2) SA 120 (SCA).Jaftha v Schoeman; Van Rooyen v Stoltz 2005 (2) SA 140 (CC). There are several constitutional limitations on the application of the rei vindicatio to immovable property.s 25(5).s 25(6).26(3). Constitutional intervention has resulted in legislation relating to eviction, redistribution and the regulation of tenure. The Constitution holds that no-one may be evicted from his home without a court order.s 26(3). The procedure to be followed is set out in the Prevention of Illegal Eviction from and Unlawful Occupation of Land Act (PIE),Act 19 of 1998. which excludes the rei vindicatio and other common-law remedies. It was decided in Ndlovu v Ngcobo; Bekker v Jika2003 (1) SA 113 (SCA). that PIE has application also where the occupation was lawful to begin with but became unlawful later. Different procedures are set out under PIE for private owners,s 4. urgent applicationss 5. and organs of state.s 6. Notice must be given within fourteen days of the hearing and should include the following: * notification that proceedings have been instituted; * the date of the hearing; * the grounds for the proceedings; and * information as to the right of appearance. In the case of private owners,s 4. the court will consider the length of the occupation. If it has been less than six months, an eviction order will be made only if it is \\"just and equitable\\" to do so, \\"after considering all the relevant circumstances, including the rights and needs of the elderly, children, disabled persons and households headed by women.\\"s 4(6). If it has been more than six months, the eviction order must still be just and equitable, but the circumstances to consider are compounded by the question of \\"whether land has been [...] or can reasonably be made available [...] for the relocation of the unlawful occupier.\\" An exception to this is \\"where the land is sold in a sale of execution pursuant to a mortgage.\\"s 4(7). Urgent applicationss 5. are granted where harm is eminent \\"to any person or property if the unlawful occupier is not forthwith evicted from the land,\\",s 5(1)(a). where \\"the likely hardship to the owner or any other affected person [...] exceeds the likely hardship to the unlawful occupier,\\"s 5(1)(b). and where no other effective remedy is available.s 5(1)(c). In Residents of Joe Slovo Community v Thubelisha Homes,2010 (3) SA 454 (CC). an application was brought by the authorities in Cape Town seeking the eviction of persons in the Joe Slovo informal settlement under of PIE,s 5. arguing that the property was needed for the development of affordable housing for poor people. The High Court granted the order, and the residents appealed to the Constitutional Court on the grounds that they were not unlawful occupiers, having obtained the consent of the authorities,s 6(1)(a).In terms of s 1(ii), consent may be \\"express or tacit [...] in writing or otherwise.\\" and therefore could not be evicted. The court granted the eviction but ordered that alternative accommodation be provided to the occupiers. In Port Elizabeth Municipality v Various Occupiers, the municipality sought an eviction order against unlawful occupiers of municipal land, at the behest of adjacent land owners. The High Court granted the order, but on appeal to the Supreme Court of Appeals the order was quashed. The Municipality, in turn, appealed to the Constitutional Court, which held that there is no unqualified constitutional duty on local government to provide alternative housing in terms of PIE.s 6(3). \\"In general terms, however,\\" wrote Sachs J, \\"a court should be reluctant to grant an eviction against relatively settled occupiers unless it is satisfied that a reasonable alternative is available, even if only as an interim measure pending ultimate access to housing in the formal housing programme.\\"233G-H. In Blue Moonlight Properties v Occupiers of Saratoga Avenue,2009 (1) SA 470 (W). the respondent, a private landowner, served a notice of eviction on the occupiers. They resisted, claiming protection under PIE and alleging that they were entitled to continue their occupation until the City of Johannesburg Metropolitan Municipality provided alternative accommodation. The City disputed this duty; the respondents argued that its policy was arbitrary and discriminatory. The issue, then, was whether private landowners are obliged to provide alternative accommodation to unlawful occupiers in terms of PIE,s 4. or whether the burden should fall on the city. The court found that it should balance the rights of property owners under the Constitutions 25. with those of indigents and occupiers,s 26. and ruled that the landowners' right to equalitys 9. would be infringed if the state were to burden them with providing alternative accommodation without compensation. The obligation to provide access was the City's, and the City could not transfer that obligation to private landowners. The court ordered compensatory relief to Blue Moonlight Properties and found that the City was in breach of its constitutional duty to provide adequate housing on a progressive basis.s 9. It was obliged to make monetary payment each month until such accommodation was found. The Extension of Security of Tenure ActAct 62 of 1997. applies to occupiers * who have the necessary consent to occupy;s 1(1)(x). * who do not use the occupied land for commercial purposes;s 1(1)(x)(b). and * whose income is less than R5,000.s 1(1)(x)(c). The Act distinguishes between occupiers as of 4 February, 1997,s 10. and occupiers after that date.s 11. The procedures for and limitations on eviction are set out in section 9: \\"Not less than two calendar months' written notice [must be given] of the intention to obtain an order for eviction, which notice shall contain the prescribed particulars and set out the grounds on which the eviction is based.\\"s 9(2)(d)(iii). The \\"just and equitable\\" principle is invoked repeatedly.3(2)(b)8(1)11(1)11(2)11(3)12(1)(a)12(2)13(1)(a)13(2)14(4)(b) The Land Reform (Labour Tenants) Act,Act 3 of 1996. which regulates the establishment of landownership by \\"labour tenants,\\" also places certain limitations on eviction. The procedures for eviction (which must, again, be just and equitable) are set out in sections 7 and 15. Actio negatoria The actio negatoria permits the owner to resist or deny the existence of an alleged servitude or other right for the defendant to cause physical disturbance of the land.Mostert & Pope 226. It can also be used when movable property has been alienated without the owner's consent, and delivered notwithstanding, pending the institution of the rei vindicatio; and in situations where a person has interfered with the owner's enjoyment, to compel that person to restore the status quo ante. With the actio negatoria, the owner may demand the removal of any structures that have been unlawfully placed on the land (that is, without his consent). The remedy can be used to obtain a declaration of rights, to claim damages or to obtain security against any future disturbance of the claimant's rights. The claimant must prove the following essential elements in order to be successful in bringing the action: * that he has ownership of the property in question; * that the property exists and is identifiable; and * that the defendant's conduct infringes upon his rights of ownership, either because it amounts to an excessive exercise of an acknowledged limited real right, or because the defendant is making the erroneous assumption that a real right in the property exists. =Delictual remedies= Delictual remedies offer the owner compensation or damages for interference with the exercise of his rights of ownership. Most often the delict is a wrongful alienation resulting in financial loss. Delictual remedies are appropriate where physical restoration of the property is impossible: that is, where the property has been lost or destroyed or damaged, in which case the owner is entitled to be compensated for his patrimonial loss. Three delictual remedies are relevant to the law of property: the condictio furtiva, the actio ad exhibendum and the actio legis Aquiliae. They are all personal remedies rather than real ones. Condictio furtiva The condictio furtiva is used in cases where property has been stolen, in order to recover the patrimonial loss. The action is available only against the thief, but it may be brought by all persons with a lawful interest in the property.Clifford v Farinha 1988 (4) SA 315 (W). It is essential, however, that the claimant be the owner or have the lawful interest at all relevant times: that is, the interest must exist at the time of the theft and must still endure at the time the action is instituted.Mostert & Pope 227. Actio ad exhibendum The actio ad exhibendum is a general personal action with a delictual function. It is instituted by the owner of the property against the person who wrongfully and deliberately disposed of it. The claim is for the value of the property which cannot be recovered,Where the property still exists, the appropriate action is the rei vindicatio; the actio ad exhibendum should be used only where the property is irrecoverable. and the basis for liability is bad faith (mala fide). There are several requirements: * ownership;RMS Transport v Psicon Holdings 1996 (2) SA 176 (T). * bad faith;Frankel Pollak Vinderine v Stanton 2000 (1) SA 425 (W). and * patrimonial loss. Actio legis Aquiliae Whereas the condictio furtiva and the actio ad exhibendum each has its own particular application (theft and bad-faith disposal respectively), the actio legis Aquiliae is a general delictual action to claim compensation in all cases where property has been destroyed or damaged by the defendant in a wrongful and culpable manner. The usual requirements for delictual liability pertain: There must be (i) an action or omission (ii) performed with a culpable disposition (intent or negligence) which (iii) results in damage or injury to the owner. =Unjustified enrichment= Remedies for unjustified enrichment apply when a person other than the owner receives benefit at the expense of the owner. The owner may institute an action (condictio sine causa) against one who has benefited, without cause, from the possession of his property, when that benefit ought to have accrued to him. The benefit could derive from consumption or alienation of the property, and the claim may be made only in situations where no consideration was given (ex causa lucrativa); that is, where no money changed hands. In certain circumstances, the condictio sine causa may be the only remedy available to the owner, especially in respect of bona fide possessors who consumed or alienated the property.Mostert & Pope 229. To be successful in his enrichment claim, the owner must show # that he has been impoverished, in the sense that what should have accrued to him has not; # that the defendant has been enriched at his expense; # that this financial shift was without a legal basis (sine causa); and # that the defendant acted bona fide. Real security Whenever someone borrows money from another, a relationship is created between the lender (the creditor) and the borrower (the debtor). The lender takes on the risk that the borrower may not repay the money he owes. To reduce this risk, the law has devised a process which offers some protection to the lender, so that he may recover the money he is owed in the event that the borrower does not meet his obligations. The process distinguishes between cases in which the borrower is unwilling and cases in which he is unable to pay. The lender, in such cases, may seek an order for repayment and a declaration of insolvency respectively. These actions, however, do not resolve the risk. There is consequently the additional protection of security, which can be either real or personal. In contrast to real security, personal security right gives the creditor a personal right to settle the principal debt if the debtor fails to do so, whereas a real security right gives the creditor a limited real right in property belonging to the debtor.A third party, willing to provide security for the debtor, may make his own property available as well. The property does not have to belong to the debtor, in other words, to provide real security. In terms of the limited real right, the debtor (or third party) agrees that the creditor may use the property to settle the principal debt if the debtor fails to do so. Personal security rights are regulated by the law of obligations (contract and delict), whereas real security rights are governed by the law of property. Real security is important to commerce, as it provides a mechanism which allows owners to maximise their potential to generate wealth by offering their existing property as security for credit. Real security gives the creditor limited real rights over the debtor's bonded property. There has been significant judicial activity in South Africa involving security rights and constitutional property protection, as well as security rights and the guarantee against eviction. = Categories = There are three distinct categories of real security: # express real security rights, which are created by agreement and include mortgages, pledges and notarial bonds; # tacit real security rights, which are created by operation of law and include the lessor‚Äôs tacit hypothec, hire purchase tacit hypothec, lien and statutory security rights; and # judicial real security rights, which are created by court order and include judicial mortgage and judicial pledge. = Functions = The property that secures the principal debt is referred to as the security object. The security parties are the debtor,As we have seen, a third party may also make his property available as real security for the debtor's obligations. known as the secured party, and the creditor, known as the security holder. Real security rights give the security holder the power to prevent the secured party from disposing of it, as well as a right of preference (ius praeferendi). Where the secured party is unwilling to repay the principal debt, or is insolvent, the security holder may, after the security object has been attached and sold in execution, claim the proceeds from that sale before any other creditor. Real security rights are limited real rights (or iura in re aliena, or rights in someone else‚Äôs property). They confer limited and specific entitlements on their holders and are enforceable against third parties. = Creation = Several legal transactions are entered into to create a real security right. These may be categorised as follows: * the preconditions; * the credit agreement; * the security agreement; and * the perfection.  Preconditions  A number of preconditions must be fulfilled before a real security right can come into existence: * The property must be res in commercio; * the parties must have capacity to enter into a legal transaction; * the owner of the property must consent to the creation of the real security right; and * the parties must intend to create a real security right.  Credit agreement  The credit agreement, which describes the agreement between the creditor and the debtor, creates personal rights only. It establishes the principal debt and is governed by the law of contract and the National Credit Act.Act 34 of 2005.  Security agreement  In the security agreement, which also creates only personal rights, the debtor undertakes to provide security for the principal debt established in the credit agreement. The security agreement determines the nature of the security: whether, for instance, it is a mortgage or a pledge. It, too, is governed by the law of contract.  Perfection  The security agreement is not sufficient for the creation of a real security right. For the right to exist, the parties must comply with the publicity principle which holds that limited real rights are perfected by due publicity. Thus, the right must be publicised, although the manner will differ depending on whether the security object is movable (in which case it must be delivered to the security holder) or immovable (in which case it must be registered in the Deeds Registry). Once publicity has taken place, a real security right will vest in the security holder. = Nature = Real security rights have certain common characteristics with other limited real rights: for example, the conferral of entitlements and enforceability. They are distinguished from other limited real rights in that they are accessory or contingent in nature: they depend for their creation and continued existence on a valid underlying debt. In Kilburn v Estate Kilburn,1931 AD 501. the court found that, as the principal debt was invalid, the limited real right (in that case a notarial bond) was invalid, too. Similarly, a real security right will be terminated automatically when the principal debt is extinguished. The principal debt usually arises out of a contract, but it may also arise out of a delict or unjustified enrichment, a natural obligation (valid but not legally enforceable) and a conditional obligation. The principal debt may be intended to secure an existing or future obligation, in which event it will be suspended until that obligation arises. Although it will usually take the form of money, it need not necessarily do so; for example, one may secure an obligation to perform an act. It is customary, though, to express the debt as one sounding in money for a liquid amount, which gains the advantages of provisional sentencing proceedings to facilitate the satisfaction of the creditor‚Äôs claim if the debtor defaults or becomes insolvent. Unless otherwise agreed by the parties, a real security right is indivisible, securing the entire debt and binding the secured party (or debtor) until it is paid. Also unless otherwise agreed, a real security right secures not only the principal debt but all its ‚Äúincidents‚Äù as well. These may include: * costs incurred by the security holder (or creditor) in preserving the security; * interest charged by the security holder; and * costs incurred by the security holder in enforcing his rights. Real security rights do not entitle the security holder to use and enjoyment of the security object, unless otherwise agreed by the parties. = Security object = In accordance with the specificity principle, the security object must be clearly determined and described in the security agreement. It cannot be property belonging to the security holder, because, by definition, one cannot have a limited real right in one‚Äôs own property. It may be movable or immovable; it may be a single thing (res singula) or an aggregate of things (universitas rerum); it may even be incorporeal, as with a servitude. The secured party must be the owner of the security object, or at least a duly-authorised representative of the owner. = Express real security = Express real security rights are established by express agreement and include pledges, mortgages and notarial bonds. The two most important forms of express real security are special mortgages in immovable property and pledges of movable property.  Special mortgages  Mortgage refers to real security which hypothecates immovable property to secure payment of a debt. A mortgage is perfected by registration in the Deeds Registry, pursuant to an agreement between the parties‚Äîthe mortgagor (debtor) and the mortgagee (creditor). A special mortgage is taken over specific immovable property, but both incorporeal and corporeal immovables can be mortgaged. The property must, however, be in existence. General mortgages are prohibited. To be valid, a mortgage must be evidenced in writing in the form of a mortgage bond. The bond must be executed by the mortgagor, attested by the Registrar of Deeds and entered into the register. Creating a mortgage requires two constitutive acts: # formation of a valid, binding mortgage agreement, creating personal rights; and then # perfection by registering the mortgage bond in the Deeds Registry, creating real rights. A mortgage bond, as per Thienhaus v Metje & Ziegler,1965 (3) SA 25 (A). is an instrument of hypothecation, a record of the mortgage agreement, a record of the principal debt and a debt instrument.31C-D. It establishes the mortgagee‚Äôs right of mortgage (ius hypothecarium). Registration does not depend on the validity of the underlying causa, as South Africa applies the abstract system of transfer of real rights.C.G. Van der Merwe & J.E. Du Plessis, eds., Introduction to the Law of South Africa (The Hague: Kluwer Law International, 2004), 230. The mortgage agreement, governed by the law of contract, is an undertaking to secure the underlying principal debt by passing a mortgage bond over immovable property in favour of the mortgagee. It is subject to the National Credit Act: that is, * to information on the credit providers; * to the amounts involved; * to whether or not the agreement is lawful (which it is not in the case of unregistered credit providers); and * to the cost of credit or interest or fees. Writing is not a requirement for a mortgage agreement. It is important to note that registration serves to publicise the right of mortgage, not the debt which it secures. Although the details of the debt (the amount, nature and origin) are not an essential requirement for a valid mortgage, the mortgage right is an accessory right which depends on the existence of the debt. It is custom in drafting mortgage bonds to incorporate an admission of liability by the mortgagor to facilitate a quick and easy remedy.31D. = Form and content = With only a few exceptions, no specific form is prescribed by law for the mortgage bond. Certain standard forms, however, have been developed over the years. The mortgage bond provides identification of the parties and property, and an unconditional acknowledgement of debt. As for the contractual aspects of the principal debt or obligation, mortgage bonds usually include clauses dealing with the repayment scheme, charges and the possibility of foreclosure, and also use and enjoyment of the mortgaged property, and maintenance and procedures. Clauses not to be included are the forfeiture clause (pactum commissorium) and the summary execution clause (parate executie). The former provides that, if the mortgagor defaults, the mortgagee may keep the property for his own. The latter provides that, if the mortgagor defaults, the mortgagee may take possession of the mortgaged property and arrange for a private sale. However, after mortgagor default, the parties may agree that the mortgagee can take over the mortgaged property or sell it extrajudicially at a fair valuation.Van Der Merwe & Du Plessis, Intro. Law SA, 230. = Operation = To understand how a mortgage bond operates, it is necessary to take note of at least the following three aspects: * The mortgagee has a right of preference (ius praeferendi), a ‚Äòpriority right‚Äô, where sale of the property has been levied (even where it has been levied by other creditors). Similarly, when the debtor is declared insolvent, the mortgagee is to be regarded as a preferent creditor. However, if the sale proceeds are insufficient to satisfy the debt, the mortgagee will rank pari passu with concurrent creditors for the deficit. * The mortgagee has a right of pursuit (ius persequendi) to follow the property into whomsoever‚Äôs hands it may pass. The mortgage runs with the property and cannot be defeated by alienation, leases, or servitudes. * The mortgagee has the right to foreclose. First, the mortgagee obtains judgmentA security holder is not entitled to an order declaring property executable unless he provides proof that all prior bondholders who enjoy rights under a non-prejudice clause in the mortgage bond have consented to the order. A letter to this effect is sufficient proof. specifically declaring the immovable property executable.Uniform Rules of Court 45(1); Tobacco Exporters & Manufacturers Ltd v Bradbury Road Properties (Pty) Ltd 1990 2 SA 420 (C) 426. Then, the mortgagee, as judgment creditor, issues a writ of execution against the mortgaged property, instructing the sheriff to levy the execution immediately. There are several constitutional implications,Standard Bank v Saunderson 2006 (2) SA 264 (SCA).ABSA v Ntsane 2007 (3) SA 554 (T).Gundwana v Steko Development 2011 (3) SA 608 (CC). especially in terms of the right of access to adequate housing.s 26. * The mortgagor‚Äôs rights and duties are another important aspect: ** The mortgagor‚Äôs rights of use and enjoyment are restricted in terms of the mortgage bond. He may be prevented, for example, from leasing the property, mortgaging it further, etc. ** The mortgagor must obtain the mortgagee‚Äôs written consent if he wants to encumber the property with a servitude or wishes to dispose of the property. If consent is not obtained, the mortgagee has the right to follow-up property.Standard Bank v Breitenbach 1977 (1) SA 151 (T). ** The mortgagor retains possession and must reasonably maintain the mortgaged property. = Termination = Termination of the mortgage bond occurs: * when the principal debt is discharged‚Äîrecall the accessory nature of the special mortgage‚Äîor is extinguished by compromise, novation, prescription, release or set-off; * when the mortgaged property is totally destroyed, in which case, if it is not his fault, the mortgagor is under no obligation to replace or restore or substitute the property; * when the mortgagee acquires ownership of the mortgaged property (merger or confusio); * when the mortgage is subject to a resolutive condition, and this condition has been fulfilled; * by agreement; and * when the mortgaged property is sold in execution, or by the trustee of the debtor‚Äôs insolvent estate, and the proceeds are applied toward the debt.  Pledges  A pledge is a limited real right that one person acquires in another person's movable property in order to secure payment of a debt. It is created by delivery of the movable property, pursuant to an agreement between the parties, who are known as the pledgorThe pledgor is the person whose movable property is burdened by the pledge, and may be a third party. and the pledgee.The pledgee is the person in whose favour the pledge has been created: that is to say, the creditor. A pledge does not give the pledgor (or debtor) the option of retaining the property while burdening it with the real security right, but it can be created in respect both of corporeal and of incorporeal property.Britz v Sniegocki 1989 (4) SA 372 (D). A pledge in respect of incorporeal property is commonly referred to as a security cession (cessio in securitatem debiti), meaning that a claim against a third party is ceded to the pledgee; in this case, personal rights vest in the pledgee. Control that vests in the pledgee is known as quasi-control. The primary claim, however, remains vested in the pledgor. An act of publicity may be required: for example, sending notice of cession to the pledgor's debtors. The creation of a pledge usually takes place in two stages: # The parties enter into a valid and binding pledge agreement. The pledgor agrees to secure a valid underlying principal debt by pledging his movable property to the pledgee. He must comply with all the requirements of a valid contract. This gives rise to personal rights. # The pledged object is delivered by the pledgor to the pledgee. For a pledge to come into existence as a real security right, it is essential that delivery occur. Delivery can be actual or constructive,For example, clavium traditio; traditio brevi manu, traditio longa manu and attornment. but the pledgee must retain possession of the pledged object. The transfer of possession is intended to publicise the fact that a real security right, in the form of a pledge, has been established over the pledged object. The transfer serves to protect the pledgee's real security right by preventing the pledgor from alienating the pledged object or pledging it to some other person. This is why constitutum possessorium is not permitted. One of the disadvantages of the transfer of possession is that (unlike the mortgage bond, where possession is usually retained) it does not promote commerce, as most businesses cannot afford to give up possession of their movable property. To avoid the requirement of transfer, the parties sometimes enter into a simulated transaction, which appears to be one type while it is actually another: a sale, for example, which is actually a pledge. The courts' treatment of simulated transactions is best illustrated in the classic case of Vasco Dry Cleaners v Twycross.1979 (1) SA 603 (A). = Operation = The most important of the entitlements conferred by the pledge on the pledgee is his right of preference to the proceeds of the sale in execution. Although the pledgee is entitled to possession, he is not entitled to use it, enjoy it or take any of its fruits. He is also obliged to take reasonable care of the pledged property, and has a further obligation, on the termination of the pledge, to restore pledged property (plus its fruits) to the pledgor. The pledgee is entitled to protect his possession by means of an interdict. If he has incurred necessary expenses in maintaining the pledged property, he may claim maintenance costs and retain the property until they are paid. If the pledgee gives up possession voluntarily, the pledge is terminated, but a third party may exercise possession on his behalf.  Notarial bonds  A notarial bond is a limited real security which hypothecates movable property in an attempt to secure the bondholder‚Äôs ranking for the satisfaction of a debt.Mostert & Pope 321. To be valid, a notarial bond must be notarially executed, and to be enforceable against third parties, it must be registered in the Deeds Registry at the bond debtor‚Äôs place of residence or registered office within three months of execution.C.G. Van der Merwe & J.E. Du Plessis, eds., Introduction to the Law of South Africa (The Hague: Kluwer Law International, 2004), 234. A notarial bond can only be taken over movable property and merely grants the bondholder a right of preference (prior ranking) over unsecured creditors and hypothec holders at the debtor‚Äôs insolvency. Generally, the bondholder does not possess the bonded property, and therefore notarial bonds usually contain ‚Äúperfection clauses‚Äù allowing the bondholder to seize and dispose of the bonded property when the debtor defaults. A notarial bondholder does not acquire a security right until the bond is perfected by taking possession of the bonded property,Development Bank v Van Rensburg 2002 (5) SA 425 (SCA). which may be construed by an attachment by a sheriff or messenger on the bondholder‚Äôs behalf.In re Woeke 1 Menz 564; Mangold Bros v Eskell 3 SC 48. In other words, the requirements for a valid pledge must be fulfilled. A bondholder may not exercise this right without a court order or the debtor‚Äôs consent; moreover, the perfection clause must be included in the bond. Notarial bonds take two forms: general and special. = General bonds = A general notarial bond, governed by the common law, applies generally to all movable property, both corporeal and incorporeal (including liquor licenses, book debts, and goodwill), in the bond debtor‚Äôs possession, which may include movables acquired after executing the bond.Ward v Barrett NO 1963 (2) SA 543 (A). Despite registration in the Deeds Registry, the real right of security merely ‚Äúattaches‚Äù to the bonded property and is inchoate, so that the property may be alienated without the consent of the bondholder, and the bond does not bind any third party who acquires property. That is to say the bondholder‚Äôs right of preference is defeated following a sale in execution; when, however, the bond debtor‚Äôs estate is sequestrated as insolvent, the bondholder‚Äôs preference is still perfectable. = Special bonds = A special notarial bond is taken over a specific corporeal movable of the bond debtor. Whereas the common law governs the general bond, the special bond is a creature of statute, subject to the Security by Means of Movable Property Act 1993.Act 57 of 1993. Before 1993, the legal principles governing special bonds were different in Natal from those in the rest of the country; they were set out in the Notarial Bonds (Natal) Act 1932,Act 18 of 1932 as amended by Act 57 of 1937. which dictated that a duly registered notarial bond over movable property be deemed to have been delivered to the bondholder in pledge. In the rest of the country, the principles set out in Cooper v Die Meester1992 (3) SA 60 (A). were applicable, so that the special notarial bondholder ranked equally with all other creditors in cases of insolvency. As of 1993, movable property is deemed, if registered, to have been pledged and delivered; in other words, the 1993 Act extended the Natalian principles to the rest of the country, so that the common law of pledges is now applied to special bonds. It also made perfection clauses unnecessary for special bonds. The importance of specifying and describing the movable in the notarial bond was illustrated in Ikea Trading und Design v BOE Bank.2005 (2) SA 7 (SCA). The test is whether a third party is able to identify the property from the terms of the bond itself, without recourse to extrinsic evidence. The reason for this requirement is that one of the bond‚Äôs functions is to publicise the fact that a real security right has been established. = Tacit real security = Tacit real security rights include the lessor‚Äôs tacit hypothec, the hire purchase tacit hypothec, liens and statutory security rights. They are created by operation of law.  Tacit hypothecs  The only common-law tacit hypothec recognised in South Africa is that of the lessor of immovable property. The other hypothecs are statutory, the most important being the tacit hypothec of the seller under a hire purchase agreement. = Lessor‚Äôs hypothec = The lessor‚Äôs tacit hypothec, also known as the landlord‚Äôs hypothec, arises out of the relationship between a lessor and a lessee. Its purpose is to secure the lessee‚Äôs obligation to pay the rent stipulated in the lease agreement, and it is triggered (by operation of law) as soon as the rent is in arrears. The hypothec is accessory to the debt obligation; accordingly, it falls away (by operation of law) as soon as the rent is paid. Property subject to the tacit hypothec (invecta et illata) includes goods (corporeal movables) brought to the premises by the lessee, as well as any fruits of the property that the lessee has collected but not yet removed from the property. The goods must, however, be present on the premises at the time of enforcement of the hypothec. The lessor‚Äôs knowledge of the existence of the goods is not required before the hypothec may be enforced. To create a real security right, the lessor must perfect the tacit hypothec by obtaining a court order which interdicts the alienation or removal of the invecta et illata, or else attaches them. Once the lessor‚Äôs hypothec has been perfected, the lessor acquires a real security right: a right of preference following a sale in execution of the movable property. The lessor may also prevent the lessee from removing the invecta et illata from the premises. If the invecta et illata are insufficient to cover the rent arrears, the hypothec may be extended to invecta et illata that belong to a sub-lessee. If both are insufficient, the hypothec may be extended to property belonging to a third party, so long as: * that property was brought onto the leased premises by the lessee with the express or implied knowledge of the third party; * it was intended for permanent use by the lessee; and * the lessor is unaware that the property belongs to a third party. The lessor's tacit hypothec will be nullified if the third party informs the lessor of his ownership of the property in question prior to the perfection of the hypothec.Eight Kaya Sands v Valley Irrigation Equipment 2003 (2) SA 495 (T) In Bloemfontein Municipality v Jacksons,1929 AD 266. the Appellate Division held that, where a third party has not taken reasonable steps to protect his property from the lessor‚Äôs hypothec, the courts will infer that the property was brought onto the leased premises with the implied knowledge and consent of that party. It is important to note that the Security by Means of Movable Property Act excludes the lessor‚Äôs hypothec in respect of property purchased in terms of a hire purchase agreement.s 2. Similarly, movable property subject to a special notarial bond, and in the possession of a third party‚Äîthat is to say, anyone other than the bondholder‚Äîis excluded from the lessor‚Äôs hypothec unless the hypothec was perfected before the registration of the bond. = Hire purchase hypothec = A hire purchase agreement, also known as an instalment sale, allows the purchase price to be paid in instalments after delivery of the hired property. Ownership remains with the seller until the hirer has paid the last hire instalment. The seller‚Äôs tacit hypothec is triggered by the sequestration of the hirer. The seller has a secured claim to the outstanding instalments due in terms of the hire purchase agreement. The seller‚Äôs hypothec under a hire purchase agreement secures the seller‚Äôs claim to outstanding instalments, so that the seller has a preferential claim.  Lien  A lien, also known as a right of retention, may be a real security right which arises by operation of law, or it may be a personal right. Its purpose is to secure the repayment of money or labour that the lienholder has expended on the lienor‚Äôs movable or immovable property. It operates as a defence to the lienor‚Äôs rei vindicatio and entitles the lienholder to retain possession of the property until compensated for the expenditure incurred. It does not include the right to have the property sold in execution. In Singh v Santam,1997 (1) SA 291 (A). the court held that the lienholder must have been in physical possession of the property at the time he incurred the expense. (A lien differs from a tacit hypothec most obviously in this respect.) As soon as the lienholder‚Äôs claim has been paid, the lien terminates automatically; it is accessory to the principal debt. There are two types of lien: # Enrichment liens, based on the principle of unjustified enrichment, arise in those cases where the lienholder has incurred expenses on the lienor‚Äôs property without that lienor‚Äôs consent, or without a legal obligation to do so. # Debtor and creditor liens arise when a lienholder expends labour on a lienor‚Äôs property in terms of a valid contract, and serves to secure payment. A lien may be terminated in the same way as other real security rights: * by discharge of the principal debt; * by destruction of the property; * by merger (confusio); and * by waiver. = Judicial real security = When a creditor has taken judgment against a debtor who has failed to comply, the creditor may enforce the judgment by applying for a writ of execution. The writ serves as a warrant which authorises the sheriff to attach the debtor's movable or immovable property, which creates a real security right in favour of the creditor. This real security right, established by court order, is usually referred to * as a judicial pledge, where the attached property is movable; and * as a judicial mortgage, where the attached property is immovable. These real security rights provide the creditor with a preferential claim to the proceeds of the sale of the attached property. Servitudes and restrictive conditions Both servitudes and restrictive conditions are limited real rights in property, or iura in re aliena. They both, then, are limitations on the right of ownership, and constitute a burden on the property in question; they must be registered against the title deeds of a property. = Servitudes = Servitudes are real rights that are \\"carved out of the full dominium of the owner\\"Consistory of Steytlerville v Bosman (1892‚Äì1893) 10 SC 67 at 69. and confer benefit to another, either by affording him the power of use and enjoyment, or else by requiring the owner to refrain from exercising his entitlement. Conversely, the notion of servitude implies that the property serves either another property or another person, and that the dominium of the owner of the servient or burdened property must be diminished by the servitude. One cannot, by definition, have a servitude on one's own property (nemini res sua servit), because a servitude can only be a limited real right in the property of another. There is a rebuttable presumption of unencumbered ownership. The burden of proof, which should be on a balance of probabilities, is on the person alleging the existence of a servitude.  Nature  The holder of the servitude has priority, in principle, as regards the exercise of the particular entitlement covered by the servitude. The servient owner may exercise all the usual rights of ownership, but he may not impair the rights of the servitude holder, and hence may not exercise those rights which are inconsistent with the servitude, or grant further servitudes that would infringe on the existing servitude (servitus servitutis esse non potest). The servitude holder is entitled to perform all acts necessary for the proper exercise of the servitude, but must do so such that as little inconvenience as possible is caused to the servient owner, and such that the burden on the servient property is not increased beyond the express or implied terms of the servitude. South African law does not have a closed list of real rights in land, but new types of real rights in land are permitted only with great caution, in keeping with the view that land should not be unnecessarily burdened. It was held in Linvestment v Hammersley2008 (3) SA 283 (C). that the court may be required to reinterpret servitudes which have existed for a generation in a different setting to render them continuously useful for modern society. Servitudes are classified according to whether or not they benefit successive owners. Two types are recognised: praedial servitudes and personal servitudes. Whether a servitude should be classified as a personal or a praedial servitude depends on whether it benefits a particular piece of land or a particular person: If the benefit favours land, then, regardless of the identity of the owner at any given point, successive owners will benefit from the interest in the servient land; if the benefit favours a particular person, then, at best, the benefit will exist for the lifetime of that person. Both praedial and personal servitudes are limited real rights, as they burden ownership, and both may be either positive or negative. Positive servitudes confer on the servitude-holder the entitlement \\"to enter upon the servient proprietor's land to do something positive,\\" to perform a positive act;Registers of Scotland 26.2. negative servitudes restrict the entitlements of the owner of the servient tenement.  Praedial servitudes  Praedial servitudes are limited real rights existing only in respect of land. They are vested in successive owners of one piece of land, called the dominant tenement, which derives a benefit from another piece of land, the servient tenement, belonging to someone other than the owner of the dominant tenement. In other words, praedial servitudes always involve at least two pieces of land, one of which serves the other. They benefit successive owners and are inseparably bound to the land they benefit. It is required of a praedial servitude that it benefit the owner of the dominant tenement in his capacity as owner of the land (rather than merely in his personal capacity). This is referred to as the requirement of utility (or utilitas). The question is whether or not the value derived from the dominant tenement is enhanced by the servitude. In determining utilitas, the following factors are considered: # In line with the rule of vicinity (vicinitas), the tenements must be close enough to each other for the servient tenement to be able reasonably to enhance the use and enjoyment of the dominant tenement. # The praedial servitude must benefit the dominant tenement itself, not just the pleasure or caprice of whosoever happens to be the landowner at a particular time. # Servitudes are characterised by passivity. Traditionally, a servitude does not impose on the owner a positive duty, or better say a duty to do something on the land (servitus in faciendo consistere nequit). Schwedhelm v Hauman1947 (1) SA 127 (E). upheld the rule on passivity, to which there are only two exceptions: ## the servitude to compel the owner of the servient property to construct a building of a certain height (servitus altius tollendi); and ## the servitude which imposes a duty on the owner of the servient land to keep the adjoining wall in good repair (servitus oneris ferendi). # Praedial servitudes are indivisible; they are imposed on the whole of the servient tenement. The rights and duties of the dominant and servient owners depend primarily on the terms of the agreement that constitutes the servitude. That agreement is construed strictly, and in a manner which is least burdensome for the servient owner. The dominant owner must exercise his rights civiliter modo, with due regard, that is, to the rights of the servient owner. Either party may approach the courts for a declaration of rights. Specific duties may be enforced by way of interdict, and damages may be awarded by a court where either party has exceeded the terms of the servitude and has suffered patrimonial loss. There are several conventional types of servitude: * Urban praedial servitudes, where land is used for purposes of habitation, trade or industry. Examples include rights of support and rights to encroach on neighbouring land, as well as negative servitudes to preserve a view or source of light. In a modern context, the most important category of urban praedial servitude is restrictive conditions. * As regards rural praedial servitudes, three main categories are usually identified: ** rights of way; ** water servitudes; and ** grazing servitudes. * Ways of necessity (via necessitatis) may include the right to use a footpath, the right to drive cattle or vehicles across land and so on.  Personal servitudes  Personal servitudes are limited real rights in either the movable or the immovable property (not just the land) of another. They vest only in one particular person (rather than successive holders).The benefit held by the personal servitude-holder does not pass automatically to his successor in title; it is tied to the holder. A personal servitude cannot be transferred by its holder (in much the same way that praedial servitudes are said to ‚Äòrun with the land‚Äô); it is extinguished when the period expires for which it has been granted, or when the holder dies: It cannot exist beyond his lifetime and cannot be transferred to a third party. Where the holder is a juristic person, it lasts for 100 years. Unlike its praedial counterpart, the personal servitude is divisible. There is no numerus clausus of personal servitudes. The most common and conventional forms inherited from Roman-Dutch law are the usufruct (usufructus), the usus and the habitatio. * Habitatio confers the right to occupy a house. * Usus confers the right to use and enjoy the property of another. * A usufruct confers the right to use and enjoy the property of another, as well as the fruits thereof. Other forms of the personal servitude borrowed from English law include the so- called ‚Äòirregular servitude‚Äô (i.e. the English easement in gross which has content usually associated with praedial servitudes, but which is constituted in favour of an individual), restrictive conditions (i.e. English real covenant), trading rights and the right of a developer to extend a section title scheme. = Usufructs = A usufruct is a limited real right, typically employed when a testator wishes to provide for surviving family members after his death, but wants the property to go to someone other than the usufructuary. The usufructuary may use and enjoy the property, which can be either movable or immovable, corporeal or incorporeal, and draw and acquire ownership of the property's fruits, which may be either natural (like crops and the young of livestock) or civil (such as rental income and interest on a capital investment). The usufructuary must gather the natural fruits in order to obtain ownership of them.If they are not gathered, ownership of the natural fruits will vest in the owner of the property. Civil fruits, on the other hand, are acquired by the usufructuary as soon as they become due. A usufruct cannot extend beyond the life of the usufructuary, who, not being the owner of the property, is not entitled to alienate or consume or destroy it. The usufructuary interest may, however, be alienated or pledged or mortgaged or sold in execution. In Durban v Woodhaven,1987 (3) SA 555 (A). the court questioned the fine distinction drawn between the usufruct itself and the right of enjoyment comprised by the usufructuary's interest. This decision implies that the nature and purpose of a particular personal servitude should determine whether the rights under the servitude are alienable. The usufructuary's rights include possession, administration, use and enjoyment of the property, as well as its natural and civil fruits. Consumable property cannot be the object of a usufruct, since the usufructuary must be able to give the property back to the owner salva rei substantia (or substantially intact) at the end of the usufructory period. The usufructuary must use the property reasonably: that is, for the purpose for which it was intended. The owner of the property retains all the rights of ownership, subject to the usufruct, and may therefore alienate or mortgage the property, subject to the usufruct. = Creation = Personal and praedial servitudes are created through agreement between the owner of the dominant tenement and the owner of the servient tenement. The terms of the agreement will provide for the nature, scope and extent of the servitude; the price to be paid by the owner of the dominant tenement as a consideration for the grant of the servitude; and the duration of the servitude. A praedial servitude can be granted in perpetuity, or it may exist for a specified period of time or until the fulfilment of a specified condition. The agreement gives rise to a personal right to claim registration of the servitude. Registration creates its real nature. A personal servitude may also be created by agreement, but it is more common for a personal servitude, such as a usufruct, to be created in terms of a will. A servitude may also be created by state grant. Both personal and praedial servitudes may be created by statute. Acquisition of a servitude may also occur, in terms of the Prescription Act,Act 68 of 1969. by acquisitive prescription.s 6. Servitudes may also result from a court order (e.g. via necessitatis). = Extinction = Servitudes may be terminated by agreement. They can usually be abandoned (although proof of the intention to abandon is necessary) and may also be extinguished by the effluxion of time (although different rules pertain to positive and negative servitudes). A servitude terminates if the property to which it relates is destroyed, but it will revive if the property is restored. A servitude which is constituted for a limited period, or under specific conditions, expires at the end of the stipulated period, or when the specified conditions are fulfilled and a court order confirms the termination. A servitude may also expire in terms of a statute.  Praedial servitudes  If, in the case of praedial servitudes, the dominant and servient tenements are merged, the servitude will be terminated: If the merger was not intended to be permanent, the servitude will revive when the properties are separated again; if the merger was intended to be permanent, the servitude will not revive when the properties are again separated. Praedial servitudes also terminate when the requirements for their constitution can no longer be fulfilled.  Personal servitudes  A personal servitude will expire when the holder of the servitude dies. A personal servitude may also expire upon the fulfilment of a resolutive condition. The Deeds Registries Act provides for the registration of the expiry of a personal servitude. = Enforcement = Most of the remedies available to an owner are also available, mutatis mutandis, to a servitude holder. The following remedies, therefore, are generally available to a servitude holder: * a declaration of rights by a court; * a mandatory interdict; * a prohibitory interdict; * the mandament van spolie; * a delictual action for damages. * delict of 1912  Restrictive conditions  Restrictive conditions are a unique set of limited real rights which are utilised in the context of town planning and the management of land use. This area of the law has become ‚Äòso specialised and so important‚Äô that it warrants a section of its own.Mostert & Pope 246. Restrictive conditions are in the nature of urban praedial servitudes. They consist of a wide range of restrictions on the use of land and are usually contained in a deed of transfer. The purpose of a restrictive condition is: # to create a co- ordinated and harmonious layout for a township development in the interests of all erf-holders; and # to preserve the character of the neighbourhood. This becomes important when a restrictive condition is sought to be removed. = Definition = In a broad sense, a restrictive condition includes a registered restrictive condition of title, which is registered in the deed of transfer, but which also includes any other restriction in any other deed or other instrument in terms of which a right in land is held. An example of this is a provision in a town-planning scheme. Restrictive conditions work hand-in- hand with town planning, zoning and land-use schemes. In a narrow sense, restrictive conditions are those registered restrictions on the use of land. They include those conditions inserted into a deed of transfer during the process of township development. Below are examples: * ‚ÄòThe erf shall not be subdivided.‚Äô * ‚ÄòThe erf shall be used for residential purposes only.‚Äô * ‚ÄòThere shall be no additional construction.‚Äô * ‚ÄòThe erf shall not be used for trade.‚Äô It is important to note that much of the terminology used in this area of the law‚Äî\\"restrictive condition,\\" \\"condition of title,\\" \\"restrictive title condition,\\" \\"restrictive title deed condition,\\" \\"title deed restriction,\\" \\"title deed condition\\"‚Äîall refers to the same thing. Restrictive conditions must, however, be distinguished from restrictions of town-planning and land- use schemes. = Nature and character = As previously noted, restrictive conditions are in the nature of urban praedial servitudes.Some cases, indeed, indicate that they are praedial servitudes. All concerned parties, therefore, are mutually and reciprocally bound to one another to adhere to the provisions of the restrictive condition.Malan v Ardconnel Investments 1988 (2) SA 12 (A).Ex parte Optimal Property Solutions 2003 (2) SA 136 (C).Van Rensburg v Nelson Mandela Bay Municipality 2008 (2) SA 8 (SE). In Ex parte Optimal Property Solutions, the court held that registered praedial servitutal rights are incorporated into the constitutional concept of property,s 25(1). such that the removal or deletion of a restrictive condition may amount to a deprivation of property. In Van Rensburg v Nelson Mandela Bay Municipality, it was found that restrictive conditions operate in private sphere but also bear a public character, so that both private citizens and the state are bound to honour and uphold them. The responsibility was placed on the municipality to be aware of the restrictive condition and to act in accordance with it. A conflict may arise between the provisions of a restrictive condition and a town-planning or land-use scheme. Where this occurs, the restrictive condition usually takes precedence. Restrictive conditions cannot be removed automatically. Before an owner may implement or take advantage of the terms of a town-planning scheme, he must remove any existing legal impediment. Failing that the Town Planning Authority may institute proceedings against such an owner to compel him/her to comply with the town planning regulations. = Enforcement and defences = When an owner uses his property in a manner contrary to the provisions of a restrictive condition, a number of remedies are available to the person or entity whose rights are thereby infringed: * apply to a court for an interdict; * apply to a court for a declaration of rights; * apply to a court for a mandamus; * institute an action for damages; * seek a constitutional remedy (where, for example, the right to administrative actions 33. has been infringed); or * seek a statutory remedy (because statutes may create an offence where restrictive conditions are contravened). A possible defence to an action instituted to enforce the provisions of a restrictive condition is that the character of the area has changed so much that the original restrictive condition is no longer applicable, has become valueless and need not be enforced. = Removal or amendment = The removal of and amendments to a restrictive condition can occur in a number of different ways, most broadly by court application and by statute. Ex parte Optimal Property Solutions confirms the procedure for an ex parte application, while the Removal of Restrictions Act,Act 84 of 1967. for example, contains procedures whereby certain restrictions and obligations in respect of land, including restrictive conditions, may be altered, suspended or removed. The procedure stipulates, inter alia, that the application must be in a prescribed form and accompanied by payment of fees and notice in the provincial gazette, to provide for the raising of objections. There are numerous advantages and disadvantages to these procedures. Minerals The acquisition, use and disposal of mineral rights is now governed by the Mineral and Petroleum Resources Development Act (MPRDA),Act 28 of 2002. which came into effect on 1 May, 2004. The old common-law principles relating to the acquisition, use and disposal of mineral rights are therefore no longer applicable. The MPRDA entrenches state power and control over the mineral and petroleum resources of the country. =History= Historically, the right to minerals fell within the ambit of property law. Mineral rights could be severed from the title to the land. Severance of the mineral rights from the surface rights enabled third parties to become holders of the mineral rights. The right to minerals could thus exist separately from ownership of the land once the right had been severed. To determine the nature and content of mineral rights, the courts relied on the established property-law principles of servitudes. In its conventional, common-law sense, a mineral right comprised the entitlements to enter land,Van Vuren v Registrar of Deeds 1907 TS 289.Aussenkjer Diamante v Namex 1983 (1) SA 263 (A). to prospect and to mine upon itLe Roux v Loewenthal 1905 TS 742.SA Railways and Harbours v Transvaal Consolidated Land and Exploration 1961 (2) SA 467 (A).Van Vuren v Registrar of Deeds.Ex Parte Pierce 1950 (3) SA 628 (O). and to remove minerals, along with all ancillary rights which enable extraction of the minerals.Trojan Exploration v Rustenburg Platinum Mines 1996 (4) SA 499 (A). Mineral rights were valuable assets. Ownership of minerals passed from the landowner to the mineral rights holder.AgriSA v Minister of Minerals and Energy; Van Rooyen v Minister of Minerals and Energy 2010 (1) SA 104 (GNP). Under the common law, the mineral rights holder was under no obligation to exploit the rights: to mine, in other words. The new mineral-law dispensation introduced a system of state custodianship as the basis for regulatory control over minerals and mining, and also made it clear that the only way to acquire new rights is to obtain them from the state. The Mining Titles Registration Act (MTRA)Act 16 of 1997. contains transitional provisions which facilitate the conversion of mining rights obtained under the previous legislative dispensation into rights in terms of the new legislative system. The five-year transitional period created by the MPRDA has now lapsed. =Ownership= The common-law principle of cuius est solum eius est usque ad coelum et ad inferos has it that the owner of land is the owner not only of the surface but of everything above and below it. The MPRDA provides,s 3(1) however, that mineral and petroleum resources are the common heritage of all people in South Africa, for whose benefit the state is the custodian, although the MPRDA does not expressly reserve ownership of \\"unsevered\\" minerals or petroleum to the state. According to one view, ownership of minerals and petroleum not yet extracted from the land is vested in the state; another view seeks to distinguish mineral and petroleum resources from minerals and petroleum as such, so that the collective wealth of minerals and petroleum vests in the state, while ownership of unsevered minerals still vests in the owner of the land, even though the owner may not be able to exploit such minerals. A third view holds that the state's \\"custodianship\\" of mineral and petroleum resources does not amount to ownership of unsevered minerals and petroleum: Subject to the public-trust doctrine, the landowner remains the owner of unextracted minerals and petroleum. A fourth view is that it is irrelevant where ownership of minerals and petroleum in the soil lies. AgriSA v Minister of Minerals and Energy; Van Rooyen v Minister of Minerals and Energy, however, shows that this is not merely an academic question. Res publicae A fifth view is that, in terms of the MPRDA,s 3(1). mineral and petroleum resources are a new category of res publicae,\\"In our opinion, the res publicae argument is the most plausible explanation of the ownership regime introduced by the MPRDA\\" (Mostert & Pope 272). placing mineral and petroleum resources under the custodianship of the state. The underlying property rights of the landowner in unextracted minerals have not been destroyed in theory, but such rights can no longer be of much practical use. The state, in its custodial role, is endowed with the capacity to regulate access to the resources and is obliged to ensure their optimal exploitation. The MPRDA's provisions are not exhaustive. It is silent about ownership of minerals and petroleum once these are extracted, whether lawfully or not. It has been submitted that the common law applies residually, so that the holders of various rights (prospecting rights, mining permits, mining rights, exploration rights or production rights) who are entitled to remove and dispose of the minerals or petroleum acquire ownership of the minerals or petroleum upon extraction. =Important concepts= Three basic concepts are important for an understanding of this area of the law, namely \\"land,\\" \\"minerals\\" and \\"petroleum.\\" \\"Land\\" includes not only \\"dry\\" land but also, in terms of the MPRDA, the sea.s 1. Ownership of dry land lies with the person in whose name it is registered. To qualify as a \\"mineral,\\" a substance must be in solid, liquid or gaseous form, and occur naturally in or on the earth or water; it must, furthermore, be a product of a geological process, or it must occur in residue stockpiles or deposits. Petroleum is a substance which may be any liquid or solid hydrocarbon or combustible gas existing in a natural condition in the earth's crust. =Rights= The state may grant or refuse different kinds of rights in respect of mineral or petroleum resources and the land to which the rights relate. Such rights include * reconnaissance permissions; * prospecting rights; * permissions to remove minerals during prospecting; * retention permits; * mining permits; and * mining rights. As explained previously, the granting of prospecting or mining rights does not as such confer ownership of unsevered minerals. Expropriation and compensation Some commentators have argued that the provisions of the MPRDA amount to \\"institutional expropriation\\" of mineral rights. Other scholars have preferred a case-by-case analysis to determine how conventional common-law rights have been substituted by new rights under the MPRDA, while yet others argue that the MPRDA amounts to nothing more than a legitimate exercise of the state's regulatory powers over property law. The procedure for expropriation is set out in the MPRDA, and the state has certain obligations in respect of compensation. Nature The MPRDA classifies a prospecting right, mining right, exploration right or production right granted by the Minister (or delegated person in the case of prospecting rights) as \\"a limited real right in respect of the mineral or petroleum and the land to which such right relates.\\"s 5(1). A contract of prospecting, mining, exploration or production must be in notarial form to be registered. The MPRDA is silent about the nature of the other rights to minerals or petroleum that it recognises. These may only be recorded and filed. It has been suggested, accordingly, that these rights are personal in nature. All rights granted by the Minister are personal rights. In Meepo v Kotze,2008 (1) SA 104 (NC). the court indicated that the rights come into existence once the Minister, as representative of the custodian state, agrees to grant the applicant a right to prospect for minerals on specified land for a specified period. Prospecting rights, mining rights, exploration rights and production rights become limited real rights upon registration. Content The MPRDA provides descriptions of the scope of the rights that may be created. These include * prospecting rights; * mining rights; * production rights; and * exploration rights. The MPRDA details the content of these rights. The most prominent duty of right holders is payment (of levies or fees or other consideration) to the state. Competing rights of the surface owner In the event of an irreconcilable difference between a landowner and the holder of a mineral right, the mineral right holder takes precedence. This principle was confirmed in the case of Anglo Operations v Sandhurst Estates2007 (2) SA 363 (SCA). The Minister is expressly empowered by the MPRDA to expropriate property for the purposes of prospecting or mining if this is necessary to achieve the MPRDA's objectives. As per Meepo v Kotze, compensation must be paid by the state to a person who can prove that his property has been expropriated in terms of a provision of the MPRDA. Transfer and termination Registered mineral or petroleum rights can be alienated. Where a different right-holder is envisaged, the written consent of the Director-General of the Department of Minerals and Energy is required. Mineral or petroleum rights that are not registered may not be transferred or leased or encumbered by mortgage. Mineral and petroleum rights are not infinite; they last for a predetermined period of time. When that period expires, the rights expire with it. The rights also lapse when the right-holder dies. In the case of a juristic person, the rights lapse when the juristic person is deregistered without a successor in title. =Social and environmental responsibility= In addition to regulating access to mineral and petroleum resources, the MPRDA seeks to promote various social objectives. Two of the most important of these are the protection of the natural environment and the achievement of Black Economic Empowerment: Right- holders are responsible for rehabilitating and managing negative environmental impacts, while the MPRDA seeks to expand substantially and meaningfully the opportunities for historically-disadvantaged persons, including women, to enter the mineral and industries. This latter objective is reflected, inter alia, in the requirements for the conversion of old-order mining rights to new-order rights and the requirements for applications for new mining rights. Holders of mineral and petroleum rights are required, furthermore, to demonstrate compliance with black economic empowerment on an annual basis. Water Water as a natural resource is now governed by the National Water Act (NWA)Act 36 of 1998. and the Water Services Act (WSA)Act 108 of 1997. In terms of these statutes, water as a natural resource has been placed under the custodianship and responsibility of the South African government. Previously, categories of public and private water existed, and private rights in water formed an integral part of landownership. The NWA terminated the distinction between public and private water in 1998, so that all water is now regarded as public water. Automatic private rights in water have been abolished and replaced with use rights or licences. Rights in water therefore no longer form part of the content of ownership. They must now be dealt with in terms of limited real rights in property, rather than in terms of ownership and its entitlements. =History= In the period prior to 1997, ownership entitlements in respect of water were the point of departure. A landowner was the owner of all water arising on or beneath the surface of his land. His ownership rights entitled him to use the water, within the limits of the law, as he wished, and to grant water servitudes to non-owners where appropriate. Hence water could be owned privately, or a limited real right in water could vest in another person: for example, where neighbouring landowners did not have sufficient water on their own properties. The focus since 1997 has been on access to water as a basic human right, linked with the constitutional right to dignity.s 10. Ownership entitlements in respect of water have developed into limited real rights or use rights (licences). =Common law= The common-law principle of \\"riparian ownership\\" dominated the South African water dispensation until 1998. Unlike so much of South African common law (and indeed most of the South African common law relating to water), the principle did not originate in the Netherlands; it developed with reference to English law. The twofold foundations of South African water law, Roman-Dutch and English, were not best suited to the South African context, where water is a scarcer resource. =Water Act= The distinction between public and private water was embodied in the Water Act (WA),Act 54 of 1965. the main focus of which was to regulate access to and use of water, which the WA attempted to classify as either public or private. Classification was essential, since it determined whether or not landowners could use the water as they pleased. The WA acknowledged the private claims of riparian landowners regarding public water, as well as all claims of landowners in relation to private water. =New water paradigm= The new water dispensation, introduced in 1997 and 1998, did away with private control of water in favour of firm state control. The changes in water law were prompted by a fundamental political and legal change in the country: the advent of democracy and the enactment of the Constitution. The Constitution specifically mandated reform of water law, guaranteeing the right of access to sufficient food and water,s 27(1)(b). imposing duties on the state in this regard,s 27(2) stipulating that property, not limited to land, includes water,s 25(4). and providing for the right to a safe environment.s 24. The WSA sets out who has the responsibility for realising access to water in practice, as well as how this is to be done. The NWA embodies the departure from the common-law approach to private and public water; the point of departure is now \\"authorisation to use water,\\" as opposed to ownership of water. The Water Services Act provides the technical and practical framework within which the water-services providers operate at various levels. Water services comprise the provision of water supply and sanitation services. The WSA also prescribes norms and standards, as well as a monitoring system, in respect of water supply and services. A water-services authority, responsible for ensuring access to water services, is a municipality, including a district or rural council, as defined in the Local Government Transition Act.Act 209 of 1993. The National Water Act aims fundamentally to reform water law in South Africa. It takes as its point of departure the fact that water is a scarce natural resource. Government is required to take steps to regulate and preserve this resource, taking into account environmental and sustainable-development considerations. The NWA effectively \\"opens up\\" the notion of water in South Africa, that it may be accessed more equitably. The new premise is that a person is entitled to use water only if that use is permissible under the Act. The state acts as a trustee or custodian in respect of water, and is therefore responsible for the use and flow and control of all water in South Africa. Any person (including a juristic person) who wants access to and use of water may access and use it only in accordance with the NWA. Existing lawful water use may continue under certain conditions, but for other purposes a licence is required to gain access to and make use of water. The NWA makes provision for personal or praedial servitudes where there is a need to take water from one property to another. These are statutory servitudes which differ from common-law water servitudes, not only with respect to content and transferability, but also with respect to their overall aim and purpose.

Despite her wealthy aristocratic background, she had republican sympathies, shaped in part by having been a favoured pupil of Mary Wollstonecraft. In Italy in later life, she reciprocated her governess's care by offering maternal aid and advice to Wollstonecraft's daughter Mary Shelley (author of Frankenstein) and her travelling companions, husband Percy Bysshe Shelley and stepsister Claire Clairmont. Childhood Margaret King was born to the Anglo-Irish Kingsborough family, leading members of the Protestant Ascendancy. Her mother, Caroline Fitzgerald (one of the wealthiest heiresses in Ireland and first cousin of the revolutionary Lord Edward FitzGerald), was married off at 15 to Robert King, second Earl of Kingston. The family seat was Mitchelstown Castle, in the north County Cork town of Mitchelstown. As a young teenager, Margaret's life was touched by the pioneer educator and proto- feminist Mary Wollstonecraft, to whom she was a \\"most devoted protegee\\".Melissa Benn's review of Lyndall Gordon's biography of Mary Wollstonecraft, Vindication This appointment as her governess did not last more than a year, as Wollstonecraft could not get along with Lady Kingsborough.See, for example, Todd (MW), 106‚Äì7; Tomalin, 66; 79‚Äì80; Sunstein, 127-28. The children found her an inspiring instructor; Margaret King would later say she \\"had freed her mind from all superstitions\\".Todd (MW), 116. Some of Wollstonecraft's experiences during this year would make their way into her only children's book, Original Stories from Real Life (1788).Tomalin, 64‚Äì88; Wardle, 60ff; Sunstein, 160-61. The maternal teacher who frames these stories is called Mrs Mason, a name Margaret King adopted in later life. Early adult life, marriage, children She acquired the title Lady Mount Cashell by marrying Stephen Moore, 2nd Earl Mount Cashell on 12 September 1791. She was 19 and he 21. The couple eventually had seven children. The eldest son, Stephen Moore, 3rd Earl Mount Cashell, went on to graduate from Trinity College, Cambridge, marry a Swiss woman, and live in several countries. He founded a farming community on Amherst Island in Upper Canada (now Ontario), and was judged \\"an improving and evangelical landlord\\". The second son, Robert, was born in 1793. The third son, Edward Moore, became a Canon of Windsor Cathedral. The eldest daughter, Helena, was born in March 1795. One of the younger daughters, Jane Elizabeth, married in 1819 William Yates Peel, from the political and merchant family.George Peel, ‚ÄòPeel, William Yates (1789‚Äì1858)‚Äô, rev. M. C. Curthoys, Oxford Dictionary of National Biography, Oxford University Press, 2004 accessed 18 May 2017 In 1798, her brother Robert King, 1st Viscount Lorton was involved in a scandal. He was tried for the murder of a relative who had seduced their younger sister. In the context of the Irish Rebellion of 1798, she joined the Society of United Irishmen and wrote pamphlets about the Union Crisis in 1799‚Äì1800.[Ascendancy: Lady Mount Cashell, Lady Moira, Mary Wollstonecraft and the Union Pamphlets Janet Todd Eighteenth-Century Ireland / Iris an d√° chult√∫r Vol. 18, (2003), pp. 98‚Äì117 (article consists of 20 pages) Published by: Eighteenth-Century Ireland Society Stable URL: https://www.jstor.org/stable/30070996] She was a friend and cousin of the aristocrat and republican revolutionary Lord Edward FitzGerald. Her eldest brother, George King, was a prominent Loyalist. In December 1801 she embarked on a grand tour as a group of \\"nine Irish adventurers\\", including her husband and a friend, the diarist Catherine Wilmot. Wilmot wrote extensive letters home, some of which were published in 1920 as An Irish peer on the continent (1801‚Äì1803) being a narrative of the tour of Stephen, 2nd earl Mount Cashell, through France, Italy, etc. These describe much detail of the Cashells' life and habits, including their lavish entertaining, especially during the first nine months in Paris. In June 1802 the Cashells had another son, Richard Francis Stanislaus Moore, and Wilmot records that its godparents were William Parnel, \\"the Polish Countess Myscelska\\", and the American minister (equivalent to ambassador, and presumably Robert Livingston, who was in post 1801-1804). While in Europe, Margaret met an Irishman named George William Tighe. The two fell in love. Margaret eventually left her husband and eloped with George to Italy. Under the laws of the time, the father maintained control of the children's lives, and the mother was not allowed to take any of them with her when she left. Margaret and George called themselves 'Mr and Mrs Mason', taking the names as described above. Later life She decided to study medicine at Jena, which necessitated cross-dressing. (She was as tall as a man.) She later studied with professor of surgery, Andrea Vacc√° Berlinghieri of the University of Pisa. She wrote a book of household medicine for the care of babies and children. By this point in her life she was described as a \\"no nonsense grande dame\\".Mary Shelley: romance and reality by Emily W. Sunstein, p. 175. She published her first book with The Juvenile Library, the London team of William Godwin, widower of her governess-mentor Mary Wollstonecraft, and his second wife, Mary Jane Clairmont. She had visited and grown friendly with them when she was in London in 1807.Before Victoria: extraordinary women of the British romantic era p. 49 by Elizabeth Campbell Denlinger, 2005. She set up home at Casa Silva, Pisa, with Tighe and their daughters Lauretta and Nerina. They were visited there in 1820 by a young threesome: the poet Percy Shelley, his wife the writer Mary Shelley (daughter of Godwin and Wollstonecraft, and already author of Frankenstein), and their translator her stepsister, Claire Clairmont. She felt maternal towards the women, as they were both in a sense daughters of her life-changing motherly governess. She offered \\"sage advice\\" to Shelley about his health and to Clairmont about her career. She introduced them all to a new intellectual and social circle in Pisa, and helped Mary set up her household, finding them pleasant lodgings and advising on servants.Young Romantics: The Shelleys, Byron and Other Tangled Lives by Daisy Hay, 2010, p. 184 Tighe provided Percy Shelley with a great deal of material on chemistry, biology, and statistics.

Margaret, Lady Mount Cashell, died in January 1835 and was buried in the Old English Cemetery, Livorno (then known to the English as Leghorn). She was described, in the 1920 introduction to Wilmot's diaries, as \\"socially charming and attractive, highly cultivated, upright and refined\\", but \\"harsh to her children, a Freethinker in religion, and imbued with what were then the most extravagant political notions\\".

The Richtersveld community brought a claim for the restoration of its ancestral land in terms of the Restitution of Land Rights Act, a statutory mechanism giving effect to the government's constitutionally-mandated land reform and restitution programme.Mostert & Pope 16. The appellant in this case was the mining corporation Alexkor, which had an interest in the diamondiferous parts of the Richtersveld area. An important aspect of the case was the community's assertion that it used the land according to its indigenous customs, an assertion upheld in both the Supreme Court of Appeal (SCA) and the Constitutional Court, and on the basis whereof the land was returned to the community. In defining and determining what is entailed by customary-law ownership of land, the SCA equated it with common-law ownership, while the Constitutional Court found that its content should be ascertained by studying the customs and uses of the community. It was thus decided that the Richtersveld community's claim to the land incorporated a claim to the minerals in the land, and that the community's entitlement to both the land and the minerals should be acknowledged and restored. Incorporated in this was the right of the community to claim compensation for past exploitation of the land by Alexkor and the state. The court's reasoning shows \\"how the redefinition of the sources of South African property law affects the protection offered to relationships with land.\\"Mostert & Pope 16.

It evaluates learning, experience, and cognitive skills. The test was created by Charles Golden in 1981 and based on previous work by Alexander Luria that emphasizes a qualitative instead of quantitative approach. The original, adult version is for use with ages fifteen and over, while the Luria-Nebraska Neuropsychological Battery for Children (LNNB-C) can be used with ages eight to twelve; both tests take two to three hours to administer. The LNNB has 269 items divided among fourteen scales, which are motor, rhythm, tactile, visual, receptive speech, expressive speech, writing, reading, arithmetic, memory, intellectual processes, pathognomonic, left hemisphere, and right hemisphere. The test is graded on scales that are correlated to regions of the brain to help identify which region may be damaged. The Luria-Nebraska has been found to be reliable and valid; it is comparable in this sense to other neuropsychological tests in its ability to differentiate between brain damage and mental illness. The test is used to diagnose and determine the nature of cognitive impairment, including the location of the brain damage, to understand the patient's brain structure and abilities, to pinpoint causes of behavior, and to help plan treatment.  History  The purpose of early neuropsychological tests was simply to determine whether or not a person had a brain injury or brain damage. Although they can still perform this function, modern brain imaging has made it less necessary. Instead, these tests now serve to describe the injury, including its location and the degree of impairment. The ability to perform these functions began with Alexander Luria's original qualitative procedures.Golden, C. J. (2004). The Adult Luria-Nebraska Neuropsychological Battery. In G. Goldstein, S. R. Beers, & M. Hersen (Eds.), Comprehensive handbook of psychological assessment, Vol. 1: Intellectual and neuropsychological assessment (pp. 133-146). Hoboken, NJ, US: John Wiley & Sons Inc. The work of this Russian neuropsychologist would become the basis for the theory behind the Luria-Nebraska Neuropsychological Battery.Purisch, A. D. (2001). Misconceptions about the Luria-Nebraska Neuropsychological Battery. Neurorehabilitation, 16(4), 275-280. Compared to traditional tests, these procedures were better at determining patients' strengths and weaknesses; however, their standardization was prevented by their lack of fixed content and the fact they had no definite method of scoring or accuracy determination. Luria's original method, released in 1966, was revised by Christensen in 1975 to describe the procedure more in-depth. This revision made possible a version that combined the qualitative and quantitative aspects of the procedures. In 1977 Charles Golden presented the Luria-South Dakota, a new version of the battery created at the University of South Dakota that combined Luria and Christensen‚Äôs works. To develop this version and ensure it covered everything from both Luria and Christensen, Golden first created an exam that took approximately 18 hours to administer and contained nearly 2,000 procedures. From this base items were selectively removed if they were found to lack reliability or validity, be repetitive, be too long, or fail to accurately discriminate a brain injury. Existing interest in Luria‚Äôs work made this battery instantly popular, and as it was circulated, demand and research only grew. Western Psychological Services created the current revision, the Luria- Nebraska Neuropsychological Battery. It was published in 1980 in the Journal of Consulting and Clinical Psychology and the International Journal of Neuroscience. The Luria-Nebraska has been the subject of some debate that has split the neuropsychology field. It faced criticism for its combination of quantitative and qualitative methods, the wide variety of its fourteen scales, and the possibility that it did not include enough different neuropsychological skills or did not distinguish brain dysfunction adequately. Large empirical studies have suggested these criticisms are largely unfounded and based on misinformation or lack of understanding of how the test is interpreted. However, these concerns resulted in a decrease in use of the battery, and some negative views of it still persist despite evidence of its reliability and validity.  Administration and scoring  For the adult version of this standardized test, used with ages 15 and above, there are 269 items that are scored from 0 to 2. On this continuum a score of 0 represents a normal non-damaged brain and a higher score near 2 depicts brain damage. None of these items measures exactly the same thing, although each of them may have alternative ways of measuring the same behavior. These 269 items are divided among fourteen scales, which are motor, rhythm, tactile, visual, receptive speech, expressive speech, writing, reading, arithmetic, memory, intellectual processes, pathognomonic, left hemisphere, and right hemisphere. The time it takes to administer the task is about 2 to 3 hours.Golden, C. J., Ariel, R. N., Wilkening, G. N., Moses, J. J., McKay, S. E., & MacInnes, W. D. (1982). Analytic techniques in the interpretation of the Luria-Nebraska Neuropsychological Battery. Journal of Consulting and Clinical Psychology, 50(1), 40-48. doi:10.1037/0022-006X.50.1. The reason for the long length of time is the several items that need to be tested, and this is also why the test cannot be administered to very young children. By testing the limits of patients' performance, it is then able to make correlations between a normal and damaged brain. There is some discussion on the standardized interruption of the test. The children's version of the test is for 8‚Äì12 years old. This test has 149 different items that also measure on a continuum from 0 to 2. It also takes roughly 2 to 3 hours to administer and the same constructs are being measured.  Reliability and validity  Studies have show that the LNNB is stable over time. A study has shown that the lowest test re-test reliability of the LNNB is a .77 and this is within the limitations of clinical tests.Golden, C. J., Berg, R. A., & Graber, B. (1982). Test‚Äìretest reliability of the Luria-Nebraska Neuropsychological Battery in stable, chronically impaired patients. Journal of Consulting and Clinical Psychology, 50(3), 452-454. doi:10.1037/0022-006X.50.3.452 Also, studies have combined the Luria-Nebraska Battery with existing tests in psychology, speech, and education to look at the reliability of the battery. This version of the test had 33 scales and by comparing non-brain-injured control groups to brain- injured patients it was found that the test is very effective at discriminating between normal and brain-injured subjects.Teichner, G., Golden, C.J., Crum, T., & Bradley, J. (1998). Establishing the reliability and validity of the Luria Nebraska neuropsychological battery-III. Archives of Clinical Neuropsychology, 13(1), 99-100. Studies have shown that the LNNB has yielded an 86% correct hit rate for identifying patients correctly.Golden, G J., Moses, J. A., Ftshbume, F. J., Engum, E., Lewis, G. P., Wisniewski, A. M., Conley, F. K., Berg, R. A., and Graber, B. 1961. Cross-validation o f the Luria- Nebraska Neuropsychological Battery for the presence, lateralization and localization of brain damage. Journal o f Consulting and Clinical Psychology 49, 491-507. When looking at the left and right hemisphere scales, the test is based on the assumption that the left hemisphere is verbally dominant and composed of the motor and tactile scales that represent right- hand sensory/motor performance while the right hemisphere consists of items representing left-hand sensory/ motor performance. When looking at lateralization reports of the test, it yields an average hit rate of 78% on comparison of left and right scales with the highest hit rate being 92%.Golden, C. J. 1961. Diagnosis and Rehabilitation in Clinical Neuropsychology. Springfield, IL: Charles C Thomas. Also, when looking at localization of chronic hospitalized patients with injuries in the frontal, sensorimotor, temporal, and parietal-occipital areas, the test was 88% effective in localizing the brain damage, but the limit to this report was a small sample size of 60 patients.Lewis, G. P., Golden, C. J., Moses, J. A., Osmon, D. G, Purisch, A D. and Hammeke, T. A. 1979. Localization o f cerebral dysfunction with a standardized version o f Luna‚Äôs neuropsychological battery. Journal o f Consulting and C linical Psychology 47, 1003-1019.  Applications  Applications of the LNNB are generally seen in clinical settings such as hospitals, counseling, and research. Research has shown its shorter testing time, cost to administer, and effectiveness allow for cost-efficient and reliable results.Guilmette, T. J., & Faust, D. (1991). Characteristics of neuropsychologists who prefer the Halstead-Reitan or the Luria-Nebraska Neuropsychological Battery. Professional Psychology: Research And Practice, 22(1), 80-83. doi:10.1037/0735-7028.22.1.80 The LNNB has been used to determine brain functions after trauma to the brain occurs and to pin-point what mental disorder is present. Through its development and revision, the battery has also been shown to aid in presenting other underlying ailments that could not be detected by other sources. In some cases the LNNB has been seen to show sensitivity to more subtle abnormalities in brain functioning, which researchers did not expect.Mittenberg, W., Kasprisin, A., & Farage, C. (1985). Localization and diagnosis in aphasia with the Luria-Nebraska Neuropsychological Battery. Journal of Consulting and Clinical Psychology, 53(3), 386-392. doi:10.1037/0022-006X.53.3.386 Due to its ability to target the damage of the brain, if any, as well as the mental disorder, the LNNB is useful in finding treatment options, assessing research, and aiding in choosing research participants.Schaughency, E. A., Lahey, B. B., Hynd, G. W., Stone, P. A., Piacentini, J. C., & Frick, P. J. (1989).

Buddleja madagascariensis is cultivated as an ornamental plant. Intolerant of sub-zero (< 32 ¬∞F) temperatures, it can only reliably be grown outdoors in subtropical and tropical climate gardens, such as those of Southern California and Florida in the USA, although in temperate coastal regions it can survive on south-facing walls, with added winter frost protection. Elsewhere, it is essentially a conservatory and greenhouse plant. The shrub is grown under glass as part of the NCCPG National Collection of Buddleja held by the Longstock Park Nursery, near Stockbridge, Hampshire, England. Hardiness: RHS H2, USDA zones 9 - 10.

Giants were a popular theme in theosophical literature, Atlantis, lost continents and later the earth mysteries movement of Britain in the 1970s.thanks History The concept of giants was discussed by the theosophist and occult author Blavatsky who wrote about the existence of giants in her book The Secret Doctrine connecting them to her theory of root races and claiming they correspond with Hindu cycle of the universe. According to theosophists, ape-like giants were the third root race who lived on the continent of Lemuria.Martin Gardner, Fads and fallacies in the name of science, 1957, p. 168 Theosophists also linked giants to the Atlantean race. The German occultist Guido von List was influenced by Blavatsky's writings on giants and mixed together paganism, mythology, and theosophy, creating a basis for the belief in giants living in different realms based on the first four rounds of the root race theory.Nicholas Goodrick-Clarke, Occult Roots of Nazism: Secret Aryan Cults and Their Influence on Nazi Ideology, 1993, p. 53 R. A. Schwaller de Lubicz, an Egyptologist and traditionalist, believed that giants had roamed the earth, and that after the fall of Adam, humanity fell into a state of degeneration.Gary Lachman, Politics and the Occult: The Left, the Right, and the Radically Unseen, 2008, p. 190 Lewis Spence, a writer on mythology, was critical of theosophy but accepted the existence of giants. He researched English folklore and mythology depicting such giants such as Magog and the British giant Albion.Lewis Spence, 1976, The Occult Sciences in Atlantis, p. 24 Another writer who was opposed to occultism was the British journalist and author William Comyns Beaumont. Like Spence, he accepted the existence of giants based on folklore, mythology, and archeology. Beaumont believed that Britain was the location of Atlantis and that it was occupied by a giant race of Aryans.Karl Shaw, Curing Hiccups with Small Fires: A Delightful Miscellany of Great British Eccentrics In the 1970s many of the authors of the earth mysteries movement in Britain wrote about Giants. John Michell wrote about the existence of giants in his book The View over Atlantis. Anthony Roberts wrote the book Sowers of Thunder: Giants in Myth and History in 1978, in which he claimed that giants were the original inhabitants of the British Isles and linked Alfred Watkins' ley lines to the British giants.Christopher Chippindale, Stonehenge complete, Cornell University Press, 1983, p. 246 References Category:Esotericism * Category:Theosophical philosophical concepts ","title":"Giants (esotericism)"},{"id":"32081377","text":"Coleophora mausoleae is a moth of the family Coleophoridae.

Biography Fyodor Avgustovich Stepun was born in Russia on 18 February 1884, in Moscow. After attending secondary school in Moscow he went as a student to Heidelberg, and there in 1910 he obtained his doctorate for a thesis on Vladimir Solovyov's philosophy of history. Between 1910 and 1914 Stepun edited the international philosophical journal, Logos, and travelled across Russia lecturing on philosophy, literature and culture. During the first World War he was an officer in a Siberian regiment, and after the Russian revolution was an army commissar under the Russian Provisional Government. From 1920 to 1922 he directed the state experimental theatre; but in 1922 he was deported from the Soviet Union. He settled in Germany, working first in Berlin, and afterwards as a professor of sociology in Dresden (1926-1937). During this period he published in Russian his books on 'Life and creation' (1923) and 'Letters of an Artillery Ensign' (1925), as well as Wie war as moglich? (1929), Das Antlitz Russlands und das Gesicht der Revolution (1934) and The Russian Soul and Revolution (1936). In 1937 he was expelled from his teaching-post by the Nazi authorities. From 1946 he worked as a professor of Russian cultural studies at Munich University, and published several works: Vergangenes und Unvergangliches (1947; Russian version, Byvshee i Nesbyvsheesya, 1956), Theater und Film (1953), Der Bolshewismus und die Christliche Existenz (1959), and in Russian 'Encounters' (1962). Stepun was a fierce opponent of Bolshevism, as well as Nazism. His philosophical doctrine has been described as neo-Kantist transcendentalism linked with religious metaphysics, close to the ideas of Vladimir Solovyov and Nikolai Berdyaev. Stepun died on 23 February 1965.  References   External links  * Fedor Stepun Papers. General Collection, Beinecke Rare Book and Manuscript Library.

Route In 1890, Richardson was employed on the water route between Newport and Yaquina City, making the trip twice a day.United States War Department, Annual Report (1890), at page 2,973 (accessed 06-14-11) In 1893, T.M. Richardson was also used to tow rock scows for government engineering works.United States War Department, Annual Report, Vol. 2 (1893), at page 3,366 (accessed 06-14-11). The water route from Yaquina City to Newport was four miles long.  Career T.M. Richardson at the dock at Newport. A band is playing on the dock to welcome the new arrivals. There appears to be a barge loaded with passengers on the left side of the steamer. From 1888 to at least 1895, Captain Chatterton used T.M. Richardson for ferrying and towing on Yaquina Bay, in Lincoln County, on the central Oregon coast. The original head of navigation on the Yaquina River was Elk City. Elk City was about twenty (20) miles upriver from Yaquina City. According to B.F. Jones, a steamboat man of Yaquina Bay and river, vessels drawing 8 to 10 feet of water were reported to have been easily able to reach Elk City. This included the Richardson, which drew 6 or 7 feet of water, the General Wright, a government vessel, drawing 8 to 10 feet, and the Volante, a smaller steamer which was reported to have drawn 8.5 to 9 feet of water. However, in 1910 it was claimed that quarrying and logging along the banks of the Yaquina River had caused silt and debris to wash down the river, making it more shallow and less navigable. The machinery for Richardson came from the Tressa May, also known as the Teresa May, in 1888, when the Tressa May was condemned and taken out of service. The engines were not new even in the Tressa May. During the winter months of 1888 and 1889, Richardson worked under government contract moving scows of rock and pilings for the construction work on jetties at the mouth of Yaquina Bay. Captain Chatterton was in charge of the Richardson in 1891. On April 5, 1893 the Tacoma steamship Alice Blanchard with a cargo of 271 tons of wheat and 100 tons of coal, was sighted in distress off the Yaquina bar. The only steam tug then in Yaquina Bay, the Resolute, was then under repair and unable to assist. Some fishermen did board the Alice Blanchard and succeeded in drifting the vessel over the bar. T.M. Richardson and another Yaquina Bay steamer, Volanta and then went to assist the Alice Blanchard the vessel went aground on the south jetty, about from the tramway then being used for jetty construction. Every rope fastened to the vessel by the steamers parted and the vessel settled in the sand. On July 4, 1893, Richardson transported 89 passengers from Toledo to Newport.  Quarry service In later 1893 Richardson was engaged in quarry service. The steamer made its last quarry trip for the year on October 31, 1893, after which it was expected to have been laid up for overhaul and repairs. Richardson was under a monthly contract to the U.S. Corps of Engineers to tow rock barges from the quarry to the jetties which were under construction at the mouth of Yaquina Bay. For this work, as well as incidental transportation on the bay, the owners of Richardson were paid $500 per month, earning a total of $2000 on the contract. While under the contract, Richardson handled 91 scows laden with a total of 21,887 tons of rock, for jetty construction. The quarry was located at Mill Creek, on the Yaquina River, about 12 miles up from Newport. The government had rented the quarry from C.H. Williams for an annual rental of $325 per year. Later, in April 1897 the steamer was reported to be engaged in transporting building stone from the Rochester quarry to Newport, to be transshipped to San Francisco. Ownership dispute In May 1895 there was a dispute between two parties, Moss and Richardson, over ownership of the steamer. Testimony in the dispute was taken at Newport on Tuesday, May 28, 1895 before Referee J. Fred Yates. An earlier report, from February 22, 1894, was that there was a good chance that litigation would arise over the steamer Richardson, with a silent partner in the boat demanding an accounting and a settlement. On October 4, 1895, a writ of attachment, in the amount of $319, was sworn out at the Lincoln County court against the steamer Richardson, representing attorney‚Äôs fees said to be owing by H.A. Moss to A.L. McFadden. Operations 1996-1900 Advertisement for rally for William Jennings Bryan. In March 1896, Richardson took the place of the steamer Volante, caring passengers, mail and mail and freight between Newport and Yaquina City, after Volante was destroyed by fire. In the summer of 1896, Richardson was involved in a collision with the much larger ocean- going steamer Farallon, which left Richardson with a smashed guard rail. On Tuesday, July 21, 1896, Richardson was brought up to the gridiron (a form of drydock) at Toledo to have the guard rail repaired, and to be repainted and have other repairs. In September 1896, the Richardson was chartered by the ‚ÄúSilver forces of Lincoln County for a ‚ÄúGrand Bryan Ratification‚Äù to occur on Tuesday, September 15, 1896. The rally was held at Toledo, Oregon. Richardson transported over one hundred people from Newport and Yaquina City. The steamer Mascot also brought in a crowd of Bryan supporters from Elk City. According to a newspaper report, ‚Äúspeaking commenced at 2:30 at the courthouse, first by Hon. J.K. Weatherford, of Albany, who poured in hot shot for Bryan and free silver for an hour and a half.‚Äù In the fall of 1896, Richardson was employed on the lower Yaquina river transporting fish for a cannery at Newport. By October 15, 1896, Richardson was tied up to the dock at Toledo, under the care of the purser, Charley Jahn. The vessel was back in operation by December 31, 1896, when it transported passengers from Newport, Yaquina City, and Toledo to Elk City for a dance. In February 1897, it was reported that the Western Transportation Company had purchased the T.M. Richardson, and intended to place the vessel on the Newport-Yaquina City route. This would make Richardson the only steamboat on the route, and represented a return to the route, by Richardson, after a ‚Äúlong lay-off‚Äù. In the third week of October 1898, Charley Emigh, mate of the Richardson, fell on deck and landed on a piece of equipment, breaking two ribs. The steamer Richardson came up to Toledo on the morning of March 10, 1899 to pick up a load of hay. On May 18, 1900, Richardson was reported to be back in operation, having been in dry dock for repairs. Operations 1901-1904 In the summer of 1902, the Richardson, under Captain M.M. Davis, a resident of Newport, operated between Newport and the railhead at Yaquina, where passengers from inland points would detrain for transport by water to the ocean resorts. Captain Davis had built a passenger- carrying barge to be lashed on to the steamer, and with it, he said the vessel could transport 500 people at once. The 1902 summer season was reported to have been the best for the seaside resorts since the summer of 1897. A later critic of the Richardson, B.F. Jones, stated that even in the best condition, the steamer was never licensed to carry more than 100 persons., On September 19, 1903, T.M. Richardson stranded on a bar in the Yaquina River while en route to Newport. Two surfmen from the U.S. Life-Saving Service station at Yaquina Bay reached the Richardson in a small boat. They were able to take off all 28 passengers, as well as the mail and express items. At high tide the vessel was refloated.United States Life-Saving Service, Annual Report (1905) at page 100. (accessed 06-14-11). In 1904, Newport, Oregon was a small resort community with a year-round population of about 300 people. Yaquina City was about three miles (5 km) up Yaquina Bay. In 1904 T.M. Richardson spent most of its time running between Newport and Yaquina City. In 1904, T.M. Richardson was the only steamboat in service on Yaquina Bay, although there were three or four gasoline launches operating on the Yaquina River.United States War Dept., Annual Report, Part 3 (1904), at page 3,521 (accessed 06-14-11). The rail terminus from the Willamette Valley was at Yaquina City, and with no roads to cover the six mile (10 km) distance to Newport, the only effective access was by water. T.M. Richardson continued to be used on this route, often with a barge lashed alongside, to carry additional passengers or baggage.Oregon Teachers Monthly, ‚ÄúNewport ‚Äì The Famous Summer Resort‚Äù Vol. 11 (1906) pages 630-632 (accessed 06-14-11). New ownership In late 1904, John Marshall and Charles Rivears, two Columbia River steamboat men, and their associates, acquired the steamers and the business of the Western Transportation Company, including the Richardson. Marshall had been the chief engineer on the Columbia river sternwheeler Ocklahama. Reported to have been a wealthy man, Marshall was the uncle of William Marshall, who owned an interest in the former Willamette River sternwheeler Leona, which was then in service on the route between Portland and the Lewis River, in southwestern Washington state. Both Marshall and Rivears had left the Columbia river steamboat business after a strike in 1902. The new company intended to bring a large steam launch onto Yaquina Bay, and operate it there. The new company also intended to build a new steamer to take the place of the Richardson. Last years On May 11, 1906, it was reported that two steamboat inspectors, Edwards and Fuller, would depart the following day from Portland for Yaquina City, to inspect the T.M. Richardson. T.M. Richardson, with passenger barge, June 1907 or earlier. For most of the summer of 1907, T.M. Richardson was out of operation undergoing repairs. Richardson had broken its propeller shaft. This was not the only time that Richardson had been out of service during the summer of 1907. Richardson was replaced on the route by the gasoline launch Gazelle, which arrived at Yaquina Bay from Portland on Saturday, August 3, 1907. (Gazelle was also expected to be used on fishing expeditions in the open ocean off of Yaquina Bay.) According to a critic of the Richardson, the gasoline launches towed the ‚Äúsame old boathouse scow that the Richardson tows when it is able to navigate.‚Äù By late September 1907, Richardson had been returned to service and was making runs between Newport and Yaquina City, where it met the trains of the Corvallis and Eastern Railroad. In August 1907, Richardson was being run by Captain Jacobson. The steamer was criticized, in that year, by B.F. Jones, who held a captain‚Äôs license and was familiar with marine transportation on Yaquina Bay.  Replacement In 1908, T.M. Richardson was replaced by a new vessel, the Newport (, 81 gross tons). The Newport-Yaquina City route was also purchased by Jack Fogarty and Capt. Jacobson from Capt. Chatterton.Newell, ed., McCurdy Marine History, at page 151. The boiler from Richardson was to be placed in the new steamer, Newport, which was built at Yaquina City to replace Richardson.

It was located first in the Prussian Province of the Frontier March of Posen-West Prussia, but also including the Pomeranian Lauenburg and B√ºtow Land. It was named after its seat in Schneidem√ºhl (Pi≈Ça) and belonged to the Eastern German Ecclesiastical Province under the Breslau Metropolia since 1930. History Parts of the newly Polish bishoprics of the Archdiocese of Gniezno-Pozna≈Ñ (until 1946 in personal union) and the Diocese of Culm remained with Germany after the boundary changes in 1919 and 1920 following World War I. On 1 December 1920 Archbishop Edmund Dalbor of Gniezno-Pozna≈Ñ appointed an archiepiscopal delegate with the powers of a vicar general for the five concerned deaneries with 45 parishes and 80,000-100,000 Catholic faithful. Bishop Augustinus Rosentreter of Culm again refused to separate his three concerned deaneries located in the eastern Pomeranian districts of B√ºtow (Bytow) and Lauenburg in Pomerania (Lƒôbork) and southwestern West Prussia with about 40,000 Catholic parishioners.In 1933 B√ºtow District comprised 617 km¬≤ with 6,070 Catholic parishioners among 27,510 inhabitants, the corresponding numbers for Lauenburg i. Pom. District were 1,289 km¬≤, 5,654 Catholics and a total population of 62,434. Tuczno Castle, seat of the Administrator of T√ºtz between 1920 and 1927. Nevertheless, the Holy See disentangled these deaneries of Culm in 1922 and subordinated them to the archiepiscopal delegate seated in T√ºtz (Tuczno). On 1 May 1923 the Holy See united the concerned deaneries to form the new Apostolic Administration of T√ºtz.Cf. . The Holy See entrusted protonotary Robert Weimann (1870‚Äì1925) with the Administration Apostolic of T√ºtz.Georg May, Ludwig Kaas: der Priester, der Politiker und der Gelehrte aus der Schule von Ulrich Stutz: 3 vols., Amsterdam: Gr√ºner, 1981-1982 (=Kanonistische Studien und Texte; vols. 33‚Äì35), vol. 1, p. 175. . On 6 July 1926 Maximilian Kaller succeeded Weimann. On Kaller's instigation the seat of the Administration was moved from T√ºtz to Schneidem√ºhl (Pi≈Ça) in 1927, where Kaller then took on the local parish. Schneidem√ºhl had become the capital of Frontier March of Posen-West Prussia Province, when the Free State of Prussia had reorganised its dissected remnants of the former Provinces of Posen and of West Prussia as a province of their own on 1 July 1922.In 1933 Posen-West Prussia comprised 7,695 km¬≤ with 123,310 Catholic parishioners among 337,578 inhabitants. Following the 1929 Prussian Concordat, concluded between the Nuncio to Prussia, Eugenio Pacelli, and the Free State, the administration was elevated to Territorial Prelature within the new Eastern German Ecclesiastical Province under the Roman Catholic Archdiocese of Wroc≈Çaw on 13 August 1930. The prelates were not to be consecrated as bishops. Kaller was elevated to be the first prelate. In 1930 Kaller founded Katholischer Siedlungsdienst (Catholic Colonisation Service) in Berlin and entrusted Ludwig Sebald Polzin (1892‚Äì1964) with its management. During his term the colonisation service bought and parcelled manor estates and founded new settlements in Adlig Rose, B√§renwalde (Bi≈Ñcze), Barkenfelde (Barkowo), Eckartsberge (Kolno), Falkenwalde (Sokole), Marienthal, Paradies (Parady≈º), Philipshof, Sampohl (SƒÖpolno), Schlichtingsheim (Szlichtyngowa), and Schmirtenau (≈ömiardowo). Later in 1930 Kaller was consecrated in Schneidem√ºhl's Holy Family Concathedral bishop of his new Diocese of Ermland (Warmia), then moving to its diocesan seat in Frauenburg in East Prussia (Frombork). In 1930 the new prelature comprised 74 parishes with 123 priests dispersed in four separate exclaves, on the German side of the border to the Polish Voivodeships of Pozna≈Ñ and of Pomerania. Visiting the parishes in the different exclaves was a tiresome effort. In 1933 the prelature comprised 9,601 km¬≤ with 135,310 Catholic parishioners among 427,522 inhabitants. It was divided into eight deaneries seated in Betsche (Pszczew), Bomst (Babimost), Deutsch Krone (Wa≈Çcz), Flatow (Z≈Çot√≥w), Fraustadt (Wschowa), Lauenburg in Pomerania (Lƒôbork), Schlochau (Cz≈Çuch√≥w) and Schneidem√ºhl. Neighbouring dioceses were Culm in the northeast, Pozna≈Ñ in the east and south, Breslau in the south and Berlin in the west and north. While the Apostolic Administration did not dispose of an efficace administration, the Prelature had a consistory consisting of five persons, with a vicar general (Msgr. Johannes Bleske) and an official (Erich Klitsche) since 1930. On 25 February 1931 Franz Hartz succeeded Kaller as prelate. During the Great Depression Polzin organised \\"Katholischer Freiwilliger Arbeitsdienst\\" (Catholic Volunteer Service), an employment-creation measure financed by the prelature. Soon after the Nazi takeover the volunteer service was confiscated by the Reichsarbeitsdienst, the colonisation service was gradually usurped by the Nazi party and Polzin temporarily taken into Gestapo arrest in 1935, while the Nazis fought the Catholic youth organisations. Grave slab of Prelate Franz Hartz in St. Cyriacus Church in H√ºls, Krefeld. In early 1945 Prelate Hartz fled ‚Äì like many other parishioners too ‚Äì the invading Soviet Red Army and stranded in Fulda by the end of World War II. In March 1945 Poland annexed the area and the new Polish authorities expelled most of the remaining and surviving German population to Allied-occupied Germany in the years between 1945 and 1948. Polzin, who served as priest in Rokitten (Rokitno) since 1936, was expelled on 22 June 1945. Stranded in Berlin he organised the \\"Katholischer Fl√ºchtlingsdienst\\" (Catholic Refugee Service), taking care of the destitute refugees and expellees. Cardinal August Hlond, arrogating his special papal plenipotentiary power to reorganise the Polish episcopate, also appointed apostolic administrators for the German dioceses now under Polish rule. Although Hartz had not resigned, Hlond appointed on 15 August 1945 Edmund Nowicki (1900‚Äì1971) with effect of 1 September as administrator for the Prelature and the Diocese of Berlin east of the Oder. Nowicki was titled Administrator of Cammin, Lebus and the Prelature Schneidem√ºhl (), seated in Gorz√≥w Wielkopolski (Landsberg upon Warthe). The anti-clerical Polish government under Boles≈Çaw Bierut deposed and banished Nowicki from the administration in 1951. Thus Vicar Tadeusz Za≈Çuczkowski replaced him, followed by Vicar Zygmunt SzelƒÖ≈ºek in 1952. Prelate Hartz died in 1953 in H√ºls, a locality of Krefeld. In the same year the Schneidem√ºhl Consistory, whose members then lived in the Federal Republic of Germany, then ‚Äì following canon law ‚Äì elected Polzin capitular vicar for the vacant see, confirmed by the Holy See on 20 October 1953. In 1956 Teodor Bensch (1903‚Äì1958) was appointed administrator of Cammin, Lebus and the Prelature Schneidem√ºhl, succeeded by Jozef Michalski (only 1958), and again by Administrator Wilhelm Pluta (1910‚Äì1986), Bishop of the titulature of Leptis Magna, serving as administrator until 1972. After Polzin's death the Schneidem√ºhl Consistory had elected Wilhelm Volkmann capitular vicar in 1964, holding that position until 1972.Sabine Vo√ükamp, Katholische Kirche und Vertriebene in Westdeutschland: Integration, Identit√§t und ostpolitischer Diskurs 1945-1972, Stuttgart: Kohlhammer Verlag, 2007, (=Konfession und Gesellschaft; vol. 40), p. 395. . With the reorganisation of the formerly Eastern German dioceses in the Polish- annexed areas in 1972 the Prelature of Schneidem√ºhl (Pra≈Çatura Pilska) was dissolved and its diocesan area divided between the Dioceses of Gorz√≥w (since 1992 Zielona G√≥ra-Gorz√≥w) and of Koszalin-Kolobrzeg. The Holy See established the office of a Visitator Apostolic for the diocesans of the Prelature of Schneidem√ºhl exiled in today's Germany. Paul Snowadzki was appointed first visitator in 1972 (till 1982), succeeded by Wolfgang Klemp in the years 1982 to 1997.
