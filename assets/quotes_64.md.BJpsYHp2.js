Griese led the Dolphins to three consecutive Super Bowl appearances, including two Super Bowl victories in VII and VIII (a feat since matched by Jim Kelly and the Buffalo Bills with four consecutive super bowls, and Tom Brady and the New England Patriots in Super Bowls LI, LII, and LIII). Griese was inducted into the College Football Hall of Fame and the Indiana Football Hall of Fame in 1984 and the Pro Football Hall of Fame in 1990. He later worked as a television commentator, calling NFL games for NBC Sports and college football for ESPN and ABC Sports. Griese is one of three quarterbacks from Purdue to win the Super Bowl (along with Len Dawson and Drew Brees). Early life Griese was born in Evansville, Indiana to Ida (Ulrich) and Sylverious \\"Slick\\" Griese. Slick owned a plumbing company in Evansville and died in 1955 when Bob was ten years old. Bob played baseball primarily, and excelled as a pitcher. He also starred in basketball and football at Evansville's Rex Mundi High School. He earned 12 varsity letters for the Monarchs. =Baseball= In the summer of 1963, Griese led his American Legion baseball team, Funkhouser Post #8 of Evansville, Indiana, to the American League Baseball World Series as the Region 5 champion. His team did not reach the finals, as the Arthur L. Peterson Post of Long Beach, California, won the title. =Basketball= He led the basketball team to the No. 1 ranking in Indiana during the 1962‚Äì63 season and a record of 19‚Äì3. He scored 900 points in his high school career and while being named All-Sectional, he could not lead the Monarchs past Evansville Bosse in the highly competitive Evansville IHSAA Sectional. =Football= The Monarchs were 15‚Äì5 during his Junior (9‚Äì1) and Senior (6‚Äì4) seasons, as he was named 1st Team All-City for three seasons. After being recruited by several colleges for football, Bob chose Purdue, where he majored in business management and became a three-sport star.(cited from Undefeated, by Bob Griese, copyright 2000) College career Griese from 1967 Purdue yearbook While at Purdue, Bob became a member of Sigma Chi fraternity. Griese pitched for the Purdue baseball team, going 12-1 one season, played guard on the Purdue basketball team, and played quarterback, kicker, and punter for the Purdue football team. There are at least four football games in which Griese was in some way responsible for all of Purdue's points. As of the beginning of the 2016 NCAA football season, Griese ranks #10 in all-time scoring at Purdue; #5 in scoring among non-kickers and #4 among kickers. Griese's passing skills greatly improved under the tutelage of head coach Jack Mollenkopf and quarterback coach Bob DeMoss. In his junior year at game against the top-ranked Notre Dame, Griese completed 19 of 22 passes as he led the Boilermakers to an upset win. Griese was a two-time All-American at Purdue, finishing at #8 in the 1965 Heisman Trophy race and was the runner-up to Steve Spurrier for the 1966 Heisman Trophy. Purdue finished second in the Big Ten in 1966, and he led the school's first appearance in the Rose Bowl, where they defeated USC 14-13. He was inducted into the Rose Bowl Hall of Fame in 1992. He was also awarded the Big Ten Medal of Honor for excellence in athletics and academics. Griese's achievements during his college career earned him induction into the College Football Hall of Fame in 1984. Purdue does not have a practice of retiring jersey numbers, but he was inducted as an inaugural member of the Purdue Intercollegiate Athletic Hall of Fame in 1994. On December 11, 2014, the Big Ten Network included Griese on \\"The Mount Rushmore of Purdue Football\\", as chosen by online fan voting. Griese was joined in the honor by Drew Brees, Rod Woodson and Leroy Keyes. Professional football career =1967‚Äì1969= Griese was selected by the AFL's Miami Dolphins as the fourth player in the 1967 Common Draft. Griese threw for 2,005 yards and 15 touchdowns his rookie year. Griese was an AFL All-Star his first two years with the Dolphins, and earned AFL All-Star or AFC-NFC Pro Bowl honors in six additional seasons. While he never put up huge numbers, his leadership played an important role in helping the Dolphins compete in three consecutive Super Bowls, winning the latter two contests. Griese started the season as the team's second-string quarterback behind John Stofa. When Stofa broke his ankle in the first quarter of the first game of the 1967 season, Griese stepped in and led the Dolphins to a 35-21 victory against the Denver Broncos. The 1967, 1968, and 1969 seasons were tough for the expansion Dolphins. After a difficult 1969 season that was worse than the 1968 season, coach George Wilson was fired. =1970‚Äì1976= Dolphin owner Joe Robbie brought in Don Shula from the Baltimore Colts in 1970, and the team's personality and fortunes turned quickly. The Dolphins found a new discipline, and learned what it took to become a winning team. They went from a 3-10-1 record in 1969 to 10-4 in 1970, making the playoffs. In 1971 the Dolphins made it to the Super Bowl, losing to 24-3 to the Dallas Cowboys. Griese was named the 1971 Newspaper Enterprise Association NFL Most Valuable Player award, and was awarded the Jim Thorpe Trophy. The 1972 season began with the Dolphins winning their first four games. In the fifth game of the season, Bob Griese was tackled hard by Deacon Jones and Ron East of the San Diego Chargers, and went down with a broken leg and dislocated ankle. Earl Morrall, fresh off the waiver wire from Shula's former team, the Baltimore Colts, guided the Dolphins through the rest of the regular season, and maintained an unbeaten record in the process. Morrall also led the NFL in five passing categories during this time, including passer rating. As the playoffs began, the Dolphins were not as strong as they needed to be to go deep into the postseason, barely winning against the Cleveland Browns, a team that they should have beaten easily. The second game of the playoffs the team got off to a slow start against the Pittsburgh Steelers. Shula asked Griese to relieve the ailing Morrall, simply asking Griese at halftime, ‚ÄúAre you ready?‚Äù Griese replied with, ‚ÄúYes, I‚Äôm ready.‚Äù Griese took the field and completed 3 of 5 passes for 70 yards as the Dolphins beat the Steelers by a score of 21-17 to clinch their second straight Super Bowl appearance. Griese playing for the Dolphins in Super Bowl VII. Despite their unbeaten season, the Dolphins were listed as two point underdogs to the Washington Redskins in Super Bowl VII. Staying with the system that got them there, the Dolphins offense played a perfect ball control game. Griese connected on 8 of 11 passes for 88 yards and a touchdown, and Larry Csonka rushed for over 120 yards. Washington's only score was on a returned blocked field goal, and Miami won the game 14-7. In 1973 Griese led another strong Dolphins team, but they did not make it through the season undefeated. They reached the Super Bowl for the third consecutive season and defeated the Minnesota Vikings 24-7. In 1974, Griese and the Dolphins had an 11-3 regular season record, but lost to the Oakland Raiders in the divisional round of the playoffs. In 1975, Griese and the Dolphins started strong, but late in the season in a game against the Baltimore Colts, Griese suffered a broken toe and was out for the rest of the season. The Dolphins finished a respectable 10-4, but missed out on the playoffs for the first time in the Shula era. In 1976, the Dolphins had many injuries, and the team finished the season at 6-8, the first time Don Shula ever suffered a losing season in his career. =1977‚Äì1980= 1977 was a rebound year for both Griese and the Dolphins; he began to wear eyeglasses on the field.Scoop! Bob Griese wears glasses On Thanksgiving, 1977, Griese threw six touchdown passes in three quarters to defeat the St. Louis Cardinals 55-14.Griese, Dolphins feast on Cardinals, 55-14 Bob again led the AFC in touchdown passes thrown but the Dolphins rebound to a 10-4 record was again not enough to get the team into the playoffs. The following year, Bob tore ligaments in his knee in a preseason game. However, when he came back, he was just as strong a passer as he had been the previous year. In one game against the Houston Oilers (nationally telecast as a marquee matchup on ABC's Monday Night Football), Griese dueled with Oiler running back Earl Campbell in an offensive slugfest. Griese threw for over 300 yards and Campbell rushed for nearly 200. The Oilers won the game 35-30. For the year, Griese completed a league-leading 63% of his passes, as the Dolphins went 11-5, losing again to the Oilers in the playoffs. In 1979, Bob suffered from some nagging leg injuries that affected his throwing. He was not as effective, and he began to hear some criticism. However, he was able to lead the Dolphins to a 10-6 record. The Dolphins then found themselves dominated by the Pittsburgh Steelers in the Divisional round of the playoffs. In 1980, Griese had found that he had lost his starting spot in the roster to either Don Strock or rookie David Woodley. However, Griese came off the bench for several games in a row to lead comeback wins. Griese won back the starting spot in the fifth game of the season, but was tackled hard by Mike Ozdowski of the Baltimore Colts. The tackle tore up Bob's shoulder, and he was out for the rest of the year. The injury eventually led to Griese's decision to retire from the game at the age of 35. Bob was eventually elected to the Pro Football Hall of Fame in 1990. He had established his reputation as the ‚ÄúThinking Man‚Äôs Quarterback,‚Äù as he brilliantly called his own plays throughout his career. Dolphin owner Joe Robbie called him ‚Äúthe cornerstone of the franchise,‚Äù around whom the Miami Dolphins were built. Robbie elected to ask Griese to stay on for another year as assistant coach, which he did for the 1981 season, helping Strock and the young Woodley as they teamed to become the famous ‚ÄúWoodstrock.‚Äù Bob decided that he did not like the hours required to be an assistant coach, hoping to devote more time to his family, yet still enjoyed being part of the game. (Sources for Pro Football Career found in Undefeated, by Bob Griese, 2000, and The Winning Edge by Don Shula, 1974.) The Miami Dolphins had the highest winning percentage in all professional sports in the 1970s, and Bob Griese was its starting quarterback throughout the decade, except when he was injured for several games in 1972, 1975, and 1978. In Griese's 14 pro seasons, he threw for 25,092 yards and 192 touchdowns. Griese also rushed for 994 yards and seven scores. Griese was a six-time Dolphins' MVP and was All-Pro in 1971 and 1977. He played in two AFL All-Star games and six Pro Bowls. The Dolphins retired his number 12 during a Monday Night Football game in 1985, telecast on ABC, the network which would prominently be featured in his post-football career. Life after football =NBC Sports= Nat Moore, guest and Griese at the 2014 Miami International Film Festival To stay in touch with the game, in 1982 Griese decided to take a job as an announcer for NBC Sports, teaming with Charlie Jones for NFL games. While there, he called Super Bowl XX. =ABC Sports= In 1987, Griese was hired by ABC Sports, where he began to provide color commentary for college football games. While at ABC, Griese called the 1999, 2001 and 2005 BCS National Championship games. At ABC Griese had many opportunities to watch his son Brian Griese play for the Michigan Wolverines. ABC was at first reluctant to let Griese broadcast Michigan games, fearing a conflict of interest. But when they decided to give it a try, Bob remained as impartial and professional as he could be, even referring to his son as ‚ÄúGriese,‚Äù rather than Brian, and pointing out errors when he felt necessary. On January 1, 1998, Bob got to broadcast the Rose Bowl game, the last college game of his son's career. Brian was named MVP of the game, leading his Wolverines to an undefeated season and the national championship title with their Rose Bowl victory. Bob and Brian were emotional at that moment, as they thought of Bob's wife Judi, who had died from breast cancer in 1988 but whom they both felt was there at that special moment. Bob and Brian later wrote a book, entitled Undefeated (), which discussed not only their football connection, but also their love for Judi. Brian became a professional quarterback and broadcaster himself, playing for the Denver Broncos and Tampa Bay Buccaneers, and later commentating games for ESPN and ABC. =ESPN= During the 2009 and 2010 seasons, Griese served as the lead commentator for ESPN's noon college football broadcasts. He retired from ESPN on February 3, 2011. =Miami Dolphins Broadcasts= Miami Dolphins Preseason Bob Griese has been an analyst of Miami Dolphins preseason TV broadcasts since 2002. Miami Dolphins Radio Network In 2011 Bob Griese joined the Dolphins Radio Broadcast team as a color commentator, replacing former teammate Jim Mandich. Personal life Griese married Purdue classmate Judi Lassus in June 1967, following their graduation, and they had three sons. A nurse, she lost a six-year battle with breast cancer at age 44 in early 1988. He now resides with his second wife, Shay, in Jupiter, Florida, and Banner Elk, North Carolina. His youngest son is Brian Griese (b. 1975), who also played quarterback in the NFL. In 2006, Griese made an appearance on the game show, Wheel of Fortune. Griese won and sent the winnings to Judi's House.

She was the daughter of Colonel Thomas Chudleigh (died 1726), and was appointed maid of honour to Augusta, Princess of Wales, in 1743, probably through the good offices of her friend, William Pulteney, 1st Earl of Bath. She was found guilty of bigamy at a trial by her peers at Westminster Hall that attracted 4,000 spectators. Marriage Elizabeth Chudleigh was born on 8 March 1721. Her father was lieutenant governor of the Royal Hospital, Chelsea; he died while she was a small child. Chudleigh did not lack admirers, among them James Hamilton, 6th Duke of Hamilton, and Augustus Hervey, later 3rd Earl of Bristol, but, at that time, a younger grandson of the first Earl. On 4 August 1744, she was privately married to Hervey at Lainston House, a private country house with its parish church (St Peter's, now a ruin), near Winchester. The wedding was held at night to preserve the secrecy. Both husband and wife lacked the financial support they needed, and their union was kept secret to enable Chudleigh to retain her post at court, while Hervey, a naval officer, rejoined his ship, returning to England toward the close of 1746. The marriage was unhappy, and for years, the pair did not live together. Married in secret, their marriage did not seem to need to be dissolved. Chudleigh \\"cut a prominent figure\\" in British society, and in 1765 in Berlin, she was mistress to Frederick the Great. Then, she became the mistress of Evelyn Pierrepont, 2nd Duke of Kingston-upon-Hull, and married him in 1769. However, before Hervey could succeed his brother as Earl of Bristol, Chudleigh established proof of their marriage by forging an entry in the parish register at Lainston, unbeknownst to him.Heppenstal quotes a detailed account of this incident from Melville, L, Notable Brit Trials, vol. 182: The Trial of the Duchess of Kingston (Edinburgh: William Hodge & Co., 1927)  Charges of bigamy  Hervey wanted to end their marriage by divorce, but Chudleigh wanted to avoid any public acknowledgment of their marriage. She initiated a suit of jactitation against him, requiring him to cease claiming marriage to her unless proved. After Hervey proved incapable of proving the relationship and Chudleigh swore she was unmarried, the consistory court in February 1769 pronounced her a spinster, free to marry. Within a month, she married Kingston and became Elizabeth Pierrepont, Duchess of Kingston-upon- Hull. He built for her a grand townhouse called Chudleigh House (later called Kingston House) on Knightsbridge in the City of Westminster, London. He died four years later, leaving her all his property on condition she remain a widow. She travelled abroad. Visiting Rome, she was received with the honor due a duchess by Pope Clement XIV. In 1775, her first husband's brother died, and Hervey became Earl of Bristol. Chudleigh's marriage to Hervey was legitimate, despite her denials, and she was therefore, legally, Countess of Bristol. The Duchess / Countess was forced to return to England after her late husband's nephew, Evelyn Medows (died 1826), brought a charge of bigamy against her in hopes of establishing a legal rationale for challenging Kingston's will. She attempted unsuccessfully to have the charge set aside in December 1775 by reason of the previous judgment in her favour. She was tried as a peer in Westminster Hall in 1776, and found guilty by 116 peers without dissent. Absconding with her fortune, she hurriedly left England to avoid further proceedings on the part of the Medows family. Later life and legacy  Elizabeth Chudleigh at a 1749 masked ball She lived for a time in Calais, and became mistress to Stefano Zannowich. 1777, after her acceptance by Russian royalty, the two had a boat built then made a spectacular entrance sailing into Kronstadt, the port of Saint Petersburg. In the Governorate of Estonia, she bought 3 properties: Toila, Orro, and Fockenhoff, consolidating them into an estate she named \\"Chudleigh\\". She planned to create a 'model Brit estate', imported spaniels and pointers and a collection of plants. She lived there in a clifftop house with a view of the Baltic Sea. In 1777, Hervey gained legal recognition that his marriage to Chudleigh was legitimate, but he did not pursue divorce proceedings, probably because of his involvement with the suit of jactitation. Chudleigh continued to parade as Duchess of Kingston, residing in her Paris estate in Montmartre, Rome, and elsewhere, and died at her estate at St. Assise near Paris on 26 August 1788, still, legally, Countess of Bristol. The Duchess / Countess was said to be coarse and licentious, and was ridiculed as the character Kitty Crocodile by the comedian Samuel Foote in a play A Trip to Calais, which, however, he was not allowed to produce. She is rumored to be the idea behind the character of William Makepeace Thackeray's character Beatrix Esmond, Baroness Bernstein in The History of Henry Esmond and The Virginians. In popular culture Chudleigh appears as a character in T. H. White's non-fiction The Age of ScandalT. H. White, The Age of Scandal, Faber & Faber, 2011, and in Theodore Sturgeon's historical romance I, Libertine, which began as a hoax.Frederick R. Ewing (pseud. of Theodore Sturgeon), I, Libertine, Ballantine Books, 1956. She appears as a non-speaking character in the play Mr Foote's Other Leg, in which the controversy surrounding her and Foote is portrayed as central to the latter's fall.

Biography  Her first works of poetry were the chapbooks An Exquisite Navel, A Passing Dragon, and A Passing Dragon Seen Again, published in 1959. Several of her poems also appeared in Beat and Beatific II in 1959. Although Kandel was born in New York, her family lived in Bucks County, Pennsylvania during her childhood. Afterward, she moved to Los Angeles to live with her father, screenwriter Aben Kandel. She returned to New York to attend The New School for Social Research on scholarship for three and a half years before she dropped out. She moved to San Francisco in 1960. She began living in the East-West House co-op where she met Jack Kerouac, who later immortalized her as Romana Swartz, \\"a big Rumanian monster beauty,\\" in his novel Big Sur (1962). In the novel, she is described as being the girlfriend of Dave Wain, who was based on Lew Welch. \\"Dave\\" describes how she walked around the \\"Zen-East House\\" (East-West House) wearing only purple panties. Kerouac described her as \\"intelligent, well read, writes poetry, is a Zen student, knows everything [...]\\" (Big Sur, p. 75). Kandel was briefly notorious as the author of a short book of poetry, The Love Book. A small pamphlet consisting of four poems, The Love Book provoked censorship with its three-part poem, \\"To Fuck with Love.\\" Police seized the work as being in violation of state obscenity codes, from both City Lights Books and The Psychedelic Shop in 1966. Subsequently Kandel gained cause c√©l√®bre status. She herself defended her verse as \\"holy erotica.\\" A jury declared the book obscene and lacking in any redeeming social value in 1967 and sales increased; Kandel thanked the police by giving one percent of all profits to the Police Retirement Association. The decision was overturned on appeal and the book continued to sell well. In 1964, she was asked to read at the University of California Poetry Conference organized by Charles Olson. Along with Allen Ginsberg, Timothy Leary, Michael McClure and others, Kandel was a speaker at the Human Be-In in the Golden Gate Park polo fields on January 14, 1967. The only woman to speak from the stage, Kandel defiantly read from The Love Book. It was her 35th birthday, and McClure later stated, \\"The entire crowd of 20,000 or 30,000 people sang 'Happy Birthday' to her.\\" Kandel published her only full-length book of poems, Word Alchemy, in 1967. She was one of 15 people interviewed in Voices from the Love Generation (Little, Brown and Company, 1968). In 1976, Kandel recited a poem at the iconic concert The Last Waltz performed by The Band (but was not included in the film or soundtrack). In 1970, Kandel suffered massive spinal injuries in a motorcycle crash with her then-husband Billy \\"Sweet Wiliam\\" Fritsch (poet and member of the Hells Angels). Despite having to cope with excruciating pain for the remainder of her life, she continued to write and maintain social ties. She died at home on October 18, 2009, of complications from lung cancer, with which she had been diagnosed several weeks earlier. In 2012 Collected Poems of Lenore Kandel was published. It features 80 of her poems, many of which had never before been published.https://www.amazon.com/Collected-Poems-Lenore- Kandel/dp/1583943722/ref=sr_1_1?s=books&ie;=UTF8&qid;=1334070952&sr;=1-1  Film and music  Kandel appears in the Digger film Nowsreal (1968), sewing a Hells Angel patch on William Fritsch's jacket. Kandel appears in the Kenneth Anger film Invocation of My Demon Brother (1969), with William Fritsch, smoking a marijuana cigarette contained in a miniature skull.

His poem on Mary, Queen of Scots was published about 1831, and was followed by a collection of poems entitled Tales of the Dead. He also wrote a drama, Richard III, and a fragmentary poem entitled London. None of these ventures achieved any success, but his numerous historical works are written with vivacity and interest, and, in their own style, are an important contribution to the history of England. They include: *Memoirs of the Court of England during the Reign of the Stuarts (1840) *Memoirs of the Court of England from the Revolution of 1688 to the Death of George II (1843) *George Selwyn and his Contemporaries (1843, new ed. 1882) *Memoirs of the Pretenders and their Adherents (1845) *Memoirs of Richard the Third and his Contemporaries (1861) *Memoirs of the Life and Reign of King George the Third (1867) The titles of these works are sufficiently indicative of their character. They are sketches of the principal personages and of the social details of various periods in the history of England rather than complete and comprehensive historical narratives. In addition to these works Jesse wrote Literary and Historical Memorials of London (1847), London and its Celebrities (1850), and a new edition of this work as London: its Celebrated Characters and Remarkable Places (1871). His Memoirs of Celebrated Etonians appeared in 1875.

Biography Rheingold was born on July 7, 1947, in Phoenix, Arizona. He graduated from Reed College in Portland, Oregon, in 1968. His senior thesis was entitled What Life Can Compare with This? Sitting Alone at the Window, I Watch the Flowers Bloom, the Leaves Fall, the Seasons Come and Go. A lifelong fascination with mind augmentation and its methods led Rheingold to the Institute of Noetic Sciences and Xerox PARC. There he worked on and wrote about the earliest personal computers. This led to his writing Tools for Thought in 1985, a history of the people behind the personal computer. Around that time he first logged on to The WELL ‚Äì an influential early online community. He explored the experience in his seminal book, The Virtual Community. Also in 1985, Rheingold coauthored Out of the Inner Circle: A Hacker's Guide to Computer Security with former hacker Bill Landreth. In 1991, he published Virtual Reality: Exploring the Brave New Technologies of Artificial Experience and Interactive Worlds from Cyberspace to Teledildonics. After a stint editing the Whole Earth Review, Rheingold served as editor in chief of the Millennium Whole Earth Catalog. Shortly thereafter, he was hired on as founding executive editor of HotWired, one of the first commercial content web sites published in 1994 by Wired magazine. Rheingold left HotWired and soon founded Electric Minds in 1996 to chronicle and promote the growth of community online. Despite accolades, the site was sold and scaled back in 1997. In 1998, he created his next virtual community, Brainstorms, a private successful webconferencing community for knowledgeable, intellectual, civil, and future-thinking adults from all over the world. Rheingold in Mill Valley In 2002, Rheingold published Smart Mobs, exploring the potential for technology to augment collective intelligence. Shortly thereafter, in conjunction with the Institute for the Future, Rheingold launched an effort to develop a broad-based literacy of cooperation. In 2008, Rheingold became the first research fellow at the Institute for the Future, with which he had long been affiliated. Rheingold is a visiting lecturer in Stanford University's Department of Communication where he has taught courses such as \\"Digital Journalism\\", \\"Virtual Communities and Social Media\\", and \\"Social Media Literacies\\". He is a former lecturer in UC Berkeley's School of Information where he taught \\"Virtual Communities and Social Media\\" and \\"Participatory Media/Collective Action\\". He has been a frequent contributor to the Connected Learning Alliance blog on topics ranging from new media literacy to learning innovation. Rheingold lives in Mill Valley, California, with his wife Judy and daughter Mamie. In an entry on his video blog, he provides a tour of the converted garage that became a \\"dream office\\" and an \\"externalization of [his] mind\\" where Rheingold absorbs information, writes, and creates art. He contributed the essay \\"Participative Pedagogy for a Literacy of Literacies\\" to the Freesouls book project.

In 1812 he was appointed commissioner of hackney coaches, and later he became deputy surveyor-general of the royal parks and palaces. On the abolition of this office he retired on a pension, and he died at Brighton.

The word \\"latitat\\" is Latin for \\"he lurks\\".\\"[I]t derives its name from a supposition that the defendant lurks and lies hid, and cannot be found in the county of Middlesex (in which the said court is holden) to be taken there, but is gone into some other county, and therefore requiring the sheriff to apprehend him in such other county.\\" Fitz. N. B. 78. In England, the writ is essentially a summons out of the civil, and in those days common law only court King's Bench. It is now defunct but examples still exist from 1579 and 1791. One example from the 16th Century was a writ presented to the Star Chamber, a powerful court operating outside the normal system of law. In that example, the Court of King's Bench had issued a writ of latitat directing the King's Sheriff to arrest the named person and present him before the court at a specified time and place. The matter had come before the Star Chamber because the arrest had been resisted and the Under-Sheriff (a Crown official) assaulted and a writ of subpoena was now requested. The writ may have arisen in 1566 because at that time there was a \\"Bill for Latitat for Vexation out of the King's Bench\\" before Parliament and there was another in 1802. The current practice would be for the issue of a subpoena. If the person concerned failed to appear, the High Court of England and Wales has the power to issue a Bench Warrant, i.e. a warrant for the arrest of the person concerned, who may then be subject to arrest under that aegis of the Tipstaff and presentation before the court for contempt of court.

Geography Arques is situated in the middle of the Hauts-de-France region, 40 km from Calais and Dunkerque, and 45 km from Boulogne-sur-Mer. It lies on the border of the departments of Pas-de-Calais and Nord. The town is crossed by the Neufoss√© Canal, which connects the rivers Aa and Lys. The commune also includes several lakes--Beaus√©jour, Arc-en-ciel, Malh√¥ve, Batavia--and part of the forest of Rihout-Clairmarais. History Arques is in the region of French Flanders. As this area has been under Belgian, English, French and Spanish rule, many of the names are French versions of names in other languages. In the wake of the Battle of the Golden Spurs a battle was fought here in April 1303 between French and Flemish. The Flemish were victorious in the Battle of Arques (1303). Arques is not to be confused with Arques-la-Bataille, where the Battle of Arques (1589) took place. It is also close to Agincourt. It was one of the first towns in the region which subscribed to Agenda 21. Population Economy Arques is famous for its crystal manufacture. It has been the headquarters of Arc International, the largest manufacturer of glassware in the world, since its inception in the 19th century.

It is traditionally a Lutheran practice, although it has spread to many other Christian denominations. It is usually a horizontal evergreen wreath with four candles, sometimes with a fifth, white candle in the center. Beginning with the First Sunday of Advent, the lighting of a candle can be accompanied by a Bible reading, devotional time and prayers. An additional candle is lit during each subsequent week until, by the last Sunday before Christmas, all four candles are lit. Many Advent wreaths include a fifth, Christ candle which is lit at Christmas Eve or Christmas Day. The custom originated in family settings but has also become widespread in public worship. History The concept of the Advent wreath originated among German Lutherans in the 16th century. However, it was not until three centuries later that the modern Advent wreath took shape. Advent wreath as designed by Wichern Research by Prof. Haemig of Luther Seminary, St. Paul, points to Johann Hinrich Wichern (1808‚Äì1881), a Protestant pastor in Germany and a pioneer in urban mission work among the poor, as the inventor of the modern Advent wreath in the 19th century. During Advent, children at the mission school Rauhes Haus, founded by Wichern in Hamburg, would ask daily if Christmas had arrived. In 1839, he built a large wooden ring (made out of an old cartwheel) with 20 small red and 4 large white candles. A small candle was lit successively every weekday and Saturday during Advent. On Sundays, a large white candle was lit. The custom gained ground among Protestant churches in Germany and evolved into the smaller wreath with four or five candles known today. Roman Catholics in Germany began to adopt the custom in the 1920s, and in the 1930s it spread to North America. Professor Haemig's research also indicates that the custom did not reach the United States until the 1930s, even among German Lutheran immigrants. In medieval times Advent was a period of fasting during which people's thoughts were directed to the expected second coming of Christ; but in modern times many have forgotten this meaning and it has instead been primarily seen as the lead up to Christmas, and in that context the Advent wreath serves as a reminder of the approach of the feast. In 1964, an Advent crown, made at home from wire coathangers and tinsel, appeared on the bi- weekly children's TV program Blue Peter. This 'make' became one of the program's most iconic, repeated each year, and was the introduction of this tradition to most of the broadly Anglican audience. In later years, the candles were replaced by baubles, out of concern over fire. More recently, some Eastern Orthodox families have adopted an Advent wreath with six candles, symbolizing the longer Christmas fast in Orthodox tradition, which corresponds to Advent in Western Christianity. Forms of the Advent wreath Advent wreaths are circular, representing God's infinite love, and are usually made of evergreen leaves, which \\"represent the hope of eternal life brought by Jesus Christ\\". Within the Advent wreath are candles that generally represent the four weeks of the Advent season as well as \\"the light of God coming into the world through the birth of Jesus Christ\\" although each of the candles can be attributed its own significance as well; in one version of such interpretation, the candles specifically symbolize the Christian concepts of hope (week one), peace (week two), joy (week three) and love (week four). Many Advent wreaths also have a white candle in the centre to symbolize the arrival of Christmastide, sometimes known as the \\"Christ candle.\\" It is lit on Christmas Eve or Christmas Day. The Christ candle is coloured white because this is the traditional festal colour in the Western Church. Another interpretation states that the first candle is the Messiah or Prophecy candle (representing the prophets who predicted the coming of Jesus), the second is the Bethlehem candle (representing the journey of Joseph and Mary), the third represents the shepherds and their joy, and the fourth is the Angel's candle, representing peace. In many Catholic and Protestant churches, the most popular colours for the four surrounding Advent candles are violet and rose, corresponding with the colors of the liturgical vestments for the Sundays of Advent. For denominations of the Western Christian Church, violet is the historic liturgical color for three of the four Sundays of Advent: Violet is the traditional color of penitential seasons. Blue is also a popular alternative color for both Advent vestments and Advent candles, especially in some Anglican and American Methodist churches, which use a blue shade associated with the Sarum rite, in addition to Lutheran churches that also implement this practice. One interpretation holds that blue means hope and waiting, which aligns with the seasonal meaning of Advent. Rose is the liturgical color for the Third Sunday of Advent, known as Gaudete Sunday from the Latin word meaning \\"rejoice ye\\", the first word of the traditional entrance prayer (called the introit) for the Mass or Worship Service of the third Sunday of Advent; it is a pause in the penitential spirit of Advent. As such, the third candle, representing joy, is often a different color from the other three. In other Protestant churches, especially in the United Kingdom, it is more common for Advent wreaths to have four red candles (reflecting their traditional use in Christmas decorations).BBC News, \\"Christian celebration of Advent\\" (BBC Mobile, 16 November 2010, accessed December 19, 2010). An Advent wreath given to Pope Benedict XVI of the Catholic Church also had four red candles. In the UK, the four red advent candles are often linked to the Sunday Revised Common Lectionary readings for Advent, each candle representing those looking forward to the coming of Christ: the hope of all God's people (week one), the Old Testament prophets (week two), John the Baptist (week three) and Mary the mother of Jesus (week four). In Making God Real in the Orthodox Christian Home, Anthony Coniaris states that an Orthodox wreath consists of six different colored candles on a round base to celebrate the six weeks of the 40-day Christmas and Advent period. A green candle, symbolizing faith, is lit on the first Sunday that begins on November 15; on the second Sunday, a blue candle, symbolizing hope, is lit; on the third Sunday, a gold candle, symbolizing love; on the fourth Sunday, a white candle, symbolizing peace; on the fifth Sunday, a purple candle, symbolizing repentance; on the sixth Sunday, a red candle, symbolizing communion.

Starting in the 1950s and 1960s, the terms became popular in the United States. They referred to the large-scale migration of people of various European ancestries from racially mixed urban regions to more racially homogeneous suburban or exurban regions. The term has more recently been applied to other migrations by whites, from older, inner suburbs to rural areas, as well as from the U.S. Northeast and Midwest to the milder climate in the Southeast and Southwest. The term 'white flight' has also been used for large-scale post-colonial emigration of whites from Africa, or parts of that continent, driven by levels of violent crime and anti-colonial state policies. Migration of middle-class white populations was observed during the Civil rights movement in the 1950s and 1960s out of cities such as Cleveland, Detroit, Kansas City and Oakland, although racial segregation of public schools had ended there long before the Supreme Court of the United States' decision Brown v. Board of Education in 1954. In the 1970s, attempts to achieve effective desegregation (or \\"integration\\") by means of forced busing in some areas led to more families' moving out of former areas. More generally, some historians suggest that white flight occurred in response to population pressures, both from the large migration of blacks from the rural Southern United States to urban cities of the Northern United States and the Western United States in the Great Migration and the waves of new immigrants from around the world. However, some historians have challenged the phrase \\"white flight\\" as a misnomer whose use should be reconsidered. In her study of West Side in Chicago during the post-war era, historian Amanda Seligman argues that the phrase misleadingly suggests that whites immediately departed when blacks moved into the neighborhood, when in fact, many whites defended their space with violence, intimidation, or legal tactics. Leah Boustan, Professor of Economics at Princeton, attributes white flight both to racism and economic reasons. The business practices of redlining, mortgage discrimination, and racially restrictive covenants contributed to the overcrowding and physical deterioration of areas with large minority populations. Such conditions are considered to have contributed to the emigration of other populations. The limited facilities for banking and insurance, due to a perceived lack of profitability, and other social services, and extra fees meant to hedge against perceived profit issues, increased their cost to residents in predominantly non-white suburbs and city neighborhoods. According to the environmental geographer Laura Pulido, the historical processes of suburbanization and urban decentralization contribute to contemporary environmental racism. History In 1870, The Nation covered the large-scale migrations of white Americans; \\"The report of the Emigration Commissioners of Louisiana, for the past year, estimates the white exodus from the Southern Atlantic States, Alabama, and Mississippi, to the trans-Mississippi regions, at scores of thousands\\". By 1888, with rhetoric typical of the time, Walter Thomas Mills's The Statesman publication predicted: > \\"Social and political equality and the political supremacy of the negro > element in any southern state must lead to one of three things: A white > exodus, a war of races, or the destruction of representative institutions, > as in the District of Columbia. An 1894 biography of William Lloyd Garrison reveals the abolitionist's perception of the pre-American civil war tension and how \\"the shadows of the impending civil disruption, had brought about a white exodus\\" of Northerners to Southern states such as Georgia. In the years leading up to World War I, the newspapers in the Union of South Africa were reporting on the \\"spectre of white flight\\", in particular due to Afrikaners travelling to the Port of Durban in search of ships for Britain and Australia. Academic research In 1958, political scientist Morton Grodzins identified that \\"once the proportion of non-whites exceeds the limits of the neighborhood‚Äôs tolerance for interracial living, whites move out.\\" Grodzins termed this phenomenon the tipping point in the study of white flight. In 2004, a study of UK census figures at The London School of Economics demonstrated evidence of white flight, resulting in ethnic minorities in inner-city areas becoming increasingly isolated from the white British population. The study, which examined the white population in London, the West Midlands, West Yorkshire and Greater Manchester between 1991 and 2001, also concluded that white population losses were largest in areas with the highest ethnic minority populations. In 2018, research at Indiana University showed that between 2000 and 2010 in the US, of a sample size of 27,891 Census tracts, 3,252 experienced \\"white flight\\". The examined areas had \\"an average magnitude loss of 40 percent of the original white population.\\" Published in Social Science Research, the study found \\"relative to poorer neighborhoods, white flight becomes systematically more likely in middle-class neighborhoods at higher thresholds of black, Hispanic, and Asian population presence.\\" =Checkerboard and tipping models= In studies in the 1980s and 1990s, blacks said they were willing to live in neighborhoods with 50/50 ethnic composition. Whites were also willing to live in integrated neighborhoods, but preferred proportions of more whites. Despite this willingness to live in integrated neighborhoods, the majority still live in largely segregated neighborhoods, which have continued to form. In 1969, Nobel Prize-winning economist Thomas Schelling published \\"Models of Segregation\\", a paper in which he demonstrated through a \\"checkerboard model\\" and mathematical analysis, that even when every agent prefers to live in a mixed-race neighborhood, almost complete segregation of neighborhoods emerges as individual decisions accumulate. In his \\"tipping model\\", he showed that members of an ethnic group do not move out of a neighborhood as long as the proportion of other ethnic groups is relatively low, but if a critical level of other ethnicities is exceeded, the original residents may make rapid decisions and take action to leave. This tipping point is viewed as simply the end-result of domino effect originating when the threshold of the majority ethnicity members with the highest sensitivity to sameness is exceeded. If these people leave and are either not replaced or replaced by other ethnicities, then this in turn raises the level of mixing of neighbors, exceeding the departure threshold for additional people. Africa =South Africa= About 800,000 out of an earlier total population of 5.2 million whites have left South Africa since 1995, according to a report from 2009.\\"We‚Äôre running out of whites.\\" (Apartheid, a system of segregation of whites, blacks, and people of other races, had ended in 1994.) The country has suffered a high rate of violent crime, a primary stated reason for emigration.\\"South Africa: Tomorrow‚Äôs Zimbabwe: This history is about to be replayed in South Africa. Whites have been leaving the country for some time now, worried about crime and instability.\\" Other causes include attacks against white farmers, concern about being excluded by affirmative action programs, rolling blackouts in electrical supplies, and worries about corruption and autocratic political tendencies among new leaders. Since many of those who leave are highly educated, there are shortages of skilled personnel in the government, teaching, and other professional areas.\\"‚ÄúWe are quickly losing all our skilled workers. One option for South Africa is to employ a foreign workforce to continue growing our economy and we all know how many South Africans feel about that,‚Äù Waldorf said.\\" Some observers fear the long-term consequences, as South Africa's labor policies make it difficult to attract skilled immigrants. The migration of whites in South Africa was facilitated by the creation of immigration routes into European countries for people with European ancestry. For instance, the British government introduced the notion of patriality to ensure white people of British ancestry from Africa could settle in the UK. In the global economy, some professionals and skilled people have been attracted to work in the US and European nations. =Zimbabwe (Rhodesia)= Until 1980, the former British dependency of Rhodesia held a well-publicised image as being one of two nations in sub- Saharan Africa where a white minority of European descent and culture held political, economic, and social control over a preponderantly black African majority. Nevertheless, unlike white South Africans, a significant percentage of white Rhodesians represented recent immigrants. Initially, about three- fourths of resident whites were of British origin, with those from England and Wales predominating. After World War II there was a substantial influx of the British diaspora, including former colonials from India, Pakistan, and other British possessions in Africa. Also represented were working-class Englishmen responding to economic opportunities. In 1969 only 41% of Rhodesia's white community were natural-born citizens, or 93,600 people. The remainder were naturalised British and South African citizens or expatriates, with many holding dual citizenship. During the Rhodesian Bush War, almost the entire white male population between eighteen and fifty-eight was affected by various military commitments, and individuals spent up to five or six months of the year on combat duty away from their normal occupations in the civil service, commerce, industry, or agriculture. These long periods of service in the field led to an increased emigration of men of military age. In November 1963, state media cited the chief reasons for emigration as uncertainty about the future, economic decline due to embargo and war, and the heavy commitments of national service, which was described as \\"the overriding factor causing people to leave\\". Of the male emigrants in 1976 about half fell into the 15 to 39 age bracket. Between 1960 and 1976 160,182 whites immigrated, while 157,724 departed. This dynamic turnover rate led to depressions in the property market, a slump in the construction industry, and a decline in retail sales. The number of white Rhodesians peaked in 1975 at 278,000 and rapidly declined as the bush war intensified. In 1976 around 14,000 whites left the country, marking the first year since Rhodesia's Unilateral Declaration of Independence in 1965 that more whites had left the country than arrived,M. Tamarkin (2012) The Making of Zimbabwe: Decolonization in Regional and International Politics, Routledge, p122 with most leaving for South Africa.Olga Sicilia (2010) There Is No Such Thing As a Spirit in the Stone! Misrepresentations of Zimbabwean Stone Sculpture: An Anthropological Approach Universal-Publishers, p25 This became known as the 'chicken run', the earliest use of which was recorded the following year,Eric Partridge (2006) The New Partridge Dictionary of Slang and Unconventional English: A-I, Taylor & Francis, p389 often by Rhodesians who remained to contemptuously describe those who had left.Tony Ballinger (2015) A Walk Against The Stream: A Rhodesian National Service Officer's Story of the Bush War, Helion and Company, p335U.S. News & World Report, Volume 87, pxlvi Other phrases such as 'taking the gap' or 'gapping it' were also used.Daniel Schreier, Peter Trudgill, Edgar W. Schneider, Jeffrey P. Williams (2010) The Lesser-Known Varieties of English: An Introduction, Cambridge University Press, p271 As the outward flow increased, the phrase 'owl run' also came into use as leaving the country was deemed by many to be a wise choice.Peter J. H. Petter-Bowyer (2005) Winds of Destruction: The Autobiography of a Rhodesian Combat Pilot, 30¬∞ South Publishers, p359 Disfavour with the biracial Zimbabwe Rhodesia administration in 1979 also contributed to a mass exodus. The establishment of the new Republic of Zimbabwe in 1980 sounded the death knell for white political power and ushered in a new era of black majority rule. White emigration peaked between 1980 and 1982 at 53,000 persons, with the breakdown of law and order, an increase in crime in the rural areas, and the provocative attitude of Zimbabwean officials being cited as the main causes. Political conditions typically had a greater impact on the decision to migrate among white than black professionals. Between 1982 and 2000 Zimbabwe registered a net loss of 100,000 whites, or an average of 5,000 departures per year.Helen Marrow, The new Americans: a guide to immigration since 1965 // Mary C. Waters, Reed Ueda, Helen B. Marrow (eds.), Harvard University Press, 2007, pp. 309-317 A second wave of white emigration was sparked by President Robert Mugabe's violent land reform programme after 2000. Popular destinations included South Africa and Australia, which emigrants perceived to be geographically, culturally, or sociopolitically similar to their home country. From a strictly economic point of view, the departure figures were not as significant as the loss of the skills of those leaving. A disproportionate number of white Zimbabwean emigrants were well educated and highly skilled. Among those living in the United States, for example, 53.7% had a bachelor's degree, while only 2% had not completed secondary school. Most (52.4%) had occupied technical or supervisory positions of critical importance to the modern sector of the economy. Inasmuch as black workers did not begin making large inroads into apprenticeships and other training programs until the 1970s, few were in a position to replace their white colleagues in the 1980s. Europe =Denmark= A study of school choice in Copenhagen found that an immigrant proportion of below 35% in the local schools did not affect parental choice of schools. If the percentage of immigrant children rose above this level, native Danes are far more likely to choose other schools. Immigrants who speak Danish at home also opt out. Other immigrants, often more recent ones, stay with local schools. =Ireland= A 2007 government report stated that immigration in Dublin has caused \\"dramatic\\" white flight from elementary schools in a studied area (Dublin 15). 27% of residents were foreign-born immigrants. The report stated that Dublin was risking creating immigrant- dominated banlieues, on the outskirts of a city, similar to such areas in France. The immigrants in the area included Eastern Europeans (such as those from Poland), Asians, and Africans (mainly from Nigeria). =Norway= White flight in Norway has increased since the 1970s, with the immigration of non- Scandinavians from (in numerical order, starting with the largest): Poland, Pakistan, Iraq, Somalia, Vietnam, Iran, Turkey, Bosnia and Herzegovina, Russia, Sri Lanka, the Philippines, the former Yugoslavia, Thailand, Afghanistan, and Lithuania. By June 2009, more than 40% of Oslo schools had an immigrant majority, with some schools having a 97% immigrant share. Schools in Oslo are increasingly divided by ethnicity. For instance, in the Groruddalen (Grorud valley), four boroughs which currently has a population of around 165,000, the ethnic Norwegian population decreased by 1,500 in 2008, while the immigrant population increased by 1,600. In thirteen years, a total of 18,000 ethnic Norwegians have moved from the borough. In January 2010, a news feature from Dagsrevyen on the public Norwegian Broadcasting Corporation said, \\"Oslo has become a racially divided city. In some city districts the racial segregation starts already in kindergarten.\\" Reporters said, \\"In the last years the brown schools have become browner, and the white schools whiter,\\" a statement which caused some minor controversy. =Sweden= After World War II, immigration into Sweden occurred in three phases. The first was a direct result of the war, with refugees from concentration camps and surrounding countries in Scandinavia and Northern Europe. The second, prior to 1970, involved immigrant workers, mainly from Finland, Italy, Greece, and Yugoslavia. In the most recent phase, from the 1970s onwards, refugees immigrated from the Middle East, Africa, and Latin America, joined later by their relatives. A study which mapped patterns of segregation and congregation of incoming population groups found that, if a majority group is reluctant to accept a minority influx, they may leave the district, avoid the district, or use tactics to keep the minority out. The minority group in turn react by either dispersing or congregating, avoiding certain districts in turn. Detailed analysis of data from the 1990s onwards indicates that the concentration of immigrants in certain city districts, such as Husby in Stockholm and Roseng√•rd in Malm√∂, is in part due to an immigration influx, but primarily caused by white flight. According to researcher Emma Neuman at Linnaeus University, the white flight phenomenon commences when the fraction of non-European immigrants reaches 3-4%, but European immigration shows no such effect. High income earners and the highly educated move out first, so the ethnic segregation also leads to class segregation. In a study performed at √ñrebro University, mothers of young children were interviewed to study attitudes on Swedishness, multiculturalism and segregation. It concluded that while many expressed values such as ethnic diversity being an enriching factor, when, in practice, it came to choosing schools or choosing which district to move to, ensuring the children had access to a school with a robust Swedish majority was also a consideration. This was because they did not want their children to grow up in a school where they were a minority, and wanted them to be in a good environment for learning the Swedish language. =United Kingdom= For centuries, London was the destination for refugees and immigrants from continental Europe. Although all the immigrants were European, neighborhoods showed ethnic succession over time, as older residents (in some cases, ethnic British) moved out and new immigrants moved in, an early case of white flight (though the majority of London's population was still ethnic British). In the 2001 census, the London boroughs of Newham and Brent were found to be the first areas to have non-white majorities. The 2011 census found that, for the first time, less than 50% of London's population were white British, and that in some areas of London white British people make up less than 20% of the population. A 2005 report stated that white migration within the UK is mainly from areas of high ethnic minority population to those with predominantly white populations. White British families have moved out of London as many immigrants have settled in the capital. The report's writers expressed concern about British social cohesion and stated that different ethnic groups were living \\"parallel lives\\"; they were concerned that lack of contact between the groups could result in fear more readily exploited by extremists. The London School of Economics in a study found similar results. Researcher Ludi Simpson says that the growth of ethnic minorities in Britain is due mostly to natural population growth (births outnumber deaths) rather than immigration. Both white and non-white Britons who can do so economically are equally likely to leave mixed-race inner-city areas. In his opinion, these trends indicate counter urbanisation rather than white flight. North America =Canada= Toronto In 2013, the Toronto Star examined the \\"identity crisis\\" of Brampton (a suburban city in the Greater Toronto Area), and referring to white Canadians, the \\"loss of more than 23,000 people, or 12 per cent, in a decade when the city‚Äôs population rose by 60 per cent\\". The paper reported University of Manitoba sociologist Jason Edgerton's analysis that \\"After you control for retirement, low birth rate, etc. some of the other (shrinkage) could be white flight ‚Äî former mainstream communities not comfortable being the minority.\\" A 2016 article from The Globe and Mail, addressing the diversity of Brampton, acknowledged that while academics in Canada are sometimes reluctant to use the term of white flight, it reported that: > [...] the Brampton story reveals that we have our own version of white > flight, and before we figure out how to manage hyper-diverse and > increasingly polarized cities like Greater Toronto, we need to reflect on > our own attitudes about race and ethnic diversity. In 2018, The Guardian covered the white flight that had occurred in Brampton, and how the suburban city had been nicknamed \\"Bramladesh\\" and \\"Browntown\\", due to its \\"73% visible minority, with its largest ethnic group Indian\\". It was also reported how \\"the white population fell from 192,400 in 2001 to 169,230 in 2011, and now hovers around 151,000.\\" Vancouver In 2014, the Vancouver Sun addressed the issue of white flight across Metropolitan Vancouver. Detailing the phenomenon of \\"unconscious segregation\\", the article points to large East Asian and South Asian enclaves within Greater Vancouver such as Burnaby, East Vancouver, Richmond, South Vancouver and Surrey. In contrast, other cities and neighbourhoods within the metropolitan region such as Tsawwassen, South Surrey, White Rock and Langley host equally large white enclaves. =United States= In the United States during the 1940s, for the first time, a powerful interaction between segregation laws and race differences in terms of socioeconomic status enabled white families to abandon inner cities in favor of suburban living. The result was severe urban decay that, by the 1960s, resulted in crumbling \\"ghettos\\". Prior to national data available in the 1950 US census, a migration pattern of disproportionate numbers of whites moving from cities to suburban communities was easily dismissed as merely anecdotal. Because American urban populations were still substantially growing, a relative decrease in one racial or ethnic component eluded scientific proof to the satisfaction of policy makers. In essence, data on urban population change had not been separated into what are now familiarly identified its \\"components.\\" The first data set potentially capable of proving \\"white flight\\" was the 1950 census. But original processing of this data, on older-style tabulation machines by the US Census Bureau, failed to attain any approved level of statistical proof. It was rigorous reprocessing of the same raw data on a UNIVAC I, led by Donald J. Bogue of the Scripps Foundation and Emerson Seim of the University of Chicago, that scientifically established the reality of white flight.Bogue, Donald J. and Emerson Seim (Sept-Dec 1956) Components of Population Change in Suburban and Central City Populations of Standard metropolitan Areas: 1940 to 1950 Rural Sociology. It was not simply a more powerful calculating instrument that placed the reality of white flight beyond a high hurdle of proof seemingly required for policy makers to consider taking action. Also instrumental were new statistical methods developed by Emerson Seim for disentangling deceptive counter-effects that had resulted when numerous cities reacted to departures of a wealthier tax base by annexation. In other words, central cities had been bringing back their new suburbs, such that families that had departed from inner cities were not even being counted as having moved from the cities.Bogue, Donald J. (1957) Components of Population Change, 1940‚Äì1950 published jointly by Scripps Foundation for Research in Population Problems: Miami University, and Population Research and Training Center: University of Chicago, esp. p. iv. Reprinted, in part for the value of the statistical methods, in Gibbs, Jack P. (1961) Urban Research Methods D. Van Norstrand Company: Princeton, NJ. During the later 20th century, industrial restructuring led to major losses of jobs, leaving formerly middle-class working populations suffering poverty, with some unable to move away and seek employment elsewhere. Real estate prices often fall in areas of economic erosion, allowing persons with lower income to establish homes in such areas. Since the 1960s and changed immigration laws, the United States has received immigrants from Mexico, Central and South America, Asia, and Africa. Immigration has changed the demographics of both cities and suburbs, and the US has become a largely suburban nation, with the suburbs becoming more diverse. In addition, Latinos, the fastest growing minority group in the US, began to migrate away from traditional entry cities and to cities in the Southwest, such as Phoenix and Tucson. In 2006, the increased number of Latinos had made whites a minority group in some western cities. Catalysts =Legal exclusion= In the 1930s, states outside the South (where racial segregation was legal) practiced unofficial segregation via exclusionary covenants in title deeds and real estate neighborhood redlining ‚Äì explicit, legally sanctioned racial discrimination in real property ownership and lending practices. Blacks were effectively barred from pursuing homeownership, even when they were able to afford it. Suburban expansion was reserved for middle-class and working-class white people, facilitated by their increased wages incurred by the war effort and by subsequent federally guaranteed mortgages (VA, FHA, HOLC) available only to whites to buy new houses, such as those created by the Federal Housing Administration.\\"Racial\\" Provisions of FHA Underwriting Manual, 1938 :\\"Recommended restrictions should include provisions for: prohibition of the occupancy of properties except by the race for which they are intended. ... Schools should be appropriate to the needs of the new community, and they should not be attended in large numbers by inharmonious racial groups.\\" ‚ÄîFederal Housing Administration, Underwriting Manual: Underwriting and Valuation Procedure Under Title II of the National Housing Act With Revisions to February, 1938 (Washington, D.C.), Part II, Section 9, Rating of Location. =Roads= After World War II, aided by the construction of the Interstate Highway System, many White Americans began leaving industrial cities for new housing in suburbs. The roads served to transport suburbanites to their city jobs, facilitating the development of suburbs, and shifting the tax base away from the city. This may have exacerbated urban decay. In some cases, such as in the Southern United States, local governments used highway road constructions to deliberately divide and isolate black neighborhoods from goods and services, often within industrial corridors. In Birmingham, Alabama, the local government used the highway system to perpetuate the racial residence-boundaries the city established with a 1926 racial zoning law. Constructing interstate highways through majority-black neighborhoods eventually reduced the populations to the poorest proportion of people financially unable to leave their destroyed community. =Blockbusting= The real estate business practice of \\"blockbusting\\" was a for-profit catalyst for white flight, and a means to control non-white migration. By subterfuge, real estate agents would facilitate black people buying a house in a white neighborhood, either by buying the house themselves, or via a white proxy buyer, and then re-selling it to the black family. The remaining white inhabitants (alarmed by real estate agents and the local news media), fearing devalued residential property, would quickly sell, usually at a loss. The realtors profited from these en masse sales and the ability to resell to the incoming black families, through arbitrage and the sales commissions from both groups. By such tactics, the racial composition of a neighborhood population was often changed completely in a few years. =Association with urban decay= Urban decay in the US: the South Bronx, New York City, was exemplar of the federal and local government's abandonment of the cities in the 1970s and 1980s; the Spanish sign reads \\"FALSAS PROMESAS\\", the English sign reads \\"BROKEN PROMISES\\". Urban decay is the sociological process whereby a city, or part of a city, falls into disrepair and decrepitude. Its characteristics are depopulation, economic restructuring, abandoned buildings, high local unemployment (and thus poverty), fragmented families, political disenfranchisement, crime, and a desolate, inhospitable city landscape. White flight contributed to the draining of cities' tax bases when middle-class people left. Abandoned properties attracted criminals and street gangs, contributing to crime.. \\"The construction of the Gowanus Parkway, laying a concrete slab on top of lively, bustling Third Avenue, buried the avenue in shadow, and when the parkway was completed, the avenue was cast forever into darkness and gloom, and its bustle and life were forever gone. In the 1970s and 1980s, urban decay was associated with Western cities, especially in North America and parts of Europe. In that time, major structural changes in global economies, transportation, and government policy created the economic, then social, conditions resulting in urban decay. White flight in North America started to reverse in the 1990s, when the rich suburbanites returned to cities, gentrifying the decayed urban neighborhoods. =Government-aided white flight= New municipalities were established beyond the abandoned city's jurisdiction to avoid the legacy costs of maintaining city infrastructures; instead new governments spent taxes to establish suburban infrastructures. The federal government contributed to white flight and the early decay of non-white city neighborhoods by withholding maintenance capital mortgages, thus making it difficult for the communities to either retain or attract middle-class residents. The new suburban communities limited the emigration of poor and non-white residents from the city by restrictive zoning; thus, few lower-middle-class people could afford a house in the suburbs. Many all-white suburbs were eventually annexed to the cities their residents had left. For instance, Milwaukee, Wisconsin partially annexed towns such as Granville; the (then) mayor, Frank P. Zeidler, complained about the socially destructive \\"Iron Ring\\" of new municipalities incorporated in the post‚ÄìWorld War II decade. Analogously, semi-rural communities, such as Oak Creek, South Milwaukee, and Franklin, formally incorporated as discrete entities to escape urban annexation. Wisconsin state law had allowed Milwaukee's annexation of such rural and suburban regions that did not qualify for discrete incorporation per the legal incorporation standards. =Desegregation of schools= In some areas, the post‚ÄìWorld War II racial desegregation of the public schools catalyzed white flight. In 1954, the US Supreme Court case Brown v. Board of Education (1954) ordered the de jure termination of the \\"separate, but equal\\" legal racism established with the Plessy v. Ferguson (1896) case in the 19th century. It declared that segregation of public schools was unconstitutional. Many southern jurisdictions mounted massive resistance to the policy. In some cases, white parents withdrew their children from public schools and established private religious schools instead. These schools, termed segregation academies, sprung up in the American South between the late 1950s and mid-1970s and allowed parents to prevent their children from being enrolled in racially mixed schools. Upon desegregation in 1957 in Baltimore, Maryland, the Clifton Park Junior High School had 2,023 white students and 34 black students; ten years later, it had twelve white students and 2,037 black students. In northwest Baltimore, Garrison Junior High School's student body declined from 2,504 whites and twelve blacks to 297 whites and 1,263 blacks in that period. At the same time, the city's working class population declined because of the loss of industrial jobs as heavy industry restructured. In Swann v. Charlotte- Mecklenburg Board of Education (1971), the Supreme Court ordered the desegregation busing of poor black students to suburban white schools, and suburban white students to the city to try to integrate student populations. In Milliken v. Bradley (1974), the dissenting Justice William Douglas observed, \\"The inner core of Detroit is now rather solidly black; and the blacks, we know, in many instances are likely to be poorer.\\" Likewise, in 1977, the Federal decision in Penick v. The Columbus Board of Education (1977) accelerated white flight from Columbus, Ohio. Although the racial desegregation of schools affected only public school districts, the most vehement opponents of racial desegregation have sometimes been whites whose children attended private schools. A secondary, non-geographic consequence of school desegregation and busing was \\"cultural\\" white flight: withdrawing white children from the mixed-race public school system and sending them to private schools unaffected by US federal integration laws. In 1970, when the United States District Court for the Central District of California ordered the Pasadena Unified School District desegregated, the proportion of white students (54%) reflected the school district's proportion of whites (53%). Once the federally ordered school desegregation began, whites who could afford private schools withdrew their children from the racially diverse Pasadena public school system. By 2004, Pasadena had 63 private schools educating some 33% of schoolchildren, while white students made up only 16% of the public school populace. The Pasadena Unified School District superintendent characterized public schools as \\"like the bogey-man\\" to whites. He implemented policies to attract white parents to the racially diverse Pasadena public school district. Oceania =Australia= In Sydney, Australian-born minority (white and non-white) people in Fairfield and Canterbury fell by three percentage points, six percentage points in Auburn, and three percentage points in Strathfield between 1991 and 1996. Only in Liverpool, one of the more fast growth areas of Sydney, did both the Australia-born and overseas- born male population increase over the 1991-1996 period. However, the rate of growth of the overseas-born was far greater than that of the Australia-born, thus the sharp increase in Liverpool's population share from 43.5 per cent to 49 per cent by 1996. The Australia-born movers from the south-western suburbs relocated to Penrith in the northwest and Gosford and Wyong in the northeast.Birrell, Bob, and Seol, Byung-Soo. \\"Sydney's Ethnic Underclass\\", People and Place, vol. 6, no. 3, September 1998. According to the New South Wales Secondary Principals Council and the University of Western Sydney, public schools in that state have experienced white flight to private and Catholic schools wherever there is a large presence of Aboriginal and Middle Eastern students. In 2018, NSW Labor Opposition leader Luke Foley talked about White flight, although he later apologised for the comments. =New Zealand= Percentages of New Zealand school rolls occupied by certain ethnic groups in 2011, broken down by socioeconomic decile. White flight is evident with low- decile schools have a disproportionately low number of European students and high numbers of Maori and Pacifika students, while the inverse is true for high-decile schools. White flight has been observed in low socioeconomic decile schools in New Zealand. Data from the Ministry of Education found that 60,000 New Zealand European students attended low-decile schools (situated in the poorest areas) in 2000, and had fallen to half that number in 2010. The same data also found that high-decile schools (which are in the wealthiest areas) had a corresponding increase in New Zealand European students. The Ministry claimed demographic changes were behind the shifts, but teacher and principal associations have attributed white flight to racial and class stigmas of low-decile schools, which commonly have majority Maori and Pacific Islander rolls. In one specific case, white flight has significantly affected Sunset Junior High School in a suburb of the city of Rotorua, with the total number of students reduced from 700 to 70 in the early 1980s. All but one of the 70 students are Maori. The area has a concentration of poor, low-skilled people, with struggling families, and many single mothers. Related to the social problems of the families, student educational achievement is low on the standard reading test.

He was a member of the four-man climbing team that made the first ascent of the North Face of the Eiger, the \\"last problem\\" of the Alps. He wrote the books Seven Years in Tibet (1952) and The White Spider (1959). Early life Heinrich Harrer was born 6 July 1912 in H√ºttenberg, Austria, in the district of Sankt Veit an der Glan in the state of Carinthia. His father was a postal worker. From 1933 to 1938, Harrer studied geography and sports at the Karl-Franzens University in Graz. Harrer became a member of the traditional student corporation ATV Graz. In 1935, Harrer was designated to participate in the Alpine skiing competition at the 1936 Winter Olympics in Garmisch-Partenkirchen. The Austrian Alpine skiing team, however, boycotted the event due to a conflict regarding the skiing instructors' status as professionals. As a result, Harrer did not participate. In 1937, Harrer won the downhill event at the World Student Championships at Zell am See. Eiger North Face Mountain climbing was Harrer's true passion. Knowing an extraordinary feat of climbing could win him a place on a Himalayan expedition, Harrer and a friend, Fritz Kasparek, resolved to be the first to climb the North Face of the Eiger (3,967 m, 13,025 ft) in the Bernese Alps of Switzerland. The near vertical wall, with its ice-field known as The White Spider, had claimed several lives; and the Bernese authorities even banned climbing it. Following his final university exams in July 1938, Harrer and Kasparek traveled to Kleine Scheidegg at the foot of the Eiger and set out on their climb. Halfway up the mountain, Harrer and Kasparek encountered another team making the attempt, Ludwig V√∂rg and Anderl Heckmair from Germany. The four decided to make the rest of the climb as a single team, with the experienced Heckmair leading. 262x262px Throughout the climb, the four men were constantly threatened by snow avalanches and rock falls. They were caught in an avalanche as they climbed the White Spider on the upper face, but all possessed sufficient strength to resist being swept off the face. The members successfully reached the summit at four o'clock in the afternoon 24 July 1938.Engel, Claire Eliane. A History of Mountaineering in the Alps. London: George Allen & Unwin, Ltd, 1950. This first ascent of the Eiger North Face was described by Italian climber Reinhold Messner as \\"a glorious moment in the history of mountaineering and a great sensation, since several climbers had previously perished on the Face\\",Messner, Reinhold. The Big Walls: From the North Face of the Eiger to the South Face of Dhaulagirl. Crowood, 2001, p. 105. made headlines around the world, and is recounted in Harrer's book The White Spider, published in 1959. Nazi involvement In 1996, ORF editor and filmmaker Gerald Lehner found in American archives the membership card of Harrer, who joined the Sturmabteilung (SA) in October 1933. After the Anschluss of March 1938, as Germany annexed Austria, he joined the Schutzstaffel (SS) on 1 April. He held the rank of Oberscharf√ºhrer (Sergeant), and on 1 May he became a member of the Nazi Party. After their ascent of the Eiger North Face, the four climbers were received by and photographed with Adolf Hitler. Harrer later said he wore his SS uniform only once, on the day of his marriage to Charlotte Wegener, daughter of the eminent explorer and scholar Alfred Wegener. After returning to Europe in 1952, Harrer was cleared of any pre-war crimes and this was later supported by Simon Wiesenthal. In his memoir, Beyond Seven Years in Tibet, Harrer called his involvement with the Nazi Party a mistake made in his youth, when he had not yet learned to think for himself. Internment in India In 1939, Harrer joined a four-man expedition, led by Peter Aufschnaiter, to the Diamir Face of the Nanga Parbat with the aim of finding an easier route to the peak. Having concluded that the face was viable, the four mountaineers were in Karachi, British India at the end of August, waiting for a freighter to take them home. The ship being long overdue, Harrer, Ludwig, and Hans Lobenhoffer tried to reach Persia, but several hundred kilometers northwest of Karachi they were put under the \\"protection\\" of British soldiers and escorted back to Karachi, where Aufschnaiter had stayed. Two days later, war was declared, and on 3 September 1939 all were put behind barbed wire to be transferred to a detention camp at Ahmednagar near Bombay. They considered escaping to Portuguese Goa, but when further transferred to Dehradun to be detained there for years with 1,000 other enemy aliens, they found Tibet more promising, the final goal being the Japanese front in Burma or China. Aufschnaiter and Harrer escaped and were re- captured a number of times before finally succeeding. On 29 April 1944, Harrer and six others, including Rolf Magener and Heins von Have (disguised as British officers), Aufschnaiter, the Salzburger Bruno Treipel (aka Treipl) and the Berliners Hans Kopp and Sattler (disguised as native Indian workers), walked out of the camp. Magener and von Have took the train to Calcutta and from there found their way to the Japanese army in Burma. The others headed for the closest border via Landour. After Sattler gave up on 10 May, the remaining four entered Tibet on 17 May 1944, crossing the Tsang Chok-la Pass (5,896 m, 19,350 ft) and thereafter split into two groups: Harrer and Kopp, Aufschnaiter and Treipel. On 17 June, Treipel, exhausted, bought himself a horse and rode back to the lowlands. Several months later, when the remaining three were still without visas for Tibet, Kopp also gave up and left for Nepal (where he was handed over to the British within a few days). Seven years in Tibet Clare Harris, The Museum of the Roof of the World: Art, Politics, and the Representation of Tibet, University of Chicago Press, 2012, 314 p., p. 199: \\"The Lhasa authorities have made some attempt to reinstate it [the view] by rebuilding the three stupas of the Pargo Kaling (Western Gate) that was destroyed in the 1960s.\\" Aufschnaiter and Harrer, helped by the former's knowledge of the Tibetan language, proceeded to Tibet's capital city, Lhasa, which they reached on 15 January 1946, having crossed Western Tibet (passing holy Mount Kailash), the South-West with Gyirong County, and the Northern Changthang. In 1948, Harrer became a salaried official of the Tibetan government, translating foreign news and acting as the Court photographer. Harrer first met the 14th Dalai Lama when he was summoned to the Potala Palace and asked to make a film about ice skating, which Harrer had introduced to Tibet. Harrer built a cinema for him, with a projector run off a Jeep engine. Harrer soon became the Dalai Lama's tutor in English, geography, and some science, and Harrer was astonished at how fast his pupil absorbed the Western world's knowledge. A strong friendship developed between the two that would last the rest of their lives. In 1952, Harrer returned to Austria where he documented his experiences in the books Seven Years in Tibet (1952) and Lost Lhasa (1953). Seven Years in Tibet was translated into 53 languages, and was a bestseller in the United States in 1954, selling three million copies. The book was the basis of two films of the same title, the first in 1956 and the second in 1997, starring Brad Pitt in the role of Harrer. In Seven Years in Tibet, Harrer wrote: Later adventures Following his return from Tibet, Harrer settled down in Kitzb√ºhel, Austria, and later in Liechtenstein. He took part in a number of ethnographic as well as mountaineering expeditions to Alaska, the Andes, and the Mountains of the Moon in central Africa. In 1953 he explored the source of the Amazon River and made a first ascent of Ausangate (6384 m). In 1954, some with German-American Fred Beckey, Harrer made the first ascents of Mount Deborah (3,761 m, 12,339 ft), Mount Hunter (4,442 m, 14,573 ft), and Mount Drum (3661 m), each in Alaska. In 1957, he explored the Congo River with the former king Leopold III of Belgium. In February 1962, he was the leader of the team of four climbers who made the first ascent of the Carstensz Pyramid (4,884 m, 16,024 ft; later named Puncak Jaya) on Papua, Indonesia, the highest peak in Oceania and one of the Seven Summits. This and his pioneering expedition to reach the Neolithic stone axe quarries at Ya-Li- Me are recorded in his memoir I Come from the Stone Age. In 1966, he met the Xingu Indians of Brazil's Mato Grosso. In 1972, Harrer crossed the island of Borneo. He also made expeditions to Nepal, French Guiana, Greenland, Sudan, India, Ladakh, Andaman Islands, Uganda, Kenya and Bhutan. Harrer wrote more than 20 books about his adventures, some including photographs considered to be among the best records of traditional Tibetan culture. Harrer was also an excellent golfer, winning Austrian national championships in 1958 and 1970. Private life In December 1938, Harrer married Lotte Wegener (1920‚Äì1989), the daughter of Alfred Wegener, German polar researcher and originator of the theory of continental drift. Her father had died on a Greenland expedition when she was 10. Their son Peter Harrer was born in December 1939, three months after Harrer had been interned by British forces in India. Their marriage was dissolved in 1943 while he was still in India. In 1953, he married Margaretha Truxa (divorce in 1958), and in 1962 he married Katharina Haarhaus (1962‚Äì2006), who remained his wife until his death. Final years 262x262px In the early 1980s, he visited Tibet again, and wrote a sequel to Seven Years in Tibet, titled Return to Tibet: Tibet After the Chinese Occupation. The Kirkus Review of his sequel said, He later wrote his autobiography published in English as Beyond Seven Years in Tibet in 2007. He made approximately 40 documentary films and founded the Heinrich Harrer Museum in H√ºttenberg, Austria dedicated to Tibet.

Normally, coral polyps live in an endosymbiotic relationship with these algae, which are crucial for the health of the coral and the reef. The algae provides up to 90 percent of the coral's energy. Bleached corals continue to live but begin to starve after bleaching. Some corals recover. The leading cause of coral bleaching is rising water temperatures. A temperature about 1 ¬∞C (or 2 ¬∞F) above average can cause bleaching. According to the United Nations Environment Programme, between 2014 and 2016 the longest recorded global bleaching events killed coral on an unprecedented scale. In 2016, bleaching of coral on the Great Barrier Reef killed between 29 and 50 percent of the reef's coral. In 2017, the bleaching extended into the central region of the reef. The average interval between bleaching events has halved between 1980 and 2016.  Process  Coral and microscopic algae have a symbiotic relationship. When water temperatures get too high, the algae leave the coral tissue and the coral begins to starve.What is coral bleaching? NOAA National Ocean Service. Accessed: 10 January 2020. Updated 7 January 2020. Zooxanthellae, the microscopic algae that lives inside coral, gives it colour and provides it with food through photosynthesis The corals that form the great reef ecosystems of tropical seas depend upon a symbiotic relationship with algae-like single-celled flagellate protozoa called zooxanthellae that live within their tissues and give the coral its coloration. The zooxanthellae provide the coral with nutrients through photosynthesis, a crucial factor in the clear and nutrient-poor tropical waters. In exchange, the coral provides the zooxanthellae with the carbon dioxide and ammonium needed for photosynthesis. Negative environmental conditions, such as abnormally warm or cool temperatures, high light, and even some microbial diseases, can lead to the breakdown of the coral/zooxanthellae symbiosis. To ensure short-term survival, the coral-polyp then consumes or expels the zooxanthellae. This leads to a lighter or completely white appearance, hence the term \\"bleached\\". As the zooxanthellae provide up to 90 percent of the coral's energy needs through products of photosynthesis, after expelling, the coral may begin to starve. Coral can survive short-term disturbances, but if the conditions that lead to the expulsion of the zooxanthellae persist, the coral's chances of survival diminish. In order to recover from bleaching, the zooxanthellae have to re-enter the tissues of the coral polyps and restart photosynthesis to sustain the coral as a whole and the ecosystem that depends on it. If the coral polyps die of starvation after bleaching, they will decay. The hard coral species will then leave behind their calcium carbonate skeletons, which will be taken over by algae, effectively blocking coral re-growth. Eventually, the coral skeletons will erode, causing the reef structure to collapse.  Triggers  Healthy coral at left and bleached, but still living, coral to right Coral bleaching may be caused by a number of factors. While localized triggers lead to localized bleaching, the large scale coral bleaching events of the recent years have been triggered by global warming. Under increased carbon dioxide concentration expected in the 21st century, corals are expected to becoming increasingly rare on reef systems. Coral reefs located in warm, shallow water with low water flow have been more affected than reefs located in areas with higher water flow. = List of triggers = Bleached coral‚Äîpartially overgrown with algae * increased water temperature (marine heatwaves, most commonly due to global warming), or reduced water temperaturesAnthony, K. 2007; Berkelmans * oxygen starvation caused by an increase in zooplankton levels as a result of overfishing * increased solar irradiance (photosynthetically active radiation and ultraviolet light) * increased sedimentation (due to silt runoff) * bacterial infections * changes in salinity * herbicides * extreme low tide and exposure * cyanide fishing * elevated sea levels due to global warming (Watson) * mineral dust from African dust storms caused by droughtU. S. Geological Survey. Coral Mortality and African Dust. Retrieved on 10 June 2007. * pollutants such as oxybenzone, butylparaben, octyl methoxycinnamate, or enzacamene: four common sunscreen ingredients that are nonbiodegradable and can wash off of skin * ocean acidification due to elevated levels of CO2 caused by air pollution * being exposed to Oil or other chemical spills  Mass bleaching events  Elevated sea water temperatures are the main cause of mass bleaching events. Sixty major episodes of coral bleaching have occurred between 1979 and 1990, with the associated coral mortality affecting reefs in every part of the world. In 2016, the longest coral bleaching event was recorded. The longest and most destructive coral bleaching event was because of the El Ni√±o that occurred from 2014‚Äì2017. During this time, over 70 percent of the coral reefs around the world have become damaged. Factors that influence the outcome of a bleaching event include stress-resistance which reduces bleaching, tolerance to the absence of zooxanthellae, and how quickly new coral grows to replace the dead. Due to the patchy nature of bleaching, local climatic conditions such as shade or a stream of cooler water can reduce bleaching incidence. Coral and zooxanthellae health and genetics also influence bleaching. Large coral colonies such as Porites are able to withstand extreme temperature shocks, while fragile branching corals such Acropora are far more susceptible to stress following a temperature change.Baird and Marshall 2002 Corals consistently exposed to low stress levels may be more resistant to bleaching.Gabriel D. Grinmsditch and Rodney V. Salm, Coral Reef Resilience and Resistance to Bleaching, \\"IUCN: The World Conservation Union\\", 2006 Scientists believe that the oldest known bleaching was that of the Late Devonian (Frasnian/Famennian), also triggered by the rise of sea surface temperatures. It resulted in the demise of the largest coral reefs in the Earth's history. According to Clive Wilkinson of Global Coral Reef Monitoring Network of Townsville, Australia, in 1998 the mass bleaching event that occurred in the Indian Ocean region was due to the rising of sea temperatures by 2 ¬∞C coupled with the strong El Ni√±o event in 1997‚Äì1998.  Impact  Two images of the Great Barrier Reef showing that the warmest water (top picture) coincides with the coral reefs (lower picture), setting up conditions that can cause coral bleaching In the 2012‚Äì2040 period, coral reefs are expected to experience more frequent bleaching events. The Intergovernmental Panel on Climate Change (IPCC) sees this as the greatest threat to the world's reef systems. During this period, 19 percent of coral reefs worldwide were lost, and 60 percent of the remaining reefs are at immediate risk of being lost. There are a couple of ways to discern the impact of coral bleaching on reefs: coral cover (the more coral that is covering the ground, the less of an impact bleaching had) and coral abundance (the number of different living species on the coral reef). With the increase of coral bleaching events worldwide, National Geographic noted in 2017, \\"In the past three years, 25 reefs‚Äîwhich comprise three-fourths of the world's reef systems‚Äîexperienced severe bleaching events in what scientists concluded was the worst-ever sequence of bleachings to date.\\" Coral bleaching events and the subsequent loss of coral coverage often result in the decline of fish diversity. The loss of diversity and abundance in herbivorous fish particularly affect coral reef ecosystems.Pratchett, M. S., Hoey, A. S., Wilson, S. K., Messmer, V., & Graham, N. A. (2011). Changes in biodiversity and functioning of reef fish assemblages following coral bleaching and coral loss. Diversity, 3(3), 424-452. As mass bleaching events occur more frequently, fish populations will continue to homogenize. Smaller and more specialized fish species that fill particular ecological niches that are crucial for coral health are replaced by more generalized species. The loss of specialization likely to contributes to loss of resilience in coral reef ecosystems after bleaching events. = Pacific Ocean = A major coral bleaching event took place on this part of the Great Barrier Reef in Australia.  Great Barrier Reef  The Great Barrier Reef along the coast of Australia experienced bleaching events in 1980, 1982, 1992, 1994, 1998, 2002, 2006, 2016 and 2017. Some locations suffered severe damage, with up to 90% mortality. The most widespread and intense events occurred in the summers of 1998 and 2002, with 42% and 54%, respectively, of reefs bleached to some extent, and 18% strongly bleached. However, coral losses on the reef between 1995 and 2009 were largely offset by growth of new corals. An overall analysis of coral loss found that coral populations on the Great Barrier Reef had declined by 50.7% from 1985 to 2012, but with only about 10% of that decline attributable to bleaching, and the remaining 90% caused about equally by tropical cyclones and by predation by crown-of-thorns starfishes. A global mass coral bleaching has been occurring since 2014 because of the highest recorded temperatures plaguing oceans. These temperatures have caused the most severe and widespread coral bleaching ever recorded in the Great Barrier reef. The most severe bleaching in 2016 occurred near Port Douglas. In late November 2016 surveys of 62 reefs showed that long term heat stress from climate change caused a 29% loss of shallow water coral. The highest coral death and reef habitat loss was inshore and mid-shelf reefs around Cape Grenville and Princess Charlotte Bay.Final Report: 2016 Coral Bleaching Event on Great Barrier Reef . Great Barrier Reef Marine Park Authority Townsville, 2017, pp. 24‚Äì24, Final Report: 2016 Coral Bleaching Event on Great Barrier Reef . The IPCC's moderate warming scenarios (B1 to A1T, 2 ¬∞C by 2100, IPCC, 2007, Table SPM.3, p. 13) forecast that corals on the Great Barrier Reef are very likely to regularly experience summer temperatures high enough to induce bleaching.  Hawaii  In 1996, Hawaii's first major coral bleaching occurred in Kaneohe Bay, followed by major bleaching events in the Northwest islands in 2002 and 2004. In 2014, biologists from the University of Queensland observed the first mass bleaching event, and attributed it to The Blob. In 2014 and 2015, a survey in Hanauma Bay Nature Preserve on Oahu found 47% of the corals suffering from coral bleaching and close to 10% of the corals dying. In 2014 and 2015, 56% of the coral reefs of the big island were affected by coral bleaching events. During the same period, 44% of the corals on west Maui were effected. On 24 January 2019, scientists with The Nature Conservancy found that the reefs had begun to stabilize nearly 4 years after the last bleaching event.  Jarvis Island  Eight severe and two moderate bleaching events occurred between 1960 and 2016 in the coral community in Jarvis Island, with the 2015‚Äì16 bleaching displaying the unprecedented severity in the record.  Japan  According to the 2017 Japanese government report, almost 75% of Japan's largest coral reef in Okinawa has died from bleaching. = Indian Ocean = Coral reef provinces have been permanently damaged by warm sea temperatures, most severely in the Indian Ocean. Up to 90% of coral cover has been lost in the Maldives, Sri Lanka, Kenya and Tanzania and in the Seychelles during the massive 1997‚Äì98 bleaching event. The Indian Ocean in 1998 reported 20% of its coral had died and 80% was bleached. The shallow tropical areas of the Indian Ocean are already experiencing what are predicted to be worldwide ocean conditions in the future. Coral that has survived in the shallow areas of the Indian Ocean may be proper candidates for coral restoration efforts in other areas of the world because they are able to survive the extreme conditions of the ocean.Freeman, L. A., Kleypas, J. A., & Miller, A. J. (2013). Coral reef habitat response to climate change scenarios. PloS one, 8(12).  Maldives  The Maldives has over 20,000 km2 of reefs, of which more than 60% of the coral has suffered from bleaching in 2016.  Thailand  Thailand experienced a severe mass bleaching in 2010 which affected 70% of the coral in the Andaman Sea. Between 30% and 95% of the bleached coral died.  Indonesia  In 2017 there was a study done on two islands in Indonesia to see how their coral cover was. One of the places was Melinjo Islands and the other was Saktu Islands. In Saktu Island the lifeform conditions were categorized as bad, with an average coral cover of 22.3%. In Melinjo Islands the lifeform conditions were categorized as bad, with an average coral cover of 22.2%. = Atlantic Ocean =  United States  In South Florida, a 2016 survey of large corals from Key Biscayne to Fort Lauderdale found that about 66% of the corals were dead or reduced to less than half of their live tissue.  Belize  The first recorded mass bleaching event that took place in the Belize Barrier Reef was in 1998, where sea level temperatures reached up to from 10 August to 14 October. For a few days, Hurricane Mitch brought in stormy weather on 27 October but only reduced temperatures by 1 degree or less. During this time period, mass bleaching in the fore-reef and lagoon occurred. While some fore reef colonies suffered some damage, coral mortality in the lagoon was catastrophic. The most prevalent coral in the reefs Belize in 1998 was the lettuce coral, Agaricia tenuifolia. On 22 and 23 October, surveys were conducted at two sites and the findings were devastating. Virtually all the living coral was bleached white and their skeletons indicated that they had died recently. At the lagoon floor, complete bleaching was evident among A. tenuifolia. Furthermore, surveys done in 1999 and 2000 showed a near total mortality of A. tenuifolia at all depths. Similar patterns occurred in other coral species as well. Measurements on water turbidity suggest that these mortalities were attributed to rising water temperatures rather than solar radiation.  Caribbean  Hard coral cover on reefs in the Caribbean have declined by an estimated 80%, from an average of 50% cover in the 1970s to only about 10% cover in the early 2000s. A 2013 study to follow up on a mass bleaching event in Tobago from 2010 showed that after only one year, the majority of the dominant species declined by about 62% while coral abundance declined by about 50%. However, between 2011 and 2013, coral cover increased for 10 of the 26 dominant species but declined for 5 other populations. = Other areas = Coral in the south Red Sea does not bleach despite summer water temperatures up to . Coral bleaching in the Red Sea is more common in the northern section of the reefs, the southern part of the reef has been plagued by coral eating starfish, dynamite fishing and human impacts on the environment. In 1988 there was a massive bleaching event that affected the reefs in Saudi Arabia and in Sudan, the southern reefs were more resilient and affected them very little. Previously it was thought that the North suffers more from coral bleaching but they show a fast turnover of coral and the southern reef was thought to not suffer from bleaching as harshly, they show more consistency. However, new research shows where the south reef should be bigger and healthier than the north it was not. This is believed to be because of major disturbances in recent history from bleaching events, and coral eating starfish. In 2010, coral bleaching occurred in Saudi Arabia and Sudan, where the temperature rose 10 to 11 degrees. Certain taxa experienced 80% to 100% of their colonies bleaching, while some showed on average 20% of that taxa bleaching. = Economic and political impact = According to Brian Skoloff of The Christian Science Monitor, \\"If the reefs vanished, experts say, hunger, poverty and political instability could ensue.\\"Skoloff, Brian (26 March 2010) Death of coral reefs could devastate nations, The Christian Science Monitor Since countless sea life depend on the reefs for shelter and protection from predators, the extinction of the reefs would ultimately create a domino effect that would trickle down to the many human societies that depend on those fish for food and livelihood. There has been a 44% decline over the last 20 years in the Florida Keys, and up to 80% in the Caribbean alone.\\"Endangered Coral Reefs Die as Ocean Temperatures Rise and Water Turns Acidic\\", PBS Newshour, 5 December 2012 Coral reefs provide various ecosystem services, one of which is being a natural fishery, as many frequently consumed commercial fish spawn or live out their juvenile lives in coral reefs around the tropics. Thus, reefs are a popular fishing site and are an important source of income for fishers, especially small, local fisheries. As coral reef habitat decreases due to bleaching, reef associated fish populations also decrease, which affects fishing opportunities. A model from one study by Speers et al. calculated direct losses to fisheries from decreased coral cover to be around $49‚Äì69 billion, if human societies continue to emit high levels of greenhouse gases. But, these losses could be reduced for a consumer surplus benefit of about $14‚Äì20 billion, if societies chose to emit a lower level of greenhouse gases instead. These economic losses also have important political implications, as they fall disproportionately on developing countries where the reefs are located, namely in Southeast Asia and around the Indian Ocean. It would cost more for countries in these areas to respond to coral reef loss as they would need to turn to different sources of income and food, in addition to losing other ecosystem services such as ecotourism. A study completed by Chen et al. suggested that the commercial value of reefs decreases by almost 4% every time coral cover decreases by 1% because of losses in ecotourism and other potential outdoor recreational activities. Coral reefs also act as a protective barrier for coastlines by reducing wave impact, which lowers the damage from storms, erosions, and flooding. Countries that lose this natural protection will lose more money because of the increased susceptibility of storms. This indirect cost, combined with the lost revenue in tourism, will result in enormous economic effects. = Monitoring reef sea surface temperature = The US National Oceanic and Atmospheric Administration (NOAA) monitors for bleaching \\"hot spots\\", areas where sea surface temperature rises 1 ¬∞C or more above the long-term monthly average. The \\"hot spots\\" are the location in which thermal stress is measured and with the development of Degree Heating Week (DHW), the coral reef's thermal stress is monitored. Global coral bleaching is being detected earlier due to the satellite remote sensing the rise of sea temperatures.Liu, Gang & Strong, Alan & Skirving, William & Arzayus, Felipe. (2005). Overview of NOAA coral reef watch program's near-real time satellite global coral bleaching monitoring activities. Proc 10th Int Coral Reef Symp. 1. pp. 1783‚Äì1793. It is necessary to monitor the high temperatures because coral bleaching events are affecting coral reef reproduction and normal growth capacity, as well as it weakening corals, eventually leading to their mortality. This system detected the worldwide 1998 bleaching event, that corresponded to the 1997‚Äì98 El Ni√±o event. Currently, 190 reef sites around the globe are monitored by the NOAA, and send alerts to research scientists and reef managers via NOAA Coral Reef Watch (CRW) website. By monitoring the warming of sea temperatures, the early warnings of coral bleaching, alerts reef managers to prepare and draw awareness to future bleaching events. The first mass global bleaching events were recorded in 1998 and 2010, which was when the El Ni√±o caused the oceans temperatures to rise and worsened the corals living conditions. The 2014‚Äì2017 El Ni√±o was recorded to be the longest and most damaging to the corals, which harmed over 70% of our coral reefs. Over two thirds of the Great Barrier Reef have been reported to be bleached or dead. = Changes in ocean chemistry = Increasing ocean acidification due to rises in carbon dioxide levels exacerbates the bleaching effects of thermal stress. Acidification affects the corals' ability to create calcareous skeletons, essential to their survival. This is because ocean acidification decreases the amount of carbonate ion in the water, making it more difficult for corals to absorb the calcium carbonate they need for the skeleton. As a result, the resilience of reefs goes down, while it becomes easier for them to erode and dissolve. In addition, the increase in CO2 allows herbivore overfishing and nutrification to change coral-dominated ecosystems to algal-dominated ecosystems. A recent study from the Atkinson Center for a Sustainable Future found that with the combination of acidification and temperature rises, the levels of CO2 could become too high for coral to survive in as little as 50 years. = Infectious disease = Infectious bacteria of the species Vibrio shiloi are the bleaching agent of Oculina patagonica in the Mediterranean Sea, causing this effect by attacking the zooxanthellae. V. shiloi is infectious only during warm periods. Elevated temperature increases the virulence of V. shiloi, which then become able to adhere to a beta-galactoside-containing receptor in the surface mucus of the host coral. V. shiloi then penetrates the coral's epidermis, multiplies, and produces both heat-stable and heat-sensitive toxins, which affect zooxanthellae by inhibiting photosynthesis and causing lysis. During the summer of 2003, coral reefs in the Mediterranean Sea appeared to gain resistance to the pathogen, and further infection was not observed. The main hypothesis for the emerged resistance is the presence of symbiotic communities of protective bacteria living in the corals. The bacterial species capable of lysing V. shiloi had not been identified as of 2011.  Coral adaptation  In 2010, researchers at Penn State discovered corals that were thriving while using an unusual species of symbiotic algae in the warm waters of the Andaman Sea in the Indian Ocean. Normal zooxanthellae cannot withstand temperatures as high as was there, so this finding was unexpected. This gives researchers hope that with rising temperatures due to global warming, coral reefs will develop tolerance for different species of symbiotic algae that are resistant to high temperature, and can live within the reefs. In 2010, researchers from Stanford University also found corals around the Samoan Islands that experience a drastic temperature increase for about four hours a day during low tide. The corals do not bleach or die regardless of the high heat increase. Studies showed that the corals off the coast of Ofu Island near America Samoa have become trained to withstand the high temperatures. Researchers are now asking a new question: can we condition corals, that are not from this area, in this manner and slowly introduce them to higher temperatures for short periods of time and make them more resilient against rising ocean temperatures.  Recovery and macroalgal regime shifts  After corals experience a bleaching event to increased temperature stress some reefs are able to return to their original, pre-bleaching state. Reefs either recover from bleaching, where they are recolonized by zooxanthellae, or they experience a regime shift, where previously flourishing coral reefs are taken over by thick layers of macroalgae. This inhibits further coral growth because the algae produces antifouling compounds to deter settlement and competes with corals for space and light. As a result, macroalgae forms stable communities that make it difficult for corals to grow again. Reefs will then be more susceptible to other issues, such as declining water quality and removal of herbivore fish, because coral growth is weaker. Discovering what causes reefs to be resilient or recover from bleaching events is of primary importance because it helps inform conservation efforts and protect coral more effectively. A primary subject of research regarding coral recovery pertains to the idea of super- corals, otherwise referred to as the corals that live and thrive in naturally warmer and more acidic regions and bodies of water. When transplanted to endangered or bleached reefs, their resilience and irradiance can equip the algae to live among the bleached corals. As Emma Camp, a National Geographic Explorer, marine bio-geochemist and an ambassador for Biodiversity for the charity IBEX Earth, suggests, the super-corals could have the capability to help with the damaged reefs long-term. While it can take 10 to 15 years to restore damaged and bleached coral reefs, the super-corals could have lasting impacts despite climate change as the oceans rise in temperature and gain more acidity. Bolstered by the research of Ruth Gates, Camp has looked into lower oxygen levels and the extreme, unexpected habitats that reefs can be found in across the globe. Corals have shown to be resilient to short-term disturbances. Recovery has been shown in after storm disturbance and crown of thorns starfish invasions. Fish species tend to fare better following reef disturbance than coral species as corals show limited recovery and reef fish assemblages have shown little change as a result of short-term disturbances. In contrast, fish assemblages in reefs that experience bleaching exhibit potentially damaging changes. One study by Bellwood et al. notes that while species richness, diversity, and abundance did not change, fish assemblages contained more generalist species and less coral dependent species. Responses to coral bleaching are diverse between reef fish species, based on what resources are affected. Rising sea temperature and coral bleaching do not directly impact adult fish mortality, but there are many indirect consequences of both. Coral-associated fish populations tend to be in decline due to habitat loss; however, some herbivorous fish populations have seen a drastic increase due to the increase of algae colonization on dead coral. Studies note that better methods are needed to measure the effects of disturbance on the resilience of corals. The lemon damselfish (Pomacentrus moluccensis) is a coral-associated species that has been shown to decline dramatically following coral bleaching. Until recently, the factors mediating the recovery of coral reefs from bleaching were not well studied. Research by Graham et al. (2005) studied 21 reefs around Seychelles in the Indo-Pacific in order to document the long-term effects of coral bleaching. After the loss of more than 90% of corals due to bleaching in 1998 around 50% of the reefs recovered and roughly 40% of the reefs experienced regime shifts to macroalgae dominated compositions. After an assessment of factors influencing the probability of recovery, the study identified five major factors: density of juvenile corals, initial structural complexity, water depth, biomass of herbivorous fishes, and nutrient conditions on the reef. Overall, resilience was seen most in coral reef systems that were structurally complex and in deeper water. The ecological roles and functional groups of species also play a role in the recovery of regime shifting potential in reef systems. Coral reefs are affected by bioeroding, scraping, and grazing fish species. Bioeroding species remove dead corals, scraping species remove algae and sediment to further future growth, grazing species remove algae. The presence of each type of species can influence the ability for normal levels of coral recruitment which is an important part of coral recovery. Lowered numbers of grazing species after coral bleaching in the Caribbean has been likened to sea-urchin- dominated systems which do not undergo regime shifts to fleshy macroalgae dominated conditions. There is always the possibility of unobservable changes, or cryptic losses or resilience, in a coral community's ability to perform ecological processes. These cryptic losses can result in unforeseen regime changes or ecological flips. More detailed methods for determining the health of coral reefs that take into account long-term changes to the coral ecosystems and better-informed conservation policies are necessary to protect coral reefs in the years to come.  Rebuilding coral reefs  Research is being done to help slow down the mortality rate of corals. Worldwide projects are being completed to help replenish and restore the coral reefs. Current coral restoration efforts include microfragmentation, coral farming, and relocation. The population of corals is rapidly declining, so scientists are doing experiments in coral growth and research tanks to help replenish the population of corals. These research tanks mimic the coral reefs natural environment in the ocean. They are growing corals in these tanks to use for their experiments, so no more corals are being harmed or taken from the ocean. They are also transplanting the successfully grown corals from the research tanks and putting them into the areas of the ocean where the reefs are dying out. An experiment is being done in some coral growth and research tanks by Ruth Gates and Madelaine Van Oppen. They are trying to make \\"super corals\\" that can withstand some of the environmental factors that the corals are currently dying from. Van Oppen is also working on developing a type of algae that will have a symbiotic relationship with corals and can withstand water temperature fluctuations for long periods of time. This project may be helping to replenish our reefs, but the growing process of corals in research tanks is very time-consuming. It can take at least 10 years for the corals to fully grow and mature enough to where they will be able to breed. Following Ruth Gates' death in October 2018, her team at the Gates Coral Lab at the Hawai'i Institute of Marine Biology continues her research on restoration efforts. Continuing research and restoration efforts at the Gates Coral Lab focuses on the effects of beneficial mutations, genetic variation, and relocation via human assistance on the resilience of coral reefs.Van Oppen, M. J., & Gates, R. D. (2006). Conservation genetics and the resilience of reef‚Äêbuilding corals. Molecular Ecology, 15(13), 3863-3883.Drury C. (2020) Resilience in Reef-Building Corals: The ecological and evolutionary importance of the host response to thermal stress. Molecular Ecology As of 2019, the Gates Coral Lab team determined that large-scale restoration techniques would not be effective; localized efforts to restore coral reefs on an individual basis are tested to be more realistic and effective while research is conducted to determine the best ways to combat coral destruction on a mass scale.Ainsworth TD, CL Hurd, RD Gates, PW Boyd (2019) How do we overcome abrupt degradation of marine ecosystems and meet the challenge of heatwaves and climate extremes? Global Change Biology 26: 343-354 https://doi.org/10.1111/gcb.14901  Economic value of coral reefs  Coral reefs provide shelter to an estimated quarter of all ocean species. Experts estimate that coral reef services are worth up to $1.2 million per hectare which translates to an average of $172 billion per year. The benefits of coral reefs include providing physical structures such as coastal shoreline protection, biotic services within and between ecosystems, biogeochemical services such as maintaining nitrogen levels in the ocean, climate records, and recreational and commercial (tourism) services. Coral reefs are one of the best marine ecosystems to use to as a food source. The coral reefs are also the perfect habitat for rare and economically important species of tropical fish, as they provide the perfect area for fish to breed and create nurseries in. If the populations of the fish and corals in the reef are high, then we can use the area as a place to gather food and things with medicinal properties, which also helps create jobs for people who can collect these specimens. The reefs also have some cultural importance in specific regions around the world.  Cost benefit analysis of reducing loss of coral reefs  In 2010, the Convention on Biological Diversity's (CBD) Strategic Plan for Biodiversity 2011‚Äì2020 created twenty distinct targets for sustainable development for post-2015. Target 10 indicates the goal of minimizing \\"anthropogenic pressures on coral reefs\\". Two programs were looked at, one that reduces coral reef loss by 50% that has a capital cost of $684 million and a recurrent cost of $81 million. The other program reduces coral reef loss by 80 percent and has a capital cost of $1.036 million with recurring costs of $130 million. CBD acknowledges that they may be underestimating the costs and resources needed to achieve this target due to lack of relevant data but nonetheless, the cost-benefit analysis shows that the benefits outweigh the costs by a great enough amount for both programs (benefit cost ratio of 95.3 and 98.5) that \\"there is ample scope to increase outlays on coral protection and still achieve a benefit to cost ratio that is well over one\\".

Its name is often colloquially shortened to \\"Gala\\". The town is a major commercial centre for the Borders region with extensive history in the textile industry. Galashiels is the location of Heriot-Watt University's School of Textiles and Design.Borders College, About our College, accessed 10 November 2018 Location Galashiels is south of Edinburgh and north of Carlisle on the A7 road. Gala lies on the border between the historic counties of Roxburghshire and Selkirkshire, on the Gala Water river. History Border Reiver statue at Galashiels (by Thomas J Clapperton) Bank Street Gardens, Galashiels To the west of the town there is an ancient earthwork known as the Picts' Work Ditch or Catrail. It extends many miles south and its height and width vary. There is no agreement about the purpose of the earthwork. There is another ancient site on the north-western edge of the town, at Torwoodlee, an Iron Age hill fort, with a later Broch known as Torwoodlee Broch built in the western quarter of the hill fort, and overlapping some of the defensive ditches of the original fort. The Romans destroyed the broch in AD 140, soon after it was completed. The town's coat of arms shows two foxes reaching up to eat plums from a tree, and the motto is Sour Plums pronounced in Scots as soor plooms. This is a reference to an incident in 1337 when a raiding party of English soldiers were picking wild plums close to the town and were caught by Scots who came across them by chance and slaughtered them all. On a hillside to the north of the town, Buckholm Tower is a prominent structure that dates back to 1582 and replaced an earlier tower built on the same site but destroyed around 1570. In 1599 Galashiels received its Burgh Charter, an event celebrated every summer since the 1930s by the \\"Braw Lads‚Äô Gathering\\", with riders on horseback parading through the town. The Paton Street drill hall was completed in the late 19th century. Galashiels' population grew fast through the textile trade with several mills. A connection with the town's mill history, the Mill Lade, still links the town from near the site of mills at Wheatlands Road, to Netherdale, via Wilderhaugh, Bank Street, the Fountain and next to the Tesco/retail development Street. Sport The following sports clubs are based in Galashiels: * Gala Cricket Club * Gala Fairydean Rovers (association football) * Gala RFC (rugby union) * Galashiels Golf Club * Gala Harriers Athletic Club established 1902 In culture The Braw Lad and Lass crossing the Tweed Braw Lads Gathering 2011 Robert Burns wrote two poems about Galashiels, \\"Sae Fair Her Hair\\" and \\"Braw Lads\\". The latter is sung by some of the townsfolk each year at the Braw Lads Gathering. Sir Walter Scott built his home, Abbotsford, just across the River Tweed from Galashiels. The Sir Walter Scott Way, a long-distance path from Moffat to Cockburnspath, passes through Galashiels. There is some largely good-hearted rivalry between some of the Galashiels townsfolk and those of other border towns, particularly Hawick, the next largest town in the Scottish Borders. Galashiels' citizens often refer to their rival as dirty Hawick while the 'Teries' retort that Galashiels's residents are pail merks, supposedly because their town was the last to be plumbed into the mains water system and so residents had to rely on buckets as toilets. Galashiels was also home to the author of the famous Scottish song, \\"Coulters Candy\\". Robert Coltart was a weaver in the town, but also made confectionery in nearby Melrose. The song was created as an advertisement, and hence was renamed as \\"Sugar Candy\\" when played by the BBC. The song is possibly better known by the first line of its chorus - \\"Ally, bally, ally bally bee\\". Coltart died in 1890. A statue of Coltart now stands in the Market Square. The 1985 Marillion hit single Kayleigh was partially inspired by events that took place in Galashiels as the band's lead singer Fish spent some time in the town in his earlier years. In 2012 the Scottish Borders Council undertook work to revamp the Market Square with lyrics of the song inscribed into the paving slabs. Fish officially reopened the square on completion later that year. Transport Galashiels Transport Interchange, a combined bus and railway station, shown in August 2015 In 1969, the historic Waverley Line which connected the Scottish Borders to the national rail network was closed as part of a wider series of cuts to British Railways. The closure led to a campaign for a return of rail to the region that never diminished. Following years of campaigning, in 2006, the Waverley Railway (Scotland) Act was passed by the Scottish Parliament, which authorised a partial restoration of the service. The new Borders Railway, which links Galashiels with Edinburgh, saw four new stations built in Midlothian and three in the Scottish Borders. For most of the route the original line was followed with of new railway line built. The project is estimated to have cost ¬£294 million and was completed in September 2015, with the formal opening on 9 September by the Queen. Trains from Galashiels railway station run every half-hour going down to hourly in the evening and on Sundays. Journey times between Tweedbank and Edinburgh take less than one hour. The town also has a recently opened Interchange building which replaces the old bus station, and is also situated next to the railway station. It has a caf√©, allowing travelers and commuters to relax prior to their bus or train journey, and upstairs has office space that has been leased to businesses and organizations. It also has full toilet and baby changing facilities, and a travel helpdesk. Education The following are listed by Scottish Borders Council as being in the Galashiels area and are catchment schools for Galashiels Academy. Primary schools * Balmoral Primary * Burgh Primary * Clovenfords Primary (moved from Caddonfoot in 2012) * Fountainhall Primary, Midlothian * Glendinning Terrace Primary * Heriot Primary, Midlothian * Langlee Primary * Stow Primary * St Margaret's Roman Catholic Primary * St Peter's Primary * Tweedbank Primary Secondary schools * Galashiels Academy Further and Higher education Netherdale in Galashiels is home to Heriot-Watt University's School of Textiles and Design, which is also a shared campus of Borders College. Redevelopment Despite the town's relatively low population, the early 2000s saw many new developments, including Asda, Boots pharmacy, Halfords, Marks & Spencer, Matalan, McDonald's, Next, Subway fast- food outlet and Tesco Extra. Most of these are on former mill and industrial estate sites, while other disused mills have been converted to living accommodation. Unusual landmarks or local features The town is home to the Glasite church, in danger of being lost, but still standing sandwiched between mills and shop buildings on High Street, Botany Lane and Roxburgh Street. Netherdale is home to Gala RFC and Gala Fairydean Rovers, with the football and rugby stadiums adjoining each other at one end. The football club's main stand was built in 1963 to designs by Peter Womersley, based in nearby Gattonside. The cantilevered concrete structure, in the Brutalist style, is now protected as a Category A listed building. Suburbs =Balmoral= Located in the south west of the town on Meigle Hill. Mainly ex-local authority houses. Served by Balmoral Primary School. Balmoral connects with Windyknowe and Gala Park where there are some stone built properties dating from the Victorian era as well as private housing from the 70s and 80s near to the Victoria Park. =Halliburton= Sits high up the hill as you leave Galashiels on the A7 towards Edinburgh at the north-west of the town. Consists of two large streets (Halliburton Place and Glendinning Terrace) that run parallel with Magdala Terrace and further on Bristol Terrace, which make up part of the A7. =Kilnknowe / Torwoodlee= Kilnknowe and Torwoodlee are in the north west of the town. The main street running through this area is Wood Street, and is part of the A72, that carries on to Clovenfords, Innerleithen and Peebles. Kilnknowe Place, Balnakiel Terrace, Torwoodlee Road, Pringle Lane and Blynlee Lane, mainly ex-local authority houses from the 1970s, are streets in this area. =Kingsknowes= The area most vehicles pass through; Kingsknowes is in the extreme south of Galashiels. The A7 from Selkirk enters from the south-west up to Kingsknowes roundabout before heading north-west into Galashiels. The A6091 starts here and heads east past Tweedbank, Darnick, Melrose and Newstead to the A68. This is the preferred route from Carlisle to Edinburgh as the A7 loses its Trunk Road status here. =Ladhope= Neighbouring Halliburton, Ladhope, comprising homes from the past four decades, stretches high up on the hillside, largely connecting Halliburton to the High Road, Melrose Road area of Galashiels. It is also home to Galashiels Golf Club and Heatheryetts grave yard. =Langlee= Built on both sides of Melrose Road to the east of the town and north of the Gala Water and River Tweed. Consists of ex-local authority homes and a handful of older, stone- built properties along the Melrose Road. =Netherdale= In the east of the town, Netherdale is home to Gala RFC and Gala Fairydean Rovers F.C.. The Scottish Borders campus of Heriot-Watt University is located here also. Netherdale is a possible location for one of the two new primary schools needing built in Galashiels due to the town expanding. Netherdale is also home to the 'Raid Stane' (Raid Stone). This stone marks the site of skirmish between the residents of Galashiels and English raiders during the Scottish wars of independence. The stone is marked by a small sign, located on the lawn next to Netherdale car park. =The Old Town= Now a mixture of housing and a busy thoroughfare through town, this part of Galashiels has a market or mercat cross and is surrounded by remnants of the town's history, with a former cloth hall, the Gala Aisle, and Tea Street in the neighbouring area. =Town centre= In Galashiels, Channel Street is considered the main shopping street and has a pedestrian precinct and other traffic calming measures to ensure shopping in the town is a pleasurable experience. Most visitors will appreciate Bank Street gardens situated in the town centre. There is an award- winning war memorial by Robert Lorimer constructed in the style of a Peel Tower fronted by a statue of a Border Reiver. Galashiels also has a multi- screen cinema on Market Street and along with several restaurants and night- clubs gives Galashiels a very urban and city-like feel despite its comparatively small population =Tweedbank= Tweedbank is south of Galashiels, centred around Gunknowe Loch, also known as Tweedbank Pond. There is a small latte shop, a primary school, a community centre ‚Äì used for scouts, guides, rainbows etc. ‚Äì and the newest addition to Tweedbank is a bar and restaurant located next to the loch. Tweedbank also has an industrial estate and is home to radio station, Radio Borders. The town is also the terminus of the Borders Railway. Although now technically separate, Tweedbank's population is often lumped in with Galashiels, with a total area population of 14361 recorded in the 2001 census. =The Black Path= This particular geographical formerly linked Langlee and Tweedbank to the town centre. It has been replaced when The Borders Railway which has been rebuilt and now currently has the Scotrail service from Tweedbank to Edinburgh running over it. A section of the Black Path links to the Southern Upland Way. =Other areas= Other areas not listed include Windyknowe, between Galapark and Wood Street, and Glenfield/Langhaugh between the town centre and Langlee where housing developments have seen these places expand in recent years. Both have elderly residential homes complexes. Not formally part of one area or another, there are also streets of former mill terraces just off the town centre, including at St John Street, Gala Park and Scott Street. These link with parts of the Old Town and bear similarities here with blocks of flats dating from the 1960s and 70s evident among the terraces. Also away from town are places such as Duke Street, King Street and Union Street where again, mill terraces dominate but their former associated workplaces have long since been demolished to be replaced with modern retail or business units. Duke Street almost stands alone but was once connected to Wilderhaugh with terraced rows such as Queen Street once forming an almost unbroken link. There are also 1960s/70s flats mixed with terraces around Netherdale, including at Dale Street and Greenbank Street.

However, due to its elevated position and distance from the sea, it has colder winters and slightly warmer summers than coastal places such as Edinburgh, Dunbar and Eyemouth. Snow is also much more common in winter, and covers the ground for an average of 38 days a year in an average winter.

Elected Bishop of Cloyne in 1767 and translated to the see of Derry in 1768, Hervey served as Lord Bishop of Derry until his death in 1803. As Edward Gibbon remarked \\"every great man is something of a builder\\" and the magnificent mansions at Downhill and Ballyscullion bear testimony that Lord Bristol had at least one of the elements of greatness. Accordingly, he became known as the Edifying Bishop or The Earl-Bishop (in allusion to prince-bishop).  Early life  Frederick Hervey was born in Suffolk, and attended Westminster School before going up to Corpus Christi College, Cambridge, where he read Law. He took an MA degree in 1754 and was later awarded a DD (Cantab) in 1770. Hewetson at NPG Titles Accorded the courtesy style of The Hon. after his father's death in 1743, both Frederick Hervey's brothers died without an heir. Thus he succeeded his immediate elder brother, Admiral The 3rd Earl of Bristol, in the titles in December 1779, becoming the 4th earl. He also inherited the Hervey family's extensive ancestral estates centred on Ickworth in Suffolk. Lord Bristol conceived the redevelopment of the Ickworth Estate to a standard appropriate to his family's wealth with the added practical purpose of housing his extensive art collection. Work started in 1794, but so ambitious was the project that by the time of his death in 1803 only the Rotunda had been constructed. However, his son Frederick (later Marquess of Bristol) took over and completed his father's vision for Ickworth House eventually completing the wings and its gardens in 1830.Frederick Augustus Hervey, 4th Earl of Bristol and Bishop of Derry National Trust collection In 1799 the Howard de Walden barony by writ was called out of abeyance by the House of Lords Committee of Privileges in the 4th Earl of Bristol's favour. Thus he succeeded as 5th Baron Howard de Walden, a title which devolved upon him via his grandmother (Elizabeth, Countess of Bristol, the 1st earl's 2nd wife), who was daughter and heiress of Sir Thomas Felton and great-great granddaughter of Sir Thomas Howard, KG (created a baron 1597). Styled Bishop Hervey after his consecration on 31 May 1767, the following year he was translated as Lord Bishop of Derry, which became his formal ecclesiastical style until his death in 1803. Church career Hervey was ordained in 1754 as a Fellow of Corpus Christi College and then became Clerk of the Privy Seal in 1756 and Principal Clerk in 1761 before appointment as a Royal chaplain in 1763. The Hon. and Revd Frederick Hervey, as he was styled, then set off on an extended Grand Tour while awaiting ecclesiastical preferment. During his European travels he developed his already insatiable passion for art. His eldest brother, George, 2nd Earl of Bristol, became Lord Lieutenant of Ireland in 1766 and helped to secure his election as Bishop of Cloyne in 1767. Bishop Hervey displayed great enthusiasm for improving the property of the see of Cloyne which opened the way for his translation to the well endowed bishopric of Derry a year later. As Bishop of Derry, Hervey quickly developed a reputation for being \\"the most worldly, most eccentric, most talked-about priest in the Church of Ireland\\". Hervey was Derry's most generous philanthropist, although some of the clergy in his diocese came to regard their Lord Bishop as cheerfully sadistic, for such instances as when he instructed any portly priests coveting plum promotions to compete in midnight runs through bogs and marshland.\\"A Field Guide to the English Clergy' Butler-Gallie, F p35: London, Oneworld Publications, 2018 Given his family's wealth, Hervey both enjoyed personal luxury and expended large sums on building roads and developing agricultural enterprise within his diocese, including within the City of Derry. Lord Bristol was especially keen on architectural design and built splendid mansions at Downhill and Ballyscullion; he then took pleasure in filling them with sought-after works of art from Italy and elsewhere. Political activity Hervey favoured absolute religious equality, and opposed the feudal system of tithes. Having again passed some time in Italy, he returned to Ireland and in 1782 threw himself ardently into the Irish Volunteer Movement, quickly attaining a prominent position among the volunteers. With much pomp he arrived at an Irish nationalist convention held at Dublin in November 1783. Buoyed by his status and popularity Bishop Hervey let slip some scurrilous talk of rebellion which led the British government to contemplate his arrest. After this Lord Bristol took no further part in British politics, spending his later years mainly on the continent of Europe. In 1798 he was imprisoned by the French at Milan for suspected espionage and was held in custody for eighteen months. Upon his release, Lord Bristol headed for Rome. En route at Albano he needed overnight accommodation, which was offered by an Italian peasant by way of an outhouse; he and his wife were opposed to welcoming a Protestant into their house. The Lord Bishop died there outdoors at Albano. The earl's body was repatriated to England before being buried at Ickworth. Elected a Fellow of the Royal Society in 1782, the following year Lord Bristol received the Freedom of the City of Dublin as well as of Derry.  Personality Varying estimates have been found of his character. He was considered clever and cultured, but licentious and eccentric. He was a great collector of art and in later life he openly professed materialistic opinions. Lord Bristol fell in love with Wilhelmina, Countess von Lichtenau, King Frederick William II of Prussia's mistress, and by his bearing and often unusual and ostentatious style of dress he gave fresh point to Voltaire's original saying \\"when God created the human race, he made men, women and Herveys\\". During his European travels, and especially during his frequent visits to Rome, Lord Bristol was known to walk around wearing a broad-brimmed white hat, many gold chains and red breeches, in what was perceived as a possible attempt to upstage his Catholic rivals. As a bishop, Hervey was industrious and vigilant (despite his long absences from Ireland) albeit having once declared himself an agnostic. King George III, bemused by his behaviour, began referring to Bishop Hervey as \\"that wicked prelate\\"!Frederick Hervey (Bishop-Earl) Ricorso.net It is said that Lord Bristol's knowledge of fine things in Europe and love of travelling and staying in luxury inspired the fashion for naming an hotel the Hotel Bristol. The use of this name is meant to be synonymous with the finest accommodation and living throughout the Continent; the implication being that if Lord Bristol were in town, that is where he would stay. Family Elizabeth, Countess of Bristol. Portrait by Anton von Maron Lady Louisa Hervey, aged 11 The Hon. Frederick Hervey married, in 1752, Elizabeth (*1733-02-01; ‚Ä†1800-12-19), daughter of Sir Jermyn Davers Bt MP, a great-granddaughter of Thomas, 2nd Baron Jermyn, as well as being sister and heiress of Sir Charles Davers Bt MP (1737‚Äì1807). By their marriage, Lord Bristol had four sons and three daughters: * Lady Mary Caroline Hervey (1753‚Äì1842); married John Crichton, 1st Earl Erne, the couple later separating. * George (1755‚Äì1765); died of illness aged nine, at Spa, Belgium, while the family was travelling. * John \\"Jack\\" Augustus Hervey, Lord Hervey (1757‚Äì1796); Captain RN, married Elizabeth Drummond and predeceased his father, leaving issue one daughter (qv.

In 1782, after 30 years of marriage, Hervey and his wife separated. The two never saw each other again, although Hervey regularly corresponded with his children, including the youngest daughter Louisa, who lived with her mother. When the Bishop Lord Bristol died in 1803 in Lazio, Italy, his son Frederick succeeded as 5th Earl of Bristol as well as to the family estates including Ickworth House. The title of Baron Howard de Walden however passed to his great-grandson Charles Ellis, son of the 1st Baron Seaford, son of The Hon. Elizabeth Hervey (only child of Jack, Lord Hervey).

Early life and education  Smith was born in Norwich in 1759, the son of a wealthy wool merchant. He displayed a precocious interest in the natural world. During the early 1780s he enrolled in the medical course at the University of Edinburgh where he studied chemistry under Joseph Black and natural history under John Walker. He then moved to London in 1783 to continue his studies. Smith was a friend of Sir Joseph Banks, who was offered the entire collection of books, manuscripts and specimens of the Swedish natural historian and botanist Carl Linnaeus following the death of his son Carolus Linnaeus the Younger. Banks declined the purchase, but Smith bought the collection for the bargain price of ¬£1,000. The collection arrived in London in 1784, and in 1785 Smith was elected Fellow of the Royal Society.  Academic career  Between 1786 and 1788 Smith made the grand tour through the Netherlands, France, Italy and Switzerland visiting botanists, picture galleries and herbaria. He founded the Linnean Society of London in 1788, becoming its first President, a post he held until his death. He returned to live in Norwich in 1796 bringing with him the entire Linnean Collection. His library and botanical collections acquired European fame and were visited by numerous entomologists and botanists from the entire Continent. In 1792, he was elected a foreign member of the Royal Swedish Academy of Sciences. Smith spent the remaining thirty years of his life writing books and articles on botany. His books included Flora Britannica and The English Flora (4 volumes, 1824 ‚Äì 1828). He contributed 3,348 botanical articles to Rees's Cyclop√¶dia between 1808 and 1819, following the death of Rev. William Wood, who had started the work. In addition, he contributed 57 biographies of botanists. He contributed seven volumes to the major botanical publication of the eighteenth century, Flora Graeca, the publications begun by John Sibthorp. A fruitful collaboration was found through descriptions Smith supplied to publisher and illustrator, James Sowerby. Depiction of flora in England had previously only found patronage for aesthetic concerns, but an interest in gardening and natural history saw illustrated publications, such as the exotic A Specimen of the Botany of New Holland and the 36-volume English Botany, reaching new audiences. In 1797 Smith published The Natural History of the Rarer Lepidopterous Insects of Georgia, the earliest book on North American insects. It included the illustrations and notes of John Abbot, with descriptions of new species by Smith based on Abbot's drawings. Smith's friendship with William Roscoe (after whom he named the genus Roscoea) saw him contribute 5000 plants between 1806 and 1817 to supplement the Roylean Herbarium. This was to become the Smith Herbarium held by the Liverpool Botanic Garden.  Personal life and death  Smith died at his Norwich home in Surrey Street on March 17, 1828, aged 68. After his death the Linnean Collection, together with Smith's own collections, were bought by the Linnean Society for ¬£3,000. He was married to Pleasance Reeve, who survived her husband by 49 years and edited his memoirs and correspondence. They are buried together at St Margaret's, Lowestoft. His niece, Frances Catherine Barnard (1796‚Äì1869), was an author. Works *Icones pictae plantarum rariorum descriptionibus et observationibus illustratae.

It lies by Campbeltown Loch on the Kintyre peninsula. Originally known as Kinlochkilkerran (an anglicization of the Gaelic, which means \\"head of the loch by the kirk of Ciar√°n\\"), it was renamed in the 17th century as Campbell's Town after Archibald Campbell (Earl of Argyle) was granted the site in 1667.\\"Campbeltown\\" in A Dictionary of British Place-Names, A. D. Mills, Oxford University Press, 2003. Oxford Reference Online. Oxford University Press. University of Hull. 12 December 2009 Campbeltown became an important centre for Scotch whisky, and a busy fishing port. The 2018 population estimate was 4,600 indicating a reduction since the 2011 Census. Whisky Campbeltown is one of five areas in Scotland categorised as a distinct malt whisky producing region, and is home to the Campbeltown single malts. At one point it had over 30 distilleries and proclaimed itself \\"the whisky capital of the world\\". However, a focus on quantity rather than quality, and the combination of Prohibition and the Great Depression in the United States, led to most distilleries going out of business. Today only three active distilleries remain in Campbeltown: Glen Scotia, Glengyle, and Springbank. Campbeltown is a \\"protected locality\\" for Scotch Whisky distilling under the UK's Scotch Whisky Regulations 2009. The well known folk song titled Campbeltown Loch, I wish you were whisky is based on the town's history in this industry. Economy Main Street Campbeltown (2006) In addition to the benefits of distilling, and whisky tourism, there were two major employers in 2018, Campbeltown Creamery and CS Wind UK, who provided \\"a substantial portion of the Campbeltown area‚Äôs high skilled jobs and are a vital part of the local economy,\\" according to the Scottish government. A report in October 2019 had raised warning signs for the economy of Argyle & Bute; the report also suggested that up to 70 jobs at CS Wind UK could be lost but did not specify a time frame. Both companies confirmed the prediction of job redundancies, leading the Scottish government to hold an emergency Summit in November 2019 to discuss steps that might be taken for improving the local economy. Participants included Argyll & Bute Council, Highlands & Islands Enterprise, trades unions and local employers. After the Summit, a \\"working group\\" was formed in late November 2019. The Creamery was expected to close unless new investors were willing to take over. A plan by local farmers to do so failed in early December 2019. John Smith, NFU Scotland Dairy Chairman made this comment about the creamery's probable closure: \\"That is due to the harsh, economic reality of processing milk in an incredibly tough dairy industry that has witnessed so many casualties at both farm and processing level in recent times\\". By early December 2019, CS Wind UK had declared 22 jobs redundant. The Scottish government was working with the company to search for long-term solutions. Preliminary discussions did not produce optimism about the future stability of the company. The Unite union indicated that while CS Wind had been profitable, it was not receiving an adequate number of orders to sustain full employment. Culture The old Library and Museum Wee Picture House There are several listed buildings in Category A in the town and include the following. Campbeltown boasts a museum and a heritage centre. The museum has a varied collection of items from Campbeltown's past, and prehistoric items excavated from sites around Kintyre, such as axeheads, jewellery and combs. The 19th century building, by John James Burnet, also houses the Registrars office and Customer Service Point for Argyll and Bute council and has plaques or exhibits related to famous Kintyre people: for example, William McTaggart and William Mackinnon. Near the museum is the cinema known as the Wee Picture House, a small but distinctive Art Nouveau building of the Glasgow School dating from 1913 and believed to be the oldest surviving purpose-built cinema in Scotland. These buildings are on the waterfront, as is a 14th-century Celtic cross that also served as a mercat cross. St Kieran (Ciar√°n of Clonmacnoise) lived in this area before the town existed. A cave named after him can be visited at low tide, as can the cave on nearby Island Davaar where pilgrims and tourists go to see a 19th-century crucifixion painting. Campbeltown also hosts the annual Mull Of Kintyre Music Festival, which has seen acts ranging from up-and-coming local bands to well-established groups such as Deacon Blue, The Stranglers and Idlewild perform. A recent addition has been the Kintyre Songwriters Festival, a fairly low key annual gathering aimed at promoting the wealth and variety of original music across the area. The festival is held during the last weekend of May and is open to anyone interested in performing. On Friday 16 June 2006, First Minister Jack McConnell flew to Campbeltown to officially open Campbeltown's new 'Aqualibrium' Centre. Aqualibrium, designed by Page\\\\Park Architects, replaced the old Campbeltown swimming pool, which was previously closed due to safety concerns; the centre houses Campbeltown's library (with the old building being the museum only), swimming pool, gym, conference centre and 'Mussel Ebb' Cafe. The Kintyre Camanachd are a local shinty team that belongs to the Camanachd Association. The local amateur football team, Campbeltown Pupils AFC, are members of the Scottish Amateur Football League which largely comprises clubs based in the Greater Glasgow and Inverclyde areas, requiring the Campbeltown team to make a round trip of over for away fixtures most weekends.Join Campbeltown Pupils AFC as they make a 260 mile trip just for a game of football, A View from the Terrace (BBC Scotland), 28 February 2020 Argyll FM is a local radio station based in Campbeltown on 106.5, 107.1 and 107.7 In May 2012 Campbeltown and Dunoon were jointly named in a report by the Scottish Agricultural College as the rural places in Scotland most vulnerable to a downturn. The \\"vulnerability index\\" ranked 90 Scottish locations according to factors associated with economic and social change. Transport Campbeltown Airport is near the town, and has a scheduled service to/from Glasgow International Airport on weekdays and some summer Sundays. The town is the westernmost town in the island of Great Britain (if the port of Mallaig is not counted as a town). It has the population of a large village, but lays claim to its town status based on its port and its central close grid of streets. Its position near the end of a long peninsula makes for a time-consuming road journey, and to some extent the area relies on sea and air transport, like the Inner Hebrides. However it is linked to the rest of Scotland by the A83 (to Tarbet) and A82 (from Tarbet to Glasgow). Bus service is provided by West Coast Motors. Davaar Island at the mouth of Campbeltown Loch Ferries sail from Campbeltown to Ballycastle in Northern Ireland, operated by Kintyre Express. An earlier service had been suspended in June 2002; the new service, which runs to Ballycastle every Friday to Monday during summer months and on Mondays and Fridays during the winter months, commenced in 2011. In 2006 a foot passenger ferry operated by Kintyre Express ran between Campbeltown and Troon every Monday, Wednesday and Friday with a crossing time of one hour in calm weather. By 2007 this ferry no longer ran, although the vessel can be chartered privately. Starting 23 May 2013, Caledonian MacBrayne began operating a pilot ferry service across the Firth of Clyde to Ardrossan calling at Brodick on Saturdays. Campbeltown was linked to Machrihanish by a canal (1794 ‚Äì mid-1880s) that was superseded by the Campbeltown and Machrihanish Light Railway, which closed in 1932. The railway, which was originally built to serve the Machrihanish Coalfield, ran from Campbeltown railway station to Machrihanish railway station. Language Campbeltown is one of the few communities in the Scottish Highlands where the Scots language predominated in recent centuries, rather than the previously widespread Scottish Gaelic, an enclave of Lowland Scots speech surrounded by Highland Scottish speech. This was due to the plantation of lowland merchants in the burgh in the 17th century. The dominant position that Lowland Scots had in the town has today been taken by the English language, in the form of the Scottish English dialect.

The locality has an estimated population of 1,630 (in 2018). Etymology The name Crail was recorded in 1148 as Cherel and in 1153 as Karel. The first element is the Pictish *cair (c.f. Welsh caer) meaning \\"fort\\", though this word seems to have been borrowed into Gaelic. The second element may be either Gaelic ail, \\"rocks\\", or more problematically Pictish *al; no certain instance of this word exists in P-Celtic. However, if the generic element were Pictish, then this is likely of the specific. History The site on which the parish church is built appears to have religious associations that pre-date the parish church's foundation in early mediaeval times, as evidenced by an 8th century cross-slab preserved in the church. The parish church was itself dedicated (in the 13th-century) to the early holy man St. Maelrubha of Applecross in Wester Ross. Crail became a Royal Burgh in 1178 in the reign of King William the Lion.Scottish Seaside Towns, by Brian Edwards Robert the Bruce granted permission to hold markets on a Sunday. Mary of Guise, afterwards consort of James V, landed in Crail in June 1538 after a severe storm, and was hospitably entertained in the ancient mansion of Balcomie Castle, whence, accompanied by the king, she proceeded to St. Andrew's. John Knox, visiting Crail on his way to St Andrews in 1559, was moved to deliver a sermon in Crail Parish Church. Afterwards protesters went through the church and forcefully removed images which were put in place by previous generations but were now considered ideologically unsound. In August 1583 many of the inhabitants of Crail attacked nearby Wormiston House, which belonged to Sir John Anstruther. They filled up newly made ponds and ditches, and destroyed a plantation of ash trees. They were angry at Sir John because his new ditches had been built on land they claimed to belong to them as common land. The Privy Council of Scotland ordered them to rebuild the dykes. In 2017 The Community Council was granted the Letters Patent to the Crail Shield and Coat of Arms. This was lost when the Royal Burgh of Crail Council was abolished in 1976. Architecture Crail Tolbooth (on the left) Built around a harbour, Crail has a particular wealth of vernacular buildings from the 17th to early 19th centuries, many restored by the National Trust for Scotland, and is a favourite subject for artists. The most notable building in the town is the parish church, situated in the Marketgate - from the mid 13th century St Maelrubha's, in later medieval times St Mary's, but now, as part of the Church of Scotland's ministry, known just as Crail Parish Church. It was founded in the second half of the 12th century. From early in its history it belonged to the Cistercian Nunnery of St Clare in Haddington and remained the Nunnery's possession until the Reformation. Though much altered, this is one of Scotland's most beautiful ancient churches. According to Crail Parish Church's website (see external link below) in its first form the church building consisted of an unaisled rectangular nave and chancel of romanesque design. In the early 13th century a fine western tower with small spire was added, and a double arcade of round pillars of variegated red sandstone in the nave. It was in this form in 1243 that the church was dedicated to St Maelrubha by the Bishop of St Andrews. (In later times it was known as St Mary's probably after a later dedication in a later period that disliked vestiges of the Celtic Church.) The side walls were rebuilt in Regency times, and the large pointed windows, filled with panes of clear glass held by astragals rather than leads, allow light to flood into the interior. The unaisled chancel, now housing a huge organ, has been shortened. The church retains some 17th-century woodwork. The early Christian cross-slab mentioned at the start of this article is on display in the church: it is of unusual form (perhaps 10th century), formerly set in the floor. The church building is open on some afternoons in the summer. The large Kirkyard surrounding the building has a fine collection of monuments and stones dating from the late 16th century onwards and an unusual ornamented morthouse is present, once used to frustrate the activities of bodysnatchers. Other historic buildings in Crail include the doo'cot (Scots for dovecot) of the town's otherwise vanished Franciscan Friary. Crail once had a royal castle above the harbour (perhaps this was the site of the 'fort'). The site is still visible as an open garden attached, but little or nothing of the structure survives above ground. A Victorian 'turret' jutting out from the garden wall recalls the Castle (visible in the photograph reproduced above, in the infobox). The Tolbooth is near the juncture of Tolbooth Wynd and the Marketgate. It stands on its own at the edge of the large marketplace with its mercat cross in the centre of the town - this is where the Sunday markets were once held. (The former marketplace is now used as a car park.) The Tolbooth has a characteristic tower dating from about 1600 and a European style roof, similar to buildings in Holland. The weathervane on the spire is in the form of a smoked haddock (known locally as a Crail Capon) rather than the traditional cockerel form.Scottish Seaside Towns, by Brian Edwards The curved roof form on the tower evidences the European influence of the 16th century, and is architecturally described as a Dutch spire (several other contemporary examples exist in Scotland). The bell inside was cast in Holland and bears the date 1520, and is a permanent reminder of the town‚Äôs trading links with the Dutch. The Crail Museum and Heritage Centre, largely staffed by volunteers and open every day in summer, is sited in a neighbouring building, also of historical interest, at the top of Tolbooth Wynd. (See external link below.) It houses temporary exhibitions and has a permanent exhibition on HMS Jackdaw. On permanent display in the Burgh Room is the ceremonial robe worn by the provost of the Burgh of Crail before the reorganisation of local government in Scotland in 1975. (Before 1975 each Scottish burgh was governed by a town council headed by a provost.) Entry to Crail Museum is free but donations are accepted. On Sunday afternoons in summer the museum is the leaving point for guided tours of Crail, led by volunteer guides. The Customs House on the Shoregate dates from the 17th century. The harbour is known to have been substantially complete by 1583. The extension of 1828 to the west pier of Crail Harbour is the work of Robert Stevenson.Scottish Seaside Towns, by Brian Edwards Notable residents *Joan Clarke, cryptanalyst and former fianc√©e of Alan Turing *William Dickson, footballer (1866-1910) *Andrew Duncan minister exiled for opposing the policies of James VI *James Oswald (composer) (1710-1769) *Oswald Wynd, Author (1913‚Äì1998) Carboniferous fossils On the beach beside the harbour, there are fossilised trees related to Horsetails, dating back to the Carboniferous geological period.

Like the more common soprano B clarinet, it is usually pitched in B (meaning it is a transposing instrument on which a written C sounds as B), but it plays notes an octave below the soprano B clarinet. Bass clarinets in other keys, notably C and A, also exist, but are very rare (in contrast to the regular A clarinet, which is quite common in classical music). Bass clarinets regularly perform in orchestras, wind ensembles/concert bands, occasionally in marching bands, and play an occasional solo role in contemporary music and jazz in particular. Someone who plays a bass clarinet is called a bass clarinetist. Description Most modern bass clarinets are straight-bodied, with a small upturned silver-colored metal bell and curved metal neck. Early examples varied in shape, some having a doubled body making them look similar to bassoons. The bass clarinet is fairly heavy and is supported either with a neck strap or an adjustable peg attached to its body. While Adolphe Sax imitated its upturned metal bell in his design of the larger saxophones, the two instruments are fundamentally different. Bass clarinet bodies are most often made of grenadilla (African Blackwood) or (more commonly for student- instruments) plastic resin, while saxophones are typically made of metal. (Metal bass clarinets exist, but are rare.) More significantly, all clarinets have a bore that is basically the same diameter along the body. This cylindrical bore differs from the saxophone's conical one and gives the clarinet its characteristic tone, causing it to overblow at the twelfth compared with the saxophone's octave. A majority of modern bass clarinets, like other clarinets in the family, have the Boehm system of keys and fingering. However, bass clarinets are also manufactured in Germany with the Oehler system of keywork, which is most often known as the 'German\\" system in the US, because it is commonly used in Germany and Austria, as well as Eastern Europe and Turkey; bass clarinets produced with the Oehler system's predecessor, the Albert system, are still in use, particularly in these areas. Leblanc L400, Signet Selmer 1430P, E. M. Winston, Leblanc 330S Most modern Boehm system bass clarinets have an \\"extension\\" key allowing them to play to the (written) E. This key was originally added to allow easy transposition of parts for the relatively rare bass clarinet pitched in A, but it now finds significant use in concert band and other literature. A significant difference between soprano and bass clarinet key work is a key pad played by the left- hand index finger with a vent that may be uncovered for certain high notes. This allows a form of \\"half-hole\\" fingering that allows notes in higher registers to be played on the instrument. In addition, older bass clarinets have two register keys, one for middle D and below, the other for middle E and higher. Newer models typically have an automatic register key mechanism, where a single left thumb key commands the two vent holes. Depending on whether the right hand ring finger (used in fingerings for middle D and below) is down or up, the lower or upper vent hole will open. Many professional or advanced bass clarinet models extend down to a low C (sounding B, identical to the bassoon's lowest B), two octaves below written middle C. At concert pitch this note is the B below the second ledger line below the bass staff or B1 in scientific pitch notation. These three lowermost half-steps are played via additional keys operated by the right thumb, some of them often duplicated in the left- or right-hand little-finger key clusters. Overall, the instrument sounds an octave lower than the B soprano clarinet. As with all wind instruments, the upper limit of the range depends on the quality of the instrument and skill of the clarinetist. According to Aber and Lerstad, who give fingerings up to written C7 (sounding B5), the highest note commonly encountered in modern solo literature is the E below that (sounding D5, the D above treble C). This gives the bass clarinet a usable range of up to four octaves, quite close to the range of the bassoon; indeed, many bass clarinetists perform works originally intended for bassoon or cello because of the plethora of literature for those two instruments and the scarcity of solo works for the bass clarinet. Uses The bass clarinet has been regularly used in scoring for orchestra and concert band since the mid-19th century, becoming more common during the middle and latter part of the 20th century. A bass clarinet is not always called for in orchestra music, but is almost always called for in concert band music. In recent years, the bass clarinet has also seen a growing repertoire of solo literature including compositions for the instrument alone, or accompanied by piano, orchestra, or other ensemble. It is also used in clarinet choirs, marching bands, and in film scoring, and has played a persistent role in jazz. The bass clarinet has an appealing, rich, earthy tone quite distinct from other instruments in its range, drawing on and enhancing the qualities of the lower range of the soprano and alto instrument. =Musical compositions= Perhaps the earliest solo passages for bass clarinet‚Äîindeed, among the earliest parts for the instrument‚Äîoccur in Mercadante's 1834 opera Emma d'Antiochia, in which a lengthy solo introduces Emma's scene in Act 2. (Mercadante actually specified a glicibarifono for this part.) Two years later, Giacomo Meyerbeer wrote an important solo for bass clarinet in Act 4 of his opera Les Huguenots. French composer Hector Berlioz was one of the first of the Romantics to use the bass clarinet in his large-scale works such as the Grande symphonie fun√®bre et triomphale, Op. 15 (1840), the Te Deum, Op. 22 (1849), and the opera Les Troyens, Op. 29 (1863). Later French composers to use the instrument included Maurice Ravel, who wrote virtuosic parts for the bass clarinet in his ballet Daphnis et Chlo√© (1912), La valse (1920), and his orchestration of Modest Mussorgsky's Pictures at an Exhibition (1924). The operas of Richard Wagner also make extensive use of the bass clarinet, beginning with Tannh√§user (1845). He incorporated the instrument fully into the wind section as both a solo and supporting instrument. Wagner pioneered in exploiting the instrument's dark, somber tone to represent sadness and melancholy. Wagner was almost completely responsible for making the instrument a permanent member of the opera orchestra. The instrument plays an extensive role in Tristan und Isolde (1859), the operas of Der Ring des Nibelungen (1876), and Parsifal (1882). Also around this time, Hungarian pianist and composer Franz Liszt wrote important parts for the instrument in his symphonic poems Ce qu'on entend sur la montagne (What One Hears on the Mountain), Tasso, and his Dante Symphony. Giuseppe Verdi followed suit, using it in Aida (1870), La forza del destino, Don Carlo and Falstaff. Following in Verdi's footsteps, Giacomo Puccini, composer of La Boh√®me, Tosca and Madame Butterfly, used the bass clarinet in all of his operas, beginning with Edgar in 1889. The Russian composer Pyotr Ilyich Tchaikovsky wrote some prominent solos for the instrument in his last ballet, The Nutcracker. The later Romantics used the bass clarinet frequently in their works. All of Gustav Mahler's symphonies include the instrument prominently, and often contain lengthy solos for the instrument, especially in his Symphony No. 6 in A minor. Richard Strauss wrote for the instrument in all of his symphonic poems except for Don Juan, and the instrument shared the spotlight with the tenor tuba in his 1898 tone poem, Don Quixote, Op. 35. Strauss wrote for the instrument as he did for the smaller clarinets, and the parts often include playing in very high registers, such as in Also Sprach Zarathustra, Op. 30. Composers of the Second Viennese School, Arnold Schoenberg, Anton Webern and Alban Berg, often favored the instrument over the bassoon, the instrument's closest relative in terms of range. Russian composers Dmitri Shostakovich and Sergei Prokofiev used the low concert C and B (equivalent to the bassoon's lowest two notes) in many of their compositions and an instrument with the extended range is necessary for works such as Shostakovich's Symphonies Nos. 4, 7, 8, and 11, and Leo≈° Jan√°ƒçek's Sinfonietta. All of these works exploit the instrument's dark, powerful lower range. Prokofiev wrote parts for the instrument in his Symphonies Nos. 2‚Äì7 and in his ballet Romeo and Juliet. Sergei Rachmaninoff used the instrument to great effect in his Symphonies Nos. 2 and 3 and in his symphonic poem, Isle of The Dead. Igor Stravinsky also wrote complex parts for the instrument throughout his career, most prominently in his ballets The Firebird (1910), Petrushka (1911) and The Rite of Spring (1913). The bass clarinet has a solo at the opening of the third movement of Ferde Grof√©'s Grand Canyon Suite. In the duet \\"A Boy Like That\\" from West Side Story (1957), Leonard Bernstein scored for \\"the inky sounds of three bass clarinets\\". Early minimalist Steve Reich's Music for 18 Musicians (1976) calls for two bass clarinets, featured prominently in the lower register. Used almost percussively, the effect of deep, staccato repetitions, played beneath a static rhythmic drone, is to create a feeling of slowly fluctuating cycles. Many modern composers employ the bass along with the contra-alto and contrabass clarinets, such as Esa- Pekka Salonen in his Piano Concerto. A great amount of literature can be found in the wind ensemble, in which there is always a part for the instrument. There are a few major solo pieces for bass clarinet, including: *Kalevi Aho Concerto for Bass Clarinet and Orchestra (2018) *Ann Callaway Concerto for Bass Clarinet and Chamber Orchestra (1985‚Äì87) (Subito Music) *Anders Eliasson Concerto for Bass Clarinet and Orchestra (1996) *Peter Maxwell Davies: The Seas of Kirk Swarf for bass clarinet and strings (2007). *Osvaldo Golijov: Dreams and Prayers of Isaac the Blind for Klezmer clarinetist (soprano clarinets, bass clarinet and/or basset horn) and string quartet, later arranged for solo clarinetist and string orchestra. *Rafael Leonardo Junchaya: Concerto Silvestre for bass clarinet and orchestra Op.14a.

The pioneer was the Czech performer Josef Hor√°k (1931‚Äì2005), who is credited as having performed the first ever solo bass clarinet recital on March 23, 1955. This marked a turning point when the instrument first became thought of as a soloist's instrument. Because the repertoire of solo music for the bass clarinet was quite small, most bass clarinet soloists specialize in new music, while also arranging works composed for other instruments from earlier eras (such as the Bach Cello Suites). Beginning with Hor√°k, many players have commissioned works for the instrument, and consequently there now exists a repertoire of hundreds of solo works, many by prominent international composers such as Brian Ferneyhough and David Lang. In addition to Hor√°k, other specialist performers include Henri Bok (Netherlands), his student Lu√≠s Afonso (Brazil), Dennis Smylie (United States), Tommie Lundberg (Sweden), Harry Sparnaay (Netherlands, who has worked with important composers such as Luciano Berio, Iannis Xenakis, and Morton Feldman), Jason Alder, Evan Ziporyn (United States), and Michael Lowenstern (United States); the latter two are also composers. In October 2005, the First World Bass Clarinet Convention was held in Rotterdam, Netherlands, at which Hor√°k was the guest of honor and played in one of the many concerts given by the leading bass clarinetists from around the world (including all the aforementioned performers, as well as many others). At least two professional bass-clarinet quartets exist. Rocco Parisi's Bass Clarinet Quartet is an Italian group whose repertoire includes transcriptions of music by Rossini, Paganini, and Piazzolla. Edmund Welles is the name of a bass clarinet quartet based in San Francisco. Their repertoire includes original \\"heavy chamber music\\" and transcriptions of madrigals, boogie-woogie tunes, and heavy metal songs. Two of the members of Edmund Welles also perform as a bass clarinet duo, Sqwonk. =In jazz= While the bass clarinet was seldom heard in early jazz compositions, a bass clarinet solo by Wilbur Sweatman can be heard on his 1924 recording \\"Battleship Kate\\" and a bass clarinet solo by Omer Simeon can be heard in the 1926 recording \\"Someday Sweetheart\\" by Jelly Roll Morton and His Red Hot Peppers. Additionally, Benny Goodman recorded with the instrument a few times early in his career. Harry Carney, Duke Ellington's baritone saxophonist for 47 years, played bass clarinet in some of Ellington's arrangements, first recording with it on \\"Saddest Tale\\" in 1934. He was featured soloist on many Ellington recordings, including 27 titles on bass clarinet. The first jazz album on which the leader solely played bass clarinet was Great Ideas of Western Mann (1957) by Herbie Mann, better known as a flautist. However, avant-garde musician Eric Dolphy (1928‚Äì1964) was the first major jazz soloist on the instrument, and established much of the vocabulary and technique used by later performers. He used the entire range of the instrument in his solos. Bennie Maupin emerged in the late 1960s as a primary player of the instrument, playing on Miles Davis's seminal record Bitches Brew as well as several records with Herbie Hancock's Mwandishi group. His style resembles Dolphy's in its use of advanced harmonies. While the bass clarinet has been used often since Dolphy, it is typically used by a saxophonist or clarinetist as a second or third instrument; such musicians include David Murray, Marcus Miller, John Surman, John Gilmore, Bob Mintzer, John Coltrane (to whom Dolphy's mother left some of Dolphy's instruments including his bass clarinet), Brian Landrus, James Carter, Steve Buckley, Andy Biskin, Don Byron, Julian Siegel, Gunter Hampel, Michel Portal, and Chris Potter. Very few performers have used the instrument exclusively, but such performers include Berlin-based bass clarinetist Rudi Mahall, and French bass clarinetists Louis Sclavis and Denis Colin. Klezmer clarinetist Giora Feidman is known for idiosyncratic use of the bass clarinet on some klezmer and jazz tunes. History Glicibarifono by Catterini, 1838 The serpentine bass clarinet by Papalini, 1820 There are several instruments that can arguably be considered the first bass clarinet. Probably the earliest is a dulcian-shaped instrument in the Museum Carolino Augusteum in Salzburg. It is incomplete, lacking a crook or mouthpiece, and appears to date from the first half of the eighteenth century. Its wide cylindrical bore and its fingering suggest it was a chalumeau or clarinet in the bass range. Four anonymous bass chalumeaux or clarinets apparently dating from the eighteenth century and having from one to six keys also appear to be among the earliest examples, and one in particular has been suggested to date from before 1750. However, the authenticity of at least one of these instruments has been questioned. In the Munich Stadtmuseum there is an instrument made c. 1770 by the Mayrhofers of Passau, who are often credited with the invention of the basset horn. It resembles early sickle- shaped basset horns, but has a larger bore and is longer, playing in low B. Whether this should be considered a low basset horn or a bass clarinet is a matter of opinion. In any case, no further work along this line is known to have been done. A 1772 newspaper article describes an instrument called the \\"basse-tube,\\" invented by G. Lott in Paris in 1772. This instrument has not survived and very little is known of it. The article has frequently been cited as the earliest record of a bass clarinet, but it has more recently been suggested that the basse-tube was in fact a basset horn. The Klarinetten-Bass by Heinrich Grenser, c. 1793, had a folded, bassoon-like shape and an extended range, and was presumably intended to serve as a bassoon replacement in military bands. Desfontenelles of Lisieux built a bass clarinet in 1807 whose shape was similar to that of the later saxophone. It had thirteen keys, at a time when most soprano clarinets had fewer. Additional designs were developed by many other makers, including Dumas of Sommi√®res (who called his instrument a \\"Basse guerri√®re\\") in 1807; Nicola Papalini, c. 1810 (an odd design, in the form of a serpentine series of curves, carved out of wood); George Catlin of Hartford, Connecticut (\\"clarion\\") c. 1810; Sautermeister of Lyons (\\"Basse- orgue\\") in 1812; Gottlieb Streitwolf in 1828; and Catterino Catterini (\\"glicibarifono\\") in the 1830s. These last four, and several others of the same period, had bassoon-like folded shapes, and most had extended ranges. A straight-bodied instrument without extended range was produced in 1832 by Isaac Dacosta and Auguste Buffet. Finally, Adolphe Sax, a Belgian manufacturer of musical instruments, designed a straight-bodied form of the bass clarinet in 1838. Sax's expertise in acoustics led him to include such features as accurately-placed, large tone holes and a second register hole. His instrument achieved great success and became the basis for all bass clarinet designs since. The instrument on which Anton Stadler first played Mozart's clarinet concerto was originally called a Bass-Klarinette, but was not a bass clarinet in the modern sense; since the late eighteenth century this instrument has been called a basset clarinet. Notation Orchestral music for bass clarinet is written using one of four systems: Music is occasionally encountered written for the bass clarinet in A, e.g. in Wagner operas, and Mahler or Rachmaninov symphonies; this music also tends to be written in bass clef although not invariably (e.g. Ravel's La Valse). Apparently, bass clarinets in A were once produced by German and French makers, even though the historic record is not particularly clear just where and when such production started and ceased. Since instruments pitched in A were not available to play music that had already been written, bass clarinets produced after 1900 were equipped with the low E extension key to allow easy transposition of such parts. Until the last half of the 20th century, no new bass clarinets pitched in A were produced. For a brief period starting in the late 1970s, a bass clarinet with Boehm style keywork and pitched in A (and keyed to low E, even though the original parts seldom descend below written low E) was again produced by Selmer Paris. While perfectly functional, such instruments were both expensive and a significant physical burden to the player, who would have to carry two heavy bass clarinets to rehearsals and performances. For these two reasons more than anything else, few modern bass clarinets in A have been sold. At some point after the 1980s, Selmer ceased production of the bass clarinet in A, although examples are still available from factory stock. Very few modern players own a bass clarinet in A; these parts are therefore played on the B instrument, transposing them down a semitone.

He supported the Royalist side in the English Civil War, but his ambition and instability of character caused serious problems to himself and both Kings he served. Early life Digby was baptized in Madrid, the eldest known son of John Digby, 1st Earl of Bristol, who for many years was the English Ambassador to Spain, and his wife Beatrice Walcott.Ronald Hutton, ‚ÄòDigby, George, second earl of Bristol (1612‚Äì1677)‚Äô, Oxford Dictionary of National Biography, Oxford University Press, 2004; online edn, May 2009. He is presumed to have been born there shortly before. At the age of twelve, he appeared at the bar of the House of Commons and pleaded for his father who was then imprisoned in the Tower of London. His youth, graceful person and well- delivered speech then made a great impression. He was admitted to Magdalen College, Oxford, on 15 August 1626, 'Alumni Oxonienses, 1500-1714: Dabbe- Dirkin', Alumni Oxonienses 1500-1714: Abannan-Kyte (1891), pp. 366-405. Date accessed: 11 June 2011 where he was a favorite pupil of Peter Heylin. He spent the following years in study and in travel, from which he returned, according to George Villiers, 4th Earl of Clarendon, \\"the most accomplished person of our nation or perhaps any other nation, and distinguished by a remarkably handsome person\\". In June 1634 Digby was committed to the Fleet Prison till July for striking Crofts, a gentleman of the court, in Spring Gardens, and possibly his severe treatment and the disfavour shown to his father were the causes of his hostility to the court. He became MA in 1636. In 1638 and 1639 were written the Letters between Lord George Digby and Sir Kenelm Digby, Knt. concerning Religion (published in 1651), in which Digby attacked Roman Catholicism. Politics and the Civil War In April 1640, Digby was elected Member of Parliament for Dorset in the Short Parliament. He was re-elected MP for Dorset for the Long Parliament in November 1640. In conjunction with John Pym and John Hampden he took an active part in the opposition to Charles I of England. He moved on 9 November for a committee to consider the deplorable state of the kingdom, and on 11 November was included in the committee for the impeachment of Thomas Wentworth, 1st Earl of Strafford, against whom he at first showed great zeal. However, after the failure of the impeachment, he opposed the attainder of Strafford, and made an eloquent speech on 21 April 1641, accentuating the weakness of Henry Vane's evidence against the prisoner, and showing the injustice of ex post facto legislation, in condemning a man for acts which were not treason when they were committed. He was regarded in consequence with great hostility by the parliamentary party, and was accused of having stolen from Pym's table Vane's notes on which the prosecution mainly depended. On 15 July his speech was burnt by the public hangman by the order of the House of Commons. On 8 February he made an important speech in the Commons advocating the reformation and opposing the abolition of episcopacy. On 8 June, during the angry discussion on the army plot, he narrowly escaped assault in the House, and the following day, in order to save him from further attacks, Charles I of England called him up to the House of Lords by writ of acceleration in his father's Barony of Digby. King Charles mistakenly followed Digby's advice in preference to such men as Edward Hyde, 1st Earl of Clarendon and Lucius Cary, 2nd Viscount Falkland. In November 1641 Digby was recorded as performing \\"singular good service,\\" and \\"doing beyond admiration,\\" in speaking in the Lords against the instruction concerning evil counsellors. He suggested to Charles the impeachment of the five members, and urged upon him the fatal attempt to arrest them on 4 January 1642. He failed to play his part in the Lords in securing the arrest of Lord Mandeville, to whom on the contrary he declared that the king was very mischievously advised, and according to Edward Hyde, 1st Earl of Clarendon his imprudence was responsible for the betrayal of the king's plan. On the next day Digby advised the attempt to seize the five members in the city by force. In the same month Digby was ordered to appear in the Lords to answer a charge of high treason for a supposed armed attempt at Hull, but fled to the Dutch Republic, where he joined Queen consort Henrietta Maria of France, and on 26 February was impeached. Subsequently he visited Charles at York disguised as a Frenchman, but on the return voyage to the Dutch Republic he was captured and taken to Hull. For some time he escaped detection, but at last after revealing his identity, he cajoled Sir John Hotham into letting him escape. Later on a second visit to Hull he tried unsuccessfully to persuade Hotham to surrender York to the King. He was present at the Battle of Edgehill, and was wounded while leading the assault at Lichfield. After a quarrel with Prince Rupert of the Rhine, he threw down his commission and returned to the King at Oxford, over whom he obtained more influence as the prospect became more gloomy. On 28 September 1643 he was appointed secretary of state and a privy councillor, and on 31 October high steward of Oxford University. He now supported Henrietta Maria's policy of foreign alliances and use of help from Ireland, and took part in several imprudent and ill-conducted negotiations which damaged the king's affairs. His fierce disputes with Prince Rupert. and his party caused further embarrassment. On 14 October 1645 he was made lieutenant general of the royal forces north of the River Trent. The intention was to push through to join James Graham, 1st Marquess of Montrose, but he was defeated on 15 October at Sherburn, where his correspondence was captured. This correspondence revealed the king's expectations from abroad and from Ireland and his intrigues with the Scots. Digby reached Dumfries, but finding his way barred, escaped on 24 October to the Isle of Man. He then crossed to Ireland, where he caused Edward Somerset, 2nd Marquess of Worcester, who had been sent to negotiate with the Irish Confederacy, to be arrested. In Ireland, he believed he was going to achieve wonders. \\"Have I not carried my body swimmingly,\\" he wrote to Hyde in irrepressible good spirits, \\"who being before so irreconcilably hated by the Puritan party, have thus seasonably made myself as odious to the Papists?\\" Clarendon State Papers,  Exile  Digby's plan was to bring over Charles, Prince of Wales, to head a royalist movement in the island. When he joined Charles at Jersey in April 1646, he intended to entrap him on board, but was dissuaded by Hyde. Digby then travelled to Paris to gain Henrietta Maria of France's consent to his scheme, but returned to persuade Charles to go to Paris, and accompanied him thither. He revisited Ireland on 29 June once more, and on the surrender of the island to Parliament escaped again to France . At Paris amongst the Royalists he found himself in a nest of enemies eager to pay off old scores. Prince Rupert challenged him, and he fought a duel with Lord Wilmot. He continued his adventures by serving in Louis XIV of France's troops in the war of the Fronde, in which he greatly distinguished himself. He was appointed in 1651 lieutenant-general in the French army, and commander of the forces in Flanders. These new honours, however, were soon lost. During Cardinal Mazarin's enforced absence from the court Digby aspired to become his successor. However, when the Cardinal was restored to power, he sent Digby away on an expedition in Italy, having penetrated his character and regarded him as a mere adventurer.M√©moires du Cardinal de Retz (2859), app. When Digby returned to France he was told that he was included in the list of those expelled from France, in accordance with the new treaty with Oliver Cromwell. In August 1656 he joined Charles II at Bruges, and wanting revenge on the cardinal, offered his services to John of Austria the Younger in the Southern Netherlands. He was instrumental in effecting the surrender of the garrison of St. Ghislain to Spain in 1657. On 1 January 1657 he was appointed by Charles II secretary of state, but shortly afterwards, he was compelled to resign office as he had become a Roman Catholic ‚Äî probably with the view of adapting himself better to his new Spanish friends. Charles took him with him to Spain in 1659 on account of his \\"jollity \\" and Spanish experience. Although he was unwelcome to the Spanish, he succeeded in ingratiating himself, and was later welcomed by Philip IV of Spain at Madrid. Digby succeeded to the peerage as 2nd Earl of Bristol on the death of his father in January 1659 and was made K.G. the same month.  Restoration  As Lord Bristol, he returned to the Kingdom of England at the English Restoration, when he found himself excluded from office on account of his religion, and relegated to only secondary importance. He tried to make an impression through restless and ambitious activity in parliament and he was violently hostile to Clarendon. In foreign affairs he inclined strongly to the side of Spain, and opposed the king's marriage with Catherine of Portugal. He persuaded Charles to despatch him to Italy to view the Medici princesses, but the royal marriage and treaty with Portugal were settled in his absence. In June 1663 Bristol tried to upset Clarendon's management of the House of Commons, but his intrigue was exposed to the parliament by Charles, and he had to attend the House of Lords to exonerate himself. When he confessed that he had \\"taken the liberty of enlarging,\\" his \\"comedian-like\\"Pepys Diaries, entry for Wednesday 1 July 1663 speech excited general amusement. In July, he broke out into fierce and disrespectful reproaches to the King, ending with a threat that unless Charles granted his requests within twenty-four hours \\"he would do somewhat that should awaken him out of his slumbers, and make him look better to his own business.\\" Accordingly, on 10 July he impeached Clarendon in the Lords of high treason. When the charge was dismissed he renewed his accusation, and was expelled from the court, and only avoided the warrant issued for his apprehension by hiding for two years. In January 1664 Bristol appeared at his house at Wimbledon, and publicly renounced before witnesses his Roman Catholicism and declared himself a Protestant, His motive was probably to secure immunity from the charge of recusancy preferred against him.437, 442. When, however, the fall of Clarendon was desired, Bristol was again welcomed at court. He took his seat in the Lords on 29 July 1667. \\"The king,\\" wrote Samuel Pepys in November, \\" who not long ago did say of Bristol that he was a man able in three years to get himself a fortune in any kingdom in the world and lose all again in three months, do now hug him and commend his parts everywhere above all the world.\\"Pepys Diaries IV. 19 He pressed eagerly for Clarendon's committal, and on the refusal of the Lords accused them of mutiny and rebellion, and entered his dissent with \\"great fury.\\" In March, 1668 Bristol attended prayers in the Lords. On 15 March 1673 though still ostensibly a Roman Catholic, he spoke in favour of the Test Act, describing himself as \\"a Catholic of the Church of Rome, not a Catholic of the Court of Rome,\\" and asserting the unfitness of Romanists for public office. His adventurous and erratic career was closed by his death on 20 March 1677. Character Portrait of George Digby in 1637 with William Russell, 1st Duke of Bedford, by Sir Anthony Van Dyck. Althorp, Northamptonshire. Bristol was one of the most striking and conspicuous figures of his time, a man of brilliant abilities, a great orator, one who distinguished himself without effort in any sphere of activity he chose to enter, but whose natural gifts were marred by a restless ambition and instability of character fatal to real greatness. Clarendon describes him as \\"the only man I ever knew of such incomparable parts that was none the wiser for any experience or misfortune that befell him,\\" and records his extraordinary facility in making friends and making enemies. Horace Walpole characterized him in a series of his smartest antitheses as \\"a singular person whose life was one contradiction.\\" \\"He wrote against popery and embraced it; he was a zealous opposer of the court and a sacrifice for it; was conscientiously converted in the midst of his prosecution of Lord Strafford and was most unconscientiously a persecutor of Lord Clarendon. With great parts, he always hurt himself and his friends; with romantic bravery, he was always an unsuccessful commander. He spoke for the Test Act, though a Roman Catholic; and addicted himself to astrology on the birthday of true philosophy.\\" Samuel Pepys in 1668 records in the great Diary an outburst against Bristol from an elderly Cavalier, Mr Ball: \\"I said at the King's coming back that the nation could never be safe while that man was alive\\".Pepys Diaries, entry for 17 March 1668. Besides his youthful correspondence with Sir Kenelm Digby on the subject of religion, already mentioned, he was the author of an Apology (1643) [Thomason Tracts, E. 34 (32)], justifying his support of the king's cause; of a comedy, Elvira (1667) [Printed in R. Dodsley's Select Collection of Old English Plays (Hazlitt, 1876), vol. xv], and of Worse and Worse, an adaptation from the Spanish, acted but not printed. Other writings are also ascribed to him, including the authorship with Sir Samuel Tuke of The Adventures of Five Hours (1663). His eloquent and pointed speeches, many of which were printed, are included in the article in the Biog. Brit. and among the Thomason Tracts; see also the general catalogue in the British Museum. The catalogue of his library was published in 1680. Family Bristol married Lady Anne Russell, a daughter of Francis Russell, 4th Earl of Bedford and his wife Catherine Brydges. She died in 1697. They were parents to four children: *John Digby, 3rd Earl of Bristol (c. 163518 September 1698). He married twice, firstly Alice Bourne and secondly Rachel Wyndham, but died without issue, and the peerage became extinct. *Francis Digby (d. 1672), died unmarried. *Diana Digby, who married in 1658 Rene de Mol, Baron de Herent (died 1691), a nobleman of Flanders and had issue, including Jean-Baptiste, Baron de Herent, who was later styled \\"Comte de Bristole\\".

Girvan is situated on the east coast of the Firth of Clyde, with a population of about 6,700. It lies south of Ayr, and north of Stranraer, the main ferry port from Scotland to Northern Ireland. Girvan is an harbour town. History Girvan was originally a fishing port. In 1668, it became a municipal burgh incorporated by charter. The opening of the railways, initially with the Maybole and Girvan Railway at the end of the 1850s, encouraged the development of Girvan as a seaside resort with beaches and cliffs. Holidaying here from 1855 to 1941 were Robert and Elizabeth Gray and their children; particularly Alice and Edith Gray. The family, led principally by Elizabeth and Alice, created scientifically organised collections of fossils for several museums including the Natural History Museum. The town is now served by Girvan railway station. Just north of the town is a William Grant & Sons distillery which opened in 1964. There is a Nestl√© factory that manufactures chocolate that is shipped down to York and used in Kit Kat and Yorkie bars.

Apart from the baptism font beside the entrance gate the original Inverallan parish church no longer remains. Official records for this burial ground were not started until the 1900s when the gravedigger retired and it was realised that he was then the only source of information regarding burials not indicated on the memorials; the current burial register was founded upon the information supplied by him thus only burials recorded since that time have details supplied contemporaneously by relatives or undertakers. *Grantown (also known as the New Cemetery) which has been in use since the early 20th century.

The main entrance and car parking is on the B9102 with an alternative access to the lower end from the A95 Grantown bypass. Transport =Rail= There are no rail services to Grantown. The closest main line stations are Aviemore and Carrbridge from which trains travel north and south between Inverness and the Central Belt on the Highland Main Line. There is also a station at Forres from which trains run between Inverness and Aberdeen. The Strathspey Railway is a heritage railway which currently runs between Aviemore and Broomhill (nr Nethy Bridge) via Boat of Garten. There is a proposal to extend this railway to Grantown. =Bus= There are several local bus services mainly concentrating on the route to Aviemore but also serving surrounding places. Some services operate only on schooldays. There are a few buses that go to the Cairngorm Mountain Railway (a lot more in the winter to get skiers up to the mountain). Various long distance bus services are available in Aviemore, Elgin and Keith. Current information for bus services of most of the operators is consolidated within the websites of the Moray Council and the Stagecoach group. =Taxi= There are several local operators.

A seaside resort with two beaches, Kinghorn Beach and Pettycur Bay, plus a fishing port, it stands on the north shore of the Firth of Forth, opposite Edinburgh. According to the 2008 population estimate, the town has a population of 2,930. Known as the place where King Alexander III of Scotland died, it lies on the A921 road and the Fife Coastal Path. Kinghorn railway station is on the Edinburgh to Aberdeen and Fife Circle railway lines. Kinghorn only has a primary school, so high school pupils must travel by bus to Balwearie High School in Kirkcaldy. The town's lifeboat station is one of Scotland's busiest - regularly getting called out to all sorts of emergencies in the Firth. Currently stationed at Kinghorn is an Atlantic 85 inshore lifeboat, B-836 \\"Tommy Niven\\".

The former royal castle at Kinghorn was frequently visited by the Scottish Court in the period of the House of Dunkeld. The King's castle, controlling the seaway, stood on the headland above Pettycur.Kinghorn Castle was located at King Alexander III was returning on horseback to Kinghorn Castle to see his new wife Yolande of Dreux, when he fell and was found dead on the beach of Pettycur Bay in March 1286, creating the succession crisis that led to the Wars of Scottish Independence. A later structure, Glamis Tower (or Glamis Castle), stood just behind the High Street.Glamis Tower was located at When Sir John Lyon married Princess Johanna in 1373, the daughter of King Robert II, her dowry included Glamis Castle. Rebuilt in 1543, the castle was besieged by James Kirkcaldy of Grange in 1546 and fell. Both buildings have totally disappeared and the sites built over in modern times. During the Scottish Reformation, French troops commanded by Henri Cleutin and Captain Sarlabous sailed from Leith and fought with the Lords of the Congregation at Pettycur Bay on 7 January 1560. Kinghorn Castle remained an important possession of the Scottish Crown, and this was recognised by the creation of the Earldom of Kinghorne in 1606. A burn, fed from the freshwater Kinghorn Loch above the town, once provided the town with its water and subsequently provided the source of power to drive the machinery of flax mills. The old town was dramatically transformed in 1846 by the construction of the railway viaduct across the valley of the burn and the opening of Kinghorn Station by the Edinburgh and Northern Railway which had its terminus at Burntisland for ferries across the Forth to Granton. Much of the former horse ferry traffic from Pettycur Bay was lost to Burntisland. Following the opening of the Forth Railway Bridge in 1890, the North British Railway started to promote Kinghorn's picturesque sheltered bay and beach as a resort, which led to considerable development of the town. =Notable people= *William Barron Coutts FRSE, military scientisthttps://www.royalsoced.org.uk/cms/files/fellows/biographical_index/fells_indexp1.pdf *John McAulay, recipient of the Victoria Cross *Jimmy Frew, footballer *George Sanders, Scottish portrait painter *Christina Robertson, portrait painter in the UK and RussiaV.

Public Library and Community Centre (formerly Kinghorn Primary School) British Listed Buildings, accessed 12 February 2016 Culture and sport An annual attraction is the Black Rock '5' Race, commonly referred to as the \\"Black Rock '5'\\" or the \\"Black Rock Race\\", is a road and beach running race of about that has been held in Kinghorn each year since 1987. Its distinguishing feature is the loop around the Black Rocks, over a mile from the shore, and largely under water except at low tide. The race is held on a suitable Friday in May or June, when the tide is out and the water is no more than knee deep. Over the years it has changed from a simple race into a full-blown social night in Kinghorn's calendar. The inaugural Black Rock '5', held in 1987, was won by Gifford Kerr, ahead of 66 other finishers; a very small field by today's standards - in 2005 there were over 600 participants, of a wide variety of abilities. The race has been staged every year since 1987, apart from 1991, and throughout the years the numbers have increased significantly, as did the quality of the top end of the field, with recent winners including Neil Renault and Ross Houston. In the 21st century the race has been dominated by Edinburgh running club Hunters Bog Trotters (HBT) with both Phil Mowbray and Don Naylor having taken the spoils. The course record belongs to Ian Harkness, also of HBT, in a time of 22:03.

It is the traditional county town of the historic county of Kinross-shire. Location and transport The site of the original parish church and churchyard are located down a small wynd overlooking Loch Leven, a little away from the town. A map of Kinross from 1945 Kinross was originally linked by railway to Perthshire, Fife and Clackmannanshire until the rail links gradually disappeared. At one time three independent railway companies had their termini at the town. The Fife and Kinross Railway came from the east, the Kinross-shire Railway came from the south and The Devon Valley Railway came from the west. Recently, Kinross has expanded, especially since the construction of the M90 motorway, which is the main north-south artery bypassing the town. Many people working within a commuting radius of Kinross have settled in the town owing to its central location and local amenities. Locals and MSPs have also asked the Scottish Government to publish a Feasibility Study into re-establishing the Perth - Edinburgh Direct Rail Link. To This day no such Document has been Published. Tourism The burgh is located on the shores of Loch Leven. There are boat trips around the loch and to Loch Leven Castle where Mary, Queen of Scots was held prisoner in 1567. Up to 2014 the annual T in the Park music festival. which was officially replaced by TRNSMT festival in Glasgow Green, was held nearby, at the former Balado airfield. Balado is also the locale of a now inactive NATO ICBM early warning radar and during the Second World War there was an airstrip and barracks. Climate As with most of the British Isles, Kinross has an oceanic climate (K√∂ppen: Cfb). Sport and recreation The Loch Leven Trails offers 21 km (13 miles) of walking and cycling heritage trail around the shoreline of Loch Leven. It begins at RSPB Vane Farm Nature Reserve via Findatie to Kinross Pier/Kirkgate Park. There is a leisure centre located in Kinross, called Loch Leven Leisure. Kinross has three amateur football teams ‚Äì Kinross AFC who currently play in the Fife Kingdom Caledonian Football League, Kinross Colts 'A' Team (Previously Fossoway AFC) who play in the Fife 1st division and Portmoak AFC who play in the Perthshire 3rd division.

Its history reaches back to earliest recorded times, when it is thought to have been a major ecclesiastical centre. Later it was identified with witchcraft, and some older houses still feature a \\"witches stane\\" to ward off evil. In the 19th century, it was an important centre of the jute trade. The playwright J. M. Barrie was born and buried here, and a statue of Peter Pan stands in the town square. History The history of Kirriemuir extends back to the early historical period. It appears to have been a centre of ecclesiastical importance. The Kirriemuir Sculptured Stones, a series of late Pictish cross slabs, are on display at the Meffan Institute in Forfar and the Gateway to the Glens Museum in Kirriemuir. The lands of Ummarchie lay in the feudal barony of Kirriemure ‚Äì then in the Sheriffdom of Forfar ‚Äì and were owned for centuries by the Lauder of the Bass family.Calendar of the Laing Charters 854‚Äì1837, ed. Rev. John Anderson, Edinburgh, 1899, No. 317, pp. 80‚Äì81. Alexander Lauder of Ummarchie, Co. Forfar, born about 1504 and a younger brother of Robert Lauder of the Bass (died 1576), appears in many documents and died at some time in 1580. In October of this year, his younger son Walter had murdered his father's Roman Catholic brother James in a religious dispute.Register of the Privy Seal of Scotland 1575‚Äì1580, ed. Gordon Donaldson, D.Litt., Vol. vii, Edinburgh, 1966, No. 2651, p. 431. Walter was found guilty at Edinburgh on 15 December and beheaded.Pitcairn's Criminal Trials. The eldest son, another Alexander Lauder of Ummarchie, stood surety on 22 March 1600 in an Act of Caution in the Privy Council in a principal for 2000 merks for William Rynd of Kers, who was involved in violent armed feuds between the Lindsays and the Ogilvies.The Register of the Privy Council of Scotland, ed. David Masson, LL.D., vol. vi, 1599‚Äì1604, Edinburgh, 1884, p. 639. Alexander Lauder of Ummarchie was still living in 1608.Register of the Privy Council of Scotland 1607‚Äì1610, ed. David Masson, LL.D., Edinburgh, 1887, Vol. viii, p. 162. Kirriemuir has a history of witchcraft accusations dating back to the 16th century. Many older buildings have a witches' stane built in to ward off evil ‚Äì a hard grey stone set into the local red sandstone of which they were built. A pond on the outskirts, known as the Witch Pool, was where supposed witches were thought to have been drowned, but in fact it was a millpond for the 19th- century Meikle Mill. Local amateur historians tend to think this referred to a \\"mickle\\" (small ‚Äì it in fact means large)SND: Mickle. mill, but the reference is to one of John Meikle's patented chaff-separating machines, based on ideas he picked up in the Netherlands. The adjacent \\"Court Hillock\\" was shown, during excavations for a housing development, to be no more than a spoil heap left after excavation and cleaning of the pond. Though Kirrimuir's importance as a market town has diminished, its former jute factories (now manufacturing synthetics) recall its 19th-century importance as a centre of a home-based weaving industry. Historic features near Kirriemuir include a carved Pictish stone known as the Eassie Stone. It was found in a burn near the village of Eassie. Kirriemuir claims the narrowest public footpath in Western Europe; Cat's Close, situated between Grant's Pend and Kirkwynd. It is a mere 40 centimetres (15.75 inches) wide.Captioned photograph. The family estate of Sir Hugh Munro, who created Munro's Tables of Scottish mountains over 3,000 ft. in elevation (which are now called \\"munros\\"), is also located near the town. So is Kinnordy House, the seat of the Lyells. Governance Kirriemuir is represented within Angus Council by the Kirriemuir and Dean ward, from which three councillors are elected. As of 2012 these were: Ian Gaul (Scottish National Party), Ronnie Proctor (Scottish Conservative and Unionist), and Jeanette Gaul (Scottish National Party). Culture The town has three museums: the Gateway to the Glens Museum, Barrie's Birthplace, and the Tayside Police Museum. There was once a museum of aviation, whose artifacts are now in the Richard Moss Memorial Collection at the Montrose Air Station Heritage Centre. There is a camera obscura, donated by J. M. Barrie, on the hill, offering views to the south and south-west and of the higher hills to the north. Also on the hill and offering views from its southern slopes is the town cemetery, where Barrie is buried in the family grave. There is a silver granite war memorial in the centre of the cemetery, a column surmounted by a kilted soldier looking down across the town and over the broad fields of Strathmore to the Sidlaws. Every August a local music team holds a music festival, Live in the Den, featuring local guitar bands. In 2011 it was not held due to flooding. Setting Kirriemuir consists mainly of two areas: Northmuir and Southmuir. It sits looking south towards Glamis and the Sidlaws over Strathmore (one of the most fertile fruit-growing areas in Scotland). Its position at the base of the Angus glens makes it an attractive centre for hill walking on nearby Munros, and for fishing, partridge, pheasant and grouse shooting, and deer-stalking. There is also an 18-hole golf course with views north to Glen Clova and Glen Doll. Schools Webster's High School is located in Southmuir; Northmuir and Southmuir each have a primary school. Northmuir's replaced Reform Street Primary School, which was in the town centre and demolished to build the Lyell Court Sheltered Housing complex. Southmuir's moved to new premises in 2002, which had been built as part of an extension to Webster's High School. The earlier Southmuir building (once the original Webster's Seminary) was destroyed by fire on 29 October 2006 and has since been demolished. Parks The town's two main parks lie in the Gairie Burn glen and on top of Kirriemuir Hill. The Den can be split into two parts. The east Den lies to the east of Bellies Brae (The Commonty) and the west Den to the west of Bellies Brae. This park has a paddling pool. The Den is prone to flooding, as it lies in a deep valley. This last happened in December 2012. In the far west Den, there is a large Den Waterfall and the Cuttle Well. The Hill with Neverland, or the Peter Pan Play Park as it is sometimes called, is located in Northmuir. This play park with a Peter Pan theme was laid out in November 2010. Smaller parks include Davidson Park in Southmuir and Martin Park off Slade Road. Sport Kirriemuir is home to the junior football club Kirriemuir Thistle. Although Kirriemuir lacks a senior team side, the nearest club in the Scottish Football League is Forfar Athletic in the neighbouring town, one of several Angus clubs to play in the official league system. Kirriemuir also has a wheeled sports area in Martin Park and an all-weather sports pitch at Webster's Leisure Centre adjoining Webster's High School. Notable people *J. M. Barrie, creator of Peter Pan and Rector of the University of St Andrews, was born in Kirriemuir. He wrote of this \\"wee red toonie\\" as \\"Thrums\\" in his novels Auld Licht Idylls, A Window in Thrums, and The Little Minister. \\"Red\\" refers to the reddish sandstone from which the town's older properties are built. The town became a minor Victorian tourism destination in response to Barrie's novels. His birthplace on the Brechin road is now a museum owned by the National Trust of Scotland. A statue of Peter Pan stands in the town square in front of the old toll booth. *Violet Jacob, poet and novelist, returned widowed from India in 1936, went to live in Kirriemuir, and died there in 1946.Carol Anderson: \\"Jacob [n√©e Kennedy-Erskine], Violet Augusta Mary Frederica\\", Oxford Dictionary of National Biography (Oxford, UK, 2004) Retrieved 1 April 2018. *Scott McKenna, professional footballer playing for Nottingham Forest and Scotland, grew up in Kirriemuir and attended Websters High School. *David Niven, actor, claimed Kirriemuir as his birthplace, but was actually born in London. *Bon Scott, vocalist of AC/DC, was born at the maternity hospital in nearby Forfar in 1946 and lived in Kirriemuir until 1952, when his family emigrated to Australia. A plaque to his memory stands in Cumberland Close. On 26 January 2016, town officials approved plans for a statue of Scott in the Bellies Brae car park. This was unveiled by former AC/DC bass player Mark Evans in April 2016 during the town's annual \\"Bonfest\\" event. *Sir David Wilkie, surgeon, was born here in 1882.

Hawkins is the author of On Intelligence which explains his memory-prediction framework theory of the brain. In 2003, Hawkins was elected as a member of the National Academy of Engineering \\"for the creation of the hand-held computing paradigm and the creation of the first commercially successful example of a hand-held computing device.\\" He also serves on the Advisory Board of the Secular Coalition for America where he has advised on the acceptance and inclusion of nontheism in American life. Early life Hawkins grew up in an inventive family on the north shore of Long Island, who developed a floating air cushion platform that was used for waterfront concerts. He attended Cornell University, where he received a bachelor's degree in electrical engineering in 1979, then started work for Intel. GRiD Hawkins moved to GRiD Systems in 1982, where he developed rapid application development (RAD) software called GRiDtask. Hawkins' interest in pattern recognition for speech and text input to computers led him to enroll in the biophysics program at the University of California, Berkeley in 1986. While there he patented a \\"pattern classifier\\" for handwritten text, but his PhD proposal was rejected, apparently because none of the professors there were working in that field. The setback led him back to GRiD, where, as vice president of research, he developed their pen-based computing initiative that in 1989 spawned the GRiDPad, one of the first tablet computers.Pen Computing Jeff Hawkins 2 Hawkins desired to move on with the development of a smaller, hand-held device, but executives at GRiD were reluctant to take the risk. Tandy Corporation had acquired GRiD in 1988, and they were willing to support Hawkins in a new venture company. Palm and Handspring Hawkins founded Palm Inc. in January 1992. Their first product was the Zoomer, a collaboration with Palm applications, GeoWorks OS, Casio hardware, and Tandy marketing. The Apple Newton came out about the same time, late 1993, but both products failed, partly due to poor character recognition software. Hawkins responded with Graffiti, a simpler and more effective recognition product that ran on both the Zoomer and the Newton. They also developed HotSync synchronization software for Hewlett-Packard devices.Pen Computing Jeff Hawkins 3 Hawkins searched for partners to build a simple new handheld, but was stymied until modem manufacturer USRobotics stepped in with the financial backing and manufacturing expertise to bring the PalmPilot to market in early 1996. By the fall of 1998, US Robotics' new owner, 3Com, was hindering his plans. Hawkins left the company along with Palm co-founders Donna Dubinsky and Ed Colligan to start Handspring, which debuted the Handspring Visor in September 1999. 3Com ended up spinning off Palm in March 2000, which then merged in a reconfluence with Handspring in August 2003.New York Times (14 Oct 2018) Jeff Hawkins is finally ready to explain his brain research Numenta In March 2005, Hawkins, together with Dubinsky (Palm's original CEO) and Dileep George, founded Numenta, Inc. The company is based in Redwood City, California. They had a dual mission: to reverse-engineer the neocortex and enable machine intelligence technology based on brain theory. They have been using biological information about the structure of the neocortex to guide the development of their theory on how the brain works. They have come up with a machine intelligence technology called Hierarchical temporal memory (HTM). HTM can find patterns in noisy streaming data, model the latent causes, and make predictions about what patterns will come next. The company says that its biologically inspired machine learning technology is based on a theory of the neocortex first described in co-founder Hawkins' book, On Intelligence. Numenta is a technology provider and does not create go-to-market solutions for specific use cases. They license their technology and intellectual property for commercial purposes. In addition, Numenta has created NuPIC (Numenta Platform for Intelligent Computing) as an open source project.  Neuroscience  After graduating from Cornell in June 1979, he read a special issue of Scientific American on the brain in which Francis Crick lamented the lack of a grand theory explaining how the brain functions. Initially, Hawkins attempted to join the MIT AI Lab but was refused.F H C Crick, Thinking about the Brain. Scientific American 1979, 241,3:181-188 In 2002, after two decades of finding little interest from neuroscience institutions, Hawkins founded the Redwood Neuroscience Institute in Menlo Park, California. As a result of the formation of Hawkins' new company, Numenta, the Institute was moved to the University of California, Berkeley on July 1, 2005, renamed the Redwood Center for Theoretical Neuroscience, and is now administered through the Helen Wills Neuroscience Institute.Berkeley Neuroscience (31 January 2018) Redwood Center for Theoretical Neuroscience unveils new website In 2004, Hawkins published On Intelligence (with The New York Times science writer Sandra Blakeslee), laying out his \\"memory-prediction framework\\" of how the brain works. The memory- prediction framework encompasses a number of methods that the brain uses to classify input and recognize patterns. Hawkins' theory suggests an \\"unsupervised learning system\\" where accurate modelling is the only goal. One area of interest to Hawkins is cortical columns. These are structures in the neocortex where it is believed the brain creates and stores models of objects in the environment that it encounters. Hawkins theorizes that movement (ie, not just sensory input, but also information regarding the object's location and how we experience it over time) is a key component to the functions of cortical columns. He believes this component will be important to consider in future AI development. In 2016, Hawkins hypothesized that cortical columns did not just capture a sensation, but also the relative location of that sensation, in three dimensions rather than two (situated capture), in relation to what was around it. Hawkins explains, \\"When the brain builds a model of the world, everything has a location relative to everything else\\".Cade Metz The New York Times (15 October 2018) \\"A new view of how we think\\" pp.B1,B4 see: 'Clarity Over a Coffee Cup' In 2019 at CSICon conference‚ÄîHawkins spoke about basic and applied research and explained \\"We are beginning to find that there are diverse columns in the neocortex, with most columns getting their input from other columns, not direct sensory input\\".

Organizers called the demonstrators the \\"Bonus Expeditionary Force\\", to echo the name of World War I's American Expeditionary Forces, while the media referred to them as the \\"Bonus Army\\" or \\"Bonus Marchers\\". The demonstrators were led by Walter W. Waters, a former sergeant. Many of the war veterans had been out of work since the beginning of the Great Depression. The World War Adjusted Compensation Act of 1924 had awarded them bonuses in the form of certificates they could not redeem until 1945. Each certificate, issued to a qualified veteran soldier, bore a face value equal to the soldier's promised payment with compound interest. The principal demand of the Bonus Army was the immediate cash payment of their certificates. On July 28, U.S. Attorney General William D. Mitchell ordered the veterans removed from all government property. Washington police met with resistance, shot at the protestors, and two veterans were wounded and later died. President Herbert Hoover then ordered the U.S. Army to clear the marchers' campsite. Army Chief of Staff General Douglas MacArthur commanded a contingent of infantry and cavalry, supported by six tanks. The Bonus Army marchers with their wives and children were driven out, and their shelters and belongings burned. A second, smaller Bonus March in 1933 at the start of the Roosevelt administration was defused in May with an offer of jobs with the Civilian Conservation Corps at Fort Hunt, Virginia, which most of the group accepted. Those who chose not to work for the CCC by the May 22 deadline were given transportation home.\\"'Take Job in the Forest or Go Home' Is Alternative Given to Bonus Boys\\", Middlesboro (Kentucky) Daily News, May 17, 1933, p. 1; \\"Bonus Marchers Weaken; Accept Jobs in Ax Corps\\", Milwaukee Journal, May 20, 1933, p. 1 In 1936, Congress overrode President Roosevelt's veto and paid the veterans their bonus nine years early. Background Members of the Bonus Army camped out on the lawn of the U.S. Capitol building The practice of war-time military bonuses began in 1776, as payment for the difference between what a soldier earned and what he could have earned had he not enlisted. The practice derived from English legislation passed in the 1592‚Äì93 session of Parliament to provide medical care and maintenance for disabled veterans and bonuses for serving soldiers. Similar legislation for disabled veterans later only progressively passed by the North American colonies, beginning with Virginia in 1624. In 1781, most of the Continental Army was demobilized. Two years later, hundreds of Pennsylvania war veterans marched on Philadelphia, then the nation's capital, surrounded the State House, where the U.S. Congress was in session, and demanded back pay. Congress fled to Princeton, New Jersey, and several weeks later, the U.S. Army expelled the war veterans from Philadelphia. In August 1776, Congress adopted the first national pension law providing half pay for life for disabled veterans. Considerable pressure was applied to expand benefits to match the British system for serving soldiers and sailors but had little support from the colonial government until mass desertions at Valley Forge that threatened the existence of the Continental Army led George Washington to become a strong advocate. Congress progressively passed legislation from 1788 covering pensions and bonuses, eventually extending eligibility to widows in 1836. Before World War I, the soldiers' military service bonus (adjusted for rank) was land and money; a Continental Army private received and $80.00 (2017: $1,968.51) at war's end, while a major general received . In 1855, Congress increased the land-grant minimum to , and reduced the eligibility requirements to fourteen days of military service or one battle; moreover, the bonus also applied to veterans of any Indian war. The provision of land eventually became a major political issue, particularly in Tennessee where almost 40% of arable land had been given to veterans as part of their bonus. By 1860, had been issued and lack of available arable land led to the program's abandonment and replacement with a cash-only system. Breaking with tradition, the veterans of the Spanish‚ÄìAmerican War did not receive a bonus and after World War I, that became a political matter when they received only a $60 bonus. The American Legion, created in 1919, led a political movement for an additional bonus. Cinderella stamp (US, 1932) supporting the Bonus Army On May 15, 1924, President Calvin Coolidge vetoed a bill granting bonuses to veterans of World War I, saying: \\"patriotism... bought and paid for is not patriotism.\\" Congress overrode his veto a few days later,David Greenberg, Calvin Coolidge (NY: Henry Holt, 2006), 78‚Äì79 enacting the World War Adjusted Compensation Act. Each veteran was to receive a dollar for each day of domestic service, up to a maximum of $500 (), and $1.25 for each day of overseas service, up to a maximum of $625 (). Amounts of $50 or less were immediately paid. All other amounts were issued as Certificates of Service maturing in 20 years.Dickson and Allen, 29 There were 3,662,374 Adjusted Service Certificates issued, with a combined face value of $3.64 billion (equivalent to $ billion in ). Congress established a trust fund to receive 20 annual payments of $112 million that, with interest, would finance the 1945 disbursement of the $3.638 billion for the veterans. Meanwhile, veterans could borrow up to 22.5% of the certificate's face value from the fund; but in 1931, because of the Great Depression, Congress increased the maximum value of such loans to 50% of the certificate's face value.Dickson and Allen, 37‚Äì38 Although there was congressional support for the immediate redemption of the military service certificates, Hoover and Republican congressmen opposed such action and reasoned that the government would have to increase taxes to cover the costs of the payout and so any potential economic recovery would be slowed.Dickson and Allen, 34 The Veterans of Foreign Wars continued to press the federal government to allow the early redemption of military service certificates.Stephen R. Ortiz, \\"The 'New Deal' for Veterans: The Economy Act, the Veterans of Foreign Wars, and the Origins of the New Deal,\\" Journal of Military History, vol. 70 (2006), 434‚Äì45 The first march of the unemployed was Coxey's Army in 1894, when armies of men from various regions streamed to Washington as a \\"living petition\\" to demand that the federal government create jobs by investing in public infrastructure projects.Donald L. McMurry, \\"Coxey's Army\\", 1930. In January 1932, a march of 25,000 unemployed Pennsylvanians, dubbed \\"Cox's Army\\", had marched on Washington, D.C., the largest demonstration to date in the nation's capital, setting a precedent for future marches by the unemployed. March Bonus Army Camp Most of the Bonus Army (Bonus Expeditionary Force or BEF) camped in a \\"Hooverville\\" on the Anacostia Flats, a swampy, muddy area across the Anacostia River from the federal core of Washington, just south of the 11th Street Bridges (now Section C of Anacostia Park). Approximately 10,000 veterans, women and children lived in the shelters that they built from materials dragged out of a junk pile nearby, which included old lumber, packing boxes, and scrap tin covered with roofs of thatched straw. The camps were tightly controlled by the veterans, who laid out streets, built sanitation facilities, and held daily parades. To live in the camps, veterans were required to register and to prove they had been honorably discharged. The Superintendent of the D.C. Police, Pelham D. Glassford, worked with camp leaders to maintain order. On June 15, 1932, the US House of Representatives passed the Wright Patman Bonus Bill to move forward the date for World War I veterans to receive their cash bonus. The Bonus Army massed at the U.S. Capitol on June 17 as the U.S. Senate voted on the Bonus Bill. The bill was defeated by a vote of 62‚Äì18.  Police shooting  thumb On July 28, 1932, President Hoover ordered the Secretary of War to disperse the protesters. Towards the late afternoon, cavalry, infantry, tanks and machine guns pushed the \\"Bonusers\\" out of Washington. When the veterans moved back into the camp, police drew their revolvers and shot at the veterans, two of whom, William Hushka and Eric Carlson, died later. William Hushka (1895‚Äì1932) was an immigrant to the United States from Lithuania. When the US entered World War I in 1917, he sold his butcher shop in St. Louis, Missouri, and joined the army. After the war, he lived in Chicago. Eric Carlson (1894‚Äì1932) was a veteran from Oakland, California who fought in the trenches of France in World War I.Mentioned in \\"The March of the Bonus Army\\" video, 30 min. Retrieved from answer.com 2011-2-4. He was interred in Arlington National Cemetery. On July 28 under prodding from the White House the D.C. Commissioners ordered Glassford to clear their buildings, rather than letting the protesters drift away as he had previously recommended. When the two veterans were shot, the Commissioners asked the White House for federal troops. Hoover passed the request to Secretary of War Hurley, who told MacArthur to take action. =Army report= An Army intelligence report claimed that the BEF intended to occupy the Capitol permanently and instigate fighting, as a signal for Communist uprisings in all major cities. It also conjectured that at least part of the Marine Corps garrison in Washington would side with the revolutionaries, hence Marine units eight blocks from the Capitol were never called upon. The report of July 5, 1932 by Conrad H. Lanza in upstate New York was not declassified until 1991.Lisio, Donald J. ‚ÄúA Blunder Becomes Catastrophe: Hoover, the Legion, and the Bonus Army.‚Äù The Wisconsin Magazine of History, vol. 51, no. 1, 1967, p. 40 Army intervention At 1:40 pm MacArthur ordered General Perry Miles to assemble troops on the Ellipse immediately south of the White House. Within the hour the 3rd Cavalry led by Patton, then a Major, crossed the Memorial Bridge, with the 12th Infantry arriving by steamer about an hour later. At 4 pm Miles told MacArthur that the troops were ready, and MacArthur (like Eisenhower, by now in service uniform), said that Hoover wanted him \\"on hand\\" to \\"take the rap if ...\\" Although the troops were ready, Hoover twice sent instructions to MacArthur not to cross the Anacostia bridge that night, both of which were ignored. Shortly after 9 pm, MacArthur ordered Miles to cross the bridge and evict the Bonus Army from its encampment. At 4:45 pm. commanded by General Douglas MacArthur, the 12th Infantry Regiment, Fort Howard, Maryland, and the 3rd Cavalry Regiment, supported by six M1917 light tanks commanded by Maj. George S. Patton, formed in Pennsylvania Avenue while thousands of civil service employees left work to line the street and watch. The Bonus Marchers, believing the troops were marching in their honor, cheered the troops until Patton ordered the cavalry to charge them, which prompted the spectators to yell, \\"Shame! Shame!\\" Shacks that members of the Bonus Army erected on the Anacostia Flats burning after its confrontation with the army. After the cavalry charged, the infantry, with fixed bayonets and tear gas (adamsite, an arsenical vomiting agent) entered the camps, evicting veterans, families, and camp followers. The veterans fled across the Anacostia River to their largest camp, and Hoover ordered the assault stopped. MacArthur chose to ignore the president and ordered a new attack, claiming that the Bonus March was an attempt to overthrow the US government. 55 veterans were injured and 135 arrested. A veteran's wife miscarried. When 12-week-old Bernard Myers died in the hospital after being caught in the tear gas attack, a government investigation reported he died of enteritis, and a hospital spokesman said the tear gas \\"didn't do it any good.\\"Dickson and Allen, 182‚Äì83 During the military operation, Major Dwight D. Eisenhower, later the 34th president of the United States, served as one of MacArthur's junior aides.Dickson and Allen, 170‚Äì74, 180 Believing it wrong for the Army's highest-ranking officer to lead an action against fellow American war veterans, he strongly advised MacArthur against taking any public role: \\"I told that dumb son-of-a-bitch not to go down there,\\" he said later. \\"I told him it was no place for the Chief of Staff.\\" Despite his misgivings, Eisenhower later wrote the Army's official incident report that endorsed MacArthur's conduct. Aftermath Joe Angelo, a decorated hero from the war who had saved Patton's life during the Meuse- Argonne offensive on September 26, 1918, approached him the day after to sway him. Patton, however, dismissed him quickly. This episode was said to represent the proverbial essence of the Bonus Army, each man the face of each side: Angelo the dejected loyal soldier; Patton the unmoved government official unconcerned with past loyalties.Hirshson, Stanley P. General Patton. Harper Collins Publishers 2002. New York. Though the Bonus Army incident did not derail the careers of the military officers involved, it proved politically disastrous for Hoover, and it is considered a contributing factor to his losing the 1932 election in a landslide to Franklin D. Roosevelt. Police Superintendent Glassford was not pleased with the decision to have the Army intervene, believing that the police could have handled the situation. He soon resigned as superintendent. MGM released the movie Gabriel Over the White House in March 1933, the month Roosevelt was sworn in as president. Produced by William Randolph Hearst's Cosmopolitan Pictures, it depicted a fictitious President Hammond who, in the film's opening scenes, refuses to deploy the military against a march of the unemployed and instead creates an \\"Army of Construction\\" to work on public works projects until the economy recovers. First Lady Eleanor Roosevelt judged the movie's treatment of veterans superior to Hoover's.Blanche Wiesen Cook, Eleanor Roosevelt (NY: Viking, 1999), vol. 2, 44‚Äì46 During the presidential campaign of 1932, Roosevelt had opposed the veterans' bonus demands. A second bonus march planned for the following year in May by the \\"National Liaison Committee of Washington,\\" disavowed by the previous year's bonus army leadership, demanded that the Federal government provide marchers housing and food during their stay in the capital. Despite his opposition to the marchers' demand for immediate payment of the bonus, Roosevelt greeted them quite differently than Hoover had done. The administration set up a special camp for the marchers at Fort Hunt, Virginia, providing forty field kitchens serving three meals a day, bus transportation to and from the capital, and entertainment in the form of military bands. Administration officials, led by presidential confidant Louis Howe, tried to negotiate an end to the protest. Roosevelt arranged for his wife, Eleanor, to visit the site unaccompanied. She lunched with the veterans and listened to them perform songs. She reminisced about her memories of seeing troops off to World War I and welcoming them home. The most that she could offer was a promise of positions in the newly created Civilian Conservation Corps (CCC). One veteran commented, \\"Hoover sent the army, Roosevelt sent his wife.\\" In a press conference following her visit, the First Lady described her reception as courteous and praised the marchers, highlighting how comfortable she felt despite critics of the marchers who described them as communists and criminals. Roosevelt later issued an executive order allowing the enrollment of 25,000 veterans in the CCC, exempting them from the normal requirement that applicants be unmarried and under the age of 25. Congress, with Democrats holding majorities in both houses, passed the Adjusted Compensation Payment Act in 1936, authorizing the immediate payment of the $2 billion in World War I bonuses, and then overrode Roosevelt's veto of the measure. The House vote was 324 to 61, and the Senate vote was 76 to 19.

","title":"Bonus Army"},{"id":"399968","title":"Lindy Layton"},{"id":"399970","text":"Morpeth is a historic market town in Northumberland, North East England, lying on the River Wansbeck. Nearby towns include Ashington and Bedlington. In the 2011 census, the population of Morpeth was given as 14,017, up from 13,833 in the 2001 census. The earliest record of the town is believed to be from the Neolithic period. The meaning of the town's name is uncertain, but it may refer to its position on the road to Scotland and a murder which occurred on that road. An alternative origin is a derivation of 'murderers' path' from the time when the gallows were on the Common. The de Marley family was granted the Barony of Morpeth in c. 1080 and built two castles in the town in the late 11th century and the 13th century. The town was granted its coat of arms in 1552. By the mid 1700s it had become one of the main markets in England, having been granted a market charter in 1199, but the opening of the railways in the 1800s led the market to decline. The town's history is celebrated in the annual Northumbrian Gathering. Morpeth is governed by Northumberland County Council and Morpeth Town Council. The town is split into three wards ‚Äì North, Kirkhill and Stobhill ‚Äì for the purposes of parish elections. In 2008 the town suffered a severe flood, which was repeated in 2012, resulting in the construction of new flood defences. Morpeth railway station is on the east coast line and a curve to the south of it has caused several rail crashes. Several sports teams compete in Morpeth, with Morpeth Town A.F.C. having been the winner of the FA Vase in 2016. The town hosted its own Olympics from 1873 to 1958. Two middle schools, a high school and seven first schools are situated in Morpeth, as well as several churches of Anglican, Roman Catholic, United Reformed and Methodist denominations. Morpeth's Carlisle Park, the recipient of several awards, contains one of the four floral clocks in England.  History  Morpeth was founded at a crossing point of the River Wansbeck. Remains from prehistory are scarce, but the earliest evidence of occupation found is a stone axe thought to be from the Neolithic period. There is a lack of evidence of activity during the Roman occupation of Britain, although there were probably settlements in the area at that time. Morpeth is recorded in the Assize Rolls of Northumberland of 1256 as Morpath and Morthpath, and was also archaically spelt Morepath. The meaning of the town's name is uncertain; \\"moor path\\" has been suggested in reference to its historical position on the main road from England to Scotland, with the marshes around the modern-day Carlisle Park having been suggested to be the \\"moor\\" in question. Another possible meaning is that the name derives from the Old English pre-7th-century compound mor√∞-p√¶√∞ or Morthpaeth, meaning \\"murder path\\", in remembrance of \\"some forgotten\\" slaying on the road, although some old documents suggest that this meaning is a fallacy. The barony of Morpeth was granted to the de Merlay family in around 1080, and by 1095 a motte-and- bailey castle had been built by William de Merlay. Newminster Abbey, located on the outskirts of Morpeth, was founded in 1138 by William's son, Ranulf de Merlay, lord of Morpeth, and his wife, Juliana, daughter of Gospatric II, Earl of Lothian, as one of the first daughter houses of Fountains Abbey. King John granted a market charter for the town to Roger de Merlay in 1199. It became one of the main markets in Northern England by the mid 1700s and by the mid 18th century was one of the key cattle markets in England; however, the opening of the railways made transport to Newcastle easier in the 19th century, and the market accordingly declined. The market is still held on Wednesdays. thumb The town was badly damaged by fire set by the barons in 1215 during the First Barons' War, in an attempt to block the military operations of King John. The motte-and-bailey castle was burnt down by King John in 1216. Morpeth Castle was built later in the 13th century by Ranulph de Merlay, to the south of Haw Hill. Also in the 13th century, a stone bridge was built over the Wansbeck in Morpeth, to the west of the current bridge, replacing the ford previously in use in Morpeth. For some months in 1515‚Äì16, Margaret Tudor (Henry VIII's sister) who was the Queen Consort of Scotland (James IV's widow), had laid ill in Morpeth Castle, having been brought there from Harbottle Castle. The only remains of the castle are the gatehouse, which was restored by the Landmark Trust, and parts of the ruined castle walls. In 1540, Morpeth was described by the royal antiquary John Leland as \\"long and metely well-builded, with low houses\\" and \\"a far fairer town than Alnwick\\". During the 1543‚Äì51 war of the Rough Wooing, Morpeth was occupied by a garrison of Italian mercenaries, who \\"pestered such a little street standing in the highway\\" by killing deer and withholding payment for food. In 1552, William Hervey, Norroy King of Arms, granted the borough of Morpeth a coat of arms. The arms were the same as those granted to Roger de Merlay, but with the addition of a gold tower. In the letters patent, Hervey noted that he had included the arms of the \\"noble and valyaunt knyght ... for a p'petuall memory of his good will and benevolence towardes the said towne\\". Morpeth was a borough by prescription, but received its first charter of confirmation from Charles II. The corporation it created was controlled by seven companies: the Merchant Tailors, the Tanners, the Fullers and Dyers, the Smiths, the Cordwainers, the Weavers and the Butchers. This remained the governing charter until the borough was reformed by the Municipal Corporations Act 1835. During the Second World War, RAF Morpeth, an air-gunnery training school, opened at nearby Tranwell. The town and the county's history and culture are celebrated at the annual Northumbrian Gathering. The gathering is held over a weekend in mid-April and includes the Border Cavalcade and Pageant. The 50th gathering took place in 2017.  Governance  Morpeth has two tiers of local government. The lower tier is Morpeth Town Council, which has 15 members. Morpeth is a civil parish with the status of a town. For the purposes of parish elections the town is divided into three wards: North, Kirkhill and Stobhill, each returning five town councillors. Each ward also elects one County Councillor. Since May 2017, the political make up of the Town Council has been nine Conservatives, five Liberal Democrats and one Green member.:  The upper tier of local government is Northumberland County Council, which meets at County Hall in Morpeth. Since April 2009 the county council has been a unitary authority. Previous to this there was an intermediate tier, the non- metropolitan district of Castle Morpeth, which has been abolished along with all other districts in the county. The county council has 67 councillors, of whom three represent Morpeth, one each from the electoral wards of Morpeth Kirkhill, Morpeth North and Morpeth Stobhill. Since the 2017 County Council elections, all three wards have been represented by Conservative councillors.  Climate  Cockle Park, located slightly north of Morpeth, contains a Met Office weather station, founded in 1897. The following table shows the climate data of the station from 1971‚Äì2000, recorded at elevation: =2008 and 2012 floods= September 2008 floods On 6 September 2008, Morpeth suffered a severe flood, causing damage to 1,000 properties and leading 400 residents to be evacuated. The town's flood defences were breached after 12 hours, when a month's worth of rain fell on Morpeth. In September 2012, flooding occurred again, causing damage to properties, although floodwaters were reportedly shallower than in 2008. =Flood defences= Work on flood defences started in 2013 in response to the 2008 floods. New flood defences were built in the town centre and a dam with a storage reservoir was built on the Mitford Estate. A second ¬£27m dam was completed in May 2017 to reduce flooding from the Cotting Burn and marked the completion of the Morpeth flood defence plan.  Transport  The A1, the longest numbered road in the UK, used to pass through Morpeth until the bypass was opened in 1970. Morpeth's railway station is on the main East Coast Main Line which runs between London and Edinburgh. To the south of the station is a sharp curve which has been the scene of several train crashes. A non-passenger line operates between Morpeth and Bedlington. A former line, closed in 1966, ran west from Morpeth to Scots Gap (from where there was a branch line to Rothbury), then west to Redesmouth, and lastly south to Hexham.  Education  The local state school, King Edward VI School, was originally founded as a chantry school in the early 14th century and was located in the Morpeth Chantry. The school was refounded in 1552 by royal charter as the Free Grammar School of King Edward the Sixth, being commonly referred to as the Morpeth Grammar School by locals. The school was renamed to King Edward VI Grammar School by 1947 and in the 1970s lost its grammar school status, becoming a comprehensive under the current name. The town has two middle schools, Newminster and Chantry, which are built next door to one another. It also has several first schools: Abbeyfields First School in Kirkhill, Morpeth First School in Goose Hill (and relocating for the start of the 2019 school year), Stobhillgate First School in the Stobhillgate housing estate, and Morpeth All Saints' Church of England-aided First School in Lancaster Park, which is located north of the town.These references are in order of their mention in the article:   Additionally, St. Robert's R.C. First School, a primary school for Roman Catholics, is located in Oldgate, Morpeth.  Religious sites  The ancient parish church of St Mary the Virgin Church of St James the Great, built by the architect Benjamin Ferrey in 1846 St Robert of Newminster Roman Catholic Church, consecrated 1 August 1850 =Church of England= The ancient Church of England parish church of Morpeth is St Mary's at High Church, Source supports \\"High Church\\", because the church subsection is in the \\"South of the Wansbeck\\" section and the nickname for the \\"South of the Wansbeck\\" is \\"High Church\\" as stated in the source. which was the main Anglican place of worship in the area until the 1840s. The church is mostly in the 14th century style. The grave of Emily Wilding Davison lies in St Mary's graveyard. In 1843, a public meeting was called to address the lack of attendance at the church, and it was found that the walk to the current church, on the southern edge of the town, was too much for many of the parishioners. From this meeting, it was decided to build a new church in the town centre and accordingly, the church of St James the Great was consecrated for worship on 15 October 1846. Benjamin Ferrey designed the church in a \\"Neo-Norman\\" style, based on the 12th century Monreale Cathedral, Sicily. A third parish church, St Aidan's, was founded as a mission church in 1957, located on the Stobhill estate on the south-east of the town. =Roman Catholic Church= Morpeth's Roman Catholic Church, dedicated to St Robert of Newminster, was built off Oldgate on land adjacent to Admiral Lord Collingwood's house. It opened on 1 August 1850 and was consecrated by the Right Reverend, William Hogarth, Bishop of Samosata (later Bishop of Hexham). Collingwood House is now the presbytery (residence) for the priest in charge of the Church. =United Reformed Church= Morpeth has had a Presbyterian ministry since 1693. Their first service was held in a tannery loft in the town in February 1693 and in 1721 a chapel was built in Cottingwood Lane, which still exists as a private home. The construction of St. George's United Reformed Church began in 1858 and the first service in the new building was held on 12 April 1860. The Church stands immediately to the north of the Telford Bridge and is in the style of the early English era, containing a stained glass rose window and an octagonal spirelet. =Methodist Church= The present Methodist Church in Howard Terrace was opened as a Primitive Methodist place of worship on 24 April 1905. Designed by J. Walton Taylor, it was built from local quarry stone. Although the Primitive Methodists were united with the Wesleyan Church to form the Methodist Church of Great Britain in 1932, a separate Wesleyan Church continued to function in Manchester Street until 1964, when the congregations were united at Howard Terrace. The former Wesleyan Church (built in 1883) is currently used as the Boys' Brigade headquarters.  Sport  Morpeth Town A.F.C., Morpeth RFC and the Morpeth Golf Club play competitively within Morpeth. In addition, the Morpeth Harriers compete in athletics. The town also offers opportunities to play sport on a non-competitive basis through facilities such as Carlisle Park, the common for playing golf and football, and the Riverside leisure centre for swimming, indoor sports and fitness gym activities. Morpeth Town A.F.C. was the 2016 winner of the FA Vase. The Morpeth Olympic Games, a professional event consisting mainly of athletics and wrestling, were staged from 1873 until 1958, barring interruptions during the two world wars. The Games were held on the Old Brewery Field until 1896, then at Grange House Field until the First World War. After two years at the town's cricket pitch at Stobhill (1919‚Äì20), the Olympics moved to Mount Haggs Field until 1939, and then back to Grange House Field after the war until the end of the games in 1958. In 1730, a racecourse was built for horse racing, which was used until 1854, when the racetrack was replaced with St. George's Hospital. The town was the start point of the Morpeth To Newcastle Road Race. It was held annually on New Year's Day from 1902 to 2004, when insurance and policing costs became prohibitively high, and winners included Commonwealth champion Jack Holden and Olympic medallist Mike McLeod.  Landmarks  Town centre of Morpeth The historical layout of central Morpeth consisted of Bridge Street, Oldgate Street and Newgate Street, with burgage plots leading off them. Traces of this layout remain: Old Bakehouse Yard off Newgate Street is a former burgage plot, as is Pretoria Avenue, off Oldgate. The town stands directly on what used to be the Great North Road, the old coaching route between London and Edinburgh. Carlisle Park and a coat of arms A statue of Emily Wilding Davison commemorating 100 years since women were given the right to vote Carlisle Park is located on the southern bank of the River Wansbeck in Morpeth.

Charles Frederick Newcombe (15 September 1851 ‚Äì 19 October 1924) was a British botanist and ethnographic researcher. He is known for his studies of the First Nations or native people of Canada. Biography Newcombe was born in Newcastle-upon-Tyne, England, as the eighth of fourteen children. His parents were William Lister Newcombe (1817-1908) and Eliza Jane (Rymer) (1816-1888), who were both from Yorkshire. Newcombe received his MB from the University of Aberdeen in 1873 and his MD in 1878. He married Marian Arnold (1857-1891) in 1879. For a number of years he was in general practice in the Lake District. An albumen print by Newcombe taken in 1901 In 1884, Newcombe emigrated to the United States, establishing a general practice in Hood River, Oregon. He moved in 1885 with his family to Victoria, British Columbia. In 1889, he moved back to Victoria and worked at the \\"Insane Asylum\\" in New Westminster. His wife Marian died after the birth of their sixth child in 1891, leaving him with two daughters and four sons. With his eldest three children, he returned to England and participated in geological and natural history studies at the British Museum and the University of London. He ceased to practice medicine after 1894. Newcombe began to study the botany of North America and made many trips to Haida Gwaii (formerly the Queen Charlotte Islands) by boat. In the process he became very interested in the Haida and started to collect their artifacts to \\"preserve\\" them from, what was then thought to be, the impending demise of the native culture. Newcombe and others were driven by the \\"fear that 'pure' Northwest Coast cultures were disappearing through depopulation and assimilation\\". In 1897, George Amos Dorsey traveled with him in an effort to collect Haida artifacts for the Field Columbian Museum in Chicago. Dorsey, an American, was known for his haste in his collecting. Dorsey asked Scottish guide James Deans to keep quiet about their activities in the area. Local missionary John Henry Keen lambasted Deans and his unidentified American collaborators for disrupting and desecrating the graves of the local natives in their hunt for Northwest Coast artifacts. Newcombe acquired many totem poles for the Royal British Columbia Museum, the Pitt Rivers Museum in Oxford, the British Museum, Kew Gardens, and museums in Cambridge, LiverpoolCharles F. Newcombe at Liverpool Museum website, accessed 24 October 2010 and Sydney. In 1904, he went with six Vancouver Island First Nations people and their medicine man to the World's Fair held in St. Louis to show their crafts and culture. Newcombe also conducted biological and geographic research, such as on local (British Columbia) mollusks and paleontology. In 1913, he led a Commission studying the effect of sea lions on the salmon industry. In 1914, he prepared a report on the circumnavigation of Vancouver Island. Much of his work, including collection of plants, mollusks, fossils, aboriginal artifacts and information, was done with the help of his youngest surviving son, William Henry Arnold Newcombe (1884-1960). Newcombe died in 1924 in Victoria, British Columbia, after catching a cold (more likely pneumonia) on a sailing expedition.

Today, it is best known as the birthplace of many celebrated Romanians, including Mihai Eminescu, Nicolae Iorga and Grigore Antipa. Origin of the name The name of the city probably has its origin in the name of a boyar family called Bota»ô, whose name can be found in old records from the time of Prince Stephen the Great (late 15th century) as one of the most important families of Moldavia, records which trace it back to the 11th century. History Boto»ôani is first mentioned in 1439, in which one chronicle says that \\"the Mongols came and pillaged all the way to Botu»ôani\\".RƒÉdvan, p.469 The town is then mentioned only during the conflicts between Moldavia and Poland: several battles were fought near the town, in 1500, 1505 and 1509. During the reign of Petru Rare»ô, the town was set ablaze by the Poles. It was during his reign then that we know that the town had a hill fort. In the 15th century, it was still not a fully-fledged town, but archeological evidence shows that it was a pre-urban settlement. During the second part of the 14th century, some Transylvanian colonists (most likely German or Hungarian) settled in Boto»ôani. Additionally, a large community of Armenian traders settled in the 14th or 15th centuries.RƒÉdvan, p.470 At the junction of several commercial roads including the \\"Moldavian Road\\", which linked Ia»ôi to Hotin, the city was initially a market town. By 1579 it already had \\"the biggest and the oldest fair of Moldavia\\". A large Jewish community was established in the city during the 17th century, which was the second biggest and most important in Moldavia until the end of the 19th century. During World War II, Boto»ôani was captured on 7 April 1944 by Soviet troops of the 2nd Ukrainian Front in the course of the Uman‚ÄìBoto»ôani Offensive. Some of the most famous Romanian cultural representatives such as Mihai Eminescu, Romania's national poet, and Nicolae Iorga, the famous Romanian historian, were born in Boto»ôani. Contemporary poet Maria Baciu also hails from Boto»ôani. It is also the location of A.T. Laurian National College, founded in 1859, one of Romania's oldest and most prestigious pre-university educational institutions. Demographics Historically Jewish people constituted a large part of the population, reaching 15,502 (53%) at its peak in 1942. As of 2011 census data, Boto»ôani has a population of 106,847, a decrease from the figure recorded at the 2002 census, making it the 19th largest city in Romania. The estimated population as of July 2018 was 120,535. The ethnic makeup was as follows: * Romanians: 98.1% * Roma: 1% * Lipovans: 0.6% * Jews: 0.06% * Other: 0.24% Culture Boasting a rich cultural life, the city of Boto»ôani has long produced major personalities in science and culture.

Life and work  Travel in Russia Pallas was born in Berlin, the son of Professor of Surgery Simon Pallas. He studied with private tutors and took an interest in natural history, later attending the University of Halle and the University of G√∂ttingen. In 1760, he moved to the University of Leiden and passed his doctor's degree at the age of 19. Pallas travelled throughout the Netherlands and to London, improving his medical and surgical knowledge. He then settled at The Hague, and his new system of animal classification was praised by Georges Cuvier. Pallas wrote Miscellanea Zoologica (1766), which included descriptions of several vertebrates new to science which he had discovered in the Dutch museum collections. A planned voyage to southern Africa and the East Indies fell through when his father recalled him to Berlin. There, he began work on his Spicilegia Zoologica (1767‚Äì80). Title of the book Travels through the southern Provinces of the Russian Empire, in the years 1793 and 1794 In 1767, Pallas was invited by Catherine II of Russia to become a professor at the St Petersburg Academy of Sciences and, between 1768 and 1774, he led an expedition to central Russian provinces, Povolzhye, Urals, West Siberia, Altay, and Transbaikal, collecting natural history specimens for the academy. He explored the Caspian Sea, the Ural and Altai Mountains and the upper Amur River, reaching as far eastward as Lake Baikal. The regular reports which Pallas sent to St Petersburg were collected and published as Reise durch verschiedene Provinzen des Russischen Reichs (Journey through various provinces of the Russian Empire) (3 vols., 1771‚Äì1776). They covered a wide range of topics, including geology and mineralogy, reports on the native peoples and their religions, and descriptions of new plants and animals. In 1776, Pallas was elected a foreign member of the Royal Swedish Academy of Sciences. Pallas settled in St Petersburg, becoming a favourite of Catherine II and teaching natural history to the Grand Dukes Alexander and Constantine. He was provided with the plants collected by other naturalists to compile the Flora Rossica (1784‚Äì1815), a Russian flora, and started work on his Zoographica Rosso-Asiatica (1811‚Äì31), a zoography of Russia and Asia. He also published an account of Johann Anton G√ºldenst√§dt's travels in the Caucasus. The Empress bought Pallas's large natural history collection for 2,000 rubles, 500 more than his asking price, and allowed him to keep them for life. During this period, Pallas helped plan the Mulovsky expedition, which was cancelled in October 1787. Pallas Estate in Simferopol Between 1793 and 1794, Pallas led a second expedition to southern Russia, visiting the Crimea and the Black Sea. He was accompanied by his daughter (by his first wife who had died in 1782) and his new wife, an artist, servants, and a military escort. In February 1793, they travelled to Saratov and then downriver to Tsaritsyn. They explored the country to the east, and in August travelled along the banks of the Caspian Sea and into the Caucasus Mountains. In September, they travelled to the Crimea, wintering in Simferopol. Pallas spent early 1794 exploring to the southeast, and in July travelled up the valley of the Dnieper, arriving back in St Petersburg in September. Pallas gave his account of the journey in his P. S. Pallas Bemerkungen auf einer Reise in die S√ºdlichen Statthalterschaften des Russischen Reichs (1799‚Äì1801). Catherine II gave him a large estate at Simferopol, where Pallas lived until the death of his second wife in 1810. He was then granted permission to leave Russia by Emperor Alexander, and returned to Berlin, where he died in the following year. His grave is preserved in the Protestant Friedhof I der Jerusalems- und Neuen Kirchengemeinde (Cemetery No. I of the congregations of Jerusalem's Church and New Church) in Berlin- Kreuzberg, south of Hallesches Tor. Headstone of Peter Simon Pallas in the Berlin-Kreuzberg cemetery In 1809 he became associate member of the Royal Institute of the Netherlands. Pallasite In 1772, Pallas was shown a 680-kg lump of metal that had been found near Krasnoyarsk. Pallas arranged for it to be transported to St Petersburg. Subsequent analysis of the metal showed it to be a new type of stony-iron meteorite. This new type of meteorite was called pallasite after him; the meteorite itself is named Krasnojarsk or sometimes Pallas Iron (the name given to it by Ernst Chladni in 1794). Commemorated Several animals were described by Pallas, and his surname is included in their common names, including: Pallas' glass lizard, Pallas' viper,Beolens, Bo; Watkins, Michael; Grayson, Michael (2011). The Eponym Dictionary of Reptiles. Baltimore: Johns Hopkins University Press. xiii + 296 pp. . (\\"Pallas\\", p. 199). Pallas's cat, Pallas's long-tongued bat, Pallas's tube-nosed bat, Pallas's squirrel, Pallas's leaf warbler, Pallas's cormorant, Pallas's fish- eagle, Pallas's gull, Pallas's sandgrouse, Pallas's rosefinch, and Pallas's grasshopper warbler. Also, he is honoured in the scientific names of animals described by others, including: the Dagestani tortoise (Testudo graeca pallasi), Pallas's pika (Ochotona pallasi), Pallas's reed bunting (Emberiza pallasi), and the Pacific herring (Clupea pallasii). Streets in Berlin and Castrop-Rauxel are named Pallasstra√üe. Pallasovka, a city in Volgograd Oblast, is named after him, and his monument stands there. An asteroid is named after him: 21087 Petsimpallas. A Belgian astronomer, Eric Elst chose the name \\"Sarapul 26851\\" for an asteroid because in Pallas' writings, he mentioned his liking of the city of Sarapul, Russia.

Montrose initially joined the Covenanters in the Wars of the Three Kingdoms, but subsequently supported King Charles I as the English Civil War developed. From 1644 to 1646, and again in 1650, he fought in the civil war in Scotland on behalf of the King. He is referred to as the Great Montrose. Following his defeat and capture at the Battle of Carbisdale, Montrose was tried by the Scottish Parliament and sentenced to death by hanging, followed by beheading and quartering. After the Restoration, Charles II paid ¬£802 sterling for a lavish funeral in 1661, when Montrose's reputation changed from traitor or martyr to a romantic hero and subject of works by Walter Scott and John Buchan. His spectacular victories, which took his opponents by surprise, are remembered in military history for their tactical brilliance.  Family and education  James Graham, chief of Clan Graham, was the youngest of six children and the only sonBuchan 1928, p. 20. of John Graham, 4th Earl of Montrose and Lady Margaret Ruthven. The exact date and place of his birth are unknown, but it was probably in mid-October. His maternal grandparents were William Ruthven, 1st Earl of Gowrie, and Dorothea, a daughter of Henry Stewart, 1st Lord Methven and his second wife Janet Stewart. Her maternal grandparents were John Stewart, 2nd Earl of Atholl and Lady Janet Campbell. Janet Campbell was a daughter of Archibald Campbell, 2nd Earl of Argyll and Elizabeth Stewart. Elizabeth was a daughter of John Stewart, 1st Earl of Lennox and Margaret Montgomerie. Margaret was a daughter of Alexander Montgomerie, 1st Lord Montgomerie and Margaret Boyd. Graham studied at age twelve at the college of Glasgow under William Forrett who later tutored his sons.Buchan 1928, p. 21. At Glasgow, he read Xenophon and Seneca, and Tasso in translation. In the words of biographer John Buchan, his favourite book was a \\"splendid folio of the first edition\\" of History of the World by Walter Raleigh. Graham became 5th Earl of Montrose by his father's death in 1626.John Buchan, p. 36 He was then educated at Saint Salvator's College at the University of St Andrews.Buchan 1928, p. 22. At the age of seventeen, he married Magdalene Carnegie,British Civil Wars: James Graham, 1st Marquis of Montrose, 1612‚Äì1650 who was the youngest of six daughters of David Carnegie (afterwards Earl of Southesk). They were parents of four sons,Buchan 1928, p. 24. among them James Graham, 2nd Marquess of Montrose.  Covenanter to royalist  Portrait attributed to left In 1638, after King Charles I had attempted to impose an Episcopalian version of the Book of Common Prayer upon the reluctant Scots, resistance spread throughout the country, eventually culminating in the Bishops' Wars.John Buchan, p. 44‚Äì76 Montrose joined the party of resistance, and was for some time one of its most energetic champions.John Buchan, p. 75 He had nothing puritanical in his nature, but he shared in the ill-feeling aroused by the political authority King Charles had given to the bishops. He signed the National Covenant, and was part of Alexander Leslie's army sent to suppress the opposition which arose around Aberdeen and in the country of the Gordons. Though often cited as commander of the expedition, the Aberdeen Council letter books are explicit that the troops entered Aberdeen \\"under the conduct of General Leslie\\" who remained in charge in the city until 12 April.Louise B Taylor (ed.), Aberdeen Council Letters (6 vols. Oxford, 1942-1961), vol. 2. Aberdeen Council to Charles I, 29 June 1639; E. J. Cowan, Montrose: For Covenant and King (Edinburgh, 1995), p.64; Murdoch, Grosjean Alexander Leslie, p.99 Three times Montrose entered Aberdeen. On the second occasion, the leader of the Gordons, the Marquess of Huntly entered the city under a pass of safe conduct but ended up accompanying Montrose to Edinburgh, with his supporters saying as a prisoner and in breach of the pass, but CowanE. J. Cowan, Montrose: For Covenant and King (Edinburgh, 1995), p.73 is clear Huntly chose to go voluntarily, rather than as prisoner, noting 'by giving out he had been forced to accompany Montrose he was neatly easing his own predicament and at the same time sparing Montrose a great deal of embarrassment'. SpaldingJohn Spalding, Memorialls of the Trubles in Scotland and in England 1624-1655, 2 vols (Aberdeen 1850) also supports that Huntly went voluntarily. Montrose was a leader of the delegation who subsequently met at Muchalls Castle to parley regarding the 1638 confrontation with the Bishop of Aberdeen. With the Earl Marischal he led a force of 9000 men across the Causey Mounth through the Portlethen Moss to attack Royalists at the Battle of the Brig of Dee.C.Michael Hogan, Causey Mounth, Megalithic Portal, ed. by A. Burnham, 3 November 2007 These events played a part in Charles I's decision to grant major concessions to the Covenanters. In July 1639, after the signing of the Treaty of Berwick, Montrose was one of the Covenanting leaders who visited Charles. His change of mind, eventually leading to his support for the King, arose from his wish to get rid of the bishops without making Presbyterians masters of the state. His was essentially a layman's view of the situation. Taking no account of the real forces of the time, he aimed at an ideal form of society in which the clergy should confine themselves to their spiritual duties, and the King should uphold law and order. In the Scottish parliament which met in September, Montrose found himself opposed by Archibald Campbell, 1st Marquess of Argyll, who had gradually assumed leadership of the Presbyterian and national party, and of the estate of burgesses. Montrose, on the other hand, wished to bring the King's authority to bear upon parliament to defeat Argyll, and offered the King the support of a great number of nobles. He failed, because Charles could not even then consent to abandon the bishops, and because no Scottish party of any weight could be formed unless Presbyterianism were established as the ecclesiastical power in Scotland. Rather than give way, Charles prepared in 1640 to invade Scotland. Montrose was of necessity driven to play something of a double game. In August 1640 he signed the Bond of Cumbernauld as a protest against the particular and direct practising of a few, in other words, against the ambition of Argyll. But he took his place amongst the defenders of his country, and in the same month displayed his gallantry in action at the forcing of the River Tyne at Newburn. On 27 May 1641 he was summoned before the Committee of Estates and charged with intrigues against Argyll, and on 11 June he was imprisoned by them in Edinburgh Castle. Charles visited Scotland to give his formal assent to the abolition of Episcopacy, and upon the King's return to England, Montrose shared in the amnesty tacitly accorded to all Charles's partisans.  Scotland in the Wars of the Three Kingdoms  A souvenir of Montrose's hanging: His right arm (seen front and back) and sword. The arm was nailed at the gate of Dundee, later was carried off to England, and was never buried with his remains. The king signed a warrant for his Marquessate and appointed Montrose Lord Lieutenant of Scotland, both in 1644. A year later in 1645, the king commissioned him captain general.Buchan 1928, p. 139. His military campaigns were fought quickly and used the element of surprise to overcome his opponents even when sometimes dauntingly outnumbered. At one point, Montrose dressed himself as the groom of the Earl of Leven and travelled away from Carlisle, and the eventual capture of his party, in disguise with \\"two followers, four sorry horses, little money and no baggage\\".Buchan 1928, pp. 151‚Äì152. Highlanders had never before been known to combine together, but Montrose knew that many of the West Highland clans, who were largely Catholic, detested Argyll and his Campbell clansmen, and none more so than the MacDonalds who with many of the other clans rallied to his summons. The Royalist allied Irish Confederates sent 2000 disciplined Irish soldiers led by Alasdair MacColla across the sea to assist him. The Irish proved to be formidable fighters.\\"...it is not hard to understand how in Gaelic legend his[Alasdair's] fame is made to outshine Montrose's\\" in Buchan 1928, p. 219, also July and August 1645, \\"the thousand Irish were probably the best infantry at the time in Britain\\" on p. 235. In two campaigns, distinguished by rapidity of movement, he met and defeated his opponents in six battles. At Tippermuir and Aberdeen he routed Covenanting levies; at Inverlochy he crushed the Campbells, at Auldearn, Alford and Kilsyth his victories were obtained over well-led and disciplined armies.George Wishart, Memoirs of the Most Renowned James Graham, Marquis of Montrose, 1819, A. Constable, 530 pages The fiery enthusiasm of the Gordons and other clans often carried the day, but Montrose relied more upon the disciplined infantry from Ireland. His strategy at Inverlochy, and his tactics at Aberdeen, Auldearn and Kilsyth furnished models of the military art, but above all his daring and constancy marked him out as one of the greatest soldiers of the war. His career of victory was crowned by the great Battle of Kilsyth on 15 August 1645. Montrose in streets of Edinburgh before the day of his hanging Now Montrose found himself apparently master of Scotland. After Kilsyth, the king's secretary arrived with letters from Charles documenting that Montrose was lieutenant and captain general. He first conferred knighthood on Alasdair. Then he summoned a parliament to meet at Glasgow on 20 October, in which he no doubt hoped to reconcile loyal obedience to the King with the establishment of a non-political Presbyterian clergy. That parliament never met. Charles had been defeated at the Battle of Naseby on 14 June 1645, and Montrose had to come to his aid if there was to be still a king to proclaim. David Leslie, one of the best Scottish generals, was promptly dispatched against Montrose to anticipate the invasion. On 12 September he came upon Montrose, who had been deserted by his Highlanders and was guarded only by a little group of followers, at Philiphaugh. He won an easy victory. Montrose cut his way through to the Highlands; but he failed to organise an army. In September 1646 he embarked for Norway. Stories of his victories as documented in Latin by George Wishart reached the continent and he was offered an appointment as lieutenant-general in the French army, and the Emperor Ferdinand III awarded him the rank of field marshall, but Montrose remained devoted to the service of King Charles and so his son, Charles II.http://bcw-project.org/biography/james-graham-marquis-of-montrose The exhumed body of Montrose was placed inside St. Giles' Cathedral. His tomb is inscribed with lines from one of his poems, \\"Scatter my ashes, strew them in the air/Lord, since thou knowest where all these atoms are...\\" Montrose was to appear once more on the stage of Scottish history. In June 1649, eager to avenge the death of the King, he was restored by the exiled Charles II to the now nominal lieutenancy of Scotland. Charles, however, did not scruple soon afterwards to disavow his noblest supporter to become King on terms dictated by Argyll and his adherents. In March 1650 Montrose landed in Orkney to take command of a small force which he had sent on before him with George Hay, 3rd Earl of Kinnoull. Crossing to the mainland, he tried in vain to raise the clans, and on 27 April was surprised and routed at the Battle of Carbisdale in Ross-shire. His forces were defeated in battle but he escaped. After wandering for some time he was surrendered by Neil MacLeod of Assynt at Ardvreck Castle, to whose protection, in ignorance of MacLeod's political enmity, he had entrusted himself. He was brought a prisoner to Edinburgh, and on 20 May sentenced to death by the parliament. He was hanged on the 21st, with Wishart's laudatory biography of him around his neck. He protested to the last that he was in truth a Covenanter and a loyal subject. His head was removed and stood on the \\"prick on the highest stone\\" of the Old Tolbooth outside St Giles Cathedral from 1650 until the beginning of 1661.Grant's Old and New Edinburgh, p. 124 Shortly after Montrose's death the Scottish Argyll Government switched sides to support Charles II's attempt to regain the English throne, providing he was willing to impose the Solemn League and Covenant in England for a trial period at least. After the Restoration Montrose was officially rehabilitated in the public memory. On 7 January 1661 Montrose's mangled torso was disinterred from the gallows ground on the Burgh Muir and carried under a velvet canopy to the Tolbooth, where his head was reverently removed from the spike, before the procession continued on its way to Holyrood Abbey. The diarist John Nicoll wrote the following eyewitness account of the event, > [A guard of honour of four captains with their companies, all of them in] > thair armes and displayit colouris, quha eftir a lang space marching up an > doun the streitis, went out thaireftir to the Burrow mure quhair his corps > wer bureyit, and quhair sundry nobles and gentrie his freindis and > favorites, both hors and fute wer thair attending; and thair, in presence of > sundry nobles, earls, lordis, barones and otheris convenit for the tyme, his > graif [grave] was raisit, his body and bones taken out and wrappit up in > curious clothes and put in a coffin, quhilk, under a canopy of rich velwet, > wer careyit from the Burrow-mure to the Toun of Edinburgh; the nobles > barones and gentrie on hors, the Toun of Edinburgh and many thousandis > besyde, convoyit these corpis all along, the callouris [colours] fleying, > drums towking [beating], trumpettis sounding, muskets cracking and cannones > from the Castell roring; all of thame walking on till thai come to the > Tolbuith of Edinburgh, frae the quhilke his heid wes very honorablie and > with all dew respectis taken doun and put within the coffin under the > cannopie with great acclamation and joy; all this tyme the trumpettis, the > drumes, cannouns, gunes, the displayit cullouris geving honor to these deid > corps.

The torso of an executed person would have normally been given to friends or family; but Montrose was the subject of an excommunication which was why it was originally buried in unconsecrated ground. In 1650 his niece, Lady Napier, had sent men by night to remove his heart. This relic she placed in a steel case made from his sword and placed the whole in a gold filigree box, which had been presented to her family by a Doge of Venice. The heart in its case was retained by the Napier family for several generations until lost amidst the confusion of the French Revolution.Chambers, Robert (1885). Domestic Annals of Scotland.

When Meghanada was going to be born, Ravana wished his son to be supreme so that no one in the world could defeat him. Ravana wanted his son to be the ultimate warrior and extremely knowledgeable. Ravana was a great astrologer. To make his son immortal, he commanded all the planets and constellations in such a position that would allow his son to be born the way he wanted. Because of Ravana's anger and power, all the planets and constellations feared him. All the planets were in the position as desired by Ravana at time of his son Meghanada's birth. All the planets aligned in such a way that they came in the 11th house of Meghanada's horoscope. However, Shani (Saturn) had disobeyed Ravana's orders and had settled in the 12th house of Meghanada's horoscope. Ravana became furious at this and lamed Shani. Due to the state of Shani, Meghanada had to die at the hands of Lakshmana in the war between Lord Rama and Ravana. Meghanada was also an expert in magical warfare, sorcery and tantra. He was married to Sulochana, the virtuous daughter of the King of the serpents, Shesha Naga. Brahma's boon During the battle between the Devas and Ravana, Lord Indra, king of heavens accompanied by all other devas captured Ravana. To rescue his father, Meghanada attacked Indra and his elephant Airavata, and defeated all the Devas, even Indra. Meghanada tied and mounted Indra onto his celestial chariot and brought him to Ravana in Lanka. Ravana and Meghanada decided to kill Indra. At this juncture, Lord Brahma intervened and asked Meghanada to free Indra. Meghanada obliged and was granted a chance to ask for a boon from Brahma. Meghanada asked for immortality, but Brahma remarked that absolute immortality is against the law of the nature. Instead, he was then granted another boon that after the completion of the Yagna (fire-worship) of his native goddess Prathyangira or the \\"Nikumbhila yagna\\" would be completed, he will get a celestial chariot, mounting on which, any enemy can't kill him in a war and become invulnerable. But Brahma also cautioned him that whosoever would destroy this yagna, would also kill him. Brahma was highly impressed by Meghanada's valor in this war and it was Brahma who coined him the name Indrajit (\\"the conqueror of Indra\\"). It is also believed that Meghanada was granted another boon by Brahma in which it was promised to him that he would only be killed by a common man who hadn't had sleep for 12 years continuously. Role in battle Meghanada was the greatest and the most furious warrior on Ravana's side. He was a great archer and unsurpassed grand master in illusion warfare techniques. =First Day= Rama & Lakshmana Bound By Indrajit's Nagapasha On the first day of his battle with Rama's army, Indrajit was fast with his weapons. He was defeated by Angad and ran away from battle field. He swiftly wiped out the armies of Sugriva, calling on Lord Rama and Lakshmana to come in a direct combat, so he could avenge the deaths of his paternal uncle and his brothers. When Lakshmana appeared before him, he fought fiercely and used his most nefarious weapon Nagapash (a trap made of a million snakes). Rama and Lakshmana fell on the ground breathless. They were rescued by Garuda on behest of Hanuman. Garuda was the uncle of Jatayu and Sampati and the enemy of the serpents and also the flying vehicle of Vishnu, of whom Rama was the seventh avatar. =Second Day= When Indrajit came to know that both Rama and Lakshmana had been rescued by Garuda and were still alive, he was livid and vowed to kill at least one of the brothers on that day. When the battle started, he used all his force to cast a havoc on the armies of Sugriva. At this Lakshmana appeared before him and fought a fierce battle with him. Indrajit used his supreme magical powers, darting across the clouds and skies like a bolt of lightning. He combined his skills of sorcery and illusion warfare, repeatedly vanishing and reappearing behind Lakshmana's back. He was invisible but his arrows injured Lakshmana. Indrajit used the Vasavi Sakthi against Lakshmana, and upon being impaled Lakshmana fell unconscious, poised to die precisely at the following sunrise. His life was saved by Lord Hanuman, who brought the whole mountain of Dronagiri from the Himalayas to Lanka overnight to find the remedy (the magical herb - Sanjivani) for the weapon used by Indrajit and cured him. Although there is speculation that Rama too fought but it is not true. Dharma does not allow multiple warriors to fight against one and it was only Lakshmana who got injured because it is against moral duty to fight against an invisible warrior. =Third day= Lakshamana Fights Indrajit Killing Of Indrajit Painting By Balasaheb Pant Pratinidhi When Indrajit came to know that Lakshmana had survived again, he went to his native deity's secret temple to perform the yagna that would make him warrior- who can't be killed by anyone. Vibhishana, Indrajit's paternal uncle who left Ravana to join Rama, learned of his nephew Indrajit's plans through his spies and alerted Rama. Lakshmana and Vibhisana took the opportunity to face Indrajit in the \\"Yagnaagaar\\", where Indrajit would not touch any weapons. As the Valmiki Ramayana quotes, upon his Yagna being destroyed by the armies of Lakshmana, Indrajit became enraged and stormed out of the Temple Cave. Indrajit fought Lakshmana with the utensils of the yagna. Seeing his uncle Vibhishana at Lakshmana's side multiplied Indrajit's fury manyfold. He vowed to kill his uncle Vibhisana along with Lakshmana once and for all, letting loose the Yama-astra which he had been conserving for punishing Vibhishana's perceived treason. At this juncture, Lakshmana protected Vibhishana, countering the Yama-astra owing to an earlier warning by Kubera. Realization dawned on Indrajit that Lakshman was not an ordinary human and had met the criteria to defeat Indrajit, i.e. blunder the yagna and not sleep for 12 years. Indrajit vanished briefly from the battlefield, returning to Ravana at the royal palace, and reported the developments, proposing that his father make peace with Rama. Ravana blinded with pride was unrelenting and annoyed, claiming that Indrajit was a coward for having fled the battlefield. This accusation provoked Indrajit who briefly lost his temper, striking fear even at the mighty Ravana's heart before apologizing and clarifying to his father that his primary duty as a son was to serve his father's best interests and that even in the face of death, he would never abandon Ravana. Preparing to go back to the battle and knowing that he indeed faced death at the hands of a heavenly incarnation, Indrajit said his last goodbyes to his parents and his wife. He returned to the battlefield and fought Lakshmana with all his skill at both illusion warfare and sorcery. The arrows of Indrajit refused to harm Lakshmana because Lakshman was the incarnation of Sesha Naga. Lakshmana slew Indrajit by beheading him with the Anjalikastra. It was possible only because of a curse given to Indrajit by Sesha Naga for marrying his daughter without his permission. Sesha Naga incarnated as Rama's brother Lakshmana, to kill Indrajit, didn't have any sleep for twelve years during their exile so that he would be able to serve Rama and Sita efficiently and meet the criteria to kill Indrajit. .

She was originally known as Pelican, but Drake renamed her mid-voyage in 1578, in honour of his patron, Sir Christopher Hatton, whose crest was a golden hind (a female red deer). Hatton was one of the principal sponsors of Drake's world voyage. A full- sized, seaworthy reconstruction exists in London, on the south bank of the Thames.  History  Queen Elizabeth I partly sponsored Sir Francis Drake as the leader of an expedition intended to pass around South America through the Strait of Magellan and to explore the coast that lay beyond. The queen's support was advantageous; Drake had official approval to benefit himself and the queen, as well as to cause the maximum damage to the Spaniards. This eventually culminated in the Anglo‚ÄìSpanish War. Before setting sail, Drake met the queen face-to-face for the first time and she said to him, \\"We would gladly be revenged on the King of Spain for divers injuries that we have received.\\" \\"Sir Francis Drake\\" by Lord Simon Fitz Tomas Golden Hind displayed at Deptford on the River Thames, 1581 The explicit object was to \\"find out places meet to have traffic.\\" Drake, however, acted as a privateer, with unofficial support from Elizabeth. Kelsey, Harry, Sir Francis Drake; The Queen's Pirate, Yale University Press, New Haven, 1998, Golden Hind is described as a \\"mid-16th-century warship during the transition from the carrack to the galleon,\\" and weighed about 120 tons. He first named his flagship Pelican, but renamed her Golden Hind on 20 August 1578 to honour his patron, Sir Christopher Hatton, whose family crest was a golden hind. He set sail in December 1577 with five small ships, manned by 164 men, and reached the Brazilian coast in early 1578.Cummins, John, Francis Drake: The Lives of a Hero, 1996, Palgrave Macmillan. On 1 March 1579, now in the Pacific Ocean, off the coast of Ecuador, Golden Hind challenged and captured the Spanish galleon . This galleon had the largest treasure captured to that date: over 360,000 pesos (equivalent to around ¬£480m in 2017).To Rule the Waves: How the British Navy Shaped the Modern World (2004) Herman, A. Harper Collins, New York p.88 The treasure took six days to transship and included 26 tons of silver, half a ton of gold, porcelain, jewellery, coins, and jewels.To Rule the Waves: How the British Navy Shaped the Modern World (2004) Herman, A. Harper Collins, New York p.94 On 26 September 1580, Francis Drake sailed his ship into Plymouth Harbour with 56 of the original crew of 80 left aboard. The ship was unloaded at Saltash Castle nearby, where the treasure offloading was supervised by the Queen's guards. The final treasure also included six tons of cloves from the Spice Islands, at the time worth their weight in gold. Elizabeth herself went aboard Golden Hind, which was then permanently at Deptford on the south bank of the Thames, where she had requested it be placed on permanent display as the first 'museum ship'. There, she shrewdly asked the French ambassador to bestow a knighthood on Drake. Over half of the proceeds went to the crown - her share of the treasure came to at least ¬£160,000: \\"enough to pay off her entire government debt and still have ¬£40,000 left over to invest in a new trading company for the Levant. Her return, and that of other investors, was more than ¬£47 for every ¬£1 invested, or 4,700%.\\" To Rule the Waves: How the British Navy Shaped the Modern World (2004) Herman, A. Harper Collins, New York p.94 After Drake's circumnavigation, Golden Hind was maintained for public exhibition at the dockyard at Deptford, London. The ship remained there from 1580 to around 1650, 45 years after Elizabeth had died, before the ship eventually rotted away and was broken up. In 1668, the keeper of the stores at Deptford, John Davies of Camberwell, had the best remaining timber of Golden Hind made into a chair which was presented to the Bodleian Library at the University of Oxford, where it remains (with a replica in the Great Hall, Buckland Abbey, Devon, Drake's home and now maintained by the National Trust). A table, known as the cupboard, in the Middle Temple Hall, London is also reputed to have been made from the wood of Golden Hind. Upon the cupboard is placed the roll of members of Middle Temple, which new members sign when they are called to the Bar. The ship's lantern was hung in the vestibule of Middle Temple Hall, but was destroyed during the Second World War.  Replicas  =Replica in Essex= A replica of Golden Hind was constructed at Peter Pan's Playground (now Adventure Island adventure park), Southend-on-Sea, Essex. It was constructed from 1947 and opened in 1949 together with a waxworks. By 1992, attendances had dropped, and combined with rising maintenance costs with the need for major renovation to the wooden structure caused its closure in 1997. The ship was replaced by a replica of Blackbeard's Queen Anne's Revenge, which was demolished in 2013. =Replicas in Devon= The first replica in Brixham, 1968 The second replica in Brixham A replica of Golden Hind has been permanently moored in the harbour of the sea port of Brixham in Devon () since 1963 following its use in the TV series Sir Francis Drake, which was filmed in and around the bays of Torbay and Dartmouth. The replica ship used in the TV series cost ¬£25,000 to construct and had no rear gallery or gun deck and was a converted fishing boat . The ship sank whilst under tow in 1987 to Dartmouth for restoration in heavy seas and could not be saved. A second, full-sized replica was completed in 1988 and stands in the harbour being visited by thousands of visitors annually. The current vessel is based on a steel barge and could never sail. =London replica ‚Äì Golden Hinde= A full-size reconstruction of the ship Golden Hinde was built by traditional methods in Appledore, Devon, and launched in 1973. Golden Hinde was the result of three years' research and construction. Since then, she has travelled more than 140,000 miles (225,000 km). She sailed from Plymouth on her maiden voyage in late 1974, arriving on 8 May 1975 in San Francisco. In 1979, she sailed to Japan to make the miniseries Sh≈çgun, after which she returned to the UK having completed a circumnavigation. Between 1981 and 1984, she was berthed in England and was established as an educational museum. In 1984‚Äì85, she sailed around the British Isles and then crossed the Atlantic to St Thomas in the Caribbean. In 1986, she passed through the Panama Canal to sail on to Vancouver, where she was the main attraction in the Marine Plaza at Expo86. In 1987, she began a tour of US coastal cities, spending two years on the Pacific coast. In late 1988, she passed back through the Panama Canal to continue port visits on the Gulf and east coasts of the USA. In 1992, she returned home to the UK and spent the next four years visiting ports in Europe. Since 1996, she has been berthed at St Mary Overie Dock, in Bankside, Southwark, London, where she is open to the public and hosts a range of educational programmes.

The Rao‚ÄìBlackwell theorem states that if g(X) is any kind of estimator of a parameter Œ∏, then the conditional expectation of g(X) given T(X), where T is a sufficient statistic, is typically a better estimator of Œ∏, and is never worse. Sometimes one can very easily construct a very crude estimator g(X), and then evaluate that conditional expected value to get an estimator that is in various senses optimal. The theorem is named after Calyampudi Radhakrishna Rao and David Blackwell. The process of transforming an estimator using the Rao‚ÄìBlackwell theorem is sometimes called Rao‚ÄìBlackwellization. The transformed estimator is called the Rao‚ÄìBlackwell estimator. Definitions *An estimator Œ¥(X) is an observable random variable (i.e. a statistic) used for estimating some unobservable quantity. For example, one may be unable to observe the average height of all male students at the University of X, but one may observe the heights of a random sample of 40 of them. The average height of those 40‚Äîthe \\"sample average\\"‚Äîmay be used as an estimator of the unobservable \\"population average\\". *A sufficient statistic T(X) is a statistic calculated from data X to estimate some parameter Œ∏ for which no other statistic which can be calculated from data X provides any additional information about Œ∏. It is defined as an observable random variable such that the conditional probability distribution of all observable data X given T(X) does not depend on the unobservable parameter Œ∏, such as the mean or standard deviation of the whole population from which the data X was taken. In the most frequently cited examples, the \\"unobservable\\" quantities are parameters that parametrize a known family of probability distributions according to which the data are distributed. ::In other words, a sufficient statistic T(X) for a parameter Œ∏ is a statistic such that the conditional distribution of the data X, given T(X), does not depend on the parameter Œ∏. *A Rao‚ÄìBlackwell estimator Œ¥1(X) of an unobservable quantity Œ∏ is the conditional expected value E(Œ¥(X)  T(X)) of some estimator Œ¥(X) given a sufficient statistic T(X). Call Œ¥(X) the \\"original estimator\\" and Œ¥1(X) the \\"improved estimator\\". It is important that the improved estimator be observable, i.e. that it does not depend on Œ∏. Generally, the conditional expected value of one function of these data given another function of these data does depend on Œ∏, but the very definition of sufficiency given above entails that this one does not. *The mean squared error of an estimator is the expected value of the square of its deviation from the unobservable quantity being estimated. The theorem =Mean-squared-error version= One case of Rao‚ÄìBlackwell theorem states: :The mean squared error of the Rao‚ÄìBlackwell estimator does not exceed that of the original estimator. In other words, :\\\\operatorname{E}((\\\\delta_1(X)-\\\\theta)^2)\\\\leq \\\\operatorname{E}((\\\\delta(X)-\\\\theta)^2). The essential tools of the proof besides the definition above are the law of total expectation and the fact that for any random variable Y, E(Y2) cannot be less than [E(Y)]2. That inequality is a case of Jensen's inequality, although it may also be shown to follow instantly from the frequently mentioned fact that : 0 \\\\leq \\\\operatorname{Var}(Y) = \\\\operatorname{E}((Y-\\\\operatorname{E}(Y))^2) = \\\\operatorname{E}(Y^2)-(\\\\operatorname{E}(Y))^2. More precisely, the mean square error of the Rao-Blackwell estimator has the following decomposition : \\\\operatorname{E}[(\\\\delta_1(X)-\\\\theta)^2]=\\\\operatorname{E}[(\\\\delta(X)-\\\\theta)^2]-\\\\operatorname{E}[\\\\operatorname{Var}(\\\\delta(X)\\\\mid T(X))] Since \\\\operatorname{E}[\\\\operatorname{Var}(\\\\delta(X)\\\\mid T(X))]\\\\ge 0, the Rao-Blackwell theorem immediately follows. =Convex loss generalization= The more general version of the Rao‚ÄìBlackwell theorem speaks of the \\"expected loss\\" or risk function: :\\\\operatorname{E}(L(\\\\delta_1(X)))\\\\leq \\\\operatorname{E}(L(\\\\delta(X))) where the \\"loss function\\" L may be any convex function. If the loss function is twice-differentiable, as in the case for mean-squared-error, then we have the sharper inequality :\\\\operatorname{E}(L(\\\\delta(X)))-\\\\operatorname{E}(L(\\\\delta_1(X)))\\\\ge \\\\frac{1}{2}\\\\operatorname{E}_T\\\\left[\\\\inf_x L(x)\\\\operatorname{Var}(\\\\delta(X)\\\\mid T)\\\\right]. Properties The improved estimator is unbiased if and only if the original estimator is unbiased, as may be seen at once by using the law of total expectation. The theorem holds regardless of whether biased or unbiased estimators are used. The theorem seems very weak: it says only that the Rao‚ÄìBlackwell estimator is no worse than the original estimator. In practice, however, the improvement is often enormous. Example Phone calls arrive at a switchboard according to a Poisson process at an average rate of Œª per minute. This rate is not observable, but the numbers X1, ..., Xn of phone calls that arrived during n successive one-minute periods are observed. It is desired to estimate the probability e‚àíŒª that the next one-minute period passes with no phone calls. An extremely crude estimator of the desired probability is :\\\\delta_0=\\\\left\\\\\\\\{\\\\begin{matrix}1 & \\\\text{if}\\\\ X_1=0, \\\\\\\\\\\\ 0 & \\\\text{otherwise,}\\\\end{matrix}\\\\right. i.e., it estimates this probability to be 1 if no phone calls arrived in the first minute and zero otherwise. Despite the apparent limitations of this estimator, the result given by its Rao‚ÄìBlackwellization is a very good estimator. The sum : S_n = \\\\sum_{i=1}^n X_{i} = X_1+\\\\cdots+X_n can be readily shown to be a sufficient statistic for Œª, i.e., the conditional distribution of the data X1, ..., Xn, depends on Œª only through this sum. Therefore, we find the Rao‚ÄìBlackwell estimator :\\\\delta_1=\\\\operatorname{E}(\\\\delta_0\\\\mid S_n=s_n). After doing some algebra we have :\\\\begin{align} \\\\delta_1 &= \\\\operatorname{E} \\\\left (\\\\mathbf{1}_{\\\\\\\\{X_1=0\\\\\\\\}} \\\\Bigg \\\\sum_{i=1}^n X_{i} = s_n \\\\right ) \\\\\\\\\\\\ &= P \\\\left (X_{1}=0 \\\\Bigg \\\\sum_{i=1}^n X_{i} = s_n \\\\right ) \\\\\\\\\\\\ &= P \\\\left (X_{1}=0, \\\\sum_{i=2}^n X_{i} = s_n \\\\right ) \\\\times P \\\\left (\\\\sum_{i=1}^n X_{i} = s_n \\\\right )^{-1} \\\\\\\\\\\\ &= e^{-\\\\lambda}\\\\frac{\\\\left((n-1)\\\\lambda\\\\right)^{s_n}e^{-(n-1)\\\\lambda}}{s_n!} \\\\times \\\\left (\\\\frac{(n\\\\lambda)^{s_n}e^{-n\\\\lambda}}{s_n!} \\\\right )^{-1} \\\\\\\\\\\\ &= \\\\frac{\\\\left((n-1)\\\\lambda\\\\right)^{s_n}e^{-n\\\\lambda}}{s_n!} \\\\times \\\\frac{s_n!}{(n\\\\lambda)^{s_n}e^{-n\\\\lambda}} \\\\\\\\\\\\ &= \\\\left(1-\\\\frac{1}{n}\\\\right)^{s_n} \\\\end{align} Since the average number of calls arriving during the first n minutes is nŒª, one might not be surprised if this estimator has a fairly high probability (if n is big) of being close to :\\\\left(1-{1 \\\\over n}\\\\right)^{n\\\\lambda}\\\\approx e^{-\\\\lambda}. So Œ¥1 is clearly a very much improved estimator of that last quantity. In fact, since Sn is complete and Œ¥0 is unbiased, Œ¥1 is the unique minimum variance unbiased estimator by the Lehmann‚ÄìScheff√© theorem. Idempotence Rao‚ÄìBlackwellization is an idempotent operation. Using it to improve the already improved estimator does not obtain a further improvement, but merely returns as its output the same improved estimator. Completeness and Lehmann-Scheff√© minimum variance If the conditioning statistic is both complete and sufficient, and the starting estimator is unbiased, then the Rao-Blackwell estimator is the unique \\"best unbiased estimator\\": see Lehmann‚ÄìScheff√© theorem. An example of an improvable Rao‚ÄìBlackwell improvement, when using a minimal sufficient statistic that is not complete, was provided by Galili and Meilijson in 2016. Let X_1, \\\\ldots, X_n be a random sample from a scale-uniform distribution X \\\\sim U \\\\left( (1-k) \\\\theta, (1+k) \\\\theta \\\\right), with unknown mean E[X]=\\\\theta and known design parameter k \\\\in (0,1). In the search for \\"best\\" possible unbiased estimators for \\\\theta, it is natural to consider X_1 as an initial (crude) unbiased estimator for \\\\theta and then try to improve it. Since X_1 is not a function of T = \\\\left( X_{(1)}, X_{(n)} \\\\right), the minimal sufficient statistic for \\\\theta (where X_{(1)} = \\\\min( X_i ) and X_{(n)} = \\\\max( X_i )), it may be improved using the Rao‚ÄìBlackwell theorem as follows: :\\\\hat{\\\\theta}_{RB}=E_{\\\\theta} \\\\left [X_1X_{(1)}, X_{(n)} \\\\right ]=\\\\frac{X_{(1)}+X_{(n)}}{2}. However, the following unbiased estimator can be shown to have lower variance: :\\\\hat{\\\\theta}_{LV} = \\\\frac{1}{2 \\\\left (k^2 \\\\frac{n-1}{n+1}+1\\\\right )} \\\\left[ (1-k){{X}_{(1)}}+(1+k){{X}_{(n)}} \\\\right]. And in fact, it could be even further improved when using the following estimator: :\\\\hat{\\\\theta}_{BAYES} =\\\\frac{n+1}{n} \\\\left[ 1-\\\\frac{\\\\frac{\\\\left( \\\\frac{1-k} \\\\right)}{\\\\left( \\\\frac{1+k} \\\\right)}-1}{{{\\\\left[ \\\\frac{\\\\left( \\\\frac{1-k} \\\\right)}{\\\\left( \\\\frac{1+k} \\\\right)} \\\\right]}^{n+1}}-1} \\\\right] \\\\frac{X_{(n)}}{1+k} See also * Basu's theorem -- Another result on complete sufficient and ancillary statistics * C.

Lady Mary is today chiefly remembered for her letters, particularly her letters from travels to the Ottoman Empire, as wife to the British ambassador to Turkey, which Billie Melman described as \\"the very first example of a secular work by a woman about the Muslim Orient\\".Melman, Billie. Women's Orients: English Women and the Middle East, 1718‚Äì1918. University of Michigan Press. 1992. Print. Aside from her writing, Lady Mary is also known for introducing and advocating for smallpox inoculation to Britain after her return from Turkey. Her writings address and challenge the hindering contemporary social attitudes towards women and their intellectual and social growth. Early life Edward, by Jean-Baptiste van Mour Lady Mary Pierrepont was born on 15 May 1689 in at Holme Pierrepont Hall in Nottinghamshire and baptised on 26 May 1689 at St. Paul's Church in Covent Garden, London.Grundy, Isobel. Lady Mary Wortley Montague, p. 5. Oxford University Press, 1999. Print. She was the eldest child of Evelyn Pierrepont, 1st Duke of Kingston-upon-Hull (c.1655‚Äì1726), and his first wife Mary Feilding (d.1692), the only daughter of the third Earl of Denbigh (d.1692). Lady Mary had three younger siblings, two girls, Frances and Evelyn, and a boy, William. Lady Mary was a bright, free-spirited child who dreamed of greatness. She wrote in her diary, \\"I am going to write a history so uncommon.\\" Aged seven, members of the newly formed Kit-Cat Club, a group of fashionable men, nominated her as the subject of their toast to the beauty of the season, and they had her name engraved on the glass goblet used for this purpose. As a child, she had a \\"desire of catching the setting sun\\" and she would run across the meadow to \\"catch hold of the great golden ball of fire sinking on the horizon.\\" However, she then realized that this activity \\"was impossible.\\" Overall, the pursuit of achieving the impossible became a recurring pattern throughout her life. However, misfortune occurred. Her mother, who she thought would have supported her aspirations, died. Then her paternal grandmother Elizabeth Pierrepont raised Mary and her siblings until she died when Mary was eight years old. Then, after Mrs. Pierrepont's death, Mary was passed to the care of her father, who did not believe he was obliged to assist with her education. Education Mary Wortley Montagu's education was divided between a governess and the use of the library at the family property Thoresby Hall. According to Lady Mary, the governess gave her ‚Äòone of the worst [education] in the world‚Äô by teaching Lady Mary \\"superstitious tales and false notions.\\" To supplement the instruction of a despised governess, Lady Mary used the well-furnished library to \\"steal\\" her education by hiding in the library from 10am-2pm and \\"every afternoon from four to eight.\\" She taught herself Latin, a language usually reserved for men at the time. She secretly got a hold of a \\"Latin dictionary and grammar\\" and by the age of thirteen, her handling with the language was on par to most men. Furthermore, she was also a voracious reader. She jotted the list of characters and titles she read into a notebook. Some of the works she read included \\"plays of Beaumont and Fletcher, Dryden, Rowe, Lee Otway\\" and French and English romances, including \\"Grand Cyrus, Pharamond, Almahide, and Parthenissa.\\" By 1705, at the age of fourteen or fifteen, Mary Pierrepont had written two albums entitled \\"Poems, Songs &c;\\" filled with poetry, a brief epistolary novel, and a prose-and-verse romance modelled after Aphra Behn's Voyage to the Isle of Love (1684). She also corresponded with two bishops, Thomas Tenison and Gilbert Burnet, who supplemented the instruction of the governess. Overall, Mary impressed her father, who was not a scholar, with her progress.  Marriage and embassy to Ottoman Empire  = Engagement = By 1710, Lady Mary had two possible suitors to choose from: Edward Wortley Montagu (born 8 February 1678) and Clotworthy Skeffington.Grundy, Isobel. Lady Mary Wortley Montagu. Oxford University Press, 1999. Print. The friendship between Lady Mary and Edward Wortley Montagu, the son of Sidney Wortley Montagu, began through Edward's younger sister Anne Wortley. In London, Anne and Lady Mary met frequently at social functions and exchanged visits to each other's homes. They also communicated through writing, in which they filled their letters with \\"trivial gossip\\" and \\"effusive compliments.\\" After Anne died in November 1709, Lady Mary began conversing with Anne's brother Edward Wortley Montagu. Lady Mary often met Edward at \\"friends‚Äô houses\\" and \\"at Court.\\" On 28 March 1710, she wrote the first letter she addressed to Edward. Lady Mary corresponded with Edward Wortley Montagu via letters until 2 May 1711 without her father's permission. Keeping up with their communication became harder when Lady Mary's father bought a house at Acton, a suburban village famous for its mineral springs. Lady Mary hated the house because it was ‚Äòdull and disagreeable,‚Äô and it did not have a library in it. A few weeks after moving, Lady Mary had the measles, and she asked her maid to write Edward a letter to tell him about the illness. Soon, there were misunderstandings between Edward and Lady Mary. Edward hurried to Acton. There, he left a note, revealing his love: \\"I should be overjoyed to hear your Beauty is very much impaired, could I be pleased with anything that would give you displeasure, for it would lessen the number of Admirers.\\" In response, she scolded his indiscretion by saying, \\"Forgive and forget me.\\" Then, in his reply, Edward stated that \\"he would deal with her father if he were sure they could be happy together.\\" This reply helped Lady Mary forget her irritation. Lady Mary in Acton and Edward in London kept writing to each other until the early summer of 1710. Lady Mary's primary concern with her engagement was financial, not romantic. Lady Mary denied transient emotions guiding her life: \\"I can esteem, I can be a friend, but I don‚Äôt know whether I can love.\\" Then, after setting forth all her terms, including her deference, she warned to Edward that \\"Make no answer to this, if you can like me on my own terms\\" and that his proposals not be made for her. However, these correspondences soon endangered Edward. In one particular letter, Edward wrote, \\"Her being better in 1710, the consequence of its being known that I write to her.\\" A servant in Lady Mary's household found this letter and gave it to her father; this letter put her father \\"in the utmost rage.\\" However, Wortley was flattered that Lady Mary \\"had given the father as an ‚Äòan artifice to bring the affair to a proper conclusion.‚Äô\\" The next day, Wortley called Lady Mary‚Äôs father about a formal proposal. Mary's father, now Marquess of Dorchester had insisted on one condition in the marriage contract: \\"that Wortley‚Äôs estate be entailed on the first son born to him.\\" However, Wortley refused to do this as it would require ¬£10, 000. Consequently, in order to convince Lady Mary's father, Edward thought of publishing the marriage contract in the Tatler, a British journal. On the Tatler‚Äôs issue of 18 July, Wortley wrote the following: \\"Her first lover has ten to one against him. The very hour after he has opened his heart and his rent rolls he is made no other use of but to raise her price‚Ä¶While the poor lover very innocently waits, till the plenipotentiaries at the inns of court have debated about the alliance, all the partisans of the lady throw difficulties in the way, till other offers come in; and the man who came first is not put in possession, until she has been refused by half the town.\\" These arguments did not persuade Lord Dorchester. Even though these negotiations reached an impasse, Lady Mary and Edward continued corresponding with each other. In the end of March 1711, Lady Mary's father intended on her friendship with Wortley. Her father summoned her to a conference, forced her to promise to not to write, and hustled her to West Dean. However, Lady Mary broke her promise to tell Wortley about her rights and duty: \\"Had you had any real Affection for me, you would have long go applied yourself to him, from whose hand only you can receive me.\\" After their exchanges of disagreements and realizing she did not like him, he realized their friendship must end. On 2 May, he replied, \\"Adieu, Dearest L[ady] M[ary]. This once be assur‚Äôd you will not deceive me. I expect no answer.\\" Consequently, Lady Mary did not respond that summer. In that same summer, her father Lord Dorchester decided to find a husband other than Edward Wortley Montagu for his daughter. Lady Mary's father pressured her to marry Clotworthy Skeffington, the heir to the Irish Viscount Massereene. Skeffington's marriage contract included \\"an allowance of ¬£500 a year as ‚Äòpin- money,‚Äô and ¬£1,200 a year if he died.\\" However, she rejected him. Thus, to avoid marriage to Skeffington, she eloped with Montagu. In a letter to Wortley, she wrote, \\"He [my father] will have a thousand plausible reasons for being irreconcilable, and ‚Äòtis very probable the world will be on his side‚Ä¶I shall come to you with only a night-gown and petticoat, and that is all you will get with me. I told a lady of my friends what I intended to do. You will think her a very good friend when I tell you she has proffered to lend us her house if we would come there the first night‚Ä¶If you determine to go to that lady‚Äôs house, you had better come with a coach and six at seven o‚Äôclock to- morrow.\\" The marriage license is dated 17 August 1712, and the marriage probably took place on 23 August 1712 and the marriage occurred at Salisbury on 15 October 1712. = Early married life before travelling to the Ottoman Empire = Lady Mary Wortley Montagu and Edward Wortley Montagu spent the first years of their married life in England. She had a son, Edward Wortley Montagu the younger, named after his father Edward Wortley Montagu, on 16 May 1713, in London.Grundy, Isobel. Lady Mary Wortley Montagu. Oxford University Press, 1999. On 13 October 1714, her husband accepted the post of Junior Commissioner of the Treasury. When Lady Mary joined him in London, her wit and beauty soon made her a prominent figure at court. She was among the society of George I and the Prince of Wales, and counted amongst her friends Molly Skerritt, Lady Walpole, John, Lord Hervey, Mary Astell, Sarah Churchill, Duchess of Marlborough, Alexander Pope, John Gay, and Abb√© Antonio Schinella Conti. In December 1715, at the age of twenty-six, Lady Mary contracted smallpox. She survived, but while she was ill someone circulated the satirical \\"court eclogues\\" she had been writing. One of the poems was read as an attack on Caroline, Princess of Wales, in spite of the fact that the \\"attack\\" was voiced by a character who was herself heavily satirised. = Husband's assignment to Constantinople = Mary Wortley Montagu, by Charles Jervas, after 1716 In 1716, Edward Wortley Montagu was appointed Ambassador at Constantinople to negotiate an end to the Austro-Turkish War. In August 1716, Lady Mary accompanied him to Vienna, and thence to Adrianople and Constantinople. He was recalled in 1717, but they remained at Constantinople until 1718. While away from England, the Wortley Montagus had a daughter on 19 January 1718, who would grow up to be Mary, Countess of Bute. After an unsuccessful delegation between Austria and the Ottoman Empire, they set sail for England via the Mediterranean, and reached London on 2 October 1718. In the same year, Austrians and the Turkish signed the Treaty of Passarowitz at the conclusion of the Austro-Turkish War. The story of this voyage and of her observations of Eastern life is told in Letters from Turkey, a series of lively letters full of graphic descriptions; Letters is often credited as being an inspiration for subsequent female travelers and writers, as well as for much Orientalist art. During her visit she was sincerely charmed by the beauty and hospitality of the Ottoman women she encountered. She wrote about how different their fashion was in letters. In a letter to Lady Mar, she wrote: \\"They build certain fabrics of gauze on their heads, about a yard high, consisting of three or four stories, fortified with numberless yards of heavy ribbon‚Ä¶Their whalebone petticoats outdo ours by several yards‚Äô circumference, and cover some acres of ground.\\" Furthermore, she recorded her experiences in a Turkish bath, which are reserved for both diversion and health. In a letter, she wrote, \\"They [Ottoman women] generally take this diversion once a week, and stay there at least four or five hours, without getting cold immediately coming out of the hot bath into the cold room, which was surprising to me.\\" She also recorded a particularly amusing incident in which a group of Turkish women at a bath in Sofia, horrified by the sight of the stays she was wearing, exclaimed that \\"they believed I was so locked up in that machine that it was not in my own power to open it, which contrivance they attributed to my husband.\\" Lady Mary wrote about misconceptions of previous travelers, specifically male travelers, had recorded about the religion, traditions and the treatment of women in the Ottoman Empire. Her gender and class status provided her with access to female spaces that were closed off to males. Her personal interactions with Ottoman women enabled her to provide, in her view, a more accurate account of Turkish women, their dress, habits, traditions, limitations and liberties, at times irrefutably more a critique of the Occident than a praise of the Orient. Montagu also carefully constructed Ottoman female spaces, and her own engagement with Ottoman women, as full of homoerotic desire, which is consistent with the gender and sexual fluidity that characterized much of her life and writings.  Ottoman smallpox inoculation  Memorial to the Rt. Hon. Lady Mary Wortley Montagu erected in Lichfield Cathedral by Henrietta Inge. = Smallpox inoculation = In the 18th century, Europeans began an experiment known as inoculation or variolation to prevent, not cure the smallpox. Lady Mary Wortley Montagu defied convention, most memorably by introducing smallpox inoculation to Western medicine after witnessing it during her travels and stay in the Ottoman Empire. Previously, Lady Mary's brother had died of smallpox in 1713, and although Lady Mary recovered from the disease in 1715, it left her with a disfigured face. In the Ottoman Empire, she visited the women in their segregated zenanas, a house for Muslims and Hindus, making friends and learning about Turkish customs.Rosenhek, Jackie.Safe Smallpox InoculationsDoctor's Review: Medicine on the Move, Feb 2005. Web. 10 November 2015. Safe Smallpox Inoculations. There in March 1717, she witnessed the practice of inoculation against smallpox ‚Äì variolation ‚Äì which she called engrafting, and wrote home about it in a number of her letters. The most famous of these letters was her \\"Letter to a Friend\\" of 1 April 1717. Variolation used live smallpox virus in the pus taken from a mild smallpox blister and introduced it into scratched skin of the arm or leg (the most usual spots) of a previously uninfected person to promote immunity to the disease.Rosenhek, Jackie. Safe Smallpox Inoculations Doctor's Review: Medicine on the Move, Feb 2005. Web. 10 November 2015. Safe Smallpox Inoculations Consequently, the inoculate would developed a milder case of smallpox than the one he/she might have contracted. Lady Mary was eager to spare her children, thus, in March 1718 she had her nearly five-year-old son, Edward, inoculated there with the help of Embassy surgeon Charles Maitland. In fact, her son was the \\"first English person to undergo the operation.\\" In a letter to a friend in England, Montagu wrote, \\"There is a set of old women [here], who make it their business to perform the operation, every autumn‚Ä¶when then great heat is abated‚Ä¶thousands undergo this operation...[and there] is not one example of anyone that has died in it.\\" Afterwards, she updated the status of Edward to her husband: \\"The Boy was engrafted last Tuesday, and is at this time singing and playing, and very impatient for his supper. I pray God my next may give as good an account of him.\\" On her return to London, she enthusiastically promoted the procedure, but encountered a great deal of resistance from the medical establishment, because it was an Oriental folk treatment process. In April 1721, when a smallpox epidemic struck England, she had her daughter inoculated by Maitland, the same physician who had inoculated her son at the Embassy in Turkey, and publicised the event. This was the first such operation done in Britain. She persuaded Caroline of Ansbach, the Princess of Wales, to test the treatment. In August 1721, seven prisoners at Newgate Prison awaiting execution were offered the chance to undergo variolation instead of execution: they all survived and were released. Despite this, controversy over smallpox inoculation intensified. However Caroline, Princess of Wales, was convinced of its value. The Princess's two daughters Amelia and Caroline were successfully inoculated in April 1722 by French-born surgeon Claudius Amyand.Lady Mary Wortley Montagu: Selected Letters. Ed. Isobel Grundy. Penguin Books, 1997. Print. In response to the general fear of inoculation, Lady Mary, under a pseudonym, wrote and published an article describing and advocating in favour of inoculation in September 1722. Later, other royal families soon followed Montagu's act. For instance, in 1768, Catherine the Great of Russia had herself and her son, the future Tsar Paul, inoculated. The Russians continued to refine the process. Nevertheless, inoculation was not always a safe process; inoculates developed a real case of smallpox and could infect others. The inoculation resulted in a \\"small number of deaths and complications, including serious infections.\\" Subsequently, Edward Jenner, who was 13 years old when Lady Mary died in 1762, developed the much safer technique of vaccination using cowpox instead of smallpox. Jenner's method involves \\"engrafting lymph taken from a pustulate of cowpox on the hand of a milkmaid into the arm of an inoculate.\\" Jenner first tested his method on James Phipps, an eight-year-old boy, and when Phipps did not have any reaction after the procedure, Jenner claimed that his procedure \\"bestowed immunity against smallpox.\\" Then, after spending the next few years experimenting his new procedure, he discovered that his hypothesis was correct. In 1919, while the world elite battled the newly elected people's government in Russia, mandatory vaccination was introduced here. The Russians largely eradicated smallpox by 1936. As vaccination gained acceptance, variolation gradually fell out of favour. In May 1958, during 11th World Health Assembly at WHO Headquarters in Geneva, Prof. V.M. Zhdanov, the Deputy Minister of Public Health of the Soviet Union, and a well-known virologist and epidemiologist, proposed a program for global smallpox eradication and substantiated its feasibility. It would only be in 1967, that the World Health Organization embarked on a worldwide campaign to get rid of smallpox, and then, ten years later, smallpox was eradicated. Overall, Lady Mary Wortley Montagu's introduction of smallpox vaccination eventually led to the development of vaccines and later the eradication of smallpox.  Later years  Alexander Pope declared his love to Lady Mary, who responded with laughter. After returning to England, Lady Mary took less interest in court compared to her earlier years. Instead, she was more focused on the upbringing of her children, reading, writing and editing her travel letters‚Äîwhich she then chose not to publish. Before starting for the East, Lady Mary Wortley Montagu had met Alexander Pope, and during her Embassy travels with her husband, they wrote each other a series of letters. While Pope may have been fascinated by her wit and elegance, Lady Mary's replies to his letters reveal that she was not equally smitten. Very few letters passed between them after Lady Mary's return to England, and various reasons have been suggested for the subsequent estrangement. In 1728, Pope attacked Lady Mary in his Dunciad, which inaugurated a decade in which most of his publications made some sort of allegation against her. Lady Mary went through a series of trials with her children. In 1726 and 1727, Lady Mary's son Edward ran away from Westminster School several times. He was then entrusted to a tutor with strict orders to keep him abroad. In later years, her son managed to return to England without permission and continued to have a strained relationship with both his parents. In the summer of 1736, Lady Mary's daughter fell in love with John Stuart, 3rd Earl of Bute, but he had little fortune; Lady Mary warned her daughter about the disadvantages of living in poverty.In August 1736, Lady Mary's daughter married John Stuart, 3rd Earl of Bute, despite her parents' disapproval of the match. Later, Lady Mary wrote to Lord Gower, 1st Earl Gower, about her daughter's disobedience. In response, Lord Gower tried to console Lady Mary: \\"I hope by her future conducts she will atone for her past, and that choice will prove more happy than you and Mr. Wortley expect.\\"In the same year, Mary met and fell in love with Count Francesco Algarotti, who competed with an equally smitten John Hervey for her affections.Rictor Norton, \\"John, Lord Hervey: The Third Sex\\", The Great Queers of History. 8 August 2009. Web. 10 November 2015.. Lady Mary wrote many letters to Francesco Algarotti in English and in French after his departure from England in September 1736. In July 1739, Lady Mary departed England without her husband ostensibly for health reasons, possibly from a disfiguring skin disease, and declared her intentions to winter in the south of France; after she left England, she and her husband never met again. In reality, she left to visit and live with Algarotti in Venice. Their relationship ended in 1741 after Lady Mary and Algarotti were both on a diplomatic mission in Turin. Lady Mary stayed abroad and travelled extensively. After travelling to Venice, Florence, Rome, Genoa and Geneva, she finally settled in Avignon in 1742. She left Avignon in 1746 for Brescia, where she fell ill and stayed for nearly a decade, leaving for Lovere in 1754. In the summer of 1756, Lady Mary travelled to Venice for an undisclosed business errand. After August 1756, she resided in Venice and Padua and saw Algarotti again in November. Throughout the time, Lady Mary exchanged letters with her daughter, Lady Bute, discussing topics such as philosophy, literature, and the education of girls, as well as conveying details of her geographical and social surroundings. Mary Wortley Montagu in 1739 Lady Mary received news of her husband Edward Wortley Montagu's death on 1 January 1761, and he was buried at Wortley. As soon as she learned of her husband's death, Lady Mary left Venice for England. She had a self-imposed exile because of her strained relationship with Edward, but her return made sense because she wanted to see her daughter and her grandchildren before she died. On 1 September 1761, she began her journey back home; she decided to go through Germany and Holland because France, which was deemed the easier route, was at war. However, the journey was dangerous and exhausting. When she reached Augsburg on 1 October, she wrote to Sir James and Lady Francis Steuart that \\"she hoped to meet them in Holland.\\" She recorded her perils and fatigues to Sir James in a letter: \\"I am dragging my ragged remnant of life to England. The wind and the tide are against me; how far I have strength to struggle against both, I know not.\\" While detained at Rotterdam, she handed her Embassy Letters to the Reverend Benjamin Sowden of Rotterdam, for safe keeping and \\"to be dispos'd of as he thinks proper.\\" After she left Rotterdam on 12 December, a hard, impenetrable frost hindered her voyage. Towards the end of the month, she sailed for England, but a mountainous sea obstructed the passage and the captain returned to harbor. On the next attempt a few days later, Lady Mary reached London in January 1762. After arriving in London, Lady Mary rented a house in Great George Street, Hanover Square, and her daughter and grandchildren often visited her. In June 1762, it became known that Lady Mary was suffering from cancer. Even though she tried to conceal her illness from her family as long as possible, she grew rapidly weaker that month. She wrote her last letter but with difficulty on 2 July to Lady Frances Steuart; in this letter, she wrote \\"I have been ill a long time, and am now so bad I am little capable of writing, but I would not pass in your opinion as either stupid or ungrateful. My heart is always warm in your service, and I am always told your affairs shall be taken care of.\\" Lady Frances's son was in London, and when he visited Lady Mary's house, he was summoned to her bedroom where he was surrounded by her relatives, including Lord and Lady Bute. Then, Lady Mary ordered her relatives to leave the room and told Lady Frances's son, \\"My dear young friend has come to see me before I die, and I desire to be left alone with him.\\" She died on 21 August 1762 at her house in Great George Street and was later buried in Grosvenor Chapel the day after she died.  Important works and literary place  Lady Montagu in Turkish Dress by Jean-√âtienne Liotard, ca. 1756, Palace on the Water in Warsaw Although Lady Mary Wortley Montagu is now best known for her Embassy Letters, she wrote poetry and essays as well.Backscheider, Paula R., and Catherine E. Ingrassia, eds. British Women Poets of the Long Eighteenth Century. Baltimore, Maryland: The Johns Hopkins University Press, 2009. 880. Print. A number of Lady Mary's poems and essays were printed in her lifetime, either without or with her permission, in newspapers, in miscellanies, and independently. Mary Astell convinced Montagu to publish her letters, which later became known as Embassy Letters. Montagu did not intend to publish her poetry, but it did circulate widely, in manuscript, among members of her own social circle.Bowles, Emliy. Montagu, Lady Mary Wortley. The Encyclopedia of British Literature 1660‚Äì1789. Eds. Gary Day and Jack Lynch. Blackwell Publishing, 2015. Lady Mary was highly suspicious of any idealizing literary language.Staves, Susan.

She wrote most often in heroic couplets, a serious poetic form to employ, and, according to Susan Staves, \\"excelled at answer poems\\". Some of her widely anthologized poems include \\"Constantinople\\" and \\"Epistle from Mrs. Yonge to her Husband.\\" \\"Constantinople,\\" written January 1718, is a beautiful poem in heroic couplets describing Britain and Turkey through human history, and representing the states of mind \\"of knaves, coxcombs, the mob, and party zealous‚Äîall characteristic of the London of her time\\".Backscheider, Paula R., and Catherine E.

Ingrassia, eds. British Women Poets of the Long Eighteenth Century. Baltimore, Maryland: The Johns Hopkins University Press, 2009. 171. Print. In 1737 and 1738, Lady Mary published anonymously a political periodical called the Nonsense of Common-Sense, supporting the Robert Walpole government. The title was a reference to a journal of the liberal opposition entitled Common Sense. She wrote six Town Eclogues and other poems. She wrote notable letters describing her travels through Europe and the Ottoman Empire; these appeared after her death in three volumes. Lady Mary corresponded with Anne Wortley and wrote courtship letters to her future husband Edward Wortley Montagu, as well as love letters to Francesco Algarotti. She corresponded with notable writers, intellectuals and aristocrats of her day. She wrote gossip letters and letters berating the vagaries of fashionable people to her sister, Lady Mar, the daughter of the Whig Duke of Kingston. They met when the Wortleys visited Paris, France on 29 September 1718. During her visit, Montagu observed the beauties and behaviors of Parisian women. She wrote \\"their hair cut short and curled round their faces, loaded with powder that makes it look like white wool!\\" In one of their correspondences, Lady Mary informed her sister of the ‚Äòsurprising death‚Äô of her father. Furthermore, they exchanged intellectual letters with Montagu's only daughter, Lady Bute. Lady Mary and Lady Mar discontinued their correspondence in 1727. During the twentieth century Lady Mary's letters were edited separately from her essays, poems and plays. Although not published during her lifetime, her letters from Turkey were clearly intended for print. She revised them extensively and gave a transcript to the Reverend Benjamin Sowden, a British clergyman, in Rotterdam in 1761. Sowden also lent the book to two English travelers, including Thomas Becket. Furthermore, during that night, the travelers made copies of her letters. After the travelers returned the book, Sowden handed the book to Lord Bute, the husband of Lady Mary's only daughter, in exchange for two hundred pounds. In 1763 in London, the year after Montagu's death, Becket and De Hondt published this error-laden version manuscript in three volumes, entitled Letters of the Right Honourable Lady My W‚Äîy M----e: Written, during her Travels in Europe, Asia and Africa, to Persons of Distinction, Men of Letters, &c.; in different Parts of Europe; Which contain, Among other curious Relations, Accounts of the Policy and Manners of the Turks, commonly referred to as the Embassy Letters or Turkish Embassy Letters because it was \\"composed during and after Montagu‚Äôs journey through Europe to Constantinople in the company of her husband.\\" The first edition of the book sold out; in fact, the Critical Review newspaper editor, Tobias Smollett, wrote that the letters were \\"never equaled by any letter-writer of any sex, age or nation\\" and Voltaire also had high praise of these letters. Four years later in 1767, editor John Cleland added five spurious letters, along with previous printed essays and verses, to the previous edition of the book. Despite the immediate success following the publication of Turkish Embassy Letters, Lady Bute was furious and worried about how an unauthorized publication would impact the family's reputation. One of the manuscript volumes that others found was Lady Mary's famous diary, and Lady Bute did not have any knowledge of this existence until a few days before her mother's death. After she received these volumes, Lady Bute \\"kept it always under lock and key, and though she often looked over it herself, and read passages aloud to her daughters and friends, excepting the first five or six copy-books, which at a late period, she permitted Lady Louisa Stuart to peruse alone, upon condition that nothing should be transcribed.\\" Lady Louisa Stuart, the youngest of Lady Bute's daughters, was scolded for reading books and wanting to be like her grandmother. Later, Lady Louisa followed her grandmother's footsteps and became a writer. Then when Lady Bute felt that the end of her life was near, in 1794, she burnt the diary that her mother kept since her marriage. She chose to burn the diary because Lady Bute always spoke to her mother with great respect, and she feared the possibility of a scandal. According to O'Quinn, although The Turkish Embassy Letters has been considered one of the best literary works published in the eighteenth century, the work has not been as appreciated as those published by her male peers, such as Alexander Pope and Horace Walpole. She was the \\"target of vicious attacks\\" from printing presses and male peers. Although she describes her travels through Europe to the Ottoman Empire in The Turkish Embassy Letters to her correspondents, very few of the letters survived, and the letters in the book may not be accurate transcriptions of the actual correspondence. According to Daniel O'Quinn, the book was not a culmination of facts but of opinions, and there must be some filtering during the editing processes. Furthermore, to avoid public censure, Montagu used pseudonyms, such as \\"a Turkey merchant\\" and \\"Lady President, in her publications. Lastly, Montagu‚Äôs The Turkish Embassy Letters was published posthumously-Walpole affirmed that it was Montagu‚Äôs deathbed wish to get the letters published. An important early letter was published, probably without Montagu's consent, titled \\"The Genuine Copy of a Letter Written From Constantinople by an English Lady\\" in 1719. Both in this letter and in the Turkish Embassy Letters more broadly, particularly in the letters about the scholar Achmet Beg, Montagu participates in a wider English dialogue on Enlightenment ideas about religion, particularly deism, and their overlap with Islamic theology. Montagu, along with many others, including the freethinking scholar Henry Stubbe, celebrated Islam for what they saw as its rational approach to theology, for its strict monotheism, and for its teaching and practice around religious tolerance. In short, Montagu and other thinkers in this tradition saw Islam as a source of Enlightenment, as evidenced in her calling the Qur'an \\"the purest morality delivered in the very best language\\" By comparison, Montagu dedicated large portions of the Turkish Embassy Letters to criticizing Catholic religious practices, particularly Catholic beliefs around sainthood, miracles, and religious relics, which she frequently excoriated. In relation to these practices, she wrote, \\"I cannot fancy there is anything new in letting you know that priests can lie, and the mob believe all over the world.\\" A painting by Jean Auguste Dominique Ingres that was inspired by Mary Wortley Montagu's detailed descriptions of nude Oriental beauties Montagu's Turkish letters were to prove an inspiration to later generations of European women travellers and writers. In particular, Montagu staked a claim to the authority of women's writing, due to their ability to access private homes and female-only spaces where men were not permitted. The title of her published letters is \\"Sources that Have Been Inaccessible to Other Travellers.\\" The letters themselves frequently draw attention to the fact that they present a different, and Montagu asserts more accurate description than that provided by previous (male) travellers: \\"You will perhaps be surpriz'd at an Account so different from what you have been entertained with by the common Voyage-writers who are very fond of speaking of what they don't know.\\" In general, Montagu dismisses the quality of European travel literature of the 18th century as nothing more than \\"trite observations‚Ä¶superficial‚Ä¶[of] boys [who] only remember where they met with the best wine or the prettiest women.\\" Montagu writes about the \\"warmth and civility\\" of Ottoman women. She describes the hammam, a Turkish bath, \\"as a space of urbane homosociality, free of cruel satire and disdain.\\" She mentions that \\"hammam are remarkable for their undisguised admiration of the women's beauty and demeanor,\\" which creates a space for female authority. Montagu provides an intimate description of the women's bathhouse in Sofia, in which she derides male descriptions of the bathhouse as a site for unnatural sexual practices, instead insisting that it was \\"the Women's coffee house, where all the news of the Town is told, Scandal invented, etc.\\" Montagu's reference to \\"women's coffee house\\" represents the political and social freedom that women had access to in the Ottoman Empire during the 18th century. Even though Montagu refused to undress for the bath at first, the girls managed to persuade her and \\"open my shirt, and show them my stays, which satisfied them very well. In one letter to her sister Lady Mar, she wrote, \\"nothing will surprise you more than the sight of my person, as I am now in my Turkish habit.\\" However, Montagu's detailed descriptions of nude Oriental beauties provided inspiration for male artists such as Ingres, who depicted the explicitly erotic content that Montagu had criticized. During Montagu's time in the Ottoman Empire, she saw and wrote extensively concerning the practise of slavery along with the treatment of slaves by the Turks. Montagu wrote many letters with approving descriptions of the various slaves that she saw in the elite circles of Istanbul, including eunuchs and large collections of serving and dancing girls dressed in expensive outfits. In one of her letters written back home, famously from the interior of a bath house, she dismisses the idea that slaves of the Ottoman elite should be figures to be pitied. In response to her visit to the slave market in Istanbul, she wrote \\"you will imagine me half a Turk when I don't speak of it with the same horror other Christians have done before me, but I cannot forbear applauding the humanity of the Turks to those creatures. They are never ill-used, and their slavery is in my opinion no worse than servitude all over the world.\\" She did not write about African slavery in the Western world, but the Jonathan Richardson the Younger portrait that depicts Montagu accompanied by a young black slave boy in a golden collar who holds an umbrella shows that she was intimately familiar with and participated in the tradition in which European aristocracy owned young black servants and used them as part of their social equipage. Mary Wortley Montagu in Turkish dress. The title page of Lady Mary Wortley Montagu's The Letters and Works of Lady Mary Wortley Montagu, published in 1837 Montagu's Turkish letters were frequently cited by Western female travellers, more than a century after her journey. Such writers cited Montagu's assertion that women travellers could gain an intimate view of Turkish life that was not available to their male counterparts. However, they also added corrections or elaborations to her observations. In 1739, a book was printed by an unknown author under the pseudonym \\"Sophia, a person of quality\\", titled Woman not Inferior to Man. This book is often attributed to Lady Mary.South American Independence: Gender, Politics, Text. Eds. Catherine Davies, Claire Brewster, and Hilary Owen. Liverpool University Press, 2006. 29.Print. Her Letters and Works were published in 1837. Montagu's octogenarian granddaughter Lady Louisa Stuart contributed to this, anonymously, an introductory essay called Biographical Anecdotes of Lady M. W. Montagu, from which it was clear that Stuart was troubled by her grandmother's focus on sexual intrigues and did not see Lady Mary Wortley Montagu's Account of the Court of George I at his Accession as history. However, Montagu's historical observations, both in the \\"Anecdotes\\" and the Turkish Embassy Letters, prove quite accurate when put in context.Looser, Devoney.

He was the son of the diplomat and Member of Parliament Edward Wortley Montagu and the writer and traveller Lady Mary Wortley Montagu, whose talent and eccentricity he seems to have inherited. In 1716, he was taken by his parents to Constantinople, and at Pera in March 1716-17 was inoculated for smallpox, the first native of the United Kingdom to undergo this medical procedure. On the return of his parents to England in 1718, he was placed at Westminster School, from which he ran away more than once. On the first occasion, in July 1726, he was traced to Oxford, and was with difficulty 'reduced to the humble condition of a school-boy.' He decamped again in August 1727 and was not recovered for some months. Two similar escapades are mentioned by his tutor, Forster, chaplain to the Duchess of Kingston, but without dates. The first ended in his discovery, after a year's absence, selling fish in Blackwall. The second time, he worked his passage out to Oporto, deserted, went up country, and found employment in the vineyards, but returning to Oporto in charge of some asses, he was arrested at the instance of the British consul, brought back to his ship, identified and restored to his parents by the master. He was then sent to travel with a tutor in the West Indies, and afterwards with a keeper to the Netherlands. He made a serious study of Arabic at Leiden in 1741 and returned many years later to prosecute his studies. His father made him a meagre allowance, and he was heavily encumbered with debt. He served in the British army from 1743 to 1748, first as a cornet in the 7th Dragoon Guards and later as a captain-lieutenant in the 1st Regiment of Foot. He fought at the Battle of Fontenoy. He left the army in 1748. He thereafter traveled in various parts for many years, writing brief diary notes of his travels along with occasional sketches; and finally returned to his studies in 1769.

He was Member of Parliament (MP) for Huntingdonshire in 1747 and was one of the secretaries at the conference of Aix-la-Chapelle that closed the War of the Austrian Succession in 1748. In 1751, he was involved in a disreputable gaming quarrel in Paris; arrested for cheating a Jew at cards and then robbing him when he refused to pay;Jeremy Black, The British and the Grand Tour, 1985, p. 118. and was imprisoned for eleven days in the Ch√¢telet. He was cleared after the first court hearing before the decision was overturned by the Parlement of Paris, and he was ordered to pay a fine of 300 livres. He continued to sit in parliament, and wrote Reflections on the Rise and Fall of the Antient Republics ... (1759). Whilst in Italy, he designed and published a detailed map of the Ambracian Gulf and the island of Lefkas in northwestern Greece.The map seems to have been based on a large manuscript map of the same area drawn in 1757 by Girolamo Delanges and held in the Marciana Library in Venice. See Nikos D. Karabelas, In Charta. Prints of Preveza, Preveza, 2006, p. viii. His father left him an annuity of ¬£1000, the bulk of the property going to his sister Lady Bute. He set out for extended travel in the East, and George Romney described him as living in the Turkish manner at Venice. Fluent in Hebrew, Arabic, Chaldaic, and Persian, he was also an excellent orator. His family thought him mad, and his mother left him a single guinea in her will, but her annuity devolved on him at her death. He died at Padua in Italy.

Stroke volume is calculated using measurements of ventricle volumes from an echocardiogram and subtracting the volume of the blood in the ventricle at the end of a beat (called end-systolic volume ) from the volume of blood just prior to the beat (called end-diastolic volume). The term stroke volume can apply to each of the two ventricles of the heart, although it usually refers to the left ventricle. The stroke volumes for each ventricle are generally equal, both being approximately 70 mL in a healthy 70-kg man. Stroke volume is an important determinant of cardiac output, which is the product of stroke volume and heart rate, and is also used to calculate ejection fraction, which is stroke volume divided by end- diastolic volume. Because stroke volume decreases in certain conditions and disease states, stroke volume itself correlates with cardiac function. Calculation Its value is obtained by subtracting end-systolic volume (ESV) from end- diastolic volume (EDV) for a given ventricle. :SV = EDV - ESV In a healthy 70-kg man, ESV is approximately 50 mL and EDV is approximately 120mL, giving a difference of 70 mL for the stroke volume. \\"Stroke work\\" refers to the work, or pressure of the blood (\\"P\\") multiplied by the stroke volume. ESV and EDV are fixed variables. Heart rate and Stroke Volume are unfixed. Determinants Major factors influencing stroke volume ‚Äì Multiple factors impact preload, afterload, and contractility, and are the major considerations influencing SV. Men, on average, have higher stroke volumes than women due to the larger size of their hearts. However, stroke volume depends on several factors such as heart size, contractility, duration of contraction, preload (end-diastolic volume), and afterload. =Exercise= Prolonged aerobic exercise training may also increase stroke volume, which frequently results in a lower (resting) heart rate. Reduced heart rate prolongs ventricular diastole (filling), increasing end-diastolic volume, and ultimately allowing more blood to be ejected. =Preload= Stroke volume is intrinsically controlled by preload (the degree to which the ventricles are stretched prior to contracting). An increase in the volume or speed of venous return will increase preload and, through the Frank‚ÄìStarling law of the heart, will increase stroke volume. Decreased venous return has the opposite effect, causing a reduction in stroke volume. =Afterload= Elevated afterload (commonly measured as the aortic pressure during systole) reduces stroke volume. Though not usually affecting stroke volume in healthy individuals, increased afterload will hinder the ventricles in ejecting blood, causing reduced stroke volume. Increased afterload may be found in aortic stenosis and arterial hypertension. =Stroke volume index= Similar to cardiac index, stroke volume index is a method of relating the stroke volume (SV) to the size of the person Body surface area (BSA).

Originally publishing under her first married name, Helen Ferguson, she adopted the name Anna Kavan in 1939, not only as a nom de plume but as her legal identity. Biography =Early life= Anna Kavan was born Helen Emily Woods in Cannes, South of France, the only child of a wealthy British family.Brian Aldiss, \\"In Memoriam\\", p249 Her parents travelled frequently and Kavan grew up in Europe and the United States. As an adult she remembered her childhood as lonely and neglected. Her father died by suicide in 1911. After his death, Kavan returned to the UK where she was a boarder at Parsons Mead School in Ashstead and Malvern College in Worcestershire. Disregarding her daughter's desire to go to Oxford, her mother arranged an encounter with her former lover, Donald Ferguson. Helen Emily Woods married him in 1920, a few months before he took a position with the Railway Company in Burma. She moved with her husband, began to write and gave birth to her son Bryan. In 1923, Kavan left Ferguson and returned with her son to the UK. These biographical events match the underlying narrative of her initial Bildungsroman Let Me Alone (1930) while Who Are You? (1963), written in a Nouveau Roman style, is an experimental variation of her time in Burma. Living alone in London during the mid-1920s, she began studying painting at the London Central School of Arts and Crafts, and continued to paint throughout her life. Kavan regularly travelled to the French Riviera where she was introduced to heroin by racing car drivers she took up with.Ironside Virginia, \\"Julia and the Bazooka\\" Peter Owen Publishers reprint 2007, introduction. In 1928 she divorced Ferguson and married an artist named Stuart Edmonds whom she had met near Toulon. They travelled together through France, Italy, Spain and the Pyrenees before resettling in England. A year later, she published her first novel, A Charmed Circle, under the name Helen Ferguson, followed by five more books over the next eight years. Sanatorium Bellevue : a part of the glass menagerie, the mirror of madness Kavan and Edmonds had a daughter, Margaret, who died soon after childbirth and they then adopted a child whom they named Susanna.Jennifer Strum, Anna Kavan's New Zealand, Random House 2009 (p16) In 1938, when her second marriage ended, she attempted suicide and was admitted to a clinic in Switzerland. These were the first of what would be multiple hospitalizations and asylum incarcerations throughout Kavan's life for both depression and her lifelong heroin addiction. =As Anna Kavan= Asylum Piece (1940), a collection of short stories which explored the inner mindscape of the psychological explorer, was her first book under the name Anna Kavan, heroine of her previous novels Let Me Alone (1930) and A Stranger Still (1935). All subsequent works would feature a radically altered writing style. From that moment, the brunette Ferguson disappeared and the crystal-blond Kavan set about a career as an avant-garde writer using her legal name in the United States. An inveterate traveller, Kavan initiated a long journey at the outset of World War II. From September 1939 to February 1943, she spent six months in Carmel-by-the-Sea, California in 1940 ; it inspired her novella My Soul in China, published posthumously in 1975.Jennifer Sturm, Anna Kavan's New Zealand, Random House 2009, (p19) She also visited the island of Bali, Indonesia, and stayed for twenty-two months in Napier, New Zealand, her final destination. Her travel itinerary was complicated by the war, which severely restricted many ordinary boat routes. As a consequence, her path took her through New York City three times and the Suez Canal twice. Returning to England early 1943, she worked briefly with soldiers suffering from war neurosis at the Mill Hill Emergency Hospital and studied for a diploma in Psychological Medicine. She also took a secretarial position at Horizon, an influential literary magazine edited by Cyril Connolly and founded by Peter Watson, one of her friends. She contributed with stories, articles and reviews from 1944 to 1946. In 1944, Kavan's son from her first marriage was killed and she finalized her divorce from her second husband. After her return to the UK, Kavan began treatment with the German psychiatrist . He became Kavan's close friend and sometime creative collaborator until his death in 1964. They co- wrote The Horse's Tale (1949) and Kavan dedicated several short stories to her doctor published in the posthumous collection Julia and the Bazooka (1970). It was Bluth who arranged for Kavan to be treated at , a modern clinic where important psychiatric advances were made (1857‚Äì1980). There, Kavan received treatment from Ludwig Binswanger, a psychiatrist, pioneer in the field of existential psychology and lifelong friend of Freud. Kavan continued to undergo sporadic inpatient treatments for heroin addiction and in her later years in London lived as a virtual recluse. She enjoyed a late triumph in 1967 with her novel Ice, inspired by her time in New Zealand and the country's proximity to the inhospitable frozen landscape of Antarctica. The original manuscript was titled The Cold World. When her publisher Peter Owen sent Kavan his initial response, neither rejecting nor accepting her text, he described it as a cross between Kafka and The Avengers.David Callard, The Case of Anna Kavan, biography published by Peter Owen, 1992. This post-apocalyptic novel brought critical acclaim. It is her best-known novel, still puzzling the reader for its strangeness and nowadays rather introduced as a slipstream novel than a science fiction one. The first six of her novels gave little indication of the experimental and disturbing nature of her later work published after her detox treatment. Asylum Piece definitely heralded the new style and content of Kavan's writing. Her development of \\"nocturnal language\\".Ana√Øs Nin, The Novel of the Future published by Mcmillan, 1968. involved the lexicon of dreams and addiction, mental instability and alienation. She has been compared to Djuna Barnes, Virginia Woolf, and Sylvia Plath. Brian Aldiss described her as Kafka's sister.Brian Aldiss, The Detached Retina : aspects of SF and Fantasy published Syracuse University Press, 1995. Ana√Øs Nin was an admirer and unsuccessfully pursued a correspondence with Kavan. =Death and legacy= Kavan's House in Peel Street London Although popularly supposed to have died of heroin overdose, Kavan died of heart failure at her home in Kensington and was found dead on 5 December 1968. The previous night she had failed to attend a reception in honor of Ana√Øs Nin at the home of her London-based publisher Peter Owen.Emily Hill, A Novel Approach, interview with Peter Owen for Dazed & Confused, 2010 :\\"The author of Ice, who died in 1968 with enough heroin stockpiled in her house to kill the whole street, did so on the night she was expected at one of Peter Owen‚Äôs parties. When the police broke in the door, they found the gold invitation, so Owen was the first person they called. \\"I didn‚Äôt realise at the time that I was dealing with a really major writer who would become a cult figure\\", Owen admits. \\". Many of her works were published posthumously, some edited by her friend and legatee, the Welsh writer Rhys Davies. London-based Peter Owen Publishers have been long-serving advocates of Kavan's work and continue to keep her work in print. Doris Lessing, J.G. Ballard, Ana√Øs Nin, Jean Rhys, Brian Aldiss, Christopher Priest, Nina Allan, Virginia Ironside and Maggie Gee are among the writers who have praised her work. In 2009The society was founded by Victoria Walker who achieved her PhD 'The Fiction of Anna Kavan' at Queen Mary, University of London in 2012. the Anna Kavan Society was founded in London with the aim of encouraging wider readership and increasing academic scholarship of Kavan's work. Kavan's paintings have been recently exhibited at the Zarrow Art Center in Tulsa, Oklahoma. The Unconventional Anna Kavan: Works on PaperKristina Rosenthal, Announcement: Anna Kavan at the Zarrow Art Center 23 October 2014 :\\"Based upon her formal training at the Central London School of Arts and Crafts in \\"design theory\\", Kavan‚Äôs technique places each current painting in the context of earlier pieces. It mirrored her creative approach to first experience a relationship, emotion, or life situation then make a work of art that marked that experience. She considered these memorials a justification for having lived.\\" . exhibition displayed thirty-six paintings created by Kavan drawn from the McFarlin Library Special Collections, University of Tulsa.

It also shows how women today conduct their own explorations of mind and imagination in challenging works of art. traced key moments in the history of hysteria and counterpointed these with women's inventive art. Modern scholarship and interpretations In September 2014, the Anna Kavan Society organized a one-day symposium at the Institute of English Studies in association with Liverpool John Moores University Research Centre for Literature and Cultural History and Peter Owen Publishers. The Anna Kavan Symposium brought together scholars and writers to historicize Kavan's work (from the post-colonial aspects of Kavan's fiction and journalism to the interwar and World War II period), situate her within the literary and intellectual context of her times, and chart her legacy as a writer. =Feminist readings= On Ice and protofeminism, L.Timmel Duchamp said \\"First published in 1967, on the eve of the second wave of feminism, Ice has never been regarded as a significant work of proto-feminist literature, although scholars occasionally include it on lists of sf by women written before the major works of feminist sf burst onto the scene in the 1970s. The novel's surrealist form demands a different sort of reading than that of science fiction driven by narrative causality, but the text's obsessive insistence on linking the global political violence of the Cold War with the threateningly lethal sexual objectification of Woman and depicting them as two poles of the same suicidal collective will to destroy life makes Ice an interesting feminist literary experiment.\\"L Timmel Duchamp, What's the Story? Reading Anna Kavan's Ice, LCRW14:http://www.lcrw.net/fictionplus/duchampkavan.htm =Genre-bending and experimental writing= Kavan's reception as a 'woman writer' has been complicated by her perceived lack of attention to gender politics, and her fiction has most often been interpreted as autobiography rather than experimental and aesthetic writing. Kavan's work is difficult to situate in fixed literary categories; the scope of her work shows her experimenting with realism, surrealism and absurdism. Her work often abandons linear plot and narrative structure and portrays nameless landscapes and nameless characters. Her disruptive narratives are close to the technique of stream of consciousness associated with modernist novelists. Her best-known novel Ice has been described as slipstream, a non-realistic fiction that crosses conventional genre boundaries, where Borges' Fictions, Calvino's Invisible Cities or Ballard's Crash are cited as 'canon of slipstream writing'.A Working Canon of Slipstream Writing compiled in Readercon 18, 2007. =Politics of madness= Kavan's writing of madness, asylum incarceration and opiate addiction offer a complex and thought-provoking perspective on early twentieth-century psychiatry and psychotherapy. As well as being treated in private asylums and nursing homes, Kavan underwent a short analysis at the Tavistock Clinic, experienced Ludwig Binswanger's method of existential psychotherapy at the Bellevue Sanatorium, and had a close personal relationship with her longtime psychiatrist Karl Bluth. In her fiction and journalism Kavan promoted a radical politics of madness, giving voice to the disenfranchised and marginalized psychiatric patient and presaging the anti- psychiatry movement. In the exhibition Mad, Bad and Sad: Women and the Mind Doctors at the Freud Museum in London (2013), her work was presented alongside other female explorers of the mind, among them: Mary Lamb, Theroigne de M√©ricourt, Alice James, Anna O, Ida Bauer, Augustine, Elizabeth Severn, Bryher, Annie Winifred Ellerman, Hilda Doolittle, Princess Marie Bonaparte, Anna Freud, Dorothy Burlingham, Zelda Fitzgerald, Virginia Woolf, Marilyn Monroe and Sylvia Plath. Influences =Literature= Kavan was friends with the Welsh writer Rhys Davies, who based his 1975 novel Honeysuckle Girl on her early life. =Theater and performance= Choreographer and stage director, adapted Ice for the theater in 2008. Silverglass by DJ Britton is a play about the relationship between Rhys Davies and Anna Kavan. It was presented as a premiere during the Rhys Davies Short Story Conference 2013 held in Swansea. The play is set in the late 1960s and depicts Davies' late literary recognition as well as Kavan's final tragedy. Both writers lived 'a life of self-invention, in which secrets, sexuality and deep questions of personal identity lurked constantly in the shadows'.http://www.taliesinartscentre.co.uk/performances.php?id=710 =Music and sound art= Thalia Zedek is an American singer and guitarist, active since the early 1980s and member of several notable alternative rock groups, including Live Skull and Uzi. 'Sleep Has His House was the inspiration for the album Sleep AsylumFrom the desk of Thalia Zedek : Anna Kavan, interview in Magnet Magazine 28 April 2013 : http://www.magnetmagazine.com/2013/04/28/from- the-desk-of-thalia-zedek-anna-kavan/. of Uzi' released in 1986. David Tibet, the primary creative force behind the experimental music/neofolk music group Current 93, named the group's album Sleep Has His House after Anna Kavan's book of the same title. San Francisco post-rock band Carta titled a song Kavan on their album \\"The Glass Bottom Boat\\" after Anna Kavan. The song was subsequently released as a remix by The Declining Winter on their album Haunt the Upper Hallways. Floriane Pochon, French artist, created a sound artwork untitled Ice Lady based on the novel Ice. It was presented during Les Nuits de la Phaune, a live broadcast event initiated by the Marseille-based in 2008. =Visual arts= In an installation named Anna, the Wales-based artist duo Heather and Ivan Morison investigate the construction of the self based on ambiguous narratives. They developed an allegorical piece of object theatre draws on the life and works of Kavan using performance and puppetry to connect the objects and play out \\"a brutal tale of love and loss set against the approaching threat of the ice\\".Heather & Ivan Morison website: http://www.morison.info/anna.html .

Acclimatization occurs in a short period of time (hours to weeks), and within the organism's lifetime (compared to adaptation, which is a development that takes place over many generations). This may be a discrete occurrence (for example, when mountaineers acclimate to high altitude over hours or days) or may instead represent part of a periodic cycle, such as a mammal shedding heavy winter fur in favor of a lighter summer coat. Organisms can adjust their morphological, behavioral, physical, and/or biochemical traits in response to changes in their environment.(2009) ‚ÄúAcclimatisation‚Äù (n.d.) The Unabridged Hutchinson Encyclopedia Retrieved November 5 2009 from http://encyclopedia.farlex.com/acclimatization While the capacity to acclimate to novel environments has been well documented in thousands of species, researchers still know very little about how and why organisms acclimate the way that they do. Names The nouns acclimatization and acclimation (and the corresponding verbs acclimatize and acclimate) are widely regarded as synonymous, both in general vocabulary and in medical vocabulary. It has sometimes been asserted that they should be differentiated by reserving acclimatization for a wild/natural process (e.g., shedding heavy winter fur with natural seasonal change) and reserving acclimation for changes occurring in response to an artificial or controlled situation, such as changes in temperature imposed in an experiment. This assertion is not widely known or followed (as the foregoing citations of 6 major dictionaries show), so writers who intend it must explicitly state that it applies within their usage (for example, \\"in the following discussion, X refers strictly to Y\\") if they expect their intended meaning to be received by their audience. The synonym acclimatation is less commonly encountered, and fewer dictionaries enter it. Methods =Biochemical= In order to maintain performance across a range of environmental conditions, there are several strategies organisms use to acclimate. In response to changes in temperature, organisms can change the biochemistry of cell membranes making them more fluid in cold temperatures and less fluid in warm temperatures by increasing the number of membrane proteins. Organisms may also express specific proteins called heat shock proteins that may act as molecular chaperones and help the cell maintain function under periods of extreme stress. It has been shown that organisms which are acclimated to high or low temperatures display relatively high resting levels of heat shock proteins so that when they are exposed to even more extreme temperatures the proteins are readily available. Expression of heat shock proteins and regulation of membrane fluidity are just two of many biochemical methods organisms use to acclimate to novel environments. =Morphological= Organisms are able to change several characteristics relating to their morphology in order to maintain performance in novel environments. For example, birds often increase their organ size to increase their metabolism. This can take the form of an increase in the mass of nutritional organs or heat-producing organs, like the pectorals (with the latter being more consistent across species). The Theory While the capacity for acclimatization on has been documented in thousands of species, researchers still know very little about how and why organisms acclimate in the way that they do. Since researchers first began to study acclimation, the overwhelming hypothesis has been that all acclimation serves to enhance the performance of the organism. This idea has come to be known as the beneficial acclimation hypothesis. Despite such widespread support for the beneficial acclimation hypothesis, not all studies show that acclimation always serves to enhance performance (See beneficial acclimation hypothesis). One of the major objections to the beneficial acclimation hypothesis is that it assumes that there are no costs associated with acclimation.Angilletta, M.J. (2009). Thermal Adaptation: A Theoretical and Empirical Synthesis. Oxford University Press, Oxford. However, there are likely to be costs associated with acclimation. These include the cost of sensing the environmental conditions and regulating responses, producing structures required for plasticity (such as the energetic costs in expressing heat shock proteins), and genetic costs (such as linkage of plasticity-related genes with harmful genes). Given the shortcomings of the beneficial acclimation hypothesis, researchers are continuing to search for a theory that will be supported by empirical data. The degree to which organisms are able to acclimate is dictated by their phenotypic plasticity or the ability of an organism to change certain traits. Recent research in the study of acclimation capacity has focused more heavily on the evolution of phenotypic plasticity rather than acclimation responses. Scientists believe that when they understand more about how organisms evolved the capacity to acclimate, they will better understand acclimation. Examples = Plants = Many plants, such as maple trees, irises, and tomatoes, can survive freezing temperatures if the temperature gradually drops lower and lower each night over a period of days or weeks. The same drop might kill them if it occurred suddenly. Studies have shown that tomato plants that were acclimated to higher temperature over several days were more efficient at photosynthesis at relatively high temperatures than were plants that were not allowed to acclimate. In the orchid Phalaenopsis, phenylpropanoid enzymes are enhanced in the process of plant acclimatisation at different levels of photosynthetic photon flux. =Animals= Animals acclimatize in many ways. Sheep grow very thick wool in cold, damp climates. Fish are able to adjust only gradually to changes in water temperature and quality. Tropical fish sold at pet stores are often kept in acclimatization bags until this process is complete. Lowe & Vance (1995) were able to show that lizards acclimated to warm temperatures could maintain a higher running speed at warmer temperatures than lizards that were not acclimated to warm conditions. Fruit flies that develop at relatively cooler or warmer temperatures have increased cold or heat tolerance as adults, respectively (See Developmental plasticity). Humans The salt content of sweat and urine decreases as people acclimatize to hot conditions. Plasma volume, heart rate, and capillary activation are also affected. Acclimatization to high altitude continues for months or even years after initial ascent, and ultimately enables humans to survive in an environment that, without acclimatization, would kill them. Humans who migrate permanently to a higher altitude naturally acclimatize to their new environment by developing an increase in the number of red blood cells to increase the oxygen carrying capacity of the blood, in order to compensate for lower levels of oxygen intake. \\\\- Altitude physiology model See also * Acclimatisation society * Beneficial acclimation hypothesis * Heat index * Introduced species * Phenotypic plasticity * Wind chill References *World Book encyclopedia 1989 Category:Physiology Category:Ecological processes Category:Climate ","title":"Acclimatization"},{"id":"400048","text":"Fixed may refer to: * Fixed (EP), EP by Nine Inch Nails * Fixed (film), an Australian short film, directed by Codey Wilson and Burleigh Smith * Fixed (Genndy Tartakovsky film), an upcoming 3D adult animated film directed by Genndy Tartakovsky * Fixed (typeface), a collection of monospace bitmap fonts that is distributed with the X Window System * Fixed, subjected to neutering * Fixed point (mathematics), a point that is mapped to itself by the function * Fixed line telephone, landline  See also   Fix (disambiguation) * Fixer (disambiguation) * Fixing (disambiguation) * Fixture (disambiguation) ","title":"Fixed"},{"id":"400050","text":"Helen Woods may refer to: *Anna Kavan, British novelist *Helen Jones Woods, jazz musician See also *Helen Wood (disambiguation) ","title":"Helen Woods"},{"id":"400051","text":"In the notorious 'meatrack' on Fire Island Pines, New York, a man cruises for sex. Cruising for sex, or cruising, is walking or driving about a locality, called a cruising ground, in search of a sex partner, usually of the anonymous, casual, one-time variety. Published: 11-14-2007 Published: 9-21-2005 Article from NYT about a cruising area in New York City The term is also used when technology is used to find casual sex, such as using an Internet site or a telephone service. Origin and historical usage According to historian and author Tim Blanning, the term cruising originates from the Dutch equivalent kruisen.Tim Blanning. The Pursuit of Glory: Europe 1648-1815. p 81. . In a specifically sexual context, the term \\"cruising\\" originally emerged as an argot \\"code word\\" in gay slang, by which those \\"in the know\\" would understand the speaker's unstated sexual intent, whereas most heterosexuals, on hearing the same word in the same context, would normally misread the speaker's intended meaning in the word's more common nonsexual sense. This served (and in some contexts, still serves) as a protective sociolinguistic mechanism for gay men to recognize each other, and avoid being recognized by those who may wish to do them harm in broader societies noted for their homophobia. In the latter half of the twentieth century, decriminalization of homosexual behaviour increasingly became the norm in English-speaking countries. The protective barrier once provided by the term \\"cruising\\" as a \\"code word\\" has therefore largely broken down and, arguably, become increasingly irrelevant. Thus the specifically sexual meaning of the term has passed into common usage to include the sexual behavior of heterosexual persons, as well. Public health officials have noted that cruising locations are frequented by men who have sex with men, but do not identify with being homosexual or bisexual, who are closeted, married, or in relationships with women, do not date men or frequent gay bars, clubs or websites, or have otherwise no other way of meeting men for sex.Tradition of sex cruising at Aquatic Park to end. John Geluardi. Berkeley Daily Planet. 19-12-2001. Retrieved 17-01-2011. The cruising places are often considered meeting places for men who are otherwise living more conventional lifestyles. For instance, it was noted in Laud Humphreys' 1970 study about anonymous gay sex meeting places that most men who visited those places were at least seemingly heterosexuals who had families.Newman, David: Sociology 7; Exploring the Architecture of Everyday Life. Pine Forge Press (2008) Regional usage variants In the United States, the term \\"cruising\\" was used predominantly to denote exclusively homosexual behavior, but in Australia and the United Kingdom it is used by both homosexuals and heterosexuals to describe their own behavior, as witnessed in the common male heterosexual derivative phrase \\"cruising for chicks\\". In the United States, cruising often takes place in gay bars, adult video arcades often through gloryholes, adult movie theaters, public toilets, parks, saunas, gyms or gay bathhouses. Engaging in such activities in public places like parks has led to participants being charged with indecent exposure. Historic examples of usage The term has been enshrined since at least the mid-1970s in the name of the gay bar Foxes Booze 'n' Cruise, located on Historic US Highway 66 in Albuquerque, New Mexico. Before closing, the business came under criticism for allegedly encouraging drunk driving by some who did not understand the term's historic usage, but the name and the sign remain a conscious reminder of gay history. The term has also been adopted, in an altered form, by the website qruiser.com, an online LGBT community based in Sweden. This is a tongue in cheek reference, however, as the community functions as a forum for social interaction for the Scandinavian region, rather than focusing on exclusively sexual encounters. The website has attracted many heterosexual members as well. In popular culture Cruising for sex is alluded to in songs such as \\"Cruisin' the Streets\\" by the Boys Town Gang as well as \\"I'm a Cruiser\\" by the Village People, on the album titled Cruisin'. In 1980, director William Friedkin made the film Cruising, starring Al Pacino. The film introduced many audiences to homosexual activities and the linguistic codes used for them, but gay rights groups perceived a negative depiction of the gay community in the film and protested its production. The opening scene of the first episode of the HBO series Looking involves the main character Patrick (Jonathan Groff) cruising in a park, mainly out of curiosity of whether the activity is still in practice or not.\\"Looking for Now\\". Looking. Season 1. Episode 1. HBO. Cruising for sex was explored in Cruising Pavilion, a 2018 art installation associated with the Venice Biennale of Architecture.

They are usually heard only with a stethoscope (\\"on auscultation\\"). Pulmonary crackles are abnormal breath sounds that were formerly referred to as rales.Cahalin LP, Buck LA. Physical Therapy Associated With Cardiovascular Pump Dysfunction and Failure. In: DeTurk WE, Cahalin LP. eds. 'Cardiovascular and Pulmonary Physical Therapy: An Evidence-Based Approach, 3e'. McGraw-Hill; Accessed August 16, 2020 Bilateral crackles refers to the presence of crackles in both lungs. Basal crackles are crackles apparently originating in or near the base of the lung. Bibasal crackles refer to crackles at the bases of both the left and right lungs. Bilateral basal crackles also refers to the presence of basal crackles in both lungs. Crackles are caused by the \\"popping open\\" of small airways and alveoli collapsed by fluid, exudate, or lack of aeration during expiration. Crackles can be heard in patients with pneumonia, atelectasis, pulmonary fibrosis, acute bronchitis, bronchiectasis, acute respiratory distress syndrome (ARDS), interstitial lung disease or post thoracotomy or metastasis ablation. Pulmonary edema secondary to left-sided congestive heart failure can also cause crackles. Terminology Ren√© Laennec adopted the existing word r√¢les (which has been translated as \\"rattles\\", 'groans\\" and otherwise) to describe the added breath sounds that are now referred to as \\"crackles\\". He described them using unusual daily examples, such as \\"whistling of little birds\\", \\"crackling of salt on a heated dish\\", \\"cooing of the woodpidgeon\\", etc., but he soon realized that he was unable to use the term in front of his patients because it conjured the association of le r√¢le de la mort, which translates to \\" the death rattle\\", the noise that people who are about to die make when they can no longer clear secretions. Therefore, at the bedside, he used the Latin word rhonchus, which originally meant a 'snore'. That was not clearly understood by his translator, John Forbes, and the terminology became very confusing after the publication in the 1830s of Forbes's English translation of Laennec's De L'Auscultation Mediate. The difficulty of translating r√¢le itself had been remarked upon in a British review of Laennec's work in 1820. The terminology of \\"rales\\" and \\"rhonchi\\" in English remained variable until 1977, when a standardization was established by the American Thoracic Society and American College of Chest Physicians. As a result, the term r√¢les was abandoned, and \\"crackles\\" became its recommended substitute. The term \\"rales\\" is still common in English-language medical literature, but cognizance of the ATS/CHEST guidelines calls for \\"crackles\\". In 2016, the European Respiratory Society reported on a study of various physicians listening to audiovisual recordings of auscultation findings and interobserver variation was analyzed. The study found that broad descriptions agreed better than detailed descriptions. Sound Crackles are caused by explosive opening of small airways and are discontinuous, nonmusical, and brief. Crackles are much more common during the inspiratory than the expiratory phase of breathing, but they may be heard during the expiratory phase. Crackles are often associated with inflammation or infection of the small bronchi, bronchioles, and alveoli. Crackles that do not clear after a cough may indicate pulmonary edema or fluid in the alveoli due to heart failure, pulmonary fibrosis, or acute respiratory distress syndrome. Crackles that partially clear or change after coughing may indicate bronchiectasis. * Crackles are often described as fine, medium, and coarse. They can also be characterized as to their timing: fine crackles are usually late-inspiratory, whereas coarse crackles are early inspiratory. * Fine crackles are soft, high- pitched, and very brief. This sound can be simulated by rolling a strand of hair between one's fingers near the ears, or by moistening one's thumb and index finger and separating them near the ears. Their presence usually indicates an interstitial process, such as pulmonary fibrosis or congestive heart failure. The sounds from interstitial pulmonary fibrosis have been described as sounding like opening a Velcro fastener. * Coarse crackles are somewhat louder, lower in pitch, and last longer than fine crackles. Their presence usually indicates an airway disease, such as bronchiectasis. They can also be described as unilateral or bilateral, as well as dry or moist/wet.

He was descended from a family of Aberdeenshire, holders of the small estate of Auchleuchries, near Ellon. The family was connected with the noble branch of Haddo. As a result of his distinguished service for Sweden, Poland and Russia he rose in ranks from trooper to full general, and became principal advisor and close friend of Tsar Peter the Great. Gordon assumed the additional Christian name of Leopold when confirmed as a Roman Catholic shortly before his death.  Life  Gordon was brought up and remained a lifelong Roman Catholic, at a time when the Church was being persecuted in Scotland, which had become Calvinist. After an education at the parish schools of Cruden and Ellon, at age of fifteen he entered the Jesuit college at Braunsberg, East Prussia, then part of Poland; however, his character did not tolerate well the strict and sombre way of life at the school, and he soon decided to return home. He changed his mind, however, before re-embarking on the journey back to Scotland, and after journeying on foot in several parts of what is today Germany, in 1655 he enlisted at Hamburg into the military service of Sweden. In the course of the next five years he served alternately for Poland and Sweden and was taken prisoner by both. At the Battle of Chudnov in 1660, Gordon was wounded.Fedosov, Dmitry ‚ÄúCock of the East: A Gordon Blade Abroad‚Äù pages 1-10 from Russia War, Peace and Diplomacy edited by Ljubica and Mark Erickson, London: Weidenfeld & Nicolson, 2004 page 6. Upon hearing of the Stuart restoration, Gordon left the Polish service, but found himself unable to obtain military employment in Scotland or England. In 1661, after further experiences as a soldier of fortune, he joined the Russian army under Tsar Aleksei I, and in 1665 was sent on a special mission to England. After his return he distinguished himself in several wars against the Turks and Tatars in southern Russia. Gordon disliked the Russian service, complaining of the corruption and venality of Russian officials, which left him, in his own words, \\"almost at wits end with vexation\\".Fedosov, Dmitry, ‚ÄúCock of the East: A Gordon Blade Abroad‚Äù pages 1-10, from Russia War, Peace and Diplomacy edited by Ljubica and Mark Erickson, London: Weidenfeld & Nicolson, 2004, page 7. However, in recognition of his service he was promoted to major-general in 1678, was appointed to the high command at Kiev in 1679, and in 1683 was made lieutenant-general. He was not the only Scottish soldier in the Tsar's service; his fellow-Scots Paul Menzies and Alexander Livingston were also among those from lesser houses, or had little chance of a claim to inheritance, seeking to make a name for themselves. Gordon visited England and Scotland in 1686. In 1687 and 1689 he took part in expeditions against the Tatars in the Crimea, being made a full general. Later in 1689 a revolution broke out in Moscow, and with the troops under his command Gordon virtually decided events in favour of Peter the Great,Fedosov, Dmitry ‚ÄúCock of the East: A Gordon Blade Abroad‚Äù pages 1-10 from Russia War, Peace and Diplomacy edited by Ljubica and Mark Erickson, London: Weidenfeld & Nicolson, 2004 page 9. and against the Regent, Tsarevna Sophia Alekseyevna. Consequently, he was for the remainder of his life in high favour with the Tsar, who confided to him the command of his capital during his absence from Russia. In 1696, Gordon's design of a \\"moveable rampart\\" played a key role in helping the Russians take Azov. Gordon's alleged tomb at Vvedenskoye Cemetery in Moscow. One of Gordon's greatest achievements was securing permission from the Tsars to establish the first Roman Catholic church and school in Muscovy, of which he remained the main benefactor, and headed the Catholic community in Russia until his death. For his services his second son James, brigadier of the Russian army, was created Count of the Holy Roman Empire in 1701. The Tsar employed him in organizing his army according to the West European system; and raised him to the rank of full general. At the end of his life the Tsar, who had visited Gordon frequently during his illness, was with him when he died, and with his own hands closed his eyes. Originally buried in the Foreign Quarter, his remains were reinterred at Azov in 1877, with an inscription in German which mistakenly gives his rank as Oberst, Colonel. General Gordon left behind him a uniquely detailed diary of his life and times, written in English. This is preserved in manuscript in the Russian State Military Archive in Moscow. An incomplete and faulty German translation, edited by Dr Moritz Posselt (Tagebuch des Generals Patrick Gordon) was published, the first volume at Moscow in 1849, the second at St Petersburg in 1851, and the third at St Petersburg in 1853; and Passages from the Diary of General Patrick Gordon of Auchleuchries (1635‚Äì1699), was printed, under the editorship of Joseph Robertson, for the Spalding Club, at Aberdeen, Scotland, 1859. A new full scholarly edition of Gordon's Diary in English was published by the Centre for Irish and Scottish Studies in Aberdeen (6 vols, 2009-2016), as well as its translation into Russian.

The district's name means \\"plum field\\".  History  Umeda was historically called Umeda Haka (Umeda Grave), because it was 1 of 7 largest cemeteries of Osaka from the Edo period (1603-1868) till the initial 20 years of the Meiji period (1868-1912). In 2020, survey teams for the Umekita redevelopment project discovered ancient burial remains of over 1,500 people. Experts say these remains were of commoners, not the aristocracy. They used several burial styles, both cremated as well as buried with enclosed wooden caskets, barrel-shaped open containers and earthenware coffins called kameganbo (turtle caskets). They found burial items such as pipes, clay dolls, rokusenmon (a set of six coins to pay passage across the Sanzu River which separates the world of the living and the afterlife) and juzudama (rosary- style prayer beads). A stone wall separated a mass grave with skeletons that were only covered by soil. These are thought to be the deceased of a plague. Until the 1870s, the area which is now Umeda was agricultural land. The area was reclaimed and filled in by the prefectural government in the 1870s to support the creation of the first Osaka Station. The word \\"Umeda\\" was previously written with different kanji characters; ÂüãÁî∞ (English: \\"buried field\\") to reflect this history. The name was changed to Ê¢ÖÁî∞ (English: \\"plum field\\") without altering the pronunciation, likely due to negative connotations with the previous characters. The original Osaka Station, a two- story red brick building, was opened in 1874, along with the first railway connecting Osaka and Kobe cities, and in 1876 an additional line to Kyoto. This was essentially the establishment of Umeda as a district. As industry in the area increased at the turn of the century, the station required expansion, so in 1901 the first station was demolished, and a larger station was built in the location where Osaka Station resides in a different form today. Hanshin Umeda station was constructed in 1906, followed by Hankyu Umeda Station in 1910, the Umeda subway station and Midosuji subway line in 1933 and Kitashinchi station in 1997. The current incarnation of Osaka Station was built in 1979, but underwent extensive renovation and reconstruction between 2005 and 2011, including the addition of the North Gate Building, a glass roof covering the tracks, and vast additional retail space providing shops, restaurants, sports centers and movie theatres to the area. For the 2011 re- opening, the station was re-branded Osaka Station City. The construction of Umeda Sky Building in 1993 and the re-branding of Osaka Station City in 2011 have transformed the Umeda area from a business district to a retail and tourist attraction.  Politics and Government  Umeda makes up a large part of the Kita Ward of Osaka city, the Kita Ward Electorate could elect three representatives to the current composition of the Osaka Municipal Assembly. As of 2018, the Kita electoral district was represented by Takayama Mia from the Osaka Restoration Association, Maeda Kazuhiko from the Liberal Democratic Party and Yamamoto Tomoko from Komeito. Before the 2019 Japanese unified local elections in April 2019, the number of representatives from Kita was increased to four. The 2019 election results saw all three incumbent representatives re- elected, along with Osaka Restoration Association newcomer Kuramoto Takayuki.  Geography  Map of Kita ward showing area of Umeda-proper (red) and the greater Umeda area (green) Umeda district in the broad sense Umeda officially only covers JR West Osaka Station and the immediate area to its south and west, although \\"Umeda\\" is often used to describe much of the surrounding area, and is commonly used as a catch-all to refer to the downtown area of northern Osaka City. In addition to JR Osaka Station, Kitashinchi Station, Hankyu Umeda Station and Hanshin Umeda Station are located in this area. Osaka Metro's Higashi-Umeda Station and Nishi-Umeda Station provide subway services to and from Umeda, making it a key transportation hub for the greater Osaka area. Underneath the main roads is an underground city which connects most of the local train stations and provides retailers, eateries and access to the area's department stores and the Dojima area of Kita ward. Official districts of Umeda: *Umeda 1-chome: Diamond District, Hanshin Department Store, Hilton Hotels & Resorts Osaka. *Umeda 2-chome: Osaka Garden City, Herbis Osaka *Umeda 3-chome: Osaka Station, Osaka Garden City, Nishi Umeda Square View of Sonezaki during the night The area commonly referred to as Umeda, though outside of Umeda-proper, includes: *Shibata *Chayamachi *Tsuruno *Toyosaki 2-chome *Kakuda *Nakazaki 2-chome, 4-chome *Komatsubara *Doyama *Banzai *Taiyuji *Togano *Sonezaki *Sonezaki Shinchi *Dojima *Dojimahama *Nishitenma *Oyodo- Naka 1-chome *Oyodo-Minami 1-chome *Ofukacho *Nakatsu 1-chome, 5-chome These areas are not officially part of the Umeda district, but may use \\"Umeda\\" on their buildings, business names, and in their advertising, and are commonly referred to unofficially as the Umeda area. An example of this is the Umeda Sky Building, one of Osaka's most recognizable landmarks, which resides not in Umeda but in Oyodo-Naka.

The price of land within this area is among the highest in Osaka, so it has come to be known as the \\"Diamond District\\". The area contains some of the largest skyscrapers in Osaka, department stores and recognizable buildings.

The area extending to the east and north of the station hosts many buildings owned or funded by the Hankyu Corporation, so it is colloquially referred to as Hankyu-mura (lit:Hankyu village). Buildings such as the HEP Five building and Ferris wheel, Hankyu Mens department store, TOHO Cinemas, the Hankyu Grand Building, Hankyu Sanbangai shopping street, a string of antique book and art sellers, and the main branch of Hankyu Department Store, a 187 meter, 41-story building. The west side of Hankyu station hosts hotels, restaurants, fitness clubs, and the Hankyu Corporation's headquarters. The area to the northeast of the station has been rapidly developing since the 1990s. The Chayamachi area, in particular, is growing quickly since the construction of NU Chayamachi shopping mall. *Hankyu Umeda Station **Hankyu Sanbangai **Kinokuniya Bookstore Umeda Main Store *Umeda Hankyu Building **Hankyu Department Store Umeda Main Store **Toshiba Kansai Branch Office *Hankyu Terminal Building *Hankyu Grand Building *Osaka New Hankyu Hotel *HEP NAVIO **Hankyu Men's Osaka **TOHO Cinemas Umeda *HEP Five *Yanmar Flying Y Building **UNIQLO Osaka *NU Chayamachi *Hankyu Corporation Head Office *Maruzen/Junkudo book store = Osaka Station North = Ofukacho, Shibata 2-chome The area to the north of JR Osaka Station.

Since large-scale redevelopment is being undertaken in the area, land prices have been rising, and now Obukacho 4-chome has become the site with the highest land prices in West Japan. The area's rise has been attributed to the opening of the large Yodobashi Camera electronics department store in 2001, and since then other large developments such as Grand Front Osaka and a satellite campus of Osaka University have been completed.

The area is famous for its kushikatsu restaurants. T≈çru Hashimoto, former Mayor of Osaka and Governor of Osaka Prefecture, while working as a lawyer in the Tobitashinchi red light district in the south of Osaka, was revealed to have had an affair with hostesses in Kitashinchi before entering politics, a scandal that led to heavy criticism during political campaigns, along with allegations of ties to yakuza. = Underground City = The Osaka Underground City was completed in 1942 as a station underpass but has been dramatically expanded since.

She is best known as the judge who swore in Lyndon B. Johnson as President of the United States on Air Force One after John F. Kennedy was assassinated in Dallas on November 22, 1963. As of 2020 she is the only woman in United States history to have sworn in a President. The photo depicting Hughes administering the oath of office to Johnson is widely viewed as the most famous photo ever taken aboard Air Force One. Education and career Born Sarah Augusta Tilghman in Baltimore, Maryland, she was the daughter of James Cooke and Elizabeth (Haughton) Tilghman. She went to high school at Western Female High School (now Western High School) in Baltimore, where she was elected president of the freshman class. Standing only five feet one-half inch at maturity, she was described by a classmate as \\"small but terrible\\".Judge Sarah T. Hughes Collection ‚Äî University of North Texas Libraries Her determined personality extended to the athletic field where she participated in intramural track and field, gymnastics, and basketball. Another instance of Hughes's strong personal discipline was seen in her habit of going to bed by 8 pm and getting up at 4 am, a habit she continued through much of her life. After graduating from Western High School, she attended Goucher College, an all women's college in central Baltimore very close to her home. She participated in athletics at Goucher College, and 'learned to lose without bitterness, to get up and try again, to never feel resentment,' a trait that would serve her well through many years of political victories and defeats. She graduated with an Artium Baccalaureus degree in 1917. After graduating from college, Hughes taught science at Salem Academy in Winston- Salem, North Carolina for several years. She then returned to school to the study of law. In 1919 she moved to Washington, D.C. and attended The George Washington University Law School. She attended classes at night and during the day worked as a police officer. As a police officer, Hughes did not carry a gun or wear a police uniform because she worked to prevent crimes among women and girls, patrolling areas where female runaways and prostitutes were normally found. Her job was an expression of the progressive idea of rehabilitation instead of punishment. Hughes later credited this job with instilling in her a sense of commitment and responsibility to women and children. At that time she lived in a tent home near the Potomac River and commuted to the campus by canoe each evening. She graduated with a Bachelor of Laws in 1922. She moved to Dallas, Texas in 1922 with her husband, George Ernest Hughes, whom she had met in law school. Her husband quickly found employment after law school, but Sarah faced significant obstacles as a woman during a time in which law firms generally did not regard women as qualified. Eventually, the small firm of Priest, Herndon, and Ledbetter gave her a rent- free space and even referred some cases to her in exchange for her services as a receptionist. As her practice grew and became more successful, she became increasingly active in local women's organizations. She joined the Zonta Club, the Business and Professional Women's Club, the Dallas Women's Political League, the League of Women Voters, YWCA, Dallas College Club, and the American Association of University Women. Hughes served as Chair of the AAUW Committee on the Economic and Legal Status of Women, advocating equal pay jury service for women, and improved status and recognition for women in the Armed Services. She practiced law for eight years in Dallas before becoming involved in politics, first being elected in 1930 to three terms in the Texas House of Representatives as a Democrat.Texas Legislators Past and Present-Sarah Hughes In 1935, Hughes accepted an appointment as a state judge from Governor James Allred for the Fourteenth District Court in Dallas, becoming the state's first female district judge. In 1936 she was elected to the same post. She was re- elected six more times and remained in that post until 1961. Federal judicial service Hughes received a recess appointment from President John F. Kennedy on October 5, 1961, to the United States District Court for the Northern District of Texas, to a new seat authorized by 75 Stat. 80. She was nominated to the same position by President Kennedy on January 15, 1962. She was confirmed by the United States Senate on March 16, 1962, and received her commission on March 17, 1962. She was the only female judge appointed by President Kennedy, the first female federal judge in Texas and the third female to serve in the federal judiciary. She assumed senior status on August 4, 1975. Her service terminated on April 23, 1985, due to her death. \\"Today, women comprise 26.3% of the judgeships on state courts of last resort, 19.2% of federal district court judgeships, 20.1% of federal appellate judgeships, and 33.3% of the U.S. Supreme Court.\\" Women in the United States judiciary. =Circumstances of appointment= The appointment almost did not happen, according to the historian Robert Caro, because the Kennedy administration thought that Hughes was \\"too old\\" and they were seeking younger jurists for the lifetime tenure afforded under Article III for federal judgeships. Hughes had been a \\"longtime Johnson ally,\\" and as vice president, Johnson had asked Robert F. Kennedy, the attorney general of the United States and brother of President John F. Kennedy, \\"to nominate Mrs. Hughes\\" for the Federal bench, but the United States Justice Department turned him down. Johnson then offered the job to another attorney. However, Hughes was also an ally of the speaker of the House, Sam Rayburn, who held up a bill important to Robert Kennedy until Hughes's appointment was announced. Johnson was outraged at the chain of events because it appeared to be an intentional attempt to insult him, and made him look like the \\"biggest liar and fool in the history of the State of Texas\\". President Kennedy's White House appointments secretary called it a \\"terrible mistake\\", citing negligence on the part of Kennedy's staff. The story of how Hughes received her appointment made the rounds of Washington, D.C. insiders, including the political gossip columnists Evans and Novak, which hurt Johnson's reputation for political effectiveness. Historian Steven Gillon agrees with Caro's story, although it was not cross-cited. Women on juries Hughes was concerned over the ineligibility of women in Texas to serve on juries even though they had the right to vote. She and Helen Edmunds Moore coauthored a proposed amendment that would allow women on juries in Texas, but the bill failed and went nowhere. Despite defeat, Hughes became closely identified with this cause and few people were recognized as working harder for this right. Due in to part to Hughes's work, Texas women secured the right to serve on juries in 1954. Administering the oath of office Judge Hughes swears-in Lyndon B. Johnson as President of the United States as Mrs. Kennedy and Lady Bird Johnson look on. Photo by Cecil W. Stoughton. Two years into her tenure as a federal district judge, on November 22, 1963, Hughes was called upon to administer the oath of office to Lyndon B. Johnson after the assassination of President Kennedy, a task usually performed by the Chief Justice of the United States. According to an interview with Barefoot Sanders, who was United States Attorney for the Northern District of Texas at the time:vd_2002_fall_Barefoot%20Sanders(1) Hughes believed that President Johnson chose her to administer the oath of office due to their friendship, and because Johnson was not pleased with other federal judges in Dallas. Because of this, Hughes was the most suitable choice. Sanders and Hughes no doubt believed those rationales, but Johnson had other reasons to choose her, according to Caro: \\"He knew who he wanted - and she was in Dallas.\\" Citing another historian, Max Holland, Caro noted that the circumstances surrounding Hughes's appointment meant that she \\"'personified Johnson's utter powerlessness'\\" when he was vice president. The new president ordered his staff, \\"'Get Sarah Hughes ... Find her.'\\" Hughes was found and driven to Love Field, while Air Force One‚Äîand thus the inauguration of the new president‚Äîwas held up just for her. Caro asserts that Johnson, in his insecurities, chose Hughes to show to the world that he was now powerful. Two other historians (Holland and Gillen) agree with Caro's assessment that Johnson was still upset that he'd not been consulted on Hughes's appointment in the first place, so it was a way to placate his ego. On the other hand, Johnson needed to make sure that \\"the swearing-in take place at the earliest possible moment ... to demonstrate, quickly, continuity and stability to the nation and the world. ... \\" Johnson used the \\"few minutes to spare\\" while waiting for Hughes to arrive to plead to Kennedy's staffers to stay awhile for the transition. Finally, she arrived, along with the media and Jackie Kennedy; only then the swearing-in could take place. Hughes noted that Jackie's \\"eyes 'were cast down'\\" when Johnson nodded to the judge to start the oath of office. Other significant contributions Throughout her lifetime, Sarah Hughes was known for her speedy and impartial administration. In 1950, she assisted in establishing Dallas's first juvenile detention center. Hughes was involved in multiple court decisions, including Roe v. Wade, Shultz v. Brookhaven General Hospital, and Taylor v. Sterrett. Hughes was a member of the three-judge panel that first heard the case of Roe v. Wade; the panel's decision was subsequently affirmed by the Supreme Court of the United States. In Taylor v. Sterrett, she argued to upgrade prisoner treatment in the Dallas County jail. Hughes noted that \\"the Dallas County Jail was very much in need of change. It was in deplorable condition, and [she] think[s], that under [her] jurisdiction, it became one of the best jails in the whole United States.\\" Later years and death Hughes retired from the active federal bench in 1975, though she continued to work as a judge with senior status until 1982. A close friend of Lyndon Johnson and his family, Hughes participated in his inauguration in 1965, took part in the book signing of Lady Bird Johnson's White House memoirs, and participated in the dedication of the Lyndon Baines Johnson Library and Museum. The dress Hughes wore during the swearing in on Air Force One was donated to a wax museum in Grand Prairie, Texas, but it was destroyed in a fire in 1988. In 1982, Hughes suffered a debilitating stroke which confined her to a nursing home in Dallas. She died three years later on April 23, 1985. The Sarah T. Hughes Field Politics Center at Hughes' alma mater, Goucher College, founded in the 1950s with a grant from the Maurice and Laura Falk Foundation, is named in her honor.

Life George, Lord Gordon was brought to royal court in Edinburgh February 1596 and in November 1596 at the time of the baptism of Princess Elizabeth as a pledge or hostage for his father's good behaviour, and to be brought up in the Protestant religion and taught by Robert Rollock.M. S. Giuseppi, ed., Calendar of State Papers Scotland, vol. 11 (Edinburgh, 1952), p. 162, 167, 359. In July 1602 Anne of Denmark suggested he should marry a sister of the Earl of Moray, one of her ladies-in-waiting, possibly Margaret Stewart. A committee of arbitrators in the feud between Huntly and Moray, called the \\"4 Stewarts\\" advised he marry a daughter of the Earl of Argyll, which he later did.Calendar State Papers Scotland: 1597-1603, vol. 13 (Edinburgh, 1969), pp. 1048, 1111. Some of his earlier years, when he was still Lord Gordon, were spent in England at the court of James I, who took care to educate him in the Protestant faith and created him Earl of Enzie. In 1609 he received a commission of justiciary under the great seal against the members of a rebellious society in the north called the \\"Society of Boys\\". In 1613, he was employed by his father in connection with a dispute regarding his superiority over a portion of Lochaber, held by Lochiel and the Camerons. A treaty was at last signed between Lochiel and Enzie on 24 March 1618, by which Lochiel, on certain terms, agreed to renounce his rights to several estates under dispute, one of the stipulations being that he should obtain assistance against his old enemies the Mackintoshes. Enzie had also a private ground of quarrel against Mackintosh on account of his failure to perform certain services for lands held of the earl and his father. Having on this account obtained a decree against him from the privy council, he besieged him in his castle of Culloden, and compelled him to flee southwards, first to Edinburgh and then to England. Enzie cited him to appear before the privy council, and on his failing to appear he was denounced as a rebel. Mackintosh, being at court, appealed to the king, but after Enzie went to London to give his version of the matter in dispute, Mackintosh was ordered to enter himself in ward in the castle of Edinburgh until he should give the earl satisfaction. In 1622 Enzie received a commission from the privy council to proceed against the Earl of Caithness, but before the commission was carried into effect it was superseded by another from the king to proceed on a mission to France. He remained in that country for some years in command of a company of gens d'armes. On 20 April 1632 he was created Viscount of Aboyne. On the death of his father in June 1636 he was still in France, but in October following returned to England along with his wife, his sister Lady Anne, and two sons, and on 23 June 1637 arrived in Strathbogie. Covenanter movement Notwithstanding his father's differences with the government, the second Marquess found himself in the enjoyment of the royal favour. He had been educated at court along with Prince Henry and Prince Charles; and as a Protestant episcopalian he was naturally relied on to render the utmost assistance to the government in their policy towards the covenanters. His supreme influence in the north served to balance that of Archibald Campbell, 1st Marquess of Argyll in the west. In 1638 he caused the royal proclamation to be read at the cross of New Aberdeen. At the beginning of the dispute with the king the covenanters sent to him Colonel Robert Munro as their ambassador, offering, if he would cast in his lot with them, not only to make him their leader, but to pay all his debts, which were said to amount to ¬£100,000 sterling. But \\"to this proposition,\\" says Gordon, \\"Huntly pave a short and resolute repartee, that his family had risen and stood by the kings of Scotland, and for his part, if the event proved the ruin of the king, he was resolved to lay his life, honours, and estate under the rubbish of the king his ruins\\". He therefore not only refused to subscribe the covenant, but in September, alone of the other noblemen appointed in the north, accepted the commission of the king to cause the people to subscribe the king's covenant and band. In 1639, Huntly was secretly appointed the king's lieutenant in the north, and, information reaching him that a gathering of the covenanters was to be held at Turriff on 14 February, he resolved to disperse them, but when Montrose marched to their support with a body of eight hundred men Huntly contented himself with making a demonstration by marching past them in battle array with a force of two thousand men, without \\"ony kind of offence or inurious word\\", and immediately afterwards disbanded his troops. As a reason for this indecision, Huntly is stated to have affirmed that he had no warrant from the king to strike the first blow. This is confirmed by Burnet, but Burnet also attributes his indecisive action during the whole covenanting struggle to his astrological studies, by which he had become convinced that neither the king, nor the Hamiltons, nor Montrose (who afterwards opposed the covenanters) would prosper. On this account, though ‚Äònaturally a gallant man,‚Äô says Burnet, ‚Äòhe made a poor figure during the whole course of the wars‚Äô. At the beginning it is, however, evident that he was insufficiently supported from the south, and though inclined to do what he could for the king, he was not disposed to run too great risks. He had been promised the assistance of five thousand men under Hamilton, but they failed to make their appearance, and the covenanters displayed such energy that Huntly on 15 March sent commissioners to treat with Montrose. The answer of Montrose was unsatisfactory, and Huntly, having caused his lieutenancy to be proclaimed at the cross of Aberdeen, began to collect his forces at Inverurie. Meanwhile, he again sent commissioners to Montrose, but before their return he had disbanded his followers and retired to Stathbogie. Aberdeen, having been thus wholly abandoned, was entered by Montrose without opposition on 30 March. On 1 April Montrose and Leslie set out for Inverurie with ‚Äòresolution to discusse and find out Huntly‚Äô. There they remained ‚Äòupon free quarter,‚Äô allowing their men to rifle, or, according to a term now introduced by Leslie and his soldiers into the English language from the German, to ‚Äòplunder‚Äô the houses of those who had fled. Huntly, who had retired to the Bog of Gight, deeming further resistance to be meanwhile vain, sent commissioners to request an interview with Montrose. This took place at the village of Lewes in Fyvie on 5 April, when Huntly, though not subscribing the covenant, agreed to throw no hindrance in the way of his followers doing so, and engaged that those who had scruples in signing should enter into an obligation to maintain the laws and liberties of Scotland. He was then permitted to return to Strathbogie, Montrose retiring to Aberdeen. Soon afterwards a meeting of the covenanting leaders was held at Aberdeen for the settlement of the north. On being summoned to the meeting Huntly agreed to attend it on receiving a safe-condnct, guaranteeing that he should be at full liberty to return home after the conference was over. This was granted him by Montrose, probably in good faith, but, apparently overborne by the clamour of the Frasers, the Forbeses, the Crichtons, and other sworn enemies of Huntly, he contrived to find excuses for arresting him, notwithstanding his safe-conduct. On the evening of 11 April he invited Huntly and his sons to supper, and there hinted to him the advisability of his resigning the lieutenandry, and also writing favourably to the king of the covenanters as good and loyal subjects. Huntly readily agreed, but perhaps Montrose suspected that he was only temporising, for that evening guards were placed at his lodging to prevent his escape. On the morrow he had another interview with Montrose, who now solicited his aid in defraying the expenses of the expedition, and also required him to take steps to apprehend James Grant and others who had opposed the covenanters. Huntly declined to comply with either of these demands, and when he was further requested to take his hereditary enemy Crichton of Frendraught by the hand, he declared that this last he would do on no condition whatever. Montrose then ingenuously asked him if he had any objection to accompany him to Edinburgh, and on Huntly confessing that he would rather not, expressed the opinion that it would be well for him to do it. Huntly then demanded back the bond he had signed at Inverurie before he gave an answer, and on receiving it asked whether he wished him to go south as a captive or as a volunteer. ‚ÄòMake your choice,‚Äô said Montrose. ‚ÄòThen,‚Äô said Huntly, ‚ÄòI will not go as a captive, but as a volunteer‚Äô. Huntly, accordingly, with his two eldest sons accompanied Montrose to Edinburgh ‚Äòunder a guard, though not disarmed or a prisoner‚Äô. On his arrival in Edinburgh an attempt was made by the leaders of the covenanters to induce him to sign the covenant, ‚Äòvery honourable terms being offered him,‚Äô but to their demand he gave a written refusal, dated 20 April, and afterwards published, which concluded with these words: ‚ÄòFor my oune pairt, I am in your power, and resolved not to leave that foule title of traitor as ane inheritance upon my posteritye. Yow may tacke my heade from my shoulders, but not my heart from my soveraigne‚Äô. In accordance with the first article of the treaty of Berwick, on 20 June of the same year he received his liberty, and immediately with his son proceeded southwards to the king's camp, where he remained till the king's departure for London on 29 July. Returning to Edinburgh, Huntly remained for some time with his three daughters in a lodging in the Canongate, and at the ensuing parliament he signed the covenant; but after the festivities connected with the marriage of two of his daughters were over, he gave up his house in the Canongate and joined the king in England. While Huntly was confined in the castle of Edinburgh, the Gordons, encouraged by the rumours of the king's advance towards Scotland, began to plunder the covenanters, and, having convened all the inhabitants of Turriff, compelled them to sign the king's covenant; but shortly afterwards the minister of Turriff convened the inhabitants, and, after causing them to crave public pardon for their breach of the covenant, absolved them from their oath and subscription of the covenant of the king. After Huntly had gone to England, his second son, James Gordon, second Viscount Aboyne, endeavoured to uphold the cause of the king in his father's territories, but was routed by Montrose at the Battle of the Brig of Dee, 19 June 1639, after a fiercely fought two- day battle. In 1640, Huntly's lands were plundered, and his castle of Strathbogie taken by General Monro, who placed a garrison in it. Charles I In 1641 Huntly accompanied Charles I to Scotland, and in the procession to the parliament rode after the lord high commissioner, but as he refused to subscribe the covenant he was debarred from taking part in the deliberations. He was nominated one of the king's privy councillors, but his name was subsequently deleted by the estates. On the king's departure for London he attended him to Berwick. On 1 January 1642 he arrived at Aberdeen on his way to Strathbogie, having been absent from his own territory since April 1639. He now found his affairs in so ruinous a condition that on the advice of his friends he renounced the estate to his son Lord Gordon, for the payment of his debts and provision of his children, reserving to himself the sum of 10,000 merks of yearly rent, with his castle of Strathbogie and his house in Old Aberdeen. In August 1643, he was summoned to appear before a convention of the estates at Edinburgh, and failing to do so he was denounced and registered at the horn. He therefore wrote, sending apologies for his non-appearance, but they were rejected, and when he offered to retire to France, a license was refused him. On 20 December 1643 he was visited in the Bog of Gight by a deputation of ministers sent to require him to subscribe the covenant, but this he declined. In the following January the sheriff principal of Aberdeen was directed to secure his apprehension, but declined to do so on the plea that the Bog of Gight was outside his jurisdiction. The duty was then transferred to the sheriff of Banff, but on his appearing at the Bog of Gight Huntly refused to recognise his commission. Hiding Huntly was apparently inclined to peace, but the action of the government drove him to assume hostilities in self-defence. On 19 March 1643-4 a band of his followers ‚Äòcame galloping through the Old Town to New Aberdeen,‚Äô and taking the provost and other magistrates prisoners, brought them to Strathbogie. On 16 March Huntly had published a declaration protesting that any acts of hostility he might commit were in self-defence, and on the 20th explained that his reason for seizing the provost and other magistrates was that they ‚Äòwere well known to have been scandalous fomenters of a dangerous distraction‚Äô. On the 24th he entered the city at the head of 240 horse, and on the 28th plundered the town of its arms and ammunition. Before leaving the city he drew up a band disclaiming the covenant, and binding all who signed it to the service of the king against the covenanters. A party of his followers afterwards made an attack on the town of Montrose, but retreated northwards to Aberdeen on the approach of the forces of the covenanters under Argyll. Huntly, notwithstanding the resolute words of his own band, did not await Argyll's appearance, but, though urged by his followers to give battle, left the city on the last day of April, ‚Äòcontrary to the expectation of many‚Äô. On Sunday 12 May 1644 his excommunication was read from the pulpit of Old Aberdeen. Argyll then advanced into his territories, but already Huntly had disbanded his followers, and shut himself up in Auchindown. Learning Argyll's approach he went to the Bog of Gight, and, having taken a supply of gold and silver and other necessaries, crossed over to Sutherlandshire in a boat. He then rode to Caithness, and went by sea to Strathnaver, where he remained till 5 October 1645. During his absence Argyll marched to Strathbogie and spoiled his lands. Huntly's sudden collapse and flight was not altogether occasioned by the advance of Argyll, but by disinclination to co-operate with his old enemy Montrose, who had now joined the king's party, and had been appointed lieutenant-general of the forces in Scotland. \\"The Marquis of Huntly,\\" said Gordon, \\"could never be got to join cordially\\" with Montrose, \\"or swallow that indignity\\", and Guthry affirms that Huntly \\"did his utmost to spoil the business in Montrose's hands\\". But Huntly's conduct was entirely passive. On the appearance of Montrose in Strathbogie the Gordons withdrew before him, and as all his efforts to open up communication with Huntly himself were vain, it was impossible to induce them to join the standard of the king. After the defeat of Montrose at Philiphaugh (13 September 1645), Huntly, who had some time previously returned to his territories, raised a force of sixteen hundred foot and six hundred horse, with which he stormed Aberdeen; but with his usual indecision he soon returned again to Strathbogie. In December of the same year Charles sent Robert Leslie, brother of General David Leslie, to Huntly, informing him of his desire to escape from the Scots army to the north, and asking him to levy a force to maintain his cause. This Huntly proceeded to do, but his preparations were to no purpose, as the king remained a prisoner in England. Huntly was excepted from the general pardon of 12 March 1647, and a reward of ¬£1,000 was offered for his apprehension. General David Leslie was despatched against him, and on his approach Huntly fled to the Lochaber mountains. Capture After evading pursuit for several months by constantly changing his hiding-place, he was at last, in December, captured by Lieutenant-colonel Menzies at midnight, as he was retiring to bed, at Delnabo in Strathavon. The capture was effected after a severe struggle with the ten gentlemen and servants who were in attendance on him, six of whom were slain in their efforts to defend him. On the news of his capture becoming known, about five hundred men under Grant of Carron assembled to effect his rescue, but Menzies, for greater security, carried him to the castle of Blairfindie in Glenlivet. Huntly, on learning their intentions, also sent them a message, dissuading them from the enterprise. When news of his capture reached the committee of estates, it was debated whether he should be immediately executed or reprieved till the meeting of parliament, and the latter motion was carried by one vote. After remaining two days at Leith, he was delivered up to the magistrates of Edinburgh, and sent to the Tolbooth. There he remained till 22 March 1649, when by order of the Scots parliament he was beheaded at the cross of Edinburgh. On being asked by one of the presbyterian ministers who attended him whether he wished to be absolved from the sentence of excommunication that had been passed against him, he answered \\"that as he was not accustomed to give ear to false prophets, he did not wish to be troubled by him.\\" Although he refused to admit that he had acted contrary to the laws, or had done anything to deserve death, he declared that he freely forgave those who had voted for his death. His body was brought to Seton, and was interred in the burial-place of that family.

It has a flexible, sewn spine which allows the book to lie flat on a surface when opened. Following the ISBN sequence numbers, books of this type may be identified by the abbreviation Hbk. Detail of \\"Twenty Thousand Leagues Under the Sea\\", first English edition (1873), showing cloth pattern on cover Hardcover books are often printed on acid-free paper, and they are much more durable than paperbacks, which have flexible, easily damaged paper covers. Hardcover books are marginally more costly to manufacture. Hardcovers are frequently protected by artistic dust jackets, but a \\"jacketless\\" alternative has increased in popularity: these \\"paper-over-board\\" or \\"jacketless hardcover\\" bindings forgo the dust jacket in favor of printing the cover design directly onto the board binding. Marketing If brisk sales are anticipated, a hardcover edition of a book is typically released first, followed by a \\"trade\\" paperback edition (same format as hardcover) the next year. Some publishers publish paperback originals if slow hardback sales are anticipated. For very popular books these sales cycles may be extended, and followed by a mass market paperback edition typeset in a more compact size and printed on thinner, less hardy paper. This is intended to, in part, prolong the life of the immediate buying boom that occurs for some best sellers: After the attention to the book has subsided, a lower-cost version in the paperback, is released to sell further copies. In the past the release of a paperback edition was one year after the hardback, but by the early twenty-first century paperbacks were released six months after the hardback by some publishers. It is very unusual for a book that was first published in paperback to be followed by a hardback. An example is the novel The Judgment of Paris by Gore Vidal, which had its revised edition of 1961 first published in paperback, and later in hardcover. Prices Hardcover books are usually sold at higher prices than comparable paperbacks. Books for the general public are usually printed in hardback only for authors who are expected to be successful, or as a precursor to the paperback to predict sale levels; however, many academic books are often only published in hardcover editions. Typical structure Hardcovers typically consist of a page block, two boards, and a cloth or heavy paper covering. The pages are sewn together and glued onto a flexible spine between the boards, and it too is covered by the cloth. A paper wrapper, or dust jacket, is usually put over the binding, folding over each horizontal end of the boards. Dust jackets serve to protect the underlying cover from wear. On the folded part, or flap, over the front cover is generally a blurb, or a summary of the book. The back flap is where the biography of the author can be found. Reviews are often placed on the back of the jacket. Many modern bestselling hardcover books use a partial cloth cover, with cloth covered board on the spine only, and only boards covering the rest of the book. Modern hardcovers are not sewn or stitched but the pages are glued onto the spine in much the same way as paperbacks. This means that they do not lie flat when left opened.

It is the largest city in the southeastern part of the country, and also the largest in the region of Loya Paktia. To the south and east of Khost lie Waziristan and Kurram in Pakistan. Khost is the home of Shaikh Zayed University. Khost Airport serves the city as well as the larger region surrounding the city. Geography Khost is located about 150 kilometres south of Kabul. Khost lies on a plateau of minimally altitude that extends to the East for about until the Pakistan border. 30 km to the North the peaks start up to right next to the frontier, while to the South, near the border, the average is around 1,800 m. =Climate= Khost has a semi-arid climate (K√∂ppen BSk though very close to qualifying as BSh). Khost is located in the \\"Khost Bowl\\", a valley with lower elevation than the surrounding highlands, because of which it is known for its pleasant weather. With a January average of , Khost has noticeably milder winters, as compared to the much harsher and snowy winters of the surrounding higher towns to the north, west, and south (listed anticlockwise): Parachinar, Tari Mangal, Aryob, Tsamkani, Khandkhel, Gardez, Zurmat, Sharana, Zerok, Urgun, Angur Ada, Kaniguram, and Razmak. However, frosts are still frequent in Khost during the mornings. Most unusually for Afghanistan, Khost receives a substantial proportion of its annual rainfall of from the South Asian monsoon, because it is open to the southeast (towards the lower elevation Miramshah) from which the moist winds come. Nonetheless, for a large proportion of the year Khost remains hot and dry, and in many years there is no significant rain during the summer. History = Khost rebellions = Between 1856 and 1925, Khost was the site of three rebellions, lasting from 1856‚Äì1857, 1912, and 1924‚Äì1925 respectively. =Soviet‚ÄìAfghan War= During the Soviet‚ÄìAfghan War, Khost was the object of a siege which lasted for more than eight years. Soon after the invasion of Afghanistan by Soviet troops, Afghan guerillas took control of the only land route between Khost and Gardez, effectively putting a stop to the Soviet advance. During the assault on the Zhawar Kili Cave complex, the Soviets used the Khost Airfield as an initial staging ground to insert troops into the combat zone, using Mil Mi-8 armed helicopter transport ships. =Civil war= As of April 1995, Khost was under the control of the Taliban.https://www.refworld.org/docid/3ae6ad3ac.html =Land use= Khost is a Provincial Center in eastern Afghanistan on the border with Pakistan. The eastern districts (1‚Äì3) are characterized by forests and residential land while the western districts (4‚Äì5) have more barren land with residential. There are also several waterways accounting for 5% of total land use. =2001‚Äìpresent war in Afghanistan= A business centre in the town centre under construction in 2007 Khost Mosque, which is the largest mosque in the city. Khost has been in American control since the 2001 US led invasion of Afghanistan. Due to its location in eastern Afghanistan, it was a hotbed for insurgent activity attempting to dislodge the American forces there. Like most other provinces, Khost is home to maneuver forces and a Provincial Reconstruction Team (PRT). Maneuver forces wage war against insurgents and assist the Afghan National Army and the Afghan National Police in operations, while the PRT handles the reconstruction aspects. In early 2007, Lieutenant Colonel Scottie Custer of the 82nd Airborne Division saw that the best way to limit insurgent activity in Khost was to forward-deploy some 187 paratroopers under his command to Force Protection Facilities in Khost's various district centers around sub-governors' mansions, to directly protect these, maintain a visible presence in population centers, and help mentor Afghan National Army and Afghan National Police units operating across Khost. The FPFs brought a broader sense of security and prosperity to surrounding areas. Bazaars, shops, and gas stations have improved the quality of life for local residents. The Mandozai Force Protection Facilities in Khost include a medical clinic attached to further assist Afghans in need of basic medical assistance. The offices of Khost's various sub-governors had experienced increased activity as Afghans went there to settle disputes and voice concerns instead of going through traditional tribal channels and bribes, cutting down on sectarian suspicion and strife. Throughout 2007 and 2008 roads had been improved, businesses were springing up and schools were being built, at least 50 in 2007 alone with another 25 planned for 2008. A new airport was under construction as the Khost Airfield was used by the US Military, creating new opportunities and jobs.WikiLeaks, \\"Six Month Assessment July 2007\\" The Provincial Reconstruction Team, led by CDR David Adams was instrumental in connecting the people to the government in Khost City, by ensuring the PRT was able to execute over $2.5 million under the Commanders Emergency Response Program (CERP) program. *May 2009 battle On May 12, 2009, several teams of armed militants stormed Khost, prompting a heavy 6-hour battle with US and Afghan National Army forces. Reportedly the attack involved 10 suicide bombers, of whom seven were able to detonate and three were shot by security forces. Coalition Forces, aided by the Afghan National Army and Afghan National Police, took the lead in repelling the attack. *Attack on CIA base On 30 December 2009, a suicide bomber attacked Forward Operating Base Chapman, a major CIA base in Khost, and killed seven CIA officers, including the chief of the base. On 18 February 2011 a suicide car bomber targeted a police checkpoint and killed 11 people. Demographics The urban population of the city of Khost is 106,083 (in 2015), mostly Pashtun (mainly from the tribes of Zadran, Mangal, Zazi, Tani, Gurbuz, Muqbal, Sabari, and Wazir), living in 11,787 dwellings, arranged in six municipal districts.

It has been used in official licensed Hasbro Scrabble games. Algorithms =Game phases= Maven's game play is sub-divided into three phases: The \\"mid-game\\" phase, the \\"pre-endgame\\" phase and the \\"endgame\\" phase. The \\"mid-game\\" phase lasts from the beginning of the game up until there are nine or fewer tiles left in the bag. The program uses a rapid algorithm to find all possible plays from the given rack, and then part of the program called the \\"kibitzer\\" uses simple heuristics to sort them into rough order of quality. The most promising moves are then evaluated by \\"simming\\", in which the program simulates the random drawing of tiles, plays forward a set number of plays, and compares the points spread of the moves' outcomes. By simulating thousands of random drawings, the program can give a very accurate quantitative evaluation of the different plays. (While a Monte Carlo search, Maven does not use Monte Carlo tree search because it evaluates game trees only 2-ply deep, rather than playing out to the end of the game, and does not reallocate rollouts to more promising branches for deeper exploration; in reinforcement learning terminology, the Maven search strategy might be considered \\"truncated Monte Carlo simulation\\". A true MCTS strategy is unnecessary because the endgame can be solved. The shallow search is because the Maven author arguespg14, Sheppard 2002 that, due to the fast turnover of letters in one's bag, it is typically not useful to look more than 2-ply deep, because if one instead looked deeper, e.g. 4-ply, the variance of rewards will be larger and the simulations will take several times longer, while only helping in a few exotic situations: \\"We maintain that if it requires an extreme situation like CACIQUE to see the value of a four-ply simulation then they are not worth doing.\\" As the board value can be evaluated with very high accuracy in Scrabble, unlike games such as Go, deeper simulations are unlikely to change the initial evaluation.) The \\"pre-endgame\\" phase works in almost the same way as the \\"mid-game\\" phase, except that it is designed to attempt to yield a good end-game situation. The \\"endgame\\" phase takes over as soon as there are no tiles left in the bag. In two-player games, this means that the players can now deduce from the initial letter distribution the exact tiles on each other's racks. Maven uses the B-star search algorithm to analyse the game tree during the endgame phase. =Move generation= Maven has used several algorithms for move generation, but the one that has stuck is the DAWG algorithm. The GADDAG algorithm is faster, but a DAWG for North American English is only 0.5 MB, compared to about 2.5 MB for a GADDAG. That makes a significant difference for download games, whereas the speed advantage is not important. (Note that unimportant does not mean that the difference is small, merely that users cannot tell the difference. The GADDAG is perhaps twice as fast, but both algorithms are fast enough.) =Rack evaluation= The first (1986) version of Maven used a set of about 100 patterns to value racks. Every single tile had a value (27 patterns). Each duplicate had a value (22 patterns). There were patterns for triplicates and quads for letters that have enough representation in the bag. Finally, the QU combination was a pattern. Soon after the first version, Maven acquired rack evaluation terms for vowel/consonant balance and Q/U distribution. Vowel/consonant balance was a table lookup based on the count of vowels and consonants left in the rack. Q/U distribution varied the values of Q and U using a table lookup indexed by how many of each remained in the bag. Shortly thereafter, Maven acquired a tile duplication evaluator. The idea was to vary a rack depending on the chance of drawing duplicates. For example, A is generally better than I as a tile, but if there are 7 A's and only 2 I's left in the bag, then maybe we should prefer to keep the I. Parameter fitting was accomplished by tuning the values to predict the total of future scores. Nowadays this would be called Temporal Difference Learning. This rack evaluation design was original to Maven. It was very successful in competing with the human champions of the day. The design was later extended by other researchers. Mark Watkins championed what he called \\"tile synergy patterns.\\" These are combination like ADES which form the basis of many high-scoring words. This is a natural extension of the design, which does significantly improve play. Maven's pattern set gradually expanded from the base set of 100 to well over 400. Maven has since switched to a completely different architecture, proposed by John O'Laughlin and implemented in Quackle. This is the \\"exhaustive\\" architecture, where the program has a different rack evaluation parameter for each of the 3 million possible combinations of 0 to 7 tiles. With the advances in computer power over the last decade, it has become possible to tune such large parameter sets. The downside of using an exhaustive approach is that Maven lost the ability to vary evaluations as a function of the tiles that remained in the bag. The point is that the exhaustive rack evaluator does not have terms that relate a rack's value to the possible draws from the bag. Maven's version of exhaustive rack evaluation has added that ability. In Maven, each rack has its own liner evaluator, where the value of that rack varies as a function of the chance of drawing a duplicate, the chance of drawing a vowel, and the chance of drawing Q and U. This system has 5 parameters per rack, for about 15 million parameters in all. =Simulation= The great human champion Ron Tiekert had studied Scrabble by playing out individual positions dozens of times, and tabulating results. He suggested that with Maven's speed, it should be possible to automate that process in overnight runs. Brian Sheppard named this process \\"simulation\\", though it goes by the name \\"rollout\\" in backgammon, and \\"playout\\" in Go. The process was to select N candidate moves using the score+rack heuristic. Then play out those moves hundreds or thousands of times to see which candidate performs best. You can vary the depth of the playout to suit your purpose; play two or four moves ahead to get a good idea about point differential, or play to the end of the game to measure winning chances. By the mid-1990s, computers had become fast enough that Maven used simulation to choose moves in competitive games under tournament time controls. Algorithmic improvements were important to scaling simulation for this purpose. The most important innovation was to vary the number of trials given to candidates so that more successful candidates receive more effort. It was also helpful to control the racks so that all candidate moves were sampled against the same, unbiased distribution. Analysis of games played by Maven's simulation engine suggest that Maven has surpassed the skill level of human champions. =Endgame= Strong play in Scrabble endgames is much harder than it looks. In theory, endgames are a game of perfect information, so the Alpha-beta pruning algorithm should work. But in practice Alpha Beta works badly on Scrabble. The problem with Alpha Beta is that some Scrabble endgames require 14 moves to play out, and it is not possible to search that deeply. This is not merely a theoretical possibility. When one player is \\"stuck\\" with a tile, then playing out all remaining tiles is impossible. In that situation the optimal strategy for both sides is usually to play one tile on each turn. Maven uses a different approach. The B* search algorithm is a selective-depth, progressive-widening algorithm that guarantees to find optimal solutions to two-player games when one can compute upper and lower bounds on the values of each position. It turns out that it is possible to estimate upper and lower bounds on endgame positions. These bounds are correct (that is, the true value lies within the interval) for the overwhelming majority of positions. Since B* is reasonably robust in the presence of a small percentage of error in the bounds, Maven can solve endgames that other approaches cannot. A further refinement makes Maven's endgame solutions asymptotically optimal even in the presence of errors. When the B* search terminates with a proof that one move is best, and there is still time remaining, then Maven widens its estimates by 1 point and searches again. These re-searches are usually very quick, because the tree from the previous search is still largely valid. Repeated use of this policy will progressively identify errors, starting with the smallest (and presumably most likely) errors. =Exhaustive pre-endgame= When only 1 or 2 tiles remain in the bag (\\"PEG-1\\" or \\"PEG-2\\"), it is possible to perform exhaustive searches of the state space. The case of a PEG-1 is important, because almost half of all games pass through that state. Maven can play out such states exhaustively in almost all cases. That is, for all legal moves Maven can play out the resulting endgames (up to 8 for each legal move), and calculate which side will win the game in each case. Because there are some situations (e.g., two blanks, stuck-with-Q) that require extra effort, the calculation is performed progressively. That is, Maven expands its analysis first where the decision is close and relevant. In a PEG-2 it is normally not possible to exhaustively examine all move sequences, so Maven goes as far as it can in the time available. One feature of these low-tile situations is that it is very hard to safely prune the list of legal moves. For example, the optimal play is ranked behind more than 50 other moves by the score+rack heuristic more than 1% of the time. This policy does not produce play that is theoretically perfect, because it is impossible to know what the true initial distribution of unseen tiles should be. Assuming a uniform distribution does well, and it is possible to calculate inferences about unseen tiles that marginally improves on that assumption. Another limitation is that Maven is not addressing the \\"hidden information\\" aspect of such situations. That is, in theory there are situations where players maximize expectation by randomly choosing moves according to a probability distribution. Maven is choosing pure strategies at each node.

Sheng's rise to power started with a coup d'√©tat in 1933 when he was appointed the duban or Military Governor of Xinjiang. His rule over Xinjiang is marked by close cooperation with the Soviet Union, allowing the Soviets trade monopoly and exploitation of resources, which effectively made a small part of Xinjiang a Soviet puppet state. The Soviet era ended in 1942, when Sheng approached the Nationalist Chinese government, but still retained much power over the province. He was dismissed from post in 1944 and named Minister of Agriculture and Forestry. Growing animosity against him led the government to dismiss him again and appoint to a military post. At the end of the Chinese Civil War, Sheng fled mainland China to Taiwan with the rest of Kuomintang. Sheng Shicai was a Manchurian-born Han Chinese, educated in Tokyo, Japan, where he studied political economy and later attended the Imperial Japanese Army Academy. Having become a Marxist in his youth, Sheng participated in the anti- imperialist May Fourth Movement in 1919. He participated in the Northern Expedition, a military campaign of the Kuomintang against the Beiyang government. In winter of 1929, he was called into service of Governor Xinjiang Jin Shuren, where he served as Chief of Staff of the Frontier Military and Chief Instructor at the Provincial Military College. With the Kumul Rebellion ongoing, Jin was overthrown in a coup on 12 April 1933, and Sheng was appointed duban or Military Governor of Xinjiang. Since then, he led a power struggle against his rivals, of whom Ma Zhongying and Zhang Peiyuan were most notable. The first to be removed was the coup leaders and by them appointed Civil Governor Liu Wenlong by September 1933. Ma and Zhang were defeated militarily by June 1934 with the help from the Soviet Union, whom Sheng invited to intervene, subordinating himself to the Soviet in return. As ruler of Xinjiang, Sheng implemented his Soviet-inspired policies through his political program of Six Great Policies, adopted in December 1934. His rule was marked by his nationality policy which promoted national and religious equality and identity of various nationalities of Xinjiang. The province saw a process of modernisation, but also the subordination of economic interests in Soviet favour. The Soviets had a monopoly over Xinjiang trade and exploited its rare materials and oil. In 1937, in parallel with the Soviet Great Purge, Sheng conducted a purge on his own, executing, torturing to death and imprisoning 100,000 people, the majority of which were Uyghurs. With the Soviets distracted by its war with Germany, Sheng approached the Chinese government in July 1942 and expelled the Soviet military and technical personnel. However, he still maintained effective power over Xinjiang. In the meantime, the Soviets managed to hold off the Germans and the Japanese launched an extensive offensive against the Chinese, which led Sheng to try to change sides again by arresting the Kuomintang officials and invoking Soviet intervention for the second time in 1944. The Soviets ignored the request, and the Chinese government removed him from the post naming him Minister of Agriculture and Forestry in August 1944. Sheng held the ministerial post by July 1945, and later worked as an adviser to Hu Zongnan and held a military post. He joined the rest of the Kuomintang in Taiwan after the defeat in the Chinese Civil War in 1949. In Taiwan, Sheng lived in a comfortable retirement and died in Taipei in 1970.  Early life  Sheng, an ethnic Han Chinese, was born in Kaiyuan, Manchuria in a well-to-do peasant family on 3 December 1895. He enrolled at the Provincial Forestry and Agricultural School in Mukden, aged 14. At age of 17, Sheng enrolled at the Wusong Public School in Shanghai, where he studied political science and economy. There, he became friendly with students and teachers of \\"radical inclinations\\". After graduating in 1915, under their advice he went to study in Tokyo, Japan. There, Sheng enrolled at the Waseda University, where he studied political economy for a year. During that time, Sheng expressed nationalistic attitudes and was exposed to \\"The ABC of Communism\\" () and other leftist publications. Ferment in China made him return to homeland. In 1919, he participated in the May Fourth Movement as a representative of the Liaoning students. During this period, he developed radical and anti-Japanese sentiments. By his own admission, Sheng became a Marxist the very same year and his political opponents claimed he became a communist during his second stay in Japan in the 1920s. During that time, he realised the \\"futility of book learning\\", and decided to enter a military career. He took military training in the southern province of Kwantung, known for liberal and reformist views. Later, he enrolled at the Northeastern Military Academy. Sheng entered military service under Guo Songling, Deputy of Zhang Zuolin, a Manchurian warlord. He rapidly rose to become Staff Officer with the rank of lieutenant colonel, and was given command of a company. Because of his commendable service, Guo sponsored his admission to the Imperial Japanese Army Academy for advanced military studies. Three years later he completed his studies, with minor interruptions in 1925, when he was involved in Manchurian politics. At that time, Sheng supported a campaign against Zhang, briefly returning to Manchuria. Although he supported the anti- Zhang coup, he was able to return to Japan with the support of Feng Yuxiang and Chiang Kai-Shek, from whom he received financial help and considered him as his patron. Sheng returned from Japan in 1927 to participate in the Northern Expedition A rising young officer, Sheng was given the rank of colonel and served as a Staff Officer of the Chiang's field headquarters under He Yingqin. During the Northern Expedition, Sheng proved himself as a worthy officer, serving in various command staff capacities. Sheng was a member of the Guominjun, a leftist nationalist faction that supported the Nationalist government in China. However, Sheng didn't join the Kuomintang because of his belief in Marxism. After the Expedition was completed, he was made chief of the war operations section of the general staff in Nanking, but resigned in 1929 over a disagreement with his superiors. After the apparent setback in his career, Sheng dedicated himself to the question of strengthening China's border defences.  Power struggle  = Rise to power = Sheng Shicai in c. 1928 Not long after Sheng's resignation, a delegation from Xinjiang came to Nanking to ask for financial aid. Governor of Xinjiang Jin Shuren asked one of the members of the delegation, Deputy General Secretary of Xinjiang Guang Lu, to find a competent officer to reorganise the provincial military. After discrete enquiries, Sheng was appointed to Jin's staff and arrived in Xinjiang via Soviet Union in winter 1929-30\\\\. Chiang Kai-Shek may have endorsed Sheng's decision to go to Xinjiang. Therefore, the appointment of Ma Zhongying, a Sheng's rival, as a commander of the 36th Division in Xinjiang embarrassed and frustrated Sheng. Sheng's welcome in Xinjiang was cold. Jin considered him a potential threat. Despite the doubts, Jin appointed him Chief of Staff of the Frontier Army and subsequently named him Chief Instructor at the Provincial Military College. In the summer of 1932, the fighting between Ma and Jin had significantly intensified. Ma's Hui forces were able to break the defence lines at Hami and enter Xinjiang through the Hexi Corridor. In December 1932, Ma's forces started the siege of √úr√ºmqi, but the White Russians and Sheng's troops successfully defended the city. In March 1933, the Manchurian Salvation Army, part of the National Revolutionary Army (NRA), came to their aid through the Soviet territory. During these events, Jin's prestige declined and correspondingly Sheng became increasingly popular. The culmination was the coup staged by the White Russians and a group of the provincial bureaucrats led by Chen Zhong, Tao Mingyue and Li Xiaotian on 12 April 1933, who overthrew Jin, who escaped to China proper via Siberia. Sheng, who was marshalling the provincial forces in eastern Xinjiang, returned to √úr√ºmqi to seize power in the midst of the chaos. Without conferring the Chinese government, the coup leaders appointed Sheng the Commissioner of the Xinjiang Border Defence, i. e., Military Governor or duban on 14 April 1933, resurrecting the old title. Liu Wenlong, a powerless provincial bureaucrat was installed the Civil Governor. = Rivalry with Ma and Zhang = Sheng's appointment as duban did not mean that his position was secured. Installment of Wenlong as governor meant that the bureaucrats had upper hand over Sheng, whom they considered their protege. His position was also challenged by Ma, as well as Zhang Peiyuan, Jin's old ally and a commander of the Yining region. The Chinese government, having learned that Zhang refused to cooperate with the new regime in Xinjiang and that Ma's forces represented the gravest threat to the new regime, tried to take the advantage of the situation and take control over the province. Without clearly stating whether it recognised the changes in Xinjiang, the government appointed Huang Musong, then a Deputy Chief of General Staff, a \\"pacification commissioner\\" in May 1933. He arrived in √úr√ºmqi on 10 June. The appointment of Huang as a pacification commissioner further strained the relations between Shang and the Chinese government. Sheng expected that the Chinese government would recognise him as duban, and that Huang's visit would affect that decision. Huang was ignorant of the frontier problems and his arrogant behaviour offended some of the provincial leaders. The rumours spread that Huang was already named a new governor or that Chiang decided to split Xinjiang into several smaller provinces. However, the true Huang's task was to secure the cooperation between the coup leaders and establish a new provincial mechanism with pro-Nanking stance. Sheng exploited the rumours and charged that Huang, an agent of Wang Jingwei had plotted with Liu, Zhang and Ma to overthrow the provincial government. On 26 June Huang was placed under house arrest, and the three coup leaders were also arrested and immediately executed. After the Chinese government apologised and promised Sheng the recognition of his position, Huang was allowed to return to Nanking three weeks after the arrest. Shortly afterwards, in August Chiang sent Foreign Minister Luo Wengan, as a sign of good will, to preside over Sheng's inauguration ceremony as a Commissioner of the Xinjiang Border Defence. However, at the same time, the Chinese government used Luo's visit to contact the two of Sheng's rivals, Ma in Turpan and Zhang in Yining. They were encouraged to launch an attack against Sheng. As soon as Luo left the province, the war broke out between Sheng on one side, and Ma and Zhang on the other. Sheng accused Luo not only for plotting but also for an assassination attempt. Luo's left Xinjiang in early October, and his departure marked the beginning of the era of deep alienation between Sheng and the Chinese government. In September 1933, Sheng accused Civil Governor Liu Wenlong of plotting with Ma and Zhang through Luo with Nanking in order to overthrow him. He was forced to resign and was replaced by Zhu Ruichi, a more controllable official. Sheng created a new bureaucratic hierarchy, nepotistically appointing new officials and replacing one of his predecessors. Confronted by Ma's army outside of √úr√ºmqi, Sheng sent a delegation to Soviet Central Asia to request assistance. Sheng later claimed that the delegation was sent under the aegis of Jin's request for military equipment. However, Sheng made a more comprehensive deal with the Soviets. His delegation returned in December 1933, together with Garegin Apresov, who would later be appointed as the Soviet General Consul in √úr√ºmqi. The Soviets provided substantive military assistance to Sheng, who in return gave the Soviets wide political, economic and military control over Xinjiang. Sheng's rival Ma Zhongying Ma sieged √úr√ºmqi for the second time in January 1934. This time, the Soviets assisted Sheng with air support and two brigades of the Joint State Political Directorate. With their aid, Sheng again defeated Ma's forces, who retreated south from Tien Shan, in a region controlled by the East Turkestan Republic (ETR). The same month, Ma's forces arrived in Kashgar, extinguishing the ETR. Hoja-Niyaz, president of the ETR escaped upon the arrival of Ma's troops to the Xinjiang-Soviet border, and in town Irkeshtam signed an agreement that abolished the East Turkestan Republic and supported Sheng's regime. In early 1934, Zhu Ruichi died and was replaced by Li Rong as Civil Governor. In January, the Chinese government approved Huang Shaohong's plan for military operation in Xinjiang, in order to put the province under its effective control. Huang had in mind to act pragmatically, offering support either to Sheng or Ma, whoever was willing to cooperate with the Chinese government. The pretext for the operation was the development of Xinjiang and adjacent provinces. For that purpose, the Xinjiang Construction Planning Office was established in Xinjiang with Huang in charge. With enthusiasm from Minister of Finance H. H. Kung, Huang purchased foreign- manufactured armored vehicles. By April, the preparations reached their final stage. However, the whole plan came to a halt in May because the Soviets have already entered Xinjiang and assisted Sheng against Ma. Under pressure from Sheng's strengthened military forces, Ma's troops retreated from Kashgar in June‚ÄìJuly 1934 to the southeast towards Hotan and Yarkand, where they remained until 1937. Ma himself retreated via Irkeshtam to Soviet Central Asia, accompanied by several officers and a Soviet official. Sheng sent requests to the Soviets to turn him in, but they refused. By this move, the Soviets intended to achieve dual benefit. First, by removing Ma from the Xinjiang's political arena, they wanted to increase Sheng's rule, which would give them higher control over the province; and second, they intended to use Ma as a leverage against Sheng in case he did not comply with their interests in the province. The armistice between the Hui forces and the Xinjiang government was agreed upon in September 1934. Zhang, after suffering defeat, committed suicide. Following the withdrawal of the Hui forces to Hotan in July 1934, Ma Hushan consolidated his power over the remote oases of the Tarim Basin, thus establishing a Hui satrapy, where Hui Muslims ruled as colonial masters over their Turkic Muslim subjects. The region was named Tunganistan by Walther Heissig. Tunganistan was bordering on two, eventually, three sides with Xinjiang province, and on the fourth side is bordered with the Tibetan Plateau. Despite the fact that negotiations were underway with the command of the 36th Division, the Dungan command did not make concessions on any issues. Moreover, the Soviets, intending to keep the 36th Division as a fallback against Sheng, vacillated regarding the complete annihilation of the 36th Division, giving refuge to the Dungan commanders and establishing trade relations with the 36th Division.  Rule  = Consolidation = On the anniversary of the 12 April coup in 1934, the Xinjiang provincial government published an administrative plan called the \\"Great Eight-Point Manifesto\\" or \\"Eight Great Proclamations\\". These included: the establishment of racial equality, guaranty of religious freedom, equitable distribution of agricultural and rural relief, reform of government finance, the cleaning up of government administration, the expansion of education, the promotion of self-government and the improvement of the judiciary. The program was practicable since each point represented a grievance that one nationality had against the previous government, which enabled Sheng to enact the reforms. The first two points which dealt with \\"the realisation of equality for all nationalities\\" and \\"the protection of the rights of believers\\" advanced the national and religious rights of the Xinjiang nationalities. Sheng sent a letter to Joseph Stalin, Vyacheslav Molotov and Kliment Voroshilov in June 1934. In the letter, Sheng expressed his belief in the victory of Communism and referred to himself as \\"convinced supporter of Communism\\". He called for the \\"fastest possible implementation of Communism in Xinjiang\\". Sheng also not only denounced the Chinese government, but expressed his aim in overthrowing it, suggesting support for the Chinese Soviet Republic and joint offensive against the Chinese government. Sheng also expressed his wish to join the Communist Party of Soviet Union. In a letter sent to the Soviet General Consul Garegin Apresov in √úr√ºmqi, Stalin commented that the Sheng's letter made a \\"depressing impression on our comrades\\". The content of Sheng's letter led Stalin to refer him as \\"a provocateur or a hopeless \\"leftist\\" having no idea about Marxism\\". In a reply to Sheng, Stalin, Molotov and Voroshilov refused all of his proposals. In August 1934, Sheng affirmed that the nine duties of his government are to eradicate corruption, to develop economy and culture, to maintain peace by avoiding war, to mobilise all manpower for the cultivation of land, to improve communication facilities, to keep Xinjiang permanently a Chinese province, to fight against imperialism and Fascism and to sustain a close relationship with Soviet Russia, to reconstruct a \\"New Xinjiang\\", and to protect the positions and privileges of religious leaders. Flag of Xinjiang, based on the flag of the Soviet Union, adopted in 1934 The dependency of the Sheng regime on the Soviet Union was further highlighted with the publication of the \\"Six Great Policies\\" in December 1934. The Policies guaranteed his previously enacted \\"Great Eight-Point Manifesto\\" and included \\"anti- imperialism, friendship with the Soviet Union, racial and national equality, clean government, peace and reconstruction\\". Sheng referred to them as \\"a skillful, vital application of Marxism, Leninism, and Stalinism in the conditions of the feudal society of economically and culturally backward Xinjiang\\". They served as the ideological basis of Sheng's rule. With the proclamation of the Six Great Policies, Sheng adopted a new flag with a six- pointed star to represent these policies. On 1 August 1935, Sheng founded the People's Anti-Imperialist Association in √úr√ºmqi. Garegin Apresov submitted a presentation to the Politburo of the Communist Party of the Soviet Union which accepted the creation of the association on 5 August. The association had to be composed of representatives of the Soviet special services' bodies. As the leader of the association, Sheng became one of the main figures of the Soviet regional policy. The creation of the association strengthened the Soviet position in Xinjiang. The propaganda of the association was the Anti- Imperialist War Front. The Xinjiang's Youth and the Xinjiang's Women served as the association's youth and women's wing respectively. In 1935, the association had 2,489 members, and in 1939, the Association's membership rose to 10,000. The membership was nationally diverse, and included Han, Hui and various Turkic peoples. In 1935 the British consul in Kashgar sent a report to the Foreign Office which stated that the influence of the Soviet Union on Xinjiang and its population increased. In order to check the reliability of these claims, the Chinese government sent a special commission to √úr√ºmqi. However, the commission concluded that Soviet assistance is friendly and commensurate with the assistance previously provided to the province by the Soviet Union. Only after this, the governments of Xinjiang, China, and the Soviet Union issued a joint statement in which the allegedly impending annexation of Xinjiang to the USSR was characterised as untrue. Sheng and the \\"reliable people\\" he appointed in the province played a special role in the fact that the Chinese authorities came to this conclusion. After this joint statement, the Soviet Union felt even more comfortable in Xinjiang politics. In 1935 the Politburo made several secret decisions to strengthen Soviet influence in the region. When in December 1936 Zhang Xueliang rebelled against the Chinese government and arrested Chiang Kai-shek, which led to the Xi'an Incident. Sheng sided with Zhang, who asked for his help, and intended to proclaim that his rebels were under Xinjiang's protection. Only after the Soviets condemned the incident and characterised it as a Japanese provocation, and demanded from Sheng to drop his support for Zhang, did Sheng refused to support Zhang. = Kashgar region and Islamic Rebellion = Two weeks after Ma Zhongying left for the Soviet territory, in early July 1934, Kashgar was occupied by a unit of 400 Chinese soldiers under the command of Kung Cheng-han on 20 July. He was accompanied by the 2,000 strong Uighurs commanded by Mahmut Muhiti, a wealthy ex-merchant. Thus, Kashgar was peacefully taken over by the Xinjiang's provincial authority after almost a year. To reassure the local population and to give himself additional time to consolidate his power in the northern and eastern part of the province, Sheng appointed Muhiti as overall Military Commander for the Kashgar region. Sheng wasn't comfortable with the Muslim officials in Kashgar, therefore a month later, he appointed his fellow Manchurian Liu Pin to the position of Commanding Officer in Kashgar. Muhiti was demoted and retained the position of Divisional Commander. Sheng's Han Chinese appointees took effective control over the Kashgar region, and foremost amongst them was Liu, a Chinese nationalist, and a Christian. Liu understood little about the local Muslim culture. Immediately upon his arrival, he ordered that the picture of Sun Yat-sen, the founder of the Chinese Republic, be hung in the Kashgar mosque. The local Muslim population was dismayed by the developments in Kashgar and considered that the \\"Bolsheviks had taken over the country and were bent on destroying religion\\". Also Sheng's educational reform which attacked basic Islamic principles, as well as atheistic propaganda, contributed to the alienation of the Xinjiang's Muslim population. Also in 1936, in the Altay region in northern Xinjiang, local Muslim nationalists, led by Younis Haji, founded the Society of National Defence. This society included influential Muslim figures. Sheng received information on the preparation of a powerful protest movement by this society. However, he did not have the capacity to suppress this movement with his own forces. Soviet invasion in Kashgar In Afghanistan, Muhammad Amin Bughra, the exiled leader of the East Turkestan Republic, approached the Japanese ambassador in 1935 proposing the establishment of the ETR under Japanese patronage and proposed Mahmut Muhiti as the leader of the newly established puppet state. The plan was later aborted when Mahmud in fear for his life fled from Kashgar to British India in April 1937. Muhiti became the focal point of the opposition to the Sheng's government. From the middle of 1936, he and his supporters began to propagate the idea of creating an \\"independent Uyghur state\\". In this case, he was supported by Muslim religious leaders and influential people from Xinjiang. Muhiti, having entered into contact with the Soviet consul in Kashgar Smirnov, even tried to get weapons from the Soviet Union, but his appeal was rejected. Then, by contacting former Dungan opponents, in early April 1937, Muhiti was able to raise an uprising against the Xinjiang authorities. However, only two regiments of the 6th Uyghur Division, stationed north and south of Kashgar in Artush and Yengihissar, came out in his defence, while the other two regiments, 33rd and 34th, stationed in Kashgar itself, declared their loyalty to the Sheng's government. Urged by the Soviets, Sheng's government sent a peacekeeping mission to Kashgar to resolve the conflict. The negotiations, however, did not take place. The Soviets tried to contact Ma Hushan, the new commander of the Dungan 36th Division, via Ma Zhongying, to disarm Muhiti's rebels. However, Muhiti, with 17 of his associated fled to British India on April 2 1937. Abdul Niyaz with his soldiers in Kashgar during the rebellion After Muhiti's flight to British India, Muhiti's troops revolted. The revolt was Islamic in its nature. Muhiti's officer Abdul Niyaz succeeded him and was proclaimed a general. Niyaz took Yarkand and moved towards Kashgar, eventually capturing it. Those with pro-Soviet inclinations were executed and thus new Muslim administration was established. Simultaneously, the uprising spread amongst the Kirghiz near Kucha and among muslims in Hami. After capturing Kashgar, Niyaz's forces started to move towards Karashar, receiving assistance from the local population along the way. In order to jointly fight against the Soviets and Chinese, Niyaz and Ma Hushan signed a secret agreement on 15 May. Ma Hushan used the opportunity and moved from Khotan to take over Kashgar from the rebels in June, as promulgated by the agreement. However, 5,000 Soviet troops, including airborne and armoured vehicles were marching towards southern Xinjiang on Sheng's invitation along with Sheng's forces and Dungan troops. The Turkic rebels were defeated and Kashgar retook. After the defeat of the Turkic rebels, the Soviets also stopped maintaining the 36th Division. Ma Hushan's administration collapsed. By October 1937, along with the collapse of the Turkic rebellion and the Tungan satrapy, the Muslim control over the southern part of the province ended. Soon afterwards, Yulbars Khan troops in Hami were also defeated. Thus, Sheng became the ruler of the whole province for the first time. = 1937-38 purges = Sheng Shicai (fourth from right) with Garegin Presov (fifth from right) and Chinese Minister of Education Chen Lifu (fifth from left) in √úr√ºmqi, October 1937 During the Islamic rebellion, Sheng launched his own purge in Xinjiang to coincide with Stalin's Great Purge. Sheng started the elimination of \\"traitors\\", \\"pan-Turkists\\", \\"enemies of the people\\", \\"nationalists\\" and \\"imperialist spies\\". His purges swept the entire Uyghur and Hui political elite. The NKVD provided the support during the purges. In the later stages of the purge, Sheng turned against the \\"Trotskyites\\", mostly a group of Han Chinese sent to him by Moscow. In the group were Soviet General Consul Garegin Apresov, General Ma Hushan, Ma Shaowu, Mahmud Sijan, the official leader of the Xinjiang province Huang Han- chang, and Hoja-Niyaz. Xinjiang came under virtual Soviet control. It is estimated that between 50,000 and 100,000 people perished during the purge. In 1937, Sheng initiated a three-year plan for reconstruction, for which he received a Soviet loan of 15 million rubles. At Joseph Stalin's request, Sheng joined the Communist Party of the Soviet Union (CPSU) in August 1938 and received Party Card No.1859118 directly from Molotov during his secret visit to Moscow. However, Sheng didn't set up the provincial branch of the CPSU in Xinjiang. Having eliminated many of his opponents, Sheng's administration had a staff shortage. For this reason, he turned to the Chinese Communists in Ya'an for help. In the circumstances of the united front against the Japanese, the Communists sent dozens of its cadres to Xinjiang. The Communists were mostly employed in high-level administrative, financial, educational and cultural ministerial posts in √úr√ºmqi, Kashgar, Khotan and elsewhere, helping to implement Sheng's policies. They also maintained the only open communication line between Ya'an and the Soviet Union. Among those sent by the Communist Party was Mao Zemin, a younger brother of Mao Zedong, who served as Deputy Finance Minister. = Nationality policy = Sheng Shicai (first row, third from left) at the founding of the Association for Promotion of the Han Chinese Culture During Sheng's rule, the Han Chinese represented only a small minority in Xinjiang. F. Gilbert Chan claimed that they made only 6% of the population at the time, while Sheng himself during his visit in Moscow in 1938, told Kliment Voroshilov that the Han made around 10% (roughly 400,000 people) of the population of Xinjiang. In his relationship with the Xinjiang's non-Han populace, Sheng adopted the Soviet nationality policy. The non-Han nationalities were for the first time included in the provincial government. The first principle of his Declaration of Ten Guiding Principles stated that \\"all nationalities enjoy equal rights in politics, economy, and education\\". He also reorganized Xinjiang Daily, the only regional newspaper at the time, to be issued in Mandarin, Uyghur and Kazakh language. The educational programme encouraged the Han to learn Uyghur and Uyghurs to learn Mandarin. Sheng's nationality policy also entailed the establishment of the Turkic languages schools, the revival of madrassas (Islamic schools), the publication of the Turkic languages newspapers and the formation of the Uyghur Progress Union. Sheng initiated the idea of 14 separate nationalities in Xinjiang, and these were Han Chinese, Uyghurs, Mongols, Kazakhs, Muslims or Dungan, Sibe, Solon, Manchu, Kyrgyz, White Russian, Taranchi, Tajiks, and Uzbeks. To foster this idea, he encouraged the establishment of cultural societies for each nationality. The description of Xinjiang as a home of 14 nationalities, both in Xinjiang, as well as in proper China, brought Sheng popularity. However, Sheng's policy was criticized by the Pan-Turkic Jadidists and East Turkestan Independence activists Muhammad Amin Bughra and Masud Sabri, who rejected the Sheng's imposition of the name \\"Uyghur people\\" upon the Turkic people of Xinjiang. They wanted instead the name \\"Turkic nationality\\" (Tujue zu in Chinese) to be applied to their people. Sabri also viewed the Hui people as Muslim Han Chinese and separate from his own people. Bughra accused Sheng of trying to sow disunion among the Turkic peoples. However, Sheng argued that such separation was necessary in order to guarantee the success of the future union. Another agenda from the Soviet Union Sheng implemented in Xinjiang was secularization with the purpose of undermining the religious influence. Moreover, many Uyghurs and non-Han people were sent for education abroad, most notably in Tashkent, Uzbek SSR to the Central Asia University or Central Asia Military Academy. With their return, these students would find employment as teachers or within the Xinjiang administration. Sheng's nationality policy served as a basis for the later Communist regime's nationality policy in Xinjiang, with few exceptions. = Relations with the Soviet Union = Lazar Kaganovich In March 1935, Lazar Kaganovich, who headed a newly established commission for developing areas of cooperation with Xinjiang, submitted a proposal to the Politburo. Based on these proposals the Politburo adopted a number of resolutions. Xinjiang received loans at low-interest rates, various economic assistance, and the sending of numerous consultants and specialists, which strengthened the position of the Sheng's regime. Kaganovich proposed the trade turnover with Xinjiang in 1935 to 9750 thousand rubles, of which 5000 thousand rubles were to come to the share of import, and 4,750 thousand rubles export operations. Since Kaganovich's proposal was deemed unrealistic, the Politburo once again discussed the issue and adopted the resolution \\"On Trade with Xinjiang\\" in June. According to the resolution, imports from Xinjiang were reduced, while the exports remained the same. The imports from Xinjiang included cotton, wool, leather, livestock, and other raw materials. The second section of the proposal dealt with financial issues. To improve the financial sector of the Xinjiang economy and strengthen the provincial currency, it was proposed to balance the budget as a priority task. To this end, it was envisaged to reduce costs in administrative and managerial and military areas, centralise expenses and tax operations, replace all taxes with general provincial taxes, ban the issuance of counterfeit money, reconstruct a provincial bank, etc. The proposal's third sections were concerned with agriculture and fourth with transport issues. In that matter, the construction of the main road connecting Xinjiang and the Soviet Union, the increase of cargo transportation along the Ili and Kara Irtysh Rivers and a number of other measures were planned here. These works were later expanded. In October 1937, begun the construction of the Sary-Tash-Sary-Ozek-Urumqi-Lanzhou road with a length of 2,925 km, of which 230 km passed through the territory of the Soviet Union, 1,530 km through Xinjiang, and 1,165 km through the province of Gansu. Several thousands of Soviet citizens worked on the construction of the road. The fifth section of the proposals prepared by the Kaganovich Commission regulated the issues of commodity credit. According to this section, machines and equipment supplied by the Soviets for the industrial enterprises being built and reconstructed in Xinjiang were to be registered as a commodity loan. The document related to the exploration work in Xinjiang stated that \\"geological exploration of minerals and, first of all, tin, in Xinjiang, was done at the expense of the USSR\\" and that the People's Commissar of Heavy Industry (NKTP) was to send a geological expedition. The search for tin, tungsten, and molybdenum was very important for the Soviets, so they established a special expedition for this task. The sixth section of the proposal dealt with personnel issues. The section suggests that the departments sending advisers and instructors to Xinjiang pay special attention to the qualitative selection of workers sent to Xinjiang. According to the Kaganovich Commission, the number of advisers and instructors sent to Xinjiang, including military consultants and instructors, should not exceed 50 people. On 11 September 1935, the Politburo adopted five resolutions regarding Xinjiang. In the second resolution, it decided to amend the Kaganovich proposal for the establishment of the joint-stock company and to replace it with a special Soviet trading office. Additionally, the Politburo discussed the issue of \\"Xinjiang Oil\\" and adopted a resolution. The resolution called for the preparation of the development of oil near the Soviet border under the firm of the Xinjiang government. Exploration was carried out in accordance with this decision and in 1938 oil fields were discovered in Shikho. The same year, the joint Xinjiang-Soviet company \\"Xinjiangneft\\" was established. Also, General Consul Apresov was given extended powers. Soviet officials in Xinjiang needed his permission to take any action and he could dismiss any Soviet worker \\"who did not know how to behave in a foreign country\\". Two days later he was awarded the Order of Lenin \\"for successful work in Xinjiang\\". Along with decisions concerning the economy, the Politburo also adopted a resolution on the possibility for Xinjiang young people to receive education in the USSR. At first, there was a quota for 15 students, which was expended to 100 in June 1936. In the 1930s, 30,000 Xinjiang people, preferably Chinese, received education in the various specialties in the Soviet Union. The resolutions also concerned the reconstruction of the Xinjiang army. The Soviet Union sent equipment and instructors for this end. Xinjiang received aircraft, equipment for aviation, rifle-machine-guns and artillery workshops, uniforms, personal supplies, and other military equipment. Soviets also opened pilot schools to train local airmen. The Soviets also proposed the reduction of army to 10,000 men, but Sheng refused this proposal and instead reduced it to 20,000 men. In an agreement from 16 May 1935, ratified without consent from the Chinese government, the Soviet government provided substantial financial and material aid, including a five-year loan of five million \\"gold rubles\\" (Sheng actually received silver bullion). At about the same time, again without the consent from the Chinese government, Soviet geologists started a survey for Xinjiang's mineral resources. The result was Soviet oil drilling at Dushanbe. During Sheng's rule, Xinjiang's trade came under the Soviet control. The Soviet General Consul in √úr√ºmqi was effectively in control of governing, with Sheng required to consult them for any decision he made. Alexander Barmine, the Soviet official responsible for supplying arms to Sheng, wrote that Xinjiang was \\"a Soviet colony in all but name\\". The Soviet stranglehold around Xinjiang was further enhanced through a secret agreement signed on 1 January 1936. The agreement included Soviet guarantee to come to the aid of Xinjiang \\"politically, economically and by armed force... in case of some external attack upon the province\\". By mid-1936, a significant number of Soviet specialists were active in Xinjiang involved in construction, education, health, and military training. The Russian language replaced English as the foreign language taught in schools. A number of Muslim youths, including Muslim girls, were sent to Soviet Central Asia for education. Sheng's government implemented atheistic propaganda, and Muslim women were encouraged to appear in public without a veil.  Approachment to the Chinese government  Between 1934 and 1942, there were no significant relations between the Sheng's government and the Chinese government. As the full-scale War of Resistance/WWII broke out between China and the Empire of Japan, the Chinese government entered the Sino-Soviet Non-Aggression Pact in a joint war effort against imperial Japan.https://www.jstor.org/stable/2151354?seq=1https://www.globalsecurity.org/military/world/war/prc- civil-su.htm However, with the German invasion of the Soviet Union, Sheng saw an opportunity to strike down Soviet proxies, the Chinese communists and to mend his relationship with the Chinese government now seated in Chongqing. Mao Zemin, Mao Zedong's brother, executed by Sheng Shicai in 1943 Sheng had long prepared to purge the Chinese communists in Xinjiang. In 1939, his agents filled reports on clandestine meetings, the constant exchange of letters, and the unauthorized content of some of their propaganda. A month after the German invasion, in July 1941, the communist cadre had been demoted or cashiered. Chen Tanqiu, the chief liaison of the Communist Party of China (CCP) reported in Yan'an that his relations with Sheng became \\"extremely cold\\". In the same month, the first sign of a thaw in the relationship between Xinjiang and the Chinese government occurred, a month after the German invasion, when Sheng allowed the Chinese diplomat in Moscow to visit Xinjiang for an official tour. On 19 March 1942, Sheng's brother Sheng Shiqi was mysteriously murdered. According to one version, the Soviets, fearing that Sheng Shicai might switch sides, tried to overthrow him. The coup started with Sheng Shiqi's murder committed by his wife, convinced to do so by the Soviet agents. The other version is that he was murdered by Sheng Shicai because of his close ties to Moscow. After his brother's death, Sheng continued crackdown on the Chinese communists. On 1 July 1942 he ordered their relocation in the √úr√ºmqi outskirts for \\"protection\\". On 3 July 1942, a major delegation of the Chinese government's officials arrived to √úr√ºmqi upon Sheng's invitation. Chiang Kai- Shek designated Zhu Shaoliang as a leader of the mission. The mission was initiated by Sheng's younger brother Sheng Shiji a few months earlier. The reaction of the Soviet Foreign Minister Vyacheslav Molotov followed soon after, as he presented Chiang the Sheng's ideas about the implementation of Communism in Xinjiang, his support for Chiang's arrest in Xi'an Incident and the offer to make Xinjiang a Soviet republic. However, the Chinese government disregarded Molotov's presentation. On 9 July, Chiang informed the Soviet ambassador that the Soviet authorities \\"must now deal with the central government of China\\" and are not permitted to \\"discuss anything with Sheng duban [i. e. military governor]\\". Chiang designated Zhu Shaoliang as a contact person for the Soviets. The later publication of Sheng's correspondence with the Soviet authorities, allowed the Chinese government to set up a special office in √úr√ºmqi, from where they handled Xinjiang's foreign affairs, and to set up the Kuomintang roots throughout the province, replacing the People's Anti-Imperialist Association, which he disbanded in April 1942. Sheng was appointed the head of the provincial Kuomintang. Both dubanship and civil governorship remained in Sheng's hands. The National Revolutionary Army troops weren't allowed to enter Xinjiang. As Wu Shaoliang shuttled between √úr√ºmqi and Chongqing, Sheng requested a permanent liaison to be appointed to handle his foreign affairs. The Chinese government appointed Wu Zexiang Minister of Foreign Affairs of Xinjiang. Ministerial position for a domestic post was unusual but approved by Chiang due to \\"special conditions and circumstances\\" in Xinjiang. Minister Wu's post was of consultative nature, and the Chinese government acted as an arbiter in the case of a dispute between him and the provincial authorities. Sheng demanded that Wu assumes more responsibility in dealings with the Soviets. Kuomintang in Xinjiang in 1942 The final months of 1942 saw the most turbulent period in Xinjiang-Soviet relations. In October 1942 Sheng demanded from the Soviet General Consul that all Soviet technical and military personnel be withdrawn from Xinjiang within three months. To the Soviets, who were engaged in the Battle of Stalingrad and desperate to retain the oil reserves at Dushanzi, this demand represented numerous logistical difficulties. On 3 November 1942 Sheng issued a directive prohibiting \\"organizations, groups, and private persons\\" to engage in \\"any trade activity involving foreign imports and exports.\\" The aim of the directive was to end the Soviet trade monopoly in Xinjiang. The Soviets withdrew their military and civilian personnel in March 1943. Despite the Sheng's ultimatum, only in March‚ÄìApril 1943 did the Soviets notify Sheng and the Chinese government of their withdrawal. With the Soviet gradual withdrawal, the Kuomintang representatives and personnel filled the void. In June 1943, four divisions of the NRA New 2nd Army commanded by Zhu Shaoliang were transferred to Xinjiang from Gansu. In October 1943, the Kuomintang effectively removed Soviet influence from Xinjiang. With the Soviets gone, in September Sheng ordered the arrest and execution of the Chinese communists. Among them was Mao Zemin, Mao Zedong's younger brother, who was among eighty-eight conspirators involved in the Soviet plot to overthrow Sheng.  Later tenures and retirement  As the Germans lost the Battle for Stalingrad, Sheng tried to return to the pro- Soviet policy. He ordered the arrest of the Kuomintang personnel, telling Stalin that they were Japanese spies, and telling Chiang that they were communists. Stalin, however, refused to intervene and left Sheng at the mercy of the Chinese government, which engineered his removal from office. Zhu Shaoliang convinced him to resign and to accept the post of Minister of Agriculture. Sheng officially resigned from his post and was appointed as Minister of Agriculture and Forestry on 29 August 1944. He left Xinjiang on 11 September 1944 to join the Chinese government in Chongqing. The post of Minister of Agriculture under Kuomintang was reserved for men out of power since the post was insignificant with the increasing power of the landlords. Chiang signed an order allowing Sheng to recoup the wealth beneath the governor's building. The storehouse contained fifty thousand taels of gold, chests full of valuable antelope horns, and endless blocks of opium. In total, Sheng removed 135 truckloads of wealth. Sheng's stay in Chongqing was troublesome. In April 1945, his former Finance Minister Peng Jiyuan was beaten in √úr√ºmqi, and sought refugee with Sheng after his recovery. Wu Zhongxin, his successor in Xinjiang, wrote that Sheng \\"started to lose his mind in Chongqing\\" and that in accordance with the tenets of Buddhism and as recompense for his past crimes, he has descended to the lowest depths of hell\\". At the Sixth Party Congress held in May 1945, a figurehead Uyghur leader Masud Sabri called for Sheng's head, however, Sheng was defended by Chiang. Sheng held the ministerial post until 30 July 1945. Sheng later worked as an adviser to Hu Zongnan in Xi'an. In 1949, Sheng accompanied the Kuomintang in Taiwan where he lived in comfortable retirement with his wife and four children. Sheng was interviewed by Allen S. Whiting and wrote his own accounts under the title Red failure in Sinkiang in Sinkiang: pawn or pivot?, published in 1958.

Early life and career Rogers was born in Kennington, South London, the son of Edward Rodgers, a soap machine operator and Lily May Rodgers Nee Cobb, an office cleaner and went to school in Lambeth. His idol as a youngster was Danny Kaye and Rogers won a holiday camp talent contest impersonating Kaye as a youngster, but he would later put all show-business offers on hold whilst he did his national service in the Royal Air Force. In the early 1960s Rogers appeared as a stand up comedian on the radio programme Billy Cotton Band Show, alongside singers such as Tom Jones, Cliff Richard and Alma Cogan and comedians Terry Scott and Hugh Lloyd. He went on to host Sunday Night at the London Palladium in 1974. Rogers also appeared on the comedy panel game Jokers Wild. He was asked by Perry Como to join him on his tour of Britain in 1975 as a comedian after a Royal Variety Performance. Bing Crosby later invited Rogers join him on his concerts of 1976 and 1977, to form a double act and sing \\"Gone Fishin'\\" with Crosby as a tribute to Louis Armstrong. Whilst on tour he was asked to film a pilot for a new TV game show. 3-2-1 Rogers became the presenter of ITV's variety gameshow 3-2-1 in 1978. It ran for just over ten years in a top-rating Saturday night slot. He earned ¬£130,000 a year in the early 1980s from 3-2-1 aloneThe Telegraph obituary - 3 May 2001 and combined this with a career as a highly paid after-dinner speaker and made regular cabaret and public appearances.The Telegraph - 3 May 2001The Stage - London - Obituary (10 May 2001).

Though initially the plan was for the show to carry on with Christmas and one-off specials. There was an Olympics special shown in September 1988 and a Christmas special in 1988 which was the final ever episode. In April 1996 Rogers told the Sunday Mirror that \\"The Oxbridge lot got control of TV and they didn't really want [the show]. It was too downmarket for them. We were still getting 12 million viewers when they took it off after 10 years. These days if a show gets nine million everyone does a lap of honour\\".Sunday Mirror, 7 April 1996. Later that year, in an interview with Garry Bushell, Rogers said, \\"Entertainment is in the hands of Oxbridge graduates. We treat our stars disgracefully. Look at ITV and Benny Hill. Look how the BBC treated Les Dawson. We need to make programmes that entertain an audience again.\\"The Sun ‚Äì 3 August 1996 After 3-2-1 In the early 1990s, Rogers fell on hard times and was declared bankrupt in February 1992, having apparently invested his fortune in a failed business venture, Wyvern Rogers Television.The Stage - 16 August 1990 His home at Little Chalfont, Buckinghamshire, was repossessed and Rogers' production company collapsed with debts of ¬£50,000. He moved from Buckinghamshire to a modest home in Haslemere, Surrey. In 1996, Rogers performed three times a week as the headline act in the summer show in Whitby, North Yorkshire. In 1997‚Äì98, Rogers appeared in the touring production of the play Danny and Me about his hero Danny Kaye, which often sold out. Towards the end of the decade, Challenge TV began re-running episodes of 3-2-1. In 2000, Rogers was seen during the sponsor credits for the ITV quiz Who Wants to Be a Millionaire? ‚Äì sitting in a dressing room with 3-2-1 mascot Dusty Bin and bemoaning the new show's success. In 1999 and 2000 Rogers made several commercials for fast food chain McDonald's. On 10 November 2000, Rogers appeared as a guest on TFI Friday. His final television appearance, which was screened at the end of January 2001, saw him playing the host of a downmarket quiz show in the Series 13 episode Let's Get Quizzical of the BBC children's sitcom ChuckleVision. Had he lived, he would have worked with his old friend Jackie Mason on a Vaudeville-type act in America which was due to start in October 2001. Personal life Ted Rogers was married twice, firstly to his childhood sweetheart Marge, in 1953, by whom he had two daughters Fenella and Dena, and then in 1979 he married Marion by whom he had a daughter Canna and a son Danny. Celebrity guest In 1989 Rogers appeared on the ITV game show You Bet! and in January 1993 on Celebrity Squares. In March 1986 he was featured on This Is Your Life and in April 1994 he appeared on Surprise Surprise.

Here œá is a Dirichlet character and s a complex variable with real part greater than 1. By analytic continuation, this function can be extended to a meromorphic function on the whole complex plane, and is then called a Dirichlet L-function and also denoted L(s, œá). These functions are named after Peter Gustav Lejeune Dirichlet who introduced them in to prove the theorem on primes in arithmetic progressions that also bears his name. In the course of the proof, Dirichlet shows that is non-zero at s = 1. Moreover, if œá is principal, then the corresponding Dirichlet L-function has a simple pole at s = 1.  Zeros of the Dirichlet L-functions  If œá is a primitive character with œá(‚àí1) = 1, then the only zeros of L(s,œá) with Re(s) < 0 are at the negative even integers. If œá is a primitive character with œá(‚àí1) = ‚àí1, then the only zeros of L(s,œá) with Re(s) < 0 are at the negative odd integers. Up to the possible existence of a Siegel zero, zero-free regions including and beyond the line Re(s) = 1 similar to that of the Riemann zeta function are known to exist for all Dirichlet L-functions: for example, for œá a non-real character of modulus q, we have : \\\\beta < 1 - \\\\frac{c}{ \\\\log \\\\big(q(2+\\\\gamma)\\\\big)} \\\\ for Œ≤ + iŒ≥ a non-real zero. Just as the Riemann zeta function is conjectured to obey the Riemann hypothesis, so the Dirichlet L-functions are conjectured to obey the generalized Riemann hypothesis.  Euler product  Since a Dirichlet character œá is completely multiplicative, its L-function can also be written as an Euler product in the half-plane of absolute convergence: :L(s,\\\\chi)=\\\\prod_p\\\\left(1-\\\\chi(p)p^{-s}\\\\right)^{-1}\\\\text{ for }\\\\text{Re}(s) > 1, where the product is over all prime numbers.  Functional equation  Let us assume that œá is a primitive character to the modulus k. Defining :\\\\Lambda(s,\\\\chi) = \\\\left(\\\\frac{\\\\pi}{k}\\\\right)^{-(s+a)/2} \\\\Gamma\\\\left(\\\\frac{s+a}{2}\\\\right) L(s,\\\\chi), where Œì denotes the Gamma function and the symbol a is given by :a=\\\\begin{cases}0;&\\\\mbox{if }\\\\chi(-1)=1, \\\\\\\\\\\\ 1;&\\\\mbox{if }\\\\chi(-1)=-1,\\\\end{cases} one has the functional equation :\\\\Lambda(1-s,\\\\overline{\\\\chi})=\\\\frac{i^ak^{1/2}}{\\\\tau(\\\\chi)}\\\\Lambda(s,\\\\chi), where œÑ(œá) is the Gauss sum :\\\\sum_{n=1}^k\\\\chi(n)\\\\exp(2\\\\pi in/k). Note that œÑ(œá) = k1/2.  Relation to the Hurwitz zeta-function  The Dirichlet L-functions may be written as a linear combination of the Hurwitz zeta- function at rational values. Fixing an integer k ‚â• 1, the Dirichlet L-functions for characters modulo k are linear combinations, with constant coefficients, of the Œ∂(s,q) where q = m/k and m = 1, 2, ..., k. This means that the Hurwitz zeta-function for rational q has analytic properties that are closely related to the Dirichlet L-functions. Specifically, let œá be a character modulo k. Then we can write its Dirichlet L-function as :L(s,\\\\chi) = \\\\sum_{n=1}^\\\\infty \\\\frac {\\\\chi(n)}{n^s} = \\\\frac {1}{k^s} \\\\sum_{m=1}^k \\\\chi(m)\\\\; \\\\zeta \\\\left(s,\\\\frac{m}{k}\\\\right).

It is a division of Warner Music Group and is based in New York City. History The label was launched in 1980 in the Netherlands. Roadrunner's initial business was importing North American metal-band recordings into Europe. In 1986, Roadrunner opened its US headquarters in New York City and later opened offices in the United Kingdom, Germany, France, Japan, Australia, Denmark, Russia and Canada. Early successes included albums from King Diamond (the first Roadrunner artist to enter the Billboard Top 200 albums chart) and Annihilator. The label also handled early Metallica releases in the Scandinavian region. The end of the 1980s saw the release of two albums that are now considered classics of their respective genres: Obituary's Slowly We Rot and Sepultura's Beneath the Remains. The 1990s saw the arrival of acts such as Life of Agony, Machine Head, Suffocation, Type O Negative, and underground grunge rockers Willard. As the 1990s wore on, several of Roadrunner's bands managed to make an impact on the mainstream, most notably Sepultura and Type O Negative. Sepultura's 1993 album, Chaos A.D., became the first Roadrunner band to crack the Top 40 on the Billboard album chart. Type O Negative became the first Roadrunner band to receive a certification from the RIAA; this was a Gold award (and later Platinum award) for the 1993 album Bloody Kisses, which was certified in 1995. The band also became the first Roadrunner band to receive radio play. In 2000, Slipknot became the first Roadrunner band to go Platinum. Nickelback were also very successful on the label, although they were signed to another label in their native Canada. Derek Shulman ran the label in the late '90s. Beginning in 2001, Roadrunner was distributed by the Universal Music Group through a share of the label owned by The Island Def Jam Music Group. This deal has now expired. On December 18, 2006, Warner Music Group signed an agreement to purchase a majority in shares (73.5%) of Roadrunner Records' parent company, Roadrunner Music Group B.V. This deal became finalized on January 29, 2007 after receiving regulatory approval in Germany. On June 11, 2008, Roadrunner Records was voted as the \\"Best Metal Label\\" by Metal Hammer at their Golden Gods Awards, an award that it has won the past four years in a row. The award was accepted by Sharon den Adel and Ruud Jolie of Within Temptation, one of Roadrunner's biggest acts. Roadrunner Records was significantly affected by Warner Music Group's legal dispute against YouTube, including having their account's YouTube partnership canceled. Most of the videos on their channel, however, are still viewable. There is even a disclaimer talking about Warner's dispute right on the channel. On November 11, 2010, Warner Music Group announced they had acquired the remaining of Roadrunner's stock. Roadrunner will continue to operate as a distinct brand within WMG, according to sources. Cees Wessels, the label's founder, remains CEO. On April 26, 2012, it was announced that Warner Music Group would make substantial cutbacks throughout Roadrunner Records worldwide operations. According to staff working at the company, The UK offices and the Canadian offices of Roadrunner Records are to be closed completely, with severe levels of cutbacks occurring across the rest of the label worldwide. It has also been announced that the Roadrunner office in The Netherlands is to close, and that the label's founder Cees Wessels is stepping down from his role of CEO. The following years saw several major Roadrunner acts leave the label, including DevilDriver and Alter Bridge (who both moved to Napalm Records, with Devildriver's catalogue being sold to The Echo Label), Opeth, Machine Head, and Soulfly (all of whom followed former A&R; of SVP Monte Conner to Nuclear Blast) and Dream Theater (who signed with InsideOut Music in 2017) In July 2017, British rock bands, Milk Teeth signed with Roadrunner Records. In June 2018, Roadrunner became a sub-label of Warner's Elektra Music Group division. Criticism Roadrunner has been accused of being a label only interested in current or trendy alternative music, reflected by their roster of mainly popular acts. The most notable example of this is the treatment of the main death and thrash metal bands on Roadrunner's roster throughout the 90s including Obituary, Deicide, Death, Gorguts, Fear Factory, and Pestilence, who were either dropped or left the label after ill treatment. One of the earliest names on the label, King Diamond (who was originally signed to then-Roadracer with Mercyful Fate before embarking his solo act), left the label due to alleged lack of promotional support for the 1990 King Diamond release, The Eye. Type O Negative left Roadrunner in 2006 following a dispute over the label releasing a \\"hits\\" compilation, The Best of Type O Negative, without prior notification to the band, which led them to accept a more appealing offer from SPV Records. In 2008, punk cabaret chanteuse Amanda Palmer was told by the label that they wanted to re-edit her video for \\"Leeds United\\" to make her look slimmer, causing a firestorm on the Internet from fans. On April 6, 2010, Palmer announced on her Twitter account that Roadrunner had dropped her. The most recent complaints about Roadrunner have come from one of the label's biggest bands Megadeth. Glassjaw members Daryl Palumbo and Justin Beck continue to speak unfavourably of Roadrunner, years after the problems the band experienced with them. They openly advise people not to buy their first full- length so as not to give the label money, and have repeatedly told fans at shows to illegally download the record. Palumbo has said: \\"Roadrunner is a joke. Roadrunner‚Äôs not even a real label. It has the power to be one of the superpowers in the heavy music industry. While labels like Victory Records, which is such a small hardcore label, is totally surpassing Roadrunner. Roadrunner is a joke. It's like the scourge of the music industry. Beck has said: \\"Seriously, don't ever support anything from Roadrunner ‚Äì they suck!\\" Palumbo has said that Roadrunner didn't put the band on enough tours: \\"We never toured half as much as we wanted to, I just wish we got to tour more in support of [Everything You Ever Wanted to Know About Silence]\\"; and \\"They are a miserable fuckin' corporation that does not bend for their bands, does not give their bands anything and they're just terrible businessmen....They had 2 cash cows, Slipknot and Nickelback, and every other project they had rode backseat to those bands, and then the second that the new Slipknot record came out and didn't go quadruple Platinum in the first few hours it was released they fuckin' turned their backs on Slipknot. That label just wants instant gratification where it sells its units and that's a joke. You can't run a major corporation with that as your business strategy\\".

The town lies on the R445, some 50 km (31 mi) west of Dublin ‚Äì near enough for it to have become, despite being a regional centre in its own right, a commuter town for the capital. Although Kildare gives its name to the county, Naas is the county town. History =Founding by Saint Brigid= Rich in heritage and history, Kildare Town dates from the 5th century, when it was the site of the original 'Church of the Oak' and monastery founded by Saint Brigid. This became one of the three most important Christian foundations in Celtic Ireland. It was said that Brigid's mother was a Christian and that Brigid was reared in her father's family, that is with the children of his lawful wife. From her mother, Brigid learned dairying and the care of the cattle, and these were her occupations after she made a vow to live a life of holy chastity. Both Saint Mel of Ardagh and Bishop have been credited with the consecration of Brigid and some companions, after which the woman established a community beneath an oak tree, on a hill on the edge of the Curragh. Hence the name , the church of the oak. Not too far away, on , lived the King of Leinster who had donated the site to the holy woman. A story told was that the King had offered Brigid as much land as her cloak would cover. When she spread her garment it miraculously stretched out to embrace the entire Curragh. True to his promise, the King gave her the fertile plain, and there the new community grazed their sheep and cows. =Carmelite Friary (White Abbey) Church, Kildare= The Carmelite Friars accepted the invitation of Lord William de Vesci and came to Kildare in 1290. This same de Vesci also established the Franciscans in the Grey Abbey and built the original castle of Kildare. With the suppression of the monasteries under Henry VIII, White Abbey was surrendered on 3 April 1539. The Friars, however, continued to minister clandestinely to the people of the area during the next two centuries. When the Penal Laws were relaxed in the 1750s, the Carmelites returned to Kildare and erected a church and a school close to or on the original 1290 foundation. This eighteenth century church served the Carmelites and the people in the district for more than one hundred years. The foundation stone of the present church was laid on 8 December 1884. The architect was William Hague who designed churches in the Pugin style. The church is therefore gothic in design and the builder was John Harris of Monasterevan, who used Wicklow granite and local stone from Boston, Rathangan. The church is cruciform in plan with the nave being set off with alternating window and arched roof-truss. The transepts are defined by polished granite pillars with moulded bases and carved caps which support arches in line with the walls of the nave. The side chapels are seen from the transepts and chancel through arches springing from moulded piers which also support the large chancel arch with its polished granite corbel shafts, moulded bases and carved caps. The principal entrance doorway faces east with pillared jambs, carved tympanum and moulded arches set in a projecting porch. The tower, with its lantern belfry, extends above the level of the nave roof. It has deeply recessed windows on each face and is finished with a moulded cornice. From this point, the tapering spire rises to a height of 40 metres and is surmounted by a cross. On the north transept wall of the church are inserted ‚Äì for safekeeping ‚Äì some interesting fifteenth/sixteenth century stone sculptures which came from the ruins of the Franciscan Grey Abbey. They are similar to the carvings from Great Connell and Dunfierth, also in Co. Kildare, and probably came from the same workshop. The stained glass in the church includes scenes from the lives of Our Lord and the Blessed Virgin Mary, from the Scapular Vision, as well as Saints Patrick and Brigid, and the four Evangelists. The rose window over the main entrance is of special interest with its centrepiece being the Prophet Elijah, the spiritual founder of the Order. The surrounding panels show St Telesphorus, St Dionysius, St Albert (Patriarch of Jerusalem), St Andrew Corsini, St Cyril of Alexandria, St Louis IX, St Angelus, and St Albert of Sicily. In February 2016, the Carmelite Church and Friary were entrusted to the Indian Carmelites. =Milestone in early motorsport= Kildare Castle In July 1903, the Gordon Bennett Cup ran through Kildare. It was the first international motor race to be held in Britain or Ireland. The Automobile Club of Great Britain and Ireland wanted the race to be hosted in Britain or Ireland, and Ireland was suggested as racing was illegal on British public roads. The editor of the Dublin Motor News suggested an area in County Kildare, and letters were sent to politicians, newspapers, railway companies, hoteliers, and clergy to win support and amend local laws. Kildare was chosen, among other candidate venues, partly because the straightness of the roads was deemed a safety benefit. As a compliment to Ireland, the British team chose to race in Shamrock green which became known as British racing green. The 528 km race ran on a loop through parts of counties Kildare and Carlow, including Kildare town. It was won by Belgian racer Camille Jenatzy in a Mercedes.

Its official nickname is \\"Garryowen\\", after the Irish air \\"Garryowen\\" that was adopted as its march tune. 3rd and 4th Squadrons were disbanded. The regiment participated in some of the largest battles of the Indian Wars, including the infamous Battle of Little Bighorn, where its enigmatic commander, Lieutenant Colonel George A. Custer made his last stand. The 7th Cavalry became part of the 1st Cavalry Division in the 1920s and went on to fight in the Pacific Theater of World War II, and several key battles of the Korean War, in which it committed the No Gun Ri massacre, and the Vietnam War. It also distinguished itself in the Gulf War and in the Global War on Terror where its Squadrons and Battalions now serve as Combined Arms Battalions (involving tanks and mechanized infantry) or as reconnaissance squadrons for Brigade Combat Teams.  American Indian Wars  The 7th Cavalry's trumpet was found in 1878 on the grounds of the Little Bighorn Battlefield (Custer's Last Stand) and is on display in Camp Verde in Arizona At the end of the American Civil War, the ranks of the Regular cavalry regiments had been depleted by war and disease, as were those of the other Regular regiments. Of the 448 companies of cavalry, infantry, and artillery authorized, 153 were not organized, and few, if any, of these were at full strength. By July 1866 this shortage had somewhat eased since many of the members of the disbanded Volunteer outfits had by then enlisted as Regulars.https://1cda.org/history/history-7cav/ By that time, however, it became apparent in Washington, D.C. that the Army, even at full strength, was not large enough to perform all its duties. It needed occupation troops for the Reconstruction of the South and it needed to replace the Volunteer regiments still fighting Native Americans in the West. Consequently, on 28 July 1866 Congress authorized 4 additional cavalry regiments and enough infantry companies to reorganize the existing 19 regiments (then under two different internal organizations) into 45 regiments with 10 companies each. After this increase there were 10 regiments of cavalry, 5 of artillery, and 45 of infantry. The new cavalry regiments, numbered 7th, 8th, 9th, and 10th, were organized under the same tables as the 6 already in existence. A regiment consisted of 12 companies formed into 3 squadrons of 4 companies each. Besides the commanding officer who was a colonel, the regimental staff included 7 officers, 6 enlisted men, a surgeon, and 2 assistant surgeons. Each company was authorized 4 officers, 15 non-commissioned officers, and 72 privates. A civilian veterinarian accompanied the regiment although he was not included in the table of organization. The 7th Cavalry Regiment was constituted in the Regular Army on 28 July 1866 at Fort Riley, Kansas and organized on 21 September 1866. Andrew J. Smith, a Veteran of the Mexican‚ÄìAmerican War, who had been a distinguished cavalry leader in the Army of the Tennessee during the Civil War, promoted to colonel, took command of the new regiment. Smith, however, commanded for only five months before Brevet Major General (Lieutenant Colonel) George Armstrong Custer assumed command on 26 February 1867. Custer graduated from the United States Military Academy in 1861 as the \\"class goat,\\" (i.e, last in his class) served with the 2nd Cavalry Regiment, and later commanded the Michigan Brigade (Wolverines) from 1863‚Äì1865.http://www.us7thcavalry.com/7-cav-e.htm He was brevetted to Major General on 29 June 1863, becoming the youngest man to ever do so in US Military history. Soon after taking command in early 1867, Custer led the 7th Cavalry out onto the Kansas plains to protect the westward movement of pioneers. That same year, Custer was relieved of his command for pursuing a band of Sioux and Cheyenne at such a rapid pace that several men deserted. He issued orders to shoot on sight and one man was killed while three were wounded. After one year without pay or a command, Custer returned to the 7th in 1868 and began preparations for a winter campaign. =First campaigns= Map of the battle On 26 November 1868, Custer's Osage scouts located the trail of an Indian war party. Custer's troops followed this trail all day without a break until nightfall, when they rested briefly until there was sufficient moonlight to continue. They followed the trail to Chief Black Kettle's village, where Custer divided his force into four parts, moving each into position so that at first daylight they could simultaneously converge on the village.Hoig 1980, p. 124. (Separating his forces into several columns in order to surround the faster Indians before they could flee became one of the 7th Cavalry's standard operating procedures.) At daybreak, the 7th charged as the Regimental band played Garryowen (many of the musicians' lips froze to their instruments), Double Wolf awoke and fired his gun to alert the village; he was among the first to die in the charge.Greene 2004, p. 129. The Cheyenne warriors hurriedly left their lodges to take cover behind trees and in deep ravines. The 7th Cavalry soon controlled the village, but it took longer to quell all remaining resistance.Greene 2004, pp 128‚Äì130. The Osage, enemies to the Cheyenne, were at war with most of the Plains tribes. The Osage scouts led Custer toward the village, hearing sounds and smelling smoke from the camp long before the soldiers. The Osage did not participate in the initial attack, fearing that the soldiers would mistake them for Cheyenne and shoot them. Instead, they waited behind the color-bearer of the 7th Cavalry on the north side of the river until the village was taken. The Osage rode into the village, where they took scalps and helped the soldiers round up fleeing Cheyenne women and children.at 0:42. National Park Service: Washita Battlefield trail marker #8 audio Black Kettle and his wife, Medicine Woman, were shot in the back and killed while fleeing on a pony.Lewis, 2004, p. 231 Following the capture of Black Kettle's village, Custer was in a precarious position. As the fighting began to subside, he saw large groups of mounted Indians gathering on nearby hilltops and learned that Black Kettle's village was only one of many Indian encampments along the river, where thousands of Indians had gathered. Fearing an attack, he ordered some of his men to take defensive positions while the others seized the Indians' property and horses. They destroyed what they did not want or could not carry, including about 675 ponies and horses. They spared 200 horses to carry prisoners.Greene 2004, p. 126. General Custer Marching to Cheyenne Village, 1868 Near nightfall, fearing the outlying Indians would find and attack his supply train, Custer began marching his forces toward the other encampments. The surrounding Indians retreated, at which point Custer turned around and returned to his supply train.Greene 2004, p. 128. This engagement would soon be known as the Battle of Washita River. =Yellowstone Expedition= From 20 June ‚Äì 23 September 1873, Custer led ten companies of the 7th Cavalry in the Yellowstone Expedition of 1873, during which, they fought several engagements with the Lakota Sioux Indians. The first of which was the Battle of Honsinger Bluff, on 4 August 1873. Near present-day Miles City, Montana, the 7th Cavalry's horses were grazing when a raiding party led by Chief Rain-in-the-Face approached upon them. Custer ordered the men to saddle up and began pursuit of the band alongside LT Calhoun and his aide, LT William W. Cooke. The Indians retreated into a wooded area, where a hidden force of 100‚Äì300 rode out to counterattack. Custer and his men retreated, covered by C Company (led by CPT Thomas Custer, George's younger brother), and dismounted his troops, forming a semicircular perimeter along a former channel of the Yellowstone in a wooded area. The bank of the dry channel served as a natural parapet. The Indian forces laid siege to the cavalry troops, but with little effect. About an hour into the battle, a force of nearly 50 warriors attempted to flank the cavalry's perimeter by traveling down along the river. They were hidden by the high bank, however a scout accompanying them was spotted and drew fire. The group, thinking they had been discovered, retreated.Lubetkin, Clash on the Yellowstone, supra, at 21 The flanking tactic having failed, the Indians set fire to the grass hoping to use the smoke as a screen to approach the cavalry perimeter. However, 7th Cavalry Troopers likewise used the smoke as a screen to move closer to the Indian forces and the tactic did not favor either side.Lubetkin, Clash on the Yellowstone, supra at 21 The siege continued for about three hours in reported heat.Lubetkin, Jay Cook's Gamble, supra at 247 The 7th Cavalry's senior veterinary surgeon, Dr. John Horsinger, was riding approximately 2‚Äì3 miles from the battle with Suttler Augustus Baliran, and believed the sporadic shooting in the distance to be Custer's men hunting game. When warned by an Arikara scout, he ignored him. Meanwhile, PVTs Brown and Ball of CPT Yates' Troop were napping by the river. Ball saw Dr. Horsinger and rode to join him, however, Chief Rain in the Face and five warriors ambushed the men and killed all three. PVT Brown, unnoticed by the Indians, galloped toward friendly positions yelling \\"All down there are killed!\\"Lubetkin, Jay Cooke's Gamble, supra, at 250 The remaining 7th Cavalry elements, under 2LT Charles Braden, charged the Indian positions. Simultaneously, Custer ordered his men to break out of the woods and charge, effectively scattering the Indians and forcing them to withdraw. Map with the battlefield of Pease Bottom (1873), Montana, and relevant Indian territories. The site of the battlefield had been U.S. territory for five years. The conflict between the United States and the buffalo seeking Lakotas was a collision between two growing empires.Calloway, Colin G.: \\"The Inter-tribal Balance of Power on the Great Plains, 1760-1850.\\" Journal of American Studies, Vol. 16, No. 1 (April 1982), pp. 25-47, p. 46. Most battles took place in areas the Lakotas recently had taken from the Crows. Between the battles of Honsinger Bluff (4 August) and Pease Bottom (11 August), a force of Lakotas attacked a Crow camp on Pryor Creek in the Crow reservation in a day long battle.Hoxie, Frederick E.: Parading Through History: The making of the Crow Nation in America, 1805-1935. Cambridge, 1995, p. 107.Annual Report of the Commissioner of Indian Affairs, 1873, Washington, 1874, p. 116. Note that the line for the 1868 unceded Lakota territory \\"east of the summits of the Big Horn Mountains\\"Kappler, Charles J.: Indian Affairs: Laws and Treaties. Washington, 1904, Vol. 2, p. 1002. may be disputed. A few days later, on the morning of 11 August 1873, the 7th Cavalry was encamped along the north side of the Yellowstone River near present-day Custer, Montana. In the early morning hours the Battle of Pease Bottom began when warriors from the village of Sitting Bull started firing at Custer's camp from across the river. By dawn skirmishing had broken out in several locations. After shooting at least 3 warriors across the river, Private John Tuttle of Company E, 7th Cavalry was killed in the morning fighting, warriors then crossed the Yellowstone River above and below the camp of the 7th Cavalry and attacked Custer's troops. The 7th Cavalry successfully defended their rear, front and center from this attack, then counter-attacked with a charge, breaking the warrior positions and driving the warriors eight or more miles from the battlefield. At about the same time, Colonel Stanley's column appeared in the distance several miles away and hurried to support the engagement. During the battle Second Lieutenant Charles Braden of the 7th Cavalry was critically wounded, along with three other Privates of the same regiment. Braden's thigh was shattered by an Indian bullet and he remained on permanent sick leave until his retirement from the Army in 1878. He would posthumously be awarded the Distinguished Service Cross in 1925 for his actions during the battle. At least one army horse was wounded during the engagement. Indian losses were unknown, however, estimates from Custer's post- battle report claim \\"their losses in killed and wounded were beyond all proportion to that which they were enabled to inflict on us, our losses being one officer badly wounded, four men killed, and three wounded. Careful investigation justifies the statement that including both day's battles, the Indian losses will number forty warriors, while their wounded on the opposite bank of the river may increase this number.\\"Custer, George A., Official Report, 15 August 1873 =The Black Hills and Yellowstone= Over the next several years, the 7th Cavalry Regiment was involved in several important missions in the American West; one of which was the Black Hills Expedition in 1874. The Troopers escorted prospectors into the Black Hills of South Dakota (considered sacred by many Indians, including the Sioux) to protect them as they searched for gold. In 1875, several 7th Cavalry Troops escorted a railroad survey team into the Yellowstone River Valley. This expedition brought them into constant contact with Native raiding parties. Custer repeatedly requested to share surplus food and grain with the Indians in order to prevent conflict, but was denied by the Standing Rock Indian Agency under the Department of the Interior. Corrupt Indian agents in the area sold food, supplies, and weapons promised to the Natives to white settlers, and what they did sell to the Indians was at unreasonable prices. Given their treatment at the hand of the Indian Agency, the Indians were forced to migrate. Custer found President Ulysses S. Grant's brother Orvil Grant to be the worst culprit of all. He was corrupt, paid and took bribes, and was accused of cheating, abuse, and dishonesty. President Grant promptly relieved COL Custer of his position when the latter spoke the truth about Orvil and other agents. =The Battle of the Little Bighorn= General Philip H. Sheridan intervened, however, and had Custer returned to his command in early 1876 in order to join the upcoming campaign against the Dakota Sioux. Custer's 7th Cavalry Regiment would be under the command of General Alfred H. Terry, and departed Fort Abraham Lincoln on 17 May 1876. The plan for the 1876 Sioux Expedition involved three marching columns under the commands of Major General George Crook, Colonel Custer, and Major General John Gibbon. Crook's column was stopped by the Indians at the Battle of the Rosebud, leaving two columns remaining. The 7th marched on 22 June with 700 troopers and Native Scouts, and made contact with the Indians the next day, causing him to turn west towards the Little Bighorn River. On 24 June, Custer's Arikara and Osage scouts identified a party of Sioux shadowing their movements, but they fled when approached. That night, Custer gave his attack plans for 25 June 1876, precipitating the Battle of the Little Bighorn. Reno's attack Movements of the 7th Cavalry A: Custer B: Reno C: Benteen D: Yates E: Weir Movement of Major Reno's three companies The first group to attack was Major Marcus Reno's second detachment (Companies A, G and M) after receiving orders from Custer written out by Lt. William W. Cooke, as Custer's Crow scouts reported Sioux tribe members were alerting the village. Ordered to charge, Reno began that phase of the battle. The orders, made without accurate knowledge of the village's size, location, or the warriors' propensity to stand and fight, had been to pursue the Native Americans and \\"bring them to battle.\\" Reno's force crossed the Little Bighorn at the mouth of what is today Reno Creek around 3:00 pm on 25 June. They immediately realized that the Lakota and Northern Cheyenne were present \\"in force and not running away.\\" Reno advanced rapidly across the open field towards the northwest, his movements masked by the thick bramble of trees that ran along the southern banks of the Little Bighorn River. The same trees on his front right shielded his movements across the wide field over which his men rapidly rode, first with two approximately forty-man companies abreast and eventually with all three charging abreast. The trees also obscured Reno's view of the Native American village until his force had passed that bend on his right front and was suddenly within arrow-shot of the village. The tepees in that area were occupied by the Hunkpapa Sioux. When Reno came into the open in front of the south end of the village, he sent his Arikara and Crow Indian scouts forward on his exposed left flank. Realizing the full extent of the village's width, Reno quickly suspected what he would later call \\"a trap\\" and stopped a few hundred yards short of the encampment. He ordered his troopers to dismount and deploy in a skirmish line, according to standard Army doctrine. In this formation, every fourth trooper held the horses for the troopers in firing position, with five to ten yards separating each trooper, officers to their rear and troopers with horses behind the officers. This formation reduced Reno's firepower by 25 percent. As Reno's men fired into the village and killed, by some accounts, several wives and children of the Sioux leader, Chief Gall (in Lakota, Phiz√≠), the mounted warriors began streaming out to meet the attack. With Reno's men anchored on their right by the impassable tree line and bend in the river, the Indians rode hard against the exposed left end of Reno's line. After about 20 minutes of long-distance firing, Reno had taken only one casualty, but the odds against him had risen (Reno estimated five to one), and Custer had not reinforced him. Trooper Billy Jackson reported that by then, the Indians had begun massing in the open area shielded by a small hill to the left of Reno's line and to the right of the Indian village. From this position the Indians mounted an attack of more than 500 warriors against the left and rear of Reno's line,Goodrich, Thomas. Scalp Dance: Indian Warfare on the High Plains, 1865‚Äì1879. Mechanicsburg, PA: Stackpole Books, 1997. p. 242. turning Reno's exposed left flank. They forced a hasty withdrawal into the timber along the bend in the river.Perrett, Bryan. Last Stand: Famous Battles Against the Odds. London: Arms & Armour, 1993; p. 8. Here the Indians pinned Reno and his men down and set fire to the brush to try to drive the soldiers out of their position. After giving orders to mount, dismount and mount again, Reno told his men, \\"All those who wish to make their escape follow me,\\" and led a disorderly rout across the river toward the bluffs on the other side. The retreat was immediately disrupted by Cheyenne attacks at close quarters. Later, Reno reported that three officers and 29 troopers had been killed during the retreat and subsequent fording of the river. Another officer and 13‚Äì18 men were missing. Most of these missing men were left behind in the timber, although many eventually rejoined the detachment. Reno's hasty retreat may have been precipitated by the death of Reno's Arikara scout Bloody Knife, who had been shot in the head as he sat on his horse next to Reno, his blood and brains splattering the side of Reno's face. Reno and Benteen on Reno Hill Bloody Knife Atop the bluffs, known today as Reno Hill, Reno's depleted and shaken troops were joined by Captain Frederick Benteen's column (Companies D, H and K), arriving from the south. This force had been returning from a lateral scouting mission when it had been summoned by Custer's messenger, Italian bugler John Martin (Giovanni Martini) with the handwritten message \\"Benteen. Come on, Big Village, Be quick, Bring packs. P.S. Bring Packs.\\". Benteen's coincidental arrival on the bluffs was just in time to save Reno's men from possible annihilation. Their detachments were soon reinforced by CPT Thomas Mower McDougall's Company B and the pack train. The 14 officers and 340 troopers on the bluffs organized an all-around defense and dug rifle pits using whatever implements they had among them, including knives. Reno‚ÄìBenteen defensive position Despite hearing heavy gunfire from the north, including distinct volleys at 4:20 pm, Benteen concentrated on reinforcing Reno's badly wounded and hard-pressed detachment rather than continuing on toward Custer's position. Around 5:00 pm, Capt. Thomas Weir and Company D moved out to make contact with Custer. They advanced a mile, to what is today Weir Ridge or Weir Point, and could see in the distance native warriors on horseback shooting at objects on the ground. By this time, roughly 5:25 pm, Custer's battle may have concluded. The conventional historical understanding is that what Weir witnessed was most likely warriors killing the wounded soldiers and shooting at dead bodies on the \\"Last Stand Hill\\" at the northern end of the Custer battlefield. Some contemporary historians have suggested that what Weir witnessed was a fight on what is now called Calhoun Hill, some minutes earlier. The destruction of CPT Myles Keogh's battalion may have begun with the collapse of L, I and C Company (half of it) following the combined assaults led by Crazy Horse, White Bull, Hump, Chief Gall and others.Michno, Gregory F., Lakota Noon, the Indian narrative of Custer's defeat, Mountain Press, 1997, p 284-285. . Other native accounts contradict this understanding, however, and the time element remains a subject of debate. The other entrenched companies eventually followed Weir by assigned battalions, first Benteen, then Reno, and finally the pack train. Growing attacks around Weir Ridge by natives coming from the concluded Custer engagement forced all seven companies to return to the bluff before the pack train, with the ammunition, had moved even a quarter-mile. The companies remained pinned down on the bluff for another day, but the natives were unable to breach the tightly held position. Benteen was hit in the heel of his boot by an Indian bullet. At one point, he personally led a counterattack to push back Indians who had continued to crawl through the grass closer to the soldier's positions. Custer's fight Fanciful 1876 illustration of Lieutenant Colonel Custer on horseback and his U.S. Army troops making their last charge at the Battle of the Little Bighorn Crow Indian Reservation, 1868 (area 619 and 635). Yellow area 517 is 1851 Crow treaty land ceded to the U.S. It was in the red area 635 that the battle stood. The Lakotas were here without consent from the local Crow tribe, which had treaty on the area. Already in 1873, Crow chief Blackfoot had called for U.S. military actions against the Indian intrudes.Hoxie, Frederick E. (1995): Parading Through History. The making of the Crow Nation in America, 1805-1935. Cambridge, p. 106.Annual Report of the Commissioner of Indian Affairs, 1873. Washington 1874, p. 124. The precise details of Custer's fight are largely conjectural since none of the men who went forward with Custer's battalion (the five companies under his immediate command) survived the battle. Later accounts from surviving Indians are useful, but sometimes conflicting and unclear. While the gunfire heard on the bluffs by Reno and Benteen's men was probably from Custer's fight, the soldiers on Reno Hill were unaware of what had happened to Custer until General Terry's arrival on 27 June. They were reportedly stunned by the news. When the army examined the Custer battle site, soldiers could not determine fully what had transpired. Custer's force of roughly 210 men had been engaged by the Lakota and Northern Cheyenne about to the north of Reno and Benteen's defensive position. Evidence of organized resistance included an apparent skirmish line on Calhoun Hill and apparent breastworks made of dead horses on Custer Hill. By the time troops came to recover the bodies, the Lakota and Cheyenne had already removed most of their dead from the field. The troops found most of Custer's dead stripped of their clothing, ritually mutilated, and in a state of decomposition, making identification of many impossible.Brininstool, 60‚Äì62. The soldiers identified the 7th Cavalry's dead as best as possible and hastily buried them where they fell. Custer was found with shots to the left chest and left temple. Either wound would have been fatal, though he appeared to have bled from only the chest wound, meaning his head wound may have been delivered postmortem. Some Lakota oral histories assert that Custer committed suicide to avoid capture and subsequent torture, though this is usually discounted since the wounds were inconsistent with his known right-handedness. (Other native accounts note several soldiers committing suicide near the end of the battle.) Custer's body was found near the top of Custer Hill, which also came to be known as \\"Last Stand Hill\\". There the United States erected a tall memorial obelisk inscribed with the names of the 7th Cavalry's casualties. Several days after the battle, Curley, Custer's Crow scout who had left Custer near Medicine Tail Coulee (a drainage which led to the river), recounted the battle, reporting that Custer had attacked the village after attempting to cross the river. He was driven back, retreating toward the hill where his body was found.Fox, pp. 10‚Äì13. As the scenario seemed compatible with Custer's aggressive style of warfare and with evidence found on the ground, it became the basis of many popular accounts of the battle. According to Pretty Shield, the wife of Goes-Ahead (another Crow scout for the 7th Cavalry), Custer was killed while crossing the river: \\"...and he died there, died in the water of the Little Bighorn, with Two-bodies, and the blue soldier carrying his flag\\".Linderman, F. (1932) Pretty-shield: Medicine Woman of the Crows. University of Nebraska Press. . (Preface ¬© 2003 by Alma Snell and Becky Matthews). In this account, Custer was allegedly killed by a Lakota called Big-nose. However, in Chief Gall's version of events, as recounted to Lt. Edward Settle Godfrey, Custer did not attempt to ford the river and the nearest that he came to the river or village was his final position on the ridge.Godfrey, E. S. (1892) Custer's Last Battle . The Century Magazine, Vol. XLIII, No. 3, January. New York: The Century Company. Chief Gall's statements were corroborated by other Indians, notably the wife of Spotted Horn Bull. Given that no bodies of men or horses were found anywhere near the ford, Godfrey himself concluded \\"that Custer did not go to the ford with any body of men\\". Cheyenne oral tradition credits Buffalo Calf Road Woman with striking the blow that knocked Custer off his horse before he died.Martin J. Kidston, \\"Northern Cheyenne break vow of silence\\" , Helena Independent Record, 28 June 2005. Retrieved 23 October 2009. By the end of the day on 26 June 1876, the 7th Cavalry Regiment has been effectively destroyed as a fighting unit. Although MAJ Reno's and CPT Benteen's commands managed to make good their escape, 268 Cavalrymen and Indian scouts lay dead. Among the fallen was Custer's younger brother, Thomas Custer, in command of C Company.

Crittenden, L Company =Nez Perce War= In 1877, one year after the 7th Cavalry's defeat at the Little Bighorn, the Nez Perce War began. The Nez Perce were a coalition of tribal bands led by several chiefs; Chief Joseph and Ollokot of the Wallowa band, White Bird of the Lam√°tta band, Toohoolhoolzote of the Pikunin band, and Looking Glass of the Alpowai band. Together, these bands refused to be relocated from their tribal lands to a reservation in Idaho, a violation of the 1855 Treaty of Walla Walla. When a US Army expedition loomed, the Nez Perce attempted to break out and flee to Canada to seek the aid of Sitting Bull, who had fled there after the Battle of Little Bighorn. Battle of Canyon Creek As the Army pursued the Indians through Idaho into Montana, elements of the 7th Cavalry joined the chase. Major Lewis Merrill and Captain Frederick Benteen, a veteran of the Little Bighorn, each led a battalion of the 7th. Merrill's Battalion consisted of Company F (CPT James M. Bell), Company I (CPT Henry J. Nowlan), and Company L (1LT John W. Wilkinson). Benteen's Battalion consisted of Company G (1LT George O. Wallace), Company H (2LT Ezra B. Fuller), and Company M (CPT Thomas H. French). In September 1877, these battalions were with COL Samuel D. Sturgis's column when they caught up to the Nez Perce raiding ranches up and down the Yellowstone River. The 7th Cavalry troopers were exhausted from their forced march and anticipated a rest after they crossed the Yellowstone River on the morning of 13 September, but Crow scouts reported the Nez Perce were moving up Canyon Creek six miles away. Seeing an opportunity, Sturgis sent Major Merrill and his battalion ahead atop a long ridge to head off the Nez Perce traversing the shallow canyon below. Benteen's battalion followed, while Sturgis stationed himself with the rear guard. Merrill was halted on the ridge by a scattering of rifle shots from Nez Perce warriors. In the words of his civilian scout, Stanton G. Fisher, Merrill's battalion dismounted and deployed \\"instead of charging which they should have done.\\" According to Yellow Wolf, a single Nez Perce, Teeto Hoonod, held up the advance for a crucial ten minutes, firing 40 well-aimed shots at the cavalry from behind a rock. The caution of the soldiers was perhaps due to the formidable reputation of the Nez Perce for military prowess and marksmanship. Gale-force winds impacted marksmanship, a factor explaining low casualties on both sides. When Sturgis arrived at the battleground, he perceived that his troops still had the possibility of capturing the Nez Perce horse herd. He sent Captain Benteen and his men on a swing to the left to plug the exits from the canyon and trap the women, children, and horses.Greene 2004 Merrill was told to advance into the canyon to threaten the rear of the Nez Perce column, but he was held up by an increasing number of Nez Perce warriors firing at long distance at his soldiers. He succeeded only in capturing a few horses. Benteen also ran into opposition and was unable to head off the horse herd, the Nez Perce occupying high ground and firing at the soldiers. A rearguard of the Nez Perce held off the soldiers until nightfall. Most of their horse herd and their women and children reached the plains and continued north. Three Troopers were killed and eleven wounded (one mortally) when the shooting stopped. Martha Jane Cannary, better known as \\"Calamity Jane,\\" accompanied the wounded by boat down the Yellowstone River as a nurse. According to Yellow Wolf, three Nez Perce were killed and three wounded. Despite pursuing the band for two days (traveling 37 miles the first day alone), the weary 7th was unable to catch up to their quarry. They awaited reinforcements and supplies on the Musselshell River for two days and continued on once they arrived. Battle of Bear Paw Map of Bear Paw Battlefield, part of Nez Perce National Historical Park In late September, the US Army expedition finally caught up with Chief Joseph's band of Nez Perce. Under General Oliver Otis Howard and Colonel Nelson A. Miles the expedition consisted of a Battalion of the 2nd Cavalry Regiment, a Battalion of the 5th Infantry Regiment, Cheyenne and Lakota scouts (many of which had fought against Custer at the Little Bighorn a year earlier), and a Battalion of the 7th Cavalry Regiment. The 7th Cavalry element was commanded by Captain Owen Hale and consisted of Company A (CPT Myles Moylan), Company D (CPT Edward Settle Godfrey), and Company K (under CPT Owen Hale himself). Captains Moylan and Godfrey were both survivors of the Battle of Little Bighorn, as were many of their men, making them a battle-hardened outfit. On 30 September 1877, the Battle of Bear Paw began. Miles' Indian scouts located the Nez Perce camp and the Cavalry were hastily deployed. At 9:15 AM, while still about six miles from the camp, the cavalry started at a trot, organized as follows: the 30 Cheyenne and Lakota scouts led the way, followed by 160 Troopers of the 2nd Cavalry. The 2nd Cavalry was ordered to charge into the Nez Perce camp. 110 Troopers of the 7th Cavalry followed the 2nd as support on the charge into the camp. 145 Soldiers of the 5th Infantry, mounted on horses, followed as a reserve with a Hotchkiss gun and the pack train. Miles rode with the 7th Cavalry.Brown, p.390 The Nez Perce camp was alerted by sentries to the US charge and quickly began to prepare. Women and children rushed north towards Canada, some Nez Perce began gathering the horse herd, some began packing up the camp, and the warriors prepared to fight. Rather than rushing the camp directly, the Cheyenne scouts veered off to the Nez Perce horse herd for plunder, and the 2nd Cavalry followed them. However, the 7th under CPT Hale followed the plan and charged into the enemy camp. As they approached, a group of Nez Perce rose up from a coulee and opened fire, killing and wounding several soldiers, forcing them to fall back. Miles ordered two of the three companies in the 7th Cavalry to dismount and quickly brought up the mounted infantry, the 5th, to join them in the firing line. Hale's Company K meanwhile had become separated from the main force and was also taking casualties. By 3:00 PM, Miles had his entire force organized and on the battlefield and he occupied the higher ground. The Nez Perce were surrounded and had lost all their horses. Miles ordered a charge on the Nez Perce positions with the 7th Cavalry and one company of the infantry, but it was beaten back with heavy casualties. At nightfall on 30 September, Miles' casualties amounted to 18 dead and 48 wounded, including two wounded Indian scouts. The 7th Cavalry took the heaviest losses. Its 110 men suffered 16 dead and 29 wounded, two of them mortally. The Nez Perce had 22 men killed, including three leaders: Joseph's brother Ollokot, Toohoolhoolzote, and Poker Joe ‚Äì the last killed by a Nez Perce sharpshooter who mistook him for a Cheyenne.Hampton, p. 296 Several Nez Perce women and children had also been killed. Miles later said of the battle that \\"the fight was the most fierce of any Indian engagement I have ever been in....The whole Nez Perce movement is unequalled in the history of Indian warfare.\\"Josephy, p. 632 The end of the pitched battle marked the beginning of a long siege while negotiations commenced. As the year 1877 began falling to winter, the cold siege ended when Chief Joseph surrendered, famously saying =Crow War= alt=Crow Indians Firing into the Agency 1887.jpg In 1887, the state of Montana was host to a minor war between the Crow and the Blackfoot Indians where both tribes raided each other's reservations in order to steal horses. In late spring, a Blackfoot war party made off with several Crow horses, prompting Crow war- leader Sword Bearer to lead a retaliatory raid against his Chief's decision. The raid stepped off in September, and the war party consisted of teenage braves eager to prove themselves in battle. During the raid, a number of Blackfoot braves were killed and the Crow recovered their horses without loss, but when they returned to the reservation, on 30 September, Sword Bearer made the mistake of showing off his victory to the Indian agent, Henry E. Williamson, who was known for being disliked by the native population. In what was called the Crow Incident, Sword Bearer and his men circled around Williamson's home and fired into the air and at the ground near Williamson's feet, prompting him to wire the Army at Fort Custer for help. When the Army force arrived, their cannon failed to fire, allowing Sword Bearer and his men to flee into the Big Horn Mountains. An expedition under Brigadier General Thomas H. Ruger and Colonel Nathan Dudley was sent to occupy the reservation to hamper Sword Bearer's recruitment. The force included five troops of the 1st Cavalry Regiment, one Company from the 3rd Infantry Regiment, and A Company from the 7th Cavalry Regiment under the command of Captain Myles Moylan, a veteran of the Battle of Little Bighorn and a recipient of the Medal of Honor for his actions during the Battle of Bear Paw. Heading into the mountains on 4 November 1887, the expedition caught up with the Crow band camped on the Little Bighorn River, some three miles from the site of Custer's Last Stand (some of Sword Bearer's followers were veterans of the battle). Company A, 7th Cavalry was posted on the right flank of the US line at the time of the battle. Sword Bearer charged with 150 mounted warriors but was repulsed and forced to retreat to a series of rifle pits dug into a wooded area near the river. The American cavalry then counterattacked. In the words of Private Morris; \\"The cavalry charged and took a volley from the Indian camp. At 200 yards we leaped from our horses and flattened out behind clumps of sagebrush. We traded shots for a while, until two Hotchkiss field guns on the hill began dumping two-inch into the Indian camp. That broke them.\\" During the fighting, Sword Bearer attempted to encourage his men by riding out in front of the soldiers but he was struck by rifle fire and fell to the ground wounded. Eventually some of the Crow began to surrender but Sword Bearer and the others remained in the mountains, only to surrender later on to the Crow police. It was during the march out of the Big Horn that one of the policemen shot Sword Bearer in the head, killing him instantly and ending the war. One soldier was killed and two others were wounded during what is now called the Battle of Crow Agency. Seven Crow warriors were killed and nine were wounded. An additional nine men were also taken prisoner and all of those who hadn't taken part in the battle were taken to Fort Snelling, Minnesota. The expedition returned to Fort Custer on 13 November.Greene, pg. 5-6United States Cavalry Association, pg. 28 =Ghost Dance War= In 1890, a great phenomena spread among the Indian tribes of the Great Plains. It was called the Ghost Dance, and it promised its believers that the white man would be thrown from the American continent, and the bison herds would be returned to their former range and size. White settlers near the Standing Rock Indian Reservation were alarmed by the number of Ghost Dance performers, which included the famous Lakota Chief Sitting Bull. James McLaughlin, the Standing Rock Indian Agent, requested military aid to stop what he saw as the beginnings to a dangerous uprising. Military leaders wanted to use Buffalo Bill Cody, a friend of Sitting Bull's, as an intermediary to avoid violence, but were overruled by McLaughlin who sent in the Indian agency police to arrest Sitting Bull. On 15 December 1890, forty Indian Police arrived at Sitting Bull's house to arrest him. When he refused, the police moved in, prompting Catch-the-Bear, a Lakota, to fire his rifle, hitting LT Bullhead. LT Bullhead responded by shooting Sitting Bull in the chest, and Policeman Red Tomahawk subsequently shot the Chief in the head, killing him. Fearing reprisals for the incident, 200 of Sitting Bull's Hunkpapa fled to join Chief Spotted Elk at the Cheyenne River Indian Reservation. Spotted Elk, in turn, fled to the Pine Ridge Indian Reservation to join Chief Red Cloud. A detachment of the 7th Cavalry Regiment under Major Samuel Whitside was sent to maintain order, and on 28 December they met with Red Cloud's band southwest of Porcupine Butte as they moved to Pine Ridge. John Shangreau, a scout and interpreter who was half Sioux, advised the troopers not to disarm the Indians immediately, as it would lead to violence. The troopers escorted the Native Americans about five miles westward to Wounded Knee Creek where they told them to make camp. Later that evening, Colonel James W. Forsyth and the rest of the 7th Cavalry arrived, bringing the number of troopers at Wounded Knee to 500.Russell, Major Samuel L., \\"Selfless Service: The Cavalry Career of Brigadier General Samuel M. Whitside from 1858 to 1902.\\" MMAS Thesis, Fort Leavenworth: U.S. Command and General Staff College, 2002. Wounded Knee At daybreak on 29 December 1890, Forsyth ordered the surrender of weapons and the immediate removal of the Lakota from the \\"zone of military operations\\" to awaiting trains. A search of the camp confiscated 38 rifles, and more rifles were taken as the soldiers searched the Indians. None of the old men were found to be armed. A medicine man named Yellow Bird allegedly harangued the young men who were becoming agitated by the search, and the tension spread to the soldiers.Utley, p. 211. Yellow Bird began to perform the Ghost Dance, telling the Lakota that their \\"ghost shirts\\" were bulletproof. As tensions mounted, Black Coyote refused to give up his rifle; he spoke no English and was deaf, and had not understood the order. Another Indian said: \\"Black Coyote is deaf,\\" and when the soldier persisted, he said, \\"Stop. He cannot hear your orders.\\" At that moment, two soldiers seized Black Coyote from behind, and (allegedly) in the struggle, his rifle discharged. At the same moment, Yellow Bird threw some dust into the air, and approximately five young Lakota men with concealed weapons threw aside their blankets and fired their rifles at Troop K of the 7th. After this initial exchange, the firing became indiscriminate. At first all firing was at close range; half the Indian men were killed or wounded before they had a chance to get off any shots. Some of the Indians grabbed rifles from the piles of confiscated weapons and opened fire on the soldiers. With no cover, and with many of the Indians unarmed, this lasted a few minutes at most. While the Indian warriors and soldiers were shooting at close range, other soldiers (from Battery E, 1st Artillery) used the Hotchkiss guns against the tipi camp full of women and children. It is believed that many of the soldiers were victims of friendly fire from their own Hotchkiss guns. The Indian women and children fled the camp, seeking shelter in a nearby ravine from the crossfire. The officers had lost all control of their men. Some of the soldiers fanned out and finished off the wounded. Others leaped onto their horses and pursued the Natives (men, women, and children), in some cases for miles across the prairies. In less than an hour, at least 150 Lakota had been killed and 50 wounded. Historian Dee Brown, in Bury My Heart at Wounded Knee, mentions an estimate of 300Derived from Nelson Miles' report of some 300 snow covered forms during his inspection of the field three days later, Miles in a letter states: \\"The official reports make the number killed 90 warriors and approximately 200 women and children.\\". of the original 350 having been killed or wounded and that the soldiers loaded 51 survivors (4 men and 47 women and children) onto wagons and took them to the Pine Ridge Reservation.Brown, pp. 179‚Äì180 Army casualties numbered 25 dead and 39 wounded. Drexel Mission Fight On 30 December 1890, the day after Wounded Knee, COL Forsyth and 8 Troops of the 7th Cavalry and one platoon of Artillery (the same units that had been engaged at Wounded Knee), conducted a reconnaissance to see if the nearby Catholic Mission had been torched by the Indians. In what became known as the Drexel Mission Fight, the 7th Cavalry was ambushed in a valley by Brul√© Lakota under Chief Two Strike from the Rosebud Indian Reservation. Struggling through the thick snow and pinned in the valley, the Troopers' situation was perilous. After exchanging fire with the Indians, the shots were heard by the nearby 9th Cavalry (Buffalo Soldiers) under Major Guy Vernor Henry who rode to the rescue. The Indians were driven off.

Sill), then overseas in Cuba (Camp Columbia) from 1899 to 1902. An enlisted trooper with the Seventh Cavalry, \\"B\\" Company, from May 1896 until March 1897 at Fort Grant Arizona Territory was author Edgar Rice Burroughs. The regiment served in the Philippines during the Philippine‚ÄìAmerican War from 1904 through 1907, with a second tour from 1911 through 1915. Here they conducted counter-insurgency operations against Filipino guerrillas in the jungles and rural areas of the islands. =Border war= Back in the United States, the regiment was again stationed in the southwest, in Arizona (Camp Harvey J. Jones), where it patrolled the U.S.-Mexico border and later was part of the Mexican Punitive Expedition of 1916 to 1917. During this expedition, the 7th Cavalry executed what is regarded as America's \\"last true Cavalry charge\\" at the Battle of Guerrero.2nd Battalion, 7th Cavalry Regiment Colonel George A. Dodd, commanding a force of 370 from the 7th Cavalry, led his Troopers into the Mexican State of Chihuahua in pursuit of Pancho Villa. After riding 400 miles in 14 days, Dodd's exhausted Troopers finally caught up with Villa's force in the town of Guerrero on 29 March 1916. The 7th Cavalry was low on rations, and had to fight a battle against a well defended town. According to varying sources, there were between 200 and 500 Villistas at Guerrero, spread out across the town, and for the first couple of hours after the 7th Cavalry's arrival, Dodd had his men attempt to ascertain the number of enemy forces. It wasn't until 8:00 am that the order to attack was given. Dodd divided his command into three contingents with instructions to charge and surround the town in order to cut off the Villistas's avenue of escape. When the Americans charged, fighting erupted at three points. After the charge the Americans dismounted to fight the Mexicans on foot. Guerrero was flanked by mountains on two sides which made it difficult to surround the town and the Villistas used them for cover. There were also not enough cavalrymen to cover all of the escape routes so the majority of the Mexicans got away, including Pancho Villa. Part of the Villista army mounted up and retreated east through a valley. They were pursued by some of the American cavalrymen in a ten-mile running engagement. Another force of Mexicans calmly rode out of Guerrero, pretending to be Carrancistas by displaying a Mexican national flag, this group went unmolested by the 7th Cavalry. Villa lost his friend, General Elicio Hernandez, and fifty-five others killed in the battle and another thirty-five wounded. The Americans suffered only five wounded during a five- hour battle. Colonel Dodd and his men also captured thirty-six horses and mules, two machine guns, many small arms and some war supplies. Several condemned Carrancista prisoners were liberated. Initially the Battle of Guerrero was thought to be a great opening success in the campaign but it later proved to be a disappointment as it would be the closest they came to capturing Villa in battle. However, the battle was considered the \\"most successful single engagement of Pershing's Punitive Expedition.\\" After the retreat the Villista army dispersed and for the next three months they no longer posed a significant threat to the United States military. Villa himself hid out in the hills while his knee healed. One day, not long after the battle, Villa was camped at the end of a valley and watched a troop of Pershing's cavalrymen ride by. Villa heard them singing \\"It's a Long Way to Tipperary,\\" this would be the last time Americans got so close to the rebel. News of the victory was widely circulated in the United States, prompting the Senate's approval of Colonel Dodd's promotion to brigadier general. In December 1917, 7th Cavalry was assigned to the 15th Cavalry Division, an on- paper organization designed for service in France during World War I that was never more than a simple headquarters. This was because no significant role emerged for mounted troops on the Western Front during the 19 months between the entry of the United States into the war and the Armistice of 11 November 1918.Randy Stern: The Horse Soldier, 1776-1943 The 7th Cavalry was released from this assignment in May 1918. On 15 June 1919, Pancho Villa fought his last battle with the Americans. At the Battle of Ciudad Ju√°rez, Villista and Carrancista forces engaged in combat in Ciudad Ju√°rez just south of El Paso, Texas across the Rio Grande. The 7th Cavalry was temporarily at Fort Bliss and responded to the battle when Villista snipers killed and wounded US Soldiers of the 82nd Field Artillery Regiment. The 12th Infantry Regiment, the 82nd Field Artillery, the 5th Cavalry Regiment, and the 7th Cavalry Regiment quickly crossed the Santa Fe Bridge into Mexico to deal with the threat. Advancing towards the enemy, the 7th Cavalry covered the main body's flank, and then, under the protection of artillery fire, charged the Villistas and routed them. =Interwar period= On 13 September 1921, 7th Cavalry Regiment was assigned to the 1st Cavalry Division, which assignment was maintained until 1957. The division and its 2nd Cavalry Brigade was garrisoned at Fort Bliss, Texas, while the 1st Cavalry Brigade was garrisoned at Douglas, Arizona. Additional garrison points were used as well. The 7th Cavalry Regiment continued to train as horse cavalry right up to the American entry into World War II, including participation in several training maneuvers at the Louisiana Maneuver Area on 26 April ‚Äì 28 May 1940; 12‚Äì22 August 1940; and 8 August ‚Äì 4 October 1941. World War II On 7 December 1941, the Empire of Japan attacked the US fleet anchored at Pearl Harbor, thrusting the United States into World War II, which had already been raging since 1939. The Troopers of the 1st Cavalry Division readied their horses, their equipment, and themselves for the coming war, and were finally alerted for deployment in 1943. Despite being a mounted Cavalry unit since 1866, the 7th Cavalry left its mounts behind in Texas as they left for war; the age of the horse-cavalry was over. The newly dismounted 7th Cavalry Regiment was sent to fight in the Pacific Theater of Operations and the last units left Fort Bliss for Camp Stoneman, CA in June 1943. On 3 July, the 7th Cavalry boarded the SS Monterey and the SS George Washington bound for Australia. The regiment arrived on 26 July, and was posted to Camp Strathpine, Queensland where they underwent six months of intensive jungle warfare training, and conducted amphibious assault training at nearby Moreton Bay. =Admiralty Islands campaign= In January 1944, the 7th Cavalry sailed for Oro Bay on the island of New Guinea. Despite the ongoing New Guinea Campaign, the 7th Cavalry was held in reserve and was organized into \\"Task Force Brewer\\" for another mission. On 27 February, TF Brewer embarked from Cape Sudest under the command of Brigadier General William C. Chase. Their objective was the remote Los Negros Island in the Admiralty Islands which had an important airfield occupied by the Japanese. The 5th Cavalry Regiment landed on 29 February and began the invasion. alt=Larger scale map shows all of Los Negros. The morning of 4 March saw the arrival of the 2nd Squadron, 7th Cavalry, which relieved the 2nd Squadron, 5th Cavalry. The next day Major General Innis P. Swift, the commander of the 1st Cavalry Division, arrived aboard Bush and assumed command. He ordered the 2nd Squadron, 7th Cavalry to attack across the native skidway. The 2nd Squadron, 5th Cavalry therefore went back into the line to relieve them. While the relief was taking place, the Japanese launched a daylight attack. This was repulsed by the cavalrymen, with the help of artillery and mortar fire, but the American attack was delayed until late afternoon. It then ran into a Japanese minefield and by dawn the advance had only reached as far as the skidway.Frierson, The Admiralties: Operations of the 1st Cavalry Division, pp. 58‚Äì60. On the morning of 6 March, another convoy arrived at Hyane Harbour: five LSTs, each towing an LCM, with the 12th Cavalry and other units and equipment including five Landing Vehicles Tracked (LVTs) of the 592nd EBSR, three M3 light tanks of the 603rd Tank Company, and twelve 105mm howitzers of the 271st Field Artillery Battalion.Miller, Cartwheel: The Reduction of Rabaul, p. 338. The 12th Cavalry was ordered to follow the 2nd Squadron, 7th Cavalry in its advance to the north, and to capture the Salami Plantation. The road to Salami was little more than a muddy track in which vehicles soon became bogged. The Japanese also obstructed the route with ditches, felled trees, snipers, and booby traps.Frierson, The Admiralties: Operations of the 1st Cavalry Division, pp. 61‚Äì63. Despite incessant rain and suicidal Japanese counterattacks, the 7th Cavalry captured their objectives and mop-up operations were being conducted from 10‚Äì11 March. Manus Island, to the west, was the next target. The main landing was to be at Lugos Mission, but General Swift postponed the landing there and ordered the 2nd Squadron, 7th Cavalry to capture Hauwei.Frierson, The Admiralties: Operations of the 1st Cavalry Division, p. 80. The landing was covered by the destroyers Arunta, Bush, Stockton and ;Gill, Royal Australian Navy 1942‚Äì1945, p. 378. a pair of rocket- firing LCVPs and the LCM (flak), which fired 168 rockets; the guns of the 61st Field Artillery Battalion on Los Negros;Casey, Amphibian Engineer Operations, p. 240. and six Kittyhawks of No. 76 Squadron dropped bombs.Odgers, Air War Against Japan 1943‚Äì1945, pp. 174‚Äì175. The assault was made from three cargo-carrying LVTs. To save wear and tear, they were towed across Seeadler Harbour by LCMs and cut loose for the final run in to shore.Casey, Amphibian Engineer Operations, pp. 240‚Äì241. The cavalrymen found well constructed and sited bunkers with interlocking fields of fire covering all approaches, and deadly accurate snipers. The next morning an LCM brought over a medium tank, for which the Japanese had no answer, and the cavalrymen were able to overcome the defenders at a cost of eight killed and 46 wounded; 43 dead Japanese naval personnel were counted. The 8th Cavalry Regiment began the main assault on Manus on 15 March and attacked the important Lorengau Airfield on 17 March. After initially quickly overrunning the enemy positions, the cavalry resumed its advance, and occupied a ridge overlooking the airstrip without opposition. In the meantime, the 7th Cavalry had been landed at Lugos from the LST on its second trip and took over the defense of the area, freeing the 2nd Squadron, 8th Cavalry to join the attack on Lorengau. The first attempt to capture the airstrip was checked by an enemy bunker complex. A second attempt on 17 March, reinforced by the 1st Squadron, 7th Cavalry and tanks, made good progress. The advance then resumed, with Lorengau itself falling on 18 March. Although there had been plenty of fighting, the main Japanese force on Manus had not been located. Advancing inland towards Rossum, the 7th Cavalry found it on 20 March. Six days of fighting around Rossum were required before the 7th and 8th Cavalry reduced the entrenched Japanese positions there. The Japanese bunkers, actually log and earth pillboxes, proved resistant to artillery fire.Frierson, The Admiralties: Operations of the 1st Cavalry Division, pp. 103‚Äì116. These weary Troopers were relieved by the 7th Cavalry on 18 March. That day, the 7th Cavalry attacked, and drove the enemy out of Lorengau Village. The Admiralty Islands campaign ended on 18 May 1944 with the islands and airfields secured and 3,317 Japanese dead. The 7th Cavalry Regiment suffered 43 killed in action, 17 wounded, and 7 dead from non-battle injuries. Having faced down suicidal Japanese counterattacks and a stubborn defense in the rainy jungles of the Southwest Pacific, the 7th Cavalry Troopers were now veterans. =Battle of Leyte= Troop E, 7th Cavalry Regiment, advances towards San Jose on Leyte, 20 October 1944 After a period of 5 months in rehabilitation and extensive combat training, the 7th Cavalry Regiment received instructions on 25 September 1944 to prepare for future combat operations. On 20 October, the regiment began the assault of Leyte Island. US 1st Cavalry troops wade through a swamp in Leyte The Battle of Leyte began when the first waves of the 7th Cavalry Regiment stormed ashore at White Beach at 1000, H-Hour, and were met with small arms and machine gun fire. 1st Squadron-7th Cavalry Regiment (1-7 Cavalry) landed on the right flank and was to attack north into the Cataisan Peninsula to capture Tacloban Aerodrome. To the left, 2-7 Cavalry was to attack inland, capture San Jose, and seize a beachhead line west of Highway 1. They were met with slight opposition, and within the first 15 minutes, 2-7 Cavalry knocked out two Japanese defensive pillboxes firing into the landing zone. After a house-to- house assault, San Jose was captured by 1230. 2-7 Cavalry's largest obstacle was the terrain. \\"Directly beyond the landing beaches the troops ran into a man-enveloping swamp. All along the line, men cursed as they wallowed toward their objective in mud of arm-pit depth. This unexpectedly tough obstacle however, failed to deter their dogged advance.\\" By 1545 2-7 Cavalry had crossed Highway No 1. Meanwhile, 1-7 Cavalry, under the command of Major Leonard Smith, had secured the Cataisan Peninsula and the Tacloban Airfield with the aid of the 44th Tank Battalion. All the 7th Cavalry's A-Day objectives had been seized before nightfall. The following day, 21 October 1944, saw 7th Cavalry begin the attack on Tacloban. At 0800, the 1st and 2nd Squadrons advanced abreast toward the city. 1-7 Cavalry entered the city and were overwhelmed by crowds of exuberant Filipinos giving them gifts of eggs and fruit. 2-7 Cavalry, meanwhile, was halted by a force of 200 Japanese entrenched in prepared fighting positions. The Regimental Weapons Troop and Anti-Tank Platoon arrived to break the stalemate but were quickly pinned down by machine gun fire from a bunker as well. PFC Kenneth W. Grove, an ammunition carrier, singlehandedly cut through the jungle, charged the bunker and killed the weapons crew, and allowed the advance to resume. By the end of 22 October the capital of Leyte and its hill defenses were securely in American hands. The 7th Cavalry was one day ahead of schedule, a fact partly explained by the unexpectedly light resistance of the Japanese and partly by the vigor of the 7th Cavalry's advance On 23 October, the 7th was relieved by the 8th Cavalry and prepared to undertake operations to secure the San Juanico Strait across from the island of Samar. On 24, 1 October- 7 Cavalry landed at Babatngon at 1330 and sent out patrols to secure the beachhead. The landing was unopposed, and 1-7 Cavalry made several other over-water movements to secure the area, making the most of the scant Japanese resistance. By 27, 7 October Cavalry (minus 1st Squadron) was in reserve. 1-7 Cavalry, in Babatngon, was ordered to secure the Barugo and Carigara area. Troop C, under 1LT Tower W. Greenbowe, advanced on 28 October without incident, but received fire from Carigara. In the ensuing firefight, C Troop eliminated 75 enemies at the cost of 3 killed, 9 wounded, and 1 missing (the mutilated body of the missing man was found later) before withdrawing to Barugo, where it was joined by the rest of the Squadron on the 29th for an assault on Carigara. On 2, 1 November- 7 Cavalry attacked across the Canomontag River by using 2 native canoes, and occupied Carigara by 1200 with no resistance. After remaining in a reserve role, 2-7 Cavalry relieved elements of the 12th Cavalry operating in the central mountain range of the island. Between 11 and 14 December, they continually assaulted a series of well-defended ridges and hills and only were able to wrest control over them by calling in over 5,000 rounds of artillery support. The 1st Cavalry Division continued to push west toward the coast through the mountainous and dense jungle interior of the island. On the morning of 23 December 1944, 1st Squadron-7th Cavalry assault units pushed across Highway 2 and set up night positions on line with the other divisional units. They pushed off for the attack the next morning meeting only scattered resistance. By 29, 7 December Cavalry units reached the west coast, north of the village of Tibur, and drove north, capturing the town of Villaba, and killing 35 Japanese there. On 31 December, the Japanese launched four counterattacks on the 7th Cavalry, each starting with a bugle call. The first occurred at 0230 and the last one was at dawn. An estimated 500 enemy attacked the positions, but they were driven off by the stalwart defenders and by American artillery superiority. 77th Infantry Division elements began relieving the 7th Cavalry later that day. Leyte was soon declared secure, despite the large number of Japanese soldiers remaining hidden in the thick jungle of the island's interior, and elements of the 7th Cavalry were kept busy by conducting mop-up missions and patrols until their next big operation. =Battle of Luzon= For the forces of General MacArthur's Southwest Pacific Area the reconquest of Luzon and the Southern Philippines was the climax of the Pacific war. Viewed from the aspect of commitment of U.S. Army ground forces, the Luzon Campaign (including the seizure of Mindoro and the central Visayan Islands) was exceeded in size during World War II only by the drive across northern France. The Luzon Campaign differed from others of the Pacific war in that it alone provided opportunity for the employment of mass and maneuver on a scale even approaching that common to the European and Mediterranean theaters.https://play.google.com/store/books/details/Robert_Ross_Smith_United_States_Army_in_WWII_the_P?id=GYNvCwAAQBAJ The initial Army units in the invasion had landed on 9 January and secured a beachhead, but GEN MacArthur needed more forces on the island to begin his drive to Manila. Despite not receiving adequate rest and replacements from the Battle of Leyte, the 1st Cavalry Division was sent ahead to take part in the Battle of Luzon and landed in Lingayen Gulf on 27 January 1945. The 7th Cavalry quickly moved inland toward Guimba, but as A Troop passed through Labit, they were attacked by a Japanese ambush unit. Technical Sergeant John B. Duncan, of Los Angeles, CA, was cited for his courageous and determined effort to drive the attackers back. He succeeded in doing so, but was mortally wounded. GEN MacArthur ordered that the 1st Cavalry Division assemble three \\"Flying Columns\\" for the drive on Manila. The 7th Cavalry was tasked with providing security for them. As elements of the 8th Cavalry swung south, the 7th Cavalry advanced by foot and kept the Japanese occupied while their counterparts broke through. On 4 February 1945, LTC Boyd L. Branson, the Regimental operation officer from San Mateo, CA, earned the Silver Star by voluntarily leading the advance units over more than 40 miles of un- reconnoitered, enemy-held terrain. While the rest of the Division was fighting in Manila, the 7th Cavalry engaged the enemy near the Novaliches watershed east of the city to prevent their reinforcement. On 20 February, they handed over their positions to elements of the 6th Infantry Division and moved south to begin the attack on the Shimbu Line. Attacking eastward on the 20th, 2-7 Cavalry spearheaded deep into the Japanese line but were quickly fired upon by a heavy barrage of artillery. Drawing on their experiences from the Admiralties and Leyte for attacking entrenched enemy positions in mountainous jungle terrain, the Troopers advanced and destroyed the pillboxes and mortar positions. By 25 February, the 7th Cavalry was 2 kilometers from their objective at Antipolo. The advance continued, and on 4 March, the 7th Cavalry was hit by a strong Japanese counterattack that managed to destroy two of the American's supporting tanks before it was defeated. The battle for Antipolo was marked by bitter struggle in unforgiving terrain, and the 1st Cavalry Division was relieved by the 43rd Infantry Division on 12 March after finally capturing the ruined village. Out of the 92 Silver Stars awarded to men of the 1st Cavalry Division in their drive to Antipolo, the largest share went to men of the 7th Cavalry Regiment, with 41 being awarded. PFC Calvin T. Lewis, of Glasgow, KY, B Troop 7th Cavalry, was posthumously awarded the Distinguished Service Cross for heroism in defeating an enemy bunker. After his platoon was halted by accurate machine gun fire from a concealed bunker, he volunteered to go find it. Wielding a Browning Automatic Rifle, he located the position and poured heavy and accurate fire through the bunker's opening. After pinning the enemy down, he moved up and fired into the opening from close range, but was mortally wounded in doing so. Despite his wounds he continued to engage the enemy until all were killed. After being relieved in their sector on 20 April, the 7th Cavalry prepared for another mission; the capture of Infanta to the south. On 6 May 1945 the 7th Cavalry began moving south into the Santa Maria Valley toward Lamon Bay along Route 455. Along the hairpin curves of the highway, they encountered tough Japanese resistance at the Kapatalin Sawmill. For several days the advance was stalled as patrols reconnoitered the position and pinpointed targets for US Army Air Corps planes. They overran the enemy by mid-afternoon of ‚çå291‚çç. They had killed 350 Japanese for the loss of 4 KIA and 17 WIA. They reached Lamon Bay on ‚çå292‚çç. Sweeping aside Japanese resistance on their march to the coast, the 7th Cavalry Troopers occasionally encountered determined defenders, and the fighting along the advance was characterized by small unit action. On ‚çå293‚çç, A Troop was moving to Real when the lead platoon was pinned down by enemy rifle and machine gun fire. Thinking quickly, Lieutenant Joe D. Crane of Athens, TX led his platoon in a flanking maneuver and annihilated the enemy force, saving his comrades. Near Gumian on ‚çå294‚çç, D Troop was attacked by a large force of 150 Japanese with machine guns, mortars, grenades, and rifles. The foliage was thick enough to conceal the enemy, allowing them to come within ten yards of the Cavalrymen's positions before being detected. LT Charles E. Paul of Camden, AR moved to an observation post in the thick of the fighting and called in close and accurate mortar fire, driving the enemy away, and earning the Silver Star for his actions. Accompanied by Philippines guerrillas, the 7th Cavalry captured Infanta on ‚çå295‚çç and soon after secured the surrounding rice-fields. They remained here for some time patrolling the area for Japanese holdouts. By 1 June 1945, most of southern Luzon was in American hands, but there were still determined Japanese forces in the area. On 2, 30 June Japanese attacked F Troop's positions just before dawn broke and the Americans were forced to fight in hand-to-hand combat. SGT Jessie Riddell of Irvine, KY earned his second Silver Star in this attack when he saw one of his Troopers in a death struggle with a Japanese officer wielding a samurai sword. SGT Riddell ran to his aid, shooting 3 attackers on the way, and killed the enemy officer before he could kill the American. Continuing their patrolling of southern Luzon, a patrol from B Troop ran into an unexpectedly heavy ambush on 19 June 1945. Despite the shock of the ambush, PVT Bernis L. Stringer of Visalia, CA, the patrol's BAR-man, ran forward, killing one Japanese and wounding another. He then reloaded in plain sight of the last enemy soldier before dispatching him too. PVT Stringer lost his life soon after in the closing days of the campaign. The Battle of Luzon was officially declared over on 30 June 1945 but scattered Japanese resistance remained. The battle was the longest the 7th Cavalry had fought in World War II, and it would be their last. After pulling out of the combat zone on 4 July, The regiment began to rest and refit as it prepared for the inevitable invasion of the main Japanese islands. On 20 July, the 7th Cavalry again reorganized‚Äîthis time entirely under Infantry Tables of Organization & Equipment, but still designated as a Cavalry Regiment, in order to bring it up to the full strength of a 1945 Army infantry regiment. Thankfully for the men of the 7th Cavalry, the invasion was terminated after the atomic bombings of Hiroshima and Nagasaki forced the Japanese to surrender. 7th Cavalry Regiment was at Lucena, Tayabas (now. Quezon) in the Philippines until 2 September 1945, when it was moved to Japan to start occupation duty. Occupation of Japan On 13 August 1945, the 7th Cavalry was alerted that it would accompany General Douglas MacArthur to Tokyo and would be part of the Eighth Army's occupation force. On 2 September, the 7th Cavalry landed in Yokohama and began setting up a base of operation. On 8 September, the 1st Cavalry Division sent a convoy under Major General William C. Chase from Hara-Machida to Tokyo to occupy the city. This convoy was made up of one combat veteran from every Troop in the division, and it marched through Hachi≈çji, Fuch≈´, and Ch≈çfu before reaching Tokyo; this convoy of the 1st Cavalry Division, with many veterans of the 7th Cavalry Regiment in the ranks, became the first Allied unit to enter the city. The 7th Cavalry set its headquarters at the Japanese Imperial Merchant Marine Academy and were assigned to guard the US embassy and GEN MacArthur's residence. For five years they remained in Tokyo. On 25 March 1949, the 7th Cavalry was reorganized under a new table of organization, and its Troops were renamed Companies as in a standard infantry division. Korean War When World War II ended, the communist Soviet Union and the countries of the Soviet bloc and the United States and its allies became locked in an ideological Cold War. They vied for power across the world using proxy states, but this tension boiled over in the Korean Peninsula. On 25 June 1950, the communist Democratic People's Republic of Korea crossed the 38th parallel and invaded the democratic Republic of Korea. Their military overwhelmed that of their southern neighbors and North Korean tanks were in Seoul within two days. The United States decided to intervene in favor of South Korea and quickly sent in troops with the promise that more were en route. On 18 July 1950, the 1st Cavalry Division‚Äôs 5th and 8th Cavalry Regiments landed at Pohang-dong, 80 miles north of Pusan, in the war's first amphibious landing. The 7th Cavalry landed at Pohang-dong on July 22. The 7th Cavalry, under the command of Colonel Cecil W. Nist, was the 8th Army reserve at Pohang, but when the 5th Cavalry to the north was attacked in great force, the 7th moved up to reinforce them on 25 July. Between 26 and 29 July, 7th Cavalry troopers were dug in astride the main highway 100 miles southeast of Seoul, but were unprepared for the waves of refugees fleeing south. Commanders feared the refugee columns might harbor North Korean infiltrators, and orders came down to stop refugee movements, with gunfire if necessary. The troopers and officers of 2-7 Cavalry opened fire on innocent civilians, mostly women and children, in the No Gun Ri massacre. In 2005, a South Korean government inquest committee certified the names of 150 No Gun Ri dead, 13 missing, and 55 wounded, including some who later died of their wounds. It said reports were not filed on many other victims. Survivors claim the number of dead was closer to 400. A .50 Cal. Machine gun squad of Co. E, 2nd Battalion, 7th Regiment, 1st Cavalry Division, fires on North Koreans along the north bank of the Naktong River, 26 August 1950. During the next few days a defensive line was formed at Hwanggan with the 7th Cavalry moving east and the 5th Cavalry replacing elements of the 25th Infantry Division. On 1 August, the 1st Cavalry Division was ordered to set up a defensive position near Kumchon on the rail route from Taegu to Pusan. For more than 50 days between late July and mid September 1950, 7th Cavalry Troopers and UN Soldiers performed the bloody task of holding on the vital Pusan Perimeter. At dawn on 9 August, North Korea hurled five divisions against the American lines along the Naktong River near Taegu and managed to gain some high ground. Major General Hobart R. Gay, commander of the 1st Cavalry Division, withheld counterattacking until he had more information, but soon learned that 750 Korean People's Army (KPA) troops had occupied Hill 268, soon to be known as \\"Triangulation Hill. At about 09:30, General Gay ordered 1-7 Cavalry to counter the KPA penetration. The Battalion moved from its bivouac area just outside Taegu, accompanied by five tanks of A Company, 71st Heavy Tank Battalion. This motorized force proceeded to the foot of Hill 268. Meanwhile, the 61st Field Artillery Battalion shelled the hill heavily.http://www.first- team.us/tableaux/chapt_04/\\"However, 1st Battalion-7th Cavalry Regiment counterattacked their flanks at 0930 that day, and managed to seize Hill 268, \\"Trianglation Hill,\\" and killed 400 enemy. The morning of 10 August, a combined tank and infantry attack next reached the crest of the Triangulation Hill without much trouble, and this battle was over by about 16:00. US artillery and mortar fire was now shifted westward, and this cut off the KPA retreat. White phosphorus shells fired from the 61st Field Artillery Battalion caught KPA troops in a village while they attempted to retreat, and they were then routed by US infantry, suffering over 200 killed. That evening the 1-7 Cavalry, returned to the serve as the division reserve, and elements of the 5th Cavalry finished securing Hill 268. On 26 August 1950, to replenish losses suffered in battle and to build the 7th Cavalry up to its authorized strength, 2nd Battalion-30th Infantry Regiment, from the 3rd Infantry Division, was attached to the 1st Cavalry Division and was redesignated as the 3rd Battalion-7th Cavalry Regiment. By 5 September, enemy pressure along the sector of the 1st Cavalry Division had increased tremendously. General Gay ordered a general withdrawal of the 1st Cavalry Division in order to shorten lines and occupy better defensive positions. The withdrawal movement began on the right with the 8th Cavalry, then the 7th Cavalry in the Hill 518 area and finally the 5th Cavalry in vicinity of Waegwan. The key to the withdrawal was Hill 464, behind the 2nd Battalion-7th Cavalry, that dominated the Waegwan - Tabu-dong road. The withdrawal was slowed by mud created by heavy rains which fell 5‚Äì6 September, hampering the movement of wheeled and tracked vehicles. On 6 September, at 0300 hours, 2-7 Cavalry disengaged from the enemy on Hill 464 and fought its way to the east. The 5th Cavalry, occupying positions on Hill 303, came under heavy fire and was driven from key terrain, however, they were able to recapture the lost ground with the aid of elements of the 70th Tank Battalion attached to the 1st Cavalry Division. During the next few days, the situation was precarious. The North Koreans had gained large footholds east of Naktong and south to within about 8 miles of Taegu in the vicinity of Hills 314 and 570. On 12 September, the 3rd Battalion-7th Cavalry was tasked to retake Hill 314. After a fierce struggle, the hill was taken. The North Korean drive halted on 13 September, seven miles short of Taegu. Their momentum began to slow and plans were laid for an all-out offensive. The turning point in this bloody battle came on 15 September 1950, when GEN MacArthur unleashed his plan to go around the advancing North Korean Army; Operation Chromite ‚Äì an amphibious landing at Incheon, far behind the North Korean lines. In spite of the many negative operational reasons given by critics of the plan, the Inchon landing was an immediate success allowing the 1st Cavalry Division to break out of the Pusan Perimeter and start fighting north. Task Force Lynch was formed to execute a rapid breakthrough to link up with the Inchon landing forces; it was composed of the 3rd Battalion-7th Cavalry, B Co 8th Engineer Battalion, C Co and the I&R; Platoon of 70th Tank Battalion, 77th Field Artillery Battalion (-), 3rd Platoon Heavy Mortar Company, and a tactical air support liaison team. On 22 September, TF Lynch attacked north, breaking out of the Pusan Perimeter and fighting across 106 miles of enemy territory. On 27 September, north of Osan, at a small bridge, L Co, 3-7 Cavalry, linked up with H Co, 31st Infantry, 7th Infantry Division of the landing force. On 28 September, K Co, 3-7 Cavalry, along with C Co 70th Tank Battalion and with the strong assistance of fighter-bombers, destroyed at least seven of ten North Korean T-34's in the Pyongtaek area, five by air strikes. After linking up with the rest of the 1st Cavalry Division by 4, 7 October Cavalry continued its advance north, securing Kaesong by the 8th, and crossing the 38th parallel on 9 October 1950. The 7th Cavalry rounded up 2,000 prisoners. In one of the ironic moments of the war, Troopers took into custody a small North Korean cavalry unit and all its horses. The Troopers of the 1st Cavalry crashed into Pyongyang, capturing the capital city of North Korea on 19 October 1950. In late October 1950, the 7th Cavalry moved north again. The North Korean Army was shattered and the UN Troops were nearing the Chinese border; the war seemed to be all but over. On 25 October, Communist China intervened on behalf of North Korea and began pushing UN Troops back. On 24 November, the 7th Cavalry was involved in a grand UN counterattack, but Chinese attacks shattered the ROK Army II Corps on the 1st Cavalry Division's flank, leaving it exposed. On 26 November, the Chinese penetrated the front companies of the 1st and 2nd Battalions, 7th Cavalry and tried to exploit the gap. At 0200 hours they were hit by elements of the 3rd Battalion reinforced by tanks. Red troops were stopped and retreated back into an area previously registered for artillery fire. Enemy losses were high and the shoulder was held. On 29 November, the Chinese attacked the 7th Cavalry again, and the Americans were forced to fall back to Sinchang-ni. At midnight, the Chinese attacked again. They were repulsed, but small infiltration teams managed to attack a Battalion command post before being driven off. At the Battle of Sinchang-ni, 7th Cavalry suffered 39 KIA, 107 WIA, and 11 MIA. Enormous Chinese numbers, the surprise of their attack, and the bitter cold of the North Korean winter forced UN troops to fall back. During the withdrawal, the Greek Army's Sparta Battalion under Lieutenant Colonel Georgios Koumanakos was attached to the 7th Cavalry Regiment and became 4th Battalion (GEF)-7th Cavalry on 16 December 1950. The Greeks soon proved themselves to be gallant soldiers in battle. By 28 December 1950, 7th Cavalry Troopers were in defensive positions near Uijeongbu. The year of 1951 would begin as a cold and dark time for the men of the 7th Cavalry. They had been pushed back into South Korea by the Chinese after having seemingly all but defeated North Korean Communist forces, but the fight wasn't over yet. On 22 January 1951, 7th Cavalry began an attack on Chinese lines near Kyong-ni. Here, the Greek Battalion on Hill 381 was counterattacked by a large enemy force. The battle began before dawn and raged on for the rest of the day. By afternoon, the Chinese had enough and retreated leaving 800 dead. The regiment continued its slow drive north. By 12 February, the 7th Cavalry ran into effective enemy defensive positions. On 14 February, heavy fighting erupted around an objective known as Hill 578, which was finally taken by the 7th Cavalry after overcoming stiff Chinese resistance. During this action General MacArthur paid a welcome visit to the First Team. By 22 April 1951, 1st Cavalry Division approached the Hwachon Reservoir on \\"Phase Line Kansas.\\" The 7th Cavalry was ordered to capture the dam which would eliminate the possibility of the enemy destroying it and flooding the area. The approaches to the dam severely restricted vehicular movement and the artillery could not be brought into range to support an attack. In an alternate approach, the 4th Ranger Company, attached to the 7th Cavalry, was to cross the reservoir by boat and attack from the east as the 2nd Battalion, 7th Cavalry attacked from the southwest. The Troopers made three separate assaults on the defenders, but none was successful in evicting them. Before another attempt could be organized, the troopers were pulled out for another fight. From 9 June to 27 November, the 7th Cavalry took on various roles in the summer-fall campaign of the United Nations. On 18 July, a year after it had entered the war, the 1st Cavalry Division was assigned to a reserve status. This type of duty did not last for long. On the nights of 21 and 23 September, the 2nd and 3rd Battalions, 7th Cavalry repulsed waves of Red Chinese involving hand-to-hand fighting. Earlier in the war, the Chinese attacks, which were accompanied by a cacophony of bells, bugles, whistles, and war cries, terrified the Americans; but after stopping the Chinese counterattack, 7th Cavalry Troopers lost their fear and stood their ground against the sometimes relentless and self-sacrificial enemy. Harder fighting soon followed when Operation Commando, a mission to push the Chinese out of their winter defense positions south of the Yokkok River, was launched. During this operation, the objective was designated as the Jamestown Line. On 3 October 1951, the 5th and 7th Cavalry attacked abreast along the division front at 0600 hours. Attacking with the Greek, 2nd and 3rd Battalions abreast, they stormed Hills 313 and 418 along the ridge. Both the Greek and 2nd Battalion fought their way to the ridge line, but suffering heavy casualties, neither could hold the ground. Despite heavy fighting on 4 October, there was little forward progress. Elements of the 8th Cavalry reinforced the 7th Cavalry on the right and assaulted the ridges west of Hill 418, but the enemy clung stubbornly to its positions. During the day, elements of the Chinese 140th Division moved up to reinforce their 139th Division which had been hit hard by the constant attacks of the 1st Cavalry Division. On 5 October, it was discovered that the Chinese had withdrawn much of their force in the night and 2-7 Cavalry occupied Hills 418 and 313 without opposition. The following day, at Hill 287, 1-7 Cavalry, fought its way to the crest and held on to part of the hill at nightfall. Enemy prisoners taken indicated that the many of the Chinese units were defeated in the opening days of the operation and were falling back to prepared defensive lines to the northwest. On 7 October, the 7th Cavalry effected the seizure of Hill 287 and sent the 3rd Battalion forward two miles southwest to take Hill 347. Attacking from the south, 3-7 Cavalry cleared the hill at the end of the day. The fall of Hill 347 meant that the 1st Cavalry Division now controlled the high ground overlooking the Jamestown Line. The 7th Cavalry Troopers did not know it, but the battle for Line Jamestown would be their last major combat of the Korean War. On 18 December 1951, the 7th Cavalry left for Hokkaido, Japan after 549 days of continuous fighting. On 12 December 1952, 7th Cavalry returned to Korea, relieving the 8th Cavalry, and held reserve defensive positions as forward UN troops continued skirmishing with Communist forces as the peace talks occurred. 7th Cavalry returned to Hokkaido on 20 February 1953, and the Korean War finally \\"ended\\" when the long-awaited armistice was signed at 10:00 on 27 July 1953. While still technically at war, UN and Communist forces ceased all combat operations. The war had been tough; the 7th Cavalry Regiment suffered defeats early in the 1950, but rebounded and took the fight to the northern end of North Korea, where they suffered an agonizing reverse at the hand of the Chinese in the harsh winter. Despite this, they managed to hold their lines and counterattack, learning from their early mistakes and serving with valor and skill. Cold War and Vietnam The regiment was relieved from its assignment to the 1st Cavalry Division on 15 October 1957, and reorganized under the Combat Arms Regimental System (CARS) on 1 November 1957. HQ & HQ Company transferred to the control of the Department of the Army. 1 November, As part of this reorganization, Company \\"A\\" was redesignated 1st Battle Group, 7th Cavalry and assigned to the 1st Cavalry Division. Company \\"B\\" was redesignated 2nd Reconnaissance Squadron, 7th Cavalry and Company \\"C\\" was redesignated 3rd Reconnaissance Squadron, 7th Cavalry and assigned to the 10th Infantry Division. After the Korean War, 7th Cavalry was used mainly in a reconnaissance role. It received the M14 rifle, along with various other new weapons and equipment (including the Patton tank). Also, a few OH-13 helicopters were used by the reconnaissance squadrons. Three battalions, the 1st, 2nd and 5th, served during the Vietnam War as the 3rd Brigade of the 1st Cavalry Division. 3rd Brigade often referred to itself as the \\"Garryowen Brigade\\". These troopers were armed with the new M16 rifle, M1911A1 Pistols and the M79 grenade launcher. The use of Bell UH-1 Iroquois \\"Huey\\" helicopters transformed the 1st Cavalry into an \\"Air-mobile\\" unit. Seven men earned the Medal of Honor while serving with the 7th Cavalry in Vietnam: Private First Class Lewis Albanese, Company B, 5th Battalion; First Lieutenant Douglas B. Fournet, Company B, 1st Battalion; Sergeant John Noble Holcomb, Company D, 2nd Battalion; Second Lieutenant Walter Joseph Marm, Jr., Company A, 1st Battalion; Private First Class William D. Port, Company C, 5th Battalion; Specialist Four H√©ctor Santiago-Col√≥n, Company B, 5th Battalion; and First Lieutenant James M. Sprayberry, Company D, 5th Battalion. The other two units, the 3rd and 4th reconnaissance Squadrons, were based in Germany, and South Korea. The 1st, 2nd, and 5th Battalions were deactivated after the Vietnam War, and only the 3rd and 4th Squadrons remained as divisional reconnaissance squadrons assigned to the 3rd Infantry Division and 2nd Infantry Division respectively. Both the 3rd and 4th squadrons were aviation-tank cavalry squadrons using the M48 Patton tank, M113A1 Armored Personnel Carrier and M114A1E1 armored reconnaissance vehicle. Both squadrons had an air cavalry \\"Delta\\" Troop, that had both reconnaissance & gunship UH-1B's. The gunships were armed with M-5 rocket launchers, and M-22 anti-tank guided missiles. In 1963, the 3rd Squadron became the divisional cavalry squadron for the 3rd Infantry Division and was stationed at Ledward & Conn Barracks, Schweinfurt, West Germany. The squadron consisted of three ground troops and a Headquarters Troop at Ledward Barracks and an aviation troop at Conn Barracks in Schweinfurt. The ground troops were equipped with M60A3 tanks, M113A1 armored personnel carriers, ITV (Improved TOW Vehicle, an M113 variant) and a mortar section with the M106A1, an M113 variant with a 4.2 in mortar. In 1971 the M60 A3's were exchanged for the new M551 AR/AAV Sheridan Fighting Vehicles. At the same time the new Squadron Commander became LTC \\"Smokey Joe\\" Ameel, the former Program Manager of the M551 AR/AAV development program. In 1974 a \\"3 for 5\\" program was instituted in which the five M114A1E1 reconnaissance vehicles in each of the three ground troops was exchanged for three more M551 AR/AAV tanks. In 1984 the M551's were replaced with M3 Bradley Cavalry Fighting Vehicle (CFV). The reorganization created two M3-equipped ground troops, one long range surveillance (LRSU) ground troop and two aviation troops equipped with OH-58 scout helicopters and AH-1 Cobra attack helicopters. On 16 November 1992, the squadron was inactivated in Germany and relieved of assignment to the 8th Infantry Division. The Headquarters and Headquarters Troop consolidated on 16 December 1992 with the 3rd Reconnaissance Company and designated as Headquarters and Headquarters Troop, 3rd Squadron, 7th Cavalry. On 16 February 1996, the squadron was assigned to the 3rd Infantry Division and activated at Fort Stewart, Georgia as the Division Cavalry Squadron. The squadron has been involved in several deployments since then, including Operation Desert Storm in Kuwait, Operation Joint Forge in Bosnia, and Operation Iraqi Freedom. The squadron was reassigned to the 2nd Brigade Combat Team of the 3rd Infantry Division in 2004 as the brigade's Armored Reconnaissance Squadron. Combat operations for Operation Iraqi Freedom III began on 4 February 2005 when the squadron arrived at Forward Operating Base Rustamiyah located in southeast Baghdad. Immediately on arrival, the squadron began patrolling the area east of the Tigris River in the Rusafa and New Baghdad districts as well as securing Route Pluto North, one of the primary supply routes for the division. Between 1974 and 1975, other units were reactivated. The 1st Battalion became an armored unit, the 2nd Battalion remained an air mobile unit with a recon platoon using motorcycles moved by helicopters. After 1975, the 2nd and 5th Battalion were reorganized as mechanized infantry. In 1978, the 5th Battalion was once again deactivated. Operation Desert Storm The 1st and 4th Squadrons fought in Operation Desert StormAR 600-8-27 p. 26 paragraph 9-14 & p. 28 paragraph 2-14 in January/February 1991. Ground troops were armed with the M3A1 Bradley CFV. Air cavalry troops AH-1F Cobras, OH-58C scouts. The 1st Squadron, under the command of Lieutenant Colonel Walter L. Sharp, was the divisional cavalry squadron for the 1st Cavalry Division and assigned to the division's aviation brigade. The squadron was organized as a headquarters troop, one ground troop (Troop A), and two air troops (Troops C and D). Prior to deployment, the squadron also attached two ground troops, Troop A, and Troop B, 2d Squadron, 1st Cavalry, from the inactivating 2d Armored Division, also at Fort Hood. After attachment, the additional troops were provisionally flagged as Troop B, and Troop E, 1st Squadron, 7th Cavalry. The squadron was in Southwest Asia from October 1990 until May 1991. During the campaign, 1-7 CAV overwatched the border area of Iraq, Saudi Arabia, and Kuwait did numerous recon missions into Iraq and led the 1st Cavalry Division during its attack into Iraq after being released as the CENTCOM theater reserve. After the war, Trp E/1-7 CAV remained in the squadron's task organization through its reorganization in 1993, exchanging its guidons with Trp C/1-7 CAV in 1994. The 4th Squadron, under the command of Lieutenant Colonel Terry L. Tucker, was the divisional cavalry squadron for 3rd Armored Division, taking part of the Battle of Phase Line Bullet. The squadron was inactivated in 1992 with the rest of the 3d Armored Division. In 1996, the squadron was reactivated as a subordinate element of Aviation Brigade, 2d Infantry Division at Camp Pelham, Korea (later renamed Camp Garryowen), using the equipment and personnel of the inactivating 5th Squadron, 17th Cavalry. In 2004, the squadron was reassigned as a subordinate element of the 1st Heavy Brigade Combat Team, 2d Infantry Division, Camp Hovey, Korea. Operation Iraqi Freedom The 3rd Squadron, 7th Cavalry was the spearhead and the screening force for the main elements of the U.S. 3rd Infantry Division during the Iraq War. The 3d Squadron launched an attack under the command of LTC Terry Ferrell on 20 March 2003. The 3rd Squadron was the \\"Eyes and Ears\\" for the U.S. 3rd Infantry Division (Mechanized) and the \\"Iron Fist\\" for the U.S. XVIII Airborne Corps. The Squadron was engaged with the enemy earlier and more often during the war than any other unit in modern warfare history. Combat operations for Operation Iraqi Freedom began on 20 March 2003, when the squadron crossed into Iraq as the lead element of the 3rd Infantry Division. The Squadron attacked towards Baghdad fighting both the Republican Guard and the Sadam Fedayeen. With the capture of Baghdad, the division and the squadron transitioned to stabilization operations. By the time the Squadron had redeployed, it had killed 2,200 Iraqi personnel, 64 tanks, 41 armored vehicles, numerous active air defense systems, as well as trucks and civilian vehicles used as suicide bombers. They were awarded the Presidential Unit Citation, the highest award given to a unit. The 3rd Squadron remains the only ‚Äúspearhead‚Äù element to complete a combat tour without suffering a casualty. The 1st Squadron, 7th Cavalry served in the 1st Cavalry Division's 5th Brigade Combat Team (BCT) during its first deployment in support of Operation Iraqi Freedom II from 1 April 2004 to 1 April 2005. The 1st Squadron, 7th Cavalry, commanded by LTC William R. Salter executed combat operations in the Al Rashid District of Baghdad, Iraq. The squadron defeated a surge of enemy attacks and neutralized insurgent and terrorist elements within its area of operations (AO) through a combination of constant day to day interaction with the populace and adaptable tactics. In addition to securing an AO of 68 km2 with a population of more than 1.2 million, the Squadron also secured Route Irish, a strategic highway and Multi-National Corps-Iraq (MNC-I) Main Supply Route connecting the International Zone (IZ) to the Baghdad International Airport (BIAP). The squadron also helped provide a secure environment during the first Iraqi democratic election in January 2005. 1st Squadron, 7th Cavalry Regiment was awarded the Meritorious Unit Citation for its actions during this campaign. Most recently, 1-7 CAV, commanded by LTC Kevin S. MacWatters, deployed as the Armed Reconnaissance Squadron for 1st Brigade, 1st Cavalry Division in support of Operation Iraqi Freedom 06-08 (6 October 2006 to 15 January 2008). The squadron conducted full-spectrum operations as a part of Multi-National Division-Baghdad (MND-B)in the Taji Area of Operations. During this deployment the squadron destroyed multiple improvised explosive device (IED) and vehicle borne improvised explosive devices (VBIED) terrorist cells as a part of the \\"Surge\\", enhancing MND-B's ability to secure Baghdad. The secure environment created by the squadron in the Taji area enabled local government to take hold, local police and Iraqi Army forces to take over security operations, and the \\"Reconciliation\\" to successfully spread throughout the Area of Operations. The 2nd Battalion, 7th Cavalry was attached to the 39th BCT although assigned to 3d BCT, 1st CAV. The unit deployed to Iraq under the command of LTC Charles Forshee seven months after arrival in Iraq and was succeeded by LTC James Eugene Rainey in August 2004, the 2nd Battalion supported US Marine Corps operations during the battle of Najaf (2004) and the Battle of Fallujah. A squad marksman scans for enemy snipers at the Nineveh ancient ruins in Mosul, Iraq, 4 April 2007 The 2nd Battalion moved from 3rd BCT, 1st Cavalry Division, Ft Hood Texas, to Ft Bliss to become part of the newly formed 4th BCT and in October 2006 The 2nd Battalion again headed for Iraq, this time to Mosul. 2-7 Cav consisting of only four infantry companies were tasked with eliminating AQI and patrolling Iraq's third largest city, dividing the sprawling urban area into quarters. Within the first several months the battalion took the first casualties of the 4th BCT. Since October 2006, C Co. 2-7 Cav. has endured 6 KIA and numerous wounded. 2nd Battalion redeployed in December 2007 to Fort Bliss, TX. In 2008, it deployed from Fort Hood, TX to Iraq in support of OIF 08‚Äì09. Maintaining control of the northern half of the Maysan province of Iraq, it operated out of FOB Garryowen. FOB Garryowen, located in Amarah, Iraq's border city with Iran, was established in June 2008 for the battalion by a team of 23 Air Force enlisted engineers. 08-09 B/2-7 CAV was relieved by the OIF 06-08 B 2-7 CAV (now 4-6 INF out of Ft.Bliss) who along with the Iraqi Police in Majar al Kabir captured the criminals responsible for murdering 6 British Military Police in November 2004. Among its other accomplishments, 2-7 CAV worked with the Iraqi Security Forces to provide successful security to Iraq's provincial elections in January 2009 and is responsible for several large volume cache finds. During its tour, the 10th Iraqi Army Division conducted Operation \\"Lion's Roar,\\" a combined live-fire exercise in Maysan province in April 2009. As part of the Army's modularity program, the 3rd Infantry Division converted the 1-3 Air Defense Artillery battalion to become 5th Squadron, 7th Cavalry Regiment, an armored reconnaissance squadron. The 5th Squadron deployed in 2005 and most recently in January 2007. Under the command of Lieutenant Colonel Cliff Wheeler, the squadron initially operated north of Ramadi, and remained under the operational control of the 1st Brigade Combat Team. In April 2007, the squadron conducted a full-scale movement to contact, clearing from Ramadi, to the south of Lake Habbaniyah, and then east to Route Iron in Fallujah, while attaching to the Marine Corps' 6th Regimental Combat Team and basing at Camp Baharia. Due to the firepower and mobility inherent within a cavalry squadron, 5-7 CAV was assigned the largest battlespace within RCT 6's area of operations. The squadron also suffered from the limitations in assigned troopers that also comes with the cavalry. For eight months, the squadron conducted security and COIN operations across the Warpaint AO. The squadron established and maintained freedom of movement along Routes Michigan, Iron, San Juan and Gold, and maintained a secure environment in the towns of Saqliwiyah, North Saqliwiyah, Amariyah, and Farris. Additional operations at both the troop and squadron level cleared and held new terrain within the regimental security zone. In December 2007, the squadron was attached to the operational control of the 3rd Infantry Division's 2nd Brigade Combat Team at FOB Kalsu. The squadron conducted relief-in-place with two USMC rifle battalions and redeployed to Kalsu in approximately eight days. An additional week of training and preparations were required before they attacked into Arab Jabour and cleared the town of Sayafiyah (30,000 residents) in conjunction with the Iraqi \\"Sons of Iraq\\" program. The squadron occupied an area that had seen no long-term coalition forces presence, and conducted operations in an austere environment. The squadron secured all routes with fixed positions while simultaneously building COP Meade, clearing all routes, terrain and structures within the new Warpaint AO. The squadron completed the mission in March 2008, and conducted a relief-in-place with 1-187 IN, the Rakkasans, before redeploying to Fort Stewart in April 2008. During OIF V, the squadron suffered six KIA and numerous wounded. During 20 months of subsequent dwell time, the squadron participated, as part of the 1st Heavy Brigade Combat Team, in the chemical, biological, radiological, nuclear, explosive consequence management reaction force (CCMRF) mission in support of the requirements of defense support to civil authority. This mission requires the unit, at the request of local, state or national civil authorities, to deploy within the United States in response to a catastrophic event. U.S. Army Spc. Mickie Lerma, with 5th Squadron, 7th Cavalry Regiment provides over watch security for his team during the first independent mission for the 2nd Mobile Strike Force, Afghan National Army. Operation Enduring Freedom In November 2012, 2nd Battalion, 7th Cavalry was deployed to Kapisa and Kabul provinces in RC- East, operating from FOBs Tagab and Naglu High, positions formerly held by the French Army. In January 2013, 5th Squadron, 7th Cavalry was deployed to Qalat District, Zabul province, Afghanistan Operating from FOB Apache.  Operation Atlantic Resolve  Soldiers assigned to 1st Squadron, 7th Cavalry Regiment and Mechanized Infantry Brigade \\"Iron Wolf\\" support A (Apache) Troop's live fire exercise in Pabrade, Lithuania 1st Squadron, 7th Cavalry Regiment deployed from Fort Hood, Texas to Europe as part of 1st Armored Brigade Combat Team, 1st Cavalry Division in support of Operation Atlantic Resolve from May 2018 to February 2019. 1st Squadron moved by sea, rail, and drove over 900 kilometers across Europe to establish their headquarters in ≈öwiƒôtosz√≥w, Poland. During their time in Poland, the Squadron partnered with their hosts, the Polish 10th Armored Cavalry Brigade. They maintained this partnership until the Squadron moved from ≈öwiƒôtosz√≥w, Poland to Hohenfels Training Area, Germany November 2018 in support of Combined Resolve XI. Capt. Samuel Taylor leads B (Blackhawk) Troop in the 2018 Polish Armed Forces Day Parade in Warsaw, Poland. A Bradley Fighting Vehicle fires its 25mm main gun as part of D (Diablo) Troop's live fire exercise in Slovakia. While the Squadron was headquartered in ≈öwiƒôtosz√≥w, Poland for a majority of the deployment, elements constantly deployed abroad across Europe in order to partner with various NATO Allies. A Troop, C Troop, and D Troop deployed to Pabradƒó, Lithuania; Tata and V√°rpalota, Hungary; and Lest, Slovakia, respectively. Each Troop, including B Troop who remained in ≈öwiƒôtosz√≥w, Poland, conducted joint combined arms live fire exercises with their partnered hosts. Live fire exercises were normally accompanied by \\"force-on-force\\" situational training exercises. In total, 1st Squadron partnered with 10th Armored Cavalry Brigade from Poland, Mechanized Infantry Brigade \\"Iron Wolf\\" from Lithuania, 5th and 25th Mechanized Infantry Brigades from the Hungarian Ground Forces, and 112th Mechanized Infantry Battalion from the Slovakian Ground Forces. The Squadron moved to Hohenfels Training Area, Germany in November 2018 in order to participate in Combined Resolve XI. The exercise included over 5500 participants from 16 different NATO allies and partners. A 10-day force-on-force exercise was held at Hohenfels Training Area where all 16 participants acted as either friendly or opposing forces (OPFOR). The Squadron relocated to Grafenwoehr Training Area in late December 2018, and participated in a Brigade live fire exercise from 13‚Äì25 January 2019. 1st Squadron conducted redeployment operations from February to April 2019.

It is the successor corporation to Colt's earlier firearms- making efforts, which started in 1836. Colt is known for the engineering, production, and marketing of firearms, most especially between the 1850s and World War I, when it was a dominating force in its industry and a seminal influence on manufacturing technology. Colt's earliest designs played a major role in the popularization of the revolver and the shift away from earlier single-shot pistols. Although Samuel Colt did not invent the revolver concept, his designs resulted in the first very successful ones. The most famous Colt products include the Colt Walker, made in 1847 in the facilities of Eli Whitney Jr., the Colt Single Action Army or Peacemaker, the Colt Python, and the Colt M1911 pistol, which is currently the longest-standing military and law enforcement service handgun in the world and is still used today. Though they did not develop it, for a long time Colt was also primarily responsible for all AR-15 and M16 rifle production, as well as many derivatives of those firearms. The most successful and famous of these are numerous M16 carbines, including the Colt Commando family, and the M4 carbine. In 2002, Colt Defense was split off from Colt's Manufacturing Company. Colt's Manufacturing Company served the civilian market, while Colt Defense served the law enforcement, military, and private security markets worldwide. The two companies remained in the same West Hartford, Connecticut location cross-licensing certain merchandise before reuniting in 2013. Following the loss of its M4 contract in 2013, the reunited Colt was briefly in Chapter 11 bankruptcy, starting in 2015 and emerging in January 2016. The company is currently owned by Cannae Holdings Inc. History =19th century= 1830s‚Äì1850s Colt Model of 1848 Holster Pistol (First Model Dragoon) Samuel Colt received a British patent on his improved design for a revolver in 1835,, p. 166. and two U.S. patents in 1836, one on February 25 (later numbered U.S. Patent 9430X) and another on August 29 (). That same year, he founded his first corporation for its manufacture, the Patent Arms Manufacturing Company of Paterson, New Jersey, Colt's Patent.. The first firearm manufactured at the new Paterson plant, however, was the Colt First Model Ring Lever rifle beginning in 1837. This was followed shortly thereafter in late 1837 by the introduction of the Colt Paterson. This corporation suffered quality problems in production. Making firearms with interchangeable parts was still rather new (it had reached commercial viability only about a decade before), and it was not yet easy to replicate across different factories. Interchangeability was not complete in the Paterson works, and traditional gunsmithing techniques did not fill the gap entirely there. The Colt Paterson revolver found patchy success and failure; some worked well, while others had problems. The United States Marine Corps and United States Army reported quality problems with these earliest Colt revolvers., pp. 166‚Äì169. Production had ended at the New Jersey corporation by 1842. Colt made another attempt at revolver production in 1846 and submitted a prototype to the US government. During the Mexican‚ÄìAmerican War (1846‚Äì1848), this prototype was seen by Captain Samuel Hamilton Walker who made some suggestions to Colt about making it in a larger caliber. Having no factory or machinery to produce the pistols, Samuel Colt collaborated with the Whitney armory of Whitneyville, Connecticut. This armory was run by the family of Eli Whitney. Eli Whitney Jr (born 1820), the son of the cotton-gin- developer patriarch, was the head of the family armory and a successful arms maker and innovator of the era. Colt used a combination of renting the Whitney firm's facilities and subcontracting parts to the firm to continue his pursuit of revolver manufacture. Colt's new revolvers found favor with Texan volunteers (the progenitors of later Texas Rangers cavalry groups), and they placed an order for 1,000 revolvers that became known as the Colt Walker, ensuring Colt's continuance in manufacturing revolvers. In 1848, Colt was able to start again with a new business of his own, and 1855, he converted it into a corporation under the name of Colt's Patent Fire Arms Manufacturing Company in Hartford, Connecticut. Colt's Armory from an 1857 engraving viewed from the East Colt purchased a large tract of land beside the Connecticut River, where he built his first factory in 1848, a larger factory called the Colt Armory in 1855, a manor that he called Armsmear in 1856, and employee tenement housing. He established a ten-hour day for employees, installed washing stations in the factory, mandated a one-hour lunch break, and built the Charter Oak Hall, a club where employees could enjoy games, newspapers, and discussion rooms. Colt ran his plant with a military-like discipline, he would fire workers for tardiness, sub-par work or even suggesting improvements to his designs. In an attempt to attract skilled German workers to his plant, Colt built a village near the factory away from the tenements which he named Coltsville and modeled the homes after a village near Potsdam. In an effort to stem the flooding from the river he planted German osiers, a type of willow tree in a 2-mile long dike. He subsequently built a factory to manufacture wicker furniture made from these trees. The 1850s were a decade of phenomenal success for the new Colt corporation. Colt was the first to widely commercialize the total use of interchangeable parts throughout a product. It was a leader in assembly line practice. It was a major innovator and training ground in manufacturing technology in this decade (and several after).. Soon after establishing his Hartford factory, Colt set out to establish a factory in Europe and chose London, England. He organized a large display of his firearms at the Great Exhibition of 1851 at Hyde Park, London and ingratiated himself by presenting cased engraved Colt revolvers to such appropriate officials as Britain's Master General of the Ordnance. At one exhibit Colt disassembled ten guns and reassembled ten guns using different parts from different guns. As the world's leading proponent of mass production techniques, Colt went on to deliver a lecture on the subject to the Institution of Civil Engineers in London.Houze (2006) p.83 The membership rewarded his efforts by awarding him the Telford Gold Medal. Colt's presence in the British market caused years of acrimony and lawsuits among British arms makers, who doubted the validity of Colt's British patent and the desirability of the American system of manufacturing. It took many more years and a UK government commission before the point became universally accepted that such manufacture was possible and economical.. Colt opened his London plant on the River Thames at Pimlico and began production on January 1, 1853. Many English people saw Colt's advanced steampowered machinery as proof of America's growing position as a leader in modern industrial production. On a tour of the factory, Charles Dickens was so impressed with the facilities that he recorded his favorable comments of Colt's revolvers in an 1854 edition of Household Words. Most significant, the Colt factory's machines mass-produced interchangeable parts that could be easily and cheaply put together on assembly lines using standardized patterns and gauges by unskilled labor as opposed to England's top gunmakers. In 1854 the British Admiralty ordered 4,000 Navy Model Colt revolvers. In 1855 the British Army placed an order for 5,000 of these revolvers for army issue. Despite a following order later in the year for an additional 9,000 revolvers, Colt failed to convince the British to adopt his revolver as the issue sidearm for the army. Colt began to realize that British sales were failing to meet his expectations. Unable to justify the London factory's expenses, Colt closed the London factory in 1856. Over the next few months his workmen crated and shipped the machinery and disassembled firearms back to America. Though the U.S. was not directly involved in the Crimean War (1854‚Äì1856), Colt's weapons were used by both sides. In 1855 Colt unveiled new state-of-the-art armories in the Hartford and London factories stocked with the latest machine tools (some of which were of Colt's devising), many built by Francis A. Pratt and Amos Whitney, who would found the original Pratt & Whitney toolbuilding firm a few years later. For example, the Lincoln miller debuted to industry at these armories. Colt had set up libraries and educational programs within the plants for his employees.Lendler (1997) p. 17 Colt's armories in Hartford were seminal training grounds for several generations of toolmakers and other machinists, who had great influence in other manufacturing efforts of the next half century. Prominent examples included F. Pratt and A. Whitney (as mentioned above); Henry Leland (who would end up at Cadillac and Lincoln); Edward Bullard Sr of the Bullard firm; and, through Pratt & Whitney, Worcester R. Warner and Ambrose Swasey (of Warner & Swasey). In 1852 an employee of Colt's, Rollin White, came up with the idea of having the revolver cylinder bored through to accept metallic cartridges. He took this idea to Colt who flatly rejected it and ended up firing White within a few years. Colt historian RL Wilson has described this as the major blunder of Sam Colt's professional life.Boorman (2004) p.36 Rollin White left Colt's in December 1854 and registered a patent on April 3, 1855 in Hartford, Connecticut, as patent number 12,648: Improvement in Repeating Fire-arms. On November 17, 1856 White signed an agreement with Smith & Wesson for the exclusive use of his patent. The contract stipulated that White would be paid 25 cents for every revolver, but that it was up to him to defend his patent against infringement as opposed to Smith & Wesson. During the 1850s and 1860s, Rollin White had been permanently trying to keep control on his breech-loading system patent, bringing a lawsuit to any breech-loaded manufactured gun. He nevertheless obtained an advance against royalties for using his patent from Smith & Wesson, a company that not only introduced its first revolver in 1857 (Smith & Wesson Model 1, a rear-loader) but also started, as of 1858, to convert cap & ball percussion guns into rear-loaders, even with formerly Colt manufactured revolvers.There is a very well known scene, for example, in the film The Good, the Bad and the Ugly where Blondie (played by Clint Eastwood) loads a breech- loading Colt 1851 Navy Revolver. The film is set in 1862, during the American Civil War, but this is not an anachronism since the Smith & Wesson metallic cartridge conversion of the Navy or other Colt revolvers did indeed exist all along the American Civil War. But the Colt's company itself was prevented by American laws from infringing the Rollin White patent and all along the 1850s and 1860s continued manufacturing percussion guns. In 1860 it produced a new revolver model for the United States Army.. This Colt Army Model 1860 appeared just in time for the American Civil War. 1860‚Äì1865: American Civil War Colt Navy (top) and Army Models from 1861 and 1860 The American Civil War was a boon to firearms manufacturers such as Colt's, and the company thrived during the conflict. Sam Colt had carefully developed contacts within the ordnance department, signing the very first government contract for 25,000 rifles. Colt's Factory was described as \\"an industrial palace topped by a blue dome\\", powered by a 250-horsepower steam engine.Kinard (2004) p.154 During the American Civil War, Colt had 1,500 employees who produced 150,000 muskets and pistols a year. In 1861 and 1863 the company sold 107,000 of the Colt Army Model 1860 alone, with production reaching 200,500 by the end of the war in 1865. During the war, Colt's was still prevented by the American laws from infringing Rollin White's patent. Nevertheless, the war made a huge fortune for the company, allowing Sam Colt to become America's first manufacturing tycoon, though he did not live to see the end of the war; he died of rheumatic fever on January 10, 1862. His close friend and firearms engineer, Elisha K. Root, took over as Colt's company president. On February 4, 1864 a fire destroyed most of the factory, including arms, machinery, plans, and factory records. On September 1, 1865, Root died, leaving the company in the hands of Samuel Colt's brother-in-law, Richard Jarvis. The company's Vice-president was William B. Franklin, who had recently left the Army at the end of the Civil War. With the Civil War over and having no new military contracts, Colt's Manufacturing was forced to lay off over 800 employees.Kinard (2004) p.124 The company found itself in a precarious situation. The original revolver patents had expired, allowing other companies to produce copies of his designs. Additionally, metallic cartridge revolvers were gaining in popularity, but Colt could not produce any because of the Rollin White patent held by rival Smith & Wesson. Likewise, Colt had been so protective of its own patents that other companies had been unable to make revolvers similar to their design. As the Rollin White patent neared expiration, Colt moved to develop its own metallic cartridge revolver. The New York Daily Tribune denounced Colt and his company by asserting, ‚Äúthe traitors have found sympathizers among us, men base enough to sell arms when they knew they would be‚Ä¶ in the hands of the deadly enemies of the Union‚Ä¶ Col. Colt‚Äôs manufactory can turn probably 1,000 a week and has been doing so for the past four months for the South.‚ÄùHosley, William N. Colt : The Making of an American Legend. Amherst: University of Massachusetts Press, 1996. 96. This article even chided the Federal Government for not taking action against Colt: ‚ÄúEvery man who makes arms should be watched, and if he will not work for a fair equivalent for the Government, his manufactory should be taken away from him.‚Äù Despite secession and growing tensions between the North and the South, ‚ÄúColt‚Äôs sales to Alabama, Virginia, Georgia, and Mississippi in 1860 alone were at least $61,000 (today‚Äôs equivalent of about 3.35 million).‚ÄùHosley, William N. Colt : The Making of an American Legend. Amherst: University of Massachusetts Press, 1996. 95. Until just days before the first shot at Fort Sumter, Colt received orders from various states, some participating in secession. In his memoir on Colt, written in 1866, Henry Barnard reported, ‚Äúbefore the rebellion broke out, Col. Colt, foreseeing that his weapons must ere long be in double demand, had made all preparations to extend his factory.‚ÄùBarnard, Henry. Armsmear: The Home, the Arm, and the Armory of Samuel Colt: A Memorial, New York: Alvord Printer, 1866. 213. 1865‚Äì1880s: Post‚ÄìCivil War Colt's first effort toward a metallic cartridge revolver was by conversion of existing percussion revolvers. The first of these conversions was patented on September 15, 1868 by Colt engineer, F. Alexander Thuer as patent number 82258. The Thuer conversion was made by milling off the rear of the receiver and replacing it with a breechplate containing six internal firing pins. The cartridges were loaded through the mouths of the chambers. Colt made 5000 of these but they were not well accepted. Colt found the mechanism so complex it included a spare percussion cylinder with each revolver. Colt tasked its superintendent of engineering, Charles Richards, to come up with a solution. The Richards conversion was performed on the Colt 1860 Army revolver. The caliber was .44 Colt and the loading lever was replaced by an ejector rod. This conversion added a breechplate with a firing pin and a rear sight mounted on the breechplate. Cartridges were loaded into the cylinder one at a time via a loading gate. Colt manufactured 9000 of these revolvers between 1873 and 1878. In 1873, Colt performed the same conversion on the M1851 and M1861 revolvers for the US Navy in .38 rimfire. Another of Colt's engineers, William Mason, improved this conversion by placing the rear sight on the hammer and, along with Richards, he was granted patents in 1871 to convert percussion revolvers into rear-loading metallic-cartridge revolvers. Those converted revolvers are identified as the \\"Richards-Mason conversion\\". There were approximately 2100 Richards-Mason M1860 Army conversions made from 1877 to 1878 in a serial- number range 5800 to 7900. In November 1865, Franklin had attempted to purchase a license to the Rollin White patent from competitor Smith & Wesson. White and Smith & Wesson would take no less than $1.1 million, but Franklin and Colt's directors decided it was too large an investment on a patent that would expire in 1868. In the meantime, Colt turned its attention to manufacturing goods other than firearms, such as watches, sewing machines, typewriters and bicycles.Houze (2006) p.6 In 1868 Rollin White requested an extension to his patent, but the request was rejected. He then turned to the Congress, but the request was again rejected, this time by the Senate and on the initiative of President Ulysses Grant, in January 1870. This led the patent to expire, allowing competitors to develop their own breech-loading guns and metallic cartridges. Following this, on that same year of 1870, Colt's bought the National Arms Company, a Brooklyn, New York company known for manufacturing derringers and for circumventing the Rollin White patent by utilizing a unique cartridge. Colt continued to produce the .41 Short derringer after the acquisition, as an effort to help break into the metallic- cartridge gun market, but also introduced its own three Colt Derringer Models, all of them also chambered in a .41 rimfire unique cartridge. The last model to be in production, the third Colt Derringer, was not dropped until 1912.The third Colt Derringer Model was re-released in the 1950s for western movies, under the name of fourth model Colt Deringer The first metallic cartridge breech-loading weapons sold by Colt's were those Derringers, in 1870, that were formerly conceived by the National Arms Company, but Colt's also started developing its own rear-loading guns and cartridges. In 1871, Colt's introduced its first revolver models using rear-loaded metallic cartridges: the .41 caliber Colt House Revolver (also known as the Cloverleaf for its four-round cylinder configuration) and the .22 cal Colt Open Top Pocket Model Revolver. However, Colt's wanted a more powerful practical handgun loaded with metallic cartridges so the company put forward William Mason, who in 1871 began work on Colt's first .44 caliber metallic-cartridge revolver: the Colt Model 1871-72 Open Top. The company registered two patents for the Open Top, one in 1871, the other in 1872, the same patents mentioned in the markings of Colt Single Action Army revolvers, a nowadays legendary and long produced model, improved and based on the Open Top. Production of the Open Top started in 1872 and stopped in 1873 when the Single Action Army model started to be delivered to the US Army. However, the Open Top was already a completely new design. The parts, for example, would not interchange with the older percussion pistols. Mason moved the rear sight to the rear of the barrel as opposed to the hammer or the breechblock of the earlier efforts. The caliber was .44 rimfire and it was submitted to the US Army for testing in 1872. The Army rejected the pistol and asked for a more powerful caliber with a stronger frame. Mason redesigned the frame to incorporate a topstrap, similar to the Remington revolvers, and placed the rear sight on the rear of the frame; he consulted with Richards on some other improvements. The first prototype of the new gun was still chambered in .44 rimfire, but the first model was in the newest caliber known as the .45 Colt. Colt Single Action Army, U.S. Artillery Model The revolver was chosen by the Army in 1872, with the first order, for 8000 revolvers, shipping in the summer of 1873: The Colt Single Action Army or \\"Peacemaker\\", also known as the Colt Model 1873, was born. This revolver was one of the most prevalent firearms in the American West during the end of the 19th century and Colt still produces it, in six different calibers, two finishes and three barrel lengths. 2nd Generation Colt Single Action Army In the new market of metallic cartridge rear-loading pocket revolvers, Colt's not only introduced its three Derringer Models (as of 1870) or the Colt House and the Open Top Pocket (the last two as of 1871) but also introduced in 1873 a subsequent design called its \\"New Line\\" revolver models, based on William Mason's patents. After the success of the Colt Single Action Army and Colt's conversion of existing percussion revolvers to Richards-Mason conversions, Mason went on to design Colt's first Double-action revolver, the Colt M1877. Following this, he once again teamed up with Richards to produce a larger- framed version, the Colt M1878 Frontier. It was Colt's first large-frame, double-action revolver. It combined the front end of the Single Action Army revolver with a double-action, 6-shot frame mechanism. It was available commercially in numerous calibers. The 1870s and 1880s provided sales opportunity to the Colt company via the spread of European-American society ever further westward across the continent, and the demand for firearms that it engendered in various ways. As white Americans displaced Indians from the Indian Territory, both sides were eager for firearms. On the white side, both the U.S. Army and civilians were customers of Colt. The Army carried Colt revolvers through the last of its Indian Wars. On the Indian side, Colt weapons were captured when possible, or bought from whoever was selling. Even among whites in towns where Indians had been vanquished, a thriving demand for guns existed, from the criminals to the police to self-defending civilians. Memoirs of Americans including Walter Chrysler and Jack Black speak of what it was like growing up in Western towns where most people had guns and open carry was common (such as in Kansas and Missouri, which were considered \\"out West\\" at the time‚Äînow considered the Old West). 1890s Colt finally left the \\"loading gate concept\\" for a swing-out cylinder on its revolvers with the Colt M1889 Navy revolver, which resembled the Colt M1878 and was based on another design by Mason. The model was produced for three years between 1889 and 1892, and eclipsed by the Colt M1892 chambered in .38 Long Colt. The M1892 was replaced by the New Service Double Action revolver in 1899. In caliber .45 Colt, the New Service was accepted by the U.S. Military as the Model 1909 .45 revolver. The New Service revolver was available in other calibers such as .38 Special and, later in the 20th century, .45 ACP (as the M1917 revolver) and .357 Magnum. Under a contract with the U.S. Army, Colt Arms built the Model 1895 ten-barrel variant of the Gatling Gun, capable of firing 800‚Äì900 .30 Army rounds per minute, and used with great effect at the Battle of San Juan Hill.. The M1895 Colt‚ÄìBrowning machine gun or \\"Potato Digger\\" was built by Colt. The Colt‚ÄìBrowning was one of the first gas-operated machine guns, originally invented by John Browning. It became the first automatic machine gun adopted by the United States and saw limited use by the U.S. Marine Corps at the invasion of Guant√°namo Bay and by the 1st Volunteer Infantry in the Santiago campaign during the Spanish‚ÄìAmerican War. In 1901, Elizabeth Jarvis Colt sold the company to a group of outside investors based in New York and Boston. =20th century= 1900‚Äì1920s M1911 and M1911A1 pistols Colt-Thompson Model 1921 with Type C drum magazine During World War I, Colt surpassed all previous production achievements. John Browning worked for Colt for a time, and came up with a design for a semiautomatic pistol, which debuted as the Colt M1900 pistol and eventually evolved into the M1911. Prior to America's entry into the war, orders from Canada and the United Kingdom swelled the backlog of orders to three years. Colt hired 4,000 more workers, making a total of 10,000 employees‚Äîand its stock's price increased by 400%. By 1918, Colt had produced and sold 425,500 of the famous Browning-designed M1911. Because the factory could not keep up with demand for this pistol, the US Military decided to accept Colt New Service revolvers in caliber .45 ACP, called the M1917 revolver, as a substitute weapon. Competing manufacturer Smith & Wesson made double-action revolvers in .45 ACP, which were accepted and issued by the U.S. military under the same name. Colt produced 151,700 revolvers during the war as well as 13,000 Maxim-Vickers machine guns and 10,000 Browning machine guns with an additional 100,000 under subcontract to other companies. Since Auto-Ordnance had no tooling for production of the newly developed Thompson submachine gun, John T. Thompson, in August 1920, entered into contact with Colt's to manufacture 15,000 Thompson 1921 submachine guns. The contract was signed on August 18, 1920. Colt's tooled up and produced the 15,000 units between April 1921 and March 1922. The stock market crash of 1929 and the ensuing Great Depression resulted in a slowing down of production for Colt. In anticipation of this, company presidents William C. Skinner and Samuel M. Stone implemented a diversification program similar to that done at the close of the American Civil War. Colt acquired contracts for business machines, calculators, dishwashers, motorcycles, and automobiles; all marketed under a name other than Colt. Samuel Stone acquired a firm which manufactured plastics and renamed it \\"Colt rock\\" as well as a company that manufactured electrical products. Colt weathered the financial crises of the time by cutting the work week, reducing salaries, and keeping more employees on the payroll than they needed. These measures kept the company in business but ate up the cash surplus they had acquired during the World War I years. 1930s: Great Depression In 1935, after employees voted to disband a labor union, 1,000 workers went on strike for 13 weeks. Strikers became violent, attacking workers and detonating a bomb in front of company president Samuel M. Stone's house. The company set up a barracks, dining room, and recreation room for workers within the Colt Armory during the strike. On June 3, 1935 the National Recovery Administration ruled that the company was within its rights not to deal with the union and the strike ended. In the year following the strike, the factory was hit by a hurricane and flood. Many company shipping records and historical documents were lost as a result.Lendler (1997) pp. 18‚Äì19 1939‚Äì1945: World War II M1911A1 At the beginning of World War II, Colt ceased production of the Single Action Army revolver to devote more time to filling orders for the war. During the war Colt manufactured over 629,000 M1911A1 pistols as well as a large number of M1917 water-cooled machineguns. The company had a workforce of 15,000 men and women in three factories and production ran on three shifts, 24 hours a day, and won the Army-Navy rating of \\"E\\" for excellence. Colt ranked 99th among United States corporations in the value of World War II military production contracts.Peck, Merton J. & Scherer, Frederic M. The Weapons Acquisition Process: An Economic Analysis (1962) Harvard Business School p.619 However, the company was losing money every year due to mismanagement, an embittered workforce that had been stretched to its limits, and manufacturing methods which were becoming obsolete. 1945‚Äì1950s As the war ended and demand for military arms came to a halt, production literally ceased. Many long-time workers and engineers retired from the company and nothing was built from 1945 to 1947. Mismanagement of funds during the war had a serious impact as the 105-year-old firm faced possible bankruptcy. In September 1955 the board of directors voted to merge Colt with an upstart conglomerate called Penn-Texas, which had acquired Pratt & Whitney Machine Tool the same year. Also in 1955, Colt released one of the most famous revolvers in history, the Colt Python. In 1958 Penn-Texas merged with Fairbanks-Morse to form the Fairbanks-Whitney Corporation and in 1964 the conglomerate reorganized as Colt Industries. In 1956 Colt resumed production of the Single Action Army revolver and in 1961 began making commemorative versions of their classic models. 1960s‚Äì1970s M16 The 1960s were boom years for Colt with the escalation of the Vietnam War, Robert McNamara shutting down the Springfield Armory, and the U.S. Army's subsequent adoption of the M16, for which Colt held the production rights and would sell over 5 million units worldwide. Colt would capitalize on this with a range of AR-15 derivative carbines. They developed AR-15-based Squad Automatic Weapons, and the Colt SCAMP, an early PDW design. The Colt XM148 grenade launcher was created by Colt's design project engineer, gun designer Karl R. Lewis. The May 1967 \\"Colt's Ink\\" newsletter announced that he had won a national competition for his selection and treatment of materials in the design. The newsletter stated in part \\"In only 47 days, he wrote the specifications, designed the launcher, drew all the original prints, and had a working model built\\". At the end of the 1970s, there was a program run by the Air Force to replace the M1911A1. The Beretta 92S won, but this was contested by the Army. The Army ran their own trials, leading eventually to the Beretta 92F being selected as the M9. In the early 1960s Colt threatened legal action against Major League Baseball's new Houston franchise, the Colt .45s, citing trademark infringement. In December 1964 the team backed down, renaming itself the Astros.It is often claimed that the team changed its name to match its new stadium, the Astrodome, but the reverse is the case; the Harris County Domed Stadium was renamed to match the team. 1980s‚Äì1990s The 1980s were fairly good years for Colt, but the coming end of the Cold War would change all that. Colt had long left innovation in civilian firearms to their competitors, feeling that the handgun business could survive on their traditional revolver and M1911 designs. Instead, Colt focused on the military market, where they held the primary contracts for production of rifles for the US military. This strategy dramatically failed for Colt through a series of events in the 1980s. In 1984, the U.S. military standardized on the Beretta 92F. This was not much of a loss for Colt's current business, as M1911A1 production had stopped in 1945. Meanwhile, the military rifle business was growing because the U.S. military had a major demand for more upgraded M16s; the M16A2 model had just been adopted and the military needed hundreds of thousands of them. In 1985, Colt's workers, members of the United Auto Workers went on strike for higher wages. This strike would ultimately last for five years, and was one of the longest-running labor strikes in American history.Lendler (1997) pp. 25‚Äì27 With replacement workers running production, the quality of Colt's firearms began to decline. Dissatisfied with Colt's production, in 1988 the U.S. military awarded the contract for future M16 production to Fabrique Nationale.Lendler (1997) pp. 21‚Äì22 Some criticized Colt's range of handgun products in the late 1980s as out of touch with the demands of the market, and their once-vaunted reputation for quality had suffered during the UAW strike. Colt's stable of double-action revolvers and single-action pistols was seen as old-fashioned by a marketplace that was captivated by the new generation of \\"wondernines\\" ‚Äì high-capacity, 9√ó19mm Parabellum caliber handguns, as typified by the Glock 17. Realizing that the future of the company was at stake, labor and management agreed to end the strike in an arrangement that resulted in Colt being sold to a group of private investors, the State of Connecticut, and the UAW itself. The new Colt first attempted to address some of the demands of the market with the production in 1989 of the Double Eagle, a double-action pistol heavily based on the M1911 design, which was seen as an attempt to \\"modernize\\" the classic Browning design. Colt followed this up in 1992 with the Colt All American 2000, which was unlike any other handgun Colt had produced before‚Äîbeing a polymer-framed, rotating-barrel, 9√ó19mm handgun with a magazine capacity of 15 rounds. It was designed by Reed Knight, with parts manufactured by outside vendors and assembled by Colt; its execution was disastrous. Early models were plagued with inaccuracy and unreliability, and suffered from the poor publicity of a product recall. The product launch failed and production of the All American 2000 ended in 1994. This series of events led to the company's Chapter 11 bankruptcy in 1992. In 1992, the creditors, state and shareholders enlisted the aid of turnaround specialist RC (Ron) Whitaker to overcome the bankruptcy challenge. He developed a new team to address the company's situation. In addition to creating a positive working relationship with the UAW to introduce new techniques like cellular manufacturing, operator quality assurance and single piece flow, they developed a renewed focus on product development. This resulted in the M4 carbine and Colt 22 pistol, two of the most successful new product offerings in the late 1990s, capturing 50% market shares in the first year of production. M4 Carbine The 1990s brought the end of Cold War, which resulted in a large downturn for the entire defense industry. Colt was hit by this downturn, though it would be made worse later in the 1990s by a boycott by the shooting public in America. In 1994, the assets of Colt were purchased by Zilkha & Co, a financial group owned by Donald Zilkha. It was speculated that Zilkha's financial backing of the company enabled Colt to begin winning back military contracts. In fact during the time period it won only one contract, the M4 carbine. However, the U.S. military had been purchasing Colt carbines for the past 30 years (See Colt Commando). During a 1998 Washington Post interview, CEO Ron Stewart stated that he would favor a federal permit system with training and testing for gun ownership. This led to a massive grassroots boycott of Colt's products by gun stores and US gun owners. Zilkha replaced Stewart with Steven Sliwa and focused the remainder of Colt's handgun design efforts into \\"smart guns,\\" a concept favored politically, but that had little interest or support among handgun owners or police departments. This research never produced any meaningful results due to the limited technology at the time. Colt announced the termination of its production of double-action revolvers in October 1999. =21st century= 2002‚ÄìPresent The boycott of Colt gradually faded out after William M. Keys, a retired U.S. Marine Lt. General, took the helm of the company in 2002. Keys salvaged Colt's reputation and brought Colt from the brink of bankruptcy to an international leader in Defense production. In 2010 Gerald R. Dinkel replaced Keys as CEO of Colt Defense LLC, while Keys remained on the Board of Directors for Colt Defense. Colt has to compete with other companies that make M1911-style pistols such as Kimber and AR-15 rifles such as Bushmaster. Bushmaster has subsequently overtaken Colt in the number of AR-15s sold on the civilian market. Colt suffered a legal defeat in court when it sued Bushmaster for trademark infringement claiming that \\"M4\\" was a trademark that it owned. The judge ruled that since the term M4 is a generic designation that Colt does not specifically own, Colt had to pay monetary reimbursement to Bushmaster to recoup Bushmaster's legal fees. The M4 designation itself comes from the U.S. military designation system, whose terms are in the public domain. Modified Sport Rifle Colt has entered in several US contracts with mixed results. For example, Colt had an entry in the Advanced Combat Rifle (ACR) program of the 1980s, but along with other contestants failed to replace the M16A2. Colt and many other makers entered the US trials for a new pistol in the 1980s, though the Beretta entry would win and become the M9 Pistol. The Colt OHWS handgun was beaten by H&K; for what became the MK23 SOCOM, it was lighter than the H&K; entry but lost in performance. Colt did not get to compete for the XM8 since it was not an open competition. Colt is a likely entrant in any competition for a new US service rifle. Current M16 rifles have been made primarily by FN USA since 1988. However, Colt remained the sole source for M4 carbines for the US military. Under their license agreement with Colt, the US military could not legally award second-source production contracts for the M4 until July 1, 2009. 200px In a 2002 restructuring, Colt's Manufacturing Company, Inc, spun off Colt Defense, LLC, to supply military, law enforcement and security markets. Colt's Manufacturing Company itself become a subsidiary of New Colt Holding Corp, LLC. In 2013 Colt Defense acquired New Colt Holding Corp., in part to protect a licensing agreement set to expire in 2014, where Colt's Manufacturing sold sporting rifles marketed to consumers that were manufactured by Colt Defense. This formed a single company to develop, manufacture and sell firearms under the Colt name for all markets for the first time since the 2003 completion of the restructuring. In 2013, Dennis R. Veilleux assumed the role of President & Chief Executive Officer for Colt Holding Co. LLC and President & Chief Executive Officer of Colt Defense LLC. Mr. Veilleux previously occupied the position of Principal at Sturm, Ruger & Co., Inc., Principal at General Electric Co., President & Chief Executive Office at Colt's Manufacturing Co. LLC and President & Chief Executive Officer at New Colt Holding Corp. Following persistent reliability problems, the reunited Colt lost its contract with the US military for M4 rifles in 2013. Parent company Colt Defense, LLC, filed for Chapter 11 bankruptcy protection on June 15, 2015, citing both assets and debts in the $100 million to $500 million range.Colt files for bankruptcy, seeks August auction accessdate=2015-06-15 According to analysts, Colt's problems were due to the loss of the contract and low demand for its civilian handguns. In January 2016, Colt announced that the bankruptcy court had approved its restructuring plan. After restructuring, a reinvigorated Colt introduced several new versions of its 1911 pistols, including stainless-steel competition and target models., Ammoland.com, retrieved 27 January 2020 In 2017, Colt returned to the production of double-action revolvers with the .38 Colt Cobra, followed in 2019 by an improved version of the 1999 .357 Magnum Carry, the King Cobra.

Its current president is Jean- Christophe Rolland who succeeded Denis Oswald at a ceremony held in Lucerne in July 2014. The World Rowing Cup, World Rowing Championships, and other such competitions are overseen by this organization.  History  It was founded by rowing representatives from France, Switzerland, Belgium, Adriatica, and Italy on 25 June 1892 in Turin in response to the growing popularity of the sport of rowing, and the consequent need for uniformity of regulations over such matters as race lengths, boat composition, and weight classes. Also, at the time, betting on rowing was very popular, and the rowers or coaches were themselves often taking bets. Amateur status was unknown in the sport, a state of affairs which can lead to corruption, such as thrown races. The first regatta organised by the newly formed FISA was the European Rowing Championships and was held in 1893 in Orta, Italy. It only had 10 entries in 3 events and no professional participants. By 1925, the 27th European Championships, held in Prague, included 24 entries in 10 different events. FISA established its headquarters in Lausanne, Switzerland in 1922. FISA was the first international sports federation to join the Olympic movement. It has been on the Olympic program since the 1896 Summer Olympics in Athens. (The rowing events at the 1896 games were cancelled because of high winds). Each country that participates in rowing has a federation or governing body which belongs to the FISA Congress. These federations (of which there are currently 156) have overall control of what FISA does. FISA decided in 1955 that only a united German team could compete at international rowing championships; this first applied to European Championships and later, from the inaugural in 1962 onwards, to World Championships. This required that East and West Germany held selection trials, with the winning country for each boat class choosing the rowers who would compete at the championships. Over the years, the relationship between the two German countries deteriorated, and East Germany made seven application to FISA congresses to be recognised as a separate and independent country. On the seventh occasion, there was insufficient time to discuss the issue at the congress held in Duisburg just prior to the men's competition of the 1965 European Rowing Championships. FISA president Thomas Keller stated that an extraordinary congress were to be held in November in Vienna that would discuss the issue, and that he personally saw no problem with solving the problems. In October 1965, the International Olympic Committee decided that East Germany was to have its own team at future Olympic Games. At the FISA congress in November 1965, the East German application found forty-six votes of support, four abstentions (from Germany and Austria), and no votes of disapproval. At the same congress, Keller's proposal to not play national anthems or raise flags during medal ceremonies was also approved. These changes first applied at the European Championships (for women) in August 1966 and then the World Championships (for men) two weeks later in September. =Presidents= FISA is led by a president. The following list gives presidents since 1924: * 1924‚Äì1926 Eug√®ne Baud, Switzerland * 1926‚Äì1949 Rico Fioroni, Switzerland * 1949‚Äì1958 Gaston Mullegg, Switzerland * 1958‚Äì1989 Thomas Keller, Switzerland * 1989‚Äì2014 Denis Oswald, Switzerland * 2014‚Äìpresent Jean-Christophe Rolland, France Membership At the 2019 Ordinary Congress FISA admitted its 156th member.  Events  FISA organises a large number of international rowing events throughout the year. =Olympics= FISA has been sponsoring the program for rowing events at the Olympic games since the initial Olympic games in 1896 in Athens. It is also responsible for running the qualification program to select the participants for the games. =World Rowing Cup= Started in 1997, the World Cup comprises three regattas held in early Summer. =World Rowing Championships= A week- long regatta held every year. During Olympic years, only non-Olympic boat classes race. =World Rowing Junior Championships= Running since 1967, the Junior Championships is for those who are under 18 by the end of the current calendar year. During Olympic years it is held at the same time as the World Rowing Championships. =World Rowing Under 23 Championships= First held in 1976, this regatta is for those too old for the Junior Championships but who do not turn 23 by the end of the current calendar year (previously categorised as Senior B by FISA). The event was originally named the Nations Cup and opposed by FISA. In 2002 the name was changed to the World Rowing U23 Regatta and further changed to World Rowing U23 Championships in 2005. =World Rowing Coastal Championships= First held in 2006. =World Rowing Indoor Championships= World Rowing, in partnership with Concept2, USRowing and the Erg Sprints organising committee of Alexandria, Virginia, USA, are pleased to announce the first World Rowing Indoor Championships to be staged in Alexandria from 17 to 18 February 2018. =World Rowing Masters Regatta= Held since 1973, this event is for rowers 27 years of age or over. Men and women compete in age categories ranging from \\"A\\" (27 to 35) to \\"K\\" (85 and older). The largest annual international regatta, in 2013 it attracted approximately 3500 competitors who competed in 440 races over four days. There are also events for mixed crews - where half the crew is men and half women (excluding cox). The 2010 regatta took place in St. Catharines, Ontario, Canada, 2011 in Poznan Poland, 2012 in Duisburg Germany, 2013 in Varese Italy, 2014 in Ballarat Australia, 2015 in Hazewinkel Belgium, 2016 in Copenhagen Denmark, e 2017 in Bled Slovenia, 2018 in Sarasota USA, and 2019 in Lake Valence Hungary. The 2020 regatta will be in Linz-Ottensheim Austria, 2021 in Banyoles Spain, 2022 in Libourne France, 2023 in Pretoria South Africa, and 2024 in Brandenburg Germany. =World Rowing Sprints= A new idea introduced in 2002 as an attempt to bring rowing to the centre of cities. The first (and only) event took place on the Serpentine Lake in Hyde Park, London and was sponsored by Mercedes-Benz. Crews from Great Britain, United States, Germany, and the Netherlands took part in the 500 m race. Famous rowing champions raced, including Matthew Pinsent, James Cracknell, and Marcel Hacker. Each team was made up of 13 rowers (5 women, 7 men, and a cox). Events were held in Women's Single Sculls, Men's Single Sculls, Women's Double Sculls, Men's Pairs, Women's Pairs and Men's Fours. These crews then combined to form Mixed Quad Sculls and Eights. Great Britain were the eventual winners and crowned the Mercedes-Benz Sprints Champions.

The 147 newly elected members of the 13th D√°il assembled on 18 February when the First Inter-Party government in the history of the Irish state was appointed. The general election took place in 40 parliamentary constituencies throughout Ireland for 147 seats in the lower house of parliament, D√°il √âireann. For this election the membership of the D√°il was increased to 147 seats, an increase of 9 since the previous election. The 1948 general election is considered an important election in 20th-century Ireland, as it paved the way for the First Inter-Party Government. This election was the last one before Ireland's withdrawal from the British Commonwealth, and the declaration of the Republic of Ireland, which came into effect as from 18 April 1949 under the terms of the Republic of Ireland Act 1948. The constituency of Carlow‚ÄìKilkenny voted on 8 February after the death during the campaign of Fine Gael candidate Eamonn Coogan TD. Another Fine Gael candidate in that constituency, James Hughes, had died shortly before the formal campaign began. Campaign The general election of 1948 was caused by a desire by the Taoiseach √âamon de Valera, to stop the rise of a new party, Clann na Poblachta. In 1947 the rapid rise of Clann na Poblachta threatened the position of Fianna F√°il. The government of √âamon de Valera introduced the Electoral (Amendment) Act 1947 which increased the size of the D√°il from 138 to 147 and increased the number of three-seat constituencies from fifteen to twenty-two. The result was described by historian Tim Pat Coogan as \\"a blatant attempt at gerrymander which no Six County Unionist could have bettered.\\" A number of other issues were raised on the campaign that the parties didn't foresee. Fianna F√°il had enjoyed an uninterrupted sixteen years of dominance in government. Many people believed that the party had become stale and there was a strong desire for a fresh change. Although World War II had ended three years earlier, rationing continued, and massive inflation plagued the economy. A prolonged teachers strike during the lifetime of the previous D√°il damaged the government due to its inability to settle the dispute. Bad weather added to the woes of the farmers, and poor harvests resulted in anger at the ballot box. Allegations that √âamon de Valera and Se√°n Lemass were involved in bribery and corruption raised questions about certain public officials. Despite these issues, Fianna F√°il still expected to retain power. This prospect seemed very likely; however, an unlikely coalition was soon to be formed. Result } *First Inter-party government formed. When the votes were counted Fianna F√°il remained the largest party in spite of dropping 8 seats. Clann na Poblachta secured ten seats instead of the nineteen they would have received proportional to their vote. The other parties remained roughly the same, with Fine Gael only gaining an extra seat. Fianna F√°il remained the largest party and it looked as if it were the only one capable of forming a government. =Voting summary= =Seats summary= Formation of the Coalition The election left de Valera six seats short of a majority in the 147 seat D√°il. Fianna F√°il had long refused to enter a formal coalition with another party, instead preferring confidence and supply agreements with other parties when it was short of an outright majority. This time, however, de Valera was unable to reach an agreement with National Labour and the Independents with a view to forming a government. It seemed unlikely that the other political parties could join together to oust Fianna F√°il. However, the leaders of the other parties discovered that between them, they only had one seat fewer than Fianna F√°il. If they could get the support of at least seven independents, they would be able to form a government. On paper, such a motley coalition appeared politically unrealistic. However, a shared dislike of Fianna F√°il and de Valera overcame all other difficulties to knock Fianna F√°il from power for the first time in 16 years. As the largest party in the coalition, it was a foregone conclusion that Fine Gael would provide the nominee for Taoiseach. The natural choice was the party leader, Richard Mulcahy. However, republicans such as Se√°n MacBride refused to serve under the man who had been the commander of the Free State forces during the civil war. Since the other parties would have been 17 seats short of a majority (and indeed, would have been 11 seats behind Fianna F√°il) without MacBride, Mulcahy stepped aside in favour of John A. Costello, a relatively unknown politician and former Attorney General. Mulcahy, who remained nominal leader of Fine Gael, became Minister for Education. William Norton, the leader of the Labour Party became T√°naiste and Minister for Social Welfare. On paper, this new coalition government looked weak and seemed unlikely to last. It consisted of a patchwork collection of political parties. There were young and old politicians, republicans and Free Staters, conservatives and socialists. The government's survival depended on a united dislike of Fianna F√°il, the skill of Costello as Taoiseach and the independence of various ministers. In all the coalition lasted over three years from February 1948 to May 1951.

Biography The son of George Gordon, 5th Earl of Huntly, and of Anne, daughter of James Hamilton, 2nd Earl of Arran and Duke of Ch√¢tellerault, he was educated in France as a Roman Catholic. He took part in the plot which led to the execution of James Douglas, 4th Earl of Morton in 1581 and in the conspiracy which saved King James VI from the Ruthven raiders in 1583. In 1588 he signed the Presbyterian confession of faith, but continued to engage in plots for the Spanish invasion of Scotland. On 28 November he was appointed captain of the guard, and while carrying out his duties at Holyrood his treasonable correspondence was discovered. King James, however, finding the Roman Catholic lords useful as a foil to the tyranny of the Kirk, was at this time seeking Spanish aid in case Queen Elizabeth I tried to challenge his right to the English throne; Huntly, always one of his favourites, was pardoned. The Scottish Justice Clerk, Lewis Bellenden wrote of Huntly in October 1587, alleged to be a promoter of the Catholic faith at court: > \\"to the Earl of Huntly's lying in his majesty's chamber and preaching > Papistry, truth it is I think he be a Papist, but not precise as he had not > rather lie in a fair gentlewoman's chamber than either in the king's, or yet > where he might have an hundred masses.\\"Calendar State Papers Scotland: > 1586-1588, vol. 9 (Edinburgh, 1915), p. 491. Huntly married Henrietta Stewart, daughter of Esm√© Stewart and Catherine de Balsac, on 21 July 1588. They had contracted to marry in 1581. James VI composed a poetic entertainment with speeches from Mercury, a group of nymphs, Agrestis, and some comedy.Allan Westcott, New poems by James I of England: from a hitherto unpublished manuscript (Columbia University Press, 1911), pp. 47-52. This marriage increased Huntly's influence and connections within Scotland and also brought him closer to French Catholic influences.R. Grant, 'Friendship, politics and religion' in M. Kerr-Peterson & S.J. Reid, James VI and Noble Power in Scotland 1578-1603 (Abingdon, 2017), 69-70. He was the father of Mary Gordon, who married William Douglas, 1st Marquess of Douglas. In April 1589, Huntly raised a rebellion in the north, but was obliged to surrender to Sir John Carmichael, captain of the king's guard, and Captain William Home at Terrisoul near Aberdeen. He was brought to Edinburgh to be warded in Robert Gourlay's house. After a short imprisonment in Borthwick Castle he was again freed.James Dennistoun, Moysie's Memoirs of the Affairs of Scotland (Edinburgh, 1830), p. 76-7 He then involved himself in a private war with the Grants and the Mackintoshes, who were assisted by the Earls of Atholl and Moray; and on 8 February 1592 he set fire to Moray's castle of Donibristle in Fife, and stabbed the earl to death with his own hand. This outrage, which inspired the ballad The Bonnie Earl o' Moray, brought retribution on Huntly when his enemies ravaged his lands. In December the \\"Spanish Blanks\\" were intercepted, two of which bore Huntly's signature, and a charge of treason was again brought against him, while on 25 September 1593 he was excommunicated. James treated him and the other rebel lords with great leniency. On 26 November they were freed from the charge of treason, being ordered at the same time, however, to renounce their Catholic faith or leave the kingdom. On their refusal to comply they were attainted. Huntly then joined Francis Hay, 9th Earl of Erroll and Francis Stewart-Hepburn, 5th Earl of Bothwell, in a conspiracy to imprison the king, and they defeated the royal forces under Argyll in the Battle of Glenlivet on 3 October 1594, Huntly especially distinguishing himself. His victory gained no real advantage; his castle of Strathbogie was blown up by James, and Huntly left Scotland in about March 1595. He returned secretly soon afterwards, and his presence in Scotland was at first tolerated by James; but owing to the hostile feeling aroused, and the \\"No Popery\\" riot in Edinburgh, the king demanded that he should abjure Romanism (Roman Catholicism) or go into permanent banishment. He submitted to the Kirk in June 1597, and was restored to his estates in December. On 7 April 1599, he was created a Marquess, and on 9 July, together with Lennox, appointed lieutenant of the north. He was treated with great favour by the king and was reconciled with Murray and Argyll. The Kirk still doubted the genuineness of his abjuration and, on 10 December 1606, he was confined to Aberdeen; on 19 March 1607 he was summoned before the privy council. Huntly thereupon went to England and appealed to James in person. He was excommunicated in 1608, and imprisoned in Stirling Castle until 10 December 1610, when he signed again the confession of faith. Accused of Romanist intrigues in 1616, he was ordered once more to subscribe the confession, which this time he refused to do; imprisoned at Edinburgh, he was set free by James's order on 18 June, and having joined the court in London was absolved from excommunication by Abbot, archbishop of Canterbury; this absolution, after a further subscription to the confession by Huntly, was confirmed by the Kirk. At the accession of King Charles I Huntly lost much of his influence at court. He was deprived in 1630 of his heritable sheriffships of Aberdeen and Inverness. The same year a feud broke out between the Crichtons and the Gordons, in the course of which Huntly's second son, Lord Melgum, was burnt to death either by treachery or by accident, while being entertained in the house of James Crichton of Frendraught. For the ravaging of the lands of the Crichtons Huntly was held responsible, and having been summoned before the privy council in 1635 he was imprisoned in Edinburgh Castle from December till June 1636. He left his confinement with shattered health, and died at Dundee while on his journey to Strathbogie on 13 June 1636, after declaring himself a Roman Catholic. Family He married Henrietta Stewart in 1588. Their children included: * Anne Gordon, who married James Stuart, 3rd Earl of Moray. * Elizabeth Gordon, who married Alexander Livingston, 2nd Earl of Linlithgow in 1611. * Mary Gordon, who married William Douglas, 1st Marquess of Douglas. * George Gordon, 2nd Marquess of Huntly * Jean Gordon, who married Claud Hamilton, 2nd Baron Hamilton of Strabane * John Gordon, Viscount of Melgum, who married Sophia Hay.

The general election took place in 34 parliamentary constituencies for 138 seats in D√°il √âireann, the lower house of the Oireachtas (parliament). Fianna F√°il won an overall majority, and when the newly elected members of the 12th D√°il assembled on 9 June, de Valera was re-appointed as Taoiseach at the head of a majority government. The election was fought while the Emergency Powers Act 1939 was still in force and under the terms of the General Elections (Emergency Provisions) Act 1943, which allowed a general election to be called without a dissolution of the 11th D√°il. Campaign The outgoing Fianna F√°il government was a minority government. Following a defeat for the second reading of its Transport Bill, Taoiseach √âamon de Valera called a snap election, just one year after the previous election, in hopes of getting an overall majority. The campaign was not wanted by the opposition parties. Technically, and exceptionally, the outgoing D√°il was not dissolved until after the election. Although the Constitution requires the President to dissolve the D√°il before a general election, this procedure was overridden by the General Elections (Emergency Provisions) Act 1943.; The Act, which would have been unconstitutional if not for the state of emergency in effect during World War II, was intended to increase national security by minimising the interval during which no D√°il is in existence. The election was called on 9 May but the D√°il met as scheduled on the following day, when an adjournment debate was held in which the opposition TDs condemned the decision to hold an election in wartime as unnecessary and reckless. Fianna F√°il fought the election on its record in government and also in the hope of securing a fresh mandate for its policies. During the campaign Fine Gael put forward the proposal of forming a coalition government with the Labour Party and Clann na Talmhan; however, this was ridiculed by Fianna F√°il as untenable. A split in the Labour movement meant that the party was by no means ready to fight an election, and the results showed this. Due to the fractured nature of the opposition, √âamon de Valera's tactic of calling a snap general election succeeded, as it had in 1933 and 1938.

He is best known for his musicals and operettas, particularly The Student Prince (1924), The Desert Song (1926) and The New Moon (1928). Early in his career, Romberg was employed by the Shubert brothers to write music for their musicals and revues, including several vehicles for Al Jolson. For the Shuberts, he also adapted several European operettas for American audiences, including the successful Maytime (1917) and Blossom Time (1921). His three hit operettas of the mid-1920s, named above, are in the style of Viennese operetta, but his other works, from that time, mostly employ the style of American musicals of their eras. He also composed film scores. Biography Romberg was born in Hungary as Siegmund Rosenberg to a Jewish\\"Posjet predstavnika ≈æidovske opƒáine iz Osijeka\\" (Visit of representatives of the Jewish community of Osijek), Grad Beli≈°ƒáe, Gradski bilten; broj 25, November 15, 2007 \\"Romberg , Sigmund\\" by William A. Everett, Grove Music Online family, Adam and Clara Rosenberg, in Gross-Kanizsa (Hungarian: Nagykanizsa) during the Austro-Hungarian kaiserlich und k√∂niglich (Imperial and Royal) monarchy period. In 1889 Romberg and his family moved to Beli≈°ƒáe, which was then in Hungary, where he attended a primary school. Influenced by his father, Romberg learned to play the violin at six, and piano at eight years of age. He enrolled at Osijek gymnasium in 1897, where he was a member of the high school orchestra. He went to Vienna to study engineering, but he also took composition lessons while living there. In June 1909, to the Port of New York.\\"Romberg, Sigmund\\" by Peter Gammond and Andrew Lamb, The Oxford Companion to Music After a brief stint working in a pencil factory in New York, he was employed as a pianist in caf√©s and restaurants. He eventually founded his own orchestra and published a few songs, which, despite their limited success, brought him to the attention of the Shubert brothers, who in 1914 hired him to write music for their Broadway theatre shows. That year he wrote his first successful Broadway revue, The Whirl of the World. He then contributed songs to several American musical adaptations of Viennese operettas, including the successful The Blue Paradise (1915). Even more successful was the musical Maytime, in 1917. Both involved love across generations and included nostalgic waltzes, along with more modern American dance music.Everett, pp. 77‚Äì92 At the same time, Romberg contributed songs to the Shuberts' popular revues The Passing Show of 1916 and The Passing Show of 1918 and to two vehicles for Al Jolson: Robinson Crusoe, Jr. (1916), an extravaganza burlesque on the familiar story, and Sinbad (1918), an Arabian Nights-themed musical. Romberg wrote another Jolson vehicle in 1921, Bombo.Everett, Chapter 2 He wrote the music for the musical comedy Poor Little Ritz Girl, which also had songs by Richard Rodgers. Romberg's adaptation of melodies by Franz Schubert for Blossom Time (1921, produced in the UK as Lilac Time) was a great success.Everett, Chapter 4 He subsequently wrote his best- known operettas, The Student Prince (1924), The Desert Song (1926) and The New Moon (1928), which are in a style similar to the Viennese operettas of Franz Leh√°r.Everett, Chapters 5, 6 and 7 He also wrote Princess Flavia (1925), an operetta based on The Prisoner of Zenda. His other works, My Maryland (1927), a successful romance; Rosalie (1928), together with George Gershwin; and May Wine (1935), with lyrics by Oscar Hammerstein II, about a blackmail plot; and Up in Central Park (1945), are closer to the American musical in style.Everett, Chapter 8 Romberg also wrote a number of film scores and adapted his own work for film.Everett, Chapter 9 Columbia Records asked Romberg to conduct orchestral arrangements of his music (which he had played in concerts) for a series of recordings from 1945 to 1950 that were issued both on 78-rpm and 33-1/3 rpm discs. These performances are now prized by record collectors. Naxos Records digitally remastered the recordings and issued them in the U.K. (They cannot be released in the U.S. because Sony Music Entertainment, which is a parent company of Columbia Records, holds the copyright for their American release.) Much of Romberg's music, including extensive excerpts from his operettas, was released on LP during the 1950s and 1960s, especially by Columbia, Capitol, and RCA Victor. Nelson Eddy and Jeanette MacDonald, who appeared in an MGM adaptation of The New Moon in 1940, regularly recorded and performed his music. There have also been periodic revivals of the operettas. Romberg died in 1951, aged 64, of a stroke at his Ritz Towers Hotel suite in New York City and was interred in the Ferncliff Cemetery in Hartsdale, New York. Romberg married twice. Little is known about his first wife, Eugenia, who appears on a 1920 federal census form as being Austrian. His second wife was Lillian Harris, whom he married on March 28, 1925, in Paterson, New Jersey. They had no children. Lillian Harris was born March 8, 1898, and died April 15, 1967, in New York City.

The program featured three vocalists (Anne Jamison, Reinhold Schmidt, Robert Merrill), a 58-piece orchestra, and Frank Gallop as host/announcer.The Encyclopedia of Old Time Radio by John Dunning, p. 235 Music genres included \\"operatic arias, short symphonic works and overtures to popular songs, light classics, dance music and even a bit of outright jazz.\\" Honors Since 1970, Beli≈°ƒáe organizes musical evenings in Romberg's honor; similar events are held in Osijek since 1995. He was named as one of the meritorious and notable citizens of Osijek. Romberg was inducted into the Songwriters Hall of Fame in 1970. References Sources *Bordman, Gerald. American Operetta.

Curry was a mentor to Harvey Logan, who would adopt the surname Curry, and the two robbed banks together before both became members of Butch Cassidy's Wild Bunch. Curry was killed by a sheriff while rustling in Grand County, Utah. Early outlaw career Currie was born in West Point, Prince Edward Island, Canada in 1871, the second of six children of John and Nancy Ann (Macdonald) Currie.Donna S. Hudson, \\"The Descendants of Donald Currie,\\" at http://www.islandregister.com/currie2.html Accessed March 10, 2014 His family moved to Chadron, Nebraska where he started rustling as a young man. He gained the sobriquets \\"Big Nose\\", and \\"Flat-Nose\\" and took up residence at the outlaw hideout Hole-in-the-Wall, Wyoming. While there, he met Harvey Logan, who adopted his surname and became known as Kid Curry. The Kid's brothers Lonny and Johnnie Logan, following his example, also adopted Curry as a surname. Kid Curry would go on to become one of the most dangerous and feared gunmen of the Old West. George Currie formed a gang that included Kid Curry, and was captured with him on June 28, 1897. The gang had held up the Butte County Bank at Belle Fourche, South Dakota earlier in the month. All but one of them (Tom O'Day), whose horse had run away without him) had escaped with the money, but while planning another robbery a posse caught them in Fergus County, Montana and captured Curry, along with the Kid and Walt Putney. They escaped from Deadwood jail in November by overpowering the jailer. The three men stole horses and made their way back to Montana, stealing supplies as they went. Another posse caught up with them in the Bearpaw mountains. There was a gunfight from which the fugitives escaped on foot, leaving the stolen goods and horses behind. They retreated to the Hole-in-the-Wall, robbing two post offices on their route. Wild Bunch Flat Nose Curry after his shooting by the sheriff Jesse Tyler At the Hole they were involved in a gun battle with another posse, but the rough terrain, and the defensive structures built and manned by the several dozen outlaw members of the Wild Bunch hiding there, were too much for the lawmen. Curry participated in the Wild Bunch raid on the Union Pacific Overland Flyer train at Wilcox, Wyoming, on June 2, 1899, which became famous, as well as taking part in several other robberies. The Overland Flyer's train crew provided descriptions of the robbers, which local Converse County Sheriff Josiah Hazen recognized as being Butch Cassidy, Kid Curry, Flat Nose George Curry, and Elzy Lay. Hazen formed a posse immediately but Kid Curry and George Curry shot and killed Hazen during his posse's pursuit of them, which slowed the posse. In the ensuing confusion the Wild Bunch were able to wade downstream and escape without their horses. The outlaws walked to a sheep ranch at Castle Creek, where they rested before continuing to the Tisdale mountains on the north fork of the Powder River. Here they were able to obtain replacement horses and resupply. (Local Deputy Sheriff William Deane came into contact with the gang there but was shot and killed by Kid Curry April 15, 1897.) Although the posse greatly outnumbered them and could cover a lot of ground in its search, the Wild Bunch reached the safe stronghold of the Hole-in-the-Wall. Pinkerton agent Charlie Siringo and contracted Pinkerton agent Tom Horn developed information that identified Kid Curry as killing Hazen. There were never any definite accounts connecting Kid Curry to the killing of Deputy Deane, but rumors uncovered by Siringo while he worked undercover indicated that Kid Curry had been the killer. The Currys and some of the other members of the Wild Bunch went to hide at Robbers Roost in Utah, after getting supplies at the ranch of female outlaws Josie and Ann Bassett. George Curry was shot and killed on April 17, 1900 by Sheriff Jesse Tyler while Curry was rustling in Grand County, Utah. Upon hearing of this, Harvey \\"Kid Curry\\" Logan, who was also enraged by the recent law enforcement killing of his younger brother Lonny in Missouri, vowed to get revenge. In May, Kid Curry rode from New Mexico to Utah, and took revenge for his brother and George Curry's deaths by killing Sheriff Tyler and his Deputy Sheriff Sam Jenkins in a gunfight.

They were active in Kansas, Missouri, Arkansas, and Oklahoma Territory during the 1890s--robbing banks and stores, holding up trains, and killing lawmen. They were also known as The Oklahoma Long Riders because of the long dusters that they wore. The gang formed in the last decade of the 19th century, and most of its members were killed before 1900. Only two of its eleven members survived into the 20th century, and all eleven met violent deaths in gun battles with lawmen. Members The gang was led by Bill Doolin and William Marion \\"Bill\\" Dalton; it included the following men at various times: William \\"Tulsa Jack\\" Blake, Dan \\"Dynamite Dick\\" Clifton, Roy Daugherty (a.k.a. \\"Arkansas Tom Jones\\");, George \\"Bitter Creek\\" Newcomb (a.k.a. \\"Slaughter Kid\\"); Charley Pierce, William F. \\"Little Bill\\" Raidler, George \\"Red Buck\\" Waightman, Richard \\"Little Dick\\" West, and Oliver \\"Ol\\" Yantis. Additionally, two teenaged girls, known as Little Britches and Cattle Annie, followed the gang, informing them of the movements of law enforcement officers whenever they pursued the criminals. Doolin, Newcomb, and Pierce had previously been members of the Dalton Gang, which had been dominated by Bill Dalton's brothers. Bill Dalton had aided his brothers in their gang, but had never taken part in any of their robberies and did not get involved until after the deaths of three of them at a bank robbery in Coffeyville, Kansas. Doolin had worked as a cowboy in Kansas and the Cherokee Outlet. As a leader of the Wild Bunch, he had something of a Robin Hood image because he and his gang preyed on wealthy institutions. He and his gang received considerable aid from the general public in eluding the law (see Ingalls, Oklahoma). Origins What was known as the Dalton Gang had been dominated by several Dalton brothers, and led by Bob Dalton. Doolin, Newcomb, and Charley Pierce were also members. They took part in the botched train robbery in Adair, Oklahoma Territory, on July 15, 1892, in which two guards and two townsmen, both doctors, were wounded, one of the doctors dying the next day. Doolin, Newcomb, and Pierce complained that Bob Dalton was not dividing money fairly among the gang and left in protest, but would later return. According to some accounts, Bob Dalton told Doolin, Newcomb, and Pierce that he no longer needed them. Doolin and his friends returned to their hideout in Ingalls, Oklahoma Territory. On October 5, four of the remaining five members of the Dalton Gang would be killed in Coffeyville, Kansas during a botched robbery. For a time, Doolin and his partners operated under outlaw Henry Starr (Cherokee), hiding out about 75 miles northeast of Kingfisher, Oklahoma, from where they made several raids. Doolin, Newcomb, and Pierce visited the Daltons' mother in Kingfisher to console her after her son's deaths. Brothers Lit and Bill Dalton were also visiting their mother, and Doolin proposed that they join him and his group to avenge their brothers. Bill Dalton agreed to join them and soon took part in several robberies, but Lit refused in disgust. Henry Starr was arrested in 1893 and held for trial at Fort Smith. As Doolin and Dalton were accepted as leaders of the gang, it became known as the Doolin--Dalton Gang, and also as the Wild Bunch. They hid out in northeastern Payne County, and were obtaining ammunition and supplies at the little village of Ingalls. Career Doolin soon took action: On November 1, 1892, his new gang, the Wild Bunch, robbed the Ford County Bank at Spearville, Kansas, getting away with all the cash on hand and over $1,500 in treasury notes. From the postcard descriptions sent out, the city marshal of Stillwater, Oklahoma Territory recognized Ol' Yantis, the gang's newest member. The marshal's posse soon cornered and killed Yantis in a shootout. On June 11, 1893, the Wild Bunch held up a Santa Fe train west of Cimarron, Kansas. They took $1,000 in silver from the California-New Mexico Express. A sheriff's posse from old Beaver County, Oklahoma Territory, caught up with the gang north of Fort Supply. The gang got away but, in the ensuing gunfight, Doolin was shot in the left foot. The injury gave him pain for the rest of his life. On September 1, 1893, a posse organized by the new U.S. Marshal, Evett Dumas \\"E.D.\\" Nix, entered the outlaw town of Ingalls with the intent to capture the gang. In what would be remembered as the Battle of Ingalls, three of the fourteen lawmen were killed in the gunfire. Two town citizens also died; one was killed protecting the outlaws. After a short break the gang continued its activities in Oklahoma Territory. On January 3, 1894, Pierce and Waightman held up the store and post office at Clarkson. On January 23, the gang robbed the Farmers Citizens Bank at Pawnee, and March 10, the Wild Bunch robbed the Santa Fe Railway station at Woodward of more than $6,000. On March 20, Nix sent the Three Guardsmen a directive to take care of the Wild Bunch. The directive stated in part, \\"I have selected you to do this work, placing explicit confidence in your abilities to cope with those desperadoes and bring them in--alive if possible --dead if necessary.\\" On April 1, 1894, the gang attempted to rob the store of retired US Deputy Marshal W.H. Carr at Sacred Heart, Indian Territory. Although shot through the stomach, Carr shot Newcomb in the shoulder, and the gang fled without getting anything. On May 10, 1894, the Wild Bunch robbed the bank at Southwest City, Missouri, of $4,000, wounding several townspeople and killing one. On May 21, 1894, the jurors in Arkansas Tom's trial found him guilty of manslaughter rather than murder in the killing of three Deputy US Marshals. Frank Dale, the territorial judge hearing the case, returned to Guthrie, the territorial capitol in Oklahoma, and told US Marshal E.D. Nix, \\" ... you will instruct your deputies to bring them in dead.\\" Bill Dalton, meanwhile, had left Doolin to form his own Dalton Gang. On May 23, 1894, Dalton and his new gang robbed the First National Bank at Longview, Texas. This was the gang's only job. Various posses would kill three of the members and send the last one to life in prison. On December 19, 1894, Doolin was reportedly one of six men who attempted to rob the J.R. Pearce store at Texana, Oklahoma Territory; they were driven off having looted with less than $20.00 worth of merchandise. On April 3, 1895, the Wild Bunch, without Doolin, held up a Rock Island train at Dover, Oklahoma. Unable to open the safe containing the $50,000 army payroll, they robbed passengers of cash and jewelry. Deputy U.S. Marshal Chris Madsen and his posse took a special train to Dover and picked up the trail at daybreak, surprising the gang around noon. The marshals killed Blake and scattered the gang. This was the last robbery committed by the Wild Bunch as a gang, although some of its members kept up the robberies and killings for which they were known. Demise Roy Daugherty a.k.a. \\"Arkansas Tom Jones\\" Bill Doolin U.S. Marshal Evett \\"E.D.\\" Nix was appointed in 1893. He made his main priority the toppling of the Doolin-Dalton Gang. Nix appointed one hundred marshals to the task, insisting that they hunt down all outlaws, but making this gang a priority. Marshal Nix was staunchly supportive of his deputies and whatever they felt was necessary to bring down the gang.

Sometimes the gang was referred to as the 'Hole in the Wall Gang'. This was during the Old West era in the United States. It was popularized by the 1969 movie, Butch Cassidy and the Sundance Kid, and took its name from the original Wild Bunch. The gang was led by Butch Cassidy, and it included his closest friend Elzy Lay, the Sundance Kid, Tall Texan, News Carver, Camilla \\"Deaf Charley\\" Hanks, Laura Bullion, Flat-Nose Curry, Kid Curry and Bob Meeks. They were the most successful train-robbing gang in history. History The Wild Bunch gang claimed to make every attempt to abstain from killing people, and Cassidy boasted of having never killed a single man or woman in his entire career. These claims were false, however. Kid Curry, \\"Flat-Nose\\" George Curry, Will Carver and other members of the gang killed numerous people during their flight from law enforcement. Kid Curry alone killed nine lawmen while with the gang, and another two civilians during shootouts, becoming the gang's most feared member. Elzy Lay killed another two lawmen following a robbery, for which he was wounded, arrested and sentenced to life imprisonment. George Curry killed at least two lawmen, before being killed by Grand County, Utah lawmen.Sheriff Josiah Hazen at Officer Down Memorial Page 1892 tintype portrait of five members of the \\"Wild Bunch\\" gang dressed in bowler hats and city clothes shows, clockwise, from the top left, Kid Curry, Bill McCarty, Bill (Tod) Carver, Ben Kilpatrick, and Tom O'Day The gang was also closely associated with female outlaws Ann Bassett and Josie Bassett, whose ranch near Browns Park supplied the gang often with fresh horses and beef. Both Bassett girls would become romantically involved with several members of the gang, and both would occasionally accompany the gang to one of their hideouts, called \\"Robbers Roost\\". Associations with ranchers like these in the area allowed the gang considerable mobility, giving them an easy resupply of fresh horses and supplies, and a place to hole up for a night or two. At 1:00 a.m on June 2, 1899, Cassidy, Sundance Kid, Harvey Logan and Lay robbed a Union Pacific train near Wilcox, Wyoming. They wore masks made from white napkins, possibly pilfered from a Harvey House restaurant. In the holdup, they stole between $30,000 and $60,000. The gang split up afterward, a common ploy to throw off pursuers, and several fled to New Mexico. On July 11, 1899, gang members robbed a train near Folsom, New Mexico, without Cassidy's presence. The pursuit by a posse led by Sheriff Ed Farr culminated in two gun battles, during which Sheriff Farr and two deputies were killed. Gang member Sam Ketchum was wounded and died in custody. Elzy Lay, one of Cassidy's closest friends and cofounder of the Wild Bunch gang, was wounded and also captured. Cassidy and the other members regrouped in Wyoming. On August 29, 1900, Cassidy, the Sundance Kid, Kid Curry and another unidentified gang member believed to have been Will Carver, held up another Union Pacific train at Tipton, Wyoming. Less than a month later, on September 19, 1900, they raided the First National Bank of Winnemucca, Nevada, stealing $32,640. These and other lucrative robberies led to much notoriety and fame. =End of the Wild Bunch= A posse was assembled to fight the Wild Bunch in 1900. Photograph shows the bodies of Ben Kilpatrick and Ole Hobek being held up by others after being killed near Sanderson Tex., Mar. 13, 1912 In early 1901, Cassidy, the Sundance Kid, and Sundance's girlfriend Etta Place relocated to Patagonia, Argentina, where they spent time at La Leona, 110km from El Calafate in the Province of Santa Cruz, to escape the pursuit of Pinkerton detectives and other lawmen. That same year, Will Carver was wounded by lawmen on April 1 and died in May. Ben Kilpatrick and Laura Bullion were captured in Tennessee in December 1901; he received a 20-year prison sentence and she was sentenced to five years. Kid Curry killed two lawmen in Knoxville, Tennessee; he escaped capture and traveled to Montana, where he killed the rancher who had killed his brother Johnny years before. He was captured on his return to Tennessee, but escaped again. Kid Curry killed himself in Colorado in 1904 during a shootout with lawmen, for he had said that no lawman would ever take him alive. In 1908, Cassidy and Sundance were killed in a shootout with Bolivian cavalry. Etta Place disappeared, her last known sighting was in San Francisco, 1909. It had been suspected she may have reinvented herself as a brothel and hotel owner named Eunice Gray, in Fort Worth, Texas; recent photographic evidence refutes this. Elzy Lay was released from prison in 1906, and after a brief visit to the Bassett ranch in Utah, he relocated to California, where he became a respected businessman; he died there in 1934. Ben Kilpatrick was released from prison in 1911, and was killed during a train robbery in Texas in 1912. Laura Bullion was released from prison in 1905 and lived the remainder of her life as a seamstress, dying in Memphis, Tennessee in 1961, the last of the Wild Bunch. =In popular culture= *The Three Outlaws (1956), starring Neville Brand as Butch Cassidy and Alan Hale Jr as the Sundance Kid, is a fictional film of the duo's exploits with Wild Bunch member William \\"News\\" Carver as the third outlaw in the title. * Butch Cassidy and the Sundance Kid (1969), was directed by George Roy Hill and written by William Goldman (who won the Academy Award for Best Original Screenplay for the film). * Drifters (2009‚Äì?), is a manga featuring Butch Cassidy and Sundance Kid as supporting characters to the protagonists.

A convert to Catholicism, he openly conspired with the king of Spain to try to unseat the Protestant Queen Elizabeth. Biography He was the son of Andrew Hay, 8th Earl of Erroll by his first wife, Lady Jean Hay, daughter of William Hay, 6th Earl of Erroll. He was the second eldest son, but his older brother Alexander, who was a deaf-mute, was declared \\"insane\\" and skipped in the succession. Francis succeeded to the earldom upon the death of his father in 1585. In 1587 he married Mary Stewart, sister of the Earl of Atholl. She died soon after, and it was alleged he was cruel to her. Her family withheld his dowry money, and her brother took revenge in 1589 when Erroll was declared a rebel.Calendar State Papers Scotland: 1589-1603, vol. 10 (Edinburgh, 1936), p. 276. Early in his life he converted to Roman Catholicism, and as the associate of George Gordon, 1st Marquess of Huntly joined in the Spanish conspiracies against the throne of Queen Elizabeth. In 1589, he began engaging in treasonous correspondence with King Philip II of Spain, who was also briefly King of England by his marriage to Queen Mary. A letter he wrote to King Philip declaring his allegiance to Spain was intercepted and sent by Elizabeth to James VI. In February 1589, he was ordered to appear in front of the Privy Council. Failing to appear, he was denounced as a rebel. He engaged with Huntly and Crawford in a rebellion in the north of Scotland, but their forces surrendered at Aberdeen on the arrival of the king in April; and in July, Erroll gave himself up to James, who leniently refrained from exacting any penalty. Erroll submitted himself to the king's mercy at Edzell Castle on 5 August 1589.Calendar of State Papers Scotland, vol. 10 (Edinburgh, 1936), p. 132. In September of the same year he entered into a personal bond with Huntly for mutual assistance; and in 1590 displeased the king by marrying, in spite of his prohibition, Lady Elizabeth Douglas, daughter of the William Douglas, 6th Earl of Morton. The marriage was arranged at the initiative of the Master of Glamis, to form a political faction. On 21 April 1590 the Earl of Montrose and others at Megginch Castle tried to persuade him not to marry her, but Erroll argued he could change his wife's friends' alliances.Calendar State Papers Scotland, vol. 10 (1936), pp. 281, 285: Register of the Privy Council, vol. 5 (Edinburgh, 1881), pp. 506-7. He was involved in a quarrel with the Earl of Atholl at Perth on 29 June 1591, when Anne of Denmark made a ceremonial entry to the town. Atholl was Provost of Perth and Errol was Constable and they argued over their precedence.Calendar State Papers Scotland: 1589-1603, vol. 10 (Edinburgh, 1936), p. 540. Erroll was imprisoned on suspicion of complicity in the attempt made by Francis Stewart, 5th Earl of Bothwell and Patrick Gray, 6th Lord Gray to surprise the king at Falkland in June 1592; and though he obtained his release, he was again proclaimed a rebel on account of the discovery of his signature to two of the Spanish Blanks, unwritten sheets subscribed with the names of the chief conspirators in a plot for a Spanish invasion of Scotland, to be filled up later with the terms of the projected treaty. After a failure to apprehend him in March 1593, Erroll and his companions were sentenced to abjure Roman Catholicism or leave the kingdom; and on their non-compliance were in 1594 declared traitors. At Midsummer 1594 the earl hosted his allies the earls of Angus and Huntly at Towie, and there were bonfires and drinking and dancing.Annie I. Cameron, Calendar State Papers Scotland, vol. 11 (Edinburgh, 1952), p. 370. On 3 October they defeated at Glenlivet a force sent against them under the Earl of Argyll. His men carried a banner showing a cross and the beheading of Mary, Queen of Scots. Erroll himself was severely wounded by a bullet in the arm and an arrow in the thigh.Calendar State Papers Scotland, vol. 11 (Edinburgh, 1952), p. 460. It was falsely rumoured that he came south to Callendar House, the home of his sister Helenor Hay, Countess of Linlithgow, and died.Calendar State Papers Scotland, vol. 11 (Edinburgh, 1952), p. 473. Old Slains Castle, his seat, was razed to the ground. The rebel lords left Scotland in 1595, and Erroll, on report of his further conspiracies abroad, was arrested by the states of Zeeland, but was afterwards allowed to escape. He returned to Scotland secretly in 1596. In March 1597 he was lodged in the Canongate of Edinburgh, and was in the especial favour of Anne of Denmark.Calendar State Papers Scotland, vol. 11 (Edinburgh, 1952), p. 493. On 20 June 1597 he abjured Roman Catholicism and made his peace with the Church of Scotland. He enjoyed the favour of the king, and in 1602 was appointed a commissioner to negotiate the union with England. His relations with the Kirk, however, were not so amicable. The reality of his conversion was disputed, and on 21 May 1608 he was confined to the city of Perth for the better resolution of his doubts, being subsequently declared an obstinate \\"papist\\", excommunicated, deprived of his estate, and imprisoned at Dumbarton; and after some further vacillation was finally released in May 1611. The dispute which began in his lifetime concerning the hereditary office of Lord High Constable between the families of Erroll and of the Earls Marischal was settled finally in favour of the former; thus establishing the precedence enjoyed by the earls of Erroll next after the royal family over all other subjects in Scotland. Marriage and issue He married: #Mary, daughter of John Stewart, 4th Earl of Atholl and Margaret Fleming, in 1587. #Margaret, daughter of James Stewart, Earl of Moray #Elizabeth, daughter of William Douglas, 6th Earl of Morton By his third wife Elizabeth Douglas he had five sons and eight daughters: #William, 10th earl #George #Francis #Thomas #Lewis #Anne, married George Seton, 3rd Earl of Winton #Jean, married John Erskine, Earl of Mar #Mary, married Walter Scott, 1st Earl of Buccleuch #Elizabeth, married Hugh Sempill, 5th Lord Sempill; secondly; James Douglas, 1st Lord Mordington #Sophia Hay, who married John, Viscount Melgum, son of George Gordon, 1st Marquess of Huntly #Margaret, married Sir John Seton of Barns #Isabel, died unmarried #Helen (died 1625, aged 10) The earl died on 16 July 1631, and was buried in the church of Slains.

It was the first election held since the Statute of Westminster granted full independence to the Irish Free State a year earlier. The newly elected 153 members of the 7th D√°il assembled at Leinster House on 9 March 1932 when the new President of the Executive Council and Executive Council of the Irish Free State were appointed by Governor-General James McNeill on the nomination of D√°il √âireann. The general election took place in 30 parliamentary constituencies throughout the Irish Free State for 153 seats in the lower house of parliament, D√°il √âireann. The 1932 general election was one of the most important general elections held in Ireland in the 20th Century, resulting in the Free State's first change of government. Cumann na nGaedheal, which had been the governing party since 1922, was defeated by Fianna F√°il, which became the largest party in the chamber and formed a government with the support of the Labour Party. Fianna F√°il would be the largest party in D√°il √âireann at every general election until 2011. Cumann na nGaedheal Cumann na nGaedheal fought the general election on its record of providing ten years of stable government. The party brought stability following the chaos of the Irish Civil War, and provided honest government. However, by 1932 this provision of solid government was wearing thin, particularly since the party had no solution to the collapse in trade which followed the depression of the early 1930s. Instead of offering new policies the party believed that its record in government would be enough to retain power. Cumann na nGaedheal also played the \\"red card\\" tactic, describing Fianna F√°il as communists and likening √âamon de Valera to Joseph Stalin. Fianna F√°il In comparison to Cumann na nGaedheal, Fianna F√°il had an elaborate election programme, designed to appeal to a wide section of the electorate. It played down its republicanism to avoid alarm, but provided very popular social and economic policies. The party promised to free IRA prisoners, abolish the Oath of allegiance and reduce the powers of the Governor-General and the Senate. It also promised the introduction of protectionist policies, industrial development, self-sufficiency and improvements in housing and social security benefits.Paul Bew, Ellen Hazelkorn, and Henry Patterson, The Dynamics of Irish Politics (London: Lawrence & Wishart, 1989), p. 42Peter Mair and Liam Weeks, \\"The Party System,\\" in Politics in the Republic of Ireland, ed. John Coakley and Michael Gallagher, 4th ed. (New York: Routledge, 2004), p. 140 Campaign The election campaign between the two ideologically opposed parties was reasonably peaceful. However, during the campaign the government prosecuted de Valera's newly established newspaper, The Irish Press. The editor was also brought before a military tribunal. This was seen by many as a major blunder and a serious infringement on the belief of freedom of speech. The \\"red scare\\" tactics also seemed to backfire on the government, who seemed to have little else to offer the electorate. Two days before the election, Patrick Reynolds TD (Cumann na nGaedheal, Leitrim‚ÄìSligo) was assassinated in Ballinamore by Joseph Leddy. A Garda detective was murdered in the same incident. The poll in Leitrim‚ÄìSligo was postponed and Reynolds' widow Mary was elected in his place.https://www.irishtimes.com/news/former-td-was-synonymous-with-fine-gael- in-leitrim-1.1128781 Result } *Fianna F√°il minority government formed. When the results were known Fianna F√°il was still five seats short of an overall majority, but it still looked like the only party capable of forming a government. Discussions got underway immediately after the election and an agreement was reached in which the Labour Party would support Fianna F√°il. The party now had the necessary votes to form a minority government. =Voting summary= =Seats summary= Transition of power On 9 March 1932 the first change of government in the Irish Free State took place. Many in the country and abroad wondered if the true test of democracy would be passed, whether it would be possible for the men who won a civil war only ten years before to hand over power to their opponents. Similar to when the party first entered the D√°il in 1927, a number of Fianna F√°il TDs had guns in their pockets. However, the feared coup d'√©tat did not take place. W. T. Cosgrave was determined to adhere to the principles of democracy that he had practised while in government. Likewise, the army, Garda S√≠och√°na and the civil service all accepted the change of government, despite the fact that they would now be taking orders from men who had been their enemies less than ten years previously. After a brief and uneventful meeting in the D√°il chamber, √âamon de Valera was appointed President of the Executive Council of the Irish Free State by the Governor-General, James McNeill, who had come to Leinster House to make the appointment rather than require de Valera travel to the Viceregal Lodge, formerly a symbol of British rule. Fianna F√°il, a party led by many of the men most closely identified with opposing the existence of the state ten years earlier, were now the party of government. Not only that but the 1932 general election was the beginning of a sixteen-year period in government for Fianna F√°il.

It is located in the metropolitan area of the capital, San Juan. History Puerto Rico was part of the Spanish Empire from the time of Christopher Columbus until the Spanish‚ÄìAmerican War. United States forces landed in Gu√°nica on July 25, 1898. The last Spanish unit left the island the following October, and the Department of Puerto Rico was established. Upon the signing of the Treaty of Paris on December 10, 1898, Spain ceded Puerto Rico to the United States, and the island became an unincorporated United States territory. =The Puerto Rico Regiment= On July 1, 1899, ‚ÄúThe Puerto Rico Regiment of Infantry, United States Army‚Äù was created. On July 1, 1901, Lieutenant Colonel James Anderson Buchanan took command of the regiment. He was later promoted to Colonel on July 21, 1902, and to Brigadier General in 1905. Buchanan served in Puerto Rico from 1898 to 1903 and Fort Buchanan was named after him. =Camp Buchanan= The Puerto Rico Regiment was officially designated as the 65th Infantry Regiment in 1920, after defending the Canal Zone during World War I. A tract of 300 acres approximately six miles on the south shore of San Juan Bay was acquired to provide the regiment with a training area. The site was established in 1923 as Camp Buchanan. It served as a target range and maneuver area for the U.S. Army and National Guard troops from 1923 to 1939. The 1st Battalion 51st Coast Artillery Regiment was also assigned to Camp Buchanan in 1939. =Fort Buchanan= Camp Buchanan in 1939, photograph by Robert Yarnall Richie In May 1940 the location was renamed Fort Buchanan. It was eventually expanded to 4,500 acres. During World War II, Fort Buchanan housed a depot supplying the Army Antilles Department. It also processed local troops through its replacement center. The industrial complex included pier facilities, ammunition storage areas and an extensive railroad network connecting the military installation to the Port of San Juan at San Juan Bay. Puerto Rican soldiers being deployed during World War II and the Korean War were transported from the train station to the Army terminal at the Port of San Juan. At the time, Fort Buchanan served as a citizens training camp and soldier processing station. After World War II the post was gradually reduced to its current size of 746 acres. Fort Buchanan remained a command depot with post facilities, a personnel center, and a special training center until closure as an Army post in 1966. On December 31, 1966, with the deactivation of the Antilles Command, Fort Buchanan passed to the control of the United States Navy. On December 7, 1971, the Third U.S. Army resumed control of Fort Buchanan, and in 1973 the post came under direct control of the United States Army Forces Command (FORSCOM). Following the Department of Defense Unified Command Plan, Fort Buchanan came under control of United States Southern Command (SOUTHCOM). From 1999 to 2003 it was occupied by United States Army South (USARSO). In 2002 Fort Buchanan became part of the Southeast Regional Office of the Installation Management Agency (IMA), and in 2003 it became an IMA Reserve installation. In 2006 it became a garrison under United States Army Installation Management Command, Southeast Region (IMCOM-SE). On October 1, 2008 the Commanding General of the 81st Regional Readiness Command became Fort Buchanan's Senior Mission Commander under the United States Army Reserve Command (USARC). Based on the December 2008 Unified Command Plan, Fort Buchanan currently falls under the United States Northern Command (USNORTHCOM) area of operations, under the direct control of the Installation Management Command, Atlantic Region (IMCOM-Atlantic). On October 23, 2009, an explosion at the nearby Caribbean Petroleum Corporation two people suffered minor injuries at Fort Buchanan, and four other people sought help for respiratory problems. The explosion caused minor damages in some facilities of the military installation.Explosion rocks Gulf facility on Puerto Rico on NBC News; Associated Press (10/23/2009) In 2017 after the wake of Hurricane Maria, Fort Buchanan served as a command center during the recovery efforts. Military active duty, reserve and National Guard units from the continental United States were mobilized from Fort Buchanan all over the island for the emergency. Thousands of these service members were awarded the Humanitarian Service Medal for their disaster relief efforts. The United States Army Corps of Engineers also managed operations from Fort Buchanan. Today United States Army Garrison Fort Buchanan consists of 746.16 acres between the municipalities of Bayam√≥n and Guaynabo, Puerto Rico with a real estate value estimated at $560 million. Fort Buchanan serves a population of approximately 130,000, including military personnel, their dependents, retirees, veterans, and the civilian workforce. Fort Buchanan is host to a number of tenant activities, most of them branches from the United States Armed Forces Reserve Component such as the headquarters for the 1st Mission Support Command of the United States Army Reserve, the United States Navy Reserve Navy Operations Support Center Puerto Rico (NOSC Puerto Rico) and the United States Marine Corps Reserve. The Puerto Rico National Guard is also present on the base. The Reserve Officer Training Corps (ROTC) has held leadership labs and other activities at Fort Buchanan.

Life He was born in Peebles on 10 May 1830, the son of William Calderwood, a corn merchant, and his wife Elizabeth Mitchell.http://www.royalsoced.org.uk/cms/files/fellows/biographical_index/fells_indexp1.pdf He was educated at the Edinburgh Institution and then the High School in Edinburgh, and later attended University of Edinburgh. He studied for the ministry of the United Presbyterian Church of Scotland, and in 1856 was ordained pastor of the Greyfriars church, Glasgow. He also examined in mental philosophy for the University of Glasgow from 1861 to 1864, and from 1866 conducted the moral philosophy classes at that university, until in 1868 he became Professor of Moral Philosophy at Edinburgh, holding this post until his death 29 years later.Gilbert, W.M., editor, Edinburgh in the Nineteenth Century, Edinburgh, 1901:183 He was made LL.D. of Glasgow in 1865. At this point the family lived at 197 St Vincent Street.Glasgow Post Office Directory 1865-6 In 1869 he was elected a Fellow of the Royal Society of Edinburgh his proposer being John Hutton Balfour.http://www.royalsoced.org.uk/cms/files/fellows/biographical_index/fells_indexp1.pdf His address was then given as Craigrowan, a large villa in Merchiston on the west side of the city. His first and most famous work was The Philosophy of the Infinite (1854), in which he attacked the statement of Sir William Hamilton that we can have no knowledge of the Infinite. Calderwood maintained that such knowledge, though imperfect, is real and ever-increasing; that Faith implies Knowledge. His moral philosophy is in direct antagonism to Hegelian doctrine, and endeavours to substantiate the doctrine of divine sanction. Beside the data of experience, the mind has pure activity of its own whereby it apprehends the fundamental realities of life and combat. He wrote in addition A Handbook of Moral Philosophy, On the Relations of Mind and Brain, Science and Religion, The Evolution of Man's Place in Nature. Among his religious works the best-known is his Parables of Our Lord, and just before his death he finished a Life of David Hume in the Famous Scots Series. His interests were not confined to religious and intellectual matters; as the first chairman of the Edinburgh school board, he worked hard to bring the Education Act into working order. He published a well-known treatise on education. In the cause of philanthropy and temperance he was indefatigable. In politics he was at first a Liberal, but became a Liberal Unionist at the time of the Home Rule Bill. Calderwood was an advocate of theistic evolution.Livingstone, David N. (2009). Evolution and Religion. In Michael Ruse; Joseph Travis. Evolution: The First Four Billion Years. Harvard University Press. p. 357. In his book Evolution and Man's Place in Nature he wrote that \\"evolution stands before us as an impressive reality in the history of Nature.\\"Lundin, Roger. (2013). Christ Across the Disciplines: Past, Present, Future. Wm. B. Eerdmans Publishing Co. p. 95. He is buried in Morningside Cemetery, Edinburgh, towards the south-west.

He is best known for having killed outlaw John Selman, killer of John Wesley Hardin, and for his partnership with lawman Jeff Milton, with the pair bringing down several outlaws during their time together. Early life, controversial killing Scarborough was born in Louisiana. His family moved to Texas, where for a while he worked as a cowboy. In 1885, he was appointed sheriff for Jones County. He would later work as a Deputy US Marshal in and around El Paso, Texas. On June 21, 1895, while working alongside El Paso police chief Jeff Milton, Scarborough shot and killed Martin M'Rose, a Texas rustler. M'Rose is buried near John Wesley Hardin, and Texas Ranger Ernest St. Leon. Jeff Milton was Chief of Police in El Paso at that time, and Scarborough was a US Marshal. M'Rose had been captured, and was killed while being brought back from Mexico by the two lawmen on an outstanding warrant. Outlaw, gunman and paramour of Mrs. M'Rose, John Wesley Hardin, claimed that he had paid Scarborough and Milton to kill Martin M'Rose. Milton and Scarborough were arrested, but Hardin later withdrew his comments and the men were released. Scarborough became well known for his unusual tactics when tracking a wanted outlaw. Often, he would drop himself down to the level of those he was pursuing. This tactic was extremely effective, and made him a hated and feared man among the outlaw element. There are many accusations that he was actively and ambitiously involved in outlaw gangs which he betrayed, but no one ever conclusively proved he was involved in unlawful actions. In July, 1898, Scarborough and Milton tracked, shot and captured outlaw \\"Bronco Bill\\" Walters, killing another member of Walters' gang, and scattering the rest from their hideout near Solomonville, Arizona. In late 1899 and into 1900, Scarborough pursued the Burt Alvord gang. The beginning of the gang's end came during a February 15, 1900, gunfight between five of the gang members and Jeff Milton in Fairbank, Arizona, during which gang member \\"Three Fingered Jack\\" Dunlop was killed, and both gang member Bravo Juan Yaos as well as Milton were wounded. Killing of Old John Selman Scarborough had long feuded with lawman/outlaw Old John Selman. On April 5, 1894, acting as Constable of El Paso Selman shot and killed Scarborough's close friend and former Texas Ranger Bass Outlaw. Selman was tried for the killing and found not guilty. In reality, Bass Outlaw was not innocent in his own death. Intoxicated, he threatened to kill a local judge and was ordered by Selman to return home and sleep off his intoxication. Outlaw instead visited a brothel then a saloon. He argued with Texas Ranger Joe McKirdict, who attempted to talk him into leaving. Outlaw shot and killed Ranger McKirdict, then turned on Selman, who engaged him in a gunfight. Selman was wounded twice in the thigh. Outlaw was killed. The killing was found justified by the court. On August 19, 1895, John Selman shot and killed John Wesley Hardin at the Acme Saloon Bar in El Paso. In 1896, on the second anniversary of his friend Outlaw's death, Scarborough called Selman into the alley behind the Wigwam Saloon. The two men argued and fought. Scarborough claimed both drew their guns so he fatally shot Selman; however, no gun was found on Selman's body. Conveniently, a thief who claimed to have stolen Selman's gun immediately after the gun fight was arrested before Scarborough's trial. Scarborough was acquitted. He then moved to Deming, New Mexico, where he worked as a gunman for the Grant County Cattlemen's Association. He was also associated with the arrest of Pearl Hart. Death On April 1, 1900, Scarborough was involved in a shootout with George Stevenson and James Brooks. He killed one of the men but was shot in the leg and was taken back to Deming where the leg was amputated. He died four days later - coincidentally six years to the day after the death of his friend Texas Ranger Bass Outlaw, and four years after he shot Outlaw's killer, John Selman.

He was known for his pioneering Ornithological Dictionary of 1802, which for the first time accurately defined the status of Britain's birds. He is remembered today for species such as the Montagu's harrier, named for him. Life and work George Montagu was born to James Montagu (1713‚Äì1790), who was great-great-grandson of Lord James Montagu (d. 1665), who was younger son of Henry Montagu, 1st Earl of Manchester. Montagu is best known for his Ornithological Dictionary (1802) and his contributions to early knowledge of British birds. He showed that many previously accepted species were invalid, either because they were birds in summer or winter plumage or males and females of the same species. His study of harriers resulted in the discovery that the Montagu's harrier was breeding in southern England. He was also involved in the first British records of cirl bunting, whose breeding range in England is around his home in Devon,Moss, 2005. p. 18 as well as of cattle egret, little gull and gull-billed tern.Mearns, 1988. He was born at the family home of Lackham House in Wiltshire, some three miles south of Chippenham in the northwest of that county, and baptised at Lacock Church on 9 July 1753. In 1770 he joined the army as an Ensign in the 15th Regiment of Foot. He resigned his commission as a Captain in 1777, but eventually rose to the rank of Lieutenant-Colonel in the Wiltshire Militia. In 1773 he married Ann Courtenay, niece of John Stuart, 3rd Earl of Bute. They settled at Alderton House in Wiltshire. In 1798 Montagu left his wife and moved to Prospect House, near Kingsbridge in Devon. It was here that he wrote his two- volume Ornithological Dictionary; or Alphabetical Synopsis of British Birds. He subsequently entered a relationship with Elizabeth Dorville who worked with him illustrating several of his scientific articles. They went on to have four children together. Montagu had an interest in marine and freshwater natural history, and in 1803 published his Testacea Britannica, a History of British Marine, Land and Freshwater Shells. This described 470 species of molluscs, 100 of which were new to the British list. He supplied some new species of crustacean to William Elford Leach at the British Museum, and recorded some species of fish for the first time in English waters, as well as discovering new species including Montagu's blenny and Montagu's snapper (Lutjanidae). He also described the lesser horseshoe bat for the first time. Montagu's ray, Montagu's sucker and Montagu's sea snail are also named for him. He died of tetanus after stepping on a nail at Knowle House. He was buried at Kingsbridge Parish Church. Montagu's collection of birds was bought by the British Museum, about 200 of which are now housed at the Tring Museum. His annotated copies of the Dictionary and Testacea were bequeathed to the Linnean Society. Works * Ornithological Dictionary; or Alphabetical Synopsis of British Birds, J. White, 1802.

He likely met Butch Cassidy (real name Robert Leroy Parker) after Cassidy was released from prison around 1896. \\"The Wild Bunch\\" gang performed the longest string of successful train and bank robberies in American history. Longabaugh fled the United States along with his consort Etta Place and Butch Cassidy in order to escape the dogged pursuit of the Pinkerton Detective Agency. The trio fled first to Argentina and then to Bolivia, where Cassidy and Longabaugh were killed in a shootout in November 1908.  Early life and career  Longabaugh was born in Mont Clare, Pennsylvania in 1867 to Pennsylvania natives Josiah and Annie G. (n√©e Place) Longabaugh, the youngest of five children. At age 15, he traveled west in a covered wagon with his cousin George. In 1887, he stole a gun, horse, and saddle from a ranch in Sundance, Wyoming. He was captured by authorities and sentenced to 18 months in jail by Judge William L. Maginnis. He adopted the nickname Sundance Kid during this time in jail. After his release, he went back to working as a ranch hand, and he worked at the Bar U Ranch in Alberta, Canada in 1891, which was one of the largest commercial ranches of the time. Longabaugh was suspected of taking part in a train robbery in 1892 and a bank robbery in 1897 with five other men. He became associated with a group known as the Wild Bunch, which included Robert Leroy Parker, better known as Butch Cassidy. Longabaugh was reportedly fast with a gun and was often referred to as a gunfighter, but he is not known to have killed anyone prior to a shootout in Bolivia in which he and Parker allegedly were killed. He became better known than Kid Curry, a member of his gang whose real name was Harvey Logan; Curry killed numerous men while with the gang. Longabaugh did participate in a shootout with lawmen who trailed a gang led by George Curry to the Hole-in- the-Wall hideout in Wyoming, and he was thought to have wounded two men in that shootout. Several people were killed by members of the gang, including five law enforcement officers killed by Logan. \\"Wanted dead or alive\\" posters were posted throughout the country, with rewards of as much as a $30,000 for information leading to their capture or deaths. Longabaugh and Logan used a log cabin at Old Trail Town in Cody, Wyoming as a hide-out, as they planned to rob a bank in Red Lodge, Montana. They then began hiding out at Hole-in-the- Wall, located near Kaycee, Wyoming. From there, they could strike and retreat with little fear of capture, since it was situated on high ground with a view of the surrounding territory in all directions. Pinkerton detectives led by Charlie Siringo, however, hounded the gang for a few years. Parker, Longabaugh, and his consort Etta Place left the United States on February 20, 1901 aboard the British ship Herminius for Buenos Aires, Argentina.  Death  A courier was conveying the payroll for the Aramayo Franke y Cia Silver Mine on November 3, 1908 near San Vicente Canton, Bolivia when he was attacked and robbed by two masked American bandits. The bandits then proceeded to the mining town of San Vicente, where they lodged in a small boarding house owned by Bonifacio Casasola, a miner. Casasola became suspicious of them because they had a mule from the Aramayo Mine which bore the mining company's brand; he informed a nearby telegraph officer who notified the Abaroa cavalry unit stationed nearby. The unit dispatched three soldiers under the command of Captain Justo Concha, and they notified the local authorities. The mayor, a number of his officials, and the three soldiers from the Abaroa Regiment all surrounded the house on the evening of 6 November. The bandits then opened fire, killing one of the soldiers and wounding another and starting a gunfight. The police and soldiers heard a man screaming from inside the house around 2 a.m., during a lull in the firing. They heard a single shot from inside the house, after which the screaming stopped, then they heard another shot minutes later. The soldiers entered the house the next morning and found two dead bodies, both with numerous bullet wounds to the arms and legs. One of the men had a bullet wound in the forehead and the other had a bullet wound in the temple. The police report surmised from the positions of the bodies that one bandit had shot his mortally wounded partner to put him out of his misery, before killing himself with his final bullet soon after. The Tupiza police investigation concluded that the dead men were the bandits who had robbed the Aramayo payroll transport, but the Bolivian authorities could not positively identify them. The bodies were buried at the San Vicente cemetery, where they were interred close to the grave of Gustav Zimmer, a German miner. American forensic anthropologist Clyde Snow and his researchers attempted to find the graves in 1991, but they did not find any remains with DNA matching the living relatives of Parker and Longabaugh. Some have claimed that one or both men survived and returned to the United States. One of these claims was that Longabaugh lived under the name of William Henry Long in the small town of Duchesne, Utah. Long died in 1936, and his remains were exhumed in December 2008 and subjected to DNA testing. Anthropologist John McCullough stated Long's remains did not match the DNA which they had gotten \\"from a distant relative of the Sundance Kid.\\"  Aliases  * The Sundance Kid * Frank Smith * H. A.

In a survey by Joseph M. Williams in Origins of the English Language it is estimated that about 1% of English words are of Dutch origin. In many cases the loanword has assumed a meaning substantially different from its Dutch forebear. Some English words have been borrowed directly from Dutch. But typically, English spellings of Dutch loanwords suppress combinations of vowels of the original word which do not exist in English and replace them with existing vowel combinations respectively. For example, the oe in koekje or koekie becomes oo in cookie, the ij (considered a vowel in Dutch) and the ui in vrijbuiter becomes ee and oo in freebooter, the aa in baas becomes o in boss, the oo in stoof becomes o in stove. As languages, English and Dutch are both West Germanic, and descend further back from the common ancestor language Proto- Germanic. Their relationship however, has been obscured by the lexical influence of Old Norse as a consequence of Viking expansion from the 9th till the 11th century, and Norman French, as a consequence of the Norman conquest of England in 1066. Because of their close common relationship - in addition to the large Latin and French vocabulary both languages possess - many English words are essentially identical to their Dutch lexical counterparts, either in spelling (plant, begin, fruit), pronunciation (pool = pole, boek = book, diep = deep), or both (offer, hard, lip) or as false friends (ramp = disaster, roof = robbery, mop = joke). These cognates or in other ways related words are excluded from this list. Dutch expressions have been incorporated into English usage for many reasons and in different periods in time. These are some of the most common ones: ;From Old Dutch : * Many Latinate words in the English lexicon were borrowed from Latin. Quite a few of these words can further trace their origins back to a Germanic source - usually Old Low Franconian. Old Dutch is the western variant of this language. In cases it is not clear whether the loanword is from Old Dutch (Old West Low Franconian) or another Germanic language, they have been excluded from the list. See also: List of English Latinates of Germanic origin * Since speakers of West Germanic languages spoken along the North Sea coast from the 5th to the 9th century lived close enough together to form a linguistic crossroads - water was the main way of transportation - Dutch and English share some traits that other West Germanic languages do not possess. Lexical examples are Dutch vijf / English five (compare German: F√ºnf) and Dutch leef / English live (compare German Leben). These words have been excluded from the list. See also: Ingvaeonic nasal spirant law * Since the Norman conquest of 1066 many Latinate words entered the English lexicon via French, which has ‚Äì via Old French ‚Äì a substantial base of Old Dutch (or Old Low Franconian) and Middle Dutch. For instance, French boulevard comes from Dutch bolwerk. In cases it is not clear whether the loanword in French is from Dutch or another Germanic language, they have been excluded from the list. See also: Influence of Franconian language on French For some loanwords stemming from this period it is not always clear whether they are of Old Dutch, Old Norse, another Germanic language or an unknown Old English origin. These words have been excluded from the list, or indicated as such. ;From Middle Dutch : * About one-third of the invading Norman army of 1066 came from Dutch speaking Flanders. Many Flemings stayed in England after the Conquest and influenced the English language. * The main part of refugees to England, Wales and Scotland from the 11th till the 17th century were from the Low Countries; particularly Flemish skilled weavers and textile workers immigrated as a result of floods, overpopulation and warfare in Flanders. In 1527, when England's population numbered 5 million, London alone had tens of thousands of Flemings, while an estimated third of the Scottish population has a Flemish background. The Hanseatic League had in the late Middle Ages a trade network along the coast of Northern Europe and England, using to Dutch related Middle Low German as lingua franca. Some loanwords from this period could come from either language. These words have been excluded from the list, or indicated as such. ;From Modern Dutch : * In the Dutch Golden Age, spanning most of the 17th century, Dutch trade, science, military, and art were among the most acclaimed in the world, and many English words of Dutch origin concerning these areas are stemming from this period. * English and Dutch rivalry at sea resulted in many Dutch naval terms in English. See also: Dutch linguistic influence on naval terms * Via settlements in North America and elsewhere in the world Dutch language influenced English spoken there, particularly American English. That resulted also in numerous place names based on Dutch words and places. These are excluded from the list unless they are well known, like Brooklyn (from the Dutch town Breukelen) and Wall Street (from Dutch Walstraat). See also: List of place names of Dutch origin * Due to contact between Afrikaans and English speakers in South Africa, many Dutch words entered English via Afrikaans, which has an estimated 90 to 95% vocabulary of Dutch origin.

For example, different conjugations of a verb may be achieved by changing the final vowel (as in the chart on the right), thus \\"bear[ing] a direct relation to Japanese structure\\" (in Jorden's words), whereas the common Hepburn romanization may require exceptions in some cases, in order to more clearly illustrate pronunciation to native English speakers. JSL differs from Hepburn particularly in that it uses doubled vowels, rather than macrons, to represent the long vowels and . Tokyo (T≈çky≈ç) and Osaka (≈åsaka), for instance, would be written (Tookyoo) and (Oosaka) in JSL. Also, JSL represents „Çì, the syllabic n, as an \\"n\\" with a macron over it, (nÃÑ), to avoid the practice that other systems use of sometimes writing (n) and sometimes (n') depending on the presence of a following vowel or (y). There is a close tie between Japanese pronunciation and JSL, where one consistent symbol is given for each Japanese phoneme. This means that it does depart from Japanese orthography somewhat, as „Åä„ÅÜ is romanized as (oo) when it indicates a long , but as (ou) when it indicates two distinct vowel sounds, such as in (omou) for ÊÄù„ÅÜ („Åä„ÇÇ„ÅÜ). Similarly, (ei) is reserved for the pronunciation [ei] only, whereas other romanization systems (including Hepburn) follow the hiragana orthography, therefore making it impossible to tell whether [eÀê] or [ei] are represented.Jorden 1987: 22 It also distinguishes between (g), which is used when only a sound is possible, and (·∏°), which is used when a velar nasal sound (the \\"ng\\" in the English word \\"singer\\") is also possible. The particles „ÅØ and „Å∏ are romanized (wa) and (e), in accordance with their pronunciation. However, like Kunrei-shiki and Nihon-shiki, JSL does not distinguish between allophones in Japanese which are close to different phonemes in English. JSL indicates the pitch accent of each mora. A vowel with an acute accent (¬¥) denotes the first high-pitch mora, a grave accent (\`) marks the last high-pitch mora, and a circumflex (ÀÜ) marks the only high-pitch mora in a word. In this system Êó•Êú¨ 'Japan' would be written (nih√¥n) and ‰∫åÊú¨ 'two (sticks)' as (n√Æhon), Á´Ø„Åß„Åô 'It's the edge' would be (has√≠ d√®su) (standing for ].Jorden 1987: 11-13 (This is why doubled vowels must be used instead of macrons.)

The prison was built in 1197, was rebuilt several times, and was in use until 1844. It was demolished in 1846.  History  The site of the former Fleet Prison (lower right) on Roque's Map of London 1746 The prison was built in 1197 off what is now Farringdon Street, on the eastern bank of the River Fleet after which it was named. It came into particular prominence from being used as a place of reception for persons committed by the Star Chamber, and, afterwards, as a debtor's prison and for persons imprisoned for contempt of court by the Court of Chancery. In 1381, during the Peasants' Revolt, it was deliberately destroyed by Wat Tyler's men. In 1666, during the Great Fire of London, it burned down on the third day of the fire, the prisoners fleeing in the last moments. After the fire, the warden of the prison, Sir Jeremy Whichcote, purchased Caron House in Lambeth in order to house the prison's debtors. Whichcote then rebuilt the prison on the original site at his own expense. During the 18th century, Fleet Prison was mainly used for debtors and bankrupts. It usually contained about 300 prisoners and their families. Like the Marshalsea prison, it was divided into a restrictive and arduous common side and a more open master's side, where rent had to be paid. At that time, prisons were profit-making enterprises. Prisoners had to pay for food and lodging. There were fees for turning keys and for taking irons off, and Fleet Prison had the highest fees in England. There was even a grille built into the Farringdon Street prison wall, so that prisoners might beg alms from passers- by. But prisoners did not necessarily have to live within Fleet Prison itself; as long as they paid the keeper to compensate him for loss of earnings, they could take lodgings within a particular area outside the prison walls called the \\"Liberty of the Fleet\\" or the \\"Rules of the Fleet\\". From 1613 on, there were also many clandestine Fleet Marriages. The boundary of the Liberties of the Fleet included the north side of Ludgate Hill, the Old Bailey to Fleet Lane and along it until the Fleet Market, and ran alongside the prison to Ludgate Hill. The Racquet Ground of the Fleet Prison circa 1808 The head of the prison was termed the warden, who was appointed by letters patent. It became a frequent practice of the holder of the patent to farm out the prison to the highest bidder. This custom made the prison long notorious for the cruelties inflicted on prisoners. One purchaser of the office, Thomas Bambridge, who became warden in 1728, was of particularly evil repute. He was guilty of the greatest extortions upon prisoners, and, according to a committee of the House of Commons appointed to inquire into the state of English gaols, arbitrarily and unlawfully loaded with irons, put into dungeons, and destroyed prisoners for debt, treating them in the most barbarous and cruel manner, in high violation and contempt of the laws. He was committed to Newgate Prison, and an act was passed to prevent his enjoying the office of warden.Thomas Bambridge, Dictionary of National Biography, accessed February 2010 During the Gordon Riots in 1780 Fleet Prison was again destroyed and rebuilt in 1781‚Äì1782. In 1842, in pursuance of an Act of Parliament, by which inmates of the Marshalsea, Fleet and Queen's Bench prisons were relocated to the Queen's Prison (as the Queen's Bench Prison was renamed), it was finally closed, and in 1844 sold to the Corporation of the City of London, by whom it was pulled down in 1846. The demolition yielded three million bricks, 50 tons of lead and of paving. After lying empty for 17 years the site was sold to the London, Chatham and Dover Railway and became the site of their new Ludgate station.

The priest who married him (Samuel Brooke) and the man who acted as witness to the wedding were also imprisoned. Samuel Byrom, son of the writer and poet John Byrom, was imprisoned for debt in 1725. In 1729 he sent a petition to his old school friend, the Duke of Dorset, in which he raged against the injustices of the system: > Holland, the most unpolite Country in the World, uses Debtors with Mildness, > and Malefactors with Rigour; England, on the contrary, shews Mercy to > Murtherers and Robbers, but of poor Debtors Impossibilities are demanded ... > if the Debtor is able to make up his Affairs with the Creditor, how many > Hundreds are afterwards kept in Prison for Chamber-Rent, and other unjust > Demands of the Gaolers? ...

Specifically, it was one which took place in London's Fleet Prison or its environs during the 17th and, especially, the early 18th century. Irregular and clandestine marriages An \\"irregular\\" marriage was one that took place either away from the home parish of the spouses (but after banns or licence), or at an improper time. \\"Clandestine\\" marriages were those that had an element of secrecy to them: perhaps they took place away from a home parish, and without either banns or marriage licence. It is often asserted, mistakenly, that under English law of this period a marriage could be recognized as valid if each spouse had simply expressed (to each other) an unconditional consent to their marriage. While, with few local exceptions, earlier Christian marriages across Europe were by mutual consent, declaration of intention to marry and upon the subsequent physical union of the parties,Excerpt from Marriage, Sex, and Civic Culture in Late Medieval London \\"the sacramental bond of marriage could be made only through the freely given consent of both parties.\\" in 1563 the Council of Trent, twenty-fourth session, required that a valid marriage must be performed by a priest before two witnesses. By the 18th century, the earlier form of consent-based marriages (\\"common-law marriages\\" in modern terms) were the exception. Nearly all marriages in England, including the \\"irregular\\" and \\"clandestine\\" ones, were performed by ordained clergy. The Marriage Duty Act 1695 put an end to irregular marriages at parochial churches by penalizing clergymen who married couples without banns or licence. By a legal quirk, however, clergymen operating in the Fleet could not effectively be proceeded against, and the clandestine marriage business there carried on. In the 1740s, over half of all London weddings were taking place in the environs of the Fleet Prison. The majority of Fleet marriages were for honest purposes, when couples simply wanted to get married quickly or at low cost. From 1742 to 1754 a large number of such marriages were also conducted at Keith's Chapel, Westminster, by the Rev. Alexander Keith.Geraldine Edith Mitton, Mayfair, Belgravia and Bayswater (2007), p. 28 Fleet Prison The earliest recorded date of a Fleet Marriage is 1613 (although there were probably earlier ones), while the earliest recorded in a Fleet Register took place in 1674. As a prison, the Fleet was claimed to be outside the jurisdiction of the church. The prison warders took a share of the profit, even though a statute of 1711 imposed fines upon them for doing so: it only moved the clandestine marriage trade outside the prison. There were, in fact, so many debtors that many lived in the area outside the prison (itself a lawless area which operated under the \\"rules of the Fleet\\"). Disgraced clergymen (and many who pretended to be clergymen) lived there, and marriage houses or taverns carried on the trade, encouraged by local tavern-keepers in the neighbourhood who employed touts to solicit custom for them. There were also many clerks who made money recording the ceremonies. During the 1740s, up to 6,000 marriages a year were taking place in the Fleet area, compared with 47,000 in England as a whole. One estimate suggests that there were between 70 and 100 clergymen working in the Fleet area between 1700 and 1753. It was not merely a marriage centre for criminals and the poor, however: both rich and poor availed themselves of the opportunity to marry quickly or in secret. Marriage Act 1753 The scandal and abuses brought about by these clandestine marriages became so great that they became the object of special legislation. In 1753, Lord Hardwicke's Marriage Act https://alsatia.org.uk/site/statutes/1753-lord-hardwickes- marriage-act/ was passed, which required, under pain of annulment, that banns should be published or a licence obtained; that, in either case, the marriage should be solemnized in church by a recognised clergyman; and that in the case of minors, marriage by licence must be by the consent of parent or guardian; and that at least two witnesses must be present. Jewish and Quaker ceremonies were exempt. Clergymen conducting clandestine marriages were liable to transportation.Marriage Act 1753 section 8 This Act had the effect of putting a stop to these marriages, so far as England and Wales were concerned, and henceforth couples had to travel to Scotland, the nearest point being Gretna Green. This had substantial use until 1856, when Scottish law was changed to require 21 days' residence. The Act did not extend to Scotland, the Channel Islands or the Isle of Man.Marriage Act 1753 section 18 Similar legislation was passed in the Isle of Man in 1757.http://www.gumbley.net/clandestine.htm See also * History of marriage in Great Britain and Ireland * Jumping the broom, Broomstick marriage * Marriage in England and Wales * Schulze Registers * Savoy Chapel * The Clandestine Marriage References Sources External links * Category:Marriage, unions and partnerships in England Category:Types of marriage Category:Social history of London ","title":"Fleet Marriage"},{"id":"400236","text":"Umbanda () is a syncretic Afro-Brazilian religion that blends African traditions with Roman Catholicism, Spiritism, and Indigenous American beliefs. Although some of its beliefs and most of its practices existed in the late 19th century in almost all Brazil, it is assumed that Umbanda originated in Niter√≥i and surrounding areas in the early 20th century, mainly due to the work of a psychic (medium), Z√©lio Fernandino de Moraes, who practiced Umbanda among the poor Afro-Brazilian slave descendants. Since then, Umbanda has spread across mainly southern Brazil and neighboring countries like Argentina and Uruguay. Umbanda has many branches, each one with a different set of beliefs and practices. Some common beliefs are the existence of a Supreme Creator known as Olodumare. Other common beliefs are the existence of deities called Orix√°s, most of them syncretized with Catholic saints that act as divine energy and forces of nature; spirits of deceased people that counsel and guide practitioners through troubles in the material world; psychics, or mediums, who have a natural ability that can be perfected to bring messages from the spiritual world of Orix√°s and the guiding spirits; reincarnation and spiritual evolution through many material lives (karmic law) and the practice of charity and social fraternity.  Basic beliefs and practices  Umbanda practitioners believe in a supreme creator god; the use of a medium to contact the spirits of deceased people; reincarnation and spiritual evolution through many physical existences; and the practice of charity. The opposite side of the Umbanda (white magic), i.e., black magic ‚Äì the practices that intended to cause evil doings, became known as Quimbanda. Umbanda is juxtaposed with Quimbanda which now reclaims its identity as a separate religion and distinct from Umbanda. One hundred years after its establishment, Umbanda divided itself into several branches with different beliefs, creeds, and practices. Some of these branches are Umbanda d'Angola, Umbanda Jej√™, Umbanda Ketu, and Umbanda Esot√©rica. Three principal items  The three major beliefs claimed by Umbandists are: The Pantheon, the Spirits' World, and the Reincarnation.Dann, Graham M. S. \\"Religion and Cultural Identity: The Case of Umbanda\\". Sociological Analysis, Vol. 30, No. 3, pp. 208‚Äì225. =Pantheon= Umbanda has one supreme god known as Olorum (or Zambi in Umbanda d'Angola) and many divine intermediary deities called Orix√°s. Orix√°s and spirits are organized in a complex hierarchy of legions, phalanges, sub-phalanges, guides, and protectors. The exact order of the hierarchy varies by region and practitioner, but a generally agreed upon structure are the Seven Lines, or Sete Linhas da Umbanda. The first line is the top, usually associated with Oxal√†, and the bottom is always the Linha das Almas, or Line of Dead Souls. The other patrons associated with the lines are listed in 2‚Äì6 below. The lines are often divided up even further into a multitude of spiritual beings. Main Orix√°s #Oxal√° (Oxaguian/Oxalufan) (Syncretized as Jesus) #Iemanj√° (Syncretized mainly as Our Lady of Navigators) #Xang√¥ (Syncretized mainly as John the Baptist) #Ox√∫m (Syncretized mainly as Our Lady of Aparecida) #Og√∫m (Syncretized as Saint George) #Ox√≥ssi (Syncretized mainly as Saint Sebastian) #Ibeji (Syncretized as Saints Cosmas and Damian) #Omulu/Obaluay√™ (Syncretized mainly as Lazarus of Bethany) #Ians√£ (Syncretized as Saint Barbara) #Nan√£ (Syncretized as Saint Anne) #Oxumar√© (Syncretized as Bartholomew the Apostle) #Exu (Syncretized mainly as Anthony of Padua) =World of the Spirits = Most followers of Umbanda believe that there are three distinct levels of spirits. :1. Pure Spirits ::This level includes the spirits known as the angels, archangels, cherubim, and seraphim, spirits that reached spiritual perfection. :2. Good Spirits ::This level includes the spirits that possess mediums (psychics) or initiates during the Umbanda ceremonies and act as Guias (guides) advising and helping the believers. This goods spirits comes in different lines of work inside of Umbanda.Brown, Diana De G.; Mario Bick. Religion, Class, and Context: Continuities and Discontinuities in Brazilian Umbanda. American Ethnologist, Vol. 14, No. 1, Frontiers of Christian Evangelism. (Feb., 1987), pp. 73‚Äì93 These are the following spirits and their line of work: ::Caboclos (Indigenous Brazilians) ::: Those are spirits of deceased Indigenous Brazilians or Mestizos. They are highly knowledgeable about medical herbs, often prescribing inexpensive remedies to ill people. Their speech is always based in truth and courage, and are widely sought after in cases you need strength, and counsel. When a caboclo speaks, you listen. When the medium incorporates a Caboclo, he/she, begins to walk around heavily, and the feature becomes more severe. They frequently smoke cigars and drink a mix of herbs the mediums make. Preto-velho spirits ::Preto Velho (Old Black Man) ::: Those are spirits of old slaves who died enslaved. They are wise, peaceful, and kind spirits that know all about suffering, compassion, forgiveness, and hope. Some of them are considered to be from Angola and Congo, others are considered to be the old Yoruba priests that were first brought to Brazil. They also often prescribe herbal remedies. The female counterpart of this spirit is the Preta Velha (\\"Old Black Woman\\") who demonstrates maternal compassion and concern.Hale, Lindsay Lauren. Preto Velho: Resistance, Redemption, and Engendered Representations of Slavery in a Brazilian Possession-Trance Religion. American Ethnologist, Vol. 24, No. 2 (May, 1997), pp. 392‚Äì414. In the beginning of Umbanda, Preto Velho introduced himself as an old slave who died after being flogged for some unjust accusation; today, Pretos Velhos introduce themselves as old slaves who died in persecution after they run away from the plantation. They are frequently the most loved entities in Umbanda and is very common to see a person consulting with the same preto velho year after year, and develop a love for them. When the medium incorporates a Preto Velho, he can not stand straight, has difficulty walking, and has to make consultations sitting down. They frequently drink coffee and smoke pipes. ::Crian√ßas/Er√™s (Children) ::: Those are spirits of great evolution, appearing as children, to reveal the pure side of life. They are not children who died at an early age. They speak of joy and hope. When they talk, they always intend to cheer you up and make you look at the bright side of things. They are generally characterized as being pure and joyful. Most people make the mistake that, since the medium (psychics) speaks funny, uses candies, lollypops, and ribbons in his head, that he is to be taken lightly. The Er√™s are evolved spirits who say very serious things, although in a funny way. When the medium incorporates an Er√™, he laughs very much, dances, frequently appears with stuffed animals, and speaks with a child's voice. They frequently drink Guaran√° and eat candy. ::Baianos (People from Bahia State) ::: The spirits of people who were practitioners of Umbanda, also considered as the spirits of deceased ancestors. Since they are closest to our time (in comparison to the deceased slaves and the Indigenous Americans), they have a different manner in speaking. They are slow talking with the accent of Bahia. They talk about the need to know how to interpret and overcome the difficulties of life. They frequently drink coconut water, eat farofa, and smoke cigarettes. ::Boiadeiros ::: The spirits of deceased gauchos who lived a hard life in the sert√£o, the arid hinterlands of Brazil. They speak of love, but are frequently harsh in their speech. They work in the spiritual cleaning of the person who is being attended, the medium, and the terreiro (the place where the Umbanda encounters, \\"gira\\" is held). ::Marujos or Marinheiros (Sailors) ::: Spirits of deceased sailors or fishermen that use the power of the ocean to protect people from evil. The water (especially salty water) has its manner of protecting people, cleaning and cleansing. The Marinheiros work in the energy of Yemanj√°. They are happy, funny, and easy going. When a Marinheiro talks, he sometimes appears to be drunk, but that's just his way. They can't stand straight and‚Äî frequently stumble as if they were in a ship, at high seas. They drink a lot of rum. ::Z√© Pilintra ::: He is widely reputed, as the patron spirit of the barrooms, gambling dens, and gutters (while not aligned with \\"evil\\" entities, however). The Z√© Pilintra spirit is famed by its extreme bohemianism and wild partying persona, being a kind of trickster spirit. ::Exu ::: Exu is a phalanx of spirits that are adjusted to Karma. They are messengers of the Orixas and they bring justice to wherever is needed. Offerings are made in the Small Kalunga (cemetery) or at crossroads. The offerings are done only when required by the spirits, never intending to harm anyone. They never use black magic or any animal sacrifice. They protect people while they are on the streets, roads, nightclubs, etc., and also protect them from evil spirits (called obsessing spirits which are spirits that weren't touched by the light yet and use people to feed their bad habits such as addictions to drugs or low emotional states like anger, rage, sadness, guilt, revenge, etc.) and help people opening paths full of learning and success. The female Exus are the Pomba Giras. Their action field is love, specially self love, but also romantic relationships; but under no circumstances will they perform black magic. Pomba Giras, like all Exus, undo black magic that exists in Quiumbanda. : 3. Bad Spirits/Kiumbas :: Some Umbanda believers avoid the spirits of this level, considered dark incarnations. Sometimes impure spirits can possess some psychics and cause many annoyances in a cult. So, priests and priestesses should know how to treat and send them to the correspondent evolved spiritual level which is connected to the Umbanda house, where they'll be cleansed by higher spirits, taught to find the light and evolve. So, the spirits of the city help during the process as much as the guides of the Umbanda psychics also help. The guides are responsible, in this case, for taking the darker spirits to the spiritual city and rebalancing the psychic. =Reincarnation= Reincarnation in Umbanda is different from in Hinduism. The Law of the Reincarnation is the central point of the Karmic Law. It states that Olodumare creates spirits with Self Will all the time. The spirits universally pass through many stages of evolution, in many planets. It also states that there are parallel dimensions in this world where the obsessive spirits are, since they can't evolve. They have the choice of being good or bad, through ordinary acts and the love that they display towards other people. When they \\"die\\", the good ones advance to a superior stage of spiritual evolution, in other planets. Those that do not succeed should reincarnate until learning what they were supposed to.  Umbanda temples, priests and priestesses  Umbanda temples are autonomous organizations that focus around a leader, mediums (psychics who are able to intermediate communications between the physical and the spiritual worlds), initiates (people with psychic abilities who are being taught in the ways of Umbanda) and lay members. During its first years, the Umbanda rituals were performed in poor suburban houses because the followers had no resources, and also to avoid police persecution, since not being catholic was cause for arrest. Most often, the leader's own house was used as a place for religious meetings. The rituals were performed in the backyard. Sometimes, a tent was pitched to protect the meeting from rain. Today, the Umbanda religious buildings are still called Terreiro (backyard) or Tenda (tent). When the religion flourished, buildings were specially constructed for ritual use. Tendas or Terreiros usually look like ordinary houses when seen from the street. Some religious artifacts like African styled ceramic vases can be put on the walls or ceilings to give a touch of religious appearance to the house. A wood board with the name of the temple usually is placed over the main entrance. Larger Umbanda houses often are laid out in a fashion similar to a humble Catholic church. Even when the Tenda or Terreiro is specially built to be used in Umbanda rituals, a separated part is used as the home of the leader and his or her family. The areas for residence and rituals are close enough to be considered a single unit. If a building is not available, rituals are still performed in a private backyard as well. Generally the Terreiro ‚Äì the actual room used for rituals ‚Äì is a large area covered by a simple roof of ceramic singles, with an altar at the back. The Tendas or Terreiros are also used directly or in a support capacity for charitable works to provide child care, medical clinics, assistance to orphanages, and distribution of medicines and/or food. The Terreiros have as their main leader a priest or priestess called \\"pai-de-santo\\" (\\"father-of-saint\\", if he is a male, referred to as \\"b√†b√°l√≥√≤r√¨s√†\\") or \\"m√£e-de-santo\\" (\\"mother-of-saint\\", if she is female, referred to as \\"y√°l√≥√≤r√¨s√†\\"). The initiates, men or women, are usually called \\"filhos-de-santo\\" (\\"children-of-saint\\", masculine plural form), to show the structure within the religion. This does not imply sainthood on the part of the priest or priestess, but responsibility for certain rituals related to each saint they serve, (also called Orix√°s), as well as the saints of the filhos-de-santo under his or her responsibility. Umbanda developed with almost no sexual discrimination. The leader could be male or female, pai-de-santo or m√£e-de-santo, and his or her prestige depends only on their psychic powers and the wisdom shown within their pieces of advice. Its main difference when compared to the Catholic Church is that in Umbanda, homosexuals face no prejudice, for Umbanda does not judge believers by sex, race or sexual orientation. Each Umbanda Terreiro practices the same religion with variations, according to the policies of the pai-de-santo's or the m√£e-de- santo's spiritual mentor, as well as in accordance with the teachings and philosophies of the various traditions within Umbanda. During these ceremonies, the priests, priestesses, and initiates wear white costumes and pay homage to the spirits and Orix√°s. Rituals and ceremonies One hundred years after its establishment, Umbanda is divided into several branches with different rituals and ceremonies. As the Terreiros de Umbanda are loosely united by the Umbanda federations, there is not a strong adherence to a single code of rite, ceremonies and creeds. The Umbanda Branca, the original form created by Z√©lio de Moraes and his group, adopts the worship of Orix√°s but rejects the black witchcraft, the colorful costumes, and the animal sacrifices practiced in the Macumba and Quimbanda rituals. The babalorix√°s (Pais-de- Santo) and the yalorix√°s (M√£es-de-Santo) always wear white outfits during the ceremonies of the Umbanda Branca. On the other hand, Umbanda d'Angola and Umbanda Jej√™ are newer sects with a body of rituals, ceremonies and philosophies that equate themselves with other religions such as Candombl√©, Jurema, and Catimb√≥. Another recent branch, called Umbanda Esot√©rica, is heavily influenced by Eastern philosophies. The older Terreiros de Umbanda, those established before 1940, have not integrated these new trends and still practice the original rites and ceremonies in a simpler way, specially dedicating themselves to charity works, as preached by Z√©lio de Moraes and his group. The gira or \\"work\\" Umbanda ceremonies are generally open to the public and may take place several times a week. Atabaque (conga drums) and chanting play a central role in some Umbanda congregations, but are almost non-existent in others. The ceremonies may include offers to the spirits comprising fruits, wine, farofa, cacha√ßa, popcorn, cigarettes, hard cider and other types of food or beverages. Each Orix√° or spirit receives a proper offering, and initiation rites that range from the simple to complex. During the ceremonies the priests and priestesses (pai-de-santo, m√£e-de-santo, filhos-de-santo, initiates) and the public attending the meeting sing together, dance, drink beverages and smoke cigars under the spirit's influence. However, the use of such elements by these spirits aren't due to any addictions - they are used as sacred elements that help the spirits to nullify any negative energies surrounding the assisted person. The priests and priestesses are separated from the attending public, usually by a small fence. The priests, priestesses and some of the public gradually get immersed in the singing and dancing, and suddenly get possessed by deities and spirits, starting to act and speak with their personas. Those in the public attending who become possessed are recognized as owners of special psychic power and, usually, after the ceremony, are invited to become initiates in the Terreiro. Sometimes, an experienced pai-de-santo or m√£e-de-santo can dance and sing all night without, for mysterious reasons, being possessed by deities or spirits. There is also a rite leader called Og√£. His job is to organize the \\"gira\\" in a logistic way. He does not incorporate and he is respected by the entities who possess the medium. Intervention by spiritual beings in followers' daily lives is a central belief, so participation in Umbanda rites is important to appease deities and spirits. Music and dancing are always present in the Umbanda rituals. The public sing together the \\"pontos\\", religious songs intended to improve the psychics' concentration level. These songs often are taught by the spirits themselves, and their lyrics tell about charity, faith, and the Orix√°s' deeds. The pontos should be sung or said in Portuguese for religious use. A ponto example is translated below: ::Ponto de Mam√£e Ox√∫m (Umbanda Song of Mommy Ox√∫m) :Water streams like crystal ::Through Father Olor√∫m's feet ::Father Olor√∫m created Nature ::And made the Waterfalls ::Which Xang√¥ blessed ::I am going to ask the permission of Oxal√° ::To bath in the waterfall ::To clean all evilUmbanda Ritual History = Historical background = Z√©lio de Moraes Umbanda originated in South America and developed in the Portuguese Empire. In the late-19th century, many Brazilian scholars criticized the African-Brazilian religions, claiming they were primitive and hindered modernization. At the same time, Allan Kardec's Spiritism, a development of spiritualism creeds, was increasingly accepted by the Brazilian urban middle/upper-class with followers since 1865. Since that Spiritism came from Paris, with the upper classes, there was no integration with the lower classes.Beraba, Marcelo. O Terreiro da Contradi√ß√£o. Folha de S.Paulo; March 30, 2008 The kardecists ‚Äì followers of the Spiritism ‚Äì were mainly middle-class people of European descent, many of them pursuing military and professional careers. They were deeply influenced by Auguste Comte's philosophy, Positivism, that aimed to join religion and science and to help the development of society to a higher level. = Beginning = On November 15, 1908, a group of kardecists met at a s√©ance in the neighborhood of Neves, S√£o Gon√ßalo city, near the Federal Capital, Rio de Janeiro. Among them was Z√©lio Fernandino de Moraes, a 17-year-old boy who was studying to join the Naval Academy and later became an officer. During the s√©ance, Z√©lio de Moraes incorporated a spirit who identified himself as the Caboclo das Sete Encruzilhadas (Half-Indian Peasant of the Seven Crossroads). After that, Z√©lio de Moraes incorporated another spirit who identified himself as Pai Ant√¥nio (Father Anthony), a wise old slave that had died after being savagely flogged by his master.Oliveira, J. Alves; Umbanda Crist√£ e Brasileira; 1985; apud Beraba = First years and the development = The first Terreiro de Umbanda was founded by Z√©lio de Moraes in an uncertain date of the 1920s and named Centro Esp√≠rita Nossa Senhora da Piedade (Spiritism Center of Our Lady of Mercy). In 1940 Z√©lio de Moraes made a statute for this first Terreiro that was used as reference by the most of Terreiros that followed. The Umbanda religion started in a time when the Brazilian society was passing through a strong transformation process. The predominance of agriculture in Brazilian economy was decreasing and the first steps of a late industrial revolution was expanding the working class. The American anthropologist Diana Brown, that pioneered the studies of Umbanda in the 1960s, verified that the Umbanda founders were most middle-class people.Brown, Diana; \\"Uma Hist√≥ria da Umbanda no Rio\\", 1985; apud Beraba The first Umbanda followers felt that the Macumba rituals were more stimulating and dramatic than the Spiritism s√©ances, but they rejected the animal sacrifices and the incorporation of malevolent spirits, often called Kiumbas (Obsessing Spirits). According to the anthropologist Diana Brown, Z√©lio de Moraes had just a symbolic participation in the creation of the Umbanda, acting like the speaker of a group that previously participated in Macumba cults. A collective effort was made by Z√©lio de Moraes and his group to promote the Umbanda Branca, developing practices acceptable by the middle class. Novo Preto Velho. Interview of Diana Brown in Folha de S.Paulo; March 30, 2008. = Expansion during Vargas dictatorship = The first stage of the Umbanda expansion coincides with the social and political changes that occurred in the 1930s and with the dictatorship of Get√∫lio Vargas (1930‚Äî1945). Get√∫lio Vargas became known as \\"pai dos pobres\\" (Father of the Poor) and, also, as \\"pai da Umbanda\\" (Father of the Umbanda) among the emergent urban and working class. Until 1966 many Umbanda Terreiros had a Get√∫lio Vargas picture in a place of honor. Despite the identification with the objectives of the Get√∫lio Vargas dictatorship, the Umbanda followers were persecuted. The police repression interrupted religious meetings, beat the psychics and followers and confiscated their instruments of Umbanda. An entire collection of icons, costumes, garbs, amulets, instruments, and objects of traditional religions confiscated by policemen is still kept in the Museu da Pol√≠cia (Museum of Police) in Rio de Janeiro city. A notable victim of the police repression was Euclydes Barbosa (1909‚Äî88). He was a great soccer back player known by the nickname Ja√∫, that played with the Corinthians team from 1932 to 1937 and with the Brazil's national team in 1938 World Cup in France. Ja√∫ was also a pai-de- santo or babalorix√°, priest of Umbanda, the founder of the Umbanda religion in S√£o Paulo city and one of the first organizers in the 1950s of the Yemanj√° feast in the S√£o Paulo State beaches. Ja√∫ was illegally imprisoned, beaten, tortured, and publicly humiliated by the police because of his religious activities. Some Umbanda leaders call him the great martyr of their religion. = Prime years after the Vargas dictatorship = In the latter half of the 20th century Umbanda grew rapidly among transformation of Candombl√© that was first noticed in Bahia.Troch, Lieve. Ecclesiogenesis: the patchwork of new religious communities in Brazil. Exchange 33, No. 1, 2004, pp. 54‚Äì72. The independent Terreiros of Umbanda started to unite themselves in federations to strengthen its position against social discrimination and police repression. The first federation was founded by Z√©lio Fernandino in 1939. The end of the Get√∫lio Vargas Dictatorship and the reestablishment of democracy in 1945 advanced the religion freedom environment. In 1953, two Umbanda federations were founded in S√£o Paulo. However, the Umbanda cults were still looked with suspicion by the Police Departments that demanded a compulsory registration of the Terreiros. Only in 1964, this obligation was released and just a civil registration in a public notary is required. The populist character of the politics in Brazil between 1945 (the end of Get√∫lio Vargas Dictatorship) and 1964 (the start of the Military Dictatorship) supported the expansion of Umbanda. Then politicians became usual attendants of the Terreiros, especially before the elections. Meanwhile, some non-Brazilian scholars, including French sociologist Roger Bastide, who from 1938 to 1957 was professor of Sociology at the University of S√£o Paulo, produced sympathetic accounts of Umbanda and defended its practitioners‚Äô rights to religious freedom. Bastide believed that Umbanda, unlike Candombl√©, had a bright future in Brazil and may eventually become a mainline religion.Marcio Goldman, ‚ÄúReading Roger Bastide: Deutero- learning the African Religions in Brazil,‚Äù √âtudes rurales 196 (2015), 9‚Äì24 (15). Research conducted by the anthropologists L√≠sias Nogueira Negr√£o and Maria Helena Concone revealed that in the 1940s in S√£o Paulo, just 58 religious organizations were registered as Umbanda Terreiros, but 803 organizations declared themselves as Spiritism Centers. In the 1950s, positions inverted: 1,025 organizations declared themselves as Umbanda Terreiros, 845 as Spiritism Centers and only one Candombl√© Terreiro. The apex was during the 1970s, with 7,627 Umbanda Terreiros, 856 Candombl√© Terreiros and 202 Spiritism Centers. The period from the 1950s to the 1970s was the prime of the Umbanda religion. Police repression decreased, the number of followers soared, but the Catholic Church opposition increased. An intense religious campaign against the Umbanda cults was conducted in the pulpits and the press. Umbanda received criticism from the Catholic Church, which disagreed with the worship of spirits and the comparison that many Umbandistas made between Catholic Saints and Orix√°s. Despite the criticism, even today, many Umbanda members also claim to be devout Catholics as well. After the Vatican Council II (1962‚Äì65), the Catholic Church sought an ecumenical or tolerant relation with traditional religions. = Opposition = In 1974 Umbanda practitioners (including declared and undeclared) were estimated to be about 30 million in a population of 120 million Brazilians. After the 1970s the Umbanda cults begun to be opposed by Pentecostals. Evangelical Pentecostal Churches have begun attempting to evangelize and, in some cases, persecute practitioners of Umbanda and other traditional religions. Umbanda practitioners have taken cases to national courts and achieved a high measure of success. In 2005 the Superior √ìrg√£o de Umbanda do Estado de S√£o Paulo (Superior Organization of Umbanda in S√£o Paulo State) won a judicial case in the Federal Court against the television broadcasting systems Rede Record and Rede Mulher, that belong to the Igreja Universal do Reino de Deus, a Neo Pentecostal Church. The Public Attorney (Minist√©rio P√∫blico) denounced television programs that treated the traditional religions in a derogatory and discriminating way. = Today = In the 2000 Brazilian census, 432,000 Brazilians declared themselves Umbandistas, a 20% drop in relation to the 1991 census. Many people attend the Terreiros of Umbanda seeking counseling or healing, but they do not consider themselves Umbandistas. Despite all the troubles in the past or present, the Umbanda remains strong and renovated in Brazilian main cities like Rio de Janeiro (the greatest concentration of Umbandists) and S√£o Paulo (the second greatest concentration of Umbandistas). After the 1970s, Porto Alegre, the capital of Rio Grande do Sul, the southernmost Brazilian state, became the base of expansion of the Umbanda to Argentina and Uruguay. Today, Umbanda followers can be found in the United States of America as well. The syncretic religious practice known as Santo Daime, founded in the 1930s by Raimundo Irineu Serra, has been incorporating elements of Umbanda in its rituals, especially in the line called ‚ÄúUmbandaime.‚Äù The use of ayahuasca is an important aspect of their ceremonies.

He worked in a wide variety of trades throughout his life and took part in the famous gunfight at the O.K. Corral, during which lawmen killed three outlaw Cochise County Cowboys. He is often erroneously regarded as the central figure in the shootout, although his brother Virgil was the Tombstone City and Deputy U.S. Marshal that day, and had far more experience in combat as a sheriff, constable, marshal, and soldier.Frontier Lawman Virgil Earp Earp was at different times a professional gambler, teamster, and buffalo hunter. Over his lifetime, he owned several saloons, maintained a brothel, mined for silver and gold, and refereed boxing matches. He spent his early life in Pella, Iowa. In 1870, he married Urilla Sutherland, who contracted typhoid fever and died in childbirth. During the next two years, Earp was arrested for stealing a horse, escaped from jail, and was sued twice. He was arrested and fined three times in 1872 for \\"keeping and being found in a house of ill-fame\\". His third arrest was described at length in the Daily Transcript, which referred to him as an \\"old offender\\" and nicknamed him the \\"Peoria Bummer,\\" another name for loafer or vagrant. By 1874, he arrived in the boomtown of Wichita, Kansas, where his reputed wife opened a brothel. On April 21, 1875, he was appointed to the Wichita police force and developed a solid reputation as a lawman, but he was fined and dismissed from the force after getting into a fistfight with a political opponent of his boss. Earp immediately left Wichita, following his brother James to Dodge City, Kansas, where he became an assistant city marshal. In the winter of 1878, he went to Texas to track down an outlaw, and he met John \\"Doc\\" Holliday, whom Earp credited with saving his life. Earp moved constantly throughout his life from one boomtown to another. He left Dodge City in 1879 and moved with brothers James and Virgil to Tombstone, where a silver boom was underway. The Earps clashed with an informal group of outlaws known as the \\"Cowboys.\\" Wyatt, Virgil, and younger brother Morgan held various law-enforcement positions which put them in conflict with Tom McLaury, Frank McLaury, Ike Clanton, and Billy Clanton who threatened to kill the Earps on several occasions. The conflict escalated over the next year, culminating in the shootout at the O.K. Corral on October 26, 1881, where the Earps and Doc Holliday killed three Cowboys. During the next five months, Virgil was ambushed and maimed, and Morgan was assassinated. Wyatt, Warren Earp, Doc Holliday, and others formed a federal posse which killed three more Cowboys whom they thought responsible. Wyatt was never wounded in any of the gunfights, unlike his brothers Virgil and Morgan or his friend Doc Holliday, which only added to his mystique after his death. As a lifelong gambler Earp was always looking for a quick way to make money. After leaving Tombstone, he went to San Francisco where he reunited with Josephine Marcus, and she became his common-law wife. They joined a gold rush to Eagle City, Idaho, where they owned mining interests and a saloon. They left to race horses and open a saloon during a real estate boom in San Diego, California. Back in San Francisco, Wyatt raced horses again, but his reputation suffered irreparably when he refereed the Fitzsimmons vs. Sharkey boxing match and called a foul which led many to believe that he fixed the fight. They moved briefly to Yuma, Arizona, before joining the Nome Gold Rush in 1899. He and Charlie Hoxie paid $1,500 (about $ today) for a liquor license to open a two-story saloon called the Dexter and made an estimated $80,000 (or about $ today). The couple left Alaska and opened another saloon in Tonopah, Nevada, the site of a new gold find. Around 1911, Earp began working several mining claims in Vidal, California, retiring in the hot summers with Josephine to Los Angeles. He made friends among early Western actors in Hollywood and tried to get his story told, but he was portrayed only very briefly in one film produced during his lifetime: Wild Bill Hickok (1923). Earp died on January 13, 1929. Known as a Western lawman, gunfighter, and boxing referee, he had a notorious reputation for his handling of the Fitzsimmons‚ÄìSharkey fight and his role in the O.K. Corral gunfight. This began to change only after his death when the extremely flattering biography Wyatt Earp: Frontier Marshal was published in 1931, becoming a bestseller and creating his reputation as a fearless lawman. Since then, Earp has been the subject of numerous films, television shows, biographies, and works of fiction which have increased his fame and his notoriety. Long after his death, he has many devoted detractors and admirers. His modern-day reputation is that of the Old West's toughest and deadliest gunman.  Early life  Wyatt Earp w. mother Virginia Ann Cooksey Earp c. 1856\\\\. Wyatt Berry Stapp Earp was born on March 19, 1848, the fourth child of Nicholas Porter Earp and his second wife, Virginia Ann Cooksey. He was named after his father's commanding officer in the Mexican‚ÄìAmerican War, Captain Wyatt Berry Stapp, of the 2nd Company Illinois Mounted Volunteers. Some evidence supports Wyatt Earp's birthplace as 406 S. 3rd St. in Monmouth, Illinois, though the street address is disputed by Monmouth College professor and historian William Urban. Wyatt had seven full siblings ‚Äî James, Virgil, Martha, Morgan, Baxter Warren, Virginia, and Adelia ‚Äî as well as an elder half-brother, Newton, from his father's first marriage. In March 1849 or in early 1850, Nicholas Earp joined about 100 other people in a plan to relocate to San Bernardino County, California, where he intended to buy farmland. Just west of Monmouth on the journey, their daughter Martha became ill. The family stopped and Nicholas bought a new farm northeast of Pella, Iowa. Martha died there on May 26, 1856. Earp's boyhood home in Pella, Iowa. Nicholas and Virginia Earp's last child, Adelia, was born in June 1861 in Pella. Newton, James, and Virgil joined the Union Army on November 11, 1861. Their father was busy recruiting and drilling local companies, so Wyatt and his two younger brothers, Morgan and Warren, were left in charge of tending of corn. Wyatt was only 13 years old, too young to enlist, but he tried on several occasions to run away and join the army. Each time, his father found him and brought him home. James was severely wounded in Fredericktown, Missouri, and returned home in summer 1863. Newton and Virgil fought several battles in the East and later followed the family to California. = California = Looking east from D St. toward 3rd St. in downtown San Bernardino in 1864. On May 12, 1864, Nicholas Earp organized a wagon train and headed to San Bernardino, California, arriving on December 17. By late summer 1865, Virgil found work as a driver for Phineas Banning's stage coach line in California's Imperial Valley, and 16 year-old Wyatt assisted. In spring 1866, Wyatt became a teamster transporting cargo for Chris Taylor. From 1866-68, he drove cargo over wagon road from Wilmington through San Bernardino, then Las Vegas, Nevada, to Salt Lake City, Utah Territory. In spring 1868, Earp was hired to transport supplies needed to build the Union Pacific Railroad. He learned gambling and boxing while working on the rail head in the Wyoming Territory. He developed a reputation officiating boxing matches and refereed a fight between John Shanssey and Prof. Mike Donovan on July 4, 1869, in Cheyenne, Wyoming, in front of 3,000 spectators. = Lawman and marriage = Wyatt Earp, age 21 in 1869 or '70, while married to Urilla Sutherland; taken in Lamar, Missouri. In spring of 1868, the Earps moved east again to Lamar, Missouri, where Wyatt's father Nicholas became the local constable. Wyatt rejoined the family the next year. Nicholas resigned as constable on November 17, 1869, to become the Justice of the Peace. Wyatt was appointed constable in his place. Urilla Sutherland, who married Earp on January 10, 1870. In late 1869, Earp courted 20 year-old Urilla Sutherland (‚Äì70), daughter of William and Permelia Sutherland who operated the Exchange Hotel in Lamar. They were married by Earp's father on January 10, 1870. Wyatt bought a lot on the outskirts of town for $50 where he built a house in August 1870. Urilla was about to deliver their first child when she suddenly died from typhoid fever. In November, Earp sold the lot and house for $75. He ran against his elder half-brother Newton for the office of constable and won by 137 votes to Newton's 108, but their father lost the election for Justice of the Peace in a very close four-way race. = Lawsuits and charges = Lamar, Missouri, subpoena signed by Constable Wyatt Earp, February 28, 1870. Earp went through a downward spiral after Urilla's death, and he had a series of legal problems. On March 14, 1871, Barton County, Missouri, filed a lawsuit against him and his sureties. He was in charge of collecting license fees for Lamar which funded local schools, and he was accused of failing to turn them in. On March 31, James Cromwell filed a lawsuit against him alleging that he had falsified court documents concerning the amount of money that Earp had collected from Cromwell to satisfy a judgment. The court seized Cromwell's mowing machine and sold it for $38 to make up the difference between what Earp turned in and what Cromwell owed. Cromwell's suit claimed that Earp owed him $75, est. value of the machine. Earp, Edward Kennedy, and John Shown were charged with stealing two horses on March 28, 1871, from William Keys while in the Indian country, \\"each of the value of $100.\\" On April 6, Deputy U.S. Marshal J. G. Owens arrested Earp for the horse theft, and Commissioner James Churchill arraigned him on April 14 and set bail at $500. On May 15, an indictment was issued against Earp, Kennedy, and Shown. John Shown's wife Anna claimed that Earp and Kennedy got her husband drunk and then threatened his life to persuade him to help. On June 5, Kennedy was acquitted while the case remained against Earp and Shown. Earp did not wait for the trial but climbed out through the roof of his jail and headed for Peoria, Illinois. =Arrests in Peoria= Earp was listed in the Peoria city directory during 1872 as a resident in the home of Jane Haspel, although Stuart N. Lake took notes of a conversation with Earp years later in which Earp claimed that he'd been hunting buffalo during the winter of 1871‚Äì72. Peoria police raided Haspel's home in February 1872 arresting four women, Wyatt and Morgan Earp, and George Randall. The men were charged with \\"keeping and being found in a house of ill- fame,\\" and later fined $20+ costs. Both Earps were arrested for the same crime again on May 11, and each was fined $44.55. The Peoria Daily National Democrat reported that Earp had been arrested once more on September 10, 1872, and this time he was aboard a floating brothel that he owned named the Beardstown Gunboat. A prostitute named Sally Heckell was arrested with him, and she called herself his wife; she was likely the 16 year-old daughter of Jane Haspel. By calling Earp the \\"Peoria Bummer,\\" the newspaper was putting him in a class of \\"contemptible loafers who impose on hard-working citizens,\\" a \\"beggar\\" and worse than tramps. They were men of poor character who were chronic lawbreakers, and Peoria constables probably considered him to be a pimp.Wyatt Earp's Lost Year History.netWas Wyatt Earp a Pimp? True West Earp wrote Lake many years later that he \\"arrived in Wichita direct from my buffalo hunt in '74\\", so he may have hunted buffalo between 1873 and 1874, although there's no evidence that he ever did so. = Wichita, Kansas = faro at the Long Branch Saloon in Dodge City, Kansas. In early 1874, Earp and Sally moved to the growing cow town of Wichita where his brother James ran a brothel. Local arrest records show that Sally and James' wife Nellie \\"Bessie\\" Ketchum operated a brothel there from early 1874 to the middle of 1876. Wyatt may have been a pimp, but historian Robert Gary L. Roberts believes that he was more likely an enforcer or a bouncer for the brothel. When the Kansas state census was completed in June 1875, Sally was no longer living with Wyatt, James, and Bessie. Wichita was a railroad terminal and a destination for cattle drives from Texas. The town would fill with drunken, armed cowboys celebrating the end of their long journey when the cattle drives arrived, and lawmen were kept busy. When the cattle drives ended and the cowboys left, Earp searched for something else to do. The Wichita City Eagle reported on October 29, 1874, that he had helped an off-duty police officer find thieves who had stolen a man's wagon. Earp officially joined the Wichita marshal's office on April 21, 1875, after the election of Mike Meagher as city marshal (or police chief), making $100 per month. He also dealt faro at the Long Branch Saloon. In late 1875, the Wichita Beacon published this story: Earp was embarrassed on January 9, 1876, when he was sitting with friends in the back room of the Custom House Saloon and his single-action revolver fell out of its holster and discharged when the hammer hit the floor. \\"The ball passed through his coat, struck the north wall then glanced off and passed out through the ceiling.\\" He persuaded biographer Stuart N. Lake years later to omit it from his book Wyatt Earp: Frontier Marshal. Earp's stint as Wichita deputy came to a sudden end on April 2, 1876, when former marshal Bill Smith accused him of using his office to help hire his brothers as lawmen. Earp beat Smith in a fist-fight and was fined $30. The local newspaper reported, \\"It is but justice to Earp to say he has made an excellent officer.\\" Meagher won the election, but the city council voted against rehiring Earp. His brother James opened a brothel in Dodge City, and Earp left Wichita to join him. = Dodge City and Deadwood = Interior of Long Branch Saloon in Dodge City, Kansas, 1870-85. Deputies Bat Masterson (standing) and Wyatt Earp in Dodge City, 1876. The scroll on Earp's chest is a cloth pin-on badge. After 1875, Dodge City, Kansas, became a major terminal for cattle drives from Texas along the Chisholm Trail. Earp was appointed assistant marshal in Dodge City under Marshal Lawrence Deger around May 1876, and he spent the winter of 1876‚Äì77 in the gold rush boomtown of Deadwood in the Dakota Territory. He and Morgan left Dodge for Deadwood on September 9, 1876, with a team of horses, but they arrived there to find that all the land was already tied up in mining claims, so Morgan decided to return to Dodge. Instead of gambling, Wyatt made a deal to buy all the wood that a local individual had cut and put his horses to work that winter hauling firewood into camp. He made about $5,000 in profit but was unable to file any mining claims, so he returned to Dodge City in the spring.Guern, Jeannine Wyatt Earp spent a winter in Deadwood Wyatt's second wife, Mattie Blaylock Deadwood in 1876 from a nearby hill. He rejoined the Dodge City police in spring 1877 at the request of Mayor James H. Kelley. The Dodge City newspaper reported in July 1878 that he'd been fined $1.00 for slapping a muscular prostitute named Frankie Bell, who \\"heaped epithets upon the unoffending head of Mr. Earp to such an extent as to provide a slap from the ex-officer,\\" according to the account. Bell spent the night in jail and was fined $20, while Earp's fine was the legal minimum. In Oct. 1877, outlaw Dave Rudabaugh robbed a Sante Fe Railroad construction camp and fled south. Earp was given a temporary commission as deputy U.S. Marshal and left Dodge City, following Rudabaugh over through Fort Clark, Texas, where the newspaper reported his presence on January 22, 1878, and on to Fort Griffin, Texas. He arrived at the frontier town on the Clear Fork of the Brazos River and went to the Bee Hive Saloon, the largest in town and owned by John Shanssey, whom Earp had known since he was 21. Shanssey told Earp that Rudabaugh had passed through town earlier in the week, but didn't know where he was headed. Shanssey suggested that Earp ask gambler Doc Holliday, who played cards with Rudabaugh. Doc told Earp that Rudabaugh was headed back into Kansas. By May 11, 1878, the Dodge newspapers reported that Earp had returned. The Dodge City Times noted on May 14 that he'd been appointed Assistant Marshal for $75 per month, serving under Charlie Bassett. Doc Holliday also showed up in Dodge City with his common-law wife Big Nose Kate during the summer of 1878. Ed Morrison and another two dozen cowboys rode into Dodge that summer and shot up the town, galloping down Front Street. They entered the Long Branch Saloon, vandalized and harassed the customers. Hearing the commotion, Earp burst through the front door to find numerous guns pointing at him; another version of the story has it that only 3:5 cowboys were there. In both versions, Holliday was playing cards in the back and he put his pistol at Morrison's head, forcing him and his men to disarm. Earp credited Holliday with saving his life that day, and the two became friends since. From Turner, Alford (Ed.), The O. K. Corral Inquest (1992) While in Dodge City, Earp became acquainted with James and Bat Masterson, Luke Short, and prostitute Mattie Blaylock, who became his common- law wife until 1881. = George Hoyt shooting = George Hoyt (spelled sometimes as \\"Hoy\\") and other drunken cowboys shot their guns wildly at about 3 AM on July 26, 1878, including three shots into Dodge City's Comique Theater, causing comedian Eddie Foy, Sr. to throw himself to the stage floor in the middle of his act. Fortunately, no one was injured. Assistant Marshal Earp and policeman Bat Masterson responded, along with several citizens, and opened fire with their pistols at the fleeing horsemen. The riders crossed the Arkansas River bridge south of town but Hoyt fell from his horse, wounded in the arm or leg. Earp later told biographer Stuart Lake that he saw Hoyt through his gun sights, illuminated against the morning horizon, and he fired a fatal shot which killed him that day; but the Dodge City Times reported that Hoyt developed gangrene and died on August 21 after his leg was amputated.  Move to Tombstone, Arizona  Tombstone in 1881 Dodge City had been a frontier cowtown for several years, but by 1879 it had begun to settle down. Virgil Earp was the town constable in Prescott, Arizona Territory, and he wrote to Wyatt about the opportunities in the silver-mining boomtown of Tombstone. He later wrote, \\"In 1879, Dodge was beginning to lose much of the snap which had given it a charm to men of reckless blood, and I decided to move to Tombstone, which was just building up a reputation.\\" Earp resigned from the Dodge City police force on September 9, 1879, and traveled to Las Vegas in New Mexico Territory with his common-law wife Mattie, his brother Jim, and Jim's wife Bessie. There they reunited with Doc Holliday and his common-law wife Big Nose Kate, and the six of them went on to Prescott, Arizona Territory. Virgil was appointed deputy U.S. marshal for the Tombstone mining district on November 27, 1879, three days before they left for Tombstone, by U.S. Marshal for the Arizona Territory Crawley P. Dake. Virgil was to operate out of Tombstone, some from Prescott, and his territory included the entire southeast area of the Arizona Territory. Wyatt, Virgil, and James Earp arrived in Tombstone with their wives on December 1, 1879, while Doc Holliday remained in Prescott where the gambling afforded better opportunities. The city of Tombstone was founded on March 5, 1879, with about 100 people living in tents and a few shacks. The Earps arrived nine months later on December 1, and it had already grown to about 1,000 residents. Wyatt brought horses and a buckboard wagon which he planned to convert into a stagecoach, but he found two established stage lines already running. He later said that he made most of his money in Tombstone as a professional gambler. The three Earps and Robert J. Winders filed a location notice on December 6, 1879, for the First North Extension of the Mountain Maid Mine. They also bought an interest in the Vizina mine and some water rights. Jim worked as a barkeep, but none of their other business interests proved fruitful. Wyatt was hired in April or May 1880 by Wells Fargo agent Fred J. Dodge as a shotgun messenger on stagecoaches when they transported Wells Fargo strongboxes. In late July 1880, younger brother Morgan arrived, leaving his wife Lou in Temescal, California (near San Bernardino). Warren Earp moved to Tombstone, as well. Doc Holliday arrived from Prescott in September with $40,000 (about $ today) in gambling winnings in his pocket. = First confrontation with the outlaw Cowboys = On July 25, 1880, Army Captain Joseph H. Hurst asked Deputy U.S. Marshal Virgil Earp to assist him in tracking outlaw Cowboys who had stolen six Army mules from Fort Rucker, Arizona. Virgil requested the assistance of his brothers Wyatt and Morgan, along with Wells Fargo agent Marshall Williams, and they found the mules at the McLaurys' ranch. (McLaury was a Cowboy, a term which was generally used in that region to refer to a loose association of outlaws, some of whom also were land-owners and ranchers. Legitimate cowmen were referred to as cattle herders or ranchers.) They also found a branding iron which the Cowboys had used to change the \\"U.S.\\" brand into \\"D.8.\\" Stealing the mules was a federal offense because the animals were government property. Cowboy Frank Patterson made an agreement with Captain Hurst, and Hurst persuaded the posse to withdraw with the understanding that the mules would be returned. The Cowboys showed up two days later without the mules and laughed at Hurst and the Earps. In response, Hurst printed a handbill describing the theft, and he charged McLaury with hiding the mules. He also reproduced the handbill in The Tombstone Epitaph on July 30, 1880. McLaury angrily printed a response in the Cowboy-friendly Nuggett, calling Hurst \\"unmanly\\", \\"a coward, a vagabond, a rascal, and a malicious liar\\", and accusing him of stealing the mules himself. Hurst later cautioned the Earp brothers that the Cowboys had threatened their lives. Virgil reported that McLaury accosted him and said, \\"If you ever again follow us as close as you did, then you will have to fight anyway.\\" A month later, Earp ran into Frank and Tom McLaury in Charleston, and they told him that they would kill him if he ever followed them as he had done before. =Becomes deputy sheriff= County Sheriff Charles A. Shibell appointed Virgil Earp as deputy sheriff for the eastern part of Pima County, Arizona, on July 28, 1880, which included Tombstone.Note: The sheriff's position was worth more than $40,000 a year (about $ today) because he was also county assessor and tax collector, and the board of supervisors allowed him to keep 10% of the amounts paid; see Wyatt, appointed a deputy by his brother, then passed his Wells Fargo job as shotgun messenger to his brother Morgan. Wyatt did his job well, and his name was mentioned nearly every week from August through November in The Tombstone Epitaph or the Nugget newspapers. =Town marshal shot= On October 28, 1880, Tombstone town marshal Fred White attempted to break up a group of five late-night, drunken revelers shooting at the moon on Allen Street. Deputy Sheriff Earp was in Owens Saloon a block away, though unarmed. Morgan and Fred Dodge were in a cabin nearby. Wyatt heard the shooting and ran to the scene. He borrowed a pistol from Fred Dodge and went to assist White. As he approached White, he saw White attempt to disarm Curly Bill Brocius and the gun discharged, striking White in the groin. Throughout the shooting Earp was standing by a chimney that was struck repeatedly by gunfire. He buffaloed Brocius, knocking him to the ground, then he grabbed Brocius by the collar and told him to get up. Brocius asked, \\"What have I done?\\" Fred Dodge recalled in a letter he wrote to Stuart Lake in 1928 what he had witnessed: Earp altered his story later on, telling John H. Flood Jr. that he did not see Brocius's pistol on the ground in the dark until afterward. The pistol contained one expended cartridge and five live rounds. Brocius waived a preliminary hearing so that his case could be transferred to Tucson District Court, and Virgil and Wyatt escorted him to Tucson to stand trial‚Äîpossibly saving him from a lynching. White, age 31, died of his wound two days after his shooting. On December 27, 1880, Earp testified that White's shooting was accidental. Brocius expressed regret, saying that he had not intended to shoot White. Gunsmith Jacob Gruber testified that Brocius's single-action revolver was defective, allowing it to be discharged at half-cock. A statement was introduced which White had made, stating that the shooting was accidental. The judge ruled that the shooting was accidental and released Brocius. Brocius, however, remained intensely angry about how Earp had pistol-whipped him, and he became an enemy to the Earps. = Shibell election = On November 2, 1880, Shibell unexpectedly won the election by a margin of 58 votes under suspicious circumstances. James C. Hancock reported that Cowboys Curly Bill Brocius and Johnny Ringo had served as election officials in the San Simon precinct, although biographer David Johnson places Ringo in New Mexico with Ike Clanton on November 1, the day before the election. Curly Bill had been arrested and jailed in Tucson on October 28 for shooting Marshal White, and he was still there on election day. The home of John Magill was used as the polling place. The precinct only contained about 10 eligible voters (another source says 50), but the Cowboys gathered non-voters such as the children and Chinese and had them cast ballots. They then gave names to all the dogs, donkeys, and poultry and cast ballots in their names for Shibell. Precinct 27 in the San Simon Valley in northern Cochise County, turned out 104 votes, 103 of them for Shibell. The election board met on November 14 and declared Shibell the winner. Paul filed a lawsuit on November 19 contesting the election results, alleging that Shibell's Cowboy supporters Ike Clanton, Curly Bill Brocius, and Frank McLaury had conspired in ballot stuffing. In late January 1881, Chief Justice of Arizona C. G. W. French ruled in Paul's favor, but Shibell appealed. A recount found that Paul had 402 votes and Shibell had 354. In April 1881 when the election commission found that a mysterious \\"Henry Johnson\\" was responsible for certifying the ballots. This turned out to be the same James K. Johnson who had been shooting up Allen Street the night when Marshal White was killed. Moreover, he had testified at Curly Bill's preliminary hearing after he shot Fred White. Johnson later testified in the election hearing and said that the ballots had been left in the care of Ike Clanton's brother Phineas. None of the witnesses during the election hearing reported on ballots being cast by dogs. Paul was declared the winner of the Pima County sheriff election. However, the election was a moot point by then, as Paul could not replace Behan with Earp because Cochise County was created out of the eastern portion of Pima County on January 1, 1881. = Earp loses reappointment = Earp served as deputy sheriff for eastern Pima County for only three months because Democrat Shibell ran for re-election against Republican challenger Robert H. Paul in November. The region was strongly Republican and Paul was expected to win. Earp was a Republican and expected that he would continue in the job. Given how fast eastern Pima County was growing, many expected that it would be split off into its own county soon with Tombstone as its seat, and Earp hoped to win the job as the new county's sheriff and continue receiving the 10% of all tax money collected. Southern Pacific was the major landholder, so tax collection was a relatively easy process. In 1882, the Cochise County sheriff earned $24,010.52 (or about $ today) in fees. Earp resigned from the sheriff's office on November 9, 1880, and Shibell immediately appointed Johnny Behan as the new deputy sheriff for eastern Pima County. Behan had considerably more political experience than Earp, as he had served as Yavapai County sheriff from 1871 to 1873. He had been elected to the Arizona Territorial Legislature twice, representing Yavapai Country in the 7th Territorial Legislature in 1873 and Mohave County in the 10th in 1879. Behan moved to the northwest Arizona Territory, where he served as the Mohave County recorder in 1877 and then deputy sheriff of Mohave County at Gillet in 1879. = Behan wins election = Earp and Behan applied for the new position of Cochise County sheriff, which paid the office holder 10% of the fees and taxes collected, as did the Pima County sheriff job. Earp thought that he had a good chance to win because he was the former undersheriff in the region and a Republican, like Arizona Territorial Governor John C. Fremont. However, Behan had greater political experience and influence in Prescott. Earp later testified at the O.K. Corral hearing that he and Behan had made a deal. He said that Behan and he agreed that, if Earp withdrew his application, Behan would appoint him as undersheriff. Behan received the appointment in February 1881, but he did not keep his end of the bargain and instead chose Harry Woods as undersheriff, who was a prominent Democrat. Behan testified at first that he had not made any deal with Earp, although he later admitted that he had lied. He said that he broke his promise to Earp because of an incident which occurred shortly before his appointment when Earp learned that Ike and Billy Clanton had one of his prize horses which had been stolen more than a year before. Earp and Holliday rode to the Clanton ranch near Charleston to recover the horse and overtook Behan along the way, who was riding in a wagon. Behan also was heading to the ranch to serve an electioneering subpoena on Ike Clanton. From Turner, Alford (Ed.), The O. K. Corral Inquest (1992) Accounts differ as to what happened next, but Earp testified that Billy Clanton gave up the horse when Earp arrived at the ranch, even before being presented with ownership papers. According to Behan's testimony, however, Earp had told the Clantons that Behan was on his way to arrest them for horse theft. The incident embarrassed the Clantons and Behan, and Behan later testified that he did not want to work with Earp and chose Woods instead. = Relationship with Sadie Marcus = Josephine Sarah Marcus, who left a relationship with Johnny Behan and took up with Wyatt Earp Later in life, Josephine Sarah Marcus aggressively protected her and Wyatt's history while in Tombstone. Marcus was deliberately vague about this period, causing modern researchers to question what she was hiding. She said that she first visited Tombstone as part of the Pauline Markham Theater Troupe on December 1, 1879, for a one-week engagement, but modern researchers have not found any record that she was ever part of the theater company. The many contradictions in her story have led to considerable speculation about her past. Researchers have identified two women with similar names in the same region of the Arizona Territory whose lives bear many striking parallels. Sadie Mansfield and Sadie Marcus were known by their friends as Sadie. Both made a stagecoach journey from San Francisco to Prescott, Arizona Territory; both traveled with a black woman named Julia; both were sexual partners with Behan; both were 19 years old, born in New York City, and had parents from Prussia. The only difference noted in the 1880 census is in their occupations: the Sadie who lived in San Francisco is listed as \\"At home\\", while the Sadie in Tip Top is recorded as a \\"Courtesan\\". Josephine said that her parents hid her activities, and they may have been covering for her when the census taker was a neighbor who knew the family. Behan owned a saloon in Tip Top, Arizona, where he maintained a prostitute named Sadie Mansfield, and he moved to Tombstone in September 1880. \\"Sadie\\" was a popular nickname for \\"Sarah\\", and prostitutes commonly changed their first names. Sadie Mansfield, the TipTop prostitute, may have returned to San Francisco and then rejoined Behan in Tombstone in September 1880 as Sadie Marcus, where they continued their relationship. In spring 1881, Sadie found Behan in bed with the wife of a friend and kicked him out, although she still used the Behan surname through the end of that summer. Earp had a common-law relationship with Mattie Blaylock. Modern researchers have found her listed as Earp's wife in the June 1880 census. She suffered from severe headaches and became addicted to laudanum, a commonly used opiate and painkiller, and later committed suicide. When Marcus learned that Stuart Lake had discovered the existence of Blaylock, she successfully demanded that he omit her from his book I Married Wyatt Earp. After Marcus arrived in Tombstone with Behan, Earp apparently developed an interest in her, although there are no records in Tombstone of a relationship between Josephine and Earp. Tombstone diarist George W. Parsons never mentioned seeing Wyatt and Josephine together and neither did John Clum in his memoirs. But Earp and Marcus certainly knew each other, as Behan and Earp had offices above the Crystal Palace Saloon. In April 1882, shortly after leaving Tombstone following the Earp Vendetta Ride, there is evidence that Earp had feelings for Marcus. The Earp posse went to Albuquerque, New Mexico, for two weeks. Wyatt and Holliday had been fast friends since Holliday saved Earp's life in Dodge City during 1878. Wyatt was staying with prominent businessman Henry N. Jaffa, who was also president of New Albuquerque's Board of Trade. Like Josephine, Jaffa was Jewish. During their stay in Albuquerque, the two men ate at the Retreat Restaurant owned by \\"Fat Charlie\\". Former New Mexico Territory Governor Miguel Otero described in a letter he wrote in 1940 an incident that indicates Earp's feelings for Marcus. He wrote, \\"Holliday said something about Earp becoming 'a damn Jew-boy.' Earp became angry and left‚Ä¶. [Henry] Jaffa told me later that Earp's woman was a Jewess. Earp did mezuzah when entering the house.\\" Earp's anger at Holliday's ethnic slur may indicate that his feelings for Josephine were more serious at the time than is commonly known. The information in the letter is compelling because at that time in the 1940s, the possibility of a prior relationship between Wyatt Earp and Josephine Marcus while in Tombstone was unknown. Otero could know these things only if he had a relationship with someone who had personal knowledge of the people involved. Marcus went to great lengths to sanitize her own and Wyatt's history. For example, she worked hard to keep her name and the name of Wyatt's second wife Mattie out of Stuart Lake's 1931 book, Wyatt Earp: Frontier Marshal, and Marcus threatened litigation to keep it that way. Marcus also told Earp's biographers and others that Earp never drank, did not own gambling saloons, and that he never provided prostitutes to customers, although strong evidence to the contrary exists. = Interest in mining and gambling = Business card for Tombstone's Oriental Saloon with the names of \\"W. Erp\\", \\"R. B. Clark\\", and \\"L. Rickenbaugh\\" Losing the undersheriff position left Earp without a job in Tombstone; however, he and his brothers were beginning to make some money on their mining claims in the Tombstone area. In January 1881, Oriental Saloon owner Mike Joyce gave Earp a 25-percent interest in the faro concession at the Oriental Saloon in exchange for his services as a manager and enforcer. Gambling was regarded as a legitimate profession at the time. Earp invited his friend Bat Masterson to Tombstone to help him run the faro tables in the saloon, and he telegraphed Luke Short in June 1881 to offer him a job as a faro dealer. Masterson remained until April 1881, when he returned to Dodge City to assist his brother Jim. = Facing down a lynch mob = Michael O'Rourke killed Henry Schneider, chief engineer of the Tombstone Mining and Milling Company, and said that it was in self defense. Schneider was well liked, and a mob of miners quickly gathered and threatened to lynch O'Rourke on the spot. Lake's biography describes Earp single-handedly dispersing the mob, but the Epitaph gave primary credit to Ben Sippy for calming the crowd, assisted by Virgil Earp, Wyatt Earp and Johnny Behan. Nevertheless, Lake's account added to Earp's modern legend as a lawman. = Stagecoach robbers kill two = Tensions increased between the Earps and both the Clantons and McLaurys through 1881. Three cowboys attempted to rob a Kinnear & Company stagecoach on March 15, 1881, at 10 pm, which was reportedly carrying $26,000 in silver bullion (about $ in today's dollars). The amount of bullion which the stagecoach actually carried is questioned by modern researchers, who note that the bullion would have weighed about , since the value of silver at the time was $1 an ounce‚Äîa significant weight for a team of horses. According to Wells Fargo agent John Q. Jackson, a stagecoach typically carried an Express Box containing bullion weighing only .History of the Stage Coach in the West The holdup took place near Benson, during which the robbers killed driver Eli \\"Budd\\" Philpot and passenger Peter Roerig. The Earps and a posse tracked the men down and arrested Luther King, who confessed that he had been holding the reins while Bill Leonard, Harry \\"The Kid\\" Head, and Jim Crain robbed the stage. They arrested King, and Sheriff Johnny Behan escorted him to jail, but somehow King walked in the front door and out the back door. During the hearing into the gunfight at the O.K. Corral, Wyatt testified that he offered Ike Clanton and Frank McLaury the $3,600 in Wells Fargo reward money ($1,200 per robber) in return for information about the identities of the three robbers. He testified that he had other motives for his plan, as well: he hoped that arresting the murderers would boost his chances for election as Cochise County sheriff. He told the court that he had taken the extra step of obtaining a second copy of a telegram for Clanton from Wells Fargo, ensuring that the reward applied for capturing the killers dead or alive. According to testimony given by Wyatt and Virgil, both McLaury and Clanton agreed to provide information to assist in capturing Leonard, Head, and Crain, but they never had a chance to fulfill the agreement. All three suspects were killed when attempting other robberies. From Turner, Alford (Ed.), The O. K. Corral Inquest (1992) In his testimony at the court hearing, Clanton said that Earp did not want to capture the men but to kill them. He told the court that Earp wanted to conceal his family's involvement in the Benson stage robbery and had sworn him to secrecy, and that Morgan Earp had confided in him that he and Wyatt had \\"piped off $1,400 to Doc Holliday and Bill Leonard\\", who were supposed to be on the stage the night when Bud Philpot was killed. Clanton told the court, \\"I was not going to have anything to do with helping to capture‚Äî\\" and then he corrected himself \\"‚Äîkill Bill Leonard, Crane, and Harry Head\\". Clanton denied having any knowledge of the Wells Fargo telegram confirming the reward money. From Turner, Alford (Ed.), The O. K. Corral Inquest (1992) = September stagecoach robbery = Meanwhile, tensions increased between the Earps and the McLaurys when Cowboys robbed the passenger stage on the Sandy Bob Line in the Tombstone area on September 8, bound for nearby Bisbee, Arizona. The masked robbers robbed the passengers and the strongbox, but they were recognized by their voices and language. They were identified as Deputy Sheriff Pete Spence (an alias for Elliot Larkin Ferguson) and Deputy Sheriff Frank Stilwell, a business partner of Spence's. Stilwell was fired a short while later as a deputy sheriff for Sheriff Behan (for county tax \\"accounting irregularities\\"). Wyatt and Virgil Earp rode with the sheriff's posse to track the stage robbers, and Wyatt discovered an unusual boot heel print in the mud. The posse checked with a shoemaker in Bisbee and found a matching heel that he had just removed from Stilwell's boot. A further check of a Bisbee corral turned up both Spence and Stilwell, who were arrested by sheriff's deputies Billy Breakenridge and Nagel. Spence and Stilwell were arraigned on the robbery charges before Justice Wells Spicer, who set their bail at $7,000 each. They were released after paying the bail, but they were rearrested by Virgil for the Bisbee robbery a month later on October 13 on the new federal charge of interfering with a mail carrier. The newspapers, however, reported that they had been arrested for a different stage robbery which occurred on October 8 near Contention City, Arizona, less than two weeks before the O.K. Corral shootout, and this final incident may have been misunderstood by the McLaurys. Wyatt and Virgil were still out of town for the Spence and Stilwell hearing when Frank McLaury confronted Morgan Earp, telling him that the McLaurys would kill the Earps if they tried to arrest Spence, Stilwell, or the McLaurys again.  Gunfight on Fremont Street  The tension came to a head between the Earps and the Cowboys on Wednesday, October 26, 1881. Ike Clanton, Billy Claiborne, and other Cowboys had been threatening to kill the Earps for several weeks, and Tombstone city Marshal Virgil Earp learned that they were armed and had gathered near the O.K. Corral. He asked Wyatt and Morgan Earp and Doc Holliday to assist him, as he intended to disarm them. Wyatt had been deputized by Virgil a few days prior as a temporary assistant marshal and Morgan was a deputy city marshal. Around 3 pm, the Earps and Holliday headed towards Fremont Street, where the Cowboys had been gathering. They found five Cowboys in a vacant lot adjacent to the O.K. Corral's rear entrance on Fremont Street. The lot was narrow between the Harwood House and Fly's Boarding House and Photography Studio; the two parties were initially only about apart. Ike Clanton and Billy Claiborne fled, but Tom and Frank McLaury and Billy Clanton stood their ground and were killed. Morgan was clipped by a shot across his back that nicked both shoulder blades and a vertebra. Virgil was shot through the calf, and Holliday was grazed by a bullet.  Charged with murder  Ike Clanton filed murder charges against the Earps and Holliday on October 30. Justice Wells Spicer convened a preliminary hearing on October 31 to determine whether enough evidence existed to go to trial. In an unusual proceeding, he took written and oral testimony from about 30 witnesses over more than a month. Sheriff Behan testified that the Cowboys had not resisted but had thrown up their hands and turned out their coats to show that they were not armed. He said that Tom McLaury threw open his coat to show that he was not armed and that the first two shots were fired by the Earp party. Behan insisted that Holliday had fired first using a nickel-plated revolver, although other witnesses reported seeing him carrying a messenger shotgun immediately beforehand. The Earps hired experienced trial lawyer Thomas Fitch as defense counsel. Since Virgil was confined to bed due to his wounds, Wyatt testified in a written statement that he drew his gun only after Clanton and McLaury went for their pistols. He detailed the Earps' previous troubles with the Clantons and McLaurys and explained that they had intended to disarm the Cowboys, and that his party had fired in self defense. Fitch produced contradictory testimony from prosecution witnesses during cross- examination, or they appeared to dodge his questions or said that they could not remember. Justice Spicer ruled on November 30 that there was not enough evidence to indict the men. He said that the evidence indicated that the Earps and Holliday acted within the law and that Virgil had deputized Holliday and Wyatt. From Turner, Alford (Ed.), The O. K. Corral Inquest (1992) The Earps and Holliday were free but their reputations had been tarnished. The Cowboys in Tombstone looked upon the Earps as robbers and murderers and plotted revenge. = Cowboys' revenge = Virgil was ambushed on December 28 while walking between saloons on Allen Street in Tombstone, and he was maimed by a shotgun blast which struck his left arm and shoulder. Ike Clanton's hat was found in the back of the building across Allen Street from where the shots were fired. Wyatt wired U.S. Marshal Crawley P. Dake asking to be appointed deputy U.S. marshal with authority to select his own deputies. Dake granted the request in late January and provided the Earps with some funds that he borrowed from Wells Fargo, variously reported as between $500 and $3,000. In mid-January, Earp's ally Rickabaugh sold the Oriental Saloon to Earp's adversary Milt Joyce, so Wyatt sold his gambling concessions at the hotel. The Earps also raised some funds from sympathetic business owners in town. Wyatt and Virgil submitted their resignations to Dake on February 2, 1882, being tired of the criticism leveled against them, but he refused to accept them because their accounts had not been settled. On the same day, Wyatt sent a message to Ike Clanton that he wanted to reconcile their differences, which Clanton refused. Clanton was also acquitted that day of the charges against him in the shooting of Virgil, when the defense brought in seven witnesses who testified that Clanton was in Charleston at the time of the shooting. The Earps needed more funds to pay for the extra deputies and associated expenses, as contributions from supportive business owners were not enough. On February 13, Wyatt mortgaged his home to lawyer James G. Howard for $365 (about $ today); he was never able to repay the loan and Howard foreclosed on the house in 1884. Morgan Earp was murdered on March 18 while playing billiards, shot by gunmen firing from a dark alley through a door window into the billiard room. He was struck in the right side; the bullet shattered his spine, passed through his left side, and lodged in the thigh of George A. B. Berry, while another round narrowly missed him. A doctor was summoned and Morgan was moved from the floor to a nearby couch, while the murderers escaped in the dark. He died 40 minutes later. Wyatt felt that he could not rely on civil justice and decided to take matters into his own hands to kill the murderers himself.  Earp vendetta ride A statue built on March 25, 2005. Depicting Earp and Holliday on location of 1880s Tucson Depot where Frank Stilwell was killed by Earp. Now part of Amtrak Station. The day after Morgan's murder, Deputy U.S. Marshal Wyatt Earp formed a posse made up of his brothers James and Warren, Doc Holliday, Sherman McMaster, Jack \\"Turkey Creek\\" Johnson, Charles \\"Hairlip Charlie\\" Smith, Dan Tipton, and Texas Jack Vermillion to protect the family and pursue the suspects, paying them $5 a day. They took Morgan's body to the railhead in Benson, and James accompanied it to the family home in Colton, California, where Morgan's wife and parents waited to bury him. The posse guarded Virgil and Allie to Tucson, where they had heard that Frank Stilwell and other Cowboys were waiting to kill Virgil. The next morning, Frank Stilwell's body was found alongside the tracks, riddled with buckshot and gunshot wounds. Wyatt and 5 other federal lawmen were indicted for murdering him, and Tucson Justice of the Peace, Charles Meyer, issued warrants for their arrest. The Earp posse briefly returned to Tombstone where Sheriff Behan tried to stop them, but was brushed aside. Hairlip Charlie and Warren remained in Tombstone, and the rest set out for Pete Spence's wood camp in the Dragoon Mountains. Spence was absent, but they found and killed Florentino \\"Indian Charlie\\" Cruz. Two days later, they stumbled onto the wood camp of William Brocius, Pony Diehl, and other outlaw Cowboys near Iron Springs in the Whetstone Mountains. According to reports from both sides, the two sides immediately exchanged gunfire. The Earp party withdrew to find protection from the heavy gunfire, except for Wyatt and Texas Jack Vermillion, whose horse was shot. Curly Bill fired at Wyatt with a shotgun but missed. Wyatt had protected Curly Bill against a mob ready to lynch him 18 months earlier, and he provided testimony that helped spare Curly Bill from a murder trial for killing Marshal Fred White. Wyatt returned Curly Bill's gunfire with his own shotgun, hitting him in the chest from about 50 ft. (15m) away. Thus falling into the waters edge of the spring and died. Wyatt then fired his revolver, mortally wounding Johnny Barnes in the chest and wounding Milt Hicks in the arm. Vermillion tried to retrieve his rifle wedged in the scabbard under his fallen horse, exposing himself to the Cowboys' gunfire, but Holliday helped him get to cover. Earp told biographer Stuart Lake that both sides of his long coat were shot through, and another bullet struck his boot heel. Ed Colburn wrote in a letter published in the Ford County Globe on May 23, 1882, that he'd visited with brothers Earp in Gunnison, Colorado. In the letter, he relayed Earp's story about how his overcoat was hit on both sides of his body by a charge of buckshot and that his saddle horn was shot off. John Flood wrote: Earp was finally able to get on his horse and retreat with the rest of the posse. Some modern researchers have found that most saddlehorns by this time were made of steel, not wood. Earp told several versions of the story in which he had trouble remounting his horse because his cartridge belt had slipped down his legs. He's never wounded in any of his confrontations, which added to his mystique. The posse left the Cowboys behind and rode north to the Percy Ranch, but they weren't welcomed by Hugh and Jim Percy, who feared the Cowboys; they left around 3 AM on March 27 after a meal and some rest. They arrived near Tombstone and met with supporters, including Hairlip Charlie and Warren Earp. That same day, the posse arrived at the Sierra Bonita Ranch owned by Henry Hooker, a wealthy and prominent rancher. That night, Dan Tipton caught the stagecoach out of Tombstone and headed for Benson, carrying $1,000 from mining owner and Earp supporter E. B. Gage for the posse. Hooker congratulated Earp on killing Curly Bill, and Wyatt told him that he wanted to buy new mounts. Hooker was known for his purebred stallions and ran more than 500 brood mares which produced horses that were renowned for their speed, beauty, and temperament. He provided Wyatt and his posse with new mounts but refused to take their money. Behan's posse was then observed in the distance, and Hooker suggested that Earp make his stand there, but Earp moved into the hills about 3 mi (5 km) distant near Reilly Hill. Earp's posse wasn't found by the local posse, led by Cochise County Sheriff John Behan, although Behan's party trailed them for many miles. In the middle of April 1882, the Earp posse left the Arizona Territory and headed east into New Mexico Territory and then into Colorado. The coroner reports credited the Earp posse with killing Frank Stilwell, Curly Bill, Indian Charlie, and Johnny Barnes in their 2 week-long ride. In 1888, Earp gave an interview to California historian Hubert Howe Bancroft, during which he claimed to have killed \\"over a dozen stage robbers, murderers, and cattle thieves\\" in his time as a lawman.  Life after Tombstone  The gunfight in Tombstone lasted only 30 seconds, but it ended up defining Earp for the rest of his life. His movements began to receive national press coverage after he killed Frank Stilwell in Tucson, and he left Arizona with his brother Warren, Holliday, McMaster, \\"Turkey Creek\\" Jack Johnson, and Texas Jack Vermillion. They stopped in Albuquerque, New Mexico where they met up with Earp's friend Deputy U.S. Marshal Bat Masterson. Masterson went with them to Trinidad, Colorado where he opened a faro game in a saloon and later became marshal. Earp dealt faro at Masterson's saloon for several weeks, then left for Gunnison, Colorado, in May 1882 with McMaster, Vermillion, and Warren Earp. The Earps and Texas Jack set up camp on the outskirts of Gunnison, where they remained quietly at first, rarely going into town for supplies. They reportedly pulled a \\"gold brick scam\\" in Gunnison on a German visitor named Ritchie by trying to sell him gold-painted rocks for $2,000. Earp and Holliday had a serious disagreement when Holliday accused him of becoming \\"a damn Jew-boy\\", and they parted ways in Albuquerque. Holliday and Earp met again in June 1882 in Gunnison after Earp intervened to keep his friend from being arrested on murder charges which they all had pending against them for killing Frank Stillwell in Tucson. Earp saw Holliday for a final time in the late winter of 1886, where they met in the lobby of the Windsor Hotel. Josephine Marcus described the skeletal Holliday as having a continuous cough and standing on \\"unsteady legs\\". The San Diego Union printed a report from the San Francisco Call on July 9, 1882, that Virgil Earp was in San Francisco (receiving treatment for his shattered arm) and that Wyatt was expected to arrive from Colorado that day. Wyatt took a job managing a horse stable in Santa Rosa. Earp developed a reputation as a sportsman as well as a gambler. He was reputed to own a six-horse stable in San Francisco, although it was learned later that the horses were leased. Following Wyatt's return to San Francisco, Josephine began using the name \\"Josephine Earp\\". Josephine was Earp's common-law wife for 46 years until his death. Wyatt and Josie remained in San Francisco for about nine months until early 1883, when they left for Silverton, Colorado where silver and gold mining were flourishing. It was the first of many mining camps and boomtowns in which they lived. However, he still owned a house in Tombstone with his former common-law wife Mattie, who had waited for him in Colton where his parents and Virgil were living. During the summer of 1882, she sent him a letter saying that she wanted a divorce. She had met a gambler from Arizona and he had asked her to marry him. Earp did not believe in divorce and therefore refused, but she ran away with the gambler anyway. The gambler abandoned her in Arizona, so she moved to Pinal City, Arizona where she resumed life as a prostitute. She struggled with addictions and committed suicide by opium poisoning on July 3, 1888. The \\"Dodge City Peace Commission\\", June 10, 1883; (L to R) standing: William H. Harris, Luke Short, Bat Masterson, William F. Petillon; seated: Charlie Bassett, Wyatt Earp, Michael Francis \\"Frank\\" McLean, and Cornelius \\"Neil\\" Brown Earp's friend Luke Short was part owner of the Long Branch saloon in Dodge City, but the mayor tried to run him out of business and out of town during the Dodge City War. Short appealed to Masterson, and Masterson contacted Earp on May 31, 1883. Earp and Josephine went with Masterson, Johnny Millsap, Shotgun John Collins, Texas Jack Vermillion, and Johnny Green to Dodge City to help Short, and they were sworn in as deputies by constable Dave Marrow. The town council offered a compromise to allow Short 10 days to get his affairs in order, but Earp refused to compromise. Short's Saloon reopened, and the so-called Dodge City War ended without a shot being fired. = Idaho mining venture = Earp arrived in Eagle City, Idaho, in 1884 along with Josephine, his brothers Warren and James, and James' wife Bessie. Eagle City was another new boomtown growing from the discovery of gold, silver, and lead in the Coeur d'Alene area; it is now a ghost town in Shoshone County, Idaho. Earp joined the crowd looking for gold in the Murray-Eagle mining district, and they paid $2,250 for a diameter white circus in which they opened a dance hall and saloon called The White Elephant. Earp was named deputy sheriff in the area, including newly incorporated Kootenai County, Idaho, which was disputing jurisdiction of Eagle City with Shoshone County. There were a considerable number of disagreements over mining claims and property rights which Earp had a part in. On March 28, a miner named Bill Buzzard was constructing a building when Earp's partner Jack Enright tried to stop him. Enright claimed that the building was on part of his property, and the two men began to argue. Buzzard fired several shots at Enright with his Winchester, then allies of both sides took defensive positions behind snowbanks and began shooting at one another. Earp and his brother James stepped into the middle of the fray and helped peacefully resolve the dispute before anyone was seriously hurt. Around April 1885, Earp reportedly used his badge to join a band of claim jumpers in Embry Camp, later renamed Chewelah, Washington. Within six months, their substantial stake had run dry, and the Earps left the Murray- Eagle district. About 10 years later, a reporter hunted up Buzzard after the Fitzimmons-Sharkey fight and extracted a story from him which accused Earp of being the brains behind lot-jumping and a real-estate fraud, further tarnishing his reputation. =California= The Coeur d'Alene mining venture died out by 1887, so Earp and Josephine went to San Diego, California where the railroad was about to arrive and a real estate boom was underway. They stayed for about four years, living most of the time in the Brooklyn Hotel. Earp speculated in San Diego's booming real estate market, and he bought four saloons and gambling halls between 1887 and around 1896, all in the \\"respectable\\" part of town. They offered 21 games, including faro, blackjack, poker, keno, pedro, and monte. At the height of the boom, he made up to $1,000 a night in profit. He also owned the Oyster Bar located in the first granite- faced building in San Diego, the four-story Louis Bank Building at 837 5th Avenue, one of the more popular saloons in the Stingaree district. One of the reasons that it drew a good crowd was the Golden Poppy brothel upstairs, owned by Madam Cora. Each room was painted a different color, such as emerald green, summer yellow, or ruby red, and each prostitute was required to dress in matching garments. Earp had a long-standing interest in boxing and horse racing, and he refereed boxing matches in San Diego, Tijuana, and San Bernardino. In the 1887 San Diego City Directory, he was listed as a capitalist or gambler. He won a race horse named Otto Rex in a card game and began investing in race horses, and he also judged prize fights on both sides of the border; he was one of the judges at the county fair horse races held in Escondido, California, in 1889. The boom came to an end as rapidly as it had started, and the population of San Diego fell from a high of 40,000 in 1885 when Earp arrived to only 16,000 in 1890. The Earps moved back to San Francisco in 1891 so that Josephine could be closer to her half-sister Henrietta's family, and Earp developed a reputation as a sportsman and a gambler. He held on to his San Diego properties, but when their value fell, he could not pay the taxes and was forced to sell the lots. He continued to race horses, but he could no longer afford to own them by 1896, so he raced them on behalf of the owner of a horse stable in Santa Rosa which he managed. In Santa Rosa, Earp personally competed in and won a harness race. From 1891 to 1897, the couple lived in at least four different locations in the city: 145 Ellis St., 720 McAllister St., 514A Seventh Ave., and 1004 Golden Gate Ave. = Later relationship with Josephine = Josephine wrote in her memoir that she and Earp were married in 1892 by the captain of multimillionaire Lucky Baldwin's yacht off the California coast. Raymond Nez wrote that his grandparents witnessed their marriage, but no public record has been found for the marriage.Baldwin was a horse breeder and racer who also owned the Santa Anita race track in Los Angeles which Earp frequented. Earp's relationship with Josephine was tempestuous at times. She gambled to excess and he had adulterous affairs. He knew that she preferred Josephine and detested \\"Sadie\\", but he had a mischievous sense of humor and began calling her Sadie early in their relationship. Earp's good friends in the Welsh family did not appreciate Josephine's gambling habits, and they noted that she received an allowance from her half-sister Rebecca and gambled it away, often leaving her husband hungry. In the 1920s, Earp gave Josephine signed legal papers and filing fees to a claim for an oil lease in Kern County, California. She gambled away the filing fees and lied to him about what happened to the lease, which later turned out to be valuable. He distrusted her ability to manage her finances and made an arrangement with her sister Henrietta Lenhardt. He put oil leases in Henrietta's name with the agreement that the proceeds would benefit Josephine after his death. In February 1926, the oil well was completed and producing 150 barrels a day, but Henrietta's three children refused to keep the agreement after their mother's death and kept the royalties to themselves. Josephine sued her sister's estate in an attempt to collect the royalties. Josephine later developed a reputation as a shrew who made life difficult for Earp. She frequently griped about his lack of work and financial success and even his character and personality, and he often went on long walks to get away from her. He was furious about her gambling habit, during which she lost considerable sums of money; each may have engaged in extramarital affairs. Josephine could also be controlling, and a relative of Wyatt joked that nobody could convict him of cold-blooded murder because he had lived with her for almost 50 years. = Fitzsimmons-Sharkey fight = A caricature of Wyatt Earp after the Sharkey-Fitzimmons fight: The public was outraged by his decision as referee and newspapers pilloried him for many weeks afterward. Earp was a last-minute choice as referee for a boxing match on December 2, 1896, which the promoters billed as the heavyweight championship of the world, when Bob Fitzsimmons was set to fight Tom Sharkey at the Mechanics' Pavilion in San Francisco. Earp had refereed 30 or so matches in earlier days, though not under the Marquess of Queensberry Rules but under the older and more liberal London Prize Ring Rules. The fight may have been the most anticipated fight on American soil that year. Fitzsimmons was favored to win, and the public and even civic officials placed bets on the outcome. Fitzsimmons dominated Sharkey throughout the fight, and he hit Sharkey with his famed \\"solar plexus punch\\" in the eighth round, an uppercut under the heart that could render a man temporarily helpless. Then, at Fitzsimmons' next punch, Sharkey dropped, clutched his groin, and rolled on the canvas screaming foul. Earp stopped the bout, ruling that Fitzsimmons had hit Sharkey below the belt, but virtually no one witnessed the punch. Earp awarded the fight to Sharkey, whom attendants carried out as \\"limp as a rag\\". The 15,000 fans in attendance greeted his decision with loud boos and catcalls. It was widely believed that no foul had occurred and that Earp had bet on Sharkey. Several doctors verified afterward that Sharkey had been hit hard below the belt, but the public had bet heavily on Fitzsimmons and they were livid at the outcome. Fitzsimmons went to court to overturn Earp's decision, and newspaper accounts and testimony over the next two weeks revealed a conspiracy among the boxing promoters to fix the fight's outcome. Newspapers across the United States republished the stories from the San Francisco papers and looked for local angles. On December 14, 1896, the San Francisco Call quoted a story from the New York Journal by Alfred H. Lewis, who accused the Earp brothers of being \\"stage robbers\\", and Earp was parodied in editorial caricatures by newspapers across the country. Stories about the fight and Earp's contested decision were distributed nationwide to a public that knew little of Wyatt Earp prior to that time. On December 17, Judge Sanderson finally ruled that prize fighting was illegal in San Francisco and the courts would not determine who the winner was. Sharkey retained the purse, but the decision provided no vindication for Earp. Until the fight, Earp had been a minor figure known regionally in California and Arizona; afterward, his name was known from coast to coast. The boxing match left a smear on his public character which followed him until he died and afterward. Eight years later, Dr. B. Brookes Lee was accused of treating Sharkey to make it appear that he had been fouled by Fitzsimmons, and Lee admitted that it was true. \\"I fixed Sharkey up to look as if he had been fouled,\\" he confessed. \\"I got $1,000 for my part in the affair.\\" = Klondike Gold Rush = The Earps rented this cabin in Rampart, Alaska, from Rex Beach and spent the winter of 1898‚Äì1899 there. Nome, Alaska in 1900 was about two blocks wide and five miles long Nome, Alaska, in 1900: The Dexter Saloon at left was owned by Wyatt Earp and his partner Charles E. Hoxie. It was the city's first two-story wooden building and its largest and most luxurious saloon. While in Yuma, Wyatt heard of the gold rush in the Alaska Yukon. On August 5, 1897, Wyatt and Sadie left for San Francisco. Earp was reported to have secured the backing of a syndicate of sporting men to open a gambling house there. They intended to catch a ship to Alaska, but their departure was delayed for seven weeks when Wyatt fell while getting off Market Street streetcar and bruised or broke his hip. Sadie got pregnant too, and she thought she could persuade Earp from heading to Alaska. He was in agreement, but Sadie, who was 37, miscarried soon after. They finally boarded the steamship Rosalie on September 21, 1897. They arrived in Dawson in the Yukon on late September, where Wyatt planned to open a faro game. Wyatt and Josephine spent only a month in Dawson, When they returned north, Wyatt was offered a job as the marshal in Wrangell, Alaska, but he served for only 10 days. Sadie learned she was pregnant again, and they returned to San Francisco on October 11 aboard the steamship City of Seattle. But Sadie miscarried again. The Earps spent the winter in Wrangell before setting out in the spring for Dawson on board the Governor Pingree via the Yukon River. By the time they reached Rampart on the Yukon River, freeze-up had set in. The Earps rented a cabin from Rex Beach for $100 a month and spent the winter of 1898‚Äì1899 there. In 1898, they got as far as Rampart before the Yukon River froze in place for the winter. Rampart was a friendly place, but far from the real action. They left with the spring thaw and headed for St. Michael, on the Norton Sound, a major gateway to the Alaskan interior via the Yukon River. Wyatt managed a small store during the spring of 1899, selling beer and cigars for the Alaska Commercial Company. But Wyatt's friend Tex Rickard sent him a number of letters belittling Wyatt's steady but small income in St. Michael as \\"chickenfeed\\" and persuaded him to relocate to Nome. Wyatt Earp billed his Dexter Saloon in Nome, seen here in 1901, as, \\"The only second class saloon in Alaska.\\" At the time of the Earps' arrival, Nome was two blocks wide and five miles long. The best accommodations Wyatt and Sadie could find was a wooden shack a few minutes from the main street, only slightly better than a tent. The river was an open sewer. Typhoid, dysentery and pneumonia were common. In September, Earp and partner Charles E. Hoxie built the Dexter Saloon in Nome, the city's first two-story wooden building and its largest and most luxurious saloon. The second floor had 12 \\"clubrooms\\" decorated with fine mirrors, thick carpets, draperies, and sideboards. Trading on Earp's name, the Dexter was a success. It was used for a variety of purposes because it was so large: with ceilings. Earp used the club rooms upstairs as a brothel, another fact that Sadie worked hard to see was omitted from stories about him. Sadie justified the services upstairs because the Dexter was a \\"better class\\" saloon and served an \\"important civic purpose\\". The Dexter drew anyone famous who visited Nome. Wyatt rubbed elbows with future novelist Rex Beach, writer Jack London, playwright Wilson Mizner, and boxing promoter Tex Rickard, with whom Earp developed a long-lasting relationship. Rickard was a partner in the Northern Saloon and gambling house in Nome. Both the Dexter and the Northern Saloon competed for business with more than 60 other saloons in town serving an estimated 20,000 residents. Wyatt told others he made his money by \\"mining the miners\\". He was arrested twice in Nome for minor offenses, including being drunk and disorderly, although he was not tried. Most members of law enforcement were corrupt or otherwise engaged. Wyatt Earp (left) in Nome, Alaska, with long-time friend and former Tombstone mayor and newspaper editor John Clum (right), 1900 Said to be Wyatt Earp's pistol, left behind in Juneau, Alaska, but Earp was arrested in Nome three days before the date on the sign. In November 1899, Earp left Alaska on the iron steamer Cleveland. The ship was infested with lice and was struck by a storm on the Bering Sea, making for a difficult trip. It took nine days to reach Seattle, Washington. On July 6, 1900, Wyatt's brother Warren was shot and killed in a saloon in Willcox, Arizona. Wyatt learned about his death soon after, and although some modern researchers believe he went to Arizona to avenge his brother's death, the distance and time required to make the trip made it unlikely, and no contemporary evidence has been found to support that theory. In 2018, archivists at the Alaska State Library digitized a collection of documents relating to Earp's arrival and stay in Alaska. = Saloon ownership and gambling = Earp arrived in Seattle with a plan to open a saloon and gambling room. On November 25, 1899, the Seattle Star described him as \\"a man of great reputation among the toughs and criminals, inasmuch as he formerly walked the streets of a rough frontier mining town with big pistols stuck in his belt, spurs on his boots, and a devil-may-care expression upon his official face\\". The Seattle Daily Times was less full of praise, announcing in a very small article that he had a reputation in Arizona as a \\"bad man\\", which in that era was synonymous with \\"villain\\" and \\"desperado\\". He faced considerable opposition to his plan from John Considine, who controlled all three gaming operations in town. Although gambling was illegal, Considine had worked out an agreement with Police Chief C. S. Reed. Earp partnered with an established local gambler named Thomas Urguhart, and they opened the Union Club saloon and gambling operation in Seattle's Pioneer Square. The Seattle Star noted two weeks later that Earp's saloon was earning a large following. Considine unsuccessfully tried to intimidate Earp, but his saloon continued to prosper. After the city failed to act, on March 23, 1900, the Washington state attorney general filed charges against several gamblers, including Earp and his partner. The club's furnishings were confiscated and burned. The Earps returned briefly to San Francisco in April 1900, but soon continued on to Seattle. Newspapers in Seattle and San Francisco falsely reported on Wyatt's wealth which prompted a stampede to Nome to seek similar riches. Nome was advertised as an \\"exotic summer destination\\" and four ships a day left Seattle with passengers infected with \\"gold fever\\". On June 14, 1900, Wyatt and Sadie boarded the steamer SS Alliance in Seattle, bound for Nome. They brought many luxurious accessories with them to decorate The Dexter. Within weeks Nome had grown to a city of over 20,000 inhabitants. In 1900, the major business there \\"was not mining, but gambling and saloon trade. There were 100 saloons and gambling houses, with an occasional restaurant.\\" Losses of $10,000 per hand in poker were not extraordinary. Prize fighting became the sport of choice and Wyatt's income soared with side bets. He often refereed bouts himself at The Dexter.Farthest North Newspaper October 9, 1899. Nome News (as published in the Los Angeles Herald). The Earps stayed at the Hollenback Hotel in Los Angeles in December 1901 after returning from Alaska. Wyatt Earp's Northern Saloon, Tonopah, Nevada, circa 1902: The man in the center is believed to be Wyatt Earp, and the woman on the left is often identified as Josephine Earp. In November 1901, at age 40, Sadie got pregnant again, and she and Wyatt decided to leave Alaska. They sold their interest in the Dexter to their partner, Charlie Hoxie. Wyatt and Sadie left Alaska on board the SS Roanoke and arrived in Los Angeles at the Hollenbeck Hotel on December 13, 1901. They had an estimated $80,000, a relative fortune (equivalent to about $ today). Sadie miscarried and lost the baby. Three months later, in February 1902, they arrived in Tonopah, Nevada, known as the \\"Queen of the Silver Camps\\", where silver and gold had been discovered in 1900 and a boom was under way. Wyatt and Sadie opened the Northern Saloon in Tonopah and he served as a deputy U.S. marshal under Marshal J.F. Emmitt. His saloon, oil, and copper mining interests produced some income for a period. After Tonopah's gold strike waned, they moved in 1905 to Goldfield, Nevada, where his brother Virgil and his wife were living. Tex Rickard was also already there and had opened a second Northern Saloon. He hired Wyatt as a pit boss. Wyatt also staked mining claims just outside Death Valley and elsewhere in the Mojave Desert. In 1906, he discovered several deposits of gold and copper near the Sonoran Desert town of Vidal, California, on the Colorado River and filed more than 100 mining claims near the Whipple Mountains. While in Los Angeles, they lived in at least nine small Los Angeles rentals as early as 1885 and as late as 1929, mostly in the summer. = Life in Los Angeles = In 1910, when he was 62, the Los Angeles Police Department hired Wyatt and former Los Angeles detective Arthur Moore King at $10.00 per day to carry out various tasks \\"outside the law\\" such as retrieving criminals from Mexico, which he did very capably. This led to Wyatt's final armed confrontation. In October 1910, he was asked by former Los Angeles Police Commissioner H. L. Lewis to head up a posse to protect surveyors of the American Trona Company who were attempting to wrest control of mining claims for vast deposits of potash on the edge of Searles Lake held in receivership by the foreclosed California Trona Company. Wyatt and the group he guarded were regarded as claim jumpers and were confronted by armed representatives of the other company. King wrote, \\"it was the nerviest thing he had ever seen\\". With guns pulled, Wyatt came out of his tent with a Winchester rifle, firing a round at the feet of Federal Receiver Stafford W. Austin. \\"Back off or I'll blow you apart, or my name is not Wyatt Earp\\". The owners summoned the U.S. marshal, who arrested Earp and 27 others, served them with a summons for contempt of court, and sent them home. Earp's actions did not resolve the dispute, which eventually escalated into the \\"Potash Wars\\" of the Mojave Desert. On July 23, 1911, Earp was arrested in Los Angeles and charged with attempting to fleece J. Y. Peterson, a realty broker, in a fake faro game. Since money had not changed hands, the charge against Earp was reduced to vagrancy and he was released on $500 bail. Wyatt and Josephine Earp in their mining camp near Vidal, California: This is the only confirmed picture of the two of them together. Wyatt Earp's camp, tent and ramada near Vidal, California and Wyatt's mining operations. Sadie is at left, Wyatt is on the right with his dog. The Earps bought a small cottage in Vidal, the only home they ever owned. Beginning in 1911 and until Wyatt's health began to fail in 1928, Wyatt and Sadie Earp summered in Los Angeles and spent the rest of the year in the desert working their claims. The \\"Happy Days\\" mine was located in the Whipple Mountains a few miles north of Vidal. Wyatt had some modest success with the Happy Days gold mine, and they lived on the slim proceeds of income from that and oil wells in Oakland and Kern County. In about 1923, Charles Welsh, a retired railroad engineer and friend that Earp had known since Dodge City, frequently invited the Earps to visit his family in San Bernardino. When the Welsh family moved to Los Angeles, the Earps accepted an invitation to stay with them for a while in their top-floor apartment until the Earps found a place to rent. After Earp and Sadie moved into a bungalow nearby, Charlie Welsh's daughter, Grace Spolidora, recalled that Sadie, who had never had many domestic skills, did very little housekeeping or cooking for Wyatt. She and her sister Alma were concerned about the care Sadie gave Wyatt. Though he was at times very ill, she still did not cook for him. Spolidora, her sisters, and her mother brought in meals. =Movie connections= While living in Los Angeles, Earp became an unpaid film consultant for several silent cowboy movies. In 1915, Earp visited the set of director Allan Dwan's movie, The Half-Breed, starring Douglas Fairbanks. In his autobiography, Dwan recalled, \\"As was the custom in those days, he [Earp] was invited to join the party and mingle with our background action.\\" Earp became friends with William S. Hart and later Tom Mix, the two most famous movie cowboys of their era. Hart was a stickler for realism in his depictions of Western life, and may have relied on Earp for advice. Earp later frequently visited the sets of movie director John Ford, whose movies starred Harry Carey. Ford's son Patrick later wrote, \\"My dad was real friendly with Wyatt Earp, and as a little boy I remember him.\\" In 1916, Earp went with his friend Jack London, whom he knew from Nome, to visit the set of former cowboy, sailor, and movie actor-turned-film director Raoul Walsh, who was shooting at the studio of Mutual Film conglomerate in Edendale, California. Walsh took the two men to dinner at Al Levy's Cafe on Main and Third Street. During the meal, the highest paid entertainer in the world, Charlie Chaplin, dropped by to greet Wyatt Earp. Chaplin was impressed by both men, but particularly the former Tombstone marshal. In the early 1920s, Earp was given the honorary title of deputy sheriff in San Bernardino County, California. On January 25, 1926, Wyatt's only surviving brother James died of cerebral apoplexy in San Bernardino, California. Earp tried to persuade his good friend, well-known cowboy movie star William S. Hart, to help set the record straight about his life and get a movie made. \\"If the story were exploited on the screen by you,\\" he wrote Hart, \\"It would do much toward setting me right before a public which has always been fed lies about me.\\" Hart encouraged Earp to first find an author to pen his story. In 1925, Earp began to collaborate on a biography with his friend and former mining engineer John Flood to get his story told in a way that he approved. Flood volunteered his time and attempted to write an authorized biography of Earp's life, based on Earp's recollections. The two men sat together every Sunday in the kitchen of Earp's modest, rented bungalow. While Wyatt sipped a drink and smoked a cigar, they tried to tell Earp's story, but Josephine was always present. She often interrupted and insisted, \\"You can't write that! It needs to be clean.\\" She also demanded that they add more \\"pep\\" to the manuscript, which in her mind meant including the word \\"CRACK!\\" in all capitals. In the chapter about the shootout, the manuscript includes 109 uses of \\"CRACK\\". She thought Earp needed to be shown as a hero, and the manuscript includes a chapter titled \\"Conflagration\\" in which Earp saves two women, one a cripple, from a Tombstone fire. Flood's writing was \\"stilted, corny, and one-dimensional\\", and the manuscript, completed some time in early 1926, never found a publisher. In February 1927, editor Anne Johnston of Bobbs Merrill wrote back and was highly critical of the \\"stilted, florid, and diffuse\\" writing. She wrote, \\"Now one forgets what it's all about in the clutter of unimportant details that impedes its pace, and the pompous manner of its telling.\\" Spolidora as a teenager had visited the Earps many times near her family home in Needles, California, and she sometimes went to San Diego with them. In an interview with the San Bernardino historical society in 1990, she attributed the highly exaggerated stories about Wyatt Earp to Josephine. Josephine \\"would always interfere whenever Wyatt would talk with Stuart Lake. She always interfered! She wanted him to look like a church-going saint and blow things up. Wyatt didn't want that at all!\\" Hart tried to help. In February 1926, he wrote The Saturday Evening Post and encouraged them to publish Flood's biography so \\"that ... the rising generation may know the real from the unreal\\", but Flood was a horrendous writer, and publisher after publisher rejected the manuscript. Several copies were made and sold in 1981, and the original carbon copy of the typed manuscript, found among Josephine Earp's papers, was given by Glenn Boyer to the Ford County Historical Society.  Death  Wyatt Earp was the last surviving Earp brother and the last surviving participant of the gunfight at the O.K. Corral when he died at home in the Earps' small rented bungalow at 4004 W 17th Street, in Los Angeles, of chronic cystitis on January 13, 1929, at the age of 80. The Los Angeles Times reported that he had been ill with liver disease for three years.Wyatt Earp's obituary: Tamer of Wild West Dies Los Angeles Times January 14, 1929. His brother Newton had died almost a month prior on December 18, 1928. Wyatt was survived by Josephine and sister Adelia Earp Edwards. He had no children. Charlie Welsh's daughter Grace Spolidora and his daughter-in-law, Alma, were the only witnesses to Wyatt's body's cremation. Josephine was apparently too grief-stricken to assist. = Hollywood pallbearers = The funeral was held at the Congregational Church on Wilshire Boulevard. Earp's pallbearers were William J. Hunsaker, (Earp's attorney in Tombstone and noted Los Angeles attorney); Jim Mitchell (Los Angeles Examiner reporter and Hollywood screenwriter); George W. Parsons (founding member of Tombstone's \\"Committee of Vigilance\\"); Wilson Mizner (a friend of Wyatt's during the Klondike Gold Rush); John Clum (a good friend from his days in Tombstone, former Tombstone mayor, and editor of The Tombstone Epitaph); William S. Hart (good friend and Western actor and silent film star); and Tom Mix (friend and Western film star). Mitchell wrote Wyatt's local obituary. The newspapers reported that Tom Mix cried during his friend's service. When Josephine did not attend Wyatt's funeral, Grace Spolidora was furious. \\"She didn't go to his funeral, even. She wasn't that upset. She was peculiar. I don't think she was that devastated when he died.\\" = Privately buried = The Earps' replacement headstone at the Jewish Hills of Eternity Cemetery in Colma, California Josephine, who was Jewish, had Earp's body cremated and secretly buried his remains in the Marcus family plot at the Hills of Eternity Memorial Park, a Jewish cemetery in Colma, California. When she died in 1944, her body was buried alongside his ashes. She had purchased a small white marble headstone which was stolen shortly after her death in 1944. It was discovered in a backyard in Fresno, California. A second stone of flat granite was also stolen. On July 7, 1957, grave-robbers dug into the Earp's grave in an apparent attempt to steal the urn containing his ashes. Unable to find his cremains, they stole the grave stone. Actor Hugh O'Brian, who was playing Earp in the 1955‚Äì61 television series The Life and Legend of Wyatt Earp, offered a reward for the stone's return. It was located for sale in a flea market. Cemetery officials re-set the stone flush in concrete, but it was stolen again. Actor Kevin Costner, who played Earp in the 1994 movie Wyatt Earp offered to buy a new, larger stone, but the Marcus family thought his offer was self-serving and declined. Descendants of Josie's half-sister Rebecca allowed a Southern California group in 1998-99 to erect the stone currently in place. The earlier stone is on display in the Colma Historical museum. In 1957, the Tombstone Restoration Commission looked for Wyatt's ashes with the intention of having them re-located to Tombstone. They contacted family members seeking permission and the location of his ashes, but no one could tell them where they were buried, not even his closest living relative, George Earp. Arthur King, a deputy to Earp from 1910 to 1912, finally revealed that Josephine had buried Wyatt's ashes in Colma, California, and the Tombstone Commission cancelled its plans to relocate them. Their gravesite is the most visited resting place in the Jewish cemetery. = No regrets = Two years before his death, Earp defended his decisions before the gunfight at the O.K. Corral and his actions afterward in an interview with Stuart Lake, author of the 1931 largely fictionalized biography Wyatt Earp: Frontier Marshal:  Physical description  Tall like his brothers, Wyatt Earp was when the average height was about . He was described in 1887 by the Los Angeles Herald as \\"quiet, unassuming, broad-shouldered, with a large blonde mustache. He is dignified, self-contained, game and fearless, and no man commands greater respect ... \\" He weighed about , was long-armed, and muscular, and was very capable of using his fists instead of his weapon to control those resisting his authority. At about the same time, The Mirror, a newspaper in Monroe, Iowa, printed a wire story originating in Denver. The anonymous reporter described Wyatt in detail: In 1926, writer Adela Rogers St. Johns met the elderly Earp for the first time.  Contemporary reputation  Among his peers near his death, Wyatt was respected. His deputy Jimmy Cairns described Wyatt's work as a police officer in Wichita, Kansas. \\"Wyatt Earp was a wonderful officer. He was game to the last ditch and apparently afraid of nothing. The cowmen all respected him and seemed to recognize his superiority and authority at such times as he had to use it.\\" He described Wyatt as \\"the most dependable man I ever knew; a quiet, unassuming chap who never drank and in all respects a clean young fellow\\". When citizens of Dodge City learned the Earps had been charged with murder after the gunfight, they sent letters endorsing and supporting the Earps to Judge Wells Spicer. John Clum, owner of The Tombstone Epitaph and mayor of Tombstone while Wyatt was a gambler and lawman there, described him in his book It All Happened in Tombstone. Bill Dixon knew Wyatt early in his adult life. He wrote: Public perception of his life has varied over the years as media accounts of his life have changed. The story of the Earps' actions in Tombstone were published at the time by newspapers nationwide. Shortly after the shooting of Curly Bill, the Tucson Star wrote on March 21, 1882, in an editorial about the O.K. Corral gunfight, that the Cowboys had been ordered to put their hands up and after they complied, were shot by the Earps, stating, \\"The whole series of killings cannot be classed other than cold blooded murder.\\" Famous lawman Bat Masterson described Wyatt in 1907. = Experience in gun fights = Wyatt was reputed to be an expert with a revolver. He showed no fear of any man. The Tombstone Epitaph said of Wyatt, \\"bravery and determination were requisites, and in every instance proved himself the right man in the right place\\". Wyatt was lucky during the few gun fights he took part in from his earliest job as an assistant police officer in Wichita to Tombstone, where he was briefly deputy U.S. marshal. Unlike his lawmen brothers Virgil and James, Wyatt was never wounded, although once his clothing and his saddle were shot through with bullet holes. According to John H. Flood's biography (as dictated to him by Wyatt Earp), Wyatt vividly recalled a presence that in several instances warned him away or urged him to take action. This happened when he was on the street, alone in his room at the Cosmopolitan Hotel, at Bob Hatch's Pool Hall, where he went moments before Morgan was assassinated, and again when he approached Iron Springs and surprised Curly Bill Brocius, killing him.  Later reputation  After the shootout in Tombstone, his pursuit and murder of those who attacked his brothers, and after leaving Arizona, Wyatt was often the target of negative newspaper stories that disparaged his and his brothers' reputation. His role in history has stimulated considerable ongoing scholarly and editorial debate. A large body of literature has been written about Wyatt Earp and his legacy, some of it highly fictionalized. Considerable portions of it are either full of admiration and flattery or hostile debunking. Wyatt was repeatedly criticized in the media over the remainder of his life. His wife Josephine wrote, \\"The falsehoods that were printed in some of the newspapers about him and the unjust accusations against him hurt Wyatt more deeply than anything that ever happened to him during my life with him, with the exception of his mother's death and that of his father and brother, Warren.\\" = Negative publicity = On April 16, 1894, the Fort Worth Gazette wrote that Virgil Earp and John Behan had a \\"deadly feud\\". It described Behan as \\"an honest man, a good official, and possessed many of the attributes of a gentleman\\". Earp, on the other hand, \\"was head of band of desperadoes, a partner in stage robbers, and a friend of gamblers and professional killers ... Wyatt was the boss killer of the region.\\" Former nemesis Johnny Behan continued to spread rumors about the Earps for the next 20 years. On December 7, 1897, he was quoted in a story in the Washington Post, reprinted by the San Francisco Call, describing the Earp's lawbreaking behavior in Tombstone. After referring to the Fitzimmons-Sharkey fight, the article quoted Behan. \\"The Clanton brothers and the McLowrys were a tough lot of rustlers who were the main perpetrators of the rascailly rife in that region. Between them and Earps rose a bitter feud over the division of the proceeds of the looting. The Earp boys believed they had failed to get a fair divide of the booty and swore vengeance. They caught their former allies in Tombstone unarmed and shot three of them dead while their hands were uplifted.\\" Behan went on to say, \\"They were hauled up before a Justice of the Peace ... Warrants were issued for their arrest, and, summoning a posse, I went out to bring the Earps in. They were chased entirely out of the country and Tombstone knew them no more.\\" Up until he died in 1912, Johnny Behan lambasted the Earps as the bad men who had attacked the cowboys. After Earp left Alaska in 1901, the New York Sun printed a story in 1903 that described a confrontation Earp had reportedly had with a short Cockney Canadian Mountie, who embarrassed Earp by demanding that he leave his weapon in his room. The story was reprinted as far away as New Zealand by the Otago Witness. The Dawson Record commented on the story, mocking the newspaper as a \\"venerable dispenser of truth\\". On April 13, 1921, the Arizona Republican ran a lengthy interview with Thomas Raines, a former resident of Tombstone. Raines described the gunfight as an ambush. He said that he remembered the Earps shot the Cowboys and killed Ike Clanton (when they actually killed his brother Billy) before the Cowboys had a chance to surrender. He recalled that the Cowboys \\"were leading their horses out of the gate when they were confronted, almost from ambush, by four of the Earps, Virgil. Wyatt, Morgan and Jim and by Doc Holliday. Virgil Earp, armed with a sawed off express shotgun, and accompanying his demand with profanity, yelled \\"Hands up!\\" But he didn't wait for the action demanded and shot almost as soon as he spoke. Tom McLowery showed his empty bands, and cried. 'Gentlemen, I am unarmed.' Holliday answered with the discharge of his shotgun. Ike Clanton fell at the first fire, mortally wounded, but he rolled over and fired two shots from his pistol between his bent knees.\\" During 1922, Frederick R. Bechdolt published the book When the West Was Young, which included a story about Wyatt's time in Tombstone, but he mangled many basic facts. He described the Earp-Clanton differences as the falling-out of partners in crime.Bechdolt, Frederick R. (1922) When the West was Young The Century Company On March 12, 1922, the Sunday Los Angeles Times ran a short, scandalous article titled \\"Lurid Trails Are Left by Olden-Day Bandits\\" by J.M. Scanland. It described Wyatt and his brothers as a gang, comparable to the Dalton Gang, who waylaid the cowboys in the shoot out at the O.K. Corral. It said that the Earps were allies of Frank Stilwell, who had informed on them, so they killed him, and that Earp had died in Colton, California. The author concocted a fictional description of the Earp's relationship with Sheriff Behan and the Cowboys: Josephine and Earps' friend and actor William Hart both wrote letters to the publisher. Josephine demanded that the error \\"must be corrected and printed in the same sensational manner\\" given to the correction as to the original article, which the paper published. = Reputation at death = At the time of his death, Earp may have been more well known for the controversy that engulfed him after the Fitzsimmons vs. Sharkey match in San Francisco than for the gunfight in Tombstone. His Associated Press obituary gave prominent attention to his officiating of the Fitzsimmons-Sharkey fight, while describing him as a \\"gun-fighter whose blazing six-shooters were, for most of his life, allied with the side of law and order\\". In its January 14, 1929, obituary, the Los Angeles Times wrote a fictional account of Earp taming Colton, California:  Modern reputation  Long after his death, he has many devoted detractors and admirers. Earp's modern-day reputation is that of the Old West's \\"toughest and deadliest gunman of his day\\". = Walter Noble Burns = Author Walter Noble Burns visited Earp in September 1926 and asked him questions with the intent to write a book about Earp. Earp declined because he was already collaborating with John Flood. Burns visited Tombstone and based on what he learned decided instead to focus his book on Doc Holliday. He pestered Earp for facts, and on March 27 the next year, Earp finally responded to Burns' repeated requests in an 11-page letter outlining the basic facts from Earp's point of view. When their efforts to get the Flood manuscript published failed, the Earps decided to appeal to Burns, whose own book was near publication. But he was not interested. His book was about to be published, free of the constraints imposed by a collaboration with Earp. Burns wrote them, \\"I should not now care to undertake another book which, in part at least, would be upon much the same lines ... I should have been delighted six months ago to accept your offer but it is too late now. My book has championed Mr. Earp's cause throughout and I believe will vindicate his reputation in Tombstone in a way that he will like.\\" When Burns turned them down, Josephine actively worked to stop the publication of his book, fearful that their efforts to publish Wyatt's biography would be thwarted as a result. In late 1927, Burns published Tombstone, An Iliad of the Southwest, a mesmerizing tale \\"of blood and thunder,\\" that christened Earp as the \\"Lion of Tombstone\\". \\"Strong, bold, forceful, picturesque was the fighter of the old frontier. Something epic in him, fashioned in Homeric mold. In his way, a hero.\\" It included a good deal about Wyatt as well, much to Wyatt and Josie's displeasure. Readers and reviewers found they had a difficult time discerning between \\"fact and fiction\\". The book was the first to popularize its subject for a mass reading audience. Burns treated Earp as a mythical figure, a \\"larger-than-life hero whose many portrayals in film, television, and books often render fidelity to truth the first casualty\\". = Billy Breakenridge = While living in Vidal, Wyatt and Josie were visited by Billy Breakenridge, the former Tombstone deputy under John Behan. He pressed Wyatt for details about his time in Tombstone to add to his book Helldorado: Bringing Law to the Mesquite. Breakenridge was assisted by Western novelist William MacLeod Raine, who since 1904 had published more than 25 novels about Western history. The book was published in 1928 before Wyatt died. It depicted Wyatt as a thief, pimp, crooked gambler, and murderer. Breakenridge wrote that the Earps and Doc Holliday aggressively mistreated the guiltless cowboys until they were forced into a fatal confrontation. His description of the 1881 O.K. Corral gun fight stated that the Clanton and McLaury brothers were merely cowboys who had been unarmed and surrendered but the Earp brothers had shot them in cold blood. Wyatt and Josie protested that the book's contents was biased and more fiction than fact. Earp complained about the book until his death in 1929, and his wife continued in the same vein afterward. = Edwin Burkholder = Edwin V. Burkholder, who specialized in stories about the Old West, published an article about Wyatt in 1955 in Argosy Magazine. He called Wyatt Earp a coward and murderer, and manufactured evidence to support his allegations. He also wrote, using the pseudonyms \\"George Carleton Mays\\" and \\"J. S. Qualey\\", for the Western magazine Real West. His stores were filled with sensational claims about Wyatt Earp's villainy, and he made up fake letters to the editor from supposed \\"old-timers\\" to corroborate this story. = Frank Waters = Frank Waters interviewed Virgil Earp's widow, Allie Sullivan Earp, to write The Earp Brothers of Tombstone. Allie Earp was so upset by the way Waters distorted and manipulated her words that she threatened to shoot him. His writing was so contentious and disputed that he waited until 13 years after her death to publish the book. In it, Waters vociferously berated Wyatt: Purportedly quoting Allie, he invented bitter public fights between Mattie and Wyatt, and told how Wyatt's affair with Sadie Marcus, \\"the slut of Tombstone,\\" had humiliated Mattie. He condemned the Earp brothers' character and called them names. Waters used Allie Earp's anecdotes as a frame for adding a narrative and \\"building a case, essentially piling quote upon quote to prove that Wyatt Earp was a con man, thief, robber, and eventually murderer\\". The book \\"further embroidered upon Frank Waters's imaginings about Wyatt's adulterous affair\\" with Josephine. It was described by one reviewer as \\"a smear campaign levied against the Earp brothers\\". Years later, he wrote a letter to the Arizona Historical Society in which he admitted that he had combined Allie's words to create a \\"cold, objective analysis\\" and \\"expose\\" of the whole subject. S. J. Reidhead, author of Travesty: Frank Waters Earp Agenda Exposed, spent nearly a decade searching for Water's original manuscript, researching him, his background, and his bias against the Earps. In doing so, the author discovered that the story Waters presented against the Earps was primarily fictitious. \\"Nothing is documented,\\" she wrote. \\"There are no notes nor sourcing. There is only the original Tombstone Travesty manuscript and the final Earp Brothers of Tombstone. Because of his later reputation, few writers, even today, dare question Waters' motives. They also do not bother fact checking the Earp Brothers of Tombstone, which is so inaccurate it should be considered fiction, rather than fact.\\" Anti-Earp writers and researchers use Frank Waters' Earp Brothers of Tombstone, as their primary source for material that presents Wyatt Earp as something of a villainous monster, aided and abetted by his brothers who were almost brutes. Waters detested the Earps so badly that he presented a book that was terribly flawed, poorly edited, and brimming with prevarications. In his other work, Waters is poetic. In the Earp Brothers of Tombstone, he is little more than a tabloid hack, trying to slander someone he dislikes. To date, no reason has been uncovered for the bias Frank Waters exhibited against Wyatt Earp and his brothers. = Ed Bartholomew = In 1963, Ed Bartholomew published Wyatt Earp, The Untold Story followed by Wyatt Earp: Man and Myth in 1964. His books were strongly anti-Earp and attacked Wyatt Earp's image as a hero. Bartholomew went about this by reciting snippets of accumulated anti-Earp facts, rumors, gossip, and innuendo. Bartholomew's books started a trend of debunking Earp, and the academic community followed his lead, pursuing the image of Earp as a \\"fighting pimp\\". = Allen Barra = In reviewing Allen Barra's Inventing Wyatt Earp. His Life and Many Legends, William Urban, a professor of history at Monmouth College in Warren County, Illinois, pointed out a number of factual inaccuracies in the book. One inconsistency by Barra, pointed out by another reviewer, includes a description of the poker game the night before the shootout. Ike Clanton's account of the game (the only one that exists) gives the participants as John Behan, Virgil Earp, Ike Clanton, Tom McLaury, and a fifth man Ike did not recognize, while Barra wrote that Holliday had attended the game.  Fame  Earp was dismayed about the controversy that continually followed him. He wrote a letter to John Hays Hammond on May 21, 1925, telling him \\"notoriety had been the bane of my life. I detest it, and I never have put forth any effort to check the tales that have been published in which my brothers and I are supposed to have been the principal participants. Not one of them is correct.\\" The 1922 scandalous story in the Sunday Los Angeles Times by Scanland annoyed Earp. He was tired of all the lies perpetuated about him and became determined to get his story accurately told. Still, in 1924, a story in a San Francisco paper said interviewing him was \\"like pulling teeth\\". Earp did not trust the press and preferred to keep his mouth shut. The many negative, untruthful stories bothered Earp a great deal, and he finally decided to tell his own story. Earp also tried to find J. M. Scanland, the author of the LA Times article, and extract a written retraction from him, which he finally did in 1927. In 1925, Earp began to collaborate on a biography with his friend and former mining engineer with John Flood to get his story told in a way that he approved. = Lake's biography = Unlike most legendary lawmen of the American West, Earp was relatively unknown until Stuart N. Lake published the first biography of Wyatt Earp, Wyatt Earp: Frontier Marshal in 1931, two years after Earp died. Lake portrayed Earp as a \\"Western superhero\\" who single- handedly cleaned up a town full of cowboy criminals. In fact, Earp had been a stagecoach guard for Wells Fargo, a full-time gambler, a regular associate of prostitutes, and, occasionally, a lawman. Lake wrote the book with Earp's input, but was only able to interview him eight times before Earp died, during which Earp sketched out the \\"barest facts\\" of his life. Despite having received very little information from Earp, Lake wrote the biography in the first person. Lake initially sought Earp out hoping to write a magazine article about him. Earp was also seeking a biographer at about the same time. Earp, who was 80, was concerned that his vantage point on the Tombstone story may be lost, and may have been financially motivated, as he had little income in his last years of life. During the interviews and in later correspondence, Josephine and Wyatt went to great lengths to keep her name out of Lake's book. Lake wrote Earp that he planned to send portions of the book to his New York agent, but Earp objected because he wanted to read it first. After Earp's death on January 13, 1929, Josephine continued to try to persuade Lake to leave her and Earp's former wife, Mattie Blaylock, out of the book, even threatening legal action. Lake finally published Wyatt Earp: Frontier Marshal in 1931, two years after Earp's death. Lake's creative biography portrays Earp as a \\"Western superhero\\", \\"gallant white knight\\" and entirely avoided mentioning Josephine Earp or Blaylock. A number of Hollywood movies have been directly and indirectly influenced by Lake's book and its depiction of Earp's role as a western lawman. The book drew considerable positive attention and established Lake as a western screenwriter for years to come. It also established the gunfight at the O.K. Corral in the public consciousness and Earp as a fearless lawman in the American Old West. The book \\"is now regarded more as fiction than fact\\", \\"an imaginative hoax, a fabrication mixed with just enough fact to give it credibility\\". = Reputation as a teetotaler = Josephine Earp worked hard to create an image of Wyatt as a teetotaler, but as a saloon owner and gambler, he drank occasionally as well. When Flood and Lake wrote their biographies, Prohibition was in force. Among the other facts Josephine wanted scrubbed from Earp's history, was that he liked a drink. She persuaded biographers Flood, Lake and Burns to write that Earp was a non- drinker. A good friend of Earp's, Charlie Welsh, was known to disappear for days at a time \\"to see property\\", the family euphemism for a drinking binge, and Earp was his regular partner. Director John Ford said that whenever Josephine left town for religious conventions, Earp would come into town, play poker, and get drunk with the cowboy actors. = Colt Buntline Special = In his book, Lake wrote about the Colt Buntline Special, a variant of the long- barreled Colt Single Action Army revolver. According to Lake's biography, dime novelist Ned Buntline had five Buntline Specials commissioned. Lake described them as extra-long Colt Single Action Army revolvers with barrels. Buntline was supposed to have presented them to lawmen in thanks for their help with contributing \\"local color\\" to his western yarns. According to Lake, the revolver was equipped with a detachable metal shoulder stock. Lake wrote that Earp and four other well-known western lawmen‚ÄîBat Masterson, Bill Tilghman, Charlie Bassett and Neal Brown‚Äîeach received a Buntline Special. However, neither Tilghman nor Brown were lawmen then. Researchers have never found any record of an order received by the Colt company, and Ned Buntline's alleged connections to Earp's have been largely discredited. After the publication of Lake's book, various Colt revolvers with long (10\\" or 16\\") barrels were referred to as \\"Colt Buntlines\\". Colt re-introduced the revolvers in its second generation revolvers produced after 1956. The Buntline Special was further popularized by The Life and Legend of Wyatt Earp television series. = Dubious claims by Earp = Earp's reputation has been confused by inaccurate, conflicting, and false stories told about him by others, and by his own claims that cannot be corroborated. For example, in an interview with a reporter in Denver in 1896, he denied that he had killed Johnny Ringo. He then flipped his story, claiming he had killed Ringo. In 1888, he was interviewed by an agent of California historian Hubert H. Bancroft, and Earp claimed that he had killed \\"over a dozen stage robbers, murderers, and cattle thieves\\". In about 1918 he told Forrestine Hooker, who wrote an unpublished manuscript, and then Frank Lockwood, who wrote Pioneer Days in Arizona in 1932, that he was the one who killed Johnny Ringo as he left Arizona in 1882. However, Earp included details that do not match what is known about Ringo's death. Earp repeated that claim to at least three other people. At the hearing following the Tombstone shootout, Earp said he had been marshal in Dodge City, a claim he repeated in an August 16, 1896, interview that appeared in The San Francisco Examiner. But Earp had only been an assistant city marshal there. During an interview with his future biographer Stuart Lake during the late 1920s, Earp said that he arrested notorious gunslinger Ben Thompson in Ellsworth, Kansas, on August 15, 1873, when news accounts and Thompson's own contemporary account about the episode do not mention his presence. He also told Lake that he had hunted buffalo during 1871 and 1872, but Earp was arrested three times in the Peoria area during that period for \\"Keeping and being found in a house of ill-fame.\\" He was arrested and jailed on a horse theft charge on April 6, 1871. However he was not convicted of the last charge and was released. In the same interview, Earp claimed that George Hoyt had intended to kill him, although newspaper accounts from that time report differently. He also said he and Bat Masterson had confronted Clay Allison when he was sent to Dodge City to finish George Hoyt's job, and that they had forced him to back down. Two other accounts contradicted Earp, crediting cattleman Dick McNulty and Long Branch Saloon owner Chalk Beeson with convincing Allison and his cowboys to surrender their guns. Cowboy Charlie Siringo witnessed the incident and left a written account.  Modern image  = Role in O.K. Corral gunfight= Wyatt outlived his brothers, and due to the fame Wyatt gained from Lake's biography and later adaptations of it, he is often mistakenly viewed as the central character and hero of the gunfight at the O.K. Corral. In fact, Virgil Earp, as Deputy U.S. Marshal and Tombstone City Marshal, actually held the legal authority in Tombstone the day of the shootout. Virgil had considerably more experience with weapons and combat as a Union soldier in the Civil War, and in law enforcement as a sheriff, constable, and marshal than did Wyatt. As city marshal, Virgil made the decision to enforce a city ordinance prohibiting carrying weapons in town and to disarm the Cowboys. Wyatt was only a temporary assistant marshal to his brother. = Cultural image as Western lawman = Earp's modern-day reputation is that of the Old West's \\"toughest and deadliest gunman of his day\\". He is \\"a cultural icon, a man of law and order, a mythic figure of a West where social control and order were notably absent\\". Due to Lake's fanciful biography and because Wyatt outlived all of his brothers, his name became famous and he is the primary figure in many movies, TV shows, biographies and works of fiction. Western historian and author John Boessenecker describes Earp: = Josephine Earp memoir = One of the most well known and for many years respected books about Wyatt Earp was the book I Married Wyatt Earp, originally credited as a factual memoir by Josephine Marcus Earp. Published in 1976, it was edited by amateur historian Glenn Boyer, and published by the respected University of Arizona Press. It was immensely popular for many years, capturing the imagination of people with an interest in western history, studied in classrooms, cited by scholars, and relied upon as factual by filmmakers. In 1998, writer Tony Ortega wrote a lengthy investigative article for the Phoenix New Times for which he interviewed Boyer. Boyer said that he was uninterested in what others thought of the accuracy of what he had written. \\"This is an artistic effort. I don't have to adhere to the kind of jacket that these people are putting on me. I am not a historian. I'm a storyteller.\\"Boyer admitted that the book is \\"100 percent Boyer\\". He said the book was not really a first-person account, that he had interpreted Wyatt Earp in Josephine's voice, and admitted that he could not produce any documents to vindicate his methods. Boyer and the University Press' credibility was severely damaged. In 2000 the university referred all questions to university lawyers who investigated some of the allegations about Boyer's work. Later that year the Press removed the book from their catalog. The book has been discredited as a fraud and a hoax that cannot be relied on. As a result, other works by Boyer were subsequently questioned. His book, Wyatt Earp's Tombstone Vendetta, published in 1993, was according to Boyer based on an account written by a previously unknown Tombstone journalist that he named \\"Theodore Ten Eyck\\", but whose identity could not be independently verified. Boyer claimed that the manuscript was \\"clearly authentic\\" and that it contained \\"fascinating revelations (if they are true) and would make an ace movie\\". Boyer later said the character was in fact a blend of \\"scores of accounts\\", but could not provide any sources. History professor William Urban also described \\"the questionable scholarship of Glenn Boyer, the dominant figure in Earpiana for the past several decades, who has apparently invented a manuscript and then cited it as a major source in his publications. This does not surprise this reviewer, who has personal experience with Boyer's pretentious exaggeration of his acquaintance with Warren County records.\\" See also *Wyatt Earp in popular culture  References   Further reading * Barra, Allen.

He refused to allow King Charles I or any member of his entourage to enter the town, thereby depriving the king of access to the large arsenal contained within. Later in the Civil War he and his son John Hotham the younger were accused of treachery to the Parliamentarian cause, found guilty and executed on Tower Hill.Debrett's Peerage, 1968, p.591 Origins He was born in 1589probably in July 1589, Scott,2008 the second but only surviving sonHealy of John Hotham (1540‚Äì1609) of Scorborough, who in 1584 had been elected a Member of Parliament for Scarborough in Yorkshire. His mother has been variously given as Julian Stanhope, a daughter of Sir Michael Stanhope of Shelford, Nottinghamshire or as Jane Legard, a daughter of Richard Legard of Rysome, Yorkshire.Scott; Healy Career He fought on the continent of Europe during the early part of the Thirty Years' War. In 1622 he was made a baronet. He was elected a Member of Parliament for Beverley in the five Parliaments between 1625 and 1640, and served as Sheriff of Yorkshire in 1634. In 1639 he was deprived by the king of his office of Governor of Hull, and joining the parliamentary party, he refused to pay ship-money. In January 1642 Hotham was ordered by Parliament to seize the town of Hull, where there was a large store of munitions of war; this was at once carried out by his son John Hotham the younger. Hotham senior took command of Hull and in April 1642 refused to admit King Charles I to the town. Later he promised his prisoner, George Digby, 2nd Earl of Bristol, that he would surrender the town to the king, but when Charles appeared again he refused a second time and drove away the besiegers. Meanwhile, Hotham the younger was taking an active part in the Civil War in Yorkshire and Lincolnshire, but was soon at variance with other parliamentary leaders, especially with Lord Fairfax and his son Sir Thomas Fairfax, and complaints about his conduct and that of his troops were made by Oliver Cromwell and by Colonel John Hutchinson. Soon both the Hothams were corresponding with the Earl of Newcastle, and Hotham the younger was probably ready to betray Hull; these proceedings became known to Parliament, and in June 1643 father and son were captured and taken to London. Death and burial Monument to Sir John Hotham in St Mary's Church, South Dalton (near Scorborough),http://www.daltonestate.co.uk/history supported by figures of the cardinal virtues After a long delay they were tried by court-martial, were found guilty and were sentenced to death. The younger Hotham was beheaded at Tower Hill on 2 January 1645, and despite of efforts made by the House of Lords and the Presbyterians to save him, his father suffered the same fate on the following day. Both were buried at the nearby church of All Hallows-by- the-Tower. A tomb monument was erected in his memory in St Mary's Church, South Dalton. The baronetcy passed to Sir John's grandson Sir John Hotham, 2nd Baronet, the son of Hotham the younger. =Marriages and children= Sir John married five times and had sixteen children of whom six sons and three daughters survived childhood. *Firstly, on 16 February 1607, to Katherine Rodes, daughter of Sir John Rodes of Barlborough, Derbyshire.

Reynaud opposed the Munich agreements of September 1938, when France and the United Kingdom gave way before Hitler's proposals for the dismemberment of Czechoslovakia.S√âVILLIA,JEAN, Histoire Passionn√©e de la France, Perrin, 2013, p. 416 After the outbreak of World War II Reynaud became the penultimate Prime Minister of the Third Republic in March 1940. He was also vice-president of the Democratic Republican Alliance center-right party. Reynaud was Prime Minister during the German defeat of France in May and June 1940; he persistently refused to support an armistice with Germany, as premier in June 1940, he unsuccessfully attempted to save France from German occupation in World War II, Paul Reynaud  premier of France  Britannica and resigned on 16 June. After unsuccessfully attempting to flee France, he was arrested by Philippe Petain's administration. Surrendering to German custody in 1942, he was imprisoned in Germany and later Austria until liberation in 1945. Elected to the Chamber of Deputies in 1946, he became a prominent figure again in French political life, serving in several cabinet positions. He favoured a United States of Europe, and participated in drafting the constitution for the Fifth Republic, but resigned from government in 1962 after disagreement with President de Gaulle over changes to the electoral system. Early life and politics Reynaud was born in Barcelonnette, Alpes-de-Haute-Provence, the son of Alexandre and Amelie (n√©e Gassier) Reynaud. His father had made a fortune in the textile industry, enabling Reynaud to study law at the Sorbonne. He entered politics and was elected to the French Chamber of Deputies from 1919 to 1924, representing Basses-Alpes, and again from 1928, representing a Paris district. Although he was first elected as part of the conservative \\"Blue Horizon\\"the colour of French Army uniforms at the time - many of the new deputies were war veterans bloc in 1919, Reynaud shortly thereafter switched his allegiance to the centre-right Democratic Republican Alliance party, later becoming its vice-president. In the 1920s, Reynaud developed a reputation for laxity on German reparations, at a time when many in the French government backed harsher terms for Germany. In the 1930s during the Great Depression, particularly after 1933, Reynaud's stance hardened against the Germans at a time when all nations were struggling economically. Reynaud backed a strong alliance with the United Kingdom and, unlike many others on the French Right, better relations with the Soviet Union as a counterweight against the Germans.Imlay, Talbot C. \\"Paul Reynaud and France's Response to Nazi Germany, 1938‚Äì1940,\\" French Historical Studies 26.3 (2003) Reynaud held several cabinet posts in the early 1930s, but he clashed with members of his party after 1932 over French foreign and defense policy. In June 1934, Reynaud defended in the Chamber of Deputies the need to devaluate the French franc, whose belonging to the gold standard was increasingly harmful for the French economy, but in those years the French public opinion was opposed to any devaluation SAUVY, ALFRED, Histoire √âconomique de la France entre les deux guerres (3 volumes), Paris, Fayard, 1984, Vol.I, p.143 He was not given another cabinet position until 1938. Like Winston Churchill, Reynaud was a maverick in his party and often alone in his calls for rearmament and resistance to German aggrandizement. Reynaud was a supporter of Charles de Gaulle's theories of mechanized warfare in contrast to the static defense doctrines that were in vogue among many of his countrymen, symbolized by the Maginot Line. He strongly opposed appeasement in the run-up to the Second World War. He also clashed with his party on economic policy, backing the devaluation of the franc as a solution to France's economic woes. Pierre √âtienne Flandin, the leader of the Democratic Republican Alliance, agreed with several of Reynaud's key policy stances, particularly on Reynaud's defence of economic liberalism. The franc was devalued, in a range between 25% and 34%, by the Popular Front government presided by Leon Blum on 1 October 1936.SAUVY, ALFRED, Histoire √âconomique de la France entre les deux guerres (3 volumes), Paris, Fayard, 1984, Vol.I, p.268 Return to government Reynaud returned to the cabinet in 1938 as Minister of Finance under √âdouard Daladier. The Sudeten Crisis, which began not long after Reynaud was named Minister of Justice, again revealed the divide between Reynaud and the rest of the Alliance D√©mocratique; Reynaud adamantly opposed abandoning the Czechs to the Germans, while Flandin felt that allowing Germany to expand eastward would inevitably lead to a conflict with the Soviets that would weaken both. Reynaud publicly made his case, and in response Flandin pamphleted Paris in order to pressure the government to agree to Hitler's demands. Reynaud subsequently left his party to become an independent. However, Reynaud still had the support of Daladier, whose politique de fermet√© (\\"policy of firmness\\") was very similar to Reynaud's notion of deterrence. Reynaud, however, had always wanted the Finance ministry. He endorsed radically liberal economic policies in order to draw France's economy out of stagnation, centered on a massive program of deregulation, including the elimination of the forty-hour work week. The notion of deregulation was very popular among France's businessmen, and Reynaud believed that it was the best way for France to regain investors' confidence again and escape the stagnation its economy had fallen into. The collapse of L√©on Blum's government in 1938 was a response to Blum's attempt to expand the regulatory powers of the French government; there was therefore considerable support in the French government for an alternative approach like Reynaud's. Paul Marchandeau, Daladier's first choice for finance minister, offered a limited program of economic reform that was not to Daladier's satisfaction; Reynaud and Marchandeau swapped portfolios, and Reynaud went ahead with his radical liberalization reforms. Reynaud's reforms were implemented, and the government faced down a one-day strike in opposition. Reynaud addressed France's business community, arguing that \\"We live in a capitalist system. For it to function we must obey its laws. These are the laws of profits, individual risk, free markets, and growth by competition.\\" With Reynaud as Minister of Finance, the confidence of the investors returned and the French economy recovered.MOUR√â, KENNETH and ALEXANDER, MARTIN S., Crisis and Renewal in France, 1918-1962, Berghahn Books, New York-Oxford, 2002, p.79 Reynaud's reforms involved a massive austerity program (although armament measures were not cut). At the outbreak of war, however, Reynaud was not bullish on France's economy; he felt that the massive increase in spending that a war entailed would stamp out France's recovery. The French Right was ambivalent about the war in late 1939 and early 1940, feeling that the Soviets rather than Nazi Germany were the greater long-term threat. Daladier regarded the war with Germany as the greater priority and so refused to send aid to the Finns, who were under attack from the USSR, then loosely allied to Germany, in the Winter War. News that the Finns had sued for peace in March 1940 prompted Flandin and Pierre Laval to hold secret sessions of the legislature that denounced Daladier's actions; the government fell on 19 March. The government named Reynaud Prime Minister of France two days later. Prime minister, resignation, and arrest =Appointment= Although Reynaud was increasingly popular, the Chamber of Deputies elected him premier by only a single vote with most of his own party abstaining; over half of the votes for Reynaud came from the French Section of the Workers' International (SFIO) party. With so much support from the left, and opposition from many parties on the right, Reynaud's government was especially unstable; many on the Right demanded that Reynaud attack not Germany, but the Soviet Union. The Chamber also forced Daladier, whom Reynaud held personally responsible for France's weakness, to be Reynaud's Minister of National Defense and War. One of Reynaud's first acts was at a meeting of the Anglo-French Supreme War Council held in London on 28 March 1940, whose main outcome was the signing of a declaration with British Prime Minister Neville Chamberlain that neither of the two countries would sign a separate peace. A joint communiqu√© declared 'Both Governments mutually undertake that during the present war they will neither negotiate nor conclude an armistice or treaty of peace except by mutual agreement. They undertake to maintain after conclusion of peace a community of action for so long as may be necessary'. Present and Future Plans (Time Magazine, 8 April 1940) Retrieved 2008-10-22 On 15 June 1940 the French cabinet rejected a British proposal , imagined by Jean Monnet and defended by De Gaulle, for the union of both countries.S√âVILLIA,JEAN, Histoire Passionn√©e de la France, Perrin, 2013, p. 420 Reynaud abandoned any notion of a \\"long war strategy\\" based on attrition. Aiming at diverting German attentions from France, Reynaud entertained suggestions to expand the war to the Balkans or northern Europe; he was instrumental in launching the allied campaign in Norway, though it ended in failure. Britain's decision to withdraw on 26 April prompted Reynaud to travel to London to lobby the British personally to stand and fight in Norway. =The German breakthrough= The Battle of France began less than two months after Reynaud came to office. France was badly mauled by the initial attack in early May 1940, and Paris was threatened. On 15 May, five days after the invasion began, Reynaud contacted Churchill and famously remarked, \\"We have been defeated... we are beaten; we have lost the battle.... The front is broken near Sedan.\\" Indeed, such was the situation regarding equipment and morale that Reynaud received a postcard found on the body of an officer who had committed suicide in Le Mans. It stated: \\"I am killing myself Mr President\\"President\\" in this context means \\"President of the Council of Ministers\\", the official title of the Prime Minister of France, not the President of the Republic to let you know that all my men were brave, but one cannot send men to fight tanks with rifles.\\"Regan, Geoffrey. Military Anecdotes - The End of The Line (1992) p.159 On 18 May Reynaud removed commander-in-chief Maurice Gamelin in favour of Maxime Weygand. On 26 May, around lunchtime, Reynaud attended a meeting in London with Churchill. At 2 pm Churchill reported to the War Cabinet that Reynaud had stated that the French military situation was hopeless, that he had no intention of signing a separate peace with Germany, but that he might be forced to resign and that others in the French government might sign such a treaty. At this stage Churchill told Reynaud that he did not rule out talks with Mussolini altogether (Italy was still neutral). The Foreign Secretary Lord Halifax met Reynaud later in the afternoon, before the latter‚Äôs return to France. This was the beginning of the British May 1940 War Cabinet Crisis, in which Halifax favoured what was euphemistically described as \\"the Reynaud Option\\": approaching the Italians to see if acceptable peace terms could be negotiated, perhaps by giving up some British territory in the Mediterranean. Halifax was eventually overruled by Churchill.Roberts, A. (1991). The Holy Fox, The Life of Lord Halifax. London: Phoenix, 1991. On 28 May Churchill sent a telegram to Reynaud stating that there would be no approach to Mussolini at that time but still leaving the possibility open. Mussolini had rejected an approach by President Roosevelt along the lines suggested by Britain and France. On 28 May, it was learned that Italy was planning to enter the war on Germany's side, which would happen on 10 June. In early June Charles de Gaulle, whom Reynaud had long supported and one of the few French commanders to have fought the Germans successfully in May 1940, was promoted to brigadier general and named undersecretary of war. =Support for an armistice; Reynaud's resignation= Reynaud vacillated a little on his return from London on 26 May, but otherwise wanted to continue to fight. However, he was unable to persuade enough of his colleagues.Jackson, J. (2003). The Fall of France. Oxford University Press, Oxford. . Italy entered the war on 10 June; on that same day, Commander-in-Chief General Weygand strode into Reynaud‚Äôs office and demanded an armistice. At around 11 pm that night Reynaud and de Gaulle left Paris for Tours; the rest of the government followed the next day. De Gaulle was unable to persuade Reynaud to sack Weygand.Lacouture, J. (1984). De Gaulle: The Rebel 1890‚Äì1944. English ed. 1990, W W Norton & Co, London. At the Anglo-French conference at the Chateau du Muguet, Briare, on 11‚Äì12 June, Churchill urged the French to carry on fighting, either in Brittany or in French North Africa, or by guerrilla warfare, meeting strong resistance from Deputy Prime Minister Marshal P√©tain. At the Cabinet meeting on the evening of 12 June it was clear that there was a growing movement for an armistice, and it was decided to move to Bordeaux rather than to a fortified Brittany. At the next Anglo-French conference at Tours on 13 June, Reynaud demanded that France be released from the agreement which he had made with Prime Minister Neville Chamberlain in March 1940, so that France could seek an armistice. Churchill said that he \\"understood\\" the French action but (contrary to later claims that he approved) that he did not agree with it. At the Cabinet meeting that evening (Churchill had returned to London rather than address the French Cabinet as Reynaud had wished) P√©tain strongly supported Weygand‚Äôs demand for an armistice, and said that he himself would remain in France to share the suffering of the French people and to begin the national rebirth. President Albert Lebrun refused Reynaud‚Äôs resignation on 13 June. Edward Spears recorded that Reynaud was, from the evening of 13 June, under great stress. Paul Baudouin and Marie-Joseph Paul de Villelume had been leaning on Reynaud to seek an armistice with Germany, as had his mistress, the Comtesse H√©l√®ne de Portes, a Fascist sympathizerPelayo, D. (2009) L'accident de Paul Reynaud. l'Agglorieuse On 14 June Villelume and de Portes called on the American diplomat Anthony Joseph Drexel Biddle Jr. and stated that France had no alternative but to seek an armistice and that they were speaking on behalf of Reynaud, although Biddle did not believe them. At Cabinet on 15 June, Reynaud urged the Cabinet to adopt the Dutch example, that the Army should lay down its arms so that the fight could be continued from abroad; P√©tain was sympathetic.Atkin, N. (1997). P√©tain, Longman, P√©tain was sent to speak to General Weygand (who was waiting outside, as he was not a member of the Cabinet).Williams, C. (2005). P√©tain, Little Brown (Time Warner Book Group UK), London, Weygand persuaded him that this would be a shameful surrender. Chautemps then suggested a fudge proposal, an inquiry about terms. The Cabinet voted 13-6 for the Chautemps proposal. Reynaud tried to resign on the spot but Lebrun shouted at him. Admiral Darlan, who had been opposed to an armistice until 15 June, now agreed, provided the French fleet was kept out of German hands. On 15 June, Reynaud threw two glasses of water over de Portes at dinner; a key telegram had been found in her bed after it went missing. On 16 June de Portes kept putting her head around the door during a meeting and US diplomats testified that she was constantly coming and going from Reynaud‚Äôs office. President Roosevelt's reply to Reynaud's inquiry, stating that he could do little to help without Congressional approval, was then received on the morning of Sunday 16 June. Churchill‚Äôs telegram also arrived that morning, agreeing to an armistice provided the French fleet was moved to British ports, a proposal unacceptable to Darlan, who argued that it would leave France defenceless. De Gaulle was in London for talks about the planned Franco- British Union that afternoon. He telephoned Reynaud to inform him the British Cabinet had agreed. The French Cabinet then met in Bordeaux. Reynaud wanted to fight on; he and Georges Mandel were among the few in the cabinet to support the proposal. Contrary to Lebrun‚Äôs mistaken recollection, no formal vote appears to have been taken at Cabinet on Sunday 16 June. The outcome of the meeting is unclear. Ten ministers wanted to fight on while seven favoured an armistice, though these included the two Deputy Prime Ministers: P√©tain and Chautemps. An armistice was also favoured by Weygand. Another eight ministers were undecided, but ultimately swung towards an armistice. This time, Lebrun reluctantly accepted Reynaud‚Äôs resignation. De Gaulle later wrote that Reynaud was \\"a man of great worth unjustly crushed by events beyond measure\\". =After resignation= Julian Jackson writes that Reynaud felt guilty for 20 years for having let P√©tain into power, and gave ever more convoluted explanations of what had happened: despite his own fighting spirit, apart from a brief vacillation on 26 May, \\"he had failed to be Clemenceau (France's great war Prime Minister of 1917-18), but missed the chance to be de Gaulle and never forgave himself\\". Reynaud later claimed that he had hoped P√©tain would resign if the armistice terms were too harsh, which if true was wishful thinking in Jackson‚Äôs view. There were claims that he could have mustered a majority in the Cabinet for fighting on, so he later claimed that he could not have argued against the political weight of the \\"softs\\", especially P√©tain and Weygand, France‚Äôs two leading soldiers. Spears recorded that Reynaud appeared relieved to be rid of his burden. In the immediate aftermath, he appears to have been in denial, hoping still to meet Churchill at Concarneau on 17 June (in fact Churchill, who was at Waterloo Station, had cancelled his travel plans on learning of Reynaud‚Äôs resignation). Jules Jeanneney and Edouard Herriot, Presidents respectively of the Senate and the Chamber of Deputies, urged Lebrun to reappoint Reynaud as Prime Minister (all four men wanted to continue the war from North Africa). Lebrun felt he had little choice but to appoint P√©tain, who already had a ministerial team ready, as Prime Minister. P√©tain became the leader of the new government (the last one of the Third Republic), and signed the armistice on 22 June. De Gaulle had returned to Bordeaux at around 10pm on 16 June. He visited Reynaud, who still hoped to go to North Africa and declined to come to London. Reynaud still had control of secret government funds until the handover of power the next day, and made money available to de Gaulle. De Gaulle flew to London with Edward Spears at 9 a.m. on 17 June, and the next day made his famous broadcast announcing that he would fight on. It has been suggested that Reynaud had ordered de Gaulle to go to London, but no written evidence has ever been found to confirm this. Reynaud would later provisionally accept P√©tain‚Äôs offer of the post of French Ambassador to the USA. Lebrun refused to confirm the appointment, apparently as he admired Reynaud and wanted to save him from association with the P√©tain government. =Accident and arrest= Reynaud's car after the accident Reynaud and de Portes left the Hotel Splendid, Bordeaux, driving southeast ahead of the advancing German armies, intending to stop at Reynaud's holiday home at Gr√®s, H√©rault, (other sources state they were bound for his daughter's home at Sainte-MaximeAnon. (1940). M. Paul Reynaud victime d'un accident d'automobile. Le Petit Meridional, 29 Juin 1940.) before fleeing to North Africa. On 28 June, with Reynaud at the wheel, their Renault Juvaquatre car inexplicably left the road and hit a plane tree at la Peyrade, near S√®te; de Portes was all but decapitated while Reynaud escaped with relatively minor head injuries.Benoit-M√©chin, J. (1956). Soixante jours qui √©branl√®rent l'Occident : Volume 3, La Fin du r√©gime - 26 juin / 10 juillet 1940, p.46. Laffont, Paris. Photo of the car wreck, under year '1940', in Chronologie La Peyrade While hospitalized at Montpellier, Reynaud allegedly told Bill Bullitt, American ambassador, \\"I have lost my country, my honour, and my love.\\"Moss, N. (2003). 19 Weeks. Houghton Mifflin Harcourt, New York. . Reynaud was arrested on his discharge on P√©tain's orders and imprisoned at Fort du Portalet. P√©tain decided against having Reynaud charged during the Riom Trial of 1942, but handed him over to the Germans instead, who removed him firstly to Sachsenhausen concentration camp, thence Itter Castle near W√∂rgl, Austria, where he remained with other high-profile French prisoners until liberated by Allied troops on 7 May 1945. Major Josef Gangl, a Wehrmacht officer who had gone over to the anti-Nazi Austrian resistance, was killed by a sniper's bullet while trying to move Reynaud out of harm's way during the Battle for Castle Itter on 5 May 1945. Postwar career After the war, Reynaud was elected in 1946 as a member of the Chamber of Deputies. He was appointed to several cabinet positions in the postwar period and remained a prominent figure in French politics. His attempts to form governments in 1952 and 1953 in the turbulent politics of the French Fourth Republic were unsuccessful. Reynaud supported the idea of a United States of Europe, along with a number of prominent contemporaries. Reynaud presided over the consultative committee that drafted the constitution of France's (current) Fifth Republic. In 1962, he denounced his old friend de Gaulle's replacement of the electoral college system by a direct public vote for the Presidency. Reynaud left office the same year. Appearance and private life Reynaud was a physically small man, with \\"the countenance of a samurai who had been educated at Cambridge\\". His head was set deep between his shoulders, and he had \\"a sharp, nasal, metallic voice\\" and \\"mechanical\\" bearing. By his first marriage in 1912 to Jeanne Anne Henri-Robert, he was the father of a daughter, Collette, born in 1914. At some time in the early 1920s, Reynaud was introduced to H√©l√®ne Rebuffel by Andre Tardieu, a friend of her father's. Rebuffel's father, however, was displeased at her relationship with a married man, actively seeking other suitors for her, and she was eventually persuaded to marry the Italian Comte Henri de Portes. After she had borne him two children, the marriage failed, and when Reynaud and his wife separated in 1938, H√©l√®ne de Portes was his mistress until her death in the road accident at Frontignan in 1940. Reynaud and his first wife were finally divorced in 1949. Reynaud then married Christiane Mabire (one of his former office assistants, who had voluntarily joined him at the Castle Itter in 1943) at Versailles in the same year, at the age of 71. Mabire had already borne him a son, Serge Paul-Reynaud, in 1945; they had two more children, Evelyne, in 1949, and Alexandre in 1954.Kapfer, E. (2017).

It is the easternmost peak of a ridge crest that extends across the M√∂nch to the Jungfrau at , constituting one of the most emblematic sights of the Swiss Alps. While the northern side of the mountain rises more than 3,000 m (10,000 ft) above the two valleys of Grindelwald and Lauterbrunnen, the southern side faces the large glaciers of the Jungfrau-Aletsch area, the most glaciated region in the Alps. The most notable feature of the Eiger is its nearly north face of rock and ice, named Eiger-Nordwand, Eigerwand or just Nordwand, which is the biggest north face in the Alps. This huge face towers over the resort of Kleine Scheidegg at its base, on the homonymous pass connecting the two valleys. The first ascent of the Eiger was made by Swiss guides Christian Almer and Peter Bohren and Irishman Charles Barrington, who climbed the west flank on August 11, 1858. The north face, the \\"last problem\\" of the Alps, considered amongst the most challenging and dangerous ascents, was first climbed in 1938 by an Austrian- German expedition.Reinhold Messner, The Big Walls: From the North Face of the Eiger to the South Face of Dhaulagiri, p. 41 The Eiger has been highly publicized for the many tragedies involving climbing expeditions. Since 1935, at least sixty-four climbers have died attempting the north face, earning it the German nickname Mordwand, literally \\"murder(ous) wall\\"‚Äîa pun on its correct title of Nordwand (North Wall). Although the summit of the Eiger can be reached by experienced climbers only, a railway tunnel runs inside the mountain, and two internal stations provide easy access to viewing-windows carved into the rock face. They are both part of the Jungfrau Railway line, running from Kleine Scheidegg to the Jungfraujoch, between the M√∂nch and the Jungfrau, at the highest railway station in Europe. The two stations within the Eiger are Eigerwand (behind the north face) and Eismeer (behind the south face), at around 3,000 metres. Since 2016 the Eigerwand station is not regularly served any more. Etymology The first mention of Eiger, appearing as \\"mons Egere\\", was found in a property sale document of 1252, but there is no clear indication of how exactly the peak gained its name. The three mountains of the ridge are commonly referred to as the Virgin (German: Jungfrau ‚Äì translates to \\"virgin\\" or \\"maiden\\"), the Monk (M√∂nch), and the Ogre (Eiger; the standard German word for ogre is Oger). The name has been linked to the Latin term acer, meaning \\"sharp\\" or \\"pointed\\". Geographic setting and description Aerial view of the Eiger (NW) The northeast side of the Eiger The Eiger is located above the Lauterbrunnen Valley to the west and Grindelwald to the north in the Bernese Oberland region of the canton of Bern. It forms a renowned mountain range of the Bernese Alps together with its two companions: the Jungfrau () about southwest of it and the M√∂nch () about in the middle of them.https://www.nytimes.com/2019/10/11/travel/alps-glaciers- climate-change.html The nearest settlements are Grindelwald, Lauterbrunnen () and Wengen (). The Eiger has three faces: north (or more precisely NNW), east (or more precisely ESE), and west (or more precisely WSW). The northeastern ridge from the summit to the Ostegg (lit.: eastern corner, ), called Mittellegi, is the longest on the Eiger. The north face overlooks the gently raising Alpine meadow between Grindelwald () and Kleine Scheidegg (), a mountain railways junction and a pass, which can be reached from both sides, Grindelwald and Lauterbrunnen/Wengen ‚Äì by foot or train. Politically, the Eiger (and its summit) belongs to the Bernese municipalities of Grindelwald and Lauterbrunnen. The Kleine Scheidegg (literally, the small parting corner) connects the M√§nnlichen-Tschuggen range with the western ridge of the Eiger. The Eiger does not properly form part of the main chain of the Bernese Alps, which borders the canton of Valais and forms the watershed between the Rhine and the Rh√¥ne, but constitutes a huge limestone buttress, projecting from the crystalline basement of the M√∂nch across the Eigerjoch. Consequently, all sides of the Eiger feed finally the same river, namely the L√ºtschine. Siegfried Map Eiger's water is connected through the Weisse L√ºtschine (the white one) in the Lauterbrunnen Valley on the west side (southwestern face of the Eiger), and through the Schwarze L√ºtschine (the black one) running through Grindelwald (northwestern face), which meet each other in Zweil√ºtschinen (lit.: the two L√ºtschinen) where they form the proper L√ºtschine. The east face is covered by the glacier called Ischmeer, (Bernese German for Ice Sea), which forms one upper part of the fast-retreating Lower Grindelwald Glacier. These glaciers' water forms a short creek, which is also confusingly called the Weisse L√ºtschine, but enters the black one already in Grindelwald together with the water from the Upper Grindelwald Glacier. Therefore, all the water running down the Eiger converges at the northern foot of the M√§nnlichen () in Zweil√ºtschinen (), about northwest of the summit, where the L√ºtschine begins its northern course to Lake Brienz and the Aare (). Although the north face of the Eiger is almost free of ice, significant glaciers lie at the other sides of the mountain. The Eiger Glacier flows on the southwestern side of the Eiger, from the crest connecting it to the M√∂nch down to , south of Eigergletscher railway station, and feeds the Weisse L√ºtschine through the Tr√ºmmelbach. On the east side, the Ischmeer‚Äìwell visible from the windows of Eismeer railway station‚Äìflows eastwards from the same crest then turns to the north below the impressive wide Fiescherwand, the north face of the Fiescherh√∂rner triple summit () down to about of the Lower Grindelwald Glacier system. The massive composition of the Eiger, M√∂nch, and Jungfrau constitutes an emblematic sight of the Swiss Alps and is visible from many places on the Swiss Plateau and the Jura Mountains in the northwest. The higher Finsteraarhorn () and Aletschhorn (), which are located about to the south, are generally less visible and situated in the middle of glaciers in less accessible areas. As opposed to the north side, the south and east sides of the range consist of large valley glaciers extending for up to , the largest (beyond the Eiger drainage basin) being those of Grand Aletsch, Fiesch, and Aar Glaciers, and is thus uninhabited. The whole area, the Jungfrau-Aletsch protected area, comprising the highest summits and largest glaciers of the Bernese Alps, was inscribed as a UNESCO World Heritage Site in 2001. In July 2006, a piece of the Eiger, amounting to approximately 700,000 cubic metres of rock, fell from the east face. As it had been noticeably cleaving for several weeks and fell into an uninhabited area, there were no injuries and no buildings were hit. The Eiger with the M√∂nch and the Jungfrau North face  North face The Nordwand, German for \\"north wall\\" or \\"north face,\\" is the north face of the Eiger (also known as the Eigernordwand: \\"Eiger north wall\\" or Eigerwand). It is one of the three great north faces of the Alps, along with the north faces of the Matterhorn and the Grandes Jorasses (known as 'the Trilogy') and also one of the biggest sheer face in Europe, between 1,600 m and 1,800 m (over a mile) high. The face overlooks Kleine Scheidegg and the valley of Grindelwald. At 2,866 metres inside the mountain lies the Eigerwand railway station. The station is connected to the north face by a tunnel opening at the face, which has sometimes been used to rescue climbers. The Eiger Trail, at the base of the north face, runs from Eigergletscher to Alpiglen railway stations. The approach hike to the base of the face takes less than an hour from Eigergletscher. The windows of the Eigerwand Station Some of the notable features on the north face are (from the bottom): First Pillar, Eigerwand Station, First Ice-field, Hinterstoisser Traverse, Swallow's Nest, Ice Hose, Second Ice-field, Death Bivouac, Ramp, Traverse of the Gods, Spider and Exit Cracks. In 1938, Alpine Journal editor Edward Lisle Strutt calls the face \\"an obsession for the mentally deranged\\" and \\"the most imbecile variant since mountaineering first began.\\"From Strutt's Presidential Valedictory Address, 1938, in Alpine Journal, Vol. L, reprinted in Peaks, Passes and Glaciers, ed. Walt Unsworth, London: Allen Lane, 1981, p. 210 In the same year, however, the north face was finally climbed on July 24 by Andreas Heckmair, Ludwig V√∂rg, Heinrich Harrer and Fritz Kasparek, a German‚ÄìAustrian group. The group had originally consisted of two independent teams; Harrer and Kasparek were joined on the face by Heckmair and V√∂rg, who had started their ascent a day later and had been helped by the fixed rope that the lead group had left across the Hinterstoisser Traverse. The two groups, led by the experienced Heckmair, cooperated on the more difficult later pitches, and finished the climb roped together as a single group of four. A portion of the upper face is called \\"The White Spider\\", as snow-filled cracks radiating from an ice-field resemble the legs of a spider. Harrer used this name for the title of his book about his successful climb, Die Weisse Spinne (translated into English as The White Spider: The Classic Account of the Ascent of the Eiger). During the first successful ascent, the four men were caught in an avalanche as they climbed the Spider, but all had enough strength to resist being swept off the face. Since then, the north face has been climbed many times. Today it is regarded as a formidable challenge, not only because of its technical difficulties, exceeeding those of some of the 8,000 m peaks in the Himalaya and Karakoram, but also because of the increased rockfall and diminishing ice-fields.10 Hardest Mountains to Climb in the World Climbers are increasingly electing to challenge the Eiger in winter, when the crumbling face is strengthened by ice. Since 1935, at least sixty-four climbers have died attempting the north face, earning it the German nickname, Mordwand, or \\"murderous wall\\", a play on the face's German name Nordwand. Climbing history View from the railway station of Kleine Scheidegg, close enough to allow people to watch the climbers on the Eiger. While the summit was reached without much difficulty in 1858 by a complex route on the west flank, the battle to climb the north face has captivated the interest of climbers and non-climbers alike. Before it was successfully climbed, most of the attempts on the face ended tragically and the Bernese authorities even banned climbing it and threatened to fine any party that should attempt it again. But the enthusiasm which animated the young talented climbers from Austria and Germany finally vanquished its reputation of unclimbability when a party of four climbers successfully reached the summit in 1938 by what is known as the \\"1938\\" or \\"Heckmair\\" route. The climbers that attempted the north face could be easily watched through the telescopes from the Kleine Scheidegg, a pass between Grindelwald and Lauterbrunnen, connected by rail. The contrast between the comfort and civilization of the railway station and the agonies of the young men slowly dying a short yet uncrossable distance away led to intensive coverage by the international media. After World War II, the north face was climbed twice in 1947, first by a party of two French guides, Louis Lachenal and Lionel Terray, then by a Swiss party consisting of H. Germann, with Hans and Karl Schlunegger.Claire Eliane Engel, A History of Mountaineering in the Alps, 1950 =First ascent= In 1857, a first attempt was made by Christian Almer, Christian Kaufmann, Ulrich Kaufmann guiding the Austrian alpinist Sigismund Porges. They did manage the first ascent of neighboring M√∂nch instead. Porges, however, successfully made the second ascend of the Eiger in July 1861 with the guides Christian Michel, Hans and Peter Baumann.Daniel Anker and Rainer Rettner, Chronology of the Eiger from 1252 to 2013 The first ascent was made by the western flank on August 11, 1858 by Charles Barrington with guides Christian Almer and Peter Bohren. On the previous afternoon, the party walked up to the Wengernalp hotel. From there they started the ascent of the Eiger at 3:30 a.m. Barrington describes the route much as it is followed today, staying close to the edge of the north face much of the way. They reached the summit at about noon, planted a flag, stayed for some 10 minutes and descended in about four hours. Barrington describes the reaching of the top, saying, \\"the two guides kindly gave me the place of first man up.\\" After the descent, the party was escorted to the Kleine Scheidegg hotel, where their ascent was confirmed by observation of the flag left on the summit. The owner of the hotel then fired a cannon to celebrate the first ascent. According to Harrer's The White Spider, Barrington was originally planning to make the first ascent of the Matterhorn, but his finances did not allow him to travel there as he was already staying in the Eiger region. =Mittellegi ridge= The ridge from the Mittellegi Hut Although the Mittellegi ridge had already been descended by climbers (since 1885) with the use of ropes in the difficult sections, it remained unclimbed until 1921. On the 10th of September of that year, Japanese climber Yuko Maki, along with Swiss guides Fritz Amatter, Samuel Brawand and Fritz Steuri made the first successful ascent of the ridge. The previous day, the party approached the ridge from the Eismeer railway station of the Jungfrau Railway and bivouacked for the night. They started the climb at about 6:00 a.m. and reached the summit of the Eiger at about 7:15 p.m., after an over 13 hours gruelling ascent. Shortly after, they descended the west flank. They finally reached Eigergletscher railway station at about 3:00 a.m. the next day.First Ascent of the Eiger's Mittellegi Ridge =Attempts on the north face= 1935 In 1935 two young German climbers from Bavaria, Karl Mehringer and Max Sedlmeyer, arrived at Grindelwald to attempt to climb the face. They waited a long time for good weather and when the clouds finally cleared they started. The two climbers reached the height of the Eigerwand station and made their first bivouac. On the following day, because of the greater difficulties, they gained little height. On the third day they made hardly any vertical ground. That night a storm broke and the mountain was hidden in fog, and then it began to snow. Avalanches of snow began to sweep the face and the clouds closed over it. Two days later, there was a short moment when the clouds cleared and the mountain was visible for a while. The two men were glimpsed, now a little higher and about to bivouac for the fifth time. Then the fog came down again and hid the climbers. A few days later the weather finally cleared, revealing a completely white north face. The two climbers were found later frozen to death at 3,300 m, at a place now known as \\"Death Bivouac\\".The north face of the Eiger mountainzone.com. Retrieved on 2010-03-04 1936 A climber on the Hinterstoisser traverse The next year ten young climbers from Austria and Germany came to Grindelwald and camped at the foot of the mountain. Before their attempts started one of them was killed during a training climb, and the weather was so bad during that summer that, after waiting for a change and seeing none on the way, several members of the party gave up. Of the four that remained, two were Bavarians, Andreas Hinterstoisser and Toni Kurz, and two were Austrians, Willy Angerer and . When the weather improved they made a preliminary exploration of the lowest part of the face. Hinterstoisser fell but was not injured. A few days later the four men finally began the ascent of the face. They climbed quickly, but on the next day, after their first bivouac, the weather changed; clouds came down and hid the group to the observers. They did not resume the climb until the following day, when, during a break, the party was seen descending, but the climbers could be seen only intermittently from the ground. The group had no choice but to retreat, since Angerer had suffered serious injuries from falling rock. The party became stuck on the face when they could not recross the difficult Hinterstoisser Traverse, from which they had taken the rope they had first used to climb it. The weather then deteriorated for two days. They were ultimately swept away by an avalanche, which only Kurz survived, hanging on a rope. Three guides started on an extremely perilous rescue attempt. They failed to reach him but came within shouting distance and learned what had happened. Kurz explained the fate of his companions: one had fallen down the face, another was frozen above him, and the third had fractured his skull in falling and was hanging dead on the rope. In the morning the three guides came back, traversing the face from a hole near the Eigerwand station and risking their lives under incessant avalanches. Toni Kurz was still alive but almost helpless, with one hand and one arm completely frozen. Kurz hauled himself off the cliff after cutting loose the rope that bound him to his dead teammate below and climbed back onto the face. The guides were not able to pass an unclimbable overhang that separated them from Kurz. They managed to give him a rope long enough to reach them by tying two ropes together. While descending, Kurz could not get the knot to pass through his carabiner. He tried for hours to reach his rescuers who were only a few metres below him. Then he began to lose consciousness. One of the guides, climbing on another's shoulders, was able to touch the tip of Kurz's crampons with his ice-axe but could not reach higher. Kurz was unable to descend further and, completely exhausted, died slowly. 1937 An attempt was made in 1937 by and Ludwig V√∂rg. Although the attempt was unsuccessful, they were nonetheless the first climbers who returned alive from a serious attempt on the face. They started the climb on 11 August and reached a high point of a few rope lengths above Death Bivouac. A storm then broke and after three days on the wall they had to retreat. This was the first successful withdrawal from a significant height on the wall.Alptraum der Alpen einestages.spiegel.de.

The two groups, led by the experienced Heckmair, decided to join their forces and roped together as a single group of four. Heckmair later wrote: \\"We, the sons of the older Reich, united with our companions from the Eastern Border to march together to victory.\\" The expedition was constantly threatened by snow avalanches and climbed as quickly as possible between the falls. On the third day a storm broke and the cold was intense. The four men were caught in an avalanche as they climbed \\"the Spider,\\" the snow-filled cracks radiating from an ice-field on the upper face, but all possessed sufficient strength to resist being swept off the face. The members successfully reached the summit at four o'clock in the afternoon. They were so exhausted that they only just had the strength to descend by the normal route through a raging blizzard. =Other notable events= A climber on the second ice-field * 1864 (Jul 27): Fourth ascent, and first ascent by a woman, Lucy Walker, who was part of a group of six guides (including Christian Almer and Melchior Anderegg) and five clients, including her brother Horace Walker * 1871: First ascent by the southwest ridge, 14 July (Christian Almer, Christian Bohren, and Ulrich Almer guiding W.

Daladier was born in Carpentras and began his political career before World War I. During the war, he fought on the Western Front and was decorated for his service. After the war, he became a leading figure in the Radical Party and Prime Minister in 1933 and 1934. Daladier was Minister of Defence from 1936 to 1940 and Prime Minister again in 1938. As head of government, he expanded the French welfare state in 1939. Along with Neville Chamberlain, Benito Mussolini and Adolf Hitler, Daladier signed the Munich Agreement in 1938, which gave Nazi Germany control over the Sudetenland. After Hitler's invasion of Poland in 1939, Britain and France declared war on Germany. During the Phoney War, France's failure to aid Finland against the Soviet Union's invasion during the Winter War led to Daladier's resignation on 21 March 1940 and his replacement by Paul Reynaud. Daladier remained Minister of Defence until 19 May, when Reynaud took over the portfolio personally after the French defeat at Sedan. After the Fall of France, Daladier was tried for treason by the Vichy government during the Riom Trial and imprisoned in Fort du Portalet, the Buchenwald concentration camp and then Itter Castle. After the Battle of Castle Itter, Daladier resumed his political career as a member of the French Chamber of Deputies from 1946 to 1958. He died in Paris in 1970. Early life Daladier was born in Carpentras, Vaucluse, on 18 June 1884, the son of a village baker. He received his formal education at the lyc√©e Duparc in Lyon, where he was first introduced to socialist politics. After his graduation, he became a school teacher and a university lecturer at N√Æmes, Grenoble and Marseilles and then at the Lyc√©e Condorcet, in Paris, where he taught history. He began his political career by becoming the mayor of Carpentras, his home town, in 1912. He subsequently sought election to the Paris Chamber of Deputies but lost to a Radical-Socialist Party candidate; he later joined that party.Obituary for Daladier, 'New York Times', 12 October 1970 http://movies2.nytimes.com/learning/general/onthisday/bday/0618.html Daladier had received military training before the war under France's conscription system. In August 1914, he was mobilised at the age of 30 with the French Army's 2nd Foreign Infantry Regiment when World War I started with the rank of sergeant. In mid-1915, the 2nd Foreign Infantry Regiment was destroyed in heavy fighting against the Imperial German Army on the Western Front. The surviving remnant of it was assigned to other units, Daladier being transferred into the 209th Infantry Regiment.'Edouard Daladier and Munich: The French Role in an International Tragedy', Master of Arts thesis by David Wildermuth, Oklahoma State University, 1970. https://shareok.org/bitstream/handle/11244/24004/Thesis-1973-W673c.pdf?sequence=1&isAllowed;=y In 1916, he fought with the 209th in the Battle of Verdun and was given a field commission as a lieutenant in the midst of the battle in April 1916 having received commendations for gallantry in action.

However, cynics also quipped that his horns were like those of a snail.The historian John Charmley gives the quip as le taureau avec cornes de limace (the bull with the horns of a slug) but does not give any citation [Charmley 1987, p. 219] Interwar period After he entered the Chamber of Deputies, he became a leading member of the Radical-Socialist Party and was responsible for building the party into a structured modern political party. For most of the interwar period, he was the chief figure of the party's left wing, supporters of a governmental coalition with the socialist Section fran√ßaise de l'Internationale ouvri√®re (SFIO). A government minister in various posts during the coalition governments between 1924 and 1928, Daladier was instrumental in the Radical-Socialists' break with the SFIO in 1926, the first Cartel des gauches with the centre-right Raymond Poincar√© in November 1928. In 1930, he unsuccessfully attempted to gain socialist support for a centre-left government in coalition the Radical- Socialist and similar parties. In 1933, despite similar negotiations breaking down, he formed a government of the republican left. In January 1934, he was considered the most likely candidate of the centre-left to form a government of sufficient honesty to calm public opinion after the revelations of the Stavisky Affair, a major corruption scandal. The government lasted less than a week, however, since it fell in the face of the 6 February 1934 riots. After Daladier fell, the coalition of the left initiated two years of right-wing governments. After a year of being withdrawn from frontline politics, Daladier returned to public prominence in October 1934 and took a populist line against the banking oligarchy that he believed had taken control of French democracy: the Two Hundred Families. He was made president of the Radical-Socialist Party and brought the party into the Popular Front coalition. Daladier became Minister of National Defence in the L√©on Blum government and retained the crucial portfolio for two years. After the fall of the Blum government, Daladier became head of government again on 10 April 1938, orienting his government towards the centre and ending the Popular Front. =Munich Agreement= Neville Chamberlain, Daladier, Adolf Hitler, Benito Mussolini and Italian Foreign Minister Galeazzo Ciano, as they prepared to sign the Munich Agreement. √âdouard Daladier (centre) leaving Joachim von Ribbentrop after the Munich Conference 1938 Daladier's last government was in power at the time of the negotiations preceding the Munich Agreement during which France pressured Czechoslovakia to hand the Sudetenland to Nazi Germany. In April-May 1938, British Prime Minister Neville Chamberlain strongly but unsuccessfully pressed Daladier to renounce the French-Czechoslovak alliance, which led to Britain becoming involved in the crisis. From the British perspective, the problem was not the Sudetenland but the French-Czechoslovak alliance.Overy, Richard & Wheatcroft, Andrew The Road To War, London: Macmillan, 1989 p. 86 British military experts were almost unanimous that Germany would defeat France in a war unless Britain intervened. The British viewed that allowing Germany to defeat France would unacceptably alter the balance of power and so Britain would have no choice but to intervene if a French-German broke out.Overy, Richard & Wheatcroft, Andrew The Road To War, London: Macmillan, 2009 p. 115 The alliance would have turned any German attack on Czechoslovakia cause into a French‚ÄìGerman war. As British Foreign Secretary Lord Halifax stated at a Cabinet meeting in March 1938, \\"Whether we liked or not, we had to admit the plain fact that we could not afford to see France overrun\\".Aulach, Harindar \\"Britain and the Sudeten Issue, 1938: The Evolution of a Policy\\" pp. 233‚Äì259 from The Journal of Contemporary History, Vol. 18, No. 2 April 1983 p. 235 At the Anglo-French summit on 28‚Äì29 April 1938, Chamberlain pressured Daladier to renounce the alliance with Czechoslovakia, only to be firmly informed that France would stand by its obligations, which forced the British to be involved very reluctantly in the Sudetenland Crisis.Aulach, Harindar \\"Britain and the Sudeten Issue, 1938: The Evolution of a Policy\\" pp. 233‚Äì259 from The Journal of Contemporary History, Vol. 18, No. 2 April 1983 p. 238 As the historian Harindar Aulach wrote, the summit of 28‚Äì29 April 1938 represented a British \\"surrender\\" to the French, rather than a French \\"surrender\\" to the British since Daladier made it clear France would not renounce its alliance with Czechoslovakia.Aulach, Harindar \\"Britain and the Sudeten Issue, 1938: The Evolution of a Policy\\" pp. 233-259 from The Journal of Contemporary History, Vol. 18, No. 2 April 1983 p. 238 Unlike Chamberlain, Daladier had no illusions about Hitler's ultimate goals. In fact, he told the British in a late April 1938 meeting that Hitler's real aim was to eventually secure \\"a domination of the Continent in comparison with which the ambitions of Napoleon were feeble\\". Daladier went on to say, \\"Today, it is the turn of Czechoslovakia. Tomorrow, it will be the turn of Poland and Romania. When Germany has obtained the oil and wheat it needs, she will turn on the West. Certainly we must multiply our efforts to avoid war. But that will not be obtained unless Great Britain and France stick together, intervening in Prague for new concessions [i.e. to the Sudeten Germans] but declaring at the same time that they will safeguard the independence of Czechoslovakia. If, on the contrary, the Western Powers capitulate again, they will only precipitate the war they wish to avoid\\".Shirer, William The Collapse of the Third Republic: An Inquiry into the Fall of France in 1940, 1969, Da Capo Press, pp. 339‚Äì340. Nevertheless, perhaps discouraged by the pessimistic and defeatist attitudes of both military and civilian members of the French government and traumatised by the bloodbath in World War I that he had personally witnessed, Daladier ultimately chose to pressure Czechoslovakia into concessions. The French economic situation was very worrying since the French franc had been devalued on 4 May 1938 for the third time since October 1936. Daladier wanted to stabilise the franc and so had fixed the exchange rate to 176 francs per pound sterling. The crisis of 20‚Äì22 May 1938 made the franc come under immense financial pressure since many investors did not wish to hold French assets or debts if France went to war. Jacques Rueff, the director of direction g√©n√©rale du mouvement des fonds and special adviser to Finance Minister, Paul Marchandeau, stated in a report that the government must cut defense spending or find more sources of short-term loans, as the French government was running out of money. Marchandeau stated that ordinary charges upon the treasury in 1938 would \\"exceed\\" 42 billion francs, and Rueff warned that France would go bankrupt once the legal limits upon short-term loans from the Bank of France was reached. Marchandeau, in testimony before the Senate Finance Committee, stated that the government had only 30 million francs in its account and 230 million francs available from the Bank of France. As French government expenditure for the month of May 1938 alone totalled 4,500 million francs, the British historian Martin Thomas wrote, \\"Daladier's government was utterly reliant upon the success of its devaluation\\". To provide revenue, the government needed to sell more short-term bonds, but investors were highly reluctant to buy French bonds if Germany was threatening Czechoslovakia and put France on the brink of war. Because the franc was tied to the pound, France needed loans from Britain, which were not forthcoming, and so France was left \\"with its hands tied\\". British and American investors were unwilling to buy French bonds as long as the Sudetenland Crisis continued, which caused \\"severe monetary problems\\" for the French government in August-September 1938. Only when Daladier moved the \\"free-market liberal\\" Paul Reynaud from Justice Ministry to the Finance Ministry in November 1938 that France regained the confidence of international investors, who began to buy the French bonds that they had just shunned. Reports from the embassy in Warsaw and the legations in Belgrade and Bucharest emphasised that Yugoslavia and Romania would probably do nothing if Germany invaded Czechoslovakia, and Poland might very well join in with Germany since the Teschen dispute between Poland and Czechoslovakia had made them bitter enemies. Of France's allies in Eastern Europe, only the Soviet Union, which had no border with Czechoslovakia, professed a willingness to come to Czechoslovakia's aid if Germany invaded, but both Poland and Romania were unwilling to extend transit rights for the Red Army, which presented major problems. On 25 September 1938, at the Bad Godesberg Summit, Hitler rejected Chamberlain's offer to have the Sudetenland join Germany in few months, declared that the timeline was unacceptable and that the Sudetenland had to \\"go home to the Reich\\" by 1 October and stated that the Polish and Hungarian claims against Czechoslovakia must also be satisfied by 1 October or Czechoslovakia would be invaded. Upon hearing of what Hitler had demanded at the summit, Daladier told his cabinet that France \\"intended to go to war\\".Overy, Richard & Wheatcroft, Andrew The Road To War, London: Macmillan, 2009 p. 174 The next day, Daladier told his close friend, US Ambassador William Christian Bullitt Jr., that he would much prefer war to the \\"humiliation\\" of the Bad Godesberg terms.Overy, Richard & Wheatcroft, Andrew The Road To War, London: Macmillan, 2009 p. 174 Daldier ordered the French military to mobilise and put France to put on a war footing, with a blackout being imposed at night so that German bombers would be not guided to French cities by the lights.Overy, Richard & Wheatcroft, Andrew The Road To War, London: Macmillan, 2009 p. 174 On 26 September, Daladier ordered General Maurice Gamelin to London to begin staff talks with the Imperial General Staff.Overy, Richard & Wheatcroft, Andrew The Road To War, London: Macmillan, 2009 p. 175 On 27 September, Gamelin, asked by his chef de cabinet if Daladier was serious about war, replied, \\"He'll do it, he'll do it\\".Overy, Richard & Wheatcroft, Andrew The Road To War, London: Macmillan, 2009 p. 175 However, on 29 September 1938, Chamberlain announced to the British House of Commons that he just received a phone call from Benito Mussolini, who said that Hitler had reconsidered his views and was now willing to discuss a compromise solution to the crisis in Munich.Overy, Richard & Wheatcroft, Andrew The Road To War, London: Macmillan, 2009 p.175 Ultimately, Daladier felt that France could not win against Germany without Britain on its side, and Chamberlain's announcement that he would be flying to Munich led him to attend the Munich Conference as well, which was held the next day on 30 September.Overy, Richard & Wheatcroft, Andrew The Road To War, London: Macmillan, 2009 p. 175 The Munich Agreement was a compromise since Hitler abandoned his more extreme demands such as settling the Polish and Hungarian claims by 1 October, but the conference concluded that Czechoslovakia was to turn over the Sudetenland to Germany within ten days in October and would be supervised by an Anglo-Franco- Italo-German commission. Daladier was happy to have avoided war but felt that the agreement he had signed on 30 September in Munich was a shameful treaty that had betrayed Czechoslovakia, France's most loyal ally in Eastern Europe.Overy, Richard & Wheatcroft, Andrew The Road To War, London: Macmillan, 2009 p. 175 Although Daladier feared public hostility to the Munich Agreement on his return to Paris, he was acclaimed by the crowd, which cheered the fact that there would not be another war. =Rearmament= Daladier had been made aware in 1932 by German rivals to Hitler that Krupp manufactured heavy artillery, and the Deuxi√®me Bureau had a grasp of the scale of German military preparations but lacked hard intelligence of hostile intentions.Bennett, Edward W. (1979). German Rearmament and the West, 1932-1933. Princeton: Princeton University Press. p. 85. In October 1938, Daladier opened secret talks with the Americans on how to bypass the Neutrality Acts and to allow the French to buy American aircraft to make up for the underproductive French aircraft industry.Keylor, William, \\"France and the Illusion of American Support, 1919-1940\\" pp. 204‚Äì244 from The French Defeat of 1940 Reassessments edited by Joel Blatt Berghahn Books: Providence 1998 pp. 234‚Äì235 Daladier commented in October 1938, \\"If I had three or four thousand aircraft, Munich would never have happened\\". He was most anxious to buy American war planes as the only way to strengthen the French Air Force.Keylor, William. \\"France and the Illusion of American Support, 1919-1940\\" pp. 204‚Äì244 from The French Defeat of 1940 Reassessments, edited by Joel Blatt Berghahn Books: Providence 1998 p. 234 Major problems in the talks were how the French would pay for the American planes and how to bypass the Neutrality Acts.Keylor, William \\"France and the Illusion of American Support, 1919-1940\\" pp. 204‚Äì244 from The French Defeat of 1940 Reassessments edited by Joel Blatt Berghahn Books: Providence 1998 pp. 235‚Äì236 In addition, France had defaulted on its World War I debts in 1932 and so fell foul of the 1934 Johnson Act, which banned American loans to nations that had defaulted on their World War I debts.Keylor, William \\"France and the Illusion of American Support, 1919-1940\\" pp. 204‚Äì244 from The French Defeat of 1940 Reassessments edited by Joel Blatt Berghahn Books: Providence 1998 p. 237 In February 1939, the French offered to cede their possessions in the Caribbean and the Pacific, together with a lump sum payment of 10 billion francs, in exchange for the unlimited right to buy American aircraft on credit.Keylor, William \\"France and the Illusion of American Support, 1919-1940\\" pp. 204‚Äì244 from The French Defeat of 1940 Reassessments edited by Joel Blatt Berghahn Books: Providence 1998 p. 238 After tortuous negotiations, an arrangement was worked out in the spring of 1939 to allow the French to place huge orders with the American aircraft industry, but as most of the aircraft ordered had not arrived in France by 1940, the Americans arranged for French orders to be diverted to the British.Keylor, William \\"France and the Illusion of American Support, 1919-1940\\" pp. 204‚Äì244 from The French Defeat of 1940 Reassessments edited by Joel Blatt Berghahn Books: Providence 1998 pp. 233‚Äì244 At a rally in Marseilles in October 1938, Daladier announced a new policy: J'ai choisi mon chemin: la France en avant! (\\"I have chosen my path; forward with France!\\"). He stated that his government's domestic and foreign policies were to be based on \\"firmness\\".Overy, Richard & Wheatcroft, Andrew The Road To War, London: Macmillan, 2009 p.177 What that meant, in practice, was the end of the social reforms of the Popular Front government to increase French productivity, especially by ending the 40-hour work week.Overy, Richard & Wheatcroft, Andrew The Road To War, London: Macmillan, 2009 p. 177 In a series of decree laws issued on 1 November 1938 by Finance Minister Paul Reynaud, which bypassed the National Assembly, the 40-hour work week was ended, taxes were sharply increased; social spending was slashed, defence spending was increased, the power of unions were restricted and (most controversially) Saturday was once again declared to be a workday.Overy, Richard & Wheatcroft, Andrew The Road To War, London: Macmillan, 2009 p. 177 In a radio broadcast on 12 November 1938, Reynauld stated, \\"We are going blindfold towards an abyss\\". He also argued that however much pain his reforms might cause, they were absolutely necessary.Overy, Richard & Wheatcroft, Andrew The Road To War, London: Macmillan, 2009 p. 178 As part of the effort to put the French economy on a war footing, Reynauld increased the military budget from 29 billion francs to 93 billion francs.Overy, Richard & Wheatcroft, Andrew The Road To War, London: Macmillan, 2009 p. 178 In response, the French Communist Party called for a general strike to protest the decrees that ended almost all of the reforms of the Popular Front.Overy, Richard & Wheatcroft, Andrew The Road To War, London: Macmillan, 2009 p. 177 The one-day general strike of 30 November 1938, which pitted the government against unions supported by the Communist Party, proved to be the first test of Daladier's new policy of \\"firmness\\".Overy, Richard & Wheatcroft, Andrew The Road To War, London: Macmillan, 2009 p. 178 Daladier declared a national emergency in response to the general strike, ordered the military to Paris and other major cities, suspended civil liberties, ordered the police to disperse striking workers with tear gas and to storm factories occupied by the workers and announced that any worker who took part in the strike would be fired immediately with no severance pay.Overy, Richard & Wheatcroft, Andrew The Road To War, London: Macmillan, 2009 p. 178 After one day, the strike collapsed.Overy, Richard & Wheatcroft, Andrew The Road To War, London: Macmillan, 2009 p. 178 At the time, Daladier justified his policy of \\"firmness\\" under the grounds that if France was to face the German challenge, French production would have to be increased and said that was the price of freedom.Overy, Richard & Wheatcroft, Andrew The Road To War, London: Macmillan, 2009 p. 177 At the same time, the energetic Colonial Minister Georges Mandel was set about organising the French Colonial Empire for war. He established armament factories in French Indochina to supply the French garrisons there to deter Japan from invading, increased the number of colonial \\"coloured\\" divisions from 6 to 12, built defensive works in Tunisia to deter an Italian invasion from Libya and organised the colonial economies for a \\"total war\\".Overy, Richard & Wheatcroft, Andrew The Road To War, London: Macmillan, 2009 p. 184 In France itself, Mandel launched a propaganda campaign emphasising how the French Colonial Empire was a source of strength under the slogan \\"110 million strong, France can stand up to Germany\\" in reference to the fact that the population of Germany was 80 million and that of France was 40 million, with the extra 70 million credited to France being the population of its colonies.Overy, Richard & Wheatcroft, Andrew The Road To War, London: Macmillan, 2009 p. 184 The 40-hour work week was abolished under Daladier's government, but a more generous system of family allowances was established and set as a percentage of wages: for the first child 5%, for the second child 10% and for each additional child 15%. Also created was a home mother allowance, which had been advocated by natalist and Catholic women‚Äôs groups since 1929. All mothers who were not professionally employed and whose husbands collected family allowances were eligible for the new benefit. In March 1939, the government added 10% for workers whose wives stayed home to take care of the children. Family allowances were enshrined in the Family Code of July 1939 and, with the exception of the stay-at-home allowance, are still in force. In addition, a decree was issued in May 1938 to allow the establishment of vocational guidance centres. In July 1937, a new law, which was followed by a similar law in May 1946, empowered the Department of Workplace Inspection to order temporary medical interventions. The British historian Richard Overy wrote: \\"The greatest achievement of Daladier in 1939 was to win from the British a firm commitment\\", the so-called \\"continental commitment\\" that every French leader had sought since 1919.Overy, Richard & Wheatcroft, Andrew The Road To War, London: Macmillan, 2009 p. 181 Daladier had a low opinion of Britain and told Bullitt in November 1938 that he \\"fully expected to be betrayed by the British.... he considered Chamberlain a desiccated stick; the King a moron; and the Queen an excessively ambitious woman.... he felt that England had become so feeble and senile that the British would give away every possession of their friends rather than stand up to Germany and Italy\\".Overy, Richard & Wheatcroft, Andrew The Road To War, London: Macmillan, 2009 p.181 In late 1938 to early 1939, the British embassy was bombarded with rumours from reliable sources within the French government that France would seek an \\"understanding\\" with Germany that would resolve all problems in their relations.Overy, Richard & Wheatcroft, Andrew The Road To War, London: Macmillan, 2009 p. 181 The fact that French Foreign Minister Georges Bonnet was indeed seeking such an understanding lent credence to such rumours.Overy, Richard & Wheatcroft, Andrew The Road To War, London: Macmillan, 2009 p. 181 Daladier let Bonnet pursue his own foreign policy in the hope that it might finally spur the British into making the \\"continental commitment\\" since a France aligned with Germany would make the Reich Europe's strongest power and leave Britain with no ally of comparable strength in Europe.Overy, Richard & Wheatcroft, Andrew The Road To War, London: Macmillan, 2009 p. 181 In January 1939, Daladier let the Deuxi√®me Bureau manufacture the \\"Dutch War Scare\\". French intelligence fed misinformation to MI6 that Germany was about to invade the Netherlands with the aim of using Dutch air fields to launch a bombing campaign to raze British cities to the ground.Overy, Richard & Wheatcroft, Andrew The Road To War, London: Macmillan, 2009 p. 181 As France was the only nation in Western Europe with an army strong enough to save the Netherlands, the \\"Dutch War Scare\\" led the British to make anxious inquiries in Paris to ask the French to intervene if the Netherlands were indeed invaded.Overy, Richard & Wheatcroft, Andrew The Road To War, London: Macmillan, 2009 p. 181 In response, Daladier stated that if the British wanted the French to do something for their security, it was only fair for the British do something for French security. On 6 February 1939, Chamberlain, in a speech to the House of Commons, finally made the \\"continental commitment\\" as he told the House: \\"The solidarity that unites France and Britain is such that any threat to the vital interests of France must bring about the co-operation of Great Britain\\".Overy, Richard & Wheatcroft, Andrew The Road To War, London: Macmillan, 2009 p. 182 On 13 February 1939, staff talks between the British Imperial General Staff and the French General Staff were opened.Overy, Richard & Wheatcroft, Andrew The Road To War, London: Macmillan, 2009 p. 182 Daladier supported Chamberlain's policy of creating a \\"peace front\\" that was meant to deter Germany from aggression but was unhappy with the British \\"guarantee\\" of Poland, which Chamberlain had announced to the House of Commons on 31 March 1939.Overy, Richard & Wheatcroft, Andrew The Road To War, London: Macmillan, 2009 p. 182 France had been allied to Poland since 1921, but Daladier had been bitter by the German-Polish Nonaggression Pact of 1934 and the Polish annexation of part of Czechoslovakia in 1938. Like other French leaders, he regarded the Sanation regime ruling Poland as a fickle and unreliable friend of France.Overy, Richard & Wheatcroft, Andrew The Road To War, London: Macmillan, 2009 p. 182 The rise in French industrial output and the greater financial stability in 1939 as a result of Reynauld's reforms led Daladier to view the possibility of war with the Reich more favourably than had been the case in 1938. By September 1939, France's aircraft production was equal to Germany's, and 170 American planes were arriving per month. The Neutrality Acts were still in effect, but the supportive stance of US President Franklin Roosevelt led Daladier to assume that the Americans would maintain a pro- French neutrality and that their tremendous industrial resources would aid France if the Danzig Crisis ended in war. Daladier was far keener than Chamberlain was to bring the Soviet Union into the \\"peace front\\" and believed that only an alliance with the Soviets could deter Hitler from invading Eastern Europe.Overy, Richard & Wheatcroft, Andrew The Road To War, London: Macmillan, 2009 pp. 182‚Äì183 Daladier did not want a war with Germany in 1939 but sought to have such an overwhelming array of forces arranged against Germany that Hitler would be deterred from invading Poland. Daladier believed that Polish Guarantee by Britain would encourage Poland to object to having the Soviet Union join the \\"peace front\\", which indeed proved to be the case.Overy, Richard & Wheatcroft, Andrew The Road To War, London: Macmillan, 2009 p.182-183 The Poles refused to grant transit rights to the Red Army, which the Soviets made a precondition for their joining the \\"peace front\\". Daladier felt that Chamberlain should not have made guarantee until the Poles had agreed to grant transit rights to the Red Army. He charged that the guarantee made British and French diplomats have more leverage over Polish Foreign Minister Colonel Jozef Beck, who was widely disliked by other diplomats for his stubbornness and haughty manners. Daladier felt that on economic and military grounds, it was better to have the Soviet Union serve as the \\"eastern pivot\\" of the \\"peace front\\" than for Poland to do so, as the British preferred.Overy, Richard & Wheatcroft, Andrew The Road To War, London: Macmillan, 2009 pp. 182‚Äì183 Daladier disliked the Poles and the guarantee but believed in maintaining the alliance with Poland; he believed that France should stand by its commitments.Overy, Richard & Wheatcroft, Andrew The Road To War, London: Macmillan, 2009 p.181 A public opinion poll in June 1939 showed that 76% of the French believed that France should immediately declare war if Germany tried to seize the Free City of Danzig. For Daladier, the possibility that the Soviet Union might join the \\"peace front\\" was a \\"lifeline\\" and the best way of stopping another world war. He was deeply frustrated by the Polish refusal to permit transit rights for the Red Army.Overy, Richard & Wheatcroft, Andrew The Road To War, London: Macmillan, 2009 p. 183 On 19 August 1939, Beck, in a telegram to Daladier, stated: \\"We have not got a military agreement with the USSR. We do not want to have one\\".Overy, Richard & Wheatcroft, Andrew The Road To War, London: Macmillan, 2009 pp. 183‚Äì184 Through the Molotov-Ribbentrop Pact of 23 August ruined Daladier's hopes of an Anglo-Franco-Soviet \\"peace front\\", he still believed that France and Britain could stop Germany together. On 27 August 1939, Daladier told Bullitt, \\"there was no further question of policy to be settled. His sister had put in two bags all the personal keepsakes and belonging he really cared about, and was prepared to leave for a secure spot at any moment. France intended to stand by the Poles, and if Hitler should refuse to negotiate with the Poles over Danzig, and should make war on Poland, France would fight at once\\". World War II Daladier with Generals Joseph Vuillemin and Victor Bourret on 12 November 1939 After the Molotov‚ÄìRibbentrop Pact was signed, Daladier responded to the public outcry by outlawing the French Communist Party on the basis that it had refused to condemn Joseph Stalin's actions. During the Danzig Crisis, Daladier was greatly influenced by the advice that he received from Robert Coulondre, the French ambassador in Berlin, that Hitler would back down if France made a firm enough stand toward Poland. On 31 August 1939, Daladier read out to the French cabinet a letter he received from Coulondre: \\"The trial of strength turns to our advantage. It is only necessary to hold, hold, hold!\\"Overy, Richard 1939 Countdown to War, London: Penguin, 2009 p. 64. After the German invasion of Poland on 1 September, he reluctantly declared war on 3 September and inaugurated the Phoney War. On 6 October, Hitler offered France and Britain a peace proposal. There were more than a few in the French government who were prepared to take Hitler up on his offer, but in a nationwide broadcast the next day, Daladier declared, \\"We took up arms against aggression. We shall not put them down until we have guarantees for a real peace and security, a security which is not threatened every six months\\".Shirer, William The Collapse of the Third Republic: An Inquiry into the Fall of France in 1940, 1969, Da Capo Press, p. 529. On 29 January 1940, in a radio address delivered to the people of France, The Nazi's Aim is Slavery, Daladier was explicitly stated his opinion of the Germans: \\"For us, there is more to do than merely win the war. We shall win it, but we must also win a victory far greater than that of arms. In this world of masters and slaves, which those madmen who rule at Berlin are seeking to forge, we must also save liberty and human dignity\\". In March 1940, Daladier resigned as prime minister because of his failure to aid Finland's defence during the Winter War, and he was replaced by Paul Reynaud. Daladier remained defence minister, however, and his antipathy to the new prime minister prevented Reynaud from dismissing Maurice Gamelin as Supreme Commander of the French armed forces. As a result of the massive German breakthrough at Sedan, Daladier swapped ministerial offices with Reynaud and became foreign minister while Reynaud became defence ministers. Gamelin was finally replaced by Maxime Weygand on 19 May 1940, nine days after the Germans began the Battle of France. Under the impression that the French government would continue in North Africa, Daladier fled with other members of the government to French Morocco, but he was arrested and tried for treason by the Vichy government during the Riom Trial. Daladier was interned in Fort du Portalet, in the Pyrenees. He was kept in prison from 1940 to April 1943, when he was handed over to the Germans and deported to Buchenwald concentration camp in Germany. In May 1943, he was transported to the Itter Castle, in North Tyrol, with other French dignitaries, where he remained until the end of the war. He was freed after the Battle for Castle Itter. Postwar After the war ended, Daladier was re-elected to the Chamber of Deputies in 1946 and acted as a patron to the Radical-Socialist Party's young reforming leader, Pierre Mend√®s-France. He also was elected as the Mayor of Avignon in 1953. He opposed the transferral of powers to Charles de Gaulle after the May 1958 crisis but, in the subsequent legislative elections of that year, failed to secure re- election. He withdrew from politics after a career of almost 50 years at the age of 74. Death Daladier died in Paris on 10 October, 1970, at the age of 86. His body was buried at P√®re Lachaise Cemetery.Entry for Daladier in 'World War 2 Gravestone.com' (2019). https://ww2gravestone.com/people/daladier- eduard/ In visual media *Daladier is portrayed by the English actor David Swift in Countdown to War (1989).

The region has been called \\"The Most Southern Place on Earth\\"James C. Cobb, The Most Southern Place on Earth: The Mississippi Delta and the Roots of Regional Identity (1992) (\\"Southern\\" in the sense of \\"characteristic of its region, the American South\\"), because of its unique racial, cultural, and economic history. It is long and across at its widest point, encompassing about , or, almost 7,000 square miles of alluvial floodplain. Originally covered in hardwood forest across the bottomlands, it was developed as one of the richest cotton-growing areas in the nation before the American Civil War (1861‚Äì1865). The region attracted many speculators who developed land along the riverfronts for cotton plantations; they became wealthy planters dependent on the labor of black slaves, who composed the vast majority of the population in these counties well before the Civil War, often twice the number of whites. As the riverfront areas were developed first and railroads were slow to be constructed, most of the bottomlands in the Delta were undeveloped, even after the Civil War. Both black and white migrants flowed into Mississippi, using their labor to clear land and sell timber in order to buy land. By the end of the 19th century, black farmers made up two-thirds of the independent farmers in the Mississippi Delta. In 1890, the white-dominated state legislature passed a new state constitution effectively disenfranchising most blacks in the state. In the next three decades, most blacks lost their lands due to tight credit and political oppression. African Americans had to resort to sharecropping and tenant farming to survive. Their political exclusion was maintained by the whites until after the gains of the Civil Rights Movement in the 1960s. The majority of residents in several counties in the region are still black, although more than 400,000 African Americans left the state during the Great Migration in the first half of the 20th century, moving to Northeastern, Midwestern, and Western industrial cities. As the agricultural economy does not support many jobs or businesses, the region has attempted to diversify it. Lumbering is important and new crops such as soybeans have been cultivated in the area by the largest industrial farmers. At times, the region has suffered heavy flooding from the Mississippi River, notably in 1927 and 2011. Geography The shared flood plain of the Yazoo and Mississippi rivers Despite the name, this region is not part of the delta of the Mississippi River. Rather, it is part of an alluvial plain, created by regular flooding of the Mississippi and Yazoo rivers over thousands of years. The land is flat and contains some of the most fertile soil in the world. It is two hundred miles long and seventy miles across at its widest point, encompassing approximately 4,415,000 acres, or, some 7,000 square miles of alluvial floodplain. On the east, it is bounded by bluffs extending beyond the Yazoo River. It includes all or part of the following counties: Washington, Western DeSoto, Humphreys, Carroll, Issaquena, Western Panola, Quitman, Bolivar, Coahoma, Leflore, Sunflower, Sharkey, Tate, Tunica, Tallahatchie, Western Holmes, Western Yazoo, Western Grenada, and Warren. Lexington, Mississippi (located in Holmes County) is also part of the Delta. The shifting river delta at the mouth of the Mississippi on the Gulf Coast lies some 300 miles south of this area, and is referred to as the Mississippi River Delta. The two should not be confused. Demographics Chinese began settling in Bolivar County and other Delta counties as plantation workers in the 1870s, though most Delta Chinese families migrated to the state between the 1900s and 1930s. Most Chinese immigrants worked to leave the fields, becoming merchants in the small rural towns. As these have declined, along with other Delta residents ethnic Chinese have moved to cities or other states.Vivian Wu Wong, \\"Somewhere between White and Black: The Chinese in Mississippi\\", Magazine of History, v10, n4, pp33‚Äì36, Summer 1996, accessed October 1, 2013 Their descendants represent most of the ethnic Asian residents of the Delta recorded in censuses. While many Chinese have left the Delta, their population has increased in the state.Loewen, James W. 1971.

In the 21st century, about one-third of Mississippi's African-American population resides in the Delta, which has many black- majority state legislative districts.\\"Location \\". Mississippi Valley State University. Retrieved on April 5, 2012. Much of the Delta is included in Mississippi's 2nd congressional district, represented by Democrat Bennie Thompson. Agriculture and the Delta economy =Plantations= For more than two centuries, agriculture has been the mainstay of the Delta economy. Sugar cane and rice were introduced to the region by European settlers from the Caribbean in the 18th century. Sugar and rice production were centered in southern Louisiana, and later in the Arkansas Delta. Early agriculture also included limited tobacco production in the Natchez area and indigo in the lower Mississippi. Yeoman French farmers, supported by extensive families, had begun the back-breaking land clearing. Colonists tried to enslave the Native Americans, who escaped. In the 18th century, the French, Spanish and English ended Native American slavery, and imported enslaved Africans instead. In the early years, African laborers brought critical knowledge and techniques for the cultivation and processing of both rice and indigo. Hundreds of thousands of Africans were captured, sold and transported as slaves from West Africa to North America. The invention of the cotton gin in the late 18th century made profitable the cultivation of short-staple cotton. This type could be grown in the upland areas of the South, leading to the rapid development of King Cotton throughout what became known as the Deep South. The demand for labor drove the domestic slave trade, and more than one million African-American slaves were forced by sales into the South, taken in a forced migration from families in the Upper South. After continued European-American settlement in the area, Congressional passage of the Indian Removal Act of 1830 extinguished Native American claims to these lands. The Five Civilized Tribes and others were mostly removed west of the Mississippi River, and European-American settlement expanded at a rapid rate in Georgia, Alabama, Mississippi, Louisiana and Texas. In the areas of greatest cotton cultivation, whites were far outnumbered by their slaves. Many slaves were transported to Delta towns by riverboat from slave markets in New Orleans, which became the fourth largest city in the country by 1840. Other slaves were transported downriver from slave markets at Memphis and Louisville. Still others were transported by sea in the coastwise slave trade. By this time, slavery had long been established as a racial caste. African Americans for generations worked the commodity plantations, which they made extremely profitable. In the opinion of Jefferson Davis and others later living in Mississippi, Africans being held in slavery reflected the will of Providence, as it led to their Christianizing and to the improvement of their condition, compared to what it would have been had they remained in Africa.Davis, Rise and Fall of the Confederate Government (1881), pp. 517-518 According to Davis, the Africans \\"increased from a few unprofitable savages to millions of efficient Christian laborers.\\"Davis (1881), Rise and Fall of the Confederate Government, pp. 160-161. By the early 19th century, cotton had become the Delta's premier crop, for which there was high international demand. Mills in New England and New York also demanded cotton for their industry, and New York City was closely tied to the cotton trade. Many southern planters traveled so frequently there for business that they had favorite hotels. From 1822 cotton-related exports comprised half of all exports from the port of New York City.\\"King Cotton: Dramatic Growth of the Cotton Trade\\" , New York Divided: Slavery and the Civil War, New-York Historical Society, accessed May 12, 2012 In 1861 Democratic mayor Fernando Wood called for secession of New York City because of its close business ties to the South.Roberts, Sam (December 26, 2010). \\"New York Doesn't Care to Remember the Civil War\\", The New York Times, accessed 10 March 2014 Eventually the city joined the state in supporting the war, but immigrants resented having to fight when the wealthy could buy their way out of military service. Comparing cotton's preeminence then to that of oil today, Historian Sven Beckert called the Delta \\"a kind of Saudi Arabia of the early nineteenth century.\\" Demand for cotton remained high until well after the American Civil War, even in an era of falling cotton prices. Though cotton planters believed that the alluvial soils of the region would always renew, the agricultural boom from the 1830s to the late 1850s caused extensive soil exhaustion and erosion. Lacking agricultural knowledge, planters continued to raise cotton the same way after the Civil War. Plantations before the war were generally developed on ridges near the rivers, which were used for transportation of products to market. Most of the territory of Mississippi was still considered wilderness, needing substantial new population. These areas were covered in a heavy dense growth of trees, bushes and vines. Following the Civil War, 90 percent of the bottomlands in Mississippi were still undeveloped. The state attracted thousands of migrants to its frontier. They could trade their labor in clearing the land to eventually purchase it from their sale of lumber. Tens of thousands of new settlers, both black and white, were drawn to the area. By the end of the century, two-thirds of the independent farmers in the Mississippi Delta were black. But, the extended low price of cotton had caused many to go deeply into debt, and gradually they had to sell off their lands, as they had a harder time getting credit than did white farmers. From 1910 to 1920, the first and second generations of African Americans after slavery lost their stake in the land. They had to resort to sharecropping and tenant farming to survive.John C. Willis, Forgotten Time: The Yazoo-Mississippi Delta after the Civil War, Charlottesville: University of Virginia Press, 2000 Sharecropping and tenant farming replaced the slave-dependent plantation system. African-American families retained some autonomy, rather than working on gangs of laborers. As many were illiterate, they were often taken advantage of by the planters' accounting. The number of lynchings of black men rose in the region at the time of settling accounts, and researchers have also found a correlation of lynchings to years that were poor economically for the region. The sharecropping and tenant system, with each family making its own decisions, inhibited the use of progressive agricultural techniques in the region. In the late 19th century, the clearing and drainage of wetlands, especially in Arkansas and the Missouri Bootheel, increased lands available for tenant farming and sharecropping. Planters needed workers and recruited Italians and Chinese workers in the 19th century to satisfy demand. They quickly moved out of field labor, saving money as communities in order to establish themselves as merchants, often in the small rural towns. =Mechanization and migration= During the 1920s and 1930s, in the aftermath of the increasing mechanization of Delta farms that reduced the need for labor, displaced whites and African Americans began to leave the land and move to towns and cities. Tens of thousands of black laborers left the Jim Crow south for better opportunities in the Northeast and Midwest in the Great Migration, settling in cities such as St. Louis, Chicago, Cleveland, and New York City. It was not until the Great Depression years of the 1930s and later that large-scale farm mechanization came to the region. The mechanization of agriculture and the availability of domestic work outside the Delta spurred the migration of Delta residents from the region. Farming was unable to absorb the available labor force, and entire families moved together, many going north on the railroad to Chicago. People from the same towns often settled near each other. From the late 1930s through the 1950s, the Delta enjoyed an agriculture boom, as wartime needs followed by reconstruction in Europe and Japan expanded the demand for the Delta region's farm products. As the mechanization of agriculture continued, women left fieldwork and went into service work, while the men drove tractors and worked on the farms. From the 1960s through the 1990s, thousands of small farms and dwellings in the Delta region were absorbed by large corporate-owned agribusinesses, and the smallest Delta communities have stagnated. Since the late 20th century, lower Delta agriculture has increasingly been dominated by families and nonresident corporate entities that hold large landholdings. Their operations are heavily mechanized with low labor costs. Such farm entities are capital-intensive, where hundreds and thousands of acres are used to produce market-driven crops such as cotton, sugar, rice, and soybeans.Justin Gardner and Tom Nolan, \\"An Agricultural Economist's Perspective on the Mississippi Delta\\", Arkansas Review: A Journal of Delta Studies, August 2009, Vol. 40 Issue 2, pp 80‚Äì89 =Diversification= Remnants of the region's agrarian heritage are scattered along the highways and byways of the lower Delta. Larger communities have survived by fostering economic development in education, government, and medicine. Other endeavors such as catfish, poultry, rice, corn, and soybean farming have assumed greater importance. Today, the monetary value of these crops rivals that of cotton production in the lower Delta. Shifts away from the river as a main transportation and trading route to railroads and, more significantly, highways, have left the river cities struggling for new roles and businesses. Due to the growth of the automobile industry in the South, many parts suppliers have opened facilities in the Delta (as well as on the Arkansas Delta side of the Mississippi River, another area of high poverty). The 1990s state legalization of casino gambling in Mississippi has boosted the Delta's economy, particularly in the areas of Tunica and Vicksburg. A large cultural influence in the region is its history of hunting and fishing. Hunting in the Delta is primarily for game such as whitetail deer, wild turkey, and waterfowl, along with many small game species (squirrel, rabbit, dove, quail, raccoon, etc.) For many years, the hunting and fishing have also attracted visitors in the regional tourism economy. The Delta is one of the top waterfowl destinations in the world because it is in the middle of the Mississippi Flyway (the largest of all the migratory bird routes in America). Political environment Democrats had used fraud, violence and intimidation to regain control of the state legislature in the late 19th century. Paramilitary groups such as the Red Shirts in Mississippi were active against Republicans and blacks to suppress their voting for state candidates. But many blacks continued to be elected to local offices, and there was a biracial coalition between Republicans and Populists that briefly gained state power in the late 1880s. To prevent this from happening again, in 1890 the Mississippi state legislature passed a new constitution which effectively disenfranchised most blacks by use of such devices as poll taxes, literacy tests and grandfather clauses, which withstood court challenges. If one method was overturned by the courts, the state would come up with another to continue exclusion of blacks from the political system. Unable to vote, they could not participate on juries. The state passed legislation to impose racial segregation and other aspects of Jim Crow. This system of white supremacy was maintained with violence and economic boycotts into the years of increasing activism for civil rights, as blacks worked to regain their constitutional rights as citizens. The Delta counties were sites of fierce and violent white resistance to change, with blacks murdered for trying to register to vote or to use public facilities. African Americans were not able to exercise their constitutional rights again until well after their successes in the Civil Rights Movement and gaining passage of the Voting Rights Act of 1965. Culture =Music= The Delta is strongly associated as the place where several genres of popular music originated, including Delta blues and rock and roll. The mostly black sharecroppers and tenant farmers had lives marked by poverty and hardship but they expressed their struggles in music that became the beat, rhythm and songs of cities and a nation. Gussow (2010) examines the conflict between blues musicians and black ministers in the region between 1920 and 1942. The ministers condemned blues music as \\"devil's music\\". In response, some blues musicians satirized preachers in their music, as for example in the song, \\"He Calls That Religion\\", by the blues group Mississippi Sheiks. The lyrics accused black ministers of engaging in and fomenting sinful behavior. The black residents were poor, and the musicians and ministers competed for their money. The Great Migration to northern cities, beginning before World War I, seriously depleted black communities and churches, but the musicians sparked off each other in the industrial cities, with blues in Chicago and St. Louis. =Festivals= Following is a list of various festivals in the Delta: ;February: * Mississippi River Marathon (Greenville) ;March: * Italian Festival of Mississippi (Cleveland) ;April: * Rivergate Festival (Tunica) * World Catfish Festival (Belzoni) * Leland Crawfish Festival (Leland) * Crosstie Arts & Jazz Festival (Cleveland) * Juke Joint Festival (Clarksdale) * Riverfest (Vicksburg) * Dragon Boat Festival (Greenville) ;May: * Deep Delta Festival (Rolling Fork) * River to the Rails Festival (Greenwood) * Mainstream Arts & Crafts Festival (Greenville) * Summerfest (Hollandale) * Showfest (Tunica) As of 2010 * Webb Day Festival (Webb) ;June: * B.B.

Education =Universities= * Delta State University * Mississippi Valley State University =Community colleges= * Coahoma Community College * Mississippi Delta Community College =Primary and secondary schools= During the years of segregation, public school systems did not know how to classify the minority Chinese students, initially requiring them to attend schools with blacks. Their socioeconomic status affected their classification and, as their parents became merchants and filed legal suits, in some areas they gained entrance for their children to white schools, before the schools were integrated beginning in the late 1960s. As of 2005, the majority of students in public schools in the Mississippi Delta are black, and the majority of private school students are white. This de facto racial segregation is related in part to economics, as few African-American parents in the poor region can pay to send their children to private schools. Suzanne Eckes of The Journal of Negro Education wrote, \\"Although de facto segregation in schools exists throughout the country, the de facto segregation that exists in the Mississippi Delta region is somewhat unique.\\"Eckes, p. 159.

Glico Morinaga case In 1984, following threats by the Monster with 21 Faces to poison Glico confections and the resulting mass withdrawal of Glico products from shelves, a man wearing a Yomiuri Giants baseball cap was caught placing Glico chocolate on a store shelf by a security camera. This man was believed to be the mastermind behind the Monster with 21 Faces. The security camera photo was made public after this incident. Melamine contamination On September 30, 2008, Hong Kong authorities announced that melamine had been detected in Pocky Men's coffee cream-coated biscuit sticks made in China. Ezaki Glico had no immediate comment on the reported contamination. The melamine contamination level was found to be 43 ppm (the legal limit is 2.5 ppm). On October 17, 2008, Pocky Men's coffee cream-coated biscuit sticks was banned in Sri Lanka by the country's health ministry alongside 59 other products containing melamine.

A naturally skilled but unscrupulous and devious politician who changed with the times and personally tortured Anne Askew, Wriothesley served as a loyal instrument of King Henry VIII in the latter's break with the Catholic church. Richly rewarded with royal gains from the Dissolution of the Monasteries, he nevertheless prosecuted Calvinists and other dissident Protestants when political winds changed.  Early life  Thomas Wriothesley, born in London 21 December 1505, was the son of York Herald William Wriothesley, whose ancestors had spelled the family surname \\"Wryth\\", and Agnes Drayton, daughter and heiress of James Drayton of London. Thomas had two sisters, Elizabeth, born in 1507, and Anne, born in 1508, and a brother, Edward, born in 1509. Thomas's father and uncle were the first members of his family to use the \\"Wriothesley\\" spelling of the family surname.; . Wriothesley received his early education at St Paul's School, London. In 1522 he was admitted to Trinity Hall, Cambridge, where he was taught law by Stephen Gardiner; although Wriothesley did not take a degree, he and Gardiner remained lifelong friends. In 1524, at the age of nineteen, he entered a career at court and came to the attention of Thomas Cromwell. Before 4 May 1530 he was appointed joint Clerk of the Signet under Gardiner, by then secretary to King Henry VIII, a post Wriothesley held for a decade while continuing in Cromwell's service.; . One historian has described the young lawyer as \\"able, entreprising, tenacious and ruthless, yet unsufferably overconfident and egotistic.\\"Weir, p.399  A useful courtier  A member of the royal secretariat, Wriothesley and William Brereton were charged with helping secure an annulment for the king against Katherine of Aragon, from the Pope to allow Anne Boleyn to assume her royal position; they were sent out to get members of the nobility to sign written statements indicating assent to the annulment.Letters and Papers of the Reign of Henry VIII; Weir (2001), p.311 Wriothesley was at Windsor with the Court when the series of protests known as the Pilgrimage of Grace broke out in reaction to the religious changes brought in by the crown and its advisors. The Clerk of the Signet admired the King but probably learnt lessons of cruelty from the treatment of Robert Aske in 1536. \\"It was upon such men that the King relied at times of crisis\\". Wriothesley's services were richly rewarded at the Dissolution of the Monasteries. He was granted extensive lands between Southampton and Winchester, once belonging to the abbeys of Beaulieu and Titchfield. Even with the retrospection of later life he was able to 'forget' the excesses of the 1530s, Wriothesley was still able to exaggerate his fidelity to his \\"benign and pleasant' King, who he knew only in the febrile atmosphere of the Court.Letters and Papers of Henry VIII; Domestic State Papers: Spanish; Weir (2001), p.415 Until May 1539, he was Henry VIII's ambassador in Brussels. In late 1539, Anne of Cleves was due to come from the German principality to England, and Wriothesley was to lead the naval escort. On 27 December the Princess arrived at Deal in Kent, from whence she was shown to Dover Castle; on New Years Day the party reached Rochester Castle. Wriothesley continued to support Norfolk's Catholic party, but only when it suited him at court, as parties emerged between the reformists and conservatives. In the absence of a predominant figure the Council became more conciliar towards the end of the reign. Having been sent on diplomatic errands abroad, in 1540 Sir Thomas Wriothesley was made one of the king's principal secretaries (a position he held jointly with Sir Ralph Sadler), acting as Secretary to the Privy Council. Dividing the duties, Sadler's was personal secretary to the King, whereas Wriothesley's responsibilities were purely political. Wriothesley was rewarded with the dissolved abbey of Titchfield for good service to the king. He rapidly converted it into a country house which became the family's ancestral seat. Wriothesley's noble parentage and strong personality enabled him to dominate the commoner Sadler. Knighted in 1540, Wriothesley made friends with Sir Anthony Browne of the refounded Gentleman Pensioners, who acted as an armed bodyguard of the King pursuant to the Greenwich Ordinances.Weir (2001), Henry VIII, p.422 The expansion of the Pensioners from 50 to 350 members was an expansion that signalled the resurgence of the conservative noble faction at court during the 1540s. Wriothesley, having earned his place at court as a faithful attendant to Thomas Cromwell, instead turned traitor in 1540, telling the king that Cromwell was indiscreet over Henry's inability to consummate his marriage to Anne of Cleves. This news, coupled with the Cleves alliance threatening war with Emperor Charles V, proved Cromwell's undoing. Wriothesley happily lied to the Council, and betrayed his master, in order to take his place beside the king. Queen Catherine Howard's conviction and execution for adultery signalled that the political pendulum was swinging away from Norfolk once more. On 13 November 1541, Secretary Wriothesley was sent to announce the bad news to members of the Queen's Household at Hampton Court; all her chamber were dismissed and sent home. In 1542 it was said that Wriothesley governed almost everything in England.Edward Hall, The Triumphant Reign; Weir (2001), p.455 He sought to bring about an alliance between England and Spain in 1543. Wriothesley was one of the Council led by Catholic Bishop Gardiner, who ordered the imprisonment of Henry Howard, Earl of Surrey for being drunk and disorderly. He supported Gardiner's crackdown against Lutheran opinions, threatening the lives of reformers Miles Coverdale and Hugh Latimer, presaging the reign of 'Bloody' Mary. All Protestants were rooted out of the royal household, with those of the new extreme Puritan sect Calvinism being treated with especial prejudice. The Council even intimidated Archbishop Cranmer, who was protected by the King himself. Sir Ralph Sadler was ousted as the principal secretary to the King to be replaced by the more judicious and discreet William Paget.Weir (2001), p.464 But the rise of the conservatives meant Wriothesley had eventually to go, in January 1544 in favour of the openly Catholic Sir William Petre. Fortunately for Cranmer and others, the King was not prepared to turn the clock back to the 1530s, and Catherine Parr, with her experience in two previous marriages, impressed Wriothesley by offering Henry stability in his old age. Furthermore, as Governess to Princess Elizabeth, bringing the children to court at Christmas 1543, Parr showed off what Wriothesley had accurately predicted to be Elizabeth's promise as a future leader. = A confident counsellor = Wriothesley disliked the arrogant, swaggering Earl of Hertford; they had long been enemies.Weir (2001), p.479 Wriothesley and Secretary Paget tried to effect a necessary reconciliation, that prompted the former to step down.Letters and Papers of the Reign of King Henry VII; Weir, p.479 Hertford was sent north to fight the Scots, when on 22 April 1544, Lord Audley died, leaving Wriothesley to be appointed Lord Chancellor the next month, at a time when Gardiner's power was waning. Ever the unscrupulous schemer, Wriothesley was purposely chosen to keep both papists and reformists at bay. The King relied heavily on his aristocratic friends Suffolk and Wriothesley to secure a balance of power in the Privy Chamber. So the King prepared an invasion of France, much to the nobility's approval.Weir (2001), p.479-80 Wriothesley was created Baron Wriothesley of Titchfield in 1544. But as Lord Chancellor he became notorious for torturing Anne Askew, a self-confessed Protestant, personally operating the wheel on the rack. The Catholic faction was determined to root out heresy, suspecting Queen Catherine's influence over the royal children. When Gardiner tried to arrest Surrey's friends with Wriothesley's support, the earl was severely reprimanded by the King. On 6 July 1546 the King moved to Greenwich Palace; with the conservatives holding the Secretaryship, Chancellor, and with leading privy councillors, they tried to make further arrests. Wriothesley secured the royal warrant for Catherine's arrest but when he went to present it to the king, he was despatched by the King as \\"Arrant knave! Beast! Fool!\\", a humiliation especially damaging given that his faction was already in decline. By September 1546 they were outnumbered by the reformists; his hatred for Hertford had deepened. Privy Council meetings broke out into fisticuffs. The Lord Chancellor conducted French Lord Admiral Claud d'Annebaut to Hampton Court for a royal audience. He accompanied the royal progress, and joined the hunting at Windsor, but Wriothesley had lost control of the Privy Chamber. Speechless and overcome with grief Lord Chancellor Wriothesley could do nothing to prevent Hertford from taking control in defiance of the late King's will.; Weir (2001), p.503 Under Edward VI He was one of the executors of Henry's will, and in accordance with the dead King's wishes he was created Earl of Southampton on 16 February 1547 and was a member of the Regency Council that would rule collectively during King Edward VI's minority.; He was one of the few members of the council to oppose the rise of the king's maternal uncle, Edward Seymour, 1st Duke of Somerset, to the position of Lord Protector. Wriothesley objected to Somerset's assumption of monarchical power over the Council. In March 1547, he then found himself abruptly dismissed from the chancellorship on charges of selling off some of his offices to delegates. Also he lost his seat on the Privy Council.; Later he was readmitted to the Council, and he took a leading part in bringing about the fall of the Duke of Somerset, but he had not regained his former position when he died on 30 July 1550. His successor in the earldom was his son, Henry.

Biography ≈åta was a native of Nagara, Chiba. He graduated 64th out of 118 cadets from the 41st class of the Imperial Japanese Navy Academy in 1913. ≈åta served his midshipman duty on the cruiser on its long distance training voyage to Honolulu, San Pedro, San Francisco, Vancouver, Victoria, Tacoma, Seattle, Hakodate and Aomori. After his return to Japan, he was assigned to the battleship , and after he was commissioned an ensign, to the battleship . After promotion to lieutenant in 1916, he returned to naval artillery school, but was forced to take a year off active service from November 1917 to September 1918 due to tuberculosis. On his return to active duty, he completed coursework in torpedo school and advanced courses in naval artillery. After brief tours of duty on the battleships and Fus≈ç, he returned as an instructor at the Naval Engineering College. Japanese commanders on Okinawa prior to the Battle of Okinawa ≈åta also had experience with the Japanese Special Naval Landing Forces (SNLF, the Japanese equivalent of the Royal Marines), as he had been assigned command of a battalion of SNLF forces in the 1932 First Shanghai Incident. He was promoted to commander in 1934. In 1936, he was named executive officer of the battleship , and was finally given his first command, that of the oiler Tsurumi in 1937. He was promoted to captain in December the same year. =World War II= In 1938, with the start of the Second Sino-Japanese War, ≈åta was assigned to command the Kure 6th SNLF. In 1941, he was assigned to the command of the SNLF under the Japanese China Area Fleet at Wuhan in China. He returned to Japan the following year, and was assigned to command the 2nd Combined Special Naval Landing Force that was earmarked for the seizure of Midway in the event of a Japanese victory over the United States Navy at the Battle of Midway.Prange, Miracle at Midway, page 63 Although this never came to pass, he was promoted to rear admiral and commanded the 8th Combined Special Naval Landing Force at New Georgia against the American First Raider Battalion.Alexander. Storm Landings. Page 206 He then served in various administrative capacities until January 1945, when he was reassigned to Okinawa to command the Japanese Navy's forces as part of the Japanese reinforcement effort prior to the anticipated invasion by Allied forces.Astor. Operation Iceberg. page 462.Weist. The Pacific War:Campaigns of World War II. page 223 In Okinawa, ≈åta commanded a force with a nominal strength of 10,000 men. However, half were civilian laborers conscripted into service with minimal training, and the remainder were gunners from various naval vessels with little experience in fighting on land. Allied sources are contradictory on his role as commander of the naval elements in Okinawa. Some cite ≈åta as able to organize and lead them into an effective force, which fought aggressively against the Allied forces, \\"withdrawing slowly back to the fortified Oroku Peninsula.\\"Feifer, The Battle of Okinawa. But Naval elements, except for outlying islands were headquartered on the Oroku peninsula from the beginning of the battle.Yahara, Michihiro \\"The Battle for Okinawa\\" Operations Planning Colonel Hiromichi Yahara of the Japanese 32nd Army describes a miscommunication occurring in the order for Ota's Naval elements to withdraw from the Oroku Peninsula to support the army further south. What actually happened is clear: ≈åta began preparations on or around 24 May, for the withdrawal of all Naval elements to the south in support of the Army. He destroyed most heavy equipment, stocks of ammunition and even personal weapons. While in mid-march to the south, 32nd Army HQ ordered ≈åta back into the Oroku peninsula citing that a mistake had been made in timing (explanations vary). Naval elements returned to their former positions with no heavy weapons and about half the troops had no rifles. The Americans, who had not noticed the initial withdrawal attacked and cut off the peninsula by attacks from the north on land, and one last seaborne landing behind the Navy's positions. Naval elements then committed suicide with whatever weapons possible, with some leading a last charge out of the cave entrances. According to the museum for the underground Naval Headquarters in Okinawa, \\"many soldiers committed suicide\\" inside the command bunker, including ≈åta.http://kaigungou.ocvb.or.jp/about.html The Commander's Room of the underground Naval Headquarters. ≈åta committed suicide here.

After knee injuries dashed her hopes of ski success, she took up cycling and won the US National Road Championship, and then went on to be very successful at mountain bike events - during her short 6-year career in MTB Furtado won five national titles and represented her country at the Olympics. Early life Born on April 4, 1967, her father's parents were Portuguese from S√£o Miguel Island. She started skiing at age two, and racing at age 9 after her family moved to Vermont, where Furtado attended the Stratton Mountain School. At age 15 she became the youngest member of the U.S. National ski team, for which she competed from 1982 to 1987.\\"Juli Furtado's Story\\", julianabicycles.com After undergoing several knee operations, Furtado's hopes of competing in the Olympics were forced to an end, and she attended University of Colorado Boulder on a skiing scholarship, where she received her BA in Marketing. While racing for CU her knee injuries forced her to retire from competitive skiing, and Juliana switched to cycling. Cycling In 1989, her first year competing, Furtado won the US National Road Championship. She was then introduced to mountain biking, and 1990, again her first year competing, she won the cross-country event in (along with Ned Overend) the first official Mountain Bike World Championship, held in Durango, Colorado. In 1992 she won the downhill world championship. In 1996, Furtado won both the World Cup (her 3rd WC championship) and the NORBA (U.S. National race authority) cross-country championships. She also participated in the Atlanta Olympics. Unfortunately, though she was the overwhelming favorite to win, she suffered in the severe Atlanta sun and heat due to the as yet undetected Lupus in her system, and finished with an uncharacteristically slow 7th place. Soon after her Lupus was diagnosed,\\"Interview: Juli Furtado mountain biker, aka ‚ÄòThe Queen‚Äô\\" , 20th June 2013, Aoife Glass, totalwomenscycling.com and again Furtado was forced into early retirement from her sport due to physical conditions. Her disease is currently under control and she still rides solo. Women's bikes After retiring, Furtado started a company to design and produce female specific MTB components, such as smaller diameter handlebars and grips, stems, and seats. Her designs were eventually picked up by Santa Cruz Bikes. At the same time, Santa Cruz Bikes developed the first female specific cross-country aluminum MTB called the \\"Juliana\\". Furtado became the director of grass-roots sponsorship and marketing for Santa Cruz Bicycles, in Santa Cruz, California. In 2013, Furtado developed the concept for turning the single Juliana frame and associated components into a complete line of fully outfitted women's mountain bikes, which would be a first for Santa Cruz Bikes, which is primarily a frame producer. The Juliana line has 5 models comprising one of the world's largest women's MTB ranges in the industry. Legacy In 1998, the book \\"Rugged Racer\\" was written about Juliana's struggles and successes, overcoming injuries in her pursuit of her dream to compete in the Olympics. Despite a short MTB career of 6 years, Juliana held a Guinness World Record for most career 1st-place finishes in MTB (male or female), and at that time her career total wins even exceeded the combined total wins of the most successful man (Ned Overend) and next most successful woman. She became the mother of a son in 2008, and is currently working again with the U.S. National ski team, as an advocate for retiring athletes. Furtado was inducted into the Mountain Bike Hall of Fame in 1993 and the United States Bicycling Hall of Fame in 2005.

It is the main port and transportation hub for the central-southern coast of Central Sulawesi. Its urban area is consisting of three subdistricts, Poso Kota, North Poso Kota, and South Poso Kota. Poso lies in the middle of the province on the shore of the Gulf of Tomini, right in the central part of Sulawesi island. With the total of population of over 40,000, it is one of the biggest and the oldest towns in the province. Poso began to develop as a small port town located at the mouth of the Poso River at the end of the 19th century‚Äîmaking it one of the oldest towns in Central Sulawesi, and its presence was considered important for the Dutch to control the southern region of Tomini in the early days of their arrival. Poso was the administrative center of Landschap Poso, Onderafdeling Poso, and later Afdeling Poso during colonial times. In the midst of the World War II, the Japanese made Poso one of their military posts. Post-independence, Poso was chosen as the capital of the newly formed Central Sulawesi in 1948 before being moved to Palu in 1951. The central location of Poso has made it a stopover either from the north to the south, or from west to the east of Sulawesi. It is for this reason that the population of Poso consists of many different ethnicities, religions and backgrounds. People living in Poso are spread from the coastal area to the mountainous region, with the main sources of income being trade and services. Poso is crossed by Trans-Sulawesi National Highway and served by Kasiguncu Airport, linking it to other cities in Sulawesi such as Palu and Makassar.  Geography  = Climate = According to the K√∂ppen climate classification, Poso has tropical rainforest climate (Af). The average annual temperature is 25.8 ‚ÑÉ. The hottest month is October, with an average monthly temperature of 26.4 ‚ÑÉ. The wettest month is July, with monthly average temperatures reaching 25.3 ‚ÑÉ. The average annual rainfall is 1694.2 millimetres, and the maximum rainfall in July reaches 182.9 millimetres. The minimum monthly rainfall is January which reaches 111.8 millimetres. Annual rainfall is averaged 160.8 per days, with the most number of rainy days being in January, which reached 20.1 days; in contrast from September, whose average rainfall is only 8.1 days.  Tourism and culture  Children at the Protestant missionary school in Poso Poso can be reached by plane from Palu or by bus from many other big cities on Sulawesi, and is situated on the equator. It features tropical rain forest, seashore gardens and other natural scenery. Sintuwu Maroso Square is the main town square and located in central Poso.

Overview  Partial differential equations (PDEs) are used in all sciences to model phenomena. For the purpose of exposition, we give an example physical problem and the accompanying boundary value problem (BVP). Even if the reader is unfamiliar with the notation, the purpose is merely to show what a BVP looks like when written down. :(Model problem) The heat distribution in a square metal plate such that the left edge is kept at 1 degree, and the other edges are kept at 0 degree, after letting it sit for a long period of time satisfies the following boundary value problem: ::fxx(x,y) + fyy(x,y) = 0 ::f(0,y) = 1; f(x,0) = f(x,1) = f(1,y) = 0 :where f is the unknown function, fxx and fyy denote the second partial derivatives with respect to x and y, respectively. Here, the domain is the square [0,1] √ó [0,1]. This particular problem can be solved exactly on paper, so there is no need for a computer. However, this is an exceptional case, and most BVPs cannot be solved exactly. The only possibility is to use a computer to find an approximate solution. = Solving on a computer = A typical way of doing this is to sample f at regular intervals in the square [0,1] √ó [0,1]. For instance, we could take 8 samples in the x direction at x = 0.1, 0.2, ..., 0.8 and 0.9, and 8 samples in the y direction at similar coordinates. We would then have 64 samples of the square, at places like (0.2,0.8) and (0.6,0.6). The goal of the computer program would be to calculate the value of f at those 64 points, which seems easier than finding an abstract function of the square. There are some difficulties, for instance it is not possible to calculate fxx(0.5,0.5) knowing f at only 64 points in the square. To overcome this, one uses some sort of numerical approximation of the derivatives, see for instance the finite element method or finite differences. We ignore these difficulties and concentrate on another aspect of the problem. = Solving linear problems = Whichever method we choose to solve this problem, we will need to solve a large linear system of equations. The reader may recall linear systems of equations from high school, they look like this: :2a + 5b = 12 (*) :6a ‚àí 3b = ‚àí3 This is a system of 2 equations in 2 unknowns (a and b). If we solve the BVP above in the manner suggested, we will need to solve a system of 64 equations in 64 unknowns. This is not a hard problem for modern computers, but if we use a larger number of samples, even modern computers cannot solve the BVP very efficiently. = Domain decomposition = Which brings us to domain decomposition methods. If we split the domain [0,1] √ó [0,1] into two subdomains [0,0.5] √ó [0,1] and [0.5,1] √ó [0,1], each has only half of the sample points. So we can try to solve a version of our model problem on each subdomain, but this time each subdomain has only 32 sample points. Finally, given the solutions on each subdomain, we can attempt to reconcile them to obtain a solution of the original problem on [0,1] √ó [0,1].  Size of the problems  In terms of the linear systems, we're trying to split the system of 64 equations in 64 unknowns into two systems of 32 equations in 32 unknowns. This would be a clear gain, for the following reason. Looking back at system (*), we see that there are 6 important pieces of information. They are the coefficients of a and b (2,5 on the first line and 6,‚àí3 on the second line), and the right hand side (which we write as 12,‚àí3). On the other hand, if we take two \\"systems\\" of 1 equation in 1 unknown, it might look like this: :System 1: 2a = 12 :System 2: -3b = ‚àí3 We see that this system has only 4 important pieces of information. This means that a computer program will have an easier time solving two 1√ó1 systems than solving a single 2√ó2 system, because the pair of 1√ó1 systems are simpler than the single 2√ó2 system. While the 64√ó64 and 32√ó32 systems are too large to illustrate here, we could say by analogy that the 64√ó64 system has 4160 pieces of information, while the 32√ó32 systems each have 1056, or roughly a quarter of the 64√ó64 system.  Domain decomposition algorithm  Unfortunately, for technical reasons it is usually not possible to split our grid of 64 points (a 64√ó64 system of linear equations) into two grids of 32 points (two 32√ó32 systems of linear equations) and obtain an answer to the 64√ó64 system. Instead, the following algorithm is what actually happens: :1) Begin with an approximate solution of the 64√ó64 system. :2) From the 64√ó64 system, create two 32√ó32 systems to improve the approximate solution. :3) Solve the two 32√ó32 systems. :4) Put the two 32√ó32 solutions \\"together\\" to improve the approximate solution to the 64√ó64 system. :5) If the solution isn't very good yet, repeat from 2. There are two ways in which this can be better than solving the base 64√ó64 system. First, if the number of repetitions of the algorithm is small, solving two 32√ó32 systems may be more efficient than solving a 64√ó64 system. Second, the two 32√ó32 systems need not be solved on the same computer, so this algorithm can be run in parallel to use the power of multiple computers. In fact, solving two 32√ó32 systems instead of a 64√ó64 system on a single computer (without using parallelism) is unlikely to be efficient. However, if we use more than two subdomains, the picture can change. For instance, we could use four 16√ó16 problems, and there's a chance that solving these will be better than solving a single 64√ó64 problem even if the domain decomposition algorithm needs to iterate a few times.  A technical example  Here we assume that the reader is familiar with partial differential equations. We will be solving the partial differential equation :uxx \\\\+ uyy = f (**) We impose boundedness at infinity. We decompose the domain R¬≤ into two overlapping subdomains H1 = (‚àí ‚àû,1] √ó R and H2 = [0,+ ‚àû) √ó R. In each subdomain, we will be solving a BVP of the form: :u( j )xx \\\\+ u( j )yy = f in Hj :u( j )(xj,y) = g(y) where x1 = 1 and x2 = 0 and taking boundedness at infinity as the other boundary condition. We denote the solution u( j ) of the above problem by S(f,g). Note that S is bilinear. The Schwarz algorithm proceeds as follows: #Start with approximate solutions u( 1 )0 and u( 2 )0 of the PDE in subdomains H1 and H2 respectively. Initialize k to 1. #Calculate u( j )k + 1 = S(f,u(3 ‚àí j)k(xj)) with j = 1,2. #Increase k by one and repeat 2 until sufficient precision is achieved.

After the Islamic Revolution of 1979, he was one of the few Christian leaders to continue to evangelize. In 1994, he disappeared after protesting the Iranian government's treatment of converts to Christianity and is generally assumed to have been murdered by the state. The state, however, accuses the People's Mujahedin of Iran for his murder. Early life Hovsepian was born in 1945 in Tehran, Iran into an Armenian Apostolic middle-class family. He had three younger brothers: Edward, Roubik and George. When he was 15, he joined the Pentecostal Assemblies of God. In 1966, upon completion of his mandatory military service, Haik married Takoosh Ginagosian. In 1967, he pastored his first church in Majidieh, a suburb of the capital Tehran. Not long afterwards, he served in the military and was stationed in Gorgan, a city in Mazanderan, a northern province of Iran near the Caspian Sea, where he established a house church. In 1969 Hovsepian, his wife and their six-month-old child were driving from Tehran to Gorgan with an American missionary family, when their car struck an unlit tractor-trailer. The four children aboard were killed. The adult passengers survived, but Hovsepian and Takoosh suffered broken legs, from which they recovered. Christian ministry They returned to Gorgan, where they served in church pastoral work despite hardship and persecution. Hovsepian had a strong motivation to evangelise Iranian Muslims. He was an outspoken Christian apologist, evangelist and a gifted musician. He was responsible for initiating increased collaboration between evangelical churches within Iran after the Iranian Revolution. He became the Chairman of the Council of Protestant Ministers of Iran. Hovsepian spoke up for the rights of Christians in Iran. In 1993 he was one of only two church leaders to refuse to sign a declaration stating that they would not allow Muslims or Muslim converts into their churches. He also refused to sign a statement that Christians enjoyed full rights in Iran. He compiled a detailed report on violations of religious freedom and invited Professor Reynaldo Galindo Pohl, the United Nations Special Representative to Iran, to visit the country and meet Protestant ministers and government officials to discuss these violations. He also met the Ministry for Islamic Guidance for Minorities to call for the government to respect the rights of religious minorities set out in the 1979 Constitution. Bishop Hovsepian and the denomination he represented, the Assemblies of God, were ordered to comply with the following directives: # Church services could not be held in Persian, the official language of Iran; # Church members must be issued membership cards and produce them upon attendance; # Membership lists, complete with addresses, must be handed over to governmental authorities; # Meetings must be confined to Sunday, not Friday the officially recognized day of Muslim worship; # Only members could attend Sunday meetings; and # New members could only be added to the membership and admitted to meetings once the Ministry of Information and Islamic Guidance had been notified. Haik deliberately disobeyed and defiantly declared that \\"Never would [he or his ministers] bow down and comply with such inhumane and unjust demands\\" and that \\"our churches are open to all who want to come in.\\" Haik Hovsepian tomb in 2017 He was killed after protesting about the treatment of his friend and colleague Mehdi Dibaj at the hands of the Iranian government. Hovsepian mounted a campaign for Dibaj, and on January 16, 1994, Dibaj was released. Three days later Hovsepian vanished from Tehran. His death was reported to his family on January 30, 1994. While the government initially denied all involvement, Iranian Christians and independent observers claimed that he was murdered for his beliefs. Arresting two suspects On July 5, 1994, a few days after 1994 Imam Reza shrine bomb explosion, and months after Hovsepian Mehr's murder two women who were allegedly from People's Mujahedin of Iran and were going to bomb Mausoleum of Ruhollah Khomeini and Fatima Masumeh Shrine were arrested. In a TV interview, one of them related Hovsepian Mehr's murder to People's Mujahedin of Iran. Abdelfattah Amor, United Nations Special Rapporteur on the question of religious intolerance made a visit to Iran in 1995 where he was able to speak freely in Evin prison with the women charged with murder of Hovsepian Mehr and two other Christian leaders. Amor concluded in his UN report that the Iranian Government had apparently decided to execute Bishop Hovsepian Mehr and two other Christian leaders in order not only to disrepute the Mujahedin organization by declaring it responsible for those crimes, but also, to decapitate the Protestant community.Report submitted by Mr. Abdelfattah Amor, Special Rapporteur, in Report submitted by Mr. Abdelfattah Amor, Special Rapporteur, in accordance with Commission on Human Rights resolution 1995/23 accordance with Commission on Human Rights resolution 1995/23 Legacy Takoosh and her four children (Rebekkah, Joseph, Gilbert, and Andre) eventually migrated to California, to be surrounded by a large diaspora of Armenians and Persians, including family members and friends from Tehran. Takoosh and her children are frequently asked to speak at conferences, and their children are in different Christian ministries. Haik's brothers, who work as pastors, are also ministering outside Iran.

Popularly known as The Tragedy King and The First Khan, he has been credited with bringing realism to film acting since his first film. Kumar debuted as an actor in the film Jwar Bhata (1944), produced by Bombay Talkies. In a career spanning over five decades, Kumar worked in over 65 films. Kumar is known for roles in films such as the romantic Andaz (1949), the heartwarming Babul (1950), the impassioned Deedar (1951), the swashbuckling Aan (1952), social drama Daag (1952), the dramatic Devdas (1955), the comical Azaad (1955), Naya Daur (1957), Yahudi (1958), Madhumati (1958), Kohinoor (1960), the epic historical Mughal-e-Azam (1960), the social dacoit crime drama Gunga Jamuna (1961), and the comedy Ram Aur Shyam (1967). In 1976, Kumar took a five-year break from film performances and returned with a character role in the film Kranti (1981) and continued his career playing leading roles in films such as Shakti (1982), Mashaal (1984), Karma (1986) and Saudagar (1991). His last film was Qila (1998). Kumar has won eight Filmfare Awards and is the first recipient of the Filmfare Best Actor Award (1954). He is a former Member of Indian Parliament. Dilip Kumar had a long relationship with actress Madhubala but never married her. He married actress Saira Bano in 1966. He and his wife Saira Bano currently live in the Bandra suburb of Mumbai in the state of Maharashtra in India. As of 2020, he is the last living male actor from Bollywood's Golden Age of movies. Early life Dilip Kumar was born Mohammad Yusuf KhanTNN (1 December 2017), \\"Dilip Kumar: Interesting chapters of the actor's life\\" , The Times of India. Retrieved 23 June 2018. to Ayesha Begum and Lala Ghulam Sarwar Khan, one of 12 children, on 11 December 1922 at home in the Qissa Khawani Bazaar area of Peshawar, British India. His father was a landlord and fruit merchant who owned orchards in Peshawar and Deolali near Nashik. Mohammad Yusuf Khan was schooled at Barnes School, Deolali, Nashik. He grew up in the same religiously mixed neighbourhood as Raj Kapoor, his childhood friend, and later his colleague in the film industry. In the latter half of 1940, while still in his teens and after an altercation with his father, Mohammad Yusuf Khan left home for Pune in Maharashtra. With the help of a Parsi caf√©-owner and an elderly Anglo-Indian couple, Kumar met a canteen contractor. Without letting on his family antecedents, he got the job on the merit of his knowledge of good written and spoken English. He set up a sandwich stall at the army club and when the contract ended, he headed home to Bombay, having saved Rs. 5000. In early 1943, anxious to start a venture to help his father with household finances, he met Dr. Masani at Churchgate Station, who asked him to accompany him to Bombay Talkies, in Malad. There he met actress Devika Rani, owner of Bombay Talkies, who asked him to sign up with the company on a salary of Rs. 1250 per month. There he met actor Ashok Kumar, who influenced his acting style by telling him to act \\"natural\\". He also met Sashadhar Mukherjee, and both of these people became close to Kumar over the years. Initially, Kumar helped out in the story-writing and scripting department because of his proficiency in Urdu language. Devika Rani requested him to change his name to Dilip Kumar, and later cast him in a lead role for Jwar Bhata (1944), which marked Kumar's entry into the Hindi film industry. Career =1940s= Nargis, Raj Kapoor and Kumar in a scene from the film Andaz (1949) Kumar's first film was Jwar Bhata in 1944, which went unnoticed. After a few more unsuccessful films, it was Jugnu (1947), in which he starred alongside Noor Jehan, that became his first major hit at the box office. His next major hits were the 1948 films Shaheed and Mela. He got his breakthrough role in 1949 with Mehboob Khan's Andaz, in which he starred alongside Raj Kapoor and Nargis. Shabnam also released that year was another box office hit =1950s= Kumar in Devdas (1955) Kumar went on to have success in the 1950s playing leading roles in several box office hits such as Jogan (1950), Babul (1950), Hulchul (1951), Deedar (1951), Daag (1952), Shikast (1953), Amar (1954), Uran Khatola (1955), Insaniyat (1955) in which he co-starred with Dev Anand, Devdas (1955), Naya Daur (1957), Yahudi (1958), Madhumati (1958) and Paigham (1959). Some of these films established his screen image as the \\"Tragedy King\\". Kumar briefly suffered from depression due to portraying many tragic roles and on the advice of his psychiatrist, he also took on light- hearted roles. Mehboob Khan's big-budget 1952 swashbuckling musical Aan featured him in one of his first lighter roles and marked his first film to be shot in technicolor and to have a wide release across Europe with a lavish premiere in London. He had further success with lighter roles as a thief in the comedy Azaad (1955), and as a royal prince in the romantic musical Kohinoor (1960) He was the first actor to win the Filmfare Best Actor Award (for Daag) and went on to win it a further seven times. He formed popular on- screen pairings with many of the top actresses at the time including Vyjayanthimala, Madhubala, Nargis, Nimmi, Meena Kumari and Kamini Kaushal. 9 of his films in the 1950s were ranked in the Top 30 highest-grossing films of the decade. In the 1950s, Kumar became the first actor to charge per film. =1960s= In 1960, he portrayed Prince Salim in K. Asif's big-budget epic historical film Mughal-e-Azam, which was the highest-grossing film in Indian film history for 11 years until it was surpassed by 1971 film Haathi Mere Saathi and later by the 1975 film Sholay. If adjusted for inflation, Mughal-e- Azam was the highest-grossing Indian film through to the early 2010s, equivalent to over 1000 crore in 2011. The film told the story of Prince Salim, who revolts against his father Akbar (played by Prithviraj Kapoor), and falls in love with a courtesan (played by Madhubala). The film was mostly shot in black and white, with only some scenes in the latter half of the film shot in colour. 44 years after its original release, it was fully colourised and re-released in 2004. In 1961, Kumar produced and starred in Ganga Jamuna opposite his frequent leading lady Vyjayanthimala and his brother Nasir Khan, this was the only film he produced. Kumar chose the shade of saree that Vyjayanthimala would wear in every scene.In 1962 British director David Lean offered him the role of \\"Sherif Ali\\" in his film Lawrence of Arabia (1962), but Kumar declined to perform in the movie. The role eventually went to Omar Sharif, the Egyptian actor. Kumar comments in his much later released autobiography, \\"he thought Omar Sharif had played the role far better than he himself could have\\". Kumar was also being considered for a leading role opposite Elizabeth Taylor in a film that Lean was working on called Taj Mahal, before the project was cancelled. His next film Leader (1964) was a below average grosser at the box office. He was the co-director alongside Abdul Rashid Kardar of his next release Dil Diya Dard Liya in 1966, but was uncredited as director. In 1967, Kumar played a dual role of twins separated at birth in the hit film Ram Aur Shyam. In 1968, he starred alongside Manoj Kumar and Waheeda Rehman in Aadmi. That same year he starred in Sunghursh with Vyjayanthimala which was their last film together which created a total of seven hit films together. =1970s= Kumar's career slumped in the 1970s with films like Dastaan (1972) failing at the box office. He starred alongside his real-life wife Saira Banu in Gopi (1970). They were paired again in his first and only Bengali language film Sagina Mahato (1970). A Hindi remake Sagina was made in 1974 with the same cast. He played triple roles as a father and his twin sons in Bairaag (1976) which failed to do well at the box office. He personally regarded M. G. Ramachandran's performance in Enga Veetu Pillai better than his role in Ram Aur Shyam. He regards his performance in Bairaag much higher than that of Ram Aur Shyam. Although his performance in Bairaag and Gopi were critically acclaimed, he lost many film offers to act in leading roles to actors Rajesh Khanna and Sanjeev Kumar, from 1968 to 1987. He took a five-year hiatus from films from 1976 to 1981.Meghnad Desai, Baron Desai (2004), Nehru's hero Dilip Kumar in the life of India, Lotus Collection, Roli Books, . =1980s= In 1981, he returned to films as a character actor playing central roles in ensemble films. His comeback film was the star- studded Kranti which was the biggest hit of the year. Appearing alongside an ensemble cast including Manoj Kumar, Shashi Kapoor, Hema Malini and Shatrughan Sinha, he played the title role as a revolutionary fighting for India's independence from British rule.Top Earners 1980‚Äì1989 (Figures in Ind Rs).

He then successfully collaborated with director Subhash Ghai starting with Vidhaata (1982), in which he starred alongside Sanjay Dutt, Sanjeev Kumar and Shammi Kapoor. Later that year he starred alongside Amitabh Bachchan in Ramesh Sippy's Shakti which was a hit grosser at the box office and won him critical acclaim and his eighth and final Filmfare Award for Best Actor. In 1984, he starred in Yash Chopra's social crime drama Mashaal opposite Anil Kapoor which failed at the box office but his performance was critically acclaimed. He also appeared alongside Rishi Kapoor in Duniya (1984) and Jeetendra in Dharm Adhikari (1986). His second collaboration with Subhash Ghai came with the 1986 ensemble action film Karma. Karma marked the first film which paired him opposite fellow veteran actress Nutan. Three decades earlier however, they were paired together in an incomplete and unreleased film titled Shikwa. He acted opposite Nutan again in the 1989 film Kanoon Apna Apna. =1990s= In 1991, Kumar starred alongside fellow veteran actor Raaj Kumar in Saudagar, his third and last film with director Subhash Ghai. This was his second film with Raaj Kumar after 1959's Paigham. Saudagar was Kumar's last box office success.Top grossers of 1991 (Figures in Ind Rs). Box Office India. Retrieved 31 July 2011. In 1993, he won the Filmfare Lifetime Achievement Award for his contribution to the industry for five decades. In 1992, producer Sudhakar Bokade announced a film titled Kalinga which would officially mark Kumar's directorial debut after he had allegedly previously ghost directed Ganga Jamuna (1961) and Dil Diya Dard Liya (1967). Kumar was also set to star in the title role with the cast including Raj Babbar, Raj Kiran, Amitoj Mann and Meenakshi Seshadri. After being delayed for several years, Kalinga was eventually left incomplete and shelved. In 1998, Kumar made his last film appearance in the box office flop Qila, where he played dual roles as an evil landowner who is murdered and as his twin brother who tries to solve the mystery of his death. =2000s‚Äìpresent= In 2001, Kumar was set to appear in a film titled Asar ‚Äì The Impact alongside Ajay Devgan and Priyanka Chopra, which was shelved. His classic films Mughal- e-Azam and Naya Daur were fully colourised and re-released in cinemas in 2004 and 2008 respectively. An unreleased film he had shot and completed in 1990 titled Aag Ka Dariya was set for a theatrical release in 2013 but has not been released to date. He was also set to appear in Subhash Ghai's war film, Mother Land, alongside Amitabh Bachchan and Shah Rukh Khan, but this film was shelved after Khan decided to leave the project. Public life Kumar with Saira Banu in 2007 Kumar was elected as a member of the Rajya Sabha, the upper house of the Parliament of India, by the Indian National Congress for the period 2000‚Äì2006 from Maharashtra. Kumar launched a Twitter account and his first tweet was on his 89th birthday in 2011. Personal life Kumar had fallen in love with Madhubala during the shooting of Tarana. They remained in a relationship for seven years until the Naya Daur court case, during which Kumar testified against Madhubala and her father, ending their relationship. They never worked together again after Mughal-e-Azam (1960).. In the late 1950s, Vyjayanthimala was linked by gossip magazines with Kumar, who has acted with her the most compared to any other actress, which resulted in great on- screen chemistry between them. While working for his home production Gunga Jumna (1961), it is said that Kumar handpicked the shade of sari that Vyjayanthimala would wear in every scene. In addition to that, film historians Bunny Reuben and Sanjit Narwekar have \\"confirmed\\" the Kumar & Vyjayanthimala's affair where they had said that Vyjayanthimala was Kumar's third love after Kamini Kaushal and Madhubala. In 1966 Kumar married actress Saira Banu, who was 22 years younger than him. He later married Hyderabad socialite Asma Sahiba, taking her as a second wife in 1981. That marriage ended in January 1983. He and his wife Saira Banu currently live in Bandra. Dilip Kumar does not have any children. In his biography \\"Dilip Kumar: The Substance and the Shadow\\", he revealed that Saira Banu conceived in 1972, but developed high blood pressure in her eighth month of pregnancy and the doctors couldn't save the baby, which had been strangulated by the umbilical cord. After that, they didnot have children believing that it was God's will. He is fluent in Urdu, Hindi, Hindko (his first language), Punjabi, Awadhi, Bhojpuri, Marathi, English, Bengali, Gujarati, Pashto, and Persian. His younger brother Nasir Khan (1924-1974) was also a noted film actor. Two of his younger brothers died during the coronavirus epidemic of 2020 after testing positive for Covid-19 : Aslam Khan died at the age of 88 in August 2020, and Ehsan Khan died at 90 in September 2020. Humanitarian work *Kumar has been involved with a number of charitable and social initiatives. He planned and conceptualised the famous Jogger's Park in Bandra, along with Sunil Dutt and Oliver Andrade.

Anne McLellan (born August 31, 1950) is a Canadian academic and politician. She was a cabinet minister in the Liberal governments of Jean Chr√©tien and Paul Martin, serving most recently as the ninth deputy prime minister of Canada from 2003-2006.  Early life  McLellan earned bachelor's degrees in Arts and Law from Halifax's Dalhousie University. She then earned a Master of Laws from King's College London in the United Kingdom in 1975. She became a professor of law, first at the University of New Brunswick and then, beginning in 1980, at the University of Alberta Faculty of Law where she served at various times as associate dean and dean. She has also served on the board of directors of the Canadian Civil Liberties Association.  Political career  Her first foray into politics was as the Liberal candidate for the riding of Edmonton Northwest in the 1993 general election, when she won her seat by 12 votes. She quickly became a rising star in the Liberal Party, being one of four Liberals elected in Alberta, and was named to cabinet as Minister of Natural Resources. McLellan has the prenominal \\"the Honourable\\" and the postnominal \\"PC\\" for life by virtue of being made a member of the Queen's Privy Council for Canada on November 4, 1993.

Andrew Duffy On March 18, 2019, in the context of the SNC-Lavalin affair Prime Minister Justin Trudeau, announced that McLellan would serve as a Special Advisor on whether a single minister should continue to hold the positions of Minister of Justice and Attorney General of Canada. She was also asked to analyze the operating policies and practices across the Cabinet, and the role of public servants and political staff in their interactions with the Minister of Justice and Attorney General of Canada. She was asked to provide independent recommendations (sic) to the Prime Minister by June 30, 2019. On October 29, 2019, following the 2019 Canadian federal election, in which the Liberal Party did not win any seats in Alberta and Saskatchewan, the Prime Minister's Office announced that Prime Minister Justin Trudeau had hired McLellan as an adviser.

Like other doctorates, the D.A. is an academic degree of the highest level. The D.A. is also frequently conferred as an honorary degree with the added designation of honoris causa. While the Ph.D. is the most common doctoral degree in the United States, the U.S. Department of Education and the National Science Foundation recognize numerous research-oriented doctoral degrees such as the D.A. as \\"equivalent\\",Research Doctorate Degrees and do not discriminate between them.  History  The idea for a Doctor of Arts degree was originally proposed at the 1932 meeting of the Association of American Universities by Wallace Atwood, then president of Clark University. In 1967 Carnegie Mellon University (formerly Carnegie Institute of Technology), began to offer the D.A. in Mathematics, History, English and Fine Arts.The Journal of Higher Education, Vol. 39, No. 5 (May 1968), pp. 261-270 The first Doctor of Arts degree in the United States was awarded in 1968, by Carnegie Mellon University, to Donald H. Taranto in the field of mathematics. Guiding principles for the Doctor of Arts degree was established in 1970 by the Committee on Graduate Studies of the American Association of State Colleges and Universities and by the Council of Graduate Schools in the United States. The Carnegie Foundation was the first to fund ten universities with seed money to initiate the degree, and D.A. programs (though far fewer in number than those of the Ph.D.) are currently offered in many different disciplines at universities in the United States and in other parts of the world. The D.A. differs from the Ph.D. and Ed.D degrees in its shift in emphasis from research (though a project or thesis is generally required) to the advanced study of a specific discipline, content area expertise, learning theory, and curriculum design. As such, it is often described as a \\"teaching doctorate\\". It offers scholars the breadth and diversity necessary to become teachers in their field. The D.A. also differs from the Ed.D. in its strong disciplinary focus, while still embracing the Ed.D.'s concern for issues in education, and a theoretical as well as practical preparation in pedagogy. (For more on this issue, see Ph.D.) Outside the United States  In Argentina the Doctorate of Arts it is offered by the NU of C and the NU of R, by achieving the title of Doctor of Arts or Doctor of Humanities. In Finland, the Doctor of Arts degree is a research degree awarded upon successful completion of studies and a dissertation in the fields of art and design. The Doctor of Arts degree awarded by the University of Art and Design Helsinki, for example, aims to prepare scholars who are capable of conducting independent, groundbreaking research and developing new artistic research methods or products that satisfy high artistic standards. In Australia, the Doctor of Creative Arts degree is offered at several universities as a terminal degree in the field. In 2016 ELIA (European League of Institute of the Arts) launched The Florence Principles on the Doctorate in the Arts.http://www.elia- artschools.org/userfiles/File/customfiles/1-the-florence- principles20161124105336_20161202112511.pdf The Florence Principles relating to the Salzburg Principles and the Salzburg Recommendations of EUA (European University Association) name seven points of attention to specify the Doctorate / Ph.D. in the Arts compared to a scientific doctorate / Ph.D. The Florence Principles have been endorsed and are supported also by AEC, CILECT, CUMULUS and SAR.

In the video, Reznor runs to the top of a building while Chris Vrenna and Richard Patrick follow him. The original version of the music video ended with the implication that Reznor's character had fallen off the building and died, an effect achieved by covering him in corn starch made to look like injuries.

Early career In 1985 at age fifteen, Cassaro became a design assistant and in-between artist for animated cartoons in the Maur√≠cio de Sousa studios. In 1989 he was hired as an artist and screenwriter by Abril Jovem for television shows like Joe Carioca, Os Trapalh√µes, and Jaspion. Award winning writer and artist In 1999 Cassaro created with artist Erica Awano the manga book Holy Avenger; it became the longest published non-child-oriented comic in Brazil. Like Japanese manga, the first three pages of each chapter were printed in color, while the remaining pages were black and white, and each issue had a two-page map showing the journey of the characters, a summary of previous events, and profiles of the main characters.

It is situated outside the Royal Courts of Justice on the Strand. Although the first church on the site was reputedly founded in the 9th century by the Danes, the current building was completed in 1682 by Sir Christopher Wren. Wren's building was gutted during the Blitz and not restored until 1958, when it was adapted to its current function as the central church of the Royal Air Force. The church is sometimes claimed to be the one featured in the nursery rhyme \\"Oranges and Lemons\\" and the bells do indeed play that tune. However, St Clement's Eastcheap, in the City of London, also claims to be the church from the rhyme. St Clement Danes is known as one of the two 'Island Churches', the other being St Mary-le-Strand. History =Connection to the Danes= There are several possible theories as to the connection between the Danes and the origins of the church. A popular theory is that in the 9th century, the Danes colonized the village of Aldwych on the river between the City of London and the future site of Westminster. This was at a time when half of England was Danish and London was on the dividing line between the English and the Danes. The Danes founded a church at Aldwych, hence the final part of its name (in Latin it was known as Ecclesia Clementes Danorum). Alternatively, after Alfred the Great had driven the Danes out of the City of London and they had been required to accept Christianity, Alfred stipulated the building of the church. In either case, being a seafaring people, the Danes named the church they built after St Clement, patron saint of mariners. Other possible ideas are that in the 11th century after Siward, Earl of Northumbria killed the Dane Tosti, Earl of Huntingdon and his men, the deceased were buried in a field near London and a memorial church was subsequently built to honour the memory of the Danes. Also possible is that the Danish connection was reinforced by a massacre recorded in the J√≥msv√≠kinga saga when a group of unarmed Danes who had gathered for a church service were killed. The 12th-century historian William of Malmesbury wrote that the Danes burnt the church on the site of St Clement Danes before they were later slain in the vicinity. Another possible explanation for the name is that, as King Harold I \\"Harefoot\\" is recorded as having been buried in the church in March 1040, the church acquired its name on account of Harold's Danish connections. =Medieval church= The church was first rebuilt by William the Conqueror, and then again later in the Middle Ages. A new chancel was built over part of the churchyard in 1608, at a cost of more than ¬£1,000, and various repairs and improvements to the tower and other parts of the church cost ¬£496 in 1618. Shortly after the Great Fire of 1666, further repairs to the steeple were attempted, but these were found impractical, and the whole tower was rebuilt from the foundations. Work was completed in 1669. Soon afterwards it was decided that the rest of the church was in such a poor state that it too should be completely rebuilt. =Seventeenth-century rebuilding= Interior of the church, looking east St Clement's was rebuilt between 1680 and 1682 to a design by Sir Christopher Wren, incorporating the existing tower which was reclad. The new church was constructed from Portland Stone, with an apse at the east end. A steeple was added to the tower in 1719 by James Gibbs. The interior has galleries on three sides supported by square pillars, continued above gallery level as Corinthian columns, supporting, in turn, a barrel-vaulted ceiling. Wren used the same scheme again at St James's Church, Piccadilly, begun two years later. Above the galleries, each bay has a cross vault, allowing the building to be lit from large round-headed windows on the upper level. =Later history= St Clement Danes ablaze on 10 May 1941 William Webb Ellis, often credited with the invention of Rugby football in 1823, was once rector of the church and is commemorated by a memorial tablet. In 1844, St. Clement Danes School was constructed on land on Houghton Road, Holborn which the churchwardens had purchased in 1552. It opened in 1862 and remained there until 1928, then moved to Shepherd's Bush until 1975, when it was finally re-established as a comprehensive school in Chorleywood, Hertfordshire. The church was almost destroyed by German bombs during the London Blitz on 10 May 1941. The outer walls, the tower and Gibbs's steeple survived the bombing, but the interior was gutted by fire. As a result of the blaze, the church's ten bells fell to the ground. Subsequently, they were placed in storage and were recast after the war.http://bbm.org.uk/of-interest/places-of-interest/st-clement-danes- church/ =As the Central Church of the Royal Air Force= Following an appeal for funds by the Royal Air Force, the church was completely restored under the supervision of Sam Lloyd. It was re-consecrated on 19 October 1958 to become the Central Church of the Royal Air Force. As part of the rebuilding, the following inscription was added under the restored Royal coat of arms: which may be translated as: \\"Christopher Wren built it 1672. The thunderbolts of aerial warfare destroyed it 1941. The Royal Air Force restored it 1958.\\" [Error in the inscription: MDCLXXII should be MDCLXXXII, i.e. 1682 not 1672] Current worship and customs Services are regularly held to commemorate prominent occasions of the RAF and its associated organisations. Saint Clement is commemorated every April at St Clement Danes, a modern clementine custom/revival. The Reverend William Pennington-Bickford initiated the service in 1919 to celebrate the restoration of the famous church bells and carillon, which he'd had altered to ring out the popular nursery rhyme. This special service for children ends with the distribution of oranges and lemons to the boys and girls. Formerly William Bickford, William Pennington-Bickford (died 1941) was Rector from 1910 to 1941 and he and his wife Louisa became known for their devotion to the welfare of the parish. (He had succeeded his father-in- law in the benefice.) In 2008, the church was one of the venues where people gathered as part of the Armed Forces Day of Prayer.http://www.eauk.org/idea/christians-in-the-line-of-fire.cfm On the 100th anniversary of the foundation of the RAF, celebrations took place at St Clement Danes.https://www.westminster-abbey.org/abbey-news/westminster-abbey- celebrates-the-centenary-of-the-raf/ Royal Air Force features There are features throughout and outside the building commemorating people and units of the RAF. =Statues= Outside the church stand statues of two of the RAF's wartime leaders, Arthur \\"Bomber\\" Harris and Hugh Dowding. The erection of the statue of Harris was controversial due to his responsibility for the bombing of Dresden and other bombing campaigns against German cities. Despite protests from Germany, including from the mayors of Dresden and Hamburg as well as some in Britain, the Bomber Harris Trust (an RAF veterans' organisation) erected a statue of him outside the RAF Church of St. Clement Danes in 1992. It was unveiled by Queen Elizabeth, the Queen Mother who looked surprised when she was jeered by protesters. The line on the statue reads \\"The Nation owes them all an immense debt\\". The statue had to be guarded by policemen day and night for some time as it was frequently sprayed with graffiti. =Memorials= The Polish Air Forces memorial on the floor of the church The floor of the church, of Welsh slate, is inscribed with the badges of over 800 RAF commands, groups, stations, squadrons and other formations. Near the entrance door is a ring of the badges of Commonwealth air forces, surrounding the badge of the RAF. There is also a memorial to Marshal of the Royal Air Force Arthur Tedder, 1st Baron Tedder, whose ashes lie in the church. A memorial to the Polish airmen and squadrons who fought in the defence of the United Kingdom and the liberation of Europe in the Second World War is positioned on the floor of the north aisle. Books of Remembrance listing the names of all the RAF personnel who have died in service, as well as those American airmen based in the United Kingdom who died during the Second World War. Near the altar are plaques listing the names of RAF, Royal Flying Corps, Royal Naval Air Service, and Commonwealth personnel awarded the Victoria Cross and the George Cross. =Donations and artefacts= In the gallery hang the Queen's Colours and Standards of active RAF squadrons, (these Colours/Standards having been retired and replaced by newer versions), along with standards of several now disbanded squadrons plus the Royal Banner of the Royal Observer Corps, (most standards of disbanded squadrons hang in the rotunda of the RAF College Cranwell). Pulpits, pews and chairs in the body of the church have been presented by various people, including past chiefs of the Air Staff, Sir Douglas Bader and the Guinea Pig Club. The armorial achievement of Lord Trenchard is displayed above the main entrance at the west end of the church. The lectern was a gift from the Royal Australian Air Force, the Cross from the Air Training Corps, the altar from the Dutch embassy. The church's font was donated by the Royal Norwegian Air Force, and is located in the crypt. The Paschal Candle was given by the Royal Belgian Air Force. Information on the donated organ is to be found in the next section.

This went through several rebuildings over the next 250 years, but was finally destroyed in the Second World War. A new organ, situated facing the altar in the gallery, was installed by the builder Harrison and Harrison in 1958. This was a gift from the United States Air Force. The case was made as a replica of the Father Smith organ previously destroyed. A specification of the organ can be found on the National Pipe Organ Register. =Organists= *Anthony Young 1707‚Äì1747 *Samuel Howard ????‚Äì1782 *Thomas Smart 1782‚Äì1803 *John Purkis 1804‚Äì1849 *Frederick Scotson Clark *Edwin Matthew Lott 1860‚Äì1864 *Charles Edward Stephens 1864‚Äì1869 *Edmund Barnes 1869‚Äì1882 *Charles King Hall 1880‚Äì???? *F.

The primary school is located nearby on Drury Lane in Covent Garden. The secondary school, built in 1975, is in Chorleywood, Hertfordshire. Masonic Lodge In 1871 a Masonic Lodge was consecrated at the request of several local Freemasons, who wanted to meet in a local Lodge instead of having to travel out of the parish. The petition was accepted by the then Grand Master, the Earl de Grey and Ripon; accordingly the St Clement Danes Lodge was formed and granted a Warrant of Constitution, along with the registration number 1351 on the register of the United Grand Lodge of England. The first meeting of the Lodge was on 4 May 1871 at the King's Head public house at 265 Strand, and the Rector of the Church, the Reverend R J Simpson, was the first Chaplain of the Lodge. The Lodge held meetings at various hotels and restaurants within the parish for many years, before amending its Constitution to allow it to meet at Freemasons' Hall, Great Queen Street, London, where it still meets today. In fiction The statue of Dr Samuel Johnson at the eastern end of the church land, comes to life as the character \\"Dictionary\\", in Charlie Fletcher's children's book about unLondon, Stoneheart. The novel Nineteen Eighty-Four has the protagonist encountering a picture of the church from prior to the war ‚Äì a building which he has known only as a ruin, never having been rebuilt. (The plot of the book, written in 1948, assumes a Third World War breaking out in the early 1950s, followed by a period of deep crisis and civil war in Britain and the rise of a totalitarian regime banning all religion).

It is sometimes erroneously referred to as the Boston Commons. Dating from 1634, it is the oldest city park in the United States. The Boston Common consists of of land bounded by Tremont Street (139 Tremont St.), Park Street, Beacon Street, Charles Street, and Boylston Street. The Common is part of the Emerald Necklace of parks and parkways that extend from the Common south to Franklin Park in Jamaica Plain, Roxbury, and Dorchester. A visitors' center for all of Boston is located on the Tremont Street side of the park. Aerial view in 2017 The Central Burying Ground is located on the Boylston Street side of Boston Common and contains the burial sites of the artist Gilbert Stuart and the composer William Billings. Also buried there are Samuel Sprague and his son, Charles Sprague, one of America's earliest poets. Samuel Sprague was a participant in the Boston Tea Party and fought in the Revolutionary War. The Common was designated as a Boston Landmark by the Boston Landmarks Commission in 1977. History Granary Burying Ground View of John Hancock's house from across the Common, 1768 Boston Street Scene, Edward Mitchell Bannister, a depiction of the street and Boston Common area in 1898‚Äì99. Boston Common aerial view Boston Common originally included the entire block northeast of where Park Street is now, bounded by Beacon Street and Tremont Street. What is now called the Granary Burying Ground was established on this land in 1660, as part of the Common. In 1662, the land was separated from the Common; the southwest portion of the block was taken for public buildings including the Granary and a house of correction, and the north portion of the block was used for housing. The Common's purpose has changed over the years. It was once owned by William Blaxton (often given the modernized spelling \\"Blackstone\\"), the first European settler of Boston, until it was bought from him in 1634 by the Puritan founders of the Massachusetts Bay Colony. During the 1630s, it was used by many families as a cow pasture. However, this only lasted for a few years, as affluent families bought additional cows, which led to overgrazing, a real-life example of the \\"tragedy of the commons\\". After grazing was limited in 1646 to 70 cows at a time,Boston Common & Public Gardens - Great Public Spaces  Project for Public Spaces . PPS. Retrieved on 2013-08-21. the Boston Common continued to host cows until they were formally banned from it in 1830 by Mayor Harrison Gray Otis.Lowen, James (1994) Planning the City Upon a Hill: Boston Since 1630University of Massachusetts Press (Boston) , , p. 53 Execution of Ann Hibbins on Boston Common, on charges of witchcraft, June 19, 1656. Sketch by F.T. Merril, 1886 The Common was used as a camp by the British before the American Revolutionary War, from which they left for the Battle of Lexington and Concord. It was used for public hangings up until 1817, most of which were from a large oak which was replaced with a gallows in 1769. On June 1, 1660, Quaker Mary Dyer was hanged there by the Puritans for repeatedly defying a law that banned Quakers from the Colony.Rogers, Horatio, 2009.

New York: Perennial, 2003. p.51 Central Burying Ground on Boston Common 1890 Map of Boston Common and the adjacent Public Garden True park status seems to have emerged no later than 1830, when the grazing of cows was ended and renaming the Common as Washington Park was proposed. Renaming the bordering Sentry Street to Park Place (later to be called Park Street) in 1804 already acknowledged the reality. By 1836, an ornamental iron fence fully enclosed the Common and its five perimeter malls or recreational promenades, the first of which, Tremont Mall, had been in place since 1728, in imitation of St. James's Park in London. Given these improvements dating back to 1728, a case could be made that Boston Common is in fact the world's first public urban park, since these developments precede the establishment of the earliest public urban parks in England‚ÄîDerby Arboretum (1840), Peel Park, Salford (1846), and Birkenhead Park (1847)‚Äîwhich are often considered the first. Originally, the Charles Street side of Boston Common, along with the adjacent portions of the Public Garden, were used as an unofficial dumping ground, due to being the lowest-lying portions of the two parks; this, along with the Garden's originally having been a salt marsh, resulted in the portions of the two parks being \\"a moist stew that reeked and that was a mess to walk over\\", driving visitors away from these areas. Although plans had long been in place to regrade the Charles Street-facing portions of Boston Common and the Public Garden, the cost of moving the amount of soil necessary (approximately , weighing , for the Common, plus an additional , weighing , for the adjoining portions of the Public Garden) prevented the work from being undertaken. This finally changed in the summer of 1895, when the required quantity of soil was made available as a result of the excavation of the Tremont Street subway, and was used to regrade the Charles Street sides of both Boston Common and the Public Garden. A hundred people gathered on the Common in early 1965 to protest the Vietnam War. A second protest happened on October 15, 1969, this time with 100,000 people protesting.Zinn, Howard. p.486 Ice skaters at Boston Common Frog Pond in downtown Boston, Massachusetts Today, the Common serves as a public park for all to use for formal or informal gatherings. Events such as concerts, protests, softball games, and ice skating (on Frog Pond) often take place in the park. Famous individuals such as Martin Luther King Jr. and Pope John Paul II have made speeches there. Judy Garland gave her largest concert ever (100,000+) on the Common, on August 31, 1967. It was declared a U.S. National Historic Landmark in 1987. and The Boston Common is a public park managed by the Boston Park Department and cared for by Friends of the Public Garden, a private advocacy group, which also provides additional funding for maintenance and special events.http://www.friendsofthepublicgarden.org Mikhail Gorbachev gave a speech in the Common on May 31, 1990 on his way to Washington D.C. to sign agreements with U.S. President George H.W.

On August 27, 2007, two teenagers were shot on the Common. One of the bullets fired during the shooting struck the Massachusetts State House. A strict curfew has since been enforced, which has been protested by the homeless population of Boston. On January 21, 2017, approximately 175,000 people marched from the common to the Back Bay vicinity to profess resistance to the perceived anti-women viewpoints held by president Donald Trump. On August 19, 2017, approximately 40,000 people marched from Roxbury Crossing to Boston Common to protest hate speech and white supremacy, in the wake of events in Charlottesville, VA the week before. A right-wing \\"Free Speech\\" rally had been planned on Boston Common, which some feared would draw members of the KKK, Neo Nazis and other hate groups.

Used as the basis for Bakelite, PFs were the first commercial synthetic resins (plastics). They have been widely used for the production of molded products including billiard balls, laboratory countertops, and as coatings and adhesives. They were at one time the primary material used for the production of circuit boards but have been largely replaced with epoxy resins and fiberglass cloth, as with fire-resistant FR-4 circuit board materials. There are two main production methods. One reacts phenol and formaldehyde directly to produce a thermosetting network polymer, while the other restricts the formaldehyde to produce a prepolymer known as volcano which can be moulded and then cured with the addition of more formaldehyde and heat.A. Gardziella, L.A. Pilato, A. Knop, Phenolic Resins: Chemistry, Applications, Standardization, Safety and Ecology, 2nd edition, Springer, 2000Wolfgang Hesse \\"Phenolic Resins\\" in Ullmann's Encyclopedia of Industrial Chemistry, 2002, Wiley-VCH, Weinheim. . There are many variations in both production and input materials that are used to produce a wide variety of resins for special purposes. Formation and structure Phenol-formaldehyde resins, as a group, are formed by a step-growth polymerization reaction that can be either acid- or base- catalysed. Since formaldehyde exists predominantly in solution as a dynamic equilibrium of methylene glycol oligomers, the concentration of the reactive form of formaldehyde depends on temperature and pH. Phenol reacts with formaldehyde at the ortho and para sites (sites 2, 4 and 6) allowing up to 3 units of formaldehyde to attach to the ring. The initial reaction in all cases involves the formation of a hydroxymethyl phenol: : HOC6H5 \\\\+ CH2O ‚Üí HOC6H4CH2OH The hydroxymethyl group is capable of reacting with either another free ortho or para site, or with another hydroxymethyl group. The first reaction gives a methylene bridge, and the second forms an ether bridge: : HOC6H4CH2OH + HOC6H5 ‚Üí (HOC6H4)2CH2 \\\\+ H2O : 2 HOC6H4CH2OH ‚Üí (HOC6H4CH2)2O + H2O The diphenol (HOC6H4)2CH2 (sometimes called a \\"dimer\\") is called bisphenol F, which is an important monomer in the production of epoxy resins. Bisphenol-F can further link generating tri- and tetra-and higher phenol oligomers. Novolacs Segment of a novolak, illustrating the predominance of cresol subunits and presence of crosslinking. Novolaks (or novolacs) are phenol-formaldehyde resins with a formaldehyde to phenol molar ratio of less than one. In place of phenol itself, they are often produced from cresols (methylphenols). The polymerization is brought to completion using acid- catalysis such as sulfuric acid, oxalic acid, hydrochloric acid and rarely, sulfonic acids. The phenolic units are mainly linked by methylene and/or ether groups. The molecular weights are in the low thousands, corresponding to about 10‚Äì20 phenol units. Obtained polymer is thermoplastic and require a curing agent or hardener to form a thermoset. Hexamethylenetetramine is a hardener added to crosslink novolac. At a temperature greater than 90 ¬∞C, it forms methylene and dimethylene amino bridges. Novolacs have multiple uses as tire tackifier, high temperature resin, binder for carbon bonded refractories, carbon brakes, photoresists and as a curing agent for epoxy resins. Resoles Base-catalysed phenol-formaldehyde resins are made with a formaldehyde to phenol ratio of greater than one (usually around 1.5). These resins are called resoles. Phenol, formaldehyde, water and catalyst are mixed in the desired amount, depending on the resin to be formed, and are then heated. The first part of the reaction, at around 70 ¬∞C, forms a thick reddish-brown tacky material, which is rich in hydroxymethyl and benzylic ether groups. The rate of the base-catalysed reaction initially increases with pH, and reaches a maximum at about pH = 10. The reactive species is the phenoxide anion (C6H5O‚àí) formed by deprotonation of phenol. The negative charge is delocalised over the aromatic ring, activating sites 2, 4 and 6, which then react with the formaldehyde. Being thermosets, hydroxymethyl phenols will crosslink on heating to around 120 ¬∞C to form methylene and methyl ether bridges through the elimination of water molecules. At this point the resin is a 3-dimensional network, which is typical of polymerised phenolic resins. The high crosslinking gives this type of phenolic resin its hardness, good thermal stability, and chemical imperviousness. Resoles are referred to as \\"one step\\" resins as they cure without a cross linker unlike novolacs, a \\"two step\\" resin. Resoles are major polymeric resin materials widely used for gluing and bonding building materials. Exterior plywood, oriented strand boards (OSB), engineered laminated composite lumber (LCL) are typical applications. Crosslinking and the formaldehyde/phenol ratio When the molar ratio of formaldehyde:phenol reaches one, in theory every phenol is linked together via methylene bridges, generating one single molecule, and the system is entirely crosslinked. This is why novolacs (F:P <1) do not harden without the addition of a crosslinking agents, and why resoles with the formula F:P >1 will. Applications Phenolic resins are found in myriad industrial products. Phenolic laminates are made by impregnating one or more layers of a base material such as paper, fiberglass, or cotton with phenolic resin and laminating the resin-saturated base material under heat and pressure. The resin fully polymerizes (cures) during this process forming the thermoset polymer matrix. The base material choice depends on the intended application of the finished product. Paper phenolics are used in manufacturing electrical components such as punch-through boards, in household laminates, and in paper composite panels. Glass phenolics are particularly well suited for use in the high speed bearing market. Phenolic micro-balloons are used for density control. The binding agent in normal (organic) brake pads, brake shoes, and clutch discs are phenolic resin. Synthetic resin bonded paper, made from phenolic resin and paper, is used to make countertops. Another use of phenolic resins is the making of Duroplast, used in the Trabant automobiles. Phenolic resins are also used for making exterior plywood commonly known as weather and boil proof (WBP) plywood because phenolic resins have no melting point but only a decomposing point in the temperature zone of and above. Phenolic resin is used as a binder in loudspeaker driver suspension components which are made of cloth. Higher end billiard balls are made from phenolic resins, as opposed to the polyesters used in less expensive sets. Sometimes people select fibre reinforced phenolic resin parts because their coefficient of thermal expansion closely matches that of the aluminium used for other parts of a system, as in early computer systems J.

They are closely related to the giant salamanders (family Cryptobranchidae), with which they form the suborder Cryptobranchoidea. About half of hynobiids currently described are unique to Japan.(Hasumi 2002). Hynobiid salamanders practice external fertilization, or spawning. And, unlike other salamander families which reproduce internally, male hynobiids focus on egg sacs rather than females during breeding.(Hasumi, 2002). The female lays two egg sacs at a time, each containing up to 70 eggs. Parental care is common. A few species have very reduced lungs, or no lungs at all. Larvae can sometimes have reduced external gills if they live in cold and very oxygen-rich water.Hasumi, M. (2002). About hynobiids. Retrieved May 8, 2005 from .

Prior to 1844, Ancroft lay within the Islandshire exclave of County Durham. It is south of Berwick-upon-Tweed, and has a population of 885, rising slightly to 895 at the 2011 census. There are several suggestions as to how Ancroft got its name. It might be an abridged version of \\"Aidan's-croft\\" - the croft of St Aidan who was the first Bishop of Lindisfarne (Holy Island). Alternatively, it might be that as the church is dedicated to Saint Anne, the village took its name from the church - \\"St Anne's croft\\". A third suggestion is simply that it means one croft or solitary croft - \\"ane croft\\". St Anne's Church, Ancroft There was surely more than one croft here when the church was built, probably towards the end of the 11th century; but in common with most of this region, the community declined in the latter part of the 13th century because of the continual border raids by the Scots. This turbulent history is reflected in the number of castles and peel towers in the vicinity, besides the fortified tower that was added to the church in the thirteenth century. Because of the repeated incursions by Scots, this northern part of what we now call Northumberland was placed in the charge of the prince-bishops of Durham. They were powerful and wealthy men who had the resources to defend the border. That is why this area was still part of County Durham until the mid 1800s. After the accession of James I (James VI of Scotland) to the throne of England in 1603 there seems to have been a return of people to the village. But in 1667 the plague struck Ancroft, The victims were carried out into the fields where they were covered with shelters made from branches of broom. After death both bodies and shelters were burned in a rudimentary and fruitless attempt to control the spread of the disease. To this day a field to the south of the village is called \\"Broomie Huts\\". In desperation the authorities of the day ordered that the plague-affected cottages should be burned to the ground. The mounds where the cottages stood, and the former village street, can still be seen in the field between the main road and the burn. By the time of Queen Anne (1702‚Äì1714) the village was flourishing once more, with a population of over one thousand. The main industry, other than farming, was shoe and clog making. Sailors of the Royal Navy wore shoes or slippers from Ancroft. The naval specification required footwear with no metal parts - an obvious precaution to avoid sparks in a wooden ship loaded with gunpowder and tarred rope! Boots were also made for the British army - the Duke of Marlborough's troops marched to victory shod in Ancroft boots. A village tradition claims that each of the one hundred trees on the southern skyline represents a cobbler. Several of the local settlements originated around coal mines, an industry which is being redeveloped in today's open cast sites. Landmarks The Devil's Causeway passes the village less than to the east. The causeway is a Roman road which starts at Port Gate on Hadrian's Wall, north of Corbridge, and extends northwards across Northumberland to the mouth of the River Tweed at Berwick-upon-Tweed.

Created in 1885 as the Lord Chancellor's Office with a small staff to assist the Lord Chancellor in his day-to-day duties, the department grew in power over the course of the 20th century, and at its peak had jurisdiction over the entire judicial system and a staff of over 22,000.Hughes (2003) p.56 In 2003, it was succeeded by the Department for Constitutional Affairs (now the Ministry of Justice). History The department was created in 1885 by Lord Selborne, who was the Lord Chancellor at the time. The Lord Chancellor was the only cabinet minister (other than those without portfolio) not to have a department of civil servants answerable to him, and justified the expenditure of creating a permanent department by saying that: > The Lord Chancellor, though Minister of Justice for almost every purpose > unconnected with the Criminal Law, had no assistance of the kind given to > the other chief Departments of State, either of permanent secretaries or > under secretaries. The officers attached to him were personal and liable to > change with every change of government.. but on each change of government > the lack of continuity was more or less felt; and as the Lord Chancellor's > Department work had a constant tendency to increase, the pressure of that > lack increased with it.Hall (2003) p.41 The department was originally named the Lord Chancellor's Office, with the first employees simply being transferred from Selborne's personal retinue to the new office. The need for the office was partly due to the Supreme Court of Judicature Acts of 1873 and 1875, which significantly changed the structure of the courts and increased the Lord Chancellor's workload as he struggled to enact the changes that the Acts required.Woodhouse (2001) p.42 Due to the odd nature of the Lord Chancellor's Office compared to other government departments (it was staffed almost entirely by lawyers and had an initial staff of only five) it developed slightly differently from other departments, regarding itself more as a lobbying organisation for the Judges and the Courts than a traditional government department.Woodhouse (2001) p.43 The office was initially little more than a personal entourage for the Lord Chancellor and did little administrative work, with it being described in 1912 as \\"not far removed from an interesting little museum\\".Jackson (1977) p.583 The appointment of Claud Schuster as Permanent Secretary in June 1915 changed this; he set about reforming the office to allow it to effectively run the court system. Initially with only a limited jurisdiction the Lord Chancellor's Department grew in power in the 1920s, with the transfer of control of the county courts from HM Treasury to the department in 1922 and the Supreme Court (consolidation) Act 1925.Hall (2003) p.111 The power of the department reached its peak after the Courts Act 1971 was passed, which modernised the English court system and put the Lord Chancellor's Department in direct control.Woodhouse (2001) p.46 Such a large increase in powers necessitated a change of office; previously the department had worked out of the Lord Chancellor's offices in the House of Lords, but it now moved to dedicated offices in Whitehall.Hall (2003) p.112 The passing of the Supreme Court Act 1981 and a 1992 move that transferred responsibility for the Magistrates Courts to the department also served to increase its responsibilities.Woodhouse (2001) p.47 The department ceased to exist as an independent body in 2003, when its functions were transferred to the newly created Department for Constitutional AffairsHall (2003) p.113 (which itself became the Ministry of Justice in 2007). Remit At the time of its merger the Lord Chancellor's Department was charged with appointing and advising on the appointment of judges, running the court system and a certain number of tribunals and assisting in the reform of the English law. To this end it controlled the Public Trust Office, the Courts Service, the Official Solicitor's Office, the Office of the Judge Advocate General, the Legal Aid Board and several more government agencies. Structure The office was run by the Permanent Secretary to the Lord Chancellor's Office, a senior member of Her Majesty's Civil Service who also served as Clerk of the Crown in Chancery. The office he ran was initially small, consisting of five individuals; the Permanent Secretary, his personal secretary, the personal secretary to the Lord Chancellor, the Secretary of Presentations (who advised the Lord Chancellor on the appointment of senior members of the Church of England) and the Secretary of Commissions (who advised the Lord Chancellor on the appointment of magistrates).Woodhouse (2001) p.41 The department stayed small compared to other ministerial departments; in the 1960s it had a staff of only 13 trained lawyers and a few secretaries.Hall (2003) p.38 The passing of the Courts Act 1971 and the additional duties it gave to the Lord Chancellor's Department forced it to expand, and by the time it ceased to exist as an independent department it had a staff of 12,000 direct employees, 10,000 indirect employees, 1,000 buildings (more than any other government department) and a yearly budget of ¬£2.4 billion.Hall (2003) p.57 Peculiarities The Lord Chancellor's Department was significantly different from other government departments in a number of ways. Until 1992 it had no representative in the House of Commons; as Speaker of the House of Lords the Lord Chancellor could not sit in the House of Commons.Hall (2003) p.50 The department was also exempt from being scrutinised by the Parliamentary select committees, something which changed in 1990. The Permanent Secretary also had to be a barrister of at least seven years standing, and the Deputy Secretary always succeeded the Permanent Secretary when he retired.Hall (2003) p.51 Both of these changed in 1990.

The company underwent a divestment of non-core businesses, and invested in four core product technology areas: secure storage, scalable storage, wireless/connectivity, and magnetic tape. As part of 3M, the company was involved in the development of many technological improvements in data storage, such as the introduction of the first American-made magnetic tape in 1947, the first quarter-inch tape cartridge for data storage (QIC) in 1971, and the floppy disk in 1984. In February 2012, Imation announced a product set to secure mobile data, identities, and workspaces, based on the idea that employees used portable storage devices to transport corporate data. The security news followed five acquisitions the company made in 2011 in scalable storage and data security: ENCRYPTX; MXI Security from Memory Experts International; the assets of ProStor; the secure data storage hardware business of IronKey; and intellectual property from Nine Technologies. Imation received an exclusive license from IronKey for its secure storage management software and service and a license to use the IronKey brand for secure storage products. In October 2011, Imation products for small and medium businesses centered on its DataGuard and InfiniVault multi-tier data protection and data archive appliances. The company sold consumer electronics, headphones and accessories under the Imation, Memorex, TDK Life on Record, and XtremeMac brands. The combined Imation, Memorex and TDK Life on Record brands made the company into a global market share leader in sales of CD-R and DVD media before that business was shut down in 2016. Imation changed its name to Glassbridge Enterprises on February 21, 2017. Net revenue for 2016 was $44.1 million, compared to $529.2 million the year before. Glassbridge Enterprises sold the Imation brand name to Korean company O-Jin Corporation Co., Ltd. on August 4, 2017. 2019 announced Imation licence-use by PNY Technology, Ritek Corporation and photo printer company Prinics.[http://www.imation.com/board/bbs/board.php?bo_table=news_en‚âÄ_id=10 imation.com, 2019-11-13, Imation global license announcement, retrieved 2020-09-13.

He is the co-discoverer of the first extrasolar planets and pulsar planets.  Early life and education  Wolszczan was born on 29 April 1946 in Szczecinek located in present-day West Pomeranian Voivodeship, Poland; in the 1950s his family moved to Szczecin. His father Jerzy Wolszczan taught economics at former Szczecin Polytechnic (currently West Pomeranian University of Technology) and his mother, Zofia, worked for the Polish Writers' Union. His early interest in astronomy was inspired by his father who told him stories and myths connected with stellar constellations. As a seven-year-old he already learned the basics of astronomy. He observed the night sky using a small telescope he constructed himself. He graduated from Stefan Czarniecki VI High School in Szczecin.  Scientific career  Aleksander Wolszczan Wolszczan sat for an M.Sc. in 1969 and a Ph.D. in 1975 at the Nicolaus Copernicus University in Toru≈Ñ, Poland. Between 1969-73 he worked at the Department of Radioastronomy of the Institute of Astronomy. In 1973, as a senior assistant, he moved to Bonn for training at the Max Planck Institute for Radio Astronomy. From 1979 to 1982 he worked at the Astronomical Center of the Polish Academy of Sciences in Toru≈Ñ, and in 1982 he moved to the United States to work at Cornell University and Princeton. Later he became an astronomy professor at Pennsylvania State University. From 1994 to 2008, he was also professor at the Nicolaus Copernicus University. He is a member of the Polish Academy of Sciences. Working with Dale Frail, Wolszczan carried out astronomical observations from the Arecibo Observatory in Puerto Rico that led them to the discovery of the pulsar PSR B1257+12 in 1990. In 1992 they showed that the pulsar was orbited by two planets, whose masses were initially assessed at 3.4 and 2.8 times Earth's mass. The radii of their orbits are 0.36 and 0.47 AU respectively. This was the first confirmed discovery of planets outside the Solar System (as of 6 October 2017, 3,529 such planets were known). Wolszczan announced his findings in 1992 during the Meeting of the American Astronomical Society in Atlanta. Two years later he published the results of his discovery and was chosen by the journal Nature as the author of one of 15 fundamental discoveries in the field of physics. Despite some initial misgivings by several experts, today his discovery is regarded as fully substantiated. Astronomer Bohdan Paczy≈Ñski called it \\"the greatest discovery by a Polish astronomer since Copernicus.\\" In 1998, Astronomy magazine included his discovery among The 25 Greatest Astronomical Findings of All Time. At the Arecibo Observatory, Wolszczan also collaborated with Joseph H. Taylor Jr and conducted research on millisecond pulsars. In 2003 Maciej Konacki and Wolszczan determined the orbital inclinations of the two pulsar planets, showing that the actual masses were approximately 3.9 and 4.3 Earth masses respectively. In 2007, Wolszczan was also part of a Polish team of astronomers led by Andrzej Niedzielski that found yet another planet outside the Solar System, HD 17092 b, orbiting star HD 17092. In 2012, Matthew Route and Wolszczan detected bursts of radio waves emitted from 2MASS J10475385+2124234 using Arecibo Observatory. This T6.5 brown dwarf has a temperature of 800-900 K, making it the coolest known radio-emitting substellar object. Its magnetic field is stronger than 1.7 kG. In 2016, the team discovered the most rapidly rotating brown dwarf, the T6 WISEPC J112254.73+255021.5. Its rotation period may be as little as 17 minutes. Wolszczan is a member of many scientific associations which include: the Polish Academy of Sciences, American Astronomical Society, American Association for the Advancement of Sciences, International Union of Radio Science, International Astronomical Union, and Polish Institute of Arts and Sciences of America.  Recognition  In 1992 Wolszczan won the Prize of the Foundation for Polish Science. In 1996, he was awarded the Beatrice M. Tinsley Prize by the American Astronomical Society, and in 1997 Polish President Aleksander Kwa≈õniewski presented him with the Commander's Cross of the Order of Polonia Restituta for outstanding contributions to Polish science. In 2002, he appeared on a Polish postage stamp (as part of a series of 16 stamps, titled \\"Polish Millennium,\\" which summarizes the last 1,000 years of history, culture, and science in Poland). In 2006, Wolszczan officially became an honorary citizen of Szczecin. In 2007, Jan Sosi≈Ñski directed a documentary film on the life and scientific work of Wolszczan entitled Gwiazdor - Aleksander Wolszczan. He was elected a Legacy Fellow of the American Astronomical Society in 2020.  Controversy  In 2008 Gazeta Prawna disclosed that from 1973 until 1988 Wolszczan was an informant (codenamed \\"Lange\\") for the Polish communist-era S≈Çu≈ºba Bezpiecze≈Ñstwa, which he confirmed, but stressed that he was passing only unimportant information, usually publicly known, and that he did not harm anybody. The resulting controversy in Polish media resulted in his resignation from Nicolaus Copernicus University in Toru≈Ñ. He continues teaching and researching at Penn State.

Fossil records show this canid first appeared during the middle Pleistocene, about 800,000 years ago. It is considered a basal canid species, resembling ancestral forms of the family, It has also been called a Sub-Saharan African version of a fennec fox due to their huge ears. The bat- eared fox (also referred to as Delalande's fox, long-eared fox, big-eared fox, and black-eared fox) has tawny fur with black ears, legs, and parts of the pointed face. It averages in length (head and body), with ears long. It is the only species in the genus Otocyon. The name Otocyon is derived from the Greek words otus for ear and cyon for dog, while the specific name megalotis comes from the Greek words mega for large and otus for ear.  Range and distribution  Two allopatric populations (subspecies) occur in Africa. O. m. virgatus occurs from Ethiopia and southern Sudan to Tanzania. The other population, O. m. megalotis, occurs in the southern part of Africa. It ranges from southern Zambia and Angola to South Africa, and extends as far east as Mozambique and Zimbabwe, spreading into the Cape Peninsula and toward Cape Agulhas. Home ranges vary in size from 0.3 to 3.5 km2.  Habitat  The bat- eared fox commonly inhabits short grasslands, as well as the more arid regions of the savanna. It prefers bare ground and areas where grass is kept short by grazing ungulates. It tends to hunt in these short grass and low shrub habitats. However, it does venture into areas with tall grasses and thick shrubs to hide when threatened. In addition to raising their young in dens, bat-eared foxes use self-dug dens for shelter from extreme temperatures and winds. They also lie under acacia trees in South Africa to seek shade during the day. Diet Skull of a bat eared fox The bat-eared fox is predominantly an insectivore that uses its large ears to locate its prey. About 80-90% of their diet is harvester termites (Hodotermes mossambicus). When this particular species of termite is not available, they feed on other species of termites and have also been observed consuming other arthropods such as ants, beetles, crickets, grasshoppers, millipedes, moths, scorpions, spiders, and rarely birds, small mammals, reptiles, and fungi (the desert truffle Kalaharituber pfeilii). The insects they eat fulfill the majority of their water intake needs. The bat-eared fox refuses to feed on snouted harvester termites, likely because it is not adapted to tolerate termites' chemical defense. =Dentition= The teeth of the bat-eared fox are much smaller and reduced in shearing surface formation than teeth of other canid species. This is an adaptation to its insectivorous diet. Due to its unusual teeth, the bat- eared fox was once considered as a distinct subfamily of canids (Otocyoninae). However, according to more recent examinations, it is more closely related to the true foxes of the genus Vulpes. Other research places the genus as an outgroup which is not very closely related to foxes. The bat-eared fox is an old species that was widely distributed in the Pleistocene era. The teeth are not the bat-eared fox's only morphological adaptation for its diet. The lower jaw has a step-like protrusion called the subangular process, which anchors the large muscle to allow for rapid chewing. The digastric muscle is also modified to open and close the jaw five times per second. =Foraging= Bat- eared foxes usually hunt in groups, mostly in pairs and groups of three. Individuals forage alone after family groups break in June or July and during the months after cub birth. Prey is located primarily by auditory means, rather than by smell or sight. Foraging patterns vary between seasons and coincide with termite availability. In the midsummer, individuals begin foraging at sunset, continuing throughout the night, and fading into the early morning. Foraging is almost exclusively diurnal during the winter it usually occurs in patches, which match the clumped prey resources, such as termite colonies, that also occur in patches. Groups are able to forage on clumps of prey in patches because they do not fight each other for food due to their degree of sociality and lack of territoriality. Behavior In the more northern areas of its range (around Serengeti), they are nocturnal 85% of the time. However, around South Africa, they are nocturnal only in the summer and diurnal during the winter. Bat-eared foxes are highly social animals. They often live in pairs or groups of up to 15 individuals, and home ranges of groups either overlap substantially or very little. Individuals forage, play, and rest together in a group, which helps in protection against predators. Social grooming occurs throughout the year, mostly between mature adults, but also between young adults and mature adults. Threat display of bat-eared fox Visual displays are very important in communication among bat-eared foxes. When they are looking intently at something, the head is held high, eyes are open, ears are erect and facing forward, and the mouth is closed. When an individual is in threat or showing submission, the ears are pulled back and lying against the head and the head is low. The tail also plays a role in communication. When an individual is asserting dominance or aggression, feeling threatened, playing, or being sexually aroused, the tail is arched in an inverted U shape. Individuals can also use piloerection, which occurs when individual hairs are standing straight, to make it appear larger when faced with extreme threat. When running, chasing, or fleeing, the tail is straight and horizontal. The bat-eared fox can recognize individuals up to 30 m away. The recognition process has three steps: First they ignore the individual, then they stare intently, and finally they either approach or attack without displays. When greeting another, the approaching individual shows symbolic submission which is received by the other individual with a high head and tail down. Few vocalizations are used for communication, but contact calls and warning calls are used, mostly during the winter. Glandular secretions and scratching, other than for digging, are absent in communication. Reproduction The bat-eared fox is predominantly socially monogamous, although it has been observed in polygynous groups. In contrast to other canids, the bat-eared fox has a reversal in parental roles, with the male taking on the majority of the parental care behavior. Gestation lasts for 60‚Äì70 days and females give birth to litters consisting of one to six kits. Beyond lactation, which lasts 14 to 15 weeks, males take over grooming, defending, huddling, chaperoning, and carrying the young between den sites. Additionally, male care and den attendance rates have been shown to have a direct correlation with cub survival rates. The female forages for food, which she uses to maintain milk production, on which the pups heavily depend. Food foraged by the female is not brought back to the pups or regurgitated to feed the pups. Pups in the Kalahari region are born September‚ÄìNovember and those in the Botswana region are born October‚ÄìDecember. Young bat-eared foxes disperse and leave their family groups at 5‚Äì6 months old and reach sexual maturity at 8‚Äì9 months. Conservation threats The bat-eared fox has some commercial use for humans. They are important for harvester termite population control, as the termites are considered pests. They have also been hunted for their fur by Botswana natives. Additional threats to populations include disease and drought that can harm populations of prey; however, no major threats to bat- eared fox populations exist.

It lies within the historic boundaries of Flintshire, on the north-east coast of Wales at the mouth of the River Clwyd (Welsh: Afon Clwyd). To the west is the suburb of Kinmel Bay and the resort of Towyn beyond, to the east Prestatyn, and to the south Rhuddlan. At the 2011 Census, Rhyl had a population of 25,149, with Rhyl-Kinmel Bay having 31,229. The Abergele‚ÄìRhyl‚ÄìPrestatyn conurbation numbers over 60,000. Once an elegant Victorian resort, an influx from Liverpool and Manchester after the Second World War changed the town's face. It had declined sharply by 1990, but has since been improved by major regeneration investments. Several million pounds of European Union funding secured by the Welsh Government has been spent on developing the seafront. Etymology Early documents refer to a dwelling in the area named Ty'n Rhyl, and a manor house with that name still exists in the town. However, the etymology of the word Rhyl has been the subject of debate for more than a century. Welsh orthography has proved difficult for English writers to translate, and Rhyl's opening voiceless alveolar trill is uncommon in the English language (represented in modern Welsh by the digraph 'Rh'). As such the name has appeared in English texts as Hulle (1292), Hul (1296), Ryhull (1301), Hyll (1506), Hull (1508), [Leidiart] yr Hyll (1597), Rhil (1706), Rh√ªl (1749), Rhul (1773) Rhyll (1830), and Rhyl (1840). One suggested hybrid etymology is the use of an unfamiliar English word (\\"hill\\") in Welsh syntax (Yr Hyl becoming Yr Rhyl). This etymology is considered unlikely as the town was situated on coastal marshland, with no hills in the vicinity. Similarly, it has been suggested that the name may derive from 'Yr Heol' (\\"The Road/Street\\"), but again, the road this would refer to is unknown and the sound change may be problematic. One popular theory suggests that the original dwelling of 'Ty'n Rhyl' derived its name from 'T≈∑'n yr haul' (House in the sun/House of Sunshine). This may be an example of common folk etymology, as Rhyl gained popularity as a summer destination for Welsh speaking tourists and was advertised in English and Welsh as Sunny Rhyl. Buildings, landmarks and attractions Rhyl clock tower and East Parade Rhyl has a number of Grade II listed buildings and landmarks. These include the Parish Church of St Thomas in Bath Street, which is listed as Grade II*. Others are the Midland Bank building, the railway station along with two signal boxes and the public telephone box on the up platform, the Royal Alexandra Hospital, the Sussex Street Baptist Church; the Town Hall; the Swan public house in Russell Road, the war memorial, and the Welsh Presbyterian Church in Clwyd Street. David Cox, Rhyl Sands (c.1854), depicting the Rhyl seafront Also notable is the Grade II listed Foryd Harbour Bridge, a blue bridge with distinctive bowstring girders built in 1932. Situated over the River Clwyd, it links Rhyl with Kinmel Bay. Another landmark is the Church of St Margaret of Antioch. The Marble Church was built by Lady Margaret in memory of her late husband, Sir Henry Peyto Willoughby de Broke. It was completed within four years and consecrated on 23 August 1860, becoming the parish church of a new parish of Bodelwyddan, covering an area formerly in that of St Asaph. The church opens daily from 9:30 to 16:30, except between 25 December and 6 January. A previous Rhyl landmark was the ornate Pavilion Theatre with five domes, which was demolished in 1974. Half a mile further down the promenade stood the pier, which was built in 1872, which was long and once included a pier railway. The structure was damaged by ships in 1883 and again in 1891. It was also damaged in 1901, when there was a fire. Storms were responsible for further damage in 1909 and it had to be closed in 1913 as unsafe. Though reopened with a much- reduced length in 1930, it closed again in 1966 and was demolished in 1972. Rhyl's top attractions on the West Parade are Rhyl Children's Village theme park, and the Sky Tower (formerly the Clydesdale Bank tower, brought to Rhyl from the 1988 Glasgow Garden Festival). The Sky Tower opened in 1989, but it was closed to the public in 2010 and transformed into an illuminated beacon in 2017. A VUE Cinema is also located there. On the East Parade is the SeaQuarium. Up until 2014, Rhyl Suncentre was also an attraction on the East Parade; an indoor water leisure centre which opened in 1980 at a cost of ¬£4.25 million and featured a heated swimming pool, water chutes and slides, and Europe's first indoor surfing pool. The local council closed the centre in early 2014 and it was demolished in 2016. A new Travelodge hotel was built next to the site, which opened in early 2019. A new indoor/outdoor water park, the SC2, opened further along the promenade in 2019, and includes various pools with water chutes and slides, as well as a separate \\"Ninja Tag\\" assault course game complex. Also on the East Parade is the New Pavilion Theatre, opened in 1991. It has over 1,000 seats and is managed by Denbighshire County Council. =Marine Lake= The Marine Lake, an artificial excavation in the west of the town, used to be a tourist destination, with fairground rides and a zoo. The lake is a 12-hectare man-made reservoir and it was officially opened in 1895. Rhyl Miniature Railway is the only original attraction remaining on the site, a narrow gauge railway that travels around the lake and is now based at the new museum and railway centre. There is also a playground and numerous watersports clubs based around the lake. Ocean Beach Funfair site (December 2007) The Marine Lake Funfair was demolished in the late 1960s, having been replaced by the nearby Ocean Beach Funfair. Ocean Beach finally closed on 2 September 2007 and was demolished to make way for a planned new development initially called Ocean Plaza. This was to include apartments, a hotel and various retail outlets. However, work on Ocean Plaza never went ahead as scheduled and the land lay vacant for several years after the original developers, Modus Properties, went bankrupt in 2009. The site was sold to a new company, Scarborough Development Group (SDG), in 2010, but again no work commenced on the site for several years. In 2014, SDG submitted revised plans to develop the land on a much smaller scale than the original plans. Now called Marina Quay, the plans no longer include the building of new apartments on the land as Natural Resources Wales' flood regulations now prohibit this. The plans were approved by the local authority in November 2014. In August 2015, The Range retail chain signed a 20-year lease and opened a new superstore on the site in March 2018. Aldi also opened a store on the site in 2019. Governance Electoral wards in and surrounding Rhyl (county=pink; town=grey) For elections to Denbighshire County Council, Rhyl divides into five electoral wards: Rhyl East, Rhyl South, Rhyl South East, Rhyl South West and Rhyl West. After the 2017 elections, all but two of the eleven councillors belonged to the Welsh Labour Party.Gareth Joy (5 May 2017) Election 2017: Denbighshire Council results, Point FM. Retrieved 30 March 2018. In 2008 Rhyl West appeared as the most deprived ward in Wales in the Welsh Index of Multiple Deprivation. The 22 councillors on Rhyl Town Council are divided among nine community wards: Brynhedydd and Plastirion (in Rhyl East); Cefndy, Derwen, Pendyffryn, Trellewellyn and Tynewydd (Rhyl South, South East and South West); Bodfor and Foryd (in Rhyl West).Councillors, Rhyl Town Council website. Retrieved 30 March 2018. Sport Association Football Rhyl F.C., commonly known as the Lilywhites, is a football club which historically played in English non-league football, but has competed since 1992 in the Welsh football pyramid. In the 2003‚Äì2004 season it won the Welsh Premier League, the Welsh Cup and the Welsh League Cup, and was losing finalist in the FAW Premier Cup. In the 2008‚Äì2009 season it again won the Welsh Premier League. On 17 May 2010, it was announced that Rhyl's Welsh Premier licence had been revoked. Its appeal was unsuccessful and they were relegated to the Cymru Alliance, returning to the Welsh Premier League in 2013 after winning the Cymru Alliance title, becoming the first club in the history of the competition to complete the season unbeaten. Rhyl has played in Europe on a few occasions. Rugby Union Rhyl and District RFC is the town's rugby union club, but had never had a playing base in the town until this year, when a new ground and clubhouse opened. Hockey Rhyl is home to the oldest field hockey club in Wales, formed in 1890. Its first international game was also played at Rhyl, between Ireland and Wales in 1895. Climate The climate is cool and temperate in Rhyl. The climate here is classified as Cfb by the K√∂ppen climate classification. The average temperature in Rhyl is . Annual precipitation averages . Transport Rhyl railway station on the North Wales Coast Line is served by through trains of Avanti West Coast between Holyhead and London Euston, and by Transport for Wales services: to Cardiff Central via Newport and Crewe, and to Manchester Piccadilly. Other stations nearby include Abergele & Pensarn, Prestatyn, Flint, Colwyn Bay and Llandudno Junction. The direct Transport for Wales and Avanti West Coast services to Holyhead give connections by Stena Line or Irish Ferries to Dublin Port. The A548 road through the town links with the A55 Holyhead to Chester road at Abergele. The A525 road runs south from the town to Rhuddlan, St Asaph and Ruthin. Several Arriva Buses Wales bus services are run along the main coast road between Chester and Holyhead, linking the resorts. Another route runs between Rhyl and Denbigh.

In 1902 the company commenced building light locomotives.

The agreement is believed to have ended in 1935 when LeTourneau‚Äôs moved to Peoria, Illinois. Davenport also sold Davenport-Winchell three-wheel roller conversions of industrial wheel tractors, Davenport-Frink snow plows which were built in license from Frink Sno-Plows Inc and Reynolds patented Mov-Mor rotary scrapers. In 1933 the company was again restructured and renamed the Davenport-Besler Corporation which continued in business until 1956. William George Besler was a Director at the time of the restructuring. The company acquired the locomotive business of H. K. Porter, Inc in 1950 and from then on produced Porter designs as well as its own. The company built small steam locomotives early on; the first gasoline-fueled internal combustion engined locomotive was built in 1924 and the first diesel locomotive in 1927, a diesel-electric for the Northern Illinois Coal Company of Boonville, Indiana. An extensive range of diesel locomotives in all industrial sizes followed, utilizing either mechanical torque converter or electric transmission, the former for the smaller locomotives. Most were used by a variety of industrial users, but some railroads also bought Davenport locomotives, particularly of the size, that being the largest locomotive then allowed by union rules to be operated by one man. Railroad buyers included the Rock Island, Milwaukee Road, Santa Fe, the Frisco, and the Missouri Pacific. In 1963, that rule was relaxed and railroads ceased buying industrial-sized locomotives for light switching. Davenport built a number of locomotives for the United States Army including World War I trench railways, the USATC S100 Class 0-6-0 of World War II, and eighteen larger switchers during the 1950s, two of which were adjustable in gauge‚Äîone could operate on broad gauges up to , and one on narrow gauges‚Äîthe latter operating for a period on the Denver & Rio Grande Western (). Various Davenport locomotives are preserved in the US as well as other parts of the world. The Canadian Locomotive Company acquired Davenport-Besler in 1955, closing it the following year.

It flows due south until, at Melin-y- Wig, it veers north-eastwards, tracking the A494 and passing through Derwen, Llanelidan, Pwllglas and Llanfair Dyffryn Clwyd to Ruthin. Here it leaves the relatively narrow valley and enters a broad agricultural vale, the Vale of Clwyd (Welsh: Dyffryn Clwyd). Just south of Denbigh, it is joined by the River Clywedog. This substantial tributary also has its source in the Clocaenog Forest but drains out to the east and north of the forest and passes through Cyffylliog, Bontuchel and Rhewl before its confluence with the main river. Then the Clwyd meanders northwards through the fertile Clwyd valley to St Asaph. Two miles north of St Asaph, the river is joined by a tributary as large as the main river, the River Elwy. In normal flows at low tide, the waters of these two rivers can be seen flowing side by side down the river with little mixing. The River Elwy has its source a long way to the west on the flanks of Moel Seisiog south-east of Llanrwst. It also has a tributary the River Aled with its source in the upland lake Llyn Aled. The Elwy flows principally eastwards to join the Clwyd passing through few villages. At the confluence of the Elwy and the Clwyd, the river becomes tidal and enters a narrow estuary with much wildlife before meeting the Irish Sea at Rhyl. In 1277, King Edward I sited a castle next to the Clwyd at Rhuddlan. In order for his supply barges to reach the castle, he employed 968 men to work on what was called 'The Great Ditch'. He straightened the stretch of river that ran from the castle to the sea. This was an enormous feat of engineering, compared even to today's modern standards, and it is still possible to make out the original loops and turns of the Clwyd using satellite imagery. The former county of Clwyd, consisting of the principal areas of modern-day Conwy, Denbighshire, Flintshire and Wrexham, was named after the river, when it was created as a two-tier county in 1974. The River Clwyd is known for an excellent run of sea trout (sewin), as well as Atlantic Salmon. In recent years including the recent 2017 season there have been good reported catches of wild brown trout most of which are returned unharmed on a voluntary catch and release system.

Initially achieving fame in the comedy Genevieve (1953), he appeared in many roles as a carefree, happy-go-lucky gent. Films from this period include Doctor in the House (1954), Raising a Riot (1955), The Admirable Crichton (1957), The Sheriff of Fractured Jaw (1958) and Next to No Time (1958). He also played more serious roles as a leading man, beginning with The Deep Blue Sea (1955), Reach for the Sky (1956), A Night to Remember (1958), North West Frontier (1959), The 39 Steps (1959) and Sink the Bismarck (1960). Although his career declined in the early 1960s, two of his own favourite films date from this time ‚Äì The Comedy Man (1964) and The Greengage Summer (1961) with Susannah York, \\"one of the happiest films on which I have ever worked.\\"Kenneth More (1978) More or Less, Hodder & Stoughton. He also enjoyed a revival in the much-acclaimed TV adaptation of The Forsyte Saga (1967) and the Father Brown series (1974).  Early life  Kenneth More was born in Gerrards Cross, Buckinghamshire, the only son of Charles Gilbert More, a Royal Naval Air Service pilot, and Edith Winifred Watkins, the daughter of a Cardiff solicitor. He was educated at Victoria College, Jersey, having spent part of his childhood in the Channel Islands, where his father was general manager of the Jersey Eastern Railway. After he left school, he followed the family tradition by training as a civil engineer. He gave up his training and worked for a while in Sainsbury's on the Strand. When More was 17 his father died, and he applied to join the Royal Air Force, but failed the medical test for equilibrium. He then travelled to Canada, intending to work as a fur trapper, but was sent back because he lacked immigration papers. = Windmill Theatre = On his return from Canada, a business associate of his father, Vivian Van Damm, agreed to offer him work as a stagehand at the Windmill Theatre, where his job included shifting scenery, and helping to get the nude players off stage during its Revudeville variety shows. After a chance moment on stage helping out a comic, he realised he wanted to become an actor and was soon promoted to playing straight man in the Revudeville comedy routines, appearing in his first sketch in August 1935. He played there for a year, which then led to regular work in repertory, including Newcastle, performing in plays such as Burke and Hare and Dracula's Daughter. Other stage appearances included Do You Remember? (1937), Stage Hands Never Lie (1937) and Distinguished Gathering (1937). More continued his theatre work until the outbreak of the Second World War in 1939. He had the occasional bit part in films such as Look Up and Laugh (1935). = Second World War = HMS Victorious, on which More saw service during the Second World War More received a commission as a lieutenant in the Royal Navy, and saw active service aboard the cruiser and the aircraft carrier . = Resumption of acting career = On demobilisation in 1946 he worked for the Wolverhampton repertory company, then appeared on stage in the West End in And No Birds Sing (1946). More played Badger in a TV adaptation of Toad of Toad Hall (1946) and a bit part in the film School for Secrets (1946). He was seen by No√´l Coward playing a small role on stage in Power Without Glory (1947), which led to his being cast in Coward's Peace In Our Time (1948) on stage.\\"Popular new star\\" The Australian Women's Weekly (via National Library of Australia), 1 June 1955, p. 44. Retrieved: 6 May 2012. More's earliest bit parts in films date from before the war, but around this time, he began to appear regularly on the big screen. For a small role in Scott of the Antarctic (1948) as Edward Evans, 1st Baron Mountevans, he was paid ‚Ç§500. He had minor parts in Man on the Run (1949), Now Barabbas (1949), and Stop Press Girl (1949). Stardom = Rising reputation = More achieved a notable stage success in The Way Things Go (1950) with Ronald Squire, from whom More later claimed he learned his stage technique.Shipman 1972, p. 371. He was in demand for minor roles on screen such as Morning Departure (1950) and Chance of a Lifetime (1950). More had a good part as a British agent in The Clouded Yellow (1950) for Ralph Thomas. He could also be seen in The Franchise Affair (1951) and The Galloping Major (1951). More's first Hollywood-financed film was No Highway in the Sky (1951) where he played a co-pilot. Thomas cast him in another strong support part in Appointment with Venus (1952). More achieved above the title billing for the first time with a low budget comedy, Brandy for the Parson (1952), playing a smuggler. = The Deep Blue Sea = Roland Culver recommended More audition for a part in a new play by Terence Rattigan, The Deep Blue Sea (1952); he was successful and achieved tremendous critical acclaim in the role of Freddie. During the play's run he appeared as a worried parent in a thriller, The Yellow Balloon (1953). He was in another Hollywood-financed film, Never Let Me Go (1953), playing a colleague of Clark Gable. = Film stardom: Genevieve and Doctor in the House = Director Henry Cornelius approached More during the run of The Deep Blue Sea and offered him ¬£3,500 to play one of the four leads in a comedy, Genevieve (1953) (a part turned down by Guy Middleton). More said Cornelius never saw him in the play but cast him on the basis of his work in The Galloping Major.More 1978, p. 157.Thompson, Harold. \\"From the 'Windmill' to the 'Sea'.\\" The New York Times, 29 May 1955, p. 53. More recalls \\"the shooting of the picture was hell. Everything went wrong, even the weather.\\" The resulting film was a huge success at the British box office. More next made Our Girl Friday (1953) and Doctor in the House (1954), the latter for Ralph Thomas. Both films were made before the release of Genevieve so More's fee was relatively small; Our Girl Friday was a commercial disappointment but Doctor in the House was the biggest hit at the 1954 British box office and the most successful film in the history of Rank. More received a BAFTA Award as best newcomer. More appeared in a TV production of The Deep Blue Sea in 1954, which was seen by an audience of 11 million. More signed a five-year contract with Sir Alexander Korda at ¬£10,000 a year. ' He was now established as one of Britain's biggest stars and Korda announced plans to feature him in two films based on true stories, one about the Transatlantic flight of Alcock and Brown in 1919 also featuring Denholm Elliott, and the other Clifton James, the double for Field Marshal Montgomery.\\"Herald features.\\" The Sydney Morning Herald (via National Library of Australia), 9 September 1954, p. 11. Retrieved: 6 May 2012. The first film was never made and the second (I Was Monty's Double) with another actor. Korda also wanted More to star in a new version of The Four Feathers, Storm Over the Nile (1956) but he turned it down. However More did accept Korda's offer to appear in a film adaptation of The Deep Blue Sea (1955) gaining the Best Actor at the Venice Film Festival for his performance. The film was something of a critical and commercial disappointment (More felt Vivien Leigh was miscast in the lead) but still widely seen. He also did the narration for Korda's The Man Who Loved Redheads (1955). More starred in a comedy, Raising a Riot (1955), which was the eighth most popular movie at the British box office in 1955. = Reach for the Sky = He received an offer from David Lean to play the lead role in an adaptation of The Wind Cannot Read by Richard Mason. More was unsure about whether the public would accept him in the part and turned it down, a decision he later regarded as \\"the greatest mistake I ever made professionally\\".More 1978, p. 228. (Lean dropped the project and was not involved in the eventual 1958 film version which starred Dirk Bogarde and which was directed by Ralph Thomas). Instead, More played the Royal Air Force fighter ace, Douglas Bader, in Reach for the Sky (1956), a part turned down by Richard Burton. It was the most popular British film of the year. By 1956, More's asking price was ¬£25,000 a film.\\"Star Dust.\\" The Mirror (Perth, WA) (via National Library of Australia), 11 February 1956, p. 11. Retrieved: 6 May 2012. More received offers to go to Hollywood, but turned them down, unsure his persona would be effective there. However, he started working with American co-stars and directors more often. In February 1957, he signed a contract with Daniel M. Angel and was to make ten films over five years, seven which would be distributed by Rank and three by 20th Century Fox. In June of that year, he said: > Hollywood has been hitting two extremes ‚Äì either a Biblical de Mille > spectacular or a Baby Doll. Britain does two other kinds of movie as well as > anyone ‚Äì a certain type of high comedy and a kind of semi-documentary. I > believe we (the British film industry) should hit these hard. His next film, The Admirable Crichton (1957), was a high comedy, based on the play by J. M. Barrie. It was released by Columbia Pictures. It was directed by Lewis Gilbert who also had made Reach for the Sky and who later said: > I was very fond of Kenny as an actor, although he wasn't particularly > versatile. What he could do, he did very well. His strengths were his > ability to portray charm; basically he was the officer returning from the > war and he was superb in that kind of role. The minute that kind of role > went out of existence, he began to go down as a box office star.\\"MacFarlane > 1997, p. 222. Regarding his performance in this film, critic David Shipman wrote: > It was not just that he had superb comic timing: one could see absolutely > why the family trusted their fates to him. No other British actor had come > so close to that dependable, reliable quality of the great Hollywood stars ‚Äì > you would trust him through thick and thin. And he was more humorous than, > say, Gary Cooper, more down-to-earth than, say, Cary Grant.Shipman 1989, pp. > 414‚Äì415. The Admirable Crichton was the third most popular movie at the British box office in 1957. In 1957, More had announced that he would play the lead role of a captain caught up in the Indian Mutiny in Night Runners of Bengal but the film was never made. More turned down an offer from Roy Ward Baker to play a German POW in The One That Got Away (1957), but agreed to play the lead part of Charles Lightoller in the Titanic film for the same director, A Night to Remember (1958). This was the first of a seven-year contract with Rank at a fee of ¬£40,000 a film. It was popular though failed to recoup its large cost; it was one of More's most critically acclaimed films. For his next film, More had an American co-star Betsy Drake, Next to No Time (1958) directed by Cornelius. It was a minor success at the box office. More then made a series of films for Rank that were distributed in the US by 20th Century Fox. The first was The Sheriff of Fractured Jaw (1958), a Western spoof originally written for Clifton Webb. He had an American director (Raoul Walsh) and co- star (Jayne Mansfield), although the film was shot in Spain. It was the tenth most-popular movie at the British box office in 1958. He followed it for another with Ralph Thomas, a remake of The 39 Steps (1959), with a Hollywood co star (Taina Elg). It was a hit in Britain. The third Fox-Rank film was an Imperial adventure set in India, North West Frontier (1959), co-starring Lauren Bacall and directed by J. Lee Thompson. It was another success in Britain but not in the US. However Sink the Bismarck! (1960), directed by Gilbert, was a hit in Britain and the US. More was the subject of This Is Your Life in 1959 when he was surprised by Eamonn Andrews at the Odeon Cinema, Shepherd's Bush. Later career = Decline in film popularity = In 1960, Rank's Managing Director John Davis gave permission for More to work outside his contract to appear in The Guns of Navarone (1961). More, however, made the mistake of heckling and swearing at Davis at a BAFTA dinner at the Dorchester, losing both the role (which went to David Niven) and his contract with Rank. More went on to make a comedy, 'Man In The Moon' (1960), which flopped at the box office, \\"his first real flop\\" since becoming a star, according to Shipman. He returned to the stage directing The Angry Deep in Brighton in 1960. More and Gilbert were reunited on The Greengage Summer (1961) which remains one of More's favourite films, although Gilbert felt the star was miscast. More says he accepted the lead in the low-budget youth film, Some People (1962), because he had no other offers at the time. The movie was profitable. He was one of many stars in The Longest Day (1962) and played the lead in a comedy We Joined the Navy (1962), which was poorly received. More tried to change his image with The Comedy Man (1963) which the public did not like, although it became his favourite role. Some felt More's popularity declined when he left his second wife to live with Angela Douglas.\\"An interview with Peter Yeldham.\\" Memorable TV. Retrieved: 12 June 2012.

Critic David Shipman said More's personal notices for his performance on stage in The Secretary Bird (1968) \\"must be among the best accorded any light comedian during this century\\". On screen More had a small role in Dark of the Sun (1968) and a bigger one in Fr√§ulein Doktor (1969). He was one of many names in Oh! What a Lovely War (1969) and Battle of Britain (1969). He took the role of the Ghost of Christmas Present in Scrooge (1970) and had long stage runs with a revival of The Winslow Boy (1970) and Getting On by Alan Bennett (1971). He was appointed a Commander of the Order of the British Empire (CBE) in the 1970 New Year Honours. = Later career = More's later stage appearances included Signs of the Times (1973) and On Approval (1977). He played the title character in ATV's Father Brown (1974) series. His later film roles included The Slipper and the Rose (1976), Where Time Began (1978), Leopard in the Snow (1978), An Englishman's Castle (1978) and Unidentified Flying Oddball (1979).  Personal life  More was married three times. His first marriage in 1940 to actress Mary Beryl Johnstone (one daughter, Susan Jane, born 1941) ended in divorce in 1946. He married Mabel Edith \\"Bill\\" Barkby in 1952 (one daughter, Sarah, born 1954) but left her in 1968 for Angela Douglas, an actress 26 years his junior, causing considerable estrangement from friends and family. He was married to Douglas (whom he nicknamed \\"Shrimp\\") from 17 March 1968 until his death. More wrote two autobiographies, Happy Go Lucky (1959) and More or Less (1978). In the second book he related how he had since childhood, a recurrent dream of something akin to a huge wasp descending towards him. During the war he had experienced a German Stuka dive-bomber descending in just such a manner. After that he claimed never to have had that dream again. Producer Daniel M. Angel successfully sued More for libel in 1980 over comments made in his second autobiography.\\"Why I'm living on Love.\\" The Australian Women's Weekly (via National Library of Australia), 7 October 1981, p. 26. Retrieved: 6 May 2012. = Illness and death = More and Douglas separated for several years during the 1970s but reunited when he was diagnosed with Parkinson's Disease. This made it increasingly difficult for him to work, although his last role was a sizeable supporting part in a US TV adaptation of A Tale of Two Cities (1980). In 1980, when he was being sued by producer Danny Angel for comments in his memoirs, he told the court he was retired. In 1981 he wrote: > Doctors and friends ask me how I feel.

More died on 12 July 1982, aged 67. It is now believed that he had been suffering from multiple system atrophy (MSA), due in part to the age of onset and the speed at which the condition progressed.Kenneth More Charity page at official website. His body was cremated at Putney Vale Crematorium and a plaque erected at the actor's church St Paul's, Covent Garden, following a memorial attended by family, friends and colleagues.  Legacy  The Kenneth More Theatre, named in his honour, is in Ilford, east London. A plaque commemorates More at 27 Rumbold Road, Fulham, his home at the time of his death. An official website was launched in 2018 to coincide with the birth of the late actor, by entertainment publicist and writer Nick Pourgourides, who now manages Kenneth More's estate on behalf of wife Angela Douglas and More's children, Jane and Sarah. The objective was to reinvigorate the late actor's name and image, which had fallen into obscurity since More's death in 1982. The main priority of the estate is in re-educating the public of the important part Kenneth More played in the British entertainment industry from the 1950s through to the 1970s. In 2019, in collaboration with Talking Pictures TV, the Kenneth More estate helped to create and promote the first Kenneth More Day, marking the late actor's passing on 12 July. A national and regional media campaign was also undertaken to help promote the life of the late actor. The Kenneth More estate also helped to organise a memorial plaque at the Duchess Theatre in London's West End, which was unveiled in 2019. The theatre was the site of More's acclaimed performance as Freddie Page in a production of Terence Rattigan's The Deep Blue Sea. In 2019, the rights to More's final autobiography, More or Less, reverted to the late actor's estate. More Please, the first authorised book on Kenneth More, is due for publication in 2020. The book is written by Nick Pourgourides, who manages Kenneth More's estate. The book will include contributions from his family and those who worked with the late actor, as well as exclusive excerpts from More's final autobiography, More or Less. Future plans by the Kenneth More estate include a retrospective and exhibition of More's awards, film-related material and personal papers, which are contained in the late actor's archive held by Nick Pourgourides.

An active film-maker from 1970, Kiarostami had been involved in the production of over forty films, including shorts and documentaries. Kiarostami attained critical acclaim for directing the Koker trilogy (1987‚Äì1994), Close-Up (1990), The Wind Will Carry Us (1999), and Taste of Cherry (1997), which was awarded the Palme d'Or at the Cannes Film Festival that year. In later works, Certified Copy (2010) and Like Someone in Love (2012), he filmed for the first time outside Iran: in Italy and Japan, respectively. His films Where Is the Friend‚Äôs Home?, Close-Up, and The Wind Will Carry Us were ranked among the 100 best foreign films in a 2018 critics' poll by BBC Culture. Close-Up was also ranked one of the 50 greatest movies of all time in the famous decennial Sight & Sound poll conducted in 2012. Kiarostami had worked extensively as a screenwriter, film editor, art director and producer and had designed credit titles and publicity material. He was also a poet, photographer, painter, illustrator, and graphic designer. He was part of a generation of filmmakers in the Iranian New Wave, a Persian cinema movement that started in the late 1960s and includes pioneering directors such as Bahram Beyzai, Nasser Taghvai, Ali Hatami, Masoud Kimiai, Dariush Mehrjui, Sohrab Shahid-Saless and Parviz Kimiavi. These filmmakers share many common techniques including the use of poetic dialogue and allegorical storytelling dealing with political and philosophical issues. Kiarostami had a reputation for using child protagonists, for documentary- style narrative films, for stories that take place in rural villages, and for conversations that unfold inside cars, using stationary mounted cameras. He is also known for his use of Persian poetry in the dialogue, titles, and themes of his films. Kiarostami's films contain a notable degree of ambiguity, an unusual mixture of simplicity and complexity, and often a mix of fictional and documentary elements. The concepts of change and continuity, in addition to the themes of life and death, play a major role in Kiarostami's works. Early life and background Kiarostami majored in painting and graphic design at the University of Tehran College of Fine arts. Kiarostami was born in Tehran. His first artistic experience was painting, which he continued into his late teens, winning a painting competition at the age of 18 shortly before he left home to study at the University of Tehran School of Fine Arts. He majored in painting and graphic design, and supported his studies by working as a traffic policeman. As a painter, designer, and illustrator, Kiarostami worked in advertising in the 1960s, designing posters and creating commercials. Between 1962 and 1966, he shot around 150 advertisements for Iranian television. In the late 1960s, he began creating credit titles for films (including Gheysar by Masoud Kimiai) and illustrating children's books. Film career =1970s= In 1970 when the Iranian New Wave began with Dariush Mehrjui's film GƒÅv, Kiarostami helped set up a filmmaking department at the Institute for Intellectual Development of Children and Young Adults (Kanun) in Tehran. Its debut production, and Kiarostami's first film, was the twelve-minute The Bread and Alley (1970), a neo-realistic short film about a schoolboy's confrontation with an aggressive dog. Breaktime followed in 1972. The department became one of Iran's most noted film studios, producing not only Kiarostami's films, but acclaimed Persian films such as The Runner and Bashu, the Little Stranger. In the 1970s, Kiarostami pursued an individualistic style of film making. When discussing his first film, he stated: > Bread and Alley was my first experience in cinema and I must say a very > difficult one. I had to work with a very young child, a dog, and an > unprofessional crew except for the cinematographer, who was nagging and > complaining all the time. Well, the cinematographer, in a sense, was right > because I did not follow the conventions of film making that he had become > accustomed to. Following The Experience (1973), Kiarostami released The Traveler (Mossafer) in 1974. The Traveler tells the story of Qassem Julayi, a troubled and troublesome boy from a small Iranian city. Intent on attending a football match in far-off Tehran, he scams his friends and neighbors to raise money, and journeys to the stadium in time for the game, only to meet with an ironic twist of fate. In addressing the boy's determination to reach his goal, alongside his indifference to the effects of his amoral actions, the film examined human behavior and the balance of right and wrong. It furthered Kiarostami's reputation for realism, diegetic simplicity, and stylistic complexity, as well as his fascination with physical and spiritual journeys. In 1975, Kiarostami directed two short films So Can I and Two Solutions for One Problem. In early 1976, he released Colors, followed by the fifty-four- minute film A Wedding Suit, a story about three teenagers coming into conflict over a suit for a wedding. Kiarostami in 1977 Kiarostami's first feature film was the 112-minute Report (1977). It revolved around the life of a tax collector accused of accepting bribes; suicide was among its themes. In 1979, he produced and directed First Case, Second Case. =1980s= In the early 1980s, Kiarostami directed several short films including Toothache (1980), Orderly or Disorderly (1981), and The Chorus (1982). In 1983, he directed Fellow Citizen. It was not until his release of Where Is the Friend's Home? that he began to gain recognition outside Iran.These films created the basis of his later productions. The film tells a simple account of a conscientious eight-year-old schoolboy's quest to return his friend's notebook in a neighboring village lest his friend be expelled from school. The traditional beliefs of Iranian rural people are portrayed. The film has been noted for its poetic use of the Iranian rural landscape and its realism, both important elements of Kiarostami's work. Kiarostami made the film from a child's point of view. Where Is the Friend's Home?, And Life Goes On (1992) (also known as Life and Nothing More), and Through the Olive Trees (1994) are described by critics as the Koker trilogy, because all three films feature the village of Koker in northern Iran. The films also relate to the 1990 Manjil‚ÄìRudbar earthquake, in which 40,000 people died. Kiarostami uses the themes of life, death, change, and continuity to connect the films. The trilogy was successful in France in the 1990s and other Western European countries such as the Netherlands, Sweden, Germany and Finland. But, Kiarostami did not consider the three films to comprise a trilogy. He suggested that the last two titles plus Taste of Cherry (1997) comprise a trilogy, given their common theme of the preciousness of life. In 1987, Kiarostami was involved in the screenwriting of The Key, which he edited but did not direct. In 1989, he released Homework. =1990s= Kiarostami directing a film Kiarostami's first film of the decade was Close-Up (1990), which narrates the story of the real-life trial of a man who impersonated film-maker Mohsen Makhmalbaf, conning a family into believing they would star in his new film. The family suspects theft as the motive for this charade, but the impersonator, Hossein Sabzian, argues that his motives were more complex. The part-documentary, part-staged film examines Sabzian's moral justification for usurping Makhmalbaf's identity, questioning his ability to sense his cultural and artistic flair. Ranked No. 42 in British Film Institute's The Top 50 Greatest Films of All Time, Close-Up received praise from directors such as Quentin Tarantino, Martin Scorsese, Werner Herzog, Jean-Luc Godard, and Nanni Moretti and was released across Europe. In 1992, Kiarostami directed Life, and Nothing More..., regarded by critics as the second film of the Koker trilogy. The film follows a father and his young son as they drive from Tehran to Koker in search of two young boys who they fear might have perished in the 1990 earthquake. As the father and son travel through the devastated landscape, they meet earthquake survivors forced to carry on with their lives amid disaster. That year Kiarostami won a Prix Roberto Rossellini, the first professional film award of his career, for his direction of the film. The last film of the so-called Koker trilogy was Through the Olive Trees (1994), which expands a peripheral scene from Life and Nothing More into the central drama. Critics such as Adrian Martin have called the style of filmmaking in the Koker trilogy as \\"diagrammatical\\", linking the zig-zagging patterns in the landscape and the geometry of forces of life and the world. A flashback of the zigzag path in Life and Nothing More... (1992) in turn triggers the spectator's memory of the previous film, Where Is the Friend's Home? from 1987, shot before the earthquake. This symbolically links to the post-earthquake reconstruction in Through the Olive Trees in 1994. In 1995, Miramax Films released Through the Olive Trees in the US theaters. Kiarostami next wrote the screenplays for The Journey and The White Balloon (1995), for his former assistant Jafar Panahi. Between 1995 and 1996, he was involved in the production of Lumi√®re and Company, a collaboration with 40 other film directors. Kiarostami won the Palme d'Or (Golden Palm) award at the Cannes Film Festival for Taste of Cherry. It is the drama of a man, Mr. Badii, determined to commit suicide. The film involved themes such as morality, the legitimacy of the act of suicide, and the meaning of compassion. Kiarostami directed The Wind Will Carry Us in 1999, which won the Grand Jury Prize (Silver Lion) at the Venice International Film Festival. The film contrasted rural and urban views on the dignity of labor, addressing themes of gender equality and the benefits of progress, by means of a stranger's sojourn in a remote Kurdish village. An unusual feature of the movie is that many of the characters are heard but not seen; at least thirteen to fourteen speaking characters in the film are never seen. =2000s= In 2000, at the San Francisco Film Festival award ceremony, Kiarostami was awarded the Akira Kurosawa Prize for lifetime achievement in directing, but surprised everyone by giving it away to veteran Iranian actor Behrooz Vossoughi for his contribution to Iranian cinema. In 2001, Kiarostami and his assistant, Seifollah Samadian, traveled to Kampala, Uganda at the request of the United Nations International Fund for Agricultural Development, to film a documentary about programs assisting Ugandan orphans. He stayed for ten days and made ABC Africa. The trip was originally intended as a research in preparation for the filming, but Kiarostami ended up editing the entire film from the video footage shot there.Geoff Andrew, Ten (London: BFI Publishing, 2005), p. 35. The high number of orphans in Uganda has resulted from the deaths of parents in the AIDS epidemic. Time Out editor and National Film Theatre chief programmer, Geoff Andrew, said in referring to the film: \\"Like his previous four features, this film is not about death but life-and-death: how they're linked, and what attitude we might adopt with regard to their symbiotic inevitability.\\"Geoff Andrew, Ten, (London: BFI Publishing, 2005) p. 32. The following year, Kiarostami directed Ten, revealing an unusual method of filmmaking and abandoning many scriptwriting conventions. Kiarostami focused on the socio-political landscape of Iran. The images are seen through the eyes of one woman as she drives through the streets of Tehran over a period of several days. Her journey is composed of ten conversations with various passengers, which include her sister, a hitchhiking prostitute, and a jilted bride and her demanding young son. This style of filmmaking was praised by a number of critics. A. O. Scott in The New York Times wrote that Kiarostami, \\"in addition to being perhaps the most internationally admired Iranian filmmaker of the past decade, is also among the world masters of automotive cinema...He understands the automobile as a place of reflection, observation and, above all, talk.\\" In 2003, Kiarostami directed Five, a poetic feature with no dialogue or characterization. It consists of five long shots of nature which are single-take sequences, shot with a hand-held DV camera, along the shores of the Caspian Sea. Although the film lacks a clear storyline, Geoff Andrew argues that the film is \\"more than just pretty pictures\\". He adds, \\"Assembled in order, they comprise a kind of abstract or emotional narrative arc, which moves evocatively from separation and solitude to community, from motion to rest, near-silence to sound and song, light to darkness and back to light again, ending on a note of rebirth and regeneration.\\"He notes the degree of artifice concealed behind the apparent simplicity of the imagery.Geoff Andrew, Ten, (London: BFI Publishing, 2005) pp 73‚Äì4. Kiarostami produced 10 on Ten (2004), a journal documentary that shares ten lessons on movie-making while he drives through the locations of his past films. The movie is shot on digital video with a stationary camera mounted inside the car, in a manner reminiscent of Taste of Cherry and Ten. In 2005 and 2006, he directed The Roads of Kiarostami, a 32-minute documentary that reflects on the power of landscape, combining austere black-and-white photographs with poetic observations, engaging music with political subject matter. Also in 2005, Kiarostami contributed the central section to Tickets, a portmanteau film set on a train traveling through Italy. The other segments were directed by Ken Loach and Ermanno Olmi. In 2008, Kiarostami directed the feature Shirin, which features close-ups of many notable Iranian actresses and the French actress Juliette Binoche as they watch a film based on a partly mythological Persian romance tale of Khosrow and Shirin, with themes of female self-sacrifice. The film has been described as \\"a compelling exploration of the relationship between image, sound and female spectatorship.\\" That summer, he directed Wolfgang Amadeus Mozart's opera Cos√¨ fan tutte conducted by Christophe Rousset at Festival d'Aix-en-Provence starring with William Shimell. But the following year's performances at the English National Opera was impossible to direct because of refusal of permission to travel abroad. =2010s= Kiarostami in 2015 Certified Copy (2010), again starring Juliette Binoche, was made in Tuscany and was Kiarostami's first film to be shot and produced outside Iran. The story of an encounter between a British man and a French woman, it was entered in competition for the Palme d'Or in the 2010 Cannes Film Festival. Peter Bradshaw of The Guardian describes the film as an \\"intriguing oddity\\", and said, \\"Certified Copy is the deconstructed portrait of a marriage, acted with well-intentioned fervour by Juliette Binoche, but persistently baffling, contrived, and often simply bizarre ‚Äì a highbrow misfire of the most peculiar sort.\\" He concluded that the film is \\"unmistakably an example of Kiarostami's compositional technique, though not a successful example.\\" Roger Ebert, however, praised the film, noting that \\"Kiarostami is rather brilliant in the way he creates offscreen spaces.\\" Binoche won the Best Actress Award at Cannes for her performance in the film. Kiarostami's penultimate film, Like Someone in Love, set and shot in Japan, received largely positive reviews from critics. Kiarostami's final film 24 Frames was released posthumously in 2017. An experimental film based on 24 of Kiarostami's still photographs, 24 Frames enjoyed a highly positive critical reception, with a Rotten Tomatoes score of 92%. =Film festival work= Kiarostami was a jury member at numerous film festivals, most notably the Cannes Film Festival in 1993, 2002 and 2005. He was also the president of the Cam√©ra d'Or Jury in Cannes Film Festival 2005. He was announced as the president of the Cin√©fondation and short film sections of the 2014 Cannes Film Festival. Other representatives include the Venice Film Festival in 1985, the Locarno International Film Festival in 1990, the San Sebastian International Film Festival in 1996, the S√£o Paulo International Film Festival in 2004, the Capalbio Cinema Festival in 2007 (in which he was president of the jury), and the K√ºstendorf Film and Music Festival in 2011. He also made regular appearances at many other film festivals across Europe, including the Estoril Film Festival in Portugal. Cinematic style =Individualism= Though Kiarostami has been compared to Satyajit Ray, Vittorio De Sica, √âric Rohmer, and Jacques Tati, his films exhibit a singular style, often employing techniques of his own invention. During the filming of The Bread and Alley in 1970, Kiarostami had major differences with his experienced cinematographer about how to film the boy and the attacking dog. While the cinematographer wanted separate shots of the boy approaching, a close-up of his hand as he enters the house and closes the door, followed by a shot of the dog, Kiarostami believed that if the three scenes could be captured as a whole it would have a more profound impact in creating tension over the situation. That one shot took around forty days to complete, until Kiarostami was fully content with the scene. Kiarostami later commented that the breaking of scenes would have disrupted the rhythm and content of the film's structure, preferring to let the scene flow as one. Unlike other directors, Kiarostami showed no interest in staging extravagant combat scenes or complicated chase scenes in large-scale productions, instead attempting to mold the medium of film to his own specifications. Kiarostami appeared to have settled on his style with the Koker trilogy, which included a myriad of references to his own film material, connecting common themes and subject matter between each of the films. Stephen Bransford has contended that Kiarostami's films do not contain references to the work of other directors, but are fashioned in such a manner that they are self-referenced. Bransford believes his films are often fashioned into an ongoing dialectic with one film reflecting on and partially demystifying an earlier film. He continued experimenting with new modes of filming, using different directorial methods and techniques. A case in point is Ten, which was filmed in a moving automobile in which Kiarostami was not present. He gave suggestions to the actors about what to do, and a camera placed on the dashboard filmed them while they drove around Tehran. The camera was allowed to roll, capturing the faces of the people involved during their daily routine, using a series of extreme-close shots. Ten was an experiment that used digital cameras to virtually eliminate the director. This new direction towards a digital micro- cinema is defined as a micro-budget filmmaking practice, allied with a digital production basis.Ganz, A. & Khatib, L. (2006) \\"Digital Cinema: The transformation of film practice and aesthetics,\\" in New Cinemas, vol. 4 no 1, pp 21‚Äì36 Kiarostami's cinema offers a different definition of film. According to film professors such as Jamsheed Akrami of William Paterson University, Kiarostami consistently tried to redefine film by forcing the increased involvement of the audience. In his later years, he also progressively trimmed the timespan within his films. Akrami thinks that this reduces the filmmaking from a collective endeavor to a purer, more basic form of artistic expression. =Fiction and non-fiction= Kiarostami interviewing with in 2013 Kiarostami's films contain a notable degree of ambiguity, an unusual mixture of simplicity and complexity, and often a mix of fictional and documentary elements (docufiction). Kiarostami has stated, \\"We can never get close to the truth except through lying.\\" The boundary between fiction and non-fiction is significantly reduced in Kiarostami's cinema. The French philosopher Jean-Luc Nancy, writing about Kiarostami, and in particular Life and Nothing More..., has argued that his films are neither quite fiction nor quite documentary. Life and Nothing More..., he argues, is neither representation nor reportage, but rather \\"evidence\\": > [I]t all looks like reporting, but everything underscores (indique √† > l'√©vidence) that it is the fiction of a documentary (in fact, Kiarostami > shot the film several months after the earthquake), and that it is rather a > document about \\"fiction\\": not in the sense of imagining the unreal, but in > the very specific and precise sense of the technique, of the art of > constructing images. For the image by means of which, each time, each opens > a world and precedes himself in it (s'y pr√©c√®de) is not pregiven (donn√©e > toute faite) (as are those of dreams, phantasms or bad films): it is to be > invented, cut and edited. Thus it is evidence, insofar as, if one day I > happen to look at my street on which I walk up and down ten times a day, I > construct for an instant a new evidence of my street.Jean-Luc Nancy, \\"On > Evidence: Life and Nothing More, by Abbas Kiarostami,\\" Discourse 21.1 > (1999), p.82. Also, cf., Jean Luc Nancy. Is Cinema Renewing Itself? Film- > Philosophy. vol. 6 no. 15, July 2002. For Jean-Luc Nancy, this notion of cinema as \\"evidence\\", rather than as documentary or imagination, is tied to the way Kiarostami deals with life-and- death (cf. the remark by Geoff Andrew on ABC Africa, cited above, to the effect that Kiarostami's films are not about death but about life-and-death): > Existence resists the indifference of life-and-death, it lives beyond > mechanical \\"life,\\" it is always its own mourning, and its own joy. It > becomes figure, image. It does not become alienated in images, but it is > presented there: the images are the evidence of its existence, the > objectivity of its assertion. This thought‚Äîwhich, for me, is the very > thought of this film [Life and Nothing More...]‚Äîis a difficult thought, > perhaps the most difficult. It's a slow thought, always under way, fraying a > path so that the path itself becomes thought. It is that which frays images > so that images become this thought, so that they become the evidence of this > thought‚Äîand not to \\"represent\\" it.Jean-Luc Nancy, \\"On Evidence: Life and > Nothing More, by Abbas Kiarostami,\\" Discourse 21.1 (1999), p.85‚Äì6. In other words, wanting to accomplish more than just represent life and death as opposing forces, but rather to illustrate the way in which each element of nature is inextricably linked, Kiarostami devised a cinema that does more than just present the viewer with the documentable \\"facts,\\" but neither is it simply a matter of artifice. Because \\"existence\\" means more than simply life, it is projective, containing an irreducibly fictive element, but in this \\"being more than\\" life, it is therefore contaminated by mortality. Nancy is giving a clue, in other words, toward the interpretation of Kiarostami's statement that lying is the only way to truth.Jean-Luc Nancy, The Evidence of Film ‚Äì Abbas Kiarostami, Yves Gevaert, Belgium 2001, =Themes of life and death= Kiarostami (left) at the Estoril Film Festival in 2010 The concepts of change and continuity, in addition to the themes of life and death, play a major role in Kiarostami's works. In the Koker trilogy, these themes play a central role. As illustrated in the aftermath of the 1990 Manjil‚ÄìRudbar earthquake disaster, they also represent the power of human resilience to overcome and defy destruction. Unlike the Koker films, which convey an instinctual thirst for survival, Taste of Cherry explores the fragility of life and focuses on how precious it is. Symbols of death abound in The Wind Will Carry Us, with the scenery of the graveyard, the imminence of the old woman's passing, and the ancestors referred to early in the film by the character Farzad. Such devices prompt the viewer to reflect on the parameters of the afterlife and immaterial existence. The viewer is asked to consider what constitutes the soul, and what happens to it after death. In discussing the film, Kiarostami said that he is the person who raises questions, rather than answers them. Some film critics believe that the assemblage of light versus dark scenes in Kiarostami's film grammar, such as in Taste of Cherry and The Wind Will Carry Us, suggests the mutual existence of life with its endless possibilities, and death as a factual moment of anyone's life. =Visual and audio techniques= Kiarostami's style is notable for the use of panoramic long shots, such as in the closing sequences of Life and Nothing More and Through the Olive Trees, where the audience is intentionally distanced physically from the characters to stimulate reflection on their fate. Taste of Cherry is punctuated throughout by shots of this kind, including distant overhead shots of the suicidal Badii's car moving across the hills, usually while he is conversing with a passenger. However, the visual distancing techniques stand in juxtaposition to the sound of the dialog, which always remains in the foreground. Like the coexistence of a private and public space, or the frequent framing of landscapes through car windows, this fusion of distance with proximity can be seen as a way of generating suspense in the most mundane of moments. This relationship between distance and intimacy, between imagery and sound, is also present in the opening sequence to The Wind Will Carry Us. Michael J. Anderson has argued that such a thematic application of this central concept of presence without presence, through using such techniques, and by often referring to characters which the viewer does not see and sometimes not hear directly affects the nature and concept of space in the geographical framework in which the world is portrayed. Kiarostami's use of sound and imagery conveys a world beyond what is directly visible and/or audible, which Anderson believes emphasizes the interconnectedness and shrinking of time and space in the modern world of telecommunications. Other commentators such as film critic Ben Zipper believe that Kiarostami's work as a landscape artist is evident in his compositional distant shots of the dry hills throughout a number of his films directly impacting on his construction on the rural landscapes within his films. =Poetry and imagery= Ahmad Karimi-Hakkak, of the University of Maryland, argues that one aspect of Kiarostami's cinematic style is that he is able to capture the essence of Persian poetry and create poetic imagery within the landscape of his films. In several of his movies such as Where is the Friend's Home and The Wind Will Carry Us, classical Persian poetry is directly quoted in the film, highlighting the artistic link and intimate connection between them. This in turn reflects on the connection between the past and present, between continuity and change.Karimi-Hakkak, Ahmad. \\"From Kinetic Poetics to a Poetic Cinema: Abbas Kiarostami and the Esthetics of Persian Poetry.\\" University of Maryland (2005) The characters recite poems mainly from classical Persian poet Omar Khayy√°m or modern Persian poets such as Sohrab Sepehri and Forough Farrokhzad. One scene in The Wind Will Carry Us has a long shot of a wheat field with rippling golden crops through which the doctor, accompanied by the filmmaker, is riding his scooter in a twisting road. In response to the comment that the other world is a better place than this one, the doctor recites this poem of Khayyam: > They promise of houries in heaven But I would say wine is better Take the > present to the promises A drum sounds melodious from distance However, the aesthetic element involved with the poetry goes much farther back in time and is used more subtly than these examples suggest. Beyond issues of adaptation of text to film, Kiarostami often begins with an insistent will to give visual embodiment to certain specific image-making techniques in Persian poetry, both classical and modern. This prominently results in enunciating a larger philosophical position, namely the ontological oneness of poetry and film. It has been argued that the creative merit of Kiarostami's adaptation of Sohrab Sepehri and Forough Farrokhzad's poems extends the domain of textual transformation. Adaptation is defined as the transformation of a prior to a new text. Sima Daad of the University of Washington contends that Kiarostami's adaptation arrives at the theoretical realm of adaptation by expanding its limit from inter-textual potential to trans-generic potential. =Spirituality= Kiarostami's films often reflect upon immaterial concepts such as soul and afterlife. At times, however, the very concept of the spiritual seems to be contradicted by the medium. Some film theorists have argued that The Wind Will Carry Us provides a template by which a filmmaker can communicate metaphysical reality. The limits of the frame, the material representation of a space in dialog with another that is not represented, physically become metaphors for the relationship between this world and those which may exist apart from it. By limiting the space of the mise en sc√®ne, Kiarostami expands the space of the art. Kiarostami's \\"complex\\" sound-images and philosophical approach have caused frequent comparisons with \\"mystical\\" filmmakers such as Andrei Tarkovsky and Robert Bresson. While acknowledging substantial cultural differences, much of Western critical writing about Kiarostami positions him as the Iranian equivalent of such directors, by virtue of a similarly austere, \\"spiritual\\" poetics and moral commitment. Some draw parallels between certain imagery in Kiarostami's films with that of Sufi concepts. While most English-language writers, such as David Sterritt and the Spanish film professor Alberto Elena, interpret Kiarostami's films as spiritual, other critics, including David Walsh and Hamish Ford, have not rated its influence in his films as lower. Poetry, art and photography Installation art by Abbas Kiarostami Kiarostami, along with Jean Cocteau, Satyajit Ray, Derek Jarman and Alejandro Jodorowsky, was a filmmaker who expressed himself in other genres, such as poetry, set designs, painting, or photography. They expressed their interpretation of the world and their understanding of our preoccupations and identities. Kiarostami was a noted photographer and poet. A bilingual collection of more than 200 of his poems, Walking with the Wind, was published by Harvard University Press. His photographic work includes Untitled Photographs, a collection of over thirty photographs, mostly of snow landscapes, taken in his hometown Tehran, between 1978 and 2003. In 1999, he also published a collection of his poems.Kiarostami mostra fotos de neve (Kiarostami shows snow photographs) (Portuguese) ‚Äì a newspaper article on the display of Untitled Photographs in Lisbon. Kiarostami also produced Mozart's opera, Cos√¨ fan tutte, which premiered in Aix-en- Provence in 2003 before being performed at the English National Opera in London in 2004. Riccardo Zipoli, from the Ca' Foscari University of Venice, has studied the relations and interconnections between Kiarostami's poems and his films. The results of the analysis reveal how Kiarostami's treatment of \\"uncertain reality\\" is similar in his poems and films. Kiarostami's poetry is reminiscent of the later nature poems of the Persian painter-poet, Sohrab Sepehri. On the other hand, the succinct allusion to philosophical truths without the need for deliberation, the non-judgmental tone of the poetic voice, and the structure of the poem‚Äîabsence of personal pronouns, adverbs or over reliance on adjectives‚Äîas well as the lines containing a kigo („Åç„ÅîÂ≠£Ë™û, a \\"season word\\") gives much of this poetry a haikuesque characteristic. Kiarostami's three volumes of original verse, plus his selections from classical and contemporary Persian poets, including Nima, Hafez, Rumi and Saadi, were translated into English in 2015 and were published in bilingual (Persian/English) editions by Sticking Place Books in New York. Personal life In 1969, Kiarostami married Parvin Amir-Gholi. They had two sons, Ahmad (born 1971) and Bahman (1978). They divorced in 1982. Kiarostami was one of the few directors who remained in Iran after the 1979 revolution, when many of his peers fled the country. He believes that it was one of the most important decisions of his career. His permanent base in Iran and his national identity have consolidated his ability as a filmmaker: > When you take a tree that is rooted in the ground, and transfer it from one > place to another, the tree will no longer bear fruit. And if it does, the > fruit will not be as good as it was in its original place. This is a rule of > nature. I think if I had left my country, I would be the same as the tree. Kiarostami frequently wore dark spectacles or sunglasses, which he required because of a sensitivity to light. =Illness and death= In March 2016, Kiarostami was hospitalized due to intestinal bleeding and reportedly went into a comaLeading Iranian filmmaker Abbas Kiarostami battles coma, cancer. Payvand. after undergoing two operations. Sources, including a Ministry of Health and Medical Education spokesman, reported that Kiarostami was suffering from gastrointestinal cancer.\\"Medical team director denies report on Abbas Kiarostami's cancer. Tehran Times. On 3 April 2016, Reza Paydar, the director of Kiarostami's medical team, made a statement denying that the filmmaker had cancer. However, in late June he left Iran for treatment in a Paris hospital,Abbas Kiarostami leaves Iran to receive treatment at Paris hospital, where he died on 4 July 2016. The week before his death, Kiarostami had been invited to join the Academy Awards in Hollywood as part of efforts to increase the diversity of its Oscar judges. Ali Ahani, Iran's ambassador to France stated that Kiarostami's body would be transferred to Iran to be buried at Behesht-e Zahra cemetery. However, it was later announced that his body would be buried in Lavasan, a resort town about northeast of Tehran, based on his own will, after it is flown back to Tehran from Paris. His body was returned to Tehran's Imam Khomeini International Airport on 8 July 2016, while a crowd of Iranian film directors, actors, actresses and other artists were in Tehran airport to pay their respects. Mohammad Shirvani, a fellow filmmaker and close friend, quoted Kiarostami on his Facebook wall 8 June 2016: \\"I do not believe I could stand and direct any more films. They [the medical team] destroyed it [his digestive system].\\" After this comment, a campaign was set up by Iranians on both Twitter and Facebook to investigate the possibility of medical error during Kiarostami's procedure. However, Ahmad Kiarostami, his eldest son, denied any medical error in his father's treatment after Shirvani's comment and said that his father's health was no cause for alarm. After Kiarostami's death, Head of the Iranian Medical Council Dr. Alireza Zali sent a letter to his French counterpart, Patrick Bouet, urging him to send Kiarostami's medical file to Iran for further investigation.Iran urges France to send home Kiarostami's medical dossier Nine days after Kiarostami's death, on 13 July 2016, his family issued a formal complaint of medical maltreatment through Kiarostami's personal doctor. Dariush Mehrjui, famous Iranian cinema director also criticized the medical team that treated Kiarostami and demanded legal action. Reactions People place candles and flowers in memorial of Kiarostami at Tehran's Ferdows Garden (Cinema Museum) Martin Scorsese said he was \\"deeply shocked and saddened\\" by the news. Oscar-winning Iranian film- maker Asghar Farhadi ‚Äì who had been due to fly to Paris to visit his friend ‚Äì said he was \\"very sad, in total shock\\". Mohsen Makhmalbaf echoed the sentiment, saying Iran's cinema owes its global reputation to his fellow director, but that this visibility did not translate into a greater visibility for his work in his homeland. \\"Kiarostami gave the Iranian cinema the international credibility that it has today,\\" he told The Guardian. \\"But his films were unfortunately not seen as much in Iran. He changed the world's cinema; he freshened it and humanised it in contrast with Hollywood's rough version.\\" Persian mystic and poet Jalal al-Din Rumi's 22nd niece Esin Celebi also expressed her condolences over the demise of Kiarostami in a separate message. Iran's representative office at the United Nations Educational, Scientific and Cultural Organization, UNESCO also opened a memorial book for signature to honour Kiatostami.UNESCO opens memorial book for signature to honour Kiarostami Iranian President Hassan Rouhani said on Twitter that the director's \\"different and profound attitude towards life and his invitation to peace and friendship\\" would be a \\"lasting achievement.\\" Foreign Minister Mohammad-Javad Zarif also said Kiarostami's death was a loss for international cinema. In a statement, French President Fran√ßois Hollande praised the director for forging \\"close artistic ties and deep friendships\\" with France. Media, such as The New York Times, CNN, The Guardian, The Huffington Post, The Independent, Associated Press, Euronews and Le Monde also reacted to Kiarostami's death. The New York Times wrote: \\"Abbas Kiarostami, Acclaimed Iranian Filmmaker, Dies at 76\\" and Peter Bradshaw paid tribute to Kiarostami: \\"a sophisticated, self-possessed master of cinematic poetry\\" The crowd that had gathered for this service in Paris held a vigil by the River Seine. They then allowed the Seine waves to take photos of Kiarostami that the crowd had left on the river floating. It was symbolic moment of saying goodbye to a film director that many Iranians have come to passionately appreciate. Funeral Kiarostami's grave at Lavasan Artists, cultural authorities, government officials and the Iranian people gathered to say goodbye to Kiarostami on 10 July, in an emotional funeral, six days after his death in France. The ceremony was held at the Center for the Intellectual Education of Children, where he began his film-making career some 40 years before. Attendees held banners with the titles of his movies and pictures of his most famous posters, as they praised the support Kiarostami contributed to culture, and particularly, to filmmaking in Iran. The ceremony was hosted by famous Iranian actor Parviz Parastooie, and included speeches by painter Aidin Aghdashlou and by also prize-winning film director Asghar Farhadi, who stressed his professional abilities. He was later buried in a private ceremony in northern Tehran town, Lavasan.Iranians Pay Tribute to Late Filmmaker Abbas Kiarostami Reception and criticism Kiarostami has received worldwide acclaim for his work from both audiences and critics, and, in 1999, he was voted the most important Iranian film director of the 1990s by two international critics' polls. Four of his films were placed in the top six of Cinematheque Ontario's Best of the '90s poll. He has gained recognition from film theorists, critics, as well as peers such as Jean-Luc Godard, Nanni Moretti (who made a short film about opening one of Kiarostami's films in his theater in Rome), Chris Marker, and Ray Carney. Akira Kurosawa said of Kiarostami's films: \\"Words cannot describe my feelings about them ... When Satyajit Ray passed on, I was very depressed. But after seeing Kiarostami's films, I thanked God for giving us just the right person to take his place.\\" Critically acclaimed directors such as Martin Scorsese have commented that \\"Kiarostami represents the highest level of artistry in the cinema.\\" The Austrian director Michael Haneke has admired the work of Abbas Kiarostami as among the best of any living director. In 2006, The Guardians panel of critics ranked Kiarostami as the best contemporary non-American film director. Critics such as Jonathan Rosenbaum have argued that \\"there's no getting around the fact that the movies of Abbas Kiarostami divide audiences‚Äîin this country, in his native Iran, and everywhere else they're shown.\\" Rosenbaum argues that disagreements and controversy over Kiarostami's movies have arisen from his style of film-making because what in Hollywood would count as essential narrative information is frequently missing from Kiarostami's films. Camera placement, likewise, often defies standard audience expectations: in the closing sequences of Life and Nothing More and Through the Olive Trees, the audience is forced to imagine the dialogue and circumstances of important scenes. In Homework and Close-Up, parts of the soundtrack are masked or silenced. Critics have argued that the subtlety of Kiarostami's cinematic expression is largely resistant to critical analysis.Daniel Ross, Review of Geoff Andrew, Ten. Iranian film director Asghar Farhadi speaking on Abbas Kiarostami's funeral, in Tehran, Iran While Kiarostami has won significant acclaim in Europe for several of his films, the Iranian government has refused to permit the screening of his films, to which he responded \\"The government has decided not to show any of my films for the past 10 years... I think they don't understand my films and so prevent them being shown just in case there is a message they don't want to get out\\". In the wake of the September 11 attacks, Kiarostami was refused a visa to attend the New York Film Festival. The festival director, Richard Pe√±a, who had invited him said, \\"It's a terrible sign of what's happening in my country today that no one seems to realize or care about the kind of negative signal this sends out to the entire Muslim world\\". The Finnish film director Aki Kaurism√§ki boycotted the festival in protest. Kiarostami had been invited by the New York Film Festival, as well as Ohio University and Harvard University. In 2005, London Film School organized a workshop as well as festival of Kiarostami's work, titled \\"Abbas Kiarostami: Visions of the Artist\\". Ben Gibson, Director of the London Film School, said, \\"Very few people have the creative and intellectual clarity to invent cinema from its most basic elements, from the ground up. We are very lucky to have the chance to see a master like Kiarostami thinking on his feet.\\" He was later made Honorary Associate. In 2007, the Museum of Modern Art and MoMA PS1 coorganized a festival of the Kiarostami's work titled Abbas Kiarostami: Image Maker. Kiarostami and his cinematic style have been the subject of several books and three films, Opening Day of Close-Up (1996), directed by Nanni Moretti, Abbas Kiarostami: The Art of Living (2003), directed by Fergus Daly, and Abbas Kiarostami: A Report (2014), directed by Bahman Maghsoudlou. Kiarostami was a member of the advisory board of World Cinema Foundation. Founded by the director Martin Scorsese, its goal is to find and reconstruct world cinema films that have been long neglected. =Honors and awards= Kiarostami has won the admiration of audiences and critics worldwide and received at least seventy awards up to the year 2000.

The story was serialised daily in , Belgium's leading francophone newspaper, from October 1941 to May 1942 amidst the German occupation of Belgium during World War II. The story tells of young Belgian reporter Tintin, who travels with his dog Snowy and friend Captain Haddock aboard a scientific expedition to the Arctic Ocean on an international race to find a meteorite that has fallen to the Earth. The Shooting Star was a commercial success and was published in book form by Casterman shortly after its conclusion; the first Tintin volume to be originally published in the 62-page full-colour format. Herg√© continued The Adventures of Tintin with The Secret of the Unicorn, while the series itself became a defining part of the Franco-Belgian comics tradition. The Shooting Star has received a mixed critical reception and has been one of the more controversial instalments in the series due to the perceived antisemitic portrayal of its villain. The story was adapted for both the 1957 Belvision animated series, Herg√©'s Adventures of Tintin, and for the 1991 animated series The Adventures of Tintin by Ellipse and Nelvana. Synopsis A giant meteoroid approaches the Earth, spotted from an observatory by Professor Decimus Phostle, and he and a self-proclaimed prophet, Philippulus, predicts the meteoroid will hit Earth and cause the end of the world. The meteoroid misses Earth, but a fragment of it plunges into the Arctic Ocean. Phostle determines that the object is made of a new material which he names Phostlite, and arranges an expedition to find it with a crew of European scientists. Accompanied by Tintin and Snowy, their polar expedition ship, the Aurora, is helmed by Tintin's friend Captain Haddock. Meanwhile, another expedition is funded by the financier Mr. Bohlwinkel, with a team setting out aboard the polar expedition ship Peary; wherefore, Phostle's expedition becomes part of a race to land on the meteorite. On the day of the Aurora's departure, Bohlwinkel has a henchman plant a stick of dynamite on the ship, but it is found and eventually thrown overboard. In one of the shipping lanes of the North Sea, the Aurora is almost rammed by another of Bohlwinkel's ships, but Haddock steers out of the way. Further setbacks occur when Aurora must refuel at Iceland, going to the port of Akureyri, where Haddock is informed that the Golden Oil Company (which has a fuel monopoly) has no fuel available. He and Tintin then come across an old friend of his, Captain Chester, who reveals Golden Oil has plenty of fuel and is owned by Bohlwinkel's bank. Tintin comes up with a plan to trick Golden Oil into providing the fuel they need by secretly running a hose to Aurora from Chester's ship, Sirius: when Golden Oil refuels Sirius, the hose allows them to refuel Aurora in the process. Close to the Peary, the Aurora receives an indistinct distress call from another ship and the crew agrees to alter their course to help, but inquiries by Tintin expose that the distress signal is a decoy to delay them. Resuming the journey, they intercept a cable announcing that the Peary expedition has reached the meteorite but not yet claimed it. While the Peary crew rows to the meteorite, Tintin uses the Auroras seaplane to get to and parachute onto the meteorite and plant the expedition's flag. Tintin and Snowy (who followed on the plane) make camp while the Auroras engines are repaired after developing trouble. The next day he finds the Phostlite creating immense explosive mushrooms, and discovers that Phostlite accelerates growth, and makes things much larger: his apple core grows into a large tree while a maggot grows into a huge butterfly, and he and Snowy are menaced by a giant spider that escaped from his lunch box, before rescue arrives. A sudden seaquake shakes the meteorite to its core and it starts sinking into the sea. Tintin gets himself, Snowy and a piece of Phostlite to the pilot of the Auroras seaplane in the plane's life raft, as the meteorite itself finally disappears into the sea. Thereafter Bohlwinkel learns that he is expected to be tried for his crimes. As the Aurora returns home, Captain Haddock steers the ship toward land to refuel not with oil, but with whiskey. History =Background= Arado 196 seaplane used by Herg√© as inspiration for the type used by Tintin in the book Amidst the German occupation of Belgium during World War II, Herg√© became the founding editor of Le Soir Jeunesse, a children's supplement in Belgium's leading newspaper, Le Soir. Herg√©'s previous employer, the Catholic newspaper Le Vingti√®me Si√®cle (which had originated The Adventures of Tintin through its own children's supplement, Le Petit Vingti√®me) was no longer allowed by the German authorities to continue publishing; Le Soir, in contrast, was allowed to stay open under the administrative control of the occupying military government. Le Soir Jeunesse serialized most of The Shooting Star's immediate predecessor, The Crab with the Golden Claws, but ceased publication due to paper shortages in 1941. The Adventures of Tintin was then moved to Le Soir itself, where The Crab with the Golden Claws was concluded and the subsequent four Adventures (including The Shooting Star) were serialized. During its initial serialization, The Shooting Star featured the United States as the primary antagonists; explaining this, Herg√© asserted that the story revolved around the theme of \\"the rivalry for progress between Europe and the United States\\". Although not disliking Americans themselves, he had a strong disdain for American big business, and had exhibited anti-American themes in earlier works, in particular in Tintin in America. During serialisation of The Shooting Star, in December 1941, the U.S. entered the war on the side of the Allies, thus coming into direct conflict with Germany. All of the scientists featured were from Axis, neutral, or occupied countries which might be a reflection of the strip's anti-Allies political slant. Herg√© biographer Harry Thompson stated this should not be interpreted as a strong anti-Ally bias, for the only two nation-states in Europe that were part of the Allies at that point were the Soviet Union and United Kingdom, and that the characters of Haddock and Chester were British. As he had done for other Adventures of Tintin which featured sea travel, Herg√© was careful to obtain as much data about ships as possible in order to make his portrayals more realistic. The design of the Aurora was based on the RRS William Scoresby, while that of the Peary was most likely based upon another Antarctic ship, the RRS Discovery. The seaplane on which the expedition travels was based on the German Arado 196-A. Herg√© nevertheless later criticised his own efforts in this area, saying that if Aurora had been a real ship, it would probably be unseaworthy. The Shooting Star shared plot similarities with The Chase of the Golden Meteor, a 1908 novel by pioneering French science-fiction writer Jules Verne. As in Herg√©'s story, Verne's novel features an expedition to the North Atlantic to find a meteorite fragment containing a new element. In both stories, the competing expedition teams were led by an eccentric professor and a Jewish banker, and Verne's novel had a Doktor Schultze to Herg√©'s Professor Schulze‚Äîboth from the University of Jena. Herg√© denied deliberately copying Verne's story, saying that he had only read one of the French novelist's works; it is possible that the influence from Verne came via Jacques Van Melkebeke, Herg√©'s friend and assistant, who was a fan of the genre. The Swedish expedition member Eric Bj√∂rgenskj√∂ld physically resembles a real person: Auguste Piccard, who later became Herg√©'s inspiration for Professor Calculus. =Antisemitism= Under Nazi control, Le Soir was publishing a variety of antisemitic articles, calling for the Jews to be further excluded from public life and describing them as racial enemies of the Belgian people. Herg√© biographer Pierre Assouline noted that there was a \\"remarkable correlation\\" between the antisemitic nature of Le Soir editorials and The Shooting Star depiction of Jews. Within months of the story's publication, legislation was passed to collect and deport Jews from Belgium to Nazi concentration camps. Thus, The Shooting Star reflected trends in the Belgian political situation at the time. However, the story was not the first time that Herg√© had adopted such a perspective in his work; he had recently provided illustrations for Robert de Vroyland's Fables, a number of which contained antisemitic stereotypes, reflecting the racism in much of de Vroyland's book. Similarly, his depiction of the character of Rastapopoulos, who was introduced in Tintin in America, has been cited as being based upon antisemitic stereotypes. When The Shooting Star appeared in Le Soir, Herg√© featured a gag in which two Jews hear the prophetic news that the end of the world is near. They rub their hands together in eagerness, and one comments: \\"Did you hear, Isaac? The end of the world! What if it's true?\\" The other responds: \\"Hey, hey, it vould be a gut ding, Solomon! I owe my suppliers 50,000 francs, and zis way I von't haf to pay vem!\\" Herg√© omitted this scene from the collected edition. Anti-Semitic and anti-English propaganda on display in an exhibition in Brussels in 1941 The character of Blumenstein displays antisemitic stereotypes, such as having a bulbous nose and being an avaricious, manipulative businessman. Herg√© later dismissed concerns over this Jewish caricature, saying, \\"That was the style then.\\" In his assessment of Franco-Belgian comics, Matthew Screech expressed the opinion that Blumenstein was an anti-American stereotype rather than an anti-Jewish one. Similarly, reporter and Tintin expert Michael Farr asserted that Blumenstein was \\"more parodied as a financier than Jew\\". Conversely, Lofficier and Lofficier asserted that both anti-Americanism and antisemitism were present, and that it is the United States and International Jewry who were the \\"ruthless opponents\\" of Tintin. Nazi apologists and revisionists such as French Holocaust denier Olivier Mathieu used The Shooting Star as evidence that Herg√© was an antisemite with Nazi sympathies. To graphic novel specialist Hugo Frey, the competing expeditions are presented as a simplistic race between good and evil, wherein Blumestein displays the stereotypes of Jews held by advocates of the Jewish World Conspiracy presented in works such as the antisemitic Protocols of the Elders of Zion. Frey writes that Blumenstein's \\"large and bulbous nose ... rounded forehead, receding black hair, and small beady eyes\\" were stock antisemitic imagery in the 1930s and 1940s, as promoted by those such as journalist √âdouard Drumont, whose antisemitic Paris-based newspaper La Libre Parole was influential in Brussels. According to Frey, Blumenstein's depiction as an overweight cigar-smoker reflected the antisemitic stereotype of Jews as being financially powerful, while he suggested that the scene in which Blumenstein learned that he was to be tracked down for his crimes recalled the contemporary roundup of Jews in Nazi Europe. Frey contrasts Herg√©'s complicity with the antisemites to the actions of others Belgians, such as those who struck against the Nazis at the Universit√© libre de Bruxelles and those who risked their lives to hide Jews. =Publication= One of the politically loaded images. Initially, the antagonists were Americans (top), while later editions feature the flag of the fictitious country S√£o Rico (bottom) The Shooting Star was serialised daily in from 20 October 1941 to 21 May 1942 in French under the title (The Mysterious Star). Tintin's previous adventure, The Crab with the Golden Claws, had been serialised weekly until the demise of s children's supplement, , before continuing daily in the main newspaper itself; the earlier serial had ended the day before The Shooting Star began. The Shooting Star was the first Tintin adventure to be serialised daily in its entirety. As with earlier Adventures of Tintin, the story was later serialised in France in the Catholic newspaper C≈ìurs Vaillants, where it first appeared on 6 June 1943. On page 20 of the published book, Herg√© included a cameo of the characters Thomson and Thompson and Quick & Flupke. The story also introduced Captain Chester, who is mentioned in later adventures, and Professor Cantonneau, who returns in The Seven Crystal Balls. On 21 May 1942, The Shooting Star concluded serialisation. Less than a week later, the occupied government proclaimed that all Jews in Belgium would have to wear a yellow badge on their clothing, and in July the Gestapo began raids on Jewish premises, followed by deportations of Jews to Nazi concentration camps and extermination camps, resulting in around 32,000 Belgian Jews being killed. Herg√© later recalled: \\"I saw very few Jews wearing the yellow star, but finally I did see some. They told me that some Jews were gone; that people had come for them and sent them away. I didn't want to believe it.\\" The earlier Tintin albums reproduced the newspaper strips, which had come to appear weekly in Thursday supplements, two-page allotments of three tiers to a page. War shortages reduced the space for the strip by a third, and later the supplements disappeared completely; the comic appeared daily in the main newspaper as a four-panel strip. For publication in book form, Casterman insisted that Herg√© must adhere to a new album format of four sixteen-page signatures, which gave sixty-two pages of story plus a cover page. Though the format reduced the page count, it maintained the same amount of story by reducing the size of the panels reproduced. As The Shooting Star progressed, Herg√© cut up and laid out clippings of the strip in an exercise book in preparation for the new layouts. It was the first volume of The Adventures of Tintin to be originally published in the 62-page full-colour format that thereafter was the series standard (as opposed to first being published in a black and white newspaper strip reproduction format that all prior books had done). Casterman published the album in September 1942. Unlike the previous books in the series, because it was printed immediately in colour, it did not need to be totally redrawn. The 177 daily strips from the original serialisation were not enough to fill the 62 pages Casterman had allotted, so Herg√© added large panels, such as a half-page panel of a giant telescope on page three. Herg√© wanted to include a small gold star inside the \\"o\\" of \\"√âtoile\\" on the cover page, but Casterman refused, deeming it too expensive. In 1954, Herg√© began making various changes to the story for its re- publication. Aware of the controversy surrounding the depiction of Blumenstein, he renamed the character \\"Bohlwinkel\\", adopting this name from , a Brussels dialect term for a confectionery store. He later discovered that, by coincidence, Bohlwinkel was also a Jewish name. Trying to tone down the book's anti-American sentiment, he also changed the United States to a fictional South American nation called S√£o Rico, replacing the U.S. flag flown by the Pearys crew with that of the fictional state. In 1959, Herg√© made a new list of changes to be made to the artwork in The Shooting Star, which included altering Bohlwinkel's nose, but the changes were postponed and never made. Critical analysis Pierre Assouline remarked that Herg√©'s attention to accuracy lapsed in The Shooting Star. For instance, the meteorite's approach toward Earth caused a heat wave, while the meteorite itself proceeded to float on the surface of the ocean. In reality, no such heat wave would have been caused, while the meteorite would have plunged to the sea floor, causing a tsunami. He noted that the concept of madness was a recurring theme throughout the story, and that there was \\"an unreality in the whole adventure\\". Fellow biographer Beno√Æt Peeters asserted that The Shooting Star was \\"of great power and brilliant construction\\". Elsewhere, Peeters wrote that the book was \\"notable for the entry of the fantastic into Herg√©'s work\\". Jean-Marc and Randy Lofficier deemed the antisemitism a \\"sad moment\\" in the series, awarding the story one out of five stars. Nevertheless, they felt that the \\"pre- apocalyptic ambiance is stark and believable\\", and that the giant mushrooms on the meteorite were a \\"strange anticipation\\" of the mushroom-clouds produced by the atomic bombings in 1945. Focusing on the characters of Professor Phostle and Philippulus, they asserted that both resembled Sophocles Sarcophagus from Cigars of the Pharaoh and that the former was \\"in the Jules Verne tradition\\" of eccentric professors. According to philosopher Pascal Bruckner, Tintin experts find Philippulus a caricature of Marshal of France Philippe P√©tain, who demanded the French repent imaginary sins when he took power. Philippe Goddin stated that the strips for this story \\"kept the reader daily on tenterhooks in a story replete with new twists and humour\\". Harry Thompson described The Shooting Star as \\"the most important of all Herg√©'s wartime stories\\", having \\"an air of bizarre fantasy\\" that was unlike his prior work. He observed that the character of Professor Phostle was a prototype for Professor Calculus, introduced later in the series. Michael Farr asserted that the apocalyptic setting of the story reflected the wartime mood in Europe. He characterises the opening pages of the story as being \\"unique in work for the feeling of foreboding they convey\\", adding that \\"Herg√© daringly eschews the strip cartoonist's recognised means of denoting a dream, deliberately confusing the reader\\". He felt that the \\"flow of the narrative is less accomplished\\" than in other stories, with \\"spurts and rushes followed by slower passages, upsetting the rhythm and pace\\". Literary critic Jean-Marie Apostolid√®s psychoanalysed The Shooting Star, describing it as \\"the final attempt of the foundling [i.e. Tintin] to rid himself of the bastard [i.e. Haddock] and to preserve the integrity of his former values\\", pointing out that the first thirteen pages are devoted purely to the boy reporter. He also argued that Phostle and Philippus represent two-halves of \\"an ambivalent father figure\\" within the story, with the former prefiguring Calculus \\"more than any other previous character\\". He suggests that when hiding on the Aurora, Philippus can be compared to The Phantom of the Opera, as he steals a stick of dynamite and climbs up the ship's mast before threatening to detonate the weapon. Apostolid√®s believed that the shooting star itself is \\"more a religious mystery than a scientific one\\" and that Tintin is therefore \\"the perfect one to figure it out in some religious way‚Äîthat is, unrealistically\\". Apostolid√®s analysed the political component of the story in terms of \\"the incarnation of unregulated capitalism against the spirit of European values\\", arguing that Herg√© was adhering to \\"a utopian vision that, in 1942, smacks of pro-German propaganda\\". Literary critic Tom McCarthy believed that The Shooting Star represents the apex of the \\"right-wing strain\\" in Herg√©'s work. He highlighted the instance in which Tintin impersonates God in order to give commands to Philippus as representing one of various occasions in The Adventures of Tintin where \\"sacred authority manifests itself largely as a voice, and commanding‚Äîor commandeering‚Äîthat voice is what guarantees power\\". McCarthy further observes that the image of a giant spider in a ball of fire, which appears near the start of the story, reflects the theme of madness that is again present throughout the series. Discussing the political elements of Herg√©'s series, McCarthy also noted that in the original publication of the story, the spider which climbed in front of the observatory telescope and was thus magnified greatly was initially termed Aranea Fasciata; he saw this as an intentional satire of the threat to Europe posed by fascism. Adaptations In 1957, the animation company Belvision Studios produced a string of colour adaptations based on Herg√©'s original comics, adapting eight of the Adventures into a series of daily five-minute episodes. The Shooting Star was the sixth to be adapted in the second animated series; it was directed by Ray Goossens and written by Greg, a well-known cartoonist who was to become editor-in-chief of Tintin magazine. In 1991, a second animated series based upon The Adventures of Tintin was produced, this time as a collaboration between the French studio Ellipse and the Canadian animation company Nelvana. The Shooting Star was the eighth story to be adapted and was a single twenty-minute episode. Directed by St√©phane Bernasconi, the series has been praised for being \\"generally faithful\\" to the original comics, to the extent that the animation was directly adopted from Herg√©'s original panels. Bohlwinkel was tactfully kept nameless in the adaptation and his arrest is shown. In 2010, American cartoonist Charles Burns authored X'ed Out, a graphic novel with a variety of allusions to The Adventures of Tintin. In one scene, the protagonist Nitnit discovers a warehouse containing white eggs with red spots, akin to the mushrooms in The Shooting Star, with the cover of Burns' book paying homage to Herg√©. In 2015, the original front cover sketch of the book was sold for ‚Ç¨2.5 million to a European investor, Marina David of Petits Papiers-Huberty-Breyne, at the Brussels Antiques and Fine Art Fair.

He is best known as a member of the rock bands Happy Mondays and Black Grape. Early life Mark Berry was born on 18 April 1964Researcha in Bolton, Lancashire, the son of parents from the Norris Green district of Liverpool. His father was a detective inspector. He grew up in Bolton, Little Hulton, and Walkden, before moving to live with his grandparents in Wigan at the age of 16. Career Bez introducing Ziggy Marley at GuilFest in 2011 Bez is best known as the maraca player, dancer, and de facto mascot of rock band Happy Mondays, having been invited by lead singer Shaun Ryder shortly after the band was formed. He is chiefly remembered for his bizarre style of dancing and use of maracas. The band's second single, \\"Freaky Dancin'\\", was rumoured to be a tribute to Bez. However, Ryder stated that this was not the case in his autobiography Twistin' My Melon. After the Happy Mondays broke up, Bez became a member of Ryder's next group Black Grape, but he left them in 1997. That same year, he had a feature on the BBC Two television programme The Sunday Show called Science with Bez. When both men faced large tax bills, Bez and Ryder reformed the Happy Mondays in 1998, but it was short-lived. A book about his experiences in both bands, Freaky Dancin' (), was published by Pan MacMillan in 1998. In the opening chapter, Bez detailed an incident during a Happy Mondays gig at Manchester's Ha√ßienda nightclub in 1986. In the middle of the set, he fell off the stage and cut his forehead. In the book, he writes, \\"The doc tells me to take it easy and put my feet up. I thought, 'I'm not fucking havin' that.' I got some of [lead guitarist] Moose's acid, dripped it in the cut and ran back out with me shakers. Fuckin' raz!\\"Freaky Dancin', 2nd edition, Chapter 1, p. 6 He appeared on Celebrity Big Brother in 2005, in order to pay off his outstanding tax bills, and was voted as the winner of the series. He used some of his winnings to improve the engine of his London black cab; the television show Pimp My Ride UK customised it to make it suit him. After the cab was \\"pimped\\", it had twenty speakers, eight amps, two DVD players, fifteen TV screens and a camera on the grille linked to one of the screens, the sign saying TAXI on the top was changed to PIMP, and it had purple paint on the outside. The New Musical Express (NME) carried a series of articles about famous members of bands whose musical contribution to their bandmates' success was negligible. The newspaper used the name \\"Bez\\" as a generic label for the likes of Chas Smash of Madness, Andrew Ridgeley of Wham!, Andy Fletcher of Depeche Mode, Paul Morley of Art of Noise, Linda McCartney of Wings, and Paul Rutherford of Frankie Goes to Hollywood. In 2006, Bez was promoting a compilation album titled Bez's Madchester Anthems: Sorted Tunes from Back in the Day. The Happy Mondays again reformed: the third incarnation of the group had Bez touring with them. On 2 July 2007, they released their first studio album in 15 years entitled Uncle Dysfunktional. On 4 September 2007, Bez went head-to-head with royal correspondent James Whitaker on ITV television programme Don't Call Me Stupid and beat him. Bez and James taught each other about their respective specialist subjects: the Manchester music scene and royal etiquette, and then they were quizzed on what they had learnt. This was followed by a general knowledge round. Despite not knowing that the Queen has two birthdays, Bez won. His prize, as selected by James, was a bottle of expensive red wine and a decanter so he didn't have to drink any \\"poor person's supermarket plonk\\". Bez took part in Series 4 of Adrenaline Junkie (aired on 1 October 2008 on ITV2), the tasks involved taking on the world's biggest bungee down the front of the dam which featured in GoldenEye, building an ice hotel in the mountains, and undertook a jump from one cable car to another. On 29 January 2012, Ryder announced on the radio station XFM that the band would return with the original and definitive line-up of himself, his brother Paul Ryder on bass, Bez, Gary Whelan on drums, Rowetta as backing vocalist, Mark Day on guitar and Paul Davis on keyboards. They appeared on ITV's This Morning, and were interviewed by Phillip Schofield. The band announced in September 2012 that they were writing their first album with the original line-up in more than 20 years. Bez was announced as the headliner on the DJ stage at upcoming festival Party in the Pines on 3 May 2014. In September 2018, he took part in a special episode of Bargain Hunt where he and Rowetta competed against Jarvis Cocker and Candida Doyle from Pulp. Bez and Rowetta won the episode by earning a profit of ¬£8, but it was later discovered that Bez's girlfriend had bought two of their items. As it was against the rules of the programme for friends and family of the teams to buy items the teams were selling, Cocker and Doyle were made the winners and Bez had to hand over ¬£8 from his own pocket. Personal life Berry currently resides in Urmston, Greater Manchester. He is a fan of Manchester United FC. He is a beekeeper and beer brewer in his spare time, and has lived on land-shares in Herefordshire and Wales.Interview with Radcliffe and Maconie on BBC 6Music 19 November 2013 At some point, he lived next door to Ryder in Padfield, Derbyshire. Bez was declared bankrupt in 2005 and 2008. In August 2010, Bez was convicted of physically assaulting his ex-girlfriend Monica Ward, with whom he has a son, by throttling and threatening to kill her. He was sentenced to four weeks in prison after having first received a community service sentence but refusing to co-operate. He was arrested at London's Euston Station in November 2010 for breaching a restraining order granted to Ward following the assault, and escorted to appear before magistrates in Manchester. In November 2014, Bez became a patron of homeless organisation Coffee4Craig. The organisation started in 2013 when married couple Risha and Hendrix Lancaster lost Risha's brother, Craig White, to a heroin overdose while sleeping rough. He is very active in his support, even inviting them to join him on the onstage bed in London during a Black Grape gig and frequently discussing the issue of homelessness. Bez stood as a candidate for the Salford and Eccles constituency in the 2015 UK General Election. The incumbent Member of Parliament, Hazel Blears, announced her intention to stand down at the election. Bez ran on a platform of \\"free energy, free food and free anything\\". He received 703 votes (1.6% of the total turnout) which placed him in sixth position in the constituency. The seat was won by the new Labour Party candidate, Rebecca Long-Bailey, who received 21,364 votes (49.4% of the total). In popular culture In the film 24 Hour Party People, Bez is played by Chris Coghill.

Named after the Norse god of thunder, it was deployed in the United Kingdom between 1959 and September 1963 as an intermediate-range ballistic missile (IRBM) with thermonuclear warheads. Thor was in height and in diameter. It was later augmented in the U.S. IRBM arsenal by the Jupiter. The Thor and later Delta families of space launch vehicles used boosters derived from the initial Thor missile. History Fearful that the Soviet Union would deploy a long-range ballistic missile before the U.S., in January 1956 the USAF began developing the Thor, a intermediate-range ballistic missile. The program proceeded quickly as a stop-gap measure, and within three years of inception the first of 20 Royal Air Force Thor squadrons became operational in the UK. The UK deployment carried the codename 'Project Emily'. One of the advantages of the design was that, unlike the Jupiter MRBM, the Thor could be carried by the USAF's cargo aircraft of the time, which made its deployment more rapid. The launch facilities were not transportable and had to be built on site. Once the first generation of ICBMs based in the US became operational, Thor missiles were quickly retired. The last of the missiles was withdrawn from operational alert in 1963. A small number of Thors with \\"Thrust Augmented Delta\\" boosters and W-49 Mod 6 warheads remained operational in the anti-satellite missile role as Program 437 until April 1975. These missiles were based on Johnston Island in the Pacific Ocean and had the ability to destroy satellites in low Earth orbit. With prior warning of an impending launch, they could destroy a Soviet spy satellite soon after orbital insertion. =Initial development= Thor-Able at the Air Force Space & Missile Museum Development of the Thor was initiated by the USAF in 1954. The goal was a missile system that could deliver a nuclear warhead over a distance of with a CEP of . This range would allow Moscow to be attacked from a launch site in the UK. The initial design studies were headed by Cmdr. Robert Truax (US Navy) and Dr. Adolph K. Thiel (Ramo-Wooldridge Corporation, formerly of Redstone Arsenal). They refined the specifications to an IRBM with: * A range * diameter, long (so it could be carried by Douglas C-124 Globemaster) * A gross takeoff weight of * Propulsion provided by half of the existing Navaho- derived Atlas booster engine * maximum speed during warhead reentry * Inertial guidance system with radio backup (for low susceptibility to enemy disruption) Thor had vernier engines for roll control flanking the main engine, similar to the Atlas vernier engines on the sides of the propellant tanks. On 30 November 1955, three companies were given one week to bid on the project: Douglas, Lockheed, and North American Aviation. The missile was to use existing technology, skills, abilities, and techniques to speed entry into service. On 27 December 1955, Douglas was awarded the prime contract for the airframe and integration. The Rocketdyne division of North American Aviation was awarded the engine contract, AC Spark Plug the primary inertial guidance system, Bell Labs the backup radio guidance system, and General Electric the nose cone/reentry vehicle. Douglas' proposal included choosing bolted tank bulkheads (as opposed to the initially suggested welded ones) and a tapered fuel tank for improved aerodynamics. The engine was a direct descendant of the Atlas MA-3 booster engine, with removal of one thrust chamber and a rerouting of the plumbing to allow the engine to fit within the smaller Thor thrust section. Engine component tests began in March 1956. The first engineering model engine was available in June, followed by the first flight engine in September. Early Thor engines suffered from foaming turbopump lubricating oil at high altitudes and bearing retention issues, resulting in several launch failures. The initial Thor tests in 1957 used an early version of the Rocketdyne LR-79 engine with a conical thrust chamber and 135,000 pounds of thrust. By early 1958, this had been replaced by an improved model with a bell-shaped thrust chamber and 150,000 pounds of thrust. The fully developed Thor IRBM had 162,000 pounds of thrust. =Phase I test launches= Thor was test launched from LC-17 at Cape Canaveral Missile Annex. The compressed development schedule meant that plans for the Atlas bunker had to be used to allow the completion of the facility in time, with launchpad LC-17B completed just in time for the first test flight. Missile 101, the first flight-ready Thor, arrived at Cape Canaveral in October 1956. It was erected at LC-17B and underwent several practice propellant loading/unloading exercises, a static firing test, and a month-long delay while a defective relay was replaced. Launch finally took place on 25 January 1957. The engine lost thrust almost immediately after liftoff, and the Thor fell onto the launch pad and exploded. A film of prelaunch preparations showed crews dragging a LOX filler hose through a sandy area, and it was that debris had entered the LOX, causing the failure of a valve. Thor 102 was launched on 20 April. The booster performed normally, but the flight was terminated at 35 seconds after an erroneous console readout caused the Range Safety Officer to believe that the missile was headed inland instead of out to sea. The tracking console was found to be wired in reverse. The short flight raised confidence that Thor could fly successfully. The third Thor launch (Missile 103) exploded four minutes before the planned launch after a defective valve allowed LOX tank pressure to build up to unsafe levels. The responsible technicians had also failed to pay attention to the tank pressure gauges. LC-17B consequently had to be repaired for the second time in four months. Missile 104, launched 22 August from the newly opened LC-17A, broke up at T+92 seconds due to a drop in signal strength from the programmer, causing the engine to gimbal hard right. The guidance system tried to compensate, but the resulting structural loads exceeded the strength of the missile tankage. Thor 105 (20 September) completed the first successful flight, which occurred 21 months after the start of the program. No telemetry equipment was included on this missile, with the resulting mass savings allowing a total range of . Missile 107 (3 October) fell back onto LC-17A and exploded at launch when a gas generator valve failed to open. Missile 108 (11 October) exploded around T+140 seconds without prior warning. Engineers were initially unable to determine the cause of the failure. After the first Thor-Able launch failed six months later due to a seized turbopump, it was concluded that a similar failure had occurred on 108. However, 108 did not have sufficient instrumentation to determine the exact nature of the failure. The final three Thor tests during 1957 were all successful. 1958 began with back-to-back failures. Thor 114 was destroyed by Range Safety 150 seconds into launch when the guidance system lost power and Thor 120's engine shut down slightly under two minutes after liftoff. The telemetry system had experienced a power failure during launch, so the reason for the engine cutoff could not be satisfactorily determined. On 19 April, Missile 121 dropped back onto LC-17B and exploded, putting the pad out of action for three months. A fuel duct collapse was believed to have been the culprit. On 22 April, Missile 117, carrying the first Able upper stage, lost thrust and broke up at T+146 seconds due to a turbopump failure. The Jupiter, Thor, and Atlas missiles all used a variant of the Rocketdyne LR-79 engine and all three suffered launch failures due to a marginal turbopump design. There were two separate problems with the pumps. The first was the discovery during testing at Huntsville that the lubricant oil tended to foam at high altitude as the air pressure decreased. The other was that pump shaft vibration from the nearly 10,000 RPM operating speed would cause the bearings to come out of their sockets, resulting in the pump abruptly seizing up. The Army had suspended Jupiter launches for four months until the turbopump issues could be resolved, and as a result no more pump failures affected that program. In contrast, the USAF's General Schreiver rejected the idea of sending Thor and Atlas missiles back to the factory so as to not delay the testing program. Instead, in-field modifications to pressurize the turbopump gearboxes and use an oil with a different viscosity that was less prone to foaming were conducted. Modified bearing retainers were not installed. Subsequently, six consecutive Thor and Atlas launches failed during February‚ÄìApril 1958, several due to turbopump problems. The following four months did not include any turbopump failures, but the 17 August launch of the world's first lunar probe on Thor-Able 127 ended in an explosion due to a turbopump failure. A month later, Atlas 6B also suffered a turbopump failure and the Air Force gave in and agreed to replace the turbopumps in all of their missiles, after which there were no more launch failures due to a turbopump problem. Five successful Thor tests were conducted in June‚ÄìJuly 1958, the last one carrying a mouse named Wickie on a biological mission; the capsule sank into the ocean and could not be recovered. Thor 126 (26 July) lost thrust 50 seconds into launch when a LOX valve inadvertently closed. The vehicle pitched down and broke up from aerodynamic loads. On 30 July, six Douglas technicians were severely burned, three fatally, when a LOX valve failed at the Thor static test stand in Sacramento, California. =Phase II launches= Missile 151, nicknamed \\"Tune Up\\", on December 16, 1958, just prior to its launch from Vandenberg Air Force Base. The successful test was conducted a year after the base was activated. Phase II testing with the AC Spark Plug inertial guidance system began 7 December with the first successful flight on 19 December 1957.James N. Gibson, Nuclear Weapons of the United States, An Illustrated History, pp. 167‚Äì168, Schiffer Publishing Ltd., Atglen, PA, 1996 The operational variant of the Thor, the DM-18A, began testing in the autumn of 1958, but Missile 138 (5 November) went out of control shortly after liftoff and had to be destroyed. Nonetheless, Thor was declared operational and testing now began at Vandenberg Air Force Base on the West Coast when Missile 151 flew successfully on 16 December. On 30 December, a near repeat performance of the 5 November failure happened when Missile 149 lost control and was destroyed 40 seconds into launch. Thor missile test. Cape Canaveral, May 12, 1959. Johnston Island Launch Emplacement One (LE1) after a Thor missile launch failure and explosion contaminated the island with plutonium during the Operation \\"Bluegill Prime\\" nuclear test, July 1962. The retractable missile shelter (on rails) can be seen at the rear After a run of successful launches during the first half of 1959, Missile 191, the first to be launched by a Royal Air Force crew, suffered another control malfunction while being launched from VAFB. This time, the missile's pitch and roll program failed to activate and it continued flying straight up. Launch crews initially did nothing as they reasoned that the Earth's rotation would gradually take it away from land and they wished to continue collecting data as long as possible. Eventually though, they became nervous about it exploding or pitching over, so the destruct command was sent around 50 seconds into launch. High-altitude wind caused debris to land in the town of Orcutt near the base. After Thor 203 repeated the same failure four weeks later, an investigation found that the culprit was a safety wire that had been meant to prevent the control tape in the programmer from inadvertently coming loose during vehicle assembly. The wire would ordinarily be cut after installation of the programmer in the missile, but Douglas technicians had forgotten this important step, thus the tape could not be spooled and the pitch and roll sequence did not activate. Another 23 Thor missile tests were carried out during 1959, with only one failure, when Missile 185 on 16 December, the second RAF launch, broke up due to a control malfunction. =Service rivalry with Jupiter= The Jupiter missile, a joint effort of Chrysler and the Redstone Arsenal in Huntsville, Alabama, was originally designed to attack high-value targets like airfields, train switching yards and command and control sites with extremely high accuracy. The Redstone team, under the direction of Wernher von Braun, ultimately delivered an inertial guidance system that was accurate to about . During development, the US Navy became involved in the Jupiter program, with the objective of arming submarines with a ballistic missile. This led to the Jupiter's squat shape, which allowed it to be stored within the confines of a submarine hull. However, the Navy was always concerned about the extremely risky situation of a liquid-fueled rocket stored in the confines of a submarine. By 1956, the Polaris program was proposed instead, which featured a solid-fueled SLBM that was much lighter and safer to store. The Navy quickly switched to Polaris and dropped Jupiter. With two IRBMs of nearly identical capabilities, it seemed obvious that only one of the two would ultimately achieve operational status, resulting in a competition between the Army and Air Force. Jupiter's testing program began two months after Thor's and proceeded more smoothly. Accidents such as the explosion of Thor 103 were avoided, and the turbopump issues that plagued early Rocketdyne engines were also resolved in Jupiter much earlier than the Air Force's missiles. The Jupiter program was more successful due to far better testing and preparation, with each missile given a full duration static firing in Huntsville prior to delivery. Thors were given a PFRF (Pre Flight Readiness Firing) prior to launch; these were between 5‚Äì15 seconds only as the launching facilities were not designed for a full duration firing. Missile 107 had not been given a PFRF at all and its launch ended in a pad explosion. A static firing stand for Thor tests was only opened in May 1958, at which point the missile's launch record stood at four successes and nine failures, including four launchpad explosions. For comparison, at the end of May 1958 Jupiter had five successes and three failures with no pad explosions. Thanks to the thorough testing done at Huntsville, Jupiter missiles mostly all arrived at CCAS in flight-ready condition while Thors typically required extensive repairs or modification before launch. After the Soviet launches of Sputnik 1‚Äì2 in late 1957, US Secretary of Defense Charles Wilson announced that both Thor and Jupiter would go into service as his final act before leaving office. This was both out of fear of Soviet capabilities and also to avoid political repercussions from the workplace layoffs that would result at either Douglas or Chrysler if one of the two missiles were canceled. =Deployment= Deployment of the IRBM fleet to Europe proved more difficult than expected, as no NATO members other than the UK accepted the offer to have Thor missiles stationed on their soil. Italy and Turkey both agreed to accept Jupiter missiles. Thor was deployed to the UK starting in August 1958, operated by 20 squadrons of RAF Bomber Command under US-UK dual key control. The first active unit was No. 77 Squadron RAF at RAF Feltwell in 1958, with the remaining units becoming active in 1959. All were deactivated by September 1963. All 60 of the Thor missiles deployed in the UK were based at above- ground launch sites. The missiles were stored horizontally on transporter- erector trailers and covered by a retractable missile shelter. To fire the weapon, the crew used an electric motor to roll back the missile shelter, essentially a long shed mounted on steel rails, then used a powerful hydraulic launcher-erector to lift the missile to an upright position for launch. Once it was standing on the launch mount, the missile was fueled and could be fired. The entire launch sequence, from starting to roll back the missile shelter through to ignition of the rocket engine and lift-off, took approximately 15 minutes. Main engine burn time was almost 2.5 minutes, boosting the missile to a speed of . Ten minutes into its flight the missile reached an altitude of , close to the apogee of its elliptical flight path. At that point the reentry vehicle separated from the missile fuselage and began its descent toward the target. Total flight time from launch to target impact was approximately 18 minutes. The Thor was initially deployed with a very blunt conical G.E. Mk 2 'heat sink' re-entry vehicle. They were later converted to the slender G.E. Mk 3 ablative RV. Both RVs contained a W-49 thermonuclear warhead with an explosive yield of 1.44 megatons. The IRBM program was quickly eclipsed by the Air Force's ICBM program and made redundant. By 1959, with Atlas well on its way to operational status, Thor and Jupiter became obsolete, although both remained in service as missiles until 1963. In retrospect, the IRBM program was a poorly conceived idea as it depended on the cooperation of NATO allies, most of whom were not willing to have nuclear missiles on their soil, and was also surpassed by the ICBM program, yet continued anyway for political reasons and a desire to keep the workforce at their respective assembly plants employed. Thor's lasting legacy was not as a missile, but its use as the basis for the Thor/Delta space launcher family into the 21st century. =Nuclear-armed test flights= * 2 June 1962, failed Bluegill flight, tracking lost after launch, Thor and nuclear device destroyed. * 19 June 1962, failed Starfish flight, Thor and nuclear device destroyed 59 seconds after launch at altitude. * 8 July 1962, Thor missile 195 launched a Mk4 reentry vehicle containing a W49 thermonuclear warhead to an altitude of . The warhead detonated with a yield of 1.45 Mt of TNT (6.07 PJ). This was the Starfish Prime event of nuclear test series Operation Fishbowl. * 25 July 1962, failed Bluegill Prime flight, Thor and nuclear device destroyed on launch pad, which was contaminated with plutonium.Defense Nuclear Agency. Operation Dominic I. 1962. Report DNA 6040F. Page 229-241. Launch vehicle Despite being retired from deployment as a missile a few years after deployment, the Thor rocket found widespread use as a space launch vehicle. It was the first in a large family of space launch vehicles‚Äîthe Delta rockets. The last remaining descendant of the Thor, the Delta II, was retired in 2018, and the Delta IV is based on entirely new technology, unlike the Delta II.

Under the terms of the Act of Settlement 1701, a new monarch succeeds automatically. The proclamation merely confirms by name the identity of the heir who has succeeded. The council is made up of Privy Counsellors, Great Officers of State, members of the House of Lords, the Lord Mayor of the City of London, the aldermen of the City of London, high commissioners of Commonwealth realms, and other civil servants.  Proclamation  The Proclamation Gallery overlooking Friary Court at St James's Palace, where the proclamation is traditionally first read. Royal Exchange building. The council's Proclamation of Accession, which confirms the name of the heir, is signed by all the attendant Privy Counsellors. The proclamation is traditionally read out at several locations in London, Edinburgh, Windsor, and York. It may also be read at a central location in a town or village. The most recent proclamation was as follows: Though proclamations have been worded broadly the same, they also vary as necessary. In the case of Victoria, certain words were included (having regard to section 2 of the Regency Act 1830 prescribing the Oath of Allegiance) which expressly reserved the rights of any child of the late king, William IV, which might be borne to his widow, Adelaide of Saxe- Meiningen. In the case of George VI, the proclamation was reworded because Edward VIII had abdicated, rather than died, and \\"Emperor of India\\" was added at the end of the list of titles until that title was relinquished by George VI. The proclamation has been ceremonially read out in various locations around the United Kingdom. By custom, it is usually first read from the Friary Court balcony at St James's Palace by the heralds of the College of Arms. The heralds proceed to travel and read it at various points in London (including Trafalgar Square, and the original site of Temple Bar on Fleet Street) until they reach the Royal Exchange where it is read in the presence of the Lord Mayor of London and other officials. Likewise, the heralds of the Court of the Lord Lyon also publicly read the proclamation from Mercat Cross in Edinburgh.  Oaths  Under the Acts of Union 1707, monarchs are required upon succeeding to the throne to make an oath to \\"maintain and preserve\\" the Church of Scotland. This oath is normally made at the Accession Council. The provision in Article XXV Section II of the Acts of Union 1707 states with respect to confirmed Acts of Scotland: Once the monarch makes a sacred oath to the council, the Garter King of Arms steps onto the Proclamation Gallery which overlooks Friary Court to announce the new monarch. Queen Elizabeth II was in Kenya when she acceded to the throne, and the Accession Council therefore met twice, first for the proclamation and again so that the new Queen could take the oath.. Upon accession, a new sovereign is also required to make what is known as the Accession Declaration. This is not usually made at a meeting of the Accession Council but in the presence of Parliament on the first State Opening following the monarch's accession to the throne or at his coronation, whichever occurs first. King George VI made the declaration at his coronation.House of Commons Research Briefings: The Coronation Oath. see: In addition to the above oath and declaration, should a monarch have a coronation, he or she makes a Coronation Oath which contains references to the Church of England.  The King is dead. Long live the King!  While \\"The King is dead. Long live the King\\" is commonly believed to be part of the official text of the Proclamation of Accession read out following the decision of the Accession Council as to the rightful heir to the throne, it is in fact only tradition that causes it to be recited immediately after the proclamation is read aloud in many villages and towns.

Often it is a list of operations (actions) ordered by time, performed by a set of transactions that are executed together in the system. If the order in time between certain operations is not determined by the system, then a partial order is used. Examples of such operations are requesting a read operation, reading, writing, aborting, committing, requesting a lock, locking, etc. Not all transaction operation types should be included in a schedule, and typically only selected operation types (e.g., data access operations) are included, as needed to reason about and describe certain phenomena. Schedules and schedule properties are fundamental concepts in database concurrency control theory. Formal description The following is an example of a schedule: ;D In this example, the horizontal axis represents the different transactions in the schedule D. The vertical axis represents time order of operations. Schedule D consists of three transactions T1, T2, T3. The schedule describes the actions of the transactions as seen by the DBMS. First T1 Reads and Writes to object X, and then Commits. Then T2 Reads and Writes to object Y and Commits, and finally, T3 Reads and Writes to object Z and Commits. This is an example of a serial schedule, i.e., sequential with no overlap in time because the actions of all three transactions are sequential, and the transactions are not interleaved in time. Representing the schedule D above by a table (rather than a list) is just for the convenience of identifying each transaction's operations in a glance. This notation is used throughout the article below. A more common way in the technical literature for representing such schedule is by a list: :::D = R1(X) W1(X) Com1 R2(Y) W2(Y) Com2 R3(Z) W3(Z) Com3 Usually, for the purpose of reasoning about concurrency control in databases, an operation is modelled as atomic, occurring at a point in time, without duration. When this is not satisfactory, start and end time-points and possibly other point events are specified (rarely). Real executed operations always have some duration and specified respective times of occurrence of events within them (e.g., \\"exact\\" times of beginning and completion), but for concurrency control reasoning usually only the precedence in time of the whole operations (without looking into the quite complex details of each operation) matters, i.e., which operation is before, or after another operation. Furthermore, in many cases, the before/after relationships between two specific operations do not matter and should not be specified, while being specified for other pairs of operations. In general, operations of transactions in a schedule can interleave (i.e., transactions can be executed concurrently), while time orders between operations in each transaction remain unchanged as implied by the transaction's program. Since not always time orders between all operations of all transactions matter and need to be specified, a schedule is, in general, a partial order between operations rather than a total order (where order for each pair is determined, as in a list of operations). Also in the general case, each transaction may consist of several processes, and itself be properly represented by a partial order of operations, rather than a total order. Thus, in general, a schedule is a partial order of operations, containing (embedding) the partial orders of all its transactions. Time-order between two operations can be represented by an ordered pair of these operations (e.g., the existence of a pair (OP1, OP2) means that OP1 is always before OP2), and a schedule in the general case is a set of such ordered pairs. Such a set, a schedule, is a partial order which can be represented by an acyclic directed graph (or directed acyclic graph, DAG) with operations as nodes and time-order as a directed edge (no cycles are allowed since a cycle means that a first (any) operation on a cycle can be both before and after (any) another second operation on the cycle, which contradicts our perception of Time). In many cases, a graphical representation of such a graph is used to demonstrate a schedule. Comment: Since a list of operations (and the table notation used in this article) always represents a total order between operations, schedules that are not a total order cannot be represented by a list (but always can be represented by a DAG). Types of schedule =Serial= The transactions are executed non-interleaved (see example above) i.e., a serial schedule is one in which no transaction starts until a running transaction has ended. =Serializable= A schedule that is equivalent (in its outcome) to a serial schedule has the serializability property. In schedule E, the order in which the actions of the transactions are executed is not the same as in D, but in the end, E gives the same result as D. ;E Conflicting actions Two actions are said to be in conflict (conflicting pair) if: # The actions belong to different transactions. # At least one of the actions is a write operation. # The actions access the same object (read or write). The following set of actions is conflicting: * R1(X), W2(X), W3(X) (3 conflicting pairs) While the following sets of actions are not: * R1(X), R2(X), R3(X) * R1(X), W2(Y), R3(X) Conflict equivalence The schedules S1 and S2 are said to be conflict-equivalent if the following two conditions are satisfied: # Both schedules S1 and S2 involve the same set of transactions (including the ordering of actions within each transaction). # Both schedules have the same set of conflicting operations. Conflict- serializable A schedule is said to be conflict-serializable when the schedule is conflict-equivalent to one or more serial schedules. Another definition for conflict-serializability is that a schedule is conflict- serializable if and only if its precedence graph/serializability graph, when only committed transactions are considered, is acyclic (if the graph is defined to include also uncommitted transactions, then cycles involving uncommitted transactions may occur without conflict serializability violation). ;G Which is conflict-equivalent to the serial schedule , but not . Commitment-ordered A schedule is said to be commitment-ordered (commit-ordered), or commitment-order-serializable, if it obeys the Commitment ordering (CO; also commit-ordering or commit-order-serializability) schedule property. This means that the order in time of transactions' commitment events is compatible with the precedence (partial) order of the respective transactions, as induced by their schedule's acyclic precedence graph (serializability graph, conflict graph). This implies that it is also conflict-serializable. The CO property is especially effective for achieving Global serializability in distributed systems. Comment: Commitment ordering, which was discovered in 1990, is obviously not mentioned in (Bernstein et al. 1987). Its correct definition appears in (Weikum and Vossen 2001), however the description thereof its related techniques and theory is partial, inaccurate, and misleading. For an extensive coverage of commitment ordering and its sources see Commitment ordering and The History of Commitment Ordering. View equivalence Two schedules S1 and S2 are said to be view- equivalent when the following conditions are satisfied: # If the transaction T_i in S1 reads an initial value for object X, so does the transaction T_i in S2. # If the transaction T_i in S1 reads the value written by transaction T_j in S1 for object X, so does the transaction T_i in S2. # If the transaction T_i in S1 is the final transaction to write the value for an object X, so is the transaction T_i in S2. View-serializable A schedule is said to be view-serializable if it is view-equivalent to some serial schedule. Note that by definition, all conflict-serializable schedules are view-serializable. ;G Notice that the above example (which is the same as the example in the discussion of conflict-serializable) is both view-serializable and conflict- serializable at the same time. There are however view-serializable schedules that are not conflict-serializable: those schedules with a transaction performing a blind write: ;H The above example is not conflict-serializable, but it is view-serializable since it has a view-equivalent serial schedule . Since determining whether a schedule is view-serializable is NP-complete, view-serializability has little practical interest. =Recoverable= Transactions commit only after all transactions whose changes they read, commit. ;F These schedules are recoverable. F is recoverable because T1 commits before T2, that makes the value read by T2 correct. Then T2 can commit itself. In F2, if T1 aborted, T2 has to abort because the value of A it read is incorrect. In both cases, the database is left in a consistent state. Unrecoverable If a transaction T1 aborts, and a transaction T2 commits, but T2 relied on T1, we have an unrecoverable schedule. ;G In this example, G is unrecoverable, because T2 read the value of A written by T1, and committed. T1 later aborted, therefore the value read by T2 is wrong, but since T2 committed, this schedule is unrecoverable. Cascadeless Also \\"Avoiding Cascading Aborts (ACA)\\". Avoids that a single transaction abort leads to a series of transaction rollbacks. A strategy to prevent cascading aborts is to disallow a transaction from reading uncommitted changes from another transaction in the same schedule. The following examples are the same as the ones in the discussion on recoverable: ;F In this example, although F2 is recoverable, it does not avoid cascading aborts. It can be seen that if T1 aborts, T2 will have to be aborted too in order to maintain the correctness of the schedule as T2 has already read the uncommitted value written by T1. The following is a recoverable schedule which avoids cascading abort. Note, however, that the update of A by T1 is always lost (since T1 is aborted). ;F3 Note that this Schedule would not be serializable if T1 would be committed. Cascading aborts avoidance is sufficient but not necessary for a schedule to be recoverable. Strict A schedule is strict - has the strictness property - if for any two transactions T1, T2, if a write operation of T1 precedes a conflicting operation of T2 (either read or write), then the commit or abort event of T1 also precedes that conflicting operation of T2. Any strict schedule is cascade-less, but not the converse. Strictness allows efficient recovery of databases from failure. Hierarchical relationship between serializability classes The following expressions illustrate the hierarachical (containment) relationships between serializability and recoverability classes: * Serial ‚äÇ commitment-ordered ‚äÇ conflict-serializable ‚äÇ view-serializable ‚äÇ all schedules * Serial ‚äÇ strict ‚äÇ cascadeless (ACA) ‚äÇ recoverable ‚äÇ all schedules The Venn diagram (below) illustrates the above clauses graphically. Venn diagram for serializability and recoverability classes Practical implementations In practice, most general purpose database systems employ conflict-serializable and recoverable (primarily strict) schedules.

Those items are often estimated by other information included in the project schedule of resource allocation, budget, task duration, and linkages of dependencies and scheduled events. A schedule is commonly used in the project planning and project portfolio management parts of project management. Elements on a schedule may be closely related to the work breakdown structure (WBS) terminal elements, the Statement of work, or a Contract Data Requirements List. Overview In many industries, such as engineering and construction, the development and maintenance of the project schedule is the responsibility of a full-time scheduler or team of schedulers, depending on the size and the scope of the project. The techniques of scheduling are well developedA Brief History of Scheduling (PDF) but inconsistently applied throughout industry. Standardization and promotion of sched best practices are being pursued by the Association for the Advancement of Cost Engineering (AACE), the Project Management Institute (PMI), and the US Government for acquisition and accounting purposes. Project management is not limited to industry; the average person can use it to organize their own life. Some examples are: * Homeowner renovation project * Keeping track of all the family activities * Coaching a team * Planning a vacation * Planning a wedding Some project management software programs provide templates, lists, and example schedules to help their users with creating their schedule.  Methods  Before a project schedule can be created, the schedule maker should have a work breakdown structure (WBS), an effort estimate for each task, and a resource list with availability for each resource. If these components for the schedule are not available, they can be created with a consensus-driven estimation method like Wideband Delphi. The reason for this is that a schedule itself is an estimate: each date in the schedule is estimated, and if those dates do not have the buy-in of the people who are going to do the work, the schedule will be inaccurate.Stallman, Greene, Applied Software Project Management O'Reilly press, Nov 2005 To develop a project schedule, the following needs to be completed: * Project scope * Sequence of activities * Tasks grouped into 5 project phases (conception, definition & planning, launch, performance, close) * Task dependencies map * Critical path analysis * Project milestones In order for a project schedule to be healthy, the following criteria must be met:Cutting, Thomas, Cultivating a Healthy Project Schedule, PM Hut (Last accessed 8 November 2009). * The schedule must be constantly (weekly works best) updated. * The EAC (Estimation at Completion) value must be equal to the baseline value. * The remaining effort must be appropriately distributed among team members (taking vacations into consideration). The schedule structure may closely follow and include citations to the index of work breakdown structure or deliverables, using decomposition or templates to describe the activities needed to produce the deliverables defined in the WBS. A schedule may be assessed for the quality of the schedule development and the quality of the schedule management.

Life Blainville was born at Arques, near Dieppe. As a young man he went to Paris to study art, but ultimately devoted himself to natural history. He attracted the attention of Georges Cuvier, for whom he occasionally substituted as lecturer at the Coll√®ge de France and at the Athenaeum Club, London. In 1812 he was aided by Cuvier in acquiring the position of assistant professor of anatomy and zoology in the Faculty of Sciences at Paris. Eventually, relations between the two men soured, a situation that ended in open enmity. In 1825 Blainville was admitted a member of the French Academy of Sciences; and in 1830 he was appointed to succeed Jean-Baptiste Lamarck in the chair of natural history at the museum. Two years later, on the death of Cuvier, he obtained the chair of comparative anatomy, of which he proved himself a worthy successor to his former teacher. In 1837, he was elected a foreign member of the Royal Swedish Academy of Sciences. On May 1, 1850, he died from an attack of apoplexy in a railway carriage at the Embarcad√®re du Havre (current Gare Saint-Lazare) in Paris.Du jardin au Mus√©um en 516 biographies / Philippe Jaussaud; Edouard-Raoul Brygoo .- Paris : Mus√©um national d'histoire naturelle, 2004 .- pp. 169-170 (Archives) He was the taxonomic authority of numerous zoological species, extinct and extant; including the eponymous Blainville's beaked whale, Mesoplodon densirostris.

He is known for helping Stalin come to power, for his role in organizing, planning and supervising the forced collectivization policies said to have led to the Holodomor, and for his harsh treatment and execution of those deemed threats to Stalin's regime. He was project manager and led the original design team of the Moscow Metro, and Moscow's Metro was named after him until 1955.Metro.ru Original order on naming the Metro after Kaganovich. Retrieved 19 October 2007 At his death in 1991, he was the last surviving Old Bolshevik. The Soviet Union itself outlived him by a mere five months before it finally disintegrated. Early life Kaganovich was born in 1893 to Jewish parents Compare: in the village of Kabany, Radomyshl uyezd, Kyiv Governorate, Russian Empire (now named Dibrova, Poliske Raion, Kyiv Oblast, Ukraine). Around 1911, he joined the Bolshevik party (his older brother Mikhail Kaganovich had become a member in 1905). Early in his political career, in 1915, Kaganovich became a Communist organizer at a shoe factory where he worked. During the same year he was arrested and sent back to Kabany. Revolution and Civil War During March and April 1917, he served as the Chairman of the Tanners Union and as the vice-chairman of the Yuzovka Soviet. In May 1917, he became the leader of the military organization of Bolsheviks in Saratov, and in August 1917, he became the leader of the Polessky Committee of the Bolshevik party in Belarus. During the October Revolution of 1917 he led the revolt in Gomel. In 1918 Kaganovich acted as Commissar of the propaganda department of the Red Army. From May 1918 to August 1919 he was the Chairman of the Ispolkom (Committee) of the Nizhny Novgorod gubernia. In 1919‚Äì1920, he served as governor of the Voronezh gubernia. The years 1920 to 1922 he spent in Turkmenistan as one of the leaders of the Bolshevik struggle against local Muslim rebels (basmachi), and also commanding the succeeding punitive expeditions against local opposition. Communist functionary In May 1922, Stalin became the General Secretary of the Communist Party and immediately transferred Kaganovich to his apparatus to head the Organizational Bureau or Orgburo of the Secretariat. This department was responsible for all assignments within the apparatus of the Communist Party. Working there, Kaganovich helped to place Stalin's supporters in important jobs within the Communist Party bureaucracy. In this position he became noted for his great work capacity and for his personal loyalty to Stalin. He stated publicly that he would execute absolutely any order from Stalin, which at that time was a novelty. Lazar Kaganovich's speech. Kharkov, Ukraine, 1927. In 1924, Kaganovich became a full member of the Central Committee, after having first been elected as a candidate one year earlier. From 1925 to 1928, Kaganovich was the First Secretary of the Communist Party of the Ukrainian SSR. He was given the task of \\"ukrainizatsiya\\" ‚Äì meaning at that time the building up of Ukrainian communist popular cadres. He also had the duty of implementing collectivization and the policy of economic suppression of the kulaks (wealthier peasants). He opposed the more moderate policy of Nikolai Bukharin, who argued in favor of the \\"peaceful integration of kulaks into socialism\\". In 1928, due to numerous protests against Kaganovich's management, Stalin was forced to transfer Kaganovich from Ukraine to Moscow, where he returned to his position as a Secretary of the Central Committee of the Communist Party, a job he held until 1939. As Secretary, he endorsed Stalin's struggle against the so-called Left and Right Oppositions within the Communist Party, in the hope that Stalin would become the sole leader of the country. In 1933 and 1934, he served as the Chairman of the Commission for the Vetting of the Party Membership (Tsentralnaya komissiya po proverke partiynykh ryadov) and ensured personally that nobody associated with anti-Stalin opposition would be permitted to remain a Communist Party member. In 1934, at the XVII Congress of the Communist Party, Kaganovich chaired the Counting Committee. He falsified voting for positions in the Central Committee, deleting 290 votes opposing the Stalin candidacy. His actions resulted in Stalin's being re-elected as the General Secretary instead of Sergey Kirov. By the rules, the candidate receiving fewer opposing votes should become the General Secretary. Before Kaganovich's falsification, Stalin received 292 opposing votes and Kirov only three. However, the \\"official\\" result (due to the interference of Kaganovich) saw Stalin with just two opposing votes (Radzinsky, 1996). In 1930, Kaganovich became a member of the Soviet Politburo and the First Secretary of the Moscow Obkom of the Communist Party (1930‚Äì1935). He later headed the Moscow Gorkom of the Communist Party (1931‚Äì1934). He also supervised the implementation of many of Stalin's economic policies, including the collectivization of agriculture and rapid industrialization. During this period, he also supervised the destruction of many of the city's oldest monuments, including the Cathedral of Christ the Saviour.Rees, Edward Afron. 1994. Stalinism and Soviet Rail Transport, 1928‚Äì41. Birmingham: Palgrave Macmillan In 1932, he led the suppression of the workers' strike in Ivanovo-Voznesensk.  Moscow Metro  On June 15, 1931, at the Plenum of the Central Committee of the All-Union Communist Party of Bolsheviks, after a report by the first secretary of the Moscow City Party Committee, Lazar Kaganovich, a decision was made to build the Moscow metro to improve the transport situation in the city and partially relieve tram lines. In the 1930s, Kaganovich - along with project managers Ivan Kuznetsov and, later - Isaac Segal, organized and led the building of the first Soviet underground rapid-transport system, the Moscow Metro, known as Metropoliten imeni L.M. Kaganovicha after him until 1955. On October 15, 1941, L. M. Kaganovich received an order to close the Moscow Metro, and within 3 hours to prepare proposals for its destruction, as a strategically important object. The metro was supposed to be destroyed, and the remaining cars and equipment removed. On the morning of October 16, 1941, on the day of the panic in Moscow, the metro was not opened for the first time. It was the only day in the history of the Moscow metro when it did not work. By evening, the order to destroy the metro was canceled. In 1955, after the death of Stalin, the Moscow Metro was renamed to no longer include Kaganovich's name. Responsibility for 1932‚Äì33 famine Kliment Voroshilov, Lazar Kaganovich, Alexander Kosarev and Vyacheslav Molotov on the 7th Conference of the All-Union Leninist Young Communist League (Komsomol). Jul 1932 Kaganovich (together with Vyacheslav Molotov) participated with the All-Ukrainian Party Conference of 1930 and were given the task of implementation of the collectivization policy that caused a catastrophic 1932‚Äì33 famine (known as the Holodomor in Ukraine). Similar policies also inflicted enormous suffering on the Soviet Central Asian republic of Kazakhstan, the Kuban region, Crimea, the lower Volga region, and other parts of the Soviet Union. As an emissary of the Central Committee of the Communist Party, Kaganovich traveled to Ukraine, the central regions of the USSR, the Northern Caucasus, and Siberia demanding the acceleration of collectivization and repressions against the Kulaks, who were generally blamed for the slow progress of collectivization. Attorney Rafael Lemkin in his work The Soviet Genocide in Ukraine tried to present the fact of Holodomor to the Nuremberg trials as a genocide of a totalitarian regime. On 13 January 2010, Kyiv Appellate Court posthumously found Kaganovich, Postyshev, Kosior, Chubar and other Soviet Communist Party functionaries guilty of genocide against Ukrainians during the catastrophic Holodomor famine.Ukraine court finds Bolsheviks guilty of Holodomor genocide, RIA Novosti (13 January 2010) Yushchenko Praises Guilty Verdict Against Soviet Leaders For Famine, Radio Free Europe/Radio Liberty (14 January 2010) Though they were pronounced guilty as criminals, the case was ended immediately according to paragraph 8 of Article 6 of the Criminal Procedural Code of Ukraine.The Kyiv Court of Appeals named the organizers of Holodomor. by Ya.Muzychenko By New Year's Day, the Security Service of Ukraine had finished pre-court investigation and transferred its materials to the Prosecutor General of Ukraine. The materials consist of over 250 volumes of archive documents (from within Ukraine as well as from abroad), interviews with witnesses, and expert analysis of several institutes of National Academies of Sciences. Oleksandr Medvedko, the Prosecutor General, stated that the material proves that a genocide occurred in Ukraine. \\"Iron Lazar\\" From 1935 to 1937, Kaganovich worked as Narkom (Minister) for the railways. Even before the start of the Great Purges, he organized the arrests of thousands of railway administrators and managers as supposed \\"saboteurs\\". From 1937 to 1939, Kaganovich served as Narkom for Heavy Industry. During 1939-1940, he served as Narkom for the Oil Industry. Each of his assignments was associated with arrests in order to improve discipline and compliance with Stalin's policies. In all Party conferences of the later 1930s, he made speeches demanding increased efforts in the search for and prosecution of \\"foreign spies\\" and \\"saboteurs\\". For his ruthlessness in the execution of Stalin's orders, he was nicknamed \\"Iron Lazar\\". During the period of the Great Terror, starting in 1936, Kaganovich's signature appears on 188 out of 357 documented execution lists. Lazar Kaganovich as People's Commissar for Transport in 1936 One of many who perished during these years was Lazar's brother, Mikhail Kaganovich, who was People's Commissar of the Aviation Industry. On 10 January 1940 Mikhail was demoted to director of aviation plant 124 in Kazan. In February 1941, during the 18th Conference of the Communist Party, Mikhail was warned that if the plant missed its quotas he would be eliminated from the Party. On 1 June 1941 Stalin mentioned to Lazar that he had heard that Mikhail was \\"associating with the right wing\\". Lazar reportedly did not speak in the defence of his brother to Stalin, but did notify him by telephone. The same day Mikhail committed suicide.http://www.hrono.ru/biograf/kaganov_m.html citing K. A. Zalesskiy, Stalin's Empire During his time serving as Railways Commissar, Kaganovich participated in the murder of 36,000 people by signing death lists. Kaganovich had exterminated so many railwaymen that one official called to warn that one line was entirely unmanned. During World War II (known as the Great Patriotic War in the USSR), Kaganovich was Commissar (Member of the Military Council) of the North Caucasian and Transcaucasian Fronts. During 1943-1944, he was again the Narkom for the railways. In 1943, he was presented with the title of Hero of Socialist Labour. From 1944 to 1947, Kaganovich was the Minister for Building Materials. In 1947, he became the First Secretary of the Ukrainian Communist Party. From 1948 to 1952, he served as the Chairman of Gossnab (State Committee for Material-Technical Supply, charged with the primary responsibility for the allocation of producer goods to enterprises, a critical state function in the absence of markets), and from 1952 to 1957, as the First Vice-Premier of the Council of Ministers. He was also the first Chairman of Goskomtrud (State Committee for Labour and Wages, charged with introducing the minimum wage, with other wage policy, and with improving the old-age pension system). Until 1957, Kaganovich was a voting member of the Politburo as well as the Presidium. He was also an early mentor of the eventual First Secretary of the Communist Party Nikita Khrushchev, who first became important as Kaganovich's Moscow City deputy during the 1930s. In 1947, when Khrushchev was dismissed as the Party secretary of Ukraine (he remained in the somewhat lesser \\"chief of government\\" position), Stalin dispatched Kaganovich to replace him until Khrushchev was reinstated later that year. Later life left Kaganovich was a doctrinaire Stalinist, and though he remained a member of the Presidium, he quickly lost influence after Stalin's death in March 1953. In 1957, along with fellow devoted Stalinists as well as other opponents of Khrushchev, Molotov, Dmitri Shepilov and Georgy Malenkov (the so-called Anti-Party Group), he participated in an abortive party coup against his former prot√©g√© Khrushchev, whose criticism of Stalin had become increasingly harsh during the preceding two years. As a result of the unsuccessful coup, Kaganovich was forced to retire from the Presidium and the Central Committee, and was given the job of director of a small potash works in the Urals.Sebag Montefiore, Simon (2004). The Court of the Red Tsar. Phoenix. \\"Postscript\\" In 1961, Kaganovich was completely expelled from the Party and became a pensioner living in Moscow. His grandchildren reported that after his dismissal from the Central Committee, Kaganovich (who had a reputation for his temperamental and allegedly violent nature) never again shouted and became a devoted grandfather.Sebag Montefiore, Simon (2004). The Court of the Red Tsar. Phoenix. p. 668 In 1984, his re-admission to the Party was considered by the Politburo, alongside that of Molotov. During last years of life he played dominoes with fellow pensionersL. M. Kaganovich, Stalwart of Stalin, Dies at 97 and criticized Soviet media attacks on Stalin with words: \\"First, Stalin is disowned, now, little by little, it gets to prosecute socialism, the October Revolution, and in no time they will also want to prosecute Lenin and Marx\\".Parla Kaganovich 'Non siamo dei mostri' Shortly before death he suffered a heart attack.L. M. Kaganovich, Stalwart of Stalin, Dies at 97 Kaganovich survived to the age of 97, dying in 1991, just before the events that resulted in the end of the USSR. He is buried in the famed Novodevichy Cemetery in Moscow.  The Wolf of the Kremlin  Kaganovich and his wife M. Privorotskaya during WW1 In 1987, American journalist Stuart Kahan published a book entitled The Wolf of the Kremlin: The First Biography of L.M. Kaganovich, the Soviet Union's Architect of Fear (William Morrow & Co). In the book, Kahan made a series of claims about Kaganovich's working relationship with Stalin and his activities during the Ukrainian famine, and claimed to be Kaganovich's long- lost nephew. He also claimed to have interviewed Kaganovich personally and stated that Kaganovich admitted to being partially responsible for the death of Stalin in 1953 (supposedly by poisoning). A number of other unusual claims were made as well, including that Stalin was married to a sister of Kaganovich (supposedly named \\"Rosa\\") during the last year of his life and that Kaganovich (who was raised Jewish) was the architect of anti-Jewish pogroms.Kahan, Stuart. The Wolf of the Kremlin: The First Biography of L.M. Kaganovich, the Soviet Union's Architect of Fear (William Morrow & Co, 1987) After The Wolf of the Kremlin was translated into Russian by Progress Publishers, and a chapter from it printed in the Nedelya (Week) newspaper in 1991, remaining members of Kaganovich's family composed the Statement of the Kaganovich Family in response. The statement disputed all of Kahan's claims. Rosa Kaganovich, who the Statement of the Kaganovich Family says was fabricated, was referenced as Stalin's wife in the 1940s and 1950s by Western media including The New York Times, Time and Life.See: * Life ‚Äì July 14, 1941. p. 19: \\"A sister Rosa first lived with Stalin, then after the suicide of his second wife is supposed to have married Stalin\\" * Life ‚Äì March 29, 1943. p. 40: \\"His sister Rosa is supposedly married to Stalin\\" * Time ‚Äì April 18, 1949: \\"Lazar Kaganovich, who is Stalin's brother-in-law\\" * Time ‚Äì July 23, 1951: \\"Lazar Kaganovich, long time politburo member and Stalin's brother-in-law\\" * Life ‚Äì March 16, 1953. p. 22: \\"Kaganovich, the brilliant and energetic Jew, Stalin's brother-in-law\\" * Life ‚Äì April 13, 1953. p. 168: \\"Kaganovich (a member of the Politburo and brother of Stalin's third wife)\\" * Time ‚Äì September 7, 1953: \\"Lazar Kaganovich (Stalin's brother-in-law)\\" * The New York Times ‚Äì November 22, 1953 Kaganovich Decorated: Malenkov's Regime Gives High Honor to Stalin's Brother-in-Law * Time ‚Äì February 7, 1955 ‚Äì \\"Lazar M.

The book tells the story of the death of Stalin's second wife Nadezhda (Nadya) as witnessed by Natalia Trushina, who was employed as a housekeeper in Stalin's home, and who in 1937, Elizabeth Lermolo shared an NKVD prison cell with. Rosa (Roza) Kaganovich, with whom Stalin was having an affair, was whom Stalin and his wife were arguing about before she died. This book alleges Stalin struck Nadya a fatal blow with his revolver. Robert Payne mentioned Rosa in a 1965 biography of Stalin, where he said: \\"At such parties he was always inclined to drink dangerously. Something said by Nadezhda ‚Äì it may have been about another woman, Rosa Kaganovich, who was also present, or about the expropriations in the villages which were dooming the peasants to famine - reduced Stalin to a state of imbecile rage. In front of her friends he poured out a torrent of abuse and obscenity. He was a master of the art of cursing, with an astonishing range of vile phrases and that peculiarly.\\" (The Rise and Fall of Stalin, p. 410) Harford Montgomery Hyde also wrote about Rosa in his 1982 biography of Stalin: \\"However, it has been established that after the birth of their second child Svetlana, Stalin ceased to share his wife's bed and moved into a small bedroom beside the dining room of the Kremlin apartment. It has also been stated that, after the Georgian singer's departure for Afghanistan, the woman who was the chief cause of their difference was another dark-eyed beauty, the brunette Rosa Kaganovich, sister of the commissar Lazar, with whom Molotov had previously had an affair. At all events, by 1931 Nadya was thoroughly disillusioned with her husband and most unhappy.\\" (Stalin: The History of a Dictator, p. 260) Miscellaneous Kaganovich is responsible for the use of the \\"eggs and omelette\\" metaphor in reference to the Great Terror (\\"Why wail over broken eggs when we are trying to make an omelette!\\"), a usage commonly attributed to Stalin himself.\\"RUSSIA: Stalin's Omelette\\" Time October 24, 1932 The expression was used in France as early as 1742, and then more famously in 1796 in reference to a French Royalist populist counter-revolution in the Vend√©e.

The 1998 recipient of the Nebula Author Emeritus award for lifetime achievement, Bond was a pioneer in early science fiction and fantasy. His published fiction is mainly short stories, most of which appeared in pulp magazines in the 1930s and 1940s. Many were published in Blue Book magazine. He is noted for his \\"Lancelot Biggs\\" series of stories and for his \\"Meg the Priestess\\" tales, which introduced one of the first powerful female characters in science fiction. Early life Bond's parents, Richard Slade Bond and Mary Bond, were from Nova Scotia, but moved to Scranton, Pennsylvania shortly before his birth in that city. The family later relocated to Philadelphia after World War I. In high school, Bond reviewed plays for The Philadelphia Inquirer. He worked for an insurance company during the Great Depression before enrolling in a college. He attended Marshall College in Huntington, West Virginia from 1932 to 1934. While at Marshall, he contributed to the Huntington Herald Advertiser and edited the college newspaper, The Parthenon. He met his future wife, Betty Gough Folsom, while at Marshall, and they married in 1934.Ruber, Peter. Pulp Rack: \\"Nelson S. Bond, Master Pulpster\\" (expansion of profile in Arkham's Masters of Horror anthology). After graduating, Bond briefly worked for his father's public relations agency. Shortly after joining, he was offered the position of public relations field director for the province of Nova Scotia. This involved meeting celebrities visiting the province and writing pieces about them that were placed in various periodicals. He started selling fiction when he realised he could make more money by writing, sending works to newspapers, pulp magazines and the more upmarket \\"slick\\" magazines. He started by writing sports stories but made his first significant sale with \\"Mr. Mergenthwerker's Lobblies\\", which was published in Scribner's Magazine in 1937. His first science fiction story was \\"Down the Dimensions\\" in the April 1937 issue of Astounding.Webster, Bud. \\"Past Masters - Nelson Bond,\\" Helix SF He only wrote occasional non-fiction once he was established as an author of fiction. Bond wrote and sold more for Blue Book than the pulps, which was not only more prestigious but paid more for his work. He also published articles on philately and served on the Board of Governors / Board of Directors of the British North America Philatelic Society.British North America Philatelic Society Radio and television Bond wrote for such radio programs as Dr. Christian, Hot Copy (1941‚Äì44) and The Sheriff (1944‚Äì51), a continuation of Death Valley Days. Bond also scripted for numerous television anthology programs, such as Lux Video Theatre, Studio One, General Motors Theatre and Tales of Tomorrow. \\"Mr. Mergenthwirker's Lobblies\\" was adapted to radio at least a half-dozen times and also ran as a 1938 radio series. After Bond scripted the story as a teleplay, it became the first full-length play presented on network television. It was televised three times - on Broadway Previews (1946), The Philco Television Playhouse (1949) and the Kraft Television Theatre (1953). For Locus Bond described his experiences in radio and TV: > I began writing for radio after they started adapting some of my stories. I > thought, \\"Well, hell, I can do better than that,\\" and I started adapting > them myself. After a while, a couple of series opened up, and they asked me > to become the writer.

He later became a noted antiquarian bookseller. Bond retired from writing in the late 1950s. After encouragement from fans and professionals, notably Harlan Ellison, he published a new story in 1995. Bond had an extensive correspondence with James Branch Cabell and after Cabell's death was his literary executor for a while. In 1998 the Science Fiction and Fantasy Writers of America made Bond an Author Emeritus. In 2002 Bond donated his personal papers to the Marshall University library, which created a replica of his home office. Bond died of complications from heart problems on November 4, 2006.

Before 2 November 1939, the Reichsgau was called Reichsgau West Prussia. Though the name resembled that of the pre-1920 Prussian province of West Prussia, the territory was not identical. Unlike the former Prussian province, the Reichsgau included the Bromberg (Bydgoszcz) region in the south and lacked the Deutsch-Krone (Wa≈Çcz) region in the west. The province's capital was Danzig (Gda≈Ñsk), and its population without the city was (in 1939) 1,487,452. The province's area was 26,056 km2, 21,237 km2 of which was annexed Danzig and Pomerelian territory.Piotr Eberhardt, Jan Owsinski, Ethnic Groups and Population Changes in Twentieth-century Central-Eastern Europe: History, Data, Analysis, M.E. Sharpe, 2003, p.170, During the Reichsgau's short existence, Poles and Jews in that area were subjected by Nazi Germany to extermination as \\"subhumans\\". History The Prussian province West Prussia created from Polish territory annexed by Prussia in Partitions of Poland was dissolved in 1920, following the Treaty of Versailles. The bulk of it inhabited by Polish majority became part of the newly established Second Republic of Poland and was administered as Pomeranian Voivodship (Polish Corridor). The eastern remains of German West Prussia were attached to the Province of East Prussia as Regierungsbezirk West Prussia - a Regierungsbezirk (\\"government region\\") being a German administrative subunit of a province (Provinz) comprising several counties (Kreise). The western remains of German West Prussia were merged to the German remains of the former Province of Posen and made a new province, Posen-West Prussia. After the Nazis came to power in Germany, they reformed the administrative system by transforming the former German provinces and states into their Gau system in 1935 as a part of their Gleichschaltung policy. In 1938, German Posen-West Prussia was dissolved and its former West Prussian territory was attached to the German Pomeranian Gau. Also in 1938, the Polish Pomeranian Voivodship was expanded southward to comprise the Bydgoszcz region. The resulting enlarged Pomeranian voivodship was called Greater Pomeranian Voivodship (Wielkopomorskie). When Nazi Germany invaded Poland in September 1939, this Greater Pomeranian voivodship was first made the German military district \\"West Prussia\\",Andreas Toppe, Milit√§r und Kriegsv√∂lkerrecht: Rechtsnorm, Fachdiskurs und Kriegspraxis in Deutschland 1899-1940, Oldenbourg Wissenschaftsverlag, 2008, p.398, and by a decree\\"Erla√ü des F√ºhrers und Reichskanzlers √ºber die Gliederung und Verwaltung der Ostgebiete\\" of Adolf Hitler on 8 October merged with the Free City of Danzig and the East Prussian Regierungsbezirk West Prussia, to form the Reichsgau West Prussia.Andreas Toppe, Milit√§r und Kriegsv√∂lkerrecht: Rechtsnorm, Fachdiskurs und Kriegspraxis in Deutschland 1899-1940, Oldenbourg Wissenschaftsverlag, 2008, p.399, The western remains remained outside and continued to be administered by the German Pomeranian Gau as Regierungsbezirk Grenzmark Posen-West Prussia according to the 1938 reform, while the Bromberg (Bydogoszcz) region stayed with Reichsgau West Prussia and was not attached to Reichsgau Posen, the later \\"Warthegau\\". The designation Reichsgau instead of just Gau indicates that the province primarily consisted of annexed territory. A Gauleiter of a Reichsgau was also titled Reichsstatthalter. Other Reichsgaue were e.g. Reichsgau Wartheland and Reichsgau Sudetenland. Albert Forster, the Gauleiter of Danzig since 1930, was named Gauleiter and Reichsstatthalter on 26 October 1939. Population The Reichsgau was very heterogenous, like the territory, which comprised territory of the pre-war Danzig (completely), of Germany (West Prussia Government Region) and of Poland (roughly the Pomeranian Voivodeship), the population amounted to 2,179,000 altogether, with 1,494,000 Polish citizens of mostly Polish ethnicity, 408,000 Danzig citizens of mostly German ethnicity and 277,000 German citizens of mostly German ethnicity.Stefan Samerski, ¬´Ein aussichtsloses Unternehmen ‚Äì die ‚ÄûReaktivierung‚Äú Bischof Eduard Graf O'Rourkes 1939¬ª, in: Im Ged√§chtnis der Kirche neu erwachen: Studien zur Geschichte des Christentums in Mittel- und Osteuropa; Festgabe f√ºr Gabriel Adri√°nyi zum 65.

The German occupiers considered the Danzig and Polish citizenships as naught, due to the de facto abolition of these two states. Christian Danzigers and Christian Poles of German ethnicity were granted German citizenship, Jewish Danzigers, and Jewish Poles of which ethnicity so ever were denied the German citizenship. As to Christian Danzigers and Christian Poles of Polish ethnicity the acceptance as citizens was mostly denied, but under certain circumstances granted. =Extermination and expulsion of ethnic Poles and Jews by Nazi Germany= Polish nationals rounded up during the ethnic cleansing of Gdynia, September 1939 Nazi German policy aimed at extermination of Jewish and Polish population.

The local Selbstschutz, under the command of Ludolf von Alvensleben, numbered 17,667 and before their disbandment in October 1939 had killed 4,247 people. Commander of the Selbstschutz Ludolf von Alvensleben told his men on 16 October 1939: Jews did not figure prominently among the victims in West Prussia, as the area's Jewish population was small and most had fled before the Germans arrived.

As the highest degree in the field, it prepares the holder for academic, research, administrative, clinical, or professional positions in educational, civil, private organizations, or public institutions. While it may be referred to as a professional doctorate in some jurisdictions, it should not be confused with other professional doctorates such as MD or JD, as these degrees are commonly undergraduate in nature and function as first-professional degrees. History When research universities were established in the late 19th century in the United States, they primarily awarded doctorates in the sciences and later the arts. By the early 20th century, these universities began to offer doctoral degrees in professional fields. The first professional degrees were awarded in medicine and law. Shortly thereafter, in response to the societal demand for expert practitioners, doctorates began to be awarded in education. The first Doctor of Philosophy (PhD) degree in the field of education was granted at Teachers College, Columbia University in 1893. The first Doctor of Education (EdD) degree was granted at Harvard University in 1921. Henry Holmes, an educator at Harvard College, raised funds to establish the Harvard Graduate School of Education. Holmes saw value in increasing Harvard's role in the professional training of educators and established doctorate of education, or Ed.D., for students who had had a successful teaching experience, possessed a \\"working knowledge of biology, psychology, and the social sciences\\", and who sought a higher position within the school system. The program of study comprised five areas of education plus the study of social theory in education, history of education, and educational psychology. The dissertation served to teach the student to conduct an independent investigation utilizing existing knowledge and producing a \\"constructive result of importance and value\\". The purpose of the Ed.D. was to offer a rigorous course of study that would enhance candidates‚Äô prior knowledge and skills and better prepare them to lead as school practitioners. The EdD degree was then added by Teachers College in 1934. Between 1925 and 1940 many institutions, including the University of California-Berkeley, Stanford University, and the University of Michigan followed the steps of Columbia and Harvard and established schools and colleges of education that offered graduate study and eventually, the two doctoral degrees. Despite this growth, however, these and other schools of education struggled to establish their identity as professional schools and were perpetually engulfed in debate over the purpose of the Ed.D. The history of the Ed.D. throughout the 20th century was one of confusion. In many graduate schools of education it was a practitioner degree, while in others it was consider education's research doctorate. Several factors contributed to the confusion: First, offering two doctoral degrees resulted in constant conflict between the \\"demands of theory and those of practice\\". Second, the advancement of professional training was further complicated as schools of education competed with schools of arts and sciences. Graduate programs in arts and sciences were older and more established. Traditionally arts and science faculty offered doctoral preparation in the form of the Ph.D. Both the school of arts and sciences and its faculty had difficulty relinquishing their expertise in doctoral studies or in acknowledging the need for a professional doctorate degree. Third, from the inception of both doctoral degrees in education, unclear goals and similar programmatic content have confused the degree purposes and plagued professionalization efforts. The EdD currently is awarded in several countries in addition to the United States (see below). Australia In Australia, entry requirements for the EdD are similar to the PhD except that the former requires a number of years professional experience in education or academia. Canada In Canada, the Ed.D. tends to be granted by faculties of education at Universities and is a terminal degree in education. Much like the United States and Great Britain, some universities offer the EdD (Simon Fraser University), while others offer a PhD in education (McGill University, Queen's University, University of Toronto, University of Manitoba, University of New Brunswick), and still others offer both (Ontario Institute for Studies in Education at the University of Toronto, The University of Western Ontario, University of Alberta, University of Calgary, University of British Columbia). Much like the UK, in Canada, the Ed.D. is a full academic doctorate that can only be granted by AUCC-accredited institutions and shares equal parity with a Ph.D. (Education). The dissertation to be completed as part of an Ed.D. program differs only in focus but not in breadth of study, nor academic rigour required. Ed.D. programs in Canadian institutions must include and original contribution to knowledge which must be chaired (supervised) by an accomplished researcher and orally defended (viva) to internal and external examiners. In many cases, the only salient difference between the Ph.D. and Ed.D. relates to the professional field of practice of the candidate as Ed.D. programs often tend to focus on existing pedagogical problems. Within the varying specializations in Education (Adult Learning, Curriculum, Higher Education, Leadership, etc...), there has been some criticism of leadership focused programs, which have begun to mirror less-rigorous Ed.D. programs offered in the United States. This trend has been observed in both Ph.D. leadership programs as well as Ed.D. leadership programs and has raised questions regarding the appropriateness of doctoral- level research training in educational leadership positions. India PhD in education ‚Äî a doctorate in philosophy ‚Äî can be done in any university recognized by U.G.C. If you have cleared NET (Education) exam then you have to choose a Guide enlisted by the university. On other hand if you don't pass NET exam then you have to qualify Exam conducted twice by every university. The NET cleared students of same university are given preference over those not qualified in NET. You have to submit the synopsis within one year of your enrollment as candidate and you must complete coursework from university recognized center followed by written exam. The rules like Non plagiarism and APA formatting are followed strictly. Ireland In Ireland, EdD programs have only recently been introduced. They tend to follow the UK model of initial research modules followed by longer research papers and thesis. Singapore In Singapore, the National Institute of Education (Nanyang Technological University) is the sole university that awards the EdD degree. The EdD programme has the rigour and expectations of a PhD, but with a professional focus. South Africa In South Africa, following a convention of using Latin in academic designations, the doctorate in education is called Doctor Educationis (DEd) and, like other doctoral degrees in that country, it is entirely a research-based qualification. United Kingdom In the United Kingdom, the EdD is a terminal degree that is equivalent in level with the PhD. The EdD thesis may be shorter than that of the PhD, because the focus of the EdD includes coursework, whereas PhD programs of study are focused on undertaking a thesis without coursework. The EdD thesis differs from a PhD thesis only in length and scope but not in quality. As with PhD candidates, all EdD candidates undergo a viva voce examination (comprehensive oral defense of one's thesis/dissertation). The EdD is generally presented as an opportunity to prepare for academic, administrative or specialised positions in education, placing the graduates for promotion and leadership responsibilities, or high-level professional positions in a range of locations in the broad Education industry. Both the EdD and PhD are recognised for the purposes of appointment as a lecturer or professor in universities. In 1991, the Doctor of Education programme at the University of Bristol began and was the first taught doctorate outside of North America. The EdD is delivered through a balance of taught units including research methods, theory, argumentation and evaluation skills as well as a major research thesis that must make an original contribution to knowledge. As with other doctoral candidates, participants of the EdD are encouraged to publish articles and books based on their research. An excellence in doctoral level research is the main aim of the Bristol EdD. At the Institute of Education in London, the EdD \\"is for experienced professionals from education and related fields who would like to extend their professional understanding and develop skills in research, evaluation and high-level reflection on practice\\". Meanwhile, the PhD \\"is intended to enable [students] to produce [their] own thesis and to develop a range of research and other more generic skills.\\" The University of Cambridge's Faculty of Education provides a useful comparison between the PhD and EdD programmes for their particular university. An ESRC-funded report found that there appeared to be little impact of the development of professional knowledge on employment culture for EdD participants, though there was \\"frequently considerable impact for the individuals themselves\\", and many of the EdD students were employed in the public sector. United States In the United States, the EdD tends to be granted by the school of education of universities and is a terminal degree in education. Majors within the EdD may include: counseling, curriculum and instruction/curriculum and teaching, educational administration, education policy, educational psychology, educational technology, higher education, human resource development, language/linguistics, leadership or technology/innovation in instruction. The EdD is recognized for appointment as a professor or lecturer in a university. It may also be recognized as preparation for administrative positions in education and human development field, such as superintendent of schools, human resource director, or principal. From the very beginning, there was a formal division between the EdD and the PhD in education, and the growing popularity of the applied doctorates was met by faculty in the arts and sciences questioning their legitimacy. They argued that practical and vocational aims were inappropriate for doctoral study, which they contended should be focused on producing scholarly research and college professors. The EdD and the colleges of education that granted them continued to face criticism through the 1980s. In 2013, Harvard University, the first institution to award the EdD degree, accepted its last EdD cohort and instead now offers both the Doctor of Philosophy in Education and the Doctor of Educational Leadership (EdLD) degrees. =Comparisons of the EdD to the PhD in education in the United States= There is controversy in the United States regarding the issue of how the EdD degree compares to the PhD in education. In theory, the two degrees are expected to constitute overlapping but distinct categories, where the EdD is a degree that prepares educational practitioners who can solve educational problems using existing knowledge, and the PhD in education is the more theoretical of the two as a traditional social science research degree that prepares students for careers as scholars and academics, often from a particular disciplinary perspective (e.g., sociology of education). In reality, however, distinctions between the two degree programs are generally minimal in both curriculum and dissertation requirements. One study on dissertations submitted between 1950 and 1990 indicated that there were no differences between the two degrees regarding basic versus applied research or the significance of the findings. Nonetheless, that same study indicated that \\"PhD dissertations contained more multivariate statistics, had wider generalizability, and were more prevalent in certain areas of concentration\\", whereas \\"EdD dissertations contained more survey research and were most prevalent in educational administration research.\\" The difference is attributed primarily to which type of degree a particular school offers and if existing research or original research is required in the dissertation. The Carnegie Project on the Education Doctorate (CPED) states that \\"the professional doctorate in education prepares educators for the application of appropriate and specific practices, the generation of new knowledge, and for the stewardship of the profession.\\" To wit, although the CPED describes the EdD as a professional doctorate, it also states that it prepares students for the generation of new knowledge, and this is corroborated by the fact that both the PhD and EdD degrees are considered research doctoral degrees on the Survey of Earned Doctorates, which is a survey conducted by the National Opinion Research Center at the University of Chicago, sponsored by six federal agencies, and solicited, under the National Science Foundation Act, from graduating doctoral students at all accredited institutions.. According to the Survey, a research doctoral degree is \\"oriented toward preparing students to make original contributions to knowledge in a field and typically entail writing a dissertation.\\" Colleges and universities in the United States that offer doctorates in education choose to offer only the Doctor of Education (e.g. Webster Universityhttp://www.webster.edu/doctoral/), only the Doctor of Philosophy in education (e.g., Stanford University), or both (e.g., UCLA, University of Missouri, and University of Pennsylvania). The distinction between the PhD and the EdD in this last group can take different forms. At the University of Illinois, for example, the PhD in education dissertation requires an original contribution to academic knowledge, whereas the EdD dissertation \\"is intended to demonstrate the candidate's ability to relate academic knowledge to the problems of professional practice.\\" At Teachers College, Columbia University the PhD is designed for students who wish specifically to pursue an academic career, whereas the EdD is designed for broader aims including educational administration and policy work. In St. Louis University's Educational Studies program, the EdD requires \\"successful completion of a culminating project dealing with a problem in educational practice\\" and the PhD requires a dissertation and an \\"oral defense of the dissertation proposal and [of] the final dissertation. Most Ed.D., Psy.D. and Ph.D. programs require a dissertation and an oral defense while others have a research project leading to publication as an alternative.\\" Finally, some schools frame the EdD specifically in terms of applied research, such as New York University, The University of Texas at Austin, and the University of California, Berkeley. In addition to educational settings, the EdD degree is designed to address real-world issues including clinical mental health counseling and human resource development. =Criticisms= Lee Shulman, President of the Carnegie Foundation for the Advancement of Teaching, stated that the lack of distinction between the EdD and the PhD has meant the EdD has come to be seen as little more than \\"Ph.D.-lite\\", and the PhD in education has likewise suffered. Moreover, it has resulted in \\"the danger that we achieve rigorous preparation neither for practice nor for research.\\" Arthur Levine, former president of Teachers College, Columbia University, said that the EdD degree is granted to both scholars and administrators and as such makes the degree ambiguously defined, that the programs in educational leadership specifically suffered from low standards, and that \\"There is absolutely no reason why a school leader needs a doctorate.\\" Barbara K. Townsend, Professor of Higher Education and Associate Dean for Research and Development at the University of Missouri at Columbia, suggests the doctorate of education is most frequently sought for vanity purposes and to improve one's status, citing a 2000 survey of California school superintendents in which they identify the greatest value of the EdD as being its \\"symbolic value (credibility and respects a basis for leadership)\\", further adding that there is scant research or evidence to suggest that possession of a doctorate in education improves one's ability to be an effective administrator. =Suggestions for reform= Some scholars in the United States have suggested future reforms for both the EdD and PhD in education by calling for a new doctorate for the professional practice of education, which would be for principals, superintendents, policy coordinators, curriculum specialists, teacher educators, program evaluators, etc.; and the distinction between the PhD in education and the EdD would be analogous to the distinction between the PhD in biomedicine and the MD. This new degree might be called the Professional Practice Doctorate (PPD), or it might retain the old name of EdD but be severed from old associations. Arthur Levine argued that the current EdD should be retooled into a new professional master's degree, parallel in many ways to the Master of Business Administration (MBA). David Imig described reforms to the EdD as including more collaborative work involving the analysis of data collected by others. Rather than generating their own data and hypothesis-testing, as PhD students would, a group of EdD students would analyze a specific pool of data from a number of different angles, each writing an individual dissertation on a specific aspect of the data which, when pooled together with the other dissertations, would combine to offer a comprehensive solution to a real-world problem. The Carnegie Project on the Education Doctorate is currently working with over 80 institutions to collaboratively redesign the EdD and \\"to make it a stronger and more relevant degree for the advanced preparation of school practitioners and clinical faculty, academic leaders and professional staff for the nation‚Äôs schools and colleges and the learning organizations that support them\\". Reforms have already been implemented at some institutions. For example, in 2013 the Harvard University Graduate School of Education enrolled its final EdD cohort. The school now offers the Doctor of Education Leadership (EdLD) and PhD in Education.

Vieillot is the author of the first scientific descriptions and Linnaean names of a number of birds, including species he collected himself in the West Indies and North America and South American species discovered but not formally named by F√©lix de Azara and his translator Sonnini de Manoncourt. At least 26 of the genera erected by Vieillot are still in use. He was among the first ornithologists to study changes in plumage and one of the first to study live birds. Biography Vieillot was born in Yvetot. He represented his family's business interests in Saint-Domingue (Haiti) on Hispaniola, but fled to the United States during the Haitian rebellions that followed the French Revolution. On Buffon's advice, he collected material for the Histoire naturelle des oiseaux de l'Am√©rique Septentrionale, the first two volumes of which were published in France beginning in 1807. Vieillot returned to France for the last time in 1798, where the position created for him at the Bulletin des Lois left him sufficient leisure to continue his natural history studies. Following the death of Jean Baptiste Audebert, Vieillot saw the two parts of the \\"Oiseaux dor√©s\\" through to completion in 1802; his own Histoire naturelle des plus beaux oiseaux chanteurs de la zone torride appeared in 1806. Vieillot's Analyse d'une nouvelle Ornithologie El√©mentaire (1816) set out a new system of ornithological classification, which he applied with slight modifications in his contributions to the Nouveau Dictionnaire d'Histoire Naturelle (1816‚Äì19). In 1820, Vieillot undertook the continuation of the Tableau encyclop√©dique et m√©thodique, commenced by Pierre Joseph Bonnaterre in 1790. He also published an Ornithologie fran√ßaise (1823‚Äì30). Vieillot was granted a government pension in the final year of his life, but died relatively unknown and in poverty. Vieillot is commemorated in the binomials of a number of birds, such as Lybius vieilloti (Vieillot's barbet) and Saurothera vieilloti (the Puerto Rican lizard-cuckoo). Some believe that Leach's Storm-petrel should be named Vieillot's Storm-petrel since he was the first to obtain a specimen of the species and to describe it. He did this in the New Dictionary of Natural History, published in 1817. He described the type location as the shores of Picardy, \\"se tient sur l\\"Ocean.\\" Works * Histoire naturelle des plus beaux oiseaux chanteurs de la zone torride.

The Doctor of Musical Arts (DMA) is a doctoral academic degree in music. The DMA combines advanced studies in an applied area of specialization (usually music performance, music composition, or conducting) with graduate-level academic study in subjects such as music history, music theory, or music pedagogy. The DMA degree usually takes about three to four years of full-time study to complete (in addition to the master's and bachelor's degrees), preparing students to be professional performers, conductors, and composers. As a terminal degree, the DMA qualifies its recipient to work in university, college, and conservatory teaching/research positions. Students seeking doctoral training in musicology or music theory typically enter a PhD program, rather than a DMA program. Terminology The degree is also abbreviated as DMusA or AMusD. For the related degree Doctor of Music, the abbreviation is DM or DMus. For the related degree Doctor of Arts, the abbreviation DA is used. Types =Concentrations= The DMA is widely available in the concentrations of performance (sometimes with a specialization in instrumental or voice pedagogy and/or music literature), composition, conducting, and music education. Some universities awarding doctoral degrees in these areas use the title Doctor of Music (DM or DMus) or Doctor of Arts (DA)The University of Mississippi ‚Äì Department of Music or Doctor in Musical Studies (PhD) instead of DMA. The DMA degree was pioneered by Howard Hanson and the National Association of Schools of Music, who approved the first DMA programs in 1952. Northwestern University, the University of Michigan, and the Eastman School of Music became the first to offer the DMA.Marvin Latimer, \\"The Nation's First D.M.A. in Choral Music,\\" Journal of Historical Research in Music Education, 32.1 (October 2010) Boston University offered its first DMA program in 1955. In 2005, Boston University also expanded into online music education by launching the first online doctoral degree in music, a DMA program (along with a Master of Music program) in music education.As of November 2006 A large number of US institutions offer the DMA degree. The PhD is generally considered to be more research oriented, while other doctorates may place more emphasis on practical applications and/or include a performance component. Such distinctions among degree types are not always so clear-cut, however. For instance, most programs include traditional research training and culminate in a written dissertation, regardless of degree designation. The music education degree can be a DMA or PhD, each comprising similar research-oriented programs. Also, music education PhD programs may include performance-oriented tracks. In composition, one may study for either the DMA or the PhD, depending on the institution. The PhD is the standard doctorate in music theory, musicology, music therapy, and ethnomusicology. =Sacred music= A related program is the Doctor of Sacred Music (DSM), also Sacrae Musica Doctor (SMD), which tends to be awarded by seminaries or university music schools that focus on church music, choral conducting and organ performance. In the past, some seminaries titled the degree Doctor of Church Music (DCM). Only one US institution, Claremont Graduate University still offers the DCM degree, in addition to the more typical DMA. The vast majority of US seminaries have closed their music doctorate programs, but some still offer a Master of Arts or Master of Sacred Music degree. A new program offered at Perkins School of Theology is the Doctor of Pastoral Music (DPM).Perkins School of Theology ‚Äì Doctor of Ministry Program While more theology-based and housed within the Doctor of Ministry (DMin) program, admission to the degree requires applicants to hold a Master of Music (MMus), Master of Sacred Music (MSM), Master of Church Music (MCM), MA in church music or equivalent 48-semester-hour degree recognized by the National Association of Schools of Music. Components DMA students typically complete applied studies, such as lessons or mentoring with a professor or instructor, and take courses within their area of specialization. In many DMA programs, all of the different DMA streams (e.g., performance, composition, conducting) take a common core of music theory and music history courses. Many DMA programs require students to pass a comprehensive exam on their area of specialization and on subjects such as music history and music theory. The last stage of the DMA degree is usually the completion of a thesis, dissertation, or research project and the performance of recitals, usually including at least one lecture-recital. Some programs additionally require a sub-specialization in a cognate area within music, such as music history or performance practice, which contributes to their area of specialization. For example, a student doing a DMA in Baroque violin might do a sub-specialization in Baroque music history or Baroque-era dance. Some institutions permit DMA students to do a sub-specialization in a field outside music that contributes to their professional and academic goals. For example, a student completing a DMA in piano pedagogy may be able to do a sub- specialization in the university's department of psychology (e.g., on the psychology of learning and memory); a student completing a DMA in electronic composition may be permitted to do a sub-specialization in the department of computer engineering (e.g., in computer programming). While teaching experience is not an official part of most DMA programs, most DMA candidates will have the opportunity to work as a teaching assistant or lecturer for undergraduate students during their degree, either as a requirement of their scholarship/assistantship package or as a part-time employee of the university. DMA students can teach in an area related to their DMA program, or, if they have multiple skill areas (e.g., a person with an MMus in piano performance who is doing a DMA in composition), they may teach in another area. Admission requirements To be admitted to a DMA degree program, most institutions require a master's degree, such as a MMus degree or an MA degree in music or an equivalent course of study, usually with a grade average of \\"B+\\" or higher. DMA programs in performance usually require applicants to prepare solo literature that is the equivalent of a graduate recital‚Äîi.e. several advanced pieces from a wide range of styles‚Äîin addition to orchestral excerpts. Admission to doctoral programs in conducting often require a video recording of live rehearsals and performances as a pre-screening element. Composition programs usually require the submission of a portfolio of compositions, including scores and recordings of live performances. Programs in music education generally require two or more years of public school (or similar) teaching experience, and may further require an example of scholarly writing. Newly admitted DMA students are usually required to pass a series of diagnostic tests in music history, theory, and sometimes ear-training to confirm thorough command of essential musical principles gained in prior study. Advanced courses in these areas are not permitted until the tests are passed and/or remedial coursework in deficient area(s) is completed. Often, the knowledge of a second language ‚Äì one of languages of major influence in music history (such as German, French, Italian, Spanish, or Russian) ‚Äì is required to complete the degree. The graduate admissions branch of many US universities require applicants to complete the Graduate Record Examination (GRE), a standardized test of abstract thinking skills in the areas of math, vocabulary, and analytical writing. While the outcome of the GRE test may affect an applicant's eligibility for some university-wide scholarships, it does not always affect admission to the music program of the university.  Brief history  After World War II, there was a sharp rise in music education at the university level. As was the case with many occupations, the music world was experiencing an unprecedented number of discharged musicians from the US Armed Forces. The GI Bill was an impetus for many opting for college, causing a spike in demand for college professors, across all disciplines, and a spike in enrollment. In music education, universities had an opportunity to employ formidable musicians, but many, including those of international rank, lacked a terminal academic degree that would put them on equal footing with professors. Post‚ÄìWorld War II also a period of rise the quality of comprehensive music education at universities. The nation's renowned conservatories, such as Juilliard and Curtis, at the time, saw no need for the degree ‚Äì yet many alumni of those institutions, and many top musicians with no degree were the very people being sought by universities offering degrees in music and music education. In 1952, after six years of deliberation, the National Association of Schools of Music (NASM) approved thirty-two schools for graduate degrees for graduate work \\"in one or more of the fields into which graduate music study has been divided.\\" The NASM was, and still is, the only accrediting agency for music schools recognized by the American Council on Education. In 1952, 143 music schools had already established standards for undergraduate degrees.\\"NTSTC One of 32 Colleges for Graduate Study in Music\\", The Dallas Morning News, December 31, 1942, Sec I, p. 6 The national launch of DMA by institutions meeting criteria was 1953. * Eastman School of Music (the DMA degree was approved by the State of New York Board of Regents in 1953) * Boston University * University of Southern California The Director of the University of Rochester Eastman School of Music, Howard Hanson (1896‚Äì1981), who had been awarded an honorary doctorate in 1925, was one of several high- profile advocates of creating a performance oriented doctors degree.

This recommendation included that schools desiring to offer this degree seek the Graduate Commission's approval. In 1953, he published a proposal for a Doctor of Musical Arts degree, which was roundly criticized by Paul Henry Lang, professor of musicology at Columbia University.\\"New Degrees to Musicians ‚Äì Dissenters Claim Title Not Necessary\\", Omaha World-Herald, November 15, 1953, p. 9F Early Doctor of Musical Arts degrees conferred * 1954: Mathias \\"Matt\\" Higgins Doran (born 1921), University of Southern California * 1955: Will Gay Bottje (born 1925), Eastman School of Music ‚Äì some sources attribute Bottje as having been the first in the nation to earn the degreeHoward Hanson: In Theory and Practice, by Allen Laurence Cohen, p. 14, Praeger (2004) * August 1955: Edward F.

It is currently the oldest preserved Union Pacific steam locomotive. It was originally acquired by the Union Pacific Railroad in 1887. History UP 737 began its career as part of one of the largest locomotive orders on record up to that date, for use on Union Pacific passenger and freight trains. As delivered, the locomotive had a long, pointed, vertical bar wooden pilot, an oil \\"box\\" headlight, a \\"diamond\\" stack of the shallow diamond style peculiar to the Union Pacific at that period. It had steam and sand domes that appeared comparatively square in profile and lacked the common, ornate, cast-iron dome \\"rings,\\" a decorative molding that dressed up the appearance of such domes and that many 19th century locomotives sported. Upon entering service, the locomotive reportedly had the initials \\"O.& R.V.\\" painted on the small panel below the windows on each side of the cab, standing for the name of a Union Pacific subsidiary in Nebraska, the Omaha and Republican Valley Railroad. Later the locomotive had \\"Union Pacific\\" spelled out in small letters on each side of the cab, probably in white, and a large white \\"737\\" on each side of its black tender. In August 1904 (different sources disagree on the date), the Union Pacific Railroad sold Locomotive No. 737 and a few similar 4-4-0s to either Charles Morgan's Louisiana and Texas Railroad and Steamship Company or the Texas and New Orleans Railroad, both of them components of the Southern Pacific System. A Union Pacific Railroad folio locomotive diagram book issued in 1911 showed engines of this class as having had their diamond stacks replaced with straight or \\"shotgun\\" stacks, but whether that change had been made before the sale of Locomotive No. 737 is not known. Locomotive No. 737 and some of her sisters migrated southward about 1904 to the Texas and Louisiana lines of the Southern Pacific System, such as the Galveston, Harrisburg and San Antonio Railway, the Texas and New Orleans Railroad, and Morgan's Louisiana and Texas Railroad and Steamship Company. According to one source, No. 737 became No. 246, lettered \\"Morgan's Louisiana and Texas.\\" Other sources suggest that it became a Texas and New Orleans Railroad locomotive. The Southern Pacific Company owned or controlled both of these Texas-Louisiana railroads, but the question of which subsidiary owned No. 246 is not unimportant, because it would have determined how the locomotive was lettered. In 1913, in a renumbering and reorganization of motive power, the Southern Pacific Company gave the locomotive its final number: No. 246 became No. 216. At the time, the locomotive probably was lettered \\"Southern Pacific Lines\\" in large white letters on her tender, with the number on the cab and the small initials to indicate the actual Southern Pacific subsidiary that owned her. During the first quarter of the 20th century the owning railroads made a number of important modifications to Engine 246, later 216. By the end of 1904, subsequent to Congress passing a safety act that mandated the change, the Southern Pacific converted the locomotive's link and pin coupling equipment to automatic \\"knuckle\\" couplers, possibly of the Janney type. At unknown dates, a number of other changes followed as the locomotive experienced further modernizations quite common on railroads across the country during that time. Mechanics and boilermakers replaced the original short smokebox with an extended smokebox with shotgun stack. It was almost certainly on the Southern Pacific Lines that the shops converted the locomotive from a coal burner to an oil burner. An oil tank was installed in the tender in place of the coal bin and hoses and pipes to feed oil to the firebox were rigged, with suitable controls and probably modification of the firebox grates. Thus the locomotive could exploit Texas and Louisiana petroleum for fuel. A steel pipe or \\"boiler tube\\" pilot replaced the original wooden type of cowcatcher. An all-steel cab replaced the original Baldwin wooden cab. A new and different headlight replaced the old kerosene \\"box\\" headlight. Locomotive No. 216 was retired on December 4, 1929 retired from active service on a major railroad system when it was sold by Southern Pacific Company to the Erath Sugar Company for industrial use in the cane fields of Louisiana. In August 1947, the Erath Sugar Company transferred ownership of No. 216 to the Vermilion Sugar Company at Abbeville, Louisiana. The Vermilion Sugar Company retired No. 216 in 1956. =Restoration= A New England seafood processor, F. Nelson Blount, bought the locomotive for his Steamtown, USA collection in 1957. To move the locomotive to Vermont on a flat car, it was necessary to cut off the roof of the steel cab to meet height clearance requirements, but Steamtown retained the cab roof, and moved it to Bellows Falls, Vermont. It was relocated in 1984 to the former Delaware, Lackawanna & Western Railroad's Scranton Yards at Scranton, Pennsylvania under the auspices of the Steamtown Foundation. Union Pacific 737 on display at Steamtown, USA, after the 1970 restoration. In 1970, Steamtown began an ill-conceived attempt to cosmetically restore the engine. A replica box headlight was installed, and a wooden cab was built overtop of the existing steel cab. Most significantly, a diamond stack replica was installed on the engine. This diamond stack was much shorter than the one the engine originally carried, and was of a different design from the original. Thus, the restored 737 bore little resemblance not only to its original form, but any form it had assumed during its service life. On October 30, 1986 the U.S. Congress passed legislation creating Steamtown National Historic Site as a unit of the National Park Service, Department of the Interior. The newly created Park is located in the former Delaware, Lackawanna and Western Railroad yards in Scranton, Pennsylvania. In 1989, the Steamtown Foundation donated the remaining railroad collection, including UP 737, to the National Park Service. The National Park Service removed this locomotive from its property listings in August 1995 when it was donated to the Nevada Southern Railroad Museum at Boulder City, Nevada. The NSRM loaned the 737 to the Western Pacific Railroad Museum in Portola, who later acquired full ownership of the engine. In 2004, the WPRRM traded the UP 737 to the Double-T Agricultural Museum in Stevinson, CA, where the engine was cosmetically restored to its 1914 appearance, with the straight, shotgun style smokestack, as well as the electric headlight and restored steel cab.

Blyth was born in London in 1810. In 1841 he travelled to India to become the curator of the museum of the Royal Asiatic Society of Bengal. He set about updating the museum's catalogues, publishing a Catalogue of the Birds of the Asiatic Society in 1849. He was prevented from doing much fieldwork himself, but received and described bird specimens from A.O. Hume, Samuel Tickell, Robert Swinhoe and others. He remained as curator until 1862, when ill-health forced his return to England. His Natural History of the Cranes was published posthumously in 1881. Avian species bearing his name include Blyth's hornbill, Blyth's leaf warbler, Blyth's hawk-eagle, Blyth's olive bulbul, Blyth's parakeet, Blyth's frogmouth, Blyth's reed warbler, Blyth's rosefinch, Blyth's shrike-babbler, Blyth's tragopan, Blyth's pipit and Blyth's kingfisher. Reptilian species and a genus bearing his name include Blythia reticulata, Eumeces blythianus, and Rhinophis blythii.Beolens, Bo; Watkins, Michael; Grayson, Michael (2011). The Eponym Dictionary of Reptiles. Baltimore: Johns Hopkins University Press. xiii + 296 pp. . (\\"Blyth\\", p. 28). Early life and work Blyth was the son of a clothier. His father died in 1820 and his mother sent him to Dr. Fennell's school in Wimbledon. Here he took an interest in reading but was often to be found spending time in the woods nearby. Leaving school in 1825, he went to study chemistry, at the suggestion of Dr. Fennell, in London under Dr. Keating at St. Paul's Churchyard. He did not find the teaching satisfactory and began to work as a pharmacist in Tooting, but quit in 1837 to try his luck as an author and editor. In 1836 he produced an annotated edition of Gilbert White's Natural History of Selborne which was reprinted in 1858. He was offered the position of curator at the museum of the Asiatic Society of Bengal in 1841. He was so poor that he needed an advance of 100 pounds to make the trip to Calcutta. In India, Blyth was poorly paid (the Asiatic Society did not expect to find a European curator for the salary that they could offer), with a salary of 300 pounds per year (which was unchanged for twenty years), and a house allowance of 4 pounds per month. He married in 1854, and tried to supplement his income by writing under a pseudonym (Zoophilus) for the Indian Sporting Review, and traded live animals between India and Britain to wealthy collectors in both countries. In this venture he sought the collaboration of eminent people such as Charles Darwin and John Gould, both of whom declined these offers. Although a curator of a museum with many responsibilities, he contributed mainly to ornithology, often ignoring the rest of his work. In 1847, his employers were unhappy at his failure to produce a catalogue of the museum. Some Asiatic Society factions opposed Blyth, and he complained to Richard Owen in 1848: He also found the ornithologist George Robert Gray, keeper at the British Museum, uncooperative in helping him with his ornithological research far away in India. He complained to the trustees of the museum but it was dismissed with several character references in favour of Gray including Charles Darwin. Dedication page of Hume's \\"My Scrapbook\\" (1869) Blyth's work on ornithology led him to be recognized as the father of Indian ornithology a title later transferred to Allan Octavian Hume.Murray, James A. 1888. The avifauna of British India and its dependencies. Truebner. Volume 1 He married a widow, Mrs. Hodges (born Sutton) who had moved to India, in 1854. She however died in December 1857, a shock which led to his health deteriorating from then on. On natural selection Edward Blyth wrote three articles on variation, discussing the effects of artificial selection and describing the process in nature as restoring organisms in the wild to their archetype (rather than forming new species). However, he never actually used the term \\"natural selection\\". These articles were published in The Magazine of Natural History between 1835 and 1837. In February 1855 Charles Darwin, seeking information on variations in domesticated animals of various countries, wrote to Blyth who was \\"much gratified to learn that a subject in which I have always felt the deepest interest has been undertaken by one so competent to treat of it in all its bearings\\" and they corresponded on the subject. Blyth was among the first to recognise the significance of Alfred Russel Wallace's paper \\"On the Law which has regulated the introduction of Species\\" and brought it to the notice of Darwin in a letter written in Calcutta on 8 December 1855: :\\"What think you of Wallace's paper in the Ann. M. N. H. ? Good! Upon the whole! ... Wallace has, I think, put the matter well; and according to his theory, the various domestic races of animals have been fairly developed into species. ... A trump of a fact for friend Wallace to have hit upon!\\" There can be no doubt of Darwin's regard for Edward Blyth: in the first chapter of On the Origin of Species he wrote \\"Mr. Blyth, whose opinion, from his large and varied stores of knowledge, I should value more than that of almost any one, ...\\" In 1911, H.M. Vickers considered Blyth's writings as an early understanding of natural selection which was noted in a 1959 paper, where Loren Eiseley claimed that \\"the leading tenets of Darwin's work ‚Äì the struggle for existence, variation, natural selection and sexual selection ‚Äì are all fully expressed in Blyth's paper of 1835\\". He also cited a number of rare words, similarities of phrasing, and the use of similar examples, which he regarded as evidence of Darwin's debt to Blyth. However, the subsequent discovery of Darwin's notebooks has \\"permitted the refutation of Eiseley's claims\\". Eiseley argued that Blyth's influence on Darwin \\"begins to be discernible in the Darwin Note-book of 1836 with the curious word 'inosculate'. It is a word which has never had a wide circulation, and which is not to be found in Darwin's vocabulary before this time.\\" This was incorrect: an 1832 letter written by Darwin commented that William Sharp Macleay \\"never imagined such an inosculating creature\\". The letter preceded Blyth's publication, and indicates that both Darwin and Blyth had independently taken the term from Macleay whose Quinarian system of classification had been popular for a time after its first publication in 1819‚Äì1820. In a mystical scheme this grouped separately created genera in \\"osculating\\" (kissing) circles. Both Ernst Mayr and Cyril Darlington interpret Blyth's view of natural selection as maintaining the type: :\\"Blyth's theory was clearly one of elimination rather than selection. His principal concern is the maintenance of the perfection of the type. Blyth's thinking is decidedly that of a natural theologian...\\" :\\"What was the work of Blyth?... Blyth attempts to show how [selection and the struggle for existence] can be used to explain, not the change of species (which he was anxious to discredit) but the stability of species in which he ardently believed.\\" In this negative formulation, natural selection only preserves a constant and unchangeable type or essence of created form, by eliminating extreme variations or unfit individuals that deviate too far from this essence. The formulation goes back to the ancient Greek philosopher Empedocles, and the theologian William Paley set out a variation on this argument in 1802, to refute (in later pages) a claim that there had been a wide range of initial creations, with less viable forms eliminated by nature to leave the modern range of species: :\\"The hypothesis teaches, that every possible variety of being hath, at one time or other, found its way into existence (by what cause or in what manner is not said), and that those which were badly formed, perished; but how or why those which survived should be cast, as we see that plants and animals are cast, into regular classes, the hypothesis does not explain; or rather the hypothesis is inconsistent with this ph√¶nomenon.\\" The way Blyth himself argued about the modification of species can be illustrated by an extract concerning the adaptations of carnivorous mammals: :\\"However reciprocal...may appear the relations of the preyer and the prey, a little reflection on the observed facts suffices to intimate that the relative adaptations of the former only are special, those of latter being comparatively vague and general; indicating that there having been a superabundance which might serve as nutriment, in the first instance, and which, in many cases, was unattainable by ordinary means, particular species have therefore been so organized (that is to say, modified upon some more or less general type or plan of structure,) to avail themselves of the supply.\\" Stephen Jay Gould writes that Eiseley erred in failing to realize that natural selection was a common idea among biologists of the time, as part of the argument for created permanency of species. It was seen as eliminating the unfit, while some other cause created well-fitted species. Darwin introduced the idea that natural selection was creative in giving direction to a process of evolutionary change in which small hereditary changes accumulate. John Wilkins indicates that Blyth considered that species had \\"invariable distinctions\\" establishing their integrity, and so was opposed to transmutation of species as if it occurred, \\"we should seek in vain for those constant and invariable distinctions which are found to obtain\\". Darwin held the opposite view, and did not read Blyth until after formulating his own theory. In contrast to Eiseley's claim that Blyth felt that Darwin had plagiarised the idea, Blyth remained a valued correspondent and friend of Darwin's after the idea was published. Return from India Blyth returned to London on 9 March 1863 to recover from ill health. He was to get a full year's pay for this sick leave. He however had to borrow money from John Henry Gurney and continued his animal trade. Around 1865, he began to help Thomas C. Jerdon in the writing of the Birds of India but had a mental breakdown and had to be kept in a private asylum. He was a corresponding member of the Zoological Society and was elected an extraordinary member of the British Ornithological Union, nominated by Alfred Newton. He later took to drinking and was once held for assaulting a cab driver. He died of heart disease in December 1873. Other works Although Blyth spent most of his time in the museum in India, he was aware and interested in the study of birds in life. Prior to moving to India, he conducted some experiments to examine if cuckoo eggs (or more generally foreign eggs) were detected and removed by the hosts by placing eggs of one species in the nests of others. In 1835 he wrote that he had experimentally found chaffinches to remove a foreign egg when placed in their clutch. He also suggested the idea of replacing the original clutch with another clutch but with a single foreign egg and suggested based on his own results that either the foreign eggs would be discarded or that the birds would abandon the nest. Blyth also examined the patterns of moult in various bird groups. Blyth edited the section on \\"Mammalia, Birds, and Reptiles\\" in the English edition of Cuvier's Animal Kingdom published in 1840, inserting many observations, corrections, and references of his own.

His main works were A General Synopsis of Birds (1781‚Äì1801) and General History of Birds (1821‚Äì1828). He was able to examine specimens of Australian birds which reached England in the last twenty years of the 18th century, and was responsible for providing English names for many of them. These included the emu, sulphur-crested cockatoo, wedge-tailed eagle, superb lyrebird and Australian magpie. He was also the first to describe the hyacinth macaw. Latham has been called the \\"grandfather\\" of Australian ornithology. Biography John Latham was born on 27 June 1740 at Eltham in northwest Kent. He was the eldest son of John Latham (died 1788), a surgeon there, and his mother, who was a descendant of the Sothebys, in Yorkshire. He was educated at Merchant Taylors' School and then studied anatomy under William Hunter and completed his medical education in London hospitals. In 1763 at the age of 23 he began working as a physician in the village of Darenth, near Dartford in Kent. In the same year he married Ann Porter. They had four children of whom a son John (1769-1822) and a daughter Ann (1772-1835) survived childhood. Latham retired from his medical practice aged 56 in 1796 and moved to live near his son at Romsey in Hampshire. His wife died in 1798 and Latham remarried the same year to Ann Delamott. His son who had invested in a series of inns became heavily indebted and was declared bankrupt in 1817. Latham lost much of his wealth in supporting his son. In 1819 Latham sold his house in Romsey and moved with his wife to live with his daughter's family in Winchester. His second wife died in 1821 and then in the following year his son committed suicide. Latham died aged 96 in Winchester on the 4 February 1837 and was buried in Romsey Abbey. Contribution to ornithology Engraving of John Latham by Robert William Sievier, 1816. A General Synopsis of Birds was Latham's first ornithological work and contained 106 illustrations by the author. It described many new species which Latham had discovered in various museums and collections. In this work, like Georges- Louis Leclerc, Comte de Buffon, he did not attach importance to the names of the species which he described. Later, Latham realised that only the use of the Linnean binomial system would give him the honour of originating the species' scientific names. Thus he published in 1790, a Index Ornithologicus where he specified a binomial name for all the species which he had previously described. However, it was too late, as Johann Friedrich Gmelin had already published his own version of Linnaeus' Systema Natur√¶ in which he gave a scientific name to Latham's species; taking into account the rules of nomenclature, Gmelin has priority. Nevertheless, there are around eighty bird species for which Latham's 1790 publication is cited as the authority. These include the emu, the black swan, the hyacinth macaw, the sulphur-crested cockatoo, and the noisy friarbird. A supplement to the Index Ornithologicus containing additional scientific names was published as Supplementum indicis ornithologici sive systematis ornithologiae with the year of 1801 on the title page. Although there is circumstantial evidence that the supplement was not available until 1802, for the purposes of zoological nomenclature the evidence for a later publication date has not been deemed sufficient to justify changing the year. Working from drawings, Latham appears to have had difficulty in distinguishing the different species and some he described more than once under different names. In his Supplementum Indicis Ornithologici he described the Australian noisy miner four times: as the chattering bee-eater (Merops garrulus), the black-headed grakle (Gracula melanocephala), the hooded bee-eater (Merops cucullatus), and the white-fronted bee-eater (Merops albifrons). This has caused some confusion in the ornithological literature as to the correct scientific name. Latham's 1801 Latin supplement is the authority for around seventy species of birds, almost all of which occur only in Australasia. They include the Pacific gull, the barking owl, the noisy miner, the Australian magpie and the magpie-lark. Beginning in 1821, when Latham was in his eighties, he published an expanded version in eleven volumes of his earlier work with the title A General History of Birds. The ornithologist Alfred Newton later wrote that: \\"his defect as a compiler, which had manifest itself before, rather increased with age, and the consequences were not happy.\\" Latham maintained a regular correspondence with Thomas Pennant, Joseph Banks, Ashton Lever and others. He was elected to the Royal Society in 1775, and also took part in the creation of the Linnean Society. In 1812, he was elected a foreign member of the Royal Swedish Academy of Sciences.

Nowadays the region comprises parts of western Ukraine and adjoining parts of south-eastern Poland. It has also sometimes included parts of Lesser Poland, Podolia, \\"Right-bank Ukraine\\" and Volhynia.

During the second half of the 14th century, the Vlachs arrived from the southeastern Carpathians and quickly settled across southern Red Ruthenia. Although during the 15th century the Ruthenians gained a foothold, it was not until the 16th century that the Wallachian population in the Bieszczady Mountains and the Lower Beskids was Ruthenized.Czajkowski, 1992; Parczewski, 1992; Reinfuss, 1948, 1987, 1990 From the 14th to the 16th centuries Red Ruthenia underwent rapid urbanization, resulting in over 200 new towns built on the German model (virtually unknown before 1340, when Red Ruthenia was the independent Duchy of Halych).Kwartalnik historii kultury materialnej: t. 47, PAN. 1999. p. 146 The ducal seal of Vladislaus II of Opole (W≈Çadys≈Çaw Opolczyk): \\"'\\" (c. 1387). =Political history=  1199 to 1772  The Red Cities region is central to the historic Red Ruthenia.

Since the reign of W≈Çadys≈Çaw Jagie≈Ç≈Ço (d. 1434) the Przemy≈õl Voivodeship was called the Ruthenian Voivodeship (wojew√≥dztwo ruskie), centring on Lw√≥w. The voivodeship consisted of five regions: Lw√≥w, Sanok, Halicz (Halych), Przemy≈õl (Peremyshl), and Che≈Çm. The town of Halych gave its name to Galicia.During the 1340s, the influence of the Rurik dynasty ended; most of the area passed to Casimir the Great, with Kyiv and the state of Volhynia falling under the control of the Grand Duchy of Lithuania. The Polish region was divided into a number of voivodeships, and an era of German eastward migration and Polish settlement among the Ruthenians began. Armenians and Jews also migrated to the region. A number of castles were built at this time, and the cities of Stanis≈Çaw√≥w (Stanyslaviv in Ukrainian, now Ivano-Frankivsk) and Krystynopol (now Chervonohrad) were founded. In October 1372, W≈Çadys≈Çaw Opolczyk was deposed as count palatine. Although he retained most of his castles and goods in Hungary, his political influence waned. As compensation, Opolczyk was made governor of Hungarian Galicia. In this new position, he contributed to the economic development of the territories entrusted to him. Although Opolczyk primarily resided in Lw√≥w, at the end of his rule he spent more time in Halicz. The only serious conflict during his time as governor involved his approach to the Orthodox Church, which angered the local Catholic boyars. Under Polish rule 325 towns were founded from the 14th century to the second half of the 17th century, most during the 15th and 16th centuries (96 and 153, respectively).A.

Together with a number of other voivodeships of southern and eastern part of the Kingdom of Poland, it formed Lesser Poland Province of the Polish Crown, with its capital city in Krak√≥w. Following the Partitions of Poland, most of Ruthenian Voivodeship, except for its northeastern corner, was annexed by the Habsburg Monarchy, as part of the province of Galicia. Today, the former Ruthenian Voivodeship is divided between Poland and Ukraine.  History  Following the Galicia‚ÄìVolhynia Wars, the Kingdom of Galicia‚ÄìVolhynia was divided between Poland and Lithuania. In 1349 the Polish portion was transformed into the Ruthenian domain of the Crown, while the Duchy of Volhynia was held by Prince Lubart. With the death of Casimir III the Great, the Kingdom of Poland was passed on to the Kingdom of Hungary and the Ruthenian domain was governed by Ruthenian starosta general, one of whom was Wladyslaw of Opole. The voivodeship was created in 1434 based on the 1430 Jedlnia-Cracow Privilege () on territory that belonged to the Kingdom of Galicia‚ÄìVolhynia. Between 1349 and 1434, the territory along with the Western Podolie was known as Ruthenian Domain of the Crown and in such manner the King of Poland were titled as the Lord of Ruthenian lands.Mykhailovskyi, V.M. (–†–£–°–¨–ö–ò–ô –î–û–ú–ï–ù –ö–û–†–û–õ–Ø). Encyclopedia of History of Ukraine. Western Podolie was added to the domain in 1394. In 1434 on territory of the domain were created Ruthenian Voivodeship and Podolian Voivodeship. In Polish sources, western outskirts of the region was called Ziemia czerwie≈Ñska, or \\"Czerwie≈Ñ Land\\", from the name of Cherven, a town that existed there.

XV, pages 561‚Äì562. Warszawa. 1876. (digital edition) This area was mentioned for the first time in 981, when Volodymyr the Great of Kievan Rus' took it over on the way into Poland. In 1018 it attached to Poland and 1031 back to Kievan Rus'. For approximately 150 years it existed as the independent Principality of Halych and Kingdom of Galicia‚ÄìVolhynia (also known as the Kingdom of Rus'), before being conquered by Casimir III of Poland in 1349. Since these times the name Ru≈õ Czerwona is recorded, translated as \\"Red Ruthenia\\" (\\"Czerwie≈Ñ\\" means red in Slavic languages, or from the Polish village Czermno), applied to a territory extended up to Dniester River, with priority gradually transferred to Przemy≈õl. Since the times of W≈Çadys≈Çaw II Jagie≈Ç≈Ço, the Przemy≈õl voivodeship was called Ruthenian Voivodeship ('), with its center eventually transferred to Lw√≥w. It consisted of five lands: Lw√≥w, Sanok, Halych, Przemy≈õl, and Che≈Çm. The territory was controlled by the Austrian Empire from 1772 to 1918, when it was known as the Kingdom of Galicia and Lodomeria. Zygmunt Gloger, in his monumental book Historical Geography of the Lands of Old Poland, provides this description of the Ruthenian Voivodeship: > In the 10th and 11th centuries, Przemysl and Czerwien were the largest gords > in this region. Later on, Halych emerged as the capital of the province, > while the city of Lw√≥w was founded only in 1250. In ca. 1349, King Casimir > III of Poland took control over Principality of Halych. The province was > governed by royal starostas, the first one of whom was a man named Jasiek > Tarnowski. Most probably in final years of reign of King W≈Çadys≈Çaw II > Jagie≈Ç≈Ço, it was named the Ruthenian Voivodeship, as at that time the > voivodes of Przemysl began calling themselves the voivodes of Rus'.

History Boulevard P√©ripherique over Batignolles Cemetery Batignolles Cemetery opened on 22 August 1833. Part of the cemetery had to be closed and the graves moved because of the construction of the great ring road (Boulevard P√©riph√©rique, between the exits of Porte de Clichy and Porte de Saint-Ouen). Description Extending over nearly eleven hectares, slightly larger than the Montmartre Cemetery, Batignolles Cemetery contains approximately fifteen thousand graves, and it is the fourth cemetery intra muros of Paris, in terms of the number of graves. In terms of land area, only the P√®re Lachaise Cemetery and the Montparnasse Cemetery are larger. Paris Townhall website; Memoirs of Cora Pearl; Granada Publishing; 1984 Within its perimeter, there are approximately nine hundred mature trees, mostly chestnuts and maples. Because of the construction of apartment buildings next to the cemetery, the Avenue des Fortifications is no longer accessible (from 2009-?). Notable burials Batignolles is now the home for the earthly remains of Andr√© Barsacq, Alexandre Benois, Andr√© Breton, Alfred Bruneau, Lucienne Br√©val, Gaston Calmette, Blaise Cendrars, Cl√©mentine de V√®re, L√©on Dierx, Pierre Dreyfus, Marguerite Durand, H√©l√®ne Dutrieu, Cora Pearl, Jos√©phin P√©ladan, Benjamin P√©ret, Ray Ventura, Paul Vidal, √âdouard Vuillard and Andr√© Zirnheld (in the family grave), among others. Before the opening of Sainte-Genevi√®ve-des-Bois Russian Cemetery the cemetery was a popular burial place for members of the Russian Orthodox community. Many are buried in the carr√© russe-orthodoxe, division 25. Among them L√©on Bakst, Sergei Lyapunov, Pavel Milyukov and Pavel Ryabushinsky. Feodor Chaliapin was buried here but his remains were later reburied in Novodevichy Cemetery in Moscow. The grave of Paul Verlaine was originally in division 20 but had to be moved to the roundabout (at the crossing of Avenue Principale and Avenue Transversale). The cemetery contains one British Commonwealth war grave, a Royal Air Force officer of 1918. CWGC Cemetery Report. Location The cemetery is located in the √âpinettes district, in the northeastern part of the 17th arrondissement. The entry to the cemetery is at the intersection of Rue Saint-Just and Avenue du Cimeti√®re des Batignolles. The cemetery is lodged between the Boulevard P√©riph√©rique and the Lyc√©e International Honor√© de Balzac. Public transport The Batignolles Cemetery is a short walk from the Porte de Clichy station, which can be reached by taking line 13 or the C line commuter train. Other nearby M√©tro stations are Brochant, Mairie de Clichy and Porte de Saint-Ouen. The Batignolles Cemetery is also served by bus lines 54, 74, 138A, 173, PC There are V√©lib' stations at Avenue de la Porte de Clichy (17014 and 17114) and at Boulevard Berthier (17106).

This technique is used by climbers, mountaineers, cavers, canyoners, search and rescue and rope access technicians to descend cliffs or slopes when they are too steep and/or dangerous to descend without protection. Many climbers use this technique to protect established anchors from damage. Rope access technicians also use this as a method to access difficult-to-reach areas from above for various industrial applications like maintenance, construction, inspection and welding. To descend safely, abseilers use a variety of techniques to increase the friction on the rope to the point where it can be controlled comfortably. These techniques range from wrapping the rope around their body (e.g. The D√ºlfersitz) to using a custom built device like a rack. Practitioners choose a technique based on speed, safety, weight and other circumstantial concerns. In the United States, the term \\"rappelling\\" is used nearly exclusively. In the United Kingdom, both terms are understood, but \\"abseiling\\" is strongly preferred. In Australia, New Zealand and Canada, the two terms are used interchangeably. Globally, the term \\"rappelling\\" appears in books written in English more often than \\"abseiling\\".  History  The origin of the term rappel in reference to the technique is attributed by circa 1944.Roger Frison-Rocheand and Sylvain Jouty. A History of Mountain Climbing. Paris, France: Flammarion, 1996. . 302. Frison in turn attributed the techinique of abseiling to , a Chamonix guide who lived from 1840‚Äì1925. Charlet originally devised the technique during a failed solo attempt of Petit Dru in 1876. After many attempts, some of them solo, he managed to reach the summit of the Petit Dru in 1879 in the company of two other hired Chamonix guides, Prosper Payot and Fr√©d√©ric Folliguet. During that ascent, Charlet mastered the technique.

File:Abseilen jumelle.jpgModern abseiling technique used by climbers uses belay device File:Abseil riesenschlot.jpgCave abseils can be long and might have to be done using ropes with varying degrees of friction. That requires specialized brake bar rack  Equipment  * Ropes: Static rope is ideal, but often dynamic rope is used. * Anchors: Usually constructed from trees, boulders, ice or rock features, using webbing/cordellete, or rock climbing equipment. Some areas have fixed anchors such as bolts or pitons. * A descender: A friction device or friction hitch that allows rope to be played out in a controlled fashion, under load, with a minimal effort by the person controlling it. * Climbing harness: Fixed around the waist or whole body used to secure the descender. Fit is important to prevent suspension trauma. * Safety back-up: Typically a friction hitch such as a prusik, Klemheist knot, or autoblock knot wrapped around the rope as to prevent uncontrolled descents. * Helmets: Used to protect the head from bumps and falling rocks. * Gloves: Used to protect hands from the rope and from colliding with the wall. May increase the risk of accident by becoming caught in the descender. * Boots or climbing shoes: Used to increase friction against the rock * Knee-pads (and sometimes elbow-pads)  Application  A United States Air Force Pararescueman rappels from a helicopter during a training exercise in Iraq, 2008 Abseiling is used in a number of applications, including: * Climbing - for returning to the base of a climb or to a point where one can try a new route. * Recreation * Canyoning - to descend tall waterfalls and/or cliffs. * Mountaineering * Caving and speleology - where underground pitches need to be accessed. * Adventure racing * Industrial/commercial applications - to access parts of structures or buildings so as to perform maintenance, cleaning or construction * Access to wildfires. * Confined spaces access - e.g. ballast tanks, manholes * Rescue applications - used to access injured people on or nearby cliffs. * Military applications - tactical heliborne insertion of troops, including special forces, into the battlefield close to the objective when proper landing zones are not available.  Styles/techniques  Australian rappel demonstrated at a dam in Norway Rescue-style (eared) figure eight descender and rope * Australian rappel ‚Äî Used in the military. The abseiler descends facing downwards allowing them to see where they are going. * Tandem or spider abseiling ‚Äî Used in climbing. Involves two climbers descending on the same belay device. This is useful in rescue situations when one of the climbers is incapacitated or the descent needs to be done quickly. The set-up is similar to a regular rappelling, with the incapacitated climber suspended from the descender (and backed up on the primary climbers harness). * Simul-rappelling or simultaneously rappelling ‚Äî Used in climbing and canyoning. Two climbers descend simultaneously on the same length of rope, where one climber‚Äôs weight counterbalances the other. Generally the technique is considered less safe than the regular rappelling; however, it‚Äôs useful in case of emergencies, or for rapping off opposite sides of a fin or spire where there are no anchor points. This is common in places like the Needles of South Dakota‚Äôs Black Hills. * Counterbalance abseiling ‚Äî Used in climbing. This rescue technique is typically used by a leader to reach an injured second. The leader abseils off on one strand of rope, using the incapacitated second's weight on the other strand of the rope as a counterbalance. * Releasable abseil ‚Äî Used by guides. This safety technique allows a leader to descend with inexperienced abseilers. A rope about twice the length of the descent is anchored with a munter mule hitch. The client descends on a single isolated strand of the rope. If the client becomes stuck halfway down the guide will be able to unlock the other strand and lower the client to the ground using the hitch as a belay device. This could be useful if the client panics, or gets clothing or hair entangled in the descender. * Classical (non-mechanical methods), e.g. the D√ºlfersitz ‚Äî Used in emergencies. These technique are more dangerous than modern alternatives and only used when no other option is available. They involve descending without aid of mechanical devices, by wrapping the rope around the body, and were used before the advent of harnesses and hardware. * South African classical abseil (double-roped) ‚Äî Used in emergencies. This is a type of classical abseil where the user has a spare hand. * Fireman's Belay ‚Äî Safety backup. A partner stands on the ground below holding the rope(s). If the abseiler begins to fall they will be able to pull down on the rope to arrest the descent.  Safety  Abseiling can be dangerous, and presents risks, especially to unsupervised or inexperienced abseilers. According to German mountaineer Pit Schubert, about 25% of climbing deaths occur during abseiling, most commonly due to failing anchors.Pit Schubert, Sicherheit und Risiko in Fels und Eis vol. I, M√ºnchen 2009, p.104 An analysis of American Alpine Club accident reports shows that this is followed by inadequate safety backups and rappelling off the ends of ropes.  Environmental Concerns  Abseiling is prohibited or discouraged in some areas, due to the potential for environmental damage and/or conflict with climbers heading upwards, or the danger to people on the ground.

It was primarily used from around 800 to 1650 AD. Ligatures are characteristic of neumatic (chant) and mensural notation. The notation and meaning of ligatures has changed significantly throughout Western music history, and their precise interpretation is a continuing subject of debate among musicologists. History =Plainchant= The early notation of plainchant, particularly Gregorian chant, used a series of shapes called neumes, which served as reminders of music that was taught by rote rather than as an exact record of which notes to sing. Neumes were in use from the 9th through the 11th centuries AD for most plainsong, and differed by region. Due to their malleable nature, there were no hard and fast rules for the lengths each note was supposed to last, or even how high or low the intervals between notes were to be. =De mensurabili musica= A treatise on notation named De mensurabili musica was copied around 1260. In this treatise, the anonymous author proposed that, much in the same way that poetry of the time was based on a series of modal rhythms, music should also be set up in this way. The notation of these modes was accomplished primarily through using ligatures in varying lengths and with varying degrees of complexity, where the rhythms would be derived from context. For most of their notated history, this was the purpose of ligatures: to indicate the rhythmic mode. =Franco of Cologne= Around 1250, a music theorist named Franco of Cologne published a treatise on music entitled Ars cantus mensurabilis. In this treatise, Franco proposed that note values should be set up objectively, so that when looking at the notated music, a musician would be able to tell what notes were being sung or played, and the duration of those notes, with some degree of certainty. Ligatures were used for this as well, as they had become more or less standardized through the practice of the rhythmic modes. =Polyphonic music from c1300-c1600= See mensural notation (ligatures). Usage Ligature values vary based on the shape of the ligature and whether it has a tail. Ligatures have two basic shapes: box (rectangular) and oblique (angled). Additionally, some ligatures have tails that either point up or down; the direction of the ligature's tail affects its meaning, unlike the direction of a tail on a modern note head. While primarily contextual, the system of ligatures in use from the 13th to the 16th century is fairly standardized. All ligatures of this period have the following principles in common: *All ligature notes are either the length of a longa (\\"L\\"), a breve (\\"B\\"), or a semibreve (\\"S\\"). *All ligatures have at least two notes. *For ease of discussion, ligatures of different lengths have different names. A ligature with two notes is called a binaria; one with three notes, a ternaria; one with four notes, a quaternaria; and one with five notes, a quinaria. Larger ones are possible, but rare. *If a ligature has three or more notes, all notes in the middle (the mediae) are B. *A downward tail changes the value of the note where the tail occurs, either from L to B or, less commonly, from B to L. *An upward tail indicates that the next two notes are a series of S. *A tail at the end of a ligature indicates an additional note be sung or played, called a plica, that is not part of the ligature. Plicas were especially common with the rhythmic modes, to accommodate in practice what could not be accomplished within the very strict theoretical basis for modal music. =Alternate interpretations= Most scholarship on ligatures is focused on period from the 13th to the 16th centuries. Prior to this period, ligatures were far less standardized; a quaternaria ligature that, under the above rules, would mean a series like SSLB would simply mean BBBB. Transcription In transcribing old works to modern notation, where no compound graphs as ligatures exist, editors usually indicate by a hook, a bracket (brace), or (less often in polyphonic music) a slur/phrase mark those notes that the original combined into a ligature. To avoid confusion, many scores transcribed purely for performance do not include additional notation to indicate that a particular note originally belonged to a ligature, as most methods to show this have separate meanings in a performance capacity.

Like its predecessors, it has little room for expansion. Some companies did create memory upgrades that brought the machine up to 2 MB or more. It is the earliest Macintosh model able to run System Software 6. It is also the earliest that can be used as an AppleShare server and, with a bridge Mac, communicate with modern devices.Macs and FTP Model differences Originally, the case was identical to its predecessor, except for the model number listed on the rear bucket's agency approval label. It used the same beige-like color as well. But like the Macintosh Plus, in 1987 the 512Ke adopted the standard Apple \\"Platinum\\" color, as well as the same case-front design as the Plus (without the name), though keeping its original rear bucket. Later in its lifespan, the 512Ke was discounted and offered to the educational market, badged as the Macintosh ED (M0001D & later M0001ED). The 512Ke shipped with the original short Macintosh Keyboard, but the extended Macintosh Plus Keyboard with built-in numeric keypad could be purchased optionally. A version of the 512Ke only sold outside of North America included the full keyboard and was marketed as the Macintosh 512K/800.The Computer Museum Later, the larger keyboard would be included as standard in North America as well. Although the 512Ke includes the same 128K ROMs and 800K disk drive as the Mac Plus, the 512Ke retains the same port connectors as the original Mac. For this reason, 512Ke users' only hard disk option is the slower, floppy-port-based Hard Disk 20, or similar products for the serial port, even though the 512Ke ROMs contain the \\"SCSI Manager\\" software that enables the use of faster SCSI hard disks (because the ROMs are the same as the ones used in the Mac Plus, which does have a SCSI port). Apple did point users to certain third-party products which could be added to the 512Ke to provide a SCSI port (Apple copied the MacSCSI design in the Mac Plus logic board).Macintosh 512K: Adding a SCSI Port Official upgrades A Macintosh 512K could be upgraded to a 512Ke by purchasing and installing Apple's $299 Macintosh Plus Disk Drive Kit. This included the following: * 800 KB double- sided floppy disk drive to replace the original 400 KB single-sided drive * 128 KB ROM chips to replace original 64 KB ROM * Macintosh Plus System Tools disk with updated system software * Installation guide One further upgrade made by Apple replaced the logic board and the rear case (to accommodate the different port configuration) with those of the Macintosh Plus, providing built-in SCSI functionality and up to 4MB RAM. Because Apple's official upgrades were costly, many third-party manufacturers offered add-on SCSI cards, as well as RAM upgrades, to achieve the same functionality. The new ROM allowed the computer to run much newer system and application software; though it loaded more data into RAM, it only slightly decreased the amount of available memory ‚Äì by 1.5K ‚Äì leaving well over 370K available for applications.Macintosh 512K ROM Upgrade: Memory AvailableMacintosh Plus: Description (Discontinued) The Macintosh Plus Logic Board Kit System software After June 1986, the 512Ke shipped with System 3.2.

Overview It is backwards compatible with the Yamaha YM3526, to which it is very similar ‚Äì in fact, it only adds 3 new waveforms. An upgraded version of the OPL2, the Yamaha YMF262 (OPL3), was also popular in later sound cards such as the Sound Blaster 16. Another related chip is the YM2413 (OPLL), which is a cut down version.

It can produce 9 channels of sound, each made of two oscillators or 6 channels with 5 percussion instruments available. Each oscillator can produce sine waves which may also be modified into 3 other waveforms ‚Äì the negative part of the sine can be muted or inverted, and pseudo sawtooth waves (¬º sine waves upward only with silent sections in between) can also be produced. This odd way of producing waveforms give the YM3812 a characteristic sound. Each wave generator has its own ADSR envelope generator. Its main method of synthesis is frequency modulation synthesis, accomplished via phase modulation of the phase of one channel's oscillators by the output of another. YM3812 oscillator waveforms Internal operation The internal operation of the chip is completely digital. Each FM-tone is generated by a digital oscillator using a form of direct digital synthesis. A quarter of the log-transformed sine waveform is stored as a sampled approximation in a 256-word read-only memory (ROM) table. The rest of the sine-waveform is extrapolated via its property of symmetry. Scaling the output of an oscillator to a wanted volume would normally be done by multiplication, but the YM3812 avoids multiplications by operating on log-transformed signals, which reduces multiplications into computationally cheaper additionshttps://docs.google.com/document/d/18IGx18NQY_Q1PJVZ- bHywao9bhsDoAqoIn1rIm42nwo/. Another 256-word ROM stores the exponential function as a lookup table, used to convert the logarithmic scale signal back to linear scale when required, as the final stage where the oscillator-outputs are summed together (just prior to the DAC-output bus), with the modulator waveform always delayed by one sample before the carrier waveform.http://dev.kewl.org/misc/ymf262/ymf262.c The YM3812's output, a sequence of floating point numbers clocked at a sampling frequency of approximately 49716 Hz, is sent to a separate digital-to-analog converter (DAC) chip, the YM3014B. Overview of a channel's registers: For the whole channel: * Main frequency (10 bits) * Octave (3 bits) * Note on/off * Synthesis mode (FM or just additive) * Feedback (0‚Äì7, the modulator modulating itself) For each one of the 2 oscillators: * Frequency multiply (can be set to ¬Ω, 1 to 10, 12 or 15) * Waveform (Sine, half-sine, absolute-sine, quarter- sine) * Volume (0‚Äì63, logarithmic) * Attack, Decay, Sustain, Release (4 bits each, logarithmic) * Tremolo (On or off) * Vibrato (On or off) * Sustain (On or off) * Envelope scaling per key (On or off) * Volume scaling per key (0‚Äì3) There are also a few parameters that can be set for the whole chip: * Vibrato depth * Tremolo depth * Percussion mode (uses 3 channels to provide 5 percussion sounds) * Composite sine mode (see Sinewave synthesis) Synthesizers Synthesizers that use the YM3812: * Yamaha PSR-11 49-keys 16-sounds (1986) * Yamaha PSR-12 49-keys 32-sounds (1987) * Yamaha PSR-21 49-keys 16-sounds, 2 steps sliders (1986) * Yamaha PSR-22 49-keys 32-sounds, 2 steps sliders (1987) * Yamaha PSR-31 61-keys 16-sounds, additional YM3301 chip for drums (1991) * Yamaha PSR-32 61-keys 32-sounds, additional YM3301 chip for drums (1987) * Yamaha PSS-360 49 mini-keys 21-sounds, 5 steps sliders, low- cost mono version of PSS-460 (1986) * Yamaha PSS-460 49 mini-keys 21-sounds, 5 steps sliders (1986) * Yamaha PSS-470 49 mini-keys 21-sounds, 5 steps sliders (1987) * Yamaha PSS-560 49 mini-keys 21-sounds, 5 steps sliders, additional YM3301 chip for drums (1986) * Yamaha PSS-570 49 mini-keys 21-sounds, 5 steps sliders, additional YM3301 chip for drums (1987) Synths that use the YM2413 (cost reduced YM3812): * Yamaha PSR-6 49-keys 100-sounds (1994) * Yamaha PSS-140 37 mini-keys 100-sounds (1988) * Yamaha PSS-170 44 mini-keys 100-sounds (1986) * Yamaha PSS-270 49 mini-keys 100-sounds (1986) See also * List of Yamaha products References Category:Computer-related introductions in 1985 YM3812 ","title":"Yamaha YM3812"},{"id":"400593","text":"The Macintosh SE is a personal computer designed, manufactured, and sold by Apple Computer, Inc. from March 1987 to October 1990. It marked a significant improvement on the Macintosh Plus design and was introduced by Apple at the same time as the Macintosh II. The SE retains the same Compact Macintosh form factor as the original Macintosh computer introduced three years earlier and uses the same design language used by the Macintosh II. An enhanced model, the SE/30, was introduced in January 1989; sales of the original SE continued. The Macintosh SE was updated in August 1989 to include a SuperDrive, with this updated version being called the \\"Macintosh SE FDHD\\" and later the \\"Macintosh SE SuperDrive\\". The Macintosh SE was replaced with the Macintosh Classic, a very similar model which retained the same central processing unit and form factor, but at a lower price point.  Overview  The Macintosh SE was introduced at the AppleWorld conference in Los Angeles on March 2, 1987. The \\"SE\\" is an acronym for \\"System Expansion\\". Its notable new features, compared to its similar predecessor, the Macintosh Plus, were: * First compact Macintosh with an internal drive bay for a hard disk (originally 20 MB or 40 MB) or a second floppy drive. * First compact Macintosh that featured an expansion slot. * First Macintosh to support the Apple Desktop Bus (ADB), previously only available on the Apple IIGS, for keyboard and mouse connections. * Improved SCSI support with faster data throughput and a standard 50-pin internal SCSI connector. * Better reliability and longer life expectancy (15 years of continuous use) due to the addition of a cooling fan. * Upgraded video circuitry that results in a lower percentage of CPU time being spent drawing the screen. In practice this results in a 10-20 percent performance improvement. * Additional fonts and kerning routines in the Toolbox ROM * Disk First Aid is included on the system disk The SE and Macintosh II were the first Apple computers since the Apple I to be sold without a keyboard. Instead the customer was offered the choice of the new ADB Apple Keyboard or the Apple Extended Keyboard. Apple produced ten SEs with transparent cases as prototypes for promotional shots and employees. They are extremely rare and command a premium price for collectors. = Operating system = The Macintosh SE shipped with System 4.0 and Finder 5.4; this version is specific to this computer. (The Macintosh II, which was announced at the same time but shipped a month later, includes System 4.1 and Finder 5.5.) The README file included with the installation disks for the SE and II is the first place Apple ever used the term \\"Macintosh System Software\\", and after 1998 these two versions were retroactively given the name \\"Macintosh System Software 2.0.1\\".  Hardware  Processor: Motorola 68000, 8 MHz, with an 8 MHz system bus and a 16-bit data path RAM: The SE came with 1 MB of RAM as standard, and is expandable to 4 MB. The logic board has four 30-pin SIMM slots; memory must be installed in pairs and must be 150 ns or faster. Video: The built-in 512 √ó 342 monochrome screen uses 21,888 bytes of main memory as video memory. Storage: The SE can accommodate either one or two floppy drives, or a floppy drive and a hard drive. After-market brackets were designed to allow the SE to accommodate two floppy drives as well as a hard drive, however it was not a configuration supported by Apple. In addition an external floppy disk drive may also be connected, making the SE the only Macintosh besides the Macintosh Portable which could support three floppy drives, though its increased storage, RAM capacity and optional internal hard drive rendered the external drives less of a necessity than for its predecessors. Single-floppy SE models also featured a drive-access light in the spot where the second floppy drive would be. Hard-drive equipped models came with a 20 MB SCSI hard disk. Battery: Soldered into the logic board is a 3.6 V 1/2AA lithium battery, which must be present in order for basic settings to persist between power cycles. Macintosh SE machines which have sat for a long time have experienced battery corrosion and leakage, resulting in a damaged case and logic board. Expansion: A Processor Direct Slot on the logic board allows for expansion cards, such as accelerators, to be installed. The SE can be upgraded to 50 MHz and more than 5 MB with the MicroMac accelerators. In the past other accelerators were also available such as the Sonnet Allegro. Since installing a card required opening the computer's case and exposing the user to high voltages from the internal CRT, Apple recommended that only authorized Apple dealers install the cards; the case was sealed with then-uncommon Torx screws. Upgrades: After Apple introduced the Macintosh SE/30 in January, 1989, a logic board upgrade was sold by Apple dealers as a high-cost upgrade for the SE, consisting of a new SE/30 motherboard, case front and internal chassis to accommodate the upgrade components. Easter egg: The Macintosh SE ROM size increased from 64 KB in the original Mac and 128 KB in the Mac Plus to 256 KB, which allowed the development team to include an Easter Egg hidden in the ROMs. By jumping to address 0x41D89A or reading from the ROM chips it is possible to display the four images of the engineering team. Inside the Macintosh SE The main PCB from a 1988 Macintosh SE  Models  Introduced March 2, 1987: * Macintosh SE Introduced August 1, 1989: * Macintosh SE FDHD: Includes the new SuperDrive, a floppy disk drive that can handle 1.4 MB High Density (HD) floppy disks. FDHD is an acronym for \\"Floppy Disk High Density\\"; later some Macintosh SE FDHDs were labeled Macintosh SE Superdrive, to conform to Apple's marketing change with respect to their new drive. High-density floppies would become the de facto standard on both the Macintosh and PC computers from then on. An upgrade kit was sold for the original Macintosh SE which included new ROM chips and a new disk controller chip, to replace the originals. * Macintosh SE 1/20: The name of the Macintosh SE FDHD with a 20 MB HDD when sold in Europe. * Macintosh SE 1/40: The name of the Macintosh SE FDHD with a 40 MB HDD when sold in Europe.

The MIT program was founded in 1969, and the program at the University of Michigan was founded in the 1989 (primarily to help minorities and women break into science and mathematics). The University of California, Irvine founded its program in 1995. In the United Kingdom, Imperial College London provides a program for doing research in most of its departments for undergraduates at Imperial. Furthermore, the UROP scheme is also available at the University of Cambridge, the University of Reading, the University of Essex and the National University of Singapore. In 2008 the RWTH Aachen University started the first international UROP program for students from the United States and Canada in Germany. The University of Sussex runs a similar scheme, across all of its departments, where undergraduates are funded for 6 weeks as Junior Research Associates. The California State University, Long Beach program does not serve transfer students. Students can apply for funding by submitting a proposal during \\"Calls for Proposals\\", which occur throughout the school year. The Calls are announced on the school web sites and distributed to faculty members and the undergraduate counseling offices. Students have approximately one month from the announcement to submit their proposals. All undergraduate students from all disciplines and majors who are participating in a research project with a faculty advisor (usually a full- time professor at the university) eligible to respond to the current Call for Proposals if they are in good academic standing with the school. Proposals are prepared by the student applicant and jointly submitted by the student and the faculty advisors. UROP funds a variety of projects with grants depending upon the merits of the project. At UC Irvine, an individual student may receive up to $1,000 through UROP for projects during the school year, to help pay for supplies and other necessary materials. Alternatively, UC Irvine students may also apply for a prestigious summer fellowship, by which they may be awarded as much as $3,000 per project, which is meant to reward them for their time and efforts. Higher amounts may be awarded for group projects. The UROP Faculty Advisory Board reviews proposals and decides whether the project merits funding. The UROP Faculty Advisory Board also makes the funding recommendations. Upon completion of the year-long research project, students are expected to present their findings at the school's research symposium. Although not a requirement, some students may submit their written reports (ranging from 15-25 pages) to the faculty committee in order to be considered for publication in the university's research journals. Publication in the UROP undergraduate research journal is known to be extremely competitive. In many cases, students are asked to submit numerous drafts to the faculty committee for review, only to find out that their papers are later denied publication. In the past, a mere 5% of all submissions were accepted for publication in the UC Irvine and MIT journals. In addition, the University of Michigan housing also offers a UROP in residence option, called the Michigan Research Community, or MRC. This is an option for UROP students to live with each other and get an in-depth education in the University of Michigan's research. Additionally, students can also apply for a summer scholarship fellowship, in which students are given up to $3,000 to fund their own project.

Usually, it is employed on timed history tests.  In the United States  The document based question was first used for the 1973 AP United States History Exam published by the College Board, created as a joint effort between Development Committee members Reverend Giles Hayes and Stephen Klein. Both were unhappy with student performance on free-response essays, and often found that students were \\"groping for half-remembered information\\" and \\"parroted factual information with little historical analysis or argument\\" when they wrote their essays. The goal of the Document Based Question was for students to be \\"less concerned with the recall of previously learned information\\" and more engaged in deeper historical inquiry. Hayes, in particular, hoped students would \\"become junior historians and play the role of historians for that hour\\" as they engaged in the DBQ. A typical DBQ is a packet of several original sources (anywhere from three to sixteen), labeled by letters (beginning with \\"Document A\\" or \\"Source A\\") or numbers. Usually all but one or two source(s) are textual, with the other source(s) being graphic (usually a political cartoon, map, or poster if primary and a chart or graph if secondary). In most cases, the sources are selected to provide different perspectives or views on the events or movements being analyzed. On the Advanced Placement (AP) exams, only primary sources are provided; on the International Baccalaureate (IB) exams, both primary and secondary sources are provided. AP exams also require students to construct and defend a thesis based on one prompt, while IB exams focus on a series of questions, with at least one asking students to assess the \\"value and limitations\\" of a source, usually \\"with reference to the documents' origin or purpose.\\" The documents contained in the document-based questions are rarely familiar texts (for example, the Emancipation Proclamation and Declaration of Independence are not likely to be on a U.S. history test), though the documents' authors may be major historical figures. The documents vary in length and format. On some tests students are not permitted to begin responding to the question or questions in the essay packet until after a mandatory reading time (\\"planning period\\"), usually around 10 to 15 minutes. During this time, students read the passage and, if desired, make notes or markings. After this period, students are permitted to respond, usually for around 45 minutes to an hour.

A post-teenage Brazilian comic, it is set in the medieval fantasy world of Arton, part of the RPG campaign setting Tormenta. Overview The series lasted for 42 issues (40 regular ones and a 2-issue \\"post-end\\" story). Spinoffs include special issues that portray each of the main characters individually, an audio CD with voice actors playing the characters, an RPG book based on events in the series, an artbook with original sketches, and a new edition. The English name Holy Avenger was given to the series because it can both refer to a D&D; magical item and one of the main characters, the Paladin. A Portuguese name would have been gender- specific to indicate either the sword or the fighter, and thus wouldn't work the same way. In this case, the title becomes \\"Vingador Sagrado\\" (male gender) or \\"Vingadora Sagrada\\" (female gender). History Originally, Holy Avenger was an adventure for a D&D; game published in the RPG magazine Drag√£o Brasil, issues #44 to #46, in 1998. In 1999, author Marcelo Cassaro made up his own RPG setting, called \\"Tormenta\\" (Storm, referencing an extraplanar storm that afflicted the campaign setting's world). He included the Holy Avenger characters in this new RPG setting. In 1999 he teamed up with Erica Awano to start an ongoing monthly comic series. Initially, sales were unsatisfactory, but after about 10 issues the magazines took off. The series was sent back to the newsstands through the short-lived Holy Avenger VR, which lasted only seven editions, and through Holy Avenger Reloaded, which had more pages and extra material. Plot The plot revolves around a 19-year-old girl, Lisandra, a druid who was raised by animals on the island of Galrasia. She starts having dreams about the Paladin, a hero who mysteriously disappeared a few years ago. This Paladin had in his armour the Rubies of Virtue, twenty magical gems forged by each one of the twenty most powerful gods of the world of Arton. The gems were scattered all over the world after the Paladin's disappearance, and, according to Lisandra's dreams, it is up to her to find them and return them to the Paladin, in order to revive him. At first, with her \\"cousin\\" (a cave wolf), she discovers that one of the rubies was in the possession of a man who was cursed into a dragon form. Unable to fight the dragon on her own, she begins a quest to find the great thief Galtran, and so she travels to the city of Valkaria. This is the first time she left her island, and she knows no other human being. So, in the city, her \\"cousin\\" draws the attention of the city guard. She explains that it means no harm and she is only looking for Galtran. The guards passing by say that everyone is looking for him. When she says that she wants to hire him, they tell her that she must come with them. The wolf fatally attacks one of the guards to protect her. For wanting to hire a thief and being responsible for the death of a city guard, she is arrested. On the same night, Sandro Galtran (son of the great thief Leon Galtran) comes to rescue Lisandra from the palace's dungeon. After escaping, they go for the Ruby.  Characters  The main characters of Holy Avenger are: Lisandra: A 19-year-old half-dryad girl, raised by animals on the island of Galrasia. She is on a quest to reunite the 20 Rubies of Virtue to resurrect the Paladin. Sandro: The son of Leon Galtran, the greatest thief of Arton. He frees Lisandra from a prison and helps her to find the Rubies. Sandro wishes to be a great thief, like his father, but he is clumsy and untalented. Niele: A busty elven mage, that dresses only with leather strips, she is famous for having saved the city of Malpetrim from a water dragon. She meets Sandro as he tries to steal her Ruby of Virtue. She ends up helping him with his hunt for the Rubies of Virtue. Tork: Tork is a trog, a species of reptilian humanoid. He is very short for the standards of his race, and was abandoned by his tribe when he was a baby. He makes a living as a mercenary. He is the one who taught Lisandra to speak, use clothes, and walk on two legs. Because of this, he calls her his daughter. He ends up helping her find the Rubies of Virtue. He usually rushes headlong into battle, and has a foul mouth. The Paladin: The Paladin was once the Paladin of Jallar, a lesser goddess, but she killed him out of jealousy. He was resurrected and joined a group of adventurers. He later had his body infused with the 20 Rubies of Virtue by one of his ex-companions, Vladislav, granting him extraordinary powers and making him a legendary hero.

UCD. Retrieved on 3 June 2004. (born 1953) is an Irish writer. As well as his own plays, which include The Factory Girls, Observe the Sons of Ulster Marching Towards the Somme, Someone Who'll Watch Over Me and Dolly West's Kitchen, he is recognised for a \\"strong record of adapting literary classics, having translated the plays of Racine, Sophocles, Ibsen, Garcia Lorca, and Strindberg to critical acclaim\\". He has also published four collections of poetry, and two novels. McGuinness has been Professor of Creative Writing at University College Dublin (UCD) since 2007. Biography McGuinness was born in Buncrana, a town located on the Inishowen Peninsula of County Donegal, Ireland. He was educated locally and at University College Dublin, where he studied Pure English and medieval studies to postgraduate level. He first came to prominence with his play The Factory Girls, but established his reputation with his play about World War I, Observe the Sons of Ulster Marching Towards the Somme, which was staged in Dublin's Abbey Theatre and internationally. The play made a name for him when it was performed at Hampstead Theatre, drawing comments about McGuinness's Irish Catholic background.Maxwell, Dominic. \\"Observe the Sons of Ulster Marching Towards the Somme at Hampstead Theatre, NW3\\". The Times. Retrieved on 25 June 2009. It won numerous awards including the London Evening Standard Award for Most Promising Playwright for McGuinness and the Christopher Ewart-Biggs Memorial Prize. He has also written new versions of classic dramas, including works by Henrik Ibsen, Anton Chekhov, and Euripides, adapting the literal translations of others.Higgins, Charlotte. \\"Frank McGuinness: 'I'm not entirely respectable. I couldn't be'\\". The Guardian. Retrieved on 18 October 2008. In addition, he wrote the screenplay for the film Dancing at Lughnasa, adapting the stage play by fellow Ulsterman Brian Friel. McGuinness's first poetry anthology, Booterstown, was published in 1994. Several of his poems have been recorded by Marianne Faithfull, including Electra, After the Ceasefire and The Wedding. McGuinness previously lectured in Linguistics and Drama at the University of Ulster, Medieval Studies at University College, Dublin and English at the National University of Ireland, Maynooth. Then he was a writer-in-residence lecturing at University College Dublin before being appointed Professor of Creative Writing in the School of English, Drama and Film there.\\"McGuinness named Professor of Creative Writing at UCD\\". UCD. Retrieved 22 June 2007. Original plays Frank McGuinness has explained that: \\"My earliest writing was ... song writing. I would have loved to have been ... Paul McCartney ... Joni Mitchell.\\" Desiring to write something \\"substantial\\", however, he \\"tossed a coin\\" between a play and a novel, and decided to write a play. The Glass God, a one-act play written by McGuinness for the company Platform Group Theatre, was premiered at the Lourdes Hall Theatre in Dublin in 1982. It was one of three one-act plays presented under the collective title of Shrapnel. McGuinness' first full-length play, The Factory Girls, also premiered in 1982, and dealt with a group of female workers facing redundancy from a small town in Donegal. McGuinness explained that he was inspired by \\"the women in my family\\".\\"Playwrights in Profile: Frank McGuinness\\" (RTƒí Radio, 2013) A critic has highlighted its \\"Wednesday to Sunday time frame\\", in a link to Catholic imagery which, surprisingly given its theme, indicates that this is in fact \\"a passion play\\". \\"When I wrote 'The Factory Girls',\\" McGuiness has explained, \\"I desperately wanted to bring across the audience a sense that I came from a sophisticated background, [because] I come from a background where language is very dangerous, where language is very layered.\\" McGuinness' second play, Observe the Sons of Ulster Marching towards the Somme, was first staged in 1985. The play, about a group of Protestant soldiers in the First World War, was not primarily political in intent, but, according to the playwright, was originally inspired by \\"a great story\\". Observe the Sons of Ulster has been described as \\"a theater of ghosts\\", a play where \\"a community is figured as spectral\\".Tom Herron, Dead Men Talking: Frank McGuinness‚Äôs Observe the Sons of Ulster Marching Towards the Somme √âire-Ireland. Vol 39: 1&2 (Spring/Summer 2004): 136-62. The play which followed, Innocence, dealt with the painter Caravaggio. It took its name from one of his paintings, The Sacrifice of Isaak, about the Biblical story of the father whose faith is tested by God's request that he kill his son. In the painting, a sheep watches the sacrifice about to take place, and looks appalled at human cruelty, its innocence shattered. McGuinness was inspired by \\"this innocent sheep\\" who, at the end of the story, will be sacrificed instead of the child. \\"Only Caravaggio would remember the sheep\\" in the story, McGuinness says. His next play, \\"Carthaginians\\", premiered in 1989, was concerned with the Bloody Sunday events in Northern Ireland. In 1972, in Derry, British soldiers shot unarmed civilians who were taking part in a march against internment, and killed 14 people. McGuinness has described Carthaginians as \\"My play on the Catholic imagination...\\", stating that \\"the key word in [the play] is the word 'perhaps'\\". It has been claimed that \\"Cartaginians\\" should be placed primarily \\"within a body of translations and adaptations of ancient Greek tragedy in the Irish theatre of the 1980s and 1990s\\".\\"Review of Carthaginians\\" [at Millenium Forum, Derry, 2012, Directed by Adrian Dunbar] Liza Fitzhpatrick. 23 February 2015. Someone Who'll Watch Over Me, first staged in 1992, is a play about the 1986 Lebanon hostage crisis. A number of critics have suggested that Ibsen is the main influence in the plays of McGuinness, something corroborated by the writer himself, who has also explained that \\"... there is of course another influence, that of Shakespeare...\\". It was this influence that triggered the composition of Someone Who'll Watch Over Me. In the author's own words: \\"I decided, right, lets grab the unicorn by the horn, and see what happens\\". McGuinness has declared that he had \\"wanted to construct a five act Shakespearean play\\", and to use \\"narrative in a way that I hope no one had done before\\". He has described the play as \\"a big brute\\", adding that, among his works to date, \\"I suspect 'this play will last'\\". The play Dolly West's Kitchen, premiered in 1999, is set during the Second World War in Buncrana. This time was euphemistically referred to in the Republic of Ireland as \\"The Emergency\\". McGuinness has explained that the arrival of US troops into the town of Buncrana was not only an invasion in terms of the military presence, but also an \\"invasion of sexuality\\", as the soldiers made quite an impression in the town. But the main theme in the play \\"... was to do with a gigantic sorrow in my life, which is that my mother died.\\" This was the heart of the story, because, McGuinness explained, when the mother dies, \\"the children have to grow up\\". The play Gates of Gold, premiered in 2002, was commissioned by The Gate Theatre in Dublin to celebrate its anniversary. The theatre was founded by Miche√°l Mac Liamm√≥ir and Hilton Edwards, who were lifelong partners in life and work, and the play is about them. McGuinness, who is himself gay and whose plays often contain gay relationships or explore more traditional family drama from an outsider perspective, has explained that he \\"wanted to write a play that was a great celebration of homosexual marriage, love, partnership\\". The playwright has a drawing of MacLiammoir, by Norah McGuinness, in his sitting room, a work \\"which I bought with the royalties of the Factory Girls\\", so the actor is literally a constant presence in McGuinness' life. Gates of Gold looks at the dying days of MacLiammoir, because McGuinness wanted to write \\"something darker and stranger\\", and less predictable, about these two pioneers of theatre. Premiered in 2007, There Came a Gipsy Riding asks the question of \\"how do you survive the greatest loss, the loss of a child...\\", to conclude that \\"you don't recover, but you do learn to live with it\\". A critic summarised this \\"impressive drama\\" as \\"a concentrated piece that intricately dissects a middle-class family at war with itself following the suicide of one of their three children\\". The play The Hanging Gardens, premiered in 2007, is concerned with Alzheimer's disease, and the devastating effect it has on its sufferers and the people around them. McGuinness explained that: \\"I hope the audience laughs. And that they‚Äôre shocked. I try to give them something more than they expect.\\" One reviewer declared that the play \\"holds us, moves us, alarms us.\\" Adaptation McGuinness is as well known for his play adaptations as for his original plays. He has adapted classics by Sophocles, Racine, Ibsen, Valle-Inclan, or Lorca, as well as short works by Strindberg and Pirandello, a short story by James Joyce, and novels by Stoker and Du Maurier. His ability to distill the raw force from classic Greek drama, in particular, has been noted by critics. He sometimes takes noticeable liberties in his adaptations, in order to strengthen characterisation‚Äîfor example by making the alienated protagonist of 'Rebecca' into an Anglo-Irish woman from a once privileged family‚Äîor to underline the theme of the play‚Äîfor example in 'Rebecca' \\"I've invented a scene in which Mrs Danvers confronts Max and says, 'You loved her, but she didn't love you'\\", or in 'Barbaric Comedies', a play about a world of amoral grotesquerie, he added a sexual assault scene. Some of these liberties have been controversial. By and large, McGuinness' adaptations have been hailed as reworkings that \\"breath[e] life\\" into the originals. Poetry Frank McGuinness began his writing career as a poet. As a university student, he has explained, \\"I sent some poems to the 'Irish Press' and the wonderful [general editor] David Marcus wrote back to me saying [']I‚Äôm going to publish them['], and ‚ÄòYou are a writer‚Äô. He didn‚Äôt know what he was unleashing but that was the beginning really. A terrific thing to say when you‚Äôre 20 or 21. And I went from there\\". 'Booterstown' (1994), is rooted in the town of the same name; 'The Stone Jug' (2003) is a sequence of sixty sonnets; 'Dulse' (2008), takes its name from a Latin word meating 'sweet', which is also the name of an edible seaweed used in Ireland. Broadly, McGuinness poetic style is characterised by the use of clear solid unrhymed lines designed to echo in the mind of the listener or reader. The poems often seek to organise emotion, and sometimes represent probing psychological sketches. They are concerned with relationships, events, and the significance of the everyday. The poems are snapshots, often inspired by personal experience, but sometimes created to supplement or assist in delineating fictional characters for his plays.See for example Frank McGuinness' draft poems for \\"Greta Garbo in Donegal\\", at the Special Collections Library, UCD. One critic has claimed that McGuinness's poetic work is characterised by its \\"reliance on dramatic monologue and on intense lyricism\\".Maurice Harmon. \\"In the Wings: The Poetry of Frank McGuinness\\". Irish University Review. Vol. 40, No. 1 (Spring/Summer 2010): 126-137, p. 126. The Memorial Garden at University College Dublin, designed in a circular shape, features a carved stone with a short poem written by Frank McGuinness for the site: \\"This silence is round / So is remembrance, / they say\\". Fiction Frank McGuinness‚Äô first novel, ‚ÄòArimathea‚Äô, was published in 2013. It has been described as \\"[a] story of salvation\\". The book is set in a village in Donegal in 1950, registering the effect of the arrival of an Italian painter who \\"came from out foreign and . . . spoke wild funny\\". The story, told from the point of view of various characters, is inspired by a historic Italian artist who was commissioned to paint the Stations of the Cross in the catholic church of Buncrana in the 1900s. McGuinness wrote the book as research for his play The Hanging Gardens, but never thought it would be published as a novel. The story of the play deals with a novelist who contracts Alzheimer‚Äôs disease, and progressively loses control of his mind; and in order to understand the character better, McGuinness decided to try to write a novel that that man could have written, and the result was 'Arimathea'. In addition to this piece of work, McGuinness also conducted other research for the play, by interviewing people with experience of elderly parents being affected by Alzheimer‚Äôs disease. While one reviewer claimed that \\"there is nothing like [this novel] in the history of Irish fiction\\", another stated that Arimathea is \\"a distinctively Irish book, and one in which echoes of Joyce vie with those of M√°irt√≠n √ì Cadhain\\". Many commentators pointed out that this choral novel, told in a series of monologues, makes good use of Frank McGuinness‚Äô experience in the theatre, including his ability to render individualised voices. His background as a poet may also have been relevant to Arimathea‚Äôs investment on suggestion as method and silence as idea. \\"[T]he final effect\\" of the novel, as one reviewer put it, \\"is to lead the reader to consider those voices not yet heard, and the private agonies that are never shared\\". Frank McGuinness' second novel, 'The Woodcutter and His Family', published in September 2017, deals with the last days of James Joyce in Zurich.Frank McGuinness. 'The Woodcutter and his Family'. Dublin: The O'Brien Press, 2018. The novel is made of four sections, monologues from James, his partner Nora, their daughter Lucia, and son Giorgio, who are given the names of characters from Joyce's play 'Exiles'. At the book launch, Joycean scholar professor Anne Fogarty spoke of her surprise at opening the book to meet the voice of Giorgio Joyce, a figure neglected by Joycean scholars. Fogarty said that McGuinness' novel has \\"liberated\\" the Joyce family from historiographers and biographers, and described the book as \\"wise and witty\\".Professor Anne Fogarty, speaking at the book launch of 'The Woodcutter and His Family', Hodges Fidges Bookshop, Dublin, 27 September 2017. At the launch, Frank McGuinness explained that he fell under the spell of Joyce as a young man, when he heard Joni Mitchel read out the opening one and a half pages from the novel 'Portrait of the Artist'. McGuinness also said that he was aware, in taking on the project of a novel about the Joyces, that he was \\"putting my head into a zoo-worth of lions' mouths\\", but that this would not stop him.Frank McGuinness, speaking at the launch of 'The Woodcutter and His Family', Hodges Fidges Bookshop, Dublin, 27 September 2017. 'The Woodcutter and His Family' is notable also because it deliberately changes historical facts. While focusing on the Joyce family, the book also includes a portrait of the Irish playwright Samuel Beckett, a friend of the Joyces. Short Fiction McGuinness has published a number of short stories. The short story \\"Paprika\\", from 2014, appeared in a collection of new stories by Irish writers. \\"Paprika\\" is a tale of murder, centered on a disgruntled, mentally unstable operatic white tenor, who is currently playing the role of Othello in an opera, wearing blackface.\\"Paprika\\", in The story was reproduced in The Irish Times online: The story is told through \\"the pompous voice\\" of the protagonist, \\"who veers between grandiosity and despair\\". Structured as a fluid but self-conscious monologue, the piece has various levels of association, including a subversion ‚îÄor an update‚îÄ of the plot of Shakespeare‚Äôs play ‚ÄòOthello‚Äô, an investigation on the performance of identity, and a dissection of the 'logic' of inequality, and employing \\"[t]he shards of childhood\\", to \\"pierce the narrative in an unusual and thought-provoking [way].\\" In 2018, McGuinness published his first collection of short fiction, Paprika, consisting of twelve stories. It is published by Brandon, an imprint of The O'Brien Press in Dublin.https://www.obrien.ie/results.html?keyword=paprika The stories have been described as \\"uproarious and outrageous, [tending] to depict insecure, unhinged individuals who find themselves on the wrong side of a comfortable life. A startling collection\\"Kehoe, Paddy. Untitled review. (17 December 2018.) RTE Opera Frank McGuinness‚Äôs first opera libretto was Thebans, produced in 2014 at the English National Opera in London. The opera is a version of the trilogy of plays by Sophocles. He was invited to write the libretto by composer Julian Anderson. Adapting this substantial body of work onto a single story 100 minutes long was a considerable challenge. Recalling his initial conversations with the composer, McGuinness explained: \\"The first thing I said was: I know it will have to be much, much shorter. We looked at a two-page speech. \\"I can get this down to six lines,\\" I told him ‚Äì and then did just that.\\" The Theban trilogy, made of Oedipus Rex, Oedipus at Colonus, and Antigone, has been occasionally performed as a chronologically ordered, three- play show. For his version, McGuinness made the decision to change the traditional order in the story. He explained that \\"I've always thought that putting [the play Antigone] at the end of the evening short-changes it remarkably. Although it's the final part of the trilogy, it never feels like the end; in fact, it almost feels as if it were by a different writer.\\" While some critics did not approve of the switch, they still described the opera as \\"distinctly impressive\\". McGuinness‚Äô priority in producing the libretto was to make the original text accessible to a contemporary audience. \\"I'm trying to make this accessible\\", McGuinness declared, \\"and to write as beautiful a text as I can for the singers to sing. And that is what I think they are, these stories that have haunted us: they are something beautiful, something brutal, and the beauty and brutality confound each other.\\" The original trilogy is \\"revered as a foundational document of western civilisation\\", and one of the main achievements of this \\"dazzling new opera\\", a reviewer pointed out, was that \\"it blows apart this crippling reverence and presents the drama afresh\\" One reviewer underlined the fact that \\"McGuinness has whittled Sophocles‚Äôs plays down to a succession of very short, simple lines that can be easily heard when sung across an auditorium\\", and that \\"Anderson‚Äôs music fills the emotional space around these lines\\", to conclude that \\"[f]or all the antiquity of its roots, Thebans may point to the future of opera\\". Another reviewer declared that Frank McGuinness \\"has supplied what seems an eminently settable, elegant condensation of the drama\\", and that the opera as a whole offers \\"[t]he superb assurance of the writing metallically intent but underpinned by a novel harmonic richness\\". Film & Television McGuinness has written a number of film scripts. His script for the Oscar-winning \\"Dancing at Lughnasa\\" (Dir. Pat O'Connor, 2005) was an adaptation of the play of the same title by Brian Friel. This film's \\"most significant transformation of the play\\", one critic has pointed out, is the shifting of a defining dancing scene from the end of the first Act, to the end of the story, which \\"reveals the defining principle of the film: it turns memory into ritual\\".Marc C. Conner, \\"The Ritual of Memory in Friel's 'Dancing at Lughnasa'\\", R. Barton Palmer and Marc C. Conner eds,'Screening Modern Irish Fiction and Drama', London: Palgrave, 2016, pp. 231-52, pp.242-3. McGuinness was also the author of the original script for \\"Talk of Angels\\", the cinema adaptation of Kate O'Brien's banned novel \\"Mary Lavelle\\", although the script was considerably modified in the final production.A.L.Mentxaka, 'Kate O'Brien and the Fiction of Identity'. Jefferson (N. Carolina): McFarland, 2011, p. 80. Discussing his childhood, McGuinness has explained that, while there were no books around when he was growing up, in addition to newspapers, they had \\"television, which is the great subverter, a wonderful wonderful (sic) source of entertainment at the time\\".Deirdre Mulrooney [interview with Frank McGuiness], \\"Embracing the Unknown\\". 'UCD Commentions' magazine, Issue 13, 2008, pp. 30-2, p. 31. His television films include 'Scout' (BBC 1987), directed by Danny Boyle, about the talent scout for the football team Manchester United in Northern Ireland, and 'A Song for Jenny' (BBC 2015), adapted from Julie Nicholson's book of the same title, about the aftermath of the 2005 islamist terrorist bombings in London. McGuinness was also the scriptwriter for the ground-breaking television film \\"A Short Stay in Switzerland\\" (BBC 2009), dealing with euthanasia. In addition, McGuinness has scripted a number of documentaries for television, including \\"The Messiah XXI\\" (RTE 2000), commemorating the premiere of Handel's oratorio 'Messiah' in Dublin in 1791, and \\"Happy Birthday Oscar Wilde\\" (RTE 2004), celebrating the Irish writer. Themes and opinions Major recurring features of McGuinness's playwriting include the treatment of historical events and the prominent inclusion of gay or bisexual characters. A writer's task, McGuiness declared in 2015, is \\"to do something that no one has done before, to discover\\". In the same interview, he added that: \\"The enquiring mind, the radical mind, will always be ill at ease about what is said about a particular subject.\\" Awards and honours Source for entries 1985-1999: *1985 London Evening Standard \\"Award for Most Promising Playwright\\" for Observe the Sons of Ulster Marching Towards the Somme *1985 Roony Prize for Irish Literature for Observe the Sons.. *1985 Arts Council Bursary for Observe the Sons.. *1985 Harvey's Best Play Award for Observe the Sons.. *1985 Cheltenham Literary Prize for Observe the Sons.. *1986 London Fringe Awards for Best Play and Best Playwright New to the Fringe for Observe the Sons.. *1986 Plays and Players Award for Most Promising Playwright for Observe the Sons.. *1987 Ewart-Biggs Peace Prize for Observe the Sons.. *1990 Prague International Television Awards for The Hen House (BBC2) *1992 New York Drama Critics Circle for Someone Who'll Watch Over Me *1992 Writers' Guild Award for Best Play for Someone Who'll Watch Over Me *1992 Independent Sunday Best Play of the Year Award for Someone Who'll Watch Over Me *1992 Oliver Award nomination for Someone Who'll Watch Over Me *1992 Tony Award nomination for Someone Who'll Watch Over Me *1992 Ireland Fund Literary Award *1996 Tony Award for Best Revival for A Doll's House *1997 French Order of Arts and Letters *1999 Oliver Award nomination for Best New Play for Dolly West's Kitchen *2010 BAFTA nomination for Best Single Drama for A Short Stay in Switzerland *2014 Irish PEN Award ‚Ä¢ 2019 Tip O‚ÄôNeil Award List of works =Plays= * The Glass God (Platform Theatre Group, Dublin, 1982) * The Factory Girls (Abbey Theatre, Dublin, 1982) * Borderlands (TEAM Educational Theatre Company, 1984) * Gatherers (TEAM Educational Theatre Company, 1985) * Ladybag (Damer Hall, Dublin for Dublin Theatre Festival, 1985) * Baglady (Abbey Theatre, Dublin, 1985) * Observe the Sons of Ulster Marching Towards the Somme (Abbey, 1985; Hampstead Theatre, London, 1986) * Innocence (Gate Theatre, Dublin, 1986) * Times in It (Peacock stage of Abbey Theatre, Dublin 1988: triple bill consisting of 'Feed the Money and Keep Them Coming'; 'Brides of Ladybag' and 'Flesh and Blood') * Carthaginians (Abbey, 1988; Hampstead, 1989) * Mary and Lizzie ([The Pit] Barbican / RSC, London, 1989) * The Bread Man (The Gate Theatre, Dublin, 1990) * Someone Who'll Watch Over Me‚Äîbased on Brian Keenan‚Äôs 'An Evil Cradling' (1992) (Hampstead, West End and Broadway, 1992) * The Bird Sanctuary (Abbey Theatre, Dublin, 1993; Pittsbourgh Public Theatre, 2005; ) * Mutabilitie (RNT, 1997) * Dolly West's Kitchen (Abbey Theatre, Dublin, 1999) * Speaking Like Magpies (RSC, The Swan Theatre, Straford-upon-Avon, 2005) * Gates of Gold (Gate Theatre, Dublin, 2002.

The paintings typically depict the Hudson River Valley and the surrounding area, including the Catskill, Adirondack, and White Mountains. Works by the second generation of artists associated with the school expanded to include other locales in New England, the Maritimes, the American West, and South America. Overview The name Hudson River School is thought to have been coined by New York Tribune art critic Clarence Cook or by landscape painter Homer Dodge Martin. It was initially used disparagingly, as the style had gone out of favor after the plein-air Barbizon School had come into vogue among American patrons and collectors. Hudson River School paintings reflect three themes of America in the 19th century: discovery, exploration, and settlement. They also depict the American landscape as a pastoral setting, where human beings and nature coexist peacefully. Hudson River School landscapes are characterized by their realistic, detailed, and sometimes idealized portrayal of nature, often juxtaposing peaceful agriculture and the remaining wilderness which was fast disappearing from the Hudson Valley just as it was coming to be appreciated for its qualities of ruggedness and sublimity. In general, Hudson River School artists believed that nature in the form of the American landscape was a reflection of God, though they varied in the depth of their religious conviction. They were inspired by European masters such as Claude Lorrain, John Constable, and J. M. W. Turner. Several painters were members of the D√ºsseldorf school of painting, others were educated by German Paul Weber.John K. Howat: American Paradise: The World of the Hudson River School, S. 311 Founder Thomas Cole, A View of the Two Lakes and Mountain House, Catskill Mountains, Morning, 1844, Brooklyn Museum of Art Thomas Cole is generally acknowledged as the founder of the Hudson River School. He took a steamship up the Hudson in the autumn of 1825, stopping first at West Point then at Catskill landing. He hiked west high into the eastern Catskill Mountains of New York to paint the first landscapes of the area. The first review of his work appeared in the New York Evening Post on November 22, 1825. Cole was from England and the brilliant autumn colors in the American landscape inspired him. His close friend Asher Durand became a prominent figure in the school, as well. A prominent element of the Hudson River School was its themes of nationalism, nature, and property. Adherents of the movement also tended to be suspicious of the economic and technological development of the age.Angela Miller, The Empire of the Eye (1996); Alfred L. Brophy, Property and Progress: Antebellum Landscape Art and Property, McGeorge Law Review 40 (2009): 601-59. Second generation Frederic Edwin Church, Niagara Falls, 1857, Corcoran Gallery of Art, Washington, DC Albert Bierstadt, Among the Sierra Nevada Mountains, California, 1868, Smithsonian American Art Museum, Washington, DC John Frederick Kensett, Mount Washington, 1869, Wellesley College Museum Asher Brown Durand, The Catskills, 1859, Walters Art Museum The second generation of Hudson River School artists emerged after Cole's premature death in 1848; its members included Cole's prize pupil Frederic Edwin Church, John Frederick Kensett, and Sanford Robinson Gifford. Works by artists of this second generation are often described as examples of Luminism. Kensett, Gifford, and Church were also among the founders of the Metropolitan Museum of Art in New York City. Most of the finest works of the second generation were painted between 1855 and 1875. During that time, artists such as Frederic Edwin Church and Albert Bierstadt were celebrities. They were both influenced by the D√ºsseldorf school of painting, and Bierstadt had studied in that city for several years. Thousands of people would pay 25 cents per person to view paintings such as Niagara and The Icebergs. The epic size of these landscapes was unexampled in earlier American painting and reminded Americans of the vast, untamed, and magnificent wilderness areas in their country. This was the period of settlement in the American West, preservation of national parks, and establishment of green city parks. Women A number of women were associated with the Hudson River School. Susie M. Barstow was an avid mountain climber who painted the mountain scenery of the Catskills and the White Mountains. Eliza Pratt Greatorex was an Irish- born painter who was the second woman elected to the National Academy of Design. Julie Hart Beers led sketching expeditions in the Hudson Valley region before moving to a New York City art studio with her daughters. Harriet Cany Peale studied with Rembrandt Peale, and Mary Blood Mellen was a student and collaborator with Fitz Henry Lane. Legacy Hudson River School art has had minor periods of resurgence in popularity. The school gained interest after World War I, probably due to nationalist attitudes. Interest declined until the 1960s, and the regrowth of the Hudson Valley has spurred further interest in the movement. Historic house museums and other sites dedicated to the Hudson River School include Olana State Historic Site in Hudson, New York, the Thomas Cole National Historic Site in the town of Catskill, the Newington- Cropsey Foundation's historic house museum, art gallery, and research library in Hastings-on-Hudson, New York, and the John D. Barrow Art Gallery in the village of Skaneateles, New York.

One of the major 19th-century American painters, he is regarded as the founder of the Hudson River School, an American art movement that flourished in the mid-19th century. Cole's work is known for its romantic portrayal of the American wilderness.  Early life and education  Born in Bolton le Moors, Lancashire, in 1801, Cole emigrated with his family to the United States in 1818, settling in Steubenville, Ohio. At the age of 22, Cole moved to Philadelphia and later, in 1825, to Catskill, New York, where he lived with his wife and children until 1848.Tour brochure, Thomas Cole House, Catskill NY. Cole found work early on as an engraver. He was largely self-taught as a painter, relying on books and by studying the work of other artists. In 1822, Cole started working as a portrait painter and later on, gradually shifted his focus to landscape.  Painting  The Titan's Goblet (1833), Oil on canvas; 49 √ó 41 cm. The Metropolitan Museum of Art, New York In New York, Cole sold five paintings to George W. Bruen, who financed a summer trip to the Hudson Valley where the artist produced landscapes featuring the Catskill Mountain House, the famous Kaaterskill Falls, the ruins of Fort Putnam, and two views of Cold Spring.http://hamiltonauctiongalleries.com/COLE-T25FP.JPG Returning to New York, he displayed five landscapes in the window of William Colman's bookstore; according to the New York Evening Post the two views of Cold Spring were purchased by Mr. A. Seton, who lent them to the American Academy of the Fine Arts annual exhibition in 1826. This garnered Cole the attention of John Trumbull, Asher B. Durand, and William Dunlap. Among the paintings was a landscape called View of Fort Ticonderoga from Gelyna. Trumbull was especially impressed with the work of the young artist and sought him out, bought one of his paintings, and put him into contact with a number of his wealthy friends including Robert Gilmor of Baltimore and Daniel Wadsworth of Hartford, who became important patrons of the artist. Cole was primarily a painter of landscapes, but he also painted allegorical works. The most famous of these are the five-part series, The Course of Empire, which depict the same landscape over generations‚Äîfrom a near state of nature to consummation of empire, and then decline and desolation‚Äînow in the collection of the New-York Historical Society and the four-part The Voyage of Life. There are two versions of the latter, one at the National Gallery in Washington, D.C., the other at the Munson-Williams-Proctor Arts Institute in Utica, New York. Among Cole's other famous works are The Oxbow (1836), The Notch of the White Mountains, Daniel Boone at his cabin at the Great Osage Lake, and Lake with Dead Trees (1825) which is at the Allen Memorial Art Museum. He also painted The Garden of Eden (1828), with lavish detail of Adam and Eve living amid waterfalls, vivid plants, and deer.Exhibit at the Amon Carter Museum in Fort Worth, Texas In 2014, friezes painted by Cole on the walls of his home, which had been decorated over, were discovered. Cole influenced his peers in the art movement later termed the Hudson River School, especially Asher B. Durand and Frederic Edwin Church. Church studied with Cole from 1844 to 1846, where he learned Cole's technique of sketching from nature and later developing an idealized, finished composition; Cole's influence is particularly notable in Church's early paintings. Cole spent the years 1829 to 1832 and 1841 to 1842 abroad, mainly in England and Italy.  Other work  Cole is best known for his work as an American landscape artist. In an 1836 article on \\"American Scenery\\", he described his complex relationship with the American landscape in esthetic, emotional, and spiritual terms. He also produced thousands of sketches of varying subject matter. Over 2,500 of these sketches can be seen at The Detroit Institute of Arts. In 1842, Cole embarked on a Grand Tour of Europe in an effort to study in the style of the Old Masters and to paint its scenery. Most striking to Cole was Europe's tallest active volcano, Mount Etna. Cole was so moved by the volcano's beauty that he produced several sketches and at least six paintings of it.\\"Studies on Thomas Cole\\" Baltimore Museum of Art, Annual II. pp. 123. Baltimore, Maryland 1967. The most famous of these works is A View from Mount Etna from Taormina which is a oil on canvas. Cole also produced a highly detailed sketch View of Mount Etna which shows a panoramic view of the volcano with the crumbling walls of the ancient Greek theater of Taormina on the far right. Cole was also a poet and dabbled in architecture, a not uncommon practice at the time when the profession was not so codified. Cole was an entrant in the design competition held in 1838 to create the Ohio Statehouse in Columbus, Ohio. His entry won third place, and many contend that the finished building, a composite of the first, second, and third-place entries, bears a great similarity to Cole's entry.  Personal life  After 1827 Cole maintained a studio at the farm called Cedar Grove, in the town of Catskill, New York. He painted a significant portion of his work in this studio. In 1836, he married Maria Bartow of Catskill, a niece of the owner's, and became a year-round resident. Thomas and Maria had five children.They were: Theodore Alexander Cole, born January 1, 1838; Mary Bartow Cole, born September 23, 1839; Emily Cole, born August 27, 1843; Elizabeth Cole, born April 5, 1847 (died in infancy); Thomas Cole Jr., born September 16, 1848. () Cole's daughter Emily was a botanical artist who worked in watercolor and painted porcelain. Cole's sister, Sarah Cole, was also a landscape painter; the two were close. Additionally, Cole held many friendships with important figures in the art world including Daniel Wadsworth, with whom he shared a close friendship. Proof of this friendship can be seen in the letters that were unearthed in the 1980s by the Trinity College Watkinson Library. Cole emotionally wrote Wadsworth in July 1832: \\"Years have passed away since I saw you & time & the world have undoubtedly wrought many changes in both of us; but the recollection of your friendship... [has] never faded in my mind & I look at those pleasures as \\"flowers that never will in other garden grow-\\"Cole, T., & Wadsworth, D. (1983).

Early years Jasper Francis Cropsey, self-portrait in The Narrows from Staten Island, 1868, detail Cropsey was born on his father Jacob Rezeau Cropsey's farm in Rossville on Staten Island, New York, the oldest of eight children. As a young boy, Cropsey had recurring periods of poor health. While absent from school, Cropsey taught himself to draw. His early drawings included architectural sketches and landscapes drawn on notepads and in the margins of his schoolbooks. Career Trained as an architect, he set up his own office in 1843. Cropsey studied watercolor and life drawing at the National Academy of Design under the instruction of Edward Maury and first exhibited there in 1844. A year later he was elected an associate member and turned exclusively to landscape painting; shortly after he was featured in an exhibition entitled \\"Italian Compositions\\". Cropsy traveled in Europe from 1847‚Äì1849, visiting England, France, Switzerland, and Italy. He was elected a full member of the Academy in 1851. Cropsey was a personal friend of Henry Tappan, the president of the University of Michigan from 1852 to 1863. At Tappan's invitation, he traveled to Ann Arbor in 1855 and produced two paintings, one of the Detroit Observatory, and a landscape of the campus. He went abroad again in 1856, and resided seven years in London, sending his pictures to the Royal Academy and to the International exhibition of 1862. Jasper Francis Cropsey - Starrucca Viaduct, Pennsylvania, 1865 Returning home, he opened a studio in New York and specialized in autumnal landscape paintings of the northeastern United States, often idealized and with vivid colors. Cropsey co-founded, with ten fellow artists, the American Society of Painters in Water Colors in 1866. =Hudson River School= By the Sea, Lulworth, 1857 Cropsey's interest in architecture continued throughout his life and was a strong influence in his painting, most evident in his precise arrangement and outline of forms. But Cropsey was best known for his lavish use of color and, as a first-generation member from the Hudson River School, painted autumn landscapes that startled viewers with their boldness and brilliance. As an artist, he believed landscapes were the highest art form and that nature was a direct manifestation of God. He also felt a patriotic affiliation with nature and saw his paintings as depicting the rugged and unspoiled qualities of America. Jasper Cropsey died in anonymity but was rediscovered by galleries and collectors in the 1960s. Today, Cropsey's paintings are found in most major American museums, including the National Gallery of Art, the Metropolitan Museum of Art, the Los Angeles County Museum of Art, the Crystal Bridges Museum of American Art, the Detroit Institute of Arts, the Timken Museum of Art in San Diego, the Honolulu Museum of Art, the Fine Arts Museum of San Francisco, the Denver Art Museum, the Princeton University Art Museum, and the Museum of Fine Arts, Boston. Works by Cropsey also hang in the White House. Cropsey and his wife Maria are buried in Sleepy Hollow Cemetery in Sleepy Hollow, New York. =Works= Some of his works include Jedburgh Abbey; Pontaine Marshes (1847); Backwoods of America (1857); Richmond Hill (1862); Indian Summer (1866); Greenwood Lake (1875); Lake Nemi in Italy (1879); Old Church at Arreton, Isle of Wight (1880); Ramapo Valley (1881); Autumn on the Hudson (1860): Wawayanda Valley (1883); Spring- time in England (1884); October in Ramapo Valley (1885); Autumn on Lake George, and A Showery Day (1886). His architectural works included Manhattan brownstones, the since-demolished 14th Street station for the IRT Sixth Avenue Line in Manhattan, and St. Luke's Episcopal Church on Staten Island.

Moran and his family, wife Mary Nimmo Moran and daughter Ruth, took residence in New York where he obtained work as an artist. He was a younger brother of the noted marine artist Edward Moran, with whom he shared a studio. A talented illustrator and exquisite colorist, Thomas Moran was hired as an illustrator at Scribner's Monthly. During the late 1860s, he was appointed the chief illustrator for the magazine, a position that helped him launch his career as one of the premier painters of the American landscape, in particular, the American West. Moran along with Albert Bierstadt, Thomas Hill, and William Keith are sometimes referred to as belonging to the Rocky Mountain School of landscape painters because of all of the Western landscapes made by this group. Biography Thomas Moran standing on a balcony, smoking a cigar, 1912 Thomas Moran began his artistic career as a teenage apprentice to the Philadelphia wood-engraving firm Scattergood & Telfer. Moran found the engraving process \\"tedious\\"Wilkins, Thurman. Thomas Moran: Artist of the Mountains. Norman, Oklahoma: University of Oklahoma Press, 1998, p. 18-19. and spent his free time working on his own watercolors.Wilkins, Thurman, p. 19. By the mid-1850s he was drawing the firm's illustrations for publication rather than carving them. It was then that he encountered illustrated books that included examples of the work of British artist J. M. W. Turner, who was to be a lasting influence on Moran's work. He also began studying with local painter James Hamilton. Moran traveled to England in 1862 to see Turner's work. From that point on, he emulated Turner's use of color, his choice of landscapes, and was inspired by his explorations in watercolor, a medium for which Turner was particularly well-known. During the 1870s and 1880s, Moran's designs for wood-engraved illustrations appeared in major magazines and gift oriented publications. Although he mastered multiple printing media including wood- engraving, etching, and lithography, which he learned from his brothers, he received renown for his paintings in oil and in watercolor. The height of his career coincided with the popularity of chromolithography, which Moran used to make color prints of his works, so that they could be widely distributed. He was also one of the leaders of the etching revival in the United States and Great Britain. Grand Canyon of the Colorado River Moran was married to Scottish born Mary Nimmo Moran (1842‚Äì1899), an etcher and landscape painter. The couple had two daughters and a son. His brothers Edward (1829‚Äì1901), John (1831-1902) and Peter (1841‚Äì1914), as well as his nephews Edward Percy Moran (1862‚Äì1935) and Jean Leon Gerome Ferris (1863‚Äì1930) were also active as artists. His brother John was also a pioneer in artistic photography. The two often worked side by side, John photographing the same scene that Thomas was painting. He died in Santa Barbara, California on August 25, 1926. Yellowstone images The Grand Canyon of the Yellowstone, Smithsonian American Art MuseumGallery of Thomas Moran paintings Thomas Moran's vision of the Western landscape was critical to the creation of Yellowstone National Park. In 1871 Dr. Ferdinand Hayden, director of the United States Geological Survey, invited Moran, at the request of American financier Jay Cooke, to join Hayden and his expedition team into the unknown Yellowstone region. Hayden was just about to embark on his arduous journey when he received a letter from Cooke presenting Moran as \\"an artist of Philadelphia of rare genius\\". Funded by Cooke (the director of the Northern Pacific Railroad), and Scribner's Monthly, a new illustrated magazine, Moran agreed to join the survey team of the Hayden Geological Survey of 1871 in their exploration of the Yellowstone region. During forty days in the wilderness area, Moran visually documented over 30 different sites and produced a diary of the expedition's progress and daily activities. His sketches, along with photographs produced by survey member William Henry Jackson, captured the nation's attention and helped inspire Congress to establish the Yellowstone region as the first national park in 1872. Moran's paintings along with Jackson's photographs revealed the scale and splendor of the beautiful Yellowstone region where written or oral descriptions failed, persuading President Grant and the US Congress that Yellowstone was to be preserved. Moran's impact on Yellowstone was great, but Yellowstone had a significant influence on the artist, too. His first national recognition as an artist, as well as his first large financial success, resulted from his connection with Yellowstone. He even adopted a new signature: T-Y-M, Thomas \\"Yellowstone\\" Moran. Just one year after his introduction to the area, Moran captured the imagination of the American public with his first enormous painting of a far-western natural wonder, The Grand Canyon of the Yellowstone, which the government purchased in 1872 for $10,000.Richard P. Townsend, Thomas Moran at Gilcrease ‚Äì Moran and the European Tradition, Gilcrease Journal, vol. 5, no.1, Spring/Summer 1997. For the next two decades, he published his work in various periodicals and created hundreds of large paintings. Among these, The Grand Canyon of the Yellowstone (1872) and Chasm of the Colorado (1873‚Äì74) are exhibited at the U.S. Department of the Interior Museum. Over the next forty years Moran traveled extensively. He went back to Yellowstone with Jackson in 1892. They were invited by Elwood Mead, the state engineer of Wyoming, in preparation for a \\"Wyoming Exhibition\\" at the World's Columbian Exposition. Thousands of tourists were now able to visit the park, arriving by the Northern Pacific Railway, and Moran and Jackson were able to take advantage of the tourist facilities, such as a hotel at Mammoth Hot Springs. Moran wrote \\"After a day at Norris we left for the Grand Canyon where we stayed two days and made a great many photos. I saw so much to sketch that I have determined to return there myself after I have been to the Geyser Basins and the lake and spend a week at work there. It is as glorious in color as ever and I was completely carried away by its magnificence. I think I can paint a better picture of it than the old one after I have made my sketches.\\" Moran sketched many more images of the Canyon on this trip than he had in 1871, including views from the viewpoint named for him on the 1871 trip, \\"Moran Point.\\" The Grand Canyon of the Yellowstone (1893‚Äì1901) is on view at the Smithsonian American Art Museum. Moran was elected to the membership of the National Academy of Design in 1884 and produced numerous works of art in his senior years.

Symbols of 800 years of monarchy,Mears, et al., p. 5. the coronation regalia are the only working set in Europe ‚Äì secular ceremonies have replaced coronations in other European monarchiesMorris, p. 27. ‚Äì and the collection is the most historically complete of any regalia in the world.Keay, dust jacket. Objects used to invest and crown the monarch variously denote his or her roles as head of state, Supreme Governor of the Church of England, and head of the British armed forces. They feature heraldic devices and national emblems of England, Scotland, Wales and Northern Ireland, and recent pieces were designed to reflect the monarch's role as Head of the Commonwealth. Use of regalia by monarchs in England can be traced back to when it was converted to Christianity in the Middle Ages. A permanent set of coronation regalia, once belonging to Edward the Confessor, was established after he was made a saint in the 12th century. They were holy relics kept at Westminster Abbey ‚Äì venue of coronations since 1066. Another set was used at religious feasts and State Openings of Parliament. Collectively, these objects came to be known as the Jewels of the Crown. Most of the present collection dates from around 350 years ago when Charles II ascended the throne. The medieval and Tudor regalia had been sold or melted down after the monarchy was abolished in 1649 during the English Civil War. Only four original items pre-date the Restoration: a late 12th-century anointing spoon (the oldest object) and three early 17th- century swords. Upon the Acts of Union 1707, the English Crown Jewels were adopted by British monarchs; the Scottish regalia are known today as the Honours of Scotland. The regalia contain 23,578 stones, among them Cullinan I (), the largest clear cut diamond in the world, set in the Sovereign's Sceptre with Cross. It was cut from the largest gem-quality rough diamond ever found, the Cullinan, discovered in South Africa in 1905 and presented to Edward VII. On the Imperial State Crown are Cullinan II (), the Stuart Sapphire, St Edward's Sapphire, and the Black Prince's Ruby ‚Äì a large spinel given to Edward the Black Prince by a Spanish king in 1367. The Koh-i-Noor diamond (), originally from India, was forfeited to Queen Victoria and has featured on three consort crowns. A small number of historical objects at the Tower are either empty or set with glass and crystals. At a coronation the monarch is anointed using holy oil poured from an ampulla into the spoon, invested with robes and ornaments, and crowned with St Edward's Crown. Afterwards, it is exchanged for the lighter Imperial State Crown, which is also usually worn at State Openings of Parliament. Wives of kings are invested with a plainer set of regalia, and since 1831 a new crown has been made specially for each queen consort. Also regarded as crown jewels are state swords, trumpets, ceremonial maces, church plate, historical regalia, banqueting plate, and royal christening fonts. They are part of the Royal Collection and belong to the institution of monarchy, passing from one sovereign to the next. When not in use the Jewels are on public display in the Jewel House and Martin Tower where they are seen by 2.5 million visitors every year. History =Early history= The earliest known use of a crown in Britain was discovered by archaeologists in 1988 in Deal, Kent, and dates to between 200 and 150 BC. A sword, brooch, ceremonial shield, and decorated bronze crown with a single arch, which sat directly on the head of its wearer, were found inside the tomb of the Mill Hill Warrior.Keay, p. 9. At this point, crowns were symbols of authority worn by religious and military leaders. Priests continued to use crowns following the Roman conquest of Britain in 43 AD.Parfitt, p. 86. A dig in a field at Hockwold cum Wilton, Norfolk, in 1957 revealed a bronze crown with two arches and depictions of male faces, dating from the period of Roman occupation.Twining, p. 102. =Middle Ages= King √Üthelstan presenting an illuminated manuscript to St Cuthbert, c. 930 By the early 5th century, the Romans had withdrawn from Britain, and the Angles and the Saxons settled. A heptarchy of new kingdoms began to emerge. One of the methods used by regional kings to solidify their authority over their territories was the use of ceremony and insignia.Keay, p. 12. The tomb of an unknown king ‚Äì evidence suggests it may be R√¶dwald of East Anglia ‚Äì at Sutton Hoo provides insight into the regalia of a pre-Christian Anglo-Saxon king.Barker, pp. 25‚Äì29. Inside the early 7th-century tomb discovered in 1939 was found the ornate Sutton Hoo helmet, comprising an iron cap, a neck guard, and a face mask, decorated with images of animals and warriors in copper-alloy and set with garnets. He was also buried with a heavy whetstone sceptre, on top of which is an iron ring surmounted by the figure of a stag; a decorated sword; and a ceremonial shield. In 597 a Benedictine monk had been sent by Pope Gregory I to start converting Pagan England to Christianity. The monk, Augustine, became the first Archbishop of Canterbury. Within two centuries, the ritual of anointing monarchs with holy oil and crowning them (initially with helmets) in a Christian ceremony had been established, and regalia took on a religious identity. There was still no permanent set of coronation regalia; each monarch generally had a new set made that was usually buried with him or her upon death.Keay, pp. 13‚Äì18. In 9th-century Europe, gold crowns in the Byzantine tradition were replacing bronze, and gold soon became the standard material for English royal crowns. √Üthelstan ascended the throne in 924 and united the various Anglo-Saxon kingdoms to form the Kingdom of England. In the earliest known depiction of an English king wearing a crown, he is shown presenting a copy of Bede's Life of St Cuthbert to the saint himself.Keay, p. 17. Until his reign, kings had been portrayed on coins wearing helmets and circlets,Steane, p. 31. or wreath-like diadems in the style of Roman emperor Constantine the Great. Whether or not they wore such an item is questionable. Edgar the Peaceful was the first English king to be crowned with an actual crown, and a sceptre was also introduced for his coronation in 973.Twining, p. 103. After crowns, sceptres were the most potent symbols of royal authority in medieval England.Steane, p. 14. Edward the Confessor Edward the Confessor is depicted on a throne and wearing a crown and holding a sceptre in the first scene of the Bayeux Tapestry.Hinton, p. 142. In 1066 Edward died without an heir, and William the Conqueror emerged as the first Norman king of England following his victory over the English at the Battle of Hastings. Wearing a crown became an important part of William I's efforts to cement his authority over his new territory and subjects.Keay, pp. 18‚Äì20. At his death in 1087, the Anglo-Saxon Chronicle reported: \\"[William] kept great state ‚Ä¶ He wore his crown three times a year as often as he was in England ‚Ä¶ He was so stern and relentless ‚Ä¶ we must not forget the good order he kept in the land\\".Nicholas, p. 220. Those crown-wearings were held on the religious festivals of Easter, Whitsun and Christmas.Steane, p. 71. First great seal of the Confessor In 1161 Edward the Confessor was made a saint, and objects connected with his reign became holy relics. The monks at his burial place of Westminster Abbey claimed that Edward had asked them to look after his regalia in perpetuity and they were to be used at the coronations of all future kings. A note to this effect is contained in an inventory of relics drawn up by a monk at the abbey in 1450, recording a tunicle, dalmatic, pallium, and other vestments; a gold sceptre, two rods, a gold crown, comb, and spoon; for the queen's coronation a crown and two rods; and for the Holy Communion a chalice of onyx stone and a paten made of gold ‚Äì all of which were considered precious relics.Strong, pp. 118‚Äì119. Although the Abbey's claim is likely to have been an exercise in self-promotion, and some of the regalia had probably been taken from Edward's grave when he was reinterred there, it became accepted as fact, thereby establishing the first known set of hereditary coronation regalia in Europe.Rose, p. 13. Westminster Abbey is owned by a monarch, and the regalia had always been royal property ‚Äì the abbots were mere custodians. In the following centuries some of these objects would fall out of use and the regalia would expand to include many others used or worn by monarchs and queens consort at coronations.Rose, p. 16. A crown referred to as St Edward's Crown is first recorded as having been used for the coronation of Henry III in 1220, and it appears to be the same crown worn by Edward. Being crowned and invested with regalia owned by a previous monarch who was also a saint reinforced the king's authority.Rose, p. 14. It was also wrongly thought to have been originally owned by Alfred the Great because an inscription on the lid of its box, translated from Latin, read: \\"This is the chief crown of the two, with which were crowned Kings Alfred, Edward and others\\".Holmes, p. 216. The crown would be used in many subsequent coronations until its eventual destruction 400 years later. Few descriptions survive, although one 17th- century historian noted that it was \\"ancient Work with Flowers, adorn'd with Stones of somewhat a plain setting\\",Holmes, p. 217. and an inventory described it as \\"gold wire-work set with slight stones and two little bells\\", weighing .Twining, p. 132. It had arches and may have been decorated with filigree and cloisonn√© enamels.Rose, p. 24. Also in the Royal Collection in this period was an item called a state crown. Together with other crowns, rings, and swords, it comprised the monarch's state regalia that were kept separate from the coronation regalia, mostly at the royal palaces.Keay, p. 22. Late Middle Ages The Stone of Scone in the Coronation Chair, 1859 The transferring of crowns symbolised the transfer of power between rulers. Following the defeat in 1282 of the Welsh prince Llewelyn ap Gruffydd by Edward I, the Welsh regalia, including the crown of the legendary King Arthur, were surrendered to England. According to the Chronicle of Aberconwy Abbey, \\"and so the glory of Wales and the Welsh was handed over to the kings of England\\".Williams, p. xxxii. After the invasion of Scotland in 1296, the Stone of Scone was sent to the Tower of London \\"in recognition\\", as the chronicler Walter of Guisborough put it, \\"of a kingdom surrendered and conquered\\".Breeze, et al., p. 201. It was fitted into a wooden chair, which came to be used for the investiture of kings of England, earning its reputation as the Coronation Chair. The Scottish regalia were also taken to London and offered at the shrine of Edward the Confessor;Breeze, et al., p. 216. Scotland eventually regained its independence. In Edward II's treasury in 1324 there were 10 crowns.Twining, p. 117. When Richard II was forced to abdicate in 1399, he symbolically handed St Edward's Crown to Henry IV, saying \\"I present and give to you this crown ‚Ä¶ and all the rights dependent on it\\".Steane, p. 34. Monarchs often pledged various items of state regalia as collateral for loans throughout the Middle Ages. Edward II pawned his Great Crown in Flanders. Three crowns and other jewels were held by the Bishop of London and the Earl of Arundel as security for ¬£10,000 in the 1370s.Steane, p. 35. One crown was handed over to the Corporation of London in exchange for a ¬£4,000 loan in 1386. Sometimes objects were temporarily released from pawn by mayors, knights, peers, bankers, and other wealthy subjects in both England and continental Europe for the king to use at state occasions, then returned after the ceremony. Kings also distributed plate and jewels to their troops in lieu of money.Collins, p. 75. At some point in the 14th century, all of the state regalia were moved to the White Tower at the Tower of London owing to a series of successful and attempted thefts in Westminster Abbey. The holy relics of the coronation regalia stayed behind intact at the Abbey.Keay, pp. 33‚Äì34. After a long absence, two arches topped with a monde and cross were added to new images of St Edward's Crown by the time of Henry IV and to the state crown during the reign of his successor Henry V, though arches did not feature on the Great Seal until 1471.Collins, p. 11. Known as a closed or imperial crown, the arches and cross symbolised the king's pretensions of being an emperor of his own domain, subservient to no one but God, unlike some continental rulers who owed fealty to more powerful kings or the Holy Roman Emperor.Dale Hoak in Hoak, \\"The iconography of the crown imperial\\", pp. 55, 63. =Tudor and early Stuart periods= The traditions established in the medieval period continued later. By the middle of the 15th century, a crown was formally worn on six religious feasts every year: Christmas, Epiphany, Easter, Whitsun, All Saints' Day, and one or both feasts of St Edward.Keay, pp. 27‚Äì28. A crown was displayed and worn at the annual State Opening of Parliament,David Dean in Hoak, \\"Image and ritual in the Tudor parliaments\\", p. 243. and three were placed on the heads of monarchs at a coronation: St Edward's Crown, the state crown, and a \\"rich crown\\" made specially for the king or queen.Arnold, pp. 731‚Äì732. Elizabeth I, c. 1600 Around this time, three swords ‚Äì symbols of kingship since ancient times ‚Äì were being used in the coronation ceremony to represent the king's powers in the administration of justice: the Sword of Spiritual Justice, the Sword of Temporal Justice, and the blunt Sword of Mercy.Keay, p. 30. An emerging item of regalia was the orb, described in Tudor inventories as a round ball with a cross of gold,Keay, p. 32. which underlined the monarch's sovereignty. Orbs had been pictorial emblems of royal authority in England since the early Middle Ages but a real orb was probably not used at any English coronation until that of Henry VIII in 1509.Rose, pp. 44‚Äì45. After the English Reformation, the Church of England denounced the veneration of medieval relics, and starting with the coronation of Edward VI in 1547, the significance of St Edward's regalia was downplayed in the ceremony.Ronald Lightbown in MacGregor, \\"The King's Regalia, Insignia and Jewellery\\", p. 257. State regalia increasingly passed from one king to the next. The best known example of this was Henry VIII's Crown. Its date of manufacture is unknown, but it was probably created at the beginning of the Tudor dynasty, maybe in the reign of Henry VII. The concept of hereditary state regalia was enshrined in English law when James I decreed in 1605: \\"Roiall and Princely ornaments and Jewells to be indyvidually and inseparably for ever hereafter annexed to the Kingdome of this Realme\\". After James died in 1625, Charles I succeeded to the throne. Desperate for money, one of his first acts as king was to load 41 masterpieces from the Jewel House onto a ship bound for Amsterdam ‚Äì the hub of Europe's jewel trade. This hoard of unique bejewelled pieces, like the Mirror of Great Britain, the 14th-century pendant known as The Three Brothers, a gold salt cellar known as the Morris Dance, and much fine Elizabethan plate, was expected to swell the king's coffers by ¬£300,000, but they fetched ¬£70,000.Philippa Glanville in Abramova and Dmitrieva, \\"The Goldsmiths and the Court: Silver in London 1600‚Äì65\\", p. 52; Collins, p. 168. Charles's many conflicts with Parliament, stemming from his belief in the divine right of kings and the many religious conflicts that pervaded his reign, triggered the English Civil War in 1642.Keay, pp. 37‚Äì38. Parliament deemed the regalia as \\"Jewels of the Crown\\", vested in the monarch because of his public role as king, and not owned by him personally.Barker, p. 46. To avoid putting his own subjects at risk, Charles and his wife once again raised money by exporting royal jewels at a heavy discount. On learning of the king's scheme, both Houses of Parliament declared traffickers of the Crown Jewels to be enemies of the state.Barker, pp. 48‚Äì49. Just two years later, Parliament seized of rare silver-gilt pieces from the Jewel House, which included a royal christening font, and used them to bankroll its own side of the war.Philippa Glanville in Abramova and Dmitrieva, \\"The Goldsmiths and the Court: Silver in London 1600‚Äì65\\", p. 54. =Interregnum= Charles I standing beside Henry VIII's Crown and a gold orb and sceptre, 1631 After six years of war, Charles was defeated and executed in 1649. Less than a week after the king's execution, the Rump Parliament voted to abolish the monarchy. The newly created English Republic found itself short of money. To raise funds, the Act for the Sale of the Goods and Personal Estate of the Late King, Queen and Prince was brought into law, and trustees were appointed to value the Jewels ‚Äì then regarded by Oliver Cromwell as \\"symbolic of the detestable rule of kings\\"Mears, et al., p. 6. and \\"monuments of superstition and idolatry\\"Rose, p. 17. ‚Äì and sell them to the highest bidder. The most valuable object was Henry VIII's Crown, valued at ¬£1,100.Keay, pp. 40‚Äì41. Their gemstones and pearls removed, most of the coronation and state regalia were melted down, and the gold was struck into hundreds of coins by the Mint.Keay, p. 43. Two nuptial crowns, the Crown of Margaret of York and the Crown of Princess Blanche, survived as they had been taken out of England centuries before the Civil War when Margaret and Blanche married kings in continental Europe. Both crowns and the 9th-century Alfred Jewel give a sense of the character of royal jewellery in England in the Middle Ages.Keay, pp. 20‚Äì21. Another rare survivor is the 600-year-old Crystal Sceptre, a gift from Henry V to the Lord Mayor of London, who still bears it at coronations. Many pieces of English plate had been presented to visiting dignitaries and can be seen in museums throughout Europe.Collins, p. 196. The Scottish regalia of Charles II, who was crowned King of Scotland in 1651, also survive even though Cromwell made an attempt to seize and destroy them. In England, Cromwell declined invitations by Parliament to be made king and became Lord Protector. It was marked by a ceremony in Westminster Hall in 1657, where he donned purple robes, sat on the Coronation Chair, and was invested with many traditional symbols of sovereignty, except a crown.Barker, pp. 57‚Äì58. A crown‚Äîperhaps made of gilded base metal, as was typical of funerary crowns in those days‚Äîwas placed beside Cromwell at his lying in state in 1660.Barclay, pp. 157‚Äì159. =Restoration to present day= The monarchy was restored after Cromwell's death. For the English coronation of Charles II, who had been living in exile abroad,Rose, p 18. new Jewels were made based on records of the lost items. They were supplied by the banker and Royal Goldsmith, Sir Robert Vyner, at a cost of ¬£12,184 7s 2d ‚Äì as much as three warships. It was decided to fashion the replicas as much as possible like the medieval regalia and to use the original names. These 22-carat gold objects, made in 1660 and 1661, form the nucleus of the Crown Jewels today: St Edward's Crown, two sceptres, an orb, an ampulla for the holy anointing oil, a pair of spurs, a pair of armills or bracelets, and a walking stick. A medieval silver- gilt anointing spoon and three swords survived and were returned to the Crown,Dixon-Smith, et al., p. 7. and the Dutch ambassador arranged the return of extant jewels pawned in Holland.Collins, p. 12. The king spent additional money on of altar and banqueting plate, and he was presented with conciliatory gifts.Philippa Glanville in Abramova and Dmitrieva, \\"The Goldsmiths and the Court: Silver in London 1600‚Äì65\\", p. 56. Thomas Blood making his escape, drawn 1793 In 1669 the Jewels went on public display for the first time in the Jewel House at the Tower of London. The Deputy Keeper of the Jewel House took the regalia out of a cupboard and showed it to visitors for a small fee.Mears, et al., pp. 46‚Äì47. This informal arrangement was ended two years later when Thomas Blood, an Irish-born army officer loyal to Parliament, attacked the 77-year-old and stole a crown, a sceptre, and an orb. Blood and his three accomplices were apprehended at the castle perimeter, but the crown had been flattened with a mallet in an attempt to conceal it, and there was a dent in the orb.Hammond, p. 20. He was pardoned by the king, who also gave him land and a pension; it has been suggested that Blood was treated leniently because he was a government spy.Rose, p. 20. Ever since, the Jewels have been protected by armed guards.Barker, p. 66. Since the Restoration, there have been many additions and alterations to the regalia. A new set was commissioned in 1685 for Mary of Modena, the first queen consort to be crowned since the Restoration, Charles II having been unmarried when he took the throne. Another, more elaborate set had to be made four years later when Mary II was crowned as joint sovereign with her husband William III. After the Acts of Union 1707 joined England and Scotland together, the Scottish Crown Jewels were locked away in a chest,Douglas S. Mack in McCracken-Flesher, \\"Can the Scottish Subaltern Speak? Nonelite Scotland and the Scottish Parliament\\", p. 145. and the English Crown Jewels continued to be used by British monarchs. Gemstones were hired for coronations ‚Äì the fee typically being 4% of their value ‚Äì and replaced with glass and crystals for display in the Jewel House, a practice that continued until the early 20th century. During the Second World War the Crown Jewels were stored in the basement of Windsor Castle.Aronson, p. 81. The most valuable gems, such as the Koh-i-Noor and Cullinan diamonds, were sealed in a biscuit tin and hidden in the basement, allowing them to be recovered swiftly. After the war, the Jewels were kept in a vault at the Bank of England for two years while the Jewel House was repaired. The Tower had been struck by a bomb.Hennessy, p. 237. In 1953 St Edward's Crown was placed on the head of Elizabeth II in what is now the only ceremony of its kind in Europe. Today, 142 objects make up the Crown Jewels, which are permanently set with 23,578 precious and semi-precious stones, and they are seen by around 2.5 million visitors every year. Crowns Crowns are the main symbols of royal authority.Rose, p. 22. All crowns in the Tower are decorated with alternating crosses patt√©e and fleurs-de-lis, a pattern which first appears on the great seal of Richard III, and their arches are surmounted with a monde and cross patt√©e. Most of them also have a red or purple velvet cap and an ermine border. =St Edward's Crown= The centrepiece of the coronation regalia is named after Edward the Confessor and is placed on the monarch's head at the moment of crowning.Mears, et al., p. 23. Made of gold and completed in 1661, St Edward's Crown is embellished with 444 stones, including amethysts, garnets, peridots, rubies, sapphires, topazes, tourmalines and zircons. The crown was fashioned to closely resemble the medieval one, with a heavy gold base and clusters of semi-precious stones, but the disproportionately large arches are a Baroque affectation.Holmes, p. 220. It was long assumed to be the original as their weight is almost identical, and an invoice was produced in 1661 for the addition of gold to an existing crown. In 2008 new research found that a coronation crown had been made in 1660, and it was enhanced the following year when Parliament increased the budget for Charles II's delayed coronation.Barclay, pp. 150, 151, 167. The crown is tall, and at a weight of has been noted to be extremely heavy. After 1689, monarchs chose to be crowned with a lighter, bespoke coronation crown (e.g., that of George IVDixon-Smith, et al., p. 61.) or their state crown, while St Edward's Crown rested on the high altar. The tradition of using St Edward's Crown was revived in 1911 for the coronation of George V. In 1953 Elizabeth II opted for a stylised image of this crown to be used on coats of arms, badges, logos and various other insignia in the Commonwealth realms to symbolise her royal authority. It replaced the image of a Tudor-style crown adopted in 1901 by Edward VII. =Imperial State Crown= Imperial State Crown A much lighter crown is worn by the monarch when leaving Westminster Abbey, and at the annual State Opening of Parliament.Mears, et al., p. 29. The current Imperial State Crown was made in 1937 for George VI and is a copy of the one made in 1838 for Queen Victoria, which had fallen into a poor state of repair,Keay, pp. 174‚Äì175. and had been made using gems from its own predecessor, the State Crown of George I.Dixon-Smith, et al., p. 30. In 1953 the crown was resized to fit Elizabeth II, and the arches were lowered by to give it a more feminine appearance.Keay, p. 183. The gold, silver and platinum crown is decorated with 2,868 diamonds, 273 pearls, 17 sapphires, 11 emeralds and 5 rubies. Among the largest stones are the Cullinan II diamond, also known as the Second Star of Africa, added to the crown in 1909. The Black Prince's Ruby, set in the front cross, is a large spinel given to Edward the Black Prince by a Spanish king in 1367 and worn by Henry V at the Battle of Agincourt in 1415.Mears, et al., p. 30. How the stone found its way back into the Royal Collection after the Interregnum is unclear, but a substantial ruby was acquired for the Crown Jewels in 1661 at a cost of ¬£400, and this may well have been the Black Prince's Ruby.Olivia Fryman in Bird and Clayton, \\"Ceremony and Coronation\\", p. 102. On the crown's back is the Stuart Sapphire, and in the top cross is St Edward's Sapphire, reputedly taken from the ring of the Confessor when his body was re-interred at the Abbey in 1163. Below the monde hang four pearls, three of which are often said to have belonged to Elizabeth I, but the association is almost certainly erroneous.Dixon-Smith, et al., p. 38. =Consort crowns= After the Restoration, wives of kings ‚Äì queens consort ‚Äì traditionally wore the Crown of Mary of Modena, wife of James II, who first wore it at their coronation in 1685. Originally set with 561 hired diamonds and 129 pearls, it is now set with crystals and cultured pearls for display in the Jewel House along with a matching diadem that consorts wore in procession to the Abbey. The diadem once held 177 diamonds, 1 ruby, 1 sapphire, and 1 emerald.Mears, et al., p. 25. By the 19th century, the crown was judged to be too theatrical and in a poor state of repair, so the Crown of Queen Adelaide was made for the wife of William IV to wear in 1831 using gemstones from her own collection of jewellery.Keay, p. 137. Queen Mary's Crown Thus began a tradition of each queen consort having a crown made specially for her.Dixon-Smith, et al., p. 50. In 1902 the Crown of Queen Alexandra, a European-style crown ‚Äì flatter and with eight half-arches instead of the traditional four ‚Äì was made for Queen Alexandra, wife of Edward VII, to wear at their coronation. Set with over 3,000 diamonds, it was the first consort crown to include the Koh-i-Noor diamond presented to Queen Victoria in 1850 following the British conquest of the Punjab. Originally and set in an armlet, it was cut down to an oval brilliant weighing , which Victoria mounted in a brooch and circlet.Keay, pp. 164‚Äì166. The second was Queen Mary's Crown; also unusual for a British crown in having eight half-arches, it was made in 1911 for the coronation of Queen Mary and George V. It contains 2,200 diamonds and has contained Cullinans III and IV. In 1914 both stones and the Koh-i-Noor were replaced with crystal replicas and the arches were made detachable so it could be worn as an open crown.Mears, et al., p. 27. Mary paid for the Art Deco-inspired crown and originally hoped that it would be used by future queens consort.Keay, p. 175. After George V died, Mary continued wearing the crown (without its arches) as a queen mother, and so the Crown of Queen Elizabeth was made for Queen Elizabeth, wife of George VI and later known as the Queen Mother, to wear at their coronation in 1937.Twining, p. 167. It is the only British crown to be made entirely of platinum, and was modelled on Queen Mary's Crown, but has the usual four half-arches instead of eight.Keay, p. 178. The crown is decorated with about 2,800 diamonds, most notably the Koh-i-Noor in the middle of the front cross. It also contains a replica of the Lahore Diamond given to Queen Victoria by the East India Company in 1851,Allison and Riddell, p. 134. and a diamond given to her by Abd√ºlmecid I, Sultan of the Ottoman Empire, in 1856. Elizabeth last wore it as an open crown at the coronation of her daughter Elizabeth II in 1953. The crown was laid on top of Elizabeth's coffin during her lying in state and funeral in 2002. =Prince of Wales coronets= Prince Frederick A relatively modest coronet was made in 1728 for Frederick, Prince of Wales, the eldest son of George II. It takes the form laid down in a royal warrant issued by Charles II, which states that the heir apparent of the Crown shall use and bear a coronet of crosses and fleurs-de-lis with one arch surmounted by a ball and cross. The single arch denotes inferiority to the monarch and shows that the prince outranks other royal children, whose coronets have no arches.Boutell, p. 205. Frederick never wore his gold coronet; instead, it was placed on a cushion in front of him when he first took his seat in the House of Lords. It was used by his son, George III, then his son, George IV, and was last used by Edward VII when he was Prince of Wales.Mears, et al., p. 31. Due to its age, a new silver-gilt coronet was made for his son, the future George V, to wear at Edward's coronation in 1902. In contrast to the earlier coronet, which has a depressed arch, the arch on this one is raised. At George's own coronation in 1911, the coronet was worn by his son, Edward, the next Prince of Wales. After he became king in 1936, Edward VIII abdicated later the same year and, as the Duke of Windsor, went into exile in France, taking the 1902 coronet with him; it remained abroad until his death in 1972. In its absence, another coronet had to be made for the investiture of Prince Charles in 1969,Mears, et al., p. 24. which was exhibited for many years at the National Museum of Wales alongside the other Honours of Wales (a rod, ring, and sword made for the 1911 investiture and also used in 1969); the coronet and rod were both added to the Jewel House in 2020. =Non-coronation crowns= In the Jewel House there are two crowns that were not intended to be used at a coronation. Queen Victoria's Small Diamond Crown is just tall, and was made in 1870 using 1,187 diamonds for Victoria to wear on top of her widow's cap. She often wore it at State Openings of Parliament in place of the much heavier Imperial State Crown. After the queen's death in 1901 the crown passed to her daughter-in-law Queen Alexandra and later to Queen Mary. The Imperial Crown of India was created in 1911 when George V visited the Delhi Durbar with Queen Mary to be proclaimed (but not crowned) as Emperor of India. Since the British constitution prohibits the removal of Crown Jewels from the United Kingdom, a new crown had to be made for the event, with emeralds, rubies, sapphires and 6,100 diamonds. It has not been used since and is now a part of the Crown Jewels.Mears, et al., p. 33. Processional objects A coronation begins with the procession into Westminster Abbey.Mears, et al., p. 7. =Swords= Left to right: The Sword of Offering, the Sword of State, and the Sword of Mercy The swords of state reflect a monarch's role as Commander-in-Chief of the British Armed Forces and Defender of the Faith.Rose, pp. 46‚Äì47. Three are carried before the monarch into the Abbey: the blunt Sword of Mercy (also known as Curtana), the Sword of Spiritual Justice, and the Sword of Temporal Justice. All are believed to have been supplied at the time of James I between 1610 and 1620, probably by a member of the Worshipful Company of Cutlers,Strong, p. 268. using blades created in the 1580s by Italian bladesmiths Giandonato and Andrea Ferrara. They were deposited with St Edward's regalia at the Abbey by Charles II; before then, new swords had been made for each coronation since the 15th century. Sold in the civil war, they were returned at the Restoration, and their first recorded use was at the coronation of James II in 1685. Two other swords are used. The two-handed Sword of State, made in 1678 ‚Äì a 1660 sword was last used in the 18th century ‚Äì symbolises the monarch's royal authority. It is also carried before the monarch at State Openings of Parliament.Keay, pp. 96‚Äì97. Its wooden sheath, made in 1689, is bound in crimson velvet decorated with silver-gilt emblems of England, Scotland and Ireland, fleurs- de-lis and portcullises.Twining, p. 172. The lion of England and unicorn of Scotland form the cross-piece to the sword's handle. Before the investiture, it is exchanged for the principal Sword of Offering, of which the Sword of State is a metaphor. Commissioned by George IV for his 1821 coronation, its gilded leather sheath is encrusted with 1,251 diamonds, 16 rubies, 2 sapphires and 2 turquoises. The sword has a Damascus steel blade and is set with 2,141 diamonds, 12 emeralds and 4 rubies.Rose, pp. 49‚Äì51. The precious stones are arranged to form roses, thistles, shamrocks, oak leaves and acorns. Two diamond lion heads, one at each end of the cross-piece, have ruby eyes.Keay, p. 127. George paid more than ¬£5,000 for the sword out of his own pocket in a radical change from the austere ¬£2 swords used by his 18th-century predecessors. It remained in personal ownership of the Royal family until 1903 when it was deposited with the Crown Jewels and has been used at every coronation since 1911. A monarch is girded and blessed using the sword, which is returned to the Keeper of the Jewel House by the Abbey for a token sum of ¬£5, and it is borne unsheathed for the rest of the ceremony. The defunct Irish Sword of State, made in 1660, was held by the Lord Lieutenant of Ireland (a viceroy) prior to Ireland's independence from the United Kingdom in 1922, and also resides at the Tower of London. Its handle takes the form of a lion and a unicorn and is decorated with a celtic harp. Each new viceroy was invested with the sword at Dublin Castle, where it usually sat across the arms of a throne, representing the king or queen. It was borne in procession in front of monarchs upon their official visits to Dublin. In June 1921 the sword was present at the official opening by George V of the Parliament of Northern Ireland in Belfast. From September 2017 until April 2018 it was displayed at Dublin Castle as part of the 'Making Majesty' exhibition ‚Äì the first time it had been to Ireland in 95 years. =St Edward's Staff= St Edward's Staff is a gold walking stick made for Charles II in 1661. It has a plain monde and cross at the top and a steel pike at the bottom. This object is almost certainly a copy of the long rod of silver-gilt mentioned in the list of royal plate and jewels destroyed in 1649.Twining, p. 143. The staff's intended role in the coronation has been forgotten since medieval times, and so it is carried into the Abbey by a peer as a holy relic and laid on the altar, where it remains throughout the ceremony.Keay, p. 63. =Trumpets= Trumpeters and a mace bearer at the 1685 coronation of James II The Crown Jewels include 16 silver trumpets dating from between 1780 and 1848. Nine of these are draped with red silk damask banners embroidered with coats of arms in gold, originally made for the coronation of Queen Victoria in 1838. They have not been used since the Corps of State Trumpeters was disbanded as a cost-cutting measure in the 19th century.Mears, et al., p. 10. The trumpeters' main job was to sound a fanfare at key points in the coronation, and they also played at the banquet afterwards in Westminster Hall.Jones, p. 54. Today, the Band of the Household Cavalry and the Central Band of the Royal Air Force play their own trumpets at state occasions. =Maces= Beginning as lethal weapons of medieval knights, maces evolved into ceremonial objects carried by sergeants- at-arms and now represent a monarch's authority. The House of Commons can only operate lawfully when the royal mace ‚Äì dating from the reign of Charles II ‚Äì is present at the table. Two other maces dating from the reigns of Charles II and William III are used by the House of Lords: One is placed on the Woolsack before the house meets and is absent when a monarch is there in person. In the late 17th century there were 16 maces, but only 13 survive, 10 of which are on display at the Tower of London. Two of these are carried in the royal procession at State Openings of Parliament and coronations. Each mace is about long and weighs an average of .Mears, et al., p. 8. They are silver-gilt and were made between 1660 and 1695. Anointing objects When a monarch is anointed, the Dean of Westminster pours holy anointing oil from an ampulla into a spoon.King George's Jubilee Trust, p. 25. =Ampulla= The Ampulla The Ampulla, tall and weighing , is a hollow gold vessel made in 1661 and shaped like an eagle with outspread wings. Its head unscrews, enabling the vessel to be filled, and the oil exits via a hole in the beak. The original ampulla was a phial made of stone, sometimes worn as a pendant by kings, and otherwise kept inside a gold eagle.Rose, pp. 95‚Äì98. Fourteenth-century legend has it that the Virgin Mary appeared in front of Thomas Becket, Archbishop of Canterbury from 1162 until 1170, and presented to him a gold eagle and phial of oil for anointing English kings. This ampulla was first recorded as being used at the coronation of Henry IV in 1399 and was deposited for safekeeping with St Edward's regalia at the Abbey by Richard III in 1483. The same batch of oil was used to anoint all kings and queens (except Mary I) until it ran out in 1625. No one is quite sure why the vessel itself came to be reinterpreted as an eagle standing on a domed base after the Restoration. In terms of religious importance the anointing objects are second only to St Edward's Crown,Keay, p. 48. and in 2013 the ampulla was placed beside the crown on the altar of Westminster Abbey at a service marking the 60th anniversary of Elizabeth II's coronation. =Spoon= The Coronation Spoon, which dates from the late 12th century, is silver-gilt and set with four pearls added in the 17th century. A ridge divides the bowl in half, creating grooves into which the Archbishop of Canterbury dips two fingers and anoints the monarch, confirming him or her as Supreme Governor of the Church of England. Originally, the spoon may have been used for mixing water and wine in a chalice, and it is first known to have been used to anoint a monarch at the English coronation of James I in 1603. It is the oldest surviving piece of regalia, first recorded in the Royal Collection in 1349 as \\"a spoon of ancient form\\", and was probably made for Henry II or Richard I.Strong, pp. 78‚Äì79. In 1649 the spoon was sold to Clement Kynnersley, Yeoman of the Removing Wardrobe, who returned it to Charles II upon the restoration of the monarchy.Strong, p. 271. Robes and ornaments The anointing is followed by investment with coronation robes and ornaments. =Robes= Queen Victoria wearing a copy of the Imperial Mantle, now in the Museum of London, 1838 All the robes have priestly connotations and their form has changed little since the Middle Ages. A tradition of wearing St Edward's robes came to an end in 1547 after the English Reformation but was revived in 1603 by James I to emphasise his belief in the divine nature of kingship.Rose, pp. 99‚Äì100. As well as robes, a monarch also wore either cloth-of-gold buskins or sandals, depending on the size of his or her feet.Valerie Cumming in MacGregor, \\"'Great vanity and excesse in Apparell'. Some Clothing and Furs of Tudor and Stuart Royalty\\", p. 327. The holy relics were destroyed along with royal crowns and ornaments in the Civil War. New robes were made for each monarch starting with Charles II, a practice that ended in 1911, when George V wore the Supertunica (a dalmatic) and the Imperial Mantle (a cope), both made for George IV in 1821. The robes are of gold thread and together weigh approximately .Mears, et al., p. 14. They were also worn by his successors George VI and Elizabeth II. A new stole was made in 1953 for Elizabeth II by the Worshipful Company of Girdlers. It is adorned with floral emblems of Australia, Canada, Ceylon, India, New Zealand, and the four countries of the United Kingdom ‚Äì members of the Commonwealth, which is headed by the Queen.Cox, pp. 277‚Äì278. =Spurs= Prick spurs remade for Charles II are presented to the monarch. They are made of solid gold, richly embossed with floral patterns and scrolls, and have straps of crimson velvet embroidered in gold. Both necks terminate in a Tudor rose with a spike at its centre. Also known as St George's Spurs, they are one of the emblems of knighthood and chivalry, and denote the sovereign's role as head of the Armed Forces. Gold spurs are first known to have been used in 1189 at the coronation of Richard I, though it is likely they were introduced for Henry the Young King in 1170, and this element of the service was probably inspired by the initiation ceremony of knights. A pair of mid 14th-century spurs were added to St Edward's regalia at the Abbey in 1399 and used at all coronations until they were destroyed in 1649.Rose, pp. 50‚Äì52. Historically, spurs were fastened to a monarch's feet, but since the Restoration they are simply brushed against the heels of kings or shown to queens.Dixon-Smith, et al., p. 22. =Armills= The Armills are gold bracelets of sincerity and wisdom.Barker, p. 94. Like spurs, they were first used at English coronations in the 12th century.Rose, p. 52. By the 17th century, armills were no longer delivered to the monarch, but simply carried at the coronation. A new pair had to be made in 1661; they are wide, in diameter, and champlev√© enamelled on the surface with roses, thistles and harps ‚Äì the national symbols of England, Scotland and Ireland ‚Äì as well as fleurs-de-lis. For Elizabeth II's coronation in 1953, the medieval tradition was revived, and a new set of plain 22-karat gold armills lined with crimson velvet was presented to the Queen on behalf of various Commonwealth governments. Each bracelet is fitted with an invisible hinge and a clasp in the form of a Tudor rose. The hallmark includes a tiny portrait of the Queen,Twining, p. 171. who continued to wear the armills on leaving the Abbey and could be seen wearing them later, with the Imperial State Crown and Sovereign's Ring, at her appearance on the balcony of Buckingham Palace.Mears, et al., p. 17. =Orbs= Sovereign's Orb An orb, a type of globus cruciger, was first used at an English coronation by Henry VIII in 1509 and then by all subsequent monarchs apart from the early Stuart kings James I and Charles I, who opted for the medieval coronation order. The Tudor orb was deposited with St Edward's regalia at Westminster Abbey in 1625.Rose, p. 45. Today the Sovereign's Orb is a hollow gold sphere about in diameter and weighing (more than twice as heavy as the original) made for Charles II in 1661.Mears, et al., p. 19. A band of gems and pearls runs along the equator and there is a half-band on the top hemisphere. Atop the orb is an amethyst surmounted by a jewelled cross, symbolising the Christian world, with a sapphire on one side and an emerald on the other. Altogether, the orb is decorated with 375 pearls, 365 diamonds, 18 rubies, 9 emeralds, 9 sapphires, 1 amethyst and 1 piece of glass.Rose, p. 42. It is handed to the sovereign during the investiture rite of the coronation and is borne later in the left hand when leaving Westminster Abbey.King George's Jubilee Trust, pp. 26, 31. A small version, originally set with hired gems, was made in 1689 for Mary II to hold at her joint coronation with William III; it was never used again at a coronation and is now set with imitation gems and cultured pearls. The orb is in diameter and weighs . Both orbs were laid on Queen Victoria's coffin at her state funeral in 1901. Officially, no reason was given for using Mary II's orb, but it may have been intended to reflect Victoria's position as Empress of India.Twining, p. 173. =Rings= The Sovereign's Ring has been used by all monarchs from William IV in 1831 to Elizabeth II in 1953, with the exception of Queen Victoria, whose fingers were too small to retain it. In the centre is an octagonal sapphire overlaid with a cross made of rubies. Around the sapphire are 14 brilliant diamonds. The general design is intended to represent the red St George's Cross on the blue background of St Andrew's Cross. Rubies symbolise all the kingly virtues and have featured on coronation rings since the early Middle Ages.Rose, p. 26. A small copy was made for Victoria, who wrote in a letter: \\"The Archbishop had (most awkwardly) put the ring on the wrong finger, and the consequence was that I had the greatest difficulty to take it off again, which I at last did with great pain\\".Hibbert, p. 35. Her jewellers had measured the wrong finger.Rose, p. 107. In 1919 it was deposited at the Tower along with the Sovereign's Ring and Queen Consort's Ring, which all wives of kings have worn from Queen Adelaide onwards. Before 1831 monarchs generally received a new ring to symbolise their \\"marriage\\" to the nation. Richard II offered Westminster Abbey a \\"solemn jewel, a gold ring set with a precious stone called a ruby, of no small value\\" to be worn by his successors. Evidence suggests it was used at the coronation of Henry V.Oman, p. 49. Another possible exception was the Stuart Coronation Ring, probably used at the English coronations of Charles I and Charles II, and certainly that of James II, who took it into exile with him in France after the Glorious Revolution in 1688. It returned to the United Kingdom 100 years later and is now part of the Royal Collection of Gems and Jewels. The ring has a large ruby etched with a St George's Cross and bordered by 26 diamonds. Since 1830 it has been on permanent loan from Windsor Castle to Edinburgh Castle where it is displayed with the Honours of Scotland.Piacenti and Boardman, pp. 199‚Äì200. Mary II's personal coronation ring survives in the Portland Collection at Welbeck Abbey.Arts Council of Great Britain, p. 58. =Sceptres= Head of Sovereign's Sceptre with Cross The sceptre, a symbolic ornamental rod held by the monarch at a coronation, is derived from the shepherd's staff via the crozier of a bishop.Steane, p. 36. Two gold sceptres made in 1661 are part of the coronation regalia. The Sovereign's Sceptre with Cross is a token of his or her temporal power as head of state. The whole object is long, weighs around , and is decorated with 333 diamonds, 31 rubies, 15 emeralds, 7 sapphires, 6 spinels and 1 composite amethyst.Rose, p. 41. In 1910 it was redesigned to incorporate Cullinan I, also known as the Great Star of Africa, which, at over , is still the largest clear cut diamond in the world. It was part of a rough diamond weighing found in South Africa in 1905 and was named after the chairman of the mining company, Thomas Cullinan. The gold clasps holding it can be opened and the stone removed to be worn as a pendant hanging from Cullinan II, which is set in the Imperial State Crown, to form a brooch ‚Äì Queen Mary, wife of George V, often wore it like this. Above the pear-shaped diamond is the amethyst surmounted by a cross patt√©e encrusted with an emerald and small diamonds. The Sovereign's Sceptre with Dove, which also has been known as the Rod of Equity and Mercy, is emblematic of his or her spiritual role. It is a bit longer at but weighs about the same as the Sceptre with Cross. The sceptre is decorated with 285 gemstones, including 94 diamonds, 53 rubies, 10 emeralds, 4 sapphires and 3 spinels. Circling the rod are bands of precious stones. At the top is a gold monde set with diamonds and topped by a plain cross, upon which sits a white enamelled dove with its wings outspread, representing the Holy Ghost. A sceptre like this first appeared in the 11th century, and it was probably based on the German sceptre, which was topped by an Imperial Eagle. The Sceptre with Dove is the penultimate piece of regalia to be delivered. As the monarch holds both sceptres, he or she is crowned with St Edward's Crown. The Crown Jewels include two sceptres made for Mary of Modena, the wife of James II, in 1685: a gold sceptre with a cross known as the Queen Consort's Sceptre with Cross and another topped by a dove known as the Queen Consort's Ivory Rod with Dove, which, as the name suggests, is made of ivory. Unlike the sovereign's dove, this one has folded wings and is relatively small. It was last used by Queen Elizabeth, later known as the Queen Mother, at the coronation of her husband George VI in 1937. For the coronation of Mary II, the wife and joint sovereign of William III, a more elaborate gold sceptre with dove was commissioned in 1689. It has not been used since, and went missing for several decades, only to be found in 1814 at the back of a cupboard in the Tower of London. Altar plate Altar dishes behind George V at his coronation in 1911 In the Jewel House there is a collection of chalices, patens, flagons, candlesticks and dishes ‚Äì all silver- gilt except five gold communion vessels ‚Äì that are displayed on the high altar or in front of the royal box at Westminster Abbey during coronations. Some are also used at other times.Mears, et al., p. 34. Although most are not held by monarchs, such items are Crown Jewels by virtue of their long association with the Jewel House. One of the most striking pieces is a large dish across and weighing , in the centre of which is a relief depiction of the Last Supper. Around the edge are four engravings of biblical scenes: the Washing of the Feet, the Walk to Emmaus, the Coming of the Holy Ghost, and Christ's Commission to the Apostles. Made in 1664 for James, Duke of York, and later acquired by Charles II, it stands on the high altar during a coronation ceremony. At each end of the altar stands a tall candlestick made in the 17th century, which is engraved all over with scrolls, leaves and flowers, and they were also used at the lying in state of Edward VII at Buckingham Palace in 1910.Mears, et al., pp. 35‚Äì36. An altar dish and flagon were made in 1691 for the royal Church of St Peter ad Vincula at the Tower of London. The dish measures across; it also has a depiction of the Last Supper, below which is the coat of arms of co-regents William III and Mary II. The flagon stands tall. Both pieces are still used in the chapel on Easter, Whitsun and Christmas, and they were first displayed at a coronation in 1821.Dixon-Smith, et al., p. 64. Another dish still in regular use is the Maundy Dish ‚Äì one of six used by the Queen at Royal Maundy for handing out alms to elderly people in recognition of their service to the church and local community. The ceremony, which takes place in a different cathedral every year, entirely replaced the ancient custom of washing the feet of the poor in 1730, and the dish, though it bears the royal cypher of William and Mary, dates from the reign of Charles II. Two purses containing specially minted coins are taken from the dish and presented to each recipient. Banqueting plate The last coronation banquet held at Westminster Hall took place in 1821 for George IV. Silverware used at those banquets include the Plymouth Fountain, a wine fountain made around 1640 by a German goldsmith and presented to Charles II by the city of Plymouth. Gilded for George II in 1726, it is tall and decorated with flowers, fruit, dolphins, mermaids and sea monsters. The nautical theme is continued in the silver-gilt Wine Cistern, also known as the Grand Punch Bowl, which is cast as a giant oyster shell. It weighs , is tall, long and wide, and can hold 144 bottles of wine on ice.Mears, et al., pp. 42‚Äì43. It was commissioned in 1829 by George IV but completed after his death. Weighing over a quarter of a ton, it is the heaviest surviving piece of English banqueting plate.Keay, p. 150. In 1841 the cistern was re-purposed as a punch bowl, with the addition of an ivory-stemmed ladle, which is long and has a silver-gilt bowl in the form of a nautilus shell. The Exeter Salt is a tall salt cellar in the form of a castle on a rocky outcrop. Each of its four main compartments, in the turrets, held about of salt, and smaller compartments in the walls held pepper and spices.Keay, p. 70. It was made 1630 in Germany and is set with 73 gems probably added later. The Salt was originally bought in Hamburg in 1657 by the city's British Resident as a peace offering to the Russian court, which had cut all ties with Britain during the Interregnum. He was turned away at the border and eventually took it back to London. In 1660 it was acquired from a private dealer for ¬£700 by the city of Exeter and presented to Charles II.Olivia Fryman in Bird and Clayton, \\"Ceremony and Coronation\\", p. 82. Eleven smaller salts named after St George were originally made for a St George's Day banquet of the Knights of the Garter and Charles II in the 17th century. Each one is topped with a small figure of a knight on horseback. Another, the Queen Elizabeth Salt, was made in 1572 during the reign of Elizabeth I for a member of the aristocracy; it was acquired by Charles II. Twelve spoons made for George IV in 1820 complement the salts.Mears, et al., pp. 39‚Äì40. Baptismal plate Edward, Prince of Wales, 1842 Three silver-gilt objects which have been used at royal christenings are displayed in the Jewel House. Charles II's marriage to Catherine of Braganza produced no heir, but a font and basin made in 1661 may have been used to baptise some of his 13 illegitimate children.Mears, et al., p. 44. The font stands tall, and the whole objects weighs . Its domed lid is surmounted by a figure of Philip the Evangelist baptising the Ethiopian eunuch. It was last used to baptise Princess Charlotte of Wales (child of the future George IV) in 1796, and the basin found a new role as an altar dish in the 19th century, while the font was used as a plinth for the Lily Font. A christening ewer and basin made in 1735 were used at the christening of the future George III in 1738. His father, Frederick, Prince of Wales, had been banished from the royal court by George II and was forbidden to use the Charles II Font. An inscription at the front of the ewer records its use at the christening of George III's son, Prince Alfred, in 1780. The handle of the ewer is topped by a figure of Hercules slaying the Hydra, symbolising the triumph of virtue over vice; it stands tall. The Lily Font was made in 1840 for the christening of Victoria, Princess Royal, the first child of Queen Victoria, who declined to use the Charles II Font because of its unseemly history. The font is decorated with water lilies, symbolising purity and new life, and cherubs plucking lyres. It has been used for the christenings of all of Elizabeth II's children and grandchildren except Princess Eugenie, with holy water from the River Jordan. The font stands tall and weighs approximately . Ownership, management and value The Crown Jewels are part of the Royal Collection. As with Royal palaces, ownership is regarded as inalienable and passes from one monarch to the next.Bogdanor, p. 190. However, a 17th-century ruling by Sir Edward Coke, which states \\"the ancient jewels of the crown are heirloomes and shall descend to the next successor and are not devisable by testament\\", contains an exception allowing the monarch to dispose of objects via letters patent.Ronald Lightbown in MacGregor, \\"The King's Regalia, Insignia and Jewellery\\", p. 259. In practice it is unlikely the Crown Jewels will ever be sold, nor are they insured against loss, and are officially priceless. Their maintenance falls to the Crown Jeweller, a member of the Royal Household who cleans them after visiting hours at the Tower of London each January. The jeweller also accompanies the regalia and plate when they leave the Tower. Older items are cleaned by experts from the British Museum.Hoey, p. 64. The Royal Collection Trust keeps an inventory of the regalia, and Historic Royal Palaces is responsible for their display.Hoey, p. 197.

He is the son of Steven and Gabrielle Deschain and is descended from a long line of \\"gunslingers\\", peacekeepers and diplomats of Roland's society. Fictional biography =Background= Roland becomes a gunslinger at the unheard-of age of 14 after being manipulated into taking the \\"trial of manhood\\" by Marten Broadcloak, his father's adviser and alias of Randall Flagg. Marten has an affair with Roland's mother and makes sure Roland finds out about it, prompting Roland to request his trial in order to gain his guns and exact revenge on Marten. In the trial, Roland must defeat his teacher, Cort, using a weapon of his choosing. He chooses a hawk named David and defeats Cort. Roland sacrifices David to win the fight, setting the tone for Roland's future choices in life. Despite Roland's victory, Cort and Roland's father convince Roland to bide his time before seeking retribution. Not long after, Roland's father sends him on a mission to the town of Hambry in the Outer Barony of Mejis with his friends Alain Johns and Cuthbert Allgood, who will form the basis of his first ka-tet. While there, he meets Susan Delgado, whom he falls in love with. He also comes into the possession of a pink crystal ball, one of 13 magical artifacts referred to as \\"Maerlyn's Rainbow.\\" It was while looking into this artifact that Roland first discovered his destiny to quest for the Dark Tower. Roland is a 30th-generation descendant of his world's version of King Arthur, referred to in the series as Arthur Eld. In Wizard and Glass, during a flashback to Roland's time in the Barony of Mejis, a letter from his father identifies Steven Deschain as a 29th-generation descendant of Arthur Eld from a side lineage (that is to say, from one of Arthur's many \\"gillies,\\" or concubines). Even his guns were originally made of the melted-down metal from the legendary Excalibur sword. It is hinted that one must possess this sword, or another sign of the Eld (the line of Arthur Eld) in order to open the door at the foot of the Tower. According to a supplemental prose story by Robin Furth included in The Dark Tower: The Gunslinger Born (issues #7 & #2, respectively), Roland's ancestry traces back to Arthur Eld and Emmanuelle Deschain, the daughter of his seneschal, Kay Deschain, while the Crimson King's ancestry traces back to an affair between Arthur and the Crimson Queen. =Quest for the Dark Tower= Roland on the cover of the comic The Dark Tower: The Gunslinger Born #1. Roland is alone at the beginning of the series, following the way of ka, a variant of destiny. The term ka-tet is used for a group of people who are deeply bonded to one another through ka. The eight-book series is about Roland's acquisition of a new ka-tet and the completion of his quest. Roland is the last surviving gunslinger and is possessed (or, as he describes it himself, \\"addicted\\") by a quest to reach The Dark Tower, the axis upon which infinite numbers of parallel worlds rotate. (Eddie Dean, an ex-heroin addict and member of Roland's ka-tet, calls Roland a \\"Tower junkie.\\") The Dark Tower is under assault by the Crimson King, Lord of Discordia, a Satanic figure bent on destroying the Dark Tower by undermining the \\"Beams\\" that support it. In the first novel, The Dark Tower: The Gunslinger, Roland's original desire is simply to climb to the Dark Tower's top to question whatever god dwells there, but ka has greater plans for him. The ka-tet he acquires during the series bears many resemblances to his childhood ka-tet, who were all killed trying to help Roland on his quest. How he treats his new ka-tet when faced with decisions between their lives and his quest is a key component of the novels. Ultimately, his ka-tet represents a chance for redemption and a means by which he can ultimately change his own ka. At the end of the seventh novel, it is revealed that he is trapped in a repetitive reincarnation, his \\"damnation\\" for his crimes and killings (similar to Stephen King's short story \\"That Feeling, You Can Only Say What It Is in French\\", in which he expresses that his idea of hell is repetition.) However, it is also suggested that this eternal repetition is not quite eternal; after his rebirth at the end of the novel, it is revealed that in this particular reiteration of his journey, he possesses the Horn of Eld which in his previous pilgrimages he had lost in the final stand at Jericho Hill, the one major element which was discrepant from his approach to the tower and Childe Roland's approach in Robert Browning's Childe Roland to the Dark Tower Came (\\"Dauntless the slug-horn to my lips I set...\\"). Relations with other characters Roland's chief enemy is Randall Flagg, a villain who appears in many of King's works. Flagg's character appears in many different incarnations throughout the series. He is a minion of the Crimson King himself, though he is ultimately hoping to overthrow him. He is often at the heart of most conflicts with Roland throughout the Gunslinger's lifetime. His relationships with his ka-tet change greatly over the course of the story. When he first 'draws' Eddie from the reader's world, Roland dislikes him for being a drug addict and constantly complaining about his plight. After Eddie beats his addiction, however, he starts to care for him more and more and eventually, Roland regards him as something between a son and a brother. His relationship with Susannah follows the same pattern: though he is initially wary of her second personality, Detta, after her personalities 'merge' into Susannah he gets to know her better and grows to care deeply for her. His relationship with Jake is perhaps the deepest, initially seeing the boy as a trustworthy and strong companion, but eventually regarding him as his true son. Roland, already scarred by the deaths of all his childhood friends ‚Äî who all died helping him to get closer to the tower ‚Äî he is shown to be emotionally devastated by Eddie's and especially Jake's death, weeping openly (something Eddie mentioned before did not happen often, if at all). Roland cries out all their names ‚Äî both his first and second Ka-Tet's ‚Äî when he reaches the door of the Dark Tower, along with other characters whom he cared for in some way or another: Susan Delgado, Roland's first (and only true) love, who was killed while he was in Mejis; Father Callahan, who was also a member of Roland's second Ka-Tet, albeit for a much shorter time; Hax the cook, whom Roland betrayed to the gunslingers because he was a traitor, something that deeply affected Roland; his teachers Cort and Vannay; his parents' names; the name of David the Hawk, whom Roland used in the trial for his revolvers; and the name of Aunt Talitha of River Crossing, whose cross he lays at the base of the tower. He also cries the names of Ted Brautigan and Dinky Earnshaw, two 'Breakers' who helped him and his friends greatly; the name of Sheemie Ruiz, one of Roland's longest-surviving friends; and that of Oy, the billy-bumbler, a ka-tet member who died saving Roland's life from Mordred Deschain. Characteristics Physically, Roland is described by most of his ka'tet as \\"old long, tall, and ugly\\" with \\"blue, bombadier's eyes.\\" He is described as tall and lanky, with a problematic hip that frequently troubled him yet doesn't mention to his travel companions. Emotionally, Roland at times appears detached or unsympathetic, often reacting with seeming indifference or anger at signs of cowardice or self-pity, yet he possesses a strong sense of heroism, often attempting to help those in need. He is shown to be emotionally scarred from the deaths of all his friends and family, often thinking about their words and actions, and he is said (on more than one occasion by himself) to lack imagination. He describes this trait as being \\"not very good in thinking around corners\\". He is nevertheless highly intelligent and perceptive, exemplified by his interest in riddles; though he enjoys hearing them, he usually overcomplicates the solution. Cuthbert, Roland's childhood best friend, once said the gears in Roland's head turn slow, but grind extremely well. Roland is impatient, especially when he is under stress, and often makes a rotating gesture with his hand, which means 'go on, hurry, move on' in conversations. Similarly, he prefers not to over- plan his actions, trusting in his instinct and skill at improvising according to the situation. He is also shown not to have a great sense of humor; despite his love for riddles, he rarely jokes and is visibly irritated at times when Eddie (and in the past, Cuthbert) joke around. In The Waste Lands, Susannah compares Roland first to Marshal Matt Dillon of Gunsmoke, but later comes to believe he is more like John F. Kennedy. While she acknowledges that Roland lacks the president's imagination, both men have similar levels of charisma, cunning, and romance. King often notes Roland's strong sense of romance in his narrations, but describes this aspect of the gunslinger's character as being usually hidden by his more dominant sense of pragmatism. Roland is also shown to care a great deal for his Ka-Tet, or \\"Companions in fate\\", and often puts himself at risk to save or assist them. When confronted with the choice between saving one of them or getting one step closer to the fabled Dark Tower of legend, Roland often, but not always, feels inclined to choose the Tower; however, many members of his Ka-Tets, both old and new, make the choice for him, suggesting the enormity of his quest. Roland carries a pair of revolvers, sometimes referred to as \\"the big guns\\" by other characters. They are described as long and heavy, with blued steel (originally from his world's Excalibur) and sandalwood grips. These guns are a major sigil, as they are recognized throughout Mid-World and are used as an identifier of Roland. During the search for more ammunition in New York City in The Drawing of the Three, the guns are revealed to be chambered close enough to .45 or the .45 Long Colt to use commercially available cartridges. In The Gunslinger Roland exhibits a technique for reloading his weapons at blinding speed, though it causes burns to his fingertips when done repeatedly in a short time. He loses this ability at the start of The Drawing of the Three when the first two fingers of his right hand are bitten off. Even after being crippled, he possesses almost superhuman accuracy and he can draw his guns faster than any other character. Roland is noted as being able to shoot equally well with both hands. In addition to being a master gunslinger, Roland is an experienced traveler, able to hunt, make his own clothes from the skins of animals, and navigate via the stars. Roland can speak five languages, including the High Speech and the Low Speech. He also possess a great deal of knowledge about ka and the nature of the world. Roland is also a skilled leader, diplomat, and teacher. There is a point during the second book at which Roland psychically bonds himself with a murderer named Jack Mort; the combination of the two personages is said to resemble the mannerisms of Arnold Schwarzenegger as he appeared in The Terminator. Eddie Dean sees Stephen King as a young man and recognizes that he and Roland share many of the same physical features, saying that Roland could be King's father.Song of Susannah, Stanza 11 \\"The Writer\\", Chapter 5 Some of his hair is grey or white, but some remains black. His facial features are described as rough (although Susannah once compared them to that of a tired poet; Eddie frequently refers to him as \\"old long tall and ugly\\"), and he has light blue eyes, often referred to by characters and Stephen King as \\"bombardier's eyes.\\" Roland lost his right big toe and his right index and middle fingers, which is problematic as he is right-handed in everything other than shooting. He is a strong and disciplined man, capable of working through injuries and illnesses that would have killed or incapacitated another man. Roland is also unusually tall; at 14, he stood taller than the 16-year-old Susan, and, as an adult, his height exceeds that of his father. In The Dark Tower he is described as having reached an adult height of roughly 6'3\\". In the last novel, it is implied that the gunslinger's mostly cold, ruthless nature is alleviated slightly every time he reaches the Dark Tower and begins his journey again‚ÄîWhilst his memories are erased, his personality changes in the reflection of the experiences of each quest. This is symbolised by his re-acquisition of the Horn of Eld after the version covered in the Dark Tower series, implying that he has learned some of the true values of family and love (and patience); he has clearly taken the horn from Cuthbert Allgood's body as he wished rather than leaving it there as he did before. Adaptations *In Frank Darabont's 2007 film adaptation of King's novella The Mist, the main character, David Drayton, can be seen painting a movie poster with Roland in the center, standing in front of a trans-dimensional Ironwood door, with a rose and the dark tower to each side. *Idris Elba portrays Roland in the 2017 film The Dark Tower. Actors Javier Bardem and Russell Crowe were previously considered for the role. *Sam Strike was cast as young Roland in the Amazon Prime adaptation of the series, The Dark Tower.

The UCI is based in Aigle, Switzerland. The UCI issues racing licenses to riders and enforces disciplinary rules, such as in matters of doping. The UCI also manages the classification of races and the points ranking system in various cycling disciplines including road and track cycling, mountain biking and BMX, for both men and women, amateur and professional. It also oversees the World Championships.  History  UCI was founded in 1900 in Paris by the national cycling sports organisations of Belgium, the United States, France, Italy, and Switzerland. It replaced the International Cycling Association (ICA) by setting up in opposition in a row over whether Great Britain should be allowed just one team at world championships or separate teams representing England, Ireland, Scotland and Wales. Britain found itself outflanked and it was not able to join the UCI ‚Äì under the conditions the UCI had imposed ‚Äì until 1903.The Bicycle, 16 September 1942, p6 There were originally 30 countries affiliated to the union. They did not have equal voting power and some had no vote at all. Votes were distributed by the number of tracks, or velodromes, that each nation claimed. France had 18 votes, the highest number, and Germany and Italy 14 each. Britain had eight, a number the writer Bill Mills said was acquired \\"by including many rather doubtful grass tracks.\\" In 1965, under the pressure of the IOC (the Olympics was then an amateur event), the UCI created two subsidiary bodies, the International Amateur Cycling Federation (F√©d√©ration Internationale Amateur de Cyclisme or FIAC) and the International Professional Cycling Federation (F√©d√©ration Internationale de Cyclisme Professionnel or FICP). The UCI assumed a role coordinating both bodies. The FIAC was based in Rome, the FICP in Luxembourg, and the UCI in Geneva. The FIAC was the bigger of the two organisations, with 127 member federations across all five continents. It was dominated by the countries of the Eastern bloc which were amateur. The FIAC arranged representation of cycling at the Olympic Games, and FIAC cyclists competed against FICP members on only rare occasions. In 1992, the UCI reunified the FIAC and FICP, and merged them back into the UCI. The combined organisation then relocated to Aigle, close to the IOC in Lausanne. In 2004, the UCI constructed a 200-metre velodrome at the new World Cycling Centre adjacent to its headquarters. In September 2007 the UCI announced that it had decided to award ProTour status for the first time ever to an event outside of Europe; the Tour Down Under in Adelaide, Australia. The announcement followed negotiations between UCI President Pat McQuaid and South Australian Premier Mike Rann.\\"ProTour Heads Down Under\\", Cycling News, 28 September 2007 In 2013 Tracey Gaudry became the first woman appointed as vice president of the UCI. World championships The UCI organises cycling's world championships, administration of which it gives to member nations. The first championships were on the road and on the track. They were allocated originally to member nations in turn, on condition the country was deemed competent and that it could guarantee ticket sales. A nation given a championship or series of championships was required to pay the UCI 30 per cent of ticket receipts from the track and 10 per cent from the road. Of this, the UCI kept 30 per cent and gave the rest to competing nations in proportion to the number of events in which it competed. The highest gate money in this pre-war era was 600 000 francs in Paris in 1903.The Bicycle, 16 September 1942, p7 There were originally five championships: amateur and professional sprint, amateur and professional road race, and professional Motor-paced racing. The road race was traditionally a massed start but did not have to be: Britain organised its road championship before the war as a time trial, the National Cyclists Union believing it best to run races against the clock, and without publicity before the start, to avoid police attention. Continental European organisers generally preferred massed races on circuits, fenced throughout or along the finish to charge for entry. =Records= The original records were on the track: unpaced, human-paced and mechanically paced. They were promoted for three classes of bicycle: solos, tandems and unusual machines such as what are now known as recumbents, on which the rider lies horizontal. Distances were imperial and metric, from 440 yards and 500 metres to 24 hours. The UCI banned recumbents in competitions and in record attempts on 1 April 1934. Later changes included restrictions on riding positions of the sort that affected Graeme Obree in the 1990s and the banning in 2000 of all frames that did not have a seat tube. = Rainbow jersey = The winner of a UCI World Championship title is awarded a rainbow jersey, white with five coloured bands on the chest. This jersey can be worn in only the discipline, specialty and category of competition in which it was awarded, and expires on the day before the following world championship event. Former champions are permitted to wear rainbow piping on the cuffs and collar of their clothing. Secretariat The Union Cycliste Internationale headquarters in Aigle, Switzerland = Presidents = Controversies = Helmet use in road racing = For decades, professional road cyclists refused to wear helmets. The first serious attempt by the UCI to introduce compulsory helmet use was the 1991 Paris‚ÄìNice race, which resulted in a riders' strike, and UCI abandoned the idea. After the death of Andrei Kivilev in the 2003 Paris‚ÄìNice, new rules were introduced on 5 May 2003, with the 2003 Giro d'Italia being the first major race affected. The 2003 rules allowed for discarding the helmets during final climbs of at least 5 kilometres in length; subsequent revisions made helmet use mandatory at all times. = Bribery and doping = The UCI was accused of accepting a bribe in the 1990s to introduce the keirin, a track cycling race, into the Olympics. An investigation by the BBC claims that the UCI was paid approximately $3,000,000 by Japanese sources to add the race to the Olympic programme, something denied by the UCI. When Floyd Landis confessed to using performance-enhancing drugs throughout his career in May 2010, he alleged that the UCI had accepted a bribe from Lance Armstrong to cover up an EPO positive after the 2001 Tour de Suisse. Discussing doping in 2012, UCI president Pat McQuaid emphasised the fact that his organisation was \\"the first entity to introduce blood tests, the first sport to introduce the test for EPO\\". In November 2013, Armstrong settled a lawsuit with Acceptance Insurance Company (AIC). AIC had sought to recover $3 million it had paid Armstrong as bonuses for winning the Tour de France from 1999‚Äì2001. The suit was settled for an undisclosed sum one day before Armstrong was scheduled to give an oral deposition under oath. In a sworn, written deposition for the lawsuit, Armstrong stated, \\"Armstrong has not paid or offered to pay someone to keep his or others' doping a secret. However, Armstrong has, on occasion, provided benefits or made contributions to many people and institutions, some of whom may have been aware of, or suspected Armstrong's use of performance-enhancing drugs and banned methods. Armstrong never provided any such benefits or contributions with the intent for it to be a payoff to keep doping a secret.\\"Schrotenboer, Brent, \\"Lance Armstrong named names under oath\\", USA Today, 10 April 2014\\"Lance Armstrong Reveals Names in Lawsuit\\", New York Times, 10 April 2014 = Doping and defamation lawsuits = The UCI has sued or threatened to sue several cyclists, journalists, and writers for defamation after they accused it of corruption or other misdeeds related to doping.UCI's failure to silence LeMond Daniel Benson and Susan Westemeyer, 4 October 2012 Many, though not all, of these suits are heard in the Est Vaudois district court of Vevey, SwitzerlandVaughters defends Kimmage ahead of UCI case, Daniel Benson, cyclingnews.com, 28 September 2012 In 2002 UCI sued Festina soigneur Willy Voet over claims in his book Breaking the Chain.News for 10 March 2002, cyclingnews.com, Edited by Jeff Jones, section \\"UCI wants damages from Voet\\". retr 2012 10 22 In 2004 the UCI won the case,UCI wins legal battle against Voet Anthony Tan, cyclingnews.com, 20 May 2006, Updated: 20 April 2009, retr 2012 10 22 and in 2006 won the appeal.

Disciplines =Road racing=  Men  On top of having organized the Road World Championships since 1921, from 1989 until 2004, the UCI administered the UCI Road World Cup, a season-long competition incorporating all the major one-day professional road races. In 2005 this was replaced by the UCI ProTour series which initially included the Grand Tour road cycling stage races (the Tour de France, Giro d'Italia and Vuelta a Espa√±a) and a wider range of other one-day and stage races. However, the three Grand Tour races withdrew from the series, and in July 2008 all the major professional teams threatened to quit the series, putting its future in doubt. The ProTour was replaced as a ranking system the following year by the UCI World Ranking, which added the three Grand Tours, two early season stage races, and five more one-day classics to the 14 remaining ProTour events. To expand the participation and popularity of professional road bicycle racing throughout the globe, the UCI develop a series of races collectively known as the UCI Continental Circuits for each region of the world.  Women  The highest level teams in women's road cycling are the UCI Women's Teams. The UCI has supported elite level competition for women since 1959 including the crowning of a Women's World Cycling Champion (Road Race) and beginning in 1994, honoring a Women's World Time Trial Champion at the women's time trial event. Since 2012 UCI Women's teams compete at the World Championships in the women's team time trial event Since 1998, the UCI Women's Road World Cup has served as a season-long competition of elite-level one-day and stage race events. =Track cycling= The UCI Track Cycling World Championships for men and women offers individual and team championships in several track cycling disciplines.

In addition, a series of single-day events are held each year to determine the Cyclo-cross World Champion at the UCI Cyclo-cross World Championships. =Mountain bike racing= In mountain bike racing, the UCI Mountain Bike & Trials World Championships is the most important and prestigious competition each year. This includes the disciplines of cross- country and downhill. In addition, this event consists of world championship events for bike trials riding. In 2012 the first cross-country eliminator world championship was held in Saalfelden. 2012 Eliminator UCI World Championship The UCI Mountain Bike World Cup is a series of races, held annually since 1991.

Reles later turned government witness and sent several members of Murder, Inc. to the electric chair. Reles's death from falling through a window while in police custody might have been a hit placed by the American Mafia, as he was set to testify against Mangano crime family underboss and future boss Albert Anastasia. Early years Abraham Reles, the son of Austrian Jewishhttp://www.britannica.com/eb/article-9063132/Abe-Reles Abe Reles immigrants, was born in the Brownsville section of Brooklyn, New York, on May 10, 1906. His father worked in one of the garment trades until sometime during the Great Depression. His father's last known occupation was peddling knishes on the streets of Brownsville. His full formal Hebrew name was Elkanah ben Shimon. Reles attended school through the eighth grade. After leaving school, he began hanging out at pool rooms and candy stores in and around Brownsville. He soon teamed up with two of his childhood friends, Martin \\"Buggsy\\" Goldstein and Harry \\"Pittsburgh Phil\\" Strauss, who eventually rose to power with him in the group conventionally known as Murder, Inc. His first arrest came in 1921 for stealing $2 worth of gum from a vending machine, and he was sent to the Children's Village at Dobbs Ferry, New York, for four months. Reles's small physical size did not deter him from committing ruthless acts of violence. When carrying out murders, his weapon of choice was an ice pick, which he would ram through his victim's ear right into the brain. Reles became so adept at using the ice pick that many of his murder victims were thought to have died of a cerebral hemorrhage. Reles became known as a particularly cold- blooded and psychopathic murderer. On one occasion, in broad daylight, he attacked a worker at a car wash for failing to clean a smudge from the fender of his car.Cummings and Volkman 1992, p. 36 Another time, Reles killed a parking lot attendant for failing to fetch his car fast enough. On another occasion, he brought a guest to his mother-in-law's home for supper. When his mother-in-law retired after the meal, Reles and another gang member murdered the guest and then removed the body. Reles reportedly got the nickname \\"Kid Twist\\" after an earlier New York City Jewish gangster, Max \\"Kid Twist\\" Zwerbach. Another theory behind the moniker is that it was the name of his favorite candy. Yet another theory is that the nickname described his method for strangling people. Reles was a bootlegger who rarely touched alcohol. Reles lived at 649 East 91st Street in Brooklyn before moving to 9102 Avenue A, also in Brooklyn. Prohibition and Murder, Inc. During the Prohibition days of the 1920s, while still teenagers, Reles and Goldstein went to work for the Shapiro brothers, who ran the Brooklyn rackets. Soon Reles and Goldstein were committing petty crimes for the brothers. On one such occasion, Reles was caught and sentenced to two years in an upstate New York juvenile institution. The Shapiro brothers failed to help Reles, prompting Reles to plan revenge. After his release, Reles, Goldstein, and George Defeo entered the slot machine business, the province of the Shapiro Brothers. Through Defeo's connections, Reles and Goldstein were able to make a deal with the influential crime lord Meyer Lansky, who wanted access to the poorer neighborhoods of Brooklyn and thus agreed. Both parties prospered: Lansky was able to get sizable footholds in Brownsville, East New York, and Ocean Hill, while Reles gained the backing he needed to keep both his business and himself alive. Reles, Goldstein, and Strauss were partners in all of their criminal activities, which had primarily been the slot machine business and quickly expanded to include loan sharking, crap games, and labor slugging in connection with union activities, especially the restaurant union. The slot machine business thrived and soon Reles and Goldstein were on the Shapiros' hit list. One night, the two men received a phone call from a \\"friend\\" saying that the Shapiros had left their East New York headquarters. Hopping into a car with Defeo, they headed to East New York. However, when they reached the Shapiro's building, the three men were ambushed. Reles and Goldstein were wounded, but all three managed to escape. In the meantime, Meyer Shapiro abducted Reles' girlfriend and dragged her to an open field, where he beat and raped her. Revenge against Shapiro Brothers To avenge the ambush and his girlfriend's rape, Reles enlisted the help of fellow Murder, Inc. killers Frank \\"Dasher\\" Abbandando and Harry \\"Happy\\" Maione. The two killers were glad to help: they hoped to kill the Shapiro brothers and take over some of their operations. After several futile attempts by each side to eradicate the other, the Murder, Inc. group finally caught up with Irving Shapiro. On that occasion, Reles dragged Irving from the hallway of his home out into the street. Reles beat, kicked, and then shot Irving numerous times, killing him. Two months later, Reles met Meyer Shapiro on the street and killed him by shooting him in the face. Another three years elapsed before Reles finally got the last Shapiro brother, William. William was abducted off the street and taken to a gang hideout. Once there, he was beaten nearly to death, stuffed into a sack, and driven out to the Canarsie section of Brooklyn and buried. Before the gang could finish burying William, a passerby spotted them and they had to flee the scene. William Shapiro's body was exhumed shortly thereafter, and after being autopsied it was determined that he had been buried alive. Government informant In 1940, Reles was implicated in a number of killings. Realizing that he faced execution if convicted, Reles became a government witness. Reles implicated his boss Lepke Buchalter in the murder of Brooklyn candy store owner Joseph Rosen; Buchalter was eventually convicted and executed for this crime. Reles's information also implicated Louis Capone, Mendy Weiss, Harry Maione, Harry Strauss, Frank Abbandando, Irving (\\"Knadles\\" and \\"the Plug\\") Nitzberg, and even his own childhood friend \\"Buggsy\\" Goldstein. All except Nitzberg were eventually convicted and executed. Reles' next target was Albert Anastasia, who had been co-chief of operations of Murder, Inc. Reles was to implicate Anastasia in the murder of union longshoreman Pete Panto. However, unlike other members of Murder, Inc., Anastasia was a high-ranking member of the Cosa Nostra. The trial, based solely on Reles' testimony, was set for November 12, 1941. Until then, Reles was under constant guard by police detectives at the Half Moon Hotel in Coney Island. Death In the early morning of November 12, 1941, with police guarding the door, Reles fell to his death from a window in room 623 at the Half Moon Hotel.Profile, nyu.edu; accessed July 9, 2017. It appeared he may have been trying to lower himself to the fifth floor window underneath using two bedsheets tied together and then to a four-foot length of wire that had been attached to a valve in his room. However, the wire knot to the valve came undone, and he fell to a second floor outdoor landing, and newspapers dubbed him \\"The Canary Who Could Sing, But Couldn't Fly\\". The following day, five police officers who had been guarding him were demoted. There was widespread speculation that he had been thrown or pushed out of the window and the room had been arranged to look like he was trying to escape. Reles had shown no inclination to escape from protective custody and indeed had demonstrated a fear of even being out of earshot of the police. On the day of his death he was to have testified against Anastasia, a high-ranking member of the Cosa Nostra, and the trial was based solely on Reles's testimony. Frank Costello reportedly raised $100,000 to bribe these guards to kill Reles. In 2005 evidence was reported that NYPD Detective Charles Burns, one of Reles's police bodyguards, was involved in the disappearance and probable murder of NYC anti-corruption judge Joseph Force Crater in 1930. However, in 1951 a grand jury concluded Reles died accidentally during an attempted escape. Reles is buried in Old Mount Carmel Cemetery in Glendale, Queens. Notes References * Rockaway, Robert A.

Gerald Durrell founded the Jersey Wildlife Preservation Trust as a charitable institution in 1963 with the dodo as its symbol. The trust was renamed Durrell Wildlife Conservation Trust in its founder's honour on 26 March 1999. Its patron is Princess Anne, the Princess Royal. Its headquarters are at Les Augr√®s Manor on the isle of Jersey in the English Channel. The grounds of Les Augr√®s Manor form the Durrell Wildlife Park, which was originally established by Gerald Durrell in 1959 as a sanctuary and breeding centre for endangered species. The zoological park was known as the Jersey Zoo at that time. Gerald Durrell Gerald Durrell OBE, author and broadcaster on wildlife conservation, was the founder of the Durrell Wildlife Conservation Trust. He wrote 37 books which have been translated into 31 languages. He also featured in several other television series and one-off programmes, which documented his work in Jersey and around the world. In 1945 he became a student keeper at the Zoological Society of London's Whipsnade Park. At 21 he inherited ¬£3,000 and he financed, organised and led the first of several animal collecting expeditions. It was on these expeditions that he first became aware of the desperate struggle for survival many animal species were facing in the wild, and he became convinced that zoos had a responsibility to try to prevent further decline and extinctions. Despite strong resistance to his ideas from much of the zoological community as few people recognised the alarming rate at which animals were vanishing in their native habitats, in 1959 he succeeded in creating his own Zoo in Jersey, dedicating it to saving endangered animals from extinction. Gerald Durrell died aged 70, in January 1995. His wife Lee McGeorge Durrell succeeded him as Honorary Director of the Durrell Wildlife Conservation Trust and maintains an intense involvement in the Trust‚Äôs work both in Jersey and overseas. Jersey Durrell provides intensive hands-on management of endangered species at its Jersey headquarters and through 50 conservation programmes in 18 countries worldwide. Durrell‚Äôs headquarters in Jersey is a safe-haven for endangered animals which need to be rescued from whatever is threatening their survival in their native home. Here they breed and recover in numbers while keeper-conservationists observe and study them to learn more about what they will need to thrive in the wild again. The Trust‚Äôs headquarters is also a ‚Äòwindow‚Äô to the work of Durrell Wildlife around the world ‚Äì where visitors can enjoy the opportunity to see some of the planet‚Äôs most endangered species and learn how the Trust is working to save them. What keeper-conservationists learn about a species while it is living in Jersey can help to save its cousins struggling for survival in the wild. Some species, such as gorillas and orangutans, are well known while other species, such as the Livingstone's fruit bat, the pied tamarin, the giant jumping rat, the Madagascar teal (Bernier's teal), the echo parakeet (Mauritius parakeet), the mountain chicken (actually a giant frog), and Round Island boa, are more obscure. Other endangered animals include the aye-aye, Alaotran gentle lemur, free-ranging black lion tamarin, pied tamarin and silvery marmoset, Andean bear, maned wolf, narrow-striped mongoose, Mauritius pink pigeon, Mauritius kestrel, Saint Lucia amazon, Bali starling, Meller's duck, Madagascar teal (Bernier's teal), Round Island boa, Lesser Antillean iguana and Mallorcan midwife toad. Overseas activities Durrell worked with local governments, communities and other conservation organisations in countries across the globe to save animals and their environments. The Trust began working in Mauritius during the 1970s. In 1998 it announced that the Mauritius kestrel ‚Äì a species once reduced to only four birds ‚Äì had been saved from extinction. Durrell is also working to save critically endangered species such as the pink pigeon, echo parakeet, Round Island boa (Casarea dussumieri) and Mauritius fody. It has also helped in the restoration of Round Island ‚Äì a small island about 12 miles north east of Mauritius. The Trust is managing several projects on the island of Madagascar, where it first became involved during the 1980s. Madagascar, like Mauritius, is home to many animals found nowhere else in the world. Project Angonoka is one of the successful breeding programmes that has seen the rarest tortoise in the world, the angonoka, brought back from the brink of extinction. One of the rarest ducks in the world, the Madagascar teal, is now breeding successfully at the Trust‚Äôs headquarters in Jersey, and the Alaotran gentle lemur is starting to make a recovery, now that hunting and burning of its habitat have been dramatically reduced thanks to an education programme targeted at local villages and schools. In the Menabe region of Madagascar, a biodiversity hotspot of great importance, the Trust is working with a cluster of endangered species, including the Malagasy giant rat, flat-tailed tortoise, Madagascar big-headed turtle, narrow-striped mongoose and Madagascar teal. In Brazil the Trust has played a major role in saving endangered lion tamarin, not only breeding them in captivity and reintroducing them into the wild, but with the purchase of a corridor of land to link two halves of a reserve where this species lives. The Trust is currently running an aluminium can recycling project in conjunction with local primary schools. The scheme is raising funds to purchase and plant trees in Brazil to create ‚Äòtree corridors‚Äô, to link up fragmented areas of the tamarins‚Äô habitat and allow isolated groups to reach each other and breed. In India the critically endangered pygmy hog is successfully breeding in a centre designed and built by the Trust. The Trust has also provided a safety net for two species living on the Caribbean island of Montserrat where a volcano erupted in 1995. The country's national bird, the Montserrat oriole (Icterus oberi), and the giant ditch frog (Leptodactylus fallax), are now living and breeding successfully in Jersey. Durrell's overseas projects in other Caribbean islands include the Lesser Antillean iguana (Iguana delicatissima) on Anguilla, the Antiguan racer (Alsophis antiguae) on Antigua, the Saint Lucia iguana (Iguana iguana), the Saint Lucia amazon (\\"Amazona versicolor\\") and Saint Lucia whiptail (Cnemidophorus vanzoi) on Saint Lucia, the blue iguana (Cyclura lewisi) on Grand Cayman, and the Cuban solenodon (Solenodon cubanus) on Cuba. Elsewhere in the world the Trust is working to save the Mallorcan midwife toad in Spain, the western lowland gorilla in Cameroon, the Sumatran orangutan in Sumatra, and Livingstone's fruit bat (Pteropus livingstonii) in the Comoros Islands. Conservation set- backs The Trust has endangered the Mallorcan midwife toad in Spain by introducing the pathogen, Batrachochytrium dendrobatidis. The pathogen causes chytridiomycosis, which is now recognised as a principal driver of the mass extinction crisis in amphibians. The Trust's breeding facility in Jersey, that had been used for re-introduction of the species to its native habitat, has been identified as the source of chytridiomycosis which affects the Mallorcan midwife toad. It is the first case, where it could be shown that the anthropogenic movement of amphibians is spreading the fatal disease. The trust were however, successful in the mitigation of the impact of chytridiomycosis after a large scale re-introduction programme, and thanks to the work of Durrell Wildlife Conservation Trust, the Mallorcan midwife toad became the only amphibian to be downgraded from Critically Endangered to Vulnerable. Islands and highlands In November 2003, in response to the ever-increasing threats to global biodiversity, the Trust unveiled plans for a re-focusing of its overseas activities. Two years of painstaking research have resulted in a global map which highlights where Durrell‚Äôs scientists believe the world‚Äôs ‚Äòconservation priority areas‚Äô are located. These areas, which tend to be located in island and highland regions, harbour unusually high concentrations of ‚Äòendemic‚Äô species ‚Äì rare species that are found in these areas and nowhere else. Whilst the new maps include many of the areas where the Trust is currently working, it also reveals several significant new areas, where the Trust has had no previous involvement. By using the new maps to guide the future development and expansion of its overseas conservation work, Durrell can be confident it is using its limited resources to the maximum benefit of the world‚Äôs precious biodiversity. International training centre In 1978 Gerald Durrell created what he called 'a mini-university' at Les Noyers, adjacent to Les Augr√®s Manor, to provide intensive training to conservation workers, so that they could begin the process of saving species in their country of origin. Today Durrell is internationally acclaimed for its contribution to the professional training of zoologists and conservation biologists, particularly those from the developing countries of the world. Over 3,500 students from more than 135 countries have now successfully graduated from the International Training Centre, to create a global network of ‚ÄúNew Noahs‚Äù dedicated to supporting the mission of the Trust. These graduates have gone on to train their colleagues at home, who in turn have trained the people they work with. This has created a highly effective network of good conservationists where they are most needed around the world. As of November 2012, the former International Training Centre will be renamed and re-branded as 'Durrell Conservation Academy', in homage to founder Gerald Durrell, and to reflect some of the prestige that the facility has grown to embody. The strapline 'Blending the art and science of conservation' is to be employed in communications, and can be taken as a mission statement. The first overseas branch of Durrell Conservation Academy is scheduled to open in Mauritius in late 2012. Animal health The good health of the animals in Jersey and at the Trust‚Äôs captive breeding centres overseas ensures breeding success, and the staff endeavour to ensure that diseases, parasites and injuries are prevented through excellent day-to-day care. The Trust‚Äôs Veterinary Centre, which opened in the grounds of the Trust in 1978, regularly monitors the health of all the animals in Jersey and overseas, and new arrivals from the wild or other zoos are kept in quarantine and isolation to safeguard the health of the resident animals. If an animal is sick, the Trust's on-site biologist examines samples of faeces, blood and urine for vital clues to diagnose the illness. If an animal dies, a post-mortem is carried out to establish the cause of death and also to increase the Trust's scientific knowledge and understanding of very rare species. Samples taken by specially trained staff are also sent in from the Trust‚Äôs in-situ breeding programmes, and a diagnosis and instructions for treatment from the vet are sent back by return. The Trust‚Äôs vet and veterinary biologist have both made visits to the captive breeding centre in Ampijoroa, Madagascar, where they spent time screening the captive populations of endangered tortoises and turtles, and training staff in effective sample taking and post-mortem techniques. Blood and tissue samples are preserved for posterity to ensure that the Trust has references for future research purposes. The veterinary hospital includes a consulting room, operating theatre and recovery area. It also has X-ray, ultrasound and endoscopic examination facilities. Major operations on the great apes are undertaken by a team of vets and doctors and consultants from Jersey's General Hospital. It is not unusual to find hospital anaesthetists, radiologists, obstetricians and paediatricians assisting the veterinary team. The Trust's animal registrar maintains records of births, deaths and exchanges between zoos of animals worldwide. The registrar receives daily reports on the breeding, behaviour, nutrition and health of the animals which are then recorded in a computer software programme called ARKS (Animal Records Keeping System). Over 600 zoos worldwide use ARKS and each institution submits its data to a central organisation, ISIS (International Species Information Systems), to create a global database which is shared by all participating zoos. In addition to general animal records, medical notes are maintained on all the animals in the collection in the same way that doctors keep notes on their patients. This information is stored in MedARKS, which is an adaptation of the ARKS database and can also be accessed by other zoos around the world. With regard to using the MedARKS system, Durrell Wildlife has been at the forefront of zoos in the British Isles, working closely with the American vets who designed it and running courses on the island to train other zoo practitioners to use it. The accuracy of the ARKS and MedARKS systems relies on animals being correctly identified. While it may be easy to identify the male gorilla Ya Kwanza within his family, identifying individual pink pigeons or poison arrow frogs is more difficult. An ID transponder or microchip, the size of a grain of rice, is placed under the skin by injection. It emits a ten digit alpha numeric code which is recognised by a scanning device. This also enables the Trust's Research Department to identify animals during studies. Most research involves the observation of animals, without disturbing them, and includes studies on general behaviour, on feeding and on parental care of offspring either in the Trust grounds or overseas. The Trust's aim is to understand every aspect of the lives of the animals at the Trust to ensure their successful management in captivity and enhance their survival in the wild. Durrell Wildlife Camp Work began on the Durrell Wildlife Camp in earnest in early 2012. The wooded copse to the west of Les Augres Manor, bordering on the 'Lemur Lake' enclosure housing a mixed population of ring-tailed lemurs, black and white ruffed lemurs and red- fronted brown lemurs to the southwest, has been extensively landscaped to provide a gentle slope with a nine-metre-square level wooden deck roughly every seven metres. These decks will house twelve geodesic dome-shaped 'pods' ‚Äì semi permanent tent structures ‚Äì and a separate shower and toilet cubicle for each. A further two platforms will house the 'Lemur Lodge' communal structure and a 'pamper pod' for holistic health and beauty treatments. Each pod contains a wood-burning stove and sleeps two adults and two children. Additional tipi-styled tents can be added to the platform, to sleep a further two children. Two of the pods will be designed with disabled access in mind, featuring hand rails, entry ramps and specially equipped WC, and placed on the most accessible part of the site. The facility will be eco-friendly in keeping with Durrell's policy on conservation; solar lamps will be used where possible, grey water recycled for use by the Trust's landscaping team, and all organic waste will be composted and re-used on the on-site organic farm. Durrell Wildlife Camp is described as a 'glamorous camping' or glamping resort, owing to the individual toilet and running water, private cooking facilities and decked, semi-permanent 'pod' accommodation. The whole site has high-speed WiFi coverage, and each pod has a hard wired electrical feed for running AC 240 V appliances. This sets it outside the remit of camping despite the use of tents as opposed to permanent buildings. The camp is a further vehicle for fundraising in support of the Trust's international conservation programmes. In combination with Durrell Wildlife Park and its associated restaurants and new visitor centre retail area, the Trust hopes to attract more tourists to Jersey, as the decline in tourism to the island over the last few years has affected the potential visitors numbers to the wildlife park. By offering a new and unique holiday option for non-residents, it is hoped the small increase in visitor numbers to Jersey in 2011, will be further supported, having a positive effect on the fund-raising ability of the wildlife park itself. Organic farm The Trust established its own organic farm before any establishment of its kind in the UK. The Durrell Organic Farm was created in 1976 to provide the animal collection with non-chemically treated foods such as sunflowers and maize. It provides 70% of the animals‚Äô fruit, vegetable and forage needs over the year ‚Äì produce which would otherwise cost the Trust well in excess of ¬£20,000 to buy in commercially. The Organic Farm grows edible flowers, such as calendula, sunflowers, hibiscus and pansies; fruit and vegetables such as cape gooseberries, tamarillos, tomatoes, cucumbers, lettuces, cabbages, peppers, beans, mustard, radishes, pumpkins and celery. It also provides hay and leaves, branches of hedgerow trees and ash, willow and bamboo for the Trust's animals. All bedding from the animal enclosures, along with everything from lawn cuttings to used teabags from the staff kitchens, is recycled to create for compost for the Organic Farm, so there is no need for chemical fertilisers. The nutritional value of organic farm home-grown foods is far superior to imported foods, and feeding whole plants to animals encourages them to forage as they would in the wild. For example, the gorillas and orangutans are given whole pea and bean plants rather than picked and prepared ‚Äòoven ready‚Äô type that we humans prefer. This means that the animals have to spend time picking through the plants to find the tasty pods, chewing on and discarding leaves, stems and roots along the way ‚Äì this type of foraging behaviour would make up much of their daily activity in the wild. Children‚Äôs programme Younger supporters of Durrell Wildlife can join the Dodo Club. As well as free entry to The Trust all year round, Dodo Club members receive a regular newsletter and colour poster, and can participate in our special Conservation Award scheme. The Conservation Education Department runs Activity Weeks during the school holidays, which consist of special conservation themed workshops where Dodo Club members can learn about conservation in a fun-filled environment. More details about the Dodo Club, including an on-line application form, can be found on the Trust‚Äôs website. The website also carries up-to-date information about upcoming Activity Week workshops and other children‚Äôs activities. The Trust also runs a schools‚Äô programme, which consists of various workshops based at the Trust, for five to 16-year-olds. The classroom can be transformed into an environment to complement a particular topic ‚Äì for example a scrubland or rainforest. School groups visiting from the UK and France are also catered to, by prior arrangement with the Conservation Education Department. As well as visiting Island schools, staff also run courses for the Island's GNVQ and BTEC students. Funders Significant financial support for the Durrell Wildlife Conservation Trust has been provided by the Harcroft Foundation. The Foundation was established by the late Charles Rycroft.

Apitherapy is a branch of alternative medicine that uses honey bee products, including honey, pollen, propolis, royal jelly and bee venom. Proponents of apitherapy make claims for its health benefits which are unsupported by evidence-based medicine.  History  References to medical properties of bee products can be found in Chinese, Korean, Russian, Egyptian and Greek traditional medicine practices. Apitherapy has been practiced since the times of Hippocrates and Galen. Modern use of bee venom appears to have originated with Austrian physician and his 1888 article \\"About a Peculiar Connection Between the Bee Stings and Rheumatism\\", but his claims were never tested in proper clinical trials. More recent alternative medicine practice is attributed to the Hungarian physician Bodog F. Beck who coined the term \\"bee venom therapy\\" in 1935, and to beekeeper Charles Mraz (1905‚Äì1999) in the latter half of the twentieth century. In 1957, the USSR Ministry of Health sanctioned use of bee venom to treat certain ailments by approval of Nikolay Artemov's \\"Instruction for Bee Sting Venom Apitherapy.\\"  Health claims  Apitherapy is promoted as alternative medicine for several uses, but its health claims are not supported by scientific evidence. Bee venom or other honeybee products are ineffective for the treatment or prevention of cancer. In general, evidence for using honey in wound treatment is of such low quality that firm conclusions cannot be drawn.  Risks  Adverse reactions to bee venom therapy are frequent. Frequent exposure to the venom can also lead to arthropathy. In sensitized persons, venom compounds can act as allergens, causing a spectrum of allergic reactions that can range from mild, local swelling to severe systemic reactions, anaphylactic shock, or even death. In March 2018 it was reported that a 55-year-old woman died after receiving \\"live bee acupuncture\\", suffering a severe anaphylactic episode which the apitherapy practitioner did not respond to by administering adrenaline. While stabilized by ambulance personnel on the way to the hospital, she died a few weeks later from complications resulting in multiple organ failure. Live bee acupuncture therapy is ‚Äúunsafe and unadvisable,‚Äù according to researchers who studied the case.

During the dictatorial reign of Sulla, the word took on a more sinister meaning. In 82 or 81 BC, Sulla instituted the process of proscription in order to avenge the massacres of Gaius Marius and his son. He instituted a notice for the sale of confiscated property belonging to those declared public enemies of the state (modern historians estimate about 520 people were proscribed as opposed to the ancient estimate of 4,700 people) and therefore condemned to death those proscribed, called proscripti in Latin. = Proscription and treason = There were multiple reasons why the ancient Roman government may have desired to proscribe or attribute multiple other forms of pain. One of the most prevalent reasons for punishment are treason crimes, also known as lex maiestatis. Treason crimes consisted of a very broad and large number of regulations, and such crimes had a negative effect on the government. This list includes, but is not limited to: assisting an enemy in any way, Crimen Laesae Majestasis, acts of subversion and usurpation, offense against the peace of the state, offenses against the administration of justice, and violating absolute duties. Overall, crimes in which the state, emperor, the state‚Äôs tranquility, or offenses against the good of the people would be considered treason, and, therefore, would constitute proscription. Some of these regulations are understandable and comparable to safety laws within the United States today; however, others, like violating absolute duties, could very easily be accidents or circumstantial crises that would deserve punishment regardless. Punishments for treason were quite harsh by today‚Äôs standards and were meant to highlight the seriousness and shamefulness of the treason crimes committed. There were a variety of punishments for capital crimes, including death, loss of a freedman‚Äôs status, loss of citizenship with a loss of family rights, and a loss of family rights only. Death was a very common punishment and was referred to as summum supplicium, or the \\"extreme penalty\\". The death sentence was often the punishment for all but the mildest forms of treason. Julius Caesar was an influential framer of the law on treason. The Interdiction from Water and Fire was a civil excommunication resulting in ultimate exile, which included forfeiture of citizenship and forfeiture of property. Those who were condemned would be deported to an island. Emperor Augustus frequently utilized this method of exile, as he desired to keep banished men from banding together in large groups. Such punishment was given for only the mildest forms of treason, in comparison to the death penalty, which served for most other treason crimes. Augustus also created the prefect, whose powers included the ability to banish, deport, or send to the mines. The prefect also heard appeals. = Proscription of Sulla in 82 BC = An early instance of mass proscription took place in 82 BC, when Lucius Cornelius Sulla was appointed dictator rei publicae constituendae (\\"Dictator for the Reconstitution of the Republic\\"). Sulla proceeded to have the Senate draw up a list of those he considered enemies of the state and published the list in the Roman Forum. Any man whose name appeared on the list was ipso facto stripped of his citizenship and excluded from all protection under law; reward money was given to any informer who gave information leading to the death of a proscribed man, and any person who killed a proscribed man was entitled to keep part of his estate (the remainder went to the state). No person could inherit money or property from proscribed men, nor could any woman married to a proscribed man remarry after his death. Many victims of proscription were decapitated and their heads were displayed on spears in the Forum. Sulla used proscription to restore the depleted Roman Treasury (Aerarium), which had been drained by costly civil and foreign wars in the preceding decade, and to eliminate enemies (both real and potential) of his reformed state and constitutions; the plutocratic knights of the Ordo Equester were particularly hard-hit. Giving the procedure a particularly sinister character in the public eye was the fact that many of the proscribed men, escorted from their homes at night by groups of men all named \\"Lucius Cornelius\\", never appeared again. (These men were all Sulla's freedmen.) This gave rise to a general fear of being taken from one's home at night as a consequence of any outwardly seditious behaviour. Sulla's proscription was bureaucratically overseen, and the names of informers and those who profited from killing proscribed men were entered into the public record. Because Roman law could criminalise acts ex post facto, many informers and profiteers were later prosecuted. The proscription of 82 BC was overseen by Sulla's freedman steward Lucius Cornelius Chrysogonus, and was rife with corruption. The proscription lists created by Sulla led to mass terror in Rome. During this time, \\"the cities of Italy became theaters of execution.\\" Citizens were terrified to find their names on the lists. Those whose names were listed were ultimately sentenced to death. The executions were brutal and consisted of beheading. Often, the heads were then put on display for the city to see. The bodies of the condemned were often mutilated and dragged before being thrown into the Tiber River. Additionally, those who were condemned lost rights even after their brutal death. Those killed were denied the right to a funeral, and all of their possessions were auctioned off, often to the ones who killed them. Negative consequences arose for anyone that chose to assist those on the list, despite not being listed on the proscribed lists themselves. Anyone who was found guilty of assisting the condemned was capitally punished. Families were also punished as a result of being related to one of the proscribed. It was forbidden to mourn the death of a proscribed person. According to Plutarch, the greatest injustice of all the consequences was stripping the rights of their children and grandchildren. While those proscribed and their loved ones faced harsh consequences, the people who assisted the government by killing any person on the proscription list were actually rewarded. =Proscription of 43 BC= The proscription of 43 BC was the second major proscription. It began with an agreement in November 43 between the triumvirs Octavian Caesar, Marcus Antonius, and Marcus Lepidus after two long meetings. Their aim was to avenge Julius Caesar‚Äôs assassination, eliminate political enemies, and acquire their properties. The proscription was aimed at Julius Caesar‚Äôs conspirators, such as Brutus and Cassius, and other individuals who had taken part in the civil war, including wealthy people, senators, knights, and republicans such as Sextus Pompey and Cicero. There were 2,000 names on the list in total, and a handsome reward of 2,500 drachmae for bringing back the head of a free person on the list (a slave's head was worth 1,000 drachmae); the same rewards were given to anyone who gave information on where someone on the list was hiding. Anyone who tried to save people on the list was added to the list. The material belongings of the dead victims were to be confiscated. Some of the listed were stripped of their property but protected from death by their relatives in the Triumvirate (e.g., Lucius Julius Caesar and Lepidus' brother). Most, however, were killed, in some cases gruesomely. Cicero, his younger brother Quintus Tullius Cicero (one of Julius Caesar's legates) and Marcus Favonius were all killed in the proscription. Cicero's head and hands were famously cut off and fastened to the Rostra.

There is a prevailing view that current ecological crisis is of anthropogenic origin and some researchers have found the ideological grounds for such an anthropocentric behavior in Abrahamic traditions. \\"The West's traditional denial of soul-stuff to animals, and its insistence that man alone was immortal and stood at the pinnacle of all creation, led to abuses contributing to the present-day ecological crisis. At a symposium of theologians in California, 1970, \\"virtually all the scholars agreed that the traditional Christian attitude toward nature has given sanction to exploitation of the environment by science and technology and thus contribute to air and water pollution, overpopulation and other ecological threats\\". Lynn White wrote, \\"One of the causes of our present crisis is to be found in the Judeo-Christian traditions... which speak of man's dominance over nature .... By destroying pagan animism, Christianity made it possible to exploit nature in a mood of indifference to the feelings of [nature's other creatures]\\".  Examples  = Crises caused by abiotic factors = Climate change is starting to have major impacts on ecosystems. With global temperature rising, there is a decrease in snow-fall, and sea levels are rising. Ecosystems will change or evolve to cope with the increase in temperature. Consequently, many species are being driven out of their habitats. Polar bears are being threatened. They need ice for hunting seals, their primary prey. However, the ice caps are melting, making their hunting periods shorter each year. As a result, the polar bears are not developing enough fat for the winter; therefore, they are not able to reproduce at a healthy rate. Fresh water and wetland ecosystems are dealing with extreme effects of the increase of temperature. The climate change could be devastating to salmon and trout and to other aquatic life. The increase in temperature will disrupt the current life patterns of the salmon and trout. The cold-water fish will eventually leave their natural geographical range to live in cooler waters by migrating to higher elevations. While many species have been able to adapt to the new conditions by moving their range further towards the poles, other species are not as fortunate. The option to move is not available for polar bears and for some aquatic life. = Biodiversity extinction = Due to increase in ecological crisis, vast numbers of species are being annihilated. Every year between 17,000 and 100,000 species vanish from the planet. The speed in which species are becoming extinct is much faster than in the past. The previous mass extinction was caused by a meteor collision 66 million years ago. The loss of new species in an ecosystem will eventually affect all living creatures. In the U.S. and Canada, there was a dramatic reduction of shark population along the U.S. east coast. Since then, there has been an increase in population of rays and skates, which in turn has decimated the population of shellfish. The loss of shellfish has reduced the water quality and the size of sea grass beds. Biodiversity is being lost at a fast rate. The more species there are in an ecosystem, the more resilient it is to evolution. Seven million square kilometers of tropical forest have vanished in the last 50 years. About two million square kilometers were used for crops, while the remaining five million square kilometers is poor quality land. Turning these unproductive lands back into native forest could capture an estimated five billion metric tons of carbon from the atmosphere every year for 10 to 20 or more years. Reforestation will have enormous benefits on biodiversity. = Overpopulation (species) = In the wilderness, the problem of animal overpopulation is solved by predators. Predators tend to look for signs of weakness in their prey, and therefore usually first eat the old or sick animals. This has the side effects of ensuring a strong stock among the survivors and controlling the population. In the absence of predators, animal species are bound by the resources they can find in their environment, but this does not necessarily control overpopulation. In fact, an abundant supply of resources can produce a population boom that ends up with more individuals than the environment can support. In this case, starvation, thirst, and sometimes violent competition for scarce resources may effect a sharp reduction in population, and in a very short lapse, a population crash. Lemmings, as well as other less popular species of rodents, are known to have such cycles of rapid population growth and subsequent decrease. In an ideal setting, when animal populations grow, so do the number of predators that feed on that particular animal. Animals that have birth defects or weak genes (such as the runt of the litter) also die off, unable to compete over food with stronger, healthier animals. In reality, an animal that is not native to an environment may have advantages over the native ones, such being unsuitable for the local predators. If left uncontrolled, such an animal can quickly overpopulate and ultimately destroy its environment. Examples of animal overpopulation caused by introduction of a foreign species abound. *In the Argentine Patagonia, for example, European species such as the trout and the deer were introduced into the local streams and forests, respectively, and quickly became a plague, competing with and sometimes driving away the local species of fish and ruminants. *In Australia, when rabbits were introduced (unwillingly) by European immigrants, they bred out of control and ate the plants that other native animals needed to survive. Farmers hunted the rabbits to reduce their population and prevent the damage the rabbits did to the crops. They also brought cats to guard against rabbits and rats. These cats created another problem, since they became predators of local species.  More examples  Some common examples of ecological crises are: * Deforestation and desertification, with disappearance of many species. * Extinction events ** Permian-Triassic extinction event 250 million years ago ** Cretaceous‚ÄìPaleogene extinction event 66 million years ago * The Exxon Valdez oil spill off the coast of Alaska in 1989 * Global warming related to the Greenhouse effect. Warming could involve flooding of the Asian deltas (see also eco refugees), multiplication of extreme weather phenomena and changes in the nature and quantity of the food resources (see Global warming and agriculture).

He helped popularize the Hammond B-3 organ, creating a link between jazz and 1960s soul music. In 2005, Smith was awarded the NEA Jazz Masters Award from the National Endowment for the Arts, the highest honor that America bestows upon jazz musicians.[ Allmusic biography] Early years There is confusion about Smith's birth year, with various sources citing either 1925 or 1928. Born James Oscar Smith in Norristown, Pennsylvania, United States, at the age of six he joined his father doing a song-and-dance routine in clubs. He began teaching himself to play the piano. When he was nine, Smith won a Philadelphia radio talent contest as a boogie-woogie pianist. After a stint in the U.S. Navy, he began furthering his musical education in 1948, with a year at Royal Hamilton College of Music, then the Leo Ornstein School of Music in Philadelphia in 1949. He began exploring the Hammond organ in 1951. From 1951 to 1954 he played piano, then organ in Philly R&B; bands like Don Gardner and the Sonotones. He switched to organ permanently in 1954 after hearing Wild Bill Davis. Career He purchased his first Hammond organ, rented a warehouse to practice in and emerged after little more than a year. Upon hearing him playing in a Philadelphia club, Blue Note's Alfred Lion immediately signed him to the label and his second album, The Champ, quickly established Smith as a new star on the jazz scene. He was a prolific recording artist and, as a leader, dubbed The Incredible Jimmy Smith, he recorded around forty sessions for Blue Note in just eight years beginning in 1956. Albums from this period include The Sermon!, House Party, Home Cookin, Midnight Special, Back at the Chicken Shack and Prayer Meetin. Smith signed to the Verve label in 1962. His first album, Bashin', sold well and for the first time set Smith with a big band, led by Oliver Nelson. Further big band collaborations followed, most successfully with Lalo Schifrin for The Cat and guitarist Wes Montgomery, with whom he recorded two albums: The Dynamic Duo and Further Adventures of Jimmy and Wes. Other albums from this period include Blue Bash! and Organ Grinder Swing with Kenny Burrell, The Boss with George Benson, Who's Afraid of Virginia Woolf?, Got My Mojo Working, and Hoochie Coochie Man. During the 1950s and 1960s, Smith, The Jimmy Smith Trio performed \\"When Johnny Comes Marching Home\\" and \\"The Sermon\\" in the 1964 film Get Yourself a College Girl. In the 1970s, Smith opened his own supper club in the North Hollywood neighborhood of Los Angeles, California, at 12910 Victory Boulevard and played there regularly with Kenny Dixon on drums, Herman Riley and John F. Phillips on saxophone; also included in the band was harmonica/flute player Stanley Behrens. The 1972 album Root Down, considered a seminal influence on later generations of funk and hip-hop musicians, was recorded live at the club, albeit with a different group of backing musicians. Jimmy Smith at the London Jazz Cafe Mar 2004. Final UK gig. Later career Holle Thee Maxwell, then known as Holly Maxwell, was Smith's vocalist for two years in the late 1970s. During a South African tour, they recorded the album Jimmy Smith Plays for the People in 1978. Smith had a career revival in the 1980s and 1990s, again recording for Blue Note and Verve, and for Elektra and Milestone. He also recorded with Quincy Jones, Frank Sinatra, Michael Jackson (he can be heard on the title track of the Bad album), Dee Dee Bridgewater, and Joey DeFrancesco. His last album, Dot Com Blues (Blue Thumb/Verve, 2000) was recorded with B. B. King, Dr. John, and Etta James. Smith and his wife moved to Scottsdale, Arizona, in 2004. She died of cancer a few months later. Smith recorded Legacy with Joey DeFrancesco, and the two prepared to go on tour. However, before the tour began, Smith died on February 8, 2005 at his Scottsdale home where he was found by his manager, Robert Clayton. He died in his sleep of natural causes. Musical style Jimmy Smith in 2005 While the electric organ had been used in jazz by Fats Waller, Count Basie, Wild Bill Davis and others, Smith's virtuoso improvisation technique on the Hammond helped to popularize the electric organ as a jazz and blues instrument. The B3 and companion Leslie speaker produce a distinctive sound, including percussive \\"clicks\\" with each key stroke. The drawbar setting most commonly associated with Smith is to pull out the first three drawbars on the \\"B\\" preset on the top manual of the organ, with added harmonic percussion on the 3rd harmonic. This tone has been emulated by many jazz organists since Smith. Smith's style on fast tempo pieces combined bluesy \\"licks\\" with bebop-based single note runs. For ballads, he played walking bass lines on the bass pedals. For uptempo tunes, he would play the bass line on the lower manual and use the pedals for emphasis on the attack of certain notes, which helped to emulate the attack and sound of a string bass. Smith influenced a constellation of jazz organists, including Jimmy McGriff, Brother Jack McDuff, Don Patterson, Richard \\"Groove\\" Holmes, Joey DeFrancesco, Tony Monaco and Larry Goldings, as well as rock keyboardists such as Jon Lord, Brian Auger and Keith Emerson. Emerson would later recount a story where Smith grabbed Emerson's \\"meat and two veg\\" as a humorous greeting. Later, Smith influenced bands such as Medeski, Martin & Wood and the Beastie Boys, who sampled the bassline from \\"Root Down (and Get It)\\" from Root Down‚Äîand saluted Smith in the lyrics‚Äîfor their own hit \\"Root Down\\". Often called the father of acid jazz, Smith lived to see that movement come to reflect his organ style. In the 1990s, Smith went to Nashville, taking a break from his ongoing gigs at his Sacramento restaurant which he owned and, in Music City, Nashville, he produced, with the help of a webmaster, Dot Com Blues, his last Verve album. In 1999, Smith guested on two tracks of a live album, Incredible! (the hit from the 1960s) with his prot√©g√©, Joey DeFrancesco, a then 28-year-old organist. Smith and DeFrancesco's collaborative album Legacy was released in 2005 shortly after Smith's death. Discography =As leader= Blue Note *1956: A New Sound... A New Star...

During her more than 30 years in public life, she served as both the Second (1953‚Äì1961) and First Lady of the United States (1969‚Äì1974). Born in Ely, Nevada, she grew up with her two brothers in what is now Cerritos, California, graduating from high school in 1929. She attended Fullerton Junior College and later the University of Southern California. She paid for her schooling by working multiple jobs, including pharmacy manager, typist, radiographer, and retail clerk. In 1940, she married lawyer Richard Nixon and they had two daughters, Tricia and Julie. Dubbed the \\"Nixon team,\\" Richard and Pat Nixon campaigned together in his successful congressional campaigns of 1946 and 1948. Richard Nixon was elected Vice President in 1952 alongside General Dwight D. Eisenhower, whereupon Pat became Second Lady. Pat Nixon did much to add substance to the role of the Vice President's wife, insisting on visiting schools, orphanages, hospitals, and village markets as she undertook many missions of goodwill across the world. As First Lady, Pat Nixon promoted a number of charitable causes, including volunteerism. She oversaw the collection of more than 600 pieces of historic art and furnishings for the White House, an acquisition larger than that of any other administration. She was the most traveled First Lady in U.S. history, a record unsurpassed until twenty-five years later. She accompanied the President as the first First Lady to visit China and the Soviet Union, and was the first President's wife to be officially designated a representative of the United States on her solo trips to Africa and South America, which gained her recognition as \\"Madame Ambassador\\"; she was also the first First Lady to enter a combat zone. Her tenure as First Lady ended when, after being re- elected in a landslide victory in 1972, President Nixon resigned two years later amid the Watergate scandal. Her public appearances became increasingly rare later in life. She and her husband settled in San Clemente, California, and later moved to New Jersey. She suffered two strokes, one in 1976 and another in 1983, and was diagnosed with lung cancer in 1992. She died in 1993, aged 81. Early life Thelma Catherine Ryan was born in 1912 in the small mining town of Ely, Nevada. Her father, William M. Ryan Sr., was a sailor, gold miner, and truck farmer of Irish ancestry; her mother, Katherine Halberstadt, was a German immigrant. The nickname \\"Pat\\" was given to her by her father, because of her birth on the day before Saint Patrick's Day and her Irish ancestry. Upon enrolling in college in 1931, she stopped using the name Thelma, replacing it with Pat and occasionally using the name Patricia. The name change was not a legal action, however, merely one of preference. After her birth, the Ryan family moved to California, and in 1914 settled on a small truck farm in Artesia (present-day Cerritos). Thelma Ryan's high school yearbook page gives her nickname as \\"Buddy\\" and her ambition to run a boarding house.Illustration in a New York Times article by Judith M. Kinnard, entitled \\"Thelma Ryan's Rise: From White Frame to White House\\" (August 20, 1971). She worked on the family farm and also at a local bank as a janitor and bookkeeper. Her mother died of cancer in 1924. Pat, who was only 12, assumed all the household duties for her father (who died himself of silicosis 5 years later) and her two older brothers, William Jr. (1910‚Äì1997) and Thomas (1911‚Äì1992). She also had a half-sister, Neva Bender (1909-1981), and a half- brother, Matthew Bender (1907-1973), from her mother's first marriage; her mother's first husband had died during a flash flood in South Dakota in 1936  Education and career  It has been said that few, if any, First Ladies worked as consistently before marrying as did Pat Nixon. As she told the writer Gloria Steinem during the 1968 presidential campaign, \\"I never had time to think about things like that‚Äîwho I wanted to be, or who I admired, or to have ideas. I never had time to dream about being anyone else. I had to work.\\" After graduating from Excelsior High School in 1929, she attended Fullerton College. She paid for her education by working odd jobs, including as a driver, a pharmacy manager, a telephone operator, and a typist. She also earned money sweeping the floors of a local bank, and from 1930 until 1931, she lived in New York City, working as a secretary and also as a radiographer. Determined \\"to make something out of myself\\", she enrolled in 1931 at the University of Southern California (USC), where she majored in merchandising. A former professor noted that she \\"stood out from the empty-headed, overdressed little sorority girls of that era like a good piece of literature on a shelf of cheap paperbacks.\\" She held part-time jobs on campus, worked as a sales clerk in Bullock's-Wilshire department store, and taught touch typing and shorthand at a high school. She also supplemented her income by working as an extra and bit player in the film industry, for which she took several screen tests. In this capacity, she made brief appearances in films such as Becky Sharp (1935), The Great Ziegfeld (1936), and Small Town Girl (1936). In some cases she ended up on the cutting room floor, such as with her spoken lines in Becky Sharp. She told Hollywood columnist Erskine Johnson in 1959 that her time in films was \\"too fleeting even for recollections embellished by the years\\" and that \\"my choice of a career was teaching school and the many jobs I pursued were merely to help with college expenses.\\" In 1937, Pat Ryan graduated cum laude from USC with a Bachelor of Science degree in merchandising, together with a certificate to teach at the high school level, which USC deemed equivalent to a Master's degree. Pat accepted a position as a high school teacher in Whittier, California.  Marriage and family, early campaigns  While in Whittier, Pat Ryan met Richard Nixon, a young lawyer who had recently graduated from the Duke University School of Law. The two became acquainted at a Little Theater group when they were cast together in The Dark Tower. Known as Dick, he asked Pat to marry him the first night they went out. \\"I thought he was nuts or something!\\" she recalled. He courted the redhead he called his \\"wild Irish Gypsy\\" for two years, even driving her to and from her dates with other men. They eventually married on June 21, 1940, at the Mission Inn in Riverside, California. She said that she had been attracted to the young Nixon because he \\"was going places, he was vital and ambitious ... he was always doing things\\". Later, referring to Richard Nixon, she said, \\"Oh but you just don't realize how much fun he is! He's just so much fun!\\" Following a brief honeymoon in Mexico, the two lived in a small apartment in Whittier. As U.S. involvement in World War II began, the couple moved to Washington, D.C., with Richard taking a position as a lawyer for the Office of Price Administration (OPA); Pat worked as a secretary for the American Red Cross, but also qualified as a price analyst for the OPA. He then joined the United States Navy, and while he was stationed in San Francisco, she resumed work for the OPA as an economic analyst.Sferrazza, \\"Thelma Catherine (Patricia) Ryan Nixon\\", p. 353. Veteran UPI reporter Helen Thomas suggested that in public, the Nixons \\"moved through life ritualistically\\", but privately, however, they were \\"very close\\". In private, Richard Nixon was described as being \\"unabashedly sentimental\\", often praising Pat for her work, remembering anniversaries and surprising her with frequent gifts. During state dinners, he ordered the protocol changed so that Pat could be served first. Pat, in turn, felt that her husband was vulnerable and sought to protect him. Of his critics, she said that \\"Lincoln had worse critics. He was big enough not to let it bother him. That's the way my husband is.\\" Pat campaigned at her husband's side in 1946 when he entered politics and successfully ran for a seat in the United States House of Representatives. That same year, she gave birth to a daughter and namesake, Patricia, known as Tricia. In 1948, Pat had her second and last child, Julie. When asked about her husband's career, Pat once stated, \\"The only thing I could do was help him, but [politics] was not a life I would have chosen.\\" Pat participated in the campaign by doing research on his opponent, incumbent Jerry Voorhis. She also wrote and distributed campaign literature. Nixon was elected in his first campaign to represent California's 12th congressional district. During the next six years, Pat saw her husband move from the U.S. House of Representatives to the United States Senate, and then be nominated as Dwight D. Eisenhower's vice presidential candidate. Although Pat Nixon was a Methodist, she and her husband attended whichever Protestant church was nearest to their home, especially after moving to Washington. They attended the Metropolitan Memorial Methodist Church because it sponsored her daughters' Brownie troop, occasional Baptist services with the Reverend Dr. Billy Graham, and Norman Vincent Peale's Marble Collegiate Church.  Wife of the vice president, 1953‚Äì1961  Vice President and Pat Nixon during a visit to Ghana, 1957 At the time of her husband coming under consideration for the vice presidential nomination, Pat Nixon was against her husband accepting the selection, as she despised campaigns and had been relieved that as a newly elected senator he would not have another one for six years. She thought she had prevailed in convincing him, until she heard the announcement of the pick from a news bulletin while at the 1952 Republican National Convention. During the Presidential campaign of 1952, Pat Nixon's attitude toward politics changed when her husband was accused of accepting illegal campaign contributions. Pat encouraged him to fight the charges, and he did so by delivering the famed \\"Checkers speech\\", so-called for the family's dog, a cocker spaniel given to them by a political supporter. This was Pat's first national television appearance, and she, her daughters, and the dog were featured prominently. Defending himself as a man of the people, Nixon stressed his wife's abilities as a stenographer, then said, \\"I should say this, that Pat doesn't have a mink coat. But she does have a respectable Republican cloth coat, and I always tell her she would look good in anything.\\"In 1968, however, a fashion writer of The New York Times noted that Pat Nixon had purchased a coat made of blonde mink and one of brown-and- black Persian lamb by the furrier Sidney Fink of Blum & Fink. Pat Nixon accompanied her husband abroad during his vice presidential years. She traveled to 53 nations, often bypassing luncheons and teas and instead visiting hospitals, orphanages, and even a leper colony in Panama. On a trip to Venezuela, the Nixons' limousine was pelted with rocks and the couple was spat upon as representatives of the U.S. government. A November 1, 1958, article in The Seattle Times was typical of the media's favorable coverage of the future First Lady, stating that \\"Mrs. Nixon is always reported to be gracious and friendly. And she sure is friendly. She greets a stranger as a friend. She doesn't just shake hands but clasps a visitor's hand in both her hands. Her manner is direct ... Mrs. Nixon also upheld her reputation of always looking neat, no matter how long her day has been.\\" A year and a half later, during her husband's campaign for the presidency, The New York Times called her \\"a paragon of wifely virtues\\" whose \\"efficiency makes other women feel slothful and untalented\\". Pat Nixon was named Outstanding Homemaker of the Year (1953), Mother of the Year (1955), and the Nation's Ideal Housewife (1957), and once admitted that she pressed all of her husband's suits one evening. \\"Of course, I didn't have to,\\" she told The New York Times, \\"But when I don't have work to do, I just think up some new project.\\"  Her husband's campaigns‚Äî1960, 1962 and 1968  In the 1960 election, Vice President Nixon ran for President of the United States against Democratic opponent Senator John F. Kennedy. Pat was featured prominently in the effort; an entire advertising campaign was built around the slogan \\"Pat for First Lady\\". Nixon conceded the election to Kennedy, although the race was very close and there were allegations of voter fraud. Pat had urged her husband to demand a recount of votes, though Nixon declined. Pat was most upset about the television cameras, which recorded her reaction when her husband lost‚Äî\\"millions of television viewers witnessed her desperate fight to hold a smile upon her lips as her face came apart and the bitter tears flowed from her eyes\\", as one reporter put it. This permanently dimmed Pat Nixon's view of politics. In 1962, the Nixons embarked on another campaign, this time for Governor of California. Prior to Richard Nixon's announcement of his candidacy, Pat's brother Tom Ryan said, \\"Pat told me that if Dick ran for governor she was going to take her shoe to him.\\" She eventually agreed to another run, citing that it meant a great deal to her husband, but Richard Nixon lost the gubernatorial election to Pat Brown. Six years later, Richard Nixon ran again for the presidency. Pat was reluctant to face another campaign, her eighth since 1946. Her husband was a deeply controversial figure in American politics, and Pat had witnessed and shared the praise and vilification he had received without having established an independent public identity for herself. Although she supported him in his career, she feared another \\"1960\\", when Nixon lost to Kennedy. She consented, however, and participated in the campaign by traveling on campaign trips with her husband. Richard Nixon made a political comeback with his presidential victory of 1968 over Vice-President Hubert Humphrey‚Äîand the country had a new First Lady.  First Lady of the United States, 1969‚Äì1974  = Major initiatives = Pat Nixon felt that the First Lady should always set a public example of high virtue as a symbol of dignity, but she refused to revel in the trappings of the position. When considering ideas for a project as First Lady, Pat refused to do (or be) something simply to emulate her predecessor, Lady Bird Johnson. She decided to continue what she called \\"personal diplomacy\\", which meant traveling and visiting people in other states or other nations. Pat Nixon greets young White House visitors, 1969 One of her major initiatives as First Lady was the promotion of volunteerism, in which she encouraged Americans to address social problems at the local level through volunteering at hospitals, civic organizations, and rehabilitation centers. She stated, \\"Our success as a nation depends on our willingness to give generously of ourselves for the welfare and enrichment of the lives of others.\\" She undertook a \\"Vest Pockets for Volunteerism\\" trip, where she visited ten different volunteer programs. Susan Porter, in charge of the First Lady's scheduling, noted that Pat \\"saw volunteers as unsung heroes who hadn't been encouraged or given credit for their sacrifices and who needed to be\\". Her second volunteerism tour‚Äîshe traveled within the United States‚Äîhelped to boost the notion that not all students were protesting the Vietnam War. She herself belonged to several volunteer groups, including Women in Community Services and Urban Services League, and was an advocate of the Domestic Volunteer Service Act of 1973, a bill that encouraged volunteerism by providing benefits to a number of volunteer organizations. Some reporters viewed her choice of volunteerism as safe and dull compared to the initiatives undertaken by Lady Bird Johnson and Jacqueline Kennedy. Pat Nixon became involved in the development of recreation areas and parkland, was a member of the President's Committee on Employment of the Handicapped, and lent her support to organizations dedicated to improving the lives of handicapped children. For her first Thanksgiving in the White House, Pat organized a meal for 225 senior citizens who did not have families. The following year, she invited wounded servicemen to a second annual Thanksgiving meal in the White House. Though presidents since George Washington had been issuing Thanksgiving proclamations, Pat became the only First Lady to issue one. = Life in the White House = Queen Elizabeth II, 1970 After her husband was elected president in 1968, Pat Nixon met with the outgoing First Lady Lady Bird Johnson and toured the private quarters of the White House on December 12. She eventually asked Sarah Jackson Doyle, an interior decorator who had worked for the Nixons since 1965 and who decorated the family's 10-room apartment on Fifth Avenue in New York with French and English antiques, to serve as a design consultant. She hired Clement Conger from the State Department to be the Executive Mansion's new curator, replacing James Ketchum, who had been hired by Jacqueline Kennedy. Pat Nixon greets well-wishers on a trip to Hawaii, 1972 Pat Nixon developed and led a coordinated effort to improve the authenticity of the White House as an historic residence and museum. She added more than 600 paintings, antiques and furnishings to the Executive Mansion and its collections, the largest number of acquisitions by any administration; this greatly, and dramatically, expanded upon Jacqueline Kennedy's more publicized efforts. She created the Map Room and renovated the China room, and refurbished nine other rooms, including the Red Room, Blue Room and Green Room. She worked with engineers to develop an exterior lighting system for the entire White House, literally making it glow a soft white. She ordered the American flag atop the White House flown day and night, even when the president was not in residence. She ordered pamphlets describing the rooms of the house for tourists so they could understand everything, and had them translated into Spanish, French, Italian and Russian for foreigners. She had ramps installed for the handicapped and physically disabled. She instructed the police who served as tour guides to attend sessions at the Winterthur Museum, Garden and Library (to learn how tours were guided \\"in a real museum\\"), and arranged for them to wear less menacing uniforms, with their guns hidden underneath. The tour guides were to speak slowly to deaf groups, to help those who lip-read, and Pat ordered that the blind be able to touch the antiques. Pat addresses the 1972 Republican National Convention. She was the first First Lady since Eleanor Roosevelt to address a party convention, and the first Republican First Lady to do so. The First Lady had long been irritated by the perception that the White House and access to the President and First Lady were exclusively for the wealthy and famous; she routinely came down from the family quarters to greet tourists, shake hands, sign autographs, and pose for photos. Her daughter Julie Eisenhower reflected, \\"she invited so many groups to the White House to give them recognition, not famous ones, but little-known organizations...\\" She invited former First Lady Jacqueline Kennedy and her children Caroline and John Jr. to dine with her family and view the White House's official portraits of her and her husband, the late President Kennedy. It was the first time that the three Kennedys had returned to the White House since the president's assassination eight years earlier. Pat had ordered the visit to be kept secret from the media until after the trip's conclusion in an attempt to maintain privacy for the Kennedys. She also invited President Kennedy's mother Rose Kennedy to see her son's official portrait. Pat Nixon with White House curator Clement Conger, whom she hired, in the Red Room after her redecorations, 1971 She opened the White House for evening tours so that the public could see the interior design work that had been implemented. The tours that were conducted in December displayed the White House's Christmas decor. In addition, she instituted a series of performances by artists at the White House in varied American traditions, from opera to bluegrass; among the guests were The Carpenters in 1972. These events were described as ranging from \\"creative to indifferent, to downright embarrassing\\". When they entered the White House in 1969, the Nixons began inviting families to non-denominational Sunday church services in the East Room of the White House. She also oversaw the White House wedding of her daughter, Tricia, to Edward Ridley Finch Cox in 1971. In October 1969, she announced her appointment of Constance Stuart as her staff director and press secretary. To the White House residence staff, the Nixons were perceived as more stiff and formal than other first families, but nonetheless kind. She spoke out in favor of women running for political office and encouraged her husband to nominate a woman to the Supreme Court, saying \\"woman power is unbeatable; I've seen it all across this country\\". She was the first of the American First Ladies to publicly support the Equal Rights Amendment, though her views on abortion were mixed. Following the Court's 1973 Roe vs. Wade decision, Pat stated she was pro-choice. However, in 1972, she said, \\"I'm really not for abortion. I think it's a personal thing. I mean abortion on demand‚Äîwholesale.\\" In 1972, she became the first Republican First Lady to address a national convention. Her efforts in the 1972 reelection campaign‚Äîtraveling across the country and speaking on behalf of her husband‚Äîwere copied by future candidates' spouses. = Travels = Escorted by armed guards, Pat Nixon (far right) arrives via helicopter on the ground in South Vietnam, July 31, 1969. It was the first time a first lady had entered a combat zone. Pat Nixon held the record as the most-traveled First Lady until her mark was surpassed by Hillary Rodham Clinton. In President Nixon's first term, Pat traveled to 39 of 50 states, and in the first year alone, shook hands with a quarter of a million people. She undertook many missions of goodwill to foreign nations as well. Her first foreign trip took in Guam, India, the Philippines, Indonesia, Thailand, Pakistan, Romania, and England. On such trips, Pat refused to be serviced by an entourage, feeling that they were an unnecessary barrier and a burden for taxpayers. Soon after, during a trip to South Vietnam, Pat became the first First Lady to enter a combat zone. She had tea with the wife of President Nguy·ªÖn VƒÉn Thi·ªáu in a palace, visited an orphanage, and lifted off in an open-door helicopter‚Äîarmed by military guards with machine guns‚Äîto witness U.S. troops fighting in a jungle below. She later admitted to experiencing a \\"moment of fear going into a battle zone\\", because, as author and historian Carl Sferrazza Anthony noted, \\"Pat Nixon was literally in a line of fire.\\" She later visited an army hospital, where, for two hours, she walked through the wards and spoke with each wounded patient. The First Lady of South Vietnam, Madame Thieu, said Pat Nixon's trip \\"intensified our morale\\". After hearing about the Great Peruvian earthquake of 1970, which caused an avalanche and additional destruction, Pat initiated a \\"volunteer American relief drive\\" and flew to the country, where she aided in taking relief supplies to earthquake victims. She toured damaged regions and embraced homeless townspeople; they trailed her as she climbed up hills of rubble and under fallen beams. Her trip was heralded in newspapers around the world for her acts of compassion and disregard for her personal safety or comfort, and her presence was a direct boost to political relations. One Peruvian official commented: \\"Her coming here meant more than anything else President Nixon could have done,\\" and an editorial in Peru's Lima Prensa said that Peruvians could never forget Pat Nixon. Fran Lewine of the Associated Press wrote that no First Lady had ever undertaken a \\"mercy mission\\" resulting in such \\"diplomatic side effects\\". On the trip, the Peruvian government presented her with the Grand Cross of the Order of the Sun, the highest Peruvian distinction and the oldest such honor in the Americas. She became the first First Lady to visit Africa in 1972, on a , eight-day journey to Ghana, Liberia, and the Ivory Coast. Upon arrival in Liberia, Pat was honored with a 19-gun salute, a tribute reserved only for heads of government, and she reviewed troops. She later donned a traditional native costume and danced with locals. She was awarded the Grand Cordon of the Most Venerable Order of Knighthood, Liberia's highest honor. In Ghana, she again danced with local residents, and addressed the nation's Parliament. In the Ivory Coast, she was met by a quarter of a million people shouting \\"Vive Madame Nixon!\\" She conferred with leaders of all three African nations. Upon her return home, White House staffer Charles Colson sent a memo to the President reading in part, \\"Mrs. Nixon has now broken through where we have failed ... People‚Äîmen and women‚Äîidentify with her, and in return with you.\\" The Nixons walked on the Great Wall of China during their historic trip in February 1972 Another notable journey was the Nixons' historic visit to the People's Republic of China in 1972. While President Nixon was in meetings, Pat toured through Peking in her red coat. According to Carl Sferrazza Anthony, China was Pat Nixon's \\"moment\\", her turning point as an acclaimed First Lady in the United States. She accompanied her husband to the Nixon‚ÄìBrezhnev summit meetings in the Soviet Union later in the year. Though security constraints left her unable to walk freely through the streets as she did in China, Pat was still able to visit with children and walk arm-in-arm with Soviet First Lady Viktoria Brezhneva. Later, she visited Brazil and Venezuela in 1974 with the unique diplomatic standing of personal representative of the president. The Nixons' last major trip was in June 1974, to Austria, Egypt, Saudi Arabia, Syria, Israel, and Jordan. = Fashion and style = Pat Nixon posing in the White House, 1970 The traditional role of a First Lady as the nation's hostess puts her personal appearance and style under scrutiny, and the attention to Pat was lively. Women's Wear Daily stated that Pat had a \\"good figure and good posture\\", as well as \\"the best-looking legs of any woman in public life today\\". Some fashion writers tended to have a lackluster opinion of her well tailored, but nondescript, American-made clothes. \\"I consider it my duty to use American designers\\", she said, and favored them because, \\"they are now using so many materials which are great for traveling because they're non crushable\\". She preferred to buy readymade garments rather than made-to-order outfits. \\"I'm a size 10,\\" she told The New York Times. \\"I can just walk in and buy. I've bought things in various stores in various cities. Only some of my clothes are by designers.\\" She did, however, wear the custom work of some well-known talents, notably Geoffrey Beene, at the suggestion of Clara Treyz, her personal shopper. Many fashion observers concluded that Pat Nixon did not greatly advance the cause of American fashion. Nixon's yellow-satin inaugural gown by Harvey Berin was criticized as \\"a schoolteacher on her night out\\", but Treyz defended her wardrobe selections by saying, \\"Mrs. Nixon must be ladylike.\\"Nixon also frequently wore wigs that replicated her short blonde hairstyle, especially on political trips when access to a hairdresser was difficult. Nixon did not sport the outrageous fashions of the 1970s, because she was concerned about appearing conservatively dressed, especially as her husband's political star rose. \\"Always before, it was sort of fun to get some ... thing that was completely different, high-style\\", she told a reporter. \\"But this is not appropriate now. I avoid the spectacular.\\" = Watergate = At the time the Watergate scandal broke to the media, Nixon \\"barely noticed\\" the reports of a break-in at the Democratic National Committee headquarters. Later, when asked by the press about Watergate, she replied curtly, \\"I know only what I read in the newspapers.\\" In 1974, when a reporter asked \\"Is the press the cause of the president's problems?\\", she shot back, \\"What problems?\\"Anthony, C. S. (1991), p. 210 Privately, she felt that the power of her husband's staff was increasing, and President Nixon was becoming more removed from what was occurring in the administration.'' The Fords escort the Nixons as they depart the White House on Nixon's final day as president, August 9, 1974. Pat Nixon did not know of the secret tape recordings her husband had made. Julie Nixon Eisenhower stated that the First Lady would have ordered the tapes destroyed immediately, had she known of their existence. Once she did learn of the tapes, she vigorously opposed making them public, and compared them to \\"private love letters‚Äîfor one person alone\\". Believing in her husband's innocence, she also encouraged him not to resign and instead fight all the impeachment charges that were eventually leveled against him. She said to her friend Helene Drown, \\"Dick has done so much for the country. Why is this happening?\\" After President Nixon told his family he would resign the office of the presidency, she replied \\"But why?\\" She contacted White House curator Clement Conger to cancel any further development of a new official china pattern from the Lenox China Company, and began supervising the packing of the family's personal belongings. On August 7, 1974, the family met in the solarium of the White House for their last dinner. Pat sat on the edge of a couch and held her chin high, a sign of tension to her husband. When the president walked in, she threw her arms around him, kissed him, and said, \\"We're all very proud of you, Daddy.\\" Later Pat Nixon said of the photographs taken that evening, \\"Our hearts were breaking and there we are smiling.\\" On the morning of August 9 in the East Room, Nixon gave a televised 20-minute farewell speech to the White House staff, during which time he read from Theodore Roosevelt's biography and praised his own parents. The First Lady could hardly contain her tears; she was most upset about the cameras, because they recorded her anguish, as they had during the 1960 election defeat. The Nixons walked onto the Executive Mansion's South Lawn with Vice President Gerald Ford and Betty Ford. The outgoing president departed from the White House on Marine One. As the family walked towards the helicopter, Pat, with one arm around her husband's waist and one around Betty's, said to Betty \\"You'll see many of these red carpets, and you'll get so you hate 'em.\\" The helicopter transported them to Andrews Air Force Base; from there they flew to California. Pat Nixon later told her daughter Julie, \\"Watergate is the only crisis that ever got me down ... And I know I will never live to see the vindication.\\"  Public perception  Pat Nixon reaches out from her limousine to a young girl during an October 1972 campaign stop in Atlanta. Historian Carl Sferrazza Anthony noted that ordinary citizens responded to, and identified with, Pat Nixon. When a group of people from a rural community visited the White House to present a quilt to the First Lady, many were overcome with nervousness; upon hearing their weeping, Pat hugged each individual tightly, and the tension dissipated. When a young boy doubted that the Executive Mansion was her house because he could not see her washing machine, Pat led him through the halls and up an elevator, into the family quarters and the laundry room. She mixed well with people of different races, and made no distinctions on that basis. During the Nixons' trip to China in 1972, foreign minister Zhou En-lai was sufficiently smitten with her so as to give two rare giant pandas to the United States as a gift from China. Pat Nixon was listed on the Gallup Organization's top-ten list of the most admired women fourteen times, from 1959 to 1962 and 1968 to 1979. She was ranked third in 1969, second in 1970 and 1971, and first in 1972. She remained on the top- ten list until 1979, five years after her husband left office. To many, she was seen as an example of the \\"American Dream,\\" having risen from a poor background, with her greatest popularity among the \\"great silent majority\\" of voters. Mary Brooks, the director of the United States Mint and a long-time friend of Pat's, illustrated some of the cultural divides present at the time when she described the First Lady as \\"a good example to the women of this country-if they're not part of those Women's Liberation groups.\\" Additionally, it was the view of veteran UPI correspondent Helen Thomas that Pat \\"was the warmest First Lady I covered and the one who loved people the most. I think newspeople who covered her saw a woman who was sharp, responsive, sensitive.\\" Pat Nixon was awarded the Grand Cross of the Order of the Sun in 1971 by the government of Peru, becoming the first Western woman to earn the distinction. Press accounts framed Pat Nixon as an embodiment of Cold War domesticity, in stark contrast to the second-wave feminism of the time. Journalists often portrayed her as dutiful and selfless and seeing herself as a wife first and individual second. Time magazine described her as \\"the perfect wife and mother-pressing [her husband's] pants, making dresses for daughters Tricia and Julie, doing her own housework even as the Vice President's wife.\\" In the early years of her tenure as First Lady she was tagged \\"Plastic Pat,\\" a derogatory nickname applied because, according to critics, she was always smiling while her face rarely expressed emotion and her body language made her seem reserved, and at times, artificial. Some observers described Pat Nixon as \\"a paper doll, a Barbie doll-plastic, antiseptic, unalive\\" and that she \\"put every bit of the energy and drive of her youth into playing a role, and she may no longer recognize it as such\\". As for the criticisms, she said, \\"I am who I am and I will continue to be.\\" She unguardedly revealed some of her opinions of her own life in a 1968 interview aboard a campaign plane with Gloria Steinem: \\"Now, I have friends in all the countries of the world. I haven't just sat back and thought of myself or my ideas or what I wanted to do. Oh no, I've stayed interested in people. I've kept working. Right here in the plane I keep this case with me, and the minute I sit down, I write my thank you notes. Nobody gets by without a personal note. I don't have time to worry about who I admire or who I identify with. I've never had it easy. I'm not like all you ... all those people who had it easy.\\" Despite her largely demure public persona as a traditional wife and homemaker, she was not as self-effacing and timid as her critics often claimed. When a news photographer wanted her to strike yet another pose while wearing an apron, she firmly responded, \\"I think we've had enough of this kitchen thing, don't you?\\" Some journalists, such as columnist and White House Correspondent Robert Thompson, felt that Pat was an ideal balance for the 1970s; Thompson wrote that she proved that \\"women can play a vital role in world affairs\\" while still retaining a \\"feminine manner.\\" Other journalists felt that Pat represented the failings of the feminine mystique, and portrayed her as being out of step with her times. Those who opposed the Vietnam War identified her with the Nixon administration's policies, and, as a result, occasionally picketed her speaking events. After she had spoken to some of them in one instance in 1970, however, one of the students told the press that \\"she wanted to listen. I felt like this is a woman who really cares about what we are doing. I was surprised.\\" Veteran CBS correspondent Mike Wallace expressed regret that the one major interview he was never able to conduct was that of Pat Nixon.  Later life  Henriette Wyeth Hurd After returning to San Clemente, California, in 1974 and settling into the Nixons' home, La Casa Pacifica, Pat Nixon rarely appeared in public and only granted occasional interviews to the press. In late May 1975, Pat went to her girlhood hometown of Artesia to dedicate the Patricia Nixon Elementary School. In her remarks, she said, \\"I'm proud to have the school carry my name. I always thought that only those who have gone had schools named after them. I am happy to tell you that I'm not gone‚ÄîI mean, not really gone.\\" It was Pat's only solo public appearance in five and a half years in California. On July 7, 1976, at La Casa Pacifica, Nixon suffered a stroke, which resulted in the paralysis of her entire left side. Physical therapy enabled her to eventually regain all movement. She said that her recovery was \\"the hardest thing I have ever done physically\\".Eisenhower, Julie (1986), p. 451 In 1979, she and her husband moved to a townhouse on East 65th Street in Manhattan, New York. They lived there only briefly and in 1981 moved to a house in Saddle River, New Jersey. This gave the couple additional space, and enabled them to be near their children and grandchildren. Pat, however, sustained another stroke in 1983 and two lung infections the following year. Nixon (seated second from left) attends the opening of the Ronald Reagan Library, November 1991 Appearing \\"frail and slightly bent\\", she appeared in public for the opening of the Richard Nixon Library & Birthplace (now Richard Nixon Presidential Library and Museum) in Yorba Linda, California, on July 19, 1990. The dedication ceremony included 50,000 friends and well-wishers, as well as former Presidents Ford, Reagan, and Bush and their wives. The library includes a Pat Nixon room, a Pat Nixon amphitheater, and rose gardens planted with the red-black Pat Nixon Rose developed by a French company in 1972, when she was first lady. Pat also attended the opening of the Ronald Reagan Presidential Library in Simi Valley, California, in November 1991. Former First Lady Barbara Bush reflected, \\"I loved Pat Nixon, who was a sensational, gracious, and thoughtful First Lady\\", and at the dedication of the Reagan Library, Bush remembered, \\"There was one sad thing. Pat Nixon did not look well at all. Through her smile you could see that she was in great pain and having a terrible time getting air into her lungs.\\" The Nixons moved to a gated complex in Park Ridge, New Jersey, in 1991. Pat's health was failing, and the house was smaller and contained an elevator. A heavy smoker most of her adult life who nevertheless never allowed herself to be seen with a cigarette in public, she eventually endured bouts of oral cancer, emphysema, and ultimately lung cancer, with which she was diagnosed in December 1992 while hospitalized with respiratory problems.  Death and funeral  Pat Nixon died at her Park Ridge, New Jersey, home at 5:45 a.m. on June 22, 1993, the day after her fifty-third wedding anniversary. She was 81 years old. Her daughters and husband were by her side. A statue of Pat Nixon stands at the site of her girlhood home in Cerritos, California, now called Pat Nixon Park. It is one of the rare statues created in the image of a first lady. The funeral service for Pat Nixon took place on the grounds of the Richard Nixon Library in Yorba Linda on June 26, 1993. Speakers at the ceremony, including California Governor Pete Wilson, Kansas senator Bob Dole, and the Reverend Dr. Billy Graham, eulogized the former First Lady. In addition to her husband and immediate family, former presidents Ronald Reagan and Gerald Ford and their wives, Nancy and Betty, were also in attendance. Lady Bird Johnson was unable to attend because she was in the hospital recovering from a stroke, and Jacqueline Kennedy Onassis did not attend either. President Nixon sobbed openly, profusely, and at times uncontrollably during the ceremony. It was a rare display of emotion from the former president, and Helen McCain Smith said that she had never seen him more distraught. Nixon's tombstone gives her name as \\"Patricia Ryan Nixon\\", the name by which she was popularly known. Her husband survived her by ten months, dying on April 22, 1994. He was also 81. Her epitaph reads: Popular culture impact In 1994, the Pat Nixon Park was established in Cerritos, California. The site where her girlhood home stood is on the property. The Cerritos City Council voted in April 1996 to erect a statue of the former first lady, one of the few statues created in the image of a first lady. Pat has been portrayed by Joan Allen in the 1995 film Nixon, Patty McCormack in the 2008 film Frost/Nixon and Nicole Sullivan in the 2009 film Black Dynamite. She was sung by soprano Carolann Page in John Adams' opera Nixon in China 1987 world premiere in Houston, Texas; a New York Times critic noted that the performance captured \\"the First Lady's shy mannerisms\\" while one from the Los Angeles Times described the subject as the \\"chronically demure First Lady\\". The part was later sung by Scottish soprano Janis Kelly in the 2011 Metropolitan Opera premiere in New York. This New York Times critic wrote that Kelly \\"was wonderful as Pat Nixon. During the affecting Act II scene in which she is guided by Chinese escorts and journalists to a glass factory, a people's commune and a health clinic, she is finally taken to a school. She speaks of coming from a poor family and tells the obliging children that for a while she was a schoolteacher. In Mr. Adams's tender music, as sung by Ms. Kelly, you sense Mrs. Nixon wistfully pondering the much different life she might have had.\\"  Footnotes   References     * Further reading  External links  * Richard Nixon Foundation biography of Pat Nixon * White House biography on Pat Nixon * ** Video of funeral services for Pat Nixon, 1993 ** Pat Nixon at C-SPAN's First Ladies: Influence & Image - Category:1912 births Category:1993 deaths Category:20th-century American politicians Category:20th-century American women Category:20th-century Methodists Category:American Methodists Category:American people of German descent Category:American people of Irish descent Category:Burials in Orange County, California Category:California Republicans Category:Deaths from cancer in New Jersey Category:Deaths from emphysema Category:Deaths from lung cancer Category:First Ladies of the United States Category:Fullerton College alumni Category:Grand Crosses of the Order of the Sun of Peru Category:Marshall School of Business alumni Category:Nevada Republicans Category:New Jersey Republicans Category:Nixon family Category:People from Cerritos, California Category:People from the Upper East Side Category:People from Park Ridge, New Jersey Category:People from Saddle River, New Jersey Category:People from Ely, Nevada Category:People from Whittier, California Category:Retail clerks Category:Second Ladies of the United States Category:Spouses of California politicians Category:USC Rossier School of Education alumni ","title":"Pat Nixon"},{"id":"400690","text":"Patricia Ryan may refer to: * Pat Nixon (1912‚Äì1993), n√©e Patricia Ryan, wife of U.S. president Richard Nixon * Patricia Ryan (CFF), former director of the Cult Awareness Network, daughter of former U.S. Congressman Leo Ryan * Patricia Ryan (author) (born 1954), American writer * Patricia Ryan (actress) (1921‚Äì1949), active in old-time radio from childhood until her death in 1927 * Patricia Ryan (equestrian) (born 1973), Irish equestrian * Patricia E.

Grant. Her time as First Lady marked a turning point in her life, when she became a national figure.  Early life and education  Julia Boggs Dent was born on January 26, 1826 at White Haven plantation west of St. Louis, Missouri. Her parents were Frederick Dent (1787‚Äì1873), a slaveholding planter and merchant, and Ellen Wrenshall Dent. Frederick enslaved about 30 Africans and refused to consider freeing them on moral grounds, doing so only when compelled by law of emancipation. She was distantly related to Confederate general James Longstreet. Julia was the fifth of eight children. In her memoirs, Julia described her childhood as \\"one long summer of sunshine, flowers, and smiles‚Ä¶\\" Around 1831‚Äì1836, Julia attended the Gravois School, a co-educational one-room schoolhouse in St. Louis. From age 10 to age 17, Julia attended the Misses Mauros' boarding school in St. Louis with the daughters of other affluent parents. Julia was a boarding student during the week and returned home to White Haven on weekends. The Dent family was highly social with visitors coming from among the elite class of Cincinnati, Louisville and Pittsburgh. William Clark (of Lewis and Clark) and politician Alexander McNair were family friends. As a young woman, Julia was a skilled pianist, an expert horsewoman and a voracious reader of novels.  Strabismus  Julia was born with strabismus (more commonly known as \\"crossed eyes\\") which prevents both eyes from lining up in the same direction. When she was younger, one of the best surgeons in the country offered to perform the simple operation that would fix them. Julia was not keen on surgery, however, and declined. After her husband became president, Julia reconsidered surgery. \\"I never had the courage to consent, but now that my husband had become so famous I really thought it behooved me to try to look as well as possible.\\" Ulysses objected: \\"Did I not see you and fall in love with you with these same eyes? I like them just as they are, and now, remember, you are not to interfere with them. They are mine and let me tell you, Mrs. Grant, you had better not make any experiments, as I might not like you half so well with any other eyes.\\" Because her strabismus was never corrected, Julia almost always posed in profile for portraits. Engagement and marriage to Grant While a student at West Point Academy, Fred Dent wrote his sister Julia about how impressed he was with a fellow student, Ulysses S. Grant. \\"I want you to know him, he is pure gold.\\" In 1844, Ulysses S. Grant began visiting the Dent family. At one point her pet canary died, and Ulysses crafted a small yellow coffin and summoned eight fellow officers for an avian funeral service. In April of that year, Ulysses asked Julia to wear his class ring, as a sign of their exclusive affection. Eighteen-year-old Julia initially demurred. Grant's regiment was then ordered to Louisiana, in preparation for service in the Mexican War. Distraught at their separation, Julia had an intense dream, which she detailed to several people, that Grant would somehow return within days, wearing civilian clothes and state his intention of staying for a week. Despite the unlikeliness of the dream, Ulysses did return just as Julia had predicted and the two became engaged. In July 1848, after they had been apart for four years, Grant's regiment returned to the United States, and he took leave so that he could make wedding arrangements in St. Louis. Grant's father, Jesse Grant, refused to attend their wedding (August 22, 1848), objecting not to Julia, but to her family's owning slaves.  Early married life  After the Grants were married, Ulysses returned to the Army. Julia gave birth to Frederick Dent Grant in 1850 and Ulysses Simpson Grant in 1852 while her husband was dispatched to the West Coast for several years. Unhappy to be so far from his family, Ulysses resigned from the Army in 1854 and the Grants moved to a small farm called \\"Hardscrabble\\" in St. Louis. At one point, Ulysses purchased a slave from Julia's brother Fred, his old West Point roommate. Yet without explanation, when he was in debt and barely able to put food on his family's table, Grant appeared in court on March 20, 1859, and emancipated his slave rather than selling him. Ulysses became ill with malaria and was unable to run his farm. The family moved in with Julia's parents in White Haven. Once he recovered, he took a job collecting rents for a real estate firm in St. Louis, but could not earn enough money. By 1860, Grant was out of options, and he asked his father for help. He was offered a job in the family leather business, working under his two younger brothers. Earning $600 a year, he could go a long way toward getting his family out of debt, so he moved Julia and the children to Illinois.  Civil War  At the beginning of the Civil War, Ulysses helped organize volunteers and he soon took command of the Illinois troops. He was promoted to brigadier general and then major general. Lonely without his wife, Ulysses sent for Julia. She left the children with relatives and over the course of the Civil War she stayed with Ulysses during campaigns at Memphis, Vicksburg, Nashville and Virginia. Julia covered more than 10,000 miles in four years ‚Äì and nearly 4,000 in just the first year ‚Äì to be with her husband. At one point, Julia lived at Walter Place, an Antebellum mansion in Holly Springs, Mississippi. When Confederate General Earl Van Dorn raided the house, he was not permitted by the pro-Union owner to enter before she went outside. Julia's presence lifted her husband's spirits and buoyed his confidence. In 1864, when Lincoln appointed Grant commander of the Union armies, the president sent for Julia to join her husband, aware of the positive effect she had on him.  Children  Ulysses Grant and Julia Dent with their four children: Jesse, Ulysses Jr., Nellie, and Frederick in front of their cottage in Long Branch, New Jersey The Grants had three sons and a daughter: * Frederick Dent Grant (1850‚Äì1912)‚Äîsoldier, public official. * Ulysses Simpson Grant, Jr. known as \\"Buck\\" (1852‚Äì1929)‚Äîlawyer. * Ellen Wrenshall Grant known as \\"Nellie\\" (1855‚Äì1922)‚Äîhomemaker. * Jesse Root Grant (1858‚Äì1934)‚Äîengineer.  First Lady  Julia was thrilled with her husband's nomination for the presidency in 1868‚Äîeven more than the candidate himself‚Äîand immersed herself in his campaign. She was such a major figure in her husband's bid for the presidency that after his inauguration, Ulysses S. Grant turned to his wife and said, \\"And now, my dear, I hope you're satisfied.\\" After four years of war, an assassination, and an impeachment trial, Washington was ready for a little levity, and Julia obliged. She offered a full array of events and became a popular hostess. She planned lavish state dinners, where guests enjoyed expensive wines and liquors. She also received callers at informal receptions as long as the ladies wore hats and the men left their weapons at home. Although Julia spent a great deal of money, she avoided the kind of spending criticism that had been directed at Mary Todd Lincoln. Julia also sought to imbue the position of First Lady with the appropriate prestige. She believed that the position should command the same dignity and honors accorded wives of foreign leaders, and she was frustrated when the role was not publicly acknowledged. Not only did she seek added prestige for the first ladyship, but she also worked to improve the stature of the wives of the diplomatic corps, the cabinet, the Congress, and the Supreme Court. As First Lady, Julia presided over Tuesday afternoon receptions for the general public. As noted above, Julia's only requirements for these receptions were that ladies wore hats and the men left their weapons at home. On May 21, 1874, First Daughter Nellie Grant married Algernon Charles Frederick Sartoris (August 1, 1851 ‚Äì February 3, 1893), a wealthy English singer, son of Adelaide Kemble and nephew of the famous actress Fanny Kemble. It was the first grand White House wedding, and the East Room redecorated entirely for the occasion. Andrew Jackson's three chandeliers were replaced by much grander \\"French\\" models, boasting thousands of glass pieces showered over a nickel-plated framework, with gas flames shaded by cut and frosted glass shades. She was devastated to discover in 1875 that her husband had declined to run for a third term. When the 1876 presidential election between Rutherford B. Hayes and Samuel Tilden ended in dispute, Julia saw an opportunity to extend her time in the White House. She thought her husband should remain President until the matter could be settled. She admitted that her \\"policy would have been to hold the fort until another election could be held.\\" Her husband disagreed, and when Congress settled the election in favor of Hayes, Julia prepared to leave the White House. Grant was the first First Lady recorded on film.  Views on women's rights  She was a staunch defender of women's rights in general and refused to allow jokes at women's expense to be told in her company. Those who questioned the capabilities or equality of women earned her wrath, as Brigham Young discovered when the First Lady grilled him about the Church of Jesus Christ of Latter-day Saints' practice of polygamy and its negative effect on women. Yet while she believed in the abilities of women, she was not sure that women should work nor did she publicly support women's suffrage although she refused to sign an anti-suffrage petition‚Äîan obvious omission to many.  Views on slavery and race  Julia grew up on a plantation with slaves and as a young woman had a slave known as \\"Jule\\" or \\"Black Julia\\". It is not clear if Jule ever legally belonged to Julia. Historians still debate whether Julia's father retained legal title to the four slaves his daughter claimed to own. Julia's father insisted they leave the slaves with him when the Grants lived in the North, fearing they would escape to freedom. Jule traveled with Julia Grant throughout the war. In January 1862, Abraham Lincoln received an anonymous letter from Cairo, decrying Grant's drinking and his 'secesh' wife with her slave, but Lincoln took no action. In her memoirs, Julia recalled \\"When I visited the General during the war, I nearly always had Jule with me as a nurse. She came near being captured at Holly Springs.\\" According to Julia, \\"Eliza, Dan, Jule, and John belonged to me up to the time of President Lincoln's Emancipation Proclamation\\", which exempted Missouri slaves from emancipation. Even after that date, Jule continued her service to Julia. In January 1864, Jule, Julia, and Julia's young son Jesse left Nashville for St. Louis. On the trip, Jule left the group. Julia later recalled. \\"I suppose she feared to lose her freedom if she returned to Missouri.\\" According to Julia, Jule married soon afterwards. Julia seemed to believe that blacks were not fully equal to whites, but she refused to lend any support to white supremacists, including her brother Louis Dent. She strongly encouraged blacks on the White House domestic staff to buy land in the District while it was still cheap, in order to ensure their future financial security. She also decided to greet anyone properly dressed‚Äîregardless of race‚Äîwho attended her afternoon receptions, but never questioned why blacks failed to call on her. The simple answer was that White House security prevented them from doing so. Grant's Tomb, a mausoleum containing the bodies of Ulysses and Julia Grant  Later life  After accompanying her husband on a two-year world tour that took them to Europe, Africa, and Asia, Julia and Ulysses settled in New York City to enjoy their retirement from public life. However, all of their money was lost in an unwise investment scheme, and the Grants were reduced to poverty. Shortly afterward, Ulysses developed the throat cancer that led to his death in 1885. In his dying days, Grant completed his Personal Memoirs, which left Julia and their children financially secure. As a widow, Julia lived in Washington, D.C., where she wrote her own memoirs. Julia Grant was the first First Lady to write a memoir, though she was unable to find a publisher, and had been dead almost 75 years before The Personal Memoirs of Julia Dent Grant (Mrs. Ulysses S. Grant) was finally published in 1975. She had attended in 1897 the dedication of Grant's monumental tomb overlooking the Hudson River in New York City. She was laid to rest in a sarcophagus beside her husband. She had ended her own chronicle of their years together with a firm declaration: \\"the light of his glorious fame still reaches out to me, falls upon me, and warms me.\\" While in Washington, D.C., Julia followed Dolley Madison's lead and acted as a \\"Queen Mother\\" figure. She became friends with First Ladies Frances Cleveland, Caroline Harrison, and Edith Roosevelt. She died on December 14, 1902, and is interred with her husband in General Grant's National Monument (Grant's Tomb) in New York City.

It was introduced by Anton Karl Gr√ºnwald (1838‚Äì1920) from Prague, in 1867, and by Aleksey Vasilievich Letnikov (1837‚Äì1888) in Moscow in 1868. Constructing the Gr√ºnwald‚ÄìLetnikov derivative The formula :f'(x) = \\\\lim_{h \\\\to 0} \\\\frac{f(x+h)-f(x)}{h} for the derivative can be applied recursively to get higher-order derivatives. For example, the second-order derivative would be: :\\\\begin{align}f(x)&=\\\\lim_{h\\\\to0}\\\\frac{f'(x+h)-f'(x)}{h}\\\\\\\\\\\\&=\\\\lim_{h_1\\\\to0}\\\\frac{\\\\lim\\\\limits_{h_2\\\\to0}\\\\dfrac{f(x+h_1+h_2)-f(x+h_1)}{h_2}-\\\\lim\\\\limits_{h_2\\\\to0} \\\\dfrac{f(x+h_2)-f(x)}{h_2}}{h_1}\\\\end{align} Assuming that the h 's converge synchronously, this simplifies to: : = \\\\lim_{h \\\\to 0} \\\\frac{f(x+2h)-2f(x+h)+f(x)}{h^2} which can be justified rigorously by the mean value theorem. In general, we have (see binomial coefficient): :f^{(n)}(x) = \\\\lim_{h \\\\to 0} \\\\frac{\\\\sum\\\\limits_{0\\\\le m\\\\le n}(-1)^m {n \\\\choose m}f(x+(n-m)h)}{h^n} Removing the restriction that n be a positive integer, it is reasonable to define: :\\\\mathbb{D}^q f(x) = \\\\lim_{h \\\\to 0} \\\\frac{1}{h^q}\\\\sum_{0 \\\\le m < \\\\infty}(-1)^m {q \\\\choose m}f(x+(q-m)h). This defines the Gr√ºnwald‚ÄìLetnikov derivative. To simplify notation, we set: :\\\\Delta^q_h f(x) = \\\\sum_{0 \\\\le m < \\\\infty}(-1)^m {q \\\\choose m}f(x+(q-m)h). So the Gr√ºnwald‚ÄìLetnikov derivative may be succinctly written as: :\\\\mathbb{D}^q f(x) = \\\\lim_{h \\\\to 0}\\\\frac{\\\\Delta^q_h f(x)}{h^q}. =An alternative definition= In the preceding section, the general first principles equation for integer order derivatives was derived. It can be shown that the equation may also be written as :f^{(n)}(x) = \\\\lim_{h \\\\to 0} \\\\frac{(-1)^n}{h^n}\\\\sum_{0 \\\\le m \\\\le n}(-1)^m {n \\\\choose m}f(x+mh). or removing the restriction that n must be a positive integer: :\\\\mathbb{D}^q f(x) = \\\\lim_{h \\\\to 0} \\\\frac{(-1)^q}{h^q}\\\\sum_{0 \\\\le m < \\\\infty}(-1)^m {q \\\\choose m}f(x+mh). This equation is called the reverse Gr√ºnwald‚ÄìLetnikov derivative. If the substitution h ‚Üí ‚àíh is made, the resulting equation is called the direct Gr√ºnwald‚ÄìLetnikov derivative:http://www.diogenes.bg/fcaa/volume7/fcaa74/74_Ortigueira_Coito.pdf :\\\\mathbb{D}^q f(x) = \\\\lim_{h \\\\to 0} \\\\frac{1}{h^q}\\\\sum_{0 \\\\le m < \\\\infty}(-1)^m {q \\\\choose m}f(x-mh).

Corral on October 26, 1881. They killed brothers Tom and Frank McLaury and Billy Clanton. All three Earp brothers had been the target of repeated death threats made by the Cowboys who were upset by the Earps' interference in their illegal activities. All four lawmen were charged with murder by Ike Clanton, who had run from the gunfight. During a month-long preliminary hearing, Judge Wells Spicer exonerated the men, concluding they had been performing their duty. But two months later on December 28, friends of the slain outlaws retaliated, ambushing Virgil. They shot him in the back, hitting him with three shotgun rounds, shattering his left arm and leaving him permanently maimed. The Cowboys suspected were let off for lack of evidence. His brother Morgan Earp was assassinated in March 1882. Charges against those suspected were dismissed on a technicality. Wyatt Earp, appointed as deputy U.S. Marshal to replace Virgil, concluded he could not rely on civil justice and decided to take matters into his own hands. Wyatt assembled a federal posse that included their brother Warren Earp and set out on a vendetta to kill those they felt were responsible. Virgil left Tombstone to recuperate from his wounds in Colton, California where his parents lived. Virgil married before he left to serve in the Union Army during the American Civil War. When he returned, his wife and child had left. He held a variety of other jobs throughout his life, though he primarily worked in law enforcement. His younger brother Wyatt, who spent most of his life as a gambler, became better known as a lawman because of writer Stuart N. Lake's fictionalized 1931 biography Wyatt Earp: Frontier Marshal and later portrayals of him in movies and fiction as Old West's \\"toughest and deadliest gunmen of his day.\\" In 1898, Virgil learned that his first wife Ellen Rysdam and their daughter were living in Oregon and reestablished contact with them. After suffering from pneumonia for six months, Virgil died on October 19, 1905. Early life Virgil Earp was born in Hartford, Kentucky, the second son of Nicholas Earp and Virginia Ann Cooksey. =Marries Ellen Rysdam= In February 1860, while living in Pella, Iowa, 16-year-old Virgil eloped with 17-year-old Dutch immigrant Magdalena C. \\"Ellen\\" Rysdam (October 25, 1842 in Utrecht, Netherlands ‚Äì May 3, 1910 in Cornelius, Oregon). One report states that they saw each other only occasionally and kept their marriage secret until Ellen was about to deliver their first child. When her parents Gerrit Rysdam and Magdalena Catrina Van Velzen learned of the marriage, they were furious, as they preferred that she marry a man who was also Dutch. Virgil's father thought he was too young to marry. Both parents wanted to get the marriage annulled. One source reports that Rysdam was successful, but another says her father failed because Virgil and Ellen refused to reveal where they had been married. They also claimed they had used false names, which would have made the marriage invalid in any case. Virgil and Ellen remained together for a year in spite of his and her parents' disapproval. On July 26, 1861, Virgil enlisted at age 18 in the Union Army. Ellen had a daughter named Nellie Jane, born January 7, 1862 or in July 1862. Virgil was mustered in to the Illinois Volunteer Infantry for three years on September 21, 1862. =Serves in Civil War= Virgil was assigned to the 83rd Illinois Infantry on August 21, 1863. The 83rd was primarily on garrison duty in Tennessee. Virgil was court martialed for a minor offense and docked two weeks pay as punishment. In the summer of 1863 while Virgil was on active duty, Ellen's father told her that Virgil had been killed in Tennessee. In early 1864, Ellen married a Dutch man named John Van Rossum, and in May of that year they joined a large group who relocated from Pella, Iowa, to the Oregon Territory. When Virgil was discharged from the military on June 26, 1865, he returned to Iowa but could not find his wife and daughter. He hired on at a local farm and helped operate a grocery store, before leaving for California to join the rest of the Earp family. In 1868, Nicholas Earp took the family east again, eventually settling in Lamar, Missouri. On August 28, 1870, Virgil married Rosella Dragoo (born in France in 1853) in Lamar. His father as justice of the peace married them, but there are no further records of Rosella. =Meets Allie Sullivan= Alvira \\"Allie\\" P Sullivan, Virgil's Earp's future wife, at age 16. They met in Council Bluffs, Iowa, when she was 25 in 1874. Virgil later met Alvira \\"Allie\\" Sullivan from Florence, Nebraska in 1874. She was a waitress at the Planter's House Hotel in Council Bluffs, Iowa. They never married but remained together the rest of his life. During the remainder of his life, Virgil worked at a variety of jobs, including peace officer, farmer, rail construction in Wyoming, stagecoach driver, sawmill sawyer in Prescott, Arizona Territory, mailman, and later in life, prospector. The Earp brothers were close and often moved together, seeking a better life. Virgil spent time in Dodge City, Kansas in 1877 with his younger brother Wyatt, and though there is no record of Virgil ever holding any law enforcement position there, Allie claimed he briefly worked as a deputy town marshal with Wyatt. =Arrival in Arizona= From Dodge City, Virgil and Allie moved to Prescott in July 1877, the capital of the Arizona Territory. First published in Real West Magazine in January 1982. Annotated by Robert F. Palmquist Virgil first delivered mail in Miller Valley, then later owned a saw mill at the base of Thumb Butte, just west of Prescott. In October 1877, U.S. Marshal Wiley Standifer, Yavapai County Sheriff Edward Franklin Bowers, Prescott Constable Frank Murray, Virgil Earp, and a man named McCall attempted to arrest John Tallos and an accused murderer named Wilson. While the others rode on horseback or carriages, Virgil ran on foot after the posse that pursued the two men to the edge of town, where a gun fight broke out. Virgil spotted one of the two men under a tree, reloading his pistol. Using a Henry rifle from a distance, Virgil shot him through the head, killing him. Virgil was shortly afterward offered a job as a driver for Patterson, Caldwell & Levally, a local freight company, during which he met John J. Gosper, Secretary of the Arizona Territory, and usually acting in the place of Governor John C. Fr√©mont, who was usually absent. When Crawley Dake was appointed U.S. Marshal, he and Virgil became friends. In 1878, Virgil was appointed as Prescott's night watchman, which paid $75 a month. In November 1878, he was elected as constable for Prescott, for which he received fees for issuing licenses, collecting fees, and serving summonses. While constable, Virgil wrote his brother Wyatt about the opportunities in the silver-mining boomtown of Tombstone. In September 1879, Wyatt resigned as assistant marshal in Dodge City. Accompanied by his common-law wife Mattie Blaylock, his brother Jim and his wife Bessie, \\"Doc Holliday\\" and Big Nose Kate, they left for Arizona Territory. Appointed deputy U.S. marshal Knowing Virgil was moving to Tombstone, and knowing of his peace officer background, U.S. Marshal Crawley Dake appointed Virgil as deputy U.S. marshal for the Tombstone District of Pima County, on November 27, 1879. He was instructed by Dake to help resolve ongoing problems with outlaw Cowboys. But the job didn't pay much. He was mostly on call helping county and city officials. In an interview after he left Tombstone, Virgil said that \\"The first stage that went out of Prescott toward Tombstone was robbed. Robberies were frequent and became expensive.\\" Virgil and his brothers Wyatt and Jim and their wives arrived together in Tombstone on December 1, 1879. =Tombstone City Marshal= On October 30, 1880, after town marshal Fred White was accidentally shot and killed by outlaw and gunman \\"Curly Bill\\" Brocius, Virgil was also appointed acting town marshal of Tombstone. Virgil now held both the more powerful local town marshal position and the prestigious federal law enforcement appointment. As town marshal, Virgil earned a regular salary of $100 a month plus a percentage of city taxes he collected. But Virgil did not hold the job for long. The city held a special election on November 13, and Tombstone city policemen James Flynn and Ben Sippy competed for the job. But then Flynn dropped out of the race and Sippy beat Virgil for the office, 311 votes to Earp's 259. On January 4, 1881, the city held its first regular election, and Virgil lost to Sippy once again. However, Sippy was known to be in financial trouble. He requested a two-week leave of absence on June 6, 1881, and never returned. The city council once again appointed Virgil as temporary city marshal. On June 22, the center section of Tombstone was devastated by a fire. Virgil kept looting under control and chased off lot jumpers who tried to take over property. On June 28, it was learned that Sippy had left about $3,000 in bad debt and financial improprieties in his office. Virgil was appointed by Tombstone Mayor John Clum as the permanent city marshal and paid $150.00 per month. =Conflict with Cowboys= To reduce crime in Tombstone, the City Council enacted an ordinance in April 1881 that prohibited anyone from carrying a deadly weapon in town. Everyone was required to deposit their weapons at a livery or saloon soon after entering town. A long-simmering feud between the Earps and some of the Cowboys played a big role in a gunfight that broke out when Virgil decided to enforce the ordinance on Wednesday, October 26, 1881. Virgil was told by several concerned citizens that several Cowboys, who had been threatening the Earps for several months, were in town and armed in violation of the ordinance. Assisted by his deputy Morgan Earp and temporary deputies Wyatt Earp and John \\"Doc\\" Holliday, Virgil went to disarm Frank and Tom McLaury, Ike and Billy Clanton, and Billy Claiborne. That confrontation turned into a shootout now known as the Gunfight at the O.K. Corral. =Gunfight at the O.K. Corral= The gunfight and later media portrayals made Wyatt Earp a legend. He is often depicted as the central lawman, but he was only Virgil's temporary assistant. Wyatt had acted as city marshal the week prior when Virgil was out of town. Virgil was the city marshal and deputy U.S. marshal. Although Wyatt had previously served in Wichita, Kansas, and Dodge City as a lawman, Virgil had three years of Civil War service, which had given him more combat and shooting experience. He had also served as a lawman off and on since the war. Before the Gunfight at the O.K. Corral, Wyatt had been in only one shootout and Morgan had never been in any gun battles. Billy Claiborne had been in one gunfight prior to the shootout and was the only member of the Cowboy faction that had prior gunfighting experience (not counting the Skeleton Canyon massacre, in which the McLaurys and Clantons took part). Doc Holliday, despite his reputation, had no documented gunfights to his credit, other than a couple of drunken brawls, and only his own tales of fights with unnamed men he claimed to have shot. Both Tom and Ike had spent the night gambling, drinking heavily, and without sleep. Now they were both out-of-doors, both wounded from having been pistol-whipped by the Earps earlier that morning, and at least Ike was still drunk. Virgil initially avoided a confrontation with Frank McLaury and Billy Clanton, who had arrived in town early that afternoon and had not yet deposited their weapons at a hotel or stable soon after their arrival, as required by ordinance #9. But around 1:00 p.m., a miner named Ruben F. Coleman told Virgil that the Cowboys had left the Dunbar and Dexter Stable for the O.K. Corral and were still armed, and Virgil decided he had to disarm them. Virgil testified after the shootout that he thought he saw all four men, Ike Clanton, Billy Clanton, Frank McLaury, and Tom McLaury, buying cartridges at Spangenberg's gun shop beforehand. From Turner, Alford (Ed.), The O. K. Corral Inquest (1992) He went by the Wells Fargo office around the corner on Allen Street and picked up a 10- or 12-gauge short, double-barreled shotgun. It was an unusually cold and windy day in Tombstone, and Virgil was wearing a long overcoat. To avoid alarming Tombstone's public, Virgil hid the shotgun under his overcoat when he returned to Hafford's Saloon. Virgil, his brothers Wyatt and Morgan, and Doc Holliday confronted the Cowboys in a narrow lot on Fremont Street. Virgil was not expecting a fight. He later testified that when he saw the Cowboys, he immediately commanded them to \\"Throw up your hands, I want your guns!\\" But general shooting broke out almost immediately. Witnesses were conflicted about who fired first. During the gunfight, Billy Clanton and both McLaury brothers were killed. Virgil was shot through the calf (he thought by Billy Clanton). Three days after the O.K. Corral gunfight, the city council suspended Virgil as city marshal pending outcome of the preliminary hearing. Virgil was eventually exonerated of wrongdoing, but his reputation suffered thereafter. =Assassination attempt= The Longhorn Restaurant is located where the Huachuca Water Company, and the Meyers Brothers clothing store was located. The original building burned in 1942. Virgil Earp was shot from the second floor. After the Gunfight at the O.K. Corral the Earps relocated their families to the Cosmopolitan Hotel for mutual support and protection. At about 11:30 pm on December 28, 1881, Virgil was ambushed as he walked from the Oriental Saloon to his room. The Sacramento Daily Record-Union reported that \\"he was fired upon with double-barreled shotguns, loaded with buckshot, by three men concealed in an unfinished building diagonally across on Allen street.\\" Virgil was hit in the back and left arm by three loads of buckshot from about . The Crystal Palace Saloon and the Eagle Brewery beyond Virgil were struck by nineteen buckshot; three passed through the window and one about a foot over the heads of some men standing by a faro-table. George Parsons wrote that he heard \\"four shots in quick succession.\\" Critically wounded, Virgil staggered into the hotel. \\"One shot struck him above the groin, coming out near the spine.\\" The humerus bone in his upper arm was longitudinally fractured. Dr. George E. Goodfellow removed of shattered humerus bone from Virgil's left arm, leaving his arm permanently crippled, and twenty buckshot from his side. While the doctor worked on his arm, Virgil told his wife Allie, \\"Never mind, I've got one arm left to hug you with.\\" Virgil was also shot through the back above the hip, which penetrated his body and lodged near the hip bone above the groin. The Los Angeles Daily Herald reported that the \\"cow-boys are bent on vengeance for the slaughter of their companeros a few weeks ago.\\" \\"The doctor says there are four chances in five that he will die.\\" George W. Parsons, who had been treated by Goodfellow for an injury he received, was staying in Goodfellow's office while he recuperated. He kept a journal, in which he recorded: =Others threatened= Wyatt, assuming that Virgil was dying, telegraphed U.S. Marshal Crawley Dake asking him to name him as Virgil's replacement as deputy U.S. marshal: Commenting on the telegram received by Dake, the Weekly Arizona Miner wrote about the repeated threats received by the Earps and others. > For some time, the Earps, Doc Holliday, Tom Fitch and others who upheld and > defended the Earps in their late trial have received, almost daily, > anonymous letters, warning them to leave town or suffer death, supposed to > have been written by friends of the Clanton and McLowry boys, three of whom > the Earps and Holliday killed and little attention was paid to them as they > were believed to be idle boasts but the shooting of Virgil Earp last night > shows that the men were in earnest. The Los Angeles Herald reported on > December 30 that \\"the \\"local authorities are doing nothing to capture the > assassins so far as is known ... Judge Spicer, Marshal Williams, Wyatt Earp, > Rickabaugh and other are in momentary danger of assassination.\\" =Suspects= The suspected shooters were later identified as Phin Clanton, Ike Clanton, Johnny Barnes, Johnny Ringo, Hank Swilling and Pete Spence. On Tuesday, January 31, 1882 Ike and Phin were brought before Judge William H. Stilwell on suspicion of shooting Virgil. The district attorney asked that bail be set at $5,000, but the judge released both men on $1,500 bond, indicating he thought the prosecution's case was weak. Although a hat that Wyatt later claimed belonged to Ike Clanton was found near the shooting, the evidence was circumstantial. Sherman McMaster provided the most convincing evidence. He testified that he saw Ike later that night in nearby Charleston. He said he asked Clanton \\"about the shooting, at which Clanton replied that he 'would have to go back and do the job over.'\\" On February 2, Clanton's attorney brought in seven witnesses who provided an alibi for Clanton. They all testified that Clanton had been in Charleston at the time of Virgil's shooting. Spicer was compelled to release Clanton. =Departs for California= After his shooting, Virgil spent the next three months recuperating. He was just starting to get back on his feet when on Saturday, March 18, 1882, Virgil's younger brother Morgan Earp was killed in another ambush. On Monday, March 20, Virgil and Allie were escorted by Wyatt and deputies Warren Earp, Doc Holliday, Sherman McMaster, and \\"Turkey Creek\\" Jack Johnson to Contention, where they drove two wagons to the Arizona and New Mexico Railroad terminal away in Benson. Wyatt and his deputies had initially planned to travel only as far as Benson. Wyatt reported later that he received word in Contention that Ike Clanton, Frank Stilwell, Hank Swilling, and another cowboy were watching the passenger trains in Tucson with the aim to kill Virgil. Wyatt and the rest of the posse remained with Virgil and Allie through to Tucson. The men were well armed with pistols, rifles and shotguns. McMaster wore two cartridge belts. Allie wore Virgil's pistol belt during the journey so it would be handy. Virgil told the San Francisco Examiner two months later that upon getting off the train in Tucson, \\"Almost the first men we met on the platform there were Stilwell and his friends, armed to the teeth.\\" \\"They fell back into the crowd as soon as they saw I had an escort, and the boys took me to the hotel to supper.\\" Guarded by his brothers and the deputies, Virgil and Allie had dinner at Porter's Hotel in Tucson. Virgil was so weak he had to be carried up the steps of the train. Once they were safely seated, the rest of the guards kept watch for the Cowboys. As Virgil's train was pulling out of Tucson on its way to California, gunfire was heard. Witnesses gave contradictory accounts about the number of men seen near the tracks and numbers of shots fired. Some said the Earps were armed after leaving Porter's Hotel and others said they were not. Witnesses saw men running with weapons but could not identify anyone in the dark. Wyatt said later that he and his deputies spotted Frank Stilwell and another man he believed to be Ike Clanton armed with shotguns lying on a flatcar. Virgil and Allie along with James accompanied Morgan's body to the Earp family home in Colton, California. When Wyatt and his men approached, the two men ran. Stilwell may have stumbled or been wounded, allowing Wyatt to reach him. Wyatt later said he shot Stilwell as Stilwell attempted to push the barrel of Earp's shotgun away. Wyatt, quoted in the Denver Republican, said \\"I ran straight for Stilwell. It was he who killed my brother. What a coward he was! He couldn't shoot when I came near him. He stood there helpless and trembling for his life. As I rushed upon him he put out his hands and clutched at my shotgun. I let go both barrels, and he tumbled down dead and mangled at my feet.\\" He said Stilwell cried \\"Morg!\\" before he was killed. Stilwell's body, riddled with buckshot from two shotgun rounds, one in his leg and the second in his chest with powder burns, and four other bullet wounds, was found the next morning near the tracks. Ike Clanton got away. When the Tucson sheriff learned who was responsible for Stilwell's death, he issued warrants for the lawmen's arrest. Clanton gave an interview afterward to the newspapers in which he claimed that he and Stilwell had been in Tucson to respond to federal charges about interfering with a U.S. mail carrier, stemming from his alleged involvement in robbing the Sandy Bob line of the Bisbee stage on September 8, 1881. Clanton said that they had heard that the Earps were coming via the train and they had plans to kill Stilwell. According to Clanton, Stilwell disappeared from the hotel before he was found several blocks away, shot dead by the tracks. Later life and death After Virgil was ambushed and maimed in Tombstone, he and Allie moved to his parents' home in Colton, California, to recover from his wounds, which took almost two years. He sought treatment for his wounds in San Francisco and was interviewed on the Southern Pacific train by a reporter whose story was printed in the San Francisco Examiner on May 27, 1882. The reporter described Virgil's appearance: Despite the use of only one arm, Virgil was hired by the Southern Pacific Railroad to guard its tracks in Colton's famous \\"battle of the crossing\\". Virgil carried a break top revolver that could be reloaded with one hand.Virgil Walter Earp in Goldfield Southern Pacific was attempting to stop the California Southern Railroad, a subsidiary of the Atchison, Topeka and Santa Fe Railway, from installing a crossing over the Southern Pacific tracks in Colton to gain access to California, which resulted in the frog war. Governor Waterman deputized a posse from San Bernardino, California and came down in person to enforce construction of the crossing, ending the Southern Pacific's railroad monopoly in Southern California. In 1884 Earp's father, Nicholas Porter Earp was elected justice of the peace in Colton. Two years later, Virgil Earp opened a private detective agency, which by all accounts he had quit by 1886, when he was elected village constable in July. When Colton was incorporated as a city, Earp was elected as Colton's first City Marshal on July 11, 1887. He was paid $75 a month and was re-elected to another term in 1888. Among other duties, he was reported to have cleared blocked sewers and kept track of the electric light bulbs. Virgil and Allie Earp's Colton home still stands at 528 West \\"H\\" Street. In 1888 Earp resigned as city marshal and he and Allie left Colton for San Bernardino. Five years later, in 1893, he and his wife moved to the short-lived mining town Vanderbilt, California. He owned and operated the only two story building in town, Earp's Hall, a saloon and meeting hall used for public gatherings and even the town's church services. His business success in Vanderbilt did not match his success in politics, and he lost the election for town constable in 1894. In 1895, Virgil and Allie traveled to Cripple Creek, Colorado, where they met Virgil's brother Wyatt. They stayed briefly and soon moved back to Prescott in Yavapai County, Arizona, where Virgil became involved in mining. Virgil started mining in the Hassayampa district in partnership with W.H. Harlon. They leased the Grizzly mine owned by W.C. Hanson. The Prescott Weekly Journal-Miner reported on November 8, 1896 that the day before \\"a serious accident had occurred at this mine. Virgil Earp and W. H. Harlon were working in a tunnel. The ground caved catching Mr. Earp and pinning him to the ground. He was unconscious for several hours and Dr. Abbott, was called to dress his wounds.\\" The doctor told Earp he had dislocated his right hip. Both his feet and ankles were badly crushed, he had a serious cut on his head and bruises all over his body. The doctor said it would be several weeks before Virgil would be able to move around again, but it took him much longer to recover. They moved south after that and began ranching in the Kirkland Valley. Virgil was nominated as a candidate for Yavapai County, Arizona sheriff in 1900, but pulled out of the election for health reasons. =Reunites with first wife= In 1898 Earp received a startling letter from a Mrs. Levi Law. At the end of the Civil War, his wife Ellen was told by her family that Virgil had been killed. Her family had been against their marriage. They took her and the baby daughter Nellie to Walla Walla, Washington, where she later married Thomas Eaton. She had four more children. Mrs. Levi Law was Virgil's daughter, Nellie. The next year, encouraged by his wife, Virgil traveled to Portland, Oregon, where he was reunited with Ellen and Nellie Jane Law. On April 22, 1898, The Oregonian reported that Earp \\"... is now enjoying a very pleasant visit with her and his two grandchildren at her home, which is near that of Mrs. Eaton, in North Portland.\\" He also met three grandchildren he never knew existed. Later that year, according to her letter to The Oregonian, Nellie Jane visited Virgil and Allie Earp at their home in Arizona. =Death in Nevada= Virgil Earp Headstone located in River View Cemetery, Portland, Oregon Virgil Earp grave site in River View Cemetery, Portland, Oregon Before 1904, Virgil and Allie returned to Colton, where city records show that he along with three others unsuccessfully petitioned the city leaders to repeal a temperance law that allowed only one saloon in town. In 1904, they left California for the last time and moved to the boom town of Goldfield, Nevada, where Virgil planned to open a saloon. He quickly discovered there was plenty of competition and realized he didn't have the capital required. Virgil and Allie were down to their last dollar so he took up gambling, at which he had been good. In November 1904 Virgil took a job as a special officer at the National Club. He was responsible for watching over the high stakes gambling tables. In January 1905 he was hired as a deputy sheriff for Esmeralda County, Nevada, where he continued his duties at the National Club. Virgil caught pneumonia in February 1905, and his brother Wyatt visited him that month. Earp got better slowly and attended an Order of Eagles meeting in May. The serious injuries he had sustained during the mine cave-in several years earlier had left him debilitated and he never recovered his full health. Earp's recovery from pneumonia did not last and in early October he had a relapse. On October 19, 1905 Earp died at St. Mary's hospital in Goldfield. In her memoirs, Allie wrote that Virgil's last words were, \\"Light my cigar, and stay here and hold my hand.\\"SOODALTER, RON Wyatt Earp: Law, Order, and a Game of Chance March 2016 Wyatt was the last surviving participant of the Gunfight at the O.K. Corral. Virgil was also survived by his father Nicholas, brothers James and Newton, wife Allie, and daughter Nellie. At the request of his daughter, Nellie Jane Bohn, Allie sent his body to Portland, Oregon, and he was buried in the River View Cemetery there.

Described as the Moses of his people,Hicks, p. 353 Ross influenced the Indian nation through such tumultuous events as the relocation to Indian Territory and the American Civil War. John Ross was the son of a Cherokee mother and a Scottish father. His mother and maternal grandmother were of mixed Scots- Cherokee ancestry, since his maternal grandfather was another Scottish immigrant. At the time among the matrilineal Cherokee, anyone born of a Cherokee mother was counted as a Cherokee, and a member of her clan. As a result, young John (in modern times counted as one-eighth Cherokee by blood quantum) grew up bilingual and bicultural, an experience that served him well when his parents decided to send him to schools that served other mixed-race Cherokee. After graduation, he was appointed an Indian agent in 1811. During the War of 1812, he served as adjutant of a Cherokee regiment under the command of Andrew Jackson. After the Red Stick War ended, Ross demonstrated his business acumen by starting a tobacco plantation in Tennessee. In 1816, he built a warehouse and trading post on the Tennessee River north of the mouth of Chattanooga Creek, and started a ferry service that carried passengers from the south side of the river (Cherokee Nation) to the north side (USA). His businesses served as the start of a community known as Ross's Landing on the Tennessee River (now modern-day Chattanooga, Tennessee). Concurrently, John Ross developed a keen interest in Cherokee politics, attracting the attention of the Cherokee elders, especially Principal Chiefs Pathkiller and Charles R. Hicks, who, along with Major Ridge, became his political mentors. Ross first went to Washington, D.C. in 1816 as part of a Cherokee delegation to negotiate issues of national boundaries, land ownership and white encroachment. As the only delegate fluent in English, Ross became the principal negotiator, despite his relative youth. When he returned to the Cherokee Nation in 1817, he was elected to the National Council. He became council president in the following year. The majority of the council were men like Ross, who were wealthy, educated, English-speaking and of mixed blood. Even the traditionalist full- blood Cherokee perceived that he had the skills necessary to contest the whites' demands that the Cherokee cede their land and move beyond the Mississippi River. In this position, Ross's first action was to reject an offer of $200,000 from the US Indian agent made for the Cherokee to voluntarily relocate. Thereafter Ross made more trips to Washington, even as white demands intensified. In 1824, Ross boldly petitioned Congress for redress of Cherokee grievances, making the Cherokee the first tribe ever to do so. Along the way, Ross built political support in the US capital for the Cherokee cause. Both Pathkiller and Charles R. Hicks died in January 1827. Hicks's brother, William, was appointed interim chief. Ross and Major Ridge shared responsibilities for the affairs of the tribe. William Hicks did not impress the Cherokee as a leader. They elected Ross as permanent principal chief in October 1828, a position he held until his death. The problem of removal split the Cherokee Nation politically. Ross, backed by the vast majority, tried repeatedly to stop white political powers from forcing the tribe to move. They became known as the National Party. Others, who came to believe that further resistance would be futile, wanted to seek the best settlement they could get. They formed the \\"Treaty Party\\" or \\"Ridge Party,\\" led by Major Ridge. The much smaller Treaty Party negotiated with the US and signed the Treaty of New Echota on December 29, 1835, requiring the Cherokee to leave by 1838. Neither Chief Ross nor the council ever approved it, nevertheless the US government regarded the treaty as valid. Chief Ross and tens of thousands of traditional Cherokee people objected, and voted to not comply with an invalid treaty, which had been supported by a few hundred mostly assimilated Cherokee. To enforce the treaty, the US government ordered their Army to move those who did not depart by 1838 in an action known ever after as the \\"Trail of Tears.\\" Some Cherokee remained in the wilderness to evade the army, and this remnant became the ancestors of the Eastern Band of Cherokee Indians. About one-fourth of the Cherokee who were forced to move died along the trail as they walked. The dead included Chief Ross's wife, Quatie. Ross tried unsuccessfully to restore political unity after the arrival in Indian Territory. Unknown people assassinated the leaders of the Treaty Party, except for Stand Watie, who escaped and became Ross's most implacable foe. Soon, the issue of slavery refueled the old division. The Treaty Party morphed into the \\"Southern Party,\\" while the National Party largely became the \\"Union Party.\\" Ross initially counseled neutrality, believing that joining in the \\"white man's war\\" would be disastrous for the future unity of their tribe. After Union Forces abandoned their forts in Indian Territory, Ross reversed himself and signed a treaty with the Confederacy. He later fled to Union-held Kansas and Stand Watie became the de facto chief. The Confederates lost the war, Watie became the last Confederate general to surrender, and Ross returned to his post as principal chief. Confronted with negotiating the Reconstruction Treaty with the United States, he made yet another trip to Washington, where he died on August 1, 1866. Early life and education House built in early 19th century by John McDonald, maternal grandfather of John Ross. Now called the \\"John Ross House,\\" it was occupied by Ross's daughter and her husband, Nicholas Scales. It is located in Rossville, Georgia. The John Ross House during the US Civil War Ross (also known by his Cherokee name, Guwisguwi)Also spelled \\"Cooweescoowee\\" according to Woodward, p. 157 was born in Turkeytown (in modern day Alabama), near the head of the Coosa River, to Mollie (n√©e McDonald) and her husband Daniel Ross, an immigrant Scots trader. His siblings who survived to adulthood included Jane Ross Coodey (1787‚Äì1844), Elizabeth Grace Ross Ross (1789‚Äì1876), Lewis Ross (1796‚Äì1870), Andrew 'Tlo-s-ta-ma' Ross (1798‚Äì1840), Margaret Ross Hicks (1803‚Äì1862) and Maria Ross Mulkey (1806‚Äì1838). =Genealogy= Because his mother and grandmother were mixed- race Cherokee, under the matrilineal tradition, Ross belonged to her Bird Clan.Mankiller and Wallis 85 His great-grandmother Ghigooie, a full-blood Cherokee, had married William Shorey, a Scottish interpreter. Their daughter, Anna, married John McDonald, a Scots trader.Robert Bieder, \\"Sault-Ste. Marie and the War of 1812\\", Indiana Magazine of History, XCV (Mar 1999), accessed 13 Dec 2008 John Ross Home, Rossville, Georgia. The House was built in 1797 by John McDonald, grandfather of John Ross, and was Ross's home until he left on the \\"Trail of Tears\\". =Childhood and education= Ross spent his childhood with his parents in near Lookout Mountain. Educated in English by white men in a frontier American environment, Ross spoke the Cherokee language poorly, but his bi-cultural background later allowed him to represent the Cherokee to the United States government. Many full-blood Cherokee frequented his father's trading company, so he encountered tribal members on many levels. As a child, Ross participated in tribal events, such as the Green Corn Festival. The elder Ross insisted that John also receive a rigorous classical education. After being educated at home, Ross pursued higher studies with the Reverend Gideon Blackburn, who established two schools in southeast Tennessee for Cherokee children. Classes were in English and students were mostly of mixed race, like Ross. The young Ross finished his education at an academy in South West Point, near Kingston, Tennessee. =Anglo Metis background of the Cherokee Moses= Ross's life resembled prominent Anglo-M√©tis in the northern United States and Canada. Scots and English fur traders in North America were typically men of social status and financial standing who married high-ranking Native American women. Both sides believed these were strategic alliances, helping the Native Americans and the traders. They educated their children in bi-cultural and multilingual environments. The mixed-race children often married and rose to positions of stature in society, both in political and economic terms. Robert E. Bieder, \\"Sault-Ste. Marie and the War of 1812\\", Indiana Magazine of History, XCV (Mar 199MMM9), accessed 14 Dec 2008 =Family life= John Ross survived two wives and had several children. He married Elizabeth \\"Quatie\\" Brown Henley (1791‚Äì1839) in 1812 or 1813. She was a Cherokee, born in 1791 and a widow with one child. Her previous husband, Robert Henley, may have died during the War of 1812. Moser, Krystan. \\"A Final Resting Place.\\" May 8, 2014. Accessed January 11, 2016. Quatie Ross died in 1839 in Arkansas on the Trail of Tears as discussed below, but was survived by their children James McDonald Ross (1814‚Äì1864), William Allen Ross (1817‚Äì1891), Jane Ross Meigs-Nave (1821‚Äì1894), Silas Dean Ross (1829‚Äì1872) and George Washington Ross (1830‚Äì1870). John Ross remarried in 1844, to Mary Stapler (1826‚Äì1865) whom he survived by less than a year. Their surviving children were Annie Brian Ross Dobson (1845‚Äì1876) and John Ross Jr. (1847‚Äì1905), although John Ross Sr. would be succeeded as chief by his nephew John P. Ross.https://www.findagrave.com/cgi-bin/fg.cgi?page=gr&GRid;=5786493 Careers =Indian agent= At the age of twenty, having completed his education and with bilingual skills, Ross received an appointment as US Indian agent to the western Cherokee and sent to their territory (in present-day Arkansas). During the War of 1812, he served as an adjutant in a Cherokee regiment. He fought under General Andrew Jackson at the Battle of Horseshoe Bend against the British-allied Upper Creek warriors, known as the Red Sticks. =Businessman and founder of Chattanooga= Ross began a series of business ventures which made him among the wealthiest of all Cherokee. He derived the majority of his wealth from cultivating tobacco in Tennessee worked by twenty slaves.The Papers of Chief John Ross, Volume I, ed. Gary E. Moulton (Norman: University of Oklahoma Press, 1985), p. 5.The Cherokee Nation jointly owned all land; however, improvements on the land could be sold or willed by individuals. It was passed through the matrilineal line, and property was controlled by the women of the tribe. In 1816 he founded Ross's Landing, served by a ferry crossing. After the Cherokee were removed to Oklahoma in the 1830s, American settlers changed the name of Ross's Landing to Chattanooga. In addition, Ross established a trading firm and warehouse. In total, he earned upwards of $1,000 a year ($ in today's terms). In 1827 Ross moved to Rome, Georgia, to be closer to New Echota, the Cherokee capital. In Rome, Ross established a ferry along the headwaters of the Coosa River close to the home of Major Ridge, an older wealthy and influential Cherokee leader. By December 1836, Ross's properties were appraised at $23,665 ($ today). He was then one of the five wealthiest men in the Cherokee Nation.The Papers of Chief John Ross, ed. Moulton (1985), pp. 457, 465. A young John Ross =Political apprenticeship= Between 1811 to 1827 Ross learned how to conduct negotiations with the United States and the skills required to run a national government. After 1814, Ross's political career as a Cherokee legislator and diplomat progressed with the support of individuals such as the Principal Chief Pathkiller,Arrell Morgan Gibson, Oklahoma, A History of Five Centuries, University of Oklahoma Press, 1981, p. 65 Assistant Principal Chief Charles R. Hicks, and Casey Holmes, an elder statesman of the Cherokee Nation, as well as the women elders of his clan. By 1813, as relations with the United States became more complex, older, uneducated chiefs such as Pathkiller could not effectively defend Cherokee interests. Ross's ascent showed Cherokee leaders recognized the importance of educated, English-speaking leaders. Both Pathkiller and Hicks trained Ross, who served as their clerk and worked on all financial and political matters of the nation. They also steeped him in Cherokee tradition. In a series of letters to Ross, Hicks outlined known Cherokee traditions.The Papers of Chief John Ross, Volume I, 1807‚Äì1839, p. 32. In 1816, the chief's council named Ross to his first delegation to American leaders in Washington D.C. The delegation of 1816 was directed to resolve sensitive issues, including national boundaries, land ownership, and white encroachment on Cherokee land. Only Ross was fluent in English, making him a central figure, although Cherokee society traditionally favored older leaders.Fred O. Gearing, Priests and Warriors: Social Structures for Cherokee Politics in the Eighteenth Century, (Menasha, Wisconsin: 1962), p. 40. In November 1817, the Cherokee formed the National Council. Ross was elected to the thirteen-member body, where each man served two-year terms. The National Council was created to consolidate Cherokee political authority after General then President Andrew Jackson made two treaties with small cliques of Cherokee representing minority factions. Membership in the National Council placed Ross among the Cherokee ruling elite. The majority of the men were wealthy, mixed- race and English-speaking, although most Cherokee still spoke only Cherokee. =President of the National Committee= In November 1818, just before the General Council meeting with the U.S. Indian agent Joseph McMinn assigned to deal with the Cherokee, Ross became president of the National Committee, a position he would hold through 1827. The Council selected Ross for that leadership position because they believed he had the diplomatic skills necessary to rebuff American requests to cede Cherokee lands. He soon refused McMinn's offer of $200,000 US, conditioned upon the Cherokee voluntarily removing themselves beyond the Mississippi. In 1819, the Council sent Ross to Washington, D.C.. He assumed a larger leadership role. The delegation proposed to clarify the provisions of the Treaty of 1817‚Äîboth to limit the ceded lands and clarify Cherokee right to the remaining lands. Secretary of War John C. Calhoun pressed Ross to cede large tracts of land in Tennessee and Georgia. Although he refused, the US government pressure continued and intensified. In October 1822, Calhoun requested that the Cherokee relinquish their land claimed by Georgia, in fulfillment of the United States' obligation under the Compact of 1802. Before responding to Calhoun's proposition, Ross first ascertained the sentiment of the Cherokee people. They were unanimously opposed to further cession of land. In January 1824, Ross traveled to Washington to defend the Cherokee possession of their land. Calhoun offered two solutions to the Cherokee delegation: either relinquish title to their lands and remove west, or accept denationalization and become citizens of the United States. Rather than accept Calhoun's ultimatum, Ross directly petitioned Congress for the Cherokee cause on April 15, 1824. This fundamentally altered the traditional relationship between an Indian nation and the US government. Never before had an Indian nation petitioned Congress with grievances. In Ross's correspondence, what had previously been the tone of petitions by submissive Indians was replaced by assertive defenders. Ross was able to argue subtle points about legal responsibilities as well as whites.This assertion is based on the records of the Congressional Serial Set, which are incomplete. However, the dates of extant memorials lend support to the idea that the Cherokee were the first nation to use Congress as a means of support. Some in Washington recognized the change. Future president John Quincy Adams wrote, \\"[T]here was less Indian oratory, and more of the common style of white discourse, than in the same chief's speech on their first introduction.\\"The Memoirs of John Quincy Adams, Volume 6, p. 373. Adams specifically noted Ross as \\"the writer of the delegation\\" and remarked that \\"they [had] sustained a written controversy against the Georgia delegation with greate[sic] advantage.\\" Georgia's delegation inadvertently acknowledged Ross's skill: an editorial published in The Georgia Journal charged that \\"the Cherokee delegation's letters were fraudulent\\" because \\"too refined to have been written or dictated by an Indian\\".The Papers of Chief John Ross, Volume I, 1807‚Äì1839, p. 78. Principal Chief of the Cherokee Nation In January 1827, Pathkiller, the Cherokee's principal chief and last hereditary chief, and, two weeks later, Charles R. Hicks, Ross's mentor, both died. Ross, as president of the National Committee and Major Ridge, as speaker of the National Council, were responsible for the affairs of the tribe.Hicks, p. 150 In a letter dated February 23, 1827, to Colonel Hugh Montgomery, the Cherokee agent, Ross wrote that with the death of Hicks, he had assumed responsibility for all public business of The Nation. Charles Hicks' brother William served briefly as interim chief until a permanent chief could be elected. Although he believed he was the natural heir to his brother's position, William Hicks had not impressed the tribe with his abilities. A majority of the people knew that during the year Ross, not Hicks, had taken care of all of the mundane business of the tribe. On October 17, 1828 the Cherokee elected John Ross as principal chief.Hicks, pp. 160‚Äì61. The Cherokee Council passed a series of laws creating a bicameral national government. In 1822 they created the Cherokee Supreme Court, capping the creation of a three-branch government. In May 1827, Ross was elected to the twenty-four member constitutional committee. It drafted a constitution calling for a principal chief, a council of the principal chiefs, and a National Committee, which together would form the General Council of the Cherokee Nation, a constitutional republic. Although the constitution was ratified in October 1827, it did not take effect until October 1828, at which point Ross was elected principal chief. He was repeatedly reelected and held this position until his death in 1866. He was very popular, among both full- bloods, who comprised three-fourths of the population, and mixed-bloods. The Cherokee had created a constitutional republic with delegated authority capable of formulating a clear, long-range policy to protect national rights. =Supreme Court litigation= John Ross in suit with top hat. Ross found support in Congress from individuals in the National Republican Party, such as senators Henry Clay, Theodore Frelinghuysen, and Daniel Webster and representatives Ambrose Spencer and David (Davy) Crockett. Despite this support, in April 1829, John H. Eaton, Secretary of War (1829‚Äì1831), informed Ross that President Jackson would support the right of Georgia to extend her laws over the Cherokee people. On December 8, 1829, President Andrew Jackson made a speech announcing his intention to pass a bill through Congress by the following spring requiring Indian tribes living in the Southeastern states to move west of the Mississippi.Woodward, Grace Steele. \\"The Cherokees.\\" University of Oklahoma Press. 1963. , p. 158 On December 19, 1829, the Georgia legislature, enacted a series of laws which confiscated a large section of Cherokee land, nullified Cherokee law within the confiscated area, banned further meetings of the Cherokee government in Georgia, declared contracts between Indians and whites null and void unless witnessed by two whites, disallowed Indians from testifying against a white person in court and forbade Cherokee to dig for gold on their own lands. The laws were made effective June 1, 1830.Woodward, pp. 158‚Äì59 These were calculated to force the Cherokee to move. In May 1830, Congress endorsed Jackson's policy of removal by passing the Indian Removal Act. Jackson signed the Act on May 23. It authorized the president to set aside lands west of the Mississippi to exchange for the lands of the Indian nations in the Southeast. In the summer of 1830, Jackson urged the Cherokee, Chickasaw, Choctaw and Creek to sign individual treaties accepting removal from their homelands. The Cherokee refused to attend a meeting in Nashville that Jackson proposed. The other tribes signed off on Jackson's terms.Woodward, p. 161 When Ross and the Cherokee delegation failed in their efforts to protect Cherokee lands through dealings with the executive branch and Congress, Ross took the radical step of defending Cherokee rights through the U.S. courts. In June 1830, at the urging of Senator Webster and Senator Frelinghuysen, the Cherokee delegation selected William Wirt, US Attorney General in the Monroe and Adams administrations, to defend Cherokee rights before the U.S. Supreme Court. Wirt argued two cases on behalf of the Cherokee: Cherokee Nation v. Georgia and Worcester v. Georgia. In Cherokee Nation v. Georgia,' Chief Justice John Marshall acknowledged that the Cherokee were a sovereign nation, stating, \\"[T]he Cherokees as a state, as a distinct political society, separated from others, capable of managing its own affairs and governing itself, has, in the opinion of a majority of the judges, been completely successful.\\" But he did not compel President Jackson to take action that would defend the Cherokee from Georgia's laws, because he did not find that the U.S. Supreme Court had original jurisdiction over a case in which a tribe was a party. In 1832, the Supreme Court further defined the relation of the federal government and the Cherokee Nation. In Worcester v. Georgia, the Court found that Georgia could not extend its laws to the Cherokee Nation because that was a power of the federal government. Marshall stated that \\"the acts of Georgia are repugnant to the Constitution, laws and treaties of the United States. They interfere forcibly with the relations established between the United States and the Cherokee nation, the regulation of which, according to the settled principles of our Constitution, are committed exclusively to the government of the Union.\\" The Cherokee were considered sovereign enough to legally resist the government of Georgia, and they were encouraged to do so. The court maintained that the Cherokee Nation was dependent on the federal government, much like a protectorate state, but still a sovereign entity. But the dispute was made moot when federal legislation in the form of the Indian Removal Act exercised the federal government's legal power to handle the whole affair. The series of decisions embarrassed Jackson politically, as Whigs attempted to use the issue in the 1832 election. They largely supported his earlier opinion that the \\"Indian Question\\" was one that was best handled by the federal government, and not local authorities. Meanwhile, the Cherokee Nation had encountered financial hard times. The U. S. government had stopped paying the agreed-upon $6,000 annuity for previous land cessions, Georgia had effectively cut off any income from the gold fields in Cherokee lands, and the Cherokee Nation's application for a federal government loan was rejected in February, 1831. With great difficulty (and private donations) Ross was able to pay the Cherokee Nation's legal bills.Woodward, p. 167. =Ridge Party opposition= In a meeting in May 1832, Supreme Court Justice John McLean spoke with the Cherokee delegation to offer his views on their situation. McLean's advice was to \\"remove and become a Territory with a patent in fee simple to the nation for all its lands and a delegate in Congress, but reserving to itself the entire right of legislation and selection of all officers.\\" He agreed to send Ross a letter explaining his views. Ross was furious, believing that this was a form of treachery.Langguth, p. 191 McLean's advice precipitated a split within the Cherokee leadership as John Ridge and Elias Boudinot began to doubt Ross's leadership. John Ridge introduced a resolution at the national council meeting in October, 1832 to send a delegation to Washington to discuss a removal treaty with President Jackson. The council rejected Ridge's proposal and instead selected Joseph Vann, John Baldridge, Richard Taylor and John Ross to represent the Cherokee.Woodward, p. 173 In February 1833, Ridge wrote Ross advocating that the delegation dispatched to Washington that month should begin removal negotiations with Jackson. Ridge and Ross did not have irreconcilable worldviews; neither believed that the Cherokee could fend off Georgian usurpation of Cherokee land. However, Ridge was furious that Ross had refused to consider Jackson's offer to pay the Cherokee $3,000,000 for all their lands in Georgia, Alabama and Tennessee.Woodward, p. 174 In this environment, Ross led a delegation to Washington in March 1834 to try to negotiate alternatives to removal. Ross made several proposals; however, the Cherokee Nation may not have approved any of Ross's plans, nor was there reasonable expectation that Jackson would settle for any agreement short of removal. These offers, coupled with the lengthy cross-continental trip, indicated that Ross's strategy was to prolong negotiations on removal indefinitely. There was the possibility that the next President might be more favorably inclined. Ross's strategy was flawed because it was susceptible to the United States' making a treaty with a minority faction. On May 29, 1834, Ross received word from John H. Eaton, that a new delegation, including Major Ridge, John Ridge, Elias Boudinot, and Ross's younger brother Andrew, collectively called the \\"Ridge Party\\" or \\"Treaty Party\\", had arrived in Washington with the goal of signing a treaty of removal. The two sides attempted reconciliation, but by October 1834 still had not come to an agreement. In January 1835 the factions were again in Washington. Pressured by the presence of the Ridge Party, Ross agreed on February 25, 1835, to exchange all Cherokee lands east of the Mississippi for land west of the Mississippi and 20 million dollars. He made it contingent on the General Council's accepting the terms. =Treaty of New Echota and Trail of Tears= Historical marker at the location of Ross' home in Bradley County, Tennessee. Secretary of War Lewis Cass believed this was yet another ploy to delay action on removal for an additional year, and threatened to sign the treaty with John Ridge. On November 7, 1835, Ross and his guest, John Howard Payne, were arrested by the Georgia guard at Ross' home in Flint Springs in Bradley County, Tennessee and taken to Spring Place, Georgia, where they were imprisoned. On December 29, 1835, the Treaty Party signed the Treaty of New Echota with the U.S. Most Cherokee thought the signatories unauthorized. However, Ross could not stop its enforcement. Under orders from President Martin Van Buren, General Winfield Scott and 7,000 Federal troops forced removal of Cherokee who did not emigrate to the Indian Territory by 1838. This forced removal came to be known as the Trail of Tears. Accepting defeat, Ross convinced General Scott to allow him to supervise much of the removal process. Returning to his home at Head of Coosa late at night, Ross saw a man he did not recognize at his house. He told the man to feed his horse and put him away for the night. Instead, the stranger followed him to the door, identified himself as Stephen Carter and told Ross that he now owned the property and had papers to prove it. Ross then learned agents of Georgia had given Carter possession of the house earlier in the week, after evicting his family. Dispossessed by Georgia (and Carter), Ross was now homeless. The next day, Ross found that family members had given his wife Quatie refuge.Hicks, pp. 252-3 Quatie was among the many Cherokee who died en route. According to one of the soldiers escorting the group, she had given her coat to a child that was crying because of the cold. A few days later, she died of pneumonia near Little Rock on the Arkansas River.Smith, p. 235. Because selling common lands was a capital crime under Cherokee law, treaty opponents assassinated Boudinot, Major Ridge and John Ridge after the migration to Indian Territory. Stand Watie, Boudinot's brother, was also attacked but he survived. The assassins were never publicly identified nor tried in court. General Matthew Arbuckle, commander of Fort Gibson, claimed he knew their identities but never tried to arrest them. Some Cherokee, particularly those tied to the pro-treaty party, claimed that Chief John Ross knew about the assassinations beforehand. Many years later, Chief Ross's son Allen, wrote that this was not so. Allen's letter, is said to be in the possession of the Oklahoma State Historical Society.\\"The Murder of Elias Boudinot.\\" Chronicles of Oklahoma. Vol. 12, No. 1. Unnamed author. Retrieved July 9, 2014. Afterward, there were years of violence between the two factions. Given the controversy over the struggle over territory and Ross's personal wealth, a vocal minority of Cherokee and a generation of political leaders in Washington considered Ross to be dictatorial, greedy, and an \\"aristocratic leader [who] sought to defraud\\" the Cherokee Nation.The Correspondence of Andrew Jackson, Volume V 1833-1838, ed. John Spencer Bassett (Washington, D.C.: Carnegie Institution of Washington, 1931), p. 350 Ross also had influential supporters in Washington, including Thomas L. McKenney, the Commissioner of Indian Affairs (1824‚Äì1830). He described Ross as the father of the Cherokee Nation, a Moses who \\"led...his people in their exodus from the land of their nativity to a new country, and from the savage state to that of civilization.\\"Thomas L. McKenny and James Hall, The Indian Tribes of North America, Volume III. (Edinburgh: John Grant, 1934), p. 310. =Remarriage= John Ross was introduced to the Stapler family of Brandywine Springs, Delaware by Thomas McKenney in 1841. Ross had many common interests with John Stapler, a merchant and widower. His eldest daughter, Sarah, cared for her younger siblings and befriended Ross. However, her younger sister, Mary Brian Stapler, developed a real love for Ross and initiated a romantic attachment in May 1844. As the time came for Ross to return to the Indian Territory, their mutual love ripened. They married in Philadelphia on September 2, 1844.Hicks, pp. 340‚Äì44 =American Civil War= The Civil War divided the Cherokee people. At first the majority supported the Confederacy, which protected their slaveholdings. Fearing that joining the Confederacy would void the earlier Cherokee treaties with the United States, Ross tried to persuade his people to remain neutral in the conflict, but eventually most chose sides. Full-bloods tended to favor maintaining relations with the United States. This group included over two thousand members of a traditionalist and abolitionist society, the Keetoowah Society.Cornsilk, David A. Cherokee Observer. \\"Footsteps ‚Äì Historical Perspective: History of the Keetoowah Cherokees\\", Cherokee Observer, October 1997, Retrieved July 18, 2013. Members of this group were called \\"Pins\\" by non-members because they wore an emblem of crossed pins on their shirts.Langguth, p. 389 Ross advocated that the Cherokee Nation remain neutral. It was a losing argument. At a general assembly on August 21, 1861, Ross ended his speech by announcing that in the interests of tribal and inter-Indian unity it was time to agree on an alliance with the Confederate States of America.Langguth, p. 390 Many of the well-armed mixed bloods, especially the wealthy led by Stand Watie, supported the Confederacy. Traditionalists and Cherokee who opposed the institution of slavery remained loyal to the Union. However, the majority of Cherokee may not have understood the nature of the new treaty.Warde, p. 59 After Ross departed to meet with President Lincoln in Washington, traditionalist Cherokee helped maneuver the selection of Ross supporter Thomas Pegg as Acting Principal Chief. Three or four of Ross's own sons fought for the Union. However, Ross's nephew by marriage, John Drew, had organized and served as Colonel of the 1st Cherokee Mounted Rifles in the Confederate Army. Most of Drew's regiment would later twice desert rather than follow Confederate orders to kill other Indians.Gaines, The Confederate Cherokees: John Drew's Regiment of Mounted Rifles (1989)Hauptman, Lawrence M. \\"American Indians and the Civil War.\\" In:American Indian Places: A Historical Guidebook, p. 378. Frances H. Kennedy, ed.(2008) Houghton Mifflin Co. New York. . Available on Google Books. Many leaders of the northern faction, still led by Ross, went to Fort Leavenworth, Kansas for the duration of the war.Hicks, pp. 345‚Äì46. By 1863, the flight of many Cherokee voters to refuge in Kansas and Texas provided the pro- Confederate Treaty Party an opportunity to elect Stand Watie as principal chief without them. Pro-Union National Council members declared the election invalid. Watie that fall raided Ross's home, Rose Cottage. The home was looted and burned. Ross lost all his belongings. Ross's daughter Jane and her husband, Andrew Nave, were living at Rose Cottage at the time. Nave was shot and killed.Langguth, p. 394 Only the prior intervention of Watie's wife seems to have prevented the killing of additional Ross relatives.Warde, p. 191. Ross's oldest son, James, who had gone to Park Hill searching for supplies, was captured and sent to prison in the Confederacy, where he died. Ross remained in exile. However, within a week of the burning, the National Council convened and restored Ross as principal chief.Hicks, p. 347. Ross took his wife Mary and the children to Philadelphia so she could see her family. Ross returned to Washington, where he had an inconclusive meeting with President Lincoln and other supporters. When he returned for Mary in 1865, he found her gravely ill with what was diagnosed as \\"lung congestion\\" (likely tuberculosis). She could not travel, so he remained with her for more than a month. Mary died of her illness on July 20, 1865. She was buried in her native Delaware. Ross returned to Indian Territory after her funeral.Hicks, pp. 346‚Äì458 After the war, the two factions of the Cherokee tried to negotiate separately with the US government Southern Treaty Commission. The commissioner of Indian Affairs, Dennis N. Cooley, was persuaded to believe allegations by Stand Watie and Elias Cornelius Boudinot that Ross was a dictator who did not truly represent the Cherokee people. Even though his health was worsening, Ross left Park Hill, where he was staying with his niece, on November 9, 1865, to meet with President Andrew Johnson. Johnson instructed Cooley to reopen negotiations with the Cherokee and to meet only with the pro-Union faction, headed by John Ross. Ross died on August 1, 1866 in Washington, D.C. while still negotiating a final treaty with the federal government. However, Ross had by then persuaded Johnson to reject a particularly harsh treaty version favored by Cooley.Hicks, pp. 370‚Äì71. Death and legacy Initially, Ross was buried beside his second wife Mary in Wilmington and Brandywine Cemetery in Wilmington, Delaware. A few months later, the Cherokee Nation returned his remains to the Ross Cemetery at Park Hill, Indian Territory (now Cherokee County, Oklahoma) for interment.\\"Cemeteries\\", Oklahoma Encyclopedia of History and Culture, Oklahoma Historical Society, Retrieved February 8, 2013 John Ross's grave in Park Hill, Oklahoma John Ross's great-great granddaughter, Mary G. Ross (August 9, 1908 ‚Äì April 29, 2008) was the first Native American female engineer. She helped propel the world into an era of space travel while becoming of one of the nation's most prominent women scientists of the space age. =Namesake and monuments= The City of Chattanooga named the Market Street Bridge in Ross's honor, and a bust of Ross stands on the north side of the Hamilton County Courthouse lawn. The city of Rossville, Georgia, located just south of the Tennessee state line, is named for Ross. It contains his former home, the John Ross House, where he lived from 1830‚Äì1838 until the state seized his lands near the Coosa River.

In 1998, Dino Ignacio, Wout J Reinders and Jasper Hulshoff Pol accepted the Webby Award and the People's Voice Award for Best Weird Website at the Palace of Fine Arts auditorium in San Francisco. The website featured manipulated images of the character consorting with notoriously nefarious figures, such as Adolf Hitler, Saddam Hussein, Kim Jong- il, Robert Mugabe, and Osama bin Laden, as well as being present at events, such as the JFK assassination,Image of Bert at the JFK assassination and Oklahoma City bombing, humorously offered as \\"proof\\" that Bert was no mere innocent children's television character. The \\"Evil Bert\\" phenomenon was picked up by other humorists, who created their own images, linking Bert to current and historical atrocities. In the summer of 1998, due to the website's immense cult popularity, it became too expensive for Ignacio to continue running. Instead of shutting the site down, he offered to allow anyone who was willing to mirror his original website the opportunity to host it. As a result dozens of mirrors appeared, increasing the website's popularity and visibility. Osama Bin Laden image The image in question (1998) The first mirror, maintained by Dennis Pozniak, continued in the same vein by adding new \\"evidence\\" of Bert's evilness (such as Bert's connection to the Ramsey Family and serial killer Jack the Ripper).Image of Bert with the Ramsey FamilyImage of Bert as Jack the Ripper In the end of 1998, Pozniak posted a contribution, submitted by humorist J Roen, photoshopped to depict the then relatively unknown international terrorist, Osama bin Laden,Image of Bert with Osama bin Laden posing with Bert. In October 2001, an undoctored Reuters news photograph was published showing a pro Osama bin Laden protest rally in Bangladesh.News photographs: One protester is seen holding a large collage style poster of bin Laden with a small image of Bert over his right shoulder ‚Äì the same image posted to the Bert mirror in 1998 ‚Äì which prompted much confusion and joking among Western audiences.For a detailed account of the use of the image, in South Asia as well as by Western news agencies, see . This also argues against the notion that inclusion of the Bert image is some kind of coded communication. It is more likely that the protester did not know who Bert is. Being unaware of Sesame Street, Dhaka printer Mostafa Kamal had copied the collage from the World Wide Web, leaving the image of Bert in his collage.Rosenzweig, Roy. \\"Scarcity or Abundance: Preserving the Past in a Digital Era\\". The American Historical Review 108.3 (2003): 735-762. After this photo was released on the news wires, the owners of Sesame Street, Sesame Workshop, raised the possibility of pursuing legal action against Ignacio. In response, he took down the \\"Bert is Evil\\" section of his website, also stating that he did not want to undermine the character in the eyes of children who watched Sesame Street. \\"I am doing this because I feel this has gotten too close to reality\\", he said. Since the original Bert/Osama picture had been posted to Dennis Pozniak's mirror, he too was bombarded by the international media seeking interviews.

In 1991, at the age of 7, she moved from Soviet Ukraine to the United States with her family. After being enrolled in acting classes as an after-school activity, she was soon discovered by an agent. She appeared in several television series and commercials, before landing her first significant role at age 14, playing Jackie Burkhart on the television series That '70s Show (1998‚Äì2006). Since 1999, she has voiced Meg Griffin on the animated series Family Guy. Kunis's breakout film role came in 2008, playing Rachel in the romantic comedy Forgetting Sarah Marshall. She gained further critical acclaim and accolades for her performance in the psychological thriller Black Swan (2010), for which she received the Marcello Mastroianni Award for Best Young Actor or Actress, and nominations for the SAG Award and the Golden Globe Award for Best Supporting Actress. Her other major films include the action films Max Payne (2008) and The Book of Eli (2010), the romantic comedy Friends with Benefits (2011), the fantasy film Oz the Great and Powerful (2013) as the Wicked Witch of the West, and the comedies Ted (2012), Bad Moms (2016) and its sequel, A Bad Moms Christmas (2017). Early life Milena Markovna Kunis was born on August 14, 1983, in Chernivtsi, Ukrainian SSR in the Soviet Union. Her mother, Elvira, is a physics teacher who runs a pharmacy, and her father, Mark Kunis, is a mechanical engineer who works as a cab driver. Kunis has an elder brother, Michael. Her mother tongue and the common language within her family is Russian. She stated in 2011 that her parents had \\"amazing jobs\\", and that she \\"was very lucky\\" and the family was \\"not poor\\"; they had decided to leave the USSR because they saw \\"no future\\" there for Mila and her brother. In 1991, when she was 7 years old, her family moved to Los Angeles, California, with $250. \\"That was all we were allowed to take with us. My parents had given up good jobs and degrees, which were not transferable. We arrived in New York on a Wednesday and by Friday morning my brother and I were at school in LA.\\" Kunis comes from a Jewish family and has cited antisemitism in the former Soviet Union as one of several reasons for her family's move to the United States., Obsessed With Film (January 20, 2011) She has stated that her parents \\"raised [her] Jewish as much as they could\\", although religion was suppressed in the Soviet Union. On her second day in Los Angeles, Kunis was enrolled at Rosewood Elementary School, not knowing a word of English. She later recalled: \\"I blocked out second grade completely. I have no recollection of it. I always talk to my mom and my grandma about it. It was because I cried every day. I didn't understand the culture. I didn't understand the people. I didn't understand the language. My first sentence of my essay to get into college was like, 'Imagine being blind and deaf at age seven.' And that's kind of what it felt like moving to the States.\\" In Los Angeles, she attended Hubert Howe Bancroft Middle School. She used an on-set tutor for most of her high school years while filming That '70s Show. She briefly attended Los Angeles Center for Enriched Studies (LACES), but when that school proved to be insufficiently flexible about her acting commitments, she transferred to Fairfax High School, from which she graduated in 2001. She briefly attended UCLA and Loyola Marymount University in Los Angeles. Career =1994‚Äì2000: Career beginnings and television work= At age nine, Kunis was enrolled by her father in acting classes after school at the Beverly Hills Studios, where she met Susan Curtis, who would become her manager. On her first audition she landed the role for a Barbie commercial. Shortly after, she did a commercial for the Lisa Frank product line. Her first television roles took place in 1994, first appearing on Days of Our Lives, and a few months later doing her first of two appearances on Baywatch. She had a minor role on 7th Heaven and supporting roles in Santa with Muscles, Honey, We Shrunk Ourselves, and the Angelina Jolie film Gia, as the young Gia Carangi. At the age of 10, Kunis auditioned for but failed to get the role of a Russian Jewish girl who moves to America in the film Make a Wish, Molly. Instead, she was cast in the secondary role of a Mexican girl. In 1998, Kunis was cast as Jackie Burkhart in the Fox sitcom That '70s Show. All who auditioned were required to be at least 18 years old; Kunis, who was 14 at the time, told the casting directors she would be 18 but did not say when. Though they eventually figured it out, the producers still thought Kunis was the best fit for the role. That '70s Show ran for eight seasons. She won two consecutive Young Star Awards as Best Young Actress in a Comedy TV Series in 1999 and 2000 for her performances. In 1999, Kunis replaced Lacey Chabert in the role of Meg Griffin on the animated sitcom Family Guy, created by Seth MacFarlane for Fox. Kunis won the role after auditions and a slight rewrite of the character, in part due to her performance on That '70s Show. When Kunis auditioned for the role, she was called back by MacFarlane, who instructed her to speak slower. He then told her to come back another time and enunciate more. Once she claimed that she had it under control, MacFarlane hired her. MacFarlane added: \\"What Mila Kunis brought to it was in a lot of ways, I thought, almost more right for the character. I say that Lacey did a phenomenal job, but there was something about Mila ‚Äì something very natural about Mila. She was 15 when she started, so you were listening to a 15-year-old. Oftentimes with animation they'll have adult actors doing the voices of teenagers and they always sound like Saturday morning voices. They sound oftentimes very forced. She had a very natural quality to Meg that really made what we did with that character kind of really work.\\" Kunis was nominated for an Annie Award in the category of Voice Acting in an Animated Television Production in 2007. She also voiced Meg in Family Guy Video Game!, released in 2006. Kunis described her character as \\"the scapegoat.\\" =2001‚Äì2008: Transition to film= In 2001, she appeared in Get Over It opposite Kirsten Dunst. She followed that up in 2002, by starring in the straight-to-DVD horror film American Psycho 2 alongside William Shatner, a sequel to the 2000 film American Psycho. American Psycho 2 was poorly reviewed by critics, and later, Kunis herself expressed embarrassment over the film. In 2004, Kunis starred in the film adaptation Tony n' Tina's Wedding. Although the film was shot in 2004, it did not have a theatrical release until 2007. Most critics did not like the film, which mustered a 25% approval from Rotten Tomatoes. DVD talk concluded that \\"fans would be much better off pretending the movie never happened in the first place\\". In 2005, Kunis co-starred with Jon Heder in Moving McAllister, which was not released theatrically until 2007. The film received generally poor reviews and had a limited two-week run in theaters. She followed up with After Sex starring alongside Zoe Saldana, who had also appeared in Get Over It. In October 2006, she began filming Boot Camp (originally titled Straight Edge). The film was not released in theaters in the United States, but was released on DVD on August 25, 2009. Kunis at the Max Payne premiere in 2008 Kunis starred as Rachel Jansen in the 2008 comedy film, Forgetting Sarah Marshall, co-produced by Judd Apatow. The role, which she won after unsuccessfully auditioning for Knocked Up, entailed improvization on her part. The film garnered positive reviews, and was a commercial success, grossing $105 million worldwide. Kunis's performance was well-received; Joe Morgenstern of The Wall Street Journal praised her \\"fresh beauty and focused energy\\", while James Berardinelli wrote that she is \\"adept with her performance and understands the concept of comic timing\\". She was nominated for a Teen Choice Award. In an interview, Kunis credited Apatow with helping her to expand her career from That '70s Show. Also in 2008, Kunis portrayed Mona Sax, an assassin, alongside Mark Wahlberg in the action film Max Payne, based on the video game of the same name. Kunis underwent training in guns, boxing, and martial arts for her role. Max Payne was relatively successful at the box office, grossing $85 million worldwide but was poorly reviewed by critics, with several reviewers calling Kunis miscast. Travis Estvold of Boise Weekly wrote that she was \\"horribly miscast as some sort of undersized, warble-voiced crime boss\\". Director John Moore defended his choice of Kunis saying, \\"Mila just bowled us over..... She wasn't an obvious choice, but she just wears Mona so well. We needed someone who would not be just a fop or foil to Max; we needed somebody who had to be that character and convey her own agenda. I think Mila just knocked it out of the park.\\" She was nominated for another Teen Choice Award for her role in the film. =2009‚Äì2012: Film breakthrough and acclaim= In 2009, she appeared in the comedy film Extract with Ben Affleck and Jason Bateman. The film received mostly positive reviews, and grossed $10.8 million at the box office. Roger Ebert, while critical of the film itself, wrote that Kunis \\"brings her role to within shouting distance of credibility.\\" Director Mike Judge commented that part of what was surprising to learn about Kunis was her ability to make references to the cult animation film Rejected. Judge said: \\"As beautiful as Mila is, you could believe that maybe she would cross paths with you in the real world.\\" After seeing Kunis perform in Forgetting Sarah Marshall, Judge wanted to cast her in the role of Cindy in Extract: \\"I just thought, 'Wow, this girl's perfect.' And she really wanted to do it, which was fantastic.\\" Kunis herself stated that \\"I'm a huge fan of Mike Judge's from Office Space, so I was, like, 'Okay, this is a very easy decision.' I told them I would do anything needed to be in this production‚Äì like craft service, or, say, acting.\\" thumb In 2010, she starred alongside Denzel Washington in the action film The Book of Eli. Although the film received mixed reviews, it performed well at the box office, grossing over $157 million worldwide. Film critic Richard Roeper praised Kunis's performance, calling it a \\"particularly strong piece of work\\". Several other reviews were equally positive, including that of Pete Hammond of Boxoffice magazine, who wrote that she's \\"ideally cast in the key female role\\" Even reviewers who didn't necessarily like the film complimented her performance, such as James Berardinelli, who wrote that \\"the demands of the role prove to be within her range, which is perhaps surprising considering she has been thus far pigeonholed into more lightweight parts\\", and Colin Covert of the Star Tribune, who wrote that she \\"generated a spark and brought a degree of determination to her character, developing an independent female character who's not always in need of rescuing.\\" Other critics, such as Claudia Puig of USA Today felt she was miscast, noting that \\"she looked as if she dropped in from a Ray-Ban commercial\\". Kunis received another Teen Choice Award nomination for her performance. Kunis was also cast in a minor role in the 2010 comedy film Date Night, starring Tina Fey and Steve Carell. She garnered several positive reviews for her performance. Michael Phillips of the Chicago Tribune concluded her performance with James Franco helped save the film and gave it \\"a shot in the arm.\\" Kunis was nominated for multiple awards, including her first Golden Globe, for the 2010 film Black Swan. She played a rival ballet dancer to the main character, played by Natalie Portman. Director Darren Aronofsky cast Kunis in the film based on her performance in Forgetting Sarah Marshall, and on the recommendation of co-star and close friend Natalie Portman. She underwent a training regimen that included cardiovascular exercise, a 1,200-calorie a day diet (she lost 20 pounds that she regained after filming ended), and ballet classes for four hours a day, seven days a week. During the demanding production, she suffered injuries including a torn ligament and a dislocated shoulder. Black Swan received widespread acclaim from critics and was nominated for five Academy Awards, including Best Picture. The film grossed over $106.9 million in the United States and Canada while grossing over $329 million worldwide. Reviews of Kunis's performance were positive, with Kirk Honeycutt of The Hollywood Reporter stating, \\"Kunis makes a perfect alternate to Portman, equally as lithe and dark but a smirk of self-assurance in place of Portman's wide-eyed fearfulness.\\" Guy Lodge of In Contention also praised Kunis, saying, \\"it's the cool, throaty-voiced Kunis who is the surprise package here, intelligently watching and reflecting her co-star in such a manner that we're as uncertain as Nina of her ingenuousness.\\" Kunis's performance won her the Marcello Mastroianni Award for Best Young Actor or Actress at the 67th Venice International Film Festival, and earned her Golden Globe Award and Screen Actors Guild Award nominations for Best Supporting Actress. At the 37th annual Saturn Awards, she was also honored with the Best Supporting Actress award for her performance. Kunis was cast alongside Justin Timberlake in the 2011 romantic comedy Friends with Benefits. Director Will Gluck stated that he wrote the story with Kunis and Timberlake in mind. Friends with Benefits achieved success at the box office, grossing over $149 million worldwide, and received mostly positive reviews with critics praising the chemistry between Kunis and Timberlake. Manohla Dargis of The New York Times wrote that \\"Ms. Kunis is fast proving that she's a gift that keeps giving to mainstream romantic comedy\\" and \\"her energy is so invigorating and expansive and her presence so vibrant that she fills the screen\\". In 2012, Kunis co-starred with Mark Wahlberg in Ted, her most commercially successful film to date. The film was directed and co-written by Family Guy creator Seth MacFarlane. Kunis played the girlfriend of Wahlberg's character. When MacFarlane first conceived the project, he considered Kunis too young for the role. However, the film remained in development for several years and when it was finally ready to begin production, he ended up casting her. Ted has received generally positive reviews from critics and was a commercial success, grossing $549 million worldwide. Drew McWeeny of HitFix wrote that Kunis \\"brings some lovely subtle grace notes to a role that easily could have just been 'the pushy girlfriend. =2013‚Äìpresent: continued work= In 2013, Kunis played Theodora, the youngest of three witches, opposite James Franco, in the Walt Disney Pictures' prequel, Oz the Great and Powerful. She dedicated her performance in the film to Margaret Hamilton, the original Wicked Witch of the West in the 1939 film. The film, and Kunis's performance, received mixed reviews from critics. Kim Newman of Empire Magazine wrote that Kunis \\"walks away with the honours as the wavering witch Theodora, whose heartbreak brings another, less-expected depth to this 3D spectacle\\". In contrast, Todd McCarthy of The Hollywood Reporter found Kunis's performance to be uncertain as her character seemed to be in a state of limbo. Oz the Great and Powerful was a commercial success, grossing over $493 million worldwide. Also in 2013, Kunis co-starred in the crime thriller Blood Ties with Clive Owen, Billy Crudup, and Marion Cotillard. The film premiered at the 2013 Cannes Film Festival and had a limited release in the United States in 2014. Blood Ties received mixed reviews.

The Paul Haggis-directed film Third Person co-starring with Liam Neeson, Olivia Wilde and James Franco premiered at the 2013 Toronto Film Festival and had a limited release in 2014, but also received mostly negative reviews. Kunis' performance was praised by some critics; Deborah Young of The Hollywood Reporter wrote that her role gives her \\"enormous room to express her talent\\" and she \\"gives her story a shot of raw intensity\\". In October 2014, it was announced Kunis, along with her partners, had launched a new production company called Orchard Farm Productions. The company has a first-look deal with ABC Studios, where the company is based. Under the agreement, the team will develop and produce TV projects for broadcast and cable. In 2015, Kunis co-starred with Channing Tatum in the science fiction film Jupiter Ascending, directed by the Wachowskis. While the film grossed over $183.9 million on a $176 million budget, it received mostly negative reviews, with a consensus that the production was \\"narratively befuddled\\" and a \\"visually thrilling misfire\\". Kunis co-starred with Kristen Bell and Christina Applegate in the comedy Bad Moms, which was released July 29, 2016. It received mixed reviews from critics, who praised the cast and humor, though did not feel it could \\"take full advantage of its assets\\". Chris Nashawaty from Entertainment Weekly wrote that \\"Kunis manages to be both sympathetic and funny, and she has crack comedic timing\\". The film went on to earn more than $183.9 million with a budget of $20 million.

The video was a parody of the MTV show The Hills and was a huge success for the website, with 2.4 million views over the next ten years. Shawn Levy, director of Date Night, stated that part of what made him decide to cast Kunis with James Franco in the film was the chemistry he felt they had in the Funny or Die video. In December 2008, Kunis was featured in Gap's \\"Shine Your Own Star\\" Christmas campaign. In 2010, she was featured in the \\"Women We Love\\" segment in Esquire with an accompanied video.

The event celebrated the Marine Corps' 236th anniversary. Kunis is a supporter of the Democratic Party and Barack Obama. In a 2012 interview, she criticized the Republican Party, saying: \\"The way that Republicans attack women is so offensive to me. And the way they talk about religion is offensive. I may not be a practicing Jew, but why we gotta talk about Jesus all the time?\\" =Health= In January 2011, she revealed her struggle with chronic iritis that had caused temporary blindness in one eye. Some months earlier she had had surgery that corrected the problem. Kunis also has heterochromia iridum, a condition in which the irises are different colors.

It's already more high profile than I want it to be.\\" When asked if it was difficult to stay out of the tabloids and press, Kunis responded: \\"I keep my personal life as personal as I physically, mentally, possibly can.\\" Asked if that is difficult she said, \\"I don't care. I will go to my grave trying. It is hard, but I'll end up going to a bar that's a hole in the wall. I won't go to the 'it's-happening' place.\\" On January 3, 2011, Kunis' publicist confirmed reports that Kunis and Culkin had ended their relationship, saying, \\"The split was amicable, and they remain close friends.\\" Kunis began dating her former That '70s Show co-star Ashton Kutcher in April 2012.

It begins at the border with Ethiopia, where the Dawa and Ganale Dorya rivers meet, and flows directly south to the Somali Sea, where it empties at the Goobweyn juncture. The Somali regional state of Jubaland, formerly called Trans-Juba, is named after the river. History The Jubba river near Jamaame =Ajuran Empire= The Jubba River has a rich history of a once-booming sophisticated civilization and trade network conducted by the powerful Somalis that held sway over the Jubba river. During the Middle Ages Jubba river was under the Ajuran Empire of the Horn of Africa which utilized the Jubba River for its plantations and was the only hydraulic empire in Africa. A hydraulic empire that rose in the 13th century AD, Ajuran monopolized the water resources of the Jubba River and Shebelle. Through hydraulic engineering, it also constructed many of the limestone wells and cisterns of the state that are still operative and in use today. Its rulers developed new systems for agriculture and taxation, which continued to be used in parts of the Horn of Africa as late as the 19th century. Through their control of the region's wells, the Garen rulers effectively held a monopoly over their nomadic subjects as they were the only hydraulic empire in Africa during their reign. Large wells made out of limestone were constructed throughout the state, which attracted Somali nomads with their livestock. The centralized regulations of the wells made it easier for the nomads to settle disputes by taking their queries to government officials who would act as mediators. Long distance caravan trade, a long-time practice in the Horn of Africa, continued unchanged in Ajuran times. Today, numerous ruined and abandoned towns throughout the interior of Somalia and the Horn of Africa are evidence of a once-booming inland trade network dating from the medieval period. With the centralized supervision of the Ajuran, farms in Afgooye, Bardhere and other areas in the Jubba and Shebelle valleys increased their productivity. A system of irrigation ditches known locally as Kelliyo fed directly from the Shebelle River and Jubba River into the plantations where sorghum, maize, beans, grain and cotton were grown during the gu (Spring in Somali) and xagaa (Summer in Somali) seasons of the Somali calendar. This irrigation system was supported by numerous dikes and dams. To determine the average size of a farm, a land measurement system was also invented with moos, taraab and guldeed being the terms used. The urban centers of Mogadishu, Merca, Barawa, Kismayo and Hobyo and other respective ports became profitable trade outlets for commodities originating from the interior of the State. The Somali farming communities of the hinterland from Jubba and Shebelle valleys brought their crops to the Somali coastal cities, where they were sold to local merchants who maintained a lucrative foreign commerce with ships sailing to and coming from Arabia, Persia, India, Venice, Egypt, Portugal, and as far away as Java and China.Journal of African History pg.50 by John Donnelly Fage and Roland Anthony Oliver =Modern Period= Over two centuries passed until Baron Karl Klaus von der Decken ascended the lower reaches of the river on the small steamship Welf in 1863. He wrecked the steamship in the rapids above Bardhere, where the party was attacked by local Somalis, ending in the deaths of the Baron and three others in his party. The first European to explore widely and complete the course of the river was the Italian explorer Vittorio Bottego attended by Commander F.G. Dundas British Navy. Bottego and his expedition sailed 400 miles of the river in 1891. During his exploration Vittorio Bottego changed the name of the main affluent of Jubba -the Ganale river- in Ganale Doria after the famous Italian naturalist Giacomo Doria. 1892; Il Giuba esplorato, 1895F.G. Dundas, \\"Expedition up the Jub River through Somali-Land, East Africa\\", Geographical Journal, 1 (March 1893), pp. 209-222 Overview alt= The Jubba basin region is primarily savanna, and is, ecologically speaking, the richest part of the country due to its fertile farmland. Native wild life include giraffes, cheetahs, lions, leopards, hyenas, buffalos, hippopotamus, crocodiles, oryx, gazelles, camels, ostriches, jackals and wild donkeys. The Jubba River gives its name to the Somali administrative regions of Upper Juba( Gedo, Bay, Bakool) Middle Juba and Lower Juba, as well as to the larger historical region of Jubaland. Major cities which the Jubba River passes by include Dolow, Luuq, Burdhubo, Beled'hawo, Bardhere, Buale, and Goobweyn near Kismaayo.

He began performing in the late 1950s as a teen idol, switching to country music in the early 1960s. Biography Hamilton was born in Winston-Salem, North Carolina, on July 19, 1937. While a 19-year-old student at the University of North Carolina at Chapel Hill, Hamilton recorded \\"A Rose and a Baby Ruth\\" for a Chapel Hill record label, Colonial Records. The song, written by John D. Loudermilk, climbed to No. 6 on the United States Billboard Hot 100 chart. By 1960, \\"A Rose and a Baby Ruth\\" had attained gold record status for ABC-Paramount (which had acquired the song from Colonial). The self-penned B-side of the record, \\"If You Don't Know\\", revealed Hamilton's ambitions to be a rockabilly-country singer. After a string of pop hits, Hamilton joined the Rockabilly Tour playing with Eddie Cochran, Buddy Holly, Everly Brothers, Little Richard and several others throughout the country. George was then invited to Washington, DC to become a member of the cast of the Jimmy Dean Show where he performed regularly with Patsy Cline and Jimmy Dean. He also appeared on Dick Clark‚Äôs ‚ÄúAmerican Bandstand‚Äù, Arthur Godfrey ‚ÄúTalent Scouts‚Äù, and the Perry Como Show. Hamilton also went on to host his own National Television Musical/Variety shows on ABC and CBS in the late 1950s. In late 1959, Hamilton moved his family to Nashville, Tennessee to further his work as a country musician.\\"A Rose and a Baby Ruth\\" was issued in UK as \\"A Rose and a Candy Bar\\"as the Baby Ruth bar was unknown there.George Hamilton IV and Friends Biography Page On February 8, 1960, Hamilton officially became a member of the Grand Ole Opry. Later that same year, he began recording for RCA Records, having been signed by Chet Atkins. Hamilton's breakthrough hit was the 1961 song \\"Before this Day Ends\\". His biggest hit came two years later with \\"Abilene\\", another song penned by Loudermilk and Bob Gibson. The song spent four weeks at No. 1 on Billboard's country singles chart and reached the Top 20 of the Hot 100. The success of \\"Abilene\\" was followed with the song \\"Fort Worth, Dallas or Houston\\" (a Top 5 hit in late 1964). In 1962, Hamilton started the first Music City USA & Homes of the Stars Bus Tour in Nashville. By the mid-1960s, Hamilton's music began showing a decidedly folk influence. This was especially evident with 1966's \\"Steel Rail Blues\\" and \\"Early Morning Rain\\" (both by Gordon Lightfoot), and 1967's \\"Urge for Going\\" by Joni Mitchell. Another 1967 hit was \\"Break My Mind\\" (by John D. Loudermilk). One more Hamilton song of this genre was a moderate hit in 1969‚Äîthe Ray Griff-penned \\"Canadian Pacific\\". His last Top 5 single came in 1970, with \\"She's a Little Bit Country\\". After his American chart success declined in the early 1970s, Hamilton began touring the world, across the Soviet Union, Poland, Australia, the Middle East, and East Asia. These widely acclaimed international performances earned Hamilton the nickname The International Ambassador of Country Music. He also hosted several successful television programs in the UK and Canada during the 1970s, and in the 1990s he played himself in the West End musical Patsy, based on the life of Patsy Cline. In the 1980s Hamilton appeared with Billy Graham on Ministry Tours throughout the US, Canada, and including the UK tour 'Mission England'.

A single from the album, \\"Little Mountain Church House\\", won nominee recognition in the \\"Best Bluegrass Recorded Song\\" category the following year. Until the very late years of his life, Hamilton was a regular at the Grand Ole Opry in Nashville and in country shows throughout the U.S. and the UK. Hamilton celebrated his 50th year as a Grand Ole Opry member in 2010. He mainly concentrated on gospel tours both at home and abroad. In 2007 he collaborated with Live Issue, a group from Northern Ireland, to record a live album based on the life of Joseph Scriven, who wrote the hymn \\"What a Friend We Have in Jesus\\". The two also toured together again in 2009. In 2008, Hamilton released a parody of his classic hit \\"Abilene\\" in the height of the soaring U.S. gas prices called \\"Gasoline\\". The acoustic single featured \\"The Oil Spots\\" (a.k.a. the Moody Brothers & George Hamilton V) and became a hit with audiences during Hamilton's Opry appearances.

A Vietnam War veteran who has worked as a lawyer, he is now a writer in the military science fiction genre. Biography Drake graduated Phi Beta Kappa from the University of Iowa, majoring in history (with honors) and Latin. His studies at Duke University School of Law were interrupted for two years when he was drafted into the U.S. Army, where he served as an enlisted interrogator with the 11th Armored Cavalry (The Black Horse Regiment) in Vietnam and Cambodia. With Karl Edward Wagner and Jim Groce, he was one of the initiators of Carcosa, a small press company. He now lives in Pittsboro, North Carolina. Works His best-known solo work is the Hammer's Slammers series of military science fiction. His newer Republic of Cinnabar Navy series are space operas inspired by the Aubrey‚ÄìMaturin novels. During 1997, Drake began his largest fantasy series, Lord of the Isles, using elements of Sumerian religion and medieval technology. During 2007, Drake finished the series with its ninth volume. Drake has co-authored novels with authors such as Karl Edward Wagner, S.M. Stirling, and Eric Flint. Typically Drake provides plot outlines (5,000-15,000 words) and the co-author does \\"the real work of developing the outline into a novel\\".Novel Plot Outlines, David Drake, May 26, 2010 He does not \\"consider [his] involvement to be that of a real co-author.\\" Drake also contributed to the Heroes in Hell series. Drake's plots often use history, literature, and mythology. Starting with Northworld in 1990,Northworld, Vengeance, and Justice, David Drake, May 15, 2000 he has generally explained the background of each book in an afterword or preface. Additionally, Drake's plots frequently involve a contest of political systems.

(G&SR;) under e-gold Ltd. that allowed users to open an account on their web site denominated in grams of gold (or other precious metals) and the ability to make instant transfers of value (\\"spends\\") to other e-gold accounts. The e-gold system was launched online in 1996 and had grown to five million accounts by 2009, when transfers were suspended due to legal issues. At its peak in 2006, e-gold was processing more than US$2 billion worth of spends per year, on a monetary base of only 71 million worth of gold (~3.5 metric tonnes), indicating a high monetary turnover (velocity) of about 28 times per year (for comparison, annual velocity of is about 6 for M1 and less than 1.6 for M2 ). e-gold Ltd. was incorporated in Nevis, Saint Kitts and Nevis with operations conducted out of Florida, USA. Beginnings E-gold was founded by oncologist Douglas Jackson and attorney Barry Downey in 1996. The pair originally backed the services accounts with gold coins stored in a bank safe deposit box in Melbourne, Florida. By 1998, G&SR; (the system operator) was an Affiliate Member of NACHA and a Full Member of NACHA's The Internet Council. The company was launched two years before PayPal but did not manifest exponential growth until 2000. By 2004, there were over a million accounts. It was the first successful digital currency system to gain a widespread user base and merchant adoption, noted July 13, 1999 in the Financial Times as ‚Äúthe only electronic currency that has achieved critical mass on the web‚Äù. It was also the first non-credit-card payment service provider to offer an application programming interface (API) enabling other services and e-commerce transactions to be built on top of it. After initial demonstration of an e-gold Spend via Palm Pilot in February 1999, e-gold introduced support for wireless mobile payments. E-gold was used by both individuals and merchants for services including metals trading, online merchants, online auctions, online casinos, political organizations, and non-profit organizations. From 1996 through 1999, currency exchange services referred to as ‚ÄúInExchange‚Äù and ‚ÄúOutExchange‚Äù were directly supported on the e-gold platform. This arrangement exposed the system‚Äôs operator, G&SR;, to the financial risks attendant to provision of exchange services. It also tended to inhibit third parties from offering exchange services on an independent competitive basis. In 2000, the system was re-structured to effect a separation of currency exchange activities from the core functions of e-metal issuance and settlement of transfers. G&SR; devolved ownership and responsibility for these core functions to e-gold Ltd., a newly formed offshore company organized for that express purpose. G&SR; itself, now a customer of e-gold, continued to offer exchange services under the newly created OmniPay brand. Beginning spring 2000, there was a proliferation of independent exchange services marking the first emergence of an industry providing exchange between conventional national currencies and a privately issued brand of money. By 2001, several dozen companies and individuals from around the world were offering third party exchange services between national currencies and e-gold, further extending e-gold's international user base. E-gold, which allowed transactions as small as one ten-thousandth of a gram of gold, was also the world's only successful micropayment system. The company's payment statistics were published live and showed hundreds of thousands of micro-transactions were being made daily by computer programs using the API. From its inception in 1996, e-gold pioneered the decoupling of the numeraire for specifying a payment (Spend) instruction from the native unit of account of the settlement currency. For example, while AUG¬Æ (the trademarked designation for e-gold) was denominated in grams and decimal fractions (or in troy ounces since, as weight units, both are related by fixed arithmetic ratio), a Spend Instruction might be specified as \\"Pay [recipient account] 10 USD worth of e-gold\\". Calculation of the actual quantity to convey was made using a table of reference exchange rates maintained by the company, reflecting current actual exchange rates published by exchange providers. By the early 2000s (decade), the capability of immediate settlement, as implemented by e-gold, was recognized as key to the emergence of systems for peer-to-peer transfers of digital rights such as ‚Äúsmart contracts‚Äù. =Governance= E-gold was unique at the time in that they created the \\"e-gold Special Purpose Trust\\" which held title to the physical bullion on behalf of the users. They also created a real-time statistical reports page that showed the total holdings of each metal in the trust account, list of gold bars with serial numbers, the total number of accounts, as well as the total number and value of transactions in the previous 24 hours. This transparency enabled many observations to be made about how e-gold was being used. Criminal abuse E-gold's early success may have contributed to its demise. E-gold's store of value and large user base made it an early target of financial malware and phishing scams by increasingly organized criminal syndicates. The first known phishing attack against a financial institution was made against members of the e-gold mailing list in June 2001. The technique was refined with attacks against the digital gold systems like e-gold and later used to attack other financial institutions starting in 2003. =Hackers= Failing to prospectively verify the identity of account holders, e-gold began to suffer from an increasing rate of criminal activity mainly perpetrated by Russian and Ukrainian hackers against its users. In addition to phishing, the attackers made widespread use of flaws in the Microsoft Windows operating systems and Internet Explorer web browser to collect account details from millions of computers to compromise e-gold accounts. Jackson's theory was that e-gold is a book entry system with account histories, making it simple to conduct an investigation to track down and identify users who had engaged in illicit activity after the fact. While the public perception was that e-gold accounts were anonymous, e-gold accounts were pseudonymous, allowing the creator of the account to use any name or label he wished to use. However, account and transaction records‚Äîeven failed log-in attempts‚Äîwere permanently recorded, enabling linkage of seemingly unrelated accounts secretly under unified control. The data mining this enabled, combined with inputs from independent exchange services, enabled law enforcement to identify numerous criminal users of the service. =Fraud= Various fraud artists from Western countries were also able to take advantage of the e-gold system as a means of funding their schemes, enabling for the first time in history, international Ponzi schemes. Perpetrators of auction fraud on eBay would sell fake or non- existent items on the site. These criminal syndicates preferred their victims to pay in e-gold because it was the fastest and easiest way for them to move the funds overseas. The increase of online crime linked to e-gold led to complaints to government authorities by defrauded account holders, who often did not understand the difference between e-gold and the fraudulent person or company that encouraged them to open an e-gold account and wire money to fund it. =Systemic problems= As an online transactions system with exchange agents worldwide, e-gold enabled criminals and hackers in Romania to move money quickly and easily from victims in America back to the country from which the attacks were originating. Several of the cyber crime gangs that plagued and used e-gold were based in R√¢mnicu V√¢lcea, Romania. E-gold was unknowingly part of a larger systemic problem with the banking system. The banking and credit system in the United States were not designed for a digital environment, and were therefore fundamentally insecure and highly vulnerable to identity theft and check fraud, as well as trust based attacks such as phishing. The willingness of credit card companies to allow people to apply for a card without being identified in person enabled rapid growth of identity theft. (Ironically, not verifying the identities of account holders would be one of the main criticisms raised against e-gold.) Cybercrime There were early reports where e-gold had actively helped to catch and collar cyber criminals, such as the one who stole Cisco Systems' firewall code and offered it for sale to be paid in e-gold. In June 2007, Jackson claimed to have \\"aided 300 investigations and reported 3,000 suspected child pornography buyers to the National Center for Missing and Exploited Children\\". Goldmoney, and then federal law enforcement agencies began to characterize e-gold as the payment system of choice for criminals, terrorists and child pornographers. Criminal prosecution =Changing definition of a money transmitter= The USA Patriot Act, passed in the wake of the September 11 attacks more than five years after e-gold had been launched, made it a federal crime to operate a money transmitter business without a state money transmitter license in any state that required such a license. At the time a money transmitter was in most states defined as a business that cashed checks or accepted cash remittances to send from one person to another person across international borders, such as Western Union or MoneyGram. For example, prior to 2010, California regulated money transmitters under the \\"Transmission of Money Abroad Law\\". One of e-gold's competitors, the e-Bullion company, applied for a money transmitter license from the State of California in 2002, but was informed by the State of California that their business which dealt in gold accounts did not fall under the state's definition of a money transmitter. In 2005, G&SR; requested that the IRS SB/SE Division conduct a BSA (Bank Secrecy Act) Compliance examination in order to clarify what regulations, if any, e-gold fell under. The United States Treasury issued a report on January 11, 2006 titled U.S. Money Laundering Threat AssessmentU.S. Treasury Report on January 11, 2006, U.S. Money Laundering Threat Assessment, U.S. Treasury which G&SR believed was evidence favorable to its legal case as explained in its January 20, 2006 Letter, apparently confirming that e-gold accounts were excluded from the definition of \\"currency\\" under the United States Congress and Code of Federal Regulations definitions. However, in its actions from 2006-2008, the U.S. Treasury Department in conjunction with the United States Department of Justice stretched the definition of money transmitter in the USA Patriot Act to include any system that allows transfer of any kind of value from one person to another, not merely national currency or cash. Using this new interpretation they then proceeded to prosecute the USA-based gold systems, e-gold (and later e-Bullion) under the USA Patriot Act for not having money transmitter licenses, even though these companies had previously been cooperating with regulatory authorities and told they did not fall under the definition of money transmitter. The charge of not having a money transmitter license was eventually dropped against e-bullion. Several years later FINCEN further expanded this definition to apply to foreign companies allowing US persons to open accounts, which forced the Jersey based Goldmoney.com to suspend the ability to transfer value from one holder to another in December 2011. A November 2013 article in Financial Times noted that \\"For several years, Mr Jackson had hoped to resurrect e-gold himself, but it became clear he would not be able to obtain the money transmitter licenses required in most US states.\\"Stephen Foley, November 28, 2013 E-gold founder backs new Bitcoin rival, Financial Times =Allegations against e-gold= Banks suffer from the same problems with criminal activity, phishing, ponzi schemes and money laundering on a much larger scale, and some of the biggest banks have even knowingly participated in money laundering. e-gold's status as a controversial alternative currency system made it an attractive target. While e-gold had begun implementing stronger controls against abuse by users of the system by 2005, and was actively combating the use of its system for child pornography as a founding member of the Financial Coalition Against Child Pornography, the Justice Department indicted the e-gold directors on four counts of violating money laundering regulations and knowingly allowing a transaction to purchase child pornography. The government action against e-gold was a case of first impression. As noted by the prosecutor, ‚ÄúDigital currencies are on the forefront of international fund transfers. E-gold is the most prominent digital currency out there. It has the attention of the entire digital currency world. That world is a bit of a wild west right now. People are looking for what are the rules and what are the consequences.‚Äù =Resolution= The case against e-gold was brought under Title 18 USC section 1960 in UNITED STATES OF AMERICA v. E-GOLD, LTD, District of Columbia court. e-gold filed a motion to dismiss the case on the grounds that they did not fit the definition of a money transmitter. The court ruled against e-gold, stating that \\"a business can clearly engage in money transmitting without limiting its transactions to cash or currency and would commit a crime if it did so without being licensed.\\" This ruling enshrined in case law the Treasury Department's expansion of the definition of a money transmitter to include any system by which stored value of any kind may be transferred from one person to another, even if the stored value is neither cash, nor national currency. After vigorously contesting the charges for a year, in July 2008 the company and its three directors entered into a plea agreement. Dr. Jackson pleaded guilty to \\"operation of an unlicensed money transmitting business\\" and \\"conspiracy to engage in money laundering\\". The agreement detailed actions required to bring the companies into compliance with laws and regulations governing operation of a Money Transmitting Business. Concurrently, the companies agreed to a consent order of forfeiture, dropping their action to recover funds previously seized by the government. Sentencing was scheduled to occur 120 days following entry of the Plea Agreements in order to afford a 90-day interval to implement compliance requirements. A status report detailing progress with regard to mandated compliance measures was filed November 8, 2008. In November 2008, Gold & Silver Reserve CEO Douglas Jackson was sentenced to 300 hours of community service, a $200 fine, and three years of supervision, including six months of electronically monitored home detention. He had faced a maximum sentence of 20 years in prison and a $500,000 fine. Commenting on her substantial deviation from Federal Sentencing Guidelines (in the direction of leniency), Judge Rosemary Collyer, having already noted ‚Äúno doubt that Dr. Jackson has respect for the law‚Äù and that ‚Äúthe intent was not there to engage in illegal conduct‚Äù, determined: ‚Äúthere is no reason to shut down e-Gold and G&SR;, and every reason to have them come into legal compliance‚Äù. Jackson's lawyer claimed Jackson was spared the heavier fine because he was deeply in debt - the judge said \\"Dr. Jackson has suffered, will continue to suffer, and may never be successful with e-Gold\\". Reid Jackson, Douglas Jackson's brother, and e-Gold director Barry Downey were each sentenced to three years of probation and 300 hours of community service, and ordered to pay a $2,500 fine and a $100 assessment. =Suspension of service and e-gold Value Access Plan (VAP)= The 2007 e-gold indictment was accompanied by seizures (and forced redemption) of the e-gold balances of multiple exchange providers, resulting in an almost overnight decline in the amount of e-gold in circulation (and gold reserves) from 3.5 to 2.6 metric tonnes. [No exchanger except G&SR; was charged with any crime and the seized value was subsequently returned to them.] Additionally, the government filed a Post-Indictment Restraining Order (PIRO) which prohibited redemption of e-gold for gold bullion without the approval of the prosecutor. The primary purpose of the PIRO was to prevent dispersion of assets (the gold reserves) which the government had been unable to seize due to the custodial arrangements whereby the e-gold Bullion Reserve Special Purpose Trust held title to the gold. The combination of adverse publicity and disrupted exchange markets led to a precipitous decline in e-gold usage and demand. Whereas under normal circumstances a decrease in demand would have resulted in a decrease in circulation (without impacting exchange rates), this combination led to e-gold Users being unable to exchange their e-gold for conventional money and discouraged any potential recipient from accepting payment in e-gold. In 2008, the Plea Agreement detailed requirements for e-gold to resume operation as a regulated financial institution. While e-gold had already complied with the majority of requirements by the time of sentencing, it was discovered that the guilty Plea itself effectively precluded the companies (or any company controlled by the e-gold directors) from being licenseable in any US state. In accordance with the Plea, e-gold suspended all remaining Spend activity, in effect locking up all e-gold account balances. The challenge was then how to restore customer access to the value in their e-gold accounts. Lacking licenses as a money transmitting business, any plan to liquidate the system and distribute value to customers would risk being construed as an additional violation of operating without required licenses. In 2009, the e-gold directors approached the US government with a proposal whereby the government might serve as middleman for disbursing the value due to e-gold customers. Following a year of negotiation, the e-gold VAP was approved calling for monetization of reserves and a claims mechanism, under the authority and oversight of Judge Hollander. The VAP protocol entailed the companies consenting to a voluntary seizure action of the aggregate e-gold. The companies were then responsible for ‚Äúmonetizing‚Äù the value, that is, redeeming the e-gold, liquidating the bullion released from reserves and turning over the proceeds to the Secret Service. Due to a fortuitous drop in USD value relative to e-gold, the net realized monetization rate for VAP was $1583 per troy ounce, over twice the maximum e-gold exchange rate during the interval Spend activity was curtailed and then suspended c. 2007-2009. Altogether, G&SR; turned over more than $92.8 million to the Secret Service in 2012. Some of the e-metal in e-Gold accounts was criminally derived, but much of the e-metal was owned by innocent account holders. The court ordered Rust Consulting, a private company in Maryland, to process refunds to account holders following validation of their identity by e-gold. The balance of unclaimed funds will be forfeited to the US government. A three-month window was set from June 3, 2013 to October 1, 2013 for e-gold account holders to submit a claim on their funds, then extended to December 31, 2013. =Aftermath= After the e-gold and e-Bullion cases, California (2010) and several other states amended their regulations to follow the federal precedent to define all digital value transfer systems as money transmitters. However, California's 2010 law is worded as to define a range of Internet startup companies, such as the room booking service Airbnb, as \\"money transmitters\\". E-gold was an early pioneer of Internet payments. The company was the first successful online payment system which pioneered many of the systems and techniques of e-commerce, including making payments over an SSL encrypted connection, and offering an API to enable other websites to build services using e-gold's transaction system. Though e-gold was ultimately shut down by the US government, the federal judge on the case ruled that the founders of e-gold \\"had no intent to commit illegal activity.\\" After the resolution of the criminal case, the directors of e-gold Ltd vowed to continue operations following the new Federal know your customer guidelines. E-gold's failure was ultimately due to their inability to provide a system of reliable user identification and the failure to provide a workable dispute resolution system to identify and cut off illegal and abusive activity in their user community. Other transaction systems such as Webmoney.ru and Goldmoney.com learned from e-gold's mistakes and were able to successfully field similar systems with low rates of abuse by addressing these deficiencies. While PayPal has done a better job of addressing abuse than e-gold did, they now contend with the same kind of Internet fraud that took down e-gold. Financial cryptographers have observed that Bitcoin has repeated the same fundamental errors that e-gold made, and that despite its decentralized nature the cyber crime-wave might bring Bitcoin to a similar ending. According to GoldMoney's website, BitGold announced the acquisition of GoldMoney on May 22, 2015. = Petition to vacate 2008 convictions = On July 2 2020, e-gold Ltd, Gold & Silver Reserve, Inc, Douglas Jackson, Barry Downey, and Reid Jackson filed a writ of coram nobis petition in the United States District Court for the District of Columbia seeking to vacate, with prejudice, their 2008 convictions. The petitioners allege that the government intentionally withheld exculpatory evidence from its Brady disclosure that would have resulted in the defendants declining to enter into plea agreements for any of the counts on the indictment and should have informed the court‚Äôs ruling on the defendants‚Äô motion to dismiss the money transmitter specific counts on the indictment against them. Specifically, the petitioners allege that a business substantially similar to that of E-gold Ltd was advised by the District of Columbia Department of Insurance, Securities, and Banking that it did not require a money transmitting license pursuant to D.C. law, causing the petitioners to realize that the government may have misrepresented the applicability of state money transmitting laws to e-gold. The petitioners further allege that this resulted in public records requests which yielded evidence that the government had instructed the Florida Office of Financial Regulation to refrain from issuing or publishing its legal opinion that neither of the companies were money transmitters per Florida law during the pendency of the grand jury investigation of the companies.

The city is located in present-day Osun State. Ife is about 218 kilometers northeast of Lagos\\"World: Africa Arrests after Nigerian cult killings\\". BBC News. Monday July 12, 1999, Retrieved on October 31, 2011. with a population of 509,813. According to the traditions of the Yoruba religion, Ife was founded by the order of the Supreme God Olodumare by Obatala. It then fell into the hands of his sibling Oduduwa, which created enmity between the two.Bascom, Yoruba, p. 10; Stride, Ifeka: \\"Peoples and Empires\\", p. 290. Oduduwa created a dynasty there, and sons and daughters of this dynasty became rulers of many other kingdoms in Yorubaland.Akinjogbin, I. A. (Hg.): The Cradle of a Race: Ife from the Beginning to 1980, Lagos 1992 (The book also has chapters on the present religious situation in the town). The first O√≤ni of Ife is a descendant of Oduduwa, which was the 401st Orisha. The present ruler since 2015 is Oba Adeyeye Enitan Ogunwusi Ojaja II, Ooni of Ife who is also a Nigerian accountant.Olupona, 201 Gods, 94. Named as the city of 401 deities, Ife is home to many worshippers of these deities and is where they are routinely celebrated through festivals. Il√©-If√® is famous worldwide for its ancient and naturalistic bronze, stone and terracotta sculptures, dating back to between 1200 and 1400 A.D. History =Mythic origin of Ife: Creation of the world= Yoruba Copper mask for King Obalufon, Ife, Nigeria c. 1300 C.E. According to Yoruba religion, Olodumare, the Supreme God, ordered Obatala to create the earth, but on his way he found palm wine which he drank and became intoxicated. Therefore, the younger brother of the latter, Oduduwa, took the three items of creation from him, climbed down from the heavens on a chain and threw a handful of earth on the primordial ocean, then put a cockerel on it so that it would scatter the earth, thus creating the land on which Ile Ife would be built. Oduduwa planted a palm nut in a hole in the newly formed land and from there sprang a great tree with sixteen branches, a symbolic representation of the clans of the early Ife city-state. The usurpation of creation, by Oduduwa, gave rise to the ever-lasting conflict between him and his elder brother Obatala, which is still re-enacted in the modern era by the cult groups of the two clans during the Itapa New Year festival.Olupona, 201 Gods, 144-173; Lange, Ancient Kingdoms, 347‚Äì366; idem., \\"Preservation\\", 130-1. On account of his creation of the world, Oduduwa became the ancestor of the first divine king of the Yoruba, while Obatala is believed to have created the first Yoruba people out of clay. The meaning of the word \\"ife\\" in Yoruba is \\"expansion\\"; \\"Ile-Ife\\" is therefore in reference to the myth of origin as \\"The Land of Expansion\\". =Origin of the regional states: Dispersal from the holy city= Oduduwa had sons, daughters, and a grandson, who went on to found their own kingdoms and empires, namely Ila Orangun, Owu, Ketu, Sabe, Egba, Popo and Oyo. Oranmiyan, Oduduwa's last born, was one of his father's principal ministers and overseer of the nascent Edo empire after Oduduwa granted the plea of the Edo people for his governance. When Oranmiyan decided to go back to Ile Ife, after a period of service and exile in Benin, he left behind a child named Eweka that he had in the interim with an indigenous princess of Benin. The young boy went on to become the first legitimate ruler and Oba of the second Edo dynasty that has ruled what is now Benin from that day to this. Oranmiyan later went on to found the Oyo empire that stretched at its height from the western banks of the river Niger to the Eastern banks of the river Volta. It would serve as one of the most powerful of Africa's medieval states, prior to its collapse in the 19th century. Traditional setting =The King (Ooni of Ile-Ife)= The O√≤ni (or king) of Ife is a descendant of the godking Oduduwa, and is counted first among the Yoruba kings. He is traditionally considered the 401st spirit (Orisha), the only one that speaks. In fact, the royal dynasty of Ife traces its origin back to the founding of the city more than ten thousand years before the birth of Jesus Christ. The present ruler is His Imperial Majesty Oba Enitan Adeyeye Ogunwusi (Ojaja II). The Ooni ascended his throne in 2015. Following the formation of the Yoruba Orisha Congress in 1986, the Ooni acquired an international status the likes of which the holders of his title hadn't had since the city's colonisation by the British. Nationally he had always been prominent amongst the Federal Republic of Nigeria's company of royal Obas, being regarded as the chief priest and custodian of the holy city of all the Yorubas. In former times, the palace of the Ooni of Ife was a structure built of authentic enameled bricks, decorated with artistic porcelain tiles and all sorts of ornaments.Cheikh Anta Diop's Precolonial Black Africa, pg. 203 At present, it is a more modern series of buildings. The current Ooni, Oba Adeyeye Enitan Ogunwusi Ojaja II, Ooni of Ife, (born October 17, 1974) is a Nigerian accountant and the 51st Ooni of Ife. He succeeded the late Oba Okunade Sijuwade(Olubuse II) who was the 50th ooni of Ife, and who had died on July 28, 2015. =Cults for the spirits= Ife is well known as the city of 401 deities (also known as irumole or orishas). It is said that every day of the year the traditional worshippers celebrate a festival of one of these deities. Often the festivals extend over more than one day and they involve both priestly activities in the palace and theatrical dramatisations in the rest of the kingdom. Historically the King only appeared in public during the annual Olojo festival (celebration of the new dawn); other important festivals here include the Itapa festival for Obatala and Obameri, the Edi festival for Moremi Ajasoro, and the Igare masqueraders.Walsh, \\"Edi festival\\", 231-8; Bascom, \\"Olojo\\", 64-72; Lange, Ancient Kingdoms, 358-366; Olupona, 201 Gods'. =Art history= Kings and gods were often depicted with large heads because the artists believed that the Ase was held in the head, the Ase being the inner power and energy of a person. Both historic figures of Ife and the offices associated with them are represented. One of the best documented among this is the early king Obalufon II who is said to have invented bronze casting and is honored in the form of a naturalistic copper life-size mask. The city was a settlement of substantial size between the 12th and 14th centuries, with houses featuring potsherd pavements. Il√©-If√® is known worldwide for its ancient and naturalistic bronze, stone and terracotta sculptures, which reached their peak of artistic expression between 1200 and 1400 A.D. In the period around 1300 C.E. the artists at Ife developed a refined and naturalistic sculptural tradition in terracotta, stone and copper alloy‚Äîcopper, brass, and bronze‚Äîmany of which appear to have been created under the patronage of King Obalufon II, the man who today is identified as the Yoruba patron deity of brass casting, weaving and regalia.name=\\"Blier Art and Risk\\"> After this period, production declined as political and economic power shifted to the nearby kingdom of Benin which, like the Yoruba kingdom of Oyo, developed into a major empire. Bronze and terracotta art created by this civilization are significant examples of naturalism in pre-colonial African art and are distinguished by their variations in regalia, facial marking patterns, and body proportions. Ancient Ife also was famous for its glass beads which have been found at sites as far away as Mali, Mauritania, and Ghana.

Burnt pipes (or tuyere), stone tools, broken calabash, decorated potsherds, and pottery (e.g., rimsherd, plane-sherd body, broken, and washed pottery) were excavated at Iyekere. Iron smelting, charcoal utilized in the process of smelting, and iron slags involved in pitting were also discovered. Iron smelting occurred in the Ife region. The yield and efficiency were quite high as the iron smelting process yielded ore grade near 80 percent iron oxide, lean slag possessed less than 60 percent iron oxide, and no greater than the required amount of iron oxide in the slag was left for slag formation. While more excavation is needed to produce a more accurate estimate for the age of the smelting site, it can be approximated to likely being precolonial, during the Late Iron Age. Igbo Olokun, also known as Olokun Grove, may be one of the earliest workshops for producing glass in West Africa. Glass production may have begun during, if not before, the 11th century. The 11th - 15th century were the peak of glass production (according to Babalola). High lime, high alumina (HLHA) and low lime, high alumina (LLHA) glass are distinct compositions that were developed using locally sourced recipes, raw materials, and pyrotechnology. The presence of HLHA glass beads discovered throughout West Africa (e.g., Igbo-Ukwu in southern Nigeria, Gao and Essouk in Mali, and Kissi in Burkina Faso), after the ninth century CE, reveals the broader importance of this glass industry in the region and shows its participation in regional trade networks (e.g., trans-Saharan trade, trans-Atlantic trade). Glass beads served as ‚Äúthe currency for negotiating political power, economic relations, and cultural/spiritual values‚Äù for ‚ÄúYoruba, West Africans, and the African diaspora.‚Äù In Osun Grove, the distinct glassmaking technology produced by the Yoruba persisted into the seventeenth century. Government The main city of Ife is divided into two local government areas: Ife East, headquartered at Oke-ogbo and Ife central at Ajebandele area of the city. Both local governments are composed of a total of 21 political wards. The city has an estimated population of 355,813 people.YOADE, Adewale Olufunlola. \\"PHYSICAL CHARACTERISTICS OF CORE AREA OF ILE-IFE, NIGERIA.\\" Annals Of The University Of Oradea, Geography Series / Analele Universitatii Din Oradea, Seria Geografie 25, no. 2 (December 2015): 137-147.

Ile-Ife is a rural area with settlements where agriculture is occupied by most. Ife has an undulating terrain underlain by metamorphic rocks and characterized by two types of soils, deep clay soils on the upper slopes and sandy soils on the lower parts. Within the tropical savanna climate zone of West Africa. It has average rainfall of usually from March to October and a mean relative humidity of 75% to 100%. Ife is east of the city of Ibadan and connected to it through the Ife-Ibadan highway; Ife is also from Osogbo and has road networks to other cities such as Ede, Ondo and Ilesha. There is the Opa river and reservoir, that serves as a water treatment facility for OAU college. Economy Ife contains universities that are very well known in Nigeria such as Obafemi Awolowo University formerly University of Ife. It also contains attractions like the Natural History Museum of Nigeria. Ife is home to a regional agricultural center with an area that produces vegetables, grain cacao, tobacco, and cotton. Ife has a few open markets, such as Oja Titun or Odo-gbe market with about 1,500 shops.I.A.

In a sense, the Imperial victory titles give an interesting summary of which wars and which adversaries were considered significant by the senior leadership of the Roman Empire, but in some cases more opportunistic motifs play a role, even to the point of glorifying a victory that was by no means a real triumph (but celebrated as one for internal political prestige).

Life On December 20, 1939, a great sympathy meeting for Finland, then embroiled in the Winter War, was arranged in Madison Square Garden. In the picture from the left are former president Herbert Hoover (chairman of the Finland-committee), Dr. van Loon, and the mayor of New York Fiorello La Guardia. He was born in Rotterdam, Netherlands, the son of Hendrik Willem van Loon and Elisabeth Johanna Hanken. He immigrated to the United States in 1902 to study at Harvard University and then Cornell University, where he received his AB in 1905. In 1906Van Loon, Eliza Bowditch. Papers, 1906‚Äì1907, Radcliffe College he married Eliza Ingersoll Bowditch (1880‚Äì1955), daughter of a Harvard professor, by whom he had two sons, Henry Bowditch and Gerard Willem. The newlyweds moved to Germany, where van Loon received his Ph.D. from the University of Munich in 1911 with a dissertation that became his first book, The Fall of the Dutch Republic (1913). He was a correspondent for the Associated Press during the Russian Revolution of 1905 and again in Belgium in 1914 at the start of World War I. He lectured at Cornell University from 1915 to 1916; in 1919 he became an American citizen. Van Loon had two later marriages, to Eliza Helen (Jimmie) Criswell in 1920 and playwright Frances Goodrich Ames in 1927, but after a divorce from Ames he returned to Criswell (it is debatable whether or not they remarried); she inherited his estate in 1944. Career Frontispiece to Hendrik Willem Van Loon's 1922 book Ancient Man. \\"The Young Nile\\", illustration by Hendrik Willem Van Loon for his book Ancient Man, 1922. From the 1910s until his death, Van Loon wrote many books, illustrating them himself. Best remembered among these is The Story of Mankind (1921), a history of the world intended for children, which won the first Newbery Medal in 1922. The book was later updated by Van Loon and has continued to be updated, first by his son and later by other historians. However, he also wrote many other very popular books aimed at young adults. As a writer he was known for emphasizing crucial historical events and giving a complete picture of individual characters, as well as the role of the arts in history. He also had an informal and thought-provoking style which, particularly in The Story of Mankind, included personal anecdotes. As an illustrator of his own books, he was known for his lively black-and-white drawings and his chronological diagrams. In 1923 and 1924, he was a professor of history at Antioch College. After having revisited Germany many times in the 1920s, he was banned from the country when the Nazis came to power. His book Our Battle, Being One Man's Answer to \\"My Battle\\" by Adolf Hitler (1938) earned him the respect of Franklin D. Roosevelt, in whose 1940 presidential campaign he worked, calling on Americans to fight totalitarianism.

The population was 7,973 at the 2010 census. Rutland is the geographic center of Massachusetts; a tree, the Central Tree, located on Central Tree Road, marks the general spot. History The town was first settled in 1666 as Naquag. Officially incorporated in 1713, the Town of Rutland was made up of Barre, Hubbardston, Oakham, Princeton, and the northern half of Paxton. In Northern Rutland there are prison camps used during the Revolutionary War used for captured Hessian mercenaries hired by the British. The town's most famous citizen is Rufus Putnam, who was George Washington's chief engineer in the American Revolutionary War. He held various town offices in Rutland and served as Representative to the General Court.

Education Rutland is a part of the Wachusett Regional School District. There are two elementary schools: Naquag Elementary, for grades up to 2nd (named after the tribe of Indians that once resided there), and Glenwood Elementary, grades 3rd through 5th. The middle school is Central Tree Middle School. The public high schools are Wachusett Regional High School in Holden, and Bay Path Regional Vocational Technical High School in Charlton. =Library= The Rutland public library was founded c. 1865.C.

Such research is sometimes described as vivisection.

However, as vivisection etymologically means a surgery on a living being, all forms of open surgery on living people are literally human vivisection. Animal vivisection An anesthetized pig used for training a surgeon Research requiring vivisection techniques that cannot be met through other means is often subject to an external ethics review in conception and implementation, and in many jurisdictions use of anesthesia is legally mandated for any surgery likely to cause pain to any vertebrate. In the United States, the Animal Welfare Act explicitly requires that any procedure that may cause pain use \\"tranquilizers, analgesics, and anesthetics\\", with exceptions when \\"scientifically necessary\\". The act does not define \\"scientific necessity\\" or regulate specific scientific procedures, but approval or rejection of individual techniques in each federally funded lab is determined on a case-by- case basis by the Institutional Animal Care and Use Committee, which contains at least one veterinarian, one scientist, one non-scientist, and one other individual from outside the university. In the United Kingdom, any experiment involving vivisection must be licensed by the Home Secretary. The Animals (Scientific Procedures) Act 1986 \\"expressly directs that, in determining whether to grant a licence for an experimental project, 'the Secretary of State shall weigh the likely adverse effects on the animals concerned against the benefit likely to accrue. In Australia, the Code of Practice \\"requires that all experiments must be approved by an Animal Experimentation Ethics Committee\\" that includes a \\"person with an interest in animal welfare who is not employed by the institution conducting the experiment, and an additional independent person not involved in animal experimentation.\\"Singer, Peter. Animal Liberation. Avon: New York, 1990, p. 77 Anti-vivisectionists have played roles in the emergence of the animal welfare and animal rights movements, arguing that animals and humans have the same natural rights as living creatures, and that it is inherently immoral to inflict pain or injury on another living creature, regardless of the purpose or potential benefit to mankind. = Vivisection and anti-vivisection in the 19th century = At the turn of the 19th century, medicine was undergoing a transformation. The emergence of hospitals and the development of more advanced medical tools such as the stethoscope are but a few of the changes in the medical field. There was also an increased recognition that medical practices needed to be improved, as many of the current therapeutics were based on unproven, traditional theories that may or may not have helped the patient recover. The demand for more effective treatment shifted emphasis to research with the goal of understanding disease mechanisms and anatomy. This shift had a few effects, one of which was the rise in patient experimentation, leading to some moral questions about what was acceptable in clinical trials and what was not. An easy solution to the moral problem was to use animals in vivisection experiments, so as not to endanger human patients. This, however, had its own set of moral obstacles, leading to the anti-vivisection movement.  Fran√ßois Magendie (1783‚Äì1855)  One polarizing figure in the anti- vivisection movement was Fran√ßois Magendie. Magendie was a physiologist at the Acad√©mie Royale de M√©decine in France, established in the first half of the 19th century. Magendie made several groundbreaking medical discoveries, but was far more aggressive than some of his other contemporaries with his use of animal experimentation. For example, the discovery of the different functionalities of dorsal and ventral spinal nerve roots was achieved by both Magendie, as well as a Scottish anatomist named Charles Bell. Bell used an unconscious rabbit because of \\"the protracted cruelty of the dissection\\", which caused him to miss that the dorsal roots were also responsible for sensory information. Magendie, on the other hand, used conscious, six-week-old puppies for his own experiments. While Magendie's approach was more of an infringement on what we would today call animal rights, both Bell and Magendie used the same justification for vivisection: the cost of animal lives and experimentation was well worth it for the benefit of humanity. Many viewed Magendie's work as cruel and unnecessarily torturous. One note is that Magendie carried out many of his experiments before the advent of anesthesia, but even after ether was discovered it was not used in any of his experiments or classes. Even during the period before anesthesia, other physiologists expressed their disgust with how he conducted his work. One such visiting American physiologist describes the animals as \\"victims\\" and the apparent sadism that Magendie displayed when teaching his classes. The cruelty in such experiments actually even led to Magendie's role as an important figure in animal-rights legislation. He was so despised in Britain that his experiments were cited in the drafting of the Cruel Treatment of Cattle Act 1822 and the Cruelty to Animals Act 1876.  David Ferrier and the Cruelty to Animals Act 1876  Prior to vivisection for educational purposes, chloroform was administered as an anesthetic to this common sand frog. The Cruelty to Animals Act, 1876 in Britain determined that one could only conduct vivisection on animals with the appropriate license from the state, and that the work the physiologist was doing had to be original and absolutely necessary. The stage was set for such legislation by physiologist David Ferrier. Ferrier was a pioneer in understanding the brain and used animals to show that certain locales of the brain corresponded to bodily movement elsewhere in the body in 1873. He put these animals to sleep, and caused them to move unconsciously with a probe. Ferrier was successful, but many decried his use of animals in his experiments. Some of these arguments came from a religious standpoint. Some were concerned that Ferrier's experiments would separate God from the mind of man in the name of science. Some of the anti-vivisection movement in England had its roots in Evangelicalism and Quakerism. These religions already had a distrust for science, only intensified by the recent publishing of Darwin's Theory of Evolution in 1859. Neither side was pleased with how the Cruelty to Animals Act 1876 was passed. The scientific community felt as though the government was restricting their ability to compete with the quickly advancing France and Germany with new regulations. The anti- vivisection movement was also unhappy, but because they believed that it was a concession to scientists for allowing vivisection to continue at all. Ferrier would continue to vex the anti-vivisection movement in Britain with his experiments when he had a debate with his German opponent, Friedrich Goltz. They would effectively enter the vivisection arena, with Ferrier presenting a monkey, and Goltz presenting a dog, both of which had already been operated on. Ferrier won the debate, but did not have a license, leading the anti- vivisection movement to sue him in 1881. Ferrier was not found guilty, as his assistant was the one operating, and his assistant did have a license. Ferrier and his practices gained public support, leaving the anti-vivisection movement scrambling. They made the moral argument that given recent developments, scientists would venture into more extreme practices to operating on \\"the cripple, the mute, the idiot, the convict, the pauper, to enhance the ‚Äúinterest‚Äù of [the physiologist's] experiments\\". Human vivisection It is possible that human vivisection was practiced by some Greek anatomists in Alexandria in the 3rd century BC. Celsus in De Medicina and the early- Christian writer Tertullian state that Herophilos of Alexandria vivisected at least 600 live prisoners. Tertullian, De Anima 10. Unit 731, a biological and chemical warfare research and development unit of the Imperial Japanese Army, undertook lethal human experimentation during the period that comprised both the Second Sino-Japanese War, and the Second World War (1937‚Äì1945). In Mindanao, Moro Muslim prisoners of war were subjected to various forms of vivisection by the Japanese, in many cases without anesthesia.\\"Unmasking Horror\\" Nicholas D. Kristof (March 17, 1995) New York Times. A special report.; Japan Confronting Gruesome War Atrocity Nazi human experimentation involved many medical experiments on live subjects, such as vivisections by Josef Mengele,Brozan, Nadine. Out of Death, a Zest for Life. New York Times, November 15, 1982 usually without anesthesia. Vivisection without anesthesia was an execution method employed by the Khmer Rouge at the Tuol Sleng prison. Only seven people survived the four-year run of the prison before its liberation by the Vietnamese army in January 1979.

Roman history  The honor of being called pater patriae was conferred by the Roman Senate. It was first awarded to Roman general Marcus Furius Camillus in 386 BC, who for his role in the aftermath of the Gallic siege of Rome was considered a second founder of the city, in succession to Romulus. Three centuries later, it was awarded to the orator and statesman Marcus Tullius Cicero for his part in the suppression of the Catilinarian conspiracy during his consulate in 63 BC. It was next awarded to Julius Caesar, who as dictator became the de facto ruler of the Roman republic and its imperium, for having ended the civil wars. The Senate voted the title to Caesar Augustus in 2 BC, but being neither important for the ruler's legitimacy nor for his legal powers, it did not become a regular part of the imperial honors, contrary to Imperator, Caesar, Augustus, princeps senatus, pontifex maximus and tribunicia potestas. According to the historian Suetonius, Augustus' successor, Tiberius, was offered this title, but refused it.Suetonius ‚Ä¢ Life of Tiberius The Senate eventually conferred the title on many Roman emperors, often only after many years of rule, or if the new emperor was particularly esteemed by the senators, as in the case of Nerva. As a result, many of the short-lived Emperors never received the title. The honor was subject to the approval of the honored, who could decline it. Tiberius did so and Nero did so when first offered the honor during the first year of his reign, on account of his youth, though he later accepted when the honor was conferred on him for a second time. It was traditional for the honored, in a proper sign of humility, to defer the honor for some time once conferred. Hadrian deferred for eleven years, for example.Anthony Birley. \\"Marcus Aurelius: A Biography\\". Yale University Press: New Haven, CT, 1987, p. 57.

This was the final episode of Babylon 5 to air on PTEN, produced as a replacement for \\"Sleeping in Light\\" when the show was renewed by TNT. Plot This episode takes place after the events of the rest of the series. It shows the long-term effect of the Interstellar Alliance from the point of view of one hundred, five hundred, one thousand, and one million years after the founding of the Alliance. * 2262: Three viewpoints are debated on an ISN broadcast: pro-Clark elements try to paint John Sheridan as a madman, others (particularly the outer colonies and Mars) view Sheridan and the Babylon 5 forces as liberators, and a third commentator treats Sheridan in a neutral fashion. * 2362: A live televised debate presents two historians mistakenly believing that the role of Sheridan and Babylon 5 in the war against the Shadows and overthrowing Clark has been mythologized, and that Sheridan was power-hungry. An aged Delenn makes a surprise entry to the debate, saying that Sheridan was a good, kind, and decent man. She chastises the historians for fabricating \\"facts\\" to fill in the gaps of their knowledge. * 2762: Amid growing tension between the Interstellar Alliance and xenophobic elements on Human-settled planets, an anti-Alliance faction attempts to set up forged holographic records to show the heroes of Babylon 5 to be megalomaniacal war criminals. These holograms are based on historical data and recorded memories of the original crew, with the forged records overriding their personalities. Sheridan is programmed to make an impassioned speech about conquering Earth before soon-to-be massacred prisoners and Dr. Franklin is programmed to act out a scene showing him talking clinically about horrific experiments involving human children and alien organs. Before Garibaldi is reprogrammed, he stalls by getting the programmer, Daniel, to reveal his faction's plans to launch a sneak attack on civilian population centers as the start of an all-out war while Garibaldi, who is aware that he is a computer program, hacks into the computer network and broadcasts the conversation. Before Daniel can turn off the holograms, an alarm sounds, indicating an imminent missile attack. Daniel runs, knowing that pro-Alliance forces have launched their own attack, moments before a nuclear explosion envelops the anti-Alliance base. * 3262: The resulting war reduced human civilization on Earth to sparsely-populated medieval villages. Two monks in an abbey discuss the greatly mythologized figures from Babylon 5, with the younger monk, Brother Michael, doubting that they even existed. The older monk, Brother Alwyn, speculates that the Rangers, prophesied to return to Earth someday, would probably operate on Earth in secret. When Brother Michael leaves, it is revealed that Alwyn is a Ranger himself, showing that the pro- Alliance faction won the war and has been slowly and secretly building up Earth civilization to avoid the development of resentful, anti-alien factions. A series of Roman numerals can be found at the bottom left of the screen representing the hidden cameras of the Ranger. * One million years later: A man is shown to have watched the above archived footage. He instructs his computer to transmit all data to New Earth. The computer warns that the sun will go nova soon due to atypical solar activity. Before leaving the system, the man transforms into an energy-based life-form that enters an encounter suit similar to the ones used by the Vorlons. As his ship, with a Ranger logo on it, departs the system, the Sun goes nova and is destroyed. * 2262: John Sheridan and Delenn are discussing everything they have done, and if anyone will even remember them in a hundred years. They conclude that they probably won't be remembered, but did what was right anyway. Production The footage with Garibaldi and the telepaths foreshadows events in \\"Phoenix Rising\\". At the time of filming, \\"Phoenix Rising\\" had not been written and most of season 5 existed only as an outline. During the filming of the fourth season, the show appeared destined for cancellation. As a result, plotlines were shortened and resolved ahead of schedule. After the completion of the final episode, but before its airing, the cable network TNT approached the creators of the show with an offer of cable distribution and funding for a fifth season. The show's creator, J. Michael Straczynski, insisted that the final episode (\\"Sleeping in Light\\") not be seen prematurely. As a result, a new fourth-season finale had to be constructed. The episode was filmed as part of the fifth-season production run, and hurriedly constructed for airing in its proper place before the switchover from PTEN to TNT. This is the reason that Claudia Christian, who had left the show prior to the fifth season, appears in the series finale. The form of this episode is substantially different from most episodes of Babylon 5. All other episodes were shot as unified storylines, but \\"Deconstruction\\" exists as a series of vignettes examining society's views of the events of the series from increasingly distant future viewpoints: one year; one hundred years; five hundred years; one thousand years; and eventually one million years in the future. The episode ends with a dedication: > \\"DEDICATED TO ALL THE PEOPLE WHO PREDICTED THAT THE BABYLON PROJECT WOULD > FAIL IN ITS MISSION. FAITH MANAGES.\\" On CIS, J. Michael Straczynski described this message thus: > \\"On the one hand, it is a statement of hope to anyone else out there who has > a dream, to follow it no matter who speaks against you, no matter the odds, > no matter what they say to or about you, no matter what roadblocks they > throw in your way. What matters is that you remain true to your vision. \\"On > the other hand, for the reviewers and the pundits and the critics and the > net-stalkers who have done nothing but rag on this show for five years > straight, it is also a giant middle finger composed of red neon fifty > stories tall, that will burn forever in the night. \\"In billiards, we call > that a bank shot.\\" =Monastery sequence= The vignette that takes place one thousand years later in a monastery bears some similarities to Walter M.

It is primarily associated with acts of violence perpetrated by proponents of insurrectionary anarchism in the late 19th and early 20th century, including bombings and assassinations aimed at the ruling class, but also had non-violent applications.Anarchist historian George Woodcock, when dealing with the evolution of anarcho-pacifism in the early 20th century, reports that \\"the modern pacifist anarchists, ...have tended to concentrate their attention largely on the creation of libertarian communities ‚Äì particularly farming communities ‚Äì within present society, as a kind of peaceful version of the propaganda by deed.\\" George Woodcock. Anarchism: A History of Libertarian Ideas and Movements (1962), page 20. These deeds were intended to ignite the \\"spirit of revolt\\" in the people by demonstrating the state was not omnipotent and by offering hope to the downtrodden, and also to expand support for anarchist movements as the state grew more repressive in its response. In 1881, the International Anarchist Congress of London gave the tactic its approval. Anarchist origins =Various definitions= One of the first individuals to conceptualise propaganda by the deed was the Italian revolutionary Carlo Pisacane (1818‚Äì57), who wrote in his \\"Political Testament\\" (1857) that \\"ideas spring from deeds and not the other way around.\\" Mikhail Bakunin (1814‚Äì1876), in his \\"Letters to a Frenchman on the Present Crisis\\" (1870) stated that \\"we must spread our principles, not with words but with deeds, for this is the most popular, the most potent, and the most irresistible form of propaganda.\\"\\"Letter to a Frenchman on the Present Crisis\\" (1870) by Mikhail Bakunin The concept, in a broader setting, has a rich heritage, as the words of Francis of Assisi reveal: \\"Let them show their love by the works they do for each other, according as the Apostle says: 'let us not love in word or in tongue, but in deed and in truth. Johann Most Some anarchists, such as Johann Most, advocated publicizing violent acts of retaliation against counter-revolutionaries because \\"we preach not only action in and for itself, but also action as propaganda.\\"\\"Action as Propaganda\\" by Johann Most, July 25, 1885 It was not advocacy for mass murder, but a call for targeted killings of the representatives of capitalism and government at a time when such action might garner sympathy from the population, such as during periods of government repression or labor conflicts, although Most himself once boasted that \\"the existing system will be quickest and most radically overthrown by the annihilation of its exponents. Therefore, massacres of the enemies of the people must be set in motion.\\" In 1885, he published The Science of Revolutionary Warfare,Revolution√§re Kriegswissenschaft: Eine Handb√ºchlein zur Anleitung Betreffend Gebrauches und Herstellung von Nitro-Glycerin, Dynamit, Schiessbaumwolle, Knallquecksilber, Bomben, Brands√§tzen, Giften usw., usw. (The Science of Revolutionary Warfare: A Little Handbook of Instruction in the Use and Preparation of Nitroglycerine, Dynamite, Gun-Cotton, Fulminating Mercury, Bombs, Fuses, Poisons, Etc., Etc.). New York: Internationaler Zeitung-Verein, 1885; Desert Publications, 1978 (reprint). a technical manual for acquiring and detonating explosives based on the knowledge he acquired by working at an explosives factory in New Jersey. Most was an early influence on American anarchists Emma Goldman and Alexander Berkman. Berkman attempted propaganda by the deed when he tried in 1892 to kill industrialist Henry Clay Frick following the deaths by shooting of several striking workers.Prison Memoirs of an Anarchist (1912) by Alexander Berkman Beverly Gage, professor of U.S. history at Yale University, elaborates on what the concept meant to outsiders and those within the anarchist movement: By the 1880s, the slogan \\"propaganda of the deed\\" had begun to be used both within and outside of the anarchist movement to refer to individual bombings, regicides and tyrannicides. In 1881, \\"propaganda by the deed\\" was formally adopted as a strategy by the anarchist London Congress. In 1886, French anarchist Cl√©ment Duval achieved a form of propaganda of the deed, stealing 15,000 francs from the mansion of a Parisian socialite, before accidentally setting the house on fire. Caught two weeks later, he was dragged from the court crying \\"Long live anarchy!\\", and condemned to death. Duval's sentence was later commuted to hard labor on Devil's Island, French Guiana. In the anarchist paper R√©volte, Duval famously declared that, \\"Theft exists only through the exploitation of man by man... when Society refuses you the right to exist, you must take it... the policeman arrested me in the name of the Law, I struck him in the name of Liberty\\". As early as 1887, a few important figures in the anarchist movement had begun to distance themselves from individual acts of violence. Peter Kropotkin thus wrote that year in Le R√©volt√© that \\"a structure based on centuries of history cannot be destroyed with a few kilos of dynamite\\".quoted in Billington, James H. 1998. Fire in the minds of men: origins of the revolutionary faith New Jersey: Transaction Books, p. 417. A variety of anarchists advocated the abandonment of these sorts of tactics in favor of collective revolutionary action, for example through the trade union movement. The anarcho-syndicalist, Fernand Pelloutier, argued in 1895 for renewed anarchist involvement in the labor movement on the basis that anarchism could do very well without \\"the individual dynamiter.\\" State repression (including the infamous 1894 French lois sc√©l√©rates) of the anarchist and labor movements following the few successful bombings and assassinations may have contributed to the abandonment of these kinds of tactics, although reciprocally state repression, in the first place, may have played a role in these isolated acts. The dismemberment of the French socialist movement, into many groups and, following the suppression of the 1871 Paris Commune, the execution and exile of many communards to penal colonies, favored individualist political expression and acts.Historian Benedict Anderson thus writes: > In March 1871 the Commune took power in the abandoned city and held it for > two months. Then Versailles seized the moment to attack and, in one > horrifying week, executed roughly 20,000 Communards or suspected > sympathizers, a number higher than those killed in the recent war or during > Robespierre‚Äôs ‚ÄòTerror‚Äô of 1793‚Äì94.

According to some analysts, in post-war Germany, the prohibition of the Communist Party (KPD) and thus of institutional far-left political organization may also, in the same manner, have played a role in the creation of the Red Army Faction. Anarchist historian Max Nettlau provided a more complex concept of propaganda when he said that, Later anarchist authors advocating \\"propaganda of the deed\\" included the German anarchist Gustav Landauer, and the Italians Errico Malatesta and Luigi Galleani. For Gustav Landauer, \\"propaganda of the deed\\" meant the creation of libertarian social forms and communities that would inspire others to transform society.Gustav Landauer, \\"Anarchism in Germany,\\" 1895 In \\"Weak Statesmen, Weaker People,\\" he wrote that the state is not something \\"that one can smash in order to destroy. The state is a relationship between human beings... one destroys it by entering into other relationships.\\"Der Sozialist, (1910) In contrast, Errico Malatesta described \\"propaganda by the deed\\" as violent communal insurrections that were meant to ignite the imminent revolution. However, Malatesta himself denounced the use of terrorism and violent physical force, stating in one of his essays: At the other extreme, the anarchist Luigi Galleani, perhaps the most vocal proponent of \\"propaganda by the deed\\" from the turn of the century through the end of the First World War, took undisguised pride in describing himself as a subversive, a revolutionary propagandist and advocate of the violent overthrow of established government and institutions through the use of 'direct action', i.e., bombings and assassinations.Galleani, Luigi, La Fine Dell'Anarchismo?, ed. Curata da Vecchi Lettori di Cronaca Sovversiva, University of Michigan (1925), pp. 61‚Äì62: Galleani's writings are clear on this point: he had undisguised contempt for those who refused to both advocate and directly participate in the violent overthrow of capitalism.Galleani, Luigi, Faccia a Faccia col Nemico, Boston, MA: Gruppo Autonomo, (1914) Galleani heartily embraced physical violence and terrorism, not only against symbols of the government and the capitalist system, such as courthouses and factories, but also through direct assassination of 'enemies of the people': capitalists, industrialists, politicians, judges, and policemen.Avrich, Paul, Sacco and Vanzetti: The Anarchist Background, Princeton University Press (1991), pp. 51, 98‚Äì99 He had a particular interest in the use of bombs, going so far as to include a formula for the explosive nitroglycerine in one of his pamphlets advertised through his monthly magazine, Cronaca Sovversiva. By all accounts, Galleani was an extremely effective speaker and advocate of his policy of violent action, attracting a number of devoted Italian-American anarchist followers who called themselves Galleanists. Carlo Buda, the brother of Galleanist bombmaker Mario Buda, said of him, \\"You heard Galleani speak, and you were ready to shoot the first policeman you saw\\".Avrich, Paul, Anarchist Voices: An Oral History of Anarchism in America, Princeton: Princeton University Press (1996), p. 132 (Interview of Charles Poggi) =Illegalism= Propaganda of the deed is also related to illegalism, an anarchist philosophy that developed primarily in France, Italy, Belgium, and Switzerland during the early 20th century as an outgrowth of anarchist individualism. The illegalists openly embraced criminality as a lifestyle. Influenced by theorist Max Stirner's concept of \\"egoism\\", the illegalists broke from anarchists like Cl√©ment Duval and Marius Jacob who justified theft with a theory of individual reclamation. Instead, the illegalists argued that their actions required no moral basis ‚Äì illegal acts were taken not in the name of a higher ideal, but in pursuit of one's own desires. France's Bonnot Gang was the most famous group to embrace illegalism. =Relationship to revolution= Propaganda of the deed thus included stealing (in particular bank robberies ‚Äì named \\"expropriations\\" or \\"revolutionary expropriations\\" to finance the organization), rioting and general strikes which aimed at creating the conditions of an insurrection or even a revolution. These acts were justified as the necessary counterpart to state repression. As early as 1911, Leon Trotsky condemned individual acts of violence by anarchists as useful for little more than providing an excuse for state repression. \\"The anarchist prophets of the 'propaganda by the deed' can argue all they want about the elevating and stimulating influence of terrorist acts on the masses,\\" he wrote in 1911, \\"Theoretical considerations and political experience prove otherwise.\\" Vladimir Lenin largely agreed, viewing individual anarchist acts of terrorism as an ineffective substitute for coordinated action by disciplined cadres of the masses. Both Lenin and Trotsky acknowledged the necessity of violent rebellion and assassination to serve as a catalyst for revolution, but they distinguished between the ad hoc bombings and assassinations carried out by proponents of the propaganda of the deed, and organized violence coordinated by a professional revolutionary vanguard utilized for that specific end. Sociologist Max Weber wrote that the state has a \\"monopoly on the legitimate use of physical force\\", or, in Karl Marx's words, the state was only the repressive apparatus of the bourgeois class. Propaganda by the deed, including assassinations (sometimes involving bombs, named in French \\"machines infernales\\" ‚Äì \\"hellish machines\\", usually made with bombs, sometimes only several guns assembled together), were thus legitimized by part of the anarchist movement and the First International as a valid means to be used in class struggle. The predictable state responses to these actions were supposed to display to the people the inherently repressive nature of the bourgeois state, delegitimizing it (legitimacy being key). This would in turn bolster the revolutionary spirit of the people, leading to the overthrow of the state. This is the basic formula of the cycle protests-repression- protests, which in specific conditions may lead to an effective state of insurrection. This cycle has been observed during the 1905 Russian Revolution or in Paris in May 1968. However, it failed to achieve its revolutionary objective on the vast majority of occasions, thus leading to the abandonment by the vast majority of the anarchist movement of such bombings. However, the state never failed in its repressive response, enforcing various lois sc√©l√©rates which usually involved tough clampdowns on the whole of the labor movement. These harsh laws, sometimes accompanied by the proclamation of the state of exception, progressively led to increased criticism among the anarchist movement of assassinations. The role of several agents provocateurs and the use of deliberate strategies of tension by governments, using such false flag terrorist actions as the Spanish La Mano Negra, work to discredit this violent tactic in the eyes of most socialist libertarians. John Filiss and Jim Bell are two of the best known modern advocates, with the latter developing the concept of an assassination marketa market system for anonymously hiring and compensating political assassination.

Justifications The United Nations Security Council, acting under Chapter VII of the UN CharterActing under Chapter VII means the Council is speaking with its mandatory authority in matters of world security to set the world's policy around this issue. (Comparable to the Pope speaking ex cathedra.) defined the term \\"terrorism\\" as consisting of \\"Criminal acts, including against civilians, committed with the intent to cause death or serious bodily injury, or taking of hostages, with the purpose to provoke a state of terror in the general public or in a group of persons or particular persons, intimidate a population or compel a government or an international organization to do or to abstain from doing any act.\\" The use of political violence is understood by its proponents in the frame of a general conception of the state as the control apparatus of the bourgeoisie, and of class struggle as a form of effective civil war. Thus, as anarchists often put it, \\"peace without justice isn't peace\\", but war between exploited and exploiters. In their eyes, this \\"social war\\" morally legitimizes the use of violence against broader \\"social violence.\\" This view, of course, is not shared by pacifist libertarians. Rioting is thus justified as a means to enhance class consciousness and prepares the objective conditions for a popular uprising (Georges Sorel, 1906). Even those who are not opposed to the political use of violence for theoretical reasons (as pacifist anarchists are) may consider it unnecessary or strategically dangerous, in certain conditions. Many note that the events of 1970s showed clearly how terrorism may be used to influence politics in the frame of the \\"strategy of tension\\" by a state and its secret services, through agents provocateurs and false flag terrorist attacks. In Italy and other countries, the Years of lead led to reinforced anti-terrorism legislation, criticized by social activists as a new form of lois sc√©l√©rates which were used to repress the whole of the socialist movement, not just militant groups. Many also note that the rare cases in which terrorism has achieved its revolutionary aims are mostly in the context of national liberation struggles, while the urban guerrilla movements have all failed (G√©rard Chaliand). Armed propaganda Armed propaganda is a type of propaganda used by revolutionary organizations that uses destructive, but ideally not lethal violence to make a political point known to the public and eventually gain supporters for its cause. The term was used in the United States by the Weather Underground and the Black Panther Party to describe some of their bombings. Although armed propaganda can use guns or bombs, its proponents argue that its goal is debatably different from that of pure terrorism. =United States= Dan Berger, in his book about the Weatherman organization, Outlaws in America, describes the planning section for a townhouse bombing by the group, describing the action as \\"armed propaganda\\".Berger, Dan, Outlaws of America: The Weather Underground and the Politics of Solidarity, AK Press: Oakland, California, 2006, p. 144; =Latin America= The term has been applied to guerillas in Latin America in their revolutionary literature. =Iran= Bizhan Jazani used a translation of the term to describe armed struggle in Iran, particularly the Fadai guerrillas.

These speculative capital flows are called \\"hot money\\" because they can move very quickly in and out of markets, potentially leading to market instability.CRS Report for Congress, July 21, 2008: China‚Äôs \\"Hot Money\\" Problems, by Micheal F. Martin and Wayne M. Morrison Illustration of hot money flows The following simple example illustrates the phenomenon of hot money: In the beginning of 2011, the national average rate of one year certificate of deposit in the United States is 0.95%. In contrast, China's benchmark one year deposit rate is 3%. The Chinese currency (renminbi) is seriously undervalued against the world's major trading currencies and therefore is likely to appreciate against the US dollar in the coming years. Given this situation, if an investor in the US deposits his or her money in a Chinese bank, the investor would get a higher return than if he or she deposits money in a US bank. This makes China a prime target for hot money inflows. This is just an example for illustration. In reality, hot money takes many different forms of investment. The following description may help further illustrate this phenomenon: \\"One country or sector in the world economy experiences a financial crisis; capital flows out in a panic; investors seek a more attractive destination for their money. In the next destination, capital inflows create a boom that is accompanied by rising indebtedness, rising asset prices and booming consumption - for a time. But all too often, these capital inflows are followed by another crisis. Some commentators describe these patterns of capital flow as 'hot money' that flows from one sector or country to the next and leaves behind a trail of destruction.\\"Hot Money and Serial Financial Crises, Anton Korinek, IMF Economic Review (2011) Types of hot money As mentioned above, capital in the following form could be considered hot money: * Short-term foreign portfolio investments, including investments in equities, bonds and financial derivatives * Short-term foreign bank loans * Foreign bank loans with short term investment horizon The types of capital in the above categories share common characteristics: the investment horizon is short, and they can come in quickly and leave quickly.  Estimates of total value  There is no well- defined method for estimating the amount of hot money flowing into a country during a period of time, because hot money flows quickly and is poorly monitored. In addition, once an estimate is made, the amount of hot money may suddenly rise or fall, depending on the economic conditions driving the flow of funds. One common way of approximating the flow of hot money is to subtract a nation‚Äôs trade surplus (or deficit) and its net flow of foreign direct investment (FDI) from the change in the nation's foreign reserves. Hot money (approx) = Change in foreign exchange reserves - Net exports - Net foreign direct investment  Sources and causes  Hot money usually originates from the capital-rich, developed countries that have lower GDP growth rate and lower interest rates compared to the GDP growth rate and interest rate of emerging market economies such as India, Brazil, China, Turkey, Malaysia etc. Although the specific causes of hot money flow are somewhat different from period to period, generally, the following could be considered as the causes of hot money flow:\\"Inflows of Capital to Developing Countries in the 1990s\\", by Calvo, Leiderman, Reinhart, Journal of Economic Perspective 1996 * a sustained decline of interest rates in the highly industrialized, developed countries. The lower interest rates in the developed nations attract investors to the high investment yields and improving economic prospects in Asia and Latin America. * a general trend towards international diversification of investments in major financial centers and towards growing integration of world capital markets. * Emerging market countries began to adopt sound monetary and fiscal policies as well as market-oriented reforms including trade and capital market liberalization. Such policy reforms, among others, have resulted in a credible increase in the rate of return on investments. As described above, hot money can be in different forms. Hedge funds, other portfolio investment funds and international borrowing of domestic financial institutions are generally considered as the vehicles of hot money. In the 1997 East Asian Financial Crisis and in the 1998 Russian Financial Crisis, the hot money chiefly came from banks, not portfolio investors.Hot Money, by Martin N.Baily, Diana Farrell, and Susan Lund, May 2000, McKinsey Quarterly  Impact Capital flows can increase welfare by enabling households to smooth out their consumption over time and achieve a higher level of consumption. Capital flows can help developed countries achieve a better international diversification of their portfolios. However, large and sudden inflows of capital with a short term investment horizon have negative macroeconomic effects, including rapid monetary expansion, inflationary pressures, real exchange rate appreciation and widening current account deficits. Especially, when capital flows in volume into small and shallow local financial markets, the exchange rate tends to appreciate, asset prices rally and local commodity prices boom. These favorable asset price movements improve national fiscal indicators and encourage domestic credit expansion. These, in turn, exacerbate structural weakness in the domestic bank sector. When global investors' sentiment on emerging markets shift, the flows reverse and asset prices give back their gains, often forcing a painful adjustment on the economy.Capital Flow Bonanzas: An Encompassing View of the Past and Present, by Carmen M. Reinhart and Vincent R. Reinhart, NBER Working Paper No. 14321, September 2008 The following are the details of the dangers that hot money presents to the receiving country's economy: * Inflow of massive capital with short investment horizon (hot money) could cause asset prices to rally and inflation to rise. The sudden inflow of large amounts of foreign money would increase the monetary base of the receiving country (if the central bank is pegging the currency), which would help create a credit boom. This, in turn, would result in such a situation in which \\"too much money chases too few goods\\". The consequences of this would be inflation. Furthermore, hot money could lead to exchange rate appreciation or even cause exchange rate overshooting. And if this exchange rate appreciation persists, it would hurt the competitiveness of the respective country's export sector by making the country's exports more expensive compared to similar foreign goods and services.Ricardo J. Caballero, Guido Lorenzoni, 2007. Persistent Appreciation and Overshooting: A Normative Analysis. (MIT and NBER) * Sudden outflow of hot money, which would always certainly happen, would deflate asset prices and could cause the collapse value of the currency of respective country. This is especially so in countries with relatively scarce internationally liquid assets. There is growing agreement that this was the case in the 1997 East Asian Financial Crisis. In the run-up to the crises, firms and private firms in South Korea, Thailand and Indonesia accumulated large amounts of short-term foreign debt (a type of hot money). The three countries shared a common characteristic of having large ratio of short term foreign debt to international reserves. When the capital started to flow out, it caused a collapse in asset prices and exchange rates. The financial panic fed on itself, causing foreign creditors to call in loans and depositors to withdraw funds from banks. All of these magnified the illiquidity of the domestic financial system and forced yet another round of costly asset liquidations and price deflation. In all of the three countries, the domestic financial institutions came to the brink of default on their external short term obligations.Short Term Capital Flows, by Dani Rodrik, Andres Velasco, 1999 NBER However, some economists and financial experts argue that hot money could also play positive role in countries that have relatively low level of foreign exchange reserves, because the capital inflow may present a useful opportunity for those countries to augment their central banks' reserve holdings.Capital Inflows: The Role of Controls, IMF Staff Position Note, February 19, 2010  Control  Generally speaking, given their relatively high interest rates compared with that of the developed market economies, emerging market economies are the destination of hot money. Although the emerging market countries welcome capital inflows such as foreign direct investment, because of hot money's negative effects on the economy, they are instituting policies to stop hot money from coming into their country in order to eliminate the negative consequences. Different countries are using different methods to prevent massive influx of hot money. The following are the main methods of dealing with hot money. * Exchange rate appreciation: the exchange rate can be used as a tool to control the inflow of hot money. If the currency is believed to be undervalued, that would be a cause of hot money inflow. In such circumstance, economists usually suggest a significant one-off appreciation rather than a gradual move in the exchange rate, as a gradual appreciation of the exchange rate would attract even more hot money into the country. One downside of this approach is that exchange rate appreciation would reduce the competitiveness of the export sector. * Interest rate reduction: countries that adopt this policy would lower their central bank's benchmark interest rates to reduce the incentive for inflow. For example, on December 16, 2010, the Turkish Central Bank surprised markets by cutting interest rates at a time of rising inflation and relatively high economic growth. Erdem Basci, deputy bank governor of Turkish Central Bank argued that gradual rate cuts were the best way to prevent excessive capital inflows fuelling asset bubbles and currency appreciation.Turkey surprises with interest rate cut, by Delphine Strauss, Financial Times, December 16, 2010 On February 14, 2011, Mehmet Simsek, the Turkish Finance Minister said: ‚Äúmore than $8 billion in short-term investment had exited the country after the central bank cut rates and took steps to slow credit growth. The markets have got the message that Turkey does not want hot money inflows‚ÄùSimsek Says $8 Billion ‚ÄòHot Money‚Äô Left Turkey, by Steve Bryant, Bloomberg News, Feb 14, 2011 * Capital controls: some capital control policies adopted by China belong to this category. For example, in China, the government does not allow foreign funds to invest directly in its capital market. Also, the central bank of China sets quotas for its domestic financial institutions for the use of short-term foreign debt and prevent banks from overusing their quotas.China enhances efforts to curb hot money inflow, China Daily, November 09, 2011 In June 1991, the Chilean government instituted a non-remunerated (non-paid) 20 percent reserve requirement to be deposited at the Central Bank for a period of one year for liabilities in foreign currency, for firms which are borrowing directly in foreign currency.Controls on Short-Term Capital Inflows - The Latin American Experience and Lessons For DMCs, by Pradumna B. Rana. Asian Development Bank, Economics and Development Resource Center Briefing Notes, 1998 * Increasing bank reserve requirements and sterilization: some countries pursue a fixed exchange rate policy. In the face of large net capital inflow, those countries would intervene in the foreign exchange market to prevent exchange rate appreciation. Then sterilize the monetary impact of intervention through open market operations and through increasing bank reserves requirements.Capital Inflows: Macroeconomic Implications and Policy Responses, by Roberto Cardarelli, Selim Elekdag, M. Ayhan Kose, IMF Working Paper, March 2009 For example, when hot money originated from the U.S. enters China, investors would sell US dollars and buy Chinese yuan in the foreign exchange market. This would put upward pressure on the value of the yuan. In order to prevent the appreciation of the Chinese currency, the central bank of China print yuan to buy US dollars. This would increase money supply in China, which would in turn cause inflation. Then, the central bank of China has to increase bank reserve requirements or issue Chinese government bonds to bring back the money that it has previously released into the market in the exchange rate intervention operation. However, like other approaches, this approach has limitations. The first, the central bank can't keep increasing bank reserves, because doing so would negatively affect bank's profitability. The second, in the emerging market economies, the domestic financial market is not deep enough for open market operations to be effective. * Fiscal tightening: the idea is to use fiscal restraint, especially in the form of spending cuts on nontradables, so as to lower aggregate demand and curb the inflationary impact of capital inflow.Capital Flows in the APEC Region (book), edited by Mohsin S.

Between 1942 and 1947 he acted as reviewer of mostly mystery fiction for the San Francisco Chronicle. In addition to \\"Anthony Boucher\\", White also employed the pseudonym \\"H. H. Holmes\\", which was the pseudonym of a late-19th-century American serial killer; Boucher would also write light verse and sign it \\"Herman W. Mudgett\\" (another of the murderer's aliases). In a 1981 poll of 17 detective story writers and reviewers, his novel Nine Times Nine was voted as the ninth best locked room mystery of all time. Background White was born in Oakland, California, and went to college at the University of Southern California. He later received a master's degree from the University of California, Berkeley. After a friend told him that \\"William White\\" was too common a name, he used \\"H. H. Holmes\\" to write and review mysteries and \\"Anthony Boucher\\" for science fiction. He pronounced Boucher phonetically, \\"to rhyme with voucher\\".  Fiction writing and editing  Boucher (as he was more commonly known) wrote mystery, science fiction, and horror. He was also an editor, including science fiction anthologies, and wrote mystery reviews for many years in The New York Times. He was one of the first English translators of Jorge Luis Borges, translating \\"The Garden of Forking Paths\\" for Ellery Queen's Mystery Magazine. He helped found the Mystery Writers of America in 1946 and, in the same year, was one of the first winners of the MWA's Edgar Award for his mystery reviews in the San Francisco Chronicle. He was a founding editor (with J. Francis McComas) of The Magazine of Fantasy & Science Fiction from 1949 to 1958, and attempted to make literary quality an important aspect of science fiction. He won the Hugo Award for Best Professional Magazine in 1957 and 1958. Boucher also edited the long-running Best from Fantasy and Science Fiction anthology series, from 1952 to 1959. Among Boucher's critical writing was also contributing annual summaries of the state of speculative fiction for Judith Merril's The Year's Best SF series; as editor, he published the volumes in E. P. Dutton's The Best Detective Stories of the Year annual volumes published in 1963‚Äì1968, succeeding Brett Halliday and followed, after his death, by Allen J. Hubin in that task. Boucher's first short story saw print when he was fifteen years old in the January 1927 issue of Weird Tales. Titled \\"Ye Goode Olde Ghoste Storie,\\" it was the only story to appear under his real name, William A. P. White. Boucher went on to write short stories for many pulp fiction magazines in America, including Adventure, Astounding, Black Mask, Ed McBain's Mystery Book, Ellery Queen's Mystery Magazine, Galaxy Science Fiction, The Master Detective, Unknown Worlds and Weird Tales. His short story \\"The Quest for Saint Aquin\\" was among the stories selected in 1970 by the Science Fiction Writers of America as one of the best science fiction short stories of all time. As such, it was published in The Science Fiction Hall of Fame, Volume One, 1929‚Äì1964. Boucher was the friend and mentor of science-fiction writer Philip K. Dick and others. His 1942 novel Rocket to the Morgue, in addition to being a classic locked room mystery, is also something of a roman √† clef about the Southern California science fiction culture of the time, featuring thinly veiled versions of personalities such as Robert A. Heinlein, L. Ron Hubbard and rocket scientist/occultist/fan Jack Parsons. Radio Boucher also scripted for radio and was involved in many other activities, as described by William F. Nolan in his essay \\"Who Was Anthony Boucher?\\": With respect to his scripting of the Sherlock Holmes radio dramas, Nigel Bruce, who played Dr. Watson, said that Boucher \\"had a sound knowledge of Conan Doyle and a great affection for the two characters of Holmes and Watson.\\"  Magazine of Fantasy and Science Fiction years  Boucher left dramatic radio in 1948, \\"mainly because I was putting in a lot of hours working with J. Francis McComas in creating what soon became The Magazine of Fantasy and Science Fiction. We got it off the ground in 1949 and saw it take hold solidly by 1950. This was a major creative challenge and although I was involved in a lot of other projects, I stayed with F&SF; into 1958.\\" Throughout his years with the magazine, Boucher was involved in many other projects. He wrote fiction for the SF and mystery markets (primarily short stories). He taught an informal writing class from his home in Berkeley. He continued his Sunday mystery columns for the New York Times Book Review, while also writing crime-fiction reviews for The New York Herald Tribune as Holmes (he also reviewed SF and fantasy (as H. H. Holmes) for the Herald Tribune) and functioning as chief critic for Ellery Queen's Mystery Magazine. He edited True Crime Detective, supervised the Mercury Mystery Line and (later) the Dell Great Mystery Library; hosted Golden Voices, his series of historical opera recordings for Pacifica Radio, and served (in 1951) as president of Mystery Writers of America. As part of his reviews of mystery novels, he published a list of Best Crime Fiction of the Year from 1949 to 1967, listing from 12 to 15 titles each year. He published his list as Anthony Boucher. Boucher was a devoted poker player, a political activist, a rabid sport fan (football, basketball, track, gymnastics and rugby), an active Sherlockian in The Baker Street Irregulars and a spirited chef. Television In the years 1964-65 Boucher worked as a story consultant for the Kraft Suspense Theatre.Anthony Boucher, imdb.com. Retrieved on October 15, 2018.

Overview The award was established on April 16, 1934, by the Central Executive Committee of the Soviet Union. The first recipients of the title originally received only the Order of Lenin, the highest Soviet award, along with a certificate (–≥—Ä–∞–º–æ—Ç–∞, gramota) describing the heroic deed from the Presidium of the Supreme Soviet of the USSR. Because the Order of Lenin could be awarded for deeds not qualifying for the title of hero, and to distinguish heroes from other Order of Lenin holders, the Gold Star medal was introduced on August 1, 1939. Earlier heroes were retroactively eligible for these items. A hero could be awarded the title again for a subsequent heroic feat with an additional Gold Star medal and certificate. An additional Order of Lenin was not given until 1973. The practice of awarding the title multiple times was abolished by the Supreme Soviet of the USSR in 1988 during perestroika. Forty-four foreign citizens were awarded the title. The title was also given posthumously, though often without the actual Gold Star medal given. The title could be revoked only by the Presidium of the Supreme Soviet.McDaniel and Schmitt, The Comprehensive Guide to Soviet Orders and Medals. =Privileges= Individuals who received the award were entitled to special privileges, including: * A pension with survivor benefits in the event of the death of the title holder. * First priority on the housing list with 50% rent reduction, tax exempt and an additional in living space. * Annual round-trip first class airline ticket * Free bus transportation * Free annual visit to sanatorium or rest home * Medical benefits *Entertainment benefits History Marshal Georgy Zhukov (center) wearing three Hero of the Soviet Union medals and Marshal Konstantin Rokossovsky (right) wearing two In total, during the existence of the USSR, the title of Hero of the Soviet Union was awarded to 12,777 people (excluding 72 stripped of the title for defamatory acts and 13 awards annulled as unwarranted), including twice ‚Äì 154 (9 posthumously), three times ‚Äì 3 and four ‚Äì 2. Ninety-five women were awarded the title. Among the Heroes of the Soviet Union, 44 people are citizens of foreign states. The great majority of them received it during World War II (11,635 Heroes of the Soviet Union, 101 twice Heroes, three thrice Heroes, and two four-time Heroes). Eighty-five people (28 posthumously) were awarded the title for actions related to the Soviet-Afghan War, which lasted from 1979 until 1989. The first recipients of the award were the pilots Anatoly Liapidevsky (certificate number one), Sigizmund Levanevsky, Vasily Molokov, Mavriky Slepnyov, Nikolai Kamanin, Ivan Doronin, and Mikhail Vodopianov, who participated in the successful aerial search and rescue of the crew of the steamship Cheliuskin, which sank in Arctic waters, crushed by ice fields, on February 13, 1934. Valentina Grizodubova, a female pilot, was the first woman to become a Hero of the Soviet Union (November 2, 1938) –ì—Ä–∏–∑–æ–¥—É–±–æ–≤–∞ –í–∞–ª–µ–Ω—Ç–∏–Ω–∞ –°—Ç–µ–ø–∞–Ω–æ–≤–Ω–∞ for her international women's record for a straight-line distance flight. Zoya Kosmodemyanskaya, a Soviet partisan, was the first woman to become a Hero of the Soviet Union during World War II (February 16, 1942), posthumously. In addition, 101 people received the award twice. A second Hero title, either Hero of the Soviet Union or Hero of Socialist Labour entitled the recipient to have a bronze bust of his or her likeness with a commemorative inscription erected in his or her hometown.https://ru.wikisource.org/wiki/%D0%9F%D0%BE%D1%81%D1%82%D0%B0%D0%BD%D0%BE%D0%B2%D0%BB%D0%B5%D0%BD%D0%B8%D0%B5_%D0%A6%D0%98%D0%9A_%D0%A1%D0%A1%D0%A1%D0%A0_%D0%BE%D1%82_16.05.1934_%D0%93%D0%B5%D1%80%D0%BE%D0%B9_%D0%A1%D0%A1%D0%A1%D0%A0 Two famous Soviet fighter pilots, Aleksandr Pokryshkin and Ivan Kozhedub were three times Heroes of the Soviet Union. A third award entitled the recipient to have his/her bronze bust erected on a columnar pedestal in Moscow, near the Palace of the Soviets, but the Palace was never built. After his release from serving a 20-year sentence in a Mexican prison for the assassination of Leon Trotsky, Ram√≥n Mercader moved to the Soviet Union in 1961 and was awarded the Hero of the Soviet Union medal from KGB head Alexander Shelepin. The only individuals to receive the title four times were Marshal Georgy Zhukov and Leonid Brezhnev. The original statute of the Hero of the Soviet Union, however, did not provide for a fourth title; its provisions allowed for a maximum of three awards regardless of later deeds. Both Zhukov and Brezhnev received their fourth titles under controversial circumstances contrary to the statute, which remained largely unchanged until the award was abolished in 1991. Zhukov was awarded a fourth time \\"for his large accomplishments\\" on the occasion of his 60th birthday on December 1, 1956. There is some speculation that Zhukov's fourth Hero medal was for his participation in the arrest of Beria in 1953, but this was not entered in the records. Brezhnev's four awards further eroded the prestige of the award because they were all birthday gifts, on the occasions of his 60th, 70th, 72nd and 75th birthdays. Such practices halted in 1988 due to a decision of the Supreme Soviet of the USSR, which formally ended it. By the 1970s, the award had been somewhat devalued. Important political and military persons had been awarded it on the occasions of their anniversaries rather than for any immediate heroic activity. All Soviet cosmonauts, starting from Yuri Gagarin, as well as foreign citizens who participated in the Soviet space program as cosmonauts, received Hero award for each flight (but no more than twice). Apart from individuals, the title was also awarded to twelve cities (Hero City) as well as the fortress of Brest (Hero-Fortress) for collective heroism during the War. The last recipient of the title \\"Hero of the Soviet Union\\" was a Soviet diver, Captain of the 3rd rank Leonid Mikhailovich Solodkov on December 24, 1991 for his leadership and participation in a series of unprecedented extreme depth diving experiments. Following the collapse of the Soviet Union, this title was succeeded in Russia by the title \\"Hero of the Russian Federation\\", in Ukraine by \\"Hero of Ukraine\\" and in Belarus by \\"Hero of Belarus\\". Azerbaijan's successor order is that of National Hero of Azerbaijan and Armenia's own hero medal is that of National Hero of Armenia, both modeled on the Soviet one.

During the 1950s and 1960s, he contributed novelettes and short stories to various digest size science fiction magazines, sometimes writing under the pseudonym Louis G. Daniels. Born in New Orleans, Galouye (pronounced Gah-lou-ey) graduated from Louisiana State University (B.A.) and then worked as a reporter for several newspapers. During World War II, he served in the US Navy as an instructor and test pilot, receiving injuries that led to later health problems. On December 26, 1945, he married Carmel Barbara Jordan. From the 1940s until his retirement in 1967, he was on the staff of The States-Item. He lived in New Orleans but also had a summer home across Lake Ponchartrain at St. Tammany Parish in Covington, Louisiana. Novels and stories Imagination Galouye's novella \\"The Fist of Shiva\\" took the cover of the May 1953 issue of Imagination Imagination Imagination Imagination Galouye's novelette \\"Project Barrier\\" was the cover story for the January 1958 issue of Fantastic Universe Fantastic Galouye's first published fiction, the novelette Rebirth, appeared in the March 1952 issue of Imagination. His work appeared in many magazines during this era including Galaxy Science Fiction and The Magazine of Fantasy & Science Fiction. Between 1961 and 1973, Galouye wrote five novels, notably Simulacron Three, basis of the movie The Thirteenth Floor (1999) and the German TV miniseries World on a Wire (1973) (directed by Rainer Werner Fassbinder). His first novel, Dark Universe (1961) was nominated for a Hugo. According to his obituary in the New Orleans States-Item, Galouye... :... was a Navy pilot during WWII from 1942 to 1946. He graduated from Pensacola Naval Air School, held the rank of lieutenant and was for a time during his service years in charge of a training school in Hawaii for Navy airmen. Immediately after release from the Navy, he began his career with The States-Item as a reporter, then as a copy editor and joined the editorial department in 1956. He later was named associate editor of that department, retiring in 1967. He is survived by his widow, Mrs. Carmel Barbara Jordan Galouye; two daughters, Mrs. Gerald Johan Zomerdijk of Zaandam, the Netherlands, and Mrs. Joseph Edward Ingraham of Covington; and five grandchildren.Dufour, Pie. \\"D.

The Nanchang Uprising (; ) was the first major Nationalist Party of China‚ÄìCommunist Party of China engagement of the Chinese Civil War, begun by the Chinese Communists to counter the Shanghai massacre of 1927 by the Kuomintang. The Kuomintang (KMT, or Nationalist Party) established a \\"Revolutionary Committee\\" at Nanchang to plant the spark that was expected to ignite a widespread peasant uprising. Deng Yanda, Song Qingling (Soong Ching-ling, Madame Sun Yat-sen) and Zhang Fakui (who later crushed the uprising) were among the political leaders.Schwartz, Benjamin, Chinese Communism and the Rise of Mao, Harper & Row (New York: 1951), p. 93. Military forces in Nanchang under the leadership of He Long and Zhou Enlai rebelled in an attempt to seize control of the city after the end of the first Kuomintang-Communist alliance. Other important leaders in this event were Zhu De, Ye Ting, and Liu Bocheng. Communist forces successfully occupied Nanchang and escaped from the siege of Kuomintang forces by 5 August, withdrawing to the Jinggang Mountains of western Jiangxi. 1 August was later regarded as the anniversary of the founding of the People's Liberation Army and the first action fought against the Kuomintang and the National Revolutionary Army.  Names  In Chinese, apart from the name shown above, the event is known as 1 August Nanchang Uprising (), 1 August Uprising (), Nanchang Rebellion (), Nanchang Insurrection (), or Nanchang Mutiny (). The Government of the People's Republic of China and the Communist Party of China refer this as the Nanchang Uprising, while the Government of the Republic of China and the Chinese Nationalist Party refer this as the Nanchang Rebellion.  Order of battle  = Communist forces = Zhou Enlai Communist forces at their peak during the Nanchang Uprising totaled over 20,000, though some of them did not join the battle until a day later. The entire Communist force was organized into the 2nd Front Army, and over half of it was under He Long's command. He was also named Commander-in-Chief of the 2nd Front Army, and Ye Ting as deputy Commander-in-Chief and acting front-line Commander-in-Chief. Communist representative was Zhou Enlai, chief of staff was Liu Bocheng and Director of the Political Directorate of the 2nd Front Army was Guo Moruo. The following is the order of battle for the Communist forces: * 9th Army commanded by Zhou Enlai, with Zhu De as the deputy commander and Zhu Kejing (Êú±ÂÖãÈùñ) as the Communist Party representative. * 11th Army commanded by Ye Ting, with Cai Tingkai as the deputy commander and Nie Rongzhen as the party representative. ** 10th Division commanded by Cai Tingkai (Ëî°Âª∑Èî¥) ** 24th Division commanded by Gu Xunming/Dong Zhongming (Âè§ÂããÈì≠/Ëë£‰ª≤Êòé) ** 25th Division commanded by Li Hanhun (ÊùéÊ±âÈ≠Ç), and after taking Nanchang by Zhou Shidi (Âë®Â£´Á¨¨) * 20th Army commanded by He Long and Liao Qianwu (Âªñ‰πæÂêæ) as the communist representative ** 1st Division commanded by He Jinzhai (Ë¥∫Èî¶Êñã) ** 2nd Division commanded by Qing Guangyuan (Áß¶ÂÖâËøú) ** 3rd Division commanded by Zhou Yiqun (Âë®ÈÄ∏Áæ§)  Battle at Nanchang  The rebellion was initially planned to take place during the night of July 30, but due to complications with Zhang Guotao it was postponed until the next day. On the morning of 1 August 1927, at exactly 2:00 a.m., Zhou Enlai, He Long, Nie Rongzhen, Ye Ting, Ye Jianying, Lin Biao, Zhu De, Chen Yi and Liu Bocheng led their troops and attacked the city of Nanchang from different directions. Four hours later they took the city, capturing 5,000 small arms and around 1,000,000 rounds of ammunition. Around noon the Revolutionary Committee of the Chinese Nationalist Party (‰∏≠ÂúãÂúãÊ∞ëÈª®Èù©ÂëΩÂßîÂì°ÊúÉ) was established (not to be confused with the Revolutionary Committee of the Kuomintang which was founded in 1948). The committee has 25 members: Deng Yanda (ÈÇìÊºîËææ), Zhang Fakui (Âº†ÂèëÂ•é), Tan Pingshan (Ë∞≠Âπ≥Â±±), Chen Youren (ÈôàÂèã‰ªÅ), Wu YuZhang (Âê¥ÁéâÁ´†), Peng Zemin (ÂΩ≠Ê≥ΩÊ∞ë), Lin Zuhan (ÊûóÁ•ñÊ∂µ), He Long (Ë¥∫Èæô), Guo Moruo (ÈÉ≠Ê≤´Ëã•), Huang Qixiang (ÈªÑÁê™Áøî), Yun Daiying (ÊÅΩ‰ª£Ëã±), Jiang Hao (Ê±üÊµ©), Zhu Huiri (Êú±ÊôñÊó•), Zhou Enlai (Âë®ÊÅ©Êù•), Zhang Guotao (Âº†ÂõΩÁÑò), Ye Ting (Âè∂Êå∫), Zhang Shushi (Âº†ÊõôÊó∂), Li Lisan (ÊùéÁ´ã‰∏â), Xu Teli (ÂæêÁâπÁ´ã), Peng Pai (ÂΩ≠ÊπÉ), Su Zhaozheng (ËãèÂÖÜÂæÅ), Song Qingling (ÂÆãÂ∫ÜÈæÑ), He Xianning (‰ΩïÈ¶ôÂáù), Yu Youren (‰∫éÂè≥‰ªª) and Jing Hengyi (Áªè‰∫®È¢ê).  Retreat  Facing a counterattack from the Nationalists, the Communists decided to retreat south towards the province of Guangdong. Once there they would try to take over the city of Guangzhou while spreading their influence to the peasants and farms in that area. Location of Nanchang in China = Disaster Foretold = Guangzhou was the target set by the Soviet Comintern and, on August 3, Communist troops pulled out of Nanchang. Their Little Long March came to an end at the beginning of October, as they came down out of the Hakka uplands and into the Chaoshan area. In Chaozhou they were defeated by Nationalist-affiliated troops. Communist forces were broken up and traveled in two general directions, one heading to Shanwei where they engaged the Nationalists in guerrilla warfare, and the other to southern Hunan, where they eventually joined a force under Mao Zedong, whose abortive Autumn Harvest Uprising had been no more successful. The Communist forces had suffered such a decisive and disastrous defeat that only 1,000 soldiers remained as a complete unit, reforming into a regiment. Under the command of Zhu De and Chen Yi, who had faked their names, the regiment went to a local Hunan warlord and sought refuge. From this humble beginning the force eventually grew to 10,000 strong, traveling to Jiangxi and joining Mao Zedong at Jinggangshan in April 1928. Liu Bocheng became a fugitive but was lucky enough to find other Communists who helped him and eventually sent him to the Soviet Union for military training, while Lin Biao deserted after the defeat. However, he had to return to the Communist force because of his fear that locals hostile to his side would turn him over to his enemies or kill him. Guo Moruo fled to Japan after the defeat. Other surviving members were much less fortunate; all became fugitives. Zhou Enlai, Ye Jianying and Ye Ting lost contact with the others and fled to Hong Kong, with Zhou seriously ill. The three had two pistols with them and were successful in reaching Hong Kong. Nie Rongzhen, the other communist leader, also successfully escaped to Hong Kong. = He Long = He Long had strongly opposed the retreat plan, accurately pointing out that marching 1000 miles in the heat of summer would put a severe strain on the troops, and that popular support for the Communists in Guangdong was merely a fraction of the huge support they had among the peasantry in Hunan. His opinion was that the new Communist base should be established in the border region of Hunan, suggesting that in Hunan the Communist troops would be easily resupplied and their numbers increased by the enlistment of the local populace. However, his suggestion was vetoed. He Long went home alone after the defeat. Demoted from his position as an army commander in charge of tens of thousands of men to that of a beggar, he was not well received by his family except for a few who were already Communists. He would soon raise another force of Communist soldiers, this time more than 3000 strong, but it would be wiped out by the Nationalists, with less than three dozen members surviving. It would take a year for He Long's force to recover for the third time.

Biography Born and raised in Southern New Jersey, Roger Elwood started his professional writing career shortly after graduating from high school. Elwood edited two wrestling magazines, The Big Book of Wrestling and Official Wrestling Guide, on a contract basis in 1971-72 for Jalart House, an Arizona publisher, and regularly photographed matches (wrestling magazines placed a premium on photos rather than text). He became a regular with locker room access at some shows on the East Coast, which might seem to contradict rumours that he had become disillusioned with wrestling when it came to his attention that some pro wrestling matches were fixed. This period produced some fictional confessional stories (e.g. \\"I Killed a Man in the Ring\\") that Elwood claimed were based on \\"a blending of interviews\\". He abruptly left the job in between late 1972 and early 1973, telling writers the wrestling magazines were too much work for too little compensation. Elwood was published by four different publishers in the first six years as an SF anthologist. During the following few years he would contract with over a dozen other publishers to produce many dozens of individual books and two anthology series, the four- book Continuum and two-book Frontiers. The Encyclopedia of Science Fiction observes that \\"At one time it was estimated that Roger Elwood alone constituted about one quarter of the total market for SF short stories.\\" Around the time the SF anthology market was bottoming out, Elwood moved on to Laser Books, an ultimately unsuccessful attempt by romance publishing giant Harlequin Books to systematize and regularize SF into a uniform series of novels by diverse authors. He then effectively left the mainline science fiction/fantasy field in the late 1970s. Elwood's biography on the Fantastic Fiction website omits all mention of his work in the mainline science fiction/fantasy field and identifies him as a Writer-in-Residence (or occasionally a \\"professor of literature\\") at a Bible college in the mid-west. The biography also claims that \\"12 of his novels have won Excellence in Media awards for best book of the year\\", although the Silver Angels award website includes only a general \\"Print\\" category, and does not list Elwood's name.Angel Awards website ; search for Elwood's name. In the 1990s, Elwood became a prolific writer of Christian-based novels, with more than thirty novels published throughout that decade. Criticisms Elwood's significant presence in the genre anthology field in the mid 1970s is not without its detractors, whose criticisms range from professional to ad hominem; James Nicoll has noted that Elwood's \\"capacity to produce anthologies at high speed was not, alas, matched with an ability to produce interesting anthologies\\", as well as the possibility that \\"readers, having read a few unremarkable Elwood anthologies, were reluctant to buy more\\".I Don't Know Where I'll Go: The Other Side of Tomorrow ‚Äî Roger Elwood, reviewed by James Nicoll, at James Nicoll Reviews; published August 21, 2018; retrieved August 30, 2018 A review of Elwood's 1976 anthology Six Science Fiction Plays in the Star Trek fan magazine Enterprise Incidents remarked that except for the inclusion of the original teleplay of the episode \\"The City on the Edge of Forever\\" by Harlan Ellison, the book was \\"another excursion into mediocrity by Roger Elwood\\". = Publishers = Publishing houses which published Roger Elwood's anthologies: * 1964: Paperback Library * 1965: Paperback Library * 1966: Holt, Rinehart and Winston * 1967: Tower * 1968: Tower * 1969: MacFadden-Bartell (3x) * 1970: MacFadden-Bartell * 1971: --- * 1972: Avon, Chilton, Fleming H.

She describes Elwood's theme anthologies as \\"carelessly edited\\" and \\"low-grade\\", although she allows that \\"some of Elwood's collections were quite decent,\\" and that \\"all of them featured some good writers and good stories.\\" The following are examples of peer recognition accorded to some of the stories printed in Elwood's anthologies (source: the Internet Speculative Fiction Database): * The short story \\"Forever and Amen\\" by Robert Bloch, from Elwood's 1972 anthology And Walk Now Gently Through the Fire and Other Science Fiction Stories was chosen by Forrest J. Ackerman for inclusion in his Best Science Fiction for 1973 compilation. * The 1973 anthology Future City included \\"The World as Will and Wallpaper\\" by R. A. Lafferty, which was reprinted by Terry Carr in The Best Science Fiction of the Year #3 (1974), \\"The Undercity\\" by Dean Koontz, which has been re-anthologized twice (in 1977 by Martin H. Greenberg and Joseph D. Olander in Criminal Justice Through Science Fiction, and in 1997 by Ric Alexander in Cyber- Killers), and \\"Getting Across\\" by Robert Silverberg which has also been re- anthologized twice (in 1986 by Greenberg et al. in Computer Crimes and Capers and in 1997 by Waugh and Greenberg in Sci-Fi Private Eye). The Future City anthology itself was reprinted in the United Kingdom by Sphere Books in 1976. * Robert Silverberg's \\"The Wind and the Rain\\", from Elwood's 1973 anthology Saving Worlds, was reprinted by Harry Harrison and Brian Aldiss in their Best SF: 1973 anthology. * \\"After King Kong Fell\\" by Philip Jos√© Farmer, from Elwood's 1973 anthology Omega, was nominated for a Nebula Award in 1974, and reprinted by Harrison and Aldiss in Best SF: 1974. * Elwood's 1973 anthology Showcase contains Silverberg's novelette Breckenridge and the Continuum, which was chosen by Terry Carr for The Best Science Fiction of the Year #3 (1974), as well as \\"The Childhood of the Human Hero\\" by Carol Emshwiller, which was included in Nebula Award Stories 9, edited by Kate Wilhelm. * Thomas F. Monteleone's short story \\"Breath's a Ware That Will Not Keep\\", from Elwood's 1975 anthology Dystopian Visions, was nominated for a Nebula award in 1976. * No less than twenty of the stories chosen by Barry N. Malzberg for inclusion in his collection The Best of Barry N. Malzberg (1976) were first published in one or other of Elwood's original anthologies. =Professionalism= Elwood is reported to have underpaid authors.Comment on Teresa Nielsen Haynden's blog Making Light Additionally, Teresa Nielsen Hayden discusses speculation about the financial details of some of Elwood's projects \\"that by all indications should have had generous budgets\\" but were \\"peculiarly long on authors who had slight or nonexistent publishing credentials outside of Roger Elwood projects.\\" Elwood's eight-volume young adult hardcover Lerner SF Library (1974), with three or four stories per volume, includes stories from three authors whose only recorded sale, according to the Internet Speculative Fiction Database, was to that book; two more authors who only ever sold stories to Roger Elwood; and one whose only first sale was to Roger Elwood, but who had the story picked up for republication elsewhere. SF hardcovers were relatively uncommon in the 1970s and the stories were supposedly original commissions, so Nielsen Hayden believes it is reasonable to assume that this was a well-funded project. Normally the entire advance for an anthology is paid out to the anthologist, who then purchases story rights out of his or her own pocket, retaining any unspent advance money. Given the availability of experienced short fiction writers at the time, Elwood's choice of inexperienced authors aroused suspicions. The Lerner SF Library also contains two stories by Earl and Otto Binder, and a third story by Otto alone. Given Earl and Otto Binder ceased to co-author stories in 1955, and that Earl died in 1965 and Otto in 1974, it seems unlikely any of these stories was a commissioned work. =Industry impact= Nielsen Hayden reports that, prior to Elwood's involvement in the market, anthologies and collections were very popular with readers, and were considered by the publishing industry to be \\"a surer bet than novels.\\" She goes on to accuse Elwood of \\"singlehandedly breaking the story collection/anthology market\\". By \\"wreck[ing] the readers' faith in collections\\" she says, Elwood \\"squandered industry credibility accumulated over decades by better anthologists\\". Anthologies and story collections, she suggests, became \\"a hard sell\\". Whether Elwood's impact has been a long-term one, as Nielsen Hayden maintains, is difficult to discern from the figures, which point to continuing high numbers of anthologies published annually.Roger Elwood and the Anthology Market and More on Elwood by Jonathan Strahan Bibliography =Short work= Elwood's Fantastic Fiction biography claims that he has sold \\"a thousand articles and a few short stories\\" to publications including Ladies Home Companion, Mike Shayne's Mystery Magazine, Edgar Wallace Mystery Magazine, Photoplay, Grit and Weekly Reader. = As Editor = =Anthologies= *Alien Worlds (1964) *Invasion of the Robots (1965) *The Time Curve (1968) (with Sam Moskowitz) *Alien Earth: And Other Stories (1969) *The Little Monsters (1969) (with Vic Ghidalia) *Other Worlds, Other Times (1969) (with Sam Moskowitz) *Horror Hunters (1971) (with Vic Ghidalia) *And Walk Now Gently Through the Fire: And Other Science Fiction Stories (1972) *Young Demons (1972) (with Vic Ghidalia) *Beware the Beasts (1973) (with Vic Ghidalia) *Demon Kind (1973) *Future Quest (1973) *Way Out (1973) *The Berserkers (1973) *Future City (1973) *The Other Side of Tomorrow (1973) *Monster Tales: Vampires Werewolves and Things (1973) *Children of Infinity: Original Science Fiction Stories for Young Readers (1973) *Androids, Time Machines, and Blue Giraffes: A Panorama of Science Fiction (1973) *Flame Tree Planet: And Other Stories (1973) *Saving Worlds (1973) (with Virginia Kidd) *Showcase (1973) *Ten Tomorrows (1973) *Omega (1974) *Crisis: Ten Original Stories of Science Fiction (1974) *Chronicles of a Comer: And Other Religious Science Fiction Stories (1974) *The Killer Plants: And Other Stories (1974) *Night of the Sphinx: and Other Stories (1974) *Strange Gods (1974) *Survival from Infinity: Original Science Fiction Stories for Young Readers (1974) *The Far Side of Time (1974) *Future Kin: Eight Science Fiction Stories (1974) *Horror Tales: Spirits, Spells and the Unknown (1974) *The Learning Maze: and Other Science Fiction (1974) *The Wounded Planet (1974) *Dystopian Visions (1975) *Future Corruption (1975) *The Gifts of Asti: And Other Stories of Science Fiction (1975) *Tomorrow: New Worlds of Science Fiction (1975) *Epoch (1975) *Six Science Fiction Plays (1975) *The Fifty-meter Monsters: And Other Horrors (1976) *Visions of Tomorrow (1976) *Futurelove (1977) *Science Fiction Tales (1978) *Spine- Chillers: Unforgettable Tales of Terror (1978) (with Howard Goldsmith) *More Science Fiction Tales (1978) Anthology series Frontiers: *Frontiers 1: Tomorrow's Alternatives (1973) *Frontiers 2: The New Mind (1973) Continuum: Each Continuum volume contained eight short stories: seven comprising four- episode series by the authors Anne McCaffrey, Poul Anderson, Philip Jos√© Farmer, Thomas N.

It is the fourth and final album in their ¬°Alarma! Chronicles album cycle and the first of three albums the band issued under the shortened moniker DA. Background Fearful Symmetry is a lush, synthesizer driven pop album, lyrically wrapped in puzzles that the listener has to decipher. Nearly every song on Fearful Symmetry in some way deals with pain or darkness - from the William Blake-inspired \\"Sleep Silent Child\\", a song about death, to \\"Strong Points, Weak Points\\", a song about doubt. The album title comes from a line in The Tyger by William Blake. The album ends on an upbeat note however, with the touching ballad, \\"Beautiful One\\". Fearful Symmetry was the final chapter of a four-part series of albums by DA entitled The ¬°Alarma! Chronicles, which also included the albums ¬°Alarma!, Doppelg√§nger, and Vox Humana. The band raised eyebrows on the tour that followed each release, by presenting a full multimedia event complete with video screens synchronized to the music, something that was unusual in the early 1980s for any band. This album, along with the other three albums from the Alarma! Chronicles, was re-released as part of the Alarma! Chronicles Book set in 2000. The Book Set included three CDs, over 200 pages of lyrics, photos, liner notes, essays, interviews and other information in a hardcover book. As with Vox Humana, keyboardist Rob Watson was unavailable for the photo session for this album. Thus the album's group photo only shows four of the five band members.

A referee or simply ref is the person of authority in a variety of sports who is responsible for presiding over the game from a neutral point of view and making on-the-fly decisions that enforce the rules of the sport, including sportsmanship decisions such as ejection. The official tasked with this job may be known, in addition to referee, by a variety of other titles as well (often depending on the sport), including official, umpire, judge, arbiter, arbitrator, linesman, commissaire, timekeeper, touch judge or Technical Official (by the International Olympic Committee). Origin The term \\"referee\\" originated in association football. Originally the team captains would consult with each other in order to resolve any dispute on the pitch. Eventually this role was delegated to an umpire. Each team would bring their own partisan umpire allowing the team captains to concentrate on the game. Later, the referee, a third \\"neutral\\" official was added; this referee would be \\"referred to\\" if the umpires could not resolve a dispute. The referee did not take his place on the pitch until 1891, when the umpires became linesmen (now assistant referees). Today, in many amateur football matches, each side will still supply their own partisan assistant referees (still commonly called club linesmen) to assist the neutral referee appointed by the governing football association if one or both assistant referees are not provided. In this case, the role of the linesmen is limited to indicating out of play and cannot decide off side. Examples =Australian rules football= A goal umpire officiating between the goal posts at one end of an Australian rules football field An umpire is an official in the sport of Australian rules football. Games are overseen by one to three field umpires, two to four boundary umpires, and two goal umpires. =Bandy= Referee in bandy A game of bandy is officiated by a referee, the authority and enforcer of the rules, whose decisions are final. The referee may be assisted by one or two assistant referees. =Baseball and softball= A second base umpire at a baseball game In baseball and softball, there is commonly a head umpire (also known as a plate umpire) who is in charge of calling balls and strikes from behind the plate, who is assisted by one, two, three, or five field umpires who make calls on their specific bases (or with five umpires the bases and the outfield). On any question, the head umpire has the final call. =Basketball= A college basketball official making a call In international basketball and in college basketball, the referee is the lead official in a game, and is assisted by either one or two umpires. In the National Basketball Association, the lead official is referred to by the term crew chief and the two other officials are referees. All of the officials in a basketball game are generally accepted to have the same authority as the lead official and therefore they are collectively known as the officials or referees. =Boxing= A boxing referee counting a boxer In boxing a referee is the person who enforces the rules during the fight. He gives instructions to the fighters, starts and stops the count when a competitor is down, and makes the determination to stop a fight when a competitor cannot continue without endangering his health. =Cricket= A cricket umpire calling a batsman out In cricket, the match referee is an off-field official who makes judgements concerning the reputable conduct of the game and hands out penalties for breaches of the ICC Cricket Code of Conduct. On-field decisions relevant to the play and outcome of the game itself are handled by two on-field umpires, although an off-field third umpire may help with certain decisions. =Cue sports= In cue sports, such as billiards and snooker, matches are presided over by a referee. The referee will determine all matters of fact relating to the rules, maintain fair playing conditions, call fouls, and take other action as required by these rules. (Source: World Pool-Billiard Association) =Cycling= A commissaire is an official in competitive cycling. =Fencing= A fencing match is presided over by a referee. The referee must award a point to the fencer with right of way during the final action in the event of a double touch in foil and saber. A typical bout has one head referee and a video referee and at the request of a fencer can also have two visual referees. =Field hockey= An umpire in field hockey is a person with the authority to make decisions on a hockey field in accordance with the laws of the game. Each match is controlled by two such umpires, where it is typical for umpires to aid one another and correct each other when necessary . =Figure skating= A referee in figure skating sits in the middle of the judges panel and manages and has full control over the entire event.The referee represents the International Skating Union at international events. Referees for international events are trained by the International Skating Union. There are two levels of referee, International Referee and ISU Referee, with ISU Referees ranking higher. In Synchronized Ice Skating, there are two Referees. One, sits with the Judges as with ordinary competition and operates a touch screen computer, inputing deductions and marking the skaters. The other, known as the Assistant Referee ‚Äî Ice, stands by the barrier where the teams enter the ice. The ARI monitors ice conditions, communicates with the event Referee and supervises teams. =Floorball= A floorball game is controlled by two referees with equal power. =Football (American and Canadian)= An American football referee (right, in white cap) announces a call. The other officials wear black caps An American football (or Canadian football) referee is responsible for the general supervision of the game and has the final authority on all rulings. The referee is assisted by up to six other officials on the field. These officials are commonly referred to as \\"referees\\" but each has a title based on position and responsibilities during the game: referee, head linesman (\\"down judge\\" in the NFL), line judge, umpire, back judge, side judge, and field judge. In the modern XFL, an additional \\"ball judge\\", who wears a red hat, is on the field, but does not have the power to call penalties. =Football (association)= An association football referee making a call An association football (soccer) match is presided over by a referee, whom the Laws of the Game give \\"full authority to enforce the Laws of the Game in connection with the match to which he has been appointed\\" (Law 5). The referee is oftentimes assisted by two assistant referees, and sometimes by a fourth official. In UEFA football 2 additional assistant referees are used, each one standing next to a goal post and directly behind the goal line, to watch for fouls occurring within the penalty area and to see if the ball enters the goal. =Football (Gaelic)= Gaelic football referee (in blue shirt) There are usually 7 officials in Gaelic football. A main referee follows the play around the field and has the final authority on decisions such as fouls, throws and card-issuing, un-disputable by players. The main play referee is assisted by two linesmen, who make decisions on who gains possession when the ball goes out of the field of play, and can also advise the referee on off-the-ball events such as a fight or an illegal tackle. As well as the referee and two linesmen, there are two umpires at each end of the field of play who stand on either side of the goal post and raise a white flag for a point, or a green flag for a goal respectively, also calling wides and square-balls. An umpire can also advise the referee on off-the-ball incidents, but does not hold as much authority as a linesman. In recent times, technology called 'Hawk-eye' can be used if both the umpires and referee are unsure of whether a point has been scored or not, though this technology is not widely available. =Golf= Golf is often played without referees. According to the Middle Atlantic Section of the PGA of America, \\"few golfers are fully qualified to serve as referees.\\" A golf referee must remain alert during matches and enforce the rules of golf. =Handball= According to the International Handball Association, team handball games are officiated by two referees with equal authority who are in charge of each match. They are assisted by a timekeeper and a scorekeeper. (Source: International Handball Association, Rules of the Game, 1 August 2005). =Hurling= Hurling refereeing team. The referee, linesmen and sideline official wear blue shirts and black shorts, while the umpires wear white coats. There are usually 7 officials in hurling. A main referee follows the play around the field and has the final authority on decisions such as fouls, throws and card-issuing, un- disputable by players. The main play referee is assisted by two linesmen, who make decisions on who gains possession when the ball goes out of the field of play, and can also advise the referee on off-the-ball events such as a fight or an illegal tackle. As well as the referee and two linesmen, there are two umpires at each end of the field of play who stand on either side of the goal post and raise a white flag for a point, or a green flag for a goal respectively, also calling wides. Any umpire can also advise the referee on off-the-ball incidents, but does not hold as much authority as a linesman. At inter-county senior games and other important matches, an eighth official, the \\"Sideline Official\\", receive substitution notes and holds up the number of substituted players and the amount of additional time, similar to a soccer fourth official.https://www.gaa.ie/my-gaa/match-officials/sideline-officials In recent times, technology called Hawk-Eye can be used if both the umpires and referee are unsure of whether a point has been scored or not, although this technology is not widely available. =Ice hockey= An ice hockey referee Games of ice hockey are presided over by on-ice referees, who are generally assisted by on-ice linesmen. The combination of referees and linesman varies from league to league. A few leagues, including the NCAA, are starting to refer to linesmen as assistant referees. In addition, off-ice officials administer to specific functions such as goal judge, penalty timekeeper, game timekeeper, statistician, official scorer and, at the highest professional levels, instant replay official. =Korfball= In korfball, it is the referee's responsibility to control the game and its environment, to enforce the rules and to take action against misbehaviour. He is assisted by an assistant referee, who alerts the referee to out balls and fouls and may have other tasks determined by the referee, and where possible by a timekeeper and scorer. =Lacrosse= A lacrosse match is presided over by a crew of either two, three, or in some cases four on-field officials. In two-man crew, a Referee and an Umpire are utilized. In a three-man crew, a Referee, Umpire, and Field Judge are utilized. The Referee shall always have the final ruling on any and all matters. For games of significance a four-man crew can be used which includes a three-man crew plus a Chief Bench Official who has jurisdiction over the bench area including the timekeeper. The professional outdoor league in the United States utilizes four on-field officials in order to be able to better keep up with the increased pace of play. =Lawn bowls= A lawn bowls match is presided over by a bowls umpire or technical official. In games where single players compete, a marker is required to direct play and assist players with questions relating to the position of their bowls. =Mixed martial arts= Rules in mixed martial arts (MMA) bouts are enforced by a referee who can give warnings and disqualifications should the rules be broken. The referee is also in charge of stopping fights when a fighter \\"cannot intelligently defend himself\\" in order to prevent him from incurring further damage, as well as making sure that submissions are released following a tapout and to pull fighters off an unconscious opponent. The referee is advised by a doctor and assistant referee who sit ringside. The primary concern and job of an MMA referee is the safety of the fighters. =Motorsport= Aside the race control who are responsible for the start, running and timekeeping of the race, each section of the circuit is presided by a team of marshals led by an observer, who also report incidents and technical mishap of the race. =Netball= In the game of Netball the match at hand is Presided over by 2 umpires, typically female, with a comprehensive knowledge of the rules. There are also 2 timekeepers and 2 scorekeepers who inform the umpires, and players of time remaining, and scores. =Roller derby= The game of roller derby is governed by a team of up to seven skating referees. (Only three are required due to the grass-roots nature of the sport, though the full seven are used whenever possible). The required referees are a head referee, who oversees the running of the entire game and has final say in any disputes, and who doubles as an inside pack referee, following alongside the main pack of skaters from inside the track and issuing and enforcing penalties for fouls or infringements of the rules; and two jammer referees who follow the two point-scoring players known as jammers. Additional referees fill the roles of a second inside pack ref and up to three outside pack refs, who perform similar duties to the inside pack refs, but from the outside of the track, and who rotate active duty in a relay-race style to avoid fatigue caused by the extra speed needed to keep pace with the pack from the outside. Non-skating officials complete the team by recording and communicating points and penalties and ensuring skaters serve their time accordingly. Only the team captains may engage in discussions with the referees by way of the head referee, over calls made. Referees are also responsible for ensuring the skaters are correctly wearing all regulation safety equipment. =Rowing= In a regatta an umpire is the on-the-water official appointed to enforce the rules of racing and to ensure safety. In some cases an umpire may be designated specifically as starter, or otherwise the umpire starts the race from a launch and follows it to its end, ensuring that crews follow their proper course. If no infringements occur, the result is decided by a judge or judges on the waterside who determine the finish order of the crews. =Rugby league= sin bin for ten minutes Rugby league games are controlled by an on field referee assisted by two touch judges, and often a video referee during televised games. With non-televised games in rugby league, the referee has 2 touch judges and 2 in-goal judges to assist. The referee and the touch judges cannot be contradicted by any player, but captains may discuss calls with them. In some rugby league competitions, most notably Australia's National Rugby League, public criticism of officials by players or coaching staff can result in fines being levied against the offending club. The National Rugby League is also experimenting with a two-referee system: the control referee is primarily in charge of the play and calling penalties, and the assist referee, who communicates with the control referee but should not blow the whistle. The two referees exchange roles on changes of possession. Touch football Touch football/touch rugby (commonly known as \\"touch\\") has a unique refereeing concept. As in most team sports, there is an on-field referee and referees on each of the two sideline. However, in touch football, the referees may interchange, similar to players, at appropriate times. Appropriate times may include when the play has moved close enough to the sideline for the referees to swap without the interrupting the play. This may occur during a set of six or during a change of possession. Other times that referees may interchange include after the awarding of touchdowns and penalties. Touch is also one of the few remaining sports where referees wear metal badges on their chests to represent their official level within their governing organisation. In Australia, the highest referee level is 6, the lowest being 1. In New Zealand, the highest level is 4, the lowest being 1. Prior to level 1, there is an elementary level beginners. In Europe, the highest level is 5, the lowest being 1. =Rugby union= knock-on Rugby union games are controlled by an on field referee assisted by two Assistant Referees (AR's), and often a Television Match Official (TMO) during televised games. The referee and the touch judges cannot be contradicted by any player, but captains may discuss calls with them. =Sailing= Referee are rarely present during sailing races as decisions are normally referred to a jury-style protest committee after the race. However, sometimes in match race and in team racing an \\"umpire\\" is an on-the-water referee appointed to directly enforce the Racing Rules of Sailing. An umpire is also used in fleet racing to enforce Racing Rule 42 which limits the use of kinetics to drive the boat rather than the wind. =Shooting= IROA Range Officer on Stage 11 of the 2017 IPSC Rifle World Shoot. In practical shooting competitions within the IPSC, Range Officials acts as referees. The International Range Officers Association is the part of IPSC with the responsibility to train and certify range officials in order to ensure that matches are run safely, fair and according to the rules. The Range Officer (RO) is the lowest ranking referee, and the one issuing range commands and following the competitor during the Course of Fire. The Chief Range Officer (CRO) oversees the Range Officer, and has primary authority over the particular course. The overall authority for all officials in the entire match is held by the Range Master (RM). If an athlete disagree with a call made by a Range Officer, he may consult the Chief Range Officer to challenge the call. If the call is still upheld, the matter may be brought to the Range Master. Finally, if the call is upheld by the Range Master, the athlete may lodge a formal protest to the Arbitration Committee. However, some referee calls may not be challenged by the athlete, particularly those regarding safe firearms handling. =Sumo= A gy≈çji, indicated by the solid purple tassels on his outfit. A sumo match is overseen by a in the ring and five seated around the ring. All dress in traditional Japanese clothing, with higher-ranked referees wearing elaborate silk outfits. The referee oversees the pre-match rituals and the bout itself, including ruling on the winner of the bout and the winning technique used. If one of the umpires disagrees, then all the umpires confer to determine the winner of the bout. Tradition holds that if one of the two top ranked gy≈çji has his decision overturned, he is expected to tender his resignation, although the Chairman of the Japan Sumo Association usually rejects the resignation. =Tennis= A chair umpire prior to the start of a tennis match In tennis an umpire is an on-court official, while a referee is an off-court official. =Underwater hockey= An Octopush or underwater hockey match is presided over by two or three water referees in the pool, a chief referee on deck, and at least one timekeeper and one scorekeeper. Additional timekeepers can be used to track penalty times in highly contested matches. A tournament referee will arbitrate for chief referees, whilst protests will be adjudicated by at least three independent referees. =Volleyball= A volleyball match is presided over by a first referee, who observes action from a stand, providing a clear view of action above the net and looking down into the court. The second referee, who assists the first referee, is at floor level on the opposite side of the net‚Äîand in front of the scorers' table. They are often referred to informally as the \\"up referee\\" and \\"down referee,\\" respectively. While the first referee watches over actions involving the ball (and thus the attacking team), the second referee usually judges errors committed by the defending team, like touching the net. =Wrestling (amateur)= The international styles of amateur wrestling use a three-official system in which a referee conducts the action in the center of the mat while a judge and a mat chairman remain seated and evaluate the action from their stationary vantage points. Collegiate wrestling uses a single referee in the center of the mat, or a head referee and an assistant. =Wrestling (professional)= In professional wrestling, the referee's on- stage purpose is similar to that of referees in combat sports such as boxing or mixed martial arts. However, in reality referees are participants in executing a match in accordance with its pre-determined outcome as well as any other events that are scripted to take place during the match. They also function as a conduit for communication between the wrestlers and backstage officials during matches. Other uses =Military= In a military exercise or field training exercise, the umpire (or observer) is a non-participating officer tasked with monitoring personnel in the field. The umpire does not give orders to the soldiers being observed, nor does the umpire provide any information as to unreleased details of the exercise. Their role is strictly to observe and provide reviews of actions taken, especially where military personnel performed in an innovative way or showed selfless effort. =Role- playing games= A gamemaster acts as an organizer, officiant for regarding rules, arbitrator, and moderator for a multiplayer role-playing game. They are more common in co-operative games in which players work together than in competitive games in which players oppose each other. Attire Referees typically wear clothing to distinguish themselves from the players. Such uniforms may be distinctive, and some traditional uniforms have come to be symbolically associated with the position (even if newer, alternative uniforms are increasingly used). Notable examples include the traditional black uniform worn by association football referees, or the vertical black and white stripes worn by referees in many North American sports. These two traditional uniforms have led to the informal terms \\"the man in black\\" and \\"zebra,\\" respectively.Andy Griffith, in his routine \\"What It Was, Was Football,\\" derisively and laughably referred to them as \\"convicts\\" for that reason. It is also not uncommon for referees to wear bright reflective shirts.

He was one of the strongest chess players in the world from the mid 1930s until his retirement from chess in 1951. He was granted the title of International Grandmaster by FIDE in 1950, when titles were introduced. Fine's best result was his equal first place in the 1938 AVRO tournament, one of the strongest tournaments of all time. After the death of world champion Alexander Alekhine in 1946, Fine was one of six players invited to compete for the World Championship in 1948. He declined the invitation, however, and virtually retired from serious competition around that time, although he did play a few events until 1951. Fine won five medals (four gold) in three Chess Olympiads. He won the US Open all seven times he entered (1932, 1933, 1934, 1935, 1939, 1940, 1941). He was the author of several chess books, covering endgame, opening, and middlegame.  Early life and family  Fine was born in the Bronx to Jacob and Bertha (Nedner) Fine, poor Russian Jews. He had a sister, Evelyn (born in 1912), and was raised by his mother alone from the age of two. An uncle taught him chess when he was eight. Chess career =Teenage master= Fine began chess as a young teenager at the famous Manhattan Chess Club, where he hustled for nickels, until he was asked to stop; he used the money to help feed his family. Afterwards he moved to the rival Marshall Chess Club in New York City, stomping grounds for many famous players, such as Bobby Fischer, later on. At this stage of his career, Fine played a great deal of blitz chess, and he eventually became one of the best blitz players in the world. Even in the early 1930s, he could nearly hold his own in blitz chess against the then world champion Alexander Alekhine, although Fine admitted that the few times he played blitz with Alekhine's predecessor Jos√© Ra√∫l Capablanca, the latter beat him \\"mercilessly\\".Denker and Parr 1995, chapter Fine Distinctions Fine's first significant master-level event was the 1930 New York Young Masters tournament, which was won by Arthur Dake. He narrowly lost a 1931 stakes match to fellow young New York master Arnold Denker. Fine placed second at the 1931 New York State Championship with a score of 8/11, half a point behind Fred Reinfeld. Fine won the 15th Marshall Chess Club Championship of 1931 with 10¬Ω/13, half a point ahead of Reinfeld.rogerpaige.me.uk/tables2.htm He defeated Herman Steiner by 5¬Ω‚Äì4¬Ω at New York 1932; this was the first of three matches the two players contested.Reuben Fine at Chessmetrics =U.S. Open Champion= At 17, Fine won his first of seven US Opens at Minneapolis 1932 with 9¬Ω/11, half a point ahead of Samuel Reshevsky; this tournament was known as the Western Open at the time. Fine played in his first top-class international tournament at Pasadena 1932, where he shared 7th‚Äì10th with 5/11; the winner was world champion Alexander Alekhine. Fine repeated as champion in the 16th Marshall Club Championship, held from October to December 1932, with 11¬Ω/13, 2¬Ω points ahead of the runner-up.rogerpaige.me.uk/tables3.htmThe Chess Review, January 1933, p. 24 =College= Fine graduated from City College of New York in 1932, at the age of 18; he was a successful student there. He captained CCNY to the 1931 National Collegiate team title; a teammate was master Sidney Bernstein. This tournament later evolved into the Pan American Intercollegiate Team Chess Championship. Fine then decided to try the life of a chess professional for a few years. = Olympiad results = Fine won the U.S. team selection tournament, New York 1933, with 8/10.rogerpaige.me.uk/tables4.htm This earned him the first of three national team berths for the chess Olympiads.The Chess Review, June 1933, p. 5 Fine won five medals (including three team golds) representing the United States; his detailed record follows; his totals are (+20‚àí6=19), for 65.6%. * Folkestone 1933: board three, 9/13 (+6‚àí1=6), team gold, board silver * Warsaw 1935: board one, 9/17 (+5‚àí4=8), team gold * Stockholm 1937: board two, 11¬Ω/15 (+9‚àí1=5), team gold, board gold =North American successes= Fine repeated as champion at the U.S./Western Open, Detroit 1933, with 12/13, half a point ahead of Reshevsky. Fine won the 17th Marshall Club Championship, 1933‚Äì34, with 9¬Ω/11. He defeated Al Horowitz in a match at New York 1934 by 6‚Äì3. Fine shared 1st‚Äì2nd at the U.S./Western Open, Chicago 1934, on 7¬Ω/9, with Reshevsky. He then shared 1st‚Äì3rd at Mexico City 1934, on 11/12, with Herman Steiner and Arthur Dake. At Syracuse 1934, Fine shared 3rd‚Äì4th, on 10/14, as Reshevsky won. Fine won his fourth straight U.S./Western Open at Milwaukee 1935, scoring 6¬Ω/9 in the preliminary round, and then 8/10 in the finals. =European debut= Having had outstanding successes in North America, Fine tried his first European individual international tournament at ≈Å√≥d≈∫ 1935, where he shared 2nd‚Äì3rd with 6/9 behind Savielly Tartakower. Fine won Hastings 1935‚Äì36 with 7¬Ω/9, a point ahead of Salo Flohr. =Narrow misses at U.S. Championship= Although Fine was active and very successful in U.S. open tournaments, he was never able to win the U.S. Championship, usually placing behind his great American rival, Samuel Reshevsky. The U.S. Championship was organized in a round-robin format during that era. When in 1936 Frank Marshall voluntarily gave up the American Championship title he had held since 1909, the result was the first modern U.S. Championship tournament. Fine scored 10¬Ω/15 in the U.S. Championship, New York City 1936, a tied 3rd‚Äì4th, as Reshevsky won. In the U.S. Championship, New York 1938, Fine placed 2nd with 12¬Ω/16, with Reshevsky repeating as champion. In the U.S. Championship, New York 1940, Fine again scored 12¬Ω/16 for 2nd, as Reshevsky won for the third straight time. Then in the 1944 U.S. Championship at New York, Fine scored 14¬Ω/17 for 2nd, losing his game to Arnold Denker, and finishing half a point back, as the latter won his only national title. Fine tallied 50/64 in his four U.S. title attempts, for 78.1%, but was never champion. Not being national champion seriously hurt Fine's prospects for making a career from chess. =International success= However, Fine's international tournament record in the 1930s was superior to Reshevsky's. The former did play many more top-class international events than the latter during that period, and was usually near the top of the table. By the end of 1937, Fine had won a string of strong European international tournaments, and was one of the most successful players in the world. Fine won at Oslo 1936 with 6¬Ω/7, half a point ahead of Flohr. Fine captured Zandvoort 1936 with 8¬Ω/11, ahead of World Champion Max Euwe, Savielly Tartakower, and Paul Keres. Fine shared 3rd‚Äì5th at the elite Nottingham 1936 event with 9¬Ω/14, half a point behind winners Jos√© Ra√∫l Capablanca and Mikhail Botvinnik. Fine shared 1st‚Äì2nd at Amsterdam 1936 on 5/7 with Euwe, half a point ahead of Alekhine. Fine placed 2nd at Hastings 1936‚Äì37 with 7¬Ω/9, as Alekhine won. The year 1937 was Fine's most successful. He won at Leningrad 1937 with 4/5, ahead of Grigory Levenfish, who shared first in that year's Soviet Championship. Fine won at Moscow 1937 with 5/7. Those two victories make Fine one of a very select group of foreigners to have won on Russian soil. Fine shared 1st‚Äì2nd at Margate 1937 with Keres on 7¬Ω/9, 1¬Ω points ahead of Alekhine. Fine shared 1st‚Äì3rd at Ostend 1937 with Keres and Henry Grob on 6/9. At Stockholm 1937, Fine won with 8/9, 1¬Ω points ahead of Gideon St√•hlberg. Fine then defeated Stahlberg by 5‚Äì3 in a match held at Gothenburg 1937. Fine placed 2nd at the elite Semmering/Baden 1937 tournament with 8/14, behind Keres. At Kemeri, Latvia 1937, Fine had a rare relatively weak result, with just 9/17 for 8th place, as the title was shared by Reshevsky, Flohr, and Vladimirs Petrovs. Fine shared 4th‚Äì5th at Hastings 1937‚Äì38 with 6/9 as Reshevsky won. =AVRO 1938= In 1938, Fine tied for first place with Paul Keres in the prestigious AVRO tournament in the Netherlands, scoring 8¬Ω/14, with Keres placed first on tiebreak. This was one of the most famous tournaments of the 20th century. It was organized with the hope that the winner of AVRO, a double round-robin tournament, would be the next challenger to world champion Alexander Alekhine. Since Alekhine won the title in 1927, he had been avoiding a rematch with his predecessor, Capablanca, whom many considered the strongest possible challenger. Fine finished ahead of future champion Mikhail Botvinnik, current champion Alekhine, former world champions Max Euwe and Capablanca, and Samuel Reshevsky and Salo Flohr. Fine won both of his games against Alekhine. Fine got out to a tremendous start, scoring five wins and a draw in his first six games, but then lost in round seven to Keres, and this wound up as the decisive game for the tournament victor, providing his tiebreak. =Wartime years= As World War II interrupted any prospects for a world championship match, Fine turned to chess writing. In 1939, Fine became the first world- class player to edit the classic opening guide Modern Chess Openings. His work on the sixth edition of the book led to a significant increase in sales. In 1941 he wrote Basic Chess Endings, a compendium of endgame analysis which, some 70 years later, is still considered one of the best works on this subject. His book was the most comprehensive on the subject written to that time, included significant original work by Fine, and received worldwide acclaim. His The Ideas Behind the Chess Openings, though now out of date, is still useful for grasping the underlying ideas of many standard chess openings; it was revised in 1989. Fine played a few serious American events during World War II, with international chess at a virtual standstill, and continued his successes with dominant scores. He won the U.S. Open at New York 1939 with 10¬Ω/11, half a point ahead of Reshevsky. In the 23rd Marshall Club Championship of 1939, Fine won with 14/16. He won the 1940 U.S. Open at Dallas with a perfect 8/8 in the finals, three points ahead of Herman Steiner. Fine won the New York State Championship, Hamilton 1941, with 8/10, a point ahead of Reshevsky, Arnold Denker and Isaac Kashdan. Fine won the 1941 Marshall Club Championship with 14/15, ahead of Frank Marshall. Fine won the 1941 U.S. Open at St. Louis, with 4/5 in the preliminaries, and 8/9 in the finals. Fine won the 1942 Washington, D.C. Chess Divan title with 7/7. He defeated Herman Steiner in match play for the second time by 3¬Ω‚Äì¬Ω at Washington 1944. Fine won the U.S. Speed Championships of both 1944 (10/11) and 1945 (10/11). In the Pan-American Championship, Hollywood 1945, Fine placed 2nd with 9/12, behind Reshevsky. He played in the 1945 USA vs USSR Radio team match, scoring ¬Ω/2 on board three against Isaac Boleslavsky. Then Fine travelled to Europe one last time to compete, in the 1946 Moscow team match against the USSR, scoring ¬Ω/2 on board three against Paul Keres. =Declines to enter 1948 World Championship = As the World War ended in early September 1945, Fine was 30 years of age, and working on his doctorate in psychology. After World Champion Alekhine died in March 1946, FIDE (the World Chess Federation) organized a World Chess Championship tournament to determine the new champion. Alekhine was the first champion to die as title-holder, creating an unprecedented problem. As co-winner in the AVRO tournament, Fine was invited to participate, but he declined, for reasons that are the subject of speculation even today. Fine had played a third match against Herman Steiner at Los Angeles 1947, winning 5‚Äì1; this match was training for his potential world championship appearance. Publicly, Fine stated that he could not interrupt work on his doctoral dissertation in psychology. Negotiations over the tournament had been protracted, and for a long time it was unclear whether this World Championship event would in fact take place. Fine wrote that he didn't want to spend many months preparing and then see the tournament cancelled. However, it has also been suggested that Fine declined to play because he suspected there would be collaboration among the three Soviet participants to ensure that one of them won the championship. In the August 2004 issue of Chess Life, for example, Larry Evans gave his recollection that \\"Fine told me he didn't want to waste three months of his life watching Russians throw games to each other.\\" Fine's 1951 written statement on the matter in his book The World's Greatest Chess Games was: > Unfortunately for the Western masters the Soviet political organization was > stronger than that of the West. The U.S. Chess Federation was a meaningless > paper organization, generally antagonistic to the needs of its masters. The > Dutch Chess Federation did not choose to act. The FIDE was impotent. The > result was a rescheduling of the tournament for the following year, with the > vital difference that now half was to be played in Holland, half in the > U.S.S.R. Dissatisfied with this arrangement and the general tenor of the > event, I withdrew. Edward Winter discusses the evidence further in a 2007 ChessBase column. =Final competitive appearances= Once Fine completed his doctorate, he did play some more competitive chess. He won at New York 1948 with 8/9, ahead of Miguel Najdorf, Max Euwe, and Herman Pilnik. Fine drew a match against Najdorf at 4‚Äì4 at New York 1949. He participated for the U.S. in the 1950 radio match against Yugoslavia, drawing his only game. Fine received the title of International Grandmaster in 1950 from FIDE, on its first official list of titled players. Fine's final top-class event was the Maurice Wertheim Memorial, New York 1951, where he scored 7/11 for 4th, as Reshevsky won. Fine was seeded into the 1950 Candidates Tournament at Budapest, but declined his invitation; this tournament was the first to select an official challenger to the World Champion under the auspices of FIDE, the World Chess Federation. =Lifetime scores against top players= Fine had a relatively short career in top-level chess, but scored well against top players. He faced five World Champions: Emanuel Lasker (+1‚àí0=0);Fine‚ÄìLasker record, chessgames.com Jos√© Ra√∫l Capablanca (+0‚àí0=5, excluding simultaneous games);Fine‚ÄìCapablanca record, chessgames.com Alexander Alekhine (+3‚àí2=4);Fine‚ÄìAlekhine record, chessgames.com Max Euwe (+2‚àí2=3);Fine‚ÄìEuwe record, chessgames.com and Mikhail Botvinnik (+1‚àí0=2).Fine‚ÄìBotvinnik record, chessgames.com His main American rivals were Samuel Reshevsky (+3‚àí4=12); Herman Steiner (+21‚àí4=8); Isaac Kashdan (+6‚àí1=6); Albert Simonson (+6‚àí1=1); Al Horowitz (+10‚àí2=7); Arnold Denker (+7‚àí6=7); Fred Reinfeld (+10‚àí5=7); and Arthur Dake (+7‚àí7=5, with three losses as a 16-year-old against Dake in his 20s). Internationally, Fine faced the best of his time, and usually more than held his own, with three exceptions. He struggled against Paul Keres (+1‚àí3=8); Milan Vidmar (+0‚àí1=2); and Isaac Boleslavsky (+0‚àí1=1), but he handled everyone else: Miguel Najdorf (+3‚àí3=5); Savielly Tartakower (+2‚àí1=4); Salo Flohr (+2‚àí0=7); Grigory Levenfish (+1‚àí0=0); George Alan Thomas (+2‚àí0=3); Erich Eliskases (+1‚àí0=2); Viacheslav Ragozin (+1‚àí0=1); Vladimirs Petrovs (+2‚àí1=1); Efim Bogolyubov (+1‚àí0=1); Jan Foltys (+2‚àí0=0); Salo Landau (+4‚àí0=1); George Koltanowski (+2‚àí0=1); Igor Bondarevsky (+1‚àí0=0); G√©za Mar√≥czy (+1‚àí0=0); William Winter (+4‚àí0=0); Ernst Gr√ºnfeld (+1‚àí0=0); Gideon St√•hlberg (+4‚àí2=5); Andor Lilienthal (+1‚àí0=0); L√°szl√≥ Szab√≥ (+0‚àí0=1); Vladas Mikƒónas (+1‚àí0=1); Rudolph Spielmann (+0‚àí0=1); and Conel Hugh O'Donel Alexander (+1‚àí0=3). Finally, against the new generation of American masters which emerged in the late 1940s, Fine proved he could still perform well: Arthur Bisguier (+1‚àí0=1); Larry Evans (+0‚àí0=2); George Kramer (+1‚àí0=1); and Robert Byrne (+0‚àí0=1). =Top ten for eight years= Although FIDE, the World Chess Federation, did not formally introduce chess ratings for international play until 1970, it is nevertheless possible to retrospectively rate players' performances from before that time. The site Chessmetrics.com, which specializes in historical ratings throughout chess history, ranks Fine in the world's top ten players for more than eight years, from March 1936 until October 1942, and then again from January 1949 until December 1950. Fine was inducted into the U.S. Chess Hall of Fame in 1986, the charter class. He continued his successful chess writing career for many years after he retired from competition. =Notable games= *Reuben Fine vs. Mikhail Botvinnik, Amsterdam AVRO 1938, French Defence, Winawer/Advance Variation (C17), 1‚Äì0 In the final position, \\"Black does not have a single move, and Rf3 is threatened.

Professional life Reuben Fine in 1961 Fine earned a bachelor's degree from the City College of New York in 1932. During World War II, Fine worked for the U.S. Navy, analyzing the probability of German U-boats surfacing at certain points in the Atlantic Ocean. Fine also worked as a translator. After World War II, he earned his doctorate in psychology from the University of Southern California. He served as a university professor, and wrote many successful books on psychology. After receiving his doctorate in psychology from the University of Southern California, Fine abandoned professional chess to concentrate on his new profession. Fine continued playing chess casually throughout his life (including several friendly games played in 1963 against Bobby Fischer, one of which is included in Fischer's My 60 Memorable Games). In 1956 he wrote an article, \\"Psychoanalytic Observations on Chess and Chess Masters\\", for a psychological journal. Later, Fine turned the article into a book, The Psychology of the Chess Player, in which he provided insights steeped in Freudian theory. Fine is not the first person to have examined the mind as it relates to chess: Alfred Binet, the inventor of the IQ test, had studied the mental functionality of good chess players, and found that they often had enhanced mental traits, such as a good memory. He went on to publish A History of Psychoanalysis (1979) and a number of other books on psychology. Journalist Gilbert Cant observed: > A great chess player, Manhattan's Reuben Fine, has popularized a psychology > of chess studded with phallic symbols, spattered with anal-sadistic impulses > and imbued with latent homosexuality. In successive rounds, Fine once > defeated Botvinnik, Reshevsky, Euwe, Flohr and Alekhine, and drew with > Capablanca. When Fine switched his major interest from chess to > psychoanalysis, the result was a loss for chess‚Äîand a draw, at best, for > psychoanalysis. Many psychologists, some Freudians included, now believe > that the sexual symbolism in chess is vastly overdrawn. As did many psychoanalysts of his day, Fine believed that homosexuality is mutable (through conversion therapy), and his opinions on the subject were cited in legal battles over homosexuality, including the legislative battle over same-sex marriage in Hawaii. Fine served as a visiting professor at CCNY, the University of Amsterdam, the Lowell Institute of Technology, and the University of Florence. Fine founded the Creative Living Center in New York City. Personal life Fine married five times, all but one ending in divorce. He had two biological children and one stepson. There are conflicting accounts of his first marriage. Per the Los Angeles Times, he married Charlotte Margoshes in 1937. The New York Times first mentions a marriage to Emma Thea Keesing (1916‚Äì1960), whom he met in the Netherlands, married in September 1937, and divorced in 1944. The New York County registrar lists a marriage certificate for Charlotte Margoshes on October 8, 1936, but the marriage was very short. Fine married again in 1946, to Sonya Lebeaux. They had two children together, a son, Benjamin, and a daughter. He wrote The Teenage Chess Book with Benjamin. His last marriage, to Marcia Fine, lasted to his death in 1993.

Calgary Herald, March 20, 2012. After that band broke up, Diamond, Connelly and drummer Alex Koch moved to Toronto, where they joined with Don Pyle to form a new punk band, Crash Kills Five. That band released one EP, What Do You Do At Night?, in 1980 before breaking up in 1981, and the members briefly pursued other projects before Diamond, Connelly and Pyle reunited in 1984 as Shadowy Men. Signed to Cargo Records, they released a string of EPs and singles throughout the 1980s and early 1990s. The group also appeared on many compilation albums, and played on some tracks of Fred Schneider's solo album, Just Fred.\\"Heatseekers: all action, no talk\\". Toronto Star, February 1, 1996.

Their 1993 album Sport Fishin': The Lure of the Bait, The Luck of the Hook was engineered by Steve Albini, who was such a fan of the band that he offered to work with them for free. The group disbanded in 1996, in part because Pyle and Diamond wanted to record an album with Jad Fair while Connelly did not. Pyle and Diamond instead joined with Dallas Good of The Sadies to form Phono-Comb, and collaborated with Fair on the 1996 album Monsters, Lullabies...and the Occasional Flying Saucer.\\"Shadowy Men to Phono- Comb to Fair to ....\\" Halifax Daily News, March 30, 1996.

They separated in 1989, although the marriage was never officially dissolved. In 1992 Ulloa El√≠as died, which made the princess officially a widow. Property status After the death of King Alexander I, and during the Regency administration (of Regent Prince Paul, Radenko Stankoviƒá and Ivo Peroviƒá) that followed, the City of Belgrade District Court issued Decree N¬∞ 0.428/34 on 27 October 1938. The decree, which became official law on 4 March 1939, pronounced King Alexander I's underage sons King Peter II, Prince Tomislav and Prince Andrew, in equal parts, heirs to his entire estate. This included all real estate at Dedinje: the Royal Palace (Old Palace) in Belgrade, its surrounding land and forest, and the White Palace, with its appertaining houses. On 2 August 1947, Edvard Kardelj, then vice president of the Socialist Federal Republic of Yugoslavia, issued a decree that confiscated all these properties from the royal Karadjordjeviƒá family. This followed an earlier decree in March 1947, stripping the family of their citizenship.Royal Office (Serbia) official website, \\"The 02nd of August 1947 Decree\\", Accessed 20.09.12, His decree, the 'National Assembly of the Presidency of the People's Federal Republic of Yugoslavia,' was abolished in 2001 after the deposing of Slobodan Milo≈°eviƒá. The new government of Yugoslavia restored to all members of the royal family both their citizenship and the use of the entire royal complex in Dedinje. In 2013, it was announced that the villa \\"Crnogorka\\" (Montenegrin), in Uziƒçka Street, Dedinje, was to be returned to Princess Elizabeth. The villa was bought by Princess Olga in 1940, and taken by the state in 1947. It was owned by the Serbian government and used as the official residence of the Ambassador of Montenegro. Politics Princess Elizabeth recognized early the dangerous signs that would turn the former Yugoslavia upside down in a bloodbath of historic religious and ethnic rivalries long suppressed by Communist rule. She spoke out in Europe and America on behalf of bridging the gap between ethnic hatreds. Working behind the scenes through United Nations programs, she also journeyed to the Vatican in 1989 to ask Monsignor Tauran, then Holy See Secretary for Relations with States, to help improve relations between Catholic and Orthodox communities in Yugoslavia. Biografija, in Serbian language In December 1990,Princess Elizabeth Foundation she created the Princess Elizabeth Foundation, a non- political, not-for-profit organization after foreseeing the crucial importance of a vehicle to address the tension brewing just below the surface. Since the subsequent civil wars, her efforts have focused heavily on transporting medical supplies, food, clothing and blankets to refugee camps, in addition to finding homes for children victimized by war and placing older students in schools and colleges in America. Misija, in Serbian language Before the breakup of Yugoslavia began in 1991, she invited the Orthodox Bishop Sava and the Mufti of Belgrade, along with the Yugoslav Minister for Religious Affairs to attend a conference in Moscow that was hosted by Mikhail Gorbachev. This was the second international gathering of political and religious leaders committed to world reform that included Mother Teresa, the Archbishop of Canterbury, the Dalai Lama, Al Gore and Carl Sagan. Biografija, in Serbian language * She decided to run for President of Serbia in the 2004 Serbian presidential election, despite her cousin Alexander's objections, stating that the Royal Family should stay out of politics. After the end of World War II, the Royal Family was banished from the country, and their goods confiscated. \\"In case of victory,\\" she stated, \\"my priority would not be to return to a monarchy, but to form a real State.\\" She got 63,991 votes or 2.1%, finishing in 6th place out of fifteen candidates.source CESID In 2002, Princess Elizabeth received the first Nuclear Disarmament Forum Award, the Demiurgus Peace International, (accompanying president Vladimir Putin, Archbishop Desmond Tutu, Ted Turner and others) for outstanding achievements in the field of strengthening peace among nations in Zug, Switzerland.

Elected to the House of Representatives in 1957, Anthony served as a minister in successive Coalition Governments, and went on to serve as leader of the Country Party from 1971 to 1984, and Deputy Prime Minister under John Gorton, William McMahon and Malcolm Fraser. Anthony is the earliest elected Country MP still alive, and along with Ian Sinclair he is the last surviving minister who served in the Menzies Government and the First Holt Ministry. Early life Anthony was born in Murwillumbah in northern New South Wales. He was the son of Hubert Lawrence \\"Larry\\" Anthony, a well-known Country Party politician. Doug Anthony was educated at Murwillumbah Primary School and Murwillumbah High School, before attending The King's School in Sydney between 1943 and 1946 and then Gatton College in Queensland. After graduating he took up dairy-farming near Murwillumbah. In 1957 he married Margot Budd, with whom he had three children: Dougald, Jane and Larry. Political career Anthony shortly after his election, in 1958. =Early career (1957-1964)= In 1957 Larry Anthony Sr., who was Postmaster-General in the Liberal-Country Party coalition government led by Robert Menzies, died suddenly, and Doug was elected to succeed his father in the ensuing by-election for the Division of Richmond, aged 27. He was appointed Minister for the Interior in 1964. =Minister for the Interior (1964-1967)= During his tenure in the Interior portfolio, there were several pushes for Canberra to become independent and self-governing in some capacity.Canberra Times, 18 August 1964. The Menzies government had not yet established a clear policy for Canberra's future, and Anthony stated that the city was not yet ready for self-governance. At Narrogin in August 1966, Anthony relayed to several rural communities that drought would probably soon sweep the region, and that he was prepared to take precautions to prevent as many negative effects as possible. Beverley Times, 19 August 1966 He was unable to comment on protests that took place outside the Canberra Hotel on 2 February 1967. Canberra Times, 3 February 1967 Anthony was one of the leading forces against the 1967 nexus referendum, which was seeking to increase the senate's power in parliament. Senator Vince Gair revived the debate around the introduction of such a law in early 1967. Anthony and the County Party decided it would be ‚Äúunwise‚Äù to increase the power of the upper house. Canberra Times, 28 February 1967 Towards the end of his term as Minister for the Interior, Anthony supported a federal redistribution with conditions so restrictive that it favoured country seats and would increase Country Party representation. Splits within the Liberal and Country coalition were causing such issues to be raised and considered by parliament. These tensions were also fuelled by the narrow majority with which the Liberal Party was returned to power in the 1963 election; without Country Party support they could not have guaranteed parliamentary supply. Canberra Times, 12 September 1967 In 1967 he became Minister for Primary Industry. =Minister for Primary Industry (1967-1971)= Anthony with Billy Snedden and Jim Forbes in 1963 His first speech in this portfolio was made regarding the wheat price in Australia. 1966-67 had yielded a smaller amount than the 1965‚Äì66 season, and accordingly the price of what had to be raised.Beverley Times, 22 March 1968 Controversially, in May 1968, Anthony initiated a payout of $21 million to offset the devaluation of the British Pound by Prime Minister Harold Wilson; the currencies were not yet independent of each other. Beverley Times, 3 May 1968 Anthony's popularity in the Industry portfolio was damaged when rural production was down $450 million in 1968 and little change had occurred in the return that farmers were getting for production. Beverley Times, 2 August 1968 Anthony worked with Prime Minister John Gorton to try and create as many economically viable options as possible to deal with the ‚Äúwhat crisis‚Äù. Eventually quotas were introduced to limit production.Canberra Times, 15 April 1969 When China stopped importing Australian wheat in 1971, Anthony advised against communication with the country, saying it could be ‚Äúpolitically and commercially dangerous.Papua New Guinea Post-Courier, 11 June 1971 Anthony was made a Privy Councillor by Queen Elizabeth II on 23 June 1971. =Deputy Prime Minister (1971‚Äì1972)= Anthony as a junior minister in 1964. By mid-1969, it was thought that John McEwen, leader of the Country Party since 1958, was going to retire sometime in late 1970. The three members of the party considered to have the greatest chance of succeeding McEwen as leader were Anthony, Shipping Minister Ian Sinclair and Interior Minister Peter Nixon. When John McEwen retired in 1971, Anthony was chosen as his successor, taking McEwen's old posts of Minister for Trade and Industry and Deputy Prime Minister in the government of John Gorton, portfolios he retained under William McMahon. He rescinded McEwen's veto of McMahon as liberal leader and Prime Minister. When McMahon became Prime Minister in March 1971, only a month after Anthony had taken the Deputy Prime Minister position, he lost power as McMahon disliked Anthony and the two had a poor working relationship. He opposed the revaluation of the Australian dollar by McMahon in 1971‚Äì72. In mid-1972, McMahon stopped talking to Anthony and he was oblivious of many decisions that were occurring outside cabinet. When McMahon announced the 1972 election, he left Anthony in the dark and he was unaware of the date on which it would take place and the campaign techniques the coalition would use. Anthony called the Prime Minister of New Zealand, Keith Holyoake, to find out the date, as McMahon had only informed three people of the date before approaching the Governor-General. Anthony lost faith in the government and became complacent about the defeat which became obvious in the lead up to the election in December 1972.[The Liberals (1994), Episode 2, Part 3 (1:17-3:20) =Opposition (1972‚Äì1975)= After McMahon's defeat in 1972, Anthony was said to favour a policy of absolute opposition to the Labor government of Gough Whitlam. Despite this, the Country Party voted with the Labor Government on some bills, for example the 1973 expansion of state aid to under-privileged schools. He changed the party's name to the National Country Party and began contesting urban seats in Queensland and Western Australia. Under his leadership, the Country Party's relationship with production industry was weakened. Sydney Tribune, 3 December 1975 Anthony criticised Whitlam for not giving enough aid to Papua New Guinea in 1975. Papua New Guinea Post-Courier, 14 August 1975 =Deputy Prime Minister (1975‚Äì1983)= Anthony in Romania in 1976. Anthony had a much better working relationship with Fraser than he did with Billy Snedden.Sydney Tribune, 1 April 1975 At first, Anthony did not support Snedden's or Fraser's decisions to block parliamentary supply from the Labor Party, beginning in October 1975. He was soon convinced.Canberra Times, 20 April 1974 The Coalition was confirmed in power at the 1975 election, with the biggest majority government in Australian history. Anthony again became Deputy Prime Minister, with the portfolios of Overseas Trade and National Resources (Trade and Resources from 1977) under Malcolm Fraser. From 1975‚Äì80, Anthony found that he did not have the same power he had possessed before the 1972 election, as the Liberal Party had started gaining government in its own right. Anthony was noted, while Prime Minister Fraser took annual Christmas holidays, for governing the country as Acting Prime Minister from a caravan in his electorate of Richmond.Doug Anthony Address at the 1974 National Party Conference In 1976, during his second term as Deputy Prime Minister, Anthony began a strong import and export relationship with Japan, particularly over oil. Papua New Guinea Post-Courier, 9 February 1976 Anthony supported the mining and export of Australian uranium, and believed it would be an essential part of the future economy. Papua New Guinea Post-Courier, 31 March 1976 While Acting Prime Minister in July 1976, he was the first user of the Papua New Guinea-Cairns telephone line, speaking to Acting Prime Minister Sir Maori Kiki. Papua New Guinea Post-Courier, 23 July 1976 While Acting Prime Minister in July 1979, he threatened to shut down an industrial strike in Western Australia, stating the issue had to be resolved. The Labor Party was strongly opposed to this action and called his power as Acting Prime Minister into question. Papua New Guinea Post-Courier, ?? July 1979 After Fraser lost office in 1983, Anthony remained as party leader (now named the National Party since 1974). The last major move as leader of the National Party that Anthony made was to explain the tensions between the Liberal and National parties in Queensland, who officially opposed each other in the October 1983 election. Canberra Times, 1 November 1938 Retirement Anthony remained in parliament for less than a year before retiring from politics in 1984. By then, although only 55, he was the Father of the House of Representatives. He returned to his farm near Murwillumbah and generally stayed out of politics. In 1996 his son Larry Anthony won his father's old seat, creating the first three-generation dynasty in the House of Representatives. In 1994, Anthony appeared in a documentary series about the Liberal Party in which he revealed that McMahon had refused to tell him beforehand the date of the 1972 election despite Anthony being the Country Party leader. During 1999, Anthony spoke in support of Australia becoming a republic.Republic referendum a political campaign with few precedents, ABC, 11 October 1999 Honours In 1981 Anthony was appointed a Companion of Honour (CH). In 1990, he was awarded the New Zealand 1990 Commemoration Medal. In 2003 he was made a Companion of the Order of Australia (AC) for service to the Australian Parliament, for forging the development of bi-lateral trade agreements, and for continued leadership and dedication to the social, educational, health and development needs of rural and regional communities. References in popular culture Anthony's name was used by the anarchic Canberra comedy trio the Doug Anthony All Stars, who rose to fame with celebrated appearances at the Edinburgh Festival Fringe in the 1980s and came to national prominence in Australia in 1990 with their performances on the TV comedy series The Big Gig and their own 1991‚Äì92 series DAAS Kapital.

The ship was built by Newport News Shipbuilding; she was laid down in March 1905, launched in October 1906, and was commissioned in May 1908. The final class of armored cruisers to be built for the US Navy, North Carolina and her sisters were armed with a main battery of four guns, and were capable of a top speed of . North Carolina spent much of her career in the Atlantic Ocean and Caribbean Sea conducting training and visiting foreign countries. She went on short deployments to the Mediterranean Sea twice, the first in 1909 to protect American citizens in the Ottoman Empire, and the second during World War I, again to protect still neutral American citizens in the region. After the United States entered the war in April 1917, North Carolina was used to escort troop ships off the eastern coast of the United States. Following the war in late 1918 and early 1919, she was used to carry soldiers from the American Expeditionary Force back from France. In 1920, the ship was renamed Charlotte so her original name could be used for a new battleship, and she was decommissioned the following year. She was sold for scrap in September 1930 and broken up thereafter. Design Line-drawing of a Tennessee-class cruiser, with mid-ship cross section North Carolina was long overall and had beam of and a draft of . She displaced normally and up to at full load. The ship was propelled by two 4-cylinder, vertical triple-expansion engines, with steam provided by sixteen coal-fired Babcock & Wilcox water-tube boilers trunked into four funnels. The engines were rated at , which produced a top speed of . She had a storage capacity for up to of coal, which allowed her to steam for at a speed of . She had a crew of 914 officers and men. Originally fitted with a pair of military masts, North Carolina had her foremast replaced with a cage mast in 1911. North Carolina was armed with a main battery of four 40-caliber Mark 3 guns in two twin gun turrets, one forward and one aft. These were supported by a secondary battery of sixteen 40-caliber Mark 8 guns mounted in casemates, eight on each broadside. For defense against torpedo boats, she carried twenty-two 50-caliber guns in single pedestal mounts either in casemates or sponsons in the hull. She also carried a variety of smaller guns, including twelve 3-pounder automatic guns and four 1-pounders. Like other contemporary armored cruisers, she was also armed with four torpedo tubes located below the waterline in her hull. North Carolina was protected by a combination of Krupp cemented steel and older Harvey steel. The ship's armored belt was thick and the maximum thickness of the armor deck was 3 in thick. The main battery turret faces were thick, as were the sides of the conning tower. Service history North Carolina, date unknown The keel for North Carolina was laid down at the Newport News Shipbuilding shipyard in Newport News, Virginia, on 21 March 1905. She was launched on 6 October 1906, and after completing fitting-out, was commissioned into the fleet on 7 May 1908. She thereafter began a shakedown cruise along the eastern coast of the United States, down to the Caribbean Sea. After returning to the United States, she embarked President William Howard Taft for a tour of the Panama Canal, then still under construction. The voyage lasted from January to February 1909. Starting on 23 April, North Carolina began a cruise in the Mediterranean Sea to protect United States citizens from domestic unrest in the Ottoman Empire. While in Adana on 17 May, the ship sent a landing party ashore to render medical aid to sick and wounded Armenians who had been attacked in an anti-Armenian massacre. North Carolina also sent food, water, and other supplies to help the situation, before continuing her patrol in the eastern Mediterranean. She returned to the United States on 3 August. For the next eight years, North Carolina conducted training exercises in the Atlantic Ocean and the Caribbean and visited other countries in the region to show the flag. She represented the United States at Argentina's centennial celebration of its independence in May and June 1910, followed by Venezuela's centennial in June and July 1911. She carried the United States Secretary of War, Henry L. Stimson, on a tour of the Caribbean, stopping in Puerto Rico, Santo Domingo, Cuba, and the Panama Canal in July and August 1911. She also assisted in the repatriations of remains from the armored cruiser , which had been destroyed in Havana, Cuba, in 1898. The rest of her early career passed uneventfully. On 7 August 1915, a year after World War I broke out in Europe, North Carolina was sent on a patrol in the Mediterranean to protect then still neutral United States citizens in the region. She visited Jaffa, Beirut, and Alexandria before returning to Boston on 18 June, where she underwent an overhaul. The ship thereafter went to Pensacola, Florida, where she arrived on 9 September, to conduct experiments with naval aviation. She became the first ship to launch an aircraft using a catapult while underway on 5 November; these tests led to the widespread use of aircraft catapults aboard battleships and cruisers through the 1940s. Following the United States' entry into World War I on 6 April 1917, North Carolina was employed as an escort for troop ships traveling between Norfolk and New York. Starting in December 1918, after the war had ended, she assisted in the repatriation of American soldiers from the American Expeditionary Force; this effort lasted until July 1919. On 7 June 1920, North Carolina was renamed Charlotte so that her name could be used for a new South Dakota-class battleship then under construction. Charlotte remained in service only briefly under her new name before being decommissioned on 18 February 1921 at the Puget Sound Navy Yard in Bremerton, Washington. She was stricken from the Naval Vessel Register on 15 July 1930 and was sold for scrap on 29 September. Footnotes References  * Further reading * Alden, John D.

History The mountain was named by George Mercer Dawson in 1884 after Sir Richard Temple who visited the Canadian Rockies that same year. Mt. Temple was the first peak to be climbed in the Canadian segment of the Rocky Mountains. Tragedy * On July 11, 1955, in one of Canada's most tragic mountaineering accidents, seven American male teenagers were killed on the southwest ridge route. A warm summer day had caused several nearby avalanches. They finally decided to turn back and during the descent, an avalanche swept 10 members of the party down the snowfield through a bottleneck of rocks. Unfortunately, the entire party only had one ice axe among them and were not well prepared for the seriousness of the route. The party had also gone up the route without either of their two group leaders. * On Sept. 25, 2015, Jen Kunze, an avid runner and hiker from Calgary, Ab. fell to her death.

Owned since the turn of the 20th century by the Holbourn family, the island was the location for the film The Edge of the World. RMS Oceanic was wrecked on the nearby Shaalds of Foula. Name The name \\"Foula\\" derives from Old Norse Fugley, \\"bird island\\": compare the Faroese name of the island of Fugloy, \\"bird island\\", and Scottish Gaelic Fughlaigh. Geography Foula lies in the Atlantic Ocean, west of Walls in Shetland. It was part of Walls civil parish. The island is about , with a low-lying coastal strip along the east side. With an area of , it is the seventh largest and most westerly of the Shetland Islands. It rises from low broken cliffs in the east to precipitous cliffs in the west. The island has five peaks, rising to at the Sneug and at the Kame. At the north end is Gaada Stack, a natural arch and towards the south-west is Da Sneck Ida Smaalie, a spectacular 30m deep and 2m wide crack in the cliffs.Walks on Foula - Lonely Planet Foula lies on the same latitude as Saint Petersburg. Foula has a population of 38 people, living in Hametun and Ham. Islanders previously made a living from fishing ‚Äì first for whitefish, then lobster. Today, most islanders are crofters with income from sheep farming and birdwatching tourism. A hidden reef, the 'Hoevdi Grund' or the Shaalds o' Foula, lies just over east of Foula between the island and the Shetland mainland. Tides here can reach and as the reef comes to within a few feet of the surface, it poses a significant threat to shipping.\\"Hoevdi Grund\\" Shetlopedia.

The New Advance carries up to 12 passengers and completes the voyage in about two hours. Flights take off from Foula's airstrip to Tingwall Airport. There is little shelter for boats in the island. The only beach is at the head of Ham Voe on the east coast. Local boats, including the mail boat, are hauled out of the water. Wildlife Cliffs in Foula. The island's cliffs are home to numerous birds, including Arctic terns, red-throated divers and great skuas. History =Prehistory= Foula was first inhabited as far back as 5,000 years ago. Between 2006 and 2008, the Bath & Camerton Archeological Society took several trips to Foula to study prehistoric standing stones. A particular sub-circular stone circle of interest was discovered in 2006 at Da Heights in the north of Foula. A further investigation launched in 2007 revealed that the sub-circular stone construction was man-made, elliptical in shape with the axis pointing towards the mid-winter solstice, built before 1000 BC.\\"The Foula Landscape Project: Da Heights Stones Survey and Investigation\\" (pdf) (June 2007) Bath and Camerton Archaeological Society. Retrieved 19 April 2012. =15th to 19th centuries= In 1490, the Ciske family's estates were divided and Vaila and Foula became the property of Alv Knutsson. However, the Ciskes were Norwegian, and as Scotland had annexed Shetland a few decades before, there were confusing and conflicting claims of ownership. Foula remained on the Julian calendar when the rest of the Kingdom of Great Britain adopted the Gregorian calendar in 1752. Foula adhered to the Julian calendar by keeping 1800 as a leap year, but it did not observe a leap year in 1900. As a result, Foula is now one day ahead of the Julian calendar and 12 days behind the Gregorian, observing Christmas Day on 6 January Gregorian and New Year on 13 January Gregorian.Keay, J. & Keay, J. (1994) Collins Encyclopaedia of Scotland. London. HarperCollins. In 1720, a smallpox epidemic struck the two hundred people living on Foula. Because the islanders were so isolated from the rest of the world, they had no immunity to smallpox, unlike most North European peoples at that time, and nine out of ten of the island's population died in the epidemic. The writer and journalist John Sands lived on Foula and Papa Stour for a while during the late 19th century. He fought hard against the prevailing truck system and drew political cartoons lampooning its deficiencies. In one, he drew Foula as a beautiful young woman being strangled by a boa-constrictor labelled 'landlordism' watched by other reptiles called 'missionary', 'laird' and 'truck'. Fleming credits the source of this information as The island was one of the last places where the Norn language was spoken (although it is claimed that Walter Sutherland of Skaw in Unst was the last speaker), and the local dialect is strongly influenced by Old Norse. =20th century= Ham in Foula. Professor Ian S. Holbourn, the last Laird of Foula, describes the disaster of 8 September 1914, when the White Star Line RMS Oceanic hit the Shaalds o' Foula, becoming a wreck within two weeks. Holbourn's remarkable luck with steamship travel held through the following May, when he embarked upon the RMS Lusitania (he survived its sinking). The professor's grandson, Robert Holbourn, a naval architect, acted as the island's \\"Peat Marshal\\" for many years. Peat is a valuable and scarce resource for heat and fuel in Shetland. Its cutting requires skill, taking several years to master. The most able islanders become known as the 'Cutters' and, in the spirit of a long-standing Foula tradition, all able-bodied men are now and then 'bid to the banks' of women who 'didn't have a cutter in the house.' Simon Martin, who stayed in Foula for five years during his prolonged claim upon the wrecked Oceanic, describes the island as follows: Foula post office in 1964 :\\"Foula, or Ultima Thule, as it was known as far back as the Roman times, rises impurely out of the water, and from the Shetland Isles mainland its five peaks, the Noup, Hamnafield, the Sneug, Kame and Soberlie stand out starkly and characteristically. The cliffs on the west side vie with those of St Kilda as the highest sheer cliffs in Britain, of solid rock towering from the sea. :\\"Foula, or Fughley as it was once also known, means literally 'Bird Island', with an estimated half million birds of various breeds sharing the rock with the inhabitants.

St Kilda lies in the Atlantic Ocean, west-northwest of North Uist in the Outer Hebrides; the inhabitants spoke Gaelic. Powell was unable to get permission to film in St Kilda. Undaunted, he made the film over four months during the summer of 1936 on Foula, where the islanders speak Shetland dialect. *Return To The Edge Of The World (1978) is a documentary capturing a reunion of The Edge Of The World (1937)'s cast and crew, 40 years later, as they revisit the island. =Folklore, festivities, and traditions= Foula's inhabitants preserve many Norse traditions of folklore and festivities.

She was built by the Newport News Drydock & Shipbuilding Co.; her keel was laid down in April 1905, she was launched in December 1906, and she was commissioned in July 1908. The final class of armored cruisers to be built for the US Navy, Montana and her sisters were armed with a main battery of four guns, and were capable of a top speed of . Montana spent her active duty career in the Atlantic Fleet. She made two cruises to the Mediterranean Sea to protect American citizens in the Ottoman Empire, the first in 1909 in the aftermath of the Young Turk Revolution and the second during the Balkan Wars in 1913. Montana was also involved in political unrest in Central American countries, sending landing parties ashore in Haiti and in Mexico during the Occupation of Veracruz, both in 1914. After the United States entered World War I in April 1917, Montana was tasked with convoy escort and training ship duties. With the end of the war in November 1918 came a new task, transporting American soldiers back from the battlefields of Europe. She made six round trips to France and carried back a total of 8,800 men. Montana was then transferred to the Puget Sound Naval Yard in Washington state, where she was decommissioned and renamed Missoula. She remained in the reserve fleet until 1930, when she was stricken under the terms of the London Naval Treaty. The ship was eventually sold for scrap in 1935 and broken up. Design Line-drawing of a Tennessee-class cruiser, with mid-ship cross section Montana was long overall and had beam of and a draft of . She displaced normally and up to at full load.Musicant, pp. 149-150 The ship was propelled by two 4-cylinder, vertical triple-expansion engines, with steam provided by sixteen coal-fired Babcock & Wilcox water-tube boilers trunked into four funnels. The engines were rated at , which produced a top speed of . She had a storage capacity for up to of coal, which allowed her to steam for at a speed of . She had a crew of 914 officers and men. Originally fitted with a pair of military masts, Montana had her foremast replaced with a cage mast in 1911.Friedman, p. 467Gardiner, p. 149 Montana was armed with a main battery of four 40-caliber Mark 3 guns in two twin gun turrets, one forward and one aft. These were supported by a secondary battery of sixteen 40-caliber Mark 8 guns mounted in casemates, eight on each broadside. For defense against torpedo boats, she carried twenty-two 50-caliber guns in single pedestal mounts either in casemates or sponsons in the hull. She also carried a variety of smaller guns, including twelve 3-pounder automatic guns and four 1-pounders. Like other contemporary armored cruisers, she was also armed with four torpedo tubes located below the waterline in her hull. Montana was protected by a combination of Krupp cemented steel and older Harvey steel. The ship's armored belt was thick and the maximum thickness of the armor deck was 3 in thick. The main battery turret faces were thick, as were the sides of the conning tower. Service history Montana on 4 May 1912 The keel for Montana was laid down at the Newport News Drydock & Shipbuilding Co. in Newport News on 29 April 1905. Her completed hull was launched on 15 December 1906, and after fitting-out work was completed, the new cruiser was commissioned into the United States Navy on 21 July 1908. She was assigned to the Atlantic Fleet and was transferred to Norfolk, Virginia. Montana steamed out of Norfolk on 5 August for a cruise off the eastern coast of the United States that lasted until 25 January 1909. On 8 October 1908 she put on a searchlight display as part of a fireworks display at Philadelphia. During the display her searchlights blinded the operator of Philadelphia Police Department steamer that then had a slight collision with a barge that \\"Visitor\\" was going to, to help put out a fire on board caused by malfunctioning fireworks. After a stop in Charleston, South Carolina, she continued south through the Caribbean Sea, arriving at Col√≥n, Panama on 29 January. There, she joined the Special Service Squadron. This duty was interrupted twice; the first came in February, when she returned to Hampton Roads, Virginia, where she and the rest of the Atlantic Fleet greeted the Great White Fleet at the conclusion of its circumnavigation of the globe. The second came in April, owing to instability in the Ottoman Empire following the Young Turk Revolution that threatened American interests. Montana departed Guantanamo Bay, Cuba, on 2 April, when she was sent to the Mediterranean to protect Americans in the region. She remained there until 23 July, when she left Gibraltar, arriving in Boston on 3 August. She thereafter returned to her normal operations patrolling the eastern coast of the United States. Montana departed Hampton Roads on 8 April 1910, bound for South America for the Argentina Centennial. She steamed in company with her sister ship , eventually reaching Maldonado, Uruguay, where the two cruisers met their sister and the armored cruiser , which had steamed down independently. The four ships then continued on to Bah√≠a Blanca, Argentina, for the centennial celebrations. The ship left Argentina on 30 June and arrived back in Hampton Roads on 22 July. After resuming her normal peacetime routine for the following three months, Montana was tasked with escorting President William Howard Taft aboard Tennessee for a trip to Panama. The two ships departed Charleston on 10 November for the visit, which lasted a week. On 26 July 1911, Montana was transferred to the Atlantic Reserve Fleet and she began an overhaul at the Portsmouth Navy Yard that lasted until 11 November 1912. During the overhaul, a cage mast was installed in place of her original fore military mast. Montana underway on 10 May 1914 After returning to service in late 1912, Montana made another trip to the eastern Mediterranean, departing in December. Montana again joined Tennessee for the patrol, which was ordered in response to the Balkan Wars between the Ottoman Empire and the Balkan League, which again threatened American interests in the region. The ships operated under the command of Rear Admiral Austin M. Knight.Page & Page, p. 421 During the trip, which lasted until June 1913, she made stops in Beirut, ƒ∞skenderun, and Mersin. After returning to the United States, the ship resumed her peacetime routine of training cruises off the American east coast, as well as cruises to Mexico, Cuba, and Haiti, over the following year. During this period, on 23 January 1914, Montana was in Haiti when Michel Oreste abdicated from the presidency. Montana and the German protected cruiser landed marines in Port-au-Prince to prevent rioting in the capital.Colby, p. 332 Later that year, for a few days between 28 AprilRoyal Navy Log Books of the World War 1 Era - HMS ESSEX and early May, Montana took part in the United States occupation of Veracruz, where the ship's commander, Louis McCoy Nulton, led a landing party in the city during the occupation. Montana also carried the remains on the seventeen sailors and marines who had been killed in the fighting back to New York City, arriving on 10 May. There, the Navy held a ceremony attended by President Woodrow Wilson and Secretary of the Navy Josephus Daniels. =World War I= Montana underway in 1918 in dazzle camouflage After the United States entered World War I on 6 April 1917, Montana initially was tasked with transporting men and materiel in the York River area, along with conducting training exercises. On 17 July, she was assigned to the Cruiser and Transport Force; she spent the majority of 1917 and 1918 escorting convoys from Hampton Roads, New York City, and Halifax, Nova Scotia to France. These operations included a troopship convoy of four transports‚Äî, , , and ‚Äîcarrying part of the American Expeditionary Forces on 6 August 1917.Crowell & Wilson, p. 603 In early 1918, she was briefly used as a training ship for naval cadets from the United States Naval Academy in the Chesapeake Bay.

These operations were interrupted in March 1919, when on 5 March Montana departed New York in company with the passenger ship , which was carrying Wilson back to France for the conclusion of the peace treaty negotiations. By July 1919, she had made six round trips between France and the United States, carrying a total of some 8,800 American soldiers. After the conclusion of the repatriation effort, Montana was transferred to the west coast of the United States. She arrived in the Puget Sound Navy Yard in Seattle on 16 August, where she remained until 2 February 1921, when she was decommissioned. During this period of inactivity, she was renamed Missoula on 7 June 1920 so her original name could be used for one of the planned South Dakota-class battleships, and she reclassified with the hull number CA-13. Though decommissioned in 1921, the ship remained in the Navy's inventory until 15 July 1930, when she was formally stricken from the naval register, according to the terms of the London Naval Treaty, which placed aggregate tonnage limits on the cruiser fleets of the signatory countries. She was sold to John Irwin Jr. on 29 September and was eventually broken up in 1935.

She was then assigned to the Naval Review Fleet as flagship of Rear Admiral Bancroft Gherardi. Charged with conducting the International Rendezvous and Review, with a fleet of twelve American ships, he received the visiting foreign ships as they commenced arrival in Hampton Roads on 8 April. The fleet steamed to New York 24 April, where it joined additional foreign visitors to form a combined fleet of 35 men-of-war. President Grover Cleveland reviewed the Fleet 27 April, after which appropriately festive ceremonies took place, initiating a parade through the streets of New York.

In March 1899, with Commander-in-Chief Rear Admiral Albert Kautz embarked, Philadelphia steamed to the Samoan Islands for duty in connection with the settlement of civil difficulties by the Samoan Commissioners of the United States, Great Britain, and Germany. A landing party from Philadelphia went ashore in the vicinity of Vailele 1 April to act in concert with a British landing party. The combined force, ambushed by adherents of Chief Mataafa, sustained seven killed and seven wounded, including two American officers, Lieutenant Philip Lansdale and Ensign John R. Monaghan, and two sailors killed, including Seaman Norman Edsall, and five bluejackets wounded. Philadelphia remained in the Samoan Islands until 21 May 1899, when she steamed for the west coast via Honolulu. Philadelphia served as flagship of the Pacific Station until 6 February 1900, when Rear Admiral Kautz transferred his flag to . The cruiser continued Pacific operations until 1902, conducting training cruises, drills, target practice, and port visits. Returning from a six-month cruise off the Panamanian coast, Philadelphia arrived San Francisco 17 July 1902. Needing extensive repairs, she was ordered to the Puget Sound Navy Yard for decommissioning. Arriving Bremerton, Washington 23 August, she decommissioned at Puget Sound 22 September 1902. = Receiving ship, 1904‚Äì1926 = Philadelphia was housed over and became a receiving ship at Puget Sound Navy Yard 12 May 1904. She continued this service until 4 November 1912, when she became a prison ship. Resuming service as a receiving ship 10 January 1916, she was redesignated with the hull number IX-24 (unclassified miscellaneous) on 17 July 1920. She was struck from the Navy List on 24 November 1926. Cruiser Philadelphia was sold at public auction at the Puget Sound Navy Yard in 1927 to Louis Rotherberg.

By tradition, he is credited with leading a large group to settle in Ireland. The tale is probably an invention of the Christian writers. \\"Parthol√≥n\\" comes from the Biblical name \\"Bartholomaeus\\" or \\"Bartholomew\\". The name may be borrowed from a character who appears in the Christian pseudo-histories of Saints Jerome and Isidore of Seville.Carey, John. The Irish National Origin-Legend: Synthetic Pseudohistory. University of Cambridge, 1994. p.9  Legend  Parthol√≥n was the leader of the second group of people to settle in Ireland, the 'Muintir Parthol√≥in' (People of Parthol√≥n). They arrived on the uninhabited island about 300 years after Noah's Flood and were believed responsible for introducing activities such as farming, cooking, brewing and building. After some years, they all succumbed to plague in one week. = Historia Brittonum = The earliest surviving reference to Parthol√≥n is in the Historia Brittonum, a 9th-century British Latin compilation attributed to Nennius. It says that Ireland was settled three times by three different groups, with 'Partholomus' and his followers arriving first from Iberia with a thousand followers who multiplied until they numbered four thousand before succumbing to the plague in a single week.Giles, J. A. (trans), \\"Nennius' History of the Britons\\" ¬ß13, Six Old English Chronicles, Bohn's Antiquarian Library, 1848 = Lebor Gab√°la √ârenn = The Lebor Gab√°la √ârenn, an 11th-century Christian pseudo-history of Ireland, states that Ireland was settled six times, with Parthol√≥n and his followers forming the second group. The number may have been chosen to match the \\"Six Ages of the World\\".Sjoestedt, Marie-Louise (1949). Celtic Gods and Heroes. Dover Publications, 2000. p.3 According to the Lebor Gab√°la, Ireland was uninhabited following the deaths of Cessair and her companions in the Flood. It says that Parthol√≥n came from Greece and was the son of Sera, son of Sru, who was himself a descendant of Magog, son of Japheth, who was the son of Noah. Parthol√≥n and his people sailed to Ireland via Sicily and Iberia, arriving 300 or 312 years after the flood and landing at Inber Sc√©ne (Kenmare in County Kerry). With Parthol√≥n were his wife (Delgnat), their three sons (Slanga, Rudraige and Laiglinne), the sons' wives (Nerba, Cichba and Cerbnad), and a thousand followers. Parthol√≥n and all of his people‚Äîfive thousand men and four thousand women‚Äîdied of the plague in a single week, on Senmag (the \\"old plain\\"), near modern Tallaght. = Foras Feasa ar √ârinn = Seathr√∫n C√©itinn's 17th-century compilation Foras Feasa ar √ârinn says they arrived in 2061 BC. It claims that Parthol√≥n was the son of Sera, the king of Greece, and fled his homeland after murdering his father and mother. He lost his left eye in the attack on his parents. He and his followers set off from Greece, sailed via Sicily and arrived in Ireland from the west, having traveled for two and a half months. According to C√©itinn, at the time of Parthol√≥n's arrival, Ireland consisted of one open plain, three lakes and nine rivers. Parthol√≥in cleared four more plains, and seven more lakes burst from the ground. Named figures are credited with having introduced cattle husbandry, ploughing, cooking, dwellings, trade and dividing the island into four parts. In C√©itinn's version of the story, at the Battle of Mag Itha, the first battle fought in Ireland, the Parthol√≥in battled and defeated the Fomorians, who were led by Cichol Gricenchos. A poem in the Lebor Gab√°la, expanded by C√©itinn, tells how Parthol√≥n and his wife, Delgnat, lived on a small island near the head of the estuary of the River Erne. Once, while Parthol√≥n was out touring his domain, Delgnat seduced a servant named Topa. Afterward, they drank from Parthol√≥n's ale, which could only be accessed through a golden tube. Parthol√≥n discovered the affair when he drank his ale and recognized the taste of Delgnat's and Topa's mouths on the tube. In anger, he killed Delgnat's dog and Topa. But Delgnat was unrepentant and insisted that Parthol√≥n was to blame, as leaving them alone together was like leaving honey before a woman, milk before a cat, edged tools before a craftsman, or meat before a child, and expecting them not to take advantage. This is recorded as the first case of adultery and the first jealousy in Ireland. The island in question was named Inis Saimera after Saimer, Delgnat's dog. = Annals of the Four Masters = The Annals of the Four Masters says they arrived in 2520 Anno Mundi (after the \\"creation of the world\\"). This work states that the plague came 300 years after their arrival, in May and that one man survived: Tuan, son of Parthol√≥n's brother Starn. Known as a legendary 'Seer', Tuan was said to be a storehouse of knowledge of Irish history because he lived across the generations in different forms of incarnations. Through a series of animal transformations, he survived through the centuries to be reborn as the son of a chieftain named Cairell in the time of Colm Cille (6th century). He remembered all he had seen, and thus preserved Parthol√≥n's story. = Geoffrey Keating = In Keating's History of Ireland' Partholon divides Ireland into four parts for his four sons named Er, Orba, Fearon, and Feargna.https://celt.ucc.ie//published/T100054/text012.html The History of Ireland by Geoffrey Keating = Others = Other accounts differ in the timing of Parthol√≥n's arrival in Ireland. Later sources say Parthol√≥n died there after thirty years in Ireland, and the rest of his people also died there of plague. Other medieval texts say they arrived in the 60th year of Abraham. Partholon's brother Tait was the great-grandfather of Nemed.

She was invited by Dwight Moody to study at his Northfield Seminary in Massachusetts, where she earned a reputation for pranks.Wilson, Dorothy Clark. The Story of Dr. Ida Scudder of Vellore, McGraw- Hill Book Company, Inc. Full text (1959), p. 18 Ida initially expected to get married and settle down and to have a family in the United States after seminary. In 1890, Ida went back to India to help her father when her mother was ailing at the mission bungalow at Tindivanam in the Madras Province. Ida had earlier expressed a resolve not to become a doctor or a medical missionary. But during her stay in India after her return from the US, she had a life-changing experience one night when she witnessed the death of three women who died during childbirth and was unable to help them during the trauma. These women did not want to be treated by male doctors due to their orthodox customs. As there were no female gynaecologists or even a female general physician, these three women could not be treated properly and therefore died. Witnessing the death of women due to lack of a female doctor convinced Ida Sophia that God wanted her to become a female physician to help women of India. She never married and stayed single throughout her life to fulfill her mission. She graduated from Cornell Medical College, New York City in 1899, as part of the first class that accepted women as medical students. She then headed back to India, fortified with a $10,000 grant from a Mr. Schell, a Manhattan banker, in memory of his wife. With this money, Ida started a tiny medical dispensary and clinic for women at Vellore, 75 miles from Madras. Her father died in 1900, soon after she arrived in India. In two years, she treated 5,000 patients. Christian Medical College, Vellore Ida S.

Her decision was viewed skeptically by some and it was told that that Ida would have consider herself lucky even if she got at least three women applicants. On the contrary, Ida got 151 applications the first year (1918) and had to turn many away subsequently. At first, the Reformed Church in America was the main backer of the Vellore school, but after Dr. Scudder agreed to make it coeducational, it eventually gained the support of 40 missions.

History Wyoming entered the Union in 1890. As a territory, inmates were held at the Wyoming Territorial Prison at Laramie. Work began for a state prison at Rawlins in 1888, but the facility did not open until 1901. The building had 104 cells and housed both male and female inmates. In 1909, female inmates were transported to Colorado to serve their sentences. In 1950 an additional wing was added that featured running water and solitary confinement cells. This jail was in use until 1980. when the present state penitentiary was built. In 1912, a riot resulted in the escape of twenty-seven inmates and the death of one local man. A gas chamber was added in 1936. Five men were killed there. The original cell block gained running water in 1978. In November 1990 Wyoming voters approved a constitutional amendment that abolished the Wyoming State Board of Charities and Reform. The institutions of the former state agency were divided and given to other agencies; the Department of Corrections, created in 1991, took responsibility of the adult correctional facilities and also absorbed the adult parole functions of the Wyoming Department of Probation and Parole.\\"About the Department of Corrections\\".

On or near January 1, 2000, a series of Islamist terrorist attacks linked to al-Qaeda were planned to occur in the context of millennium celebrations, including bombing plots against four tourist sites in Jordan, against the Los Angeles International Airport (LAX) and , and the hijacking of Indian Airlines Flight 814.\\"Planned Jan. 2000 Attacks Failed or Were Thwarted; Plot Targeted U.S., Jordan, American Warship, Official Says\\", Vernon Loeb, The Washington Post, December 24, 2000 (mirrored at ) In Lebanon, dozens were killed in clashes in the Dinnieh district between radical Islamists with connections to the Jordan plots and the Lebanese Army. The plots in Jordan and against LAX were foiled by law enforcement agencies, while the attempted bombing of The Sullivans only failed because the boat filled with explosives sank before detonating. The revelation of the plot linked to the LAX \\"Millennium Bomber\\" Ahmed Ressam led to unprecedented investigations into possible other terrorist cells in the United States, dubbed Operation \\"Borderbom\\", and security measures around millennium celebrations. Other al-Qaeda-linked millennium attack plots may have been planned or foiled around the same time. Millennium attack plots =Jordan bombing plots= In Jordan, members of the Islamist terror organization al-Qaeda planned to bomb four sites: a fully booked Radisson hotel in Amman, Jordan; the border between Jordan and Israel; Mount Nebo, a Christian holy site; and a site on the Jordan River where John the Baptist is said to have baptized Jesus. These locations were chosen to target tourists from the United States and Israel. The most active participant was a Boston taxi driver named Raed Hijazi. On November 30, 1999, Jordanian intelligence intercepted a call between Saudi citizen Abu Zubaydah, the leader of the plot, and Khadr Abu Hoshar, a Palestinian militant terrorist. In the conversation, Zubaydah stated, \\"The time for training is over.\\" Sensing that the attack was imminent, Jordanian police arrested Hoshar and fifteen others on December 12, 1999. The authorities put twenty-eight suspects on trial. Twenty-two of them were quickly found guilty. Six of them, thought to be linked to Osama bin Laden, including Hijazi, were sentenced to death. Abu Zubaydah was sentenced to death in absentia. Luai Sakra and Abu Musab al-Zarqawi were sentenced in absentia in 2002 for their part in the plot, which included using poison gas during the bombing. =LAX bombing plot= MV Coho while attempting to cross into the US at Port Angeles. Ahmed Ressam, an Algerian citizen living in Montreal, Canada, confessed after interrogation to having planned to bomb the Los Angeles International Airport (LAX) on New Year's Eve. He was arrested by U.S. Customs and Border Protection (CBP) officer Diana Dean at Port Angeles, Washington, a U.S. port of entry, on December 14, 1999. Customs officials found a cache of explosives that could have produced \\"a blast forty times greater than that of a devastating car bomb\\" and four timing devices hidden in the spare tire well in the trunk of the rented car in which he had traveled from Canada. Ressam later asserted that the plot was facilitated by Zubaydah and known to bin Laden. The Federal Bureau of Investigation (FBI) conducted door-to-door interviews of up to 50 individuals across the country, made \\"dozens of arrests\\" as part of investigations into possible other individuals linked to the case, and reportedly \\"questioned hundreds of Muslims from Los Angeles to Boston, wiretapped hundreds of conversations, and put hundreds of individuals under surveillance\\". Abdelghani Meskini, a known criminal was arrested in Brooklyn, New York on December 30 by Joint Terrorism Task Force for his links to Ressam. In New York and Boston, nine other Algerians linked to Meskini were arrested by the FBI, as part of the largest counter-terrorism operation ever conducted in the United States, dubbed Operation \\"Borderbom\\". Most, including Meskini faced minor charges after no significant terrorism links could be proven, although a main suspected bomb-making accomplice, Abdelmajid Dahoumane had fled the country. Other suspected targets alleged by Central Intelligence Agency (CIA) sources included the Seattle Space Needle and Disneyland, California, with maps found with circles around \\"three California airports‚ÄîLos Angeles International, Long Beach and Ontario‚Äîas well as maps with San Francisco's landmark Transamerica building and Seattle's Space Needle.\\" Ressam began cooperating with investigators in 2001. He was initially sentenced to 22 years in prison, but in 2010 an appellate court reversed and remanded the case based on procedural errors and recommended that his sentence be extended. He was re-sentenced to 37 years' imprisonment in 2012.'Millennium bomber' Ahmed Ressam given longer sentence, BBC News, 24 October 2012 Another Algerian-Canadian, Mokhtar Haouari was sentenced to 24 years imprisonment for assisting Ressam in the plot. Abu Doha was indicted for the plot, but was denied extradition from the United Kingdom. =Hijacking of Indian Airlines Flight 814= Indian Airlines Flight 814, en route from Nepal to India was hijacked on December 24, 1999 by five militants of the al-Qaeda- linked Harkat-ul-Mujahideen group. The hijackers reportedly told the captain, \\"Fly slowly, fly carefully, there is no hurry. We have to give India a millennium gift,\\" as a bomb in the cargo room of the plane was timed to go off at midnight, December 31, 1999. The plane eventually landed in Taliban- controlled Kandahar, Afghanistan. On December 31, India agreed to release three captive militants in exchange for the nearly 200 passengers and crew that were being held hostage. =Lebanon and Syria clashes= On December 31, 1999, attacks were launched by a group of up to 300 radical Islamists against Lebanese Army forces in the Dinnieh district in northern Lebanon. The group behind the attack, calling itself after the apocalyptic Takfir wal-Hijra group was led by Bassam Kanj, a close associate of Raed Hijazi who had been indicted for his involvement in the Jordan bombing plots. Kanj had met Hijazi in the Khalden training camp in Afghanistan, and they later worked for the same Boston taxi company in the United States in the 1990s. The fighting lasted for eight days, and killed eleven soldiers, five civilians, and 28 Islamists. Lebanon being under Syrian occupation at the time, the Lebanon clashes followed clashes in Syria between Syrian security forces and Islamists, some of whom were accused of infiltrating the country from Jordan and Saudi Arabia, that began on 30 December when several Syrian intelligence agents were ambushed and killed. The clashes lasted for four days in Damascus, Homs and nearby villages, and the Hizb ut-Tahrir group claimed that 1,200 of its members had been arrested by January 2000. =USS The Sullivans bombing attempt= In Yemen, members of al-Qaeda attempted to bomb the warship while it was refueling in Aden with a boat laden with explosives. Terrorists deployed a bomb-laden boat on January 3, 2000, but the over-loaded bomb boat sank before detonating. (PDF version)\\"Against All Enemies: Inside America's War on Terror\\" Richard A. Clarke. Jamal Ahmad Mohammad Al Badawi and Fahd al- Quso were charged in absentia in 2003 for their alleged roles in several terrorist acts, including the attempted bombing of The Sullivans. In 2011, Abd al-Rahim al-Nashiri, held in Guantanamo, was charged with planning the attack on The Sullivans along with other attacks, facing death penalty. =Other plots= According to National Security Advisor of the Clinton administration, Sandy Berger, terrorist cells had been disrupted in \\"eight countries\\" in the weeks before New Year's Eve, which was said to have \\"almost certainly\\" prevented additional attacks. The man behind the LAX plot, Ahmed Ressam, claimed there had been plans by other terrorist cells of millennium attacks \\"in Europe, in the Gulf, against U.S. and Israel.\\" Major security operations were launched to improve security for the millennium celebrations in Times Square, New York, along with several other cities in the United States and Europe. In anticipation of the turn to the new millennium, official concerns by the FBI and U.S. authorities had focused on purported Islamic Terrorism by \\"apocalyptic\\" Islamic terrorists, Islamic political groups, or radical elements of Islamic militias. Aftermath =Investigation= While in prison, Ressam revealed that al-Qaeda sleeper cells existed within the United States. This information was included in the President's Daily Brief delivered to President George W. Bush on August 6, 2001, entitled Bin Laden Determined To Strike in US. FBI special agent and counter-terrorism chief John P. O'Neill, who had been central in the investigation of al-Qaeda in the late 1990s and the millennium plot, and subsequently suspected the existence of sleeper cells in the United States, died in the September 11 attacks in 2001 as head of security of the World Trade Center. O'Neill had started his new job on August 23 less than a month before the attack, after he had been squeezed out of the bureau. On July 19, 2004, it was revealed that the U.S. Justice Department was investigating former National Security Advisor of the Clinton administration, Sandy Berger, for unauthorized removal of classified documents in October 2003 from a National Archives reading room prior to testifying before the 9/11 Commission. The documents were five classified copies of a single report commissioned from Richard A. Clarke, covering internal assessments of the Clinton administration's handling of the plots. An associate of Berger said Berger took one copy in September 2003 and four copies in October 2003. =Attacks= After the unsuccessful attack on USS The Sullivans, al-Qaeda attempted the same type of attack for a second time, again in Aden, Yemen. They successfully bombed on October 12, 2000, in an attack that claimed the lives of seventeen U.S. sailors.

Symptoms typically include local pain and redness. There is often an associated fever and general soreness. Onset is typically fairly rapid and usually occurs within the first few months of delivery. Complications can include abscess formation. Risk factors include poor latch, cracked nipples, use of a breast pump, and weaning. The bacteria most commonly involved are Staphylococcus and Streptococci. Diagnosis is typically based on symptoms. Ultrasound may be useful for detecting a potential abscess. Prevention is by proper breastfeeding techniques. When infection is present, antibiotics such as cephalexin may be recommended. Breastfeeding should typically be continued, as emptying the breast is important for healing. Tentative evidence supports benefits from probiotics. About 10% of breastfeeding women are affected. Signs and symptoms Mastitis localized on the underside of the breast, with a large area of inflammation. Lactation mastitis usually affects only one breast and the symptoms can develop quickly. The signs and symptoms usually appear suddenly and they include: * Breast tenderness or warmth to the touch * General malaise or feeling ill * Swelling of the breast * Pain or a burning sensation continuously or while breast- feeding * Skin redness, often in a wedge-shaped pattern * Fever of 101 F (38.3 C) or greater * The affected breast can then start to appear lumpy and red. Some women may also experience flu-like symptoms such as: * Aches * Shivering and chills * Feeling anxious or stressed * Fatigue Contact should be made with a health care provider with special breastfeeding competence as soon as the patient recognizes the combination of signs and symptoms. Most of the women first experience the flu-like symptoms and just after they may notice a sore red area on the breast. Also, women should seek medical care if they notice any abnormal discharge from the nipples, if breast pain is making it difficult to function each day, or they have prolonged, unexplained breast pain. =Breast abscess= A breast abscess is a collection of pus that develops into the breast with different causes. During lactation, breast abscess develops only rarely, most sources cite about 0.4‚Äì0.5% of breastfeeding women. Known risk factors are age over 30, primiparous and late delivery. No correlation was found with smoking status however this may be in part because much fewer smoking women choose to breastfeed. Antibiotics were not shown effective in prevention of lactation abscess but are useful to treat a secondary infection (see the section on the treatment of breast abscess in this article). Keratinizing squamous metaplasia of lactiferous ducts may play a similar role in the pathogenesis of nonpuerperal subareolar abscess. Causes Since the 1980s mastitis has often been divided into non-infectious and infectious sub-groups. However, recent research suggests that it may not be feasible to make divisions in this way. It has been shown that types and amounts of potentially pathogenic bacteria in breast milk are not correlated to the severity of symptoms. Moreover, although only 15% of women with mastitis in Kvist et al.'s study were given antibiotics, all recovered and few had recurring symptoms. Many healthy breastfeeding women wishing to donate breast milk have potentially pathogenic bacteria in their milk but have no symptoms of mastitis. =Risk factors= Mastitis typically develops when the milk is not properly removed from the breast. Milk stasis can lead to the milk ducts in the breasts becoming blocked, as the breast milk is not being properly and regularly expressed. It has also been suggested that blocked milk ducts can occur as a result of pressure on the breast, such as tight-fitting clothing or an over-restrictive bra, although there is sparse evidence for this supposition. Mastitis may occur when the baby is not appropriately attached to the breast while feeding, when the baby has infrequent feeds or has problems suckling the milk out of the breast. The presence of cracks or sores on the nipples increases the likelihood of infection. Tight clothing or ill-fitting bras may also cause problems as they compress the breasts. There is a possibility that infants carrying infectious pathogens in their noses can infect their mothers; the clinical significance of this finding is still unknown. Mastitis, as well as breast abscess, can also be caused by direct trauma to the breast. Such injury can occur for example during sports activities or due to seat belt injury. Mastitis can also develop due to contamination of a breast implant or any other foreign body, for example after nipple piercing. In such cases, the removal of the foreign body is indicated.Mastitis and breast abscess, BMJ Best Practice (last updated 5 September 2014) (subscription-limited access) Women who are breastfeeding are at risk for developing mastitis especially if they have sore or cracked nipples or have had mastitis before while breastfeeding another baby. Also, the chances of getting mastitis increases if women use only one position to breastfeed or wear a tight-fitting bra, which may restrict milk flow Difficulties in getting a nursing infant to latch on to the breast can also increase the risk for mastitis. Women with diabetes, chronic illness, AIDS, or an impaired immune system may be more susceptible to the development of mastitis. =Infection= Some women (approximately 15%) will require antibiotic treatment for infection which is usually caused by bacteria from the skin or the baby's mouth that entering the milk ducts through skin lesions of the nipple or through the opening of the nipple. Infection is usually caused by Staphylococcus aureus. Infectious pathogens commonly associated with mastitis are Staphylococcus aureus, Streptococcus spp., and Gram-negative bacilli such as Escherichia coli. Salmonella spp., mycobacteria, and fungi such as Candida and Cryptococcus have been identified in rare instances. Recent research suggests that infectious pathogens play a much smaller role in the pathogenesis than was commonly assumed only a few years ago. Most detected pathogens are very common species that are natural part of the breast fauna and simple detection of their presence is not sufficient to prove a causative role. Furthermore, there are indications that treatment with antibiotics may have minimal impact, and over-all there is insufficient evidence to confirm or refute the effectiveness of antibiotic therapy for treating lactational mastitis.Antibiotics for mastitis in breastfeeding women. Cochrane Database of Systematic Reviews, PubMed Health. Review published 2013; Review content assessed as up-to-date: November 23, 2012. Types When it occurs in breastfeeding mothers, it is known as puerperal mastitis, lactation mastitis, or lactational mastitis. When it occurs in non breastfeeding women it is known as non-puerperal or nonlactational. Mastitis can, in rare cases, occur in men. Inflammatory breast cancer has symptoms very similar to mastitis and must be ruled out. The symptoms are similar for puerperal and nonpuerperal mastitis but predisposing factors and treatment can be very different. =Pregnancy related= An ultrasound image of puerperal mastitis Puerperal mastitis is the inflammation of the breast in connection with pregnancy, breastfeeding or weaning. Since one of the most prominent symptoms is tension and engorgement of the breast, it is thought to be caused by blocked milk ducts or milk excess. It is relatively common; estimates range depending on methodology between 5‚Äì33%. However, only about 0.4‚Äì0.5% of breastfeeding mothers develop an abscess. Some predisposing factors are known but their predictive value is minimal. It appears that proper breastfeeding technique, frequent breastfeeding and avoidance of stress are the most important factors that can be influenced. Light cases of mastitis are often called breast engorgement; the distinction is overlapping and possibly arbitrary or subject to regional variations. =Non pregnancy related= The term nonpuerperal mastitis describes inflammatory lesions of the breast occurring unrelated to pregnancy and breastfeeding. This article includes description of mastitis as well as various kinds of mammary abscesses. Skin related conditions like dermatitis and foliculitis are a separate entity. Names for non-puerperal mastitis are not used very consistently and include mastitis, subareolar abscess, duct ectasia, periductal inflammation, Zuska's disease and others. Periductal mastitis is a form of nonlactational mastitis, and is characterized by inflammation of the subareolar ducts. Although the cause of periductal mastitis is currently unknown, it is predicted that smoking may be related. This condition is mainly seen in young women but can also be seen in men. Diagnosis The diagnosis of mastitis and breast abscess can usually be made based on a physical examination. The doctor will also take into account the signs and symptoms of the condition. However, if the doctor is not sure whether the mass is an abscess or a tumor, a breast ultrasound may be performed. The ultrasound provides a clear image of the breast tissue and may be helpful in distinguishing between simple mastitis and abscess or in diagnosing an abscess deep in the breast. The test consists of placing an ultrasound probe over the breast. In cases of infectious mastitis, cultures may be needed in order to determine what type of organism is causing the infection. Cultures are helpful in deciding the specific type of antibiotics that will be used in curing the disease. These cultures may be taken either from the breast milk or of the material aspirated from an abscess. Mammograms or breast biopsies are normally performed on women who do not respond to treatment or on non-breastfeeding women. This type of tests is sometimes ordered to exclude the possibility of a rare type of breast cancer which causes symptoms similar to those of mastitis. =Differential diagnosis= Breast cancer may coincide with or mimic symptoms of mastitis. Only full resolution of symptoms and careful examination are sufficient to exclude the diagnosis of breast cancer. Lifetime risk for breast cancer is significantly reduced for women who were pregnant and breastfeeding. Mastitis episodes do not appear to influence lifetime risk of breast cancer. Mastitis does however cause great difficulties in diagnosis of breast cancer and delayed diagnosis and treatment can result in worse outcome. Breast cancer may coincide with mastitis or develop shortly afterwards. All suspicious symptoms that do not completely disappear within 5 weeks must be investigated. Breast cancer incidence during pregnancy and lactation is assumed to be the same as in controls. Course and prognosis are also very similar to age matched controls. However diagnosis during lactation is particularly problematic, often leading to delayed diagnosis and treatment. Some data suggest that noninflammatory breast cancer incidence is increased within a year following episodes of nonpuerperal mastitis and special care is required for follow-up cancer prevention screening. So far only data from short term observation is available and total risk increase can not be judged. Because of the very short time between presentation of mastitis and breast cancer in this study it is considered very unlikely that the inflammation had any substantial role in carcinogenesis, rather it would appear that some precancerous lesions may increase the risk of inflammation (hyperplasia causing duct obstruction, hypersensitivity to cytokines or hormones) or the lesions may have common predisposing factors. A very serious type of breast cancer called inflammatory breast cancer presents with similar symptoms as mastitis (both puerperal and nonpuerperal). It is the most aggressive type of breast cancer with the highest mortality rate. The inflammatory phenotype of IBC is thought to be mostly caused by invasion and blocking of dermal lymphatics, however it was recently shown that NF-Œ∫B target genes activation may significantly contribute to the inflammatory phenotype. Case reports show that inflammatory breast cancer symptoms can flare up following injury or inflammation making it even more likely to be mistaken for mastitis. Symptoms are also known to partially respond to progesterone and antibiotics, reaction to other common medications can not be ruled out at this point. Treatment In lactation mastitis, frequent emptying of both breasts by breastfeeding is essential. Also essential is adequate fluid supply for the mother and baby. For breastfeeding women with light mastitis, massage and application of heat prior to feeding can help as this may aid unblocking the ducts. However, in more severe cases of mastitis heat or massage could make the symptoms worse and cold compresses are better suited to contain the inflammation. Nonpuerperal mastitis is treated by medication and possibly aspiration or drainage (see in particular treatment of subareolar abscess and treatment of granulomatous mastitis). According to a BMJ best practice report, antibiotics are generally to be used in all nonpuerperal mastitis cases, with replacement of the antibiotics by an antifungal agent such as fluconazole in cases of deep fungal infections, and corticosteroids are to be used in case of granulomatous mastitis (with differential diagnosis to tuberculosis infection of the breast). In idiopathic granulomatous mastitis, successful treatment includes invasive surgical procedures or less invasive treatment with steroid medications. =Antibiotics= In lactational mastitis, antibiotics are not needed in the overwhelming majority of cases and should be used only for bacterial infections. For people with nonsevere infections, dicloxacillin or cephalexin are recommended. For people with severe infections, vancomycin is recommended. The length of antibiotic treatment ranges anywhere from 5‚Äì14 days. The effects of antibiotics has not been well studied as of 2013. = Breast abscess = An abscess (or suspected abscess) in the breast may be treated by ultrasound- guided fine-needle aspiration (percutaneous aspiration) or by surgical incision and drainage; each of these approaches is performed under antibiotic coverage. In case of puerperal breast abscess, breastfeeding from the affected breast should be continued where possible., p. 1684 For small breast abscesses, ultrasound-guided fine needle aspiration such as to completely drain the abscess is widely recognized as a preferred initial management. One recommended treatment includes antibiotics, ultrasound evaluation and, if fluid is present, ultrasound-guided fine needle aspiration of the abscess with an 18 gauge needle, under saline lavage until clear., Fig. 9 on p. 1696 The exudate is then sent for microbiological analysis for identification of the pathogen and determination of its antibiotic sensitivity profile,, p. 1691 which may in turn give an indication for changing the antibiotics. At follow- up, a mammography is performed if the condition has resolved; otherwise the ultrasound-guided fine-needle aspiration with lavage and microbiological analysis is repeated., p. 1692‚Äì1693 If three to five aspirations still do not resolve the condition, percutaneous drainage in combination with placement of an indwelling catheter is indicated, and only if several attempts at ultrasound-guided drainage fail, surgical resection of the inflamed lactiferous ducts (preferably performed after the acute episode is over)., p. 1694 It is noted, however, that even the excision of the affected ducts does not necessarily prevent recurrence. Nonpuerperal breast abscesses have a higher rate of recurrence compared to puerperal breast abscesses., abstract There is a high statistical correlation of nonpuerperal breast abscess with diabetes mellitus (DM). On this basis, it has recently been suggested that diabetes screening should be performed on patients with such abscess. Although there are a number of recommendations regarding the treatment of breast abscesses, a 2015 review found not enough evidence regarding if needle aspiration is comparable to incision and drainage, or if antibiotics should generally be given to women undergoing incision and drainage. Prognosis Temperature and severity of symptoms at presentation do not predict outcome; women with sore or damaged nipples may need special attention. Epidemiology Mastitis is quite common among breastfeeding women. The WHO estimates that although incidences vary between 2.6% and 33%, the prevalence globally is approximately 10% of breastfeeding women. Most mothers who develop mastitis usually do so within the first few weeks after delivery. Most breast infections occur within the first or second month after delivery or at the time of weaning. However, in rare cases it affects women who are not breastfeeding.  Terminology  Popular usage of the term mastitis varies by geographic region. Outside the US it is commonly used for puerperal and nonpuerperal cases, in the US the term nonpuerperal mastitis is rarely used and alternative names such as duct ectasia, subareolar abscess and plasma cell mastitis are more frequently used. Chronic cystic mastitis is an older name for fibrocystic disease. American usage: mastitis usually refers to puerperal (occurring to breastfeeding mothers) mastitis with symptoms of systemic infection. Lighter cases of puerperal mastitis are often called breast engorgement. In this Wikipedia article, \\"mastitis\\" is used in the original sense of the definition as inflammation of the breast with additional qualifiers where appropriate. =Etymology and pronunciation= The word mastitis () uses combining forms of mast- + -itis. The word mammitis () uses combining forms of mamm- + -itis. They are synonymous in modern usage, and mastitis is the more commonly used synonym. Other animals Mastitis occurs in other animals as in humans, and is especially a concern in livestock, since milk from the affected udders of livestock may enter the food supply and pose a health risk. It is a major condition in some species, like dairy cows. It is the cause of much unwanted suffering for the dairy cows. It is of tremendous economic importance for the dairy industry, and it is also of concern for public health. The same considerations apply to mastitis in sheep and goats and other milk-producing females. It is also of economic importance in the sow, but, in this species, it is not related to public health. In other domestic females (queen, mare, etc.), it is more an individual illness dealt with by veterinary practitioners.

Recent research suggests that this species and some other East Asian members of Luscinia should be classified in a new genus, together with the Japanese and Ry≈´ky≈´ robins. The genus name Larvivora comes from the new Latin larva meaning caterpillar and -vorus meaning eating (vorace to devour), and cyane is Latin for \\"dark-blue\\". This bird is a migratory insectivorous species breeding in the eastern Palearctic from Siberia and northern Mongolia, northeastern China, Korea and across to Japan. It winters in southern and south-eastern Asia and Indonesia. The breeding habitat is coniferous forest with dense undergrowth, often beside rivers or at woodland edges. It feeds on the ground but is very 'skulking'. In winter, this bird also tends to stay in dense vegetation. This species is larger than the European robin. The breeding male is unmistakable with blue upperparts and white underparts. The female is much drabber, with brown upperparts and whitish underparts. Her dark eye stands out against the paler brown face. This species is a very rare vagrant to Europe, and has vagrant status even as far east as Pakistan. The Siberian blue robin was previously placed in the genus Luscinia. A large molecular phylogenetic study published in 2010 found that Luscinia was not monophyletic. The genus was therefore split and several species including the Siberian blue robin were moved to the reinstated genus Larvivora.

Greek  The first record of Sialkot dates from the invasion of Alexander the Great, who conquered upper Punjab in 326 BCE. The Anabasis of Alexander, written by the Roman-Greek historian Arrian, recorded that Alexander captured ancient Sialkot, recorded as Sagala, from the Cathaeans, who had entrenched themselves there. The city had been home to 80,000 residents on the eve of Alexander's invasion, but was razed as a warning against any other nearby cities that might resist his invasion. =Indo-Greek= The ancient city was rebuilt, and made capital by the Indo-Greek king Menander I, of the Euthydemid dynasty, who ruled between 135 and 160 BCE. The rebuilt city was shifted slightly from the older city, as rebuilding on exactly the same spot was considered inauspicious. Under Menander's rule, the city greatly prospered as a major trading centre renowned for its silk. Menander embraced Buddhism, in a process recorded in the Buddhist text Milinda Panha. The text offers an early description of the city's cityscape and status as a prosperous trade centre with numerous green spaces. Following his conversion, Sialkot developed as a major centre for Buddhist though. Ancient Sialkot was recorded by Ptolemy in his 1st century CE work, Geography, in which he refers to the city as Euthymedeia (ŒïœçŒ∏œÖŒºŒ≠Œ¥ŒµŒπŒ±).  White Huns  Around 460 CE, the Hephthalites, also known as the White Huns, invaded the region from Central Asia, forcing the ruling family of nearby Taxila to seek refuge in Sialkot. Sialkot itself was soon captured, and the city was made capital of the Hephthalite Empire around 515, during the reign of Toramana. During the reign of his son, Mihirakula, the Hephthalite Empire reached its zenith. The Hepthalites were defeated in 528 by a coalition of princes led by Prince Yasodhara.  Late antiquity  The city was visited by the Chinese traveller Xuanzang in 633, who recorded the city's name as She-kie-lo. Xuanzang reported that the city had been rebuilt approximately 15 li, or 2.5 miles, away from the city ruined by Alexander the Great. During this time, Sialkot served as the political nucleus of the Punjab region. The city was then invaded in 643 by Rajput princes from Jammu, who held the city until the Muslim invasions during the medieval era. =Medieval= Around the year 1000, Sialkot began to decline in importance as the nearby city of Lahore rose to prominence. Following to fall of Lahore to the Ghaznavid Empire in the early 11th century, the capital of the Hindu Shahi empire was shifted from Lahore to Sialkot. Ghaznavid expansion in northern Punjab encouraged local Khokhar tribes to stop paying tribute to the Rajas of Jammu. Sialkot became a part of the medieval Sultanate of Delhi after Muhammad Ghauri conquered Punjab in 1185. Ghauri was unable to conquer the larger city of Lahore, but deemed Sialkot important enough to warrant a garrison. He also extensively repaired the Sialkot Fort around the time of his conquest of Punjab, and left the region in charge of Hussain Churmali while he returned to Ghazni. Sialkot was then quickly laid siege to by Khokhar tribesmen, and Khusrau Malik, the last Ghaznavid sultan, though he was defeated during Ghauri's return to Punjab in 1186. In the 1200s, Sialkot was the only area of western Punjab that was ruled by the Mamluk Sultanate in Delhi. The area had been captured by the Ghauri prince Yildiz, but was recaptured by Sultan Iltutmish in 1217. Around 1223, Jalal ad-Din Mingburnu, the last king of the Khwarazmian dynasty of Central Asia that had fled invasion of Genghis Khan there, briefly captured Sialkot and Lahore, before being driven out by Iltutmish's forces towards Uch Sharif. During the 13th century, Imam Ali-ul-Haq, Sialkot's most revered Sufi warrior- saint, arrived from Arabia, and began his missionary work in the region that successfully converted large numbers of Hindus to Islam, thereby transforming Sialkot into a largely Muslim city. The saint later died in battle, and is revered as a martyr. Sialkot fell to Shaykha Khokhar around 1414. Sialkot's population continued to grow in the 1400s under the rule of Sultan Bahlul Lodi, who had granted custodianship of the city to Jammu's Raja Biram Dev, after he helped Lodhi defeat the Khokhars. Sialkot was sacked during the Lodhi period by Malik Tazi Bhat of Kashmir, who attacked Sialkot after the governor of Punjab, Tatar Khan, had left the city undefended during one of his military campaigns. Sialkot was captured by armies of the Babur in 1520, when the Mughal commander Usman Ghani Raza advanced towards Delhi during the initial conquest of Babur. Babur recorded a battle with Gujjar raiders, who had attacked Sialkot, and allegedly mistreated its inhabitants. In 1525‚Äì1526, Alam Khan, uncle of Sultan Ibrahim Lodi, invaded from Afghanistan, and was able to capture Sialkot with the aid of Mongol forces. =Pre-modern= Mughal  During the early Mughal era, Sialkot was made part of the subah, or \\"province,\\" of Lahore. According to Sikh tradition, Guru Nanak, the founder of Sikhism, visited the city,Dhillon, Iqbal S. (1998). Folk Dances of Panjab. Delhi: National Book Shop. sometime in the early 16th century. He is said to have met Hamza Ghaus, a prominent Sufi mystic based in Sialkot, at a site now commemorated by the city's Gurdwara Beri Sahib. During the Akbar era, Sialkot's pargana territory was placed in the jagir custodianship of Raja Man Singh, who would repair the city's fort, and sought to increase its population and develop its economy. In 1580 Yousuf Shah Chak of Kashmir sought refuge in the city during his exile from the Valley of Kashmir. Paper-makers from Kashmir migrated to the city during the Akbar period, and Sialkot later became renowned as the source of the prized Mughal Hariri paper - known for its brilliant whiteness and strength. The city's metalworkers also provided the Mughal crown with much of its weaponry. During the reign of Jahangir, the post was given to Safdar Khan, who rebuilt the city's fort, and oversaw a further increase in Sialkot's prosperity. Numerous fine houses and gardens were built in the city during the Jehangir period. During the Shah Jahan period, the city was placed under the rule of Ali Mardan Khan. The last great Mughal emperor, Aurangzeb, appointed Ganga Dhar as faujdar of the city until 1654. Rahmat Khan was then placed in charge of the city, and would build a mosque in the city. Under Aurangzeb's reign, Sialkot became known as a great centre of Islamic thought and scholarship, and attracted scholars because of the widespread availability of paper in the city. Post-Mughal  Following the decline of the Mughal empire after the death of Emperor Aurangzeb in 1707, Sialkot and its outlying districts were left undefended and forced to defend itself. In 1739, the city was captured by Nader Shah of Persia during his invasion of the Mughal Empire. The city was placed under the governorship of Zakariya Khan, the Mughal Viceroy of Lahore, who in return for the city promised to pay tribute to the Persian crown. In the wake of the Persian invasion, Sialkot fell under the control of Pashtun powerful families from Multan and Afghanistan - the Kakayzais and Sherwanis. Sialkot was crept upon by Ranjit Deo of Jammu, who pledged nominal allegiance to the Mughal crown in Delhi. Ranjit Deo did not conquer Sialkot city from the Pashtun families which held the city, but switched allegiance to the Pashtun ruler Ahmed Shah Durrani in 1748, effectively ending Mughal influence in Sialkot. The city and three nearby districts were amalgamated into the Durrani Empire.  Sikh  Sikh chieftains of the Bhangi Misl state encroached upon Sialkot, and had gained full control of the Sialkot region by 1786, Sialkot was portioned into 4 quarters, under the control of Sardar Jiwan Singh, Natha Singh, Sahib Singh, and Mohar Singh, who invited the city's dispersed residents back to the city. The Bhangi rulers engaged in feuds with the neighbouring Sukerchakia Misl state by 1791, and would eventually lose control of the city. The Sikh Empire of Ranjit Singh captured Sialkot from Sardar Jiwan Singh in 1808. Sikh forces then occupied Sialkot until the arrival of the British in 1849. =Modern = British Allama Iqbal, the philosopher-poet credited inspiring the Pakistan Movement, was born in Sialkot in 1877. Sialkot, along with Punjab as a whole, was captured by the British following their victory over the Sikhs at the Battle of Gujrat in February 1849. During the British era, an official is known as The Resident who would, in theory, advise the Maharaja of Kashmir would reside in Sialkot during the wintertime. During the Sepoy Mutiny of 1857, the two Bengal regiments based in Sialkot rebelled against the East India Company, while their native servants also took up arms against the British. In 1877, the Sialkot poet Allama Iqbal, who is credited for inspiring the Pakistan Movement, was born into a Kashmiri family that had converted to Islam from Hinduism in the early 1400s. British India's first bagpipe works opened in Sialkot, and today there are 20 pipe bands in the city. Sialkot's modern prosperity began during the colonial era. The city had been known for its paper making and ironworks prior to the colonial era, and became a centre of metalwork in the 1890s. Surgical instruments were being manufactured in Sialkot for use throughout British India by the 1920s. The city also became a centre for sports goods manufacturing for British troops stationed along with the North West Frontier due to the availability of nearby timber reserves. As a result of the city's prosperity, large numbers of migrants from Kashmir came to the city in search of employment. At the end of World War 2, the city was considered the second most industrialised in Punjab, after Amritsar. Much of the city's infrastructure was paid for by local taxes, and the city was one of the few in British India to have its own electric utility company. Partition The first communal riots between Hindus/Sikhs and Muslims took place on 24 June 1946, a day after the resolution calling for the establishment of Pakistan as a separate state. Sialkot remained peaceful for several months while communal riots had erupted in Lahore, Amritsar, Ludhiana, and Rawalpindi. The predominantly Muslim population supported Muslim League and the Pakistan Movement. While Muslim refugees had poured into the city escaping riots elsewhere, Sialkot's Hindu and Sikh communities began fleeing in the opposite direction towards India. They initially congregated in fields outside the city, where some of Sialkot's Muslims would bid farewell to departing friends. Hindu and Sikh refugees were unable to exit Pakistan towards Jammu on account of conflict in Kashmir, and were instead required to transit via Lahore. Post-independence After independence in 1947 the Hindu and Sikh minorities migrated to India, while Muslim refugees from India settled in Sialkot. The city had suffered significant losses as a result of communal rioting that erupted because of Partition. 80% of Sialkot's industry had been destroyed or abandoned, and the working capital fell by an estimated 90%. The city was further stressed by the arrival of 200,000 migrants, mostly from Jammu, who had arrived in the city. Following the demise of industry in the city, the government of West Pakistan prioritized the re-establishment of Punjab's decimated industrial base. The province lead infrastructure projects in the area, and allotted abandoned properties to newly arrived refugees. Local entrepreneurs also rose to fill the vacuum created by the departure of Hindu and Sikh businessmen. By the 1960s, the provincial government laid extensive new roadways in the district, and connected it to trunk roads to link the region to the seaport in Karachi. During the Indo-Pakistani war of 1965, when Pakistani troops arrived in Kashmir, the Indian Army counterattacked in the Sialkot Sector. The Pakistan Army successfully defended the city and the people of Sialkot came out in full force to support the troops.K Conboy, \\"Elite Forces of India and Pakistan\\" , page 9 In 1966, Government of Pakistan awarded a special flag of Hilal-e-Istaqlal to Sialkot, along with Lahore and Sargodha in Indo-Pakistani War of 1965 for showing severe resistance in front of enemy as these cities were target of enemy's advances. Every year on Defence Day, this flag is hoisted in these cities as a symbol of recognition of the will, courage and perseverance of the dwellers of these cities. The armoured battles in the Sialkot sector like the Battle of Chawinda were the most intense since the Second World War.The India-Pakistan Air War of 1965, Synopsis. Retrieved 26 May 2008 at the Internet Archive Geography =Climate= Sialkot features a humid subtropical climate (Cwa) under the K√∂ppen climate classification, with four seasons. The post-monsoon season from mid-September to mid-November remains hot during the daytime, but nights are cooler with low humidity. In the winter from mid-November to March, days are mild to warm, with occasionally heavy rainfalls occurring. Temperatures in winter may drop to , but maxima are very rarely less than . =Cityscape= Sialkot's core is composed of the densely populated Old City, while northeast of the city lies the vast colonial era Sialkot Cantonment - characterized by wide streets and large lawns. The city's industries have developed in a \\"ribbon-like\\" pattern along the cities main arteries, and are almost entirely dedicated to export. The city's sporting good firms are not concentrated in any part of the city, but are instead spread throughout Sialkot. Despite the city's overall prosperity, the local government has failed to meet Sialkot's basic infrastructure needs. Economy  File:Kampala Industries (PVT) Ltd, Khitchian, Sialkot - panoramio.jpgKampala Industries, Sialkot File:Ennoble.JPGEnnoble International, Sialkot File:Sialkot City Way.jpgShopping area in Sialkot Sialkot is a wealthy city relative to the rest of Pakistan and South Asia, with a per capita income in 2014 estimated at $2800. The city was considered to be one of British India's most industrialised cities, though its economy would later be largely decimated by violence and capital flight following the Partition. The city's economy rebounded, and Sialkot now forms part of the relatively industrialised region of northern Punjab that is sometimes referred to as the Golden Triangle. Sialkot has been noted by Britain's The Economist magazine as a \\"world-class manufacturing hub\\" with strong export industries. As of 2015, Sialkot exported US$2 billion worth of goods which is equal to 9% of Pakistan's total exports (US$22 billion). 250,000 residents are employed in Sialkot's industries, with most enterprises in the city being small and funded by family savings. Sialkot's Chamber of Commerce had over 6,500 members in 2010, with most active in the leather, sporting goods, and surgical instruments industry. The Sialkot Dry Port offers local producers quick access to Pakistani Customs, as well as to logistics and transportation. Sialkot Gate Despite being cut off from its historic economic heartland in Kashmir, Sialkot has managed to position itself into one of Pakistan's most prosperous cities, exporting up to 10% of all Pakistani exports. Its sporting goods firms have been particularly successful, and have produced items for global brands such as Nike, Adidas, Reebok, and Puma. Balls for the 2014 FIFA World Cup were made in Sialkot. Sialkot's business community has joined with the local government to maintain the city's infrastructure, as the local government has limited capacity to fund such maintenance. The business community was instrumental in the establishment of Sialkot's Dry Port in 1985, and further helped re-pave the city's roads. Sialkot's business community also largely funded the Sialkot International Airport‚Äîopened in 2011 as Pakistan's first privately owned public airport, which now offers direct flights from Sialkot to Bahrain, Oman, Qatar, Saudi Arabia, and the United Arab Emirates. = Industry = Sialkot is the world's largest producer of hand-sewn footballs, with local factories manufacturing 40~60 million footballs a year, amounting to roughly 60% of world production. The 2014 FIFA World Cup's footballs were made by Forward Sports, a company based in Sialkot.http://www.thenews.com.pk/article-150235-Brazilian-ambassador-unveils- Pak-made-FIFA-soccer-ball Clustering of sports goods industrial units has allowed for firms in Sialkot to become highly specialised, and to benefit from joint action and external economies. There is a well-applied child labour ban, the Atlanta Agreement, in the industry since a 1997 outcry, and the local industry now funds the Independent Monitoring Association for Child Labour to regulate factories. Sialkot is also the world's largest centre of surgical instrument manufacturing. Sialkot was first noted to be a centre of metalwork in the 1890s, and the city's association with surgical instruments came from the need to repair, and subsequently manufacture, surgical instruments for the nearby Mission hospital. By the 1920s, surgical instruments were being manufactured for use throughout British India, with demand boosted by further by World War Two. The city's surgical instrument manufacturing industry benefits from a clustering effect, in which larger manufacturers remain in close contact with smaller and specialized industries that can efficiently perform contracted work. The industry is made up of a few hundred small and medium size enterprises, supported by thousands of subcontractors, suppliers, and those providing other ancillary services. The bulk of exports are destined for the United States and European Union. Sialkot first became a centre for sporting goods manufacturing during the colonial era. Enterprises were initially established for the recreation of British troops stationed along the North West Frontier. Nearby timber reserves served to initially attract the industry to Sialkot. The city's Muslim craftsmen generally manufactured the goods, while Sikh and Hindu merchants of the Sindhi Bania, Arora, and Punjabi Khatri castes acted like middle men to bring goods to market. Sialkot now produces a wide array of sporting goods, including footballs and hockey sticks. Sialkot is also noted for its leather goods. Leather for footballs is sourced from nearby farms, while Sialkot's leather workers craft some of Germany's most prized leather lederhosen trousers. = Public-Private Partnerships = Sialkot has a productive relationship between the civic administration and the city's entrepreneurs, that dates to the colonial era. Sialkot's infrastructure was paid for by local taxes on industry, and the city was one of the few in British India to have its own electric utility company. Modern Sialkot's business community has assumed responsibility for developing infrastructure when the civic administration is unable to deliver requested services. The city's Chamber of Commerce established the Sialkot Dry Port, the country's first dry-port in 1985 to reduce transit times by offering faster customs services. Members of the Chamber of Commerce allowed paid fees in order to help resurface the city's streets. The Sialkot International Airport was established by the local businesses community, is the only private airport in Pakistan. The airport now offers flights throughout Pakistan, and several Persian Gulf countries.  Transportation  A boulevard in Sialkot = Motorways = A dual-carriageway connects Sialkot to the nearby City of Wazirabad, with onwards connections throughout Pakistan via the N-5 National Highway, while another dual carriageway connects Sialkot to Daska, and onwards to Gujranwala and Lahore. Sialkot and Lahore are also connected through the motorway (M11), which is the north‚Äìsouth motorway in Punjab. The total length of this motorway is 103 km. It was completely opened on 18 March 2020 at the cost of 44 billion rupees. It has reduced the travel time between Sialkot and Lahore to 50 minutes from two hours (through the other route via N5/GT). = Rail = Sialkot Junction railway station is the city's main railway station and is serviced by the Wazirabad‚ÄìNarowal Branch Line of the Pakistan Railways. = Air = Sialkot International Airport Sialkot International Airport is located 8.7 east of the city in the town of Sambrial. It was established in 2007 by spending 4 billion rupees by Sialkot business community. It is Pakistan's only privately owned public airport and offers flights throughout Pakistan with also direct flights to Bahrain, Oman, Saudi Arabia, Qatar, United Arab Emirates, France, UK and Spain. = Air Sial = Sialkot International Airport has launched their own airline named AirSial. It was founded in October 2017 by Sialkot Chamber of Commerce and Industry.

These herbivores are active during the summer when often found in groups, but are not seen during the winter when they hibernate underground. They are the heaviest members of the squirrel family. Description Marmots are large rodents with characteristically short but robust legs, enlarged claws well adapted to digging, stout bodies, and large heads and incisors to quickly process a variety of vegetation. While most species are various forms of earthen-hued brown, marmots vary in fur coloration based roughly on their surroundings. Species in more open habitat are more likely to have a paler color while those partially found in well-forested regions tend to be darker. Marmots are the heaviest members of the squirrel family. Total length varies typically from about and body mass averages about in spring in the smaller species and in autumn, at times exceeding , in the larger species. The largest and smallest species are not clearly known. In North America, on the basis of mean linear dimensions and body masses through the year, the smallest species appears to be the Alaska marmot and the largest is the Olympic marmot. Some species, such as the Himalayan marmot and Tarbagan marmot in Asia, appear to attain roughly similar body masses to the Olympic marmot, but are not known to reach as high a total length as the Olympic species. In the traditional definition of hibernation, the largest marmots are considered the largest \\"true hibernators\\" (since larger \\"hibernators\\" such as bears do not have the same physiological characteristics as obligate hibernating animals such as assorted rodents, bats and insectivores). Biology Some species live in mountainous areas, such as the Alps, northern Apennines, Carpathians, Tatras, and Pyrenees in Europe; northwestern Asia; the Rocky Mountains, Black Hills, the Cascade and Pacific Ranges, and the Sierra Nevada in North America; and the Deosai Plateau in Pakistan and Ladakh in India. Other species prefer rough grassland and can be found widely across North America and the Eurasian Steppe. The slightly smaller and more social prairie dog is not classified in the genus Marmota, but in the related genus Cynomys. Marmots typically live in burrows (often within rockpiles, particularly in the case of the yellow-bellied marmot), and hibernate there through the winter. Most marmots are highly social and use loud whistles to communicate with one another, especially when alarmed. Marmots mainly eat greens and many types of grasses, berries, lichens, mosses, roots, and flowers. 226x226px  Subgenera and species  The following is a list of all Marmota species recognized by Thorington and HoffmanThorington, R.

Research by the French ethnologist Michel Peissel claimed the story of the \\"Gold-digging ant\\" reported by the Ancient Greek historian Herodotus, who lived in the fifth century BCE, was founded on the golden Himalayan marmot of the Deosai Plateau and the habit of local tribes such as the Brokpa to collect the gold dust excavated from their burrows.Peissel, Michel. \\"The Ants' Gold: The Discovery of the Greek El Dorado in the Himalayas\\". Collins, 1984. . An anatomically accurate image of a marmot was printed and distributed as early as 1605 by Jacopo Ligozzi who was noted for his images of flora and fauna. The etymology of the term \\"marmot\\" is uncertain. It may have arisen from the Gallo-Romance prefix marm-, meaning to mumble or murmur (an example of onomatopoeia). Another possible origin is post-classical Latin, mus montanus, meaning \\"mountain mouse\\".

He was a government minister under six different prime ministers, and later Speaker of the House of Representatives from March to November 1998. Sinclair was born in Sydney and studied law at the University of Sydney. He later bought a farming property near Tamworth. Sinclair was elected to parliament in 1963, and added to the ministry in 1965 as part of the Menzies Government - along with Doug Anthony, he is the last surviving minister who served under Menzies as well as in the First Holt Ministry. Over the following six years, he held various portfolios under four other prime ministers. Sinclair was elected deputy leader of his party in 1971, under Anthony. He was a senior member of the Fraser Government, spending periods as Minister for Primary Industry (1975‚Äì1979), Minister for Communications (1980‚Äì1982), and Minister for Defence (1982‚Äì1983). In 1984, Sinclair replaced Anthony as leader of the Nationals. He led the party to two federal elections, in 1984 and 1987, but was replaced by Charles Blunt in 1989. Sinclair was father of the parliament from 1990 until his retirement at the 1998 election. He spent his last months in parliament as Speaker of the House of Representatives, following the sudden resignation of Bob Halverson; he is the only member of his party to have held the position. He also served as co-chair of the 1998 constitutional convention, alongside Barry Jones. Early life Sinclair was born in Sydney on 10 June 1929. He was the son of Gertrude Hazel (n√©e Smith) and George McCahon Sinclair. His father was a chartered accountant who also served as deputy mayor of Ku-ring- gai Council, chairman of Knox Grammar School, and an elder of the Presbyterian Church. Sinclair attended Knox Grammar before going on to the University of Sydney, where he graduated Bachelor of Arts in 1949 and Bachelor of Laws in 1952. He served in the No. 22 Squadron RAAF from 1950 to 1952, as part of the Citizen Air Force. Sinclair served his articles of clerkship with Norton Smith & Co., but did not pursue a legal career. He instead took up a grazing property near Bendemeer and set up the Sinclair Pastoral Company, of which he became managing director. He was a director of the Farmers and Graziers' Co- operative Limited from 1962 to 1965. Sinclair married Margaret Anne Tarrant in 1956, with whom he had one son and two daughters. She died of brain cancer in December 1967. He remarried on 14 February 1970 to Rosemary Fenton, who had been Miss Australia in 1960; they had one son together. His daughter Fiona married Liberal politician Peter King. Political career A member of the Country Party, Sinclair was appointed to the New South Wales Legislative Council in 1961. He resigned in order to seek election to the House of Representatives at the 1963 federal election, retaining the Division of New England for the Country Party after the retirement of David Drummond. =Government minister= In 1965, Sinclair was appointed Minister for Social Services in the Menzies Government, replacing Hugh Roberton. He stood for the deputy leadership of the Country Party after the 1966 federal election, but was defeated by Doug Anthony. In 1968, he became Minister for Shipping and Transport in the Gorton Government.New Transport Minister Freight & Container Transportation April 1968 page 15 When Country Party leader John McEwen retired in February 1971, Anthony was elected as his replacement and Sinclair defeated Peter Nixon for the deputy leadership. He was appointed Minister for Primary Industry. A month later, William McMahon replaced John Gorton as Liberal leader and prime minister. McMahon wanted Sinclair to become Minister for Foreign Affairs, but for various reasons had to keep him in the primary industry portfolio and appoint Les Bury as foreign minister instead. Sinclair did later serve as acting foreign minister in Bury's absence. In 1973, Sinclair was one of the six Country MPs to vote in favour of John Gorton's motion calling for the decriminalisation of homosexuality. After spending the three years of the Whitlam Labor government in opposition, he again became Minister for Primary Industry in 1975, in the Fraser Government. In 1978, New South Wales Attorney-General Frank Walker appointed Michael Finnane to inquire into the financial dealings of Sinclair's father George, who had died in January 1976. The Finnane Report, which was tabled in the Parliament of New South Wales on 27 September 1979, alleged that Ian Sinclair had improperly loaned himself money from companies he controlled, attempted to conceal the loans, and forged his father's signature on company returns. As a result, Sinclair resigned from the ministry. His supporters criticised the report on several grounds, including that the inquiry was conducted in secret, that its release prejudiced Sinclair's right to a fair trial, and that it was politically biased as both Walker and Finnane were members of the ALP. In April 1980, Sinclair was charged with nine counts of fraud, relating to forging, uttering, and making false statements on company returns. He was found not guilty on all charges on 15 August 1980, following a 23-day trial in the District Court of New South Wales. Sinclair returned to the ministry in August 1980 as Minister for Special Trade Representations. After the 1980 election he was made Minister for Communications. He was finally made Minister for Defence in May 1982, holding the position until the government's defeat at the 1983 election. =Party leader= Doug Anthony announced his resignation as NCP leader in December 1983. Sinclair was elected as his replacement on 17 January 1984, defeating Stephen Lusher by an unspecified margin. In an interview with Australian Playboy in July 1984, Sinclair acknowledged a previous extramarital relationship with socialite Glen-Marie North. Copies of the interview were distributed in his electorate during the 1984 election campaign. In the lead-up to the election, Sinclair controversially attributed the spread of HIV/AIDS in Australia to the Labor Party's recognition of de facto relationships and normalisation of homosexuality. After the deaths of three babies from HIV-contaminated blood transfusions, he stated that \\"if it wasn't for the promotion of homosexuality as a norm by Labor, I am quite confident that the very tragic and sad passing on of the AIDS disease [...] to those three poor babies would not have occurred. In 1985, Sinclair came into conflict with the National Farmers' Federation over his claims that the organisation did not have the support of farmers. He also came into conflict with the Liberal Party on a number of occasions. He publicly rejected calls for a Liberal‚ÄìNational party merger, citing the incompatibility of the National Party's conservatism and the \\"small-l liberal\\" wing of the Liberal Party. In March 1986, he accused Liberals of undermining the leadership of John Howard and thereby harming the Coalition's chances of victory. He denounced former Liberal prime minister Malcolm Fraser's support of sanctions against apartheid South Africa, accusing him of \\"prejudice against Southern Africa and the whites there\\". Sinclair proclaimed a \\"deep abhorrence\\" of apartheid, but believed the sanctions were too \\"heavy-handed\\". He supported the re-admission of South Africa to the United Nations, the lifting of the sporting boycott, the re-establishment of an Australian trade commission, and direct flights between Australia and South Africa. In addition to his leadership of the National Party, Sinclair continued to be the opposition spokesman on defence. In August 1986, he suggested the formation of a Pacific trade bloc at a meeting of the International Democrat Union in Sydney. The proposal, also supported by shadow foreign minister Andrew Peacock, was designed to \\"minimise the harmful policies of major protectionist trading nations\\" like the U.S. and the European Communities. Later in the year, Sinclair questioned the value of ANZUS, stating that Australia should reconsider its commitments to New Zealand as it had become too isolationist. He also believed Australia should adopt a more assertive role than provided for in the Dibb Report. He opposed trade sanctions on Fiji following the 1987 coups d'√©tat and was accused by foreign minister Bill Hayden of sympathising with the perpetrators. In the lead-up to the 1987 election, Sinclair dealt with the \\"Joh for Canberra\\" campaign, an ambitious bid by Queensland premier and state National leader Joh Bjelke-Petersen to enter federal politics and become prime minister. The campaign \\"derailed any semblance of non-Labor unity from the beginning of 1987\\", and resulting in the Coalition splitting. After the election, the Queensland branch continued its efforts to oust Sinclair from the leadership. In the late 1980s, Sinclair was drawn into the debate over the levels of Asian immigration to Australia, favouring a reduction in the number of Asians allowed into the country. In August 1988, he said: > \\"What we are saying is that if there is any risk of an undue build-up of > Asians as against others in the community, then you need to control it ... I > certainly believe, that at the moment we need ... to reduce the number of > Asians ... We don't want the divisions of South Africa, we don't want the > divisions of London. We really don't want the colour divisions of the United > States.\\" A few days later he \\"toned down his statements\\" at the request of Howard and denied that he had specifically targeted Asians. The following month, following pressure from Howard, he sacked National Senate leader John Stone from the shadow ministry for making similar comments, \\"with regret\\". This was seen by many in his party as a capitulation to the Liberals. In May 1989, there were simultaneous leadership coups in both Coalition parties, with Peacock displacing Howard as Liberal leader and Charles Blunt replacing Sinclair. The immediate trigger for Sinclair's defeat was dissatisfaction with his conditional support for the Hawke Government's deregulation of the wheat industry. However, there was also a sense that it was time for a generational change in the party leadership. When Blunt lost his seat at the 1990 election, Sinclair made an attempt to regain the NPA leadership, but was defeated by Tim Fischer, and retired to the back bench. He was thus the first NPA leader since the formation of the Coalition to have never served as Deputy Prime Minister of Australia. =Post-leadership= Sinclair underwent a double heart bypass surgery in September 1991. On 23 March 1993, ten days after the Coalition lost the 1993 federal election, Sinclair unsuccessfully challenged Tim Fischer for the party leadership. By 1993, Sinclair was the Father of the House, the only sitting MP to have served with Robert Menzies, and \\"the last of the Right Honourables\\" (MPs with membership in the Privy Council). He was seen as a candidate for the speakership if the Coalition won the 1993 election, however this did not eventuate. Aged nearly 70, Sinclair announced his intention to retire from parliament at the 1998 election. In February 1998 Howard appointed Sinclair as Chairman of the Constitutional Convention, which debated the possibility of Australia becoming a republic. When Speaker Bob Halverson suddenly resigned in March, Sinclair was elected to replace him. He served as speaker for the last seven months of his term, during which he usually wore an academic-style gown. At the time of his retirement, he was the last parliamentary survivor of the Menzies, Holt, Gorton and McMahon governments. As a result of his election as Speaker, Sinclair wanted to remain in Parliament, in the event of the re-election of the Howard Government, in order to continued as Speaker. However Sinclair had announced his retirement before Halverson's resignation as Speaker and the National Party had since selected Stuart St. Clair as his replacement in New England. Sinclair's retirement could not be reversed and St. Clair refused to stand aside for him. St. Clair ultimately succeeded Sinclair at the 1998 election.https://www.afr.com/politics/angst-alert-for-the- coalition-19980309-k80f0 After politics In January 2001, he was appointed a Companion of the Order of Australia (AC). As of 2009, Sinclair was the President of AUSTCARE, an international, non-profit, independent aid organisation. In 2000, Sinclair became the inaugural chairman of the Foundation for Rural and Regional Renewal (FRRR), a non-profit organisation which issues grants to regional communities. He retired in June 2019 and was succeeded by Tim Fairfax. Sinclair also served for several years as the Honorary President of the Scout Association of Australia, New South Wales Branch, retiring in 2019. He received Scouts‚Äô National Presidents Award on World Scout Day 2020.

However, his political ascension did not occur without difficulties. As a member of the colonial administration from 1946, Maurice Yam√©ogo found a place for himself in the busy political landscape of Upper Volta thanks to his skill as a speaker. In May 1957, during the formation of the first Upper Voltaic government instituted under the Loi Cadre Defferre, he joined the coalition government formed by Ouezzin Coulibaly, as minister for agriculture and a member of the Voltaic Democratic Movement (MDV). In January 1958, threatened by a vote of censure, Coulibaly enticed Maurice Yam√©ogo and his allies in the assembly to join the Voltaic Democratic Union-African Democratic Assembly (UDV-RDA) in exchange for promises of promotion within the government. Maurice Yam√©ogo rose to be his second in command, with the portfolio of the Interior, a position which allowed him to assume the role of interim head of government, following Coulibay's death in September 1958. His rather shaky political ascendancy was reinforced by circumstances. After the proclamation of the Republic of Upper Volta on 11 December 1958, he made a surprising volte-face with respect to the Mali Federation advocated by L√©opold S√©dar Senghor. The Voltaic assembly supported Upper Volta's membership in the Federation, but Yam√©ogo opted for political sovereignty and limited economic integration with the Conseil de l'Entente. Then, by means of controversial manoeuvres, Yam√©ogo eliminated all parliamentary opposition. The UDV-RDA was purged of his enemies and he imposed a one party system. Upper Volta found itself under a dictatorship even before its independence on 5 August 1960. In foreign policy, Yam√©ogo envied and admired the international success of his F√©lix Houphou√´t- Boigny, the President of C√¥te d'Ivoire, who defied the anti-communists by establishing an ephemeral customs union (1961‚Äì1962) with the \\"progressivist\\" Ghana of Kwame Nkrumah. Houphou√´t-Boigny nevertheless remained his closest ally and in December 1965, Yam√©ogo signed an agreement with him to extend dual nationality to citizens of both countries. However, this project did not reach fruition. On 3 January 1966, as a result of severe financial austerity measures, Yam√©ogo's corrupt regime was overthrown by a peaceful protest organised by the unions, traditional chieftains and the clergy. In 1993, he died after having been rehabilitated by President Blaise Compaor√©. Early life Map of Upper Volta According to his official biography, Maurice Yam√©ogo was born on 31 December 1921 at Koudougou, a town 98 km west of Ouagadougou, along with his twin sister Wamanegdo.√âtats africains d'expression fran√ßaise et R√©publique malgache, Paris, √âditions Julliard, 1964, He was the son of Mossi peasants,Alfred Yambangba Sawadogo, Afrique : la d√©mocratie n'a pas eu lieu, Paris, √âditions L'Harmattan, 2008, whom he described as a \\"heathen family, completely given to a whole mob of superstitions.\\" They gave him the name Naoua LaguembaJean-Pierre Bejot, \\" Quand la C√¥te d'Ivoire et la Haute-Volta (devenue Burkina Faso) r√™vaient de la double nationalit√© \\", La D√©p√™che Diplomatique 16 October 2002, Online on lefaso.net (also spelt Nawalagma) which means \\"he comes to unite them.\\". From a very young age, Naoua Laguemba was very interested in Christianity.Fr√©d√©ric Guirma, Comment perdre le pouvoir ? Le cas de Maurice Yameogo, Paris, √âditions Chaka, coll. ¬´ Afrique contemporaine ¬ª, p.23 This inclination resulted in a great deal of bullying from his family. It is reported that the young Yam√©ogo received an emergency baptism on 28 July 1929, a year before schedule, after being struck by lightning.Fr√©d√©ric Guirma, op. cit., The priest Van der Shaegue who performed the baptism gave him Maurice as a patron saint. His mother died three days later, supposedly from the shock. After these events, he adopted the name Maurice Yam√©ogo, intending to become a priest. After spending a few years at school in his village, Maurice Yam√©ogo was admitted to the Minor Seminary of Pabr√©.Fr√©d√©ric Guirma, op. cit., On 5 September 1934, he left his family to pursue his studies. Pabr√© was one of the most prestigious institutions in the country; aside from the fact that it produced most of the country's priests, the Minor Seminary's students also filled the very highest ranks of public and private administration.Alfred Yambangba Sawadogo, op. cit., As a result, he met many of the rising stars of Upper Volta, such as Joseph Ki-Zerbo, Joseph Ou√©draogo, and Pierre Tapsoba, with whom he formed a close friendship.Fr√©d√©ric Guirma, op. cit., But his relationships strayed far from the ecclesiastical standard. Yam√©ogo wanted to be a priest, but he was very keen on women and parties. In 1939, he left the Minor Seminary of Pabr√©, without graduating.Fr√©d√©ric Guirma, op. cit., LA PETITE ACADEMIE. (2004). Detail sur la personalite selectionnee. LA PETITEACADEMIE. Retrieved March 19, 2006 from http://www.petiteacademie.gov.bf/Personnalite.asp?CodePersonnalite=216 =Professional career= Despite failing to graduate, Yam√©ogo's education allowed him to gain a public role as a shipping clerk for the French Colonial Administration.Fr√©d√©ric Guirma, op. cit., This extremely prestigious post meant success, security and prestige. In this period he increased his involvement with women. He became enamoured of a mixed-race woman, Th√©r√®se Larbat, whose father refused to allow him to marry her because he was an African and was not \\"civilised enough\\" to maintain her well-being.Fr√©d√©ric Guirma, op. cit., Yam√©ogo was offended by this, but eventually, he resigned himself to marrying an educated woman from Koudougou, F√©licit√© Zagr√©.Fr√©d√©ric Guirma, op. cit., Together they presented themselves as the \\"evolved\\" couple of Koudougou; F√©licit√© was the only African in the town who dressed like a European. In 1940,Alain Foka, \\" Maurice Yam√©ogo \\" In Archives d'Afrique (√©mission radiophonique de RFI), 2e partie, 18 May 2007 as part of the World War II war effort, Yam√©ogo was sent to Abidjan in lower C√¥te d'Ivoire, a paradise for \\"evolved\\" Africans.Fr√©d√©ric Guirma, op. cit., Regular parties were held there in which Yam√©ogo sought to increase his social standing. He sought among other things to make many friends among the \\"evolved\\" non-Voltaic people.Fr√©d√©ric Guirma, op. cit., In Abidjan Yam√©ogo was shocked by the fact that some Voltaic businessmen were illegally trafficking workers in order to supply huge plantations with workers. In Upper Volta, Maurice also worked as a clerk for the Administrative, Accounting and Finance Services (SAFC) of the French Colonial Administration. For this purpose, he was appointed in towns like Dedougou and Koudougou. Yam√©ogo was later appointed the head of the CFTC syndicate (French Confederation of Christian Workers) of his corporation, and vice-president of CFTC Upper-Volta. Early political career On his return to his native town after the war, he was elected to the first territorial assembly of C√¥te d'Ivoire as the general councillor for Koudougou on 15 December 1946.La petite Acad√©mie, Liste des conseillers g√©n√©raux de la premi√®re assembl√©e territoriale de Haute-Volta de 1946 √† 1952 Online on petiteacademie.gov.bf Upper Volta had ceased to exist after 1932, being divided up between C√¥te d'Ivoire, French Sudan and Niger. This did not please the people of Upper Volta, who elected Philippe Zinda Kabor√© to the French National Assembly in November 1946 with a mandate to restore Upper Volta. Yam√©ogo joined Kabor√©'s entourage in the hope of thereby accelerating his own rise.Fr√©d√©ric Guirma, op. cit., When Kabor√© died on 24 May 1947, Yam√©ogo positioned himself as his spiritual heir. On 4 September 1947, Upper Volta was restored with its 1932 borders. Subsequently, a French law of 31 March 1948 instituted the Territorial Assembly of Upper Volta.Y√©nouyaba Georges Madi√©ga and Oumarou Nao (ed.), Burkina Faso cent ans d'histoire, 1895-1995, t.2, Paris, √âditions Karthala, 2003, This assembly contained fifty seats, thirty- four of which were to be held by the general counsellors elected while Upper Volta was partitioned.Roger Bila Kabor√©, Histoire politique du Burkina Faso: 1919-2000, Paris, √âditions L‚ÄôHarmattan, 2002, Yam√©ogo was part of this group and planned to sit as part of Kabor√©'s Voltaic Democratic Party (PDV), the local branch of the African Democratic Assembly (RDA).Fr√©d√©ric Guirma, op. cit., However, the PDV-RDA suffered an electoral set-back. In the partial elections between 30 May and 20 June, it secured only three of the sixteen seats up for election, losing the other thirteen to the Voltaic Union (UV).Roger Bila Kabor√©, op. cit., Then, on 27 June 1948, the PDV-RDA suffered a defection to the UV, led by Henri Guissou. Yam√©ogo too joined the UV, swearing that he would never again be a member of the RDA. = Grand counsellor of the AOF (1948‚Äì1952) = Portrait of Lamine Gu√®ye, fresco in Dakar When the assembly finally met, the general counsellors elected senators to the Council of the Republic, the counsellors of the French Union and the Grand Counsellors who would sit on the Grand Council of French West Africa (AOF) in Dakar.Fr√©d√©ric Guirma, op. cit., In the discussions, Yam√©ogo had been left to one side.Fr√©d√©ric Guirma, op. cit., Outraged, he attempted to make his voice heard within the party, but he was judged too ambitious and his requests were not heeded.Fr√©d√©ric Guirma, op. cit., Thus he decided to appeal directly to Father Goarnisson, a European who had been chosen by the college of natives for one of the grand counsellor posts. The priest was persuaded by him to withdraw his candidacy and support Yam√©ogo. Thus, on 28 July 1948,Gabriel Massa, et Y. Georges Madi√©ga (dir.), La Haute-Volta coloniale: t√©moignages, recherches, regards, Paris, √âditions Karthala, 1995, Yam√©ogo was elected grand counsellor of French West Africa for Upper Volta. This was a great achievement; Yam√©ogo was barely twenty-six years old. Portraits of him as Grand Counsellor decorated the houses of his parents and friends.Fr√©d√©ric Guirma, op. cit., At Dakar, his wife F√©licit√© enjoyed the role of mistress of the house, hosting the governor-general Paul B√©chard with pomp, organising receptions for the \\"evolved\\" and Yam√©ogo's colleagues, who included deputy mayor Lamine Gueye, president of the Grand Council. At Dakar, Yam√©ogo once more slid towards the RDA.Fr√©d√©ric Guirma, op. cit., At the legislative elections of 17 June 1951, the PDV-RDA presented a single list with the doctor Ali Barraud, while the UV was caught up in internal dissension.Fr√©d√©ric Guirma, op. cit., Joseph Conombo organised the main party list, Union for the Defense of the Interests of Upper Volta, which received 146,861 votes out of 249,940 and thus obtained three of the four seats up for election. The left wing of the UV, led by the outgoing deputy Nazi Boni,Roger Bila Kabor√©, op. cit., also presented a list, The Economic and Social Action of the Interests of Upper Volta, which secured the fourth seat with 66,986 votes. Meanwhile, the two grand counsellors, Bougouraoua Ou√©draogo and Maurice Yam√©ogo, issued an independent list, which did not meet with any success. = Setback (1952‚Äì1957) = The electoral setbacks continued in the territorial elections of 30 March 1952. Yam√©ogo returned to his private role as a shipping clerk on the orders of governor Albert Mouragues. The governor of Upper Volta was known for his repressive policy towards the RDA, which, despite its rupture with the French Communist Party (PCF) in October 1950, was still suspected of communist sympathies. The uncertain relationship between Yam√©ogo and the RDA was surely responsible for his reassignment to Djibo in the Sahel. Less than a year later, he returned to Ouagadougou to oversee the health service.Fr√©d√©ric Guirma, op. cit., He participated in the establishment of a club of officials. Then, hoping to relaunch his political career, Yam√©ogo re-entered the UV thanks to the support of his old school friend from Pabr√©, who had become president of the General Council, Joseph Ou√©draogo. On stage with the latter, he was named joint-secretary during the first congress of the territorial union of the French Confederation of Christian Workers (CFTC) in 1954, in spite of He.Ren√© Otayek, F. Michel Sawadogo, et Jean-Pierre Guingan√©, Le Burkina entre r√©volution et d√©mocratie (1983-1993), Paris, √âditions Karthala, 1996, In the same year, the two wings of the UV clashed. On one side, deputy Nazi Boni founded the Popular Movement for African Development (MPEA) on 27 October 1954.Joseph-Roger de Benoist, L'Afrique occidentale fran√ßaise de la Conf√©rence de Brazzaville (1944) √† l'ind√©pendance (1960), Dakar, Nouvelles √©ditions africaines, 1982, On the other side, the leaders of the party terminated the UV in order to create the Social Party for the Education of the African Masses (PSEMA) in December 1954.Joseph Issoufou Conombo, et Monique Chajmowiez, Acteur de mon temps: un volta√Øque dans le XXe si√®cle, Paris, √âditions L'Harmattan, 2003, Yam√©ogo once again tried t set up a separate group centred around himself, but without success. His list at the legislative elections of 2 January 1956, which included his friend Pierre Tapsoba, suffered a defeat.Fr√©d√©ric Guirma, op. cit., So too did his request to the newly elected mayor of Ouagadougou, Joseph Ou√©draogo, for the post of general secretary of the mayor.Fr√©d√©ric Guirma, op. cit., =Minister of Upper Volta under the Loi Cadre Defferre (1957‚Äì1958)= A market in Upper Volta On 29 September 1956, PSEMA merged with the PVD-RDA to form the United Democratic Party (PDU).Claudette Savonnet-Guyot, √âtat et soci√©t√©s au Burkina : essai sur le politique africain: essai sur le politique africain, Paris, √âditions Karthala, 1986, Despite his links with both of these parties, Yam√©ogo joined a new party in July 1956, the Voltaic Democratic Movement (MDV), founded by G√©rard Kango Ou√©draogo and the French captain Michel Dorange, in which he took on the role of financial controller.Gabriel Massa, et Y. Georges Madi√©ga (dir.), op. cit., In the territorial elections of 30 March 1957, the MDV list led by Maurice Yam√©ogo at Koudougou,Gabriel Massa, et Y. Georges Madi√©ga (dir.), op. cit., which included his cousin Denis Yam√©ogo and the Haitian-Arab Nader Atti√© scored a surprising victory over the PDU list led by Henri Guissou, winning all six of the seats which were up for election. This victory was certainly due to Yam√©ogo's \\"American style campaign,\\" characterised by numerous meetings in the markets. As a result of the elections, 70 territorial deputies were elected.Roger Bila Kabor√©, op. cit., The PDU held 39 of them, the MDV had 26 and the MPEA of Nazi Boni had 5. These elections, which followed the entry into force of the Loi Cadre Defferre of 1956, were intended to produce a new local government. Rather than rule alone, the leader of the PDU, Ouezzin Coulibaly chose to establish a coalition government, with seven PDU ministers and five MDV ministers. Maurice Yam√©ogo took the portfolio of agriculture in the first government, under Yvon Bourges, the last French Governor in Upper-Volta.Fr√©d√©ric Guirma, op. cit., Very quickly, tensions broke out in the PDU. During investigative meetings in September 1957, the former leader of PSEMA, Joseph Conombo, repudiated the affiliation of his party to the RDA under the control of Ouezzin Coulibaly.Roger Bila Kabor√©, op. cit., Conombo left the coalition government with six other deputies in order to re-establish PSEMA. Coulibay on the other hand transformed the PDU into the Voltaic Democratic Union (UDV) and affiliated it with the RDA.Janda, K. (1980). UPPER VOLTA: The Party System in 1950‚Äì1956 and 1957‚Äì1962.Political Parties: A Cross-National Survey Retrieved March 26, 2006 from After these events, the UDV-RDA took an absolute majority in the assembly, while an anti-Ouezzin parliamentary group formed in December 1957, consisting of PSEMA, the MPEA and the MDV.Fr√©d√©ric Guirma, op. cit., Thus, from being a member of government, Yam√©ogo found himself in the parliamentary opposition. On 17 December, Joseph Conombo submitted a motion to name a new parliamentary group, a motion of no confidence in the government, which passed.Fr√©d√©ric Guirma, op. cit., Coulibaly refused to resign: the Loi Cadre Defferre explicitly state that in the case of a vote of no confidence, the government \\"could\\" resign, not that it \\"was removed\\", from office. Upper Volta faced a political crisis. In January 1958, Coulibaly resolved the situation by poaching Maurice Yam√©ogo,Roger Bila Kabor√©, op. cit., who brought the MDV deputies from Koudougou with him (Nader Atti√©, Gabriel Traor√© et Denis Yam√©ogo) and some other counsellors like Mathias Sorgho. With this new majority, the UDV-RDA established a new government on 22 January 1958. In the new cabinet of 6 February, composed solely of members of UDV-RDA, Yam√©ogo was promoted to the second highest ranking position in the government, with the strategi position of Minister of the Interior, while his cousin Denis took the portfolio of Labour and Social Affairs.Roger Bila Kabor√©, op. cit., Ouezzin Coulibaly was taken to Paris for health reasons on 28 July 1958 and Yam√©ogo was placed in charge in his absence.Bendre.

Retrieved March 19, 2006 from http://www.bendre.africa- web.org/article.php3?id_article=985 On 4 September 1958, Oezzin Coulibaly died and Maurice Yam√©ogo assumed the role of acting head of government.Roger Bila Kabor√©, op. cit.,  President of Upper Volta (1958‚Äì1966) = Establishment of personal power = After the people of Upper Volta had approved the constitution of the French Community on 28 September 1958, and therefore reinforced their state's autonomy, the territorial assembly met on 17 October to designate Ouezzin Coulibaly's successor.Y√©nouyaba Georges Madi√©ga, et Oumarou Nao (dir.), op. cit., t.1, p.1008 On that day, Moro Naba Kougri made an unsuccessful attempt to install a constitutional monarchy.Y√©nouyaba Georges Madi√©ga, et Oumarou Nao (dir.), op. cit., t.1, p.1049 Kougri, who had the support of Colonel Chevreau, the commander of the French Army in Upper Volta, gathered around 3,000 of his supporters around the assembly and attempted to influence the choice of the new president of the council. Yam√©ogo's quick response to this demonstration certainly played in his favour during the rescheduled vote of the assembly on the 20 October, at which he was elected as president of the council.Gabriel Massa, et Y. Georges Madi√©ga (dir.), op. cit., p.444  Elimination of parliamentary opposition  From April 1958, the opposition in the territorial assembly was united as the Voltaic Regroupment Movement (MRV), the local branch of the African Regroupment Party (PRA), the new international African opposition to the African Democratic Rally (RDA). After Moro Naba Kougri's attempted coup, the MRV-PRA approached Yam√©ogo, who formed a union government consisting of seven UDV-RDA ministers and five MRV-PRA ministers on 10 December 1958. The next day, the Republic of Upper Volta was proclaimed and the Territorial Assembly assumed legislative and constituent powers. Yam√©ogo retained his post as president of the council and also became Minister of Information and secretary of the youth section of the UDV-RDA. After received special powers from the assembly on 29 January 1959,Y√©nouyaba Georges Madi√©ga, et Oumarou Nao (dir.), op. cit., t.1, p.1016 Yam√©ogo used his new prerogatives to dissolve the assembly on 28 February.Gabriel Massa, et Y. Georges Madi√©ga (dir.), op. cit., p.445 A new division of electoral districts had taken place.Gabriel Massa, et Y. Georges Madi√©ga (dir.), op. cit., p.446 A majority list ballot was adopted in the two least populated districts and a proportional representation system was adopted in the two most populated districts.L'Ann√©e politique, √©conomique, sociale et diplomatique en France, Paris, PUF, 1960, p.268 This manoeuvre allowed the UDV-RDA to win 64 (or 66)Y√©nouyaba Georges Madi√©ga, et Oumarou Nao (dir.), op. cit., t.1, p.1021 seats in the legislative elections of 19 April. THE MRV-PRA won only 11 (or 9) seats. Turnout was 47%. On 25 April, the new assembly confirmed Yam√©ogo in his position as President of the Council. He became minister of justice and minister for veterans on the same day. On 1 May, he formed a homogenous UDV-RDA government. Soon the opposition consisted of only three members, following defections in favour of the majority. The internal position of the president of the council was reinforced on the 25th and 26 August, following the expulsion of the old RDA spokesman Ali Barraud and the party's secretary general Joseph Ou√©draogo from the UDV-RDA. This was followed by a decree on 29 August, dissolving the municipal council of Ouagadougou, which was led by Joseph Ou√©draogo. An administration committee led by Joseph Conombo replaced it.Fr√©d√©ric Guirma, op. cit., p.114-115 No one seemed able to resist the man who was now nicknamed \\"Monsieur Maurice.\\" Even the most intractable members of the opposition, led by G√©rard Kango Ou√©draogo finally rejoined the UDV-RDA in Autumn 1959, officially putting an end to the MRV.Y√©nouyaba Georges Madi√©ga, et Oumarou Nao (dir.), op. cit., t.1, p.1025 There was no longer any parliamentary opposition. On 11 December 1959, Yam√©ogo was elected as the first President of the Republic of Upper Volta without opposition.Gabriel Massa, et Y. Georges Madi√©ga (dir.), op. cit., p.503 Extremely distrustful, Yam√©ogo entrusted power during his overseas absences to the only European on his staff, the administrator of colonies Michel Frejus.  Single party system  Flag of the Mali Federation On 22 May 1959, Yam√©ogo received a new grant of special powers for six months.Y√©nouyaba Georges Madi√©ga, et Oumarou Nao (dir.), op. cit., t.1, p.1023 This exceptional measure allowed him to compose a legislative arsenal against the opposition. Then, on 6 October 1959, Nazi Boni established the Voltaic National Party as a local branch of the Party of the African Federation (PFA) and Yam√©ogo dissolved it on the grounds that the reference to the PFA was unconstitutional.Y√©nouyaba Georges Madi√©ga, et Oumarou Nao (dir.), op. cit., t.1, p.1026 Two days later, Boni tried again, establishing the Republican Liberty Party (PRL). This was banned on 6 January 1960, on the grounds that the flag of the Federation of Mali (which Yam√©ogo had broken away from) had been flown at Boni's house. After protesting this decision publicly, Nazi Boni was subjected to a judicial investigation. On 22 February, it was the turn of G√©rard Kango Ou√©draogo, member of the UDV-RDA, who attempted to create a new Party of Peasant Action (PAP). Yam√©ogo vetoed this party with an official declaration.Y√©nouyaba Georges Madi√©ga, et Oumarou Nao (dir.), op. cit., t.1, p.1027 The one-party system was entrenched. On 12 March, the President of the Republic invited Nazi Boni and Joseph Ou√©draogo to a reconciliation meeting. They declined. On 28 June, an open letter criticising the government's actions was signed by both of them, as well as Diongolo Traor√©, Edouard Ou√©draogo et Gabriel Ou√©draogo, in the hope of organising a roundtable discussion.Y√©nouyaba Georges Madi√©ga, et Oumarou Nao (dir.), op. cit., t.1, p.1028 In response, Yam√©ogo had them arrested on 2 July and imprisoned at Gorom-Gorom, except for Nazi Boni who once more went into exile. When the country became independent on 5 August 1960, all forms of opposition had been silenced. The dictatorship was affirmed by the proclamation of 30 NovemberY√©nouyaba Georges Madi√©ga, et Oumarou Nao (dir.), op. cit., t.2, p.1753 of a new constitution which conferred extended powers on Yam√©ogo.Michel Izard and Jean du Bois de Gaudusson, \\" Burkina Faso \\" In Encyclop√©die Universalis 2008 This constitution had been adopted by the National Assembly on 6 November and approved by the people in a referendum on 27 November. As dictator, Yam√©ogo remained easy- going. Attempting to spare his main opponents, he used diplomatic means to remove some of them, like G√©rard Kango Ou√©draogo, whom he appointed ambassador to Great Britain, or Henri Guissou, whom he dispatched to Paris. The few political prisoners were released in exchange for a simple declaration of support for the regime.Roger Bila Kabor√©, op. cit., p.61 Joseph Ou√©draogo requested to rejoin the party in February 1962 at the second UDV-RDA party congress.Fr√©d√©ric Guirma, op. cit., p.127 In the course of this congress, Yam√©ogo was removed as president of the party and instead appointed secretary general, a role which he held as leader of the movement.Roger Bila Kabor√©, op. cit., p.62 Paranoia, ministerial instability and corruption Yam√©ogo became more paranoid after the 13 January 1963 coup in neighboring Togo resulted in the death of President Sylvanus Olympio. Two days after the coup, Joseph Ou√©draogo was arrested again along with the union leader Pierre-Claver Tiendr√©b√©ogo, party official Ali Sor√©, and Ambassador to the UN Fr√©d√©ric Guirm. A Security Court was established, with the accused appearing there without the right to be defended by attorneys. A police inquiry refuted the existence of a plot against Yam√©ogo.Fr√©d√©ric Guirma, op. cit., p.128 His cousin, interior minister Denis Yam√©ogo, was arrested for providing him with false statements. After an imprisonment, Denis Yam√©ogo was reinstated to his duties in 1965.Fr√©d√©ric Guirma, op. cit., p.132 The investigation, according to Guirma, proved that the informants were men of Maxime Ou√©draogo, Minister of Public Service and Labour. In June 1963, Maxime Ou√©draogo was removed from office and arrested. This demonstrated one of the characteristics of Yam√©ogo regime: ministerial instability. Each year many hasty ministerial changes were made. Depending on his moods,Roger Bila Kabor√©, op. cit., p.63 the President of the Republic announced on the radio, without prior consultation, appointment or removal of ministers. Maxime Ou√©draogo was officially imprisoned for theft and misappropriation of the funds of the Central Cooperative of Upper Volta (CCCHV). Embezzlement was a common practice in the nation's government.Pascal Zagr√©, Les politiques √©conomiques du Burkina Faso: une tradition d'ajustement structurel, Paris, √âditions Karthala, 1994, p.47 Maurice Yam√©ogo was well known for this. His wife F√©licit√© spared no expense in fur coats and valuable cosmetics while her children bought sports cars.Fr√©d√©ric Lejeal, Le Burkina Faso, Paris, √âditions Karthala, 2002, p.79 Meanwhile, the president spent more than half a year abroad in sumptuous villas and thermal spas. Nonetheless, the President's way of life did not improve his mood.Fr√©d√©ric Guirma, op. cit., p.135 Beginning in 1964, he became obsessed about the establishment of a single union subservient to a single institutional party. Already, at the Congress of the UDV-RDA in 1962, he invited the legislators of the country to achieve unity within the National Union of workers of Upper Volta (UNST-HV).Charles Kabeya Muase, Syndicalisme et d√©mocratie en Afrique noire: l'exp√©rience du Burkina Faso (1936-1988), Paris, √âditions Karthala, 1989, p.68 Since this did not happen, the National Assembly voted on 27 April 1964 to pass a law requiring unions to join the Organization of African Trade Union Unity (OATUU), under penalty of immediate dissolution. In its charter OATUU allowed only one union per country: for Upper Volta this was the UNST-HV. All unions which refused to join the UNST- HV, were labeled \\"illegal\\" and suffered state repression.Charles Kabeya Muase, op. cit., p.69 Maurice Yam√©ogo became the subject of a cult of personality as evidenced by stamps printed with his image. He was the sole leader of the Republic of Upper Volta and was the only candidate for the presidential election on 3 October 1965. He was \\"triumphantly\\" reelected with 99.97% of votes.Charles Kabeya Muase, op. cit., p.42 During the parliamentary elections of 7 November, where the participation rate was 41%, the single list of candidates he imposed won 99.89% of votes. On 5 December, Yam√©ogo loyalists were also victorious in the municipal elections, as the UDV-RDA swept all positions.Fr√©d√©ric Guirma, op. cit., p.154 =Foreign affairs=  Reversal on the Mali Federation (1958‚Äì1959)  Members of the Conseil de l'Entente After his election as President of the Council on 20 October 1958, Maurice Yam√©ogo faced the question of whether or not to integrate Upper Volta into the Mali Federation. He showed some hesitation on this issue,Y√©nouyaba Georges Madi√©ga, et Oumarou Nao (dir.), op. cit., t.1, p.1013 although the Voltaic political elite seemed to be generally favourable. On 12 January 1959, his lack of enthusiasm changed dramatically.Y√©nouyaba Georges Madi√©ga & Oumarou Nao (ed.), op. cit., t.1, p.1014 By chance, one of the members of the Voltaic delegation to the federal assembly in Dakar for the 14th to 17 January died and Yam√©ogo replaced him. In Dakar, very skillfully, he had himself elected Vice-President of the Federal Assembly. On 28 January, in his role as head of government, he demanded that the Voltaic Assembly ratify the federal constitution. Although the 59 deputies present approved this unanimously, there was fear of a new coup attempt by Moro Naba Kougri with the anti- federalist deputy Michel Dorange. Taking advantage of this threat, Yam√©ogo successfully obtained the extension of his emergency powers. According to the then high commissioner Paul Masson, Yam√©ogo had changed his mind about the Federation in the course of these events and sought Masson's assistance in legally extracting Upper Volta from its engagements.Gabriel Massa, et Y. Georges Madi√©ga (dir.), op. cit., p.501 On his advice, the Voltaic civil service and French jurists elaborated a new constitution which he had 40 hastily reconvened deputies ratify on 28 February, threatening to use his emergency powers to dissolve the Assembly if they refused.Fr√©d√©ric Lejeal, op. cit., p.70 Afraid that they would not be re-elected, the deputies did as they were told. At the end of the meeting, Yam√©ogo dissolved the Assembly anyway. To justify his actions, Yam√©ogo organised a referendum on the constitution on 15 March, which passed with 69% of the votes.Fr√©d√©ric Lejeal, op. cit., p.71 Completing this volte-face, Yam√©ogo co-founded an organisation hostile to the Mali Federation, the Conseil de l'Entente, on 29 May 1959, with F√©lix Houphou√´t-Boigny of C√¥te d'Ivoire, Hamani Diori of Niger, and Hubert Maga of Dahomey. The deputies elected in April acknowledged and ratified Upper Volta's membership of this organisation on 27 June.  Collapse of relations with C√¥te d'Ivoire and France (1960-1961)  Within the Conseil de l'Entente, a quarrel about \\"leadership\\" developed between Yam√©ogo and F√©lix Houphou√´t- Boigny.Fr√©d√©ric Lejeal, op. cit., p.161 Initially the dispute was simply about the division of customs revenues, which Yam√©ogo considered unfair. However, Yam√©ogo's pride rapidly became the true reason for the tensions. Yam√©ogo held the presidency of the Conseil de l'Entente from 1960 to 1961, but Houphou√´t- Boigny, who was favoured by Paris, continued to direct the Entente's discussions and negotiations on his own and to get all the kudos. On 12 February 1961, Yam√©ogo unexpectedly announced his refusal to sign the defence agreements which Houphou√´t-Boigny had negotiated with France on behalf of the four members of the Entente. This decision led to a deterioration of relations between C√¥te d'Ivoire and Upper Volta.Fr√©d√©ric Lejeal, op. cit., p.16 Relations between Upper Volta and France were also harmed by this and deteriorated further after Yam√©ogo expelled the French High Commissioner Paul Masson on false charges of conspiracy.Gabriel Massa, et Y. Georges Madi√©ga (dir.), op. cit., p.504Gabriel Massa, et Y. Georges Madi√©ga (dir.), op. cit., p.498 For the Burkinabe historian Yacouba Zerbo, the causes of Yam√©ogo's refusal lie in a desire for independence,Y√©nouyaba Georges Madi√©ga, et Oumarou Nao (dir.), op. cit., t.1, p.1048 combined with his lack of confidence in the French troops; on 17 October 1958, the French colonel Chevrau had given his support to Moro Naba Kougri. On 24 April 1961, Yam√©ogo signed an accord about technical military assistance with France alone.Y√©nouyaba Georges Madi√©ga and Oumarou Nao (ed.), op. cit., t.1, p.1047 Subsequently, he demanded the surrender of the French base at Bobo-Dioulasso by 31 December 1961,Y√©nouyaba Georges Madi√©ga and Oumarou Nao (dir.), op. cit., t.1, p.1046 in favour of the Voltaic Armed Forces (FAV) which had been created on 1 November.Fr√©d√©ric Guirma, op. cit., p.124  Rapprochement with the Casablanca Group (1961‚Äì1962)  Yam√©ogo meets Golda Meir during his visit to Israel in 1961 Maurice Yam√©ogo was a fervent anti-communist.Fr√©d√©ric Lejeal, op. cit., p.158 In December 1960, he co-founded the Brazzaville group with the \\"moderate\\" leaders of Francophone Africa, which combined with Anglophone leaders in May 1961 as the Monrovia Group. The Brazzaville and Monrovia Groups were strongly opposed to the \\"progressivist\\" Casablanca Group.Fr√©d√©ric Lejeal, op. cit., p.160 In March 1961, the Brazzaville Group created the African and Malagasy Union (UAM), a resolutely anti-communist organisation which included a defense pact. On 9 September 1961, Yam√©ogo succeeded in having Ouagadougou designated as the seat of the UAM's defense council and in having the Voltaic Albert Balima appointed secretary general.Fr√©d√©ric Guirma, op. cit., p.125 In June 1961, Yam√©ogo was the first African head of state to visit Israel, with which he signed a treaty of friendship and alliance. This did not mean an open break with the members of the Casablanca Group. Perhaps he saw this as a means of attracting American aid to his country. In any case, Ahmed S√©kou Tour√© of Guinea was received at the capital in May 1961, and Modibo Ke√Øta of Mali in March 1962. Relations with Kwame Nkrumah of Ghana were a top goal; Yam√©ogo went to Accra in May 1961 and hosted Nkrumah on 16 June.Fr√©d√©ric Lejeal, op. cit., p.163 In the resulting Tamal√© accords, Upper Volta and Ghana agreed to a customs union similar to that which had been made with C√¥te d'Ivoire.Bernard G√©rardin, Le d√©veloppement de la Haute-Volta : avec un avant-propos de G. de Bernis, Paris, Institut de science √©conomique appliqu√©e, 1963, p.39 Yam√©ogo enthusiastically called for a shared constitution for the two countries and declared \\"Long live the future United States of Africa!\\" Analysing the situation, the American ambassador to Upper Volta concluded that \\"Yam√©ogo is fairly pro-American, but he wants to be independent of France, which is to say that he needs American economic assistance.\\" He thought in particular that Yam√©ogo was attempting to end the French economic monopoly; French goods cost several times the price of the Japanese goods which could be imported through Ghana.Pierre-Michel Durand, L'Afrique et les relations franco-am√©ricaines des ann√©es soixante, Paris, √âditions L'Harmattan, 2007, p.99 The friendship between Yam√©ogo and Nkrumah was short lived. Yam√©ogo made up with F√©lix Houphou√´t-Boigny and the border controls with Ghana were re-established on 31 July 1962.Eureka (trimestriel), recueil des num√©ros 41 √† 48, Ouagadougou, CNRST, 2002, p.55 In July 1963, following a territorial dispute, Yam√©ogo denounced the \\"blatant expansionism\\" of Ghana. A little later, relations with Mali deteriorated over the question of the border to the north of Gorom-Gorom.  Return to the Ivoirien orbit (1962‚Äì1966)  On returning to the Ivoirien orbit, Yam√©ogo became a zealous supporter of F√©lix Houphou√´t-Boigny. In June 1965, after S√©kou Tour√© of Guinea had called Houphou√´t-Boigny a supporter of French imperialism hostile to African unity,Joachim Vokouma, \\"Amadou '‚ÄôBalak√©'‚Äô, la voix d'or du Burkina \\", 11 d√©cembre 2006, Online on lefaso.net Yam√©ogo appeared live on radio for close to an hour attacking the Guinean leader.Pierre-Michel Durand, op. cit., p. 219 He declared: A warming of relations with France came to fruition in 1964, with the signing of two military agreements, the second of which, signed on 24 October, granted France \\"the triple right of flight over, encampment in, and transit through, Voltaic territory.\\". President Yam√©ogo (center) viewing the United States Constitution during his state visit to the country in March 1965 The following year in March and April, Yam√©ogo was the first African head of state invited to the White House by President Lyndon Johnson.Pierre-Michel Durand, op. cit., p. 306 This honour, a complete surprise, was partially due to the fact that Yam√©ogo had a farm and so it was supposed that he would appreciate being hosted by Johnson on his ranch. Taking advantage of the situation, Presidents F√©lix Houphou√´t-Boigny and Hamani Diori asked Yam√©ogo to submit a request for American financial aid to the president on their behalf.Alain Saint Robespierre, \\" Banques suisses : O√π est pass√© le milliard de Maurice Yam√©ogo ? \\", L'Observateur Paalga, 30 mai 2007, online on lefaso.net Yam√©ogo returned from the United States with three billion CFA Francs to be split equally between himself, Houphou√´t-Boigny and Diori. On Houphou√´t-Boigny's advice he placed his billion in a private Swiss bank account. He used these funds to finance the legislative election campaign of 7 November 1965. During his trip, Houphou√´t-Boigny had also entrusted him with another task. Taking advantage of the fact the Yam√©ogo was the only member of the Entente without a full defensive treaty with the French, he instructed Yam√©ogo to request a military treaty with the United States which would cover C√¥te d'Ivoire and Niger as well as Upper Volta in the event of a Chinese invasion, a threat which France was seeking to ignore.Pierre-Michel Durand, op. cit., p.307 Yam√©ogo and Houphou√´t-Boigny also worked on a project of double nationality between Ivory Coast and Upper Volta. However, when Yam√©ogo left the presidency on January 3, 1966, Houphou√´t-Boigny abandoned this project of double nationality. On October 17, 1965, Yam√©ogo married Suzanne de Monaco, a young Ivorian woman. F√©lix Houphou√´t-Boigny (President of Ivory Coast) and Hamani Diori (President of Niger) were the witnesses at his marriage. However, this union did not last long and Maurice married a third time with Jeannette. Yam√©ogo had many children. = Internal affairs under Yam√©ogo =  Degradation of the social climate  Ouagadougou cathedral With a strong Christian outlook, Yam√©ogo's dictatorial regime initially enjoyed the support of the Voltaic Catholic church.Fran√ßois Constantin and Christian Coulon, Religion et transition d√©mocratique en Afrique, Paris, √âditions Karthala, 1997, p. 229 In 1964, subsidies were removed for private schools (almost all of which were Catholic schools).Fran√ßois Constantin et Christian Coulon, op. cit., p. 230 The clergy, whose finances were thereby threatened, became more critical. The rupture became definitive in 1965. In that year, Yam√©ogo imprisoned his wife F√©licit√©,Fr√©d√©ric Guirma, op. cit., p. 137 divorced her and married his mistress \\"Miss C√¥te d'Ivoire\\" Nathalie Monaco on 17 October in a sumptuous ceremony, at which President F√©lix Houphou√´t-Boigny of C√¥te d'Ivoire and Hamani Diori of Niger served as groomsmen. The happy couple honeymooned in the Caribbean and Brazil. At the instruction of the head of the Voltaic church, cardinal Paul Zoungrana, the church invested all its moral authority in discrediting Yam√©ogo.Charles Kabeya Muase, op. cit., p. 72 The religious climate declined still further when Yam√©ogo returned from his honeymoon and clumsily attacked charlatans and marabouts by radio, provoking the indignation of Muslims.Fr√©d√©ric Guirma, op. cit., p. 138 Throughout his presidency, Yam√©ogo took measures against traditional chieftainship ‚Äì undoubtedly motivated by republican ideals.Claude H√©l√®ne Perrot and Fran√ßois-Xavier Fauvelle-Aymar, Le retour des rois: les autorit√©s traditionnelles et l'√©tat en Afrique contemporaine, Paris, √âditions Karthala, 1999, p. 235 In January 1962, a decree forbade the display of all insignia recalling the customary chieftainships of the colonial period. On 28 July 1964, a decree stated that should any village chieftainship fall vacant, it should be replaced by an election in which all inhabitants of the village on the electoral roll would be allowed to participate. On 11 January 1965, a new decree ended government subsidies for chiefs.Claude H√©l√®ne Perrot et Fran√ßois-Xavier Fauvelle-Aymar, op. cit., p. 236 These decisions were very well received in the west of the country where chiefs had not existed until introduced by the French. In the east on the other hand, they provoked anger against Yam√©ogo. In turn, Yam√©ogo lost the support of the traditional elite, the unions, and the clergy. His excessive spending, such as the construction of a Party Palace,Pascal Zagr√©, op. cit., p. 60 did not help a situation which grew more dire in March and April 1965, when a measles epidemic struck the country as a result of a vaccine shortage.Charles Kabeya Muase, op. cit., p. 64 In October, the shortage of classrooms and teachers made the beginning of the school year particularly difficult. Many students had to be refused education, although the enrolment rate was only 8%.Pascal Zagr√©, op. cit., p. 39 In December 1965, Yam√©ogo's project with Houphou√´t-Boigny to grant dual nationality to all citizens of Upper Volta and C√¥te d'Ivoire brought an end to his popularity. For most inhabitants of Upper Volta, this project implied a return to exploitation by Ivoiriens.  Economic weakness  At independence, Upper Volta's economy was amongst the weakest in the world. The annual GDP was around 40 billion CFA francs,Pascal Zagr√©, op. cit., p.38 almost entirely derived from subsistence activities.Pascal Zagr√©, op. cit., p.49 94% of the country's 3,600,000 inhabitants worked in agriculture, of which 85% focussed on the cultivation of food.Y√©nouyaba Georges Madi√©ga and Oumarou Nao (ed.), op. cit., t.2, p.1600 The tiny industrial sector employed around 4,000 people in some forty factories focussed on food processing. There were only two power stations at this time, one in Ouagadougou and the other at Bobo-Dioulasso, with a maximum power of 3.5 MegaWatts and 3,000 customers. Upper Volta has a total of 509 km of railway and 15,000 km of roads (only tar-sealed in a few urban centres).Pascal Zagr√©, op. cit., p.40 Despite efforts undertaken by the French authorities after 1954, Voltaic agriculture remained unproductive.Y√©nouyaba Georges Madi√©ga, et Oumarou Nao (dir.), op. cit., t.2, p.1599 The planned establishment of a mentoring system and construction of hydro-electric dams between 1958 and 1962, co-financed by the French Aid and Cooperation Funds (FAC) and the Republic of Upper Volta, fell disappointingly short of its goals.Y√©nouyaba Georges Madi√©ga, et Oumarou Nao (dir.), op. cit., t.2, p.1595-1596 Undiscouraged, the state encouraged the establishment of co- operatives and credit unions,Y√©nouyaba Georges Madi√©ga, et Oumarou Nao (dir.), op. cit., t.2, p.1597 and established a five-year plan for the period 1963 to 1967.Y√©nouyaba Georges Madi√©ga, et Oumarou Nao (dir.), op. cit., t.2, p.1598 This ambitious plan predicted a sustained increase in agricultural production of 4.7% per year.Pascal Zagr√©, op. cit., p.53 However, the cost of the plan, estimated at 1.5 billion CFA francs, prevented its implementation.Charles Kabeya Muase, op. cit., p.66 Yam√©ogo turned to Franco-Voltaic co-operation agreements to obtain aid from French companies for rural development. These companies introduced new agricultural techniques for the cultivation of foodstuffs.Y√©nouyaba Georges Madi√©ga, et Oumarou Nao (dir.), op. cit., t.2, p.1603 Improvement in nutrition was observed in areas of dietary deficit.Y√©nouyaba Georges Madi√©ga, et Oumarou Nao (dir.), op. cit., t.2, p.1604 These efforts, along with a guaranteed, pre-announced price for agriculture, led to an increase in the production of cotton from 8,000 tonnes in 1963 to 20,000 tonnes in 1967. Cotton had a growing role in Upper Volta's exports, which reached 3.68 billion CFA francs in 1965.Direction du commerce, Commerce ext√©rieur et balance commerciale de la R√©publique Haute-Volta, Ouagadougou, Bureau d'√©tudes et de documentation, 1970, p.2 Two-thirds of their value derived from livestock.Direction du commerce, op. cit., p.5 Despite being fairly mineral poor, the country exported 687 million CFA francs of unrefined gold between 1961 and 1963. It is notable that Upper Volta was the only country in Africa whose main export partners were other African states.Direction du commerce, op. cit., p.7 Its main export partner was C√¥te d'Ivoire, although Ghana took the role in 1963 with 40.5% of Upper Volta's exports, before being relegated to second place in 1965 with 17.6%. France, the third most important export partner of Upper Volta, was the source of 52% of the 9.169 billion CFA francs worth of imported products in 1965. In 1965 the balance of trade was very negative, with a deficit of 5.489 billion CFA francs. = Austerity plans = Headquarters of the BCEAO in Dakar Throughout his presidency, Yam√©ogo sought every opportunity to obtain extra resources, much of which he was granted free of charge. Through subsidies, the French treasury gifted him 1.7 billion CFA francs.Pascal Zagr√©, op. cit., p.56 Ghana advanced him a customs rebate of 1.1177 billion in 1961. The Central Bank of West African States (BCEAO) granted him 600 million in budgetary support. But all this was insufficient to meet the state's budgetary shortfall, which increased after the departure of French troops in 1961. Yam√©ogo met this with loans and the treasury's cash reserves. At the end of 1965, after five years of independence, Upper Volta's budget deficit exceeded 4.5 billion CFA francs.Pascal Zagr√©, op. cit., p.55 Therefore, in 1964, austerity measures were introduced.Pascal Zagr√©, op. cit., p.58 An allowance has been made on special duty allowances, foreign embassies were reduced, and the representational allowance of the president was reduced from 18 to 9 million CFA francs. The resulting savings came to 250 million CFA francs. For the 1965 budget, Yam√©ogo decided to take more draconian measures. Payments to chiefs and subsidies for private schools were cancelled. Monthly family allowances were reduced from 2,500 to 1,500 CFA francs per child and limited to families with less than six children. These unpopular measures allowed him to reduce the budget deficit by 4.5%. Encouraged by these results, Yam√©ogo appointed a young, French-educated technocrat, Rapha√´l Medah, in charge of finance on 8 December 1965.Pascal Zagr√©, op. cit., p.59 He intended to: * increase the budgetary revenue by levying a 10% flat tax on income (IFR) and suppressing the preferential tariff on Ivoirien imports. * reduce state expenditures, by suppressing all the chiefs of cabinet, blocking all pay increases for two years, and limiting government cars to ministers alone. * reduce the budget deficit by cutting the pensions of old veterans by 16% and lowering family grants from 1,500 ti 750 CFA francs. But the true measure was the reduction by 20% of all the salaries of civil servants with the fall by 10% of scheduled taxes. This financial austerity plan was, ultimately the cause of the regime's downfall. = Fall from power =  Popular uprising on 3 January 1966  Although autonomous unions had officially been resolved in May 1964, they reformed in December 1965 as an inter-union front led by Joseph Ou√©draogo, in order to denounce Yam√©ogo's austerity plans. Yam√©ogo was then in C√¥te d'Ivoire to discuss the dual nationality agreement.Mahorou Kanazoe, \\" Ev√©n√©ments du 3 janvier 1966 : Le '‚ÄôDirca'‚Äô de Maurice Yam√©ogo √† c≈ìur ouvert \\", Le pays, 2 janvier 2008, online on lefaso.net As the situation escalated, the director of the cabinet, Adama Andr√© Compaor√© called Yam√©ogo to inform him. He did not recognise the seriousness of the situation and assumed that there was no reason to worry. On 31 December, the unionists organised a meeting at the labour council, where they called for a general strike on 3 January 1966.Charles Kabeya Muase, op. cit., p.77 This gathering had been forbidden by the minister of the interior, Denis Yam√©ogo, and was dispersed by the police forces. Maurice Yam√©ogo returned to Upper Volta on the same day and celebrated New Year's Eve without concern for the mounting troubles. On 1 January 1966, Yam√©ogo finally decided to proclaim a state of emergency: all protests were forbidden and the strikes were declared illegal.Fr√©d√©ric Lejeal, op. cit., p.81 In order to discredit the inter-union front's actions, Joseph Ou√©draogo was accused of espionage on behalf of the communists. Officials were threatened with collective dismissal if they participated in the movement.Charles Kabeya Muase, op. cit., Finally, he demanded that religious authorities intervene to calm the situation. They refused since they were not on good terms with Yam√©ogo. Along with the traditional elite, they gave their support to the movement.Charles Kabeya Muase, op. cit., Even so, the 1st and 2 January were relatively calm. It was only on the night of the 2nd that events began to come to a head. Yam√©ogo failed in his efforts to arrest the leaders of the inter-union front at the labour council. He ordered several armoured cars to be stationed around the palace and garrisoned the key public buildings, particularly the radio stations. The protest began in the morning of 3 January. It seems to have been the wife of Joseph Ki-Zerbo, Jacqueline, who opened the protests with her schoolgirls.Roger Bila Kabor√©, op. cit., Carrying signs calling for \\"Bread, water, and democracy,\\" they were soon joined by the students of the Philippe Zinda Kabor√© high school. These students were soon joined by more than 100,000 people of Ouagadougou, including numerous officials calling for the cancellation of the 20% cut to their salaries. The protest was not violent. Allegedly, the police themselves took part in the protests.Fr√©d√©ric Guirma, op. cit., Late in the afternoon, Yam√©ogo made it known to the protesters by means of his chief of staff, lieutenant-colonel Sangoul√© Lamizana, that he would cancel the 20% cut and retain the existing rate of subsidies.Charles Kabeya Muase, op. cit., But the situation had moved beyond the demands of Joseph Ou√©draogo's unionistsFr√©d√©ric Guirma, op. cit., and the crowd, led by the historian Joseph Ki-Zerbo called for the resignation of the President, who was cut off in camp Guillaume Ou√©draogo. Finally, to resolve the situation, the leading protesters appealed to the army to take power.  Resignation  After several hours of negotiations, Maurice Yam√©ogo went on the radio at 4 pm and announced his decision to hand power over to lieutenant-colonel Sangoul√© Lamizana: The Army was in control; the Constitution was suspended, the National Assembly was dissolved, and Lt. Col. Sangoul√© Lamizana was placed at the head of a government essentially run by senior army officers. The army remained in power for four years, and on June 14, 1970, the Voltans ratified a new Constitution that established a four-year transition period toward complete civilian rule. Lamizana remained in power throughout the 1970s as president of military or mixed civil-military governments. After a conflict arising over the 1970 Constitution, a new constitution was written and approved in 1977, and Lamizana was reelected through open elections in 1978.Historycentral. (2006). BURKINA FASO Retrieved March 19, 2006 from There are two different accounts of Yam√©ogo's decision to resign. According to Fr√©d√©ric Guirma who interviewed Sangoul√© Lamizana in 1967, Maurice Yam√©ogo had ordered the chief of the FAV to restore order by firing on the crowd.Fr√©d√©ric Guirma, op. cit., Lamizana s reported to have replied that before an army would ever fire on its people, the order must be made in writing. Yam√©ogo refused to do this and continued to insist that the chief do as instructed. Lamizana then consulted with his officers, the majority of which were opposed.Fr√©d√©ric Guirma, op. cit., Yam√©ogo then decided to announce a \\"transfer of competences\\" in ambiguous terms, intending to resume control once the crisis was over.Fr√©d√©ric Guirma, op. cit., But as a result of popular pressure, he had to resign himself to signing his full resignation. Yam√©ogo told the historian Ibrahim Baba Kak√© that he had resigned in order to prevent any bloodshed.Lefaso.net . (2009).

Lamizana, in tears, had reluctantly agreed to take power. After the presidency = Imprisonment and disenfranchisement (1966‚Äì1970)= Yam√©ogo's friend, Ivoirien President F√©lix Houphou√´t-Boigny Against the advice of the unionists, Lamizana had the deposed president escorted to Koudougou.Alain Foka, op. cit., 3e partie A little later, his supporters decided to enter the capital in order to contest the decision. A military force was immediately sent out to maintain order. Finally, to prevent any further incidents, the government placed Yam√©ogo under house arrest in Ouagadougou on 6 January. Yam√©ogo took this detention very badly, to the point of attempting to take his own life in December 1966.Commission de publication des documents diplomatiques fran√ßais, Documents diplomatiques fran√ßais, Paris, Imprimerie nationale, 2008, His friend F√©lix Houphou√´t-Boigny was moved by this and put active pressure on the French government to demand Yam√©ogo's release. On 28 April 1967, Yam√©ogo was brought before a special tribunal charged with investigating his years in power.Jean- Pierre Bejot, ¬´Gal A. Sangoul√© Lamizana, portrait d‚Äôun combattant (2) ¬ª, La D√©p√™che Diplomatique, Online on lefaso.net On 5 August 1967, his son Hermann Yam√©ogo attempted to launch a coup d'√©tat to free him, which failed. After these events, Charles de Gaulle boycotted Sangoul√© Lamizana in order to obtain Yam√©ogo's release. He received a promise. But time passed and in January 1968, Yam√©ogo made a second attempt at suicide by drinking a strong dose of Nivaquine. Finally, on 8 May 1969, Yam√©ogo was condemned in a closed court to five years of forced labour and banishment for life with the loss of all civil rights. A few days after this verdict, Lamizana issued a presidential pardon and on 5 August 1970, Yam√©ogo was set free. In the course of these events, Yam√©ogo's property had been seized.Alain Saint Robespierre, ¬´Koudougou : Dans les profondeurs des ruines pr√©sidentielles ¬ª, L'Observateur Paalga, 30 mai 2007, Online on lefaso.net This included the palace which he had built in his hometown of Koudougou in 1964, officially as a result of the alleged seizure of his villa in the French Riviera and thanks to a French private bank loan.

In the legislative elections of 1977, the UNDD became the second-largest political party in the country after the UDV-RDA. In the presidential elections of 1978, the party fielded the banker Macaire Ou√©draogo as their candidate, since Maurice Yam√©ogo was barred from running due to his disenfranchisement and Hermann Yam√©ogo was too young to run. Ou√©draogo was defeated by Lamizana in the second round on 28 May 1978. In 1980, Upper Volta suffered several coups d'√©tat. In May 1983, Maurice Yam√©ogo organised a protest in favour of president Jean-Baptiste Ou√©draogo. On 4 August 1983, Ou√©draogo was overthrown by the National Council of the Revolution (CNR) commanded by Thomas Sankara. The country was renamed Burkina Faso. On 9 November 1983, Yam√©ogo was brought to the Conseil de l'Entente by Sankara's men in order to be shot. He survived thanks to Blaise Compaor√© who proposed his imprisonment at the P√¥ military camp. On the first anniversary of Sankara's revolution in 1984, Maurice Yam√©ogo was set free. On this occasion, he declared his allegiance to Thomas Sankara on radio. After some time in Koudougou, Yam√©ogo settled in C√¥te d'Ivoire in spring 1987. He enjoyed a role as an intermediary between the government of Burkina Faso and president F√©lix Houphou√´t-Boigny. In May 1991, Blaise Compaor√©, now president of Burkina Faso, ordered his rehabilitation. This decision followed a letter written to him by Yam√©ogo in 1987 seeking the final settlement of the confiscation of his property.

It was developed from the twin-seat Lockheed T-33 Shooting Star in the late 1940s as an all-weather, day/night interceptor. The aircraft reached operational service in May 1950 with Air Defense Command, replacing the piston-engined North American F-82 Twin Mustang in the all- weather interceptor role. The F-94 was the first operational USAF fighter equipped with an afterburner and was the first jet-powered all-weather fighter to enter combat during the Korean War in January 1953. It had a relatively brief operational life, being replaced in the mid-1950s by the Northrop F-89 Scorpion and North American F-86D Sabre. The last aircraft left active-duty service in 1958 and Air National Guard service in 1959. Design and development Lockheed YF-94 (S/N 48-373). This was the second aircraft built (from TF-80C) Built to a 1948 USAF specification for a radar-equipped interceptor to replace the aging F-61 Black Widow and North American F-82 Twin Mustang, it was specifically designed to counter the threat of the USSR's new Tupolev Tu-4 bombers (reverse-engineered Boeing B-29). The Curtiss-Wright XF-87 Blackhawk had been designated to be the USAF first jet night fighter, but its performance was subpar, and Lockheed was asked to design a jet night fighter on a crash program basis.Coniglio, Serigio. \\"F-94 Starfire (Monopama Special File).\\" Aviation and Marine International, Issue 34, June 1976. The F-94 was derived from the TF-80C (later T-33A Shooting Star) which was a two- seat trainer version of the F-80 Shooting Star. A lengthened nose area with guns, radar, and automatic fire control system was added. Since the conversion seemed so simple, a contract was awarded to Lockheed in early 1949, with the first flight on 16 April 1949. The early test YF-94s used 75% of the parts used in the earlier F-80 and T-33As. The fire control system was the Hughes E-1, which incorporated an AN/APG-33 radar (derived from the AN/APG-3, which directed the Convair B-36's tail guns) and a Sperry A-1C computing gunsight.Hallion 1980, p. 17. This short-range radar system was useful only in the terminal phases of the interception. Most of the operation would be directed using ground-controlled interception, as was the case with the earlier aircraft it replaced. The added weight of the electronic equipment required a more powerful engine, so the standard J-33 turbojet engine, which had been fitted to the T-33A, was replaced with an afterburning Allison J33-A-33. The combination reduced the internal fuel capacity. The F-94 was to be the first US production jet with an afterburner. The J33-A-33 had standard thrust of , and with water injection this was increased to and with afterburning a maximum of thrust.\\"Technical Gen\\". RAF Flying Review, September 1962, p. 59. The YF-94A's afterburner had many teething problems with its igniter and the flame stabilization system. =Production versions= F-94A 49-2548, 2d Fighter-Interceptor Squadron, McGuire AFB, NJ F-94A The initial production model was the F-94A, which entered operational service in May 1950. Its armament was four 0.50 in (12.7 mm) M3 Browning machine guns mounted in the fuselage with the muzzles exiting just behind the radome. Two drop tanks, as carried by the F-80 and T-33, could be carried beneath the wingtips. Alternatively, these could be replaced by bombs, giving the aircraft a secondary fighter bomber role.Francillon 1982, p. 294. 109 were produced. The F-94A was in operational service for only a brief time as it was originally built, and was not received well by its aircrews. Primarily, this was due to the unreliability of its J33 engine, which caused many ground aborts and was deemed by the crews to be unsafe. The aircraft was judged as unstable and hard to maneuver at high altitude by its pilots. The pilot and radar operator found that the cockpit was too narrow for them to be able to get in and out of the aircraft quickly during alerts and scrambles. The clearance for the ejection seats was too small, resulting in several tragic accidents during emergency ejections.Isham and McLaren (1993) Lockheed F-94 Starfire, A Photo Chronicale, Schiffer Publishing, Ltd, 61st Fighter- Interceptor Squadron Lockheed F-94B 50-879 F-94B The subsequent F-94B, which entered service in January 1951, was outwardly virtually identical to the F-94A. The Allison J33 turbojet had a number of modifications made, which made it a very reliable engine; the pilot was provided with a more roomy cockpit and the canopy was replaced by a canopy with a bow frame in the center between the two crew members, as well as a new Instrument Landing System (ILS). 356 of these were built. It proved in service to be a very reliable aircraft with relatively few problems. As they replaced the F-94As in service with the active-duty squadrons, the older models were sent to Lockheed to be re-engined and modified to F-94B standards. These upgraded F-94A/B aircraft were also modified with a pod under each wing for two additional 0.50 in (12.7 mm) machine guns, bringing the total to eight. These aircraft were then passed along to Air National Guard units where they served until the end of the 1950s. FFARs F-94C The F-94C Starfire was extensively modified from the early F-94 variants. In fact, it was initially designated F-97, but it was ultimately decided to treat it as a new version of the F-94. USAF interest was lukewarm, so Lockheed funded development themselves, converting two F-94B airframes to YF-94C prototypes for evaluation. To improve performance, a completely new, much thinner wing was designed, along with a swept tail surface. The J33 engine was replaced with a more powerful Pratt & Whitney J48, a license-built version of the afterburning Rolls-Royce Tay, which dramatically increased power, producing a dry thrust of and approximately with afterburning. The fire control system was upgraded to the new Hughes E-5 with an AN/APG-40 radar in a much larger nose. The guns were removed and replaced with all-rocket armament consisting of four groups of six rockets in a ring around the nose. The rockets were carried in four panels that could be hinged upwards and outwards for ground reloading. In flight these rockets were normally hidden aft of doors that folded inwards for combat. According to Lockheed test pilot Tony LeVier, the F-94C was capable of supersonic flight in a steep dive with afterburner engaged.Test Pilot, edited by Harry Schmidt, Mach 2 Books, PO Box 107, Shelton, CT 06484, 1997, p.107 The F-94C was the only variant to be officially named Starfire. With time, the entire F-94 family has adopted the name. The first production F-94C aircraft were delivered in July 1951, 387 examples being delivered before May 1954. The largest problem discovered in service was the nose-mounted rockets, which blinded the crew with their smoke and fire. The most severe problem associated with firing the nose-mounted rockets was that the exhaust could cause a flameout of the jet engine, which could lead to loss of the aircraft. Mid-wing rocket pods were added, holding 12 rockets apiece. Most of the time, the nose rockets were not fitted, and the mid-wing pod rockets were the sole armament. This version of the aircraft was extensively used within the Semi Automatic Ground Environment (SAGE) air defense system. F-94 FA-356 F-94D An F-94D model was proposed as a single-seat fighter bomber, with bombs and rockets under the wings. A single prototype was built, but the model was not accepted for production. The prototype was later used as a testbed for the 20 mm (0.79 in) M61 Vulcan cannon subsequently used on the F-104 Starfighter and many others. Operational history =Air Defense Command= The primary user of the F-94 were the squadrons of Air Defense Command (ADC), eventually equipping 26 squadrons of interceptors. The first F-94As were assigned to the 325th Fighter-All Weather Group at McChord AFB and Moses Lake AFB, Washington. Baugher Lockheed F-94A It replaced the propeller-driven F-82F Twin Mustangs that were in use by its 317th, 318th, and 319th squadrons. The F-82s had been pressed into interceptor service in 1949 after the Soviet Union displayed the Tupolev Tu-4 strategic bomber, a reversed-engineered version of the B-29 Superfortress, some of which had landed and were impounded in the Soviet Far East during World War II. The F-82Fs proved to be an excellent day/night all- weather interceptor, with long range, but it lacked any logistics support which resulted in a chronic shortage of parts. The jet-powered F-94As, however, had shorter legs than the F-82s and relied more on Ground Control Interception Radar (GCI) sites to vector them to intruding aircraft. 27th FIS F-94C 51-13555 at Griffiss Air Force Base, New York Once the 317th was equipped in the Pacific Northwest, ADC then re-equipped its 52d Fighter-All Weather Group at McGuire AFB, New Jersey which also flew F-82Fs and provided air defense of the Northeastern United States. However, it was during this period that Air Defense Command began dispersing its Fighter-Interceptor squadrons away from their parent groups to individual bases. During 1950 and 1951, ADC sent F-94As to squadrons of the 56th Fighter Group in the upper Midwest to replace its obsolete F-47 Thunderbolts, F-51 Mustangs, as well as F-80 Shooting Star and F-86A Sabre day jet interceptors. In March 1951, upgraded F-94Bs were received from Lockheed by the 33d Fighter Wing at Otis AFB, Massachusetts, replacing their F-86A Sabres,Baugher Lockheed F-94B although the last squadron of the wing didn't replace its Sabres until May 1952. Three Federalized Air National Guard units, the 121st FIS (DC ANG), 142nd FIS (Maine ANG), and 148th FIS (Pennsylvania ANG), received F-94Bs while they served on active duty during the Korean War call-up to defend the airspace over Washington, D.C. However, these F-94s were retained by the USAF when these ANG squadrons returned to State control in 1952. Also seven more squadrons received F-94Bs as part of the roll out from Lockheed. Three additional squadrons (84th, 436th, and 479th FIS) received F-94Bs in 1953, although these were passed down from squadrons receiving F-94Cs. Beginning in the summer of 1951, the F-94Cs began coming off the production line, with six squadrons being equipped by May 1954. Five more squadrons were equipped in FY 54-55 which ended the production run for the interceptor by Lockheed.Baugher Lockheed F-97/F-94C Starfire =Far East Air Force= In the Pacific, Far East Air Force (FEAF) equipped three squadrons with F-94Bs, and Air Defense Command deployed the 319th Fighter-Interceptor Squadron to South Korea to provide a jet air-defense umbrella over the Seoul area. The first shipment of F-94Bs arrived in Japan in March 1951, being assigned to the 339th Fighter-All Weather Squadron at Johnson Air Base. Also arriving was a mobile training unit from Chanute AFB, Illinois to provide transition training for the F-82G Twin Mustang pilots into the new jet interceptor. In May, F-94Bs began to re-equip the 68th FAWS at Itazuke Air Base, while rotating pilots and radar operators to Suwon Air Base in South Korea where they flew combat missions over North Korea with the F-82Gs as well as air defense alert over Seoul. In July, the 4th FAWS began receiving the F-94As at Naha Air Base, Okinawa. Training for the squadrons proceeded through the summer and in August, the first Fifth Air Force Operational Readiness Test was held by the 339th FAWS with the F-94. Various issues with the aircraft, as well as issues with the Ground Control Interception radar graded the test as \\"fair\\". Formation of 4th FIS F-94Bs, Naha AB, Okinawa 68th Fighter-Interceptor Squadron F-94B 51-5358 at Suwon AB, South Korea In early December 1951 the appearance of Communist MiG-15 jets over Seoul raised alarm bells at FEAF Headquarters. The only interceptors over Seoul were about six F-82Gs along with some Marine Grumman F7F Tigercats. FEAF ordered the 68th to move two F-94Bs to Suwon to supplement the F-82Fs. The Twin Mustangs along with the F7Fs would continue their armed reconnaissance and weather missions against North Korean targets, while the F-94s would fly interception missions over South Korea and the Yellow Sea. Care was taken to not fly the Starfires anywhere that a crash would allow the communists access to the wreck if it were shot down. In January 1952, ADC was ordered to deploy the 319th Fighter-Interceptor Squadron from the 25th Air Division at Larson AFB, Washington to Japan, and to relieve the 68th FIS at Itazuke. A detachment of the ADC squadron was sent to Misawa AB to fly air defense missions over Northern Honshu and Hokkaido against any intruding Soviet aircraft from Sakhalin Island or the Vladivostok area. At Suwon, the 68th had a total of fifty-eight interceptions during February during nighttime hours. It was in February 1952 that the first F-94 was lost in a night interception while pursuing an unknown aircraft over the Yellow Sea. The cause of the loss was unknown. However, a B-26 pilot observed an explosion in the air between the island of Taeyonp'yong-do and the city of Haeju in North Korea. A search was made for the aircraft and crew, which continued for almost three months. It was finally concluded the aircraft had crashed and broken up over the Yellow Sea, with the wreckage settling in deep water with the classified equipment lost at sea. In March 1952 the 319th FIS began flying operational missions at Suwon, providing Combat Air Patrols (CAPs) for B-29 Superfortress missions at night. The 68th was relieved and reassigned to Japan, but would remain on one- hour alert for possible combat duty over Korea. In June, the first F-94 contacts against enemy jets was made and the interceptor crews believed at the time that the communists were testing radar-warning equipment. On several occasions just when they were ready to fire on the enemy aircraft, it would start evasive action that indicated the MiGs were equipped with a form of warning radar (as the F-94s were). Other intercepts would take place over North Korea and the F-94 was credited with several air-to-air victories, including the first jet-vs.-jet night victory against a MiG-15. One F-94 was listed as lost due to enemy action, six more to non-enemy causes on combat missions, two were declared as missing on a combat mission and three were lost in accidents.Isham, Marty J. and David R. McLaren. Lockheed F-94 Starfire. Atglen, Pennsylvania: Schiffer, 1993, Chapter 7. One F-94 was lost when it slowed to during pursuit of a Po-2 biplane.Grier, Peter. April 15, 1953. Air Force Magazine, Air Force Association, June 2011, page 57. After the Armistice in Korea in June 1953, the F-94s continued to fly air defense missions over Japan and South Korea. Beginning in 1954, the F-86D Sabre began replacing it in operational service. By the end of 1954, the Starfires had been returned to the United States for Air National Guard duty. =Alaskan Air Command= Immediately after World War II ended, most of the Eleventh Air Force in Alaska was withdrawn, and its assets were concentrated at two bases, Ladd AFB near Fairbanks and Elmendorf AFB near Anchorage. With the advent of the Soviet Tu-4 and its possessing the Atomic Bomb, US air defense assets were sent to Alaska to guard against a Soviet attack on the United States coming from Siberia. Chains of Ground Control Radar sites were established under Alaskan Air Command (AAC), the postwar successor to Eleventh Air Force, and P-61 Black Widows were sent in 1948 as long distance interceptor aircraft. The F-82H Twin Mustang replaced the war-weary P-61s in 1949.Chloe, John Hale, (1984), Top Cover for America. the Air Force in Alaska. 1920‚Äì1983, Pictorial Histories Publishing Company, These propeller-driven interceptors were augmented in 1950 when the 449th Fighter-All Weather Squadron at Ladd AFB began receiving F-94As in mid-1950s. The squadron was divided into the F-82 flight and the F-94 flight as the jet interceptors doubled the squadron in size.Thompson, Warren E (October 2003). \\"Alaskan Twin Mustangs, North American F-82 Operations in Alaska\\". Wings (Sentry Books) In Anchorage, the 57th Fighter Group at Elmendorf AFB began sending its F-80C Shooting Stars back to the Continental United States in batches of four or five as they were replaced by the F-94As. Elmendorf AFB, being located close to the Gulf of Alaska in the south had much more moderate weather than Ladd AFB, located in Central Alaska where winter temperatures often fell below . Hydraulic fluids would turn to jelly, and the engines in the jets would have starting problems. Extreme cold weather training for Air Force personnel assigned to Ladd AFB was mandatory in the event of an emergency ejection or even just being outside in the winter, losing a glove, and dropping a wrench or tool. Skin would freeze upon touching bare metal, and mechanics would have tools \\"welded\\" to their fingers at times. 449th Fighter-Interceptor Squadron F-94A parked outside a hangar at Ladd AFB The 449th utilized its F-82Hs as long-range reconnaissance aircraft along the Siberian coastline and the Chukchi Peninsula. Also the F-82s were flown in a ground support role during maneuvers with the Army forces. They would also drop bombs on frozen rivers to break up ice floes. For these missions, the F-94 was totally unsuitable and it also did not have the range for the long distance reconnaissance flights necessary to monitor the Siberian coast. Alaska was divided into two areas, the northern part under the 11th Air Division, headquartered at Ladd AFB, and had control of the GCI sites in the northern half of the territory. The 57th Fighter Group, based at Elmendorf AFB, was responsible for everything south. In April 1953, the 57th FIG was inactivated and the three squadrons F-94s at Elmendorf AFB became part of the 10th Air Division. Both the 449th FIS and the 57th FIG deployed the F-94s to advance airfields at Marks AFB, near Nome, along with King Salmon Airport and Galena AFB where it stood alert to respond to GCI intruder alerts for unknown aircraft detected intruding on Alaskan airspace. The F-82Hs at Ladd were retired in the summer of 1953 when due to lack of logistics support, the aircraft became too unreliable to keep in the air. The 449th flew the F-94A until F-94Bs became available as hand-me-downs from Elmendorf AFB the 57th FIG was inactivated replaced by the 10th Air Division. There, the 10th AD received new F-86D Sabre Interceptors. The 449th at Ladd sent their F-94As back to the CONUS and Air National Guard Service. By the end of 1954, it also was being re-equipped with F-86Ds, with the last of the Starfires also being sent to the Air National Guard. =Northeast Air Command= Northeast Air Command (NEAC) was a command formed in 1950 to administer US-controlled bases in the Maritime Provinces of Canada, that were under long-term lease going back to World War II. It was responsible for the defense of the northern approaches to North America and also to support transient aircraft of MATS and SAC, all of which came under the collective command and control of the 64th Air Division.US Air Defense in the Northeast, Lydus H. Buss, USAF Continental Air Defense Command, 1957 59th Fighter-Interceptor Squadron F-94B 50-881 flying over Labrador In 1952, F-94Bs were sent to the 59th Fighter-Interceptor Squadron at Goose AFB, Labrador from Otis AFB, Massachusetts, also a detachment of the 59th was sent to Thule AB, Greenland to provide air defense of the base, although it was still under construction to back up the DEW Line. Thule was a staging base at the time for the SAC B-36 Peacemaker intercontinental bomber, which would proceed from there in wartime to targets in the Soviet Union using the great circle route over the North Pole. This was both the first F-89 squadron assigned to Canada and also the first squadron assigned to NEAC.Maurer, Maurer, ed. (1982) [1969]. Combat Squadrons of the Air Force, World War II (reprint ed.). Washington, DC: Office of Air Force History. . LCCN 70605402 After the end of the Korean War, the 319th FIS, which was deployed from ADC to Japan in 1952, was transferred to NEAC in June 1953 and replaced the detachment of the 59th FIS at Thule. The third and last F-94 squadron assigned to NEAC was the 61st Fighter-Interceptor Squadron, which moved from Selfridge AFB, Michigan to Ernest Harmon AFB, Newfoundland in August 1953. Beginning in 1954, and continuing until 1957, the Starfires of NEAC were slowly replaced with versions of the F-89 Scorpion, although the Northrop interceptor didn't fully replace the Starfires until the 318th Fighter-Interceptor Squadron left Thule in April 1957. Keflavik Airport, Iceland, although controlled by Military Air Transport Service (MATS), received F-94Bs as part of the 82d Fighter-Interceptor Squadron in April 1953 It provided air defense of Iceland until being relieved in October 1954 when it was reassigned to Presque Isle AFB, Maine. The Starfires were replaced by the 57th FIS and F-89C Scorpions. =Retirement= The F-94A/B models were replaced in the active-duty inventory beginning in mid-1954 by a combination of the Northrop F-89C/D Scorpion and the North American F-86D Sabre interceptors.A Handbook of Aerospace Defense Organization 1946 - 1980, by Lloyd H. Cornett and Mildred W. Johnson, Office of History, Aerospace Defense Center, Peterson Air Force Base, Colorado They were sent to Air National Guard units where they replaced North American F-80C Shooting Stars and F-51D/H Mustangs, which in most cases marked the end of the line for the venerable Mustang in United States military service. When sent to the ANG, the F-94As were sent to Lockheed for modification to F-94B standards and then returned to the ANG as B models. Also in the late 1950s, F-94Cs were passed along to the Air National Guard, supplementing the F-94A/B models. Eventually 22 ANG Fighter-Interceptor squadrons were equipped with the Starfire interceptor. The last F-94C was retired by the active-duty Air Force in November 1957 when the 319th Fighter-Interceptor Squadron at Bunker Hill Air Force Base, Indiana converted to the F-89J Scorpion interceptor. The last F-94C Starfires were phased out of ANG service by the 179th Fighter- Interceptor Squadron at the Duluth Municipal Airport, Minnesota during the summer of 1959 when it converted to the F-89J Scorpion; the last aircraft being sent to AMARC in December 1959.

Timbaland's first full credit production work was in 1996 on Ginuwine...the Bachelor for R&B; singer Ginuwine. After further work on Aaliyah's second studio album One in a Million (1996) and Missy Elliott's debut studio album Supa Dupa Fly (1997), Timbaland became a prominent producer for R&B; and hip hop artists. As a rapper he initially released several albums with fellow rapper Magoo, followed by his debut solo album Tim's Bio in 1998. In 2002, Timbaland produced the hit single \\"Cry Me a River\\" for Justin Timberlake, going on to produce most of Timberlake's subsequent LPs such as FutureSex/LoveSounds and The 20/20 Experience and their respective hit singles. A Timbaland-owned imprint label, Mosley Music Group, featured artists such as Nelly Furtado, whose Timbaland- produced album Loose (2006) was a commercial and critical success. In 2007, Timbaland released a solo album, Shock Value, which was followed by Shock Value II in 2009. Later in his career he was responsible, along with Swizz Beatz, for creating the popular webcast series Verzuz in 2020. Aside from the aforementioned artists, Timbaland's production credits from the 2000s forward include work with Jay-Z, Nas, Ludacris, Bubba Sparxxx, Madonna, Rihanna, OneRepublic, Brandy, Drake, Rick Ross and others. As a songwriter, he has written 85 UK hits and 99 hits Stateside, as of 2014. Timbaland has received widespread acclaim for his production style. In 2007, Entertainment Weekly stated that \\"just about every current pop trend can be traced back to him ‚Äî from sultry, urban-edged R&B; songstresses ... to the art of incorporating avant-garde sounds into No. 1 hits.\\" Early life Timothy Zachary Mosley was born on March 10, 1972 in Norfolk, Virginia, to Latrice, who ran a homeless shelter, and Garland Mosley, an Amtrak employee. He graduated from Salem High School of Virginia Beach, Virginia. During his time as a DJ, he was known as \\"DJ Tim\\" or \\"DJ Timmy Tim\\". His brother, Sebastian, is reportedly around nine years younger.\\"Timbaland's little brother, Sebastian, has his own hit\\".HamptonRoads.com. (\\"Timbaland is 38; Sebastian declines to give his age but is likely around 29.\\") His sister Courtney Rashon is a makeup artist and an author from New Jersey. While attending high school, Timbaland began a long-term collaboration with rapper Melvin (Magoo) Barcliff. The teenage Mosley also joined the production ensemble S.B.I. (which stood for 'Surrounded By Idiots') which also featured Neptunes producer Pharrell Williams. Mosley was also high school friends with brothers Terrence and Gene Thornton, who would become known as Pusha T and Malice of the rap group Clipse, respectively. In 1986, when Timbaland was 14 years old, he was accidentally shot by a co-worker at a local Red Lobster restaurant and was partially paralyzed for nine months.\\"A History of Rappers Getting Shot and Surviving\\" January 28, 2013 During this time, he began to learn how to DJ using his left hand. Singer and rapper Missy Elliott heard his material and began working with him. She and her R&B; group, Sista, auditioned for DeVante Swing, a producer and member of the successful R&B; act Jodeci. DeVante signed Sista to his Swing Mob record label and Elliott brought Mosley and Barcliff along with her to New York, where Swing Mob was based. It was DeVante who renamed the young producer Timbaland, after the Timberland brand of construction boots. He and Magoo became part of SCI Zakys School stable of Swing Mob signees known as \\"Da Bassment\\" crew, joining artists such as R&B; singer Ginuwine, male vocal group Playa (Smoke E. Digglera, Static Major and Digital Black), and the girl group Sugah. Timbaland did production work on a number of projects with DeVante, including the 1995 Jodeci LP The Show, The After-Party, The Hotel, and Sista's (unreleased) d√©but LP 4 All the Sistas Around da World. Elliott began receiving recognition as a songwriter for artists such as R&B; girl group 702 and MC Lyte. Due to Timbaland's connection with her, he was often contacted to produce remixes of her songs. Career =1994‚Äì2002: Focus on production work and Tim's Bio: Life from da Bassment= Timbaland began his producing career for R&B; acts. In the early-1990s, he produced a few songs for R&B; acts such as Jodeci and Sista. In 1996, he made his mainstream breakthrough by producing the majority of both Aaliyah's second album One in a Million and Ginuwine's debut album Ginuwine...the Bachelor. This included the major hit singles \\"If Your Girl Only Knew\\" by Aaliyah and \\"Pony\\" by Ginuwine. While Timbaland was initially producing for R&B; artists, his trademark sound was very much rooted in hip-hop with its fast-paced nature and clear drum breaks. He was taking a hip-hop sound and applying it to R&B;, and in this way his sound was instrumental in blurring the distinction between hip-hop and R&B; production. In 1997, he fully produced Supa Dupa Fly, the debut album of Missy Elliott, who had been a childhood friend of Mosley. In this album Timbaland continued with his now trademark electronic production style, but since Missy frequently rapped the music was considered hip-hop. Also in 1997, he released his first album with his partner Magoo, Welcome to Our World, also a hip-hop album. In the late 1990s, his hip-hop production sound would become very influential and common as he produced for many high-profile hip-hop artists including Jay-Z, Nas, and The LOX. In 1999, he scored a major hit with Jay Z and rap group UGK with the hit \\"Big Pimpin'\\". He also fully produced Missy's second album in 1999, Da Real World. Still Timbaland in this period produced primarily for R&B; artists. He continued to produce for Ginuwine and Aaliyah, as well as contributing significantly to albums by Xscape, Nicole, Playa, and Total. He remixed Usher's major hit \\"You Make Me Wanna\\". In the early 2000s Timbaland produced songs including Ludacris' \\"Roll Out (My Business)\\", Jay-Z's \\"Hola' Hovito\\", Petey Pablo's \\"Raise Up\\", and Beck's cover of David Bowie's \\"Diamond Dogs\\" during this period. He also contributed three songs, all eventually released as singles, to Aaliyah‚Äôs self-titled third album, the exotic lead single \\"We Need a Resolution\\" (featuring himself rapping a verse), \\"More than a Woman\\", and the ballad \\"I Care 4 U\\". He also makes an appearance in Aaliyah's single \\"Try Again\\", which he also produced and co-wrote. Timbaland & Magoo‚Äôs second album together was slated for release in November 2000. Indecent Proposal was to feature appearances by Beck, Aaliyah, as well as new Timbaland prot√©g√©s‚Äîsome from his new Beat Club Records imprint--Ms. Jade, Kiley Dean, Sebastian (Timbaland's brother), Petey Pablo, and Tweet (who was a member of Sugah during the Swing Mob days). The album was delayed for an entire year, finally released in November 2001. It was a commercial disappointment. Beck‚Äôs vocals for the track \\"I Am Music\\" were not included on the last version, which instead featured Timbaland singing along Steve \\"Static\\" Garrett of Playa and Aaliyah. The first release on Beat Club was the d√©but album by Bubba Sparxxx in September 2001, Dark Days, Bright Nights. The loss of Aaliyah deeply affected Timbaland. In a phone call to the MTV show Total Request Live, Timbaland said: =2003‚Äì2005: Production work for pop recording artists= Timbaland contributed three tracks to Tweet's debut album, Southern Hummingbird, and produced most of Missy Elliott's fourth and fifth LPs, Under Construction and This Is Not A Test!. He also produced tracks for artists such as Lil' Kim (\\"The Jump Off\\") and southern rapper Pastor Troy during this period. Collaborating with fellow producer Scott Storch, Timbaland also worked on a number of tracks on former *NSYNC lead singer Justin Timberlake‚Äôs solo debut, Justified, including the song \\"Cry Me a River\\". Late in 2003, Timbaland delivered the second Bubba Sparxxx album, Deliverance, and the third Timbaland & Magoo album, Under Construction, Part II Both albums were released to little fanfare or acclaim even though Deliverance was praised by reviews and embraced by the internet community. In 2004 Timbaland produced singles for LL Cool J, Xzibit, Fatman Scoop, and Jay Z, and he produced the bulk of Brandy‚Äôs fourth album, Afrodisiac. Timbaland co-wrote two tracks (Exodus '04 and Let Me Give You My Love) and produced three tracks of the American-Japanese Pop star Hikaru Utada‚Äôs second English album, Exodus. He continued working on tracks for Tweet and for Elliott‚Äôs sixth album, The Cookbook: \\"Joy (feat. Mike Jones)\\", and \\"Partytime\\" and continued to expand his reach with production for The Game and Jennifer Lopez (\\"He'll Be Back\\" from her fourth studio album, Rebirth). =2006‚Äì2007: Loose, Future/Sounds and Shock Value= Timbaland started a new label, Mosley Music Group along with old friend and legendary Australian music producer John Servedio, also known as his stage name 'ServidSounds' who helped Timbaland bring in some talent from his former Beat Club Records label. On the new label were Nelly Furtado, Keri Hilson, and rapper D.O.E. In 2006 he produced Justin Timberlake's second solo studio album FutureSex/LoveSounds. His vocals feature on the songs \\"SexyBack\\", \\"Sexy Ladies\\", \\"Chop Me Up\\", \\"What Goes Around... Comes Around\\" and on the prelude to \\"My Love\\" entitled \\"Let Me Talk to You.\\" Timbaland provided vocals on several singles: The Pussycat Dolls's \\"Wait a Minute\\", Nelly Furtado's \\"Promiscuous\\", \\"Ice Box\\" by Omarion and Justin Timberlake's \\"SexyBack\\". In an interview published in August 2006 in the UK Timbaland revealed he was working on a new LP by Jay Z and that he had worked on tracks with Coldplay‚Äôs Chris Martin. Timbaland worked on seven songs for Bj√∂rk‚Äôs 2007 album, Volta, including \\"Earth Intruders\\", \\"Hope\\", and \\"Innocence\\" and he later worked on tracks for the new Duran Duran album, Red Carpet Massacre, including one featuring his frequent collaborator Justin Timberlake. Later in the year, Timbaland produced songs for Bone Thugs-n-Harmony's LP, Strength & Loyalty and the song \\"Ayo Technology\\" on 50 Cent‚Äôs album Curtis. Timbaland also produced most of the tracks on Ashlee Simpson's third CD, Bittersweet World, including the song \\"Outta My Head (Ay Ya Ya)\\". On April 3, 2007, Timbaland released a collaboration album featuring artists including 50 Cent, Dr. Dre, Elton John, Fall Out Boy, Nelly Furtado, Missy Elliott, and others called Timbaland Presents Shock Value. A rivalry flared up between Timbaland and record producer Scott Storch in early 2007. The tension initially started on the single \\"Give It to Me\\", when Timbaland anonymously backlashed Storch: \\"I'm a real producer and you['re] just the piano man\\". In an interview, Timbaland confirmed that he was talking about Storch. The dispute partly stemmed from controversy regarding writing credits for Timberlake's \\"Cry Me a River\\". =2008: Focus on other projects= Timbaland helped produce many albums for various artists in 2008, including Madonna's Hard Candy, Ashlee Simpson's Bittersweet World, Keri Hilson's In A Perfect World, Flo Rida's Mail On Sunday, Letoya Luckett's Lady Love, Lindsay Lohan's Spirit in the Dark, Chris Cornell's Scream, JoJo's All I Want Is Everything, Nicole Scherzinger's Her Name is Nicole, Missy Elliott's Block Party, Matt Pokora's MP3, Keithian's Dirrty Pop, The Pussycat Dolls's Doll Domination, Busta Rhymes's B.O.M.B, Lisa Maffia's Miss Boss, Teairra Mari's Pressed For Time, Jennifer Hudson's d√©but album, Dima Bilan's Believe, Samantha Jade's My Name Is Samantha Jade, New Kids on the Block's The Block, and Keshia Chant√©'s Night & Day. Timbaland produced the Russian entry for the Eurovision Song Contest 2008, Believe by Dima Bilan, which was co-written by Bilan and Jim Beanz. The song then won the contest when it was held in Belgrade, Serbia in May 2008. In February 2008 the first 'Fashion against AIDS' collection -an initiative of 'Designers against AIDS' and sold in H&M; stores in 28 countries- was launched, for which Timbaland designed a T-shirt print, posed for the campaign and spoke out in a video, to help raise HIV/AIDS awareness among urban youth and to advocate safe sex. On February 8, 2008, it was announced that Timbaland would be releasing an album exclusively for Verizon Wireless's V CAST cell phone service and was designated its very first \\"Mobile Producer in Residence.\\" Timbaland was to be joined by Mosley Music Group/Zone 4 singer and songwriter Keri Hilson to begin work on the mobile album's first track aboard the fully equipped Mobile Recording Studio. The only track to surface so far is Garry Barry Larry Harry \\"Get It Girl\\". In Timbaland's first effort within the video game industry, he worked with Rockstar Games to produce Beaterator, a music mixing game for the PlayStation Portable, PlayStation Network, and iOS released in the September 2009. =2009‚Äì2010: Shock Value II and burglary case= Timbaland spoke to MTV's Shaheem Reid back in July 2008 to confirm that he was working on the follow-up to his platinum selling Shock Value. At the time he confirmed that he had one track with Madonna which although recorded for her album Hard Candy it had not been used and could end up on this album instead. He was insistent that he would also collaborate with Jordin Sparks, Beyonc√©, Rihanna, Jonas Brothers, Miley Cyrus and T.I. However, none of these collaborations (except Miley Cyrus) made it to the final track list. He also said that alongside T-Pain who would definitely appear, he hoped to get Jay-Z on board, although he ultimately failed to do so. Timbaland began working on the sequel to Shock Value in July 2008. In March 2009, he filed a lawsuit against his label, Blackground Records, alleging that they attempted to blackball him after he decided to move from music performance into production. In September 2009, Timbaland announced that Shock Value II will be released on November 23, in Europe and November 24, in North America. However, it was pushed back to December 8, preceded by the first single which features a new recording artist named SoShy entitled \\"Morning After Dark\\". New featured guest appearances on the album include DJ Felli Fel, Justin Timberlake, JoJo, Bran'Nu, Drake, Chad Kroeger, Sebastian, Miley Cyrus, Melody Thornton, Nelly Furtado, Katy Perry, Esthero, The Fray, Jet, Daughtry, OneRepublic, Keri Hilson, Attitude and D.O.E.. Ultimately Madonna, Jonas Brothers, Rihanna, Usher, Jay Z, Beyonc√©, Kanye West, Linkin Park, The All-American Rejects, Paramore, Gucci Mane, T-Pain, T.I. and Akon never appeared on Shock Value II. Shock Value II is infamous for its use of over-the-top vocal effects. Despite charting low, Timbaland has had three top forty singles to date. \\"Morning After Dark\\" featuring SoShy and Nelly Furtado is the lead single from Timbaland's third studio album. The song was written by Tim Mosley, Jerome Harmon, Deborah Epstein, Michelle Bell, Keri Hilson, Nelly Furtado, James Washington, John Maultsby and produced by Timbaland and Jroc. The single premiered on October 16, 2009, on Ryan Seacrest's KIIS-FM radio show, On-Air with Ryan Seacrest with Timbaland describing it as the kick-off song from the project. Following her performance, the song was sent for radio adds on May 25. The song peaked in the top 10 of the Billboard Hot 100. With this success, the song became Sparks' fifth consecutive top 20 hit and third nonconsecutive top 10 hit. On May 24, Sparks headed to Europe to begin promotion for the single.\\"Say Something\\" featuring Canadian rapper Drake was released to US iTunes on November 3, 2009. It was officially sent to U.S. radio on January 5, 2010. It is the album's second single and reached number 23 on the Hot 100, making it the second most successful single on the album. \\"Carry Out\\" featuring Justin Timberlake is the third single from the album but was initially only released in the U.S. It was sent to US radio on December 1, 2009. It is the most successful single on the album, peaking at number 11 on the 'Billboard Hot 100. The music video premiered on February 18, 2010. It was released as the third UK single on April 26, 2010. \\"If We Ever Meet Again\\" featuring Katy Perry is the album's fourth single. The music video premiered on January 18, 2010. In the UK, it was released February 15, 2010. Timbaland produced Chris Cornell's 2009 album Scream. Shakira was asked to record vocals on the song \\"Give It Up to Me\\" to be included on Timbaland's forthcoming album but it was placed on her third studio album She Wolf and released as the second US single instead. One of the songs Timbaland had produced for Beyonc√©'s 2008 album I Am... Sasha Fierce was reworked by Keri Hilson and Jay Z for Shock Value II but not included. He was a guest host of WWE's Raw on December 28, 2009. Timbaland appeared on March 25, 2010 episode (titled \\"Blowback\\") of FlashForward as an evidence agent. His songs \\"Morning After Dark\\" and \\"Symphony\\" appear on the video game Def Jam: Underground. In April 2010, a feud arose between the producer and R&B; singer Ginuwine, after Timbaland failed to make an appearance at the singer's music video shoot of \\"Get Involved\\". Later in April, Timbaland released a new single featuring T-Pain and Billy Blue titled \\"Talk That\\". In June 2010, when questioned by RWD magazine about the UK music scene he made the bold claim to be the inspiration for the dub-step music scene. \\"The UK scene... they‚Äôre always telling me that I started it. You have Dub-bass...\\". When questioned further about it he went on to say: \\"It‚Äôs funny cos they went back to some of my old music that really created that sound and just, instead of going fast, they went slow with more bass.\\" In August 2010, a \\"possible suicide attempt\\" APB was put out for Timbaland after his home was burgled. When his family were unable to contact him, they called 911 and a manhunt began. Police eventually found his car and brought him back home, where paramedics examined him, before declaring he was not a threat to himself. When questioned, Timbaland said he only took a drive to think about the burglary, as he thought the possible thief could have been someone close whom he trusted. =2010‚Äì2020: Textbook Timbo and other activities= In 2010, Timbaland split with longtime label Blackground Records, but stayed with Interscope Records. Later in the year, Timbaland was featured on the deluxe edition of Chris Brown's album, F.A.M.E., producing the songs \\"Paper, Scissors, Rock\\" (feat. Big Sean) and the Japan-only bonus track, \\"Talk Ya Ear Off\\". Timbaland was also featured on David Guetta's LP, Nothing But the Beat, on \\"I Just Wanna F.\\" with Dev and Afrojack.

In November 2010, Timbaland announced that he would be releasing a new song every Thursday, called Timbo Thursdays; a copy of the initiative shown by artists such as Kanye West (via G.O.O.D. Fridays), and Swizz Beatz (via Monster Mondays). In an interview with Rap-Up.com Timbaland stated, \\"So, my brother told me Kanye is puttin' out a new song every Friday called G.O.O.D. Fridays, Swizz got Mondays, I don't know if they are on Twitter but can you hit them up, and tell them reserve that Thursday for Timbo the king baby. We‚Äôll call it Timbo Thursday, cool?\\" On January 13, 2011, Timbaland began his Timbaland Thursdays free music initiative, with the first song released being \\"Take Ur Clothes Off\\", featuring Missy Elliott. In early 2011, he stopped the weekly free music as he spent time in South Africa, and wanted to help produce tracks for his brother, Sebastian. The first official single from Shock Value III, \\"Pass at Me\\" featuring American rapper Pitbull, with uncredited production by French DJ David Guetta, was released on September 13, 2011, after having been previously used to promote a book titled Culo. The album's second single, \\"Break Ya Back\\" featuring American singer Dev, was released on April 17, 2012. For the fourth installment in the Step Up franchise, Step Up Revolution, Timbaland released a track called \\"Hands In the Air\\", which features American singer Ne-Yo. On January 30, 2013, Timbaland signed to Jay-Z's label Roc Nation. Later that year, Timbaland would serve as the main producer of Justin Timberlake's recent LP, The 20/20 Experience, including the album's singles: \\"Suit & Tie\\" and \\"Mirrors\\". Timbaland also produced Beyonc√©'s song \\"Grown Woman\\" which was featured in her Pepsi commercial and 2013 tour, The Mrs. Carter Show World Tour, and the song \\"I Don't Have To Sleep to Dream\\" on Cher's 2013 album Closer to the Truth.

In August 2013, Timbaland revealed that he was working on a project featuring unreleased material by Michael Jackson, with a lead single called \\"Love Never Felt So Good\\". On September 24, 2013, Timbaland collaborated with T.I. for his new co-produced Indonesian artist, AGNEZ MO, in her song titled Coke Bottle. The premiere launch event of the single became a worldwide trending topic on Twitter. On November 15, 2013, Timbaland released his first single for his fourth album, Opera Noir, called \\"Know Bout Me\\" featuring Drake, Jay-Z, and James Fauntleroy. By 2014, it was originally announced that both Timbaland and Missy Elliott would be an essential component per production of Kat Dahlia's debut album, My Garden, however neither of the duo's contributions saw the light of day. On January 7, 2015, Timbaland received production credit for his involvement with the musical score of Lee Daniels and Danny Strong's television project Empire, which premiered on FOX. Constructively, Timbaland and his team, including Jim Beanz, Raphael Saadiq, and others, compose the series' songs based on material given to them by the show's writing team per each episode. In February 2016, Timbaland and Missy Elliott teamed up to produce the track \\"Somebody Else Will\\" for longtime associate, Tweet, for her third studio album Charlene. In June 2016, Timbaland and Andy Rubinhas teamed up with SubPac, a Los Angeles-based startup working on a wearable sound device. There is still no release date for his new album Textbook Timbo. On December 15, 2017, Timbaland released the song \\"Grab the Wheel\\", which features 6lack on vocals. The song also has a music video which was released on the same day. In 2019, Timbaland began teaching through Masterclass, providing an instructional series on production and beatmaking. = 2020-present: Verzuz = In March 2020, Timbaland, along with Swizz Beatz, launched the highly popular Verzuz Instagram webcast series. Legacy and influence An important figure in the creation of American R&B;'s \\"stuttering kick-drums template,\\" Timbaland's influence extended beyond the U.S. and crossed international waters, especially in UK garage and rave culture. Timbaland, as an R&B; producer, created a distinctive, rhythmic sound using breakbeats, which break up the smooth flow of tracks to create moments of tension and release. This technique that Timbaland pioneered would later serve to create \\"bootleg\\" garage tracks, which was essential in the rise of UK garage. What began as an underground movement soon grew in popularity, with bootleg remixes selling upwards of 20,000 copies, something unheard of at the time. One such example is the remix of Brandy & Monica's \\"The Boy Is Mine\\". Plagiarism accusations In January 2007, Timbaland was alleged to have plagiarized several elements (both motifs and samples) in the song \\"Do It\\" on the 2006 album Loose by Nelly Furtado without giving credit or compensation.Onko Nellyn hitti Suomesta? (Finnish)Yhdysvaltalaistuottaja p√∂lli suomalaismuusikolta (Finnish) The song itself was released as the fifth North American single from Loose in July 2007. Timbaland's legal troubles continued. In lieu of a copyright lawsuit over the song \\"Throw It on Me\\" from his Shock Value album, Timbaland and David Cortopassi, the composer of \\"Spazz\\", a song originally recorded by The Elastik Band and released by ATCO/Atlantic and EMI, reached a settlement agreement in July 2009. The terms of the settlement remained undisclosed at the time. \\"Spazz\\", noted as being \\"one of the most tasteless records ever made\\", was initially banned by radio stations and even pulled mid-stream while on air when first released in 1967, with the DJ even apologizing to his listeners for playing the record. In January 2014, the Swiss newspaper Basler Zeitung revealed another plagiarism case concerning the track \\"Versus\\" by Jay-Z, which was produced by Timbaland. The track's instrumental is very similar to, if not directly sampled from \\"On the Way\\" by Swiss musician Bruno Spoerri. According to Swiss newspaper Tages Anzeiger, the plagiarism case was settled by March 2015. Jay-Z and Timbaland were to pay 50% from the song's revenue to Spoerri as royalties for the music, with Jay-Z retaining 50% for the lyrics.

Brackney says Dunster was \\"an important precursor\\" of the Baptist denomination in America, especially regarding infant baptism, soul freedom, religious liberty, congregational governance, and a radical biblicism.William H. Brackney, Baptists in North America: an historical perspective (2006) p. 12 Life Dunster House, constructed at Harvard in 1930 and named for Dunster He was born at Bolholt, Bury, Lancashire, England to Henry Dunster. Henry Dunster's Grave Dunster studied at Magdalene College, Cambridge as a sizar, specializing in oriental languages and earning a reputation as a Hebrew scholar. He earned a bachelor's degree (1630) and his master's degree (1634) and taught at Magdalene. He served as Headmaster of Bury Grammar School and was a curate at Saint Mary's Church in Bury. Sponsored by Rev. Richard Mather,Thompson, Roger, Cambridge Cameos, Stories of Life in Seventeenth- Century New England, Boston: NEHGS, 2005, 67. Dunster emigrated to Boston, Massachusetts in 1640. When Nathaniel Eaton was dismissed in 1639 as master of the recently established Harvard College, in Cambridge, Massachusetts, Dunster was appointed as his successor. Thus on August 27, 1640 Dunster became the first president of Harvard. (For a discussion of Dunster's choice of the title \\"president\\" see President ¬ß Description.) He modeled Harvard's educational system on that of the English schools such as Eton College and Cambridge University. He set up as well as taught Harvard's entire curriculum alone for many years, graduating the first college class in America, the Class of 1642. From 1649-1650 Dunster also served as interim pastor at The First Parish in Cambridge until the accession of Jonathan Mitchel.http://www.henrydunster.org/Pastor.html (accessed February 1, 2010) Historians have generally treated Dunster well in terms of his theological beliefs and educational abilities. Samuel Eliot Morison, the best-known historian of Harvard's history, wrote that Harvard College \\"might have followed her first patron to an early death and oblivion but for the faith, courage and intelligence of Henry Dunster.\\"Morison, S.E., Harvard in the Seventeenth Century, Vol. I, p. 319. Dunster held Harvard together financially during a difficult economic downturn in New England that began soon after his arrival. He later had some conflict with the college's treasurer, Thomas Danforth, who called him the \\"de facto treasurer.\\".Thompson, Roger, Cambridge Cameos, Stories of Life in Seventeenth-Century New England, Boston: NEHGS, 2005, 67‚Äì73. However, Dunster indeed was the \\"de facto treasurer\\" of Harvard for nearly a decade. With the approval of the General Court of Massachusetts Bay, he later set up the first corporation charter in America, the Charter of 1650, and named Danforth as the new treasurer.Melnick, Arseny James, \\"America's Oldest Corporation and First CEO: Harvard and Henry Dunster,\\" West Conshohocken, PA: Infinity, 2008, 120‚Äì121. The corporate charter that Dunster established governs Harvard University to this day‚Äîan astounding testament to his leadership and governing skills. On December 6, 2010, Harvard announced its intention to expand the membership of the Corporation from a body of seven members (as first set up by Dunster) to thirteen members.Harvard Corporation Governance Review Committee, Report to the University Community, Harvard University, December 6, 2010 When Dunster abandoned the Puritan view of infant baptism in favor of believer's baptism in 1653/54, he provoked a controversy that highlighted two distinct approaches to dealing with dissent in the Massachusetts Bay Colony. The colony's Puritan leaders, whose own religion was born of dissent from mainstream Church of England, generally worked for reconciliation with members who questioned matters of Puritan theology but responded much more harshly to outright rejection of Puritanism. Dunster's conflict with the colony's magistrates began when he failed to have his infant son baptized, believing that only adults should be baptized. Earnest efforts to restore Dunster to Puritan orthodoxy failed, and his heterodoxy proved untenable to colony leaders who had entrusted him, in his job as Harvard's president, to uphold the colony's religious mission. Thus, he represented a threat to the stability of society. Dunster exiled himself in 1654/55 and moved to nearby Plymouth Colony to become the minister of the First Church in Scituate, Massachusetts. Dunster died on February 27, 1659 (or 1658 ‚Äì Old Style calendar).Timothy L. Wood, \\"'I Spake the Truth in the Feare of God': the Puritan Management of Dissent During the Henry Dunster Controversy,\\" Historical Journal of Massachusetts 2005 33(1): 1-19, Family and legacy Dunster married twice; both his wives were named Elizabeth. His first wife was Elizabeth (Harris) Glover, the widow of Joseph Glover. They married on June 21, 1641. She died in 1643, leaving Dunster with land and property, including the first printing press in the colony, and leaving him shared responsibility for her estate and her five children by her first marriage. Dunster married Elizabeth Atkinson (1627‚Äì1690) in 1644. Together they had five children. Dunster House, one of the twelve residential houses of Harvard University, is named after Henry Dunster.

A third round draft pick of the Kansas City Royals in 1981 MLB Draft, he made his MLB debut in 1986 and continued playing until 2003, pitching for five different teams. Cone batted left-handed and threw right-handed. Cone pitched the sixteenth perfect game in baseball history in 1999. On the final game of the 1991 regular season, he struck out 19 batters, tied for second-most ever in a game. The 1994 Cy Young Award winner, he was a five-time All-Star and led the major leagues in strikeouts each season from 1990‚Äì92. A two-time 20 game- winner, he set the MLB record for most years between 20-win seasons with 10. He was a member of five World Series championship teams ‚Äì with the Toronto Blue Jays and , , and with the New York Yankees. His 8‚Äì3 career postseason record came over 21 games and 111 innings pitched, with an earned run average (ERA) of 3.80; in World Series play, his ERA was 2.12. Cone is the subject of the book, A Pitcher's Story: Innings With David Cone, by Roger Angell. Cone and Jack Curry co-wrote the autobiography Full Count: The Education of a Pitcher, which was released in May 2019 and made the New York Times Best Seller list shortly after its release. Early years Cone was born in Kansas City, Missouri, the son of Joan (n√©e Curran; 1936-2016) and Edwin Cone (b. 1934). He attended Rockhurst High School, a Jesuit school, where he played quarterback on the football team, leading them to the district championship. He was also a point guard on the basketball team. Because Rockhurst did not have a baseball team, Cone instead played summer ball in the Ban Johnson League, a college summer league in Kansas City. At 16, he reported to an invitation-only tryout at Royals Stadium and an open tryout for the St. Louis Cardinals. He was also recruited to play college football and baseball. Upon graduation, he enrolled at the University of Missouri and was drafted by his hometown Kansas City Royals in the third round of the 1981 Major League Baseball draft. Professional baseball career =Minor leagues and MLB debut: Kansas City Royals (1981‚Äì1986)= Cone went 22‚Äì7 with a 2.21 earned run average in his first two professional seasons. He sat out 1983 with an injury, and went 8‚Äì12 with a 4.28 ERA for the Double-A Memphis Chicks when he returned in 1984. During his second season with the Class AAA Omaha Royals (1986), Cone was converted to a relief pitcher, and he made his Major League debut on June 8, 1986 in relief of reigning Cy Young Award winner Bret Saberhagen. He made three more appearances out of the Royals' bullpen before returning to Omaha, where he went 8‚Äì4 with a 2.79 ERA. He returned to Kansas City when rosters expanded that September. =New York Mets (1987‚Äì1992)= Prior to the 1987 season, Cone was traded with Chris Jelic to the New York Mets for Ed Hearn, Rick Anderson and Mauro Gozzo. Cone went 5‚Äì6 with a 3.71 ERA and 68 strikeouts in 21 appearances (13 starts) his first season in New York City. Cone began the 1988 season in the bullpen, but was added to the starting rotation by the first week of May. His first start was a complete game shutout over the Atlanta Braves, as he went 9‚Äì2 with a 2.52 ERA in the first half of the season to earn his first All-Star nod. For the season, Cone went 20‚Äì3 with a 2.22 ERA to finish third in National League Cy Young Award balloting. The Mets ran away with the National League East by fifteen games over the Pittsburgh Pirates, and were heavy favorites over the Los Angeles Dodgers, against whom they had a 10‚Äì1 record during the regular season, in the 1988 National League Championship Series. Cone became a newspaper commentator on the playoffs for the New York Daily News, and incited controversy after the Mets' 3‚Äì2 victory in game one by saying Dodgers game one starter Orel Hershiser \\"was lucky for eight innings\\", and ripping closer Jay Howell: After Cone provided the Dodgers with bulletin board material, Los Angeles jumped on Cone for five runs in two innings in the second game of the playoffs to tie the series at a game apiece. The Mets persuaded Cone to stop writing the column, and he came back with a scoreless ninth inning in a game three Met win and a complete game victory in game six; however, series MVP and 1988 Cy Young Award winner Orel Hershiser came back in game seven with the complete game shut out to lead the Dodgers to the 1988 World Series against the Oakland Athletics. In a well-known incident on April 30, 1990, against the Atlanta Braves, Cone covered first base on a throw from second baseman Gregg Jefferies, which should have retired batter Mark Lemke. Umpire Charlie Williams mistakenly ruled Lemke safe. Arguing with Williams, and thinking time had been called, Cone held the ball while two Braves' runners(Dale Murphy and Ernie Whitt) scored.https://sabr.org/bioproj/person/191828e7 Cone spent over five seasons in his first stint with the New York Mets, most of the time serving as the team's co-ace alongside Dwight Gooden while leading the National League in strikeouts in 1990 and 1991. In 1991, Cone switched from uniform number 44 to 17 in honor of former teammate Keith Hernandez. On August 30, he struck out three batters on nine pitches in the fifth inning of a 3‚Äì2 win over the Cincinnati Reds. He became the 16th National League pitcher and the 25th pitcher in Major League history to accomplish the feat. Cone's jersey from his 19 strikeout game on October 6, housed in the Mets Hall of Fame and Museum at Citi Field Cone tied a National League record on October 6, in the season finale, by striking out 19 rival Philadelphia Phillies batters in a 7‚Äì0, three-hit shutout at Philadelphia. His 19 strikeouts was the second-highest total ever recorded in a nine inning game just behind the 20-strikeout games recorded by Kerry Wood, Roger Clemens (twice), Randy Johnson and Max Scherzer, and tying Tom Seaver's single-game club record, making the Mets the only team with two pitchers to achieve the feat. Cone was the lone Mets representative at the 1992 Major League Baseball All-Star Game, going 9‚Äì4 with a 2.56 ERA at the All-Star break. With a 56‚Äì67 record, and fourteen games behind the first place Pirates, the infamous \\"worst team money could buy\\" traded Cone to the Toronto Blue Jays for Jeff Kent and Ryan Thompson on August 27, 1992, after the non-waiver trading deadline. =Toronto Blue Jays (1992)= With Toronto, Cone was 4‚Äì3 with a 2.55 ERA and 47 strikeouts. Combined with the 214 strikeouts he had with the Mets, his 261 strikeouts led the major leagues and were a career high. Cone headed to the post-season for the second time in his career as the Blue Jays won the American League East. The Jays defeated the Oakland Athletics in the 1992 American League Championship Series, and the Atlanta Braves in the World Series, to give Cone his first World Series ring, and become the first Canadian team to win the World Series. For his part, Cone went 1‚Äì1 with a 3.22 ERA in the post-season. =Cy Young Award: Kansas City Royals (1993‚Äì1994)= Cone returned to his hometown Kansas City Royals as a free agent for the 1993 season. Despite an 11‚Äì14 record, Cone had an impressive 1993, pitching 254 innings with a 3.33 ERA, or 138 ERA+. He improved to go 16‚Äì5 with a 2.94 ERA (171 ERA+) in the strike-shortened 1994 season to win the American League Cy Young Award, and finish ninth in MVP voting. Cone was a Major League Baseball Players Association representative in negotiations with Major League Baseball in events that surrounded the 1994 baseball strike. =Toronto Blue Jays, second stint (1995)= Four days after the strike ended, the Royals traded Cone back to the Blue Jays for Chris Stynes, David Sinnes and Tony Medrano. Cone was 9‚Äì6 with a 3.38 ERA for Toronto, however, the Jays were 35‚Äì47 and in fifth place when they struck a deal with the second place New York Yankees. On July 28, 1995, the Blue Jays sent Cone to the Yankees for Marty Janzen, Jason Jarvis and Mike Gordon. =New York Yankees (1995‚Äì2000)= When the Yankees acquired Cone, they were on a six-game winning streak, though still trailing the Boston Red Sox for the division lead.The David Cone Years, Riveraveblues.com; accessed February 14, 2015. Cone instantly became the team's ace and would post a 9-2 record as the Yankees won the wild card in the first season of the new three division, wild card format. In his third post-season, Cone won the first game of the 1995 American League Division Series against the Seattle Mariners, and left game five with the score tied at four. The Mariners won the game in extra innings to eliminate the Yankees from the playoffs. The Yankees re-signed Cone in the offseason to a three-year contract worth $19.5 million. Cone was 4‚Äì1 with a 2.02 ERA when he was diagnosed with an aneurysm in his arm in 1996 and went on the disabled list for the majority of the year. In his comeback start that September against the Oakland Athletics, Cone pitched a no-hitter through seven innings before he had to leave due to pitch count restrictions. Mariano Rivera allowed a single, ending the no-hit bid. The Yankees returned to the post-season for the second of thirteen consecutive seasons. After losing to the Texas Rangers in game one of the 1996 American League Division Series, and a no decision in the 1996 American League Championship Series, Cone came back in game three of the World Series against the Atlanta Braves with a six inning, one run performance to give the Yankees their first win of the Series on their way to their first World Championship in eighteen years. Cone went 20‚Äì7 in 1998, setting a Major League record for the longest span between twenty win seasons. Cone won the 1998 American League Division Series clinching game against the Rangers, the 1998 American League Championship Series clinching game against the Indians, and Game Three of the 1998 World Series against the San Diego Padres. Cone finished fourth in the AL Cy Young voting. Cone pitching on July 29, 1999 He re-signed with the Yankees for the 1999 season for $8 million. He went 12‚Äì9 in 1999, pitching the sixteenth perfect game in baseball history on July 18 against the Montreal Expos. It is the last no-hitter to date by a Yankee, and also the first (and so far, only) regular season interleague perfect game. Making the game even more remarkable was that it was \\"Yogi Berra Day\\" at Yankee Stadium. After a long feud with owner George Steinbrenner, Berra agreed to return to the stadium that day. Yogi caught the ceremonial first pitch from Don Larsen, who threw a perfect game for the Yankees in the 1956 World Series; that game had been caught by Yogi Berra. Larsen could be seen smiling in the press box after the final out of Cone's perfect game was recorded.\\"Most Recent No-Hitters, By Team\\", Sports Illustrated, June 11, 2003.Baseball Video Highlights & Clips: 7/18/99: David Cone's Perfect Game ‚Äì Video, MLB.com; accessed February 12, 2015. After the game, Cone was met at his clubhouse locker by Larsen and Berra, who together wrapped him in a bear hug.https://nymag.com/nymetro/news/sports/features/2138/ After the perfect game, he seemed to suddenly lose effectiveness. It was the last shutout he would throw in his career. In 2000, he posted the worst record of his career, 4‚Äì14, while seeing his ERA balloon to 6.91, more than double his mark the previous year. In spite of his ineffectiveness, Cone was brought in during game four of the 2000 World Series to face the Mets' Mike Piazza, a controversial decision at the time ‚Äî Denny Neagle had given up a home run to Piazza in his previous at-bat, but was pitching with a lead and only needed to retire Piazza to go the minimum five innings to be eligible for a win. Cone induced a pop-up to end the inning. It was the only batter he faced in the entire Series. =Boston Red Sox (2001)= Cone recognized after the 2000 season that his tenure with the Yankees was over. In 2001 Cone pitched for the rival Boston Red Sox, performing with mixed but mostly positive results, including a 9‚Äì7 win-loss record and a 4.31 ERA. His 2001 season included a suspenseful 1‚Äì0 loss against Yankees ace Mike Mussina wherein Cone pitched innings giving up one unearned run, keeping the game close even as Mike Mussina came within one strike of completing a perfect game, which would have made Cone the first pitcher to pitch a perfect game and be the losing pitcher in another. =Comeback with New York Mets (2003)= Cone sat out the 2002 season, but attempted a comeback with the Mets in 2003. Cone went 1‚Äì3 in 4 starts for the Mets with a 6.50 ERA. He announced his retirement soon after his last appearance for the Mets on May 28, citing a chronic hip problem. = Pitching style = Cone modeled his pitching after Luis Tiant. By emulating Tiant's pitching style, it helped him conserve his arm. The drawback is that it put much wear and tear on his hips. =Career statistics= Cone's .606 won-lost percentage ranks 95th on MLB all-time list; 7.77 hits allowed per nine innings pitched ranks 60th on MLB's all-time list; 8.28 strikeouts per nine innings pitched ranks 17th; 2,668 strikeouts ranks 21st, and 419 games started ranks 97th on the MLB all-time list. Cone: *Is the New York Yankees' all-time leader in strikeouts per 9 innings pitched (8.67). *Holds the New York Yankees' single season record for most strikeouts per 9 innings pitched (10.25 in 1997). *Is the last Yankee pitcher to strike out 200+ batters in two consecutive seasons. *Struck out 19 batters in one game, October 6, 1991 *Is the only pitcher to have a 20-win season with both the Mets (1988) and the Yankees (1998). Later activities Cone pitching at Yankee Stadium during the 2010 Old-Timers' Day Upon retiring from baseball in 2001, Cone became a color commentator on the YES Network during its inaugural season. However, his comeback attempt with the crosstown rival Mets in 2003 infuriated Yankees owner George Steinbrenner and Cone was told he would not be welcomed back. After his second retirement from baseball, Cone was offered a broadcasting position with the Mets, but declined. In 2008, Cone rejoined the YES Network as an analyst and host of Yankees on Deck. He left the YES Network during the 2009‚Äì10 offseason in order to \\"spend more time with my family\\". He was replaced by former Yankees first baseman Tino Martinez. On April 19, 2011, Cone returned to the Yankees broadcast booth in Toronto, working as analyst for a Yankees-Blue Jays series along with Ken Singleton. As an announcer, he is known for making references to sabermetric statistics, referencing some websites such as Fangraphs.com.David Cone on Advanced Stats, the End of His Playing Career, and Riding on David Wells's Motorcycle, nymag.com; accessed February 12, 2015. Cone is currently the Yankees' lead color commentator, alongside former teammate Paul O'Neill. The two are paired with Michael Kay as the Yankees' regular broadcast team. On July 17, 2009, Cone testified as a witness (representing the Democratic Party) before the Senate Judiciary Committee during the Supreme Court nomination hearings for Judge Sonia Sotomayor.Senate Judiciary Committee website; accessed February 12, 2015. Cone read a prepared statement in support of Sotomayor's nomination which chronicled Major League Baseball's labor dispute of 1994 and the impact of the judge's decision which forced the disputants back to the bargaining table. Cone said, \\"It can be a good thing to have a judge in district court or a justice on the United States Supreme Court who recognizes that the law cannot always be separated from the realities involved in the disputes being decided.\\" Personal life Cone was accused of rape in 1991, but within 72 hours the police found the claim to be without merit.https://sabr.org/bioproj/person/191828e7 In 1991, three women accused Cone of having threatened their lives at the ballpark. Cone said he had cursed them out for harassing the wife of teammate Sid Fernandez, but never threatened them. The three women later amended their lawsuit against Cone, accusing him of having lured them into the bullpen area at Shea Stadium in 1989 and masturbating in their presence. Two of the women's claims were unsuccessful. One of the women settled her claims out of court based upon Cone calling her a \\"groupie\\"; all sexual accusations were dismissed.https://sabr.org/bioproj/person/191828e7 Cone married Lynn DiGioia, an interior designer, on November 12, 1994. The couple had a son, Brian, on March 23, 2006. David and Lynn Cone divorced in 2011. Cone's partner is real estate broker and investor Taja Abitbol.https://networthpost.org/david-cone- net-worth/ They have a son, Sammy, who was born on December 15, 2011.David Cone to buy apartment at Greenwich Lane, nypost.com; accessed February 12, 2015.

Total float is associated with the path. If a project network chart/diagram has 4 non- critical paths then that project would have 4 total float values. The total float of a path is the combined free float values of all activities in a path. The total float represents the schedule flexibility and can also be measured by subtracting early start dates from late start dates of path completion. Float is core to critical path method, with the total floats of noncritical activities key to computing the critical path drag of an activity, i.e., the amount of time it is adding to the project's duration.* Example Consider the process of replacing a broken pane of glass in the window of your home. There are various component activities involved in the project as a whole; obtaining the glass and putty, installing the new glass, choosing the paint, obtaining a tin once it has set, wiping the new glass free of finger smears etc. Some of these activities can run concurrently e.g. obtaining the glass, obtaining the putty, choosing the paint etc., while others are consecutive e.g. the paint cannot be bought until it has been chosen, the new window cannot be painted until the window is installed and the new putty has set. Delaying the acquisition of the glass is likely to delay the entire project - this activity will be on the critical path and have no float, of any sort, attached to it and hence it is a 'critical activity'. A relatively short delay in the purchase of the paint may not automatically hold up the entire project as there is still some waiting time for the new putty to dry before it can be painted anyway - there will be some 'free float' attached to the activity of purchasing the paint and hence it is not a critical activity. However, a delay in choosing the paint, in turn, inevitably delays buying the paint which, although it may not subsequently mean any delay to the entire project, does mean that choosing the paint has no 'free float' attached to it - despite having no free float of its own, the choosing of the paint is involved with a path through the network which does have 'total float'.

Early life Blunt was born in Sydney and graduated from the University of Sydney with a degree in economics. After working in various positions he was hired as New South Wales State Director of the National Party. Politics At a by-election on 18 February 1984, he was elected to the House of Representatives for the Division of Richmond in northern New South Wales, despite having had no previous connections with the area. He succeeded the former Deputy Prime Minister and leader of the NPA, Doug Anthony, who had resigned his seat. Blunt was immediately promoted to the opposition front bench, serving as shadow Minister for Social Services. He was returned to parliament at the 1984 and 1987 general elections. Leader of the National Party In 1989 he organised a leadership coup against the veteran leader of the NPA, Ian Sinclair. Blunt aimed to modernise the NPA and bring it into closer alignment with the Liberal Party, particularly on issues of economic deregulation. He was also more socially liberal than most NPA members. Unfortunately for Blunt, neither of these things was popular with rank and file NPA members, and he found his leadership under increasing attack from traditionalists. At the same time the seat of Richmond, which had been held by the NPA and its predecessor the Country Party since 1922, was becoming more urbanised. Some argue that the growing unpopularity of the National Party state government in Queensland influenced federal voting intentions. Richmond sits across the Tweed River from the Gold Coast, and the two areas share a television market. However, the seat had actually become more marginal in the latter part of Doug Anthony's tenure. The anti-war campaigner Helen Caldicott announced that she would oppose Blunt in his electorate at the next election. The culmination of these trends was a swing against the NPA at the 1990 election, at which the Hawke Labor government was re-elected. Blunt was defeated in his own seat of Richmond. He went into the election holding Richmond with a majority of six percent, just barely outside the range of being safe. However, he had no local connections, which worked against him in a country seat. Labor challenger Neville Newell won the seat on the seventh count after Caldicott's preferences flowed overwhelmingly to him, allowing him to take the seat on a swing of seven percent. It was only the second time that the leader of a major Australian party had lost his own seat in an election; the first was Stanley Bruce, the then Prime Minister, who lost not only the 1929 election but also his own seat of Flinders. The NPA also lost the adjoining seat of Page, both campaigns being heavily influenced by Queensland media. After the election, Blunt was again the focus of political controversy when he was accused of inappropriately using publicly funded mailouts of election-related material: After an investigation Blunt was found not to have breached any rules, and the matter was dropped. Later life After leaving politics Blunt went into business. He led a number of trade and investment missions to the United States and was regular speaker at international trade and investment outlook conferences. In 1992 he became National Director of the American Chamber of Commerce in Australia, resigning in 2013. He is also currently chair of a number of publicly listed companies, including Capital Trade and Policy and Palamedia. In 2014, Blunt appeared in a documentary about the Nationals, A Country Road: The Nationals in which he talked about his time as Nationals leader. On the same programme, John Sharp who was a Nationals MP at the time of Blunt's leadership said that in hindsight it was a mistake for Sinclair to be replaced as leader by Blunt.A Country Road: The Nationals Episode 2 References External links *American Chamber of Commerce in Australia *Parliamentary Biography Category:1951 births Category:Living people Category:Australian monarchists Category:National Party of Australia members of the Parliament of Australia Category:Members of the Australian House of Representatives Category:Members of the Australian House of Representatives for Richmond Category:Leaders of the National Party of Australia Category:20th-century Australian politicians ","title":"Charles Blunt"},{"id":"401043","text":"Snowflake was a low-cost airline that operated out of Stockholm, Sweden, and Copenhagen, Denmark between 30 March 2003 and 30 October 2004. Owned by the SAS Group, it was organized as a business unit within Scandinavian Airlines, operating as a virtual airline using their crew and aircraft. Snowflake served a total 28 destinations from its bases at Stockholm Arlanda Airport and Copenhagen Airport. The concept was launched using four Boeing 737-800 aircraft. It mainly served Mediterranean holiday destinations, as well as destinations popular with expatriates. From March 2004 two 737 aircraft were replaced with two McDonnell Douglas MD-82s. The airline underestimated its costs and achieved an insufficient load factor, thus making services unprofitable. After operations ended, SAS continued to use Snowflake as a brand for discounted tickets to European destinations. History In 2003 SAS underwent a major restructuring program, which largely focused on reducing unit costs. As part of the program, the company's management, in cooperation with McKinsey & Company devised a scheme to better target the leisure market. The models of Ryanair and SAS' partner airline Lufthansa's low-cost subsidiary Germanwings were examined. SAS had just bought its main Norwegian competitor, Braathens, and had also significantly reduced Swedish domestic competition through the purchase of Linjeflyg. The airline was worried about new entrants in these markets, in particular about Ryanair and EasyJet. Boeing 737-800 at Barcelona‚ÄìEl Prat Airport The SAS Group announced plans for the airline on 10 December 2002, at the time giving it the provisional name Scandinavian Light. The company stated that they aimed to create a low-cost airline which would focus on the leisure holiday market and on Mediterranean destinations. SAS hoped that the new airline would target a different market than Scandinavian Airlines and that the latter could instead focus on the business. A challenge for the company was at the time that it had overcapacity after a recent drop in passenger numbers. The Snowflake brand was announced on 19 March 2003 and services commenced on 30 March. Four Boeing 737-800 were transferred to the new airline and painted in a new livery. Two were stationed at Stockholm Arlanda Airport and two at Copenhagen Airport. SAS chose not to launch the service in Norway. It considered the newly-formed SAS Braathens to be a lost- cost carrier and did not see the need for differentiation in the Norwegian market. Ticket prices started at 279 Swedish krona (SEK) and 295 Danish kroner (DKK) plus taxes. About ten seats per departure were sold at that price. Boeing 737-800 at Prague Ruzynƒõ Airport The first services were from Stockholm to Alicante, Athens, Barcelona, Bologna, Budapest, Dublin, Istanbul, M√°laga, Nice, Prague and Rome. From Copenhagen the airline's first flights were to Alicante, Athens, Bologna, Lisbon, M√°laga, Palma de Mallorca, Pristina and Sarajevo. The latter two were particularly aimed at expatriates, rather than tourists. By May the airline had achieved a load factor of seventy percent, increasing to eighty-two percent by September. Snowflake then announced three new destinations from Stockholm from the start of the winter program in October: Lyon, Beograd and Beirut. The latter two were mainly aimed at expatriates. A new fare scheme was introduced from 1 October, whereby there were eight price levels, ranging from ‚Ç¨58 to ‚Ç¨228. It also started offering discounted booking fees for tickets bought online. In November Snowflake announced that it would end services to Dublin and Barcelona, citing low profitability. Scandinavian Airlines started to serving Dublin itself. McDonnell Douglas MD-82 at Z√ºrich Airport Snowflake was hit by a strike within the SAS Group starting on 1 February 2004 amongst ground handlers. From February Snowflake introduced services from Stockholm to Bilbao and Olbia. Starting with the 2004 summer schedule, commencing 28 March, SAS introduced additional services. From Copenhagen the airline started flights to Ankara, Beirut, Skopje, Split and Valletta. From Stockholm services were introduced to Ankara, Inverness, Lisbon, Palma de Mallorca, Split, Skope and Valletta. At the same time two more aircraft, 156-seat McDonnell Douglas MD-82s, were introduced to the Snowflake fleet. In May 2004 the load factor drop to forty percent. Snowflake announced large cutbacks to the winter schedule, and planned to only operate four services: to Athens, Istanbul, Nice and Rome. This was down from thirteen during the previous winter season. With two flights each per week, this resulted in a very low fleet utilization rate. Snowflake had originally had success with their expatriate routes, but from 2004 passenger numbers fluctuated significantly on those routes. Similar cuts were carried out in Copenhagen: services were reduced to ten per week. This included the announcement of a new destination ‚Äì Cairo. Two services, to Dublin and Prague, were taken over from Stockholm by Scandinavian Airlines. A further four destinations were cut with the winter program. All services to Spain were taken over by Spanair, which at the time was also owned by the SAS Group. McDonnell Douglas MD-82 at Alicante Airport The load factor increased to eighty percent during the summer months. SAS announced on 18 August 2004 that it would terminate Snowflake services with effect 30 October. Snowflake would continue to exist as a brand name for discount tickets to European destinations. Operations Snowflake's business model was not the same as that of Scandinavian Airlines. Snowflake was organized as a business unit with in SAS Group, in the same manner as Scandinavian Airlines. The airline was thereby just a brand employed for particular services. The aircraft operated with Scandinavian Airlines' aircraft, crew and codes. The two also shared management. Snowflake was organized to become an internal customer within the group, for instance purchasing ground services from SAS Ground Services. A key component to the operations was that the Snowflake services would be able to operate at a lower cost than the main airline. However, it soon proved that the company was not able to achieve the internal prices that were used in calculating costs. For instance, Snowflake incurred the same ground handling costs as Scandinavian Airlines. No discounts were therefore granted from SAS Ground Services or external ground handling providers. Similarly, if a Snowflake aircraft became sufficiently delayed, a conventional SAS aircraft would be dispatched instead. Boeing 737-800 at Malta International Airport Snowflake was able to avoid many of the costs related to operating a network system. To begin with it operated only a single type of aircraft. These started and ended each day at their home base, avoiding accommodation costs for crews. The Snowflake business unit employed only five people. Snowflake incurred the same overhead costs as Scandinavian; the lack of a clear separation between the airlines at an operational level meant that Snowflake never succeeded in lowering unit costs below that of Scandinavian Airlines. Finally, operating only four aircraft was too small a fleet to achieve the necessary economy of scale. With the ticket prices based on cost savings which never materialized, the airline failed to operate with a profit. Service Tickets were sold online and by telephone. They had a lower base price, additional services, including in-flight meals cost extra. Surcharges were also charged by travel agencies, which sold tickets for an interim period. The airline only operated point-to-point services, rather than the network model used by Scandinavian Airline. Tickets were sold one-way and did not require a round trip and staying away over a Saturday to claim discounts. However, they did not support interlining. McDonnell Douglas MD-82 at Stockholm Arlanda Airport Standard fare included one piece of checked-in luggage. The airline had a selection of in-flight meals, food and beverages for sale. Customers could redeem miles earned through SAS' loyalty program Eurobonus, but miles could not be earned on flights with Snowflake. Snowflake services were popular for redemption because of the concentration of leisure destinations. Fleet The airline initially operated a fleet of four Boeing 737-800, with two aircraft based in Stockholm and two in Copenhagen. From March 2004 the two 737s in Copenhagen were replaced with two McDonnell Douglas MD-82. All aircraft were owned and operated by Scandinavian Airlines, but retained a distinctive livery with a lemon-colored vertical stabilizer and otherwise white body. They had single-class seating in a more dense configuration than in SAS' conventional aircraft. All the aircraft were registered in Norway. {class=\\"wikitable plainrowheaders sortable\\" + Snowflake fleet - !scope=col  Aircraft !scope=col  Image !scope=col  Quantity !scope=col  Seating - !scope=row  Boeing 737-800  150px  4  150 - !scope=row  McDonnell Douglas MD-82  150px  2  156 } Destinations Snowflake operated flights to a series of destinations from its bases in Copenhagen and Stockholm. They flew out of Terminal 2 at Copenhagen and Terminal 5 at Stockholm. Most flights had a limited frequency, typically one to four times per week. Flights operated to primary airports and not remote airports. To avoid cannibalizing customers from Scandinavian Airlines, Snowflake only flew to destinations not served by the other part of the group. This included several popular tourist destinations, such as London and Paris, which also attracted a large share of business travelers. {class=\\"wikitable plainrowheaders sortable\\" + Snowflake destinations ! scope=col  City ! scope=col  Country ! scope=col  Airport - ! scope=row  Alicante  Spain  Alicante Airport - ! scope=row  Ankara  Turkey  Esenboƒüa International Airport - ! scope=row  Athens  Greece  Athens International Airport - ! scope=row  Barcelona  Spain  Barcelona‚ÄìEl Prat Airport - ! scope=row  Beirut  Lebanon  Beirut‚ÄìRafic Hariri International Airport - ! scope=row  Belgrade  Serbia and Montenegro  Belgrade Nikola Tesla Airport - ! scope=row  Bilbao  Spain  Bilbao Airport - ! scope=row  Bologna  Italy  Bologna Guglielmo Marconi Airport - ! scope=row  Budapest  Hungary  Budapest Ferenc Liszt International Airport - ! scope=row  Copenhagen  Denmark  style=\\"background-color: #D0E7FF\\"  Copenhagen Airport[Base] - ! scope=row  Dublin  Ireland  Dublin Airport - ! scope=row  Inverness  United Kingdom  Inverness Airport - ! scope=row  Istanbul  Turkey  Atat√ºrk International Airport - ! scope=row  Lisbon  Portugal  Lisbon Portela Airport - ! scope=row  Lyon  France  Lyon‚ÄìSaint Exup√©ry Airport - ! scope=row  M√°laga  Spain  M√°laga Airport - ! scope=row  Nice  France  Nice C√¥te d'Azur Airport - ! scope=row  Olbia  Italy  Olbia Costa Smeralda Airport - ! scope=row  Palma de Mallorca  Spain  Palma de Mallorca Airport - ! scope=row  Prague  Czech Republic  V√°clav Havel Airport Prague - ! scope=row  Pristina  Serbia and Montenegro  Pristina International Airport - ! scope=row  Rome  Italy  Leonardo da Vinci‚ÄìFiumicino Airport - ! scope=row  Sarajevo  Bosnia and Herzegovina  Sarajevo International Airport - ! scope=row  Skopje  Macedonia  Skopje Airport - ! scope=row  Split  Croatia  Split Airport - ! scope=row  Stockholm  Sweden  style=\\"background-color: #D0E7FF\\"  Stockholm Arlanda Airport[Base] - ! scope=row  Luqa  Malta  Malta International Airport - ! scope=row  Venice  Italy  Venice Marco Polo Airport } References Category:Airlines established in 2003 Category:Airlines disestablished in 2004 Category:Defunct airlines of Denmark Category:Defunct airlines of Sweden Category:Defunct low-cost airlines Category:SAS Group Category:Scandinavian Airlines ","title":"Snowflake (airline)"},{"id":"401046","text":"Management process is a process of setting goals, planning and/or controlling the organizing and leading the execution of any type of activity, such as: * a project (project management process) or * a process (process management process, sometimes referred to as the process performance measurement and management system).

He is best known for developing the \\"Bazeries Cylinder\\", an improved version of Thomas Jefferson's cipher cylinder. It was later refined into the US Army M-94 cipher device. Historian David Kahn describes him as \\"the great pragmatist of cryptology. His theoretical contributions are negligible, but he was one of the greatest natural cryptanalysts the science has seen.\\" (Kahn 1996, p244) Bazeries was born in Port-Vendres, France, the son of a mounted policeman. In 1863 he enlisted in the army, and fought in the Franco-Prussian War, where he was taken prisoner, although he later managed to escape disguised as a bricklayer. In 1874 he was promoted to lieutenant, and sent to Algeria in 1875. He returned to France the following year and married Marie-Louise-Elodie Berthon, with whom he would father three daughters: C√©sarine, Fernande and Paule. He apparently became interested in cryptography through solving cryptograms in newspapers' personal columns, and soon applied his cryptanalytic skills in a military context when, in 1890, he solved messages enciphered with the official French military transposition system, causing the War Ministry to change to a new scheme. In an effort to prompt reform within the government and enhance national security, Bazeries further exposed weaknesses in French cipher systems.Candela, Rosario. The Military Cipher of Commandant Bazeries (New York: Cardanus Press, 1938), 4. In 1891, news of his talent had spread, and he began work for the Ministry of Foreign Affairs' Bureau du Chiffre. Bazeries continued his cryptanalytic work there even after he retired from the Army in 1899, assisting in solving German military ciphers during World War I. However, many of Bazeries recommendations to the government for improvements in official cipher systems met severe bureaucracy and rebuffs, which became a constant source of frustration for him in an otherwise illustrious career.Candela.

It is known for its advanced compound eyes. These brittle stars have long, thin arms emanating from a small, disk-shaped body, and are about the size of an outstretched human hand. Visual system Its arms are covered with calcite crystals. In addition to functioning as an armor and giving structural support, the crystals were, until recently, thought to form a visual system. They minimize spherical aberration of incoming light and have excellent optical properties. The lenses were suggested to work by filtering and focusing light on an underlying photoreceptor system. Nerve bundles under each lens, presumed to be light-sensitive, would transmit the optical information to the rest of the nervous system. However, the discovery of nerves and photoreceptor cells in between, rather than beneath, the lenses suggests that this system may not rely on their optical properties. The only known animals to employ a similar visual system were the now-extinct trilobites. Phototropic chromatophores can change O. wendtii's color and regulate how much light will reach the photoreceptors.

Merrie Melodies animated short. The cartoon was released on April 9, 1949, and features Bugs Bunny. Plot Bugs notices high bounties on various animals. $50 (about $ today) on foxes, $75 (about $ today) on bears, but then he becomes offended by the two-cent bounty (about $ today) on rabbits. Bugs has himself mailed to Washington, D.C., where a supercilious game commissioner explains that the bounty is so low because, while foxes and bears are \\"obnoxious\\" animals who damage property, \\"rabbits are perfectly harmless.\\" Bugs vows to prove that \\"a rabbit can be obnoxious than anybody\\" and storms out, slamming the game commissioner's door so hard that the glass shatters. Bugs begins his campaign of direct action by attacking a guard on the leg with his own billy club. From there, he pulls stunts like renaming Barney Baruch's private bench to \\"Bugs Bunny\\", painting barbershop pole stripes on the Washington Monument, and rewiring the lights in Times Square to read \\"BUGS BUNNY WUZ HERE\\". Various newspapers comment about Bugs' actions as he shuts down Niagara Falls (revealing some barrels underneath it). Bugs then sells the entire island of Manhattan back to the Native Americans and is shown walking through it wearing a stereotypical feathered headdress and smoking a peace pipe, asiding to the audience that \\"they wouldn't take it back unless I threw in a set of dishes\\". Afterwards, Bugs saws Florida off from the rest of the country, and quotes \\"South America, take it away!\\" Bugs then wonders what other kind of devilry he can commit. Bugs heads to Panama and swipes all the locks off the Panama Canal, which are represented as actual locks as he yells \\"I got 'em! I got 'em!\\". Bugs then heads to Arizona where he fills up the Grand Canyon. He then concludes his campaign by literally tying up railroad tracks. An outraged Senator Claghorn‚Äìesque Congressman speaks before the United States Congress and demands that they take action against Bugs, but is interrupted by Bugs who emerges from the congressman's hat, slaps him and gives him a mocking kiss. The cartoon then shows live-action footage of the entire War Department mobilizing against him. Tanks come rumbling out of their garages, soldiers pour out of barracks, and bugles blow as the news of this is shown. Bugs, now satisfied with the $1 million bounty on his head (about $ today, although the bounty is for him specifically, not rabbits in general), is snapped out of a Tarzan yell by the whole US Army coming after him, much to his horror. Bugs then dives into a fox hole as artillery shells surround the foxhole. Bugs then says \\"Could it be that I carried this thing too far?\\" just as the shells explode. It then cuts to Alcatraz Island where Bugs, in his jail cell, finally remarks \\"Ehhh, could be...!\\" Availability The uncut short is available on the Looney Tunes Golden Collection: Volume 3 DVD set.

He served as Member of Parliament for Oxford, Derby then West Monmouthshire and held the offices of Home Secretary and Chancellor of the Exchequer under William Ewart Gladstone before becoming Leader of the Opposition. A talented speaker in parliament, he was sometimes regarded as aloof and possessing only an intellectual involvement in his causes. He failed to engender much emotional response in the public and became only a reluctant and disillusioned leader of his party. Historian Roy Jenkins says he was \\"too much of a party man. In manner and by origin he was a patrician figure, but he saw most issues exclusively in terms of parliamentary infighting....His views were usually much more of a reaction to what his political enemies, in the other party and in his own, were saying then the result of any objective thought. He inspired considerable loyalty among his followers--the Great Gladiator he was sometimes enthusiastically called--but his colleagues, partly as a result of his execrable temperament and his bullying...found him a difficult man with whom to work.\\"Roy Jenkins, \\"From Gladstone to Asquith: The Late Victorian Pattern of Liberal Leadership,\\" History Today (July 1964) 14#7 pp 445-452 at page 446-447. Family and ancestry Harcourt was the second son of Canon William Vernon Harcourt, a scientist and owner of Nuneham Park, Nuneham Courtenay, Oxfordshire and his wife Matilda Mary, daughter of Colonel William Gooch. His father was the fourth son and eventually heir of Edward Harcourt, Archbishop of York and his wife Lady Anne Leveson-Gower. Anne was a daughter of Granville Leveson-Gower, 1st Marquess of Stafford and kinswoman Lady Louisa Egerton. Her maternal grandparents included Scroop Egerton, 1st Duke of Bridgewater and Rachel. Rachel was a daughter of Wriothesley Russell, 2nd Duke of Bedford and the rich heiress Elizabeth, daughter of John Howland of Streatham. William was, due to the family's appendage of a surname to recognise an inheritance, born a Vernon, and his position as a senior heir in the landed Vernon and Harcourt was emphasised by his link to many of the greater English houses, a fact of which he was proud. In later life his descent from the Plantagenets was a joke among his political opponents. His probate was sworn in the year he died (when he was resident at Nuneham Park and at Malwood in Hampshire) then resworn, over ¬£3000 upward, at ninepence short of .https://probatesearch.service.gov.uk Calendar of Probates and Administrations Education and early life William's childhood was an austere one, educated at home by a Swiss governess, he was sent to a private school at Southwell, Nottinghamshire when he was eight. William's father denied him a public school education, sending him to be educated in classics at the small class of Rev. John Owen Parr. In 1840, Parr moved to Preston and William witnessed the Preston bread riots there in 1842. He left Parr in 1844 and, after two more years' study at home, William entered Trinity College, Cambridge to pursue his interest in mathematics. At Cambridge he became an Apostle, and graduated with first-class honours in the classics tripos in 1851, but he did not enjoy the mathematics, graduating only senior optime. At Cambridge, William rejected his family's Tory instincts and began to write for the Morning Chronicle in support of Sir Robert Peel. William's father encouraged him to seek a Cambridge fellowship or a career in politics but William chose law and journalism. He entered Lincoln's Inn in 1852 and was called to the bar at the Inner Temple in 1854. He quickly made his mark as a speaker, his reception into London society being eased by his uncle George Harcourt and aunt Frances Waldegrave. From 1855 William started to write for the Saturday Review, becoming increasingly a follower of William Ewart Gladstone and an opponent of Lord Palmerston. He practised in railway law, commentating, especially in The Times on international law. In 1862, he wrote some famous letters to The Times over the signature of \\"Historicus,\\" supporting Britain's neutrality in the American Civil War and condemning the widespread public sympathy for the Confederate States. He also wrote on the Trent Affair and the Alabama controversy.Harcourt (1863, 1865) He became a Queen's Counsel in 1866, and was appointed Whewell professor of international law at the University of Cambridge in 1869. Political career Harcourt entered parliament as Liberal member for Oxford, and sat from 1868 to 1880, being appointed Solicitor General and knighted in 1873. He was re-elected in the Liberal victory at the 1880 United Kingdom general election and, though he had not been a strong supporter of Gladstone in opposition, he was appointed Home Secretary. A mandatory re-election was then required on acceptance of such an office and Harcourt was defeated by Alexander William Hall by just 54 votes. Though Hall was then unseated for political corruption, a seat was found for Harcourt at Derby, by the voluntary retirement of Samuel Plimsoll. He continued to co- represent Derby until 1895, when, having been defeated, he found a seat in West Monmouthshire. ATn published in Vanity Fair in 1870. His name became connected with the passing of the Ground Game Act 1880 and the Arms (Ireland) Act 1881. As Home Secretary at the time of the Phoenix Park killings and the subsequent London bombings he reacted rapidly, and the Explosive Substances Act 1883 was passed through all its stages in the shortest time on record. His robust stand on law and order brought him into conflict with the Irish members. In 1884 he introduced an aborted bill for unifying the municipal administration of London. and led the demand for a prosecution in the survival cannibalism case of Dudley and Stephens, but also advised the Queen to grant clemency, to six months' in prison. In 1885 he similarly saw commutation of John 'Babbacombe' Lee's death penalty to life imprisonment after his execution failed three times. He was further the victim of the embarrassing stunts of the Harcourt interpolation and the Home Office Baby. =Chancellor of the Exchequer= He was recognised as one of the ablest and most effective leaders of the Liberal party and when, after a brief interval in 1885, Gladstone returned to office in 1886, Harcourt was made Chancellor of the Exchequer, an office which he again filled from 1892 to 1895. Between 1880 and 1892 Harcourt acted as Gladstone's political deputy. A first-rate party fighter, his services were of huge value. However, in spite of his great success as a platform speaker, he was generally felt to be speaking from an \\"advocate's brief\\", and did not impress the public as a conviction politician. It was he who coined the phrase about \\"stewing in Parnellite juice\\", and, when the split came in the Liberal party on the Irish question, even those who gave Gladstone and John Morley the credit of being convinced Home Rulers could not be persuaded that Harcourt had followed anything but the line of party expediency. Sir William Harcourt c1895 In 1894 he introduced and carried a memorable budget, which equalised the death duties on real and personal property. After Gladstone's retirement in 1894 and Lord Rosebery's selection as prime minister, Harcourt became the leader of the Liberal party in the House of Commons, but it was never probable that he would work comfortably in the new conditions. He had been ignored as Gladstone's successor, and it was evident that Rosebery's ideas of Liberalism and of the policy of the Liberal Party were not those of Harcourt. Their differences were patched up from time to time, but the combination was unstable. However the one significant legacy of the government was the introduction of a high uniform rate of death duties in Harcourt's 1894 budget. Harcourt himself was a second son, and thus unlikely to ever have to pay such duties himself, so it was often quipped that this introduction was a \\"second son's revenge\\". However, this proved to not be the case, when Harcourt inherited the Nuneham Park estate in Oxfordshire. =Leader of the Opposition= At the 1895 elections it was clear that there were divisions as to what issue the Liberals were fighting for. The effect of Harcourt's aborted Local Veto Bill, which would have given parishes the right to vote on the closure of all local public houses, on the election was seen not only in his defeat at Derby, which gave the signal for the Liberal rout, but in the set-back it gave to temperance legislation. Though returned for West Monmouthshire (1895, 1900), Harcourt's speeches in debate only occasionally showed his characteristic spirit, and it was evident that for the hard work of opposition he no longer had the same motivation as of old. In October 1896 Gladstone, in his last public speech, called for action to support the Armenians who were being massacred by their Ottoman rulers. Harcourt backed Gladstone but Rosebery used the incident as an excuse to resign as Leader of the Opposition and Harcourt became an unenthusiastic leader. During Harcourt's period as leader of the Liberal party in the House of Commons, the all-House enquiry into the failed Jameson Raid took place. Harcourt's performance in the enquiry disillusioned sections of the Liberal party, as the Opposition let the Conservative government off the hook by not exposing the involvement of the Colonial Secretary Joseph Chamberlain in the raid's genesis and preparation, Harcourt instead settling for censure of the Prime Minister of the Cape Colony, Cecil Rhodes. In December 1898 the crisis arrived and, with Morley, Harcourt retired from the party and resigned his Leadership of the Opposition, alleging as his reason, in letters to Morley, the cross-currents of opinion among his old supporters and former colleagues. The split excited considerable comment, and resulted in much heart-searching and a more or less open division between the section of the Liberal party following Rosebery and those who disliked his imperialism. Though now a private member, Harcourt still continued to assert his independent position, and his attacks on the government were no longer restrained by any deference to Liberal Imperialism. He actively intervened in 1899 and 1900, strongly condemning the government's financial policy and their attitude towards the Transvaal. Throughout the Second Boer War he lost no opportunity of criticising the South African developments in a pessimistic vein. A great parliamentary debater, he sprinkled his speeches with humour. From 1898 to 1900 he was conspicuous, both on the platform and in letters to The Times, in demanding active measures against Ritualism in the Church of England. However, his attitude in this was reflected in his political advocacy of disestablishment. In March 1904, just after he had announced his intention not to seek election again to parliament, he succeeded, by the death of his nephew, to the family estates at Nuneham. He found that the estate was in crisis, especially after having to pay the death duties he himself had introduced, and he died suddenly there in the same year. Harcourt was offered a peerage in 1902 but he declined it in order to stay in the House of Commons, and to allow his son to advance his political career. Marriages and children Sir William Harcourt in 1890. On 5 November 1859, Harcourt married his first wife Maria Theresa Lister, known as Therese. She was a daughter of novelist Thomas Henry Lister and Lady Maria Theresa Villiers. They had two children: *Julian Harcourt (6 October 1860 ‚Äì 2 March 1862). *Lewis Harcourt, 1st Viscount Harcourt (31 January 1863 ‚Äì 24 February 1922). Originally christened Reginald, but rechristened at the age of two months. Lewis Harcourt served as Private Secretary to his father and later became a prominent politician in his own right, most notably as Secretary of State for the Colonies from 1910 to 1915. His first wife died on 1 February 1863, only a day after giving birth to their second and last son. Harcourt remained a widower for thirteen years. On 2 December 1876, he married his second wife Elizabeth Cabot Motley. Elizabeth was a daughter of American historian John Lothrop Motley and his wife Mary Benjamin. Her maternal uncle Park Benjamin was a patent lawyer and writer on scientific subjects. She had been previously married to naval officer Thomas Poynton Ives. Ives was among the casualties of the American Civil War. By this second marriage, Harcourt had his third and final son: *Robert Harcourt (born 7 May 1878). He married Marjorie Laura Cunard. Their daughter Mary Elizabeth Harcourt married Ian Rochfort Johnston, a Commander of the Royal Navy.

The problem of identifying the cause of this effect has been featured in Scientific American magazine, with several theories given to explain the phenomenon but no definite conclusion. The shower-curtain effect may also be used to describe the observation how nearby phase front distortions of an optical wave are more severe than remote distortions of the same amplitude. Hypotheses  =Buoyancy hypothesis = Also called Chimney effect or Stack effect, observes that warm air (from the hot shower) rises out over the shower curtain as cooler air (near the floor) pushes in under the curtain to replace the rising air. By pushing the curtain in towards the shower, the (short range) vortex and CoandƒÉ effects become more significant. However, the shower-curtain effect persists when cold water is used, implying that this cannot be the only mechanism at work. =Bernoulli effect hypothesis = The most popular explanation given for the shower-curtain effect is Bernoulli's principle. Bernoulli's principle states that an increase in velocity results in a decrease in pressure. This theory presumes that the water flowing out of a shower head causes the air through which the water moves to start flowing in the same direction as the water. This movement would be parallel to the plane of the shower curtain. If air is moving across the inside surface of the shower curtain, Bernoulli's principle says the air pressure there will drop. This would result in a pressure differential between the inside and outside, causing the curtain to move inward. It would be strongest when the gap between the bather and the curtain is smallest, resulting in the curtain attaching to the bather. =Horizontal vortex hypothesis = A computer simulation of a typical bathroom found that none of the above theories pan out in their analysis, but instead found that the spray from the shower-head drives a horizontal vortex. This vortex has a low-pressure zone in the centre, which sucks the curtain. David Schmidt of University of Massachusetts was awarded the 2001 Ig Nobel Prize in Physics for his partial solution to the question of why shower curtains billow inwards. He used a computational fluid dynamics code to achieve the results. Professor Schmidt is adamant that this was done \\"for fun\\" in his own free time without the use of grants. =CoandƒÉ effect= The CoandƒÉ effect, also known as \\"boundary layer attachment\\", is the tendency of a moving fluid to adhere to an adjacent wall. =Condensation= A hot shower will produce steam that condenses on the shower side of the curtain, lowering the pressure there. In a steady state the steam will be replaced by new steam delivered by the shower but in reality the water temperature will fluctuate and lead to times when the net steam production is negative. =Air pressure= Colder dense air outside and hot less dense air inside causes higher air pressure on the outside to force the shower curtain inwards to equalise the air pressure, this can be observed simply when the bathroom door is open allowing cold air into the bathroom. Solutions Many shower curtains come with features to reduce the shower-curtain effect. They may have adhesive suction cups on the bottom edges of the curtain, which are then pushed onto the sides of the shower when in use. Others may have magnets at the bottom, though these are not effective on acrylic or fiberglass tubs. It is possible to use a telescopic shower curtain rod to block the curtain on its lower part and to prevent it from sucking inside. Hanging the curtain rod higher or lower, or especially further away from the shower head, can reduce the effect. A (convex) curved shower rod can also be used to hold the curtain against the inside wall of a tub. A weight can be attached to a long string and the string attached to the curtain rod in the middle of the curtain (on the inside). Hanging the weight low against the curtain just above the rim of the shower pan or tub makes it an effective billowing deterrent without allowing the weight to hit the pan or tub and damage it. There are a few alternative solutions that either attach to the shower curtain directly, attach to the shower rod or attach to the wall.

He first entered politics as an activist for the Populist Party, and continued this affiliation after he moved to Texas. In 1899, just before moving to Oklahoma Territory to practice law in Lawton, he formally joined the Democratic Party and campaigned for William Jennings Bryan. In the Senate, his anti-war beliefs caused him conflict with Democratic presidents Woodrow Wilson and Franklin D. Roosevelt. Gore lost his eyesight during his youth. He was the maternal grandfather of noted author Gore Vidal. Early life Gore was born on December 10, 1870, near Embry, Mississippi in Webster County, Mississippi, the son of Caroline Elizabeth (n√©e Wingo) and Thomas Madison Gore.http://www.wargs.com/political/gore.html The Gore family was one of the nineteen original families that owned farmlands in what later became the capital of the United States, the District of Columbia. The Gores were Anglo-Irish from Donegal and arrived in North America at the end of the seventeenth century and tended to intermarry with other Anglo-Irish families, particularly in Virginia. When the District was established in 1790, the families that had been dispossessed to make way for the capital city, including the Gores, reaped significant financial rewards. The Gores who remained either sold their land in lots, built homes or hotels, and all became rich. The Gores that moved away, including the branch of Thomas Pryor Gore, moved to the far West, which in those days was Mississippi. Young Thomas and his family moved to Walthall, the county seat, when his father was elected Chancery Clerk of Sumner County. He went blind as a child through two separate accidents but did not give up his dream of becoming a senator. Despite his blindness, he excelled in school and showed special talents in debate and oratory. Career He taught school briefly after graduation. In 1882, he served as a page in the Mississippi Senate. He moved to Lebanon, Tennessee in 1891, and received a law degree from Cumberland University Law School in the following year. He was admitted to the Mississippi Bar and joined his father's law firm in Mississippi. =Populist Party politics= The Gore family had been prominent members of the Southern Farmers' Alliance. Young Thomas was addressing Alliance meetings as early as 1888. The Alliance nominated him for the state legislature, but he had to withdraw because he was still a minor. Instead he served as a presidential elector for the Populist party in 1892. This experience expanded his reputation as an orator. In 1894, the Populist party of Navarro County, Texas invited him to come to Corsicana to help them win elections. He and his brother, Ellis, moved there in December, 1894, where they opened a law office. Meanwhile, he returned to Mississippi to run for the legislature in 1895, a race which he lost. He campaigned vigorously from Utah to New York for William Jennings Bryan, the Democratic candidate for President in 1900. Returning to Texas, he ran as a Populist candidate for the 6th Congressional District in 1898, but lost because the party was already in decline. He served as a delegate to the Populist convention that year, but in 1899, formally joined the Democratic Party. =Democratic Party politics= After marrying Nina Kay in December 1900, the Gores moved to Lawton, in Oklahoma Territory. In 1902, he entered and won an election for the Oklahoma Territorial Senate. He declined an opportunity to run as a territorial representative for the U. S, Congress, but became an adviser to the 1907 Constitutional Convention, then was elected to the U. S. Senate in 1907. In 1907, he was elected to the Senate as one of the first two senators from the new state of Oklahoma. He was re-elected in 1908 and 1914 but lost his seat\\"Burke, Bob. \\"Gore, Thomas Pryor (1870 - 1949)\\". Accessed October 14, 2016. in 1920. Gore and William H. \\"Alfalfa Bill\\" Murray were co-leaders of Woodrow Wilson's Oklahoma campaign for the Presidency in 1912. He was known as a member of the progressive wing of the Democratic Party, who supported many of Wilson's domestic programs, and worked well with Republicans such as Robert La Follette. He was to a large extent no different from any other politician because of his blindness, but there were problems, as La Follette recounts an example in his memoirs when, during a filibuster, Gore did not realize that the senator who was to take over speaking for him had left the room, and the filibuster failed because he did not continue to speak. Also, some of Gore's colleagues in the Senate would attempt to take advantage of Gore's blindness by tricking him into signing documents that it was not in his party's interest for him to sign. He was famous for turning the tables on these sharp dealers and tricking them into signing documents that they did not intend to sign. These exploits made him popular with the press, who dubbed him \\"The Blind Cowboy.\\" In 1910, he accused lobbyist Jake L. Hamon Sr., of trying to bribe him. Gore's political enemies set a trap to discredit him during the 1914 senatorial campaign in Oklahoma. A woman asked Gore to meet her in her hotel room to discuss a political appointment for her husband. Afterward, she claimed he had \\"taken advantage\\" of her. When skeptical prosecutors refused to charge the senator, the woman filed a $50,000 suit against Gore. The senator's lawyer attended the civil trial and called it \\"a political trial.\\" The phrase appeared in many newspaper headlines nationwide. The jury exonerated Gore and the woman lost her suit. Gore was a pacifist and an anti-interventionist who campaigned against militarism, and loudly and vociferously condemned the malefactors of wealth as being the impetus for pushing America towards war;http://knoxfocus.com/archives/this-weeks-focus/thomas-p- gore-o/https://www.thenation.com/article/an-epic-on-air-debate-40-years-ago- marked-the-downfall-of-television-news/ though he was often referred to as an isolationist. He voted against the Wilson Administration on most legislation pertaining to World War I. However, a majority of Oklahoma voters favored helping the Allies fight Germany. After the war, he also opposed Wilson's plan to support a League of Nations. Not only did Gore alienate many previous supporters, but he also lost his close relationship with Wilson. Thus, he lost his bid for reelection in 1920. After leaving the Senate, he returned to his private law practice full-time in Washington D.C. Gore in 1929 During the early stages of World War I, he co-authored the Gore-McLemore Resolution to encourage American citizens not to travel aboard merchant vessels of countries participating in the war. The merchant vessels were under threat of attack by German U-boats, and the Senator felt the loss of American lives in attacks upon these boats put American neutrality at risk. He was a strong, early supporter of Woodrow Wilson's, indeed, one acknowledged as the very first major elected official to endorse Wilson's candidacy for President in 1911. Yet Gore later opposed America's entry into the war even after American involvement began. He unsuccessfully opposed providing manpower for the military by conscription, saying it would create \\"an army of conscripted slackers.\\" He asked: \\"Why should we brand the American boy as a conscript without affording him the opportunity to earn the glory of an American volunteer?\\"Christopher Cappozolla, Uncle Sam Wants You: World War I and the Making of the Modern American Citizen (NY: Oxford University Press, 2008), 26 This was the principal cause of Gore's defeat in the Democratic primary in 1920 by Congressman Scott Ferris, who was in turn defeated in the general election by Republican John W. Harreld. In addition to his opposition to the draft, Gore \\"was one of the earliest and most vigorous sponsors of a constitutional amendment to require a popular referendum on any congressional declaration of war.\\"Kauffman, Bill (2006-11-20) The Populist Patriotism of Gore Vidal, The American Conservative On domestic policy he was a supporter of the interests of farmers and Native Americans. Gore was re-elected to the Senate in 1930. When Franklin D. Roosevelt took office as President, Gore at first supported his New Deal policies but later feuded with him. In 1935, Gore helped lead the charge against funding the Works Progress Administration (WPA). In written response to constituents who favored the WPA, he told them that their attitude \\"shows how the dole spoils the soul. Your telegram intimates that your votes are for sale. Much as I value votes I am not in the market. I cannot consent to buy votes with the people's money. I owe a debt to the taxpayer as well as to the unemployed.\\" After dictating these words, the blind senator was led to the Senate floor to cast the lone vote against the WPA.Billington, Monroe L, Thomas P.

Drizzt was created by author R. A. Salvatore as a supporting character in the Icewind Dale Trilogy. Salvatore created him on a whim when his publisher needed him to replace one of the characters in an early version of the first book, The Crystal Shard. Drizzt has since become a popular heroic character of the Forgotten Realms setting, and has been featured as the main character of a long series of books, starting chronologically with The Dark Elf Trilogy. As an atypical drow (dark elf), Drizzt has forsaken both the evil ways of his people and their home in the Underdark, in the drow city of Menzoberranzan. Drizzt's story is told in Salvatore's fantasy novels in The Icewind Dale Trilogy, The Dark Elf Trilogy, the Legacy of the Drow series, the Paths of Darkness series, The Hunter's Blades Trilogy, the Transitions series, and the Neverwinter Saga, as well as in the short stories \\"The Dowry\\", \\"Dark Mirror\\", and \\"Comrades at Odds\\". All of the novels featuring Drizzt have made the New York Times Best Seller list. A number of the novels have been adapted into graphic novels by Devil's Due Publishing. Drizzt has also been featured in D&D-based; role-playing video games, including the Baldur's Gate Series and Forgotten Realms: Demon Stone.  Concept and creation  Drizzt Do'Urden's stories are set in the Forgotten Realms campaign setting for Dungeons & Dragons. The character has been a mainstay for author R. A. Salvatore, appearing in his novels for over 30 years. Drizzt is a drow who acts against the drow stereotype, favoring friendship and peace over hatred and violence. His unusual personality creates the conflict that allows Salvatore to create so many novels with stories about courage and friendship. Drizzt therefore fights the dark traits that are inherent in the drow. Salvatore uses Drizzt to represent issues of racial prejudice, particularly in The Dark Elf Trilogy. For instance, Drizzt is concerned that if he and his love Cattie-Brie (a human) have children, their offspring will face hostility from both races. Drizzt is also troubled by the lifespan discrepancy between himself and Cattie-Brie. Drizzt was created by happenstance. In 1987 R.A. Salvatore sent Mary Kirchoff, then managing editor of TSR's book department, a manuscript for what would become his 1990 novel Echoes of the Fourth Magic. She liked it, but asked if he could rewrite it to take place in the Forgotten Realms. She sent him Darkwalker on Moonshae by Douglas Niles, the only novel at the time set in the Forgotten Realms. Salvatore sent her a proposal for a sequel to Darkwalker, but Kirchoff sent back a large map of the Forgotten Realms and told him she wanted a new story set in a different part of the Realms. After two weeks of phone calls, Salvatore found a spot on the map that was not already designated for another project, and he located Icewind Dale there. According to Salvatore, the book was \\"set on the Moonshae Isles, because at the time I thought that was the Realms. When I found out how big the Realms were, I moved the story a thousand miles to the north.\\" Salvatore created Drizzt on the spur of the moment. He was under pressure to create a sidekick for Wulfgar in the Icewind Dale series. Salvatore had sent an early version of The Crystal Shard (what would become his first published novel) to TSR, and one day Kirchoff called him. She was on her way to a marketing meeting concerning the book, and informed him that they could not use one of the characters. He asked for time to think, but she was already late for the meeting. Off the top of his head, Salvatore said he had a Dark Elf. Kirchoff was skeptical, but Salvatore convinced her it would be fine because he was just a sidekick. She asked his name, and he replied Drizzt Do'Urden. She asked if he could spell it, and he said \\"not a chance\\". Recalling Drizzt's creation in an interview, Salvatore said, \\"I don't know where it came from. I guess that Gary Gygax just did such an amazing job in creating the drow elves that something about them got stuck in the back of my head. Thank God!\\" Although many readers have assumed that Drizzt is based on one of the many Dungeons & Dragons role-playing campaigns that the author has played, this is not the case. Salvatore's main influences were classical literature and works of J. R. R. Tolkien. \\"I like to think of Drizzt as a cross between Daryth from Darkwalker on Moonshae and Aragorn from The Lord of the Rings.\\" Salvatore calls Drizzt \\"the classic romantic hero‚Äîmisunderstood, holding to a code of ideals even when the going gets tough, and getting no appreciation for it most of the time.\\"  Publication history  R.A. Salvatore Drizzt's story begins in the novel Homeland, the start of The Dark Elf Trilogy and published in 1990 as a prequel to The Icewind Dale Trilogy, which was published between 1988 and 1990. In the book, Drizzt is born in Menzoberranzan as the third son to Matron Malice, the leader of House Do'Urden (a type of family akin to a Scottish clan). His father is Zaknafein, a weapons master who secretly hates drow society and teaches Drizzt his martial skills as he reinforces Drizzt's innate moral code. The 1996 short story \\"The Fires of Narbondel\\", in the Realms of the Underdark anthology, describes unrelated events involving Zaknafein as the main character, and a young Drizzt plays a supporting role. During a raid against a group of surface elves, Drizzt finds himself unable to participate in the slaughter with his fellow drow. He pretends to kill an elf child, but actually helps her to escape. When the deception is discovered, Zaknafein is sacrificed in Drizzt's stead to appease Lolth, the drow's goddess. Following a war against another House, Drizzt curses his family and the evil drow ways and escapes Menzoberranzan into the Underdark. At this time he also acquires the statuette that allows him to summon the magical panther Guenhwyvar. Guenhwyvar travels by Drizzt's side as he makes his way across the Realms. Drizzt fights off the resurrected spirit-wraith of his father in Exile, the second book in the Dark Elf Trilogy and also published in 1990. SojournSojourn reached 13 on the New York Times bestseller list on May 26, 1991. picks up the story when Drizzt leaves the Underdark for the surface, where he meets a blind human ranger named Montolio Debrouchee. When Montolio begins teaching him the ways of the ranger, Drizzt realizes that, unknowingly, he had been following those very principles his entire life. From then on Drizzt's patron goddess is Mielikki, the Faer√ªnian goddess of the forest and of rangers. Montolio eventually dies, and Drizzt travels the Realms in search of a new home. He eventually finds himself in Icewind Dale where he meets dwarven king Bruenor Battlehammer, and Bruenor's adopted human daughter, Catti-brie. The fourth book chronologically in the series, although the first published, is The Crystal Shard (1988), the first in The Icewind Dale Trilogy. It describes Drizzt's meeting with the barbarian Wulfgar and the halfling Regis, and their adventures as they stop Akar Kessel, a mage possessed by the sentient artifact Crenshinibon (the book's eponymous Crystal Shard), from gaining control of the region. Streams of Silver (1989), tells the story of the group as they journey to Mithral Hall, Bruenor's boyhood home. Artemis Entreri, a recurring character in the series, also makes his first appearance. In later books, Artemis is Drizzt's equal in combat, and they clash often due to their conflicting views and goals. In the 1990 book The Halfling's Gem,The Halfling's Gem reached 12 on the New York Times bestseller list on March 4, 1990. Artemis kidnaps Regis while in the employ of a powerful crime lord. Drizzt and Wulfgar chase the assassin by sea, with the help of Captain Deudermont, to recover Regis. Drizzt ends up in combat with Artemis Entreri, who leaves the battle wounded. At the end of the book the group finds Regis, and Guenhwyvar kills Artemis's employer. Legacy of the Drow is a tetralogy, unlike the previous two trilogies. The 1993 short story, Dark Mirror, in the Realms of Valor anthology, describes events just prior to the series. The first three books, The Legacy,The Legacy reached 10 on the New York Times bestseller list on October 4, 1992. Starless Night,Starless Night reached 12 on the New York Times bestseller list on September 19, 1993. and Siege of Darkness,Siege of Darkness reached 13 on the New York Times bestseller list on September 18, 1994. describe a drow attack on Mithril Hall. Wulfgar is seemingly slain by a yochlol, and Drizzt returns to Menzoberranzan to prevent his friends from being further attacked by dark elves. The drow launch a second attack against Mithril Hall during the Time of Troubles. It is eventually repelled and Drizzt returns to his friends. Passage to Dawn,Passage to Dawn reached 15 on the New York Times bestseller list on September 8, 1996. the final book in the Legacy of the Drow series and published two years after Siege of Darkness, picks up the story six years after the drow attack. Drizzt and Catti-Brie work with Captain Deudermont on his pirate-hunting ship, with the Companions of the Hall ultimately fighting the powerful demon Errtu who is aided by the Crystal Shard, which had previously been buried under a mountain of snow . Wulfgar, never truly dead, returns to life from the Abyss as the demon who had held his soul was destroyed. Drizzt is the main character in only two books of the Paths of Darkness series. The Silent Blade (1998) describes the group's journey to permanently destroy the Crystal Shard. Sea of Swords (2001)Sea of Swords reached 14 on the New York Times bestseller list on November 18, 2001. continues Drizzt's story after the events of The Spine of the World (1999), which focuses on Wulfgar, and Servant of the Shard (2000), which has Artemis Entreri and Jarlaxle as the main characters. Sea of Swords covers the companions' search for Wulfgar's lost magical warhammer, Aegis- fang, and the reunion of the group after an extended separation. Drizzt returns as the main character throughout The Hunter's Blades Trilogy. In The Thousand Orcs (2002),The Thousand Orcs reached 11 on the New York Times bestseller list on November 3, 2002. Drizzt and his friends encounter the powerful orc Obould Many-Arrows, who has employed frost giants to aid him in gaining control of the region. After a battle at the town of Shallows, Drizzt believes the other Companions of the Hall to have fallen in battle, and he sets off into the wilderness to fight all orcs in vengeance. The Lone Drow (2003)The Lone Drow reached 7 on the New York Times bestseller list on November 16, 2003. continues this storyline as the still-living Companions protect Mithril Hall from orc attacks without the aid of Drizzt. He is reunited with his friends in The Two Swords (2003).The Two Swords reached 9 on the New York Times bestseller list on November 14, 2004. R.A. Salvatore's next series of Forgotten Realms books, The Sellswords Trilogy, focus on the further adventures of Artemis Entreri and Jarlaxle, with Drizzt only being mentioned in them. However, Drizzt is once again the main character in the Transitions trilogy, consisting of The Orc King,The Orc King reached 17 on the New York Times bestseller list on November 11, 2007. The Pirate King,The Pirate King reached 8 on the New York Times bestseller list on November 2, 2008. and The Ghost King.The Ghost King reached 11 on the New York Times bestseller list on October 25th, 2009. Drizzt is the main character, along with Bruenor, in R.A. Salvatore's next series in the Forgotten Realms, Neverwinter Saga; the first book in this series, Gauntlgrym, was released October 5, 2010.Gauntlgrym reached 13 on the New York Times bestseller list on October 24, 2010. The second book in the series Neverwinter, was released October 4, 2011,Neverwinter reached 8 on the New York Times bestseller list on October 23, 2011. with the third installment entitled Charon's Claw released August 7, 2012.Charon's Claw reached 13 on the New York Times bestseller list on August 26th, 2012. The fourth book in the series \\"The Last Threshold\\", was released March 5, 2013.The Last Threshold reached 20 on the New York Times bestseller list on March 24th, 2013.  Reception and legacy According to PopMatters' Andrew Welsh, Drizzt is Salvatore's attempt to create a multifaceted character who faces internal struggles, in hopes of standing out from the drow, and fantasy fiction in general. Welsh feels that Salvatore fails in this regard, saying \\"any blood Drizzt finds on his hands is quickly justified and most 'internal' conflict is superficial at best.\\" A review for Pyramid refers to Drizzt as the \\"most famous denizen\\" of Menzoberranzan, identifying him and the city as \\"some of the most famous pieces of the Realms\\". Rob Bricken of Kotaku called Drizzt \\"one of the Mary Sue-iest characters in all of fiction\\". The Drizzt Do'Urden books are popular with fantasy fans, and the Drizzt character is author R.A. Salvatore's best known creation. All 34 novels featuring Drizzt by Salvatore have made the New York Times Best Seller list, starting with The Crystal Shard. The Orc King, which marked the 20th anniversary of the character, made it to #7 on the list, as well as #9 on the Wall Street Journal list, #6 on the Publishers Weekly bestseller list, and #36 on the USA Today list of top sellers. The Two Swords peaked at #4 on the New York Times Best Seller list in 2004. It reached the top of the Wall Street Journal's hardcover bestseller list after only two weeks, a record for its publisher Wizards of the Coast. It also debuted at #4 on The New York Times's bestseller list and #2 on Publisher's Weekly bestseller list. The Lone Drow debuted at #7 on the New York Times Best Seller list in October 2003. Publishers Weekly felt that The Lone Drow was clich√©d, but that some of the characters did achieve \\"some complexity\\". They singled out two characters for praise: Innovindel, an elf who talks \\"pensively\\" of her long life in contrast to the short lived humans, and Obould the orc king. A special Icewind Dale adventure was featured as the centerpiece at the November 3, 2007, Worldwide Dungeons and Dragons Game Day event, in honor of the 20th anniversary of the creation of Drizzt. Drizzt Do'Urden was #3 on Game Rant's 2020 \\"10 Must-Have NPCs In Dungeons & Dragons Lore To Make Your Campaigns Awesome\\" list ‚Äî the article states that \\"A skilled ranger in his own right, Drizzt remains equally-adept in conversation. He's always wary of danger, strives for perfection, and held himself to the highest standard. Meeting one of the most iconic figures in D&D; could help make players feel important in their campaign.\\"  Other media  Drizzt Do'Urden has been featured in several accessories and one book for the Advanced Dungeons & Dragons fantasy role-playing game. The Hall of Heroes accessory for the second edition of Advanced Dungeons & Dragons, published in 1989, features a four-page description and game statistics for Drizzt and Guenhwyvar, written by R. A.

Drizzt has also appeared in a number of graphic novels and video games, and as a miniature figure. Beginning in 2005, Devil's Due Publishing began releasing comic book adaptations of the Drizzt novels, covering each book in a three-issue mini-series along with a trade paperback collection. To date, Homeland, Exile, Sojourn, The Crystal Shard, Streams of Silver, The Halfling's Gem, The Legacy, and Starless Night have been released. The character has appeared in several video games. He is part of the story and a party member in the 1994 SSI game for PC Menzoberranzan. In Forgotten Realms: Demon Stone he is a playable character in the game's seventh stage, described by a writer for Imagine Games Network (IGN) as \\"cool but utterly ineffective.\\" Drizzt appears in Baldur's Gate fighting some gnolls; it is possible for a skilled player to kill him or pickpocket his items, and a friendly or hostile version of Drizzt can be spawned with a cheat code. Drizzt also appears in the sequel Baldur's Gate II and will react negatively if the player has imported characters from the first game that killed Drizzt or have any of his unique items. He will also react negatively to any elven character with a low reputation with the same name, challenging them to a duel of honor. He is also an unlockable playable character in Baldur's Gate: Dark Alliance and Baldur's Gate: Dark Alliance II. Drizzt is also included in the Dungeons and Dragons Miniatures game, in the Legend of Drizzt Scenario Pack that also includes Wulfgar and the dragon Icingdeath. An enclosed booklet lets players recreate the battle between Drizzt, Wulfgar, and the dragon. The boxed set was nominated for Best Miniature Product at the 2008 ENnies. Drizzt made a brief cameo in the 2011 one-off comic Unit:E, produced by Hasbro as a potential concept for crossing over many of the franchises they owned; he is seen in a splash page amongst many other Hasbro-owned characters (including characters from G.I. Joe, Transformers, M.A.S.K., Jem and the Holograms, Micronauts, Action Man, Battleship Galaxies, and even Candy Land), as summoned for Micronauts characters Biotron and Acroyear by the alien AI Synergy (a reimagined version of the AI from Jem). Drizzt features prominently in the D&D; Adventure System Cooperative Play board game The Legend of Drizzt, released October 18, 2011. Drizzt has also been seen in the game Neverwinter Online by Cryptic Studios. He appears as part of the Neverwinter: Underdark expansion that allows players to travel to the drow city of Menzoberranzan and play several quests written by R.A. Salvatore.

Introduced in February 2001, it advanced the GeForce architecture by adding programmable pixel and vertex shaders, multisample anti-aliasing and improved the overall efficiency of the rendering process. The GeForce 3 was unveiled during the 2001 Macworld Conference & Expo/Tokyo 2001 in Makuhari Messe and powered realtime demos of Pixar's Junior Lamp and id Software's Doom 3. Apple would later announce launch rights for its new line of computers. The GeForce 3 family comprises 3 consumer models: the GeForce 3, the GeForce 3 Ti200, and the GeForce 3 Ti500. A separate professional version, with a feature-set tailored for computer aided design, was sold as the Quadro DCC. A derivative of the GeForce 3, known as the NV2A, is used in the Microsoft Xbox game console. Architecture GeForce3 Ti 200 GPU Introduced three months after NVIDIA acquired 3dfx and marketed as the nFinite FX Engine, the GeForce 3 was the first Microsoft Direct3D 8.0 compliant 3D-card. Its programmable shader architecture enabled applications to execute custom visual effects programs in Microsoft Shader language 1.1. It is believed that the fixed-function T&L; hardware from GeForce 2 was still included on the chip for use with Direct3D 7.0 applications, as the single vertex shader was not fast enough to emulate it yet.https://paroj.github.io/gltut/History%20Radeon8500.html With respect to pure pixel and texel throughput, the GeForce 3 has four pixel pipelines which each can sample two textures per clock. This is the same configuration as GeForce 2, excluding the slower GeForce 2 MX line. To take better advantage of available memory performance, the GeForce 3 has a memory subsystem dubbed Lightspeed Memory Architecture (LMA). This is composed of several mechanisms that reduce overdraw, conserve memory bandwidth by compressing the z-buffer (depth buffer) and better manage interaction with the DRAM. Other architectural changes include EMBM supporthttp://ixbtlabs.com/articles/digest3d/0402/itogi-video- gf3.htmlhttps://www.nvidia.com/object/geforce3_faq.html (first introduced by Matrox in 1999) and improvements to anti-aliasing functionality. Previous GeForce chips could perform only super-sampled anti-aliasing (SSAA), a demanding process that renders the image at a large size internally and then scales it down to the end output resolution. GeForce 3 adds multi-sampling anti-aliasing (MSAA) and Quincunx anti-aliasing methods, both of which perform significantly better than super-sampling anti-aliasing at the expense of quality. With multi-sampling, the render output units super-sample only the Z buffers and stencil buffers, and using that information get greater geometry detail needed to determine if a pixel covers more than one polygonal object. This saves the pixel/fragment shader from having to render multiple fragments for pixels where the same object covers all of the same sub-pixels in a pixel. This method fails with texture maps which have varying transparency (e.g. a texture map that represents a chain link fence). Quincunx anti-aliasing is a blur filter that shifts the rendered image a half-pixel up and a half-pixel left in order to create sub-pixels which are then averaged together in a diagonal cross pattern, destroying both jagged edges but also some overall image detail. Finally, the GeForce 3's texture sampling units were upgraded to support 8-tap anisotropic filtering, compared to the previous limit of 2-tap with GeForce 2. With 8-tap anisotropic filtering enabled, distant textures can be noticeably sharper. Performance The GeForce 3 GPU (NV20) has the same theoretical pixel and texel throughput per clock as the GeForce 2 (NV15). GeForce 2 Ultra is clocked 25% faster than the original GeForce 3 and 43% faster than the Ti200; this means that in select instances, like Direct3D 7 T&L; benchmarks, the GeForce 2 Ultra and sometimes even GTS can outperform the GeForce 3 and Ti200, because the newer GPUs use the same fixed-function T&L; unit, but are clocked lower. The GeForce 2 Ultra also has considerable raw memory bandwidth available to it, only matched by the GeForce 3 Ti500. However, when comparing anti-aliasing performance the GeForce 3 is clearly superior because of its MSAA support and memory bandwidth/fillrate management efficiency. When comparing the shading capabilities to the Radeon 8500, reviewers noted superior precision with the ATi card. Product positioning NVIDIA refreshed the lineup in October 2001 with the release of the GeForce 3 Ti200 and Ti500. This coincided with ATI's releases of the Radeon 8500 and Radeon 7500. The Ti500 has higher core and memory clocks (240 MHz core/250 MHz RAM) than the original GeForce 3 (200 MHz/230 MHz), and generally matches the Radeon 8500. The Ti200 was the slowest, and lowest-priced GeForce3 release. It is clocked lower (175 MHz/200 MHz) yet it surpasses the Radeon 7500 in speed and feature set besides dual-monitor implementation. The original GeForce3 was only released in 64 MiB configurations, while the Ti200 and Ti500 were also released as 128 MiB versions.

Random House Webster's Unabridged Dictionary. born Edmund Preston Biden; August 29, 1898 ‚Äì August 6, 1959) was an American playwright, screenwriter, and film director. In 1941, he won the Oscar for Best Original Screenplay for the film The Great McGinty, his first of three nominations in the category. Sturges took the screwball comedy format of the 1930s to another level, writing dialogue that, heard today, is often surprisingly naturalistic, mature, and ahead of its time, despite the farcical situations. It is not uncommon for a Sturges character to deliver an exquisitely turned phrase and take an elaborate pratfall within the same scene. Prior to Sturges, other figures in Hollywood (such as Charlie Chaplin, D. W. Griffith, and Frank Capra) had directed films from their own scripts, however Sturges is often regarded as the first Hollywood figure to establish success as a screenwriter and then move into directing his own scripts, at a time when those roles were separate. Sturges famously sold the story for The Great McGinty to Paramount Pictures for $1, in return for being allowed to direct the film. Early life Sturges was born in Chicago, Illinois, the son of Mary Estelle Dempsey (later known as Mary Desti or Mary D'Este) and travelling salesman Edmund C. Biden. His maternal grandparents, Catherine Campbell Smyth and Dominick d'Este Dempsey, were immigrants from Ireland, and his father was of English descent. When Sturges was three years old, his eccentric mother left America to pursue a singing career in Paris, where she annulled her marriage with Preston's father. Returning to America, Dempsey met her third husband, the wealthy stockbroker Solomon Sturges, who adopted Preston in 1902. According to biographers, Solomon Sturges was \\"diametrically opposite to Mary and her bohemianism\\". This included her close friendship with Isadora Duncan, as the young Sturges would sometimes travel from country to country with Duncan's dance company. Mary also carried on a romantic affair with Aleister Crowley and collaborated with him on his magnum opus Magick. As a young man, Sturges bounced back and forth between Europe and the United States. As Sturges spent much of his childhood and youth in France, he ended up fluent in French and a Francophile who always considered France his \\"second home\\".Viviani, Christiana \\"Hail the Conquering Autuer: Preston Sturges in La Revue de cin√©ma\\" pages 280-292 from ReFocus: The Films of Preston Sturges edited by Jeff Jaeckle, Edinburgh: Edinburgh University Press, 2015 pages 280-281 In 1916, he worked as a runner for New York stock brokers, a position he obtained through Solomon Sturges. The next year, he enlisted in the United States Army Air Service, and graduated as a lieutenant from Camp Dick in Texas without seeing action. While at camp, Sturges wrote an essay, \\"Three Hundred Words of Humor\\", which was printed in the camp newspaper, becoming his first published work. Returning from camp, Sturges picked up a managing position at the Desti Emporium in New York, a store owned by his mother's fourth husband. He spent eight years (1919‚Äì1927) there, until he married the first of his four wives, Estelle De Wolfe. Career =From Broadway to Hollywood= In 1928, Sturges performed on Broadway in Hotbed, a short-lived play by Paul Osborn, and Sturges' first produced play, The Guinea Pig, opened in Massachusetts. The play was a success and Sturges moved it to Broadway the following year, a turning point in his career. That same year also saw the opening of Sturges' second play, the hit Strictly Dishonorable. Written in just six days, the play ran for sixteen months and earned Sturges over $300,000, a staggering amount at the time. It attracted interest from Hollywood, and Sturges was writing for Paramount by the end of the year. Barbara Stanwyck in The Lady Eve (1941) Three other Sturges stage plays were produced from 1930 to 1932, one of them a musical, but none of them were hits. By the end of the year, he was working more in Hollywood as a writer-for-hire, operating on short contracts, for Universal, MGM, and Columbia studios. He also sold his original screenplay for The Power and the Glory (1933) to Fox, where it was filmed as a vehicle for Spencer Tracy. The film told the story of a self-involved financier via a series of flashbacks and flashforwards, and was an acknowledged source of inspiration for the screenwriters of Citizen Kane. Fox producer Jesse Lasky had been prepared to customarily pass Sturges' screenplay along to other writers for rewriting, but said, \\"It was the most perfect script I'd ever seen ... Imagine a producer accepting a script from an author and not being able to make one change.\\" Lasky paid Sturges $17,500 plus 7% of the profits above $1 million. It was a then-unprecedented deal for a screenwriter, which instantly elevated Sturges' reputation in Hollywood ‚Äì although the lucrative deal irritated as many as it impressed. Sturges later recalled, \\"The film made a lot of enemies. Writers at that time worked in teams, like piano movers. And my first solo script was considered a distinct menace to the profession.\\" For the remainder of the 1930s, Sturges operated under the strict auspices of the studio system, working on a string of scripts, some of which were shelved, sometimes with screen credit and sometimes not. While he was highly paid, earning $2,500 a week, he was unhappy with the way directors were handling his dialogue, and he resolved to take creative control of his own projects. He accomplished this goal in 1939 by trading his screenplay for The Great McGinty (written six years earlier) to Paramount in exchange for the chance to direct it. Paramount promoted the unusual deal as part of the film's publicity, claiming that Sturges had received just one dollar (in reality, he was paid $10 for legal reasons). Sturges' success quickly paved the way for similar deals for such writer-directors as Billy Wilder and John Huston. Sturges said, \\"It's taken me eight years to reach what I wanted. But now, if I don't run out of ideas ‚Äì and I won't ‚Äì we'll have some fun. There are some wonderful pictures to be made, and God willing, I will make some of them.\\" =Screenwriting heights= Sturges won the first-ever Academy Award for Writing Original Screenplay for The Great McGinty. He also received two screenwriting Academy Award nominations in the same year, for 1944's Hail the Conquering Hero and The Miracle of Morgan's Creek, a feat since matched by Frank Butler, Francis Ford Coppola, and Oliver Stone. (In the second Academy Awards, under a different nomination process, eleven screenplays were considered, including two by Bess Meredyth, two by Tom Barry, two by Hanns Kr√§ly and four by Elliott J. Clawson.) Though he had a thirty-year Hollywood career, Sturges' greatest comedies were filmed in a furious five-year burst of activity from 1939 to 1944, during which he turned out The Great McGinty, Christmas in July, The Lady Eve, Sullivan's Travels, The Palm Beach Story, The Miracle of Morgan's Creek and Hail the Conquering Hero. Half a century later, four of these ‚Äì The Lady Eve, Sullivan's Travels, The Palm Beach Story and The Miracle of Morgan's Creek ‚Äì were chosen by the American Film Institute as being among the 100 funniest American films. The film critic Ephraim Katz wrote that Sturges films \\"...parodied with pungent wit various aspects of American life from politics and advertising to sex and hero worship. They were marked by their verbal wit, opportune comic timing, and eccentric, outrageously funny camo characterizations.\\"Katz, Ephraim The Film Encyclopedia, New York:Harper & Row, 1979 page 1107. Film critic Andrew Sarris wrote, \\"Sturges repeatedly suggested that the lowliest boob could rise to the top with the right degree of luck, bluff, and fraud.\\"Sarris, Andrew (1968) The American Cinema: Directors and Directions 1929-1968 New York: Dutton Publishing. . p.113 Critic Andrew Dickos wrote that \\"the touchstone of Preston Sturges' screenwriting lies in the respect paid to the play and density of verbal language\\" and \\"establishes the standard of eloquence as one of poetry, of a cacophony of Euro-American vernacularisms and utterances, peculiarly‚Äîand appropriately‚Äîspoken with scandalous indifference.\\"Dickos, Andrew. Intrepid Laughter: Preston Sturges and the Movies, 55‚Äì56 Sturges' rich writing style has been described as that of \\"a lowbrow aristocrat, a melancholy wiseguy.\\" His scripts were almost congenitally unable to deliver a single mood. In Hail the Conquering Hero, the series of lies, crimes, and embarrassments all somehow bolster the film's theme of patriotism and duty. Sometimes this attitude could be conveyed in a single line of dialogue, such as when Barbara Stanwyck describes the man of her dreams with a combination of love and malice: \\"I need him like the axe needs the turkey.\\" In recent years, film scholars such as Alessandro Pirolini have also argued that Sturges' cinema anticipated more experimental narratives by contemporary directors such as Joel and Ethan Coen, Robert Zemeckis, and Woody Allen, along with prolific The Simpsons writer John Swartzwelder: \\"Many of [Sturges'] movies and screenplays reveal a restless and impatient attempt to escape codified rules and narrative schemata, and to push the mechanisms and conventions of their genre to the extent of unveiling them to the spectator. See for example the disruption of standardized timelines in films such as The Power and the Glory and The Great McGinty or the way an apparently classical comedy such as Unfaithfully Yours (1948) shifts into the realm of multiple and hypothetical narratives.\\"Pirolini, Alessandro. The Cinema of Preston Sturges: A Critical Study, McFarland & Co., 2010. In 1942, in his review of The Palm Beach Story, critic Manny Farber wrote: > He is essentially a satirist without any stable point of view from which to > aim his satire.

Farber on Film New York: Library of > America, 2009. p.41 =Studio battles= Production on these films did not always go smoothly. The Miracle of Morgan's Creek was literally being written by Sturges at night even as the production was being filmed in the daytime, and Sturges the screenwriter was rarely more than 10 pages ahead of the cast and crew. Despite box office success for The Lady Eve and The Miracle of Morgan's Creek, conflict with Paramount's studio bosses increased. In particular, executive producer Buddy DeSylva never really trusted his star writer-director and was wary (and arguably jealous) of the independence Sturges enjoyed on his projects. One of the sources of conflict was that Sturges liked to reuse many of the same character actors in his films, thus creating what amounted to a regular troupe he could call upon within the studio system. Paramount feared that the audience would tire of repeatedly seeing the same faces in Sturges productions. But the director was adamant, stating, \\"[T]hese little players who had contributed so much to my first hits had a moral right to work in my subsequent pictures.\\"Frankel, Mark \\"Hail the Conquering Hero\\" (TCM article) The way Sturges wrote and directed these actors created a succession of what film critic Andrew Sarris later called \\"self-expressive cameos of aggressive individualism.\\" Veronica Lake and Joel McCrea in Sullivan's Travels (1941) Members of Sturges' unofficial \\"stock company\\" included: George Anderson, Al Bridge, Georgia Caine, Chester Conklin, Jimmy Conlin, William Demarest,Demarest appeared in ten films written by Sturges, eight of which he also directed: Diamond Jim (1935), Easy Living (1937), The Great McGinty (1940), Christmas in July (1940), The Lady Eve (1941), Sullivan's Travels (1941), The Palm Beach Story (1942), The Miracle of Morgan's Creek (1944), Hail the Conquering Hero (1944) and The Great Moment (1944) Robert Dudley, Byron Foulger, Robert Greig, Harry Hayden, Esther Howard, Arthur Hoyt, J. Farrell MacDonald, George Melford, Torben Meyer, Charles R. Moore, Frank Moran, Jack Norton, Franklin Pangborn, Emory Parnell, Victor Potel, Dewey Robinson, Harry Rosenthal, Julius Tannen, Max Wagner and Robert Warwick. In addition, Sturges re-used other actors, such as Sig Arno, Luis Alberni, Eric Blore, Porter Hall and Raymond Walburn, and even stars such as Joel McCrea and Rudy Vallee, who both made three films with Sturges, and Eddie Bracken, who did two. The prolonged clashes between Sturges and Paramount came to a head as the end of his contract approached. He had filmed The Great Moment and The Miracle of Morgan's Creek in 1942 and Hail the Conquering Hero in 1943, but Paramount was suffering from a surfeit of films. Indeed, some of the studio's finished movies were sold off to United Artists, which needed films to distribute.This included a film Sturges was involved with as producer, I Married A Witch. The studio held onto Sturges' three films, since he was their star filmmaker at the time, but did not immediately release them. Internally, studio heads expressed serious reservations about them, as did the censors at the Breen Office. Sturges managed to get The Miracle of Morgan's Creek released with only minor changes, but The Great Moment and Hail the Conquering Hero were taken out of his control and tinkered with by DeSylva. When the revamped Hail the Conquering Hero had a disastrous preview, Paramount allowed Sturges ‚Äì who by that time had left the studio ‚Äì to come back and fix the film. Sturges did some rewriting, shot some new scenes, and re-edited the film back to his original vision, all without pay. He was unable to similarly rescue The Great Moment, however. The historical biography about the dentist who discovered the use of ether for anesthesia ended up being Sturges' only flop during this period. More significantly, it marked the onset of a downturn from which Sturges did not fully recover.Katz, Ephraim (1979) The Film Encyclopedia, New York:Harper & Row. p.1107 =Independence and decline= Sturges was a temperamental talent who fully recognized his own worth. He had invested in entrepreneurial projects such as an engineering company and The Players, a popular restaurant and nightclub at 8225 Sunset Boulevard, which were both net losses. At one point the third highest paid man in America ‚Äì for writing, directing, producing, and numerous other Hollywood projects ‚Äì he was often known to borrow money (from his stepfather and studio, amongst others). Rudy Vallee, Claudette Colbert in The Palm Beach Story (1942) Millionaire Howard Hughes, who had formed a friendship with Sturges, offered to bankroll him as an independent filmmaker. In early 1944, Sturges and Hughes formed a partnership called California Pictures. The deal represented a major pay cut for Sturges, but it established him as a writer-producer-director, the only one in Hollywood besides Charles Chaplin and one of only four in the world, along with England's No√´l Coward and France's Ren√© Clair. The status led, again, to widespread admiration and envy among his Hollywood peers. However, this career peak also marked the beginning of Sturges' professional decline as Hughes proved an unstable and mercurial partner. While the startup California Pictures was being created and structured, it was three years until Sturges' next release. That film, a Harold Lloyd vehicle entitled The Sin of Harold Diddlebock (1947), for which Sturges had coaxed the silent film icon out of retirement, went over budget and far behind schedule, and was poorly received when it was released. Hughes, who had promised not to interfere in the film's production, stepped in and pulled the movie from distribution in order to re- edit it, taking almost four years to do so. Released in 1950 by RKO, which was by that time owned by Hughes, the retitled Mad Wednesday was no more successful than Sturges' original version. In the meantime, California Pictures had put another film into production, Vendetta. At Hughes' behest, Sturges had written the script as a vehicle for Hughes' prot√©g√©, Faith Domergue. Max Oph√ºls was hired to direct, but after only a few days of filming, Hughes demanded that Sturges fire Oph√ºls and take over the direction himself. Seven weeks later, Sturges himself was fired or quit (accounts differ). The promising partnership between the two iconoclasts was dissolved after just one completed picture. As Sturges later recalled, \\"When Mr. Hughes made suggestions with which I disagreed, as he had a perfect right to do, I rejected them. When I rejected the last one, he remembered he had an option to take control of the company and he took over. So I left.\\" Coming on the heels of the failure of The Great Moment, these further flops, disappointments and setbacks served to tarnish the once stellar reputation of the golden boy of Hollywood. Sturges was left professionally adrift. Accepting an offer from Darryl Zanuck, he landed at Fox where he wrote, directed, and produced two films. The first, Unfaithfully Yours (1948), was not initially well received by either reviewers or the public, though its critical reputation has since improved. However, his second Fox film, The Beautiful Blonde from Bashful Bend (1949), was the first serious flop in star Betty Grable's career, and Sturges was again on his own. He built a theater at his Players restaurant, but the project did not pan out. Over the next several years, Sturges continued to write, but many of the projects were underfunded or stillborn, and those that emerged did not approach the same success as his earlier triumphs. His 1951 Broadway musical, Make a Wish, underwent extensive rewriting by Abe Burrows and ran for only a few months. His next Broadway project, Carnival in Flanders, a musical which Sturges wrote and directed in 1953, closed after six performances. Akim Tamiroff, Muriel Angelus and Brian Donlevy in The Great McGinty (1940) Sturges was having no better luck in Hollywood, where his clout was gone. Katharine Hepburn, who had starred in the 1952 Broadway production of the George Bernard Shaw play, The Millionairess got Sturges to agree to adapt the script and direct. But she could not get a single Hollywood studio to back the project. A 1953 lien by the Internal Revenue Service, with whom he had been having tax problems, cost Sturges the Players and other assets. Sturges put a brave public face on the situation, writing, \\"I had so very much for so very long, it is quite natural for the pendulum to swing the other way for a while, and I really cannot and will not complain.\\" However, his drinking became heavy, and his marriage and many of his relationships continued to deteriorate. Sturges began spending more time in Europe, as he had as a young man. His last directorial effort took place there when he wrote and directed Les Carnets du Major Thompson, an adaptation of a popular French novel. The film was released in France in 1955 and two years later in the U.S., under the title The French, They Are a Funny Race. It failed to register with critics or the audience. Sturges made four brief onscreen appearances during his career: in two of his own films - Christmas in July and Sullivan's Travels - in the Paramount all-star extravaganza Star Spangled Rhythm, and, in the years of his decline, in the Bob Hope comedy Paris Holiday, which was filmed in France and would be the last film he worked on.American Film Institute \\"Preston Sturges: Actor\\" AFI Film Catalog Two decades earlier, Sturges had been a writer on one of Hope's earliest film successes, Never Say Die. In 1959, Sturges summed up his career: > Between flops, it is true, I have come up with an occasional hit, but > compared to a good boxer's record, for instance, my percentage has been > lamentable. I fought a draw in my first fight, stupified everyone by winning > the championship in my second, got a couple of wins with picture rights, > then was knocked out three times in a row. Dragging my weary carcass to > Hollywood, I was immediately knocked out again, won a big fight some six > months later, then marked time for six years as an ordinary ham-and-beaner, > picking up what I could. Suddenly I saw a chance and offered to fight for > the world championship for a dollar. To everyone's astonishment, I won that > championship and defended it successfully for a number of years, winning > nine times by knockout, fighting three draws, losing twice and getting one > no-decision in Europe.

Why I'm not walking on my heels after all > this, I don't know. Maybe I am walking on my heels. It would be surprising > if I weren't.Sturges (1990) p. 12 Style and influence Sturges took the screwball comedy format of the 1930s to another level, writing dialogue that, heard today, is often surprisingly naturalistic, mature, and ahead of its time, despite the farcical situations. It is not uncommon for a Sturges character to deliver an exquisitely turned phrase and take an elaborate pratfall within the same scene. For example, in The Lady Eve, a tender love scene takes place between Henry Fonda and Barbara Stanwyck, which is enlivened by a horse as it repeatedly pokes its nose into Fonda's head. John Lasseter cited Sturges as an influence on his work.

It was Sturges's first film as a director; he sold the story to Paramount Pictures for just $10 on condition he direct the film.Spoto, Donald. Madcap: The Life of Preston Sturges. p. 150. Sturges received an Oscar for Best Original Screenplay. For the U.K. release, the film was retitled Down Went McGinty, alluding to the 1889 song. Plot in a scene from the film Dan McGinty (Brian Donlevy) is a bartender in a banana republic who recounts his rise and fall to the bar's dancing girl and an American customer. The customer was a trusted bank employee who can no longer return to the United States and his family because he is wanted by the law after falling to temptation and stealing from the bank. McGinty is in a similar situation, but in his case it is due to \\"one crazy minute\\" of honesty rather than one of dishonesty. In a long flashback, he explains. McGinty's career begins when he is a tramp who, offered a $2 bribe to vote under a false name in a rigged mayoral election, does it thirty-seven times at different precincts. This impresses a local political boss (Akim Tamiroff), whose name is never mentioned; although they sometimes almost come to blows with each other, McGinty becomes one of the boss's enforcers, then his political prot√©g√©. During a public campaign for political reform, the boss, who controls all the political parties in the city, decides to have McGinty elected mayor as a \\"reform\\" candidate. He says a credible candidate must be married, but McGinty has no one he wants to marry. His secretary (Muriel Angelus) then proposes a marriage of convenience, which he accepts. Elected mayor, he continues the political corruption established by the boss, rationalizing that the public still benefits from public works no matter who bribes their way into profiting from them. But then he and his more idealistic wife actually fall in love. He begins to take her views on public service seriously, but says he is not powerful enough to act against the boss in any case. But next the boss decides McGinty should be governor of the state, and McGinty is duly elected. Now he feels he is powerful enough, and on his inauguration day he tells the boss that they're through with each other. The boss says that if he goes down then he'll take McGinty with him by revealing his part in the corruption; but then he becomes angry enough to fire a gun at McGinty inside the governor's mansion, ensuring his prompt arrest. In due course McGinty and the boss find themselves in adjacent jail cells, from which the boss arranges an escape for both. The flashback ends with McGinty providing for his wife and her children by telling her by phone about money he has hidden. We finally see that the former political boss is still his boss at the bar, and that they are still given to violent disagreements. Cast Cast notes: * Both Donlevy and Tamiroff reprised their roles in Sturges's 1944 comedy The Miracle of Morgan's Creek. * This was the first film directed by Preston Sturges, and in it he used many of the actors who became part of his unofficial \\"stock company\\", a troupe of character actors within the studio system. Appearing in McGinty are: George Anderson, Jimmy Conlin, William Demarest, Byron Foulger, Harry Hayden, Esther Howard, Arthur Hoyt, George Melford, Charles R. Moore, Frank Moran, Emory Parnell, Victor Potel, Dewey Robinson, Harry Rosenthal and Robert Warwick. * This was the third film written by Preston Sturges that William Demarest appeared in, after Diamond Jim (1935) and Easy Living (1937), and he would go on to do seven others (see note).Christmas in July (1940), Sullivan's Travels (1941), The Lady Eve (1941), The Palm Beach Story (1942), The Miracle of Morgan's Creek (1944), Hail the Conquering Hero (1944) and The Great Moment (1944). * Jo Ann Sayers was originally scheduled to play Catherine McGinty, and was borrowed from MGM, but she was not found to be satisfactory and was replaced. * Tamiroff's malaprop-laced performance inspired the cartoon character Boris Badenov, on The Rocky and Bullwinkle Show. Sturges used Tamiroff's character to skewer one of Hollywood's hoariest practices when he repeatedly pleads, \\"Don't make me say everything twice, will you?\\" * Heydt had starred in the Broadway production of Sturges's first big success, Strictly Dishonorable (1929). Production The Great McGinty had numerous working titles: \\"The Story of a Man\\", \\"The Vagrant\\", \\"The Mantle of Dignity\\", \\"The Biography of a Bum\\", and \\"Down Went McGinty\\", (which was used for the film's release in the U.K). Sturges had written the original story, \\"The Story of a Man\\", in 1933 with Spencer Tracy in mind. According to film historian Kevin Brownlow, Sturges was inspired by the career of William Sulzer, who was impeached and removed from office as governor of New York. After trying to sell the story to Universal in 1935, and the Saturday Evening Post in 1938 under the title Biography of a Bum, Sturges finally sold it to Paramount on August 19, 1939 for $10 on the condition that he be allowed to direct it.TCM Notes Paramount agreed, and provided Sturges a budget of $350,000, a three-week shooting schedule,Feaster, Felicia \\"The Great McGinty\\" (TCM article) and inexpensive stars to work with.Erickson, Hal Plot synopsis (Allmovie) Production on the film was delayed to allow Akim Tamiroff to do The Way of All Flesh, but it began on December 15, 1939. Sturges contracted pneumonia during filming, and required a nurse to attend to him on the set. Production stopped on January 25, 1940 with one day's shooting left to do, which was accomplished on April 15, after the first cut of the film had already been made. Release The Great McGinty premiered in New York City on August 15, 1940, and was generally released on August 23.IMDB Release dates The movie was not a large hit but was profitable.James Curtis, Between Flops: A Biography of Preston Sturges, Limelight, 1984 p135 It was released on video in the U.S. on April 7, 1988, and re-released on June 30, 1993. Adaptations Brian Donlevy appeared in a Philip Morris Playhouse radio adaptation January 23, 1942, on the CBS radio network, the August 27, 1945 episode of The Screen Guild Theater and in the April 20, 1946 episode of Academy Award Theater. It was also adapted to the October 12, 1947 episode of the Ford Theatre and a May 11, 1952 Screen Guild Theater starring Broderick Crawford. Donlevy also appeared in a television adaptation on Lux Video Theatre, broadcast on 28 April 1955, with Thomas Gomez and Jesse White. The director was Earl Eby and Preston Sturges' screenplay was adapted by S.H. Barnett.

The bag tag attached to the handle enabled the baggage handlers to load the baggage onto the correct aircraft. Checked baggage is luggage delivered to an airline or train for transportation in the hold of an aircraft or baggage car of a passenger train. Checked baggage is inaccessible to the passenger during the flight or ride, as opposed to carry-on baggage. This baggage is limited by airlines with regard to size, weight, and number, usually dependent upon the fare paid, or class of ticket. Baggage exceeding the limits is regarded as excess baggage. Checked baggage on airlines =Checked baggage policies= Every airline has its own policies with regard to baggage allowance. Often the policy is also dependent on where the flight goes to or comes from. Tickets executed by multiple airlines may have different rules. Usually the exact conditions of a specific booking are mentioned in the ticket information online. On short-haul internal flights in the US, with some exceptions, checked baggage is no longer complimentary with most discounted economy tickets, and must be paid for in addition to the ticket price; a passenger generally has to hold a higher or full fare economy ticket, travel in a premium cabin, or hold elite status on an airline to be afforded complimentary checked baggage. For long-haul and transoceanic flights, checked baggage is included as standard. Low-cost carriers such as Ryanair in Europe and AirAsia in Asia charge for checked baggage, whilst for full-service airlines the cost is included in the ticket price. =Passenger-baggage reconciliation= According to the rules of most air transportation authorities, such as the U.S. Federal Aviation Administration and European Union's Joint Aviation Authorities, should passengers flying internationally with checked baggage fail to arrive at the departure gate before the flight is closed, that person's baggage must be retrieved from the aircraft hold before the flight is permitted to take off. For Singapore, passengers with prohibited items are required to take it out from the bags retrieved at the check-in counter, failing which the baggage will be flagged with prohibited items and will be dumped away before boarding. In the United States, this does not apply to domestic flights since all bags are required to go through explosive detection machines (EDS) prior to loading. Making sure passengers board flights onto which they have checked baggage is called \\"passenger-baggage reconciliation\\" and is accomplished automatically through two commercially available systems. The security presumption of passenger-baggage reconciliation is that terrorists will not want to kill themselves, and will not board an aircraft if they have caused a bomb to be placed in its hold. This presumption does not hold true of suicide bombers. Unaccompanied suitcases led to the downing of four flights, when a bomb inside the suitcase exploded: *1983: Gulf Air Flight 771 *1985: Air India Flight 182 *1988: Pan Am Flight 103 *1989: UTA Flight 772 Restrictions Spare lithium-ion batteries, inclusive of battery packs and powerbanks are not allowed on checked-in luggage. Excess baggage Excess baggage is the amount of baggage that is in excess of the free allowance in size, number, or weight permitted for the journey. At the carrier's discretion, this may be carried at an extra charge, but no guarantee is made and it may have to be sent as freight instead. Some airlines impose excess baggage embargoes on certain (usually smaller) routes, indicating that they will accept no (or very little) excess baggage.

Life Very little is known about the early life of Bonelli: he was born in Cuneo and was interested from an early age in the fauna which surrounded him, making collecting trips, preparing specimens and noting his observations. He became a member of the Reale Societ√† Agraria di Torino in 1807 when he presented his first studies relating to the Coleoptera of Piedmont. The high quality of these studies attracted the interest of the naturalists of his time. In April 1810, George Vat was sent to Turin by the French government to reorganize the University of Turin and begin its fusion with the Imp√©riale University founded by Napoleon. Vat was very impressed by Bonelli's knowledge. Vat encouraged him to further his knowledge by coming to follow courses at the Natural History Museum in Paris. Bonelli's warbler is named after Franco Andrea Bonelli Bonelli took this advice so as obtain a professor's chair in the new university. In September 1810, he arrived in Paris. In 1811, Bonelli was finally named professor of zoology at the University of Turin and keeper of the natural history museum of zoology. During his time at the university, he formed one of the largest ornithological collections in Europe. In 1811, Bonelli wrote a Catalogue of the Birds of Piedmont, in which he described 262 species. In 1815, he discovered the bird Bonelli's warbler (Phylloscopus bonelli), named by Louis Vieillot in 1819. In the same year, he discovered Bonelli's eagle (Hieraaetus fasciatus) that was likewise named by Vieillot in 1822. The successor of Bonelli at the Turin Museum was Carlo Giuseppe Gen√©. Achievements Bonelli is most notable for his work on birds and on the beetle family Carabidae. Since he was an early worker on Coleoptera many of his genera later became Families, sub families and tribes. Also many of his genera survive.

The term explication is used in both analytic philosophy and literary criticism.  Carnap's notion of explication  = Summary = In analytic philosophy, the concept of explication was first developed by Rudolf Carnap. Explication can be regarded as a scientific process which transforms and replaces \\"an inexact prescientific concept\\" (which Carnap calls the explicandum), with a \\"new exact concept\\" (which he calls the explicatum). A description and explanation of the nature and impact of the new explicit knowledge is usually called an \\"explication\\". The new explicit knowledge draws on, and is an improvement upon, previous knowledge. = On explication and truth = An explication in the Carnapian sense is purely stipulative, and thus a subclass of normative definitions. Hence, an explication can not be true or false, just more or less suitable for its purpose. (Cf. Rorty's argument about the purpose and value of philosophy in Rorty (2003), \\"A pragmatist view of contemporary analytic philosophy\\", in Egginton, W. and Sandbothe, M. (Eds), The Pragmatic Turn in Philosophy, SUNY Press, New York, NY.) Examples of inexact daily life concepts in need of explication are our concepts of cause and of conditionals. Our daily life concept of cause does not distinguish between necessary causes, sufficient causes, complete causes etc. Each of these more precise concepts is an explication of our natural concept of cause. Natural language will only specify truth conditions for propositions of the form \\"If p, then q\\" for situations where \\"p\\" is true. (Most of us probably don't have any clear intuitions regarding the truth conditions of the sentence \\"If I go out in the sun, I will get sunburned\\" in situations where I never go out in the sun.) An explication of the conditional will also specify truth conditions for situations where \\"p\\" is not true. = Reviews of Carnap's argument = Carnap's argument provides a helpful foundation in understanding and clarifying the nature and value of explication in defining and describing \\"new\\" knowledge. Others' reviews of Carnap's argument offer additional insights about the nature of explication. In particular, Bonolio's paper (2003) \\"Kant‚Äôs Explication and Carnap‚Äôs Explication: The Redde Rationem\\", and Maher's (2007) \\"Explication defended\\", add weight to the argument that explication is an appropriate methodology for formal philosophy.  Explication as a process versus explication as an outcome  When working with explication, it is essential to be clear, and to make clear whether you are dealing with the explication process (and hence working with the verb or gerund), or dealing with the outcomes of the process, such as a work which documents, describes and explains the new explicit knowledge.  Semantic explication  In the natural semantic metalanguage theory, explications are semantic representations of vocabulary. These explications are made up of a very limited set of words called semantic primes which are considered to have universal meaning across all languages. An example of an explication of the word happy: X feels happy = sometimes someone thinks something like this: something good happened to something I wanted this I don't want other things now because of this, someone feels something good X feels like this What sets the Natural Semantic Metalanguage Theory's explications apart from previous theories, is that these explications can fit into natural language, even if it sounds very awkward. For example: The clown looks [happy] The clown looks like [the clown thinks something like this: 'something good happened to me; I wanted this; I don't want other things now'; because of this, the clown feels something good]. Explications in the Natural Semantic Metalanguage are neither exact dictionary definitions, nor encyclopedic explanations of a concept. They often differ slightly depending upon the personal experiences of the person writing them. In this way, they can be said to \\"rely heavily on 'folk theories,' that is, the rather naive understandings that most of us have about how life, the universe, and everything work.\\" Explications of abstract concepts, such as color, do not list any scientific facts about the object or concrete definitions. Instead, the explications use comparisons and examples from the real world.  Explication, explication de texte, and literary criticism  The terms explication and explication de texte have different meanings. As argued by Carnap (1950), in science and philosophy, \\"explication consists in transforming a given more or less inexact concept into an exact one or, rather, in replacing the first by the second. We call the given concept (or the term used for it) the explicandum, and the exact concept proposed to take the place of the first (or the term proposed for it) the explicatum. The explicandum may belong to everyday language or to a previous stage in the development of scientific language. The explicatum must be given by explicit rules for its use, for example, by a definition which incorporates it into a well-constructed system of scientific either logicomathematical or empirical concepts.\\" In this context, 'explication' is now regarded as \\"an appropriate methodology for formal philosophy\\". (Maher, 2007). By contrast, in literary criticism, the term 'explication' is used as a proxy for the term explication de texte, where additional understandings and meanings are derived from the \\"close reading\\" of (say) a poem, novel or play. In this process, explication often involves a line-by-line or episode-by-episode commentary on what is going on in a text. While initially this might seem reasonably innocuous, explication de texte, and explication per se, is an interpretative process where the resulting new knowledge, new insights or new meanings, are open to subsequent debate and disaffirmation by others.

The primate of the church is called President Bishop and represents the Church at the international Anglican Communion Primates' Meetings. The Central Synod of the church is its deliberative and legislative organ. The province consists of three dioceses: * Diocese of Jerusalem ‚Äî covering Israel, Palestinian territories, Jordan, Syria and Lebanon, * Diocese of Cyprus and the Gulf ‚Äî covering Cyprus, the Arabian peninsula and Iraq, * Diocese of Iran. A fourth diocese (Egypt with North Africa and the Horn of Africa) was part of the province until June 2020. In 2019 the synod of the province had agreed to allow the Diocese of Egypt to withdraw, in order to become an autonomous province, with the other three existing dioceses remaining as the Province of Jerusalem and the Middle East. This was put into effect on 29 June 2020, with the creation of the Province of Alexandria. Each diocese is headed by a bishop. The President Bishop (Primate, or Archbishop) is chosen from among the diocesan bishops, and retains diocesan responsibility. The President Bishop, Michael Lewis since 2019, also serves as Bishop of Cyprus and the Gulf. The province estimates that it has around 35,000 baptized members in 55 congregations. The province has around 40 educational or medical establishments and 90 clergy. History =Nineteenth century= The Episcopal Church in Jerusalem and the Middle East began as a number of missionary posts of the Church Mission Society (CMS) in Cyprus, the Middle East and the Persia. The Church Mission Society continues to provide the province with lay mission partners and ordained chaplains, but now the majority of its ministry is drawn from local congregations. During the 1820s, CMS began to prepare for permanent missionary stations in the region. In 1833, a missionary station was established in Jerusalem with the support of the London Society for Promoting Christianity Amongst the Jews (a Jewish Christian missionary society now known as the Church's Ministry Among Jewish People or CMJ). In 1839, the building of the Church of Saint Mark, Alexandria was begun. In 1841, Michael Solomon Alexander, a converted rabbi, arrived in Jerusalem as bishop. His diocese originally covered the mission stations in the Middle East and Egypt, and was a joint venture with the Evangelical Church in Prussia (the so-called Anglo-Prussian Union), serving Lutherans and Anglicans. In 1849, Christ Church, Jerusalem, became the first Anglican church in Jerusalem. In the 1860's The Church of the Good Shepherd, Salt in modern Jordan had its origins in the work of a local Arab grain merchant and colporteur from Nablus who started bible studies under a tree. At the time Salt, Jordan was a major Ottoman regional city east of the river Jordan in the Levant. In 1871, Christ Church, Nazareth was consecrated by Bishop Samuel Gobat, and the first Arab Anglicans were ordained. In 1881, the Anglo-Prussian Union ceased to function, and it was formally dissolved in 1887. From that time, the diocese became solely Anglican. In 1888, Bishop George Blyth founded the Jerusalem and the East Mission, which would help raise funds for missions throughout the Middle East. Saint George's Cathedral was built in 1898 in Jerusalem as a central focus for the diocese. =Twentieth century= Although the Diocese of Jerusalem and the Middle East began as a foreign missionary organisation, it quickly established itself as part of the local, especially Palestinian community. In 1905, the Palestinian Native Church Council was established to give Palestinians more say in the running of the church. This led to an increase in the number of Palestinian and Arab clergy serving the diocese. In 1920, the Diocese of Egypt and the Sudan was formed, separate from the Diocese of Jerusalem, with Llewelyn Gwynne as its first bishop. In the 1920s the Bishop founded St. George's College as a seminary for local clergy-in- training. Bishop Gwynne established the second cathedral of All Saints', Cairo (the present cathedral is the third building) in 1938. In 1945, Sudan became a separate diocese from Egypt (see Episcopal Church of the Sudan for its history). In 1957, the See of Jerusalem was elevated to the rank of an archbishopric (its bishop being an archbishop) under the authority of the Archbishop of Canterbury. The Archbishop in Jerusalem had metropolitan oversight of the entire area of the current province with the addition of the Sudan (five dioceses in all). In that same year, Najib Cubain was consecrated Bishop of Jordan, Lebanon and Syria, the first Arab bishop, assistant to the Archbishop in Jerusalem. During the 1950s, political unrest in Egypt left the diocese in the care of four Egyptian clergy under the oversight of the Archbishop in Jerusalem. On 29 August 1974, Faiq Haddad (to become coadjutor bishop in Jerusalem) and Aql Aql (to become Assistant Bishop in the Diocese of Jordan, Lebanon and Syria) were consecrated bishops by Stopford at St George's Cathedral, Jerusalem. An Anglican Bishop of Egypt was appointed in 1968, and, in 1974, the first Egyptian bishop, Ishaq Musaad, was consecrated. In 1976, Faik Hadad became the first Palestinian Anglican bishop in Jerusalem. In 1976, the structure of the Anglican church in the region was overhauled. Jerusalem became an ordinary bishopric and the four dioceses had equal status in the Province of Jerusalem and the Middle East. The Archbishop of Canterbury relinquished his metropolitan authority to a Presiding Bishop and the Central Synod, with the four dioceses rotating the responsibility of the Bishop President and synodical leadership. The central synod includes the four dioceses of the Province of Jerusalem and the Middle East. In Jerusalem when a bishop reaches the age of 68 a coadjutor bishop should be elected to work alongside the bishop for two years. while the Bishops in Egypt and Iran are elected without working alongside the former bishop; and the Bishop of Cyprus and the Gulf was appointed by the Archbishop of Canterbury. Due to the difficult situation in Iran since the 1970's various Bishops or Vicar Generals have been appointed to serve in the position, often residing outside the country. The Diocese of Egypt was expanded to take in the chaplaincies of Ethiopia, Somalia, Libya, Tunisia and Algeria. Sudan became a fully separate and independent province. In 1970, the Cathedral of All Saints in Cairo was demolished to make way for a new Nile bridge. In 1977, work on a new building on Zamalek was begun, and completed in 1988.

Since 2014 the Jerusalem diocese has again become an archbishopric, with its bishop styled \\"Archbishop in Jerusalem\\". This title applies regardless of whether the current bishop is the primate of the province or not, and is a mark of the ambassadorial role of the archbishop in the Holy Land on behalf of the Anglican Communion. The Diocese of Jerusalem covers Israel, the Palestinian territories, Jordan, Syria and Lebanon. The diocesan seat is Cathedral Church of St George the Martyr, Jerusalem. The parish with the largest congregation is the Church of the Redeemer, Amman, Jordan. The cornerstone of the church was laid in 1949, and the church houses both Arabic and English-speaking congregations today.

Platform- specific models are indispensable for the actual implementation of a system. For example, a need to implement an online shop. The system will need to store information regarding users, goods, credit cards, etc. The designer might decide to use for this purpose an Oracle database. For this to work, the designer will need to express concepts (e.g. the concept of a user) in a relational model using the Oracle's SQL dialect. This Oracle's specific relational model is an example of a Platform-specific model. The term platform-specific model is most frequently used in the context of the MDA approach. This MDA approach corresponds the OMG vision of Model Driven Engineering. The main idea is that it should be possible to use a MTL to transform a Platform-independent model into a Platform-specific model. In order to achieve this transformation, one can use a language compliant to the newly defined QVT standard. Examples of such languages are AndroMDA, VIATRA or ATL.

At an early age he was influenced by Anton Menge and became increasingly interested in natural history, and in 1852 he gave up his career and spent two years in the Crimea with the botanist Christian von Steven, collecting both plants and animals. He made further trips to southern Russia with Johann Friedrich von Brandt and Karl Ernst von Baer. He was botanist and zoologist on the East Siberian Expedition of 1855, led by the astronomer Ludwig Schwarz. In 1864 he eventually settled in Tbilisi. In the same year he explored the region surrounding Mount Elbrus, the highest mountain in the Western Palearctic. As well as collecting many plants he recorded the languages, ballads and customs of the local tribes. He set up a museum (the Caucasus Museum) and library in Tbilisi to exhibit his discoveries. His collecting expeditions included visits along the Black Sea coast and eastwards beyond the Caspian Sea to Askhabad. In 1895 he sailed to India and Japan with the Grand Duke Michael, and two years later he was official naturalist on a visit by members of the Russian imperial family to North Africa. He eventually became a member of the Council of State in Tbilisi. In 1884 he was honoured with the chairmanship of the first International Ornithological Congress in Vienna. He was also an honorary member of the Deutsche Ornithologen-Gesellschaft, and a foreign member of the British Ornithologists' Union and the Zoological Society of London.

It provides a set of guidelines for the structuring of specifications, which are expressed as models. Model-driven architecture is a kind of domain engineering, and supports model-driven engineering of software systems. It was launched by the Object Management Group (OMG) in 2001.\\"OMG pursues new strategic direction to build on success of past efforts\\"  Overview  Then, given a platform model corresponding to CORBA, .NET, the Web, etc., the platform independent model (PIM) is translated to one or more platform-specific models (PSMs) that computers can run. This requires mappings and transformations and should be modeled too. The OMG organization provides rough specifications rather than implementations, often as answers to Requests for Proposals (RFPs). Implementations come from private companies or open source groups. = Related standards = The MDA model is related to multiple standards, including the Unified Modeling Language (UML), the Meta-Object Facility (MOF), XML Metadata Interchange (XMI), Enterprise Distributed Object Computing (EDOC), the Software Process Engineering Metamodel (SPEM), and the Common Warehouse Metamodel (CWM). Note that the term ‚Äúarchitecture‚Äù in Model-driven architecture does not refer to the architecture of the system being modeled, but rather to the architecture of the various standards and model forms that serve as the technology basis for MDA. Executable UML was the UML profile used when MDA was born. Now, the OMG is promoting fUML, instead. (The action language for fUML is ALF.) = Trademark = The Object Management Group holds registered trademarks on the term Model Driven Architecture and its acronym MDA, as well as trademarks for terms such as: Model Based Application Development, Model Driven Application Development, Model Based Application Development, Model Based Programming, Model Driven Systems, and others.http://www.omg.org/legal/tm_list.htm  Model-driven architecture topics  = MDA approach = OMG focuses Model-driven architecture on forward engineering, i.e. producing code from abstract, human- elaborated modelling diagrams (e.g. class diagrams). OMG's ADTF (Analysis and Design Task Force) group leads this effort. With some humour, the group chose ADM (MDA backwards) to name the study of reverse engineering. ADM decodes to Architecture-Driven Modernization. The objective of ADM is to produce standards for model-based reverse engineering of legacy systems.adm website http://adm.omg.org Knowledge Discovery Metamodel (KDM) is the furthest along of these efforts, and describes information systems in terms of various assets (programs, specifications, data, test files, database schemas, etc.). As the concepts and technologies used to realize designs and the concepts and technologies used to realize architectures have changed at their own pace, decoupling them allows system developers to choose from the best and most fitting in both domains. The design addresses the functional (use case) requirements while architecture provides the infrastructure through which non- functional requirements like scalability, reliability and performance are realized. MDA envisages that the platform independent model (PIM), which represents a conceptual design realizing the functional requirements, will survive changes in realization technologies and software architectures. Of particular importance to model-driven architecture is the notion of model transformation. A specific standard language for model transformation has been defined by OMG called QVT. = MDA tools = The OMG organization provides rough specifications rather than implementations, often as answers to Requests for Proposals (RFPs). The OMG documents the overall process in a document called the MDA Guide. Basically, an MDA tool is a tool used to develop, interpret, compare, align, measure, verify, transform, etc. models or metamodels. In the following section \\"model\\" is interpreted as meaning any kind of model (e.g. a UML model) or metamodel (e.g. the CWM metamodel). In any MDA approach we have essentially two kinds of models: initial models are created manually by human agents while derived models are created automatically by programs. For example, an analyst may create a UML initial model from its observation of some loose business situation while a Java model may be automatically derived from this UML model by a Model transformation operation. An MDA tool may be a tool used to check models for completeness, inconsistencies, or error and warning conditions. Also used to calculate metrics for the model. Some tools perform more than one of the functions listed above. For example, some creation tools may also have transformation and test capabilities. There are other tools that are solely for creation, solely for graphical presentation, solely for transformation, etc. Implementations of the OMG specifications come from private companies or open source groups. One important source of implementations for OMG specifications is the Eclipse Foundation (EF). Many implementations of OMG modeling standards may be found in the Eclipse Modeling Framework (EMF) or Graphical Modeling Framework (GMF), the Eclipse foundation is also developing other tools of various profiles as GMT. Eclipse's compliance to OMG specifications is often not strict. This is true for example for OMG's EMOF standard, which EMF approximates with its Ecore implementation. More examples may be found in the M2M project implementing the QVT standard or in the M2T project implementing the MOF2Text standard. One should be careful not to confuse the List of MDA Tools and the List of UML tools, the former being much broader. This distinction can be made more general by distinguishing 'variable metamodel tools' and 'fixed metamodel tools'. A UML CASE tool is typically a 'fixed metamodel tool' since it has been hard-wired to work only with a given version of the UML metamodel (e.g. UML 2.1). On the contrary, other tools have internal generic capabilities allowing them to adapt to arbitrary metamodels or to a particular kind of metamodels. Usually MDA tools focus rudimentary architecture specification, although in some cases the tools are architecture- independent (or platform independent). Simple examples of architecture specifications include: * Selecting one of a number of supported reference architectures like Java EE or Microsoft .NET, * Specifying the architecture at a finer level including the choice of presentation layer technology, business logic layer technology, persistence technology and persistence mapping technology (e.g. object-relational mapper). * Metadata: information about data. = MDA concerns = Some key concepts that underpin the MDA approach (launched in 2001) were first elucidated by the Shlaer-Mellor method during the late 1980s. Indeed, a key absent technical standard of the MDA approach (that of an action language syntax for Executable UML) has been bridged by some vendors by adapting the original Shlaer-Mellor Action Language (modified for UML). However, during this period the MDA approach has not gained mainstream industry acceptance; with the Gartner Group still identifying MDA as an \\"on the rise\\" technology in its 2006 \\"Hype Cycle\\",\\"Hype Cycle for Emerging Technologies, 2006\\" $495.00 and Forrester Research declaring MDA to be \\"D.O.A.\\" in 2006.\\"MDA Is DOA, Partly Thanks To SOA\\" Potential concerns that have been raised with the OMG MDA approach include: * Incomplete Standards: The MDA approach is underpinned by a variety of technical standards, some of which are yet to be specified (e.g. an action semantic language for xtUML), or are yet to be implemented in a standard manner (e.g. a QVT transformation engine or a PIM with a virtual execution environment).\\"UML - Unified or Universal Modeling Language? UML2, OCL, MOF, EDOC - The Emperor Has Too Many Clothes\\"\\"MDA: Nice Idea. Shame about the...\\" * Vendor Lock-in: Although MDA was conceived as an approach for achieving (technical) platform independence, current MDA vendors have been reluctant to engineer their MDA toolsets to be interoperable. Such an outcome could result in vendor lock-in for those pursuing an MDA approach. * Idealistic: MDA is conceived as a forward engineering approach in which models that incorporate Action Language programming are transformed into implementation artifacts (e.g. executable code, database schema) in one direction via a fully or partially automated \\"generation\\" step. This aligns with OMG's vision that MDA should allow modelling of a problem domain's full complexity in UML (and related standards) with subsequent transformation to a complete (executable) application.\\"Bringing MDA to Eclipse, using a pragmatic approach\\" This approach does, however, imply that changes to implementation artifacts (e.g. database schema tuning) are not supported . This constitutes a problem in situations where such post-transformation \\"adapting\\" of implementation artifacts is seen to be necessary. Evidence that the full MDA approach may be too idealistic for some real world deployments has been seen in the rise of so-called \\"pragmatic MDA\\".\\"A Response to Forrester\\" Pragmatic MDA blends the literal standards from OMG's MDA with more traditional model driven mechanisms such as round-trip engineering that provides support for adapting implementation artifacts. * Specialised Skillsets: Practitioners of MDA based software engineering are (as with other toolsets) required to have a high level of expertise in their field. Current expert MDA practitioners (often referred to as Modeller/Architects) are scarce relative to the availability of traditional developers.\\"Are You Ready For the MDA?\\" * OMG Track Record: The OMG consortium who sponsor the MDA approach (and own the MDA trademark) also introduced and sponsored the CORBA standard which itself failed to materialise as a widely utilised standard.\\"The Rise and Fall of CORBA\\" * Uncertain Value Proposition (UVP): As discussed, the vision of MDA allows for the specification of a system as an abstract model, which may be realized as a concrete implementation (program) for a particular computing platform (e.g. .NET). Thus an application that has been successfully developed via a pure MDA approach could theoretically be ported to a newer release .NET platform (or even a Java platform) in a deterministic manner - although significant questions remain as to real-world practicalities during translation (such as user interface implementation). Whether this capability represents a significant value proposition remains a question for particular adopters. Regardless, adopters of MDA who are seeking value via an \\"alternative to programming\\" should be very careful when assessing this approach. The complexity of any given problem domain will always remain, and the programming of business logic needs to be undertaken in MDA as with any other approach. The difference with MDA is that the programming language used (e.g. xtUML) is more abstract (than, say, Java or C#) and exists interwoven with traditional UML artifacts (e.g. class diagrams). Whether programming in a language that is more abstract than mainstream 3GL languages will result in systems of better quality, cheaper cost or faster delivery, is a question that has yet to be adequately answered. * MDA was recognized as a possible way to bring various independently developed standardized solutions together. For the simulation community, it was recommended as a business and industry based alternative to yet another US DoD mandated standard.\\"Avoiding Another Green Elephant\\"  Code generation controversy  Code generation means that the user abstractly models solutions, which are connoted by some model data, and then an automated tool derives from the models parts or all of the source code for the software system. In some tools, the user can provide a skeleton of the program source code, in the form of a source code template where predefined tokens are then replaced with program source code parts during the code generation process. An often cited criticism is that the UML diagrams just lack the detail which is needed to contain the same information as is covered with the program source. Some developers even claim that \\"the Code is the design\\".http://www.developerdotstar.com/mag/articles/reeves_design_main.html by Jack W.

Perceived as a leftist-nationalist at the onset of his career in public service, Ople was, in his final years, a vocal supporter for allowing a limited United States military presence in the Philippines, and for American initiatives in the War on Terror including the 2003 U.S. invasion of Iraq. Ople's most enduring role was his nineteen years as Secretary (later Minister) of Labor and Employment during the administration of President Ferdinand Marcos, when Philippine labor laws were overhauled through the enactment of the Labor Code of the Philippines that he had helped author. Early life and career Ople was born in Hagonoy, Bulacan on February 3, 1927 to Felix Antonio Ople, a craftsman who repaired boats, and his wife Segundina Fajardo. He graduated valedictorian of his grade school class at the Hagonoy Elementary School in 1941. Upon the invasion of the Philippines by Japan during World War II, he also had been to Hagonoy Institute during his secondary schooling, the teenage Ople joined the guerilla movement and fought under the Del Pilar Regiment and the Buenavista Regiment of the Bulacan Military Area founded by Alejo Santos. In 1948, he finished his high school studies at the Far Eastern University High School in Manila. He worked towards a degree in liberal arts at the Educational Center of Asia (formerly Quezon College) in Manila. After graduation, Ople pursued a career in journalism. He became a desk editor at the Daily Mirror and the author of its Jeepney Tales column. Still in his twenties, Ople was one of the youngest newspaper columnists of that era. Ople also established a public relations consulting firm. He soon became known for his nationalist views. He co-founded the Kilusang Makabansa (National Progress Movement), an organization which frequently spoke out on issues of nationalism and social justice in the 1950s. In 1953, he joined the Magsaysay-for-President Movement, a volunteer group supporting the presidential campaign of Ramon Magsaysay, heading its Executive Planning Committee and working as a speechwriter for candidates of the Nacionalista Party. After Magsaysay's election, he joined the government as special assistant to the Secretary of Labor and technical assistant on labor and agrarian affairs. Secretary of Labor In 1965, Ople was appointed as Social Security Commissioner by President Ferdinand E. Marcos. In 1967, he was appointed Secretary of Labor and Employment (in 1978 the position was renamed Minister of Labor and Employment). He resigned briefly in 1971 to run an unsuccessful campaign for election to the Philippine Senate, but was re- appointed to his post in 1972, retaining the position until 1986. At the time of his appointment, Ople was perceived as a \\"leftist Nationalist\\". His leftist credentials were enhanced when he co-founded, in 1972, the Philippine-Soviet Friendship Society.Gleeck, Jr., p. 387 As Labor Secretary Ople was instrumental in the framing of the Labor Code of the Philippines, which codified the labor laws of the country and introduced innovations such as prohibiting the termination of workers without legal cause. Ople instituted labor policies institutionalizing the technical education of workers. In 1976, Ople initiated a program for the overseas employment of Filipino workers. It was during his tenure at Labor that the Philippine Overseas Employment Administration and the Overseas Workers Welfare Administration were created. Ople obtained recognition from the International Labour Organization during his stint as Labor Minister. In 1975, he was elected president of the 60th International Labour Conference of the ILO, the first Filipino to hold that post. In 1983, that organization awarded Ople a Gold Medal of Appreciation. He was a close adviser of President Marcos, though he was not later to be associated with the corruption of the Marcos' government and was perceived as \\"not corrupt\\". He created international headlines in December 1984 when he admitted to the press that the lupus-stricken Marcos was incapacitated to the point of being unable \\"to take major initiatives\\", and that the President's illness had placed the Philippines in \\"a kind of interregnum\\". Marcos responded a few days later by baring his chest to his Cabinet before television cameras to dispel rumors that he was seriously ill or had undergone surgery. In 1978, Ople was elected an Assemblyman of the Interim Batasang Pambansa representing Central Luzon, and reelected in 1984. During the 1986 presidential elections, Ople served as a political campaign manager of President Marcos, who was running against Corazon Aquino. Shortly before the outbreak of the 1986 People Power Revolution, Marcos dispatched Ople to Washington, D.C. to lobby the American government on behalf of the President. Ople was in Washington D.C. upon the outbreak of the revolt, and was advised by U.S. Secretary of State, George P. Shultz, to call on Marcos to resign. Ople publicly reiterated his support for Marcos in the American media in such fora as on This Week with David Brinkley. 1986 Constitutional Commission Member Following the success of the People Power Revolution and the installation to the presidency of Corazon Aquino, Ople was relieved of his Cabinet post. Ople returned to the Philippines and immediately attempted to position himself as the leader of the political opposition against Aquino. Nonetheless in May 1986, Ople accepted an offer by President Aquino to serve in the Constitutional Commission that drafted a new Philippine Constitution. In the 1987 congressional elections, Ople ran a second time for the Philippine Senate, under the banner of the nationalist-led Grand Alliance for Democracy coalition. He was defeated in this attempt, and returned to private life, serving as chairman of the Institute for Public Policy (IPP), a policy research institute. Senator of the Philippines Blas Ople In 1992, he ran again for the Senate under the Laban ng Demokratikong Pilipino. He was elected to a six-year term. In the Senate, Ople served as Chairman of the Foreign Relations Committee and on the Commission of Appointments. He became Senate President Pro-Tempore in 1998. Ople won a re-election for the senate in 1998, under the Laban ng Makabayang Masang Pilipino. In 1999, upon the resignation of the terminally-ill Marcelo Fernan, Ople became the President of the Senate. In that capacity, he was a key proponent of the 1999 Visiting Forces Agreement between the Philippines and the United States, which allowed American forces to enter the Philippines for short-term training exercises. He yielded the Senate presidency in 2000 to Franklin Drilon. Later that year, he sat as one of the senator-judges in the impeachment trial of his ally, President Joseph Estrada. He was one of the eleven votes during the trial that successfully voted to block the opening of an envelope that was believed to contain proof of the corruption charges against Estrada. Public anger over the Senate vote triggered the EDSA Revolution of 2001, leading to the ouster of Estrada and the accession of Vice-President Gloria Macapagal-Arroyo to the presidency. Secretary of Foreign Affairs In July 2002, President Gloria Macapagal- Arroyo appointed Ople, a member of the political opposition in the Senate, as Secretary of Foreign Affairs in her cabinet. The appointment was with some controversy. Weeks earlier, Arroyo's hand-picked Vice-President Teofisto Guingona had resigned as Foreign Affairs Secretary after voicing disagreement with the plan of the Philippine and United States governments to allow American troops to help combat Islamic terrorist groups such as the Abu Sayyaf as part of the post-9/11 \\"War on Terror\\". Ople, who had earlier been a vocal supporter of the 1999 Visiting Forces Agreement, was perceived to be more amenable to the plan. In addition, left-wing labor activists denounced the appointment of Ople, citing his Marcos-era role in promoting overseas employment of Filipino workers which, they said, had resulted in abuses inflicted on Filipino workers abroad. During his stint as Secretary of Foreign Affairs, Ople was at the forefront of the negotiations that led to the deployment of American military forces inside the Philippines, though he insisted that the American troops would not participate in combat missions. Under his watch, the American and Filipino governments signed an agreement that provided immunity to each other's citizens facing charges before international tribunals such as the International Criminal Court. Ople was also a vocal supporter of the Iraq War, and pushed for the deployment of a small Filipino contingent in Iraq. He predicted in November 2003, \\"Baghdad will be transformed from a symbol of brutal despotism to a new, shining symbol of human freedom. The sacrifices invested in the liberation of Iraq, to which Filipinos made a significant contribution, will be fully vindicated and cherished for all time.\\" Death Senator Ople's monument at Gat Blas F. Ople Sentro ng Kabataan, Sining at Kultura ng Bulacan, Malolos City, Bulacan. Gravesite of Blas Ople at the Libingan ng mga Bayani In the months prior to his death, Ople, a longtime chain smoker, had suffered from ill health and often attended international conferences in a wheelchair. On the night of October 13, 2003, Ople had difficulty breathing and lost consciousness while aboard a Japan Asia Airways flight from Bangkok to Tokyo. The flight was diverted to Chiang Kai-shek International Airport in Taoyuan County, Taiwan (now Taoyuan City), and Ople was rushed to a nearby hospital where he was initially pronounced dead on arrival, but given medical treatment nonetheless. Efforts to revive him were futile, and his death on Tuesday, October 14, 2003 was announced by his family. President Arroyo mourned Ople as \\"an architect of Philippine foreign policy in the finest tradition of enlightened and pragmatic diplomacy\\", while U.S. Secretary of State Colin Powell hailed him as \\"one of the pivotal figures of the late Twentieth Century for Philippine history\\". More critical of Ople, Teddy Casi√±o, secretary-general of the leftist coalition BAYAN, called him a \\"political chameleon\\" who \\"tried to pass himself off as a nationalist but [was] most pro-American\\". Nonetheless, Casi√±o acknowledged that Ople was \\"a consistent, brilliant and very astute politician\\". Ople was eulogized in Time Magazine, which recalled his erudition, his skill at political survival, and his trademark \\"extraordinary baritone\\". The eulogy also said that at the height of the People Power Revolution, Ople in Washington, D.C. had reported to Marcos in Manila that the President's support within the Reagan administration was falling. Marcos responded by asking Ople to reach out to his contacts in the Soviet government. Ople rebuffed Marcos, and as Time noted, declined \\"to help make the Philippines a Soviet colony three years before the Berlin Wall fell\\". Ople is buried at the Libingan ng mga Bayani. In 2004, President Arroyo named Ople's daughter, Susan Ople, as Undersecretary of the Department of Labor and Employment.

The game pits two teams against each other in online multiplayer matches; each team member plays as one of nine classes, each with different skills. The scenarios include capture the flag (CTF), territorial control, and escorting a \\"VIP\\" player. Based on the 1996 Quake modification known as just Team Fortress, Valve ported the game to the GoldSrc engine (used in Half-Life) as a way of promoting Half-Life software development kit. Since the release of Team Fortress Classic, the game has undergone significant upgrades to the player models and game modes. Gameplay capture the flag map \\"2fort\\", short for \\"2 Fortresses\\", a group of blue players attack the red base.left Matches in Team Fortress Classic feature two teams, one red and one blue, and nine playable character classes. Each character class has a set of weapons and abilities unique to that specific class. This differentiation between classes makes for rock-paper- scissors-esque gameplay that requires teammates to work together in order to effectively achieve the objective. The class-system also encourages players to vary their selection of classes and utilize certain classes in conjunction with one another to gain the advantage. In Team Fortress Classic, a server can hold up to 32 players simultaneously, and matches can be played in a number of game modes, each featuring different objectives. =Classes= In Team Fortress Classic, the player can choose to play as one of nine classes: the Scout, Sniper, Soldier, Demoman, Medic, HWGuy, Pyro, Spy, or Engineer. Each class comes equipped with at least one weapon unique to that class, and often a secondary weapon which may be common across multiple classes (typically a shotgun or nailgun). Additionally, each class gets a melee weapon (all classes but the Medic, Spy and Engineer wield a crowbar, a homage to Valve's game Half-Life). Finally, each player carries grenades; the effects of grenades vary, depending on the player's class. In Escort game modes, a player may also choose to play as the Civilian class, which is armed only with an umbrella, no armor, and very little health. Civilians are typically escorted and protected by the rest of the team. * The Scout is the fastest class in the game, but is unable to deal much damage in return. The Scout is armed with a nailgun as well as being able to use caltrops and concussion grenades to slow down and confuse opponents. He can also disarm the Demoman's detonation pack as well as reveal enemy spies by running close by fellow players. * The Sniper class is armed with a high-powered sniper rifle, and can be used to attack enemies from distant positions. * The Soldier class is significantly slower than Snipers and Scouts, but possesses better armor and is armed with a rocket launcher that allows him to rocket jump, along with combat shotguns as sidearms for backup. Rocket jumping, while effective for moving about the battlefield, also significantly damages the soldier. Soldiers can also make use of nail bombs to cause more damage within close quarters. * The Demoman class is armed with a grenade launcher for indirect fire onto enemy positions, and a Pipe Bomb launcher for booby trapping places as well as being equipped with a demolition pack capable of opening or closing certain routes on some levels. models for the nine player classes.thumbright * The Medic class is equipped with a super nail gun, concussion grenades and a medical kit that can be used either to heal teammates or expose opponents to a contagious infection that drains health. * The Heavy Weapons class is armed with a powerful minigun, and can sustain more damage than any other class. However, the Heavy is significantly slower than the other classes. * The Pyro class is equipped with a flamethrower and an incendiary rocket launcher, both of which can set enemies on fire. Pyros also carry several napalm grenades for the same purpose. * The Spy class differs significantly in style from other classes, as he can disguise himself to look like any other class on either side. The Spy is equipped with a knife to kill enemy players in one hit by stabbing them in the back, a tranquilizer gun to slow down opponents and a hallucination grenade which spouts gas to confuse them. Spies also possess the ability to feign death, allowing them to use their backstab ability more effectively. * The Engineer class builds structures to support their team, such as sentry guns to defend key points, ammunition dispensers and teleporters. Engineers have the ability to replenish a teammates armor by tapping them with their wrench. In addition, the Engineer is armed with EMP grenades that detonates any explosive ammunition within its range, as well as a shotgun for backup. Development Team Fortress originally was a Quake mod. Team Fortress was originally a modification for Quake (1996), and then later for QuakeWorld, developed by TF Software Pty. Ltd. Its developers were working on a follow up stand-alone version that they planned to call Team Fortress 2 when the team was hired by Valve to write a port of Team Fortress as a mod for Valve's game Half-Life. After several delays from the original release date of March 26, 1999, the mod was released on April 7, 1999. On June 9, 2000, Team Fortress version 1.5 was released a part of Half-Life 1.1 update. It was the first standalone version of Team Fortress. The update added \\"new sounds and weapons, enhanced graphics, new models for classes and weapons, new maps from popular mapmakers, an updated user interface that makes finding and joining games easy and intuitive, and a new in-game Command Menu Interface\\". It also included a new in-game interface and the networking code for Valve's then upcoming Team Fortress 2. There were three new maps with the update: Dustbowl, Warpath, and Epicenter. Additionally, the new Command Menu Interface was an in-game menu that allowed players to execute commands to change teams, call for a medic and change classes while in a match. Valve significantly updated the game over time, tweaking the game's networking code, and adding new maps and game modes. In 2003, Team Fortress Classic was released as a stand-alone game on Valve's Steam system. Versions of the game for OS X and Linux were released in 2013.  Reception  Team Fortress Classic received positive reviews from critics, garnering a rating of 85% on the video game review aggregator site GameRankings. There were some criticisms, however, like Graham Smith of Rock, Paper, Shotgun who criticized the game for being \\"like Counter Strike only messy and gruff\\" PC Gamer US named Team Fortress Classic the best multiplayer game of 1999, and wrote that it was \\"more fun and more addictive than any other multiplayer-only title released in 1999, and didn't cost owners of Half- Life a single penny.\\" PC Gamer UK praised the game for its multiple character classes, \\"sophisticated game-tactics\\", and drive to work together with your team, but also noted the game's \\"clunky\\" inter-team communication and mediocre graphics. In 2010, the game was included as one of the games in the book 1001 Video Games You Must Play Before You Die.  Legacy  Following the success of Team Fortress as a Quake modification, Team Fortress Software began development of a sequel. Interested in the project's potential, Valve hired the team to develop Team Fortress 2 on the modified Quake engine utilized by Half-Life. The partnership was announced in 1998, developed in parallel to Team Fortress Classic. However, the game was not shown publicly until a year later at E3 1999. Introduced as Team Fortress 2: Brotherhood of Arms, the game showcased multiple unprecedented technologies for its time and won several awards including \\"Best Online Game\\" and \\"Best Action Game\\". In June 2000, Valve announced that Team Fortress 2 had been delayed further, attributing this to their rebuilding of the game on a new, proprietary in-house engine that is today known as the Source engine. Following this delay, little mention of the game was made by Valve for a period of six years. Running up to Half- Life 2's release in 2004, Valve's Doug Lombardi claimed that Team Fortress 2 was still being developed and news of its release would come after that of Half-Life 2. However, Lombardi's claim would not come to fruition until Electronic Arts' 2006 Summer Showcase. For the first time in more than half a decade, the game was shown publicly with an art style that notably contrasted its revisions prior. In 2007, Team Fortress 2 was released to critical acclaim as part of The Orange Box. The plot of Team Fortress 2 is progressed outside of the game itself, usually in the form of short videos or comics. In April 2014, Valve introduced the Team Fortress Classic mercenaries, excluding their respective Medic, into the plot of Team Fortress 2. A catch-up comic released on the TF2 website released for free comic book day revealed that Team Fortress Classic is set in alternate 1930, and that the game takes place during the Gravel Wars era of the timeline, along with the fact that the classic engineer is the father of the engineer in Team Fortress 2. A fan-made total conversion mod for Half-Life 2 titled Fortress Forever was created, aiming to replicate the gameplay of Team Fortress Classic while using the more modern Source engine.

He wrote in at least three languages. With his wife, Franciszka Themerson, they are regarded as leading husband-and-wife exponents of European Surrealism and publishers. Early life Stefan Themerson was born in P≈Çock in what was then part of the Russian Empire on 25 January 1910 and died in London on 6 September 1988. His father, Mieczys≈Çaw Themerson, was a physician, social reformer and aspiring writer (some of his work was published) of Jewish descent. His mother was Ludwika Smulewicz. During the First World War Dr. Themerson served as a medical officer in the Tsar's army and the family lived in Riga, St. Petersburg and Velikiye Luki. In 1918 they returned to P≈Çock, in an independent Poland, where Stefan attended the W≈Çadys≈Çaw Jagie≈Ç≈Ço Gymnasium. During this time he first showed an interest in photography and also built a radio receiver. Stefan's older brother, Roman, also qualified as a doctor, but died of spinal tuberculosis in 1929.http://plock.wyborcza.pl/plock/1,35681,14994385,Lekarze_czytaja_nowele_plockiego_Judyma__Audiobook.html?disableRedirects=true In 1928 Themerson went to Warsaw University to study physics. After a year, he transferred to the Warsaw Polytechnic to take up architecture, but spent most of his time working on photography, collage and film-making. His first published piece of writing was also in 1928. He never formally left his studies but gradually withdrew to follow his other interests. Themerson met the art student Franciszka Weinles, in 1929. She graduated with distinction in 1931 and they married the same year in Warsaw. 1931 to 1935 During these years the Themersons lived and worked in Warsaw. Stefan contributed articles to various periodicals and prose and verse to school textbooks and wrote at least ten books for children which Franciszka illustrated. Pan Tom Buduje Dom, Mr Rouse Builds His House is still in print in Poland. Stefan also experimented with photograms and the two of them made five short experimental films Apteka (The Pharmacy) (1930), Europa (1931‚Äì1932), Drobiazg Melodyjny (Musical Moment) (1933), Zwarcie (Short Circuit) (1935) and Przygoda Cz≈Çowieka Poczciwego (The Adventures of a Good Citizen) (1937). These were shown with other experimental films of the time. All except Przygoda Cz≈Çowieka Poczciwego, which remained in Warsaw, were lost in Paris in the Second World War, but the script for Europa, based on a poem by Anatol Stern was later published by the Themersons' Gaberbocchus Press, illustrated by surviving stills from the film and Apteka and Drobiazg melodyjny were remade by Bruce Checefsky from descriptions of them when they first appeared, stills and storyboards. A \\"remake\\" of Europa was made in Poland in the 1980s and an incomplete copy of the original film was found in an archive in Berlin in 2019. In 1935, with other young filmmakers, they founded a cooperative, S.A.F, Sp√≥≈Çdzielnia Autor√≥w Filmowych. 1936 to 1939 In 1936 and 1937 the Themersons visited Paris, then the centre of the world for avant-garde art, and London, meeting Moholy-Nagy and other experimental artists and arranged first screenings of French and English avant-garde films on their return to Warsaw. They also founded a review Film Artistique, Stefan as editor, Franciszka as artistic editor (the journal of the film-makers' co-operative). Two issues were published, one on the French avant-garde, one on recent English film. A third issue, on the Polish Avant-garde, was planned but remained unpublished when, in the winter of 1937‚Äì38 they moved to Paris: \\"I just knew I had to be in Paris.\\" Themerson said. Here they found a circle of artists and writers, many Polish, among whom to live and move. Themerson wrote for various Polish publications in Paris; Franciszka started to paint, and illustrated children's books for Flammarion. They planned to stay there, but ‚Äì as for most of their generation ‚Äì the outbreak of World War II changed their lives. With the declaration of war in 1939, the Themersons both enlisted, Stefan joined the Polish Army in the West forming in France after the German and Soviet invasions and partition of Poland. Franciszka was seconded to the Polish government-in-exile as a cartographer, first in France then from 1940 in London after the Fall of France. Second World War and after In 1940 Themerson volunteered for a Polish infantry regiment in France, just in time for the German invasion and the Allies' collapse. His memory was of marching day and night in the summer heat to St-Nazaire. There, in June, the regiment was disbanded, the officers abandoning their men and the men dispersing where they could. Themerson travelled inside France, first returning (on foot) to occupied Paris, then on to Toulouse, where, through the Polish Red Cross, he re-established contact with Franciszka. She had been working for the Polish Government in Exile as a cartographer in Paris and Normandy and had subsequently escaped to London on a troopship from Bayonne. Meanwhile, he spent time in refugee camps, worked as a farm labourer, and spent nearly two years in a Polish Red Cross hostel, the H√¥tel de la Poste in Voiron. Here he began writing Professor Mmaa's Lecture in Polish and wrote the long poem in French Croquis dans les T√©n√®bres (Sketches in Darkness). Much of their sporadic correspondence from the years 1940‚Äì42 concerned attempts to engineer Stefan's escape from France. Towards the end of 1942 Themerson got across France via Marseille and Spain to Lisbon whence he was flown to Britain by the R.A.F., rejoining his wife and re-enlisting in the Polish army. He spent time with the army in Scotland, where he finished Professor Mmaa, and then was sent to join the film unit of the Polish Ministry of Information and Documentation in London. There he and Franciszka, commissioned by the Polish Ministry of Information and Documentation, made two further short films, Calling Mr Smith, an account of Nazi atrocities in Poland and The Eye and the Ear, inspired by four Julian Tuwim songs set to music by Szymanowski. In 1944 at the PEN club meeting to celebrate the three hundredth anniversary of John Milton's Areopagitica, Themerson met Kurt Schwitters, who became a close friend until Schwitters' death in 1948. At about the same time he met others who remained close, including Jankel Adler, Julian Trevelyan and Anthony Froshaug. Also in 1944 the Themersons moved to Maida Vale, where they lived for the rest of their lives. A close neighbour was the experimental poet and publisher Bob Cobbing with whom the Themersons kept close relations. Stefan and Franciszka Themerson published many of their works through their own Gaberbocchus Press (the latinised version of Jabberwocky) from 1948 to 1979. Most were designed and illustrated by Franciszka. They also worked with the translators Barbara Wright and Stanley Chapman, and the artist Gwen Barnard. Their list of some 70 titles included works by Guillaume Apollinaire, Jankel Adler and Kurt Schwitters, the first English translation of Alfred Jarry's Ubu Roi, Raymond Queneau's Exercises in Style and The Good Citizen's Alphabet by Bertrand Russell. The latter wrote an encouraging preface to Professor Mmaa‚Äôs Lecture. Influenced by Queneau and his Oulipo circle, whom they visited in 1950, Stefan was the inventor of Semantic Poetry (see his 1945 novel Bayamus, and his 1975 tract On Semantic Poetry). He wrote an opera, 'St. Francis and the Wolf of Gubbio' (1972). In 1981, Themerson delivered the annual Huizinga Lecture in Leiden in the Netherlands, under the title \\"The Chair of Decency\\". He died in London a few weeks after the death of his wife, in September 1988. Legacy In 1979, the Gaberbocchus Press was taken over by Dutch publisher De Harmonie, at Themerson's invitation. They maintain the press's archive as well. It was through this Dutch connection that some of his novels gained recognition in the English-reading world; in 1985, Dutch publisher De Bezige Bij published a translation of an English manuscript, which they titled Euclid was an Ass (Dutch: Euclides was een ezel\\"). This book was read by someone with connections at Faber and Faber, which in turn published the book in English, now called The Mystery of the Sardine (1986), and his last novel Hobson's Island (1988). These two novels and the earlier Tom Harris were later republished by Dalkey Archive Press. The Themersons' eight volume archive has been assembled and catalogued by Franciszka's niece, the British arts curator, Jasia Reichardt.Archiwum Themerson√≥w in Katowice ‚Äì archived page Internet Archive A Themerson Festival takes place annually in Themerson's native city, P≈Çock in Poland. interview with Richard, Klimowski and Sady.

He was one of the founders of the Indian National Congress. A notable ornithologist, Hume has been called \\"the Father of Indian Ornithology\\" and, by those who found him dogmatic, \\"the Pope of Indian ornithology\\". As an administrator of Etawah, he saw the Indian Rebellion of 1857 as a result of misgovernance and made great efforts to improve the lives of the common people. The district of Etawah was among the first to be returned to normality and over the next few years Hume's reforms led to the district being considered a model of development. Hume rose in the ranks of the Indian Civil Service but like his father Joseph Hume, the radical MP, he was bold and outspoken in questioning British policies in India. He rose in 1871 to the position of secretary to the Department of Revenue, Agriculture, and Commerce under Lord Mayo. His criticism of Lord Lytton however led to his removal from the Secretariat in 1879. He founded the journal Stray Feathers in which he and his subscribers recorded notes on birds from across India. He built up a vast collection of bird specimens at his home in Shimla by making collection expeditions and obtaining specimens through his network of correspondents. Following the loss of manuscripts that he had long been maintaining in the hope of producing a magnum opus on the birds of India, he abandoned ornithology and gifted his collection to the Natural History Museum in London, where it continues to be the single largest collection of Indian bird skins. He was briefly a follower of the theosophical movement founded by Madame Blavatsky. He left India in 1894 to live in London from where he continued to take an interest in the Indian National Congress, apart from taking an interest in botany and founding the South London Botanical Institute towards the end of his life. Life and career = Early life = Hume was born at St Mary Cray, Kent,Moulton (2004); Encyclop√¶dia Britannica and some older sources give his birthplace as Montrose, Forfarshire. a younger son (and the eighth child in a family of nine) of Joseph Hume, the Radical member of parliament, by his marriage to Maria Burnley. Until the age of eleven he was privately tutored growing up at the town house at 6 Bryanston Square in London and at their country estate, Burnley Hall in Norfolk. He was educated at University College Hospital, where he studied medicine and surgery and was then nominated to the Indian Civil Services which led him to study at the East India Company College, Haileybury. Early influences included his friend John Stuart Mill and Herbert Spencer. He briefly served as a junior midshipman aboard a navy vessel in the Mediterranean in 1842. = Etawah (1849‚Äì1867) = Hume sailed to India in 1849 and the following year, joined the Bengal Civil Service at Etawah in the North-Western Provinces, in what is now Uttar Pradesh. His career in India included service as a district officer from 1849 to 1867, head of a central department from 1867 to 1870, and secretary to the Government from 1870 to 1879.Wedderburn (1913):3. He married Mary Anne Grindall (26 May 1824, Meerut ‚Äì March 1890, Simla) in 1853. It was only nine years after his entry to India that Hume faced the Indian Rebellion of 1857 during which time he was involved in several military actions for which he was created a Companion of the Bath in 1860. Initially it appeared that he was safe in Etawah, not far from Meerut where the rebellion began but this changed and Hume had to take refuge in Agra fort for six months.Wedderburn (1913):11‚Äì12. Nonetheless, all but one Indian official remained loyal and Hume resumed his position in Etawah in January 1858. He built up an irregular force of 650 loyal Indian troops and took part in engagements with them. Hume blamed British ineptitude for the uprising and pursued a policy of \\"mercy and forbearance\\". Only seven persons were executed at the gallows on his orders. The district of Etawah was restored to peace and order in a year, something that was not possible in most other parts.Wedderburn (1913):19. Shortly after 1857, he set about in a range of reforms. As a District Officer in the Indian Civil Service, he began introducing free primary education and held public meetings for their support. He made changes in the functioning of the police department and the separation of the judicial role. Noting that there was very little reading material with educational content, he started, along with Koour Lutchman Singh, a Hindi language periodical, Lokmitra (The People's Friend) in 1859. Originally meant only for Etawah, its fame spread.Wedderburn (1913):21. Hume also organized and managed an Urdu journal Muhib-i-riaya.Memorandum by M. Kempson, Director of Public Instruction, NWP, dated 19-April-1870. Home Department Proceedings April, 1877. National Archives of India. He took up the cause of education and founded scholarships for higher education. He wrote, in 1859, that education played a key role in avoiding revolts like the one in 1857: ... assert its supremacy as it may at the bayonet's point, a free and civilized government must look for its stability and permanence to the enlightenment of the people and their moral and intellectual capacity to appreciate its blessings. In 1863 he moved for separate schools for juvenile delinquents rather than flogging and imprisonment which he saw as producing hardened criminals. His efforts led to a juvenile reformatory not far from Etawah. He also started free schools in Etawah and by 1857 he established 181 schools with 5186 students including two girls.Wedderburn (1913):16. The high school that he helped build with his own money is still in operation, now as a junior college, and it was said to have a floor plan resembling the letter \\"H\\". This, according to some was an indication of Hume's imperial ego. Hume found the idea of earning revenue earned through liquor traffic repulsive and described it as \\"The wages of sin\\". With his progressive ideas on social reform, he advocated women's education, was against infanticide and enforced widowhood. Hume laid out in Etawah, a neatly gridded commercial district that is now known as Humeganj but often pronounced Homeganj. = Commissioner of Customs (1867‚Äì1870) = In 1867 Hume became Commissioner of Customs for the North West Province, and in 1870 he became attached to the central government as Director-General of Agriculture. In 1879 he returned to provincial government at Allahabad. = Secretary to the Department of Revenue, Agriculture and Commerce (1871‚Äì1879) = Hume was very interested in the development of agriculture. He believed that there was too much focus on obtaining revenue and no effort had been spent on improving the efficiency of agriculture. He found an ally in Lord Mayo who supported the idea of developing a complete department of agriculture. Hume noted in his Agricultural reform in India that Lord Mayo had been the only Viceroy who had any experience of working in the fields. Hume made a number of suggestions for the improvement of agriculture placing carefully gathered evidence for his ideas. He noted the poor yields of wheat, comparing them with estimates from the records of Emperor Akbar and yields of farms in Norfolk. Lord Mayo supported his ideas but was unable to establish a dedicated agricultural bureau as the scheme did not find support from the Secretary of State for India, but they negotiated the setting up of a Department of Revenue, Agriculture and Commerce despite Hume's insistence that Agriculture be the first and foremost aim. Hume was made a secretary of this department in July 1871 leading to his move to Shimla. With the murder of Lord Mayo in the Andamans in 1872, Hume lost patronage and support for his work. He however went about reforming the department of agriculture, streamlining the collection of meteorological data (the meteorological department was set up by order number 56 on 27 September 1875 signed by Hume) and statistics on cultivation and yield. Hume proposed the idea of having experimental farms to demonstrate best practices to be set up in every district. He proposed to develop fuelwood plantations \\"in every village in the drier portions of the country\\" and thereby provide a substitute heating and cooking fuel so that manure (dried cattle dung was used as fuel by the poor) could be returned to the land. Such plantations, he wrote, were \\"a thing that is entirely in accord with the traditions of the country ‚Äì a thing that the people would understand, appreciate, and, with a little judicious pressure, cooperate in.\\" He wanted model farms to be established in every district. He noted that rural indebtedness was caused mainly by the use of land as security, a practice that had been introduced by the British. Hume denounced it as another of \\"the cruel blunders into which our narrow-minded, though wholly benevolent, desire to reproduce England in India has led us.\\" Hume also wanted government-run banks, at least until cooperative banks could be established. The department also supported the publication of several manuals on aspects of cultivation, a list of which Hume included as an appendix to his Agricultural Reform in India. Hume supported the introduction of cinchona and the project managed by George King to produce quinine locally at low cost. Hume was very outspoken and never feared to criticise when he thought the Government was in the wrong. Even in 1861, he objected to the concentration of police and judicial functions in the hands of police superintendents. In March 1861, he took a medical leave due to a breakdown from overwork and departed for Britain. Before leaving, he condemned the flogging and punitive measures initiated by the provincial government as 'barbarous ... torture'. He was allowed to return to Etawah only after apologising for the tone of his criticism. He criticised the administration of Lord Lytton before 1879 which according to him, had cared little for the welfare and aspiration of the people of India. Lord Lytton's foreign policy according to Hume had led to the waste of \\"millions and millions of Indian money\\". Hume was critical of the land revenue policy and suggested that it was the cause of poverty in India. His superiors were irritated and attempted to restrict his powers and this led him to publish a book on Agricultural Reform in India in 1879. Hume noted that the free and honest expression was not only permitted but encouraged under Lord Mayo and that this freedom was curtailed under Lord Northbrook who succeeded Lord Mayo. When Lord Lytton succeeded Lord Northbrook, the situation worsened for Hume.Wedderburn (1913):37 In 1879 Hume went against the authorities. The Government of Lord Lytton dismissed him from his position in the Secretariat. No clear reason was given except that it \\"was based entirely on the consideration of what was most desirable in the interests of the public service\\". The press declared that his main wrongdoing was that he was too honest and too independent. The Pioneer wrote that it was \\"the grossest jobbery ever perpetrated\\" ; the Indian Daily News wrote that it was a \\"great wrong\\" while The Statesman said that \\"undoubtedly he has been treated shamefully and cruelly.\\" The Englishman in an article dated 27 June 1879, commenting on the event stated, \\"There is no security or safety now for officers in Government employment.\\"Wedderburn (1913):35‚Äì38 Demoted, he left Simla and returned to the North-West Provinces in October 1879, as a member of the Board of Revenue. It has pointed out that he was victimised as he was out of step with the policies of the Government, often intruding into aspects of administration with critical opinions. = Demotion and resignation (1879‚Äì1882) = In spite of the humiliation of demotion, he did not resign immediately from service and it has been suggested that this was because he needed his salary to support the publication of The Game Birds of India that he was working on. Hume retired from the civil service only in 1882. In 1883 he wrote an open letter to the graduates of Calcutta University, calling upon them to form their own national political movement. This led in 1885 to the first session of the Indian National Congress held in Bombay. In 1887 writing to the Public Commission of India he made what was then a statement unexpected from a civil servant ‚Äî I look upon myself as a Native of India. = Return to England 1894 = Hume's grave in Brookwood Cemetery Hume's wife Mary died on 30 March 1890 and news of her death reached him just as he reached London on 1 April 1890. Their only daughter Maria Jane Burnley (\\"Minnie\\") (1854‚Äì1927) had married Ross Scott at Shimla on 28 December 1881. Maria became a member of the Hermetic Order of the Golden Dawn, another occult movement, after moving to England. Ross Scott was the founding secretary of the Simla Eclectic Theosophical Society, who was sometime Judicial Commissioner of Oudh and died in 1908. Hume's grandson Allan Hume Scott served with the Royal Engineers in India. Hume left India in 1894 and settled at The Chalet, 4 Kingswood Road, Upper Norwood in south London. He died at the age of eighty-three on 31 July 1912. His ashes were buried in Brookwood Cemetery. The bazaar in Etawah was closed on hearing of his death and the Collector, H. R. Neville, presided over a memorial meeting.Wedderburn (1913):134 The Indian postal department issued a commemorative stamp with his portrait in 1973 and a special cover depicting Rothney Castle, his home in Shimla, was released in 2013. Contribution to ornithology and natural history From early days, Hume had a special interest in science. Science, he wrote: and of natural history he wrote in 1867: Map of the Crags and Rothney Castle, Shimla (1872) During his career in Etawah, he built up a personal collection of bird specimens, however the first collection that he made was destroyed during the 1857 rebellion. After 1857 Hume made several expeditions to collect birds both on health leave and where work took him but his most systematic work began after he moved to Shimla. He was Collector and Magistrate of Etawah from 1856 to 1867 during which time he studied the birds of that area. He later became Commissioner of Inland Customs which made him responsible for the control of of coast from near Peshawar in the northwest to Cuttack on the Bay of Bengal. He travelled on horseback and camel in areas of Rajasthan to negotiate treaties with various local maharajas to control the export of salt and during these travels he took note of the birdlife: Hume appears to have planned a comprehensive work on the birds of India around 1870 and a \\"forthcoming comprehensive work\\" finds mention in the second edition of The Cyclopaedia of India (1871) by his cousin Edward Balfour. His systematic plan to survey and document the birds of the Indian Subcontinent began in earnest after he started accumulating the largest collection of Asiatic birds in his personal museum and library at home in Rothney Castle on Jakko Hill, Simla. Rothney Castle, originally Rothney House was built by Colonel Octavius Edward Rothney and later belonged to P. Mitchell, C.I.E from whom Hume bought it and converted it into a palatial house with some hope that it might be bought by the Government as a Viceregal residence since the Governor-General then occupied Peterhoff, a building too small for large parties. Hume spent over two hundred thousand pounds on the grounds and buildings. He added enormous reception rooms suitable for large dinner parties and balls, as well as a magnificent conservatory and spacious hall with walls displaying his superb collection of Indian horns. He used a large room for his bird museum. He hired a European gardener, and made the grounds and conservatory a perpetual horticultural exhibition, to which he courteously admitted all visitors. Rothney Castle could only be reached by a steep road, and was never purchased by the British Government. Hume made several expeditions almost solely to study ornithology the largest being an expedition to the Indus area in late November 1871 and continued until the end of February 1872. In March 1873, he visited the Andaman and Nicobar Islands in the Bay of Bengal along with geologists Dr. Ferdinand Stoliczka and Dr. Dougall of the Geological Survey of India and James Wood-Mason of the Indian Museum in Calcutta. In 1875, he made an expedition to the Laccadive Islands aboard the marine survey vessel IGS Clyde under the command of Staff-Commander Ellis. The official purpose of the visit being to examine proposed sites for lighthouses. During this expedition Hume collected many bird specimens, apart from conducting a bathymetric survey to determine whether the island chain was separated from India by a deep canyon. And in 1881 he made his last ornithological expedition to Manipur, a visit in which he collected and described the Manipur bush quail (Perdicula manipurensis), a bird that has remained obscure with few reliable reports since. Hume spent an extra day with his assistants cutting down a large tract of grass so that he could obtain specimens of this species. This expedition was made on special leave following his demotion from the Central Government to a junior position on the Board of Revenue of the North Western Provinces. Apart from personal travel, he also sent out a trained bird-skinner to accompany officers travelling in areas of ornithological interest such as Afghanistan. Around 1878 he was spending about ‚Ç§ 1500 a year on his ornithological surveys. Hume's map of Lakshadweep and with the depths of the seabed as recorded by him. Hume was a member of the Asiatic Society of Bengal from January 1870 to 1891 and admitted Fellow of the Linnean Society on 3 November 1904. After returning to England in 1890 he also became president of the Dulwich Liberal and Radical Association. =Collection= Rothney Castle, conservatory and facade (2016). Hume used his vast bird collection to good use as editor of his journal Stray Feathers. He also intended to produce a comprehensive publication on the birds of India. Hume employed William Ruxton Davison, who was brought to notice by Dr. George King, as a curator for his personal bird collection. Hume trained Davison and sent him out annually on collection trips to various parts of India as he himself was held up with official responsibilities. In 1883 Hume returned from a trip to find that many pages of the manuscripts that he had maintained over the years had been stolen and sold off as waste paper by a servant. Hume was completely devastated and he began to lose interest in ornithology due to this theft and a landslip, caused by heavy rains in Simla, which had damaged his museum and many of the specimens. He wrote to the British Museum wishing to donate his collection on certain conditions. One of the conditions was that the collection was to be examined by Dr. R. Bowdler Sharpe and personally packed by him, apart from raising Dr. Sharpe's rank and salary due to the additional burden on his work caused by his collection. The British Museum was unable to heed his many conditions. It was only in 1885 after the destruction of nearly 20000 specimens, that alarm bells were raised by Dr. Sharpe and the museum authorities let him visit India to supervise the transfer of the specimens to the British Museum. Sharpe wrote of Hume's impressive private ornithological museum: Sharpe also noted: The Hume collection of birds was packed into 47 cases made of deodar wood constructed on site without nails that could potentially damage specimens and each case weighing about half a ton was transported down the hill to a bullock cart to Kalka and finally the port in Bombay. The material that went to the British Museum in 1885 consisted of 82,000 specimens of which 75,577 were finally placed in the museum. A breakup of that collection is as follows (old names retained). Hume had destroyed 20,000 specimens prior to this as they had been damaged by dermestid beetles. thumb * 2830 birds of prey (Accipitriformes)... 8 types * 1155 owls (Strigiformes)...9 types * 2819 crows, jays, orioles etc....5 types * 4493 cuckoo-shrikes and flycatchers... 21 types * 4670 thrushes and warblers...28 types * 3100 bulbuls and wrens, dippers, etc....16 types * 7304 timaliine birds...30 types * 2119 tits and shrikes...9 types * 1789 sun-birds (Nectarinidae) and white-eyes (Zosteropidae)...8 types * 3724 swallows (Hirundiniidae), wagtails and pipits (Motacillidae)...8 types * 2375 finches (Fringillidae)...8 types * 3766 starlings (Sturnidae), weaver-birds (Ploceidae), and larks (Alaudidae)...22 types * 807 ant-thrushes (Pittidae), broadbills (Eurylaimidae)...4 types * 1110 hoopoes (Upupae), swifts (Cypseli), nightjars (Caprimulgidae) and frogmouths (Podargidae)...8 types * 2277 Picidae, hornbills (Bucerotes), bee-eaters (Meropes), kingfishers (Halcyones), rollers(Coracidae), trogons (trogones)...11 types * 2339 woodpeckers (Pici)...3 types * 2417 honey-guides (Indicatores), barbets (Capiformes), and cuckoos (Coccyges)...8 types * 813 parrots (Psittaciformes)...3 types * 1615 pigeons (Columbiformes)...5 types * 2120 sand-grouse (Pterocletes), game-birds and megapodes(Galliformes)...8 types * 882 rails (Ralliformes), cranes (Gruiformes), bustards (Otides)...6 types * 1089 ibises (Ibididae), herons (Ardeidae), pelicans and cormorants (Steganopodes), grebes (Podicipediformes)...7 types * 761 geese and ducks (Anseriformes)...2 types * 15965 eggs Hadromys humei The Hume Collection contained 258 type specimens. In addition there were nearly 400 mammal specimens including new species such as Hadromys humei. The egg collection was made up of carefully authenticated contributions from knowledgeable contacts and on the authenticity and importance of the collection, E. W. Oates wrote in the 1901 Catalogue of the Collection of Birds' Eggs in the British Museum (Volume 1): Hume and his collector Davison took an interest in plants as well. Specimens were collected even on the first expedition to the Lakshadweep in 1875 were studied by George King and later by David Prain. Hume's herbarium specimens were donated to the collection of the Botanical Survey of India at Calcutta. =Taxa described= Hume described many species, some of which are now considered as subspecies. A single genus name that he erected survives in use while others such as Heteroglaux Hume, 1873 have sunk into synonymy since. In his concept of species, Hume was an essentialist and held the idea that small but constant differences defined species. He appreciated the ideas of speciation and how it contradicted divine creation but preferred to maintain a position that did not reject a Creator. ; Genera * Ocyceros Hume, 1873 ;Species * Anas albogularis (Hume, 1873) * Perdicula manipurensis Hume, 1881 * Arborophila mandellii Hume, 1874 * Syrmaticus humiae (Hume, 1881) * Puffinus persicus Hume, 1872 * Ardea insignis Hume, 1878 * Pseudibis davisoni (Hume, 1875) * Gyps himalayensis Hume, 1869 * Spilornis minimus Hume, 1873 * Buteo burmanicus Hume, 1875 * Sternula saundersi (Hume, 1877) * Columba palumboides (Hume, 1873) * Phodilus assimilis Hume, 1877 * Otus balli (Hume, 1873) * Otus brucei (Hume, 1872) * Strix butleri (Hume, 1878) * Heteroglaux blewitti Hume, 1873 * Ninox obscura Hume, 1872 * Tyto deroepstorffi (Hume, 1875) * Caprimulgus andamanicus Hume, 1873 * Aerodramus maximus (Hume, 1878) * Psittacula finschii (Hume, 1874) * Hydrornis oatesi Hume, 1873 * Hydrornis gurneyi (Hume, 1875) * Rhyticeros narcondami Hume, 1873 * Megalaima incognita Hume, 1874 * Podoces hendersoni Hume, 1871 * Podoces biddulphi Hume, 1874 * Pseudopodoces humilis (Hume, 1871) * Mirafra microptera Hume, 1873 * Alcippe dubia (Hume, 1874) * Stachyridopsis rufifrons (Hume, 1873) * Cyornis olivaceus Hume, 1877 * Oenanthe albonigra (Hume, 1872) * Dicaeum virescens Hume, 1873 * Pyrgilauda blanfordi (Hume, 1876) * Ploceus megarhynchus Hume, 1869 * Spinus thibetanus (Hume, 1872) * Carpodacus stoliczkae (Hume, 1874) * Gampsorhynchus torquatus Hume, 1874 * Sylvia minula Hume, 1873 * Sylvia althaea Hume, 1878 * Phylloscopus neglectus Hume, 1870 * Horornis brunnescens (Hume, 1872) * Yuhina humilis (Hume, 1877) * Pteruthius intermedius (Hume, 1877) * Certhia manipurensis Hume, 1881 * Calandrella acutirostris Hume, 1873 * Pycnonotus fuscoflavescens (Hume, 1873) * Pycnonotus erythropthalmos (Hume, 1878) ; Subspecies The use of trinomials had not yet gone into regular usage during Hume's time.

The status of the species was contested until DNA comparisons with similar species in 2002 suggested that it was a valid species. It was only in 2006 that the species was seen in the wild in Thailand, with a match to the specimens confirmed using DNA sequencing. Later searches in museums led to several other specimens that had been overlooked and based on the specimen localities, a breeding region was located in Tajikistan and documented in 2011. =My Scrap Book: Or Rough Notes on Indian Oology and Ornithology (1869)= Dedication of \\"My Scrap Book\\" to Blyth and Jerdon. This was Hume's first major work on birds. It had 422 pages and accounts of 81 species. It was dedicated to Edward Blyth and Dr. Thomas C. Jerdon who, he wrote [had] done more for Indian Ornithology than all other modern observers put together and he described himself as their friend and pupil. He hoped that his book would form a nucleus round which future observation may crystallize and that others around the country could help him fill in many of the woeful blanks remaining in record. In the preface he notes: =Stray Feathers= Hume started the quarterly journal Stray Feathers in 1872. At that time the only journal for the Indian region that published on ornithology was the Journal of the Asiatic Society of Bengal and Hume published only two letters in 1870, mainly being a list of errors in the list of Godwin-Austen which had been reduced to an abstract. He had wondered if there was merit to start a new journal and in that idea was supported by Stoliczka, who was an editor for the Journal of the Asiatic Society: Cover of Stray Feathers The President of the Asiatic Society of Bengal, Thomas Oldham, in the annual address for 1873 wrote - \\"We could have wished that the author had completed the several works which he had already commenced, rather than started a new publication. But we heartily welcome at the same time the issue of 'Stray Feathers.' It promises to be a useful catalogue of the Editor's very noble collection of Indian Birds, and a means of rapid publication of novelties or corrections, always of much value with ornithologists.\\" Hume used the journal to publish descriptions of his new discoveries. He wrote extensively on his own observation as well as critical reviews of all the ornithological works of the time and earned himself the nickname of Pope of Indian ornithology. He critiqued a monograph on parrots, Die Papageien by Friedrich Hermann Otto Finsch suggesting that name changes (by \\"cabinet naturalists\\") were aimed at claiming authority to species without the trouble of actually discovering them. He wrote: Hume in turn was attacked, for instance by Viscount Walden, but Finsch became a friend and Hume named a species, Psittacula finschii, after him. Hume was among the first to recognize an association between the avifaunal composition and rainfall distribution. This rainfall map was published in volume 8 of Stray Feathers (1878). In his younger days Hume had studied some geology from the likes of Gideon MantellWedderburn (1913):116. and appreciated the synthesis of ideas from other fields into ornithology. Hume included in 1872, a detailed article on the osteology of birds in relation to their classification written by Richard Lydekker who was then in the Geological Survey of India. The early meteorological work in India was done within the department headed by Hume and he saw the value of meteorology in the study of bird distributions. In a work comparing the rainfall zones, he notes how the high rainfall zones indicated affinities to the Malayan fauna. Hume sometimes mixed personal beliefs in notes that he published in Stray Feathers. For instance he believed that vultures soared by altering the physics (\\"altered polarity\\") of their body and repelling the force of gravity. He further noted that this ability was normal in birds and could be acquired by humans by maintaining spiritual purity claiming that he knew of at least three Indian Yogis and numerous saints in the past with this ability of aethrobacy. =Network of correspondents= Distribution and density of Hume's correspondents across India. Hume corresponded with a large number of ornithologists and sportsmen who helped him by reporting from various parts of India. More than 200 correspondents are listed in his Game Birds alone and they probably represent only a fraction of the subscribers of Stray Feathers. This large network made it possible for Hume to cover a much larger geographic region in his ornithological work. During the lifetime of Hume, Blyth was considered the father of Indian ornithology. Hume's achievement which made use of a large network of correspondents was recognised even during his time: Many of Hume's correspondents were eminent naturalists and sportsmen who were posted in India. * Leith Adams, Kashmir * Lieut.

A collection made principally by Hume that belonged to the Earl of Northbrook was gifted to Oxford University in 1877. One of his correspondents, Louis Mandelli from Darjeeling, stands out by claiming that he was swindled in these skin exchanges. He claimed that Hume took skins of rarer species in exchange for the skins of common birds but the credibility of the complaint has been doubted. Hume named Arborophila mandelli after Mandelli in 1874. The only other naturalist to question Hume's veracity was A.L. Butler who met a Nicobar islander whom Hume had described as diving nearly stark naked and capturing fish with his bare hands. Butler found the man in denial of such fishing techniques. Hume corresponded and stayed up to date with the works of ornithologists outside India including R. Bowdler Sharpe, the Marquis of Tweeddale, P√®re David, Henry Eeles Dresser, Benedykt Dybowski, John Henry Gurney, J. H. Gurney, Jr., Johann Friedrich Naumann, Nikolai Severtzov and Dr. Aleksandr Middendorff. He helped George Ernest Shelley with specimens from India aiding the publication of a monograph on the sunbirds of the world (1876‚Äì1880). =Collector's Vade Mecum (1874)= The Indian Ornithological Collector's Vade Mecum: containing brief practical instructions for collecting, preserving, packing and keeping specimens of birds, eggs, nests, feathers, and skeleton (1874) Hume's vast collection from across India was possible because he began to correspond with coadjutors across India. He ensured that these contributors made accurate notes, and obtained and processed specimens carefully. The Vade Mecum was published to save him the trouble of sending notes to potential collaborators who sought advice. Materials for preservation are carefully tailored for India with the provision of the local names for ingredients and methods to prepare glues and preservatives with easy to find equipment. Apart from skinning and preservation, the book also covers matters of observation, keeping records, the use of natives to capture birds, obtain eggs and the care needed in obtaining other information apart from care in labelling. =Game Birds of India, Burmah and Ceylon (1879‚Äì1881)= This work was co-authored by C. H. T. Marshall. The three volume work on the game birds was made using contributions and notes from a network of 200 or more correspondents. Hume delegated the task of getting the plates made to Marshall. The chromolithographs of the birds were drawn by W. Foster, E. Neale, (Miss) M. Herbert, Stanley Wilson and others and the plates were produced by F. Waller in London. Hume had sent specific notes on colours of soft parts and instructions to the artists. He was dissatisfied with many of the plates and included additional notes on the plates in the book. This book was started at the point when the government demoted Hume and only the need to finance the publication of this book prevented him from retiring from service. He had estimated that it would cost ‚Ç§ 4000 to publish it and he retired from service on 1 January 1882 after the publication. In the preface Hume wrote: while his co-author Marshall, wrote: Hume's comment on the illustration The plate is a cruel caricature of the species, just sufficiently like to permit of identification, but miscolored to a degree only explicable on the hypothesis of somebody's colour-blindness‚Ä¶ Fortunately for our supporters, this is the very worst plate in the three volumes. White-fronted goose One of the illustrations that Hume considered as exceptionally good. =Nests and Eggs of Indian Birds (1883)= This was another major work by Hume and in it he covered descriptions of the nests, eggs and the breeding seasons of most Indian bird species. It makes use of notes from contributors to his journals as well as other correspondents and works of the time. Hume also makes insightful notes such as observations on caged females separated from males that would continue to lay fertile eggs through the possibility of sperm storage and the reduction in parental care by birds that laid eggs in warm locations (mynas in the Andamans, river terns on sand banks). A second edition of this book was made in 1889 which was edited by Eugene William Oates. This was published when he had himself given up all interest in ornithology. An event precipitated by the loss of his manuscripts through the actions of a servant. He wrote in the preface: Eugene Oates wrote his own editorial note: This nearly marked the end of Hume's interest in ornithology. Hume's last piece of ornithological writing was part of an Introduction to the Scientific Results of the Second Yarkand Mission in 1891, an official publication on the contributions of Dr. Ferdinand Stoliczka, who died during the return journey on this mission. Stoliczka in a dying request had asked that Hume edit the volume on ornithology. =Taxa named after Hume= A number of birds are named after Hume, including: *Hume's ground tit, Pseudopodoces humilis *Hume's wheatear, Oenanthe albonigra *Hume's hawk-owl, Ninox obscura *Hume's short-toed lark, Calandrella acutirostris * Hume's leaf warbler, Phylloscopus humei *Hume's whitethroat, Sylvia althaea *Hume's treecreeper, Certhia manipurensis Specimens of other animal groups collected by Hume on his expeditions and named after him include the Manipur bush rat, Hadromys humei (Thomas, 1886) while some others like Hylaeocarcinus humei, a land crab from the Narcondam Island collected by Hume was described by James Wood-Mason, and Hume's argali, Ovis ammon humei Lydekker 1913Lydekker (1913):6‚Äì7 (now treated as Ovis ammon karelini, Severtzov, 1873) are no longer considered valid. Theosophy A vice-president of the Vegetarian Society Hume's interest in theosophy took root around 1879. An 1880 newspaper reports the initiation of his daughter and wife into the movement. Hume did not have great regard for institutional Christianity, but believed in the immortality of the soul and in the idea of a supreme ultimate. Hume wanted to become a chela (student) of the Tibetan spiritual gurus. During the few years of his connection with the Theosophical Society Hume wrote three articles on Fragments of Occult Truth under the pseudonym \\"H. X.\\" published in The Theosophist. These were written in response to questions from Mr. Terry, an Australian Theosophist. He also privately printed several Theosophical pamphlets titled Hints on Esoteric Theosophy. The later numbers of the Fragments, in answer to the same enquirer, were written by A.P. Sinnett and signed by him, as authorized by Mahatma K. H., A Lay-Chela. Hume also wrote under the pseudonym of \\"Aletheia\\". Madame Blavatsky was a regular visitor at Hume's Rothney castle at Simla and an account of her visit may be found in Simla, Past and Present by Edward John Buck (whose father Sir Edward Charles Buck succeeded Mr. Hume's role in the Revenue and Agricultural Department). A long story about Hume and his wife appears in A.P. Sinnett's book The Occult World, and the synopsis was published in a local paper of India. The story relates how at a dinner party, Madame Blavatsky asked Mrs Hume if there was anything she wanted. She replied that there was a brooch, her mother had given her, that had gone out of her possession some time ago. Blavatsky said she would try to recover it through occult means. After some interlude, later that evening, the brooch was found in a garden, where the party was directed by Blavatsky. According to John Murdoch (1894), the brooch had been given by Mrs. Hume to her daughter who had given it to a man she admired. Blavatsky had happened to meet the man in Bombay and obtained the brooch in return for money. Blavatsky allegedly planted it in the garden before directing people to the location through what she claimed as occult techniques. After the incident, Hume too had privately expressed grave doubts on the powers attributed to Madame Blavatsky. He subsequently held a meeting with some of the Indian members of the Theosophical Society and suggested that they join hands with him to force the resignation of Blavatsky and sixteen other members for their role as accomplices in fraud. Those present could however not agree to the idea of seeking the resignation of their founder. Hume also tried to write a book on the philosophical basis of Theosophy. His drafts were strongly disapproved by many of the key Theosophists. One (\\"K.H\\"=Koot Humi) wrote: Hume soon fell out of favour with the Theosophists and lost all interest in the theosophical movement in 1883. Hume's interest in spirituality brought him into contact with many independent Indian thinkers who also had nationalist ideas and this led to the idea of creating the Indian National Congress. Hume's immersion into the theosophical movement led him to become a vegetarian and also to give up killing birds for their specimens. Indian National Congress Hume at the first session, Bombay, 28‚Äì31 December 1885 Hume on a 1973 stamp of India After retiring from the civil services and towards the end of Lord Lytton's rule, Hume observed that the people of India had a sense of hopelessness and wanted to do something, noting \\"a sudden violent outbreak of sporadic crime, murders of obnoxious persons, robbery of bankers and looting of bazaars, acts really of lawlessness which by a due coalescence of forces might any day develop into a National Revolt.\\" Concerning the British government, he stated that a studied and invariable disregard, if not actually contempt for the opinions and feelings of our subjects, is at the present day the leading characteristic of our government in every branch of the administration.Hume to Northbrook, 1 August 1872, Northbrook Papers, cited in Mehrotra 2005. There were agrarian riots in the Deccan and Bombay, and Hume suggested that an Indian Union would be a good safety valve and outlet to avoid further unrest. On 1 March 1883 he wrote a letter to the graduates of the University of Calcutta: Wedderburn (right) and Dadabhai Naoroji His poem The Old Man's Hope published in Calcutta in 1886 also captures the sentiment:Cited in Mehrotra 2005:75 > Sons of Ind, why sit ye idle, Wait ye for some Deva's aid? Buckle to, be up > and doing! Nations by themselves are made! Are ye Serfs or are ye Freemen, > Ye that grovel in the shade? In your own hands rest the issues! By > themselves are nations made! ... The idea of the Indian National Union took shape and Hume initially had some support from Lord Dufferin for this, although the latter wished to have no official link to it. Dufferin's support was short-lived and in some of his letters he went so far as to call Hume an \\"idiot\\", \\"arch-impostor\\", and \\"mischievous busy-body.\\" Dufferin's successor Lansdowne refused to have any dialogue with Hume. Other supporters in England included James Caird (who had also clashed with Lytton over the management of famine in India) and John Bright.Wedderburn (1913):54. Hume also founded an Indian Telegraph Union to fund the transfer of news of Indian matters to newspapers in England and Scotland without interference from British Indian officials who controlled telegrams sent by Reuters.Wedderburn (1913):55. It has been suggested that the idea of the congress was originally conceived in a private meeting of seventeen men after a Theosophical Convention held at Madras in December 1884 but no evidence exists. Hume took the initiative, and it was in March 1885, when a notice was first issued to convene the first Indian National Union to meet at Poona the following December. He attempted to increase the Congress base by bringing in more farmers, townspeople and Muslims between 1886 and 1887 and this created a backlash from the British, leading to backtracking by the Congress. Hume was disappointed when Congress opposed moves to raise the age of marriage for Indian girls and failed to focus on issues of poverty. Some Indian princes did not like the idea of democracy and some organizations like the United Indian Patriotic Association went about trying to undermine the Congress by showing it as an organization with a seditious character. In 1892, he tried to get them to act by warning of a violent agrarian revolution but this only outraged the British establishment and frightened the Congress leaders. Disappointed by the continued lack of Indian leaders willing to work for the cause of national emancipation, Hume left India in 1894. Many Anglo- Indians were against the idea of the Indian National Congress. The press in India tended to look upon it negatively, so much so that Hume is said to have held a very low opinion of journalists even later in life. A satirical work published in 1888 included a character called \\"A. O. Humebogue\\". The organizers of the 27th session of the Indian National Congress at Bankipur (26‚Äì28 December 1912) recorded their \\"profound sorrow at the death of Allan Octavian Hume, C.B., father and founder of the Congress, to whose lifelong services, rendered at rare self-sacrifice, India feels deep and lasting gratitude, and in whose death the cause of Indian progress and reform sustained irreparable loss.\\"Wedderburn (1913):176. South London Botanical Institute Bookplate of Hume with the motto Industria et Perseverantia After the loss of his manuscript containing his lifetime of ornithological notes. Hume took up a great interest in horticulture while at Shimla. > ... He erected large conservatories in the grounds of Rothney Castle, filled > them with the choicest flowers, and engaged English gardeners to help him in > the work. From this, on returning to England, he went on to scientific > botany. But this, as Kipling says, is another story, and must be left to > another pen.Wedderburn (1913):43, quoting CHT Marshall Herbarium cabinets at the SLBI Hume took an interest in wild plants and especially on invasive species although his botanical publishing was sparse with only a few short notes in 1901 on a variety of Scirpus maritimus and another on the flowering of Impatiens roylei. Hume contacted W.H. Griffin in 1901 to help develop a herbarium of botanical specimens. Hume would arrange his plants on herbarium sheets in artistic positions before pressing them. The two made many botanical trips including one to Down in Kent to seek some of the rare orchids that had been collected by Darwin.Wedderburn (1913):113‚Äì115. In 1910, Hume bought the premises of 323 Norwood Road, and modified it to have a herbarium and library. He called this establishment the South London Botanical Institute (SLBI) with the aim of \\"promoting, encouraging, and facilitating, amongst the residents of South London, the study of the science of botany.\\" One of the aims of the institute was to help promote botany as a means for mental culture and relaxation, an idea that was not shared by Henry Groves, a trustee for the Institute. Hume objected to advertisement and refused to have any public ceremony to open the institute. The first curator was W.H. Griffin and Hume endowed the Institute with ¬£10,000. Frederick Townsend, F.L.S., an eminent botanist, who died in 1905, had left instructions that his herbarium and collection was to be given to the institute, which was then only being contemplated.Wedderburn (1913):118‚Äì121 Hume left ¬£15,000 in his will for the maintenance of the botanical institute. Herbarium sheets showing Hume's artistic arrangements In the years leading up to the establishment of the Institute, Hume built up links with many of the leading botanists of his day. He worked with F. H. Davey and in the Flora of Cornwall (1909), Davey thanks Hume as his companion on excursions in Cornwall and Devon, and for help in the compilation of the 'Flora', publication of which was financed by Hume. The SLBI has since grown to hold a herbarium of approximately 100,000 specimens mostly of flowering plants from Europe including many collected by Hume. The collection was later augmented by the addition of other herbaria over the years, and has significant collections of Rubus (bramble) species and of the Shetland flora.

It is considered as one of the largest towns in the United Kingdom without a railway station. Historically in Worcestershire, the town is around from Birmingham city centre, and from Dudley town centre. The population of the town, as measured by the United Kingdom Census 2011, was 58,135.City Population Portal Retrieved 29 May 2017 Halesowen is included in the Halesowen and Rowley Regis constituency which is held by the Conservative James Morris. Geography and administration Halesowen was a detached part of the county of Shropshire but was incorporated into Worcestershire in 1844 by the Counties (Detached Parts) Act. Since the local government reorganisation of 1974 it has formed a part of the West Midlands Metropolitan county and Conurbation, in the Dudley Metropolitan Borough, which it joined at the same time as neighbouring Stourbridge, which had also been in Worcestershire until that point. Halesowen is located approximately southwest of central Birmingham at the edge of the West Midlands conurbation. Although predominantly urban or suburban in character, Halesowen borders on green belt land with excellent access to the countryside, for example the Clent Hills. It has extensive road links including Junction 3 of the M5 motorway, which allow easy commuting to Birmingham, other areas of the Black County or nationwide. The centre of Birmingham is approximately 30 minutes away by car and reachable by the number 9 bus. The centre of Halesowen is home to a Norman church, a football ground (where non-league Halesowen Town play) and Halesowen College which was founded in 1939. Most of the housing stock in Halesowen is privately owned and was built in the 30 years which followed the end of the Second World War, although some parts of the town are still made up of Victorian and Edwardian terraced houses. The town centre was almost completely rebuilt during the 1960s and 1970s. =Suburbs= In 1974, Dudley Metropolitan Borough Council identified six historical suburbs, within Halesowen, which they signed accordingly with a series of gateway signs. In addition to the town centre, these are listed below. A separate sign for Illey was added many years later. * Cradley * Hasbury * Hawne * Hayley Green * Hill & Cakemore * Lapal Climate As with the rest of the British Isles and West Midlands, Halesowen experiences a maritime climate with cool summers and mild winters. A weather station provides local climate data for the period 1981‚Äì2010. Temperature extremes at Halesowen have ranged from during December 1981 up to during July 2006. History Halesowen is recorded in the Domesday Book of 1086 as being larger than Birmingham. The manor and town was known as Hala (from the Anglo-Saxon word \\"halh\\", meaning nook or remote valley), until it was gifted by King Henry II to Welsh Prince David Owen and became known as Halas Owen. The parish of Halesowen, which incorporated other townships later to become independent parishes, was an exclave of the county of Shropshire, but grew to become a town and was transferred to the jurisdiction of Worcestershire by the Counties (Detached Parts) Act 1844. Included in the boundaries was the ancient village of Brettle. In the 1220s, Halesowen had a market and fair and, by 1270, it had been granted a charter of liberties by its lord, the Premonstratensian Abbey of Halesowen. By 1300, it is estimated that the population was around 600. The court rolls for Halesowen survive from 1272 and show that the majority of migrants to Halesowen in the 14th century were women at 75%. Little was done to remove them and many went on to become small retailers in the area. The village is well known by medieval historians for the conflict that took place around this time. In 1279, as the Abbot attempted to increase labour services for his tenants (which had been fixed in 1244), the peasants attempted to plead their case in the King's Court, a privilege forbidden to unfree villeins. The Abbot thus fined them ¬£10 which was a large sum at the time, and resistance, led by Roger Ketel, heightened. The conflict was snuffed out in 1282 as Ketel and Alice Edrich (the pregnant wife of another prominent rebel) were murdered by thugs hired by the abbey. During the 18th century Halesowen developed rapidly as a result of the Industrial Revolution. The manufacture of nails was the staple trade in the town and many mills were used for slitting and iron production. Coal had been mined in the area from at least the reign of Edward I. Dating to 1893, Coombes Wood was the largest colliery in the town; at its peak in 1919 Halesowen had 130 working mines. During the French Revolutionary War Halesowen raised a troop of volunteer cavalry by 1798, which in 1814 became part of the South Shropshire Yeomanry Cavalry. Halesowen became the centre of a poor law union in the 19th century, which later became established as a rural sanitary district and later the Halesowen Rural District in 1894. Oldbury was included into the area of Halesowen under an Act of 1829. With increasing urbanisation of the area, in the early 20th century, it became the Halesowen Urban District in 1925, and obtained a grant of charter to become a municipal borough in 1936. In 1974, under the Local Government Act 1972, Halesowen was incorporated into the new Dudley Metropolitan Borough, in the Metropolitan county of the West Midlands. Halesowen was once served by a railway line ‚Äì in reality two lines which met at an end-on junction at the station. The first was a branch of the Great Western Railway from Old Hill to Halesowen, opened in 1878, followed in 1883 by a section jointly owned by the Great Western and the Midland Railway (though worked mostly by the latter), linking the town with Northfield on the Midland Railway's Birmingham to Bristol main line, with intermediate stations at Rubery, Hunnington, and a workmen's halt at Longbridge serving the car factories (not to be confused with the present Longbridge station). Being largely rural in character, the line failed to attract much traffic and regular passenger services ended between Halesowen and Northfield as far back as 1919, and between Old Hill and Halesowen in 1927, though the workmen's trains continued to serve Longbridge until 1960. The line is now lifted, but the track-bed can be seen close to the town, although there is no sign of the station. The goods shed remained until recently, serving as an industrial unit though it has now been demolished. In the 1960s, the town centre underwent vast redevelopment which saw most of the older buildings demolished. The high street was pedestrianised and a shopping precinct (called \\"The Precinct\\") was developed, housing many new retail units as well as a new public library. The centre was refurbished in the late 1980s and placed undercover, being renamed The Cornbow Centre at this time. Trade in the town centre declined between 1985 and 1990 as the Merry Hill Shopping Centre some away at Brierley Hill was developed, although not as severely as it declined in Stourbridge and in particular Dudley. The only high-profile casualty was the J Sainsbury supermarket, which closed in 1992 due to the popularity of the store which had opened at Merry Hill three years earlier to succeed the Dudley store ‚Äì combined with the onset of the recession at the start of the 1990s. A further upgrading of the town centre took place in 2007 and 2008, with part of the Cornbow Centre (including a petrol station and several smaller retail units) being demolished to make way for a new Asda superstore which opened on 24 November 2008. The bus station was also rebuilt. This 18-month ¬£30 million project was completed in December 2008 and the town received a commendation for the work by the Retail Property Organisation. Landmarks Halesowen Abbey In the eastern part of Halesowen is Leasowes Park, which is considered to be one of the first natural landscape gardens in England. The 18th century poet William Shenstone designed the garden, beginning works in 1743 and continuing until his death in 1763, transforming existing farmland he had inherited after his parents' death. Today, the parkland is Grade One Listed, as it is of national importance. The local theatre and a Wetherspoon's public house are both named after William Shenstone as are at least two roads in the locality. The Parish Church of St John the Baptist was founded by Roger de Montgomery and stands on the site of an even earlier Anglo-Saxon church. Several extensions have been made including the outer south aisle which was added in 1883 by John Oldrid ScottThe Buildings of England: Worcestershire, Nikolaus Pevsner, 1968 Penguin. p180 although there is still much evidence of the original Norman work. A Medieval cross stands in the churchyard, having previously stood in Great Cornbow until it was blown down by a gale in 1908. Nearby are the ruins of Halesowen Abbey, founded in 1215 by Peter des Roches, Bishop of Winchester. The Dissolution of the Monasteries saw the Abbey pass into private hands in 1538. The Abbey was the subject of an archaeological evaluation by Birmingham Archaeology and is now owned and managed by English Heritage. Most of the town centre was rebuilt in the 1960s to create a modern shopping area that incorporated a new library as well as many supermarkets and shops centred around the Cornbow Centre. This was refurbished in the late 1980s to create a covered shopping area. In 2007‚Äì08, Halesowen underwent a ¬£30 million regeneration of part of its town centre, which has included the construction of a new Asda supermarket located in the Cornbow Centre, together with a new multi-storey car park, a rebuilt bus station and improvements to the road layout. Economy The principal industry of Halesowen was traditionally nail making, an industry that was performed on a small scale individually in the backyards of a large number of nail makers. Halesowen also had, along with most other areas of the Black Country, a large number of above and underground coal mines. In more recent years, the arrival of a junction of the motorway network allowed Halesowen to attract a number of large organisations to the town. Sandvik's UK headquarters are located here as well as Somers Forge, mFortune, SomersTotalKare and the Mucklow Group. Communicourt are the leading providers of Non-registered Intermediaries to the criminal and family courts and its headquarters are in Halesowen Transport Transport in the town is overseen by Transport for West Midlands, the county's transport authority. Halesowen, as mentioned above, is no longer served by a railway station. It is however served by a fairly comprehensive bus network, and is on the Hagley Road Bus Corridor from Birmingham to Stourbridge (route 9), the Merry Hill Shopping Centre (route 002,13, 17 and X10) and Dudley (route 14). Halesowen Bus Station is located on Queensway, next to the Asda supermarket and Job Centre Plus. The nearest railway stations to Halesowen are Stourbridge Junction, Cradley Heath and Old Hill. Education There are currently 14 primary schools, 3 secondary schools and a further education college situated within the district of Halesowen. Newfield Park Primary School primary school located in Halesowen, was built during the 1960s to serve the expanding local area of Hawne. In 1972, when still a borough in its own right, Halesowen Council abolished the traditional infant and junior schools and replaced them with first schools for ages 5 to 9 and middle schools for the 9 to 13 age group, but this system was abolished in 1982 and reverted to the previous infant schools for 5 to 7 year olds and junior schools for ages 7 to 11. It was one of the first instances of three-tier education being abolished in favour of a return to traditional age ranges, though most areas which adopted the system have since reverted to the traditional age ranges. The rest of the Dudley Metropolitan Borough consisted of 5‚Äì8 first and 8‚Äì12 middle schools (barring Stourbridge and Kingswinford, which had both retained the traditional 5‚Äì7 infant and 7‚Äì11 junior schools) until following the suit of Halesowen and reverting to the traditional ranges in 1990. =Primary schools= * Caslon Primary School * Colley Lane Primary School *Cradley Church of England Primary School * Halesowen Church of England Primary School * Hasbury Church of England Primary School * Howley Grange Primary School * Huntingtree Primary School * Hurst Green Primary School * Lapal Primary School * Lutley Primary School * Manor Way Primary School * Newfield Park Primary School * Olive Hill Primary School * Our Lady and St. Kenelm Roman Catholic Primary School * Tenterfields Primary School =Special needs school= * Halesbury Special School =Secondary schools= * Windsor High School * Leasowes High School * Earls High School =Further education= * Halesowen College * Windsor High School Sixth Form =Defunct schools= Richmond Boys School and Walton Girls School were merged in September 1983 to form Windsor High School, a mixed 11-16 comprehensive school based at an expanded Richmond site, while the Walton site was annexed into Halesowen College until it was sold off for a housing development 18 years later. Media Halesowen is served by local editions of two regional evening papers, the Birmingham-based Evening Mail and the Wolverhampton-based Express & Star. There are two local free weekly newspapers delivered to every household in Halesowen, The Halesowen News and The Halesowen Chronicle. The Halesowen area is served by the following local and regional radio stations: * BBC WM: local FM station broadcasting local news, sport and music from the BBC studios at the Mailbox in Birmingham * Free Radio West Midlands: local FM commercial CHR music station for Birmingham and the Black Country and Shropshire broadcast from studios in Birmingham and Manchester * Heart West Midlands: regional FM commercial Hot AC music station broadcast from studios in Birmingham and London * Smooth Radio West Midlands: regional FM adult contemporary commercial music station broadcast from studios in Birmingham and London * Capital Midlands: local FM commercial contemporary hit music station for Birmingham broadcast from studios in Birmingham and London * Black Country Radio: local FM community station broadcast from studios in Stourbridge * Greatest Hits West Midlands: regional FM station broadcasting music from across the decades from studios in Birmingham, Liverpool, Manchester and London * Radio XL: regional AM Asian station broadcast from studios in Birmingham * BBC Asian Network: national digital Asian station available on AM in the West Midlands Leisure Halesowen has a rugby team called Old Halesonians (R.F.C) football team, non-league Halesowen Town F.C., as well as cricket (including Halesowen Cricket Club), hockey (Old Halesonians Hockey Club) and golf clubs. Halesowen is home to two Campaign for Real Ale (CAMRA) Good Beer Guide listed pubs, the 'Hawne Tavern' and the 'Waggon and Horses,' both of which have won the local CAMRA branch Pub of the Year accolade in 2005 and 2006 respectively. The 'Waggon and Horses' has also won the West Midlands County Pub of the Year Award for 2006, beating pubs from the Black Country, Birmingham, Solihull and Coventry. The Somers Sports and Social Club has won CAMRA's national Club of the Year award three times, in 2000, 2001 and 2002,CAMRA web site and Coombes Wood Sports and Social Club has won branch and regional awards. Both clubs are also listed in CAMRA's Good Beer Guide. =Sports= Football Halesowen Town F.C. are the town's non-league football club who play their matches at The Grove on Old Hawne Lane. They currently play in the Southern League Division One Central. Cricket Halesowen Cricket Club are based at Seth Somers Park just off the A456 Manor Way. The club operates four teams competing in the Birmingham and District Premier League and the Worcestershire County League. Rugby Union Old Halesonians RFC are based at Wassell Grove on the outskirts of Hagley.

Named after Saint Edward the Confessor, it has been traditionally used to crown English and British monarchs at their coronations since the 13th century. The original crown was a holy relic kept at Westminster Abbey, Edward's burial place, until the regalia was either sold or melted down when Parliament abolished the monarchy in 1649, during the English Civil War. The present version of St Edward's Crown was made for Charles II in 1661. It is solid gold, tall, weighs , and is decorated with 444 precious and semi- precious stones. The crown is similar in weight and overall appearance to the original, but its arches are Baroque. After 1689, it was not used to crown a monarch for over 200 years. In 1911, the tradition was revived by George V, and all subsequent monarchs (except Edward VIII who was not crowned at all) have been crowned using St Edward's Crown. A stylised image of this crown is used on coats of arms, badges, logos and various other insignia in the Commonwealth realms to symbolise the royal authority of Queen Elizabeth II. When not in use, St Edward's Crown is on public display in the Jewel House at the Tower of London. Description St Edward's Crown is 22-carat gold, with a circumference of ,Twining, p. 168. measures tall, and weighs . It has four fleurs-de-lis and four crosses patt√©e, supporting two dipped arches topped by a monde and cross patt√©e, the arches and monde signifying an imperial crown. Its purple velvet cap is trimmed with ermine. It is set with 444 precious and semi-precious stones, including 345 rose-cut aquamarines, 37 white topazes, 27 tourmalines, 12 rubies, 7 amethysts, 6 sapphires, 2 jargoons, 1 garnet, 1 spinel and 1 carbuncle. Usage Although it is regarded as the official coronation crown, only six monarchs have been crowned with St Edward's Crown since the Restoration: Charles II (1661), James II (1685), William III (1689), George V (1911), George VI (1937) and Elizabeth II (1953). Mary II and Anne were crowned with small diamond crowns of their own; George I, George II, George III and William IV with the State Crown of George I; George IV with a large new diamond crown made specially for the occasion; and Queen Victoria and Edward VII chose not to use St. Edward's Crown because of its weight and instead used the lighter 1838 version of the Imperial State Crown. When not used to crown the monarch, St Edward's Crown was placed on the altar during the coronation; however, it did not feature at all at the coronation of Queen Victoria.Mears, et al., p. 23. =In heraldry= St Edward's Crown is widely used as a heraldic emblem of the United Kingdom, being incorporated into a multitude of emblems and insignia. As the United Kingdom is a constitutional monarchy with responsible government, the crown can also symbolise \\"the sovereignty (or authority) of the monarch.\\" It can be found on, amongst others, the Royal Cypher; the Royal Arms of the United Kingdom; the Royal Badges of England; and the badges of the police forces of England and Wales, Her Majesty's Coastguard, the British Army, the Royal Marines, the Royal Air Force and HM Revenue and Customs. It also forms the logo of Royal Mail, the United Kingdom's postal service.Moncreiffe, and Pottinger, pp. 38-46. (In Scotland, the Crown of Scotland may appear in place of St Edward's Crown). History =Origin= King Edward the Confessor wearing a crown in the first scene of the Bayeux Tapestry Edward the Confessor wore his crown at Easter, Whitsun, and Christmas. In 1161, he was made a saint, and objects connected with his reign became holy relics. The monks at his burial place of Westminster Abbey claimed that Edward had asked them to look after his regalia in perpetuity for the coronations of all future English kings.Keay, pp. 18‚Äì20. Although the claim is likely to have been an exercise in self-promotion on the abbey's part, and some of the regalia probably had been taken from Edward's grave when he was reinterred there, it became accepted as fact, thereby establishing the first known set of hereditary coronation regalia in Europe.Rose, p. 13. A crown referred to as St Edward's Crown is first recorded as having been used for the coronation of Henry III in 1220, and it appears to be the same crown worn by Edward.Ronald Lightbown in Blair, vol. 1. pp. 257‚Äì353. =Holy relic= An early description of the crown is \\"King Alfred's Crown of gold wire-work set with slight stones and two little bells\\", weighing and valued at ¬£248 in total.Twining, p. 132. It was sometimes called King Alfred's Crown because of an inscription on the lid of its box, which, translated from Latin, read: \\"This is the chief crown of the two, with which were crowned Kings Alfred, Edward and others\\". However, there is no evidence to support the belief that it dated from Alfred's time, and in the coronation order it always has been referred to as St Edward's Crown.Holmes, p. 216. St Edward's Crown rarely left Westminster Abbey, but when Richard II was forced to abdicate in 1399, he had the crown brought to the Tower of London, where he symbolically handed it to Henry IV, saying \\"I present and give to you this crown with which I was crowned king of England and all the rights dependent on it\\".Steane, p. 34. It was used in 1533 to crown the second wife of Henry VIII, Anne Boleyn, which was unprecedented for a queen consort. In the Tudor period, three crowns were placed on the heads of monarchs at a coronation: St Edward's Crown, the state crown, and a \\"rich crown\\" made specially for the king or queen.Arnold, pp. 731‚Äì732. After the English Reformation, the new Church of England denounced the veneration of medieval relics and, starting with the coronation of Edward VI in 1547, the significance of St Edward's Crown as a holy relic was played down in the ceremony.Ronald Lightbown in MacGregor, p. 257. During the English Civil War, Parliament sold the medieval St Edward's Crown, regarded by Oliver Cromwell as symbolic of the \\"detestable rule of kings\\". =Restoration= St. Edward's Crown as it looked at the coronation of James II of England in 1685 The monarchy was restored in 1660 and in preparation for the coronation of Charles II, who had been living in exile abroad, a new St Edward's Crown was supplied by the Royal Goldsmith, Sir Robert Vyner. It was fashioned to closely resemble the medieval crown, with a heavy gold base and clusters of semi-precious stones, but the arches are decidedly Baroque.Holmes, pp. 213‚Äì223. In the late 20th century, it was assumed to incorporate gold from the original St Edward's Crown, as they are almost identical in weight, and no invoice was produced for the materials in 1661. A crown was also displayed at the lying in state of Oliver Cromwell, Lord Protector of England from 1653 until 1658. On the weight of this evidence, writer and historian Martin Holmes, in a 1959 paper for Archaeologia, concluded that in the time of the Interregnum St Edward's Crown was saved from the melting pot and that its gold was used to make a new crown at the Restoration.Barclay, pp. 149‚Äì170. His theory became accepted wisdom, and many books, including official guidebooks for the Crown Jewels at the Tower of London, repeated his claim as fact. In 2008, new research found that a coronation crown and sceptre were made in 1660 in anticipation of an early coronation, which had to be delayed several times. His other regalia were commissioned in 1661 after Parliament increased the budget as a token of their appreciation for the king. The crown at Cromwell's lying in state was probably made of gilded base metal such as tin or copper, as was usual in 17th-century England; for example, a crown displayed at the funeral of James VI and I had cost only ¬£5 and was decorated with fake jewels. In 1671, Thomas Blood briefly stole the crown from the Tower of London, flattening it with a mallet in an attempt to conceal it. A new monde was created for the coronation of James II, and for William III the base was changed from a circle to an oval. After the coronation of William III in 1689, monarchs chose to be crowned with a lighter, bespoke coronation crown (e.g., the Coronation Crown of George IV)Dixon-Smith, et al., p. 61. or their state crown, while St Edward's Crown usually rested on the high altar.Mears, p. 23. =20th century to present day= Monogram of Elizabeth II Edward VII intended to revive the tradition of being crowned with St. Edward's Crown in 1902, but on coronation day he was still recovering from an operation for appendicitis, and instead he wore the lighter Imperial State Crown.Rose, p. 35. Jewels were hired for use in the crown and removed after the coronation until 1911, when it was permanently set with 444 precious and semi-precious stones. Imitation pearls on the arches and base were replaced with gold beads which at the time were platinum- plated.Rose, p. 29. Its band was also made smaller to fit George V, the first monarch to be crowned with St Edward's Crown in over 200 years, reducing the crown's overall weight from to . It was used to crown his successor George VI in 1937, and Queen Elizabeth II in 1953, who adopted a stylised image of the crown for use on coats of arms, badges, logos and various other insignia in the Commonwealth realms to symbolise her royal authority. In these contexts, it replaced the Tudor Crown, which had been instated by Edward VII in 1901. Use of the crown's image in this way is by permission of the monarch. On 4 June 2013, St Edward's Crown was displayed on the high altar in Westminster Abbey at a service to mark the 60th anniversary of Elizabeth II's coronation, which was the first time it had left the Jewel House at the Tower of London since 1953.

It was the last of three consecutive music festivals to take place on the island between 1968 and 1970 and widely acknowledged as the largest musical event of its time, greater than the attendance of Woodstock. Although estimates vary, the Guinness World Records estimated 600,000, possibly 700,000 people attended. It was organised and promoted by local brothers, Ron and Ray Foulk through their company Fiery Creations Ltd and their brother Bill Foulk. Ron Smith was site manager and Rikki Farr acted as compere. The preceding Isle of Wight Festivals, also promoted by the Foulks, had already gained a good reputation in 1968 and 1969 by featuring acts such as Jefferson Airplane, T. Rex, the Move, the Pretty Things, Joe Cocker, the Moody Blues (performed at the 1969 festival), the Who, and Bob Dylan in his first performance since his 1966 motorcycle accident. Many excerpts from this festival have appeared on record and video. Artists lineup The 1970 version, following Woodstock in the previous year, set out to move one step forward and enlisted Jimi Hendrix. With Hendrix confirmed, artists such as Cactus, Chicago, the Doors, Lighthouse, the Moody Blues, the Who, Miles Davis, Joan Baez, Joni Mitchell, Jethro Tull, Sly and the Family Stone, Ten Years After, Emerson, Lake & Palmer and Free also took part. The event had a magnificent but impractical site, since the prevailing wind blew the sound sideways across the venue, and the sound system had to be augmented by the Who's own PA. Organizers also faced the logistical problems involved in transporting some 600,000 people onto an island with a population of fewer than 100,000. The Island's transport services were already stretched by the annual influx of summer holiday-makers at the same time. French anarchists armed with knives were already causing trouble on the ferry crossing. Political and logistical difficulties resulted in the organisers eventually realising that the festival would not make a profit and declaring it to be \\"a free festival\\", although the majority of the audience had paid for tickets in advance, and the event was filmed contemporaneously. The commercial failings of the festival ensured it was the last event of its kind on the Isle of Wight for thirty-two years. Planning difficulties The opposition to the proposed 1970 festival from the residents of the Isle of Wight was much better coordinated than it had been in previous years. The Isle of Wight was a favourite retirement destination of the British well-heeled, and a haven of the yachting set, and many of the traditional residents deplored the huge influx of \\"hippies\\" and \\"freaks\\". This led to the introduction of sections to the \\"Isle of Wight County Council Act 1971\\" designed to control any further large overnight gatherings.Isle of Wight County Council Act 1971, c.lxxi, ss.5-6 Renting a few acres of suitable farmland to hold a music festival had in earlier years been a simple commercial matter between the promoters and one of the local farmers, but by 1970 this had become subject to approval decisions from several local council committees who were heavily lobbied by residents' associations opposing the festival. As a result of this public scrutiny, the preferred ideal location for the third Festival was blocked, and the promoters in the end had no choice but to accept the only venue on offer by the authorities: East Afton Farm, Afton Down. One unintended result of this choice of location was that, since it was overlooked by a large hill, a significant number of people were able to watch the proceedings for free.

Due to poor sound, the audience was unable to hear his set, and it appeared that they were jeering him. He was eventually booed off the stage because the audience could not properly hear his song \\"Blame It on the Stones\\" and ignorant members of the audience assumed he was criticising the Rolling Stones and the whole youth movement. \\"It was a total disaster,\\" Kristofferson recalled. \\"They just hated us. They hated everything. They booed us, Joni Mitchell, Joan Baez, Sly Stone; they threw shit at Jimi Hendrix. At the end of the night, they were tearing down the outer walls, setting fire to the concessions, burning their tents, shouting obscenities. Peace and love it was not.\\"Bell, Max: \\"Q&A;: Kris Kristofferson\\"; Classic Rock #148, August 2010, p34 *Mighty Baby: psychedelic rock band. =Thursday 27th= *Gary Farr: The brother of Rikki Farr, Gary had been the front man of the T-Bones, an R&B; combo that featured Keith Emerson on keyboards.

When Joe was hauled off by Joni's manager, the audience began to boo until Mitchell made an emotional appeal to them for some respect for the performers. Contrary to popular belief, Joe was not the man who was ranting about a \\"psychedelic concentration camp\\". That was another incident that took place the previous day. After the crowd quieted down, Mitchell closed her set with \\"Both Sides Now\\" and returned to the stage for an encore singing two more songs for an appreciative crowd. Her set is featured on the DVD Joni Mitchell Both Sides Now: Live at the Isle of Wight Festival 1970, released in 2018. *Tiny Tim: His rendition of \\"There'll Always Be an England\\" can be seen in the film Message to Love. *Miles Davis: A DVD of his complete set was released in 2004. \\"Call It Anythin'\\" was included on The First Great Rock Festivals of the Seventies album. *Ten Years After: British blues rockers performing what was basically a reprise of their famous Woodstock set.

Commercially released as Live at the Isle of Wight Festival 1970 in 1997. *The Doors: Their set was shrouded in darkness due to Jim Morrison's unwillingness to have movie spotlights on the band. Their performances of \\"The End\\" and \\"When the Music's Over\\" are featured in Message to Love. As described in Morrison's biography, No One Here Gets Out Alive, wind, bad weather, and the cold made their performance even harder. Bootleg recordings of the performances and audio exist, alongside a 2015 remastered release by Doxy Records which has been made available on Spotify. A live version of \\"Break On Through (To the Other Side)\\" was featured in the soundtrack for When You're Strange. Their set is featured on the Doors: Live at the Isle of Wight Festival 1970 in a combo DVD/CD ‚Äì Blu- ray/CD & DVD ‚Äì Blu-ray released in 2018. *The Who: Their entire set, including the rock opera Tommy, was released in 1996 on CD (Live at the Isle of Wight Festival 1970). Two years later their set appeared on DVD with significant cuts from Tommy and a few other songs (such as \\"Naked Eye\\") missing. *Sly and the Family Stone: The showstoppers of Woodstock performed to a tired audience on the early morning of Sunday. However, the audience woke up for spirited renditions of \\"I Want to Take You Higher\\", \\"Dance to the Music\\" and \\"Thank You (Falettinme Be Mice Elf Agin)\\", which featured Sly on guitar. \\"Stand\\" and \\"You Can Make it if You Really Try\\" appeared on the album The First Great Rock Festivals of the Seventies. Prior to their encore, another political militant decided it was time to make a speech and the booing audience started to throw beer cans onto the stage. Freddie Stone was hit by a flying can and an angry Sly decided to skip the encore. He did promise a second appearance, but this never occurred. *Melanie: This Woodstock veteran played a well-received set as the sun rose. Prior to her set, Keith Moon of the Who offered her some moral support and encouragement. Not until afterwards did Melanie realise who he was. Her performance of her own song, \\"What Have They Done to My Song Ma\\", was included in a 2010 French documentary, spanning the 1970 and 2010 I.O.W. festivals, called From Wight to Wight and first shown on TV station ARTE, on 30 July 2010. =Sunday 30th= *Good News: American acoustic duo with Larry Gold on cello and Michael Bacon on guitar. *Kris Kristofferson (second set). For his second set he was warmly received. He came on with a bigger band and joked when he took the stage: 'Well, I'm back but this time I've brought some bodyguards'. Two of his songs from his sets were included on the album The First Great Rock Festivals of the Seventies. *Ralph McTell: Despite an enthusiastic reception from the audience, he did not play an encore, and the stage was cleared for Donovan. *Heaven: English answer to Chicago and Blood, Sweat & Tears, managed by Rikki Farr. *Free: Their set list consisted of \\"Ride on a Pony\\", \\"Mr. Big\\", \\"Woman\\", \\"The Stealer\\", \\"Be My Friend\\", \\"Fire & Water\\", \\"I'm a Mover\\", \\"The Hunter\\", their classic hit \\"All Right Now\\", and concluded with a cover of Robert Johnson's \\"Crossroads\\". *Donovan: He first performed an acoustic set, and then an electric set with his band Open Road. *Pentangle: British folk band.

During Sunday morning the audience were entertained by a rehearsal/sound-check by Jethro Tull. *Jimi Hendrix: Performed in the early hours of 31 August with Mitch Mitchell on drums and Billy Cox on bass. Throughout Hendrix was beset by technical problems (during \\"Machine Gun\\" the security personnel's radio is clearly heard through Hendrix's amplifier). David Gilmour claims to have helped mix the sound that night. The set has been released on CD and video in various forms. \\"Power to Love\\", \\"Midnight Lightning\\" and \\"Foxy Lady\\" received top billing on the album The First Great Rock Festivals of the Seventies. *Joan Baez: Her version of \\"Let It Be\\" can be seen in the film Message to Love. *Leonard Cohen: Backed by his band the Army, his tune \\"Suzanne\\" can be seen in the film Message to Love. \\"Tonight Will Be Fine\\" were included on the album The First Great Rock Festivals of the Seventies. In October 2009, audio and video (both DVD and Blu-ray) recording of his set, Live at the Isle of Wight 1970 was released. *Richie Havens: The musician who opened Woodstock closed this festival with a set during the morning of 31 August. As Havens performed his version of \\"Here Comes the Sun\\", a cloudy dawn broke after four days of cloudless sky, so he changed the lyrics to \\"Here Comes the Dawn\\". Havens' set, which is available as an audience recording, also included \\"Maggie's Farm\\" by Bob Dylan, \\"Freedom\\", \\"Minstrel from Gault\\" and the Hare Krishna mantra. ; Canvas City performances :*Hawkwind (on Thursday) :*Pink Fairies (on Thursday) :*T2 On the bill, but did not perform: *Cat Mother *Spirit *The Everly Brothers *Redbone *Mungo Jerry Films and albums =The First Great Rock Festivals of the Seventies (1971)= This three-LP set on CBS Records devoted the first disk to Second Annual Atlanta International Pop Festival, and two disks to the later Isle of Wight.

It featured in order billed: Jimi Hendrix, Sly and the Family Stone, Ten Years After, Miles Davis, Kris Kristofferson, Procol Harum, Cactus, Leonard Cohen and David Bromberg. =Message to Love: The Isle of Wight Festival = All the performances at the festival were professionally filmed by award-winning film director Murray Lerner. with a view to releasing a documentary film but due to financial difficulties, nothing was released until 27 years after the event. Finally, Lerner distilled material from the festival into the film Message to Love: The Isle of Wight Festival which was premiered at a San Jose film festival in 1995 and released in 1997. A CD of the soundtrack was also issued by Castle Communications/Sony Legacy in 1997. The film puts a negative slant on the 1970 event by splicing in footage of violent incidents preceding the festival itself. Chief Constable, Hampshire Constabulary, Sir Douglas Osmond emphasised the peaceful nature of the event in his evidence given to the Stevenson Report, 1971 (submitted to parliament as evidence in favour of future Isle of Wight Festivals). By the end of the festival, the press representatives became almost desperate for material and they seemed a little disappointed that the patrons had been so well behaved. =Other films and albums= * \\"Let The World Wash In\\" by \\"I Luv Wight\\" was the festival official theme song that was soon replaced with \\"Amazing Grace\\" by \\"The Great Awakening\\" A number of other performances were later released on various formats: VHS, LaserDisc, cassette tape, CD, DVD, Blu-ray & Vinyl records: * The Who: Live at the Isle of Wight Festival 1970 (1996 - 2 CD) (2004 - 3 x Vinyl LP) Listening to You (1996)(1998)(2004) (1 LaserDisk/1 DVD/1 Blu-ray) * Emerson, Lake & Palmer: Live at the Isle of Wight Festival 1970 (1997) (1 CD) The Birth of a Band: (2006) (1 DVD/ 2-Sided Disc: CD+DVD) * Jimi Hendrix: Blue Wild Angel: Live at the Isle of Wight (2002) 3 x Vinyl LP, (2014) (2 CD/1 DVD/1 Blu-ray) * Jimi Hendrix: (1990) \\"At the Isle of Wight\\" VHS, LaserDisc, CD (1971) \\"Isle of Wight\\" (1 x vinyl LP) * Miles Davis: Miles Electric: A Different Kind of Blue (2004) (1 DVD) (2009) \\"Isle of Wight\\" CD n¬∞39 from \\"The Complete Columbia Album Collection\\" boxset * Miles Davis: (1987) \\"Isle of Wight\\" 1 x Vinyl LP, (2011) \\"Bitches Brew Live\\" 2 x Vinyl LP, (2007) \\"Isle of Wight concert\\" (Unofficial release) 1 x Vinyl LP) * Jethro Tull: Nothing Is Easy: Live at the Isle of Wight 1970 (2005) (1 DVD/ 1CD/ 2 x Vinyl LP) (2002) \\"By a Benefit Of Wight\\" (1 CD) Unofficial release * Free: Free Forever (2006) (2 DVD) () * Free \\"Live at the Isle of Wight Festival 30/08/70\\" Fan club release 1 x CD 2 bonus track from the 1969 festival - (2019) \\"Live at the Isle of Wight 1970\\" (1 x CD 1 x Vinyl LP) * The Moody Blues: Threshold of a Dream: Live at the Isle of Wight Festival 1970 (2009) (1 CD/1 DVD/1 Blu-ray) (2008) (1 x Vinyl LP) * Leonard Cohen: Leonard Cohen: Live at the Isle of Wight 1970 (2009) (1 CD/1 DVD/1 Blu-ray 2 x Vinyl LP) * Taste: What's Going on: Live at the Isle of Wight 1970 (2015) (1 CD/1 DVD/1 Blu-ray 2 x Vinyl LP) (1971) \\"Live At The Isle Of Wight\\" 1 x Vinyl LP release on CD in 1992 * The Doors: Live at the Isle of Wight Festival 1970 (2018) (1 CD/1 DVD/ 1 Blu-ray, (2019) 2 x Vinyl LP Ltd edition of 11,000) * The Doors Unofficial release: (1982) \\"Get Fat And Die\\" 1 x Vinyl LP, \\"First Flah Of Eden\\" 1 x Vinyl LP, (2009) \\"When The Music's Over\\" 1 x Vinyl LP, (2011) \\"Last Screams Of The Butterfly\\" 2 x Vinyl LP, (1997) \\"Palace Of Exile\\" (1 x CD) * Jim Morrison: \\"The Ultimate Collected Spoken Words 1967-1970\\" 2 x CD - CD 1 track 2 The Isle Of Wight Festival Interview (in full) * Joni Mitchell: Both Sides Now.

Influence The founders/main instigators of the Glastonbury (1971), Windsor (1972‚Äì74) and Stonehenge (1974) Free Festivals were all at IOW 1970, respectively Andrew Kerr, Ubi Dwyer and Wally Hope, inspired by the anarchistic nature of the breakdown of control by the original organisation and the subsequent freedom of the last days of the event. For the 50th anniversary of the event, a re-enactment was scheduled in the same location, with John Lodge, Ten Years After, Pentangle, The Pretty Things and Nik Turner all confirmed. However, this was postponed due to the coronavirus pandemic.https://www.experience1970.com/ Publications * The Last Great Event: with Jimi Hendrix & Jim Morrison, by Ray Foulk (Organiser) & Caroline Foulk, 364 pages, Medina Publishing 2016, Hardback & Paperback * Nights In Wight Satin: \\"An illustrated history of the Isle of Wight festivals\\" (1968,1969 & 1970) by Brian Hinton, 72 pages, 1990 - * Message To Love: \\"The Isle of Wight Festivals 1968 - 1969 - 1970\\", by Brian Hinton, 191 pages, 1995 - * The Last Great Event: \\"The 1970 Isle of Wight Festival\\" by Chris Weston, 152 pages, Ltd edition of 950 copies, Privately Published 2009 * Six Days That Rocked The World: \\"Isle of Wight Festival 1970\\" by Bob Aylott, (40th anniversary 1970 - 2010), 144 pages, Ltd edition of 1000 copies, 2009 The Press Photographers Galery - My Best Seller Isle of Wight Festival 1970 * I Luv Wight: \\"The Isle of Wight Festival 1970\\", \\"The Band - The Theme Song - The Broken Dream\\" by Peter Daltrey, 119 pages, 2012 Chelsea Records Book Division * Isle of Wight 1970: \\"The Last Great Festival\\" A picture record by Rod Allen,published September 1970 by Clipper Press, London. * Festival de Wight: \\"Un Festival de L√©gende\\" by Bernard Rouan (photographer) Hardback photo book (400 copies) - 80 b/w full page photos, 96 pages, 2016 √âdition des Galeries & Mus√©es References External links * UK rock festivals (Isle of Wight 1970) * Cameronlife photo library Category:History of the Isle of Wight 1970 Category:1970 in British music Category:1970 in England Category:Counterculture festivals Category:20th century on the Isle of Wight Category:1970 music festivals Category:August 1970 events in the United Kingdom ","title":"Isle of Wight Festival 1970"},{"id":"401209","text":"Alexander Ivanovich Pokryshkin (; ‚Äì 13 November 1985) was one of the highest- scoring Soviet aces, and earned the title Hero of the Soviet Union three times: 24 May 1943, 24 August 1943, and 19 August 1944. After the war he reached the rank of Marshal of Aviation. During the war he strongly promoted the training in and use of improved aerial combat techniques that included vertical maneuvers that newer fighter aircraft were capable of carrying out, and he spent much of his time studying aerobatics for combat situations.  Early years  Vocational school student Pokryshkin c. 1930. Pokryshkin was born in Novonikolayevsk (now Novosibirsk) in Tomsk Governorate, son of a Russian peasant-turned-factory worker. He grew up in a poor, crime-ridden part of town, but unlike most of his peers he was more interested in learning than in fighting and petty crime. His nickname in his early teens was Engineer. He caught the \\"aviation bug\\" when he was 12 years old at a local air show, and the dream never left him. In 1928, after seven years of school, he found work as a construction worker. In 1930, despite his father's protests, he left home and entered a local technical college, where he received a degree in 18 months and worked for six more as a steel worker at a local munitions factory. Subsequently, he volunteered for the army and was sent to an aviation school. His dream finally seemed to be coming true. Unfortunately the flight school was suddenly closed, and all students were instead transferred to be trained as aircraft mechanics. Dozens of official requests were denied with a simple explanation: \\"Soviet aviation needs mechanics just as badly\\". Pokryshkin still strived to excel as a mechanic. Graduating in 1933, he quickly rose through the ranks. By December 1934, he became the Senior Aviation Mechanic of the 74th Rifle Division. He stayed in that capacity until November 1938. During that time his creative nature became clearly visible: he invented improvements to the ShKAS machine gun and the R-5 reconnaissance aircraft among other things. Finally, during his vacation in the winter of 1938 Pokryshkin was able to circumvent the authorities by passing a yearly civilian pilot program in only 17 days. This automatically made him eligible for flight school. Without even packing a suitcase, he boarded a train to flight school. He graduated with top honours in 1939, and with the rank of senior lieutenant he was assigned to the 55th Fighter Regiment.  World War II  = Early experiences = Pokryshkin in 1940. He was stationed in the Moldavian Soviet Socialist Republic in June 1941, close to the border, and his airfield was bombed on 22 June, the first day of the war. His first involvement in air combat was a disaster. Seeing an aircraft in the air of a type he had never seen before, he attacked and shot it down, only to notice as it was going down that it had Soviet red stars on the wings. It was a Soviet Su-2 light bomber of the 211th Bomber Aviation Regiment, piloted by squadron commander Mikhail Gudzenko. This was a new bomber type that was kept secret even from other Soviet pilots. He then frantically flew in front of all the other MiG 3 pilots who were lining up on the other Sukhoi bombers, thwarting any other Soviet losses by other pilots of his unit. Luckily, Gudzenko survived, although the navigator was killed. He claimed his first shootdown of an enemy aircraft when he shot down a Bf 109 the next day, while he and his wingman were on a reconnaissance mission, and were jumped by five enemy fighters. On 3 July, having claimed several more victories, he was shot down by German flak behind enemy lines and spent four days getting back to his unit. During the first weeks of the war, Pokryshkin began to see very clearly how outdated the Soviet combat doctrine was, and started slowly drafting his own ideas in his meticulous notebooks. He carefully recorded all details of all air engagements he and all his friends were involved in, and came up with detailed analysis of each. He fought in very complicated conditions: constant retreat, poor- to no- controlling and communication from HQ, and overwhelming odds versus a superior opponent. He would later say \\"one who hasn't fought in 1941‚Äì1942 has not truly tasted war\\". Pokryshkin survived several close calls during this time. A machine gun round drove through the right side of the cockpit, cut his shoulder straps, ricocheted off the left side and scratched his chin, covering the entire windscreen in blood. Twice, unexploded bombs landed between his feet, one time during a dramatic low-level raid on his airfield by a pair of Ju 88s. Pokryshkin tried to defend his fighter, one of the very few remaining serviceable aircraft, by removing a flexible machine gun from the nearby bomber and placing it on top of his fighter's fuselage. One of the German bombers saw Pokryshkin firing the only machine gun in the area and flew straight at him, dropping small bombs in a shallow dive. Pokryshkin watched a string of explosions running up to him, but the bomb that landed immediately next to him did not explode. The Ju 88 had dropped it too low; the bomb had insufficient time to arm itself before hitting the ground. In the autumn of 1941 Pokryshkin, flying a MiG-3 (possibly winter-camouflaged), took off in sleet and rain conditions after two other pilots had crashed on takeoff. His mission was to locate von Kleist's 1st Panzer Group, which had been stopped in front of Shakhty, and then their position lost by the Soviet forces. After some time flying at low altitude, low on gasoline, in bad weather, he finally found them, and was able to return safely to base with this critical information. For the successful completion of this mission, he was awarded the Order of Lenin. When the German summer offensive of 1942 began, part of 16th Guards Fighter Aviation Regiment had been re-equipped with the Yakovlev Yak-1 fighter, including Pokryshkin's squadron. In that period Pokryshkin flew missions escorting Su-2 and Il-2 Shturmovik aircraft, and frequently was engaged by German fighters. On 17 July 1942, during a dogfight with Bf 109s, he became separated from his wingman Konstantin Figichov, and was jumped by a Rotte of Bf 109G-2 \\"Gustavs\\" flown by the experte Feldwebel Hans Dammers and his wingman Unteroffizier Kurt Keiser (7./JG 52). Initially Pokryshkin dived to escape, but realizing that the heavier and faster Gustavs would catch him, he performed a chandelle and then a barrel roll. This caused the Germans to overshoot, and then Pokryshkin shot down (and killed) Keiser at short range. Dammers attacked Pokryshkin shortly afterwards, damaging his Yak-1. But once more Pokryshkin performed a barrel roll, forced Dammers to slide forward, and then shot down the German ace. In the late summer of 1942, his regiment was recalled from the front lines to convert to a new fighter type, the Bell P-39 Airacobra. While training in the rear, Pokryshkin frequently clashed with the regiment's new commander, Isayev (the former regimental navigator), who could not stand his criticism of Soviet air combat doctrine. Isayev fabricated a court-martial case, accusing Pokryshkin of cowardice, insubordination, and disobeying orders. Pokryshkin was grounded, removed from the regiment's headquarters, and had his Party membership cancelled. However, he was helped by his squadron mates, the regimental political commissar, and the divisional commanders, and he was soon vindicated. The 216 Fighter Aviation Division's leadership dismissed the case against him, and had him reinstated. = Kuban = Pokryshkin's most significant contribution to the war effort and the most impressive kill record came during the battle for the Kuban region in 1943. The area east of the Crimean peninsula had seen vicious air combat in the months that led to the Soviet assault on Crimea itself, where the Kuban-based Soviet air regiments flew against Crimea-based Luftwaffe Geschwader. Pokryshkin's regiment fought against such renowned German fighter units as JG 52 and JG 3 'Udet'. The area saw some of the most fierce fighting on the Eastern Front, with daily engagements of up to 200 aircraft in the air. Pokryshkin's innovative tactics of using different fighter types stacked in altitude, the so-called 'pendulum' flight pattern for patrolling the airspace, and the use of ground-based radar, forward based controllers and an advanced central ground control system, contributed to the first great Soviet Air Force victory over the Luftwaffe. In the summer of 1942, the 4th Air Army in which Pokryshkin served received their first mobile radar stations. They were tested in directing interceptions of German and Romanian aircraft over water, and they proved highly successful. In early January 1943, 16th Guards Fighter Aviation Regiment was sent to 25th Depot Fighter Aviation Regiment, a unit tasked with checking that Soviet-made and Lend-Lease aircraft were ready for combat service) near the Iranian border, to re-equip with new aircraft, and also to receive new pilots. Many of these planes had to be ferried in from Iran. Whilst there were delays in assembly by the Americans in Iran, the Soviet pilots involved felt that the Americans were willfully impeding the war effort. It was at this time that the unit converted to the P-39 Airacobra which, when all had arrived, transformed the unit into a 3-squadron regiment. 16th Guards Fighter Aviation Regiment received 14 P-39L-1s, seven P-39Ks (the very last of which was assigned to Pokryshkin) and 11 P-39D-2s. The unit returned to action on 8 April 1943. During the remainder of the month, Pokryshkin was credited with 11 Bf 109s and one Ju 88 destroyed. He was credited with a Bf 109 destroyed on his very first Airacobra mission, on 9 April 1943, and scored four Bf 109 kills on 12 April 1943, one of his more successful days. He scored again on 15, 16, 20, 21, and 24 April ‚Äì one Bf 109 on each day, adding a Ju 88 (probably in fact an He 111) on 29 April, plus one more Bf 109 on 30 April. On 4 May 1943 Pokryshkin gained three confirmed kills two Ju 87 and a Bf 109. In most subsequent fights, Pokryshkin would usually take the most difficult role, attacking the German flight leader, who was often an aggressive experte. He had learned in 1941‚Äì42 that shooting down the flight leader would demoralise the enemy and often cause them to scramble home. Taking that into account, several such experten were almost certainly among his kills during the month of May that year. On 6 May 1943 Pokryshkin shot down a Bf 109, probably the plane of 9-kills ace Unteroffizier Heinz Scholze (4./JG 52), who crashed while trying to land at Kuteinikovo. Two days later, his victim may have been the Bf 109G-4 of Leutnant Helmut Haberda (an experte of 5./JG 52 with 58 victories to his credit), though the Luftwaffe credited the loss to Soviet flak. Pokryshkin received his first 'Hero of the Soviet Union' award on 24 May 1943, and was promoted to major in June, having become commanding officer of his squadron. On 23 June, he exchanged his old P-39K-1 USAAF Serial Number 42-4421, \\"White 13\\", for the famous P-39N USAAF S.N. 42-9004, \\"White 100\\". He flew aircraft designated 100 for the rest of the war, such as P-39N-5 42-19185, after 42-9004 was damaged in August or September 1943, except for the test of the Berlin autobahn as a runway in Konstantin Sukhov's \\"White 50\\", which was much photographed.Lend-Lease Aces of World War 2, Osprey Books, Aerokobrui Had Kubanyu, footnote 75 = \\"Osvobozhdenie Ukrainy\\" ‚Äì The Liberation of Ukraine = In mid-July the 216 Fighter Aviation Division (then redesignated 9 Guards Fighter Aviation Division) was deployed in southern Ukraine to help liberate the Donbass area. There he continued to defeat German aces ‚Äì on 23 July 1943 Pokryshkin shot down the 56-kills experte Uffz. Hans Ellendt, of 4./JG 52. Occasionally his P-39s also escorted the Pe-2 bombers. In that role, he used his nickname Sotka (\\"One Hundred\\") ‚Äì his radio call sign), because he knew very well that the Luftwaffe ordered its airmen to stay on the ground if they knew he was in the air. A Pe-2 pilot of the 36 Bomber Aviation Regiment, Timofey P. Puniov, recalled that because of the heavy casualties inflicted by the German fighters, the 16th Guards Fighter Aviation Regiment was tasked to escort them. Puniov clearly remembers that twice Pokryshkin violated radio silence saying openly in the frequency: \\"Vnimanie! Ya ‚Äì sotka. Poedu na rabotu!\\" (Attention! I'm \\"100\\". I'm going to work!). Neither on those two occasions nor after did the German fighters try to intercept the 36th Bomber Aviation Regiment.http://www.rkka.es/Entrevistas/punev_2/000_Punev-2.htm On 20 August, Isaev, who had been the Unit Navigator, and then Commanding Officer, and with whom Pokryshkin had strong differences, took measures to have Pokryshkin stripped of his Hero of the Soviet Union, expelled from the regiment, and hauled before a tribunal. From 10 PM that night at least through the following day, Pokryshkin, 298th Fighter Aviation Regiment's Major Taranyenko, and the 16th Guards' Commissar, Gubarevim, and some \\"Osobists\\"(NKVD people) completed interrogations and investigations. Gubarevim, with difficulty, was able to clear Pokryshkin's name and reputation, and \\"Sasha\\" was thereupon awarded his second Hero of the Soviet Union on 24 August 1943.Lend-Lease Aces of World War 2, Osprey Publishing, by George Mellenger and footnote 75, \\"Aerokobrui Nad Kubanyu (\\"Aerokobras over the Kuban\\") On 21 September 1943, Pokryshkin was involved in another high-profile air engagement. This one happened at low altitudes right over the front line. It was witnessed by dozens of journalists and representatives of the high command. Pokryshkin shot down three Junkers Ju 88s in a single pass, overcome by hatred, as he had just found out that the entire family of Zhmud, his mechanic, had been killed in German occupied territories. Only two kills were confirmed, the third Ju 88 being recorded as brought down by the explosion of the second one and not because of Pokryshkin's gunfire. All three Junkers are confirmed by German loss records ‚Äì they were Ju 88A-4s of 5./RummKGr.LW Loss Report (microfilm roll #11)-Vol. 21 Earlier that same day Pokryshkin had added two more Junkers Ju 87s to his tally, almost certainly Ju 87D-5s of 6./StG 1. = 1944‚Äì1945 = In February 1944, Pokryshkin was offered a promotion and an easy desk job managing new pilot training. He immediately rejected this offer and stayed at his old regiment and his old rank. However, he did not fly nearly as much as before. Pokryshkin had been made a famous hero by the propaganda machine, and he was not allowed to fly as often because of fear of him being killed. Instead, Pokryshkin spent a lot of time in the radio bunker, directing his regiment's fights over the radio. In June 1944, Pokryshkin was promoted to colonel and given command of 9th Guards Air Division. On 19 August 1944, for 550 front- line sorties and 53 official kills, Pokryshkin was awarded the Gold Star of the Hero of the Soviet Union for the third time. He was the first person ever to receive the award three times, and he is the only Soviet soldier to receive the award three times during wartime. Pokryshkin was forbidden to fly altogether, but managed to circumvent the rule a few times and still continued to score an occasional kill. One of such occasions occurred on 30 May 1944 near Jassy, Romania. The whole 16th Guards Fighter Aviation Regiment engaged a large formation of Ju 87s heading towards the Soviet ground forces escorted by Fw 190s and Bf 109s. In the ensuing mel√©e, the Airacobra pilots claimed to shoot down five Stukas, three Focke-Wulfs and one Messerschmitt without losses ‚Äì three Ju 87s were shot down by Pokryshkin himself. The next time Pokryshkin scored victories was on 16 July, when he got credit for two more Stukas and one Hs 129 of 10.(Pz)/SG 9, probably the Henschel Hs 129B-2 of Hauptmann Rudolf-Heinz Ruffer, credited with 80 tank-kills. His last victory was another Ju 87, downed on 14 January 1945. Out of his official score of 65 victories, only six were scored in the last two years of the war. The bulk of Pokryshkin's victories came during the time when the Soviet Air Force was still fighting at a disadvantage, including amongst the most of any Soviet pilot during the most difficult first year of the war.  After the war  In 1948 he graduated from the Frunze Military Academy. Between 1949‚Äì1955 he acted as deputy commander of the 33rd Fighter Air Defense and the commander of the 88th Fighter Aviation Corps in Rzhev. He was repeatedly passed-over for promotion, possibly because he was just too intelligent (or honest) for Stalin's comfort. Only after Stalin's death did he find himself back in favour and finally promoted to Air Marshal. In 1957 he graduated from General Staff Academy. After graduation he served as Chief of Fighter Aircraft of the North Caucasian Military Defense. From 1959, he served in the 8th Independent Air Defense Army Air (Kiev) and from 1961 to 1968 acted as Commanding General of the 8th Army Air Defense and deputy commander of the Kiev Military District Air Defense Forces. In 1968 he became Deputy Chief of the Air Defense Forces. His highest position was as president of DOSAAF (1972‚Äì1981), a mostly civilian organisation that was largely tasked with training young civilians and preparing them for service with the Air Force. Pokryshkin again found himself ostracized for his honesty. Despite strong pressure, he never wrote about or supported glorification of premier Leonid Brezhnev's role in the battle of Kuban, where Brezhnev was a minor general. Pokryshkin died on 13 November 1985 at the age of 72. In Novosibirsk, a street, a square and a subway station are named in his honour. He wrote several books in Russian about his wartime experiences.see the episode of the TBS Series, \\"The Unknown War\\" entitled \\"War in the Air\\" He appeared in an episode of documentaries TV Series, \\"The Unknown War \\", specifically episode 9, entitled \\"War in the Air\\", and, at the beginning and end of the episode, he spoke to the host and narrator, Burt Lancaster. There are two Soviet-made documentaries starring Alexander Pokryshkin; Pokryshkin in the Sky (1945) Russian Ace Alexander Pokryshkin (1985).  Aircraft flown by Pokryshkin  Pokryshkin started the war flying the Mikoyan-Gurevich MiG-3 fighter, in which he scored almost twenty victories. The unit was given the honor \\"16th Guards Fighter Regiment\\" in March 1942. At this time or soon after, the unit received some Yak-1s, in which Pokryshkin also scored victories, but which are neither identified, nor illustrated, in any known way. In January 1943, his regiment converted to Lend-Lease Bell P-39 Airacobras. Soviet pilots liked this aircraft, and found it quite competitive with the Messerschmitt Bf 109 and superior to the Focke- Wulf Fw 190 at the low air combat altitudes common on the Eastern Front. Pokryshkin enjoyed the 37 mm cannon's destructive firepower, as well as the two upper nose-mounted .50 caliber machine guns, synchronized to fire through the propellor (airscrew), in addition to the pair of .30 caliber machine guns mounted in each wing. He claimed that the cannon's trigger, positioned at the top of the joystick, was impossible to push without moving the pilot's hand, which made the aircraft deviate from the gunsight, so finally he had his regiment's aircraft rigged so that a single button simultaneously fired cannon and machine guns. In his memoirs he describes many enemy aircraft immediately disintegrating upon being hit by a salvo. Pokryshkin and his regiment were repeatedly asked to convert to new Soviet fighters such as the La-5 and Yak-3. However, Pokryshkin found the Yak-3's firepower insufficient, and personally disliked Yakovlev, so the squadron remained with the P-39. Finally, in 1944, he found an aircraft that he deemed a worthy heir: the Lavochkin La-7. However, one of his close friends, Soviet ace Alexander Klubov, was killed in a landing mishap while converting to the La-7. The crash was blamed on the malfunction of the plane's hydraulic system. Pokryshkin subsequently cancelled his regiment's conversion, and there are multiple reports that they instead began flying the Bell P-63 Kingcobra. Through the Lend-Lease agreement with United States, the Soviet Union was not allowed to use P-63s against Germany; they were given only to be used in the eventual battle with Japan. Thus it is quite understandable that no mention of this appears in any official records. However, personal accounts of German pilots and flak crewmen who encountered P-63s in the skies of Eastern Prussia as well as in the memoirs of one of the pilots in Pokryshkin's squadron. It is reported that 9th Fighter Aviation Division was given approximately 36 P-63s but these were not used while the fighting was still in progress.Soviet Lend-Lease Aces of World War 2 The designations of MiG-3 aircraft used by Pokryshkin were, in the likeliest order of use, \\"7\\", \\"4\\", \\"01\\", \\"White-5\\" (with \\"GVARDIYA\\" on the intakes ‚Äì likely dating to when the unit was awarded this designation), and finally \\"67\\". He then flew Yak-1 fighters when the unit partially re-equipped with them. He flew P-39K-1 \\"White-13\\" 42-4421 over the Kuban. He converted in late June to P-39N-0 42-9004 \\"White 100\\". \\"White 100\\" was damaged in August or September 1943. The only known photograph of 42-9004 dates from around this time: it shows the nose resting on a saw horse with the nose wheel main leg hyper- extended so the nose wheel rests on the ground. According to a VVS color scheme research website, 42-9004 was struck by inadvertent gunfire from a badly damaged Il-2 that had a rough landing, and on one of its last bounces the guns went off and, among other things, the gunfire struck, such as the aircrew dugout, hit the parked Airacobra. About this time Pokryshkin changed to P-39N-5 42-19158 (or possibly a different N-5). which was also designated \\"White-100\\". (This is according to the document for an award to an aircraft mechanic assigned to 42-19158, for keeping it airworthy and ready to fly combat missions for 100 flights in a row.) On 28 May 1943, Pokryshkin flew P-39D-2 41-38520 (\\"White-17\\") for a single mission. There is a photo of him post-mission bending to remove his parachute straps in front of the nose of 41-38520. In the famous photo taken of him using a stretch of German \\"autobahn\\" as a runway, he was flying a P-39Q-15 designated \\"White-50\\", with the serial number painted out (the same aircraft was originally assigned to K. V. Sukhov). He used five La-7 aircraft with the inscription, \\"From the Workers of Novosibirsk to Hero of the Soviet Union Alexander Ivanovich Pokhryshkin\\", but did not fly in them himself. A La-7-equipped unit was, in 1945, made a part of the 9th Guards Division, making it a four-regiment division. At one point in 1944, he was apparently given a La-5FN for his personal use, pending the hoped-for Lavochkin conversion of the entire unit. The unit apparently flew P-63A or C Kingcobras after the war, and Pokryshkin would have again numbered his aircraft \\"100\\". Finally, one or more of the 9th Guards Fighter Division units may have eventually converted to the Yak-9P before his attendance at the War College in 1948. After his appointment as DOSAAF director in the early 1950s, he had use of a MiG-15, and, later, of an Il-12 or Il-14.  Final tally  Pokryshkin's score is heavily disputed among historians. Overclaiming was not uncommon in World War II, and Pokryshkin's claims in his memoir are much higher than recent estimates by historians and official records, and recent estimates are generally lower than older estimates. In 1986 Oleg Levchenko claimed that Pokryshkin in fact shot down 94 enemy aircraft, damaged 19 and destroyed three more on the ground, and said that no less than 15 victories scored in 1941 were not taken into account, because the documents confirming them were destroyed during the hurried withdrawal from encirclement during the Battle of Uman. However, Levchenko's claims are generally disputed in 21st century estimates, which tend to place Pokryshkin's tally in the mid 40s. Thomas Polak and Christopher Shores credited him with 53 solo and 6 shared victories in their 1999 book, however the bibliography of the book cites Pokryshkin's memoirs instead of any official documents, and the tallies of several other aviators are heavily inflated to match the official Soviet claims. Russian historian Mikhail Bykov credited him with 43 individual and 3 shared victories in a 2014 book; a decade earlier, in an article titled –ú—É—Ç–Ω–æ–µ –ù–µ–±–æ 1941 –≥–æ–¥–∞ (\\"The Murky Sky of 1941\\") with Aleksandr Rodionov he claimed that Pokryshkin tried to steal Rechkalov's kills during 1941. Andrey Simonov and Nikolai Bodrikhin credited him with 45 solo and 4 shared shootdowns in a 2017 book.  Legacy  A minor planet 3348 Pokryshkin discovered by Soviet astronomer Nikolai Stepanovich Chernykh in 1978 is named after him. The character Aleksandra Ivanova Pokryshkin from the anime Brave Witches is based on him.

It has existed in various forms since the 15th century. The current version was made in 1937 and is worn by the monarch after a coronation (St Edward's Crown having been used to crown the monarch) and used at the State Openings of Parliament. The crown is adorned with 2,901 precious stones, including the Cullinan II diamond, St Edward's Sapphire, the Stuart Sapphire, and the Black Prince's Ruby. History =Origin= St Edward's Crown, used to crown English monarchs, was considered to be a holy relic,Hoak, p. 59. kept in the saint's shrine at Westminster Abbey and therefore not worn by monarchs at any other time. Instead, a \\"great crown\\" with crosses and fleurs-de-lis, but without arches (an open crown), was a king's usual headgear at state occasions until the time of Henry V, who is depicted wearing an imperial crown of state with gold arches (a closed crown). Arches were a symbol of sovereignty, and by this point in history, the king of England was being celebrated as rex in regno suo est imperator ‚Äì an emperor of his own domain ‚Äì owing obedience to no one but God, unlike some continental rulers, who owed fealty to more powerful kings or the Holy Roman Emperor.Hoak, pp. 55, 63. Henry VII or his son and successor Henry VIII may have commissioned a more elaborate version of the state crown which is first described in detail in an inventory of royal jewels in 1521, and again in 1532, 1550, 1574 and 1597, and was included in a painting by Daniel Mytens of Charles I in 1631. The Tudor Crown had more pearls and jewels than its medieval predecessor, and the centre petals of each of the fleurs-de- lis had images of Christ, the Virgin Mary and St George. The crown weighed 3.3 kg (7 lb 6 oz) and was set with 168 pearls, 58 rubies, 28 diamonds, 19 sapphires and 2 emeralds. Following the abolition of the monarchy and the execution of Charles I in 1649, the Tudor Crown was broken up by Oliver Cromwell during the Interregnum,The National Archives of the United Kingdom and its valuable components were sold for ¬£1,100. =Restoration to present day= Upon the restoration of the monarchy in 1660, a new state crown was made for Charles II by Sir Robert Vyner. About 10 versions of the crown have existed since the restoration.Mears; Thurley; Murphy, p. 29. The one made for Queen Victoria in 1838 is the basis for today's crown. Made by Rundell and Bridge in 1838 using old and new jewels, it had a crimson velvet cap with ermine border and a lining of white silk. It weighed and was decorated with 1,363 brilliant-cut, 1,273 rose-cut and 147 table-cut diamonds, 277 pearls, 17 sapphires, 11 emeralds, 4 rubies, and the Black Prince's Ruby (a spinel). At the State Opening of Parliament in 1845, the Duke of Argyll was carrying the crown before Queen Victoria when it fell off the cushion and broke. Victoria wrote in her diary, \\"it was all crushed and squashed like a pudding that had sat down\\". The gems in the crown were remounted for the coronation of George VI in 1937 by Garrard & Co. The crown was adjusted for Queen Elizabeth II's coronation in 1953, with the head size reduced and the arches lowered by 25 mm (1 inch) to give it a more feminine appearance. Description The Imperial State Crown is 31.5 cm (12.4 in) tall and weighs 1.06 kg (2.3 lb), and has four fleurs-de-lis and four crosses patt√©e, supporting two arches topped by a monde and cross patt√©e. Its purple velvet cap is trimmed with ermine. The frame is made of gold, silver and platinum, and decorated with 2,868 diamonds, 273 pearls, 17 sapphires, 11 emeralds, and 5 rubies. Notable stones are St Edward's Sapphire on the top cross, reputedly taken from the ring of Edward the Confessor when he was re-interred at Westminster Abbey in 1163, and the Black Prince's Ruby (a large spinel) on the front cross. In 1909, the 104-carat (21 g) Stuart Sapphire, set in the front of the crown, was moved to the back and replaced by the 317-carat (63 g) Cullinan II.Mears; Thurley; Murphy, p. 30. Below the monde hang four pearls, three of which are often said to have belonged to Queen Elizabeth I, but the association is almost certainly erroneous.. Usage The crown is worn by the monarch on leaving Westminster Abbey at the end of his or her coronation. It is usually also worn at State Openings of Parliament, although Elizabeth II wore a hat in March 1974, June 2017 and December 2019 after snap general elections, and in October 2019 she wore the State Diadem, while the Imperial State Crown was carried beside her. Usually, it is taken to the Palace of Westminster under armed guard in its own carriage and placed in the Robing Room, where the Queen dons her robes and puts on the crown before giving her speech to Parliament. If a State Opening occurs before a coronation, the crown is placed on a cushion beside the monarch. In 1689, one week after being proclaimed king, William III wore his crown in Parliament to pass the Crown and Parliament Recognition Act 1689.Twining, p. 173. When not in use, the Imperial State Crown is on public display in the Jewel House at the Tower of London.

Pilot He worked as a pilot with the Far Eastern department of the Civil Air Fleet. Lyapidevsky took part in an aerial search and rescue operation for the crew of the steamship Cheliuskin, under extremely difficult conditions, after it was sunk in Arctic waters after February 13, 1934. Rescue Together with six other pilots, Lyapidevsky rescued 104 people from the wrecked freighter. The rescue operation took two months, as survivors waited to be rescued on ice floes. Lyapidevsky personally made 29 scouting flights despite blizzards. Lyapidevsky made his first landing on one of the floes on March 5. It was a great feat of flying. Not only was the weather horrid but the floe was only 500 by 1,300 feet. Lyapidevsky took off from the floe with 10 women and 2 children on board his plane. He flew the stranded \\"Cheliuskintsi\\" from their makeshift airstrip on the floating ice field of the Chukchi Sea to the town of Uelen. Lyapidevsky was awarded the title of the Hero of the Soviet Union for this deed at April 20, 1934. After the Gold Star medals had appeared, at November 4, 1939 No.1 medal was handed over to him. The heroics of the fliers in the Cheliuskin Rescue prompted the government to create the title of Hero of the Soviet Union. The title later became the Soviet Union's highest military honor.

Life and career  Sigizmund Levanevsky was born to a Polish family in St. Petersburg on . His brother J√≥zef Lewoniewski (1899-1933) was a Polish military and sports pilot. Sigizmund took part in the October Revolution on the Bolshevik side and later participated in the Russian Civil War, serving in the Red Army since 1918. In 1925 he graduated from the Sevastopol Naval Aviation School and became a military pilot. In 1930 he was withdrawn to reserve. From 1932 to 1933 he was head of flight and training unit of All-Ukraine Pilot School. In 1933 Levanevsky became a pilot for the Glavsevmorput' (Main Northern Maritime Route's Administration) - providing ice reconnaissance for shipping convoys in the eastern part of the northeast passage. At July 20, 1933 he achieved his first international fame, evacuating from Anadyr to Nome the American pilot James Mattern who had crash landed to the west of Anadyr during his attempt to break the record for a solo flight around the world. The following year Levanevsky and fellow-pilot Mavriky Slepnyov traveled to Alaska to obtain a pair of Consolidated Fleetster 17AF transport planes for use in the aerial rescue efforts for the passengers of the crushed steamship Cheliuskin.\\"Readon, Jim (2016). Alaska‚Äôs First Bush Pilots, 1923-1930. Missoula, Montana: Pictorial Histories Publishing Company. p. 174. .\\" During the March 24th flight from Nome, Levanevsky's plane was forced down at Kolyuchin Bay on the north Chukotka coast and during landing its skis were ripped off. Slepnyov evacuated him to the operations base at Vankarem but without a plane Levanevsky did not participate in the rescue efforts. However, he would later shuttle a doctor from Uelen to Saint Lawrence Bay at Chukotka for emergency attention for Bobrov, deputy head of the expedition, who suffered from appendicitis \\\\- for which he was awarded the title of the Hero of the Soviet Union. In 1934 he became member of the Communist Party.  North Pole flights  Postage stamp, USSR, 1935: Sigizmund Levanevsky stamp with commemorative red overprint for \\"Moscow - San Francisco flight via the North Pole\\", August 1935. On 3 August 1935 Levanevsky and a two-man crew (co-pilot Georgy Baidukov and navigator Victor Levchenko) attempted a transpolar flight from Moscow to San Francisco in a prototype single engine Tupolev ANT-25 long-range bomber. A thousand miles into the flight (just north of the Kola Peninsula) the oil tank developed an oil-leak, being overfilled, and Levanevsky chose to scuttle the mission. The following year Levanevsky and navigator Levchenko sought to prove the possibility of an air route between the U.S. and U.S.S.R. via the Alaskan- Bering Strait, and completed an 11,800+ mile multistage flight from Los Angeles (5 August 1936) to Moscow (13 September 1936) in a Vultee V-1A floatplane. For this flight Levanevsky was awarded with Order of Red Banner of Labour. On 12 August 1937 a type Bolkhovitinov DB-A (no. N-209, a Dalniy Bombardirovshik-Academy, i.e. Long-range Bomber) aircraft with 6-men crew under captaincy of Levanevsky started its long distance flight from Moscow to the United States (to Fairbanks) via the North Pole. The radio communications with the crew broke off the next day, on the 13th of August, at 17:58 Moscow time after the North Pole, when the aircraft encountered adverse weather conditions and suffered failure of its end right engine. The Soviet Government financed two aerial searches for the missing aircraft using purchased US aircraft under the command of Canadian bush and Antarctic pilot Herbert Hollick-Kenyon in 1937 and 1938. Jimmie Mattern flew a Lockheed 12, \\"The Texan\\" from California to assist in the search for his former rescuer in the initial search. After the unsuccessful search attempts all the members of the crew were presumed dead. In March 1999, Dennis Thurston of the Minerals Management Service in Anchorage located what appeared to be wreckage in the shallows of Camden Bay, between Prudhoe Bay and Kaktovik. There was conjecture in the media that it was Levanevsky's aircraft, but a subsequent attempt to locate the object again proved unsuccessful.

Together with Mikhail Babushkin, he was the first to land an airplane on the North Pole. Biography He was born on 18 November (6 November Old Style) 1899 in Bolshiye Studyonki village (now part of Lipetsk) in Tambov Governorate. He volunteered for the Red Army in 1919 and took part in the Russian Civil War. Initially, he was a driver in an air unit. From 1925 he trained as an aircraft mechanic, and in 1928 he became a pilot himself. He then worked in state commercial aviation on long distances, first flying to Sakhalin. From 1931 he also worked for the Pravda newspaper, distributing its matrix from Moscow to other cities by the air. In 1934, he participated in the Arctic rescue operation of the crew of the sunken steamship Cheliuskin on the frozen Chukchi Sea, making a historical flight from Khabarovsk to Vankarem, being the first to fly across the Chukotka Mountains. Vodopyanov was awarded the title of the Hero of the Soviet Union for this deed on April 20, 1934, as one of the 7 first recipients of the title. Then, he commanded an expedition of four Tupolev TB-3 aircraft, being the first to land on the North Pole on May 21, 1937, carrying parts and crew for an Arctic station. During World War II, after July 1941, he was the commander of the 81st Special Purpose Air Division (a long range bomber division). He commanded the first Soviet air raid on Berlin on 10/11 August 1941. On the return trip, his Petlyakov Pe-8 heavy bomber was shot down by the flak and crash landed in Estonia, in no man's land between front lines. He and his crew managed to break through to the Soviet side. Vodopianov was dismissed from the commanding post as a result of big losses in this raid, but he continued to serve as a bomber pilot. (The main reasons for big losses were aircraft failures and hurried preparations, caused by Joseph Stalin's order). In 1943 he was promoted to Major General. After the war, in 1946 he was discharged from armed forces, and turned to writing in Moscow. He was awarded the Order of Lenin and Order of the Red Banner four times each and the Order of the Patriotic War 1st class. Many children grew up with his book \\"The polar pilot\\" that has described not only his path to aviation, but also the further adventures of his plane in revolutionary Spain, as well as the description of the Cheliuskin rescue and his participation in the War.

The episode had several writers contribute to the finished product including Harlan Ellison, Steven W. Carabatsos, D. C. Fontana and Gene L. Coon. Gene Roddenberry made the final re-write. The episode was directed by Joseph Pevney and first aired on NBC on April 6, 1967. In the episode, after a heavily medicated Doctor Leonard McCoy (DeForest Kelley) travels back in time and changes history, Captain Kirk (William Shatner) and Spock (Leonard Nimoy) follow him to correct the timeline. In doing so, Kirk falls in love with Edith Keeler (Joan Collins), but realizes that in order to save his future, he must allow her to die. The episode received widespread critical acclaim and has been frequently stated to be the best episode of the entire franchise, with it fondly received by cast, crew, and critics. Elements such as the tragic ending were highlighted by several reviewers. It won several awards, including the Writers Guild of America Award for Best Episodic Drama on Television and the Hugo Award for Best Dramatic Presentation. Plot Chief Medical Officer Leonard McCoy is treating an injured Lt. Sulu when the USS Enterprise is rocked by a time distortion and McCoy accidentally injects himself with an overdose of cordrazine, a dangerous drug. Delusional and paranoid, McCoy flees from the bridge to the transporter room, beaming himself down to a nearby planet. Captain James T. Kirk (William Shatner) leads a landing party to look for McCoy, and they come across an ancient glowing stone archway, which turns out to be the cause of the time distortions. They discover the archway to be sentient, and this \\"Guardian of Forever\\" (voiced by Bartell LaRue) explains that it is a doorway to any time and place. While Spock (Leonard Nimoy) is recording historic images from the portal, McCoy escapes through it. The landing party suddenly loses contact with the Enterprise, and the Guardian informs them that McCoy has altered the past, and that the Enterprise, and all that they knew, is gone. The Guardian permits Kirk and Spock to follow McCoy in an effort to repair the timeline. Spock times their passage so as to arrive where McCoy did ahead of when he will arrive, and they find themselves in New York City in 1930, during the Great Depression. After stealing clothes from a fire escape to blend in, they meet a woman named Edith Keeler (Joan Collins), who runs the 21st Street Mission. They are given a place to sleep, along with doing odd jobs to earn money. Spock works to devise a method of interfacing with his tricorder and analyze its recorded images to determine how McCoy has altered history. While they await his arrival, Kirk and Keeler spend time together, and Kirk begins to fall in love. McCoy arrives, and stumbles into the mission, unnoticed by Kirk and Spock, and Keeler nurses him back to health. Spock completes his work and discovers Keeler was supposed to die that year in a traffic accident. Spock learns Dr. McCoy altered the past by saving Keeler's life and. in the altered timeline, Keeler founded a pacifist movement on the eve of World War II. This causes the United States to delay its entrance into the war, allowing Nazi Germany time to develop nuclear weapons they launch in their V-2 rockets to conquer the world. Kirk admits his love for Keeler, and Spock answers that Keeler must die in order to prevent millions of deaths and restore the future. On her way with Kirk to see a movie, Keeler mentions McCoy. Kirk, shocked and excited, tells her to stay where she is and calls Spock to tell him this. The Starfleet trio reunite in front of the mission. Observing this and curious, Keeler crosses the street to join them, and she steps right in front of a fast-moving truck. Kirk turns to save Keeler from the truck, but a shout from Spock freezes him in his tracks. Then Kirk blocks McCoy from saving her, and she is struck and killed. A stunned McCoy can't believe that Kirk knowingly stopped him. With history restored, Kirk, Spock, and McCoy are returned to the Guardian's planet where the rest of the landing party is waiting. When the Guardian declares that \\"many such journeys are possible\\", a brokenhearted Kirk simply states \\"Let's get the hell out of here,\\" and the landing party beams off the planet back to the Enterprise. Production =Writing= The writing of this episode took over ten months, from the initial pitch by Harlan Ellison to the final re- write by Gene Roddenberry. Steven W. Carabatsos and D. C. Fontana, both story editors on the show, undertook re-writes of the teleplay, and changes have also been attributed to producer Gene L. Coon. The experience led to animosity between Ellison and Roddenberry for the rest of the latter's life, in particular over a claim by Roddenberry that Ellison had the character Scotty dealing drugs in one version of the script. The episode went over budget by more than $50,000 and overran the production schedule. Mistakes were made in the set design with an instruction for \\"runes\\" misconstrued as a request for \\"ruins\\". With Matt Jefferies ill, Rolland Brooks designed the set and the Guardian of Forever, to the surprise of Jefferies on his return. Initial pitch and outlines Harlan Ellison was one of the first writers recruited by Gene Roddenberry for Star Trek. Roddenberry was aiming to have the best science fiction writers produce scripts for the show, and had identified Ellison immediately; at the time, Ellison had been nominated for the 1965 Writers Guild of America Award for Outstanding Script for a Television Anthology with his script for The Outer Limits episode \\"Demon with a Glass Hand;\\" he went on to win. Rather than being assigned a pre-written premise, Ellison was allowed to develop his own and propose it in a 10-page outline. Ellison was inspired by reading a biography of evangelist Aimee Semple McPherson, and thought that it would be an interesting idea to have Kirk travel back in time and fall in love with a similar woman of good intent, but someone who must die in order to preserve the future. Ellison considered that it would have a heartrending effect on Kirk. Harlan Ellison (pictured in 1986) was one of the first writers to be hired for Star Trek In March 1966, Ellison pitched the idea to Roddenberry, who accepted it. A week later, he turned in his first script treatment. Producer Robert H. Justman later recalled that he thought it was brilliant. When writing it, Ellison did not have as many restrictions as some of the later writers; he was hired prior to the series bible being created. The first version introduced Lieutenant Richard Beckwith, who is sentenced to death after he kills a fellow crewman when he is threatened with the exposure of his involvement in the illegal drug trade. Ellison had included this element, since he expected the starship to be like any other military unit, having at least some unlawful people. Beckwith is then escorted to the surface of a nearby planet alongside Kirk, with Spock to carry out the execution by firing squad. Because of the planet's atmosphere, they have to wear environmental suits. On arriving, they find an ancient civilization and the remains of a city ‚Äî this was Ellison's \\"city on the edge of forever\\". It is inhabited by several men, the Guardians of Forever, who protect an ancient time machine. Kirk then asks to see the history of the United States on the machine, and as it reaches the Great Depression of the 1930s, Beckwith dives into the projection and vanishes. The guardians inform Kirk that history has been altered, and upon returning to the Enterprise, they discover that the vessel is now manned by renegades. They fight their way back to the transporter room and return to the planet, where the Guardians allow Kirk and Spock to pursue Beckwith into the past. They are informed by the Guardians that Beckwith prevented the death of Edith Koestler, and as in the final version, Kirk falls in love with her; in this version, however, he does so knowing that she must die in the end. Emotionally, he cannot stop Beckwith from attempting to save Koestler ‚Äî Spock has to do it. Roddenberry had asked for the ship specifically to be placed in danger, and so Ellison added the renegade element in response. Roddenberry disagreed with some of Kirk's actions in the first draft, and he asked Ellison to rewrite the treatment without pay. The redraft took a further five weeks, after which Roddenberry gave more notes and Ellison took another two weeks to respond. There were still plans to film the episode in the first half of the season at that point, as a version included Yeoman Janice Rand (Grace Lee Whitney). When a version was received on May 13, Roddenberry and the executives at Desilu and NBC were all relieved‚Äîthere had been concerns over the amount of time taken, as scripts were being pitched, written, and approved in the time taken for Ellison to revise his outline. This version dropped the environmental suits due to cost, and rewrote the information given to Kirk by the Guardians, making it more general and less Earth-specific. It also changed Edith Kostler's surname to Keeler. However, the majority of the plot points were unchanged. Development of the teleplay Gene Roddenberry (pictured in 1961), was among those who re-wrote Ellison's script in an attempt to bring it within budget and enable it to be filmed Justman registered immediate concerns over the potential cost of attempting to film the treatment. He had particular concerns about a time portal effect, a scene involving a mammoth and the number of exterior and night shoots that would be required. Despite this, Roddenberry asked Ellison to turn it into a shooting script and set aside a desk for him in the assistant director's room, expecting him to attend the office every day until he finished it. Ellison ended up with a smaller office of his own at his request but disliked it sufficiently that he spent the majority of his time on set. He would play loud rock and roll music in the office, and then leave it for the set. On one occasion story editor John D. F. Black caught him on set during the filming of \\"Mudd's Women\\" and had him escorted back to the office. The music went on, and Black went back to tell Ellison to turn it down, but the writer had already climbed out the window and left. On other occasions, he worked late into the night and slept on the couch in Justman's office. As the delays added up, the slots assigned to \\"The City on the Edge of Forever\\" were reallocated to other episodes. Although this period was later claimed to be of various lengths, Ellison completed the first draft teleplay in three weeks, handing it to Justman on June 7. Black later said that Ellison always had \\"40 things going\\" in reference to him doing multiple assignments at once. In response, Ellison said that doing multiple assignments at the same time was simply how screenwriters earned a living in the 1960s. Justman's initial glee at receiving the script was short-lived. He realized quickly that it was unfilmable due to cost, and the characters were not behaving as per the writer's guide. One such exchange between Kirk and Spock had the Vulcan character accusing humans of being barbaric, while Kirk saying Spock was ungrateful because humans were more advanced than Vulcans. Justman thought it was a good script, but could never be re-written and filmed in time for the first season. Ellison was asked to revise it once more, with the issues blamed on requests from NBC, and submitted a further version a week later. The production team was starting to lose patience, as he was not revising it in line with their requests, and he began arguing with Justman over the budget issues. On August 15 Ellison turned in a second revised draft to Justman, titled \\"final draft\\" on the front cover. Justman wrote a memo immediately to fellow producer Gene L. Coon, saying that after five months, Ellison had failed to reduce the budget requirements for the episode to something that could be filmed. Roddenberry and Justman both spoke to Ellison, seeking further changes, but failed. William Shatner was sent to Ellison's house to try to get the writer to reconcile. He claimed he was shouted at and thrown off the property, but Ellison said that he had read the script through while sitting on a couch and had left to tell Roddenberry that he liked it. Ellison suggested that Shatner had a personal interest in having the script revised because Leonard Nimoy had more lines than he did in Ellison's version, and had spent the time on the couch line counting. Meanwhile, Steve Carabatsos replaced Black as story editor on the show and was told by Coon to fix the script. Carabatsos replaced the new characters with an accident involving McCoy and an overdose of adrenalin and removed the Guardians of Forever, replacing them with a time travel portal. Ellison subsequently accused him of \\"taking a chainsaw\\" to the script. Roddenberry disliked the new version sufficiently that he convinced Ellison to come back and rewrite it again. When D.C. Fontana rewrote the teleplay, she added McCoy's accidental overdose in the first act. On December 19 Ellison submitted a further revised teleplay, dated December 1. Justman suggested in a memo that Roddenberry might be able to rewrite the latest version to one that could be usable. He said that although it was a \\"fine story\\" and Ellison was an \\"extremely talented writer\\", he felt that it needed to be either rewritten by someone else or scrapped altogether. Taking this advice in hand, Roddenberry rewrote the script over the Christmas‚ÄìNew Year period, handing in a new version on January 9, 1967. His changes included the elimination of the evil version of the Enterprise and the addition of some comedy elements. Justman was pleased with Roddenberry's changes and told Coon that it was close to being filmable but that he still expected it to exceed the budget for a single episode. Dorothy Fontana was hired as a new story editor, replacing Carabatsos. She had previously been Roddenberry's secretary and was well aware of the script's problems from reading the previous versions. When she arrived at work for her first day in her new role, Roddenberry gave her a copy of his revision and told her to try rewriting it. She later referred to that day as \\"walking into a hornets' nest\\", and the script itself as a \\"live grenade\\". Among the changes in her version was the introduction of the drug cordrazine. Ellison specifically criticized this change, as his most recent version of the script called for an alien creature's venom to cause the symptoms in McCoy. He said that \\"Gene [Roddenberry] preferred having an accomplished surgeon act in such a boneheaded manner that he injects himself with a deadly drug!\\" Justman praised Fontana's version, saying that it was the version that was most likely to be shot. But he suggested that it had now lost the \\"beauty and mystery inherent in the screenplay as Harlan originally wrote it\\". He said that he felt bad, because if he had not seen Ellison's earlier versions then he would probably have been \\"thrilled\\" with Fontana's version. Still unsatisfied with the script, Roddenberry set about rewriting it once more, titling the result, dated February 1, the final draft. Ellison later called elements of the dialogue in this version \\"precisely the kind of dopey Utopian bullshit that Roddenberry loved\\", and added that Roddenberry had \\"about as much writing ability as the lowest industry hack\\". However, Shatner later believed that it was actually re-written by Gene L. Coon and only supervised by Roddenberry. Ellison requested via his agent that he be credited on the script only as Cordwainer Bird. In response, Roddenberry threatened to have Ellison blacklisted by the Writers Guild of America, and the writer was eventually convinced to be credited by name. None of the other writers involved in the work chose to seek credit for the script, since they agreed with Roddenberry that it was important for Star Trek to be associated with writers such as Ellison. =Direction and casting= Joan Collins (pictured in 1956), was a well-known actress before appearing in \\"The City on the Edge of Forever\\". Joseph Pevney was assigned as the director of this episode. He had previous experience in directing full-length films, and later explained that \\"The City on the Edge of Forever\\" was the closest episode in Star Trek to that same level of work and challenge, stating that he treated it as a film. But he was critical of Ellison's version of the script, saying that he \\"had no sense of theater\\" and it was fortunate that Roddenberry re-wrote it. He praised Ellison's level of detail in the 1930s setting, and for the general idea behind the episode. The crew were surprised when actress Joan Collins expressed an interest in appearing in the series. After her agent asked her if she wanted to appear on the show, Collins, who had never heard of it, mentioned it to her children. When her oldest daughter was enthusiastic about the show, Collins decided to accept the offer from the studio. Casting director Joe D'Agosta called her a \\"notorious actress\\", but said that at the time they saw approaches from a wide range of actors and actresses who wanted to appear on the series. Pevney said \\"Joan Collins was very good in it. She enjoyed working on the show and Bill and Leonard were both very good to her.... Using her was a good choice.\\" Collins later incorrectly recalled Keeler as a Nazi sympathiser, an error that has been repeated in biographies of the actress. Ellison said in response that this was not an intended character trait. John Harmon appeared as a hobo in \\"The City on the Edge of Forever\\" and returned in a more prominent role in \\"A Piece of the Action\\". Although some sources have credited the voice of the Guardian to James Doohan, it was actually performed by Bartell LaRue. The actor later appeared onscreen in the episode \\"Bread and Circuses\\", and provided further voiceover work in \\"The Gamesters of Triskelion\\", \\"Patterns of Force\\" and \\"The Savage Curtain\\". Also returning to Star Trek in this episode were David L. Ross as Lt. Galloway and John Winston as Lt. Kyle. =Filming and post production= Filming began on February 3, 1967, with an expectation that it would take six days to film. The shoot was completed a day and a half behind schedule on February 14. The overall cost was $245,316, compared to the budget of $191,000 for this episode. The normal budget for episodes during the first season were $185,000. Roddenberry later claimed that around $257,000 was spent on the episode, and said that he could have saved a further $20,000 if he had not insisted on high-quality casting and sets. He also claimed that the original Ellison version would have cost a further $200,000 on top of what was already spent. The shoot began on location at the Desilu Forty Acres, with Pevney aiming to complete all the location filming in a single day in order to complete the episode in the allocated six days. The site had been used previously for the episodes \\"Miri\\" and \\"The Return of the Archons\\". None of the producers expected him to do so, but with the series already $74,507 in the red and with two more episodes left to film, Desilu had to appear to NBC to be trying to keep to budget. Extensive work was completed during the daylight hours, on the set that had been used for other series such as The Andy Griffith Show, with Floyd's barbershop appearing in some of the shots. The filming continued into the night, and with Pevney running out of time, he was not sure when to stop. The problem was that other series such as Rango and Gomer Pyle had the sets booked up for the next several days, and they were unsure whether they would have time to return and film the missing scenes. After a weekend break, filming resumed on the Desilu Gower Street sets, where My Three Sons was normally shot. These were used to represent the interior of the mission where Keeler nurses McCoy back to health. DeForest Kelley felt that McCoy should also fall for Keeler; so Pevney shot the scenes with that element included but never included it in the final cut. The following two days were spent on the same sets, while on day 5 the action moved to the bridge set for the Enterprise. This day's shoot was meant to include scenes in the transporter room and in the Enterprise corridors, but by now the production was a full day behind and these were pushed to the following day. Partway through day 6, the filming moved to a neighboring set for the exterior ruin shots and the Guardian of Forever, which was used for the next two and a half days. The montage of historical footage was all taken from the Paramount film library, as was the footage of the Brooklyn Bridge. Harlan Ellison long maintained that the ancient ruins were the result of someone's misreading his description in the script of the city as \\"covered with runes\\". When informed that the word \\"runes\\" did not appear in any version of his treatments or script (or any rewrites), Ellison responded in Edge Words, the letter column of IDW's comic book adaptation of his original script, by admitting that his memory was faulty and that he actually told Matt Jefferies that the set should appear \\"Ancient, incredibly ancient, with runes everywhere...\\" He surmises that he perhaps slurred the word \\"runes\\" and Jefferies misheard him.Star Trek: Harlan Ellison's The City on the Edge of Forever, Issue 2, July 2014 =Music= There are a number of musical pieces reused from earlier episodes in \\"The City on the Edge of Forever\\", including sufficient use of the scores from \\"The Cage\\", \\"Where No Man Has Gone Before\\" and \\"The Naked Time\\" that Alexander Courage received an \\"additional music by\\" credit. Further pieces came from \\"Shore Leave\\", \\"Charlie X\\" and \\"The Enemy Within\\". A partial score was created by Fred Steiner, his final work of the first season. His work on Star Trek tended to focus on the use of violins and cellos to highlight romantic moments, and he did not use violas in any of his works on the series. This episode originally featured the 1931 song \\"Goodnight Sweetheart\\", which was originally composed by Ray Noble with lyrics by Jimmy Campbell and Reg Connelly. For the version used in the episode, the lyrics were recorded by an unknown session musician. It had been licensed to appear in the episode, and at first, Steiner sought to use motifs from \\"Goodnight, Sweetheart\\" as the basis of his score. He wanted this to be subtle and introduce the melody of the song over time, but Justman realized what Steiner was attempting and rejected it on the basis that he did not want the song introduced too early in the episode. Another work of Steiner's that was rejected for \\"The City on the Edge of Forever\\" was an alternative main title track using saxophone and celesta, which he had hoped would set the episode in the tone of the 1930s. The music recorded specifically for \\"The City on the Edge of Forever\\" was recorded in stereo, which was unusual for the series. This was rediscovered when a 15-disc soundtrack of The Original Series was being compiled by La-La Land Records, which they hypothesized was because the accompanying vocals appeared on a separate track. By the time \\"The City on the Edge of Forever\\" was released in the 1980s for home media use, such as on VHS and Laserdisc, the licence for the use of \\"Goodnight, Sweetheart\\" had lapsed and was instead picked up by a different studio. A new score was composed to replace the song where it was used in the episode, however the new pieces did not match the existing Steiner works as they used a different orchestral arrangement. Steiner was not contacted or informed of the changes to the soundtrack requirements, and this was instead composed by J. Peter Robinson. The original intention was not to restore \\"Goodnight, Sweetheart\\" to the DVD release, and issue the DVD with a disclaimer on the box, \\"Some music has been changed for this DVD.\\" However, the original \\"Goodnight, Sweetheart\\" portion was erroneously included and Paramount reportedly had to pay royalties. Since the royalties had been paid, all subsequent releases have included the original \\"Goodnight, Sweetheart\\" music and with the 1980s scores omitted. Reception =Broadcast= \\"The City on the Edge of Forever\\" was first broadcast in the United States on April 6, 1967, on NBC. A 12-city overnight Trendex report compiled by Nielsen ratings showed that during the first half-hour, it held second place in the ratings behind Bewitched on ABC with 11.64 million viewers compared to Bewitcheds 15.04 million. The episode beat My Three Sons on CBS. During the second half-hour it remained in second place with 28.4 percent of the audience share, behind the 32.1 percent for Love on a Rooftop, also on ABC. A high definition remastering of \\"The City on the Edge of Forever\\", which introduced new special effects and starship exteriors as well as enhanced music and audio, was shown for the first time on October 7, 2006, in broadcast syndication in the United States. It was the fifth remastered episode to be shown. This meant that the episode was made available to over 200 local stations across the United States with the rights to broadcast Star Trek, and depending on the station it was broadcast either on October 7 or 8. =Cast and crew response= This episode has been held in high regard by those who have worked on Star Trek. Roddenberry ranked it as one of his 10 favorite episodes, and said it was his favorite alongside \\"The Menagerie\\" and the second pilot, \\"Where No Man Has Gone Before\\". In the final interview before he died, he said it was his favorite outright. Fontana said it was one of her two favorite episodes that she was not credited for, along with \\"The Trouble with Tribbles\\". Members of the main cast have also said it was among their favorites. Shatner has often chosen either this or \\"The Devil in the Dark\\" as the best episode, saying, \\"'City' is my favorite of the original Star Trek series because of the fact it is a beautiful love story, well told.\\" Nimoy described it as one of his favorites, along with \\"The Devil in the Dark\\", \\"Amok Time\\", \\"Journey to Babel\\", \\"This Side of Paradise\\" and \\"The Naked Time\\". In his 1995 book, I Am Spock, Nimoy said that episodes such as \\"The City on the Edge of Forever\\" and \\"Amok Time\\" were \\"just as powerful and meaningful to today's audiences as they were to viewers back in the 1960s\\". Kelley said it was his favorite, adding, \\"I thought it was one of the most dramatic endings ever seen on a television show.\\" Karl Urban, who plays McCoy in the 2009 Star Trek and the sequels, said that \\"The City on the Edge of Forever\\" was one of his favorite episodes along with \\"The Corbomite Maneuver\\", \\"Amok Time\\" and \\"Arena\\". =Critical acclaim= \\"The City on the Edge of Forever\\" has been frequently cited as the best episode of all the Star Trek series and movies. In a preview of the episode in the Albuquerque Journal, it was said to be a \\"surprise variation of the 'time tunnel' theme\\" and was described as \\"an absorbing tale, a bit hard to take at times, but imaginative nonetheless\\". After Star Trek IV: The Voyage Home was released in 1986, Luis Aguilar of The Washington Post said that \\"The City on the Edge of Forever\\" was superior to the film, calling it a \\"brilliant, beautifully executed story\\". For the franchise's 30th anniversary, it was ranked as the best Star Trek episode. \\"The City on the Edge of Forever\\" has placed highly in many \\"best of\\" lists of Star Trek episodes. In a special edition of Entertainment Weekly during the fall of 1994, \\"The City on the Edge of Forever\\" was ranked number one in a comprehensive listing of all 79 episodes. The article described the episode as \\"Cosmic themes, effective acting, and a heart-wrenching ending makes this the undisputed Uber-Trek\\". 2000s onwards In their 2003 book, Beyond the Final Frontier: An Unauthorised Review of Star Trek, Mark Jones and Lance Parkin described \\"The City on the Edge of Forever\\" as \\"Rightly regarded as the highlight of original Star Trek\\" and the \\"epitome of what Star Trek does best\\". They said that having Kirk allow Keeler to die was \\"horrifying and heart-rending, adding another dimension to his character\\". Zack Handlen of The A.V. Club gave the episode an 'A' rating in 2009, describing it as \\"a justly revered classic\\". But he said that McCoy's accidental overdose was a \\"stretch\\" and gave the episode \\"a surprisingly awkward start, with little indication of the greatness that is to follow\\". He called the ending \\"brutal\\" and praised the conundrum that Kirk is placed in, faced with the death of Keeler. Handlen suggested that it would have made a better final episode of the season, instead of \\"Operation: Annihilate\\". Also in 2009, it was reviewed by Torie Atkinson and Eugene Myers for Tor.com, where they gave it a rating of six out of six. They were concerned that the episode might not live up to the memory when they re-watched it, but said \\"it remains an incredible episode, often imitated but rarely surpassed in science fiction in any medium.\\" They said that both the tragic and comedic moments helped to balance the episode, and said that the ending was abrupt but fitting because of the change in Kirk despite the Guardian's announcement of \\"all is as it was before\\". Keith DeCandido gave the episode a rating of ten out of ten when he reviewed it for Tor.com in 2015. He said that the episode centered on people, which he saw as a common theme among the great episodes of Star Trek. DeCandido supported the view of Spock, that while Keeler's compassionate nature was to be applauded, it was at the wrong time and as war with Nazi Germany was the only way. Darren Franich compared \\"The City on the Edge of Forever\\" to the 12 Monkeys television series in 2015, calling the episode \\"one of the great episodes of television\\". However, he criticised it as well, saying \\"complete crock of pseudo-scientific claptrap. It's wacky like only old science-fiction is wacky ‚Äì and it's slow like only old television is slow.\\" He listed nine \\"leaps of narrative logic\\" that a viewer must overcome to accept the plot. But he felt that it was fearless in comparison to modern science fiction, in that there was no attempt to make it self-aware, nor introduce a comedic character to ground it. Franich said that the ending was \\"one of the all-time great moments in Star Trek history\\". IGN ranked it as number one out of their \\"Top 10 Classic Star Trek Episodes\\" in 2009. It said \\"This beautiful story poignantly establishes the maxim later explored in Star Trek II: The Wrath of Khan: the needs of the many outweigh the needs of the few, or the one. Kirk's reaction before beaming up at the end of the episode is one of William Shatner's most moving moments in all of Trek.\\" In the Radio Times, David Brown listed it as the second best episode for non-Star Trek fans to watch on Netflix in 2016, calling it a \\"tragic Back to the Future\\" and that \\"seeing as the bulk of the drama takes place during the depression of the 1930s, there's not much in the way of sci-fi gubbins to confuse a newcomer\\". Jeremy Fuster at Yahoo! TV included it on a list of ten episodes to watch prior to the launch of the 2017 television series, calling it \\"one of the most heartbreaking episodes\\" of the series. In 2009, while writing for Time Magazine, John Cloud rated \\"The City on the Edge of Forever \\" as one of the top ten moments of Star Trek overall including films up to that time. Cloud noted \\"The City on the Edge of Forever\\" as \\"a tightly wound episode that sets the standard for time-travel sci-fi\\". Specific elements of the episode led to other rankings, such as Comic Book Resources (CBR) placing it as the tenth-best romantic relationship of the Star Trek franchise up to that time, between Kirk and Edith Keeler. In a listing of the best time-travel episode of all Star Trek series by CBR, it was placed first; it was placed in the same position on a similar list by Nerdist. The episode remained popular throughout the 2010s, with British Magazine SciFiNow ranking it as the best episode of The Original Series in 2010. The A.V. Club called it one of the top ten \\"must see\\" episodes in 2012, as did Newsweek in 2016. It was named as one of the 25 essential episodes of the franchise by Vox in 2016. In 2017, Business Insider ranked \\"The City on the Edge of Forever\\" the second best episode of the original series; as did PopMatters a year later. =Awards= Harlan Ellison's original version of the teleplay won the annual Writers Guild of America Award for Best Episodic Drama on Television. Justman later said that the submission of the original unfilmed version was out of spite, and Roddenberry said in response to the victory \\"many people would get prizes if they wrote scripts that budgeted out to three times the show's cost.\\" The WGA rules allow only the credited writers to submit scripts for consideration, who may submit whichever draft of theirs that they may choose. It was up against another Star Trek episode, nominated by the production team; \\"The Return of the Archons\\". Coon reportedly said at the time: \\"If Harlan wins, I'm going to die\\", and that \\"there are two scripts up tonight for the Writers' Guild Award, and I wrote them both.\\" On that night, Roddenberry and several of the crew were seated at a table that Desilu had purchased, while Ellison was at another. When he won, the Star Trek party rose to their feet and applauded, since they believed it would bring credibility to the series. Herbert Franklin Solow later recalled that this elation turned to horror when Ellison began talking about the interference of studio executives in the writing process, before holding aloft a copy of the original script and yelling \\"Remember, never let them rewrite you!\\" Ellison walked past the Desilu table as he left the podium, and shook the copy of the script at Roddenberry and his party. When Glen A. Larson claimed that it was Coon who had rewritten the original script and it was this version that was submitted to the Writer's Guild, Ellison said that \\"pandas will fly out of Glen Larson's ass!\\". He explained that as the credited writer, he had the option of which version of the script to submit to the Guild. A further claim was made by writer Don Ingalls, who said that Ellison had admitted in a drunken stupor to him late one night in a bar that he had tidied up and improved the script further prior to submitting it; this was then published in Justman and Solow's Inside Star Trek: The Real Story. Ellison repudiated Ingalls' claim, pointing out that he never drank since he did not like the taste and had never been drunk and so this could not have occurred. Upon being informed, Solow promised to add a note refuting the claim in a future paperback edition, but then decided to agree with Ingalls version of the story. \\"The City on the Edge of Forever\\" was awarded the Hugo Award in 1968 for the \\"Best Dramatic Presentation\\" at that year's World Science Fiction Convention. This was based on the filmed version, and not Ellison's original. But since the script remained credited to Ellison, he won the award once more. It was 25 years before another television program won that award again, the next occasion being for the episode \\"The Inner Light\\" from Star Trek: The Next Generation. Roddenberry later claimed that he was present at the Hugo Awards, and said that Ellison rushed past him up onto the stage. However, he was not present. Ellison remarked afterwards when talking about the Hugo win for the filmed version of the script, \\"I would like to be arrogant enough to think that the script was so good that even butchering it couldn't hurt it\\" and that compared to the other episodes of Star Trek that it was \\"a pretty good show\\". Roddenberry claimed, in response to Ellison's awards wins for the episode, that he had won a Nebula Award for his work on it. However, this was untrue, and the Dramatic Presentation category was not created until 1974. Home media release and other adaptations The first adaptation of \\"The City on the Edge of Forever\\" was as a re-working into a short story by author James Blish in the novel Star Trek 2. He attempted to combine elements of both the televised version with aspects of Ellison's original version after being sent a copy of the original script by Ellison. The front cover of the British release of the book featured the Guardian of Forever. This was republished in 2016 alongside the Blish short stories of 44 other episodes in a single volume as Star Trek: The Classic Episodes. The first home media release of \\"The City on the Edge of Forever\\" was on Compact Cassette from Startone productions in 1982. A LaserDisc of the episode, alongside \\"The Alternative Factor\\" was released in 1985. Further releases of all episodes of the series were made on VHS and Betamax.Kelley (2008): p. 249Kelley (2008): p. 250 \\"The City on the Edge of Forever\\" was released on DVD paired with \\"Errand of Mercy\\" as part of the general release of the series in 2000, and as part of the season one DVD set in 2004. The episode was included in the remastered season one release on DVD and Blu-ray in 2009. The remastered version included revamped and expanded special effects by CBS Digital under the guidance of Dave Rossi, as well as Mike and Denise Okuda. Changes included an expanded field of ruins on the Guardian's planet, as well as updated visuals of the planet from space. Rossi explained that they sought to tie the purple cloth backdrop used in the original version into the redesign, but was concerned that the \\"giant purplish desert flats\\" as seen from space were instead misconstrued as oceans. \\"The City on the Edge of Forever\\" was also featured in several DVD sets featuring compilations of episodes, including the Star Trek: Fan Collective: Captain's Log, as selected by Shatner, and Captain Kirk's Boldest Missions in 2015. Legacy =Ellison-Roddenberry feud= During the period in which the script was being developed, Roddenberry asked Ellison for his help in saving the show. In response, Ellison agreed with other science fiction writers, including Richard Matheson, Theodore Sturgeon and Frank Herbert to form \\"The Committee\\". Ellison wrote on their behalf to the combined membership of the recent World Science Fiction Convention to ask them to write in to NBC to save the show. Shatner later credited Ellison for saving the show during the first season. But after the work was completed on the episode, Roddenberry and Ellison did not speak for several years. Ellison said he felt used, while Roddenberry said he was being unfair and had unjustly condemned the episode, loudly and in public. Ellison sold copies of his original script at conventions, while Roddenberry's Lincoln Enterprises sold the filmed version. In 1975, Ellison copyrighted the version of the first draft script as it was returned to him with notes, which was then published in Six Science Fiction Plays by Simon & Schuster. By this time, he and Roddenberry had taken conciliatory steps toward each other, and he was invited to pitch a story idea for a late 1970s Star Trek film, despite calling Star Trek \\"dead\\" in an interview with The Washington Post when the film project was first announced. This did not last. Roddenberry claimed in an interview with Video Review magazine that Ellison wrote into the script that he had Scotty dealing drugs and when asked to remove it, Ellison claimed that Roddenberry had \\"sold out\\". At no point in any of the versions of the outlines or scripts did Scotty deal or take drugs. Roddenberry repeated this claim around the same period in 1987, including to Ben Harnson in an interview for Cinefantastique magazine, and on the convention lecture circuit. Two issues later, writer Alan Brennert wrote into the letters page of Video Review asserting that Scotty had never sold drugs in any version of the script. In response, Roddenberry wrote to Brennert, dated March 25, 1987, and admitted to mistakenly attributing the drug dealing to Scotty. Despite this, other publications have repeated the incorrect claim by Roddenberry. Roddenberry also claimed to have created the Edith Keeler character and based her on his father, a police officer, in an interview with Humanist magazine in March 1991. Until approached by TV Guide in December 1994, Ellison did not discuss the issues with the episode in print other than the introduction in Six Science Fiction Plays. He was reluctant to discuss it for the magazine, and to make them go away, asked for a sum of money he believed was five times more than the magazine had ever paid for an interview. To his surprise, the magazine agreed. So he wrote the article, which immediately generated a backlash from Star Trek fans. In his 1996 book, Harlan Ellison's The City On the Edge of Forever, Ellison claimed to have never received more than a \\"pittance\\" from working on the episode. He said \\"every thug and studio putz and semi-literate bandwagon-jumper and merchandiser has grown fat as a maggot in a corpse off what I created.\\" He said that was the reason why he wrote the book. On March 13, 2009, Ellison filed a lawsuit against CBS Television Studios, seeking 25% of net receipts from merchandising, publishing and other income from the episode since 1967; the suit also named the Writers Guild of America for repeatedly failing to act on Ellison's behalf on the matter. In a press statement, Ellison said, \\"It ain't about the 'principle,' friend, it's about the money! Pay me! I'm doing it for the 35-year-long disrespect and the money!\\" On October 22, 2009, the lawsuit was settled with Ellison claiming he was satisfied with the outcome. =Guardian of Forever= The Guardian of Forever, the time portal portrayed in the episode, is an irregular ring (or torus) shaped structure around wide. The Guardian's only other on-screen appearance was in the animated episode \\"Yesteryear\\" (1973), in which the Guardian's voice was provided by James Doohan (who portrays Chief Engineer Montgomery Scott). A return for the Guardian in The Next Generation was proposed by Trent Christopher Ganino and Eric A. Stillwell during the writing of the episode \\"Yesterday's Enterprise\\". This would have seen a team of Vulcan scientists led by Sarek studying the Guardian, and accidentally travelling back in time to the history of their planet where they cause the death of Surak, the founder of Vulcan logic. After they return, they discover that their people had allied with the Romulans and were at war with the Federation. In response, Sarek elects to return to the past and take on the role of Surak to restore the timeline. Producer Michael Piller wanted the plot to be centered on the cast of The Next Generation, so Sarek and the Guardian were dropped from the story. Non-canon novels and short stories The Guardian of Forever has also appeared in several Star Trek novels. The first appearance was in Star Trek: The New Voyages, a compilation of short stories that was the first anthology of Star Trek fiction. The short story \\"Mind Sifter\\" by Shirley S. Maiewski saw Captain Kirk stranded on 1950s Earth in a mental hospital, having been abducted by Kor, subjected to a Klingon mind sifter, and transported through the Guardian of Forever. In A.C. Crispin's 1983 novel Yesterday's Son, the Guardian is used by Kirk, Spock and McCoy to visit Sarpeidon in the past from the episode \\"All Our Yesterdays\\". There they discover that the subject of Spock's romantic liaison, Zarabeth, had died years before but she had given birth to his son, Zar. An audio recording by Nimoy and George Takei was subsequently released. After the success of the book, Crispin was asked to write a sequel, Time for Yesterday in 1988, in which the Guardian is malfunctioning and the Enterprise crew must seek the help of Zar to communicate and repair it. Peter David decided to base his 1992 novel Imzadi on the same premise as the end of Ellison's version of \\"The City on the Edge of Forever\\", except in this case it was William Riker who went back in time using the Guardian deliberately to save the life of Deanna Troi. He felt that if Ellison was not allowed to use the idea in the episode, he could instead feature the premise in a novel. The Guardian was also central to the plot of Judith and Garfield Reeves-Stevens' 1994 novel Federation as it recites three historical events to Captain Kirk. Brett Hudgins short story Guardians was featured in the seventh volume of Star Trek: Strange New Worlds in 2004, an annually published work of fan stories. In the story, the Horta from \\"The Devil in the Dark\\" colonise the Guardian's \\"Time Planet\\" and end up acting as its protectors for the following generations over the following 50,000 years. David R. George III decided to include the Guardian and spin-off from events in \\"The City on the Edge of Forever\\" in his 2006 trilogy, Crucible. In Provenance of Shadows, the installment of the trilogy based on McCoy, part of the book is based in the reality where McCoy is trapped in the past and no-one comes to rescue him. The events of \\"The City on the Edge of Forever\\" are also recounted in the fictional The Autobiography of James T. Kirk by David A. Goodman; the author said that the effects of the episode and the loss of Keeler would affect Kirk for a long time and may have been why the character never entered into a serious ongoing relationship. Non-canon comics and computer games In the Gold Key Comics Star Trek line, the Guardian of Forever appeared in the story \\"No Time Like the Past\\" by George Kashdan and Al McWilliams and appearing in issue 56, published October 1978. Kirk, Spock and McCoy must correct history after another traveller uses the Guardian to the second century BC, and they confront both Hannibal and the Romans. In the second volume of DC Comics run of Star Trek comics, the Guardian appears in issues 53 through 57 within the story \\"Timecrime\\" by Howard Weinstein, Rod Whigham, Rob Davis, and Arne Starr. IDW Publishing published Ellison's script as a comic book under the title of \\"Star Trek: Harlan Ellison's Original The City On The Edge Of Forever Teleplay\\" in 2014. Chief Creative Officer and Editor-in-Chief Chris Ryall said \\"Presenting Harlan Ellison's brilliant original script for 'City on the Edge' has been a goal of ours since IDW first began publishing Star Trek comics in 2007\\". Ellison worked alongside IDW on the comic, with artwork by J.K. Woodward and additional writing by Scott Tipton and David Tipton. Ellison said of the format, \\"To read a graphic novel is to engage your imagination is to engage all five of your senses and to picture what the creator dreamed. And that's what this book does for me.\\" In the massively multiplayer online role-playing game Star Trek Online, the mission \\"City on the Edge of Never\\" involves the player character using the Guardian to travel through time to 2270 to stop Klingons intent on altering history. The episode features the USS Kirk, and has the Guardian projecting a time portal into space, allowing the player to take their vessel through to the past. It featured voice acting by Nimoy and was well received by reviewers with Kotaku writer Mike Fahey saying \\"This mission might have just made the entire game for me. Everything about it was simply perfect. If Star Trek Online fails for some reason, this mission will always be remembered.\\" =\\"Let's get the hell out of here\\", Nazis, and other influences= Kirk's final line in the episode, \\"Let's get the hell out of here\\" caused problems for the crew as the network did not want the word \\"hell\\" to appear in television episodes. Both Shatner and Roddenberry fought for the line to remain, with Roddenberry claiming to NBC that no other word would be suitable to be used instead. The studio executives agreed that it could be left in, and it was one of the first occasions in which the word \\"hell\\" was used as profanity on television. The episode was also the first time that the Nazis were mentioned in Star Trek; they featured more prominently in the second-season episode \\"Patterns of Force\\" as well as a pair of two-part episodes, one each from other Trek franchises: one from Star Trek: Voyager as \\"The Killing Game\\" and the other from Star Trek: Enterprise as \\"Storm Front\\". When a Star Trek film was being developed in the late 1970s, one of the ideas proposed by Roddenberry was to have the crew travel back to the 1960s and prevent the assassination of John F. Kennedy. This idea was based on \\"The City on the Edge of Forever\\", due to the episode's popularity among fans by that time. The episode was also suggested by Robert F. Moss in The New York Times as later influencing the plot of Star Trek IV: The Voyage Home. When Nimoy met Harve Bennett to discuss proposed plots for the film, it was Bennett's love of \\"The City on the Edge of Forever\\" that led to him suggesting that they should include a time travel element in the film. This led to the duo discussing the potential plot with Ellison. A reference to \\"The City on the Edge of Forever\\" was included in the two-part Star Trek: Deep Space Nine episode \\"Past Tense\\", with a boxing poster appearing in a scene set in the 1930s featuring Kid McCook and Mike Mason. There was a similar poster advertising a match at Madison Square Garden in \\"The City on the Edge of Forever\\", while the one in \\"Past Tense\\" stated that it was a rematch in San Francisco.

R√ºppell is occasionally transliterated to \\"Rueppell\\" for the English alphabet. R√ºppell was born at Frankfurt-on-Main, the son of a very prosperous banker. He was originally destined to be a merchant, but after a visit to Sinai in 1817 he developed an interest in natural history. He attended lectures at the University of Pavia and University of Genoa in botany and zoology. R√ºppell set off on his first expedition in 1821, accompanied by surgeon Michael Hey as his assistant. They travelled through the Sinai desert, and in 1822 were the first European explorers to reach the Gulf of Aqaba. They then proceeded to Alexandria via Mount Sinai. In 1823 they travelled up the Nile to Nubia, collecting specimens in the area south of Ambukol, returning to Cairo in July 1825. A planned journey through Ethiopia only reached as far as Massawa, where the party suffered ill health. R√ºppell returned to Europe in 1827. During his absence Philipp Jakob Cretzschmar had used specimens sent back by R√ºppell to produce the Atlas zu der Reise im nordlichen Afrika (Atlas of Travels in northern Africa) (1826). In 1830 R√ºppell returned to Africa, and became the first naturalist to traverse Ethiopia.

The 20th episode of the series overall, it originally aired on Comedy Central in the United States on June 17, 1998. The episode was written by series co-creator Trey Parker, along with Nancy M. Pimental, and directed by Parker. It guest stars Henry Winkler, Jay Leno, and Brent Musburger. In the episode, the boys reminisce about past experiences as their school bus is left teetering on the edge of a cliff. Ms. Crabtree leaves to seek help, but forgets about the children when she meets a truck driver named Marcus.Dyess- Nugent, Phil (August 12, 2012). \\"South Park (Classic): \\"City on the Edge of Forever\\"/\\"Summer Sucks\\"\\". The A.V. Club. Retrieved December 31, 2016. Plot The children are on the bus, following a diversion along a mountain pass. When Ms. Crabtree gets distracted by the kids, the bus veers off the road and nearly goes over a cliff. She leaves to seek help, telling the kids not to leave the bus, because \\"a big scary monster\\" will eat them. The kids remain there and remember past experiences (featuring clips from previous episodes), although they usually end with everyone enjoying ice cream (as noted by new animated sequences). When a student tries to leave the bus, a gigantic black monster kills him before disappearing; later on, the black monster returns and kills Kenny. Meanwhile, Ms. Crabtree meets a truckdriver named Marcus. He takes her to a club where Carrot Top is performing and Ms. Crabtree insults him, which appeals to the audience. Marcus takes her to an agent, who finds her funny and hires her as a comedian. By now, she has forgotten about rescuing the stranded children. She soon quits, but she and Marcus remain close. Back in South Park, Mr. Mackey convinces the parents that their children have run away, so they write a song and perform it on television. The children see this on a TV in the bus and are embarrassed. An argument between Kyle correcting Cartman's past experience causes the bus to go over the cliff; it lands in a gigantic tub of ice cream. Cartman suddenly realizes how little sense everything makes and wakes up in his own bed. As he explains his dream to his mother, she offers him beetles for breakfast and ice cream as well. Stan wakes up in his bed, and calls Kyle to tell him about the dream. Ms. Crabtree and Marcus are shown sitting on a log near Stark's Pond - Marcus explains that this is all a kid's dream, but Ms. Crabtree says she just wants to enjoy the moment a little longer.

(; May 20, 1861 ‚Äì November 23, 1919) was an American mechanical engineer and management consultant who is best known for his work in the development of scientific management. He created the Gantt chart in the 1910s. Gantt charts were employed on major infrastructure projects including the Hoover Dam and Interstate highway system and continue to be an important tool in project management and program management.  Biography  =Early life, education and family= Gantt was born to a slave- owning plantation family in Calvert County, Maryland at the outbreak of the American Civil War. When the war ended the family lost their slaves and land, and moved to Baltimore.Leon P. Alford, Henry Laurence Gantt: Leader in Industry (ASME, 1934). p. 5-6 He graduated from McDonogh School in 1878 and from Johns Hopkins University in 1880, and then returned to the McDonogh School to teach for three years. He subsequently received a Masters of Engineering degree in mechanical engineering from the Stevens Institute of Technology in New Jersey.Morgen Witzel (2005). Encyclopedia of History of American Management. p. 192 Henry Gantt married Mary E. Snow of Fitchburg, Massachusetts on 29 Nov 1899. =Career= In 1884, Gantt began working as a draughtsman at the iron foundry and machine-shop Poole & Hunt in Baltimore.Bernard C. Hilton (2005). A History of Production Planning and Control, 1750-2000, p. 64 In 1887 he joined Frederick W. Taylor in applying scientific management principles to the work at Midvale Steel and Bethlehem Steel, working there with Taylor until 1893. In his later career as an industrial consultant and following the invention of the Gantt chart, he designed the 'task and bonus' system of wage payment and additional measurement methods worker efficiency and productivity. In 1908-09 he undertook projects at Joseph Bancroft & Sons CompanyNelson, Daniel, and Stuart Campbell. \\"Taylorism versus welfare work in American industry: HL Gantt and the Bancrofts.\\" Business History Review 46.1 (1972): 1-16. and Williams & Wilkins.Kelly, Paul J., and Peter B. Petersen. 'Scientific Management and the Williams & Wilkins Company (1908-1909)' Academy of Management Proceedings (1992). In 1916, influenced by Thorsten Veblen Gantt set up the New Machine, an association which sought to apply the criteria of industrial efficiency to the political process. With the Marxist Walter Polakov he led a breakaway from the 1916 ASME conference to call for socialising industrial production under the control of managers incorporating Polakov's analysis of inefficiency in the industrial context. Henry Gantt is listed under Stevens Institute of Technology alumni.Stevens Institute Indicator, Vol. 25-26.

Work  Henry Gantt's legacy to project management is the following: * The Gantt chart: Still accepted as an important management tool today, it provides a graphic schedule for the planning and controlling of work, and recording progress towards stages of a project. The chart has a modern variation, Program Evaluation and Review Technique (PERT). * Industrial Efficiency: Industrial efficiency can only be produced by the application of scientific analysis to all aspects of the work in progress. The industrial management role is to improve the system by eliminating chance and accidents.Chatfield, Michael. \\"Gantt, Henry Laurence (1861-1919).\\" History of Accounting: An International Encyclopedia, edited by Michael Chatfield and Richard Vangermeersch. New York: Garland Publishing, 1996. P. 269. * The Task And Bonus System: He linked the bonus paid to managers to how well they taught their employees to improve performance. * The social responsibility of business: He believed that businesses have obligations to the welfare of the society in which they operate. = Gantt charts = A Gantt chart showing three kinds of schedule dependencies (in red) and percent complete indications. Gantt created many different types of charts.The discussion of Gantt charts here described originally appeared in Herrmann (2005): Herrmann, Jeffrey W., History of Decision-Making Tools for Production Scheduling, Proceedings of the 2005 Multidisciplinary Conference on Scheduling: Theory and Applications, New York, July 18‚Äì21, 2005. He designed his charts so that foremen or other supervisors could quickly know whether production was on schedule, ahead of schedule, or behind schedule. Modern project management software includes this critical function. Gantt (1903) describes two types of balances: * the \\"man‚Äôs record\\", which shows what each worker should do and did do, and * the \\"daily balance of work\\", which shows the amount of work to be done and the amount that is done. Gantt gives an example with orders that will require many days to complete. The daily balance has rows for each day and columns for each part or each operation. At the top of each column is the amount needed. The amount entered in the appropriate cell is the number of parts done each day and the cumulative total for that part. Heavy horizontal lines indicate the starting date and the date that the order should be done. According to Gantt, the graphical daily balance is \\"a method of scheduling and recording work\\". In this 1903 article, Gantt also describes the use of: * \\"production cards\\" for assigning work to each operator and recording how much was done each day. = Work, Wages, and Profits, 1916 = In his 1916 book \\"Work, Wages, and Profits\\" Gantt explicitly discusses scheduling, especially in the job shop environment. He proposes giving to the foreman each day an \\"order of work\\" that is an ordered list of jobs to be done that day. Moreover, he discusses the need to coordinate activities to avoid \\"interferences\\". However, he also warns that the most elegant schedules created by planning offices are useless if they are ignored, a situation that he observed. = Organizing for Work, 1919 = In his 1919 book \\"Organizing for Work\\" Gantt gives two principles for his charts: * one, measure activities by the amount of time needed to complete them; * two, the space on the chart can be used to represent the amount of the activity that should have been done in that time. Gantt shows a progress chart that indicates for each month of the year, using a thin horizontal line, the number of items produced during that month. In addition, a thick horizontal line indicates the number of items produced during the year. Each row in the chart corresponds to an order for parts from a specific contractor, and each row indicates the starting month and ending month of the deliveries. It is the closest thing to the Gantt charts typically used today in scheduling systems, though it is at a higher level than machine scheduling. Gantt's machine record chart and man record chart are quite similar, though they show both the actual working time for each day and the cumulative working time for a week. Each row of the chart corresponds to an individual machine or operator. These charts do not indicate which tasks were to be done, however. = Henry Gantt and Karol Adamiecki = A novel method of displaying interdependencies of processes to increase visibility of production schedules was invented in 1896 by Karol Adamiecki, which was similar to the one defined by Gantt in 1903. However, Adamiecki did not publish his works in a language popular in the West; hence Gantt was able to popularize a similar method, which he developed around the years 1910‚Äì1915, and the solution became attributed to Gantt. With minor modifications, what originated as the Adamiecki's chart is now more commonly referred to as the Gantt Chart.Peter W. G. Morris, The Management of Projects, Thomas Telford, 1994, , Google Print, p.18  Publications  Gantt published several articles and books. A selection: * Henry L.

He was one of the most colour-sensitive Estonian painters of the first decades of the 20th century, and M√§gi's works on motifs of the island of Saaremaa are the first modern Estonian nature paintings. Life and works M√§gi received his elementary art education from the drawing courses of the German Artisans' Society of Tartu (1899‚Äì1902.) At the same time, he was keenly engaged in theater, violin, and various sports. M√§gi continued his art education as an unattached student in Saint Petersburg (1903‚Äì1905), studying under Amandus Adamson. In the autumn of 1907, he went to Paris. There M√§gi studied at a free academy. From 1908 to 1910, he lived in Norway. In 1912, M√§gi returned to Tartu, where he worked as an art teacher. In √Öland, he created delicate plant vignettes in the style of Art Nouveau: Kahekesi (Two together; 1908; China ink drawing). In Paris, M√§gi was influenced by Impressionism and Fauvism, which had a significant impact on his colours: Lilleline v√§li majakesega (A flower field with a little house; 1908‚Äì1909), Norra maastik m√§nniga (A Norwegian landscape with a pine; 1910). From 1918, the influence of Expressionism is manifest, fostered by M√§gi's extreme sensitivity and emotional response to the anxious times: P√ºhaj√§rv (Lake P√ºha); (1918‚Äì1920), Otep√§√§ maastik (Landscape of Otep√§√§; (1918‚Äì1920). Also influenced by Expressionism are his big figure compositions Piet√† (1919), Kolgata (Golgatha) (1921). M√§gi's new artistic period, begun on a trip to Italy, brought calmer tempers: Varemed Capril (Ruins in Capri; 1922‚Äì1923). Along with nature pictures, he painted flowers and portraits. M√§gi's mostly beautiful female models express the Art Nouveau ideal of beauty: Holsti (1916). In his later portraits from the 1920s, a more serious temper is expressed: Madonna (1923‚Äì1924).

It helped online gamers find game servers. ASE took two years to develop and was introduced as shareware on June 15, 2001. Despite UDP Soft lacking the marketing power of GameSpy, ASE's popularity grew swiftly and steadily. It was sold to Yahoo! for an undisclosed sum in September 2004.  Yahoo! All-Seeing Eye  The purchase by Yahoo! was a defensive move against acquisition activity by CNet and others, and a desire on Yahoo!'s part to tap into the hard-core gaming market. At the time of the acquisition, All-Seeing Eye had over 12M downloads, and was actively used by more than a million gamers per month. While some mistakenly assumed the acquisition was in some way a move against Xfire, the reality is that Ultimate Arena had only rebranded themselves as XFire a couple of months prior to the ASE acquisition, and announced an impending launch of their product. Further, instant-messaging-based applications such as XFire at its launch, differed greatly from first-generation server browsing applications such as GameSpy 3D (Arcade is second-generation) and All-Seeing Eye and even Roger Wilco \\"TF Soldiers\\". Subsequently, that gap has been closed. Months later, XFire was the target of a Yahoo! lawsuit over an alleged patent infringement, partly because Xfire's two primary developers were previously engineers on the Yahoo! Games team, where they had authored a patent (granted to Yahoo!) on messenger-based game play notification. The legal battle was resolved in January 2006 with details of the settlement remaining unknown. ASE's continued development was limited after Yahoo! acquired it, and at the time of writing there is only an unofficial forum where people can exchange hand-made updates. As a result, scanning for games developed after 2005 became problematic, and although the application's life cycle has been extended by community-developed filters, without a major update to the program's core, ASE had an uncertain future. As a result, many game enthusiasts have since actively boycotted Yahoo services. In March and April 2008 Yahoo! sent emails to ASE subscribers informing them that ASE will be discontinued as of 15 May 2008 and that a $15 refund will be issued to current subscribers. ASE has now been officially shut down, including all of their tracking servers. All games that previously used the ASE service will no longer display server listings. Yahoo! now redirects users seeking ASE to GameSpy Arcade, which has since been shut down also.

Alberto Ferrero La Marmora (or Della Marmora; 7 April 1789 ‚Äì 18 March 1863) was an Italian soldier and naturalist. He was elder brother to Alessandro Ferrero La Marmora, soldier and founder of the Bersaglieri, and to Alfonso Ferrero La Marmora, Italian general and statesman. Born in Turin but educated at the Ecole Militaire de Fontainebleau, graduating in 1807, and was commissioned as a 2nd Lieutenant of infantry in the French Army. He was the second of four brothers, all of whom had distinguished military careers. He served under MacDonald in Calabria and in 1809 he joined the army of the Kingdom of Italy, participating in the campaign in Venetia. He fought at the Battle of Bautzen at the age of 24 and following the defeat of the combined Russian and Prussian forces in that engagement he was personally decorated with the Legion d'Honneur by Napoleon Bonaparte. After Napoleon's abdication Marmora gave his allegiance to the House of Savoy, the ruling house of the Kingdom of Sardinia. Marmora was posted to Sardinia but was forced to resign his commission during the insurrection of 1820‚Äì21 due to his sympathy with the rebels. Three years later he was recalled to active service, mainly on Sardinia. Despite his liberal sympathies he rose to the rank of General and in 1840 he was given command of the Royal School of Marines. He became Governor-General of Sardinia in 1849, eventually retiring to Turin where he died age 73 on 18 March 1863. He wrote Viaggio in Sardegna (Travels in Sardinia) in 1860, which extended the study of the island previously made by Francesco Cetti. Many of the animals collected by La Marmora were sent to Franco Andrea Bonelli at Turin University, and he also corresponded with Bonelli's successor, Giuseppe Gen√©. He sent the first specimens of the warbler that bears his name, Sylvia sarda or Marmora's warbler, to Turin, where his description was read out at the Turin Academy on 28 August 1819.

Etymology  The term is usually understood to be an allusion to the camouflaged hole constructed by the trapdoor spider. According to United States Marine Corps historian Major Chuck Melson, the term originated in the American Civil War, when it meant a hastily dug foxhole. The American columnist William Safire claimed in the December 15, 2003, issue of the New York Times that the term originated in the Vietnam War. According to Safire, one of the characteristics of these holes was that they held a \\"clay pot large enough to hold a crouching man.\\" If the pot broke, the soldier was exposed to attack from snakes or spiders, hence the name \\"spider hole\\".  Design  A spider hole is typically a shoulder-deep, protective, round hole, often covered by a camouflaged lid, in which a soldier can stand and fire a weapon. A spider hole differs from a typical foxhole in that a foxhole is usually deeper and designed to emphasize cover rather than concealment.  Use  Spider holes were used during World War II by Japanese forces on many Pacific battlefields, including Leyte in the Philippines and Iwo Jima.Cannon, M. Hamlin. Leyte: The Return to the Philippines. U.S. Army Center of Military History, 1954., p 211 They called them for a fancied resemblance to the pots used to catch octopuses in Japan. Spider holes were also used by Vietnamese Communist fighters during the Vietnam War.

Michael Straczynski. The show centers on the Babylon 5 space station: a focal point for politics, diplomacy, and conflict during the years 2257‚Äì2262. With its prominent use of planned story arcs, the series was often described as a \\"novel for television\\". The pilot film premiered on February 22, 1993. The regular series aired from January 26, 1994, and ran for five full seasons. Due to Warner corporate structure and policy concerning syndication in general, and syndication of properties produced by the defunct PTEN division in particular, the show has been syndicated only briefly, and did not appear on U.S. television from 2003 through 2018 (though it has aired in other countries). In 2018, the show began airing nightly on the Comet TV Sci-Fi Network. The show spawned six television films and a spin-off series, Crusade, which aired in 1999 and ran for 13 episodes. On July 31, 2007, a DVD was released containing two short films about selected characters from the series. The five seasons of the series each correspond to one fictional sequential year in the period 2258‚Äì2262. Each season shares its name with an episode that is central to that season's plot. As the series starts, the Babylon 5 station is welcoming ambassadors from various races in the galaxy. Earth has just barely survived an accidental war with the powerful Minbari, who, despite their superior technology, mysteriously surrendered at the brink of the destruction of the human race. Some episodes in the second season were aired out of their intended chronological sequence. Straczynski confirmed that in Season 2, \\"A Race Through Dark Places\\" should precede \\"Soul Mates,\\" and that \\"Knives\\" should precede \\"In the Shadow of Z'ha'dum.\\"  Series overview   Episodes  = Pilot film (1993) = = Season 1: Signs and Portents (1994) = During 2258, Commander Jeffrey Sinclair is in charge of the station, assisted by executive officer Susan Ivanova and security chief Michael Garibaldi. The season traces his gradual recollection of his capture by the Minbari during their war with humans. The Minbari came to believe that Sinclair carried the soul of Valen, a revered Minbari leader. Inferring that Minbari souls were being reborn as humans, the Minbari surrendered to avoid further fratricide. This action is a source of internal strife between some Minbari. Meanwhile, tensions between the Centauri Republic, an empire in decline, and the Narn Regime, a former Centauri dominion which successfully rebelled, are increasing. Seeking for his people to regain their former prominence, Mollari makes a deal with a mysterious ally, Mr. Morden, to strike back at the Narn. On Earth, some humans resent the influence of aliens, and seek to eliminate them from Earth-owned property, including Babylon 5. Minbari Ambassador Delenn is revealed to belong to the Grey Council, the Minbari ruling body. She eventually transforms into a Minbari/human hybrid, ostensibly to build a bridge between the humans and Minbari. The year ends with the death of Earth Alliance president Luis Santiago, which the staff of Babylon 5 believe to have been an assassination. = Season 2: The Coming of Shadows (1994‚Äì1995) = Captain John Sheridan assumes the military governance of the station after Sinclair is reassigned, without explanation, to Minbar. He and the command staff discover that now- president Morgan Clark arranged the assassination of President Santiago. Conflict develops between the Babylon 5 command staff and the Psi Corps, an increasingly autocratic organization which oversees and controls the lives of human telepaths. Ambassador Mollari, in preparation for the death of the ailing Centauri Emperor, works with Lord Refa to assassinate any challengers to the throne, while continuing to utilize Mr. Morden and his \\"associates\\"‚Äîthe Shadows‚Äîagainst the Narn. When the emperor dies, Mollari and Refa place the emperor's unstable nephew, Cartagia, on the throne. Through him they instigate full-scale war with the Narn, using weapons of mass destruction to conquer the Narn homeworld. Earth's government becomes more totalitarian, suppressing dissent and broadcasting propaganda. Kosh and other Vorlons approach Sheridan and reveal themselves to be the enemies of the Shadows, asking for Sheridan's help to fight them. = Season 3: Point of No Return (1995‚Äì1996) = Earth's government continues to become more xenophobic, while on Babylon 5, Sheridan and Delenn, who have become romantically involved, create a \\"conspiracy of light\\" to try to reveal the truth behind the Shadows' influence. Historically tense relations between Earth and its Mars colony reach breaking point when Mars declares independence and Earth's government declares martial law and attacks. Sheridan, outraged, withdraws Babylon 5 from the Earth Alliance, supported by the Minbari. The fate of Babylon 4 is discovered when Sinclair returns to the station to request Sheridan's help: Sinclair had been destined to use time travel to take Babylon 4 back in time to the previous Minbari- Shadow war, where he is transformed into the revered Minbari leader, Valen, using the same device Delenn used for her transformation. Ambassador Mollari realizes his deal with the Shadows has become dangerous and tries to sever ties with Mr. Morden, but fails. Kosh informs Sheridan that the Shadows can be fought with telepaths. The Vorlons attack the Shadows at Sheridan's insistence, but the Shadows kill Kosh in retaliation. Sheridan's wife, presumed dead on an archaeological dig on the planet Z'ha'dum years earlier, arrives at the station and convinces Sheridan to accompany her to Z'ha'dum. The Shadows attempt to force Sheridan to join their cause, their ships threatening Babylon 5. Sheridan, guided by Kosh's words, flies a vessel loaded with explosives into the planet while jumping into a large chasm. The Shadow ships withdraw, but Garibaldi, deployed to defend the station, does not return. = Season 4: No Surrender, No Retreat (1996‚Äì1997) = Sheridan returns from Z'ha'dum with the help of a strange being known as Lorien, who has given Sheridan 20 more years to live. The Vorlons alarm the other races when they begin destroying entire planets that have been influenced by the Shadows. Mollari, fearing the Vorlons will destroy Centauri Prime, destroys the Shadow base there and executes Mr. Morden. Sheridan learns that the Vorlons and Shadows were tasked as caretakers for younger races in the galaxy, but due to profound differences in ideology have been at war for eons, using the younger races as pawns in a proxy war. With the help of other ancient races, Sheridan convinces the Vorlons and Shadows to leave and cease interfering with the younger races. Garibaldi returns to Babylon 5, with no explanation for his disappearance. He has unexplained changes in behavior and distances himself from the command staff, resigning and relocating to Mars to work with tycoon William Edgars. He also subdues Sheridan, allowing the latter to be kidnapped. It is revealed that Garibaldi was co-opted by the Psi-Corps to spy on Edgars, who is found to be developing a virus to destroy telepaths. With the Vorlons and Shadows gone, Earth's totalitarian government attempts to use the captured Sheridan as a propaganda tool, but Garibaldi - now free from Psi-Corps influence - rescues him. A brief civil war breaks out on Earth, culminating in President Clark's suicide and Sheridan's surrender to Earth forces. Ivanova is critically injured in the war, and leaves the station to take command of her own vessel. The League of Non-Aligned Worlds are reorganized into an Interstellar Alliance with Earth, Minbar, Narn, and Centauri, acting as a United Nations across the galaxy, with the Rangers as their enforcers. Sheridan is made president of the Alliance, and he and Delenn marry. = Season 5: The Wheel of Fire (1998) = In 2262, Earthforce Captain Elizabeth Lochley is appointed to command Babylon 5, which is now also the headquarters of the Interstellar Alliance. A conflict arises between Psi-Corps and a group of rogue telepaths that are seeking their own homeworld after learning that the Vorlons created telepaths as weapons against the Shadows. When several telepaths martyr themselves, Lyta leads attacks against the Psi- Corps, becoming an enemy of the state. Meanwhile, Alliance trade and civilian ships are being attacked by an unknown force, and evidence is discovered that the Centauri may be involved. Mollari discovers that the Drakh, a Shadow- allied race, have forced the Centauri leadership to precipitate war with the Alliance, in part as revenge for Mollari's turn against the Shadows. Mollari is forced to co-operate when he becomes Emperor, and withdraws the Centauri from the Alliance. Vir becomes the Centauri ambassador on the station. Separate stories show the long-standing members of Babylon 5 making plans to leave the station: Sheridan and Delenn move to the Alliance's permanent headquarters on Minbar. Garibaldi, having relapsed in his alcoholism, is aided by Lise, and the two marry and return to Mars. Dr. Franklin takes a position on Earth as head of xenobiology. G'Kar discovers he has become a religious figure, and unable to stay on the station or return to Narn, exiles himself to travel the galaxy, taking Lyta with him since she is in a similar position. Twenty years after his return from Z'ha'dum, Sheridan feels his life fading. He has the Rangers gather his old friends on Minbar for a farewell party. The next day, Sheridan attempts to leave while Delenn is asleep, but she stops him to say a final goodbye. Alone, Sheridan revisits Babylon 5, now being decommissioned, before continuing to the location of the final Vorlon/Shadow encounter. Drawing his last breaths, he is met by Lorien, who invites Sheridan to travel beyond the galactic rim. Sheridan's ship is found adrift and empty some days later. = Spin-off film (2002) =  Babylon 5: The Lost Tales  Babylon 5: The Lost Tales is a direct-to-DVD production, the DVD contains two 35-minute episodes, each focusing on a particular character.

The largest subsidiary of Cincinnati-based Kroger, it is the oldest such chain west of the Mississippi River. Kroger also operates stores under the Food 4 Less and Foods Co. names in California. History Ralphs Grocery Company was founded in 1873 by George Albert Ralphs and his brother, Walter Benjamin Ralphs. The original store was located at Sixth and Spring Streets in Los Angeles, California. In the 20th century, Ralphs became a grocery pioneer, offering self-service markets with checkout stands in distributed locations. The company employed notable architects in designing its stores, and the former Ralphs Grocery Store building built in 1929 in Westwood Village has been photographed by Ansel Adams, declared a Historic Cultural Monument, and listed on the National Register of Historic Places. In the 1980s, it created a chain of hybrid supermarket/warehouse stores called The Giant, which failed, but the concept returned with the company's merger with the Food 4 Less discount chain. In 1968, Ralphs was acquired by Federated Department Stores, based in Cincinnati. Then in 1992, Federated, now known as Macy's, Inc., sold Ralphs to a group of owners, led by Edward J. DeBartolo Corporation, after filing for bankruptcy two years earlier in 1990. In 1994, Ralphs was acquired by the Yucaipa Companies for $1.5 billion. Yucaipa owned ABC Markets, Alpha Beta, , and Cala Foods. Soon, all ABC Markets, Alpha Betas, and Boys Markets were rebranded as Ralphs. At the same time, Food 4 Less was merged with Ralphs. In 1997, Yucaipa sold Ralphs to Portland, Oregon based Fred Meyer, owner of several chains in the west. Soon, Ralphs Marketplace stores started opening in suburban areas; these stores are based on the Fred Meyer model but without apparel. At the same time, they also acquired the 57-store Hughes Family Markets chain. In October 1998, the parent company, Fred Meyer, merged with Kroger of Cincinnati, Ohio. In 1999, Ralphs purchased about 30 Albertsons and Lucky stores, in northern California, as well as stores in the Central Coast region, and one store each in Bakersfield and Laguna Beach. The stores were divested as a result of the Albertsons and American Stores merger. Ralphs operated the stores until January 2006, when they announced that all but one Ralphs in northern California would close. In August 2006, the one remaining Ralphs in northern California was given a 60-day notice of closure. Also, in August 2006, Ralphs finalized plans to sell eleven (of thirteen remaining) Cala-Bell Stores to Harley DeLano, who previously ran the chain. Ralphs's Northern California expansion did not work out as planned. On July 20, 2007, Ralphs opened a new store on 9th and Hope Street in the South Park neighborhood of downtown Los Angeles. This was the first full-run supermarket downtown in 50 years. In 1950, Ralphs closed a store at 7th Street and Figueroa Street. Today, Ralphs competes with Albertsons (including Vons) and Stater Bros. Its slogan is \\"Fresh Food, Low Prices.\\" Ralphs is the current market share leader in Southern California. 2003‚Äì2004 strike Ralphs Grocery Company has contracts with the United Food and Commercial Workers, the largest grocery union in the United States. In late 2003 and early 2004, Ralphs locked out its workers who were members of the UFCW in sympathy with competitor Vons (owned by Safeway Inc.) in Southern California, after the UFCW had declared a strike against Vons. The issues in contract negotiations included healthcare benefits and wage structure, which the supermarkets contended were necessary to reduce costs and remain competitive in the face of the rise of discount chains like Walmart. In March 2004, the strike ended with a settlement regarded as a victory for the grocery chains‚Äînew hires would be on a much lower pay scale than existing workers and receive less generous health benefits. On October 16, 2006, Ralphs agreed to pay $70 million to settle felony charges that it illegally rehired locked out employees using false names and Social Security numbers during the strike. Eligible UFCW members received $50 million of the settlement and the remainder was paid in fines to the federal government. In popular culture Universal Hollywood has a Ralphs grocery store in the Beverly Hills area. The photorealist painter Robert Cottingham depicted a Ralphs supermarket in his 1968 painting \\"Ralph's II\\", which has been displayed by the Milwaukee Art Museum. The Coen Brothers' 1998 film The Big Lebowski opens with its main character, The Dude, played by Jeff Bridges, walking through a Ralphs supermarket. Later in the film, The Dude is searched by the Malibu Chief of Police, who, upon finding his Ralphs Card, asks \\"Is this your only form of ID?\\" In a mortuary, the character Walter Sobchak complains about the high price of an urn to house the ashes of a friend. After asking the funeral director, \\"Is there a Ralphs around here?\\", the scene cuts to Walter overlooking the Pacific Ocean holding a Folgers Coffee can. In the movie Messiah of Evil, one of the main characters, Laura, follows a mysterious figure into a deserted Ralphs supermarket, where she is chased, attacked, and eaten by zombies. A sign for a Ralphs store appears in the 1975 film Dolemite. In The Powerpuff Girls, there is a parody grocery store called \\"Malph's\\". A parody of Ralphs packaging was used as the cover for the 1986 album Album by Public Image Ltd. Ralphs supermarket line of generic brand products were featured prominently in the 1984 film Repo Man; almost all products featured were donated by the supermarket. Ralphs can be seen in the action film Die Hard when John McClane sees that the fire trucks take a route away from Nakatomi Plaza, which is where he and his wife are trapped. Ralphs was the primary sponsor for the #11 car of Brett Bodine in the 2000-2001 NASCAR Winston Cup Series seasons. A package of Ralphs green beans can be seen in a refrigerator in the closing moments of the Season 5 Episode 11 of The Practice. This was most likely an error from someone in the prop department since the show took place in Boston. In the podcast radio drama Welcome to Night Vale, the chain is occasionally mentioned in the context of a \\"hole in the vacant lot out back of the Ralphs.\\" This is in spite of a lack of confirmation or evidence that the town of Night Vale is located in Southern California. In an episode of Mad Men, Don Draper can be seen carrying a Ralphs bag while visiting a friend in southern California. In the 1992 film Forever Young with Mel Gibson, after Gibson's character wakes up in the present day to discover he has been frozen for the past 50 years, he goes to a pay telephone to call a friend from his past, across the street from the pay phone is a Ralphs store. Later when trying to tell someone where his friend from the past lived Gibson's character says \\"There's a place called Ralphs there now.\\" Notes References * Ralphs History * External links * Category:1873 establishments in California Category:Companies based in Los Angeles County, California Category:American companies established in 1873 Category:Retail companies established in 1873 Category:Kroger Category:Private equity portfolio companies Category:Supermarkets based in California Category:Supermarkets of the United States Category:1994 mergers and acquisitions Category:1997 mergers and acquisitions ","title":"Ralphs"},{"id":"401265","text":"Affine, pronounced /…ôÀàfa…™n/, relates to connections or affinities.

(This was ostensibly a self-released record but UZI Suicide was actually part of Geffen Records.)Marc Canter, Reckless Road, page 318. When referred to by band members, they have simply called the EP Live Like a Suicide. The record itself was reportedly limited to only 10,000 copies, released only in vinyl and cassette formats. Background The four songs on the EP were selected from the band's demo tapes: two are cover versions and two are originals. The EP was a faux-live recording with overdubbed crowd noise, but these are in fact studio performances. According to Steven Adler's autobiography, My Appetite for Destruction: Sex & Drugs & Guns N' Roses, the entire EP was recorded at Pasha Studios in Hollywood with pre-recorded audience applause and cheering in the background, as Geffen's engineers told him \\"it would cost too much to actually record a live record\\".Adler, Steven; My Appetite for Destruction, pages 107‚Äì108. . Duff McKagan says in his autobiography, It's So Easy (and other Lies), that \\"the crowd noise...is from a 1970's rock festival called the Texxas Jam. We thought it would be funny to put a huge stadium crowd in the background at a time when we were lucky to be playing to a few hundred.\\" \\"Reckless Life\\" is the opening track on the EP. It opens with Slash shouting \\"Hey fuckers! Suck on Guns N' fuckin' Roses!\\" This song was originally written by Hollywood Rose, which had included all the members of Guns N' Roses except Duff McKagan at one point or another. It was included in the Hollywood Rose compilation album The Roots of Guns N' Roses. \\"Nice Boys\\" is a cover of a song by Rose Tattoo. \\"Move to the City\\" features a horn section, and is the third track on the EP. \\"Mama Kin\\" is a cover of a song by Aerosmith, a band Guns N' Roses has cited as one of their major influences. One song considered for this EP was \\"Shadow of Your Love\\", which never made it onto the album, and later released on the EP Live from the Jungle. Re-releases In 1988, the recordings featured on Live ?!*@ Like a Suicide were re-released along with four new songs as the album G N' R Lies. The EP in its entirety was included as bonus tracks on the 2018 reissue of Appetite for Destruction and featured seamless crowd noise between the songs along with the fifth song \\"Shadow of Your Love\\". Artwork The front cover consists of a photograph of two of the band members, Duff McKagan and Axl Rose (from left to right), with an early Guns N' Roses logo, designed by Slash, overhead. The artwork from this EP is also featured in the G N' R Lies album artwork. Promotion To celebrate the release of the EP Guns N' Roses had a release party at Riki Rachtman's World Famous Cathouse. That was the first live performance at the club. It was acoustic and this was before MTV had the unplugged series, so an acoustic set from a heavy metal act was rather obscure in 1986. In 2010, Steven Adler claimed that Guns N' Roses got Rodney on the ROQ at KROQ-FM to initially play \\"Reckless Life\\" by giving Rodney one gram of cocaine.9/21/2010: Steven Adler on the Adam Carolla Show Track listing Personnel Adapted from AllMusic. *W.

They were written and recorded in only a few studio sessions (with the exception of \\"You're Crazy\\", which appeared in an alternative version on Appetite for Destruction), which producer Mike Clink called \\"one of those magical rock and roll history moments.\\" In later interviews, Axl Rose stated that while he loved how the band sounded on the last four songs, he hated the sound of his voice. Rose recalled that his voice was husky and scratchy from the band's lengthy touring at the time, and if he could he would have re-recorded his vocal tracks in a separate session. A significantly faster version of \\"You're Crazy\\" with electric guitars had previously been released on the band's debut album, Appetite for Destruction, and was now recorded as originally intended. \\"Used to Love Her\\" was written as a joke after Izzy Stradlin disliked a song he heard on the radio featuring \\"some guy whining about a broad who was treating him bad\\".

Artwork The reworked cover art for the album with edited texts. The cover is a humorous parody of tabloid newspapers, as are the liner notes. The album's cover art underwent several minor modifications when the title was released on CD. First, in the bottom left corner reading \\"LIES LIES LIES\\" originally read \\"Wife-beating has been around for 10,000 years.\\" Secondly, instead of \\"Elephant gives birth to midget\\", the original headline reads, \\"Ladies, welcome to the dark ages.\\" Many copies of the original LP release also contained an uncensored picture of a nude model on the inner LP sleeve.Guns N' Roses, G N' R Lies.

The Peel off Stickers are on a 21mm x 30mm sheet. The cover art bears a resemblance to John Lennon's Some Time in New York City, an album that contains Lennon's controversial \\"Woman Is the Nigger of the World\\", a song Axl Rose cited when he defended his use of the word \\"nigger\\" in \\"One in a Million\\". Controversy In addition to the album cover, two songs from the album caused significant controversy. The song \\"One in a Million\\" raised accusations of racism and homophobia. Rose denied that he was a racist and defended his use of the word \\"nigger\\", claiming that \\"it's a word to describe somebody that is basically a pain in your life, a problem. The word nigger doesn't necessarily mean black.\\" He cited the rap group N.W.A. and the John Lennon song \\"Woman Is the Nigger of the World\\" as other examples of musicians using the word. Several years later, Rose conceded that he had used the word as an insult towards black people who had tried to rob him, and because the word is a taboo.[ In response to the allegations of homophobia, Rose stated that he considered himself \\"pro-heterosexual\\" and blamed this attitude on \\"bad experiences\\" with gay men. The song \\"Used to Love Her\\" was perceived as misogynistic by critics. Reception Rolling Stone, in a 4 out of 5 star review, stated \\"Given that Guns N‚Äô Roses could probably release an album of Baptist hymns at this point and go platinum, it would be all too easy to dismiss G n‚Äô R Lies as a sneaky attempt by the band to throw together some outtakes and cash in on the busy holiday buying season... The good news is that Lies is a lot more interesting than that... The calm folk-rock melodies of these four acoustic songs reveal yet another welcome facet of Guns n‚Äô Roses. They should also end any further mutterings from the doubting Thomases out there who are still making snide comments about the band‚Äôs potential for longevity.\\" Allmusic, in a 3.5 out of 5 review, criticizied some of the songs on the acoustic side, stating \\"Constructed as a double EP, with the \\"indie\\" debut Live ?!*@ Like a Suicide coming first and four new acoustic-based songs following on the second side, G N' R Lies is where the band metamorphosed from genuine threat to joke. Neither recorded live nor released by an indie label, Live ?!*@ Like a Suicide is competent bar band boogie, without the energy or danger of Appetite for Destruction. The new songs are considerably more problematic. \\"Patience\\" is Guns N' Roses at their prettiest and their sappiest, the most direct song they recorded to date. Its emotional directness makes the misogyny of \\"Used to Love Her (But I Had to Kill Her)\\" and the pitiful slanders of \\"One in a Million\\" sound genuine. In a negative review for The Village Voice, Robert Christgau stated \\"Axl's voice is a power tool with attachments, Slash's guitar a hype, the groove potent \\"hard rock\\", and the songwriting not without its virtues. So figure musical quality at around C plus and take the grade as a call to boycott, a reminder to clean livers who yearn for the wild side that the necessary link between sex-and-drugs and rock-and-roll is a Hollywood fantasy\\" while condemning \\"One In a Million\\" and \\"Used To Love Her\\". In a 2014 review Metal Hammer dissected the controversy around the album, stating \\"Conceived as a stop-gap release, the second Guns N‚Äô Roses album remains a remarkable one-off ‚Äì in every sense. Ultimate Classic Rock stated \\"Ironically, G N‚Äô R Lies' tabloid-style cover art also hinted at the incessant scandals and resulting paranoia that would soon engulf the band, and its singer in particular, sowing the seeds to their eventual dissolution after the twin Use Your Illusion behemoths, and protracted creative silence until 2008‚Äôs historically delayed Chinese Democracy opus.\\" Track listing Songwriting credits via ASCAP.

() was a Soviet steamship reinforced to navigate through polar ice that became ice-bound in Arctic waters during navigation along the Northern Maritime Route from Murmansk to Vladivostok. The expedition's task was to determine the possibility to travel by non-icebreaker through the Northern Maritime Route in a single navigation season. It was built in Denmark in 1933 by Burmeister and Wain (B&W;, Copenhagen) and named after the 18th century Russian polar explorer Semion Ivanovich Chelyuskin. The head of the expedition was Otto Yuliyevich Shmidt and the ship's captain was V. I. Voronin. There were 111 people on board the steamship. The crew members were known as Chelyuskintsy, with the singular form \\"Chelyuskinets\\". Mission After leaving Murmansk on 2 August 1933, the steamship managed to get through most of the Northern Route before it was caught in the ice fields in September. After that it drifted in the ice pack before sinking on 13 February 1934, crushed by the icepacks near Kolyuchin Island in the Chukchi Sea. The crew managed to escape onto the ice and built a makeshift airstrip using only a few spades, ice shovels and two crowbars. They had to rebuild the airstrip thirteen times, until they were rescued in April of the same year and flown to the village of Vankarem on the coast of the sea. From there, some of the Chelyuskinites were flown further to the village of Uelen, while fifty- three men walked over 300 miles to get there. The aircraft pilots who took part in search and rescue operations were the first people to receive the newly established highest title of Hero of the Soviet Union. Those pilots were Anatoly Liapidevsky, Sigizmund Levanevsky (who crashed en route to the camp, but survived), Vasily Molokov, Mavriky Slepnyov, Mikhail Vodopianov, Nikolai Kamanin and Ivan Doronin. Liapidevsky flew an ANT-4, the civilian version of the TB-1 heavy bomber, while Slepnev and Levanevsky flew a Consolidated Fleetster specially brought in from the US for the mission, and the other pilots flew the Polikarpov R-5. Two American air mechanics, Clyde Goodwin Armitstead, and William Latimer Lavery,The Junior Aircraft Year Book, 1935, p.8 also helped in the search and rescue of the Chelyuskintsy, on 10 September 1934, and were awarded the Order of Lenin. As the steamship became trapped at the entrance to the Bering Strait, the USSR considered the expedition mainly successful, as it had proven that a regular steamship had a chance to navigate the whole Northern Maritime Route in a single season. After a few additional trial runs in 1933 and 1934, the Northern Sea Route was officially opened and commercial exploitation began in 1935. Next year, part of the Soviet Baltic Fleet made the passage to the Pacific where an armed conflict with Japan was looming. There were 10 ladies and two small kids on board. One of the kids was only 6 months old. Throughout the voyage one passenger got sick and died. { - valign=\\"top\\" Sinking of the Chelyuskin. Location of Kolyuchin Island.

Marina Tsvetayeva wrote a poem applauding the rescue team. In 1970, East German television produced Tscheljuskin, a film about the ship's voyage, directed by Rainer Hausdorf and featuring Eberhard Mellies as Prof. Schmidt, Dieter Mann as the surveyor Vasiliev and Fritz Diez as Valerian Kuybyshev.Tscheljuskin on the IMDb.

Cornerbacks cover receivers most of the time, but also blitz and defend against such offensive running plays as sweeps and reverses. They create turnovers through hard tackles, interceptions, and deflecting forward passes. Other members of the defensive backfield include strong and free safeties. The cornerback position requires speed, agility, strength, and the ability to make rapid sharp turns. A cornerback's skill set typically requires proficiency in anticipating the quarterback, backpedaling, executing single and zone coverage, disrupting pass routes, block shedding, and tackling. Cornerbacks are among the fastest players on the field. Because of this, they are frequently used as a return specialist on punts or kickoffs.  Overview  The cornerback‚Äôs chief responsibility is to defend against the offense's pass. The rules of American professional football and American college football do not mandate starting position, movement, or coverage zones for any member of the defense. There are no \\"illegal defense\\" formations. Cornerbacks can be anywhere on the defensive side of the line of scrimmage at the start of play, although their proximity, formations, and strategies are outlined by the coaching staff or captain. Trinity College rises to intercept a pass Most modern National Football League defensive formations use four defensive backs (two safeties and two corners); Canadian Football League defenses generally use five defensive backs (one safety, two defensive halfbacks, and two corners). A cornerback's responsibilities vary depending on how the defense assigns protection to its defensive secondary. In terms of defending the run, often corners may be assigned to blitz depending on the coaching decisions in a game. In terms of defending passing plays, a corner will be typically assigned to either zone or man-to-man coverage. The most effective cornerbacks are typically called \\"lockdown corners\\". These elite defenders cover an offensive receiver so effectively on either side of the field that the quarterback does not target the receiver being covered. =Zone= In zone coverage, the cornerback defends an assigned area of the field. Many schemes and variations were created to provide defensive coordinators great latitude and flexibility which aim to thwart offensive schemes. When a team is using zone coverage, some areas of the field require special attention when defending against specific pass plays. They include the flats (to defend the screen pass and hitch routes), mid range zones including the void (to defend the \\"stop n go\\", quick post, fade, hook, curl, and \\"sideline\\" or \\"out\\" routes), and finally the deep zones (to defend the post/deep post, chair, streak, \\"fly\\", \\"go\\", bomb, or Hail Mary routes). These are basic terms (perhaps the most generic) for the basic zones and routes which vary system to system, league to league, and team to team. Advanced forms of coverage may involve \\"quarterback spies\\" and \\"containment\\" coverages, as well as various \\"on field adjustments\\" that require shifts and rotations; the latter usually initiated by the captain of the secondary (typically the free safety) during the quarterback's cadence. At this time the captain attempts to \\"read\\" the alignment (pro set, split set, trips, etc.) of the offensive \\"skill players\\" (backs and receivers) in order to best predict and counter the play the offense will run. He will base his decision on past experience, game preparation, and a sound comprehension of his teammates strengths, abilities, and tendencies. These adjustments may change on a play by play basis, due to substitutions or even evolving weather or field conditions. For example, defensive coordinators may favor a tendency to play a less aggressive containment style zone coverage during wet or slippery field conditions to avoid problems associated with over-pursuit (when a defender takes a poor angle on a ball carrier and cannot redirect in time due to poor footing). =Cover 1= The Cover 1 defense is an aggressive formation employed against offenses trying to gain short yardage. In the Cover 1 defense, one defender‚Äînormally a safety‚Äîplays deep zone downfield, providing security over the top and freeing the other safety to rush the line of scrimmage or drop back into coverage. Meanwhile, the corner's primary responsibility is to play on or off the receiver and not release him vertically. Defensive coordinators typically call for Cover 1 formations only when their cornerbacks are skilled at playing man-to-man coverage. =Cover 2= The Cover 2 formation, which deploys four defensive backs in a \\"two-deep zone,\\" is popular among NFL defensive coordinators because it uses two safeties to defend the deep routes instead of one. The safeties line up on or near their respective hashmarks between 11 and 15 yards off the line of scrimmage, while the cornerbacks line up around five yards from the wide receivers nearest to each sideline. With the safeties able to watch the play develop in front of them, the corners are free to pursue a more aggressive style of play. In Cover 2, the cornerback is usually responsible for \\"containment,\\" meaning that he is tasked with preventing any eligible receiver or ball carrier from running between him and the sideline. He funnels receivers toward the middle of the field and may physically \\"jam\\" them within five yards of the line of scrimmage in order to disrupt their assigned routes. If he determines that the offense is not attempting a running play or a pass into the flat, he then drops back to defend the secondary. This is often referred to as the \\"catch-and-run\\" technique. Typically, cornerbacks mirror each other's zone responsibilities. However, sometimes they play a \\"man-up\\" style of bump-and-run coverage designed to eliminate the short pass, where the receiver is forced to the near sideline, which is the opposite of the run- oriented \\"containment\\" style of Cover 2. =Cover 3= In a \\"Cover 3\\", the two corners and free safety defend their assigned deep thirds of the field, where the corners defend the outside thirds, (hence the term corner) while the safety defends the middle third. This allows the strong safety to address a full range of duties depending on what reads he makes coupled with the coverage called. These duties may simply include single or zone coverage, being a quarterback spy, providing extra run support in short yardage situations, or to stunt or blitz through a gap or from the end. =Cover 4= In a \\"Cover 4\\" each defensive back is responsible for covering his designated \\"deep fourth\\" of the field, while other defensive players are responsible for covering the underneath areas. Sometimes Cover 4 is used as a \\"prevent defense\\". Variations of these coverages exist to counter the many styles of offenses a defense may face on any given week. For example, one variation of the Cover 2 allocates the weak-side corner (e.g.: typically the \\"right cornerback\\" when playing against right-handed quarterbacks) to cover half the field in order to free up a safety; the idea being to allow the safety to engage a different part of the field, blitz, contain, or spy. The strong side cornerback (the \\"left cornerback\\") may be in a variety of different alignments which may include \\"loose man\\", \\"man-under\\", or \\"man-up\\". Although these are forms of single coverage, more often than not his responsibility is usually limited to an initial jam and funnel with a subsequent drop back into the \\"void\\". This pie-shaped slice of field is included with your most basic 2 Deep Zone coverage. One interesting aspect sometimes encountered with Cover 2 is that it is possible for one corner to be in a zone coverage, where he funnels and drops into the void, while another may be in man coverage. However, your basic garden variety 2 Deep Zone usually employs the two safeties to share half the field responsibilities, with the two corners funneling. Jamming the receiver Green Bay Packers cornerback Charles Woodson (21) covering San Francisco 49ers wide receiver Randy Moss (84). When a cornerback is attempting to jam or funnel a receiver, he is trying to disrupt the receiver's route at the line of scrimmage. Many routes are precisely coordinated between the quarterback and the receiver, to the point that a quarterback may throw the ball without looking, knowing his receiver will be in an exact spot after a certain time. Jamming will disrupt the timing between the two, which provides the defense with extra time to sack the quarterback (sometimes called a \\"coverage sack\\"), or force an ill-timed throw that misses the target. In addition, a proper jam allows the safety or linebacker to provide stronger run support because he then has more time to drop back into zone coverage in the event of a pass. In other words, he has been granted more time by the corner to recover from his mistakes if he anticipates a run when in fact the play is a pass. Proper jamming technique requires the cornerback to use their legs, shoulder width apart. At the same time, the cornerback thrusts their arms forward into the receiver's chest to maximize power. When properly executed, a jam can knock a receiver off his feet. Jamming is only legal within five yards from the line of scrimmage. If the jam fails, the cornerback is usually flat footed and not in a suitable position to defend the mid to long-range passes. When this occurs, the safeties and linebackers usually cannot return to their zone obligations in time, especially if they were anticipating a run as the play began. In essence, the defense is unnecessarily \\"stretched\\" to its breaking point. Receivers who can effectively avoid the jam and stretch defenses are far more likely to create big play opportunities for the offense. Therefore, it is vital that a cornerback execute a proper funnel or jam to allow safeties and linebackers enough time to return to their zone responsibilities in the event of an unforeseen pass play. By working together and familiarizing where one's help may come from, a higher degree of confidence is established among the defensive secondary as a unit, with the end result translating into a much more formidable defense against both the run and pass. Single/man-to-man coverage In single or man to man coverage, the cornerback is responsible for a particular receiver assigned to him. As the play begins, the corner may either attempt to \\"jam\\" the receiver at the line, play a step or two off of him, or concede a few yards and play with a \\"cushion\\". Cushions can range from a yard or two, to forty yards in a \\"prevent defense\\" situation. Cushion is just how far off the defender plays away from the offensive player he is assigned to defend. When lining up in front of the receiver to \\"jam\\" him or playing just a few steps off, it is important that the corner keeps his body in front of the receiver's body. The easiest way for a corner to be in position is to line up slightly inside of the receiver and the ball, and keep his eyes looking between the receiver's hip and his knees. If a cornerback loses focus on his receiver, the receiver will run straight past him, and then it leads to corners having to use the cushion technique. Generally, cushions are smaller in single coverage and larger in zone coverage. Single coverage in the \\"red zone\\" ‚Äì the area between the twenty-yard line and the goal line ‚Äì is usually designed to prevent receivers from slanting towards the middle of the field. These types of routes are difficult to stop in the red zone because this area is usually congested with bodies colliding, crossing, and weaving in different directions. Although illegal, defenders are easily picked or screened by opposing receivers and sometimes by their own teammates; this is illegal yet difficult to enforce in short field, congested situations. To avoid this, it is often favorable for cornerbacks to either: \\"switch\\" assignments, where he will agree beforehand to trade assignments with one of his fellow defenders in the event that the receivers criss-cross as the play begins, or alternatively, a corner may instead line up very close to the receiver at the line of scrimmage to force or \\"jam\\" him toward the sideline (outside) without violating the 5-yard no-touch rule. Corners often refer to this second style of coverage as the \\"man under\\" technique. Single coverage, or man to man coverage usually employs relatively few techniques. However, they are often initially displayed to resemble one another as much as possible to disguise the true motives of the defense, and be interchangeable as well. Although terminology for single coverage can vary, a few generic terms have been included to establish a general understanding of cornerback philosophy and how his function relates to the rest of the defense. =Loose man= Loose man requires cornerbacks to play off the receiver with a five to ten yard cushion. He usually does not touch the receiver and tries to keep his head on a swivel in order to move in whatever direction the receiver decides to shape his route. Typically with loose man coverage, the cornerback has little or no help from the safety in defending against the receiver. This defense is used to discourage deeper passes, but often allows short yardage passes. A loose-man defense looks to create confusion for the quarterback by using blitzes. The idea is to disrupt the coordination necessary for short routes, which leads to drops or poorly thrown passes stalling the drive. However, accurate quarterbacks with a quick release of the football can exploit this and routinely make 3 to 5 yard completions to receivers. =Man up= By far the most challenging, the man up technique grants the wide receiver a relatively free release as the corner shadows him stride for stride everywhere he goes. The cornerback's objective here is to position himself between the quarterback and the receiver, without knowing where the receiver is going. As the ball is snapped the corner will initially ignore the quarterback, turn and run with the receiver and hope the ball does not drop out of the sky before he can react to it. Corners must also hope the receiver does not change directions when it is time to sneak a peek at the quarterback in effort to discover where the ball is. A wet field makes this coverage extremely difficult. In addition, a perfect throw is hard, if not impossible, to stop. This coverage is usually reserved for the elite cornerback with superb coverage skills.

Written by David Gerrold and directed by Joseph Pevney, it was first broadcast on December 29, 1967. In this comic episode, the starship Enterprise visits a space station that soon becomes overwhelmed by rapidly-reproducing small furry creatures called \\"tribbles\\". It is claimed the short story \\"Pigs Is Pigs\\" by Ellis Parker Butler inspired the episode,Star Trek: the Original Series, Blu-ray edition, Season 2, Disc 4: \\"The Trouble with Tribbles\\", CBS Home Video: Catalog No. 07176 but strong similarities to sections of the novel The Rolling Stones led the producers to seek a waiver from author Robert A. Heinlein. The original episode has had several produced follow-ups. The first, \\"More Tribbles, More Troubles\\", was originally pitched for the show's third season but not accepted; it was ultimately produced for Star Trek: The Animated Series. To celebrate the 30th anniversary of Star Trek in 1996, the Star Trek: Deep Space Nine episode \\"Trials and Tribble-ations\\" used digital techniques to insert the Deep Space Nine actors into the events of \\"The Trouble with Tribbles\\". Plot The Enterprise is summoned to Deep Space Station K7 by undersecretary Nilz Baris (William Schallert) to guard a crucial shipment of quadrotriticale grain. The Enterprise crew enjoy shore leave on the station, as does the crew of a Klingon ship arriving at the same time, under the command of Captain Koloth (William Campbell). Interstellar trader Cyrano Jones (Stanley Adams) arrives with goods for sale, among them purring balls of fluff called tribbles. He gives one to Lt. Uhura (Nichelle Nichols), who brings it on board the Enterprise. On both the Enterprise and the station the tribbles begin reproducing rapidly. They make soothing cooing noises and are loved by the Enterprise crew, even the stoic Spock (Leonard Nimoy). However, tribbles jump and screech in disgust when around Klingons. On the station, a Klingon insults the Enterprise, her crew, and her captain James Kirk (William Shatner), provoking a brawl between human and Klingons. Baris is terrified of possible Klingon interference with the grain project, and suspects Jones of being a Klingon agent. Doctor Leonard McCoy (DeForest Kelley) and Spock are concerned that the increasing number of tribbles threaten to consume all the food aboard the Enterprise. Kirk realizes that the tribbles on the station could be a threat to the grain shipment. He is too late, however; when he opens an overhead storage compartment, he is buried chest-deep in grain-gorged tribbles. Spock and McCoy discover that many of the tribbles in the hold are dead or dying, suggesting the grain has been poisoned. Infuriated, Baris vows to see Kirk punished for the fiasco, while an equally outraged Koloth demands an apology from Kirk for what he considers disrespectful treatment of his crew. Their arguments are cut short, however, when Baris's assistant Arne Darvin (Charlie Brill) walks into the room and the tribbles react as if in the presence of a Klingon. McCoy reveals Darvin to be a Klingon disguised as a human; Darvin confesses to having poisoned the grain. Cyrano Jones is ordered to remove the tribbles from the station (a task that Spock estimates will take 17.9 years), or he may face charges for transporting dangerous life forms. Just before the Klingons depart, all the tribbles aboard the Enterprise are transported onto the Klingon vessel by Chief Engineer Scott (James Doohan), where, in his words, \\"they'll be no tribble at all.\\" Production =Writing= \\"The Trouble with Tribbles\\" was the first sale of writer David Gerrold (photographed in 2010). The episode was the first professional work of writer David Gerrold, and went through a variety of drafts before it reached the screen. Because his typewriter used a less common, smaller size font, an approved screenplay version needed to be reduced by twenty pages before filming. Gerrold had been a fan of science fiction since he was a child.Gerrold (1973): p. 28 When Star Trek was first broadcast, he was concerned that it might turn into something similar to Lost in Space, which he has described as \\"one full-color hour of trash reaching into millions of homes\\".Gerrold (1973): p. 39 His first story outline was sent into Star Trek after his agent suggested that he waited until the shows started to air under the theory that the show might drop an existing episode in favor of a better script.Gerrold (1973): p. 42 The story was entitled \\"Tomorrow Was Yesterday\\" (not to be confused with the Star Trek episode \\"Tomorrow Is Yesterday\\") and concerned the Enterprise coming across a generation ship which had descended into a two-tier class system. His agent received a rejection letter from producer Gene L. Coon dated October 3, 1966. The letter stated that the \\"outline was by no means inadequate. It is, as a matter of fact, very adequate.\\"Gerrold (1973): p. 45 It went on to say that it would require a budget larger than that available to television, but would have made a good film treatment. Coon offered to meet with Gerrold and explain what they were looking for, because they were not purchasing scripts at that time. Coon suggested that Gerrold should wait until the following February to see if the show was renewed for a second season. They also discussed several story ideas, including some small furry creatures that bred too quickly. Coon thought it was a cute idea but would be too expensive as they'd have to build each creature.Gerrold (1973): p. 48 In preparation for the second series submission, by January, Gerrold had put together five premises to pitch.Gerrold (1973): p. 49 He had his best hopes on two treatments called \\"Bandi\\" and \\"The Protracted Man\\",Gerrold (1973): p. 72 but decided to submit his fifth story despite Coon's earlier dismissal of the idea. It was called \\"The Fuzzies\\".Gerrold (1973): p. 73 The idea was based on the introduction of rabbits in Australia in 1859, who reproduced at a vastly increased rate owing to the lack of predators.Block; Erdmann (2010): p. 208 The initial premise placed the story on a space station to avoid the ecological damage that the creatures would have on a planet. However, Gerrold's agent was concerned that requiring a miniature of the station to be built as well as the additional sets would cause it to be too expensive for a single episode.Gerrold (1973): p. 74 Because of his agent's comments, Gerrold modified the pitch to place the action on a colony planet instead.Gerrold (1973): p. 75 This pitch included the plot points such as the creatures getting into a poisoned grain storage, but omitted the Klingons; and Cyrano Jones was called Cyrano Smith.Gerrold (1973): p. 85Gerrold (1973): p. 78 The five pitches were submitted by Gerrold's agent in February 1967, and received a response in June. At the time the show had already purchased too many scripts for the second season, but story editor D. C. Fontana suggested that they should purchase the story and assign it to a staff writer as it was better than some of the other stories they already had.Gerrold (1973): p. 88 At the time that Coon got in touch, Gerrold had just been employed at CBS as a typist working on scripts such as the pilot of Hawaii Five-O. As soon as he got the response, he quit the job.Gerrold (1973): p. 89 Gerrold and Coon met once more,Gerrold (1973): p. 91 and revealed that the network had recently made a request for more episodes based on other planets. Coon told Gerrold to work up a further pitch. This version of the story added the Klingons,Gerrold (1973): p. 100 and moved the action from planetside to a space station.Gerrold (1973): p. 96 During a visit to the set, Gerrold had the opportunity to speak to Leonard Nimoy and ask his advice on how to write for Spock and was allowed to watch the dailies from each day's shoot of the episode \\"The Doomsday Machine\\" which was being filmed at the time.Gerrold (1973): p. 144Gerrold (1973): p. 145 This version of the story was entitled \\"A Fuzzy Thing Happened to Me...\\", which was purchased by Coon as a plot outline.Gerrold (1973): p. 150 He offered Gerrold a chance to write the script himself, by promising not to hand it to another writer for a month. However, Coon made it clear that he was not offering Gerrold a script assignment, but was giving him the option of submitting a draft.Gerrold (1973): p. 151 Gerrold turned around the first draft script in two and a half days.Gerrold (1973): p. 152 Both Coon and associate producer Robert Justman gave feedback on the script, and pointed out a few gaps such as there needing to be some way in the plot for the crew to discover that Darvin was a Klingon agent.Gerrold (1973): p. 153 The following draft had Cyrano Jones discover that Darvin was an agent, which Coon thought was not \\"punchy\\" enough.Gerrold (1973): p. 159 It was then re-written so that the fuzzies were allergic to Klingons. Both Gerrold and Coon thought the idea was \\"trite... shtick... hokey\\" and \\"had been done before\\". but Coon agreed that it was the direction the story should go. The re-write of the script took a further week.Gerrold (1973): p. 166 Nichelle Nichols said that she had never seen a script changed so much but stay the same. On a further visit to the set, Gerrold was called into Coon's office. He was informed that he needed to change the name of the fuzzies, as the legal department was concerned about similarities in the name with H. Beam Piper's 1962 novel Little Fuzzy.Gerrold (1973): p. 167 He subsequently came up with a variety of alternative names. Through a process of elimination, he ended up with the name \\"tribble\\". Gerrold's submitted script was within the standard page count for an episode, but, when it was retyped for distribution by the production's mimeo department, it ballooned from 60 to 80 pages due to Gerrold's having used a typewriter with 12-pitch rather than the 10 characters per inch Pica standard of the TV and film industry.Gerrold (1973): p. 179 This meant that some twenty pages needed to be cut from the script. Scenes which were cut from the script included the Enterprise chasing after Jones in his vessel,Gerrold (1973): p. 183 and resulted in the scene where Kirk has tribbles tumbling onto him while in the grain locker. Gerrold felt that this enforced editing process \\"tightened up the story and made for a better series of gags\\". Nichelle Nichols said to Gerrold \\"I've never seen a script go through so many changes ‚Äì and stay so much the same\\".Gerrold (1973): p. 184 Coon's participation in terms of suggestions and edits was such that Gerrold thought he should have been given a co-writing credit.Gerrold (1973): p. 176 The producers liked the resulting script so much that Gerrold was later tasked with re-writing the script for \\"I, Mudd\\".Gerrold (1973): p. 269 During script development the Kellam de Forest Research firm cautioned that the tribbles and the events around them strongly resembled the Martian flat cats in Robert A. Heinlein's 1952 novel The Rolling Stones, and suggested that the rights to the novel should be purchased. Gerrold became concerned that he had inadvertently plagiarized the novel which he had read fifteen years before.Gerrold (1973): p. 271 Coon phoned Heinlein, who, according to Gerrold, only asked for a signed copy of the script and later sent a note to Gerrold after the show aired to thank him for the script.Gerrold (1973): p. 274 Heinlein‚Äôs own recollections were at odds with this account. In his authorized biography Heinlein said he was called by Gene Coon who gave him a \\"sob story\\" about the issue and asked him to waive claim to the \\"similarity\\" to his flat cats. Heinlein states he agreed because he‚Äôd just been through one costly plagiarism lawsuit against Roger Corman and did not wish to embroil himself in another \\"chump's game.\\" He had misgivings upon seeing the actual script but let it go, an action he later regretted: \\"If that matter had simply been dropped after that one episode was filmed, I would have chalked it up wryly to experience. But the 'nice kid' did not drop it; 'tribbles' (i.e. my 'flat cats') have been exploited endlessly‚Ä¶ Well that‚Äôs one that did 'larn me.' Today if J. Christ phoned me on some matter of business, I would simply tell him: 'See my agent.'\\" The fictional quadrotriticale's real-world antecedent, the grain triticale, was a fairly new invention at the time of the episode. =Filming= During the course of filming, William Shatner was covered with five hundred tribbles on eight occasions. The use of live animals to represent the tribbles was immediately ruled out. According to Gerrold's account, the inspiration for the form of the tribble instead came from a fluffy keyring owned by Holly Sherman. Sherman's Planet in this episode was subsequently named after her.Gerrold (1973): p. 272 The design came from Wah Chang,Gerrold (1973): p. 264 but they were individually sewn by Jacqueline Cumer√©. She was paid $350 to sew five hundred tribbles from synthetic fur and stuff them with foam rubber. Six ambulatory tribbles were made using the mechanisms of walking toy dogs, which were quite noisy and required the dialogue to be looped in during editing.Gerrold (1973): p. 266 Other tribbles were created by Jim Rugg out of beanbags for when it was required for one to sit on a person or object, and the breathing tribbles were hollow with surgical balloons inserted. Some of these tribbles were later displayed at the Smithsonian National Air and Space Museum in Washington D.C. in 1992. The sale at Christie's auction house in 2006 included tribbles from this episode as part of a larger Star Trek sale. Because of the synthetic fur technology of the 1960s, relatively few original tribbles exist as of 2010 because the fur fell out over time and they went bald.Block; Erdmann (2010): p. 210 An original tribble was sold at auction in 2003 for $1,000. Filming began during the second week of August 1967.Gerrold (1973): p. 275 Three temporary sets and a portion of corridor were constructed for specific use in this episode, which included the large trading post set.Gerrold (1973): p. 276 The chairs in that set were a problem, as the set designers wanted 24 matching chairs and decided that folding ones would not do. John M. Dwyer sourced them from a local company, but the numbers required meant that they had to be pulled out of showrooms from all over the county. When it came to the fight scene in the episode, Dwyer warned director Joseph Pevney not to damage the chairs.Gerrold (1973): p. 277 That scene was filmed twice after a cameraman with a handheld camera wandered onto the set. The scene where Kirk is covered with tribbles in the grain container needed to be filmed eight times, using all five hundred sewn tribbles.Gerrold (1973): p. 268 Gerrold had expected that scene to be cut at some point during production, as he thought that William Shatner would not agree to it. He said that Shatner was the \\"consummate professional and I believe he was eager to show off his comic abilities\\". Pevney was pleased with the outcome of the shoot, calling the episode \\"a delightful show from beginning to end\\". In addition to directing, Pevney also sourced some of the parts to create the tribbles and was directly responsible for the casting of Stanley Adams. He had pushed for the episode to be made as he recalled that there was some resistance at the time against making a comedy-style episode. These types of episodes were unusual for the series, as only \\"The Trouble with Tribbles\\" and \\"A Piece of the Action\\" were considered to be comedic episodes from season two. Pevney was one of the two most prolific Original Series directors alongside Marc Daniels, and directed fourteen episodes of the show. The cast responded favorably to the script. Nichelle Nichols was particularly pleased as it allowed Uhura to be a woman and took her off the bridge. It was one of her largest roles in any single episode in the series.Palumbo (1986): p. 213 =Casting= William Campbell had previously appeared in the first season episode \\"The Squire of Gothos\\" as Trelane. In \\"The Trouble with Tribbles\\", he portrayed the Klingon Captain Koloth. At various points Star Trek creator Gene Roddenberry claimed it was his intention to bring back Koloth during the third season of The Original Series, as Kirk's recurring Klingon adversary. Some internal production documents contradict this story. Although Koloth returned in Star Trek: The Animated Series, Campbell did not voice the role. He returned to the role in 1994 for an episode of Star Trek: Deep Space Nine, entitled \\"Blood Oath\\". At the time of casting, William Schallert had just finished filming the ABC sitcom The Patty Duke Show. He described himself not as a fan, and had not read any science fiction since 1948. He thought that the role of Nilz Baris was just another guest spot, and the role of a \\"rather stuffy bureaucrat... [was] not the most appealing character\\". He did not remember the character's name, only recalling it when he first attended a Star Trek convention at a hotel near Los Angeles Airport, as the fans called it out when he entered the lobby. He was later cast in the role of the Bajoran musician Varani in the DS9 episode \\"Sanctuary\\". Whit Bissell, who played the station manager, Lurry, was better known at the time in the main cast role of Lt. Gen. Heywood Kirk in the ABC science fiction television series The Time Tunnel. Michael Pataki, who portrayed the Klingon Korax, went on to play Karnas in Star Trek: The Next Generation first season episode \\"Too Short a Season\\".Nemecek (2003): p. 43 Charlie Brill portrayed the Klingon agent Arne Darvin. Brill had previously been a sketch comedy artist with his wife Mitzi McCall, and had appeared on The Ed Sullivan Show when The Beatles made their first appearance. Reception While initial fan reaction to the episode was mixed, it was more popular with the general public. Critical response to the episode was positive, and it was nominated for the Hugo Award for Best Dramatic Presentation which instead went to fellow Star Trek episode \\"The City on the Edge of Forever\\". It has since been included in several \\"best of\\" episode lists and features, including as part of the Best of DVD collection alongside three other episodes. It has also been released as part of the season two DVD box set. =Broadcast= \\"The Trouble with Tribbles\\" was first broadcast in the United States on December 29, 1967 on NBC.Gerrold (1973): p. 280 The initial fan reaction was undecided, but the episode connected better with the mass market. This effect was later explained in 2012 when Jordon Hoffman on StarTrek.com described \\"The Trouble with Tribbles\\" as \\"quite possibly, the first episode of Star Trek you ever saw\\". It entered popular culture and remained well-known to the public outside of the Star Trek community. =Retrospective critiques= The New York Times described the scene with Kirk and the tribbles in the grain container as one of the \\"best-remembered moments\\" of the series. Time magazine ranked \\"The Trouble with Tribbles\\" as the sixth best moment in Star Trek. IGN ranked it as the fifth best episode of The Original Series, while TechRepublic ranked it as the fourth best. The A.V. Club included \\"The Trouble with Tribbles\\" in a list of ten must-see episodes, and USA Today' listed as one of the three best. In 1998, \\"The Trouble with Tribbles\\" was listed as the eighth best cult moment of all time by The Times newspaper. In a list of the top 100 episodes of the Star Trek franchise, \\"The Trouble with Tribbles\\" was placed sixth by Charlie Jane Anders at io9. Zack Handlen's July 2009 review for The A.V. Club gave the episode a grade of A. Cyrano Jones was Handlen's least favorite part of the episode, and with the exception of that character, it was one of the better scripts seen in The Original Series. He thought that despite the lack of a sense of real danger, the plot all comes together neatly and praised the story's effects on Kirk, saying \\"The way the episode unfolds means Kirk's constantly dealing with things he does not really want to deal with, and there's a surprising amount of enjoyment to be had in seeing him complain about it to Spock.\\" Michele Erica Green, writing for TrekNation in March 2006, said she thought that the episode would have been dated, but found it was \\"as funny as ever.\\" She thought that Scotty's lines were \\"unforgettable\\" and the scenes between McCoy and Spock were \\"priceless\\". Eugene Myers and Torie Atkinson reviewed the episode for Tor.com in April 2010. They described it as \\"easily the most celebrated episode of the entire Original Series (if not the whole franchise)\\". They went on to describe it as a \\"perfect episode\\", and both gave it maximum scores of six out of six. Jamahl Epsicokhan at Jammer's Reviews said that the team behind Star Trek were \\"at the top of their game\\" with this episode. He gave it a score of four out of four, saying that \\"'Tribbles' is perhaps the best, most enjoyable comic piece the franchise has ever put out.\\" In 2009, Time rated \\"The Trouble with Tribbles\\" as one of the top ten moments of Star Trek, including television series and films up to that time. In 2017, Space.com ranked \\"The Trouble with Tribbles\\" the second best episode of all Star Trek television, including all Star Trek television series episodes prior to Star Trek: Discovery.

All of the nominees that year were episodes of Star Trek, with the award instead going to \\"The City on the Edge of Forever\\". From the number of votes, \\"The Trouble with Tribbles\\" was placed second.Gerrold (1973): p. 284 Home media release \\"The Trouble with Tribbles\\" was one of the first episodes to receive an official release by Paramount Home Entertainment. In 1980, it was released on VHS on a two-episode tape alongside \\"Let That Be Your Last Battlefield\\". It was re-released towards in 1991 as part of the first full-season release on VHS. This was re-released in 1993, and was released on laserdisc. In 1998, a \\"Talking Tribble Gift Set\\" was released which contained both \\"The Trouble with Tribbles\\" and \\"Trials and Tribble-ations\\" on VHS. The first DVD release was in 2000, when all of The Original Series episodes were released in individual releases of two episodes per disc. The first season set that the episode was included in was a part of the season two DVD set released in the United States on November 2, 2004. In 2009, it was included in a best of collection with three other episodes of The Original Series alongside \\"Amok Time\\", \\"The City on the Edge of Forever\\" and \\"Balance of Terror\\". The re-mastered DVD sets were also re-launched to coincide with the release of the film, Star Trek. The Blu-ray release included the un-changed scenes as alternative angles. Disc five of each set contained only \\"The Trouble with Tribbles\\" from The Original Series but otherwise contained tribble related extras. These included both \\"More Tribbles, More Troubles\\" and \\"Trials and Tribble-ations\\". Legacy =More Tribbles, More Troubles= \\"The Trouble with Tribbles\\" was originally intended to have a follow-up episode during season three, but after Gene Roddenberry stepped back from the production of the show after a time-slot change and further cuts in the budget, the idea was scrapped. In 1973, Gerrold had become friends with D. C. Fontana from their time spent on the Star Trek convention circuit together. He had heard about Star Trek: The Animated Series, and offered to do an episode. Fontana responded that she wanted the tribble episode that was cut from season three. This episode was entitled \\"More Tribbles, More Troubles\\". The episode introduces the natural predator of the tribbles and genetically engineered tribbles which no longer reproduce but instead grow much larger. As with his other Animated Series episode \\"Bem\\", he later explained that almost nothing was cut from the original pitches for the third season of The Original Series as animation played out quicker and so everything still fit into the episode despite the reduced running time. Both of Gerrold's Animated Series episodes were novelised by Alan Dean Foster, and Gerrold later said that he thought that he did \\"a fine job\\". =Trials and Tribble-ations= Actors such as Avery Brooks were digitally inserted into scenes from \\"The Trouble with Tribbles\\" for the DS9 episode To celebrate the 30th anniversary of Star Trek in 1996, producers of both Star Trek: Voyager and Star Trek: Deep Space Nine decided to incorporate elements of The Original Series into episodes. The Voyager episode \\"Flashback\\" showed events on board the Excelsior under Captain Hikaru Sulu during the period in which Kirk and McCoy were imprisoned on Rura Penthe in Star Trek VI: The Undiscovered Country. However, the Deep Space Nine homage used the original footage from nineteen scenes in \\"The Trouble with Tribbles\\" and other episodes in order to digitally insert the actors into the events of the episode, entitled \\"Trials and Tribble-ations\\". The episode was nominated for three Emmy Awards and as with the original episode, the Hugo Award for Best Dramatic Presentation. As the 30th anniversary approached, Gerrold had heard rumors of a tribble sequel in the works but had only heard denials from executive producer Rick Berman. Following an interview request from The New York Times, he telephoned Berman once more to ask what was happening as he did not want to say he did not know about the sequel episode and embarrass anyone if it actually was going to happen. Gerrold suggested that an acknowledgement of the creator of the tribbles might be in order and asked if he could be an extra. He was cast as a security redshirt. While Gerrold was on set, he also advised director Jonathan West on the integration of new scenes into \\"The Trouble with Tribbles\\". Gerrold later said that \\"Trials and Tribble-ations\\" \\"turned out beautiful. I think it was the best episode of Deep Space Nine ever and possibly the best episode of Star Trek after the Original Series.\\" Charlie Brill returned as Arne Darvin to film new scenes set in the DS9 timeframe.Block; Erdmann (2010): p. 209 = Erroneous claims = On the 2016 home video release The Roddenberry Vault, in a commentary track for the episode Gerrold states of the episode: \\"This was the first time the word 'pregnant' was used on TV.\\" This is false. While the very first use of the word on American television is not known, the word was spoken at least five years earlier in \\"Never Name a Duck,\\" the first episode of the second season of the Dick Van Dyke Show in September 1962. =Further appearances and parodies= Tribbles have been further seen in other Star Trek episodes and films, including Star Trek III: The Search for Spock and the JJ Abrams-helmed films Star Trek (2009) and Star Trek Into Darkness (2013). While on a visit to the set of Star Trek, Gerrold was told by Abrams that the tribble had been deliberately \\"snuck in\\" to the scene. It appears in the scene where Kirk (Chris Pine) and Spock Prime (Leonard Nimoy) meet Scott (Simon Pegg) on the Vulcan moon. \\"The Trouble with Tribbles\\" was also re-imagined in that timeline's comic book series by IDW Publishing and entitled \\"The Truth About Tribbles\\". In 2003, tribbles appeared in the Star Trek: Enterprise episode \\"The Breach\\". In that episode, Doctor Phlox (John Billingsley) uses them as food for his medicinal pets in sickbay. Gerrold has been in discussions with the fan-created series Star Trek: New Voyages to bring back the tribbles for a further Original Series era episode. Both his Original Series pitch \\"The Protracted Man\\" and his Star Trek: The Next Generation script Blood and Fire have been turned into episodes of New Voyages. Tribbles have been parodied in a variety of other television shows and types of media. Futurama featured a parody in the second season entitled \\"The Problem with Popplers\\", which included several Star Trek jokes. These include a reference to \\"Roddenberries\\" and features Zapp Brannigan, whom the Futurama staff have said is intended to be a parody of Captain Kirk. In 2000, a Drosophila (fruit fly) gene that blocks cell division was named tribbles () after the small, woolly, tribble-like cells with mutations in this gene. A review describing the discovery was named after this episode. Humans carry three homologs of tribbles, TRIB1, TRIB2, and TRIB3. In the 2003 video game Star Wars: Knights of the Old Republic, the player's ship becomes infested with a froglike species called Gizka, prompting the player to receive the quest \\"The Trouble with Gizka\\" in order to remove the pests. Circa early 2013, an internet meme parody started circulating, featuring a still from \\"The Trouble with Tribbles\\", with the face of Paul McCartney superimposed onto the body of Captain who is surrounded by tribbles, accompanied by the quip \\"Yesterday: All my tribbles seemed so far away\\", parodying the first line of McCartney's signature Beatles' song \\"Yesterday\\". In 2013, singer Bob Robertson expanded the meme into a full parody of the song's lyrics, stating that he first saw the original meme in a posting by George Takei. =Merchandising and adaptations= Gerrold published a book describing his experiences in the creation of \\"The Trouble with Tribbles\\". Entitled The Trouble with Tribbles: The Birth, Sale and Final Production of One Episode, it was published in 1973. The book was well-received by the former cast and crew of Star Trek and was used as a textbook for teaching screenwriting. A variety of tribble replicas have been made over the years, with the most recent licensed product coming from QMx, released in 2013. A plate to commemorate the episode was the first to be launched as part of an eight-plate Star Trek: The Commemorative Collection in 1986. It featured an image of Kirk with the tribbles in the grain compartment created by artist Susie Morton. The first Original Series expansion for the Star Trek Customizable Card Game was launched in 2000. It was entitled \\"The Trouble with Tribbles\\" and was based on this episode and the associated episode of Deep Space Nine. It also introduced the Tribbles game which used only tribble-related cards. In 2010, two movie posters for \\"The Trouble with Tribbles\\" featuring Uhura and Spock being slowly covered in tribbles were created by Justin Ishmael for the art boutique attached to the Alamo Drafthouse Cinema in Austin, Texas. It was a follow-up to earlier posters created for the episode \\"Space Seed\\". Juan Ortiz later created a 1960s-retro style poster for each of the eighty episodes of Star Trek. The \\"Trouble with Tribbles\\" poster made it appear that the warp nacelles of the Enterprise were sprouting tribbles which then bred rapidly as the ship flew on, creating a cloud of them behind the ship.

The university belongs to the Coimbra Group, the Guild, and Utrecht Network of European universities and is a member of the European University Association. The university was founded in Aarhus, Denmark, in 1928 and comprises five faculties in Arts, Natural Sciences, Technical Sciences, Health, and Business and Social Sciences and has a total of twenty-seven departments. It is home to over thirty internationally recognised research centres, including fifteen Centres of Excellence funded by the Danish National Research Foundation. The university is ranked among the top 100 world's best universities.QS Top Universities, , Aarhus University, 5 August 2013 The business school within Aarhus University, called Aarhus BSS, holds the EFMD (European Foundation for Management Development) Equis accreditation, the Association to Advance Collegiate Schools of Business (AACSB) and the Association of MBAs (AMBA). This makes the business school of Aarhus University one of the few in the world to hold the so-called Triple Crown accreditation. Times Higher Education ranks Aarhus University in the top 10 of the most beautiful universities in Europe (2018). The university's alumni include Bjarne Stroustrup, the inventor of programming language C++, Queen Margrethe II of Denmark, Crown Prince Frederik of Denmark, and Anders Fogh Rasmussen, former Prime Minister of Denmark and a Secretary General of NATO. Nobel Laureate Jens Christian Skou (Chemistry, 1997), conducted his groundbreaking work on the Na/K-ATPase in Aarhus and remained employed at the university until his retirement. Two other nobel laureates: Trygve Haavelmo (Economics, 1989) and Dale T. Mortensen (Economics, 2010). were affiliated with the university. History =Early developments= View of The Main Building overlooking the University Park. The building was finished in 1946 and holds the university assembly hall. Aarhus University was founded on 11 September 1928 as Universitetsundervisningen i Jylland (\\"University Studies in Jutland\\") with a budget of 33,000 Dkr and an enrollment of 64 students, which rose to 78 during the first semester. The university was founded as a response to the increasing number of students at the University of Copenhagen after World War I. Classrooms were rented from the Technical College and the teaching corps consisted of one professor of philosophy and four associate professors of Danish, English, German and French. Along with Universitets- Samvirket (\\"The University Association\\") which consisted of representatives of Aarhus' businesses, organisations and institutions, the municipality of Aarhus had fought since 1921 to have Denmark's next university located in the city. In 1929, the municipality of Aarhus gave the university land with a landscape of rolling hills. The design of the university buildings and 12 ha campus area was assigned to architects C. F. M√∏ller, Kay Fisker and Povl Stegmann, who won the architectural competition in 1931. Construction of the first buildings began a year later, but the campus was developed in stages and is still under development . Since 1939, C. F. M√∏ller Architects has been responsible for the architectural design of Aarhus University in accordance with the original functionalist design key, perhaps best exemplified by the characteristic yellow brick and tile. The first buildings were finished in 1933 and housed the Departments of Chemistry, Physics and Anatomy. These departments later moved to newer buildings at the campus and the original building complex now house Department of Psychology and Department of Political Science. The construction of the first stage was funded solely by donations which totaled 935,000 Dkr and the buildings covered an area of 4,190m2. One of the most generous contributors to the first stage was De Forenede Teglv√¶rker i Aarhus (\\"The United Tileworks of Aarhus\\") led by director K. Nymark. Forenede Teglv√¶rker decided to donate 1 million yellow bricks and tiles worth c. 50,000 Dkr and later decided to extend the donation to all bricks needed. The inauguration on 11 September 1933, marked the first official use of the name Aarhus University and was celebrated in a tent on campus, attended by King Christian X, Queen Alexandrine, their son Crown Prince Frederick and Prime Minister Stauning together with 1000 invited guests. On 23 April 1934, Aarhus University was given permission to hold examinations by the king and on 10 October 1935, Professor Dr. phil. Ernst Frandsen was appointed the first rector of the university. Shortages of materials and a stressed economy postponed and delayed further development of Aarhus University. In 1941, construction of The Main Building (Hovedbygningen) commenced, a complex to house the university aula (assembly hall) and canteen among academic and administrative purposes. The stringent minimalist and uncompromising functionalistic design of the first university buildings from 1933 had stirred some local dissatisfaction and it was decided that The Main Building should possess more traditional romantic and classical architectural inspirations - although in agreement with the original architectural plan -, and also make use of more lavish and expensive materials. The Main Building was finished in 1946 and still stands out from the rest of the University campus as somewhat different in its architectural design. In comparison with the original 4,190m2 floor space of the first buildings, Aarhus University now holds a floor space of 246,000m2 in the University Park alone. A series of buildings outside the main campus adds an additional floor space of 59,000m2. =Faculties= From 1928, Aarhus University offered courses in languages and philosophy, but the students were unable to finish their studies without going to the University of Copenhagen for their final examinations. By request of the Ministry of Education, the Teachers' Association made a draft of how to conduct the final examinations in the humanistic subjects in Aarhus and in the draft, the Association proposed that the faculty was named the Faculty of Humanities by analogy with the corresponding faculties in Uppsala, Lund and Turku. After negotiations between the faculties in Aarhus and Copenhagen, the King declared on 8 May 1935 that the final university examinations could be held at the Faculty of Philosophy in Copenhagen as well as at the Faculty of Humanities in Aarhus. This was the first final examinations Aarhus University was allowed to hold, but on 24 July 1936 the king granted the Faculty of Humanities the right to hold examinations for the magister degree and in 1940 for the PhD. Aarhus University had offered courses in basic medical subjects from 1933 and on 10 October 1935 the Faculty of Medicine was formally established. The establishment of a Faculty of Medicine in Aarhus was met with some opposition from the Faculty of Medicine at the University of Copenhagen. The professors thought that the state should not establish a new Faculty until the shortcomings of the old one had been solved. In the end, the professors agreed to sign a recommendation for the new Faculty as long as improvements to the old one were not delayed. By 1953, the Faculty of Medicine had been fully built, complete with lectures, professorship chairs, final exams, research facilities and the hospitals of Aarhus had been expanded to meet the demands of clinical training. In 1992, the Faculty of Medicine merged with the dental school and changed its name to Faculty of Health Sciences. In 1998, the new faculty emphasized clinical training for students of the third semester who have frequented one year of anatomy and cell biology, and introduced a new not assessed curriculum of pre-clinical skills laboratory (2 hours per week for 9 weeks) followed by two weeks of social medicine and a 8-week clinical clerkship at county hospitals. The university established its Faculty of Economics and Law in 1936, but when it offered courses in political science and in psychology (1959 and 1968, respectively), the faculty changed its name to the Faculty of Social Sciences. The faculty had to be funded solely on private donations and once the university demonstrated it had the needed financial means, the Minister of Education recommended the Finance Committee to approve the establishment of the faculty on 27 January 1936 since the state did not have to grant financial support. The Committee approved and by declaration of the king on 5 November 1937, the faculty could hold examinations in economics and law. Courses had been offered in theology since 1932 at the Faculty of Humanities, but in 1942 the Faculty of Theology was formally established. Already on 22 June 1928, Reverend Balslev of Aarhus had proposed that Universitetsundervisningen i Aarhus (not yet university) taught basic courses in theology. Though the proposal was greeted by the management, the Faculty of Theology in Copenhagen pointed out that it would take 3 full- time teachers of the New Testament, Old Testament and ecclesiastical history, respectively as well as education in Latin, Greek and Hebrew by the Faculty of Humanities. At this time, Universitetsundervisningen i Aarhus did not have the financial means to meet these criteria so the case was shelved for the time being. In April 1931, the case reopened, this time by Bishop Skat Hoffmeyer who proposed free teaching in the required subjects. The management asked the faculty in Copenhagen if this was acceptable, but because the teaching was free, the faculty saw it as tutoring rather than actual teaching and they neither approved or disproved of such an approach though they did not see it as actual university teaching. The municipality of Aarhus did not aid with funds and the management deemed a request of the state to be futile so they decided to disregard getting the teaching approved and start it anyway under the supervision of Skat Hoffmeyer. On 5 September 1932 Reverend Asmund held the first lecture in theology. This private education in theology continued until the university could hire its own professors in 1938, and in 1942 Aarhus University could at long last establish the Faculty of Theology. The Aarhus New University Hospital shares Masonic architectural elements related to its history of seat of the Danish Order of Freemasons. =The main building and World War II= The brick colonnades In 1938, the university management acknowledged it was time to consider an expansion due to lack of space and overcrowding of the auditoriums. The solution was The Main Building (Hovedbygningen), containing both rooms and facilities for new academic areas, as well as housing for the general administration, an assembly hall and a canteen. The building was to be organized according to a principle of institutes so that teaching and research took place in certain rooms with their own library and study for the professor. Memorial in the main building to honour the ten victims of the 1944 air strike and the two workers killed during construction in 1941. Detail from the Aula, with specially designed lamps and furniture. The construction of the building took place during the German occupation of Denmark (1940‚Äì45) in World War II, which affected the process in more than one way. No state funds had been involved in the construction of the first university building and a second building for physiology, biochemistry, and a high voltage laboratory, but because the Nazis were against civil use of materials and work forces, the state contributed to the main building. In 1943, the Gestapo, Sicherheitsdienst, Geheime Feldpolizei and Abwehr set up their regional headquarters in the five student halls of residence on campus. Fearing that the same would happen to the new main building, its completion was delayed. C. F. M√∏ller later wrote that for once there was plenty of time to work on the details of the building, like patterned brickwork, acoustic screens and furniture. Furniture designer Aage Windeleff, designed the furniture specially for the main building, while B√∏rge Mogensen's industrially produced furniture designs are the most commonly used elsewhere on campus. The presence of the Gestapo in Aarhus led to multiple arrests of Danish resistance fighters and the resistance movement soon realized they needed outside assistance. On 15 October, the leader of the illegal Danish underground army in Jutland, Niels Bennike, sent the following telegram to London: University Aula On 31 October 1944, the Royal Air Force bombed the Gestapo's headquarters in residence halls 4 and 5, also killing ten civilian workers. 2 Group Bomber Command carried out the bombing by using 25 Mosquito planes. The air strike on the University of Aarhus took place in a heavily populated area and the campus was surrounded by three hospitals. To avoid civilian casualties, the RAF prepared with a model of the campus, shooting at residence halls 4 and 5 with chalk bags. The architect C. F. M√∏ller was in the main building during the air strike but survived and was later dug free from the rubble. The reconstructed main building opened on 11 September 1946. =Since 1970= Aarhus University was an independent institution until 1970, but with management representatives from the city council and the organization of Universitets-Samvirket. Hereafter, the university became a state-run institution under the first University Act. With the next University Act in 1992, external organizations were once again represented in the administration and under the 2003 Act, all Danish universities are governed by a nationwide university board. This board appoints the rector, deans and heads of departments instead of the students. It commenced in January 2004 for the first time and in August 2005, a new rector was appointed. In 1994, the university was a scene of a shooting; 3 people (including the perpetrator) were killed and two more were injured. Aarhus University has hosted significant musical events. The Grateful Dead played there on April 16, 1972; the recorded performance was part of the group's Europe '72 tour. In the current century, several higher education institutions have been merged with Aarhus University. Following the Danish University reform of 2006, AU merged with the Business and Engineering School in Herning (now part of faculty of Business and Social Science) and the Danish School of Education in Copenhagen (now part of Faculty of Arts), making the university nationwide and adding 6,000 students. In 2011 the National Environmental Research Institute (NERI), until then part of the Ministry of Environment and Energy, and the Danish Research Centre for Agricultural Sciences (DJF), until then part of the Ministry of Agriculture, were merged into AU. The two institutions were initially integrated as separate entities, later fully integrated into the Faculty of Science and Technology. In 2012, Aarhus University's School of Engineering was merged with the university proper, making it Denmark's largest. A major reorganisation of the university effective 1 Jan 2011 reorganised departments into four faculties: Arts, Science and Technology, Health, and Business and Social Sciences. A further reorganisation occurred effective 1 Jan 2020, where Science and Technology was split into two new entities: Faculty of Technical Sciences and Faculty of Natural Sciences. Campus The University Park is at the center of the main university campus. Aarhus University's main campus is located in central Aarhus, encircling the University Park (Universitetsparken). The campus master plan competition was won in 1931 by the collaborative scheme of Danish architects Kay Fisker, C. F. M√∏ller and Povl Stegmann in collaboration with landscape architect Carl Theodor S√∏rensen. The design includes a wide variety of buildings in a large area, but each building is constructed of the same yellow brick and roofing tile and with a common design key, providing the whole campus with a unified appearance. Construction commenced in 1932 and has continued into present times, lately in 1999-2001 (S√∏auditorierne) and 2014-17 (AU Health). The original main building was one of the first Danish functionalist public buildings and has been included in the Ministry of Culture's canon of Danish architecture; it is acknowledged as one of the twelve most significant architectural works in the cultural history of Denmark. In a harmonic interplay with the park, the yellow buildings form a campus that has received international recognition for its aesthetic values and it has been protected by law since 1993, in order to conserve its unique design. C. F. M√∏ller and his company, C. F. M√∏ller Architects have continued as architects of the campus ever since, except the new department of AU Health currently under construction, designed by Cubo. The park and campus has been expanded throughout the years, in 1957 the old park of Vennelystparken, just south of the University park was included. Apart from the main campus, Aarhus University has several smaller campuses and departments throughout Aarhus. This includes the campus of Aarhus BSS, school of business and social sciences in Aarhus V, the new adjacent campus of Nobelparken, built in 1997‚Äì2004 in red brick, also by C. F. M√∏ller Architects, but in a different design, a campus at Tr√∏jborg for Nordic linguistics and related studies, and parts of the research park of IT-byen at Katrinebjerg, where the computer science institute also teach and do research. Archaeology and anthropology takes residence in Moesg√•rd Manor, an old manor house at the new Moesg√•rd Museum. In the city of Herning, there is also a small campus where a few of the university's business, engineering and technology programmes are taught, called the Department of Business Development and Technology.

The rector is appointed by the university board. The rector in turn appoints deans and deans appoint heads of departments. There is no faculty senate and faculty is not involved in the appointment of rector, deans, or department heads. Hence the university has no faculty governance. =Main academic areas= Since 1 January 2020, the university has been organised into five main academic areas: *Technical Sciences Institutions merged into Faculty of Science and Technology since 2011, within subjects of environmental sciences, agricultural science, and engineering. *Natural Sciences Departments, which were part of Faculty of Science until 2011, between 2011 and 2020 Science and Technology. *Arts ‚Äì consists of the former Faculty of Humanities and the former Faculty of Theology. *Aarhus BSS ‚Äì consists of the former Faculty of Social Sciences and the Aarhus School of Business. *Health ‚Äì consists of the former Faculty of Health Sciences. Academics Department of Law, part of The Main Building. Department of Mathematics Nobelparken, Aarhus Faculty of Arts , more than 42,000 students were enrolled in Aarhus University. Each year more than 1000 international exchange students come to Aarhus University to study for one or two terms. In 2009 close to 3000 international students were enrolled in full degree programmes. Aarhus University is an international university with a large proportion of students at the post-baccalaureate level: over half of its students are enrolled in master's degree and PhD programmes. In 2011, 59 of the university's 113 Master's degree programmes were taught in English. Talent development of young researchers has been identified as one of the university's core activities. This means that highly qualified students have the option of starting their PhD studies before completing their master's degree. The university's doctoral programmes allow talented students to enroll in a combined Master's/PhD programme either right after completing the bachelor's degree (the 3+5 track) or one year into their master's degree programme (the 4+4 track). Since 2006 the number of PhD students has risen from approximately 1000 to approximately 1700 in 2010.

The International Centre is often the first stop for foreign students at Aarhus University, since the centre offers advice on finding housing and living in Denmark. =AU Summer University= Starting in 2011 all summer courses and summer schools offered by Aarhus University for Bachelor's, Master's and PhD students will be gathered together and expanded to provide more diversity in a new framework: AU Summer University. In the summer of 2011 more than 80 courses were offered within the fields of humanities, theology, social sciences, health sciences, natural sciences, agricultural sciences, business and educational sciences. Summer courses are open to both Danish and international students. =Degree programmes= Aarhus University has seen some deep administrational changes since the turn of the century and now also includes several large sub-departments such as Aarhus BSS, AU Engineering and others. Each of these sub-departments offers undergraduate and/or graduate programmes specific to their own field of study. The core academic degree programmes of Aarhus University includes the following fields: *Agricultural Sciences *Biology *Bosnian/Croatian/Serbian *Chemistry *Chinese *Classical Archaeology *Classical Philology *Cognitive Science *Cognitive Semiotics *Comparative Religion *Computer Science *Czech *Dentistry *Digital Design *Economics *Engineering *Ethnography *European Studies *Food Science *Geology *Geophysics *History *History of Ideas *Hungarian *Information Studies *IT/IT Product Development *Japanese *Latin *Law *Linguistics *Management *Mathematical Economics *Mathematics *Media Studies *Medicine *Medieval and Renaissance Archaeology *Modern Languages *Molecular Biology *Musicology *Nanotechnology *Nordic Language and Literature *Philosophy *Physics and Astronomy *Political Science *Prehistoric Archaeology *Psychology *Religious Studies *Russian *Scandinavian Studies *Semitic Philology *Sports Science *Theology *The Religious Roots of Europe The university offers eight undergraduate and about 60 graduate programmes in English language. =Cheminova controversy and academic freedom at AU= Since 1944, Aarhus University owned Cheminova, a chemical manufacturer who among other controversies has been selling methyl parathion pesticide to Brazil farmers. In 2009, senior researcher Mette Jensen emailed her colleagues at AU, asking whether they thought Cheminova should stop selling the controversial pesticides. For this, the university threatened her with dismissal. The university's Pro-Vice-Chancellor S√∏ren E. Frandsen denied that the university had made any mistakes or threatened the freedom of speech and academic freedom of its staff. On 30 April 2015, Cheminva was sold to the FMC Corporation for DKK 8.5 billion, a controversial issue in itself. Major research centres Royal Danish Library, Aarhus, at the university campus The Victor Albech building, library of the Health faculty, Aarhus University Aarhus University is home to 15 Centres of Excellence supported by the Danish National Research Foundation and a considerable number of major research centres. The 15 Centres of Excellence are: * Centre for Membrane Pumps in Cells and Disease (PUMPKIN) * Centre for Insoluble Protein Structures (INSPIN) * Centre for Geomicrobiology * Centre for Materials Crystallography (CMC) * Centre for DNA Nanotechnology * Centre for Functionally Integrative Neuroscience (CFIN)d * Centre on Autobiographical Memory Research (CON AMORE) * Centre for Massive Data Algorithmics (MADALGO) * The Water and Salt Research Centre * Centre for Carbonate Recognition and Signaling (CARB) * Centre for Research in Econometric Analysis of Time Series (CREATES) which is one of the best econometrics center according to Economics Field Rankings: Econometrics  IDEAS/RePEc. Currently this center is positioned as second best center of research in econometric time series analysis. * Centre for Oxygen Microscopy and Imaging (COMI) * Centre for mRNP Biogenesis and Metabolism * Centre for Quantum Geometry of Moduli Spaces (QGM) * Centre for the Theory of Interactive Computation * Center for Theoretical Chemistry (qLEAP) Some of the university's other major research centres include MindLab and iNANO. =MINDlab= MINDLAB was established with a DKK 120 million grant awarded by the Danish Ministry of Science, Technology and Innovation. At MINDLab neuroscientists, psychologists, biologists, statisticians and researchers from other fields work together to understand the brain, its disorders, and its development through physical and social interactions ‚Äì and vice versa. =iNANO= The Interdisciplinary Nanoscience Center (founded in 2002 by Professor Flemming Besenbacher) offers a degree programme in nanoscience with an interdisciplinary curriculum covering a broad spectrum of introductory, advanced and specialised courses, aimed at providing the student with a sufficiently broad basis to conduct interdisciplinary research within nanoscience and at the same time achieve disciplinary depth and specialised skills in selected areas. Hence, the programme encompasses physics, chemistry, biology, molecular biology, mathematics and computer science. =Danish Centre for Environment and Energy (DCE)= In 2011 the National Environmental Research Institute of Denmark (NERI) was organisatorically moved from the Danish Ministry of Environment and Energy and merged into AU, under the new name Danish Centre for Environment and Energy (DCE). DCE consists of two departments: department of Bioscience and Department of Environmental Sciences, as well as a common secretariat, all under the Faculty of Technical Sciences. The core obligations of DCE continues to be to provide research based monitoring and advice to the Danish Government on environmental issues and conduct independent research and education within the same fields. =Danish Centre for Food and Agriculture (DCA)= Also in 2011 the Agricultural Research Institute of the Ministry of Agriculture was merged into AU. First as a separate faculty for Agricultural Research, later as part of the Faculty of Technical Sciences. The former departments are now organised as Departments of Agroecology, Animal Sciences, and Food Science, together with a common secretariat: Danish Centre for Food and Agriculture (DCA). The core obligations of DCA is to provide advice and supporting research to the Ministry of Agriculture and Fisheries, while the departments also engage in independent research and teaching. Student life Students from different fields meet in the numerous Friday bars, in the Student House Aarhus (Studenternes Hus) and at concerts in the University Park and around the rest of the city. The Friday bars are often organised by the different departments who set up a small bar in a canteen or classroom where beers and non-alcoholic drinks are served. The university also has a number of libraries, some of which are open around the clock. Almost every department has its own library, but the main library is the State and University Library. It has an extensive electronic journal database which students and staff can access either at the library or from home. Aarhus University Sports (AUS) is open to all university students and organises a wide range of activities from badminton, to fencing and chess. =Student organisations= The largest student organisations at Aarhus University are the Student Union (Studenterr√•det) and Studenterlauget. The Student Union represents the main student body at Aarhus University while Studenterlauget is a mainly social organisation at School of Business and Social Sciences. The Student Union has both student seats on the university board.The Board of the University of Aarhus , Aarhus University, www.au.dk The Student Union also arranges annual concerts and seminars, and publishes the student magazine Delfinen (The Dolphin). There are political students organisations at the university, the largest of which include the Social- Democratic Students (Frit Forum), Conservative Students (Konservative Studenter), and Liberal Students (Liberale Studerende). The Conservative Students union publishes the student magazine Critique. The Liberal Students union publishes the leaflet Minerva. =Clubs and societies= Aarhus University offers many activities and services for foreign and Danish students. Several \\"Friday Bars\\", clubs organized and crewed by students at the university offer cheap beer and drinks, which has a wide appeal to the student body. The Students House  Studenternes Hus (The Students House), built in 1964 Studenternes Hus (The Students House) was built in 1964 at the central campus to accommodate students organisations, activities, festivities and gatherings. Among many other things, the buildings are headquarters to the students organisation Studenterhus Aarhus, and Aarhus University offers a free membership to all exchange students. The Students House is a meeting place for international and Danish students in Aarhus and Studenterhus Aarhus organize social and cultural activities throughout the year, ranging from parties and road trips, to language classes and weekly international nights (a popular dinner club). Aarhus University Sports (AUS) AUS is the official sports club of Aarhus University, and is open to all university students. It is an umbrella organisation consisting of 14 independent member clubs, which host a wide range of activities, from badminton to fencing to chess. In addition, AUS also offers independent activities such as indoor soccer tournaments, gym facilities and skiing trips. Dale's Caf√© Dale's Caf√© Dale's Caf√© is a meeting place for international students and the university's PhD students that opened in 2011. The caf√© offers coffee, sandwiches and a wide selection of beers. It has an informal lounge area where students and young researchers can relax while enjoying snacks and beverages. Like the main building, Dale's Caf√© is named after Aarhus University's 2010 Nobel Laureate in Economic Sciences, Dale T. Mortensen. The Dale T. Mortensen Building houses the International Centre, the PhD House and the IC Dormitory, which contains 28 dorm rooms and two apartments dedicated to recently arrived international PhD students. Klubben Klubben (in English 'the club') is a bar located at the former ASB (Aarhus School of Business), now under the faculty of School of Business and Social Sciences. The bar is open during regular school hours and weekdays, but hosts larger parties during Fridays and in relation to major sports events. Admittance is usually restricted to students of the School of Business and Social Sciences.Klubben Studenterlauget Studenterlauget, School of Business and Social Sciences (at the former ASB) is currently the largest student organisation in Denmark ‚Äì Studenterlauget. The organisation has approximately 4,000 members whom they service through nine smaller \\"business units\\". Studenterlauget has around 130 employees, most of them students.

It was written by D. C. Fontana and Gene Roddenberry and directed by Corey Allen. Roddenberry was the creator of Star Trek, and Fontana was a writer on the original series. It was originally aired as a two-hour (with commercials) TV movie, and subsequent reruns typically split the episode into two parts. Set in the 24th century, the series follows the adventures of the Starfleet crew of the Federation starship Enterprise-D. In this episode, the crew of the newly built Enterprise examine the mysterious Farpoint Station which the Bandi people are offering to the Federation, while under the gaze of a powerful alien entity that calls itself \\"Q\\" (John de Lancie). The episode was made as a pilot for the new Star Trek series, and was a double length episode at Paramount Television Group's insistence. After the show was initially announced on October 10, 1986, Roddenberry put together a production team which included staff members from the original series such as Robert H. Justman. The show utilized some existing sets and props from the Star Trek films and both Star Trek: The Original Series and Star Trek: Phase II. New actors were hired for the pilot, which in some cases required the character concepts to be redeveloped to better fit the actor. Marina Sirtis and Denise Crosby were hired for the roles of Macha Hernandez and Deanna Troi respectively, but were later switched by Roddenberry and Crosby's new role renamed to Tasha Yar. DeForest Kelley agreed to appear in a cameo role in the pilot, but as a gesture to Roddenberry, he refused to be paid more than the minimum possible salary. The show made its debut in syndication to a mixed critical response, an assessment which was upheld by critics reassessing the episode following the end of the entire series. Plot In 2364, the new flagship of the United Federation of Planets, Starfleet's , travels to the planet Deneb IV for its maiden voyage. Enterprise is to open relations with the simple Bandi people who have somehow been able to tap immense energy reserves and construct Farpoint Station, much to the surprise of the Federation. En route, the Enterprise is met by an omnipotent being who identifies himself as Q, a member of the Q Continuum and declares that humanity is being put on trial‚Äîposing in appearance as a Grand Inquisitor‚Äîand deciding that their actions in their upcoming mission will be used to judge their worthiness and determine their fate as a race. Before letting the ship resume its course, Q warns Captain Picard (Patrick Stewart) that he is destined to fail. As the Enterprise arrives, the crew members explore the offerings of Farpoint Station and establish relations with their Bandi host, Groppler Zorn (Michael Bell). The crew becomes suspicious when items they desire seem to appear out of nowhere moments later, and are unable to identify the power source that feeds the station. Deanna Troi (Marina Sirtis), an empath, senses a being with powerful yet despairing emotions nearby, and the crew discover a strange labyrinth beneath the station, but Zorn does not offer an explanation. As the Enterprise crew continues its explorations, a large unknown alien craft enters orbit and begins to fire upon an older Bandi settlement near Farpoint Station, and abducts Zorn. Before Picard orders the ship's phasers to be fired at the craft, Q appears to remind him of humanity's trial and prompts Picard to send an away team to the alien craft. The away team discovers the craft has passages similar to those under Farpoint and they are able to free Zorn. Their actions cause the alien craft to transform into a jellyfish-like space creature, and Picard is able to deduce the mystery of Farpoint Station. He confirms with the apologetic Zorn that the Bandi found a similar lifeform injured on their planet and, while attempting to care for it, they also exploited its ability to synthesize matter to create Farpoint Station. The creature now in orbit is trying to help free its mate by attacking those who hold it captive. Though Q goads Picard into punishing the Bandi, Picard refuses, instead ordering the Enterprise to fire a vivifying energy beam onto Farpoint after the station is evacuated. The beam allows the land-bound creature to transform back into its jellyfish-like form, and it flies into orbit to join its fellow being. As the crew watches the reunion of the alien creatures, Q reluctantly tells Picard that they have succeeded in their test, but hints that they will meet again. Production =Conception and development history= The new Star Trek series was announced on October 10, 1986 by the head of Paramount Television Group, Mel Harris. He announced that the creator of Star Trek, Gene Roddenberry, was to be executive producer and lead the creation of the new series.Nemecek (2003): p. 1 It was the second attempt at creating a new live action television series based on Star Trek for Paramount; production on the previous attempt in 1977, called Star Trek: Phase II, became Star Trek: The Motion Picture. When the decision was made not to proceed with the Paramount network it had been slated to be the flagship for, and interest in a new movie was piqued after the release of Star Wars. Paramount had pitched ideas to Roddenberry earlier in 1986 as it was the twentieth anniversary of the original series, but Roddenberry turned them down and initially didn't want to do a new series. He later said, \\"It was only when the Paramount people agreed with me and said a sequel was probably impossible anyway that my interest was piqued.\\"Nemecek (2003): p. 2 All four major networks turned down the new Star Trek series, as they were not willing to commit to a twenty-six-hour first season with a guaranteed unchanging time slot as well as a promotional campaign for the show. The team proceeded with the project with the backing of Paramount. Roddenberry began putting together a production crew which included colleagues who had worked with him on the original series, including Robert H. Justman,Nemecek (2003): p. 3 David Gerrold, and Eddie Milkis.Nemecek (2003): p. 4 Justman proposed three ideas to the others on October 17, including families on board the ship, a concept which later became the holodeck and both an android and a Klingon character. One idea discussed by the production team was for Deanna Troi to have three breasts to which writer D. C. Fontana objected. Fontana, who had previously worked on a number of episodes of the original series, was tasked with writing the script for the pilot. The production team met in full for the first time on February 18, 1987, having received the first draft of Fontana's script a few days earlier.Nemecek (2003): p. 7 The original premise involved the Enterprise and the USS Starseeker approaching an alien lifeform captured by a race called the Annoi and turned into a weapon. After the Annoi told the Starfleet ships to surrender, the Starseeker opened fire and was destroyed, while Troi contacted the alien and convinced it to crash on a nearby planet so that the Enterprise can help it to free itself along with rescuing other prisoners the Annoi were using as slaves on the surface. Despite numerous changes taking place to the plot before the final version, some of the introductions for various characters made it through to the final version.Nemecek (2003): p. 24 The plot involving Q was added subsequently to the episode in order to make it longer. Roddenberry was aiming for an hour-long pilot, but Paramount wanted a two-hour show and eventually won out. Other items were also added in order to lengthen the episode, including the saucer separation sequence and the appearance of Admiral Leonard McCoy. =Casting= English actress Marina Sirtis originally gained the role of Security Chief Macha Hernandez Roddenberry realized early on that a series with the original crew from Star Trek was unlikely to be practical, nor did he want to recast the roles or have a \\"retread\\" crew ‚Äì a series of different characters in very similar roles to the original series. He explained, \\"I would hate to think our imagination is so slender that there aren't other possibilities to think about.\\" The first casting call was sent out on December 10, 1986. While some characters such as Geordi La Forge and Beverly Crusher remain recognizable from their descriptions in the initial casting call, others have clear differences; \\"Julien Picard\\" would lapse into a French accent when he became emotional, and Data was non-Caucasian. Macha Hernandez was a Latino security chief based on Jenette Goldstein's role in Aliens, while Deanna Troi was to appear \\"foreign\\" or more specifically of an Icelandic or Scandinavian nature. Leslie Crusher was listed as a fifteen-year- old girl with a photographic memory,Nemecek (2003): p. 13 although was quickly changed to a male teenager called Wesley. Justman argued for a female teenager but Roddenberry thought that there would be a greater number of storylines available if the character was male.Nemecek (2003): p. 14 Patrick Stewart was cast in the role of Jean-Luc Picard after Justman saw him perform at the University of California, Los Angeles.Nemecek (2003): p. 17 Roddenberry insisted that he wanted a French actor in the role, but Justman arranged a meeting between Stewart and the production team to introduce the actor, and later Rick Berman supported the casting. Fontana thought that American actor Stephen Macht would be better in the role. Justman wanted Stewart in the show in some capacity, and with Roddenberry still opposing him as Picard, Justman suggested that he might be a good fit instead for Data. Because Roddenberry couldn't find an actor he preferred more for Picard, he relented and changed his concept of Picard to better fit Stewart.Nemecek (2003): p. 18 Although Stewart was willing to put on an American accent to portray the role of Picard, the producers asked him to use his natural accent instead. They also tested him with a hairpiece but thought that it looked \\"awful\\". Stewart was pleased to have received the role, saying that his children were impressed with the new part and praised the mythos of the show saying, \\"The great strength of Star Trek is its epic, classic feel. For an actor of my background, it has more richness and depth than you might expect on television.\\" Roddenberry's favorite for Riker was Jonathan Frakes, who went through seven auditions before claiming the role. Despite being the second choice of the casting team, he was hired after their first choice was unimpressive in his auditions. LeVar Burton had worked with Justman on another pilot for a series called Emergency Room and was suggested to apply for the role of La Forge. For US audiences he was the most well-known actor in the cast, due to his role in Roots.Nemecek (2003): p. 16 Gates McFadden and Brent Spiner gained the parts of Beverly Crusher and Data respectively through the normal audition processes.Nemecek (2003): p. 19 Eric Menyuk had also been considered for the part of Data, and would later be cast as the recurring character of the Traveller in three subsequent episodes.Reeves-Stevens (1998): p. 50 Justman later said that he was the only one out of the production team who preferred Menyuk in the role. Marina Sirtis auditioned for the role of Macha Hernandez, while Denise Crosby auditioned for the part of Deanna Troi. They both gained the parts with the approval of Berman and Justman, but Roddenberry switched the roles of the actresses as he thought Sirtis would be better suited for the role of the ship's counselor. Macha Hernandez was re- written to become Tasha Yar to better suit Crosby. The role of Worf required a black actor in order to make the Klingon make up easier to apply, and was expected to be only a recurring character, but following the casting of Michael Dorn and his work in \\"Encounter at Farpoint\\", the role was expanded. Wil Wheaton was cast as Wesley Crusher despite what he perceived as an \\"awful\\" first callback.Nemecek (2003): p. 20 DeForest Kelley, who played Leonard McCoy in the original series, reprised his role in a cameo in this episode. The appearance of DeForest Kelley as Leonard McCoy was kept a secret, with the character only being referred to in scripts as \\"Admiral\\". While Roddenberry had wanted Kelley to appear, he thought that the actor would turn him down. The two had lunch together and Roddenberry suggested the appearance, with Kelley agreeing not only to appear, but also that he wouldn't take anything more than the Screen Actor's Guild base salary for the part. He later said, \\"I just wanted scale, to let it be my way of saying thank you to Gene for the many good things he has done for me\\". John de Lancie deliberately missed his first audition for Q as he was appearing as a lead in a play at the time. A second audition was arranged during lunchtime so that he could attend. He later said that after he auditioned, \\"a big guy walked out, put his hands on my shoulder, and said, 'You make my words sound better than they are.' I said, 'Well, you must be the writer.' And he said, 'I'm Gene Roddenberry.' I had absolutely no idea who that was.\\" Colm Meaney was cast in the part of the conn ensign on the ship's battle bridge, and after a further appearance in the episode \\"Lonely Among Us\\", his character was given the name Miles O'Brien in season two. The cast was announced on May 15, 1987. There was a certain degree of uncertainty regarding job security during the pilot for the main cast, as they did not hear until after production had wrapped that the show had been picked up for a further thirteen episodes.Reeves-Stevens (1998): p. 57 =Filming= Due to what was seen as a low budget for the pilot and series in general, the existing sets and equipment from the Star Trek movies were re- used in the new show. Milkis and Justman were given the task of reviewing the standing sets from the movies on the Paramount lot in order to see what they could use. The duo would later recall that one stage was so completely covered with cat feces due to the number of cats living on the lot that the pair couldn't walk on the set.Nemecek (2003): p. 8 Certain sets were re-used, including a re-dress of the Enterprise bridge from Star Trek III: The Search for Spock to act as the Enterprise battle bridge in the new series.Nemecek (2003): p. 9 The main engineering set from Star Trek III became the new main engineering set, albeit with a command console from Star Trek IV added as well as two walls from sickbay from Star Trek III. The rest of the sickbay set became the observation lounge during the first season. Some of the sets contained components from both Star Trek: The Motion Picture and the unfilmed Star Trek: Phase II.Nemecek (2003): p. 10 After running tests with a company for computer-generated special effects, it was decided that, for the sake of reliability, Industrial Light & Magic would produce the new models of the Enterprise,Nemecek (2003): p. 11Reeves-Stevens (1998): p. 49 at a cost of $75,000 for a and a version. ILM was also integral to the development of the \\"jump to warp\\" special effect, which resulted in the company remaining on the show's end credits through its entire run.Nemecek (2003): p. 12 Filming of \\"Encounter at Farpoint\\" began on the Paramount lot May 29, 1987, and wrapped on June 25.Reeves-Stevens (1998): p. 48 Wil Wheaton noted that during the filming of \\"Encounter at Farpoint\\", most of the cast believed that the series would not last more than a year.Wheaton (2009): p. 24 Reception One critic described Patrick Stewart as a \\"damn fine actor\\", while another thought he was a \\"grim bald crank\\". The show was broadcast on both 98 independent stations and 112 network affiliates. In several locations, including Dallas, Los Angeles, Seattle and Miami, the stations which were broadcasting \\"Encounter at Farpoint\\" gained higher ratings than the four major networks during prime time. Overall, it aired to an audience of 27 million. The show was immediately called the \\"highest-rated syndicated one-hour drama series on television\\". Jill L. Lanford watched the episode for The Herald Journal, prior to the series premiere. She thought it was a resurrection of a \\"legend\\". She believed the episode itself was reminiscent of classic Star Trek episodes \\"Arena\\" and \\"The Squire of Gothos\\", was the \\"perfect vehicle to introduce the crew\\", and a \\"perfect start\\". Don Merrill, writing for TV Guide said that the show was a \\"worthy successor to the original\\".Reeves-Stevens (1998): p. 58 Bob Niedt reviewed \\"Encounter at Farpoint\\" for Newhouse News and thought that the show had potential on the back of the episode, but there were problems such as \\"spots where the dialogue is pedestrian and interactions sputter\\". Tom Shales of The Washington Post viewed DeForest Kelley's cameo as \\"touching\\", but thought that Patrick Stewart was a \\"grim bald crank who would make a better villain\\". He felt Jonathan Frakes \\"verges on namby-pamby\\". Actress Marina Sirtis later recalled the reviews of the show's debut in 1987 while being interviewed to promote The Next Generation's fourth film, Star Trek: Nemesis, saying \\"they bloody hated us\\". Several reviewers reassessed the episode some time after the series aired. Michelle Erica Green reviewed the episode for TrekNation, and found the episode disappointing with reference to the character of Captain Picard and the female crew members and a lack of sense of fun. Actor Wil Wheaton, also reviewing the episode years later for TV Squad, gave the episode a 'C-' grade, suggesting that \\"at the time, Trekkies who were hoping to see the Star Trek that they were used to from the sixties must have been disappointed\\". Zack Handlen at The A.V. Club, criticized some of the elements of the episode, such as the \\"long, rather pointless sequence\\" where the Enterprise undergoes a saucer separation and overall described the episode \\"more functional than inspiring\\". He praised the performance of Patrick Stewart as Captain Picard, describing him as a \\"damn fine actor\\" and enjoyed John de Lancie as Q. He gave the episode an overall score of B-. James Hunt, from Den of Geek, re-reviewed the show following the re-release of season one on Blu-ray Disc. He stated, \\"even if it wasn't the first episode, it'd be worth watching\\" despite it coming from \\"what could arguably be called the worst season of Star Trek\\". Keith DeCandido for Tor.com thought that the pace of the episode was slow, but that both Patrick Stewart and Brent Spiner stood out from the rest of the cast for good reasons. He enjoyed the references to the original series, especially DeForest Kelley's appearance. He gave it overall a score of four out of ten. The episode was one of a handful of Star Trek programs recommended for viewing to introduce new viewers to the mythos in Jon Wagnar and Jan Lundeen's 1998 book Deep Space and Sacred Time: Star Trek in the American Mythos. In 2018, Tom's Guide rated \\"Encounter at Farpoint\\" one of the 15 best episodes featuring Picard, noting that he gets to take command of his new ship, the Enterprise 1701D. In May 2019, The Hollywood Reporter ranked \\"Encounter at Farpoint\\" among the top twenty five episodes of Star Trek: The Next Generation, counting it as one episode not two. In 2017, Gamespot ranked this as the 5th best pilot episode of a Star Trek series. In 2017, Den of Geek ranked this episode as one of the top 25 \\"must watch\\" episodes of Star Trek: The Next Generation when paired with the series finale \\"All Good Things..\\" . Den of Geek also listed \\"Encounter at Farpoint\\" as one of the top ten ground-breaking episodes of Star Trek: The Next Generation. In 2019, The Hollywood Reporter listed this episode among the twenty five best episodes of Star Trek: The Next Generation. In 2020, SciFiPulse.net ranked this episode one of the top seven about the character Captain Picard. The episode was nominated for a Hugo award. In 2020, Vulture recommended this one of top 14 best Star Treks to watch along with Star Trek: Picard, noting that it introduces the Enterprise 1701D spacecraft, Picard, Data, and many other characters. Home media release Star Trek: The Next Generation made its debut on VHS in September 1991 with \\"Encounter at Farpoint\\" as a feature- length episode on a single tape. It was subsequently released on DVD on region one on March 26, 2002. The sound was remastered to Dolby Digital 5.1 Surround standards, and a series of interviews with the cast and crew were included on the sixth disc. \\"Encounter at Farpoint\\" was one of the first episodes of the series to be released on Blu-ray Disc. The episode was remastered into high- definition video and involved the original production team in updating some of the special effects in the episode. It was featured on the single disc sampler of the series which was launched prior to any full season box sets in early 2012, entitled Star Trek: The Next Generation ‚Äì The Next Level along with two other episodes. \\"Encounter at Farpoint\\" was subsequently included in the Blu- ray Disc release of the season one box set. Novel A novelization of this episode was published by Pocket Books, it was one of five novelizations to be made of The Next Generation episodes, alongside \\"Unification\\", \\"Descent\\", \\"Relics\\" , and \\"All Good Things...\\". There were additional novels written featuring the character Q, The Q Continuum trilogy was conceived by John J. Ordover at Pocket Books. The author only accepted the project after rewatching all the television episodes featuring Q.

C. Fontana ","title":"Encounter at Farpoint"},{"id":"401302","text":"The Honours of Scotland, informally known as the Scottish Crown Jewels, dating from the fifteenth and sixteenth centuries, are the oldest surviving set of crown jewels in the British Isles. The regalia were used together for the coronation of Scottish monarchs from Mary I in 1543 until Charles II in 1651. They were used to represent Royal Assent to legislation in the Estates of Parliament before England and Scotland were unified under one parliament in 1707, at which time the Honours were locked away in a chest and the English Crown Jewels were adopted by British monarchs. They were rediscovered in 1818 and have been on public display at Edinburgh Castle ever since. The Honours have been used at state occasions including the first official visit to Scotland as monarch by George IV in 1822 and the first such visit by Elizabeth II in 1953. The Scottish Parliament was founded in 1999 and the Honours are used there once again to represent Royal Assent. There are three primary elements of the Honours of Scotland: the crown, the sceptre, and the Sword of State. The gold crown, decorated with gems and pearls, is Scottish, and the sceptre and sword were gifts from the pope made in Italy. They also appear on the crest of the royal coat of arms of Scotland and on the Scottish version of the royal coat of arms of the United Kingdom, where the red lion of the King of Scots is depicted holding the sword and sceptre and wearing the crown. Robes, a pair of spurs and a ring also had been part of the Scottish regalia, and queens consort had their own consort crown, none of which survives today. The secondary Honours comprise a silver-gilt wand, three items of insignia and a ring once owned by James VII added in 1830, and a necklace with a locket and pendant bequeathed to Scotland by the Duchess of Argyll in 1939. History =Early history= Use of regalia by monarchs in Scotland can be traced back to when Britain was converted to Christianity in the Middle Ages.Burnett and Tabraham, p. 10. In the earliest known depiction of a Scottish king wearing his symbols of sovereignty, King Edgar wears a crown and bears a sword and a sceptre on his Great Seal; he reigned from 1097 until 1107. His son, Alexander I, is shown holding an orb ‚Äì a pictorial emblem of divine kingship that was not actually part of the Scottish Honours. By the reign of John Balliol, the regalia consisted of a crown, sceptre, sword and ring.Burnett and Tabraham, p. 12. After the English invasion in 1296, the regalia and Stone of Scone, upon which monarchs of Scotland were invested and crowned, were captured by the English army and taken south to London.Burnett and Tabraham, p. 13. New items were made for subsequent coronations, and these were gradually replaced during the 16th century with the current set of Honours, consisting of a crown made in Scotland by John Mosman and a sword and a sceptre both made in Italy and given to Scotland as papal gifts.Burnett and Tabraham, p. 15. A consort crown was made for Mary of Guise, wife of James V, in 1539; it does not survive among the Honours.Burnett and Tabraham, p. 25. The monarch's regalia were first used together by Mary, Queen of Scots in 1543.Whatley, p. 15. By the second half of the century, they represented royal authority in the Scottish Parliament, and Acts of Parliament were given royal assent when the monarch or one of his or her commissioners touched it with the royal sceptre.Burnett and Tabraham, p. 31. =17th century= Saving the Honours from Oliver Cromwell. Tableau at Edinburgh Castle. Spurs ‚Äì emblems of knighthood and chivalry ‚Äì were presented to Charles I at his Scottish coronation in 1633; the spurs and coronation robes also have been lost.Burnett and Tabraham, p. 25. The Honours were last used at coronation in 1651 by Charles II. His father Charles I had been overthrown and executed by order of the Parliament of England, which ordered almost all of the English Crown Jewels to be melted down and struck into coins. However, the Honours of Scotland were hidden, firstly in Dunnottar Castle, which was later besieged by the New Model Army, and from where the Honours were smuggled out; secondly under the floor of Kinneff Parish Church, to be recovered after the Restoration of the monarchy in 1660. Although they had been found, the Honours were no longer used to crown Scottish sovereigns after Charles II.Royal Family Until the Acts of Union 1707, which united the Kingdom of Scotland and the Kingdom of England to form the Kingdom of Great Britain, the Honours of Scotland were taken to sittings of the Parliament of Scotland to represent the monarch, who lived in England since the Union of the Crowns in 1603. After the Act of Union, the two parliaments having been dissolved, the Parliament of Great Britain sat in London; the Honours of Scotland, having no symbolic role in the unified British Parliament, were locked away in a chest at Edinburgh Castle.Royal Family =19th century= Rediscovering the Honours in 1818. Tableau at Edinburgh Castle. There they remained, almost forgotten, until 1818 when the future George IV, acting as Prince Regent, issued a royal warrant authorising the historian Walter Scott and a group of officials to break down the wall of the ancient Crown Room on 4 February. Half expecting to find the oak chest empty, they were relieved to open it and discover the crown, sceptre and sword exactly as they had been left 111 years earlier. The Royal Standard was hoisted above Edinburgh Castle in celebration of the historic moment. Cheers of excitement rippled through the castle, and members of the public gathered outside to hear the news.Burnett and Tabraham, p. 4. On 26 May 1819, the Honours went on public display in the Crown Room.Burnett and Tabraham, p. 47. They were guarded by two veterans of the Battle of Waterloo dressed in a Tudor-style Yeoman's outfit. George IV was crowned king in 1821 and his visit to Scotland the following year was the first by a monarch since 1651. On 12 August 1822, the Honours were escorted in procession to the Palace of Holyroodhouse. There was a carnival atmosphere, with people lining the streets and observing from windows. Three days later, the king arrived at the palace and symbolically touched the regalia. Before leaving the country a week later, he took part in a return procession to the Castle, where the Honours would remain until the 20th century.Burnett and Tabraham, p. 48. =20th century to present day= In 1911 the sword was carried before George V at the official opening of the Thistle Chapel in St Giles' Cathedral, Edinburgh ‚Äì the first time any of the regalia had left Edinburgh Castle since 1822.Burnett and Tabraham, p. 51. During the Second World War, the Honours were hidden at the Castle owing to fears they might be lost if the UK fell to Germany. The crown and Stewart Jewels were buried under the floor of a water closet, while the sceptre, sword and wand were hidden inside a wall. The only officials who knew of the hiding places were George VI, the Scottish Secretary of State, the King's Remembrancer, and the Governor General of Canada.Burnett and Tabraham, p. 50. In 1953, they were presented to the newly crowned Elizabeth II at a National Service of Thanksgiving in St Giles' Cathedral. Keen to avoid the service being interpreted as a Scottish coronation, Winston Churchill, then Prime Minister, advised the Queen to dress with relative informality.Douglas S. Mack in McCracken-Flesher, \\"Can the Scottish subaltern speak?\\", p. 146. From 1971 until 1987 the sword was used at the installation of a Knight of the Order of the Thistle, Scotland's highest Order of Chivalry. When the Stone of Scone was returned to Scotland in 1996 it also was placed in the Crown Room alongside the Honours. During renovations in the 1990s, the Honours were temporarily stored at an anonymous bank in Edinburgh. The Crown of Scotland was present in May 1999 at the first sitting of the devolved Scottish Parliament. It was carried on a cushion, the official reason being that it was too fragile for the Queen to wear.Robert Crawford in McCracken-Flesher, \\"The Crown\\", p. 246. The crown was present again in October 2004 at the opening of the new Scottish Parliament Building and at the opening ceremonies of each new session of the Scottish Parliament.Royal Family In 2018 plans were announced to renovate the \\"past its sell-by date\\" Honours exhibition and improve accessibility. Regalia =Crown= It is not known exactly when the original Crown of Scotland was made, but it can be seen in its pre-1540 form in a portrait of James IV in the Book of Hours that was created for his marriage to Margaret Tudor in 1503.Burnett and Tabraham, pp. 24‚Äì27. Arches were added to the crown by James V in 1532, making it an imperial crown, symbolising the king's pretensions of being an emperor of his own domain, subservient to no one but God. Arches first appeared as pictorial emblems on coins under James III, who in 1469 claimed \\"ful jurisdictione and free impire within his realm\\".Andrea Thomas in Goodare and MacDonald, \\"Crown Imperial: Coronation Ritual and Regalia in the Reign of James V\\", p. 66. In 1540 the base was melted down and recast by the Edinburgh goldsmith John Mosman with the addition of 22 gemstones to the original 20 and an extra of gold. James V first wore it to his wife's coronation in the same year at Holyrood Abbey. It weighs and the base is decorated with alternating fleurs-de-lis and crosses fleury. Two gold arches, preserved from the original, are surmounted by a gold monde enamelled blue with stars representing the night sky. On top of the monde is a cross decorated with black enamel, pearls, and a large amethyst. A purple velvet cap was manufactured by Thomas Arthur of Edinburgh; this was changed to a red cap by James VII (1685‚Äì88), and the present cap dates from 1993. Four gold ornaments with a large pearl in the centre are attached to the cap between the crown's arches. =Sceptre= The Sceptre of Scotland was a gift made in Italy from Pope Alexander VI to James IV in either 1491 or 1494 and was remodelled and lengthened in 1536. It is made of silver gilt and topped by a finial of polished rock. The sceptre includes grotesques and Christian symbols: stylised dolphins ‚Äì symbols of the Church ‚Äì appear on the head of the rod, as do images of the Virgin Mary holding a baby Christ, of Saint James the Great, and of Saint Andrew holding a saltire.Burnett and Tabraham, pp. 17, 22‚Äì23. =Sword of State= The Sword of State of Scotland was also a papal gift: Pope Julius II presented it to James IV in 1507 (see blessed sword and hat). It was made by Domenico da Sutri and replaced a native sword that had been made in 1502. The etched blade, measuring in length, includes figures of Saint Peter and Saint Paul, as well as the etched name of Julius II. The silver-gilt handle bears figures of oak leaves and acorns, with a crossguard in the form of dolphins. It is accompanied by a wooden scabbard which is bound in crimson velvet with silver-gilt repouss√© work and hung from a woven silk and thread- of-gold belt that has a silver-gilt buckle.Burnett and Tabraham, pp. 18‚Äì21. Other jewels in the Crown Room Since 1818 the coronation regalia have been supplemented in the Crown Room with other pieces of ceremonial jewellery. =Wand= Alongside the crown, sceptre and sword, Walter Scott found a silver-gilt wand. It measures in length and is topped with a faceted crystal monde surmounted by a cross. The wand has a wooden core and the unknown maker's initials F.G. The object's intended role ‚Äì if it had one at all ‚Äì has been forgotten, and its presence among the regalia is still a mystery. Walter Scott thought it may have been carried before the Lord High Treasurer of Scotland. Although the Treasurer did have a mace it was a different shape.Burnett and Tabraham, p. 52. =Stewart Jewels= Four objects taken into exile by James VII after the Glorious Revolution in 1688 are also displayed: a locket, a Great George and collar, and a ruby ring. They all returned to Britain 119 years later and were given to Edinburgh Castle on permanent loan by William IV in 1830.Burnett and Tabraham, pp. 52‚Äì54. The St Andrew Jewel of the Order of the Thistle is a gold and silver locket suspended from a ribbon that contains an oval piece of chalcedony into which is carved a cameo figure of Saint Andrew. The cameo is bordered with 12 diamonds. Inscribed on the back is the Order's Latin motto: NEMO ME IMPUNE LACESSIT, meaning \\"no one attacks me with impunity\\". Inside is a miniature portrait of Princess Louise of Stolberg-Gedern, wife of Prince Charles Edward Stuart, the elder son of James VII. The object is variously of English, French, Italian and Dutch origin, was altered several times, and measures by .Piacenti and Boardman, pp. 237‚Äì238. The Collar and the Great George of the Order of the Garter consist of an enamelled gold figure of Saint George, the patron saint of England, slaying a dragon made for Charles II in 1661 suspended from a gold collar made in 1685. The George is set with 122 diamonds and measures by . The saint's cloak and a large suspension loop are both missing. The collar is long and has 26 alternating knots and enamelled badges, each with a tudor rose in the centre.Piacenti and Boardman, pp. 218‚Äì221. The Ruby Ring was probably used at the English coronations of Charles I and Charles II, and certainly that of James (known in England as James II). It has a large ruby etched with a St George's Cross and bordered by 26 diamonds applied in the 19th century.Piacenti and Boardman, pp. 199‚Äì200. =Lorne Jewels= Queen Victoria's fourth daughter Princess Louise, Duchess of Argyll, died in 1939 and left a necklace, locket, and pendant to the nation of Scotland. The London-made jewellery was a gift to Louise from her husband the Marquis of Lorne (later the Duke of Argyll) in 1871. The necklace contains 190 diamonds and 13 pearls; it suspends the locket, consisting of a large pearl surrounded by 30 diamonds; from which hangs the pear-shaped pendant, set with diamonds, emeralds and sapphires, having a relief depiction of the Galley of Lorne and the motto of Dukes of Argyll: NE OBLIVISCARIS, meaning \\"do not forget\\".Burnett and Tabraham, p. 55. Commissioners for the Keeping of the Regalia Under the terms of a Royal Warrant of 1818, the holders of four of the Great Offices of State in Scotland, the Lord Justice Clerk, the Lord Advocate, the Keeper of the Great Seal of Scotland, (The First Minister of Scotland), and the Lord Clerk Register, are ex-officio Commissioners for the Keeping of the Regalia. The warrant gave the keepers the power to appoint a deputy-keeper and Yeoman- keepers. Accordingly on 8 December 1818 Captain Adam Ferguson was appointed.Description of the Regalia, Sir Walter Scott 1824 p.30The Peerage of Scotland 1834 p.32 Since 1996, the commissioners have also been empowered by another Royal Warrant for the safekeeping of the Stone of Scone and for the arrangement of its return to Westminster Abbey for the next British coronation.

Written by Samuel A. Peeples and directed by James Goldstone, it first aired on September 22, 1966. In the episode, after the Enterprise attempts to cross the Great Barrier at the edge of the galaxy, two crew members develop powerful ESP abilities which threaten the safety of the crew. The episode was the second pilot, produced in 1965 after the first pilot, \\"The Cage\\", was rejected by NBC. Reportedly, Lucille Ball, who owned Desilu Productions (where the pilot was produced), persuaded NBC management to consider a second pilot, thereby exercising a special option agreement it had with Desilu, because she liked Gene Roddenberry and believed in the project. The episode was eventually broadcast third in sequence, and it was the first episode to be shown in the United Kingdom by the BBC on July 12, 1969. \\"Where No Man Has Gone Before\\" was the first episode of Star Trek to feature William Shatner as Captain James Kirk, James Doohan as Chief Engineer Montgomery Scott, and George Takei as Lt. Sulu (in this episode, the ship's physicist, whose character became helmsman in subsequent episodes). The episode title is the final phrase in the opening voice-over which characterizes the series and has entered popular culture. Plot The USS Enterprise is on an exploratory mission to leave the galaxy. En route, a damaged ship's recorder of the SS Valiant, an Earth spaceship lost 200 years earlier, is found. Its record is incomplete, but it reveals that the Valiant had been swept from its path by a \\"magnetic space storm,\\" and that the crew had frantically searched for information about extrasensory perception (ESP) in the ship's library computer. The recording ends with the captain of the Valiant apparently giving a self-destruct order. Captain Kirk decides that they need to know what happened to the Valiant, and the Enterprise crosses the edge of the galaxy. There, it encounters a strange barrier which damages the ship's systems and warp drive, forcing a retreat. At the same time, nine crew members are killed and both helmsman Gary Mitchell (Gary Lockwood) and the ship's psychiatrist Dr. Elizabeth Dehner (Sally Kellerman) are knocked unconscious by the barrier's effect. When he awakens, Mitchell's eyes glow silver, and he begins to display remarkable psychic powers. Mitchell becomes increasingly arrogant and hostile toward the rest of the crew, declaring that he has become godlike, enforcing his desires with fearsome displays of telepathic and telekinetic power. Science Officer Spock comes to believe that the Valiant crew members may have experienced the same phenomenon, and destroyed the ship to keep the power from spreading. He advises Kirk that Mitchell may have to be killed before his powers develop further, but Kirk angrily disagrees. Alarmed that Mitchell may take over the Enterprise, Kirk decides to maroon him at an unmanned lithium-cracking facility on the remote planet of Delta Vega. Once there, the landing party tries to confine Mitchell, but his powers have become too great. He kills navigator Lt. Kelso and escapes by knocking out Kirk and Spock, taking with him Dr. Dehner, who has now developed similar powers. Kirk follows and appeals to Dr. Dehner's humanity for help. Before Mitchell can kill Kirk, the doctor attacks and weakens him. Mitchell fatally injures Dehner, but before he can recover from the effort, Kirk uses a phaser rifle to create a rock slide, killing Mitchell. Back on the Enterprise, Kirk makes a log entry that both Dehner and Mitchell gave their lives \\"in performance of duty\\". He explains to Spock that he wants his friend's service record to end positively: \\"He didn't ask for what happened to him.\\" Production and casting The original pilot of Star Trek, \\"The Cage\\", was rejected in February 1965 by NBC executives. The show had been sold to them as a \\"Wagon Train to the stars\\", and they thought the first pilot did not match the adventure format they had been promised and was \\"too cerebral\\" for the general audience. However, NBC, having been persuaded by Desilu management (and reportedly by Lucille Ball herself), maintained sufficient interest in the format to order a second pilot episode in March 1965. Roddenberry wrote two story outlines, \\"The Omega Glory\\" and \\"Mudd's Women.\\" He wrote the teleplay for the former and gave the latter to Stephen Kandel. Roddenberry asked long-time associate and veteran scriptwriter Samuel Peeples to submit ideas for another. Peeples came up with the premise and episode title for \\"Where No Man Has Gone Before,\\" and was assigned to write it. Roddenberry rewrote Peeples's script several times and while he enjoyed working with Roddenberry, after seeing the pilot Peeples preferred his original version of the script. There was some discussion over who came up with the title \\"Where no man has gone before\\", Peeples stated unequivocally it was his idea not Roddenberry's. Kandel had fallen ill and his script was not finished in time; the other two were submitted to NBC for consideration. NBC preferred \\"Where No Man Has Gone Before\\" as a pilot. \\"Mudd's Women\\" was later made as the second episode in regular production, and \\"The Omega Glory\\" was made towards the end of the second season. Casting took place in June 1965. Jeffrey Hunter was unwilling to reprise his role as Captain Christopher Pike. Lloyd Bridges and Jack Lord were considered, but William Shatner was finally cast as Pike's replacement, Captain James Kirk.https://metv.com/lists/15-actors-who-were- almost-cast-on-star-trek-the-original-series The character of Number One, the female second-in-command, was dropped on the insistence of the NBC network, and Science Officer Spock was given Number One's unemotional demeanor. NBC was worried about Leonard Nimoy's \\"satanic\\" appearance and pressured for his removal. As Roddenberry later explained at conventions, he felt he had a strong enough negotiating position to save one character, but not both. Roddenberry went on to muse that, had he done it the other way around, he could not have then married the losing actor (Majel Hudec, who changed her surname to Barrett and returned in the role of Christine Chapel). Apart from Captain Kirk, the episode introduced two other regular characters to the show: James Doohan, a friend of director James Goldstone, was cast as the Chief Engineer Montgomery Scott (the name chosen after Doohan had tried various accents, and had decided that an engineer ought to be Scottish)https://www.metv.com/lists/8-things-you-didnt-know-about-james-doohan and George Takei was cast as the ship's Physicist Sulu, who would become the helmsman in the regular series. Lieutenant Uhura and Dr. Leonard McCoy do not feature; the ship's doctor is instead Mark Piper (Paul Fix), who lost the role to DeForest Kelley.https://www.riflemanconnors.com/paul_fix.htm Gary Lockwood, as Lt. Commander Gary Mitchell, had starred in the title role of Roddenberry's earlier series on NBC, The Lieutenant; Sally Kellerman was cast as Dr. Elizabeth Dehner. Both actors needed silver eyes and scleral lenses were called for, which were produced by expert contact lens fabricator, John Roberts, who laminated wrinkled tinfoil between layers of the scleral lenses which covered the entire eye. These, outdated by the 1960s, could be painful, perhaps dangerous to the actors' eyes (modern scleral lenses can \\"breathe\\" and are oxygen permeable). Although Kellerman could insert and remove the prosthetics easily with no discomfort, Lockwood found them difficult to see through. He needed to raise his face and sight along his nose in order to see through tiny holes in the foil. He was able to use this to enhance his performance as the mutating Mitchell, the unusual gaze giving him an arrogant and haughty demeanor. Other cast members included Paul Carr as Navigator Lee Kelso, Lloyd Haynes as Communications Officer Alden and Andrea Dromm as Yeoman Smith (Alden and Smith were intended to be regulars in the show, but were replaced by Uhura and Janice Rand, respectively). The episode also is the first time long-running background actor Eddie Paskey appeared; his character would later be identified as Lt. Leslie. The costumes from the first pilot were used in \\"Where No Man Has Gone Before\\" with the exception of the insignias in two respects - the outlines were gold in the first pilot but black in the second, and the insignia symbols for engineering and sciences were reversed for the series proper. Completely new uniforms and insignia would be unveiled when the series was green-lighted, with the colors altered and black collars introduced. Most of the Enterprise sets were also reused from \\"The Cage\\", while Sickbay was the only major set constructed for the episode. Like \\"The Cage\\", the episode was shot at Desilu's Culver City studios.Where No Man Has Gone Before. DVD technical commentary (Okuda, Michael and Denise). The episode was directed by James Goldstone. He was hired primarily to get his opinion on which of the first three scripts should be the second pilot. While his best friend Stephen Kandel wrote \\"Mudd's Women\\", Goldstone agreed \\"Where no man has gone before\\" was the right choice. Ernest Haller, who had won the Oscar for Best Color Cinematography on the movie Gone with the Wind (1939), served as director of photography for the episode. He had been brought in out of semi-retirement at Goldstone's recommendation at the last minute, after attempts to locate a cameraman had proved problematic.http://www.cinematographers.nl/GreatDoPh/haller.htm -Note:this could be circular Robert H. Justman was credited as assistant director. Shooting started on July 19, 1965, several days later than originally scheduled. During the filming of this episode, a wasp's nest high in the rafters of the studio was somehow disturbed, and many cast and crew members suffered stings as a result. As this happened on a Friday, the weekend break allowed time for the swelling to go down; Shatner, however, required additional makeup to hide the stings during shooting the following Monday. Filming finished late on July 28, 1965; the final footage filmed was part of the fight between Kirk and Mitchell. While the schedule allowed seven days to shoot the episode, it required nine, which was Justman's original estimate. The episode cost around $300,000, around half the money spent on making \\"The Cage\\". In a 1988 TV special, The Star Trek Saga: From One Generation to the Next, series creator Gene Roddenberry said that, as with the first pilot, this one still had a lot of science-fiction elements in it, but at least it ended with Kirk in a bare-knuckle fistfight with Mitchell and that's what sold NBC on Star Trek.http://theomegasector.com/index.php?/topic/19295-the-star-trek- saga-from-one-generation-to-the-next-hosted-by-patrick-stewart/ Original cut Post-production on the episode was delayed by Roddenberry's involvement in another pilot, Police Story. Post-production finished in January 1966 and the episode was presented to NBC for approval (which finally came in February 1966). This original version (production number 02a) differed from the later final broadcast cut (production number 02b, airing on September 22, 1966) in that each of the four acts had on-screen titles (\\"Act I\\", \\"Act II\\", etc.), as well as an epilogue. It also featured a much longer opening narration by Shatner. In some places alternate musical scores were used. In total almost five minutes of footage was removed to accommodate the original series' 50-minute network broadcast format to allow for commercials. The episode in its original version was seen by the public before the aired version, having been shown at the 24th World Science Fiction Convention in Cleveland, Ohio, on September 3, 1966‚Äîshortly before the premiere broadcast of Star Trek on NBC.https://www.wired.com/2016/09/imagining-a-world-without-star-trek/ The studio did not retain a print of this original version, and it was officially thought to be lost. In 2009, a German film collector discovered a print of it and brought it to the attention of CBS/Paramount, which then released it under the title \\"Where No Fan Has Gone Before\\" ‚Äì The Restored, Unaired Alternate Pilot Episode as part of the TOS season 3 box set on Blu- ray.https://trekmovie.com/2009/11/12/more-details-on-alternative-version-of- where-no-man-has-gone-before-in-tos-season-3-blu-ray-set/  Non-canon related works  The episode was adapted into a short story by James Blish for Star Trek 8, published in 1972.

Reception In 2013, W.I.R.E.D. magazine ranked this episode one of the top ten episodes of the original television series. They note famous lines such as Kirk's plea for compassion, and the absence of series regulars such as Dr. McCoy, Uhura, and Chekov. Zack Handlen of The A.V. Club gave the episode a 'B+' rating, describing it as \\"an awkward episode\\" but that \\"it's not without its charms.\\" In 2016, IGN ranked \\"Where No Man Has Gone Before\\" number six in a top ten list of original series episodes.They also ranked it the 17th best episode of all Star Trek series. In 2018, PopMatters ranked this the 4th best episode of the original series.

This length scale could be, for example, the radius of a body in a fluid. The number is named after Danish physicist Martin Knudsen (1871‚Äì1949). The Knudsen number helps determine whether statistical mechanics or the continuum mechanics formulation of fluid dynamics should be used to model a situation. If the Knudsen number is near or greater than one, the mean free path of a molecule is comparable to a length scale of the problem, and the continuum assumption of fluid mechanics is no longer a good approximation. In such cases, statistical methods should be used. Definition The Knudsen number is a dimensionless number defined as :\\\\mathrm{Kn}\\\\ = \\\\frac {\\\\lambda}{L}, where : \\\\lambda = mean free path [L1], : L = representative physical length scale [L1]. The representative length scale considered, L, may correspond to various physical traits of a system, but most commonly relates to a gap length over which thermal transport or mass transport occurs through a gas phase. This is the case in porous and granular materials, where the thermal transport through a gas phase depends highly on its pressure and the consequent mean free path of molecules in this phase. For a Boltzmann gas, the mean free path may be readily calculated, so that :\\\\mathrm{Kn}\\\\ = \\\\frac {k_\\\\text{B} T}{\\\\sqrt{2}\\\\pi d^2 p L}, where : k_\\\\text{B} is the Boltzmann constant (1.380649 √ó 10‚àí23 J/K in SI units) [M1 L2 T‚àí2 Œ∏‚àí1], : T is the thermodynamic temperature [Œ∏1], : d is the particle hard-shell diameter [L1], : p is the total pressure [M1 L‚àí1 T‚àí2]. For particle dynamics in the atmosphere, and assuming standard temperature and pressure, i.e. 0 ¬∞C and 1 atm, we have \\\\lambda ‚âà (80 nm). Relationship to Mach and Reynolds numbers in gases The Knudsen number can be related to the Mach number and the Reynolds number. Using the dynamic viscosity :\\\\mu = \\\\frac{1}{2}\\\\rho \\\\bar{c} \\\\lambda, with the average molecule speed (from Maxwell‚ÄìBoltzmann distribution) :\\\\bar{c} = \\\\sqrt{\\\\frac{8 k_\\\\text{B} T}{\\\\pi m}}, the [mean free path] is determined as follows: :\\\\lambda = \\\\frac{\\\\mu}{\\\\rho} \\\\sqrt{\\\\frac{\\\\pi m}{2 k_\\\\text{B} T}}. Dividing through by L (some characteristic length), the Knudsen number is obtained: : \\\\mathrm{Kn}\\\\ = \\\\frac{\\\\lambda}{L} = \\\\frac{\\\\mu}{\\\\rho L} \\\\sqrt{\\\\frac{\\\\pi m}{2 k_\\\\text{B} T}}, where : \\\\bar{c} is the average molecular speed from the Maxwell‚ÄìBoltzmann distribution [L1 T‚àí1], : T is the thermodynamic temperature [Œ∏1], : Œº is the dynamic viscosity [M1 L‚àí1 T‚àí1], : m is the molecular mass [M1], : kB is the Boltzmann constant [M1 L2 T‚àí2 Œ∏‚àí1], : œÅ is the density [M1 L‚àí3]. The dimensionless Mach number can be written as :\\\\mathrm{Ma} = \\\\frac {U_\\\\infty}{c_\\\\text{s}}, where the speed of sound is given by :c_\\\\text{s} = \\\\sqrt{\\\\frac{\\\\gamma R T}{M}} = \\\\sqrt{\\\\frac{\\\\gamma k_\\\\text{B}T}{m}}, where : U‚àû is the freestream speed [L1 T‚àí1], : R is the Universal gas constant (in SI, 8.314 47215 J K‚àí1 mol‚àí1) [M1 L2 T‚àí2 Œ∏‚àí1 mol‚àí1], : M is the molar mass [M1 mol‚àí1], : \\\\gamma is the ratio of specific heats [1]. The dimensionless Reynolds number can be written as :\\\\mathrm{Re} = \\\\frac {\\\\rho U_\\\\infty L}{\\\\mu}. Dividing the Mach number by the Reynolds number: :\\\\frac{\\\\mathrm{Ma}}{\\\\mathrm{Re}} = \\\\frac{U_\\\\infty / c_\\\\text{s}}{\\\\rho U_\\\\infty L / \\\\mu} = \\\\frac{\\\\mu}{\\\\rho L c_\\\\text{s}} = \\\\frac{\\\\mu}{\\\\rho L \\\\sqrt{\\\\frac{\\\\gamma k_\\\\text{B} T}{m}}} = \\\\frac{\\\\mu}{\\\\rho L} \\\\sqrt{\\\\frac{m}{\\\\gamma k_\\\\text{B} T}} and by multiplying by \\\\sqrt{\\\\frac{\\\\gamma \\\\pi}{2}} yields the Knudsen number: :\\\\frac{\\\\mu}{\\\\rho L} \\\\sqrt{\\\\frac{m}{\\\\gamma k_\\\\text{B}T}} \\\\sqrt{\\\\frac{\\\\gamma \\\\pi}{2}} = \\\\frac{\\\\mu}{\\\\rho L} \\\\sqrt{\\\\frac{\\\\pi m}{2k_\\\\text{B} T}} = \\\\mathrm{Kn}. The Mach, Reynolds and Knudsen numbers are therefore related by :\\\\mathrm{Kn}\\\\ = \\\\frac{\\\\mathrm{Ma}}{\\\\mathrm{Re}} \\\\sqrt{\\\\frac{\\\\gamma \\\\pi}{2}}. Application The Knudsen number can be used to determine the rarefaction of a flow : * \\\\mathrm{Kn} < 0.01 : Continuum flow * 0.01 < \\\\mathrm{Kn} < 0.1 : Slip flow * 0.1 < \\\\mathrm{Kn} < 10 : Transitional flow * \\\\mathrm{Kn} > 10 : Free-molecular flow , Appendix N, page 434 This regime classification is empirical and problem dependent but has proven useful to adequately model flows . Problems with high Knudsen numbers include the calculation of the motion of a dust particle through the lower atmosphere and the motion of a satellite through the exosphere. One of the most widely used applications for the Knudsen number is in microfluidics and MEMS device design where flows range from continuum to free-molecular . Movements of fluids in situations with a high Knudsen number are said to exhibit Knudsen flow, also called free molecular flow. Airflow around an aircraft such as an airliner has a low Knudsen number, making it firmly in the realm of continuum mechanics. Using the Knudsen number an adjustment for Stokes' law can be used in the Cunningham correction factor, this is a drag force correction due to slip in small particles (i.e. dp < 5 Œºm). The flow of water through a nozzle will usually be a situation with a low Knudsen number. Mixtures of gases with different molecular masses can be partly separated by sending the mixture through small holes of a thin wall because the numbers of molecules that pass through a hole is proportional to the pressure of the gas and inversely proportional to its molecular mass. The technique has been used to separate isotopic mixtures, such as uranium, using porous membranes, It has also been successfully demonstrated for use in hydrogen production from water. The Knudsen number also plays an important role in thermal conduction in gases. For insulation materials, for example, where gases are contained under low pressure, the Knudsen number should be as high as possible to ensure low thermal conductivity.

Its functioning principle is damping the chopping motion of the boats bow with a ski-like device attached to the bow through a car shock absorber. When a small boat is equipped with a powerful motor, the attendant thrust will generally be sufficient to lift most of the hull above the water's surface and even minimal waves will often cause a harmonically amplified chopping motion of the bow. This represents a significant obstacle to the forward motion of the boat, but is also part and parcel of the image many boat buyers aspire to, when choosing the particular configuration. A boat equipped with a boat ski will move much more smoothly, swiftly and fuel efficiently, but looks slightly ridiculous, and not at all in accord with the image the majority of buyers were looking for when plumping for a light hull and overpowered motor, instead of more steady alternatives. As was characteristic of many other of Spede Pasanen's inventions, the functioning of the invention was immaculate, but imagewise, it was less than plausible.

In the National Museum of Anthropology, Mexico City Chinkultic, sometimes Chincultic, is a moderate-size archeological ruin in the state of Chiapas, Mexico. It is part of the Lagunas de Montebello National Park. This pre- Columbian city belongs to the ancient Maya civilization. The city flourished in the Maya Classic Era, from about the 3rd through the 9th century. Most of the sculptures were produced in the last 300 years of this era, with hieroglyphic inscriptions dating from 591 to 897. Post-Classic-Era occupation of the site continued until the 13th century, after which it was abandoned. The site has some step-pyramids and some 200 smaller buildings, most in undisturbed ruin. Chinkultic has carved stone stelae depicting the site's rulers. The site contains a court for playing the Mesoamerican ballgame, which a marker tells us was dedicated on 21 May 591. The first published account of the site was made by Edward Seler in the late 19th century. A detailed description of the site was made by Enrique Juan Palacios in 1926. The first archeological investigations of the site were conducted in 1966 under the direction of Stephan F. de Borhegyi of the Public Museum of Milwaukee, Wisconsin. Starting in 1970, some further excavations and restorations of a few buildings was conducted by Mexican government archeologists, who also dredged some artifacts from the site's cenote or natural well known as Agua Azul (\\"Blue Water\\"). The cenote gives the site its Maya language name; Chinkultic meaning \\"stepped-cenote\\". The site is open for tourism visits, although it is not one of the more commonly visited Maya sites.
