Originally a violist, he played among the violas of the Bluthner Orchestra of Berlin while still in his teens. He conducted in Riga from 1914 to 1916 and in K√∂nigsberg from 1928 to 1933, after which he left Germany in protest at the Nazi regime and worked in Switzerland. Along with the philanthropist Werner Reinhart, Scherchen played a leading role in shaping the musical life of Winterthur for many years, with numerous premiere performances, the emphasis being placed on contemporary music. From 1922 to 1950 he was the principal conductor of the city orchestra Winterthur (today known as Orchester Musikkollegium Winterthur).The Musikkollegium Winterthur Orchestra Making his debut with Schoenberg's Pierrot Lunaire, he was a champion of 20th-century composers such as Richard Strauss, Anton Webern, Alban Berg and Edgard Var√®se, and actively promoted the work of younger contemporary composers including Iannis Xenakis, Luigi Nono and Leon Schidlowsky. He was the teacher of Karel Anƒçerl, Egisto Macchi, Marc B√©langer, Fran√ßoys Bernier, Frieda Belinfante and Karl Amadeus Hartmann, and contributed to the libretto of Hartmann's opera Simplicius Simplicissimus. He also premiered Hartmann's early work Miserae. Conductor Francis Travis was a pupil, then conducting assistant, for five years. He is probably best known for his orchestral arrangement (and recording) of Bach's The Art of Fugue. His 1953 \\"Lehrbuch des Dirigierens\\" (Treatise on Conducting, ) is a standard textbook. His recorded repertoire was extremely wide, ranging from Vivaldi to Reinhold Gli√®re. Like Vasily Safonov and (in later life) Leopold Stokowski, Scherchen commonly avoided the use of a baton. His technique when in this mode sometimes caused problems for players; an unidentified BBC Symphony Orchestra bassoonist told the singer Ian Wallace that interpreting Scherchen's minuscule hand movements was like trying to milk a flying gnat.Story told by Wallace during the BBC radio panel game My Music, 1993 According to Fritz Spiegl,Spiegl, Fritz: Music Through the Looking Glass (London, 1984) Scherchen worked largely through verbal instructions to his players and his scores were peppered with reminders of what he needed to say at each critical point in the music. However, Scherchen did not always dispense with the baton. The film of his rehearsal of his edition of Bach's The Art of Fugue with the CBC Toronto Chamber Orchestra shows him using a baton throughout, and very effectively. Family His first wife - who was also his third wife - was Auguste Marie (Gustl) Jansen, whom he married on June 17, 1921. After a brief marriage to actress Gerda M√ºller 1927-1929, he was again together with Gustl Jansen. In 1936 Scherchen married Chinese composer Xiao Shuxian in Peking. A daughter, Tona Scherchen, was born to them in 1938. She has also made a name for herself as a composer. The last of his five wives was the Zurich-based Romanian mathematics teacher Pia Andronescu,Hermann Scherchen, 1891-1966, Issue 177, Hansj√∂rg Pauli Kommissionsverlag Hug, 1993 - Biography & Autobiography with whom he had 5 children: Myriam, David, Esther, Nathan and Alexandra. He died in Florence, survived by a number of children, from five wives and other women.Michael H. Kater, The Twisted Muse One his sons was Karl Hermann \\"Wulff\\" Scherchen. Wulff met Benjamin Britten when they were thirteen (nearly fourteen) and twenty, respectively. Their romantic relationship did not begin until four years later. John Bridcut describes the passionate exchanges of letters between the increasingly-famous composer and the teenager in Britten's Children. Wulff's relationship with Britten is also the subject of Serenade for Tenor, Saxophone and Orchestra, a song cycle by Lyle Chan based on the romantic letters exchanged by the pair. Until 2014, his daughter, Myriam Scherchen, co-ran the music label Tahra, which released officially authorized historical recordings of conductors such as Scherchen, Furtw√§ngler, Mengelberg and others, generally drawn from primary recorded sources. Tahra ceased business after the death of the co-principal of the label, Ren√© Tr√©mine. The sister of Auguste Maria Jansen, Helen (Lene) Jansen, was married to the Hungarian cartographer Alexander Rad√≥, who, under the alias ‚ÄòDora', was a member of the european-wide resistance organization known as the \\"Rote Kapelle\\". When Rad√≥ was threatened in Switzerland by German security agents and faced eviction, Hermann Scherchen hid him in his apartment in Geneva. Quote * \\"Music does not have to be understood. It has to be listened to.\\" Recordings Scherchen recorded an unusually wide range of repertoire, from the baroque to the contemporary. His Mahler recordings, made before Mahler became a part of the standard repertoire, were especially influential; so too were his recordings of Bach and Handel, which helped pave the way for the period-performance practice movement. Included as well were significant recordings of music by Haydn, Beethoven, Berlioz, Tchaikovsky, Gli√®re, Bart√≥k, Schoenberg and many others. In 1960 Hermann Scherchen recorded works by Max Reger with alto Margarethe Bence and the Nordwestdeutsche Philharmonie, including Eine Lustspielouvert√ºre (A Comedy Overture), Serenade for orchestra, Romantic Suite for orchestra, \\"An die Hoffnung\\", Variations and Fugue on a Theme of Beethoven and Variations and Fugue on a Theme by Mozart. In 1996 Tahra published the only commercially released recording of Malipiero's complete L'Orfeide. It was a remastered live recording of the 7 June 1966 performance at the Teatro della Pergola in Florence, conducted by Scherchen only five days before his death. The cast included Magda Olivero and Renato Capecchi (Tah 190/191).Manfriani, Franco, Mito e contemporaneit√†, Edizioni Pendragon, 2007, pp. 35-36.  Notes  * J.S. Bach - Art of Fugue.

(It is called \\"ikili\\" in Western Mongolia). The neck and lute-shaped sound box are usually made of a solid piece of pine or larch. The top of the sound box may be covered with skin or a thin wooden plate. The strings, and those of the bow, are traditionally made of hair from a horse's tail (strung parallel), but may also be made of nylon. Like the morin khuur of Mongolia, the igil typically features a carved horse's head at the top of the neck above the tuning pegs, and both instruments are known as the horsehead fiddle. The igil is held nearly upright when played, with the sound box of the instrument in the performer's lap, or braced against the top of the performer's boot. Playing technique involves touching the strings with the nails or fingertips, but without pressing them to the neck. The igil has no frets. The bow is held with an underhand grip. The igil formerly had an entire genre dedicated to it, with a repertoire of songs meant to be performed only on the igil. During the communist period in Tuva attempts were made to \\"modernize\\" the igil. This was nothing more than an attempt to westernize the instrument making it more like the European cello. However the instruments and playing style used by most Tuvan musicians today are largely the same as the original form of the igil. Famous players of the igil include Ak-ool Kara-sal, Andrei Chuldum-ool, Kaigal-ool Khovalyg, Igor Koshkendei, Mongun-ool Ondar, Aldar Tamdyn, Radik Tulush and Evgenii Saryglar.

E. Madryga. It was designed to be easy and efficient for implementation in software. Serious weaknesses have since been found in the algorithm, but it was one of the first encryption algorithms to make use of data-dependent rotations, later used in other ciphers, such as RC5 and RC6. In his proposal, Madryga set forth twelve design objectives that are generally considered to be good goals in the design of a block cipher. DES had already fulfilled nine of them. The three that DES did not fulfill were: # Any possible key should produce a strong cipher. (Meaning no weak keys, which DES has.) # The length of the key and the text should be adjustable to meet varying security requirements. # The algorithm should be efficiently implementable in software on large mainframes, minicomputers, and microcomputers, and in discrete logic. (DES has a large amount of bitwise permutations, which are inefficient in software implementations.) The algorithm Madryga met the objective of being efficient in software: the only operations it uses are XOR and rotations, both operating only on whole bytes. Madryga has a variable-length key, with no upper limit on its length. Madryga is specified with eight rounds, but this can be increased to provide more security if need be. In each round, the algorithm passes over the entire plaintext n times, where n is the length of the plaintext in bytes. The algorithm looks at three bytes at a time, so Madryga is a 24-bit block cipher. It XORs a key byte with the rightmost byte, and rotates the other two as one block. The rotation varies with the output of the XOR. Then, the algorithm moves to the right by one byte. So if it were working on bytes 2, 3 and 4, after it finished rotating and XORing them, it would repeat the process on bytes 3, 4 and 5. The key schedule is very simple. To start with, the entire key is XORed with a random constant of the same length as the key, then rotated to the left by 3 bits. It is rotated again after each iteration of rotation and XOR. The rightmost byte of it is used in each iteration to XOR with the rightmost byte of the data block. The decryption algorithm is simply the reverse of the encryption algorithm. Due to the nature of the XOR operation, it is reversible. Cryptanalysis At a glance, Madryga seems less secure than, for example, DES. All of Madryga's operations are linear. DES's S-boxes are its only non-linear component, and flaws in them are what both differential cryptanalysis and linear cryptanalysis seek to exploit. While Madryga's rotations are data-dependent to a small degree, they are still linear. Perhaps Madryga's fatal flaw is that it does not exhibit the avalanche effect. Its small data block is to blame for this. One byte can only influence the two bytes to its left and the one byte to its right. Eli Biham has reviewed the algorithm without making a formal analysis. He noticed that \\"the parity of all the bits of the plaintext and the ciphertext is a constant, depending only on the key. So, if you have one plaintext and its corresponding ciphertext, you can predict the parity of the ciphertext for any plaintext.\\" Here, parity refers to the XOR sum of all the bits. In 1995, Ken Shirriff found a differential attack on Madryga that requires 5,000 chosen plaintexts. Unpublished manuscript. Biryukov and Kushilevitz (1998) published an improved differential attack requiring only 16 chosen-plaintext pairs, and then demonstrated that it could be converted to a ciphertext-only attack using 212 ciphertexts, under reasonable assumptions about the redundancy of the plaintext (for example, ASCII-encoded English language). A ciphertext-only attack is devastating for a modern block cipher; as such, it is probably more prudent to use another algorithm for encrypting sensitive data. References=Further reading= * W. E.

The plot involves the creation of an alternative historical time line, one where Adolf Hitler never existed. While most of the book is written in standard prose, a couple of chapters are written in the format of a screenplay. The book won the Sidewise Award for Alternate History. Plot =Changing history= The story is told in first person by Michael \\"Puppy\\" Young, a young history student at Cambridge University on the verge of completing his doctoral thesis on the early life of Adolf Hitler and his mother. He meets Professor Leo Zuckerman, a physicist who has a strong personal interest in Hitler, the rise of Nazism and the Holocaust. Michael assumes this is due to his Jewish heritage. However, it is later revealed that Leo was born Axel Bauer, the son of Dietrich Bauer, a Nazi doctor at Auschwitz who - when the Nazi defeat became certain - gave his son the identity of a Jewish doctor that he murdered. Leo has developed a machine that enables the past to be viewed‚Äîbut it is of no practical use as the image is not resolvable into details. Together, they hatch a plan to modify the machine such that it can be used to send something back into time. They decide to use a permanent male contraceptive pill, stolen from Michael's girlfriend (a biochemistry researcher), who, due to his continual distraction, has left him to take a position at Princeton University. They decide to send this pill back in time to the well in Braunau am Inn so that Hitler's father will drink from it, become infertile, and Hitler will never be born. =Consequences= When Michael awakens he is completely disoriented. He soon discovers that he is in the United States, at Princeton University. Everyone he encounters is surprised that he is speaking with an English accent. It takes some time for Michael's memory to return. He realises that his plan was successful, history has changed, and for some reason his parents must have moved to America. Initially he is elated and tells his new friend Steve how happy he is because Steve has never heard of Hitler, Braunau am Inn, or the Nazi Party. Steve corrects Michael and reveals that, while never hearing of Hitler, he is all too well aware of the Nazi Party. Michael begins to discover the history of this new world. It turns out that without Hitler, a new leader emerged, Rudolf Gloder, who was equally ruthless. In fact, Michael and Zuckerman have replaced Hitler with a Nazi leader who was even more charming, patient, and effective, and as committed to the Final Solution as Hitler had been. In this alternative timeline, the Nazis won a mandate in the Reichstag in 1932 and built up an electronics industry of their own. Unlike Hitler, Gloder proceeded with stealth, ensuring peaceful unification with Austria in 1937. More alarmingly, Gloder's Nazis also had a head start on the research and development of nuclear weapons, which led to the destruction of Moscow and Leningrad, eliminating Joseph Stalin and his Politburo in this alternative 1938. The Greater German Reich annexes Czechoslovakia, Hungary, Yugoslavia, Poland, and Turkey, and invades the remnants of the former Soviet Union. In 1939, France, the United Kingdom, Scandinavia, and the Benelux nations capitulate, although Britain rebels in 1941, leading to the execution of several dissidents, among them the Duke of York (the historical King George VI) and George Orwell. Jews are exiled to a \\"Jewish Free State\\" within the former Yugoslavia, where most of this world's Holocaust occurs. The United States develops nuclear weapons in 1941, leading to a Cold War between Nazi Germany, its satellites, and the United States. The latter has never gone to war against the Japanese Empire in the Pacific. As a result, this United States has become far more socially conservative. Because there was no sixties upsurge of social liberalism and decriminalisation of homosexuality in (Nazi- occupied) Western Europe in this world, the latter is still a felony, while racial segregation is still active. Students at Princeton are purely white, the only blacks on campus being manual workers - and students feel free to harass them and call them \\"nigger\\". Steve turns out to be homosexual, and when he discovers Michael's background, he marvels at his talk of gay pride marches, urban gay communities, and a mass social movement in Michael's world of origin, regarding it as \\"utopian\\". Much to his own surprise, Michael reciprocates Steve's feelings. Michael is apprehended by the authorities, who believe that he is a possible spy - since Britain had been under Nazi rule for nearly half a century, anyone speaking like a Briton is suspect. Michael learns that the water from the well in Hitler's home town was used to create \\"Braunau Water\\", which was the instrument to sterilise the European Jews, wiping them out in one generation. In a cruel twist of fate, the person who perfected the synthesis was Dietrich Bauer. Once more his physicist son, Axel, is wracked with guilt and has developed a Temporal Imager. With Michael and Steve's help, they plan to send a dead rat to poison the well so that it will be pumped clean of the sterilising water. As they begin to do this, they are interrupted by the federal agents that apprehended Michael earlier and they end up shooting Steve, who dies in Michael's arms just as the time alteration occurs. =Changing history again= Time changes again. Expecting the disorientation, Michael comes to his senses faster now and discovers that almost everything is back to how it was, except that his favourite band, Oily- Moily, never existed. He gives up his career in academia, figuring he can at least make some money \\"writing\\" the songs that he remembers from the previous reality. Finally, Michael is reunited with Steve, who also remembers the previous reality. Their gay relationship is no longer criminal. =Structure of the book= Every chapter told by the first-person narrator in the (changing) late 20th Century reality is followed by one in the German past. These early such chapters depict Hitler's father, an abusive husband and father and a petty tyrant in his job as a customs inspector; Hitler's mother, a gentle and sensitive woman escaping into fantasy from the harsh reality of her life; the 10-year old Adolf Hitler standing up to his father... Later chapters take place in the trenches of WWI, told from the point of view of Hitler's comrades in arms: ordinary German combat soldiers, completely unaware of the hidden power struggle going on around them between the two potential leaders of the future Nazi Germany - Adolf Hitler and the charismatic officer Rudi Gloder. In one scene, Hitler tricks Gloder into a foolhardy heroic act and getting himself killed; but in the changed history, where Hitler was never born, it is Gloder who tricks another soldier into this act, and gets decorated for recovering his body. Later on, the ruthless Gloder murders a fellow soldier who discovered his opportunist machinations, followed by the past-war scene where Gloder joins the budding Nazi Party in 1919 Munchen and becomes its star demagogue. The significance of some details in these past scenes only becomes clear much later. For example, there is an early scene where Hitler's mother's vomits when trying to draw water and getting out of the pump a stinking maggot-filled mass; this turns out at the book's end to be the result of the protagonist sending back in time the rotting bodies of dead rats in order to prevent Hitler's father from drinking the sterilizing water. Reception Michiko Kakutani of The New York Times found the comic tone of the book \\"shockingly tasteless\\" and \\"deeply offensive\\" given the subject matter.https://www.nytimes.com/1998/04/21/books/books-of-the-times-plotting- to-erase-hitler-from-history.html Israeli researcher Asaf Ben VeredDr. Asaf Ben Vered, \\"Holocaust Literature and Films - Before and After Schindler's List\\" (in Hebrew), Jerusalem 2002, p. 23, 27, 46 noted that \\"The protagonist of Making History gets told that \\"There are no Jews left in Europe\\". That result could not have been achieved solely by sterilizing Jewish men through the \\"Braunau Water\\". In that case, in the 1990s there should have still been a big number of sad old and middle aged Jews with no progeny, and the Nazis could not have kept them completely hidden from the world. Plus, if only Jewish men were sterilized, at least some Jewish women would have let themselves be impregnated by non-Jewish men; in fact, Jewish religious law specifically stipulates that such children would be considered Jewish. (...) Anyway, why would Gloder do it at all? To be sure, he is an anti-semite, like many Germans of his time. But as seen from his cynically frank wartime diary, he is above all a completely ruthless and totally unprincipled opportunist, for whom German Nationalism and wartime heroism are simply tools to be used or discarded. He needed the Jewish nuclear scientists to develop nuclear bombs by 1938. He still needs them when entering a nuclear arms race with the US. Were the Jewish scientists and their families exempted from deportation to the \\"Jewish Free State\\"? Would they go on working for him when all other Jews were deported? (...) The book avoids the real moral dilemma which it could have easily posed and which would have made it a far more profound and thought- provoking work. Suppose the opportunist Gloder had altogether avoided the Final Solution, and contented himself with some anti-Jewish rhetoric. Which world would be worse? Our world - or a world with an entrenched Nazi dictatorship in Europe and a racist and homophobic America, but no gas chambers and ovens, six million Jews able to live out their life, even if under Nazi rule? Putting it this way, the protagonist would have needed at least some serious thinking and inner debate before proceeding as he does in the final chapters.\\" See also *Axis victory in World War II :(There are numerous World War II alternative history texts wherein events during the war occurred differently from those in history.

Kocsis, Applied criminal psychology: a guide to forensic behavioral sciences, Charles C Thomas Publisher, 2009, pp.7 Criminal psychology is related to the field of criminal anthropology. The study goes deeply into what makes someone commit a crime, but also the reactions after the crime, on the run or in court. Criminal psychologists are often called up as witnesses in court cases to help the jury understand the mind of the criminal. Some types of psychiatry also deal with aspects of criminal behavior. Criminal behavior can be stated as ‚ÄúAny kind of antisocial behavior, which is punishable usually by law but can be punished by norms, stated by community,‚Äù therefore, it is difficult to define it as there is a fine line between what could be considered okay and what's considered not to be, being considered as violation at one point of time may now be accepted by community. Psychology's role in the legal system Psychologists are licensed professionals that can assess both mental and physical states. Profilers look for patterns in behavior to typify the individual(s) behind a crime. A group effort attempts to answer the most common psychological questions: If there is a risk of a sexual predator re-offending if put back in society; if an offender is competent to stand trial; whether or not an offender was sane/insane at the time of the offense. Criminal psychologists can be used to do investigative work, like examine photographs of a crime, or conduct an interview with a suspect. They sometimes have to formulate a hypothesis, in order to assess what an offender is going to do next, after they have broken the law. The question of competency to stand trial is a question of an offender's current state of mind. This assesses the offender's ability to understand the charges against them, the possible outcomes of being convicted/acquitted of these charges and their ability to assist their attorney with their defense. The question of sanity/insanity or criminal responsibility is an assessment of the offender's state of mind at the time of the crime. This refers to their ability to understand right from wrong and what is against the law. The insanity defense is rarely used, as it is very difficult to prove. If declared insane, an offender is committed to a secure hospital facility for much longer than they would have served in prison‚Äîtheoretically, that is. Legal psychologists, or known as Criminal psychologists are the ones who make the decisions on offenders. They see if those offenders are a threat to society. The four roles of criminal psychologists In 1981, one of the fathers of UK's criminal psychology ‚Äì Professor Lionel Haward ‚Äì described four ways that psychologist may perform upon being professionally involved in criminal proceedings. These are the following: Clinical: In this situation, the psychologist is involved in assessment of an individual in order to provide a clinical judgment. The psychologist can use assessment tools, interview or psychometric tools in order to aid in his/her assessment. These assessments can help police or other comparable organizations to determine how to process the individual in question. For example, help finding out whether he/she is capable to stand trial or whether the individual has mental illness which relates to whether he/she is able or unable to understand the proceedings. Experimental: In this case, the task of the psychologist is to perform research in order to inform a case. This can involve executing experimental tests for the purposes of illustrating a point or providing further information to courts. This may involve false memory, eyewitness credibility experiments and such. For example, this way questions similar to ‚Äúhow likely would a witness see an object in 100 meters?‚Äù could be answered. Actuarial: This role involves usage of statistics in order to inform a case. For example, a psychologist may be asked to provide probability of an event occurring. For example, the courts may ask how likely it is that a person will reoffend if a sentence is declined. Advisory: Here, a psychologist may advise police about how to proceed with the investigation. For example, which is the best way to interview the individual, how best to cross-examine a vulnerable or another expert witness, how an offender will act after committing the offense. Profiling A major part of criminal psychology, known as criminal profiling, began in the 1940s when the United States Office of Strategic Services asked William L. Langer's brother Walter C. Langer, a well renowned psychiatrist, to draw up a profile of Adolf Hitler. After the Second World War, British psychologist Lionel Haward, while working for the Royal Air Force police, drew up a list of characteristics which high-ranking war criminals might display, to be able to spot them amongst ordinary captured soldiers and airmen. A renowned Italian Psychologist Cesare Lombroso (1835-1909) was thought to be one of the first criminologists to attempt to formally classify criminals based on age, sex, physical characteristics, education, and geographic region. When comparing these similar characteristics, he better understood the origin of motivation of criminal behavior, and in 1876, he published his book called The Criminal Man. Lombroso studied 383 Italian inmates. Based on his studies, he suggested that there were three types of criminals. There were born criminals, who were degenerates and insane criminals, who suffered from a mental illness. Also, he studied and found specific physical characteristics. A few examples included asymmetry of the face, eye defects and peculiarities, and ears of unusual size, etc. In the 1950s, US psychiatrist James A. Brussel drew up what turned to be an uncannily accurate profile of a bomber who had been terrorizing New York City. It was first introduced to the FBI in the 1960s when several classes were taught to the American Society of crime lab directors. Most of the public at that time knew little if not anything about how profilers would profile people until TV came into play. Later films based on the fictional works of author Thomas Harris that caught the public eye as a profession in particular Manhunter (1986) and Silence of the Lambs (1991). The fastest development occurred when the FBI opened its training academy, the Behavioral Analysis Unit (BAU), in Quantico, Virginia. It led to the establishment of the National Center for the Analysis of Violent Crime and the violent criminal apprehension program. The idea was to have a system which could pick up links between unsolved major crimes. In the United Kingdom, Professor David Canter was a pioneer helping to guide police detectives from the mid-1980s to an offender who had carried out a series of serious attacks, but Canter saw the limitations of \\"offender profiling\\" - in particular, the subjective, personal opinion of a psychologist. He and a colleague coined the term investigative psychology and began trying to approach the subject from what they saw as a more scientific point of view. Criminal profiling, also known as offender profiling, is the process of linking an offender's actions at the crime scene to their most likely characteristics to help police investigators narrow down and prioritize a pool of most likely suspects. Profiling is a relatively new area of forensic psychology that during the past 20 years has developed from what used to be described as an art to a rigorous science. Part of a sub-field of forensic psychology called investigative psychology, criminal profiling is based on increasingly rigorous methodological advances and empirical research. Criminal profiling is a process now known in the Federal Bureau of Investigation (FBI) as criminal investigative analysis. Profilers, or criminal investigative analysts, are trained and experienced law enforcement officers who study every behavioral aspect and detail of an unsolved violent crime scene in which a certain amount of psychopathology has been left at the scene. The characteristics of a good profiler are discussed. Five behavioral characteristics that can be gleaned from the crime scene are described: 1) amount of planning that went into the crime, 2) degree of control used by the offender, 3) escalation of emotion at the scene, 4) risk level of both the offender and victim, and 5) appearance of the crime scene (disorganized versus organized). The process of interpreting the behavior observed at a crime scene is briefly discussed. Criminal Psychologist have to consider profiling from a racial content. Race plays big parts into our criminal justice systems. Over the years, federal and state prisons in the United States held 475,900 inmates who were black and 436,500 who were white, giving a difference of 39,400. Many police, throw many blacks in prisons because of stereotypes. The stereotyping of Blacks as criminals throughout society, that ‚Äúcriminal predator‚Äù is used as a substitute for ‚Äúyoung Black male.‚Äù This common stereotype has incorrectly served as a abstruse reasoning for the unofficial policy and practice of racial profiling by criminal justice practitioners. Many psychologist look over these stereotypes because race doesn't make you violent or a threat to society. The cultural, environmental and traditional concepts of every race plays a big part in psychology, to see the background or why was these crimes were committed. Some races don't have equal opportunities as others, so certain people choose different paths. They also evaluate if prison is a stable place for certain criminals, because some commit crimes due to mental health issues that were never addressed. There are many measures Criminal psychologist have to look over during these investigations, while overlooking the law. Applied criminal psychology The effect of psychological and social factors on the functioning of our brain is the central question forensic or criminal psychologists deal with, due to the fact it is the seed of all our actions. For forensic psychiatry, the main question is 'Which patient becomes an offender?', or 'Which offender becomes a patient?'. Another main question asked by these psychiatrists is, 'What came first, the crime or the mental disorder?'. Psychologists also look at environmental factors along with genetics to determine the likeliness (Profiling) of a particular person to commit a crime. Criminal and forensic psychologists may also consider the following questions: #Is a mental disorder present now? Was it present during the time of the crime? #What is the level of responsibility of the offender for the crime? #What is the risk of reoffending and which risk factors are involved? #Is treatment possible to reduce the risk of reoffending? Accordingly, individual psychiatric evaluations are resorted to measuring personality traits by psychological testing that have good validity for the purpose of the court.

The attraction is inspired by Rod Serling's anthology television series, The Twilight Zone, and takes place in the fictional Hollywood Tower Hotel in Hollywood, California. The Tokyo version, which features an original storyline not related to The Twilight Zone, takes place in the fictional Hotel Hightower. All three versions place riders in a seemingly ordinary hotel elevator, and present the riders with a fictional backstory in which people have mysteriously disappeared from the elevator under the influence of some supernatural element many years previously. The original version of the attraction opened at Disney's Hollywood Studios, then named Disney-MGM Studios, at Walt Disney World in July 1994. A decade later, Disney began plans to add similar versions of the attraction to their newest parks at the Disneyland Resort in California, Tokyo Disney Resort in Japan, and Disneyland Paris. In California and Paris, Disney sought to use the popular attraction to boost attendance at the respective resorts' struggling new theme parks. The California and Tokyo versions of Tower of Terror opened in 2004 and 2006, respectively, while financial problems delayed the opening of the Paris version until 2007. The California version closed in January 2017. The Tower of Terror buildings are among the tallest structures found at their respective Disney resorts. At , the Florida version is the second tallest attraction at the Walt Disney World Resort, with only Expedition Everest being taller by . At the Disneyland Resort, the structure (which now houses Guardians of the Galaxy ‚Äì Mission: Breakout!) is the tallest building at the resort, as well as one of the tallest buildings in Anaheim. At Disneyland Paris, it is the second tallest attraction. History=Development= The original Tower of Terror, at Disney's Hollywood Studios In the late 1980s, a second phase of development was being designed for Disneyland Paris (then known as Euro Disney). Included was a free-fall type ride in Frontierland that was to be named Geyser Mountain. It would have been part roller coaster, part free-fall ride that shot guests up a vertical shaft. The plan was scrapped, but was picked up by Disney's Hollywood Studios (then Disney-MGM Studios) as part of a massive expansion to their U.S. park. Several attractions had already been proposed, including \\"Dick Tracy's Crimestoppers\\", which would be later made into Indiana Jones Adventure at Disneyland. Still needing a major \\"E-ticket\\" attraction, the idea of a drop-shaft ride came up and was chosen. There had been several proposed ideas for haunted attractions, including a ride based on Stephen King's novels, a Vincent Price ghost tour, a Mel Brooks-narrated ride, a real hotel, and a whodunit murder mystery, but none progressed into development. Walt Disney Imagineering eventually took inspiration from Rod Serling's anthology stories featured in The Twilight Zone, as a foundation for their original story. Imagineers mused that the attraction would be able to take guests into the Fifth Dimension that Serling always described as unlocking in every episode of the series. With the project in firm development, Disney licensed the rights to use The Twilight Zone intellectual property from the CBS subsidiary of the CBS Entertainment Group division of ViacomCBS.. The Imagineering team settled on a 1930s-era Hollywood hotel with a Twilight Zone theme, but a new ride system had to be built, which would allow both more capacity inside the ride and make the drop fast. Otis Elevator Company created the vertical ride system, and Eaton-Kenway a ride vehicle that could drive itself horizontally. Joe Dante directed the ride's preshow film. Disney felt Rod Serling needed to be part of the attraction, although he had died almost two decades earlier. In order to include Serling in the attraction, Disney opted to hold auditions to cast his voice, with Carol Serling, Rod's wife, serving as a consultant for the casting. After many auditions, Mark Silverman was chosen by Rod's wife to provide her husband's voice. The archival footage of Serling used in the preshow was taken from the episode, \\"It's a Good Life\\". Silverman would later reprise this voice role for additional lines for the Disney California Adventure attraction. He also reprised the voice of Serling for the first season finale of the 2019 revival of The Twilight Zone. Site-clearing and prep began early 1992. A sinkhole led to the site being moved slightly. The tower's interior and exterior design took inspiration from existing Southern California landmarks, including the Biltmore Hotel and Mission Inn. The distinctive Spanish Colonial Revival architectural features on and around the attraction's roof were designed so that the rear facade, which is visible from Epcot, would blend with the skyline of the Morocco Pavilion in Epcot's World Showcase Lagoon. After construction ended, the ride was initially set to open on July 4, 1994, however, the Tower of Terror opened on July 22, 1994, along with the Sunset Boulevard section of Disney-MGM Studios. =Engineering= The ride system employs specialized technology developed by Walt Disney Imagineering, particularly the ability to move the vehicle in and out of the vertical motion shaft. The elevator cabs are self-propelled automated guided vehicles, which lock into separate vertical motion cabs. The cabs can move into and out of elevators horizontally, move through the \\"Fifth Dimension\\" scene, and on to the drop shaft. The Florida ride runs on a unique loop system, with two identical ride systems built within the Tower. There are four shafts in the back section of the building containing the dark-ride portion of the attraction. After the corridor scene, the four shafts merge into two, with identical \\"Fifth Dimension\\" scenes, and then a cab enters the single drop shaft. After the drop sequence, the elevators unload in the building's basement, then return to one of the show shafts to re-load the next guests. In order to achieve the weightless effect the Imagineers desired, cables attached to the bottom of the elevator car pull it down at a speed slightly faster than what a free fall would provide. Two enormous motors are located at the top of the tower, measuring tall, long, and weighing . They are able to accelerate at 15 times the speed of normal elevators. They generate 275 times the torque of a Corvette engine, reaching top speed in 1.5 second. The ride's slogan, \\"Never the Same Fear Twice!\\", refers to the drop pattern being randomly selected by a computer before the ride begins. The drop reaches a top speed of . The design of the 199 ft (60.7 m) tall Tower of Terror was founded on advanced dynamic analysis to model the effects of moving parts on the structural and non- structural elements. Since the facility was intended to provide new and non- repeatable sensations to visitors, a very wide variety of elevator drops and sequences of downward and upward motions, spanning anywhere from 1 floor to 13 floors, were modeled. Each elevator drop mode was analyzed as a time history - in other words accelerations that change in time - applied to the entire structural system. The objective was to push the motion beyond a free fall and provide the thrill to riders while ensuring structural integrity and safety. In addition to the self-weight of the structure, when motors weighing 270 kilo-pounds (123 metric tons) move, the force they exert on the structure is amplified by an order of magnitude. The applied accelerations were tested in the model over a range of 1.0 g (32.2 feet/s/s or 9.81 m/s/s) to 2.5 g (80.5 feet/s/s or 24.5 m/s/s). In addition to strength requirements, the design applied very stringent deflection criteria. In the case of the tower, floors have to support cabs while in horizontal motion in and out of the elevators with minimal deflections to avoid blurry projection screens.Chalhoub, Michel Soto (1993), Disney World Tower of Terror Design and Dynamic Analysis for Shock, Vibration, and Fatigue. Des. Rept. #93-08-07, R. M. Parsons Lib., 100 W. Walnut St., Pasadena, CA. Ride experience=Queue and preshow= In the American and European versions of the attraction, guests make their way to the Hollywood Tower Hotel through the front gate. Guests then walk along a cracked, curved pathway that leads to the hotel. The pathway goes past overgrown gardens, signs pointing to the stables, a bowling green, tennis courts, swimming pools, and a vine-covered pavilion. In most parks, 1930s jazz music plays in the queue area. Entering through the hotel's front doors, guests encounter an interior designed to give the impression that the Hollywood Tower Hotel has been left untouched since the night of its closure. The lobby is covered in dust and draped with cobwebs, and throughout there are other signs of the hotel's abrupt closure. Past the front desk, the main elevators are in a dilapidated state, and a sign reads \\"Out of Order\\". Guests are informed by bellhops that their rooms are not ready yet, and they are then ushered into the hotel library, which houses the hotel's collection of books, antiques, an old television set, and various pieces of Twilight Zone memorabilia scattered about the room. Through the library window, guests can observe a severe thunderstorm raging outside. With a crash of thunder and lightning, the power suddenly goes out, except for the television set which crackles into life and plays the opening sequence from the fourth and fifth seasons of The Twilight Zone, hosted by Rod Serling. :\\"You unlock this door with the key of imagination. Beyond it is another dimension. A dimension of sound, a dimension of sight, a dimension of mind. You're moving into a land of both shadow and substance, of things and ideas. You've just crossed over to... The Twilight Zone.\\" The episode goes on to depict the events of a stormy night in 1939. :\\"Hollywood, 1939. Amid the glitz and the glitter of a bustling movie town at the height of its golden age, the Hollywood Tower Hotel was a star in its own right, a beacon for the show business elite. Now, something is about to happen that will change all that.\\" As the video plays, a lightning bolt strikes the tower and causes five people‚Äîa celebrity couple, a rising child star, her nanny, and a hotel bellhop‚Äîto vanish from the elevator, along with an entire wing of the building. The scene then cuts to the out of order elevator, and digitally-altered footage of Rod Serling from \\"It's a Good Life\\". :\\"The time is now, on an evening very much like the one we have just witnessed. Tonight's story of The Twilight Zone is somewhat unique and calls for a different kind of introduction. This as you may recognize is a maintenance service elevator, still in operation, waiting for you. We invite you if you dare to step aboard because in tonight's episode, you are the star, and this elevator travels directly to...the Twilight Zone.\\" The television then turns off and the guests are directed through to the boiler room, where they await the maintenance service elevator's arrival. =Ride beginning and the corridor scene= As the doors close inside the elevator, the lights dim and the elevator starts going up. Rod Serling's voice greets passengers saying: :\\"You are the passengers on a most uncommon elevator about to ascend into your very own episode of The Twilight Zone.\\" The elevator rises for a few seconds before coming to its first stop. The doors open to reveal a long, dimly lit hotel corridor, with overgrown plants and doors to guest rooms, with morning newspapers and room-service trays outside, along its length. There is a single window at the opposite end of the corridor. A violent thunderstorm is raging and lightning flashes outside the window. The five missing passengers from 1939 appear for several moments, turning to face the elevator and beckoning the guests to join them. Then they disappear in a burst of electricity. The corridor fades away, but the window remains until it appears to be floating in a dark field of stars. The window morphs into the window from the Season 5 opening sequence, and breaks. Because of space limitations in the dark ride shafts, the corridor scenes are stacked on top of one another between the shafts, with the outside shafts having them on a higher floor than the inside shafts. =Fifth Dimension scene= The lobby of The Hollywood Tower Hotel at Disney's Hollywood Studios, May 2010 The elevator doors close and the car continues its ascent. Serling's narration goes on, saying: :\\"One stormy night long ago, five people stepped through the door of an elevator and into a nightmare. That door is opening once again, and this time, it's opening for you.\\" The elevator stops once more. The doors open to what at first looks like a maintenance room, but slowly transforms into a field of stars. The elevator car emerges horizontally from the lift shaft and enters a section of the ride called \\"The Fifth Dimension\\", which is a collection of sights and sounds and star fields, again in the style of the television show's opening sequence. A rendition of The Twilight Zone theme plays throughout. The scene ends as the elevator reaches another star field which splits and opens much like elevator doors. The elevator enters another vertical shaft, this one pitch black. Serling's voice is heard again, saying: :\\"You are about to discover what lies beyond the fifth dimension, beyond the deepest, darkest corner of the imagination, in the Tower of Terror.\\" =Drop sequence= On the last word of Serling's narration, the elevator starts its drop sequence. Rather than a simple gravity-powered drop, however, the elevator is pulled downwards, causing most riders to rise off their seats, held down by their seat belt. At least once during the drop sequence, wide elevator doors in front of the riders open to reveal a view of the park from a height of ; however, the drop is only , the height of a 13-story building. The elevator drops at a top speed of . In the Hollywood Studios version, the back of the \\"Hollywood Tower Hotel\\" sign partially obstructs the view (the on-ride camera is located here, recording the ride for video or a photograph to be purchased later). In celebration of the attraction's tenth anniversary in 2004, randomized patterns of drops and lifts were added, where the ride vehicle will drop or rise various distances at different intervals. Other added effects include projected images of the breaking window, wind effects, lightning flashes, and ominous blue-lit figures of the five ghostly original riders. These changes were made so that each trip on The Twilight Zone Tower of Terror is a slightly different experience. The ride system was reprogrammed in 2003 to allow for a combination of four sequences consisting of randomized drops and lifts. When guests enter the drop shaft, a computer randomly chooses one of four drop profiles, one of which is a modified version of the ride's third incarnation from 1999, a \\"triple drop.\\" Back in 1994, the ride only featured a single rise-and-fall sequence. Two years later, the ride was given a double drop sequence, making it \\"twice the fright.\\" Regardless of the number of randomized drops and lifts, each drop sequence always features one \\"faux drop\\" meant to startle the riders, and one complete drop through the entire tower at the top speed of . After a series of these drops have been made, the elevator backs up into the basement of the decrepit Hollywood Tower Hotel, past a curious array of abandoned items including many Twilight Zone Easter eggs. A short clip plays, showing elements from the Season 5 opening sequence, along with the 1939 elevator passengers and Rod Serling falling into the \\"vortex\\" seen in the Season 3 opening sequence. Serling's voice says: :\\"A warm welcome back to those of you who made it, and a friendly word of warning, something you won't find in any guidebook. The next time you check into a deserted hotel on the dark side of Hollywood, make sure you know just what kind of vacancy you're filling. Or you may find yourself a permanent resident... of the Twilight Zone.\\" The ride elevator then rotates 90 degrees and parks itself at a set of exit doors in the building's actual basement. Guests exit the elevator here, leaving the hotel through the gift shop. After this, the ride elevator travels empty back to the dark ride shaft so it can return to the loading area. =Ride exit and shop= On leaving the elevator, guests are led through a hotel corridor towards what would appear to be the old \\"Lost & Found\\" desk of the hotel; however, it is now where photos taken on the ride may be purchased. Beyond this desk, guests pass a cracked fountain to the left and on the right can be seen the Hollywood Tower Hotel's dining room, previously called The Sunset Room. The menu, placed outside the closed double- doors, is dated October 31, 1939. Guests then enter the gift shop, Tower Merchandise. The shop, in keeping with the theme of the hotel, has cracked walls and is dimly lit. There, guests may purchase Twilight Zone merchandise and Hollywood Tower Hotel-themed souvenirs, including hotel bathrobes and slippers. On August 13, 2014, the ride's on-ride camera began recording video, so that riders could purchase a photograph or video of their ride. This was the first ride at Walt Disney World to offer on-ride videos. On September 18, 2014, the Seven Dwarfs Mine Train ride at the Magic Kingdom began offering on- ride videos and pictures as well, making these the only two rides at Walt Disney World to offer videos and pictures. =Summer Nightastic!= In February 2010, Disney announced that the Tower of Terror would receive \\"new lighting effects and a new addition\\" as part of a summer entertainment package called \\"Summer Nightastic!\\". The Fifth Dimension scene was mostly covered by black tarps with fiber-optic stars, and Serling's voice was removed from just before the drop profile. Replacing it is music played in the drop shaft, along with a projected picture of the riders just before they enter the drop shaft. Similar to the California and Paris versions of the ride, the riders disappear, leaving an empty elevator. A new drop profile was created for \\"Summer Nightastic!\\", and replaced the other drop profiles on all rides. After the music played, three sudden, distorted bell rings were heard, which began the drop profile. The profile mainly consisted of utilizing the entire tower for the drop sequences, as compared to the numerous faux and shortened drops in the randomized version. The changes were implemented on June 5, 2010, but were officially introduced the day after. All changes were temporary, and lasted until August 14, 2010. Disney California Adventure and Walt Disney Studios Park versions Tower of Terror at Disney California Adventure in 2006. While similar in concept and theme to the original attraction in Florida, the version of Tower of Terror at Disney California Adventure, which opened in 2004 and closed in 2017, and its identical clone at Walt Disney Studios Park which opened in 2007, feature some significant differences. The exterior of these rides use architectural features reminiscent of Pueblo Deco styles found throughout Southern California during the Golden Age of Hollywood. The designs for this version were originally designed for the Paris park. However, when California Adventure was in need of an additional crowd- puller, the Paris version's plans were used for its version. When financial troubles hit Disney's Parisian resort, the attraction had to be put on hold. The Paris version of the ride was finally green-lit in 2005 and was under construction in the center of the park, behind the La Terrasse seating area, by early 2006. Upon completion, it was joined by a new Hollywood Boulevard lined by faux movie sets. Unlike its American cousins, the Paris Tower was constructed using concrete rather than steel due to French construction guidelines and standards, at a total cost exceeding ‚Ç¨180 million. The Paris version opened in 2007. The Paris and California versions were originally intended to be almost identical upon completion, but there are differences, notably the height of the building and the location of some rooms backstage, as well as other differences due to different construction and work regulations in France. In Paris, the default language for the pre-show library video and the ride is French, but can be changed to English by the Cast Member upon request. The library video is the same as the American version, but is dubbed in French and subtitled in English. These versions have a slightly different queue areas. The boiler room scene in the queue area has two floors, instead of the one floor in the original Florida version. The two floors allow for one elevator in one shaft to have guests on ride, while the other elevator of the same shaft was loading guests. There are three elevator shafts, with two elevators per shaft, for a total of six ride vehicles operating. =New ride operation system= Imagineers redesigned the ride system for the attraction in California and Paris and made some changes to the show scenes. The attraction features three elevator shafts. Each shaft was its own separate ride with its own separate operating system. This makes it easier to repair individual areas of the attraction without causing the entire attraction to go down. Each shaft has the capacity to accommodate two vehicles operating from two load levels, each vehicle loading and unloading at the same point. The ride was designed so that one vehicle can be in its ride profile while the other is at its loading level, giving each ride shaft the ability to accommodate more riders. Disney used this ride system again for Tokyo DisneySea's Hotel Hightower. =Ride experience=California (2004‚Äì2017) and Paris (2007‚Äì2019) Instead of the autonomous vehicle found in the original incarnation, the new ride system limits the elevator car to a single shaft. As the elevator doors close, the lights of the service elevator flicker out. The redesigned, multiple-cars-per-shaft, multilevel-boarding ride system requires that one elevator load while another be in the drop shaft progressing through the ride cycle. As such, the first movement guests experience is horizontal, as the elevator itself is pulled back from the doors as Rod Serling's voice is heard: :\\"You are the passengers on a most uncommon elevator...\\" With a flash of lightning, the walls of the basement disappear altogether, leaving only a star field around the service doors with a rotating purple spiral. :\\"...about to take the strangest journey of your lives. Your destination? Unknown; but this much is clear: a reservation has been made in your name for an extended stay.\\" The elevator rises quickly to the 5th floor. Because the dark-ride portion of the ride takes place in the drop shaft, the physical vertical vehicle conveyance system moves more quickly and nimbly than Florida's (in which the first tower functions only as a dark ride and is not built for the quick movements that the drop portion requires). As such, visitors feel a moment of weightlessness as the elevator quickly ascends and then stops on the 5th floor, where the doors open on an ornate, wood-framed mirror in a brightly lit corridor of the hotel and riders see their reflection in its glass. Serling's voice then says: :\\"Wave goodbye to the real world.\\" Suddenly, lightning strikes the hotel and the lights of both the corridor and elevator flicker out. A ghostly wind blows through a window and the reflection of riders in the elevator becomes distorted. With another blast, the elevator rumbles and shakes, and with a final blast of lightning, the electrified reflection disappears, leaving only the image of the empty elevator in the mirror as the doors close. :\\"For you have just entered the Twilight Zone.\\" The elevator descends and opens to reveal the \\"corridor\\" scene with an image of another elevator at the other end of the corridor (where Florida's version shows a window). Serling delivers his next narration: :\\"What happened here to dim the lights of Hollywood's brightest showplace is about to unfold once again.\\" The five missing guests from 1939 appear in the corridor, crackling with electricity and beckoning riders to join them. Then they disappear in a bolt of electricity, and the walls in the corridor become a star field, leaving just the other elevator, as Serling says: :\\"One stormy night long ago, five people stepped through the door of an elevator and into a nightmare.\\" The other elevator doors open to reveal the lost passengers inside as both elevators appear to float through space. :\\"That door is opening once again, but this time it's opening for you.\\" The distant guests fall, then the distant elevator, followed by the ride elevator. This version of the ride does not have a randomized drop sequence, so the ride experience is identical in every drop shaft, regardless of which floor passengers board on. Two small drops occur in pitch-black darkness, followed by a rise to the top of the tower as in-cabin lights flicker. The doors then open out to reveal the view from the top floor before the car drops briefly, pauses, and drops along the remainder of the shaft. The elevator then raises almost to the top, and immediately drops without stopping, in complete darkness. The elevator then ascends all the way to the top of the tower, shudders, and falls to the bottom of the shaft, to the area in between the two loading floors (to assure each ride is identical), with the elevator being finally returned to its load level and horizontally pushed back into place at the boiler room service doors. The height of the ride is and the elevator drop in total. As the elevator is pushed back into place, Serling delivers his final narration: :\\"The next time you check into a deserted hotel on the dark side of Hollywood, make sure you know just what kind of vacancy you're filling. Or you may find yourself a permanent resident... of the Twilight Zone.\\" After which, the service doors open and guests exit the hotel through the basement and the gift shop. The Twilight Zone Tower of Terror - A New Dimension of Chills (Paris, 2019‚Äìpresent) On September 10, 2019, it was announced that the Paris version would be \\"reimagined\\" to The Twilight Zone Tower of Terror - A New Dimension of Chills. The ride will be enhanced with new ride profiles, drop sequences, effects, and storylines that expand upon the original one. According to Imagineer Tom Fitzgerald, the reimagining introduced three new Twilight Zone storylines, each starring the little girl who disappeared in the hotel's elevator from the original story: * The Malevolent Machine - The elevator has become a sentient being and is intent on torturing guests as it rises and falls through the tower. * The Shaft Creatures - Demonic creatures who prey on human sound have infested the elevator shaft and are looking for new victims. The little girl warns guests to stay quiet to avoid being caught by these creatures. Interestingly, the Shiriki Utundu's evil laughter (from the Tokyo DisneySea version) is used to represent the creatures. * The Fifth Dimension - A portal to the Fifth Dimension has been opened and a sinister specter is eyeing the guests as its new victims. The reimagined attraction opened on September 28, 2019, in time for Disneyland Paris' Halloween celebrations. =Closure of the California version= On July 23, 2016, at San Diego Comic-Con, Disney announced that the California version would be replaced by an attraction based on Marvel's Guardians of the Galaxy film series, titled Guardians of the Galaxy ‚Äì Mission: Breakout!, which opened in May 2017 and utilizes the same structure and ride system. This is the first American Disney attraction to be based on the Marvel Cinematic Universe (Marvel Entertainment having been wholly acquired by Disney in 2009). The Tower of Terror's final day of operation was January 2, 2017; the ride then closed January 3. In preparation for the closure, Disney began a \\"farewell\\" promotion of the ride on September 9, 2016, which featured a \\"Late Check Out\\" option to experience the drop portion of the ride in total darkness. On the night of September 19 and early morning of September 20, the \\"Hollywood Tower Hotel\\" sign was removed to prepare for the new attraction. The other three Disney parks with versions of the Tower of Terror are unaffected, and Disney has stated that there are no plans to change the attraction in its other locations. Tokyo DisneySea version Tower of Terror at Tokyo DisneySea The attraction at Tokyo DisneySea is known simply as Tower of Terror and omits any connection or tie-in whatsoever with The Twilight Zone, as the television series is not well known in Japan. Instead, the attraction is themed as the fictional Hotel Hightower. The ride tower, its facade an example of Moorish Revival architecture, is located in the American Waterfront area of the park, close to the S.S. Columbia ocean liner. The ride system for this version is similar to that of the Disney California Adventure and Walt Disney Studios Park versions. The story line of the attraction is more complex than that of its American and European counterparts. The scenario involves the adventures of the hotel's famous builder and owner, Harrison Hightower III (modeled after Imagineering executive Joe Rohde), who went on many expeditions throughout the world and collected thousands of priceless artifacts. Most of these artifacts were stolen for personal gain and stored in his hotel. After one such expedition to Africa, he brought home an idol with the name of Shiriki Utundu. Hightower claimed that the natives were angry to have their beloved god taken, and that they threatened that the idol would curse him. On New Year's Eve, 1899, Hightower held a press conference about his expedition to Africa, followed by a huge party. Hightower boasted about how he acquired the idol and denied claims of it being cursed. Just as he left the party, he mocked the idol, using its head to put out his cigar. Around midnight, he entered the elevator to retire to his private apartments in the hotel penthouse. As the elevator neared the top, the idol came to life. The idol's immense rage and power caused the elevator to plummet and crash on the ground floor. When the doors were pried open, only Hightower's hat and the idol were recovered. The hotel was abruptly closed and condemned for more than a decade, rumored by locals to be haunted. In 1912, following pressure to demolish the hotel, a New York restoration company reopened it because of its historical significance. The company now offers paid tours of the building. It is on these \\"tours\\" that guests embark when they enter the hotel. =Queue and preshow= The queue area winds through gardens filled with statues from many different countries up to the Hotel Hightower, where guests can see that the windows are almost completely shattered. Signs are posted all over the hotel front advertising the tour. Guests then enter the lobby, an elaborate and well-decorated room filled with plush furniture and beautiful art. On each ceiling arch is painted a mural of Hightower on one of his adventures, showing him escaping native people with a valuable artifact or item in his possession. At the end of the lobby is the elevator in its destroyed state, its doors left open with only a single plank of wood holding them together, a broken cable visible inside. Guests are then ushered into a room filled with many pictures of Hightower, his expeditions, and his hotel. Guests enter one of two rooms that are Hightower's office. In each room a large stained glass window depicts a confident Hightower with Shiriki Utundu sitting on a pedestal nearby. A tour guide talks about Hightower, then winds up an old gramophone that plays a recording of Hightower's last interview. At this point, the lights dim. Suddenly, the stained glass window changes to show a frightened Hightower holding the idol and then entering the elevator on that fateful night. It then shows the outside of the hotel as the elevator ascends. Suddenly, all the lights in the hotel go out, and there is a flash of green lightning, shattering the bottom of the window. At this point, Shiriki Utundu comes to life, looks around, laughs mischievously at the guests, and then vanishes into a star-field. A gray fog covers the window, which remains the same when the fog lifts. Guests are then ushered into an enormous storage room where Hightower kept his treasures. There are multiple loading rooms on the second floor, each themed to a different type of item. One has swords, another has tapestries, the third has stone tablets and other valuable artifacts. =Ride experience= The mechanics of the DisneySea tower are identical to those of the Californian and Parisian towers, with dual loading floors, horizontal push-back from the doors and into the drop tower, a \\"corridor\\" scene, and a mirror scene, but with thematic changes. The order of the mirror and \\"corridor\\" scenes is reversed compared to the American and European counterparts. As the ride begins, a flash of electricity appears on the top of the elevator doors. The lights flicker, then go out. Hightower explains what happened to him, while the elevator is pulled backwards. The glowing green eyes of the idol appear in the darkness as the elevator enters the drop shaft. The elevator begins its ascent, stopping at the first scene. The elevator doors open to reveal the private apartments of Harrison Hightower, the idol sitting on a table in the center. Hightower's ghost, glowing blue, appears beside it and reaches out to touch it. The idol zaps him with a bolt of green electricity, blasting him backwards past open elevator doors at the opposite end of the apartments, where Hightower falls down the shaft. The private apartments fade away, replaced by a star field. The idol turns toward the guests' elevator and laughs before the doors close. The elevator ascends to another level. The doors open, revealing a large, ornate mirror. Hightower tells the guests to wave and say \\"good bye\\" to themselves. As they do, the lighting of the hotel is replaced with an eerie green glow, which makes the reflections of the guests ghostlike, an effect similar to the California and Paris rides, but absent the lightning strike. The ghostly reflection of the riders disappears and leaves the idol alone in the empty elevator. The idol laughs menacingly at the riders, and suddenly shoots forward at them. The elevator vibrates, then begins the drop sequence. The sequence is identical to the US version except the first two drops are missing (the ascent comes first) and the final drop takes place from the bottom set of doors rather than the top of the shaft. At the end of the drop sequence, the elevator returns to its loading level, where the idol's green eyes glare one last time in the dark and then disappear, replaced by the service doors through which guests entered. The Twilight Zone references in the attraction In an effort to be true to the spirit of The Twilight Zone, Disney Imagineers reportedly watched every episode of the original television show at least twice. The attraction buildings are littered with references to Twilight Zone episodes. =Disney's Hollywood Studios= * The Mystic Seer machine from the episode \\"Nick of Time\\" can be seen sitting on the high shelf in the libraries, nearby the television. * The book titled \\"To Serve Man\\", from the episode of the same name, is seen in both libraries. * Chalk marks can be seen on one of walls of the waiting area that leads from the elevator unload, a reference to the episode \\"Little Girl Lost\\". In Walt Disney Studios, this can be found in the upper level of the boiler room next to the attraction warning signage; a similar version was present in Disney's California Adventure. * The slot machine from the episode \\"The Fever\\" is seen in one of the unload areas. * The ventriloquist dummy \\"Caesar\\" from the episode \\"Caesar and Me\\" is present in both unload areas. * From the episode \\"The Invaders\\", the eponymous characters are found on display in both libraries; they are also present in Walt Disney Studios Park. * An envelope with the name of Rod Serling on it can be found in one of the libraries as well as another envelope with the name of Victoria West in the other library, a reference to the episode \\"A World of His Own\\". * A poster advertising \\"Anthony Fremont's Orchestra\\" is displayed next to the concierge desk in the lobby; Anthony Fremont was the young boy with god-like powers from the episode \\"It's a Good Life\\" who hated music. This poster was displayed in the photo gallery at Disney California Adventure. * In the concierge's desk, a Photoplay magazine issue is seen open to an article titled \\"Four Pages of Hilarious Star Caricatures by Walt Disney\\". * Although not a reference to The Twilight Zone, there is a felt letter board with the hotel's directory for amenities, located between the inoperable elevators in the lobby, with missing letters that have fallen to the bottom of the board to spell \\"U R DOOMED\\". * The attraction was featured in the Disney Channel 1994 Halloween edition of Walt Disney World Inside Out, hosted by Scott Herriott, where guest star Gilbert Gottfried set out to experience Tower of Terror himself. =Disney California Adventure= * A door with the number 22 in brass numbering was present in the hotel lobby as a reference to the episode \\"Twenty Two\\". * A Shirley Temple doll sat on the hotel lobby, similar to the one at Walt Disney Studios. * Outside the library in the glass case adjacent to the doors, there is a gold thimble accompanied by a card that reads, \\"Looking for a gift for Mother? Find it in our Gift Shop!\\". This is a reference to the episode \\"The After Hours\\". * An envelope with the name of Rod Serling on it was found in one of the libraries as well as another envelope with the name of Victoria West in the other library, a reference to the episode \\"A World of His Own\\". * Similar to the queue of the Disneyland Paris version, chalk marks on the walls in the same style as those in the episode \\"Little Girl Lost\\" were present in the upper level of the boiler room next to the attraction warning signage. Periodically the girl's voice can be heard calling out for help from the wall and from the radios around the boiler room. * There was a display case in the photo gallery that contained two items relating to the episode \\"A Thing about Machines\\". One was a typewriter with a message that read: \\"GET OUT OF HERE FINCHLEY\\" and a card next to it that read \\"Almost Writes By Itself\\". There was also an electric razor; its card read \\"Has A Long Cord - Can Follow You Everywhere\\". There was also a toy telephone from the episode \\"Long Distance Call\\" with a card reading \\"Perfect for the children's room and those late night calls from Grandma\\". * Whilst exiting, there was a display window for \\"Willoughby Travel\\", a nod to the episode \\"A Stop at Willoughby\\". * A poster advertising \\"Anthony Fremont's Orchestra\\" was displayed in the photo gallery; Anthony Fremont was the young boy with god-like powers from the episode \\"It's a Good Life\\". This poster is displayed next to the concierge desk in the lobby at Disney's Hollywood Studios. =Walt Disney Studios Park= * A dusty old doll sits on a couch in the hotel lobby, believed to be Talky Tina from the episode \\"Living Doll\\", the little girl in the attraction's pre-show and experience or Sally Shine from the 1997 movie Tower of Terror. * The queue of the Disneyland Paris version features a reference to the Twilight Zone episode \\"Little Girl Lost\\". Chalk marks on the walls are in the same style as those in the episode, when people were trying to find the portal to the girl. This can be found in the upper level of the boiler room next to the attraction warning signage. Periodically the girl's voice can be heard calling out for help from the wall and from the radios around the boiler room. In Disney's Hollywood Studios, this can be seen on one of walls of the waiting area that leads from the elevator unload. * Upon exiting, the display cases on the ground floor contain advertisements for, among other things, a \\"Housemaid Wanted\\" (a reference to the episode \\"I Sing The Body Electric\\") and for \\"A Pair of Reading Glasses Wanted\\" (\\"Time Enough At Last\\"). * From the episode \\"The Invaders\\", the eponymous characters are found on display in both libraries; they are also present in Disney's Hollywood Studios. =Florida, California and Paris= * The pre-show includes a little girl holding a hidden Mickey in the form of a Mickey Mouse plush toy; this one appears again in the corridor scene. A hidden Mickey can also be found in each corner of the library's carpet pattern. A third hidden Mickey exists in one of the libraries in the form of a sheet music titled: \\"What! No Mickey Mouse? (What Kind of Party is This?)\\". * The trumpet from \\"A Passage for Trumpet\\" can be seen in one of the libraries. * The elevator has an inspection certification, signed by Mr. Cadwallader, the sinister deal-maker from the episode \\"Escape Clause\\". The last inspection date of the elevator is October 31, 1939, the very same night lightning struck the Hollywood Tower Hotel. Its certification number is 10259, a nod to October 2, 1959, the date The Twilight Zone first aired. * The flying saucer from the episode \\"The Invaders\\" is present hanging from the ceiling in both unload areas. * \\"Picture If You Will...\\", a phrase Rod Serling often used in various Twilight Zone episodes, appears in the area where guests purchase their on-ride photo; in Disney's Hollywood Studios, this phrase appears in the area where guests scan their park ticket or MagicBand for their on-ride photo and video. * In promotional television commercials for the attraction, an elevator's floor indicator outside the doors can be seen with its needle pointing past the 12th floor to the 13th, a reference to the 9th floor in the episode \\"The After Hours\\". Soundtrack Jazz music from the 1930s is played throughout the queueing area for the Tower of Terror at Disney's Hollywood Studios, as well as in the lobby and library. The ride's score was composed by Richard Bellis, and incorporates the main Twilight Zone theme composed by Marius Constant. The attraction's theme and can be found on several theme park albums: * Disneyland/Walt Disney World Music Vacation (as part of a medley) * Walt Disney World Resort: The Official Album (1999 CD) * Walt Disney World Resort: Official Album (2000 CD) * Official Album: Walt Disney World Resort Celebrating 100 Years of Magic (2001 CD) * The Official Album of the Disneyland Resort (2005 CD) * Disneyland Resort: Official Album (2013 CD) * Walt Disney World: Official Album (2013 CD) * Walt Disney Records: The Legacy Collection‚ÄìDisneyland (2015 CD) The Tokyo DisneySea version of the attraction is scored by Joel McNeely, who has released the overture on his site. Television film adaptation Following the attraction's success, Walt Disney Television produced the TV film Tower of Terror, starring Steven Guttenberg and Kirsten Dunst. Based on the attraction and not The Twilight Zone itself, it is Disney's first film based on one of its theme park attractions and the only one made for television. Many scenes were filmed at Disney's Hollywood Studios, when it was still named Disney-MGM Studios, while other scenes were filmed in Disney's Burbank studios.

The town's ZIP Code is 75415. The settlement was located on Benjamin Simmons' land grant and named for his son, Benjamin Franklin Simmons. The Simmons family, along with the Birdwells and Hogues, arrived in the area in 1835 and were among the first settlers. Rise of the town The first post office was established in 1853. The next year, a Methodist Episcopal church was established. The first school in the settlement was probably established shortly after the American Civil War. By 1884 Ben Franklin had a population of 200 and thrice-weekly mail service. Cotton ginning and shipment were the major businesses, but others included three sawmills, a shingle manufacturer, two flour mills, and a feed mill. The town also had three general stores, the McGinnis and Company saloon, a restaurant, an apothecary shop, and a blacksmith shop. The Gulf, Colorado and Santa Fe Railway built a track just north of Ben Franklin in 1886, and the settlement became a stop on the line by 1889. In 1890 it had a population of 1,000, two hotels, two livery stables, and a telegraph office. John McFall had opened a grocery, and P. H. Snodgrass worked as a sign painter. Citizens could attend new Baptist, Christian, and Adventist churches. In 1892 Ben Franklin supported two new hotels, a doctor had opened an office, and a barber had moved to town. Decline and near desertion of the town In 1895 the Texas-Midland Railroad built through Cooper, the county seat, and drew much of the traffic from Ben Franklin. By 1904 the population had decreased to 343. In 1912 only two businesses remained. Records for 1918 indicated two segregated schools. The town had 300 people and no businesses in 1925. However, by 1929 it had had a slight revival with 500 residents and a bank. By 1936 the railway through town had become part of the Gulf, Colorado and Santa Fe system, and the town had seven businesses, a school, three churches, and a population of 300. In 1945 rapidly declining Ben Franklin had 250 residents and seven businesses. In 1964 Ben Franklin had a water tank, two churches, two cemeteries, one business, the post office, and 150 inhabitants. Six years later there was a Ben Franklin Community Center. The only business in 1976 was Fremman's Grocery. In 1990 the community had seventy-five residents.

It either explains the structure of certain kinds of state in terms of the structure of the family (as a model or as a claim about the historical growth of the state), or it attempts to justify certain types of state by appeal to the structure of the family. The first known writer to use it (certainly in any clear and developed way) was Aristotle, who argued that the natural progression of human beings was from the family via small communities to the polis. Many writers from ancient times to the present have seen parallels between the family and the forms of the state. In particular, monarchists have argued that the state mirrors the patriarchal family, with the people obeying the king as children obey their father. Ancient Greek thought The family-state model was first expressed in ancient times, often as a form of justification for aristocratic rule. Plutarch records a laconic saying of the Dorians attributed to Lycurgus. Asked why he didn't establish a democracy in the Laced√¶mon, Lycurgus responded: \\"Begin, friend, and set it up in your family.\\" The Dorians of Crete and Sparta seemed to mirror the family institution and organization in their form of government. (see Plutarch's The Lives of the Noble Grecians and Romans -- Lycurgus, p. 65) Aristotle often describes personal and domestic relationships in terms of different forms of government. He gives examples such as men and their domestic animals, wives, slaves, and children. He says, for example: \\"the government of a household is a monarchy, since every house is governed by a single ruler.\\"(2) Later in the same text he says that husbands exercise a republican government over their wives and monarchical government over their children, and that they exhibit political office over slaves and royal office over the family in general. (Politics Bk I, ¬ßv, 1-2; 1259a 35-1259b 1) However, while he is prepared to use political terms as metaphors for domestic relationships, he is equally clear that such metaphors are limited: > Some thinkers, however, suppose that statesman, king, estate manager, and > master of a family have a common character. This is a mistake; they think > that the distinction between them is not a difference in kind, but a simple, > numerical difference.‚Äù (Politics Bk I, ¬ßi) > After discussing the various domestic relationships, he concludes: > ‚Äúmastership and statesmanship are not identical, nor are all forms of power > the same, as some thinkers suppose. (Politics Bk I, ¬ßvi) Aristotle's main notion is that the ancient Greek polis or city-state is the natural end of human beings; they start in family groups, progress naturally to forming villages, and finally come together in cities. Thus the family forms the root of human relationships, but the city is the flower. Arius Didymus in Stobaeus, 1st century CE, writes: \\"A primary kind of association (politeia) is the legal union of a man and woman for begetting children and for sharing life.\\" From the collection of households a village is formed and from villages a city, \\"[s]o just as the household yields for the city the seeds of its formation, thus it yields the constitution (politeia).\\" Further, he claims: \\"Connected with the house is a pattern of monarchy, of aristocracy and of democracy. The relationship of parents to children is monarchic, of husbands to wives aristocratic, of children to one another democratic.\\" (Hellenistic Commentary to the New Testament, edd Boring, Berger, & Colpe) Confucian thought Confucius believed the child should be subordinate to the parent, younger brother to the older, wife to husband, and subject to the sovereign who is to be regarded as the father of the nation. The state as the family writ large was the most harmonious, orderly, and natural form of government. This was later expanded to cover international relations (e.g. the emperor of China is treated as the older brother of the Korean king). Confucian family theory is still espoused in North Korea to justify their method of leadership succession. The concept of family is important in classical Confucianism. For Confucius, xi√†o or filial piety was a d√© or virtue. The character representing xi√†o, Â≠ù, itself represents a basic family structure, with the upper component representing elders (lao, old), and the lower representing children (zi, son). Those acting with filial piety, such as through the performances of lƒ≠ were therefore acting in accordance with y√¨ (righteousness, or fulfilling one's proper roles or acting in harmony with one's station). The relationship of this concept to the state is discussed at length in the Xi√†ojƒ´ng, or Classic of Filial Piety. In politics, xi√†o is not simply loyalty on the part of subordinates and citizens, but also an expectation for the king to provide for his subjects with \\"paternal love\\"; just as the people were expected to act with respect for the king's law, the king was expected to make those laws out of kindness for the people.Confucius.

MacMillan: New York, p. 41-47 American diplomat Edmund Roberts in his description of Canton City, which he visited in 1832, included a quote on this, for which he gives no source, but which was subsequently include in latter 18th-century publications, again without a source: > The sovereign of men, say they, \\"is heaven's son; nobles and statesmen are > the sovereign's children; the people are the children of nobles and > statesmen. The sovereign should serve heaven as a father, never forgetting > to cherish reverential thoughts, but exciting himself to illustrate his > virtues, and looking up to receive from heaven, the vast patrimony which it > confers; thus the emperors will daily increase in felicity and glory. Nobles > and ministers of state should serve their sovereign as a father, never > forgetting to cherish reverential thoughts, not harbouring covetous and > sordid desires, nor engaging in wicked and clandestine thoughts, but > faithfully and justly exerting themselves; thus their noble rank will be > preserved. The people should never forget to cherish reverential thoughts > towards the nobles and ministers of state, to obey and keep the laws; to > excite no secret or open rebellion; then no great calamity will befall their > persons.\\" Modern thought Louis de Bonald wrote as if the family were a miniature state. In his analysis of the family relationships of father, mother and child, De Bonald related these to the functions of a state: the father is the power, the mother is the minister and the child as subject. As the father is ‚Äúactive and strong‚Äù and the child is ‚Äúpassive or weak‚Äù, the mother is the ‚Äúmedian term between the two extremes of this continuous proportion‚Äù. De Bonald justified his analysis by quoting and interpreting passages from the Bible: > [It] calls man the reason, the head, the power of woman: Vir caput est > mulieris [man is head of woman] says St Paul. It calls woman the helper or > minister of man: \\"Let us make man\\", says Genesis, \\"a helper similar to him.\\" > It calls the child a subject, since it tells it, in a thousand places, to > obey its parents. (On Divorce pp 44-46) De Bonald also sees divorce as the first stage of disorder in the state (the principle of macrocosm/microcosm). He insists that the deconstitution of the family brings about the deconstitution of state, with ‚ÄúThe Kyklos‚Äù not far behind. (On Divorce, pp 88-89; 149.) Erik von Kuehnelt-Leddihn draws a connection between the family and monarchy: > Due to its inherent patriarchalism, monarchy fits organically into the > ecclesiastic and familistic pattern of a Christian society. (Compare the > teaching of Pope Leo XIII: 'Likewise the powers of fathers of families > preserves expressly a certain image and form of the authority which is in > God, from which all paternity in heaven and earth receives its name -- Eph > 3.15') The relationship between the King as 'father of the fatherland' and > the people is one of mutual love. (Liberty or Equality, p.155) Politics and the family In her book, Delacroix, Art and Patrimony in Post- Revolutionary France, Elisabeth Fraser analyses Eug√®ne Delacroix's famous ‚ÄúMassacres of Chios‚Äù (1824), which helped galvanise philo-Hellenism in France. Delacroix's symbol for the oppressed Greek nation was a family employed as a conceptual and visual structuring device. A reviewer encapsulated Fraser's argument: > Equating patriarchal family metaphor with government paternalism and > imperialist protectionism, the chapter argues that such familial > intimations, heightened by acute emotionalism and hints of a Western culture > soiled by Eastern penetration, corresponded to and reflected a paternalistic > government urge to protect the victimized Greeks, a thinly veiled > justification for French colonial intervention in the Mediterranean.Nina > Athanassoglou-Kallmyer More recently, George Lakoff has claimed that the left/right distinction in politics comes from a difference between ideals of the family in the mind of the person in question; for right-wing people, the ideal is a patriarchical and moralistic family; for left-wing people, the ideal is an unconditionally loving family. As a result, Lakoff argues, both sides find each other's views not only immoral, but incomprehensible, since they appear to violate each side's deeply held beliefs about personal morality in the sphere of the family. Such a model is not a recent addition to modern discourse; J. Vernon Jenson discussed ‚ÄúBritish Voices on the Eve of the American Revolution: Trapped by the Family Metaphor‚Äù in the Quarterly Journal of Speech 63 (1977), pp 43-50\\\\. The idea of the commonwealth as a family is close to clich√©; it permeates political discourse at every level: > There is an historic American National Family metaphor .. That American > National Family frame is like any real extended family-fractious but in the > end functional. There are people in it who aren't just like you, but they > are still family and we still have to try to solve our problems together, > despite our differences.Susan C.

It was the most popular third-party memory manager for the MS-DOS and other DOS operating systems. QEMM product ranges ;QRAM: A memory manager for Intel 80286 or higher CPUs. It supports Chips and Technologies chipsets. 2.02 added SHADOWRAM switch. QEXT correctly reallocates eXtended Memory Specification (XMS). It includes VIDRAM, Optimize, LOADHI from QEMM 6.02, Manifest 1.13. Earlier versions of QRAM also supported the older 8086 and 8088 CPUs. ;QEMM Game Edition: It is a version of QEMM that includes Quarterdeck GameRunner. Patches for regular QEMM do not work on QEMM Game Edition. ;QEMM MegaBundle: In the version shipped with Borland SideKick for Windows, it is a version with SideBar 1.00 (1994-08-22) and QEMM 7.5. ;DESQview 386: It includes DESQview and QEMM-386. Features/tools=QEMM driver= IBM PS/2 personal computers QEMM provides access to the Upper Memory Area (UMA) and memory through the Expanded Memory Specification (EMS), Extended Memory Specification (XMS), Virtual Control Program Interface (VCPI) and DOS Protected Mode Interface (DPMI). *Quickboot: It allows a form of warm reboot or local reboot to be performed without going through the BIOS. It will therefore completely bypass the POST, including the BIOS startup screen and the time-consuming memory test and device enumeration, and just restore the CPU state and interrupts to their initial state after POST. =DOS-Up= It relocates DOS kernel, COMMAND.COM interpreter, DOS resources (e.g.: buffers, file handles, stacks, lastdrive). It supports DOS 3.2 or higher. =HOOKRAM= It allows drivers to be loaded before loading QEMM and still allow the use of QEMM's Stealth feature. =MagnaRAM= It was a virtual memory compression utility for Windows 3.1, Windows For Workgroups and Windows 95. MagnaRAM is included with QEMM 97. MagnaRAM was also released as a separate utility.Article: QUARTERDECK SHIPS MAGNARAM 2: CROSS-PLATFORM MEMORY MULTIPLIER FOR WINDOWS MagnaRAM worked by replacing a portion of Windows' virtual memory system. MagnaRAM would insert itself in the string of Windows Programs that determined what pieces of RAM will be moved to the hard disk. Instead of writing directly to the hard disk, the information to be written would go to MagnaRAM's own buffer as this was a faster process. During CPU idle, MagnaRAM would compress the information in its own RAM buffer. When the RAM buffer becomes full, it is then swapped to the hard disk taking both less time and less space.Quarterdeck MagnaRAM 2.0 Complete package =Manifest= Manifest (MFT) is a hardware information utility that displays information about user's system. *1.11 fixed minor cosmetic bugs. *1.12 can identify PS/2 Model 57SX, Compaq Deskpro 486s/16M, Sharp MZ-100. Available EMS in System Overview screen was corrected when using Stealth. *1.13 fixed Award BIOS identification problem. *Version 2.0 provides information on network, enhance reporting of video capabilities, APM, DPMI/VCPI/EMS/XMS memory. New feature include editing DOS and Windows boot configuration files. =Optimize= Similar to MEMMAKER, it is a utility that calculates, and allows user to choose optimal orders of loading drivers and TSRs. However, OPTIMIZE allows preview of adjustments be made without rebooting. Shipped with QEMM and DESQview. =QDPMI= QDPMI is a DPMI 0.9 server driver, authored by Dan Spear. It requires 386 CPU and QEMM386. =QEMM 50/60= It is a version of QEMM driver for IBM PS/2 Model 50 and 60. Version 4.03 supports IBM Memory Expansion Option boards with 2-8MB memory. =Stealth= It can relocate memory assigned for CGA character set away from UMA. Beginning with QEMM version 8, it allows ROM contents in UMA to be relocated to provide more memory for TSRs. Additional Stealth Windows compatibility is provided with VxDs. =Stealth DoubleSpace/D*Space= Stealth D*Space allows DoubleSpace or DriveSpace to be loaded high. =T386= It allows Toshiba laptops to work with QEMM's EMS manager. =VIDRAM= *Provides extra conventional memory in text mode programs, by reclaiming buffers located in UMA that are used in graphics modes. *It requires EGA/VGA-compatible video card. *VIDRAM EMS supports DMA-based video memory access at the expense of EMS memory for buffer. =Limitations=Device driver limit LOADHI.SYS loads up to 1 device driver at a time in QEMM 4.23, 2 in QEMM 5, 32 in QEMM 6. MagnaRAM limit Maximum compression threshold setting is 100% for all versions of MagnaRAM 2.00-2.02, except for MagnaRAM 2.00 included with QEMM 8.00, which has the maximum setting of 80%. Memory limit * QEMM 5.0 can manage up to 16 MB EMS, 16 MB XMS. * QEMM 6.0 can manage up to 64 MB EMS, 64 MB XMS. * QEMM 6.02 can manage up to 128 MB EMS, 128 MB XMS. EMBMEM (16-bit) parameter limit was removed. * QEMM 7.0-7.03 can manage up to 128 MB EMS, 128 MB XMS. * QEMM 7.04, 7.5, 8.0-8.3 and 97 (aka QEMM 9.0) can manage up to 256 MB EMS/XMS. By default, QEMM 7.04 and above provide up to a total of 64 MB RAM shared among XMS, EMS and VCPI memory, unless the USERAM= parameter is used. For example, to allow access to up to 256 MB EMS (or 256 MB XMS), specify: QEMM386.SYS USERAM=1M-256M 3.10 How to get the most RAM for DJGPP programs? For QEMM 7.04 and above, the maximum addressable RAM is 256 MB of memory, shared among XMS, EMS and VCPI memory. Initially, XMS allocates the entire 256 MB and shares it with EMS and VCPI as needed, that is, as EMS and VCPI request memory blocks, XMS free memory is reduced by that same amount.QEMM Problem Optimize limit Versions up to QEMM 6.01 can process batch files up to 9KB, and 20KB in QEMM 6.02. Batch file line limit is 512 for QEMM versions up to 6.02. Stealth DoubleSpace/D*Space Stealth D*Space does not support Windows 95 or later versions of DriveSpace. Version history Originally, the product was called QEMM-386 (requiring an Intel 80386 and DOS 3.30.), and was released with a complementary product called QRAM (for use on intel 80286 and 8088). The 386 suffix was dropped starting with QEMM version 7.0 in 1993, when Intel released the Intel Pentium on March 22, 1993. The final release was re-branded as QEMM 97 to follow Microsoft's new branding trend of using year released instead of version numbers, specifically, Windows 95 and Windows 95 OSR2. =QEMM-386 v4.2 (November 11, 1988)= * Supported Intel 80386 and DOS 3.30. * Bundled with QRAM for 80286 or 8088/8086 computers. =QEMM-386 v5.0 (January 1990)= *Added support for Intel 80486, DOS 4.01 and Windows 3.0. *Maximum RAM is 16MB XMS/16MB EMS. *LOADHI.SYS now loads 2 device drivers at a time. *New QEMM parameters include COMPAQ386S (C386S). =QEMM-386 v5.11 (mid 1990)= *Added support for Virtual DMA Services (VDS). *Supported larger memory cache. = QEMM-386 v6.0 (early 1991) = * Added support for DOS 5.00a and Windows 3.0a. *Maximum RAM is 64MB XMS/64MB EMS. *New features include Stealth. *New utilities include HOOKRAM. *LOADHI.SYS now loads 32 device drivers at a time. *Manifest was updated to 1.10. *QRAM updated to 2.02 for intel 80286 and intel 8088 systems. = QEMM-386 v6.01 (mid 1991) = *QEMM supports loading XMS driver before QEMM, running Stealth in Windows 3.0 in 386 Enhanced mode. *Optimize support indented CALL statements in batch files. *Manifest was updated to 1.11. = QEMM-386 v6.02 (November 13, 1991) = *Supports 2.88MB floppy drives. *New Optimize switches include /COMMANDFILE (CMD), /LOADLOW (LOW), /QUICK (Q).

Optimize now properly detects hardware on system with network card. =QEMM v7.53 (May 12, 1995)= *Added support for DOS 6.22, Windows 3.11 and Windows for Workgroups 3.11. *Maximum RAM is 256MB XMS/256MB EMS. *Improved OPTIMIZE so it finds EMS in hardware detection phase. =QEMM v8.0 (1995-11-04)= * Attempted to support Windows 95. * Updated MagnaRAM 2.02. * QEMM v8.0 did not take full advantage of the new capabilities of Windows 95. It simply acted as if it was Windows 3.11 and relied on Windows 95 being downward compatible with Windows 3.1x. Quarterdeck attempted to better integrate v8.x with Windows 95 with patch v8.01 and the final patch v8.03. =QEMM v8.01 (February 14, 1996)= * Improved support for Windows 95 and under-laying DOS 7.00. * Added 4DOS.CMD. =QEMM v8.03 (April 7, 1997)= *Full support for pure DOS 6.22 with Windows 3.11 or Windows for Workgroups 3.11. *Bug fixes including improvements to QEMM386, DOS-Up, LOADHI. *Final official patch to QEMM v8.x (March 25, 1997) back-ports many improvements from soon-to-be released QEMM 97. =QEMM 97 (aka v9.0) (May 15, 1997)= *Full support for Windows 95/98/98SE (not ME). *QEMM v8.03 lacks capabilities under Windows 95 (And doesn't work with Windows 98). *New utilities include MagnaRAM, optimizing Windows 9x paging file.  One Install.exe but two roles  *Run the installer from within Windows, and it will fully integrate QEMM 97 with Windows configuration files and registry updating system.ini, adding QEMM group, auto starting QEMM monitoring, etc. *However, run the installer, install.exe, from a pure DOS (DOS 7.10 or DOS 6.22) without Windows present, and it will configure and install only the DOS utilities; updating only DOS's config.sys and autoexec.bat files. QEMM Configurations QEMM provides up to 635K free conventional memory (RAM under 640K), far better than pure MS-DOS EMM386, FreeDOS JEMM386, UMBPCI and many other memory manager programs. QEMM maximum RAM is 635K free conventional memory with up to 256MB XMS/256MB EMS shared. =MS-DOS 6.22, Windows 3.11/WFW 3.11= QEMM provides the best benefits to MS-DOS 6.22 or older since DOS's. MS-DOS 6.22 provides 619K free conventional memory and up to 64MB XMS/32MB EMS shared RAM. Assuming unaltered MS-DOS 6.22, without 3rd party utilities, i.e. JEMM, UMBPCI, etc. QEMM increases the available free conventional RAM to 635K with shared 256MB XMS/256MB EMS. While using Windows 3.11 or Windows For Workgroups 3.11, QEMM provides additional free conventional memory for DOS Prompt running under Windows. QEMM is well suited for Windows 3.x as has supported for it since QEMM v5.x as early as 1990. As a result, QEMM 8.03 or QEMM 97 integrate very well with Windows 3.11/WFW 3.11. =MS-DOS 7.10, Windows 95 OSR2/Windows 98 SE= QEMM increases the available free conventional RAM for MS-DOS 7.10 and also for DOS Prompt under Windows 95 OSR2/Windows 98 SE. However, QEMM maximum RAM is a shared 256MB XMS/256MB EMS, which is less than what DOS 7.10 and Windows 95/98 support without QEMM. MS-DOS 7.10 provides 624K free conventional memory and up to 1GB XMS/32MB EMS; assuming unaltered MS-DOS, using HIMEM.SYS and EMM386.EXE without any 3rd party utilities. Thus, QEMM is compatible with MS-DOS 7.10 and Windows 9x and provides slightly more free conventional RAM but it does lower the maximum RAM to 256MB XMS/256MB EMS. = Consequences of using or disabling EMS = EMS memory normally uses a 64KB of UMB as the Page Frame, this reduces the total UMB available to DOS. So some recommend turning off EMS, using the NOEMS switch, to increase the total UMB free by 64KB. QEMM supports NOEMS switch, however, it is far better to provide EMS than saving the 64K Page Frame. QEMM takes advantage of EMS memory and usually will create more free RAM in the lower 1M address space than the 64KB required for EMS. QEMM StealthROM, SqueezeFrame, and Stealth D*Space all require EMS to work by mapping ROM and data buffers into EMS, thus freeing more UMB's. QEMM's TechNote FRAME.TEC states: \\"Thus any advice to remove the page frame is penny-wise and pound-foolish. Remember that the page frame is 64K of address space that can be used any program, at any time, to access effectively as much memory as it likes. Some view the page frame as 64K of address space that could be used to hold up 64K of programs, but it is much more useful to consider the page frame as a place to access up to 32 megabytes of code and/or data for the programs that use it.\\"Quarterdeck Expanded Memory Manager QEMM 8.03 and QEMM 97 , TechNote FRAME.TEC. =Example: 635K Free, shared 256MB XMS/256MB EMS= DOS=HIGH,UMB device=C:\\\\QEMM\\\\dosdata.sys device=C:\\\\QEMM\\\\qemm386.sys R:1 RAM UR=1M-256M ST:M I=b000-b7ff X=f000-ffff device=C:\\\\QEMM\\\\dos-up.sys @C:\\\\QEMM\\\\dos-up.dat shell=C:\\\\QEMM\\\\loadhi.com /R:2 C:\\\\command.com C:\\\\ /P /E:1024 Note: If using VMware, then replace the qemm386.sys line with device=C:\\\\QEMM\\\\qemm386.sys R:1 RAM UR=1M-256M X=e800-e900 =Skipping QEMM386 while booting= Hold ALT key during boot and qemm386.sys will not load but prompt to hit Esc to skip loading. Alternatively, hold F5 so DOS skips loading all of config.sys + autoexec.bat or hold F8 so DOS prompt Y/N to confirm each line in config.sys and autoexec.bat; allowing you to skip loading qemm386.sys, dos-up, dosdata, etc. May help while testing new configuration that lead to system lockups. Holding ALT or pressing F5/F8 during boot might be the saving touch! DOS equivalents Microsoft released comparable but simpler memory managers of its own - HIMEM.SYS for XMS and EMM386.EXE for EMS with MS-DOS 4.01 in 1989; earlier Windows/386 2.1 included a built-in EMM which offered EMS to DOS windows during Windows sessions only. These versions could not yet create Upper Memory Blocks. Digital Research's DR DOS 5.0 (1990) was the first non- vendor-specific DOS to offer the UMB technology, incorporating a 386-mode XMS/EMS manager also called EMM386. It could also allocate some of the video memory or EMS memory as UMB memory. MS-DOS finally offered UMBs in 1991 with version 5.0. MS-DOS's EMM386 required HIMEM to be loaded first, while DR-DOS's EMM386 fulfilled both roles and did not need a separate XMS driver, which was still provided but only needed on 80286-based machines (originally named HIDOS.SYS, later HIMEM.SYS). If an XMS driver was loaded before DR-DOS EMM386, it would use this instead of the built-in XMS manager. Using an external and possibly customized XMS driver could help overcome issues with BIOS memory reporting functions causing the memory manager not to see all available memory, and on machines using non-standard gate-A20 switching methods, whereas using the internal XMS driver EMM386 could take advantage of speed-optimized 32-bit code for the XMS driver and relocate all but a tiny stub of the XMS driver into Extended Memory. DR-DOS EMM386 could fill \\"free\\" areas with UMBs or map RAM over unused ROM areas in virtual mode, provide support for DPMI (and - in some special issues - DPMS), and load the support for pre-emptive multitasking and multithreading components of the operating system. Windows transition / Decline of QEMM While popular when DOS programs were the mainstream, QEMM eventually became largely irrelevant as Windows programs replaced DOS programs for most users. Also, some of the DOS users switched to operating systems unsupported by QEMM, such as Windows NT series and Linux. The final version was QEMM 97, which was compatible with Windows 95 and later Windows 98/ME, but by this point, not only was DOS memory management no longer in high demand, but the remaining competitive DOS applications (including various GNU utilities and text editors) supported EMS, XMS, or DPMI - which reduced demand for conventional memory - or had been ported to Windows 95 or higher. The availability of increasing RAM sizes at low cost served to reduce the need of MagnaRAM. Finally, modern PCI chipsets provide documented functionality to remove write protection from unused UMA; in many or most cases, this last fact eliminates the need for QEMM for even those relatively few users who use DOS applications and who might otherwise find QEMM essential.

Weak keys usually represent a very small fraction of the overall keyspace, which usually means that, if one generates a random key to encrypt a message, weak keys are very unlikely to give rise to a security problem. Nevertheless, it is considered desirable for a cipher to have no weak keys. A cipher with no weak keys is said to have a flat, or linear, key space.  Historical origins  Virtually all rotor-based cipher machines (from 1925 onwards) have implementation flaws that lead to a substantial number of weak keys being created. Some machines have more problems with weak keys than others, as modern block and stream ciphers do. The first stream cipher machines, that were also rotor machines had some of the same problems of weak keys as the more traditional rotor machines. The T52 was one such stream cipher machine that had weak key problems. The British first detected T52 traffic in Summer and Autumn of 1942. One link was between Sicily and Libya, codenamed \\"Sturgeon\\", and another from the Aegean to Sicily, codenamed \\"Mackerel\\". Operators of both links were in the habit of enciphering several messages with the same machine settings, producing large numbers of depths. There were several (mostly incompatible) versions of the T52: the T52a and T52b (which differed only in their electrical noise suppression), T52c, T52d and T52e. While the T52a/b and T52c were cryptologically weak, the last two were more advanced devices; the movement of the wheels was intermittent, the decision on whether or not to advance them being controlled by logic circuits which took as input data from the wheels themselves. In addition, a number of conceptual flaws (including very subtle ones) had been eliminated. One such flaw was the ability to reset the keystream to a fixed point, which led to key reuse by undisciplined machine operators. Weak keys in DES The block cipher DES has a few specific keys termed \\"weak keys\\" and \\"semi-weak keys\\". These are keys that cause the encryption mode of DES to act identically to the decryption mode of DES (albeit potentially that of a different key). In operation, the secret 56-bit key is broken up into 16 subkeys according to the DES key schedule; one subkey is used in each of the sixteen DES rounds. DES weak keys produce sixteen identical subkeys. This occurs when the key (expressed in hexadecimal) is:FIPS, Guidelines for Implementing and Using the NBS Data Encryption Standard, FIPS-PUB 74, http://www.itl.nist.gov/fipspubs/fip74.htm * Alternating ones + zeros (0x0101010101010101) * Alternating 'F' + 'E' (0xFEFEFEFEFEFEFEFE) * '0xE0E0E0E0F1F1F1F1' * '0x1F1F1F1F0E0E0E0E' If an implementation does not consider the parity bits, the corresponding keys with the inverted parity bits may also work as weak keys: * all zeros (0x0000000000000000) * all ones (0xFFFFFFFFFFFFFFFF) * '0xE1E1E1E1F0F0F0F0' * '0x1E1E1E1E0F0F0F0F' Using weak keys, the outcome of the Permuted Choice 1 (PC-1) in the DES key schedule leads to round keys being either all zeros, all ones or alternating zero-one patterns. Since all the subkeys are identical, and DES is a Feistel network, the encryption function is self-inverting; that is, despite encrypting once giving a secure-looking cipher text, encrypting twice produces the original plaintext. DES also has semi-weak keys, which only produce two different subkeys, each used eight times in the algorithm: This means they come in pairs K1 and K2, and they have the property that: :E_{K_1}(E_{K_2}(M))=M where EK(M) is the encryption algorithm encrypting message M with key K. There are six semi-weak key pairs: * 0x011F011F010E010E and 0x1F011F010E010E01 * 0x01E001E001F101F1 and 0xE001E001F101F101 * 0x01FE01FE01FE01FE and 0xFE01FE01FE01FE01 * 0x1FE01FE00EF10EF1 and 0xE01FE01FF10EF10E * 0x1FFE1FFE0EFE0EFE and 0xFE1FFE1FFE0EFE0E * 0xE0FEE0FEF1FEF1FE and 0xFEE0FEE0FEF1FEF1 There are also 48 possibly weak keys that produce only four distinct subkeys (instead of 16). They can be found in a NIST publication.NIST, Recommendation for the Triple Data Encryption Algorithm (TDEA) Block Cipher, Special Publication 800-67, page 14 These weak and semi- weak keys are not considered \\"fatal flaws\\" of DES. There are 256 (7.21 √ó 1016, about 72 quadrillion) possible keys for DES, of which four are weak and twelve are semi-weak. This is such a tiny fraction of the possible keyspace that users do not need to worry. If they so desire, they can check for weak or semi-weak keys when the keys are generated. They are very few, and easy to recognize. Note, however, that currently DES is no longer recommended for general use since all DES keys can be brute-forced it's been decades since the Deep Crack machine was cracking them on the order of days, and as computers tend to do, more recent solutions are vastly cheaper on that time scale. Examples of progress are in Deep Crack's article. List of algorithms with weak keys * DES, as detailed above. * RC4. RC4's weak initialization vectors allow an attacker to mount a known-plaintext attack and have been widely used to compromise the security of WEP.Fluhrer, S., Mantin, I., Shamir, A. Weaknesses in the key scheduling algorithm of RC4. Eighth Annual Workshop on Selected Areas in Cryptography (August 2001), http://citeseer.ist.psu.edu/fluhrer01weaknesses.html * IDEA. IDEA's weak keys are identifiable in a chosen-plaintext attack. They make the relationship between the XOR sum of plaintext bits and ciphertext bits predictable. There is no list of these keys, but they can be identified by their \\"structure\\". * Blowfish. Blowfish's weak keys produce bad S-boxes, since Blowfish's S-boxes are key-dependent. There is a chosen plaintext attack against a reduced-round variant of Blowfish that is made easier by the use of weak keys. This is not a concern for full 16-round Blowfish. * GMAC. Frequently used in the AES-GCM construction. Weak keys can be identified by the group order of the authentication key H (for AES-GCM, H is derived from the encryption key by encrypting the zero block). * RSA and DSA. August 2012 Nadia Heninger, Zakir Durumeric, Eric Wustrow, J. Alex Halderman found that TLS certificates they assessed share keys due to insufficient entropy during key generation, and were able to obtain DSA and RSA private keys of TLS and SSH hosts knowing only the public key. No weak keys as a design goal The goal of having a 'flat' keyspace (i.e., all keys equally strong) is always a cipher design goal. As in the case of DES, sometimes a small number of weak keys is acceptable, provided that they are all identified or identifiable. An algorithm that has unknown weak keys does not inspire much trust. The two main countermeasures against inadvertently using a weak key: * Checking generated keys against a list of known weak keys, or building rejection of weak keys into the key scheduling. * When the number of weak keys is known to be very small (in comparison to the size of the keyspace), generating a key uniformly at random ensures that the probability of it being weak is a (known) very small number. A large number of weak keys is a serious flaw in any cipher design, since there will then be a (perhaps too) large chance that a randomly generated one will be a weak one, compromising the security of messages encrypted under it. It will also take longer to check randomly generated keys for weakness in such cases, which will tempt shortcuts in interest of 'efficiency'. However, weak keys are much more often a problem where the adversary has some control over what keys are used, such as when a block cipher is used in a mode of operation intended to construct a secure cryptographic hash function (e.g. Davies‚ÄìMeyer).

She is a correspondent working for BBC News and is currently based in South America. Early life and career Guerin was born in Dublin and attended a convent school. A journalism graduate from Dublin Institute of Technology (DIT), she qualified in 1985 with a Certificate in Journalism from the College of Commerce in Dublin. She also holds a master's degree in Film Studies from University College Dublin (UCD). Guerin began her career working for newspapers in Dublin such as the Sunday Tribune. Guerin joined RT√â News in 1987 and became its youngest foreign correspondent when she was sent to Eastern Europe at the age of 23 in 1990. She remained at RT√â until 1994, additionally reporting from central Europe, the former Soviet Union, Yugoslavia and Sarajevo. Guerin's reports from eastern Europe for RT√â Radio won her a Jacob's Award in 1992. She left RT√â to run as an Irish Labour Party candidate in the 1994 European Parliament elections. A political novice, Guerin had been hand-picked by then Labour Party leader Dick Spring. Even though she was not selected at the party convention, Spring insisted that she be added to the ballot. She did not win a seat, although she polled seventh of 15 candidates with 6% of the vote. BBC career Guerin joined the BBC in 1995. She was based in Los Angeles from January 1996 and became the corporation's Southern Europe correspondent in July 1996 and was based in Rome until June 2000. During this period, Guerin reported from Kosovo, the Republic of Macedonia and the Basque Country in northern Spain. In the second half of 2000, Guerin was based in Moscow, and covered the Kursk submarine disaster in 2000. Regularly reporting from war zones, in 2002 Guerin told Evening Standard contributor Quentin Letts about having to wear appropriate clothing: Guerin was appointed the BBC's Jerusalem correspondent in January 2001. At the beginning of April 2002, the BBC made an official complaint to the Israeli government after Israeli soldiers fired in the direction of Guerin and her team, forcing them to find cover, while they were recording a peaceful demonstration in Bethlehem in the West Bank. Almost exactly two years later, the Israeli government wrote to the BBC accusing her of a \\"deep-seated bias against Israel\\" in a report on a teenage would-be suicide bomber. The BBC defended Guerin's reporting. Caroline Hawley succeeded her as the BBC's correspondent in Jerusalem. In December 2005, the BBC told Broadcast magazine that Guerin had spent two years longer in the Jerusalem posting than the normal three-year rotation usual for its correspondents. Former Director General of the BBC Greg Dyke wrote: \\"I have no doubt that the decision by the BBC to pull their Middle East correspondent Orla Guerin out of the region and send her to South Africa was part of the normal rotation of BBC news correspondents around the world. However, it was pretty bad timing to announce it within days of Director General Mark Thompson's visit to Israel where he had a meeting with the Israeli Prime Minister Ariel Sharon\\". She became the BBC's Africa correspondent, based in Johannesburg, in January 2006. After this, Guerin was the BBC's correspondent based in Islamabad, Pakistan. In October 2015, former BBC chairman Lord Grade wrote to James Harding, the Head of BBC News, criticising Guerin's Middle East reporting. In the letter, which was published in The Jewish Chronicle, Grade faulted her reporting for assuming \\"equivalence\\" between Israel and the Palestinians. According to Grade: \\"it was improper of the correspondent to claim that 'there's no sign of involvement by militant groups', before immediately showing footage of Palestinian Islamic Jihad (PIJ) banners at the home of a 19-year-old terrorist who carried out a deadly knife attack at Lion's Gate in Jerusalem on October 3\\". On 23 February 2018, Guerin published an investigative report titled 'The shadow over Egypt', where she reported the alleged forced disappearance of Egyptian Nationals, including a young female called Zubeida, whose mother claimed was kidnapped by security forces in April 2017. On 26 February 2018 a live interview was broadcast on Egyptian ON TV network, where Zubeida and her husband were interviewed by Amr Adib, a prominent pro-regime reporter. The interview revealed that Zubeida had been estranged from her mother since April 2017, got married and had just had a baby just two weeks prior to the BBC report. However, on 27 February 2018, Zubeida's mother stated in a live phone- in interview with the Istanbul-based opposition Mekameleen TV station that she stood with all her previous claims and implied that Zubeida was under duress to perform the interview. On 28 February 2018, reports emerged that Zubeida's mother was arrested by the Egyptian security forces In 2019, she was the BBC correspondent in Caracas, the Venezuelan capital, during the 2019 Venezuelan presidential crisis and protests. In January 2020, Guerin's reporting from the Yad Vashem Center in Jerusalem on the 75th anniversary of the liberation of Auschwitz caused controversy, being criticised for appearing to link the Israeli‚ÄìPalestinian conflict to the Holocaust. Over footage of Israeli troops visiting the Center, she said, \\"The state of Israel is now a regional power. For decades, it has occupied Palestinian territories. But some here will always see their nation through the prism of persecution and survival.\\" She was accused of antisemitism, and of inserting her personal bias against Israel into the Holocaust Memorial ceremony, without relevance to what the report was about. The Campaign Against Antisemitism made a complaint to the BBC and threatened to make a report to Ofcom. Honours and awards In 2002 Guerin won the Broadcaster of the Year award from the London Press Club. In 2003 she was awarded the News and Factual Award by Women in Film and Television UK. She was awarded an MBE (Honorary) for services to broadcasting in 2005. =Honorary degrees= In 2002, she was awarded an honorary degree from the University of Essex,. In 2009, she was awarded honorary degrees from both of Northern Ireland's universities, Queen's University Belfast and the University of Ulster. In 2014 she was awarded an honorary degree by the University of Bradford. In November 2019, Guerin was awarded an honorary degree by NUI Galway.

To read about the background to these events, see history of the Faroe Islands. 7th century *About 625 ‚Äì It was thought Irish monks settled in the Faroe Islands and were the first people there. In earlier historical studies, it was assumed, that they came around 725. After botanical researches it had to be dated back to 675, and today Faroese scientists believe, that oats have been cultivated on the Faroes since about 625, for example in Mykines. 8th century *About 795 ‚Äì Irish monks reach Iceland. It is suggested, that they came from the Faroes after banished by the Vikings. Diucil refers to it 825, but maybe some of the monks stayed in the Faroes. 9th century *About 825 ‚Äì Gr√≠mur Kamban is said to be the first Norse settler in the Faroes at the place, which is named Funningur (the find). *About 885‚Äì890 ‚Äì Second wave of immigration to the Faroes under king Harald H√•rfagre of Norway. Most of the settlers come from western Norway, but also many from Ireland and Scotland. 10th century *Around 900 ‚Äì The Faroese Althing is assumed to be founded. If this is true, it is the oldest existing parliament of the world. *Around 970 ‚Äì The F√¶reyinga saga starts with its main story.

The Viking age on the Faroes is over. 12th century *Around 1100 ‚Äì The Faroes become the Diocese of the Faroe Islands, initially suffragan to the archbishopric of Hamburg-Bremen. The Faroese bishop has his seat in Kirkjub√∏ur until 1538. *Around 1104 ‚Äì The diocese comes under the archbishopric of Lund, (today Sweden). *1152/53 ‚Äì The diocese becomes part of the archbishopric in Nidaros, Norway. *1156 ‚Äì Sverre comes to the Faroes in the age of 5 for further education in Kirkjub√∏ur.

It is a plain-text batch file in the root directory of the boot device. The name of the file is an abbreviation of \\"automatic execution\\", which describes its function in automatically executing commands on system startup; the filename was coined in response to the 8.3 filename limitations of the FAT file system family. Usage \`AUTOEXEC.BAT\` is read upon startup by all versions of DOS, including MS-DOS version 7.x as used in Windows 95 and Windows 98. Windows ME only parses environment variables as part of its attempts to reduce legacy dependencies, but this can be worked around. The filename was also used by (DCP), an MS-DOS derivative by the former East- German VEB Robotron. In Korean versions of MS-DOS/PC DOS 4.01 and higher (except for PC DOS 7 and 2000), if the current country code is set to 82 (for Korea) and no \`/P:filename\` is given and no default \`AUTOEXEC.BAT\` is found, \`COMMAND.COM\` will look for a file named \`KAUTOEXE.BAT\` instead in order to ensure that the DBCS frontend drivers will be loaded even without properly set up \`CONFIG.SYS\` and \`AUTOEXEC.BAT\` files. Under DOS, the file is executed by the primary copy of the command-line processor (typically \`COMMAND.COM\`) once the operating system has booted and the \`CONFIG.SYS\` file processing has finished. While DOS by itself provides no means to pass batch file parameters to \`COMMAND.COM\` for \`AUTOEXEC.BAT\` processing, the alternative command-line processor 4DOS supports a \`4DOS.INI\` \`AutoExecParams\` directive and \`//AutoExecParams=\` startup option to define such parameters. Under Concurrent DOS, Multiuser DOS and REAL/32, three initial parameters will be passed to either the corresponding \`STARTxxy.BAT\` (if it exists) or the generic \`AUTOEXEC.BAT\` startup file, \`%1\` holds the virtual console number, \`%2\` the 2-digit terminal number (xx) (with 00 being the main console) and \`%3\` the 1-digit session number (y). Windows NT and its descendants Windows XP and Windows Vista parse \`AUTOEXEC.BAT\` when a user logs on. As with Windows ME, anything other than setting environment variables is ignored. Unlike \`CONFIG.SYS\`, the commands in \`AUTOEXEC.BAT\` can be entered at the interactive command line interpreter. They are just standard commands that the computer operator wants to be executed automatically whenever the computer is started, and can include other batch files. \`AUTOEXEC.BAT\` is most often used to set environment variables such as keyboard, soundcard, printer, and temporary file locations. It is also used to initiate low level system utilities, such as the following: * Virus scanners * Disk caching software * Mouse drivers * Keyboard drivers * CD drivers * Miscellaneous other drivers Example In early versions of DOS, \`AUTOEXEC.BAT\` was by default very simple. The \`DATE\` and \`TIME\` commands were necessary as early PC and XT class machines did not have a battery backed-up real-time clock as default. @ECHO OFF CLS DATE TIME VER In non-US environments, the keyboard driver (like \`KEYB FR\` for the French keyboard) was also included. Later versions were often much expanded with numerous third-party device drivers. The following is a basic DOS 5 type \`AUTOEXEC.BAT\` configuration, consisting only of essential commands: @ECHO OFF PROMPT $P$G PATH C:\\\\DOS;C:\\\\WINDOWS SET TEMP=C:\\\\TEMP SET BLASTER=A220 I7 D1 T2 LH SMARTDRV.EXE LH DOSKEY LH MOUSE.COM /Y This configuration sets common environment variables, loads a disk cache, places common directories into the default PATH, and initializes the DOS mouse / keyboard drivers. The \`PROMPT\` command sets the prompt to \\"C:\\\\>\\" (when the working directory is the root of the C drive) instead of simply \\"C>\\" (the default prompt, indicating only the working drive and not the directory therein). In general, device drivers were loaded in \`CONFIG.SYS\`, and programs were loaded in the \`AUTOEXEC.BAT\` file. Some devices, such as mice, could be loaded either as a device driver in \`CONFIG.SYS\`, or as a TSR in \`AUTOEXEC.BAT\`, depending upon the manufacturer. In MS-DOS 6.0 and higher, a DOS boot menu is configurable. This can be of great help to users who wish to have optimized boot configurations for various programs, such as DOS games and Windows. @ECHO OFF PROMPT $P$G PATH C:\\\\DOS;C:\\\\WINDOWS SET TEMP=C:\\\\TEMP SET BLASTER=A220 I7 D1 T2 GOTO %CONFIG% :WIN LH SMARTDRV.EXE LH MOUSE.COM /Y WIN GOTO END :XMS LH SMARTDRV.EXE LH DOSKEY GOTO END :END The \`GOTO %CONFIG%\` line informs DOS to look up menu entries that were defined within \`CONFIG.SYS\`. Then, these profiles are named here and configured with the desired specific drivers and utilities. At the desired end of each specific configuration, a \`GOTO\` command redirects DOS to the \`:END\` section. Lines after \`:END\` will be used by all profiles. Dual- booting DOS and Windows 9x When installing Windows 95 over a preexisting DOS/Windows install, \`CONFIG.SYS\` and \`AUTOEXEC.BAT\` are renamed to \`CONFIG.DOS\` and \`AUTOEXEC.DOS\`. This is intended to ease dual booting between Windows 9x and DOS. When booting into DOS, they are temporarily renamed \`CONFIG.SYS\` and \`AUTOEXEC.BAT\`. Backups of the Windows 9x versions are made as \`.W40\` files. Windows 9x also installs \`MSDOS.SYS\`, a configuration file, which will not boot Windows 95/98 if parameter\`BOOTGUI=0\` is loaded, and instead a DOS prompt will appear on the screen (Windows can still be loaded by calling the \`WIN\` command (file WIN.COM). This file contains some switches that designate how the system will boot, one of which controls whether or not the system automatically goes into Windows. This \\"BootGUI\\" option must be set to \\"0\\" in order to boot to a DOS prompt. By doing this, the system's operation essentially becomes that of a DOS/Windows pairing like with earlier Windows versions. Windows can be started as desired by typing \`WIN\` at the DOS prompt. When installing Caldera DR-DOS 7.02 and higher, the Windows version retains the name \`AUTOEXEC.BAT\`, while the file used by the DR-DOS \`COMMAND.COM\` is named \`AUTODOS7.BAT\`, referred to by the startup parameter \`/P:filename.ext\` in the SHELL directive. It also differentiates the \`CONFIG.SYS\` file by using the name \`DCONFIG.SYS\`.  OS/2  The equivalent to \`AUTOEXEC.BAT\` under OS/2 is the OS/2 \`STARTUP.CMD\` file, however, genuine DOS sessions booted under OS/2 continue to use \`AUTOEXEC.BAT\`.  Windows NT On Windows NT and its derivatives, Windows 2000, Windows Server 2003 and Windows XP, the equivalent file is called \`AUTOEXEC.NT\` and is located in the \`%SystemRoot%\\\\system32\` directory. The file is not used during the operating system boot process; it is executed when the MS-DOS environment is started, which occurs when a DOS application is loaded. The \`AUTOEXEC.BAT\` file may often be found on Windows NT in the root directory of the boot drive. Windows only considers the \`SET\` and \`PATH\` statements which it contains, in order to define environment variables global to all users. Setting environment variables through this file may be interesting if for example MS-DOS is also booted from this drive (this requires that the drive be FAT-formatted) or to keep the variables across a reinstall. This is an exotic usage today so the file usually remains empty. The Tweak UI applet from the Microsoft PowerToys collection allows to control this feature (Parse AUTOEXEC.BAT at logon).

It was discovered on 2 March 1981, by American astronomer Schelte Bus at the Siding Spring Observatory in Australia. The likely S-type asteroid has an unsecured rotation period of 12 hours. It was named for American screenwriter Gene Roddenberry.  Orbit and classification  Roddenberry is a core member of the Nysa family (), a very large family of stony asteroids, alternatively known as Herta family. It is part of the Nysa‚ÄìPolana complex, the largest grouping of asteroids in the main-belt. The complex is typically further divided into subfamilies with different spectral properties. The asteroid orbits the Sun in the inner asteroid belt at a distance of 1.8‚Äì2.9 AU once every 3 years and 8 months (1,334 days; semi-major axis of 2.37 AU). Its orbit has an eccentricity of 0.22 and an inclination of 2¬∞ with respect to the ecliptic. The body's observation arc begins with a precovery taken at Palomar Observatory in February 1977, or four years prior to its official discovery observation at Siding Spring.  Physical characteristics  Roddenberry is an assumed stony S-type asteroid, typical for core members of the Nysa family and in agreement with its high albedo (see below). = Rotation period = In the 1990s, a fragmentary rotational lightcurve of Roddenberry was obtained from photometric observations by Richard Binzel. Lightcurve analysis gave a highly uncertain rotation period of 12 hours with a brightness amplitude of 0.14 magnitude (). As of 2018, no secure period has been obtained. = Diameter and albedo = According to the survey carried out by the NEOWISE mission of NASA's Wide-field Infrared Survey Explorer, Roddenberry measures 3.622 kilometers in diameter and its surface has an albedo of 0.193, while the Collaborative Asteroid Lightcurve Link assumes a standard albedo for stony asteroids of 0.20, and derives a diameter of 3.56 kilometers based on an absolute magnitude of 14.61.  Naming  This minor planet was named in memory of famous American screenwriter, producer and futurist, Gene Roddenberry (1921‚Äì1991), known for the Star Trek and Star Trek: The Next Generation television series, and for the Star Trek film franchise. The official naming citation was published by the Minor Planet Center on 18 February 1992 ().

He was the editor of The Irish Times between 1986 and 2002. Early life Brady was born in Dublin and spent his early childhood in Tullamore in County Offaly, Ireland. He received his primary education at St. Columba's Christian Brothers College, in Tullamore; his secondary education was at the Cistercian College, Roscrea in County Tipperary. At University College Dublin (UCD) he took primary and postgraduate degrees in history and politics. While at UCD he also edited Campus UCD News, one of the college's two newspapers. Press career He was the editor of the Sunday Tribune and worked both on radio and television with RTE before assuming the Editorship of the prestigious The Irish Times in 1986. The fact that he was the first Catholic to be appointed as editor of what was still perceived as a Protestant-oriented newspaper was remarked upon at the time and was seen as part of a process of The Irish Times seeking to broaden its position in Irish society. He was also the first editor to be appointed at the newspaper after a competitive interview process with the participation of staff representatives. Previously he had been Features Editor, then Night Editor and latterly Deputy Editor. He reported on crime and security and covered events in Northern Ireland before being assigned to the London bureau in the 1970s. Later he worked on the newspaper's European Desk and on a number of assignments abroad, including the accession of new member states to the European Economic Community. He reported on the conflict in Rhodesia, later Zimbabwe. He was appointed as a director of The Irish Times Ltd in 1985. Brady was judged to be an excellent editor who increased the newspapers circulation figures to their highest levels over two decades. He positioned the newspaper firmly behind the Northern Ireland peace process while strongly supporting the liberal reform agenda in the Republic. He focused on developing coverage of foreign news with the establishment of overseas bureaux in Moscow, Beijing, South Africa and elsewhere. He also extended the coverage of arts and books as well as finance and sport. The Irish Times launched its first digital editions during his tenure. He was chair of the World Editors Forum (Paris) 1996‚Äì2000 and chair of the Advisory Committee to the European Journalism Centre (Maastricht) 1996‚Äì1999. He retired from The Irish Times in 2002, after implementing an editorial restructuring of the organisation, necessitated by an accumulation of high costs and a fall in advertising revenues. Editorial numbers dropped by more than 100 as journalists opted for redundancy terms. There was some staff criticism of the parting package agreed between Brady and the company, with some claims that it was over-generous at a time of financial challenge for the organisation. However, The Irish Times subsequently went into a lengthy period of marked financial success, with reduced costs, strong revenues and free of debt. He published his autobiography, entitled Up with The Times, in 2005. Between 2014 and 2019 he wrote a weekly column for the Irish edition of The Sunday Times. Academia Brady was a Visiting Professor at John Jay College, City University of New York; Senior Teaching Fellow at Michael Smurfit Graduate School of Business, and University College Dublin.

It is named after the perfectly gridlike, closely laid out roads called Avenues (numbers, 1st - 18th) and Streets (letters, A - V). First surveyed in the 1850s, the Avenues became Salt Lake City's first neighborhood. Today, the Avenues neighborhood is generally considered younger, more progressive, and somewhat \\"artsy\\" when compared to other neighborhoods. Many young professionals choose to live there due to the culture and easy commute to downtown.. It is also one of the most important strongholds of the Democratic political party in Utah. Layout and geography Map of the Avenues. The Avenues neighborhood lies on the \\"north east bench\\" of the Wasatch Mountains in Salt Lake City. The southern boundary of the Avenues is South Temple Street (1st Avenue is the next street north). Heading north, the Avenues neighborhood is built up onto the lower slopes of the mountains. The north-south roads in the Avenues, which slope up the hillside, begin at Canyon Road and then are lettered from \\"A\\" to \\"U\\" Street and then \\"Virginia Street\\", from west to east. The fairly level east-west roads are numbered 1st to 18th Avenues heading northward from South Temple Street. The rigid grid system breaks down around 13th Avenue, as more recent developments farther north have taken a more serpentine bend. The 'major' streets used more for through-traffic, particularly for their connections at South Temple Street to city arteries, are B, E, I, and Virginia; the 'major' avenues are 2nd, 3rd, 6th, 11th, and 13th. The Avenues lie just northeast of downtown Salt Lake City and just east--over City Creek Canyon--from Capitol Hill. The neighborhood to the east of the lower (below 11th) Avenues, known as Federal Heights, is traditionally thought of as beginning north of South Temple Street and East of Virginia Street. While physically part of the Avenues, the Federal Heights neighborhood may be considered as generally more affluent than the Avenues, with larger, more stately homes. To the north of Federal Heights is a more recently developed area called Arlington Hills. Compared to the neighborhoods to the east, the Avenues are in places quite steep as they climb the foothills to the north. The large Salt Lake City Cemetery occupies a significant portion of the eastern Avenues below 11th Avenue and abuts Lindsey Gardens (park). To the north of 11th Avenue is the 11th Avenue Park, west of Terrace Hills, a major north-south street leading into the upper Avenues. The \\"lower Avenues\\" (below 11th or 13th) is a neighborhood of mostly older Victorian-era houses, at one time popular with younger homeowners looking for affordable \\"fixer-uppers\\". In recent years a large renovation boom has swept the area. As fixer-uppers are diminishing, it has become less affordable to the younger crowd. There are numerous apartment buildings dotting the lower Avenues also. The Avenues is also especially popular due to its proximity to downtown, the large and remote Memory Grove/City Creek Canyon recreation area to the west, the University of Utah to the east/southeast, and the airport, as well as low traffic and minimal commercial development. The more significant non-residential developments are a supermarket with a few small shops and a State Liquor Store comprising the block between E and F Streets and 5th and 6th Avenue, a few small businesses throughout the Avenues, and the LDS Hospital complex comprising the blocks of 7th Avenue to 9th Avenue between C and D Streets, with additional doctors offices between 9th and 10th Avenue between C and D Streets. Shriners Hospital for Children is located on the east side of Virginia Street bordering 11th Avenue. Popperton Park is at the northeast corner of Virginia and 11th Avenue. A small city library branch is at 9th Avenue and F Street. There are several schools and churches within the Avenues, as well as a large funeral home and mausoleum on the north side of 11th Avenue just west of Virginia street. The Ronald McDonald House is on the north side of South Temple between M and N Streets, where it will soon expand with buildings along the entire block facing South Temple. Other office buildings are found on the north side of South Temple between A Street and Virginia. History The Avenues was the first section of Salt Lake City to deviate from the original ten acre (40,000 m¬≤) block grid pattern. Blocks were one half the dimension of the original grid, making them 2.5 acres (10,000 m¬≤). Streets and sidewalks were narrower too, meaning that the Avenues' streets match poorly to the original blocks at the base of the neighborhood along South Temple Street. The first lots were surveyed in the early 1850s, but the Avenues' deviant platting violated the law. The territorial legislature had to pass a new survey ordinance for the Avenues, which they did in 1860. Originally, all of the streets were named. North-south streets were named for trees, and east-west streets had names like \\"Fruit\\", \\"Garden\\", \\"Bluff\\", and \\"Wall\\" (for what are now 2nd through 5th avenue respectively). By 1885 the north-south streets gained their current alphabetical designations (A Street through V Street, although V was turned into Virginia Street). However, the east-west streets were still known as Streets. They were not retitled into Avenues until 1907. Up until that time, the area was known as \\"the dry bench\\" because it lacked water. Until 1884, residents in the northeastern Avenues had to haul water for everyday use. Protests prompted the city to install pipelines along 6th Avenue, but those living in the higher Avenues would be without water until 1908. In spite of water problems, the Avenues proved to be an attractive residential neighborhood. In the southwest Avenues, artisans could live very close to downtown. In the east Avenues, \\"Butcherville\\" sprang up after slaughterhouses relocated to the east side in 1860. Cathedral of the Madeleine on the perimeter of the Avenues in 1908. Note electric trolley car Transportation was a major draw for settlement in the Avenues. The Salt Lake Railway Company offered mule and horse-drawn trolley rides in the Avenues by 1872, and the trolleys became electric in 1889. Salt Lake Rapid Transit Company incorporated in 1890 and the companies competed fiercely until merging in 1903. The trolley system expanded to other parts of the city as the Utah Light and Traction Company, but rail lines were denser in the Avenues than any other part of the city save downtown. The tracks were removed in the 1940s after National City Lines acquired (and dismantled) the trolley lines. At the turn of the century, the neighborhood was a predominantly middle- and upper-middle class trolley suburb, home to many professionals. Developers, including future president of The Church of Jesus Christ of Latter-day Saints (LDS Church) Heber J. Grant, promoted Avenues home ownership. The old Primary Children's Hospital was located in the avenues. With the rise of other, more affluent neighborhoods like Federal Heights, the Avenues became less popular. By the 1960s, deterioration was evident as landlords often found it economically advantageous to let properties go neglected. Most homes, built between about 1880 and 1920, showed their age, and the community dealt with increasing problems with transients. In response to these problems, residents formed the Greater Avenues Community Council (GACC) to help revitalize and restore livability to the neighborhood. Today the neighborhood has been revitalized and is considered by many to be one of Salt Lake's most desirable neighborhoods. Avenues Historic District The Avenues Historic District is a historic district that was listed on the National Register of Historic Places in 1980. It included 143 contributing buildings and one contributing site, Brigham Young's Grave., with 470 pages including Utah State Historical Society sheets for many individual properties, and The Barlow House, a brick Queen Anne style house in the district, has a twin that was built out in a rural area, the Amanda Conk Best House in Millcreek, Utah, also NRHP-listed. and Also the Arthur O. Clark House at 1059 East 3rd Avenue, built in 1895, is a mirror copy of the Oscar M. Booth House, built in 1893 in Nephi, Utah by carpenter Oscar M. Booth.

He is the German friend and blood brother of Winnetou, the fictional chief of the Mescalero tribe of the Apache. He is the main character in the Eurowestern by the same name from 1964, starring Lex Barker.  Characterisation  Old Shatterhand is the alter ego of Karl May, and May himself maintained that he experienced all the adventures in person, even though in fact he did not visit America until after he wrote most of his well- known Western stories, and never traveled west of Buffalo, NY. Most of the stories are written from a first person perspective, and Winnetou often calls Old Shatterhand my brother Scharli ('Scharli' being a German phonetic approximation of 'Charlie', and ultimately meaning Karl in German). May also wrote stories about the same character traveling the Orient, where he is known as Kara Ben Nemsi. May attached the prefix Old to the names of several of his characters, considering it to be typically American and a sign of the characters' great experience. In the stories, Old Shatterhand is given the name by his friend Sam Hawkens (who also originates from Germany but is already an old-timer in the American West), as he was able to knock his opponents unconscious with a single punch from his fist aimed at the head (specifically the temple). B√§rent√∂ter (center), the Henrystutzen (right) and the Silberb√ºchse (left), in the Karl May Museum. Old Shatterhand owns two famous rifles, the B√§rent√∂ter (Bear Killer) and the Henrystutzen (Henry carbine), both made by a fictional gunsmith called Henry in St. Louis (based on gunsmith Benjamin Tyler Henry 1821‚Äì1898). The Henrystutzen was able to fire 25 shots without reloading, probably a hyperbolic reference to the Henry rifle. Old Shatterhand rode a horse called Hatatitla (Lightning), which he got from Winnetou, who rode the horse's brother, called Iltschi (meaning Wind). The tales may have been an influence on the creation of the Lone Ranger media franchise.Lone Ranger Radio Broadcasts (The Lone Ranger) , Modesto Radio MuseumThe Road to War: Portraying the Indian, continued..., American Indians in the Great War: Real and Imagined, Diane Camurat, online in the Karl May Gesellschaft website Christian Tramitz parodied Shatterhand as a character called Ranger in the \\"Apahachi and Ranger\\" sketches for Michael Herbig's comedy show Bullyparade and their cinematic adaptation Der Schuh des Manitu.

Old Surehand is another character created by Karl May. Karl May dedicated three volumes to him, who, like Old Shatterhand, is a renowned Western hero and best friends with the Native Americans. Unlike Old Shatterhand, Old Surehand is a half-blood Native himself, though raised in a white family.

He played as a first baseman in Major League Baseball (MLB) for 15 seasons between 1936 and 1953, losing three seasons to military service during World War II. Mize was a ten-time All-Star who played for the St. Louis Cardinals, New York Giants, and the New York Yankees. During his tenure with the Yankees, the team won five consecutive World Series. Mize retired in 1953 with 359 career home runs and a .312 batting average along with 1,118 runs, 2,011 hits, 367 doubles, 83 triples, 1,337 RBI and 856 bases on balls. Defensively, he recorded a .992 fielding percentage as a first baseman. He served as a radio commentator, scout and coach in the major leagues after he retired as a player. He was selected for induction to the Baseball Hall of Fame by the Veterans Committee in 1981. In 2014, he was inducted into the St. Louis Cardinals Hall of Fame Museum. Early life and career Mize was born in Demorest, Georgia to Edward and Emma Mize. After his parents separated, his mother went to Atlanta for work, but Mize remained in Demorest with his grandmother. He excelled in tennis as a child and played on his high school baseball team. He later played baseball for Piedmont College. Mize was a distant cousin of Ty Cobb and his second cousin married Babe Ruth. Mize came up through the St. Louis Cardinals minor league system but was traded to the Cincinnati Reds in 1934. However, he suffered a groin injury and the Reds nullified the trade. In 1935, while struggling with one bad leg, he injured the other leg. Mize retired from baseball and returned home until the Cardinals asked him to see a physician in St. Louis. He had surgery for bone spurs. He was kept with the Cardinals in St. Louis after surgery, as he would not have been able to play regularly that season in the minor leagues anyway. The organization thought that he might get some opportunities to pinch hit with the major league team. Mize made his major league debut for the Cardinals in 1936. In 126 games, Mize hit for a .329 batting average, 19 home runs and 93 runs batted in (RBI). He later said, \\"I'm the only guy who played in the major leagues because I couldn't play in the minors.\\" Early MLB career Mize with the Cardinals Mize was known as both \\"Big Jawn\\" and \\"The Big Cat\\" for his smooth fielding at first base. In 1937 he batted .364, but Cardinals teammate Joe Medwick took the title with a .374 average. He led the league in triples and OPS in 1938. In 1939, Mize finished second in the league's Most Valuable Player (MVP) voting after leading the league with a .349 average and 28 home runs. Mize's 43 home runs in 1940 set a Cardinals team record that stood for nearly 60 years. At the end of the 1941 season, however, Cardinals general manager Branch Rickey, who famously believed in trading players before their skills began to decline, traded Mize to the New York Giants. In exchange for Mize, the Cardinals received Bill Lohrman, Johnny McCarthy, Ken O'Dea, and $50,000. Mize was involved in a 1941 lawsuit against Gum Products Inc. The company manufactured a set of baseball cards called Double Play. Mize sued because he argued that the company did not have his consent to use his image in the card set. Gum Products Inc. won the lawsuit, but the company stopped producing its Double Play series because of the expenses it incurred during the legal proceedings with Mize. The Giants pursued Mize after learning that their first baseman, Babe Young, was going to be forced into military service. In 1942, Mize hit for his lowest batting average to that point in his career (.305), but he hit 26 home runs and led the NL with 110 RBI. Military service and later career Mize spent 1943 through 1945 in military service during World War II. During his service he played for the Great Lakes Naval Station baseball team for service members and new personnel in training. Mize hit 17 home runs in 51 games and batted over .475 while manning first base for the Bluejackets. Other team members included: Phil Rizzuto who belonged to the Yankees; outfielders Sam Chapman, Dom DiMaggio and Barney McCosky; Frankie Pytlak; and Brooklyn shortstop Pee Wee Reese, and Johnny Lipon. The team was considered one of the best WWII era teams assembled. Returning to the Giants in 1946, a broken toe caused him to fall one short of the home run title, won by Ralph Kiner of the Pittsburgh Pirates. In 1947 he rebounded to hit 51 home runs and tie Kiner for the league lead. He also led in runs and RBI, and became the only player to strike out fewer than fifty times while hitting fifty home runs. Mize's 1947 totals in runs, home runs and RBI were all career highs. In 1948, Mize and Kiner again tied for the league home run championship with 40 each. Mize was traded to the New York Yankees late in the 1949 season after expressing discontent with his playing time. Mize during his time with the Yankees. Mize spent the last five years of his career with the Yankees, mostly as a part-time player, ending in 1953. He was, however, considered a valuable contributor to their winning five consecutive American League pennants and World Series titles. Despite spending part of the 1950 season on minor league rehab, he hit 25 home runs to become the second player to have a 25-home run season in both leagues. In the 1952 World Series against the Brooklyn Dodgers, he hit three home runs, one as a pinch-hitter, and was robbed of a fourth by Dodger right fielder Carl Furillo, who made a leaping catch above the fence in the 11th inning to preserve a win for the Dodgers. In October 1953, Mize announced his retirement. He said that he would rather retire while he was still popular with fans than to \\"hang around until they start to boo.\\" Mize holds the major league record for the most times hitting three homers in one game, a feat he performed six times. He also was one of a handful of players (including Babe Ruth) to do it in both leagues ‚Äî five times in the National League and once in the American. He was the first player to hit three home runs in a game twice in one season in 1938 and did it twice again in 1940. He finished his career with 359 home runs. Mize still holds Cardinals team records for most home runs in a season by a left-handed batter, most season RBI by a left hander, and most games with three or more home runs. He and Carl Yastrzemski are the only players to have three seasons of hitting 40 or more home runs, without a season of hitting between 30 and 39 home runs. Later life After his 1953 retirement, Mize worked as a radio commentator, scout and a hitting coach for the Giants (1955‚Äì60). He coached the Kansas City Athletics in 1961. In the 1970s, Mize made his home in St. Augustine, Florida, working for a development by the Deltona Corporation called St. Augustine Shores. A picture of his house is included in David Nolan's book The Houses of St. Augustine. He was chosen by the Veterans Committee of the Baseball Hall of Fame in 1981. He had appeared on the regular Hall of Fame ballot in the 1960s and 1970s, where his highest vote percentage had been 43% in 1971. Mize spent the last few years of his life at his home in Demorest, Georgia. He underwent heart surgery in 1982 but returned to good health. He died in his sleep of cardiac arrest in 1993. Legacy Upon Mize's death, Ralph Kiner described him as \\"kind of an irascible guy\\" on the field, but \\"a very affable guy and a great storyteller\\" off the field. Mize's batting statistics were overshadowed by those of bigger stars of his era such as Ted Williams, Joe DiMaggio, Stan Musial, and Jackie Robinson. Mize's lifetime on-base percentage of .397 has become more appreciated in the light of sabermetric analysis. In January 2014, the Cardinals announced Mize among 22 former players and personnel to be inducted into the St. Louis Cardinals Hall of Fame Museum for the inaugural class of 2014. The Johnny Mize Baseball Museum is located at Piedmont College. The college also honors the slugger with the Johnny Mize Athletic Center, a sports complex that houses the school's basketball arena.
