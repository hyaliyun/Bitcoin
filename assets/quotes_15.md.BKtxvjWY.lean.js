He won the Chilean National Prize for Literature in 1959. D√≠az Arrieta was born on May 11, 1891 in the town of Buin on the outskirts of Santiago, Chile. He spent a year in the Seminary of Santiago, a year at the Instituto Comercial de Santiago, and finally attended dental school for a brief time. He then began a 25-year career in the Ministry of Justice eventually becoming the head of the Civil Registry. Despite receiving little formal training, he began his literary career at an early age. In 1913, he published two stories in the journal Pluma y Lapiz under the pseudonym Alone. He published his only novel in 1915 before devoting his attention to literary criticism. In a career spanning more than sixty years, Alone wrote for a wide array of newspapers and periodicals, penning, most notably, the column Cr√≥nica Literaria, which first appeared in La Naci√≥n and later in El Mercurio. He became well known for his fluid and distinct style, and is considered to be the greatest Chilean prose writer of the mid-20th century. Several writers profited from his active promotion of their work, especially Mar√≠a Luisa Bombal and the poet Gabriela Mistral. Despite his vehement opposition to Communism, he nevertheless was an outspoken admirer of the poet and Pablo Neruda who was a prominent member of the Communist Party of Chile. He was a staunch catholic and supporter of the right-wing political movement that culminated in the 1973 overthrow of the leftist President of Chile, Salvador Allende. Alone lived his whole life in the same residence, a house he obtained with a mortgage at the beginning of his career in the Civil Service. Nearly blind and unable to speak, Alone died on January 24, 1984 at the age of 92.

(Sometimes incorrectly referred to as procure-to-pay. Automation Purchase-to-pay systems automate the full purchase-to-payment process, connecting procurement and invoicing operations through an intertwined business flow that automates the process from identification of a need, planning and budgeting, through to procurement and payment. Key benefits are increased financial and procurement visibility, efficiency, cost savings and control. Automation allows for reduced processing times and straight- through processing where the incoming invoices are handled without any manual intervention. Purchase-to-pay systems are designed to provide organizations with control and visibility over the entire lifecycle of a transaction ‚Äì from the way an item is ordered to the way that the final invoice is processed ‚Äì providing full insight into cashflow and financial commitments and is now deemed an important tool for proper implementation of Resource Accounting and Budgeting, not least by UK Government Departments such as HM Treasury. Financial commitments are understood at the point they are committed to rather than when invoiced. Organizations automate invoice processing and purchasing policies and procedures to bring financial rigor and process efficiency to the business of buying. Both purchase order (PO) and non-PO spending, capital, credit card and reimbursable spending can be captured and controlled through automated P2P systems. Finance departments can also enforce internal spending controls and have instant access to data that tells them who is spending, what they are buying and paying for, and with which vendors. As a result, efficiency and cost saving benefits can be substantial. History The term emerged in the 1990s and is one of a number of buzz phrases (like B2B, B2C, G2C etc.) that emerged as Internet applications became used more widely in business. Although it does not necessarily refer directly to the application of technology to the purchasing process, it is most often used in relation to applications like e-procurement and ERP purchasing and payment modules. A discipline in its own right Following the maturation of Internet-supported supply chain processes, the case emerged for identifying opportunities to further streamline business processes across the whole of the procure-to-pay value chain. This was driven primarily by the supply chain software vendors and consultants as well as by governments who had recognised and enthusiastically embraced concepts like e-procurement. The publication of the Gershon Review in the UK in 2004 for example, gave the British public sector the mandate to direct significant resource and effort toward creating efficiency and in particular in all aspects purchasing. A Basware research report ‚ÄòThe Cost of Control: A Call for Collaboration between Finance and Procurement‚ÄôCost of Control research identified this growing trend of increased levels of finance and procurement collaboration to overcome finance and purchasing challenges ‚Äì and highlighted that there is a clear emerging trend toward using technology as a way of overcoming operational challenges and harmonizing ‚Äòbuyers‚Äô and ‚Äòpayers‚Äô within the business. Mark Frohlich, associate professor of operations management at the Kelley School of Business commented at the time on the findings: \\"A resounding majority of those interviewed have woken up to the negative realities of supply chain risk and the crucial positive role supply chains will have in transforming their businesses for years to come. Clearly such changes to the business landscape will require a coordinated and collaborative response between functional departments, in particular finance and procurement, as well as the intelligent implementation of appropriate integrative knowledge sharing tools and systems. This is something we must all prepare for.\\" Procure-to-pay is the start of the procurement process from the point where the purchasing department starts working until the moment the invoices are paid.

History  The manipulation of games was revealed when the president of Kickers Offenbach, Horst-Gregorio Canellas, presented an audio- tape to DFB officials and a few journalists at his 50th birthday garden-party. In that tape, several players, including German internationals Bernd Patzke and Manfred Manglitz, could be heard offering to let themselves be bribed to help Offenbach avoid relegation. The chief prosecutor of the DFB, Hans Kindermann, found out that, amongst others, the 17 April 1971 game between FC Schalke and Arminia Bielefeld that ended 0‚Äì1, had been \\"sold\\" (or thrown) by Schalke's players and the board of directors. Afterwards, many of the Schalke players were banned for long periods, while several lifetime bans were imposed. The players maintained their innocence, and even swore an oath to that, but the oath was eventually proven to be false. Schalke's rivals, especially from the Ruhr, still occasionally refer to Schalke as FC Meineid (German for \\"FC Perjury\\"). Fifty-two players, two managers and six club functionaries were punished. Also, Bielefeld and Offenbach had their license to participate in the Bundesliga revoked. Offenbach would have been relegated due to their sporting performance anyway, despite the manipulated games, but Bielefeld were to play in the next Bundesliga season. Eventually, Bielefeld had to play all 34 games of the 1971‚Äì72 season, but would be relegated after the season, independently of their record.

Aphragma Dryandra ser. Aphragma is an obsolete series within the former genus Dryandra (now Banksia ser. Dryandra). It was first published at sectional rank by Robert Brown in 1830, and was retained at that rank until 1999, when Alex George demoted it to a series. It was discarded in 2007 when Austin Mast and Kevin Thiele sank Dryandra into Banksia. According to Brown Aphragma was first published by Brown in his 1830 Supplementum primum prodromi florae Novae Hollandiae. Brown's arrangement divided Dryandra into three groups according to what Brown perceived to be variations in the number of seed separators. He allowed for these groups to be treated at subgenus or section rank, but they are now treated as having been published as sections. D. sect. Aphragma was defined as containing four species which Brown thought lacked seed separators. The epithet Aphragma is from the Greek a- (\\"without\\") and phragma (\\"barrier\\"). The placement and circumscription of D. sect. Aphragma in Brown's 1830 arrangement may be summarised as follows: :Dryandra (now B. ser. Dryandra) ::Dryandra verae (18 species) ::D. sect. Diplophragma (1 species) ::D. sect. Aphragma :::D. nervosa (now B. alliacea) :::D. callophylla (now B. calophylla) :::D. pteridifolia (now B. pteridifolia) :::D. blechnifolia (now B. pellaeifolia) :Hemiclidia (1 species) According to Meissner In 1856, Carl Meissner published a revision of Dryandra. He retained all three of Brown's sections, and the circumscription given to D. sect. Aphragma was much the same, the only differences being the demotion of D. blechnifolia to a variety of D. pteridifolia, and the inclusion of D. drummondii (now B. drummondii), which had been published in 1848. The placement and circumscription of D. sect. Aphragma in Meissner's arrangement thus looks like this: :Dryandra (now Banksia ser. Dryandra) ::D. sect. Eudryandra (8 series, 47 species, 7 varieties) ::D. sect. Diplophragma (2 species) ::D. sect. Aphragma :::D. pteridifolia (now B. pteridifolia) ::::D. pteridifolia var. blechnifolia (now B. pellaeifolia) :::D. calophylla (now B. calophylla) ::::D. calophylla var. acaulis (now B. drummondii subsp. drummondii) :::D. nervosa (now Banksia alliacea) :::D. drummondii (now Banksia drummondii) :Hemiclidia (1 species) According to Bentham D. sect. Aphragma was retained by George Bentham in his 1870 arrangement, making it the only one of Meissner's infrageneric taxa not to be discarded. However, Bentham reasoned that the single seed separator in D. sect. Eudryandra was formed by the joining together of the outer seed coat of each seed; and therefore both D. bipinnatifida, in which there appears to be two plates, and D. sect. Aphragma, in which there appears to be none, represent failure of the seed coats to join. On these grounds he transferred D. bipinnatifida into D. sect. Aphragma. Thus D. sect. Aphragma was redefined as containing those species in which \\"Outer integuments of the two seeds not connate or readily separable from each other.\\" He also noted that the members of this section have large involucres with many broad bracts, giving them \\"a different aspect from all others of the genus\\". The placement and circumscription of D. sect. Aphragma in Bentham's arrangement is as follows: Dryandra pterifolia (now Banksia pteridifolia) :Dryandra (now Banksia ser. Dryandra) ::D. sect. Eudryandra ::D. sect. Aphragma :::D. tenuifolia (now B. tenuis) :::D. proteoides (now B. proteoides) ::::D. proteoides var. ferruginea (now B. rufa) :::D. runcinata (now B. rufa subsp. rufa) :::D. obtusa (now B. obtusa) :::D. bipinnatifida (now B. bipinnatifida) :::D. pteridifolia (now B. pteridifolia) :::D. calophylla (now B. calophylla) Bentham's arrangement would stand for well over a hundred years, with one minor exception. In 1903 Otto Kuntze challenged Dryandra R.Br. on the grounds that the name Josephia Knight had preceded it. In the process of transferring Dryandra into Josephia, Kuntze published the name Josephia sect. Aphragma (R.Br.) Kuntze. This was rejected, however, and J. sect. Aphragma is now considered a nomenclatural synonym of D. ser. Aphragma. According to George In 1996, Alex George demoted D. sect. Aphragma to a series within D. subg. Dryandra. He did not accept the previous definitions of the series, but nonetheless accepted the basic circumscription as sound; he instead used a range of flower, seed and leaf characters. The placement and circumscription of D. ser. Aphragma in George's arrangement, as amended in 1999 and 2005, may be summarised as follows: Dryandra pterifolia (now Banksia pteridifolia) :Dryandra (now Banksia ser. Dryandra) ::D. subg. Dryandra :::D. ser. Floribundae (1 species, 4 varieties) :::D. ser. Armatae (21 species, 7 subspecies, 4 varieties) :::D. ser. Marginatae (1 species) :::D. ser. Folliculosae (1 species, 5 varieties) :::D. ser. Acrodontae (4 species, 2 varieties) :::D. ser. Capitellatae (2 species, 2 subspecies) :::D. ser. Ilicinae (3 species, 2 varieties) :::D. ser. Dryandra (3 species, 2 subspecies) :::D. ser. Foliosae (3 species, 2 subspecies) :::D. ser. Decurrentes (1 species) :::D. ser. Tenuifoliae (2 species, 2 varieties) :::D. ser. Runcinatae (4 species, 7 subspecies) :::D. ser. Triangulares (3 species, 3 subspecies) :::D. ser. Aphragma ::::D. pteridifolia (now B. pteridifolia) :::::D. pteridifolia subsp. inretita (now B. pteridifolia subsp. inretita) :::::D. pteridifolia subsp. pteridifolia (now B. pteridifolia subsp. pteridifolia) :::::D. pteridifolia subsp. vernalis (now B. pteridifolia subsp. vernalis) ::::D. fililoba (now B. fililoba) ::::D. shanklandiorum (now B. shanklandiorum) ::::D. nervosa (now B. alliacea) ::::D. blechnifolia (now B. pellaeifolia) ::::D. porrecta (now B. porrecta) ::::D. aurantia (now B. aurantia) ::::D. calophylla (now B. calophylla) ::::D. lepidorhiza (now B. lepidorhiza) :::D. ser. Ionthocarpae (1 species, 2 subspecies) :::D. ser. Inusitatae (1 species) :::D. ser. Subulatae (1 species) :::D. ser. Gymnocephalae (11 species, 4 subspecies, 2 varieties) :::D. ser. Concinnae (3 species) :::D. ser. Obvallatae (7 species, 2 varieties) :::D. ser. Pectinatae (1 species) :::D. ser. Acuminatae (1 species) :::D. ser. Niveae (7 species, 7 subspecies) ::D. subg. Hemiclidia (2 species) ::D. subg. Diplophragma (1 species) Recent developments Since 1998, Austin Mast has been publishing results of ongoing cladistic analyses of DNA sequence data for the subtribe Banksiinae. His analyses have provided compelling evidence of the paraphyly of Banksia with respect to Dryandra; that is, it seems that Dryandra arose from within the ranks of Banksia. Early in 2007, Mast and Kevin Thiele initiated a rearrangement of Banksia by sinking Dryandra into it as B. ser. Dryandra. This transfer necessitated the setting aside of George's infrageneric arrangement of Dryandra; thus D. ser. Aphragma is no longer current. Mast and Thiele have foreshadowed publishing a full arrangement once DNA sampling of Dryandra is complete. References External links * Category:Banksia taxa by scientific name *ser.

The act of taking a breath is controlled by the respiratory center of the brain, which decides the characteristics of each breath, timing and size.

Location As of June 2018, the university had two campuses: * The Main Campus along United Nations Road, in Upanga West, in the city of Dar es Salaam. The coordinates of the university main campus are: 06¬∞48'28.0\\"S, 39¬∞16'24.0\\"E (Latitude:-6.807778; Longitude:39.273333). * The Mloganzila Campus, approximately west of Muhimbili Hospital, along the A-7 Highway. This campus hosts a 571-bed, start-of-art teaching hospital. * The university maintains a teaching facility in the town of Bagamoyo, about , by road, north-west of Dar es Salaam. * The university also maintains a student hostel located along Chole Road, Masaki, in Dar es Salaam. History The Muhimbili University of Health and Allied Sciences traces its origins to 1963, when it opened as Dar es Salaam Medical School. The school became the faculty of medicine of the University of Dar es Salaam, in 1968. In 1976 the Faculty of Medicine was incorporated into Muhimbili Hospital to form the Muhimbili Medical Centre (MMC). The Parliament Act No. 9 of 1991, upgraded the faculty to a college of Dar es Salaam; the Muhimbili University College of Health Sciences (MUCHS). In 2000 the Government by Act of Parliament dis-established MMC and created two closely linked, but autonomous public institutions: MUCHS and the Muhimbili National Hospital (MNH). Over the years MUCHS made significant achievements in increased student enrollment and development of several new academic programmes. The Parliament Act No. 9 of 1991 that established MUCHS was repealed in 2005.

A 2007 Organisation for Economic Co-operation and Development (OECD) report noted that the \\"excess of gross saving over fixed investment (i.e. net lending) in the \\"aggregate OECD corporate sector\\" had been unusually large since 2002. In a 2006 International Monetary Fund report, it was observed that, \\"since the bursting of the equity market bubble in the early 2000s, companies in many industrial countries have moved from their traditional position of borrowing funds to finance their capital expenditures to running financial surpluses that they are now lending to other sectors of the economy\\". David Wessell in a Wall Street Journal article observed that, \\"[c]ompanies, which normally borrow other folks‚Äô savings in order to invest, have turned thrifty. Even companies enjoying strong profits and cash flow are building cash hoards, reducing debt and buying back their own shares‚Äîinstead of making investment bets.\\" Although the hypothesis of excess cash holdings or cash hoarding has been used by the OECD, the International Monetary Fund and the media (Wall Street Journal, Forbes, Canadian Broadcasting Corporation), the concept itself has been disputed and criticized as conceptually flawed in articles and reports published by the Hoover Institute, the Max-Planck Institute and the CATO Institute among others. Ben Bernanke used the phrase \\"global savings glut\\" in 2005 linking it to the U.S. current account deficit. In their July 2012 report Standard & Poor's described the \\"fragile equilibrium that currently exists in the global corporate credit landscape\\". U.S. NFCS firms continued to hoard a \\"record amount of cash\\" with large profitable investment-grade companies and technology and health care industries (with significant amounts of cash overseas), holding most of the wealth. By January 2013, NFCS firms in Europe had over 1 trillion euros of cash on their balance sheets, a record high in nominal terms. History Saving gluts are not a new phenomenon. Economists like Karl Marx, J. A. Hobson and John Maynard Keynes considered the effect of an imbalance between savings and investment on the economy, which for them was caused by a overtly unequal distribution of income and wealth E.K. Hunt and Mark Lautzenheiser, History of Economic Thought: A Critical Perspective (3rd edition, Routledge, 2015), p. 412-413 Their underlying thesis is that a principal cause of depression is formed by the inability of capitalists to find sufficient investment opportunities to offset the increasing levels of saving generated by economic growth. The underlying reason is that as money is saved, it is extracted from the economic system or flow, which reduces consumption over time when these funds are not invested again. This in turn reduces production, which further reduces income, which further reduces consumption and leads to a depression, which will be resolved when a new (lower) equilibrium is found.E.K. Hunt and Mark Lautzenheiser, History of Economic Thought: A Critical Perspective (3rd edition, Routledge, 2015), p. 414 Plummeting interests rates are a consequence of such a saving glut: as the amount of savings (greatly) increase with decreasing opportunities for investment, interest rates decrease as the supply of savings outstrips its demand.Atif Mian, \\"How Inequality Hurts the Economy and Complicates Policy Responses to the Pandemic\\", Promarket, University of Chicago Business School https://promarket.org/2020/04/27/how-inequality-hurts- the-economy-and-complicates-policy-responses-to-the-pandemic/ (2020) The authors on saving gluts however differed in their possible solutions. Marx considered it one of the inherent contradictions of capitalism and therefore saw no long-term solution within the system itself.E.K. Hunt and Mark Lautzenheiser, History of Economic Thought: A Critical Perspective (3rd edition, Routledge, 2015), p. 414 Hobson prescribed income equalization (e.g., through redistrubutive measures) to reduce savings and re-incentivize the economy. Keynes proposed that governments could borrow savings when they exceeded investment. The borrowed funds could then be spent on socially useful projects (which should not increase the economy's production capacity or hinder future investment opportunities). This would reduce savings, stimulate the economy and offer new opportunities for investment, while not adding to the capital stock (which would increase production and thus once again reduce investment opportunities). This way, the economy would be revitalized by using overt surpluses for the common good, creating the conditions for renewed economy activity.E.K. Hunt and Mark Lautzenheiser, History of Economic Thought: A Critical Perspective (3rd edition, Routledge, 2015), p. 414-416 Since the 2000s When the equity market bubble burst, in the early 2000s, companies in many industrial countries cut down on borrowing funds to finance their capital expenditures. They began running financial surpluses that they lent to other sectors of the economy. In 2003‚Äì2004 the non-financial corporate sector in member nations of the Group of Seven (G-7) held $US 1.3 trillion of corporate excess saving.The IMF (2006) report used \\"cash\\" to refer refers to \\"currency and deposits plus short-term securities (including treasury bills, commercial paper, and certificates of deposits).\\" By 2011 Statistics Canada reported that Canadian business were \\"sitting on more than $583 billion in Canadian currency and deposits, and more than $276 billion in foreign currency\\". During and after the Great Recession of the late 2000s levels of economic and policy uncertainty rose dramatically contributing to the depth of the recession and the weakness of the following recovery with many corporations globally and avoiding investments and increasing their cash holdings, in what has been called \\"liquidity hoarding\\", \\"cash hoarding\\" or \\"dead cash\\". Cash kings In March 2013 Moody's Investors Service published their report entitled Cash Pile Grows 10% to $1.45 Trillion; Overseas Holdings Continue to Expand in their Global Credit Research series, in which they examined companies they rate in the US non-financial corporate sector (NFCS). According to their report, by the end of 2012 the US NFCS held \\"$1.45 trillion in cash,\\" 10% more than in 2001. At the end of 2011, US NFCS held $1.32 trillion in cash which was already a record level. \\"Of the $1.32 trillion for all the rated companies, Moody's estimates that $840 billion, or 58% of the total cash, is held overseas.\\" By the end of 2012 Apple, Microsoft, Google, Pfizer, and Cisco, \\"cash kings\\", as Moody's called them, held $347 billion at the end of 2012 compared to $278 billion in 2011. At the end of 2012 Ford Motor Company's cash balance was $22.9 billion and was listed as ten on the list of U.S. non-financial corporation sector's top ten cash kings by Moody's Investors Service in their March 2013 annual report on Global Credit Research. Causes In his article in April 2013 Federal Reserve Bank Economist, Kevin Kliesen investigated some of the causes of the \\"recent upsurge in hoarding of cash by firms\\" or \\"increased accumulation of cash on corporate balance sheets\\" in the United States. He suggested a number of valid reasons including \\"increased levels of economic uncertainty\\", \\"increased competition, especially in the information technology sector\\" and \\"financing of research and development\\". Kliesen also argued that another reason for cash hoarding in the U.S. is the \\"relatively high U.S. corporate tax rate on income generated from foreign operations and subsidiaries\\". In an article published in The Economist in 2005, it was argued that the consumer boom was built on the unreliable foundation of rising house prices and that corporations were waiting for housing prices to level off or decline before they are willing to invest rather than save. Opportunistic borrowing Financial liabilities have increased at U.S. NFCS firms, suggesting they may be taking advantage of low interests rates, and saving this cash as unused financial assets for future use. =Pension deficit= In 2005 Bernanke identified a number of possible causes for the global saving glut that began in 2001, including pension funding to make provision for an impending increase in the number of retirees relative to the number of workers. \\"Dearth of domestic investment opportunities\\", due to slowly growing or declining work forces, and high capital-labor ratios, which leads to low returns on domestic investment. As a result, the mature industrial economies seek to run current account surpluses and thus to lend abroad. RBC Global Asset Management's Chief Economist, Eric Lascelles, also argued that NFCS firms were building financial assets as a precautionary measure, claiming that in 2011 \\"private U.S. defined-benefit pension plans were underfunded by $USD 909 billion\\", whereas they \\"were roughly balanced in 2007\\". =Bank-centred governance and non-financial corporations cash holdings= At the 1998 International Finance Conference, in their paper entitled Bank Power and Cash Holdings: Evidence from Japan, Pinkowitz and Williamson showed that Japanese firms held more cash than U.S. or German firms. They concluded that the \\"monopoly power of Japanese banks\\" persuaded non-financial corporations to hold larger cash balances. \\"During periods with powerful banks, firms' high cash holdings are consistent with banks extracting rents.\\" When banks weakened, NFCS firms held lower cash levels. Firms might take fewer risks in countries with bank-centered governance but \\"banks' incentives might not coincide with those of shareholders\\". =Policy uncertainty: environmental and health public policies= U.S. NFCS firms' rationale behind increasing cash holdings and restrained capital expenditures is most often linked to policy uncertainty. At the end of 2012 NFCS firms faced \\"uncertainty regarding economic growth, the fiscal cliff, the debt ceiling, the pursuit of a sustainable long-term fiscal trajectory, health-care reform and financial-sector reform\\". The Policy Uncertainty Index was elevated at that time.  Consequences =A fall in global real long-term interest rates= In 2005 J.P. Morgan Chase & Co. observed that the increase in excess saving in the corporate sector contributed to the \\"relatively low level of global long-term interest rates at a time of a ballooning U.S. current account deficit\\". Greenspan argued that the excess saving resulted in a \\"fall in global real long-term interest rates and their associated capitalization rates. Asset prices, particularly house prices, in nearly two dozen countries accordingly moved dramatically higher. U.S. house price gains were high by historical standards but no more than average compared to other countries.\\" =Rising global imbalances with respect to international current account balances= The United States was already experiencing a dramatic increase in its current account deficitBernanke 10 March 2005 explained the U.S. current account deficit equalled the \\"excess of U.S. payments to foreigners over payments received in a given period.\\" The U.S. current account deficit was c. $635 billion in 2004. The value of U.S. imports exceeded that of exports by c. $618 billion. Bernanke argued that the GSG caused the rise in current account deficits. A \\"current account deficit means that a country is spending more than it is producing\\". =Low capital expenditure (capex)= Low capital expenditure (capex) is frequently cited as hindering economic recovery although economists are not in agreement on this. Eric Lascelles, explained the rationale behind the surge in corporate saving. He argued that NFCS firms continued to be restrained in terms of capital expenditure for a variety of reasons. Equipment and software prices have dropped since 1992 allowing them to purchase more with less. In the United States, there is an oversupply of capital stock which includes physical capital, office space, plants and equipment in the U.S. Existing capital is not depreciating rapidly and firms are running under capacity. NFCS firms began deleveraging after the financial crisis as they found that their assets were \\"worth less than they imagined and discovered that continuous access to debt markets was not guaranteed\\". They channeled resources to the financial account and asset liquidity, away from capital expenditures. In 2013 Gareth Williams, Director, Sector Economist at Standard & Poor's argued that a \\"large and growing share of European corporate capex was directed to emerging markets\\" outside of Europe, \\"up 42% from January 2012 and up from 28% from 2007\\". Williams claims there is \\"a strong precautionary motive in the amount of cash being held\\" by NFCS firms, in the eurozone European Economic and Monetary Union which is \\"trapped in a quagmire of austerity, high unemployment, and political uncertainty\\". =Developing countries became net lenders on capital markets= Developing countries became net lenders on capital markets. United States and other advanced economies became net borrowers. University of California, Berkeley economist Obstfeld observed, that Bernanke and other proponents of the global saving glut account of the 2007‚Äì09 crisis argued that large surpluses by China (and other GSG countries) had adverse effects on richer countries' current accounts and financial markets. To avoid the consequences of financial crises, developing countries built up \\"war chests\\" of large quantities of foreign-exchange reserves to act as a buffer against potential capital outflows during financial crises. According to Bernanke the US was attractive for foreign investors because of new technologies and rising productivity. Capital flowing into the United States increased the value of the dollar making the imports of the US cheap (in terms of dollars) and exports expensive (in terms of foreign currencies), creating a rising US current account deficit. GSG countries accumulated reserves in the \\"context of foreign exchange interventions intended to promote export-led growth by preventing exchange-rate appreciation\\".(sometimes called Bretton Woods II). The Lucas paradox In Robert Lucas' classical paradox described in the article entitled \\"Why doesn't capital flow from rich to poor countries?\\" and published in 1990 in the American Economic Review, Lucas questioned the validity of the assumptions of the neoclassical model that gave rise to differences in the marginal product of capital. For example, in 1988 in India, a poorer country at that time, the marginal product of capital should have been 58 greater than in the United States, a richer nation. Lucas did not observe such flows. Lucas argued that the central question of economic development should be to replace these assumptions. Net borrowing must equal net lending In an open economy, a country's spending in any given year need not to equal its output of goods and services. A country can spend more money than it produces by borrowing from abroad, or it can spend less than it produces and lend the difference to foreigners. Even though some economies are more open or closed than others, there are no absolutely closed national economies in today's world. However, the global economy as a whole is necessarily closed in the strict definition of closed economy. Consequently, net borrowing, at the global level, must necessarily equal global lending. Canada The Canadian government introduced business incentives along with corporate tax reductions \\"to compel Canadian corporations to invest some $525 billion of dead cash back into the economy\\". In their analysis of the 2012 budget the Canadian Labour Congress argued that \\"non-financial corporations\\" have used their federal incentives and tax cutsPrior to 2007, the federal corporate income tax rate was over 20%. Since 2007 the corporate tax rate was lowered. Bay 2012 it was 15%. to \\"buy up their own shares, to increase dividends, and to increase their cash holdings\\" which amounted to \\"close to $500 billion of surplus cash\\" that they were not investing in job creation. In August 2012 then Bank of Canada Governor Mark Carney \\"castigated corporations in Canada for their high levels of savings, saying firms should either spend their ample financial reserves or return the value to shareholders through buy-backs\\". Financial Post journalist Philip Cross argued that \\"It is the job of companies to make money for their shareholders, not to put money to work.\\" Cross also argued that, \\"If households and governments are net borrowers, inevitably firms must be net lenders, which require savings.\\" From 2002 to 2012, corporations in Germany, the UK and Japan had higher savings rates than corporations in Canada. After the Great Recession corporations in OECD member nations further increased their savings rates Great Recession. Don Drummond, who was formerly the chief economist for TD Bank, argued that reluctance of Canadian businesses to invest capital is a problematic, long term pattern. It is not because of \\"excessive prudence\\". By spring 2013 in Canada \\"the stock of machinery and equipment per worker\\" in average \\"was between 50% and 60%\\" of what it was in the United States. The lack of spending was long term and it continued through 2012 while in the United States spending increased. Drummond argued that this gap would get bigger. According to Drummond, there was a time when Canadian businesses spent less because of \\"factors such as tax rates and the dollar, but if that were ever true it's certainly not anymore... Canadian businesses are accustomed to operating in an environment that is sheltered from competition, compared to the American business climate. As a result, they don't accurately perceive the risks of being too cautious, and of failing to exploit opportunities and available resources.\\" * Rise in oil prices: This leads to rising current account surpluses of oil exporting countries in the Middle East, in Russia, Nigeria, and Venezuela.  Concept of cash hoarding disputed  This view of a worldwide saving glut responsible for low levels of interest rates is disputed by neoclassical economists like the German economist Hans-Werner Sinn, who claims that it was the monetary policy of the US Federal Reserve in the 1990s which kept interest rates too low for too long. In addition, the policy of the US government encouraged private debt to promote private consumption. This led to a lack of savings in the US which was then provided from foreign countries on a basis which was not sustainable. Carl Christian von Weizs√§cker follows Ben Bernanke claiming that aging populations which save more than can be profitably invested lead to a saving glut and negative equilibrium rates of interest which makes public deficits necessary to fill the gap between excess private savings and private investment. From the perspective of monetary economics, the savings glut idea has been criticized as conceptually flawed, ignoring the role of credit creation, and related unsustainable asset price booms. Further, the composition of cross-border financing flows cannot be determined just from the net capital flows, and analysis on this basis yields flawed conclusions. In his 2008 article entitled \\"Competing Explanations: A Global Saving Glut\\", Senior Fellow in Economics at Stanford University's Hoover Institution, John B. Taylor, stated that there was \\"no evidence for a global saving glut\\". Using an International Monetary Fund 2005 graph, he argued that \\"the global saving rate‚Äîworld saving as a fraction of world GDP‚Äîwas very low in the 2002‚Äì2004 period especially when compared with the 1970s and 1980s\\". According to Taylor, \\"[T]here was a gap of saving over investment in the world outside the United States during 2002‚Äì2004, and this may be the source of the term \\"saving glut\\". But the United States was saving less than it was investing during this period; it was running a current account deficit which implies that saving was less than investment. Thus the positive saving gap outside the United States was offset by an equal sized negative saving gap in the United States. No extra impact on world interest rates would be expected. As implied by simple global accounting, there is no global gap between saving and investment.\\" Taylor argued that the global gross savings rate (not necessarily the net savings rate) during the 2000s was slightly higher than savings rate in the 80s or 90s according to IMF data. Niall Ferguson in The Ascent of Money, published in 2008, examines the long history of money, credit, and banking. In it he predicted a financial crisis as a result of the world economy and in particular the United States using too much credit. Specifically he cites the China‚ÄìAmerica dynamic which he refers to as Chimerica where an Asian \\"savings glut\\" helped create the subprime mortgage crisis with an influx of easy money.  Critique  Thomas Mayer and Gunther Schnabl argue that the Keynesian economic theory widely omits the banking sector, and therefore interest rate changes by central banks have a direct impact on investments. In contrast, in the Austrian economic theory the banking sector plays a crucial role for transmission of monetary policy. Low interest rates could lead to malinvestment and speculative exuberance on financial markets, which can impair long-term growth. Mayer and Schnabl find no empirical evidence for the savings glut hypothesis nor for the secular stagnation hypothesis. Instead, low growth is explained by the emergence of quasi \\"soft budget constraints\\" resulting from low interest rates that reduce the incentive for banks and firms to strive for efficiency (zombification).

Gascoigne was instrumental in Tottenham's equalising goal and scored the winner. Harding made 25 starts in the top flight as County were relegated back to the second tier. He fell out of favour, and spent time on loan at Southend United, Watford and Birmingham City, before joining the latter club on a permanent basis in January 1994 for a fee of ¬£50,000. Harding made 26 appearances in all competitions for Birmingham before, in the 1995 close season, making his last move within the Football League, to Cardiff City where he was made captain.

It is intended to handle critical fatality management functions made necessary by a major disaster. UVIS is a strong flexible role-based application and permissions can be controlled dynamically.City of New York Office of Chief Medical Examiner Pandemic Influenza Surge Plan To Manage In-Hospital Deaths Planning Tool In the event of a mass casualty event, it will initially be used by New York City's 311 call center operators, the New York Police Department, and OCME to gather key information to facilitate compiling an accurate list of missing persons. UVIS will also be used by the OCME to track decedents and collect postmortem findings to facilitate the identification process after a disaster. UVIS also contains a Pandemic Flu module to prepare against such an eventuality. UVIS is a strong flexible role-based application and permissions can be controlled dynamically. UVIS was built for the OCME by Nihilent, a consulting & solution integration company, and is a leading design thinking company, (formerly known as ICRA Sapphire). Developed with public funds, UVIS is available to municipalities, counties, states, and other governmental agencies without charge, under license from New York City. Currently UVIS is in use at the Office of Chief Medical Examiner of the City of New York (OCME) and the State of New Jersey (OCSME).  Ante-Mortem Section  The Ante-Mortem Section relates to activities carried out before an individual is absolutely known to be deceased. These include recording key information about the missing individual and managing interactions with the missing person's family members. =Call Center module= Mass casualty events generate numerous calls to government agencies: for example, the 2005 London subway bombing generated some 42,000 calls to the UK. Casualty Bureau call centers within the Bureau's first hour of operation.Report of the 7 July Review Committee (London Assembly) The Call Center module can handle tens of thousands of calls from individuals reporting or enquiring about missing persons, and record basic information about both the missing person and the caller. =Missing Persons module= The Missing Persons module enables NYPD Missing Persons detectives to conduct detailed interviews of family members, friends, and acquaintances of missing persons, and can store extremely detailed data ranging from clothing to physical characteristics such as eye and hair color to tattoo or scar information. =Family Assistance Center module= The UVIS Family Assistance Center module manages Family Assistance Centers (FACs), which are established to provide services to, and capture information from, the family and friends of injured, missing, or deceased disaster victims. Services generally provided at a FAC include: grief counseling; childcare; religious support; facilitation of family needs such as hotel, food, and transportation; ante-mortem data collection by the investigative authorities and the medical examiner or coroner; and notification of death to the next of kin. The UVIS Family Assistance Center module tracks all interactions and appointments with the family of missing persons, and can manage the personal items of victims received from family members for identification purposes. =Records module= The Records modules handles requests for records from family members, lawyers, and public administrators, providing ‚ÄúChain of Custody‚Äù for all records. Post-Mortem Section The Post-Mortem Section deals with human remains recovered from mass casualty sites. =Field Operation module= The Field Operations module can help users to manage incidents, field investigation, and the collection of remains and evidence, as well as maintaining records and documentation about remains and evidence. Because internet connectivity will often be unavailable at disaster sites, the Field Operations module has a Microsoft Windows-based client version that can capture data off-line and synchronize with the main database when connectivity is available. =Disaster Mortuary Management module= The Disaster Mortuary Management module provides mortuary management functionality. It supports the accessioning of remains, both check-in and check-out; the examination of remains by Medical Examiner and Anthropology; the tracking and documentation of autopsies and individual remains; and the final disposition of remains to funeral homes. =Disaster Victim Identification module= This module has bidirectional (from ante- to post-mortem and back) one-to-many search capabilities based on multiple criteria. It possesses considerable identification tracking capabilities including DNA, fingerprint, radiology, and dental (see UDIM below). The module enables identification review and verification, including DNA re-sampling. It also enables the consolidation of fragmented remains as they are uncovered. The Disaster Victim Identification module can conduct notification tracking, including communication both with family members and media about a given decedent. It is capable of issuing death certification either when remains are found or not. It also maintains a log of all family communications, and can schedule and track family visits. =UVIS Dental Identification Module (UDIM) module= A Forensic Odontology add-on, UDIM possesses detailed charting, complex and advanced search, and the ability to look for anomalies. =Pandemic Influenza Module= Pandemic influenza remains a serious threat. The U.S. Health and Human Services Department forecasts that if a lethal flu pandemic strikes, deaths could range from 209,000 to 1.9 million.HHS Pandemic Influenza Plan- Part 1: Strategic Plan right If an influenza pandemic occurs, the magnitude of the event would demand a response from the NYC OCME to assist any governmental health care facilities as well as to support facilities in the private sector. Health care facilities which would be affected by a flu pandemic include public and private hospitals, nursing homes, retirement facilities, prison health clinics, public health clinics, and mental health hospitals. During a flu pandemic causing mass fatalities, the limited morgues and decedent storage space at most health care facilities will be quickly overwhelmed. The proposed solution consists of temporary morgues, known as Body Collection Points (BCPs), at health care facilities. These would be either refrigerated 18-wheel trailers or refrigerated CONEX containers. The UVIS Pandemic Flu module enables health care facility morgue managers to administer BCPs, allowing them to: *Create a report for a set of remains, entering such information as the decedent‚Äôs medical history, usual residence, and next of kin, as well as report notes and the reporting physician‚Äôs information. Creating a report automatically assigns a specimen number to the remains. *Search for a decedent using the specimen number, last name, first name, and/or date of death. *Check remains into or out of a BCP, storing them until they are ready to be released to a funeral home or funeral director. Remains can also be moved from one BCP location to another. *Browse through all BCPs at the health care facility to locate remains. *Create a request for a BCP storage unit. The Pandemic Flu module also enables medical examiner personnel to handle health care facilities‚Äô requests for BCPs, managing the location and distribution of storage units at health care facilities, police precincts, or any other designated location. If necessary, they can place a request on behalf of a facility. As well, Pandemic Flu module enables medical examiner personnel to create reports for decedents and to search for decedents using the specimen number, last name, first name, and/or date of death. They can also track and record the progress of a decedent‚Äôs case. Currently, the system tracks remains that are awaiting investigation, awaiting disposition, and transportation. UVIS tracks time elapsed in each state and color-codes each record, giving an immediate visual indication of the status of each case. NYC OCME personnel can also search the New York State Electronic Death Record System (EDRS) for decedents. As part of UVIS, the Pandemic Influenza module‚Äôs data is available for search within the system. =Administrative Section= The Administrative Section allows users to create incidents, to which missing persons are attached; conduct records management; and carry out other system administration tasks. =Technical Description= UVIS is a multi-tiered, browser- and Windows-based application, written in Microsoft-based technology, and running on a minimum configuration of Microsoft Windows Server 2003 and Microsoft SQL 2000 / 2005 as the database engine.  Recent Updates  *Currently UVIS code base has been upgraded to support daily operations of the Medical Examiner Offices along with the disaster operations as most of the Post-Mortem operations are the same. Based on permissions, the users can toggle between the daily and disaster option. Having the same application for both helps decrease user training in the event of a mass fatality. *A strong chain of custody has been built within the UVIS for tracking purposes. *In terms of technology UVIS has been upgraded to run on Microsoft Windows Server 2016 (and higher) and SQL Server 2016 (and higher).

Route 5, an east-west road, passes to the south of this property. Located just west of the county seat Charles City Courthouse, Virginia, Greenway is one of Charles City's earliest and most distinctive Colonial plantations. It was added to the National Register of Historic Places in 1969. Physical description The plantation comprises approximately and consists of several outbuildings in addition to the main house. The frame structures have beaded clapboard siding and wood-covered gable rooflines. The main structure is symmetrical in its front, southern facade and possesses the end chimneys so characteristic of southern Colonial structures.Katie Kelley, Architectural Historian, Historic Richmond Foundation It has a unique T-shaped plan and the brick foundation walls are constructed mainly of Flemish bond, with the exception of a few areas where an English brick bond is possible evidence of additions. and Accompanying photo History Greenway was built circa 1776 by Judge John Tyler, Sr., the father of president John Tyler. Future President Tyler was born here in 1790. When Judge Tyler died in 1813, John Tyler at the age of 23 inherited Greenway. He lived there until age 39 (1829), when he sold the plantation and moved to nearby Sherwood Forest Plantation. Although its architecture has significance, the historical colonial and federal figures associated with the plantation are the most notable facts about it. Present use The plantation is privately owned and maintained. The structures have remained well-preserved over the years with little alteration; they have been measured, photographed, and drawn for preservation by the Historic American Buildings Survey of the Library of Congress.

Even the repeat screenings were held to packed audiences. For instance, there was a heavy rush for the Chinese film ‚ÄòGetting Home by Yang Zhang‚Äô even though it was being screened for third time in the festival on Thursday. ‚ÄòBanishment‚Äô by Russian director Andrey Zvyagintsev won wide acclaim from the IFFK audience. The Mexican film ‚ÄòPans Labyrinth‚Äô by Guilermo tel Torro was a remarkable experience.

It was established in 1974 and stretches over an area of 4316 km¬≤, thereby spanning all three climate zones of Bhutan, ranging in elevation from 1400 to over 7000 meters. About 6,500 people in 1,000 households live within the park, from subsistence agriculture and animal husbandry. It is listed as a tentative site in Bhutan's Tentative List for UNESCO inclusion. Flora and fauna The park provides sanctuary for 37 known species of mammals including several endangered, threatened or vulnerable species, such as the Bhutan takin, snow leopard, clouded leopard, Bengal tiger, bharal or Himalayan blue sheep, black musk deer, Himalayan black bear, red panda, Ussuri dhole, and spotted linsang. It is also home to the Indian leopard, [Himalayan serow , sambar, barking deer, Himalayan goral, Himalayan marmot, Himalayan pika, and more than 300 species of birds. It is also the only park in Bhutan where the national animal (takin), flower (blue poppy), bird (raven) and tree (cypress) exist together. Cultural sites Jigme Dorji also contains sites of cultural and economic significance. Mount Jomolhari and Mount Jitchu Drake are worshipped as homes of the local deity.

These gewogs are the site of some of the most notable and precarious glaciers of Bhutan. These glaciers have thawed significantly over the course of recorded history, causing lethal and destructive glacial lake outburst floods. Chief among the glaciers and glacial lakes within the park are Thorthormi, Luggye, and Teri Kang. As the seasons allow, temporary camps of laborers work within the park to reduce water levels to assuage the threat of flooding downstream.

In 1887 he founded the Great Bengal Circus with an all-Indian team and toured Bengal, India and South East Asia. He is considered to be one the pioneers of circus in India.  Early life  Ancestral house of Priyanath Bose. Priyanath Bose was born in the Bose family of Chhota Jagulia in 24 Parganas district in Bengal in the year 1865, the youngest of three sons to Manomohan Bose. His father was a poet and a playwright. He was one of the organizers of the Hindu Mela in Kolkata and a great orator known for his nationalistic speeches. His immediate elder brother Motilal Bose was a wrestler who founded an akhada in Chingirpota whose members were later involved in revolutionary activities. The Bose family had a residence in Kolkata at the crossing of Bidhan Sarani and Vivekananda Road. Priyanath attended primary school in Chhota Jagulia and then took admission at the Metropolitan Institution in Kolkata. During his student life, he took keen interest in physical culture. He learned gymnastics from Gourhari Mukhopadhyay, one of the popular instructors of the time. Priyanth became an expert in the pyramid and juggling acts. He was also expert in the parallel and horizontal bars and horse riding. He not only became a good gymnast, he became a very good instructor as well. He was one of his best and successful pupils. Priyanth was more interested in gymnastics and physical culture than his studies. However, he was good at drawing. His father Manomohan Bose noticed this and admitted him to the Government Art School. Though he took admission at the art school, he never took it seriously.  Career  = Physical trainer = Gourhari Mukhopadhyay had inspired the youth to set up numerous akhadas in Ahiritola and many other parts of Kolkata. However, it became difficult for him to attend all of them as an instructor. So he delegated some of the akhadas to Priyanth Bose. While working as an instructor at the akhadas of Gourhari Mukhopadhyay, Priyanth along with one of his assistants Bholanath Mitra and a person by the name of 'Aulcharu' founded a gymnastic club in Simulia. Sharat Kumar Sarkar was the instructor at the club. Later, Priyanath and Bholanath parted ways and the club was closed. Bholanath Mitra founded his own akhada. Priyanth Bose too founded his own akhada in Simulia. Narendranath Dutta, his neighbour and the classmate of his elder brother Motilal Bose, who later became Swami Vivekananda used to train in this akhada. The success of his first akhada at Simulia, inspired numerous gymnastic akhadas to be set up in Kolkata. According to his guru Gourhari Mukhopadhyay, Priyanth, himself used to coach in almost 50 akhadas between Simulia and Nebutala. Apart of coaching the pupils and managing the affairs of these clubs, he had also set up similar akhadas in Agarpara, Panihati and his own village Chhota Jagulia. When he established the akhada in his own village, the village elders did not like it. However, he was supported by his cousin Amarnath Bose, a reputed lawyer at the Calcutta High Court. He had sent his own sons to the akhada. Priyanath was not satisfied with training his pupils only in physical culture. He made them to clear the bushes, repair the roads, cremate the dead and do similar social work. Priyanth used to save his pocket money and take additional money from his mother and traveled to the villages and trained his pupils. He had three rules for his pupil at the akhadas. Firstly none would be admitted without permission from parents. Secondly, the pupils must not have any addition to paan, smoking or snuff. Thirdly, the pupils were not permitted to have fashionable haircuts. Lord Dufferin addressed Priyanath as Professor Bose. In c. 1885, Priyanath was invited at a fancy fete event at the Zoological Gardens in Alipore where he exhibited the gymnastic feats of his pupils. Lord Dufferin, the Viceroy of India was present at the event. He was so pleased with the performance, he is said to have asked, \\"Who is the professor?\\". He expressed his interest in meeting Priyanath, and when they met, Lord Dufferin addressed him as Professor Bose. After that Priyanth became popular as Professor Bose. = Founding Great Bengal Circus = Manomohan Bose did not like his son taking up circus as a profession. Whenever Wilson's Great World Circus or Chiarini's Italian Circus arrived in Kolkata, he would go to see their shows. At the show, he would resolve to set up his own circus, with an all-Bengali team and he would prove that Bengalis were also fearless and skillful. He would prepare sketches of the performing artistes at their various poses and bribe the circus workers to give him access to their equipment. He would prepare sketches of the equipment and take their measurements. He would prepare similar equipment and train his pupils with them. Once while he was training his pupils at the akhada in his ancestral village of Chhota Jagulia, a very thin and skinny horse arrived there. His boys captured it and brought it to the akhada. Priyanath considered the sudden appearance of the horse out of nowhere as a good omen and an indication from the Supreme Being to start his own circus. After feeding the horse well, Priyanath began to train it in earnest. However, setting up a circus required a lot of investment. His father Manomohan Bose was never very comfortable with Priyanath choosing a career based on his gymnastic skills. Not only did he refuse to provide a single penny, he tried his best to change his son's mind. He arranged a job for Priyanath as a drawing instructor at a salary of 75 per month. Priyanath fumed at his father's actions and resolved to pursue his goal, in spite of opposition from his family. He began to amass the capital he would need on his own. He also borrowed some money from the women of his family and a few other sources. He formed a small team of gymnasts and, without informing his family, left Kolkata. Priyanath and his team first went to Midnapore. Then he toured Jhargram, Bankura and Birbhum and performed at the zamindar houses. During this time, he did not have a tent, gallery or menagerie. After making some money on the tour, Priyanath returned to Kolkata. Then he bought the equipment, monkeys, dogs and horses of the National Circus from Nabagopal Mitra. He also arranged a tent. At this time he hired one horse from the akhada of Nanda Ghosh in Shyambazar. Rakhal Chandra Bose of the same akhada was appointed as the accountant. Priyanath augmented his team with a few more performers. In 1887, he formally launched his circus as Professor Bose's Great Bengal Circus. = Tour of India = Priyanath Bose (seated 4th from left) with the members of Great Bengal Circus. Priyanath took his circus on a tour of Bengal. He first toured Dhaka, Jhalokati and Barisal. Then he went on a second tour of Shantipur, Dainhat, Katwa and Murshidabad. In December 1888, the Great Bengal Circus was invited to perform equestrian and gymnastic feats at the Tajhat palace Gobindalal Roy, the zamindar of Rangpur. He was so impressed with their performance that he retained them two more nights and presented the team 25 pairs of shawls and certificate of excellence. Mahima Ranjan Roy Chowdhury, the zamindar of Kakina who was present at the Tajhat Palace at that time too certified the team's excellent performance and hoped the elites of the country to patronize the Great Bengal Circus. Soon the Great Bengal Circus began to be invited by the zamindars of Bengal. Many of the zamindars gifted them equipment and horses to the circus in addition to the stipulated payment. Later on it was patronized by the rulers of the princely states of Tripura, Rewa, Kashi, Kashmir and Jhalwar. Some of them gifted tigers and elephants to the circus. As the news of success of Great Bengal Circus began to be published in the newspapers, people of Kolkata longed to see their performance in the city of its birth. In November 1899, the Great Bengal Circus came to the Kolkata for the first time since its inception. Priyanath Bose set up the tent at the Maidan. His shows were graced and patronized by eminent dignitaries including the Maharajas of Kapurthala and Cooch Behar and the zamindar of Burdwan. Starting from the winter of 1899‚Äì1900, the Priyanath Bose used to camp in Kolkata each winter till the 1911‚Äì12 season. = Asian tours = In the summer of 1900, Priyanath traveled with his circus along the Indian coast to Ceylon. In Ceylon, Priyanath recruited a man known for eating anything. He would devour rags, raw meat, nails, broken glass and brick bats. He was advertised as Rakshasha of Lanka. In 1902, Priyanath Bose embarked on a South East Asian tour. Great Bengal Circus travelled to Yangon, Penang, Singapore and Java. The tour met with a great success. Priyanath Bose returned home with new animal recruits for his menagerie. From then on Priyanath Bose began to travel to South East Asia every season. His circus would spend the major part of year in Burma, British Malaya and the Dutch East Indies and return to Kolkata in the winter.  Death  Priyanath Bose before death During this tour, Priyanath Bose contracted jaundice. While his Professor Bose's Grand Circus was touring Klang and other cities of British Malaya, Priyanath went to Singapore for treatment. He was under the treatment of Dr. Galloway and Dr. Wilson for about a month. His condition, however, did not improve. Priyanath died on 21 May 1920 in Singapore. Priyanath Bose's circus show The circus consisted of trapeze acts, gymnastics and wild animals. Not just men, but there were women performers in the circus act as well. Bose hired Gus Burns, an American, to train the tigers and lions, and there were later Indian men and women who performed as ringmasters, as well. Dr. Bose was himself an expert at juggling and equestrian events.

Because many religious communities have strong opinions and religious legislation regarding marriage, sex and reproduction, modern fertility technology has forced religions to respond. Sperm collection Both for male factor testing and in order to use sperm for IUI or IVF the couple must first collect a sperm sample. For many religious groups this creates a challenge due to a prohibition on masturbation. Christianity Christian churches have different views to assisted reproductive technology. =Catholicism= The Roman Catholic Church opposes certain types of ART and artificial contraception since they separate the procreative goal of marital sex from the goal of uniting married couples. The Roman Catholic Church permits the use of a small number of reproductive technologies and pregnancy postponement methods like natural family planning, which involves charting ovulation times. The church allows other forms of reproductive technologies that allow conception to take place from normative sexual intercourse, such as a fertility lubricant, the use of hormonal injections to grow follicles and assist in ovulation, and IUI with sperm collected using the approved method of collection during intercourse. In vitro fertilization Pope Benedict XVI has publicly re-emphasized the Catholic Church's opposition to in vitro fertilization (IVF), claiming it replaces love between a husband and wife.. In addition, the church opposes IVF because it might cause disposal of embryos; Catholics believe an embryo is an individual with a soul who must be treated as a such. According to the Catechism of the Catholic Church, The Catholic Church maintains that it is not objectively evil to be infertile, and advocates adoption as an option for such couples who still wish to have children: Gamete intrafallopian transfer (GIFT) is not technically in vitro fertilisation because with GIFT, fertilisation takes place inside the body, not on a Petri dish. The Catholic Church nevertheless is concerned with it because \\"Some theologians consider this to be a replacement of the marital act, and therefore immoral.\\" = LDS Church = The Church of Jesus Christ of Latter-day Saints \\"strongly discourages the donation of sperm\\" and likewise strongly discourages in vitro fertilization \\"using semen from anyone but the husband or an egg from anyone but the wife\\". However, official church policy also notes that such decisions are personal matters and, as such, \\"must be left to the judgment of the husband and wife\\". No disciplinary action is advised for LDS married couples who make use of such in vitro fertilization.Handbook 2: Administering the Church, section 21.4 Policies on Moral Issues, accessed 02 December 2016 = Protestant Churches = Protestant Churches in Western and Northern Europe support assisted reproductive technology. Hinduism There are several Hindus who have been claimed to be born without intercourse including Karna and Five Pandavas. Islam The Islamic community, after the fatwa on ART by Gad El-Hak Ali Gad El-Hak of Egypt's Al-Azhar University, largely accepted ART. IVF and similar technologies are permissible as long as they do not involve any form of third- party donation (of sperm, eggs, embryos, or uteruses). Regarding third-party donation there is a debate between the Sunni and Shia streams of Islam. The Sunni community, following the Al-Azhar fatwa, does not allow third-party donations. In 1999, Ayatollah Khamenei, the authority for the Shi'a Muslims, issued a fatwa stating that it was permitted to use third-party donors.. The conclusions of Gad El-Hak Ali Gad El-Hak's ART fatwa are as follows: # Artificial insemination with the husband‚Äôs semen is allowed, and the resulting child is the legal offspring of the couple. #In vitro fertilization (IVF) of an egg from the wife with the sperm of her husband and the transfer of the fertilized egg back to the uterus of the wife is allowed, provided that the procedure is indicated for a medical reason and is carried out by an expert physician. #Since marriage is a contract between the wife and husband during the span of their marriage, no third party should intrude into the marital functions of sex and procreation. This means that a third party donor is not acceptable, whether he or she is providing sperm, eggs, embryos, or a uterus. The use of a third party is tantamount to zina, or adultery. #Adoption of a child from an illegitimate form of medically assisted conception is not allowed. The child who results from a forbidden method belongs to the mother who delivered him/her. He or she is considered to be a laqid, or an illegitimate child. #If the marriage contract has come to an end because of divorce or death of the husband, medically assisted conception cannot be performed on the ex-wife even if the sperm comes from the former husband. #An excess number of embryos can be preserved by cryopreservation. The frozen embryos are the property of the couple alone and may be transferred to the same wife in a successive cycle, but only during the duration of the marriage contract. Embryo donation is prohibited. #Selective reduction is only allowed if the prospect of carrying the pregnancy to viability is very small. It is also allowed if the health or life of the mother is in jeopardy. #All forms of surrogacy are forbidden. #Establishment of sperm banks with \\"selective\\" semen threatens the existence of the family and the \\"race\\" and should be prevented. #The physician is the only qualified person to practice medically assisted conception in all its permitted varieties. If he performs any of the forbidden techniques, he is guilty, his earnings are forbidden, and he must be stopped from his morally illicit practice. Judaism Defining Jewish views on assisted reproductive technology based solely on branches of Judaism is problematic since there is substantial overlap in opinions and moral authority. =Orthodox Judaism= Within the Orthodox Jewish community the concept is debated as there is little precedent in traditional Jewish legal textual sources. Non-legal sources such as medrash and aggadah provide stories that have been used to draw conclusions regarding ART by modern Jewish legal decisors. In general, traditional Judaism views medical intervention positively.Shulchan Aruch, Yoreh Deah 336: 1 Regarding ART, the positive view of medicine is challenged by the Jewish religious legal system which has numerous laws regarding modesty and sexuality and a strong emphasis on verifiable lineage. In Orthodox Judaism, insemination with the husband‚Äôs sperm is permissible if the wife cannot become pregnant in any other way. Regarding laws of sexuality, religious challenges include masturbation (which may be regarded as ‚Äúseed wasting‚Äù), laws related to sexual activity and menstruation (niddah) and the specific laws regarding intercourse. Additional issues arise regarding the restrictions of the Sabbath (Shabbat) and Jewish holidays. An additional major issue is that of establishing paternity and lineage. For a baby conceived naturally, the father‚Äôs identity is determined by a legal presumption (chazakah) of legitimacy: rov bi'ot achar ha'baal - a woman's sexual relations are assumed to be with her husband. Regarding an IVF child, this assumption does not exist and as such Rabbi Eliezer Waldenberg (among others) requires an outside supervisor to positively identify the father.Tzitz Eliezer 9 p. 247 Doctors or laboratory workers present at the time of the fertility treatment are not considered supervisors due to a conflict of interest and their pre-occupation with their work.Rav Sholom Eliashiv: ‚ÄúEven if I were to be the lab worker I couldn‚Äôt be a valid witness for this matter‚Äù. As such, supervisory services are required for all treatments involving lab manipulation or cryopreservation of sperm, ovum or embryos. While a range of views exist, both egg donation and surrogacy are permitted according to many Orthodox decisors, pending religious fertility supervision.Haredi widow to become surrogate mother. Nissan Shtrauchler, Yediot Acharonot (In Israel, the \\"Embryo Carrying Agreements Law\\" was formulated to ensure that surrogacy agreements between Jewish Israelis do not conflict with Jewish laws concerning incest and adultery and that the child born of the arrangement will be recognized as a Jew.)Teman, Elly. 2010. Birthing a Mother: the Surrogate Body and the Pregnant Self. Berkeley: University of California Press. See also Kahn, Susan Martha. 2000. Reproducing Jews: A Cultural Account of Assisted Conception in Israel. Durham: Duke University Press. Those interested are recommended to contact their local Orthodox or Hasidic Rabbi, as these laws are obviously complicated, and as is customary. =Conservative Judaism= The official halachic legal authority for American Conservative Judaism is the Rabbinical Assembly's Committee on Jewish Law and Standards. They vote on proposed responsa. A responsa may be approved by either a majority or a minority vote, and individual Rabbis may rely on even minority-approved responsa for their rulings. Artificial insemination: AI is permitted whether the donor is the husband of the woman to be impregnated or not, although it is preferable to use the husband's sperm whenever possible. The sperm donor is considered the father for purposes of determining the child's tribal status and for issues of ritual consanguinity, therefore, the use of anonymous donors is strongly discouraged.Dorff, Rabbi Elliott. \\"Artificial Insemination, Egg Donation, and Adoption,\\" Committee on Jewish Law and Standards of the Conservative Rabbinical Assembly. Approved 20 in favor, 1 abstention, in 1994 Egg donation/Surrogacy: Surrogacy and egg donation are permissible and the birth mother, rather than the genetic mother, is considered the mother of the child, therefore conversion may be necessary if a non-Jewish woman acts as a gestational surrogate. A maximum of 3 embryos may be implanted at a time. Freezing and donation of embryos is permitted.Mackler, Rabbi Aaron L. \\"In Vitro Fertilization,\\" Committee on Jewish Law and Standards of the Conservative Rabbinical Assembly. Approved 20 in favor, 1 abstention, in 1995. The Conservative movement's position on \\"family purity\\" practices, reducing the amount of time after a woman's period during which she is prohibited to have sex, may also work as a pro-fertility measure. As part of its treatment of Tohorat HaMishpahah, the Conservative Assembly in 2006 accepted a position of eliminating the requirement for seven white days after the cessation of menses and establishing this as an optional custom. This is offered as a solution for women dealing with ovulation before mikvah by reducing the number of days with sexual relations being forbidden from an average of 12 to 5. Mid- cycle staining during ovulation, while ordinarily would prevent sexual relations by being considered zavah, is to be considered a result of ancillary circumstances (diet, medical treatment, physical exertion, or illness) and as such the emission is considered permissible, and the woman would not become a zavah. Drug therapies to avoid mid-cycle staining are deemed unnecessary with the risks of the drug side-effects outweighing the prohibition of zavah due to the commandment of hai bahem, (\\"[you shall] live by them\\"). =Other movements= Reform Judaism has generally approved artificial insemination by donor, in-vitro fertilization and surrogate motherhood.

She was impelled in that direction by her family's sometime residence in Argentina during her childhood, where her father held a responsible position as an astronomer. Sent home for her education, Bache Gould trained as a mathematician and undertook graduate studies in mathematics, teaching for a time at Carleton College, Minnesota. Enrolled at MIT, she failed to complete her thesis and obtain the PhD, due to poor health. Finding work as a mathematician subsequently proved difficult. Being fluent in Spanish, she began subsequently to follow her true interest in Spanish-American studies, working for several years in the educational system of Puerto Rico. She abandoned mathematics for history and began to do research on the colonization of the Americas by Spain. World War I found her doing research in Madrid, where she promptly volunteered for war work at the American Embassy there, and, sent home, in the United States. Subsequently, she found her way back to Spain, where she remained, doing research and publishing articles and a book on Agassiz. When the Spanish Civil War came along she retired to the United States, returning when it was over for the peak of her career. As a historian, her studies of Christopher Columbus and Queen Isabella I of Castile resulted in the most complete biographical account of Columbus' crew. In 1942, Gould became the only female corresponding member of Real Academia de la Historia and was awarded the Order of Isabella the Catholic (in 1952). Previously she had received other honors. Gould never married or had any children. She had close relationships with a few female friends, carried on mainly by correspondence. There is no evidence of any sexual involvement with either sex. One friend joked about the low-cut dresses she wore to Puerto Rico. As a researcher in Spain she was a highly respected aging unmarried lady with greying hair. Early life and education Alice Bache Gould was born on January 5, 1868, in Cambridge, Massachusetts, to Benjamin Apthorp Gould (1824-1896) and Mary Apthorp Quincy Gould (1834-1883). Her mother was part of the Quincy political family and a descendant of Rev. George Phillips who settled Watertown, Massachusetts in 1630. Her father, an astronomer, headed the Argentine National Observatory. Alice lived briefly with her family in Cordoba, Argentina before being sent back to Cambridge in 1871, to live with relatives. Alice lived mainly in the United States but frequently traveled to Argentina. Tragically, while on a birthday trip to the River Rio Primero on February 8, 1874, her older sisters Susan Morton Quincy Gould and Lucretia Goddard Gould and their nurse Alvina Fontaine were swept away and drowned. Alice and her younger siblings Mary and Benjamin were unable to help. In 1883, Alice Bache Gould suffered a further loss when her mother died. Her father finally returned from Argentina in 1885. Gould studied briefly at the Society for the Collegiate Instruction of Women in Cambridge (later Radcliffe College) in 1885, before attending Bryn Mawr College from 1886 to 1889. One of her close friends was Emily Greene Balch. She graduated from Bryn Mawr as a member of the school's second graduating class in 1889 with her A.B. in mathematics and physics. She went on to study at Massachusetts Institute of Technology and at Newnham College, Cambridge in England from 1890-1893. Although Newnham allowed women to attend classes, it did not yet grant them degrees. After teaching briefly at Carleton College in Northfield, Minnesota, she became a graduate student in mathematics at the University of Chicago in 1894, studying with E. H. Moore. However, her father's death in 1896, the end of her fellowship, and poor health, prevented her from completing her thesis on Brocardian geometry, a type of geometry developed by Henri Brocard. She returned to Cambridge to recover her health. On November 17, 1897, Alice fulfilled one of her father's ambitions by donating $20,000 to the National Academy of Sciences for the Benjamin Apthorp Gould Fund to support researchers and \\"advance the science of astronomy\\". The New York Times identified it at the time as \\"one of the largest funds in the country\\". Puerto Rico In 1901, Gould published a historical monograph on Louis Agassiz in Mark Antony De Wolfe Howe's series of Beacon Biographies of Eminent Americans. She was commended for her descriptions of Agassiz's personality and the Brazilian landscapes. In 1903 Gould traveled to Puerto Rico, where she spent much of the next seven years. Gould started a \\"Porto Rico Teachers' Fund\\" to raise money for a nursing school around 1905. She was also a contributor to the Kissinger Relief Fund for the study of yellow fever in 1907, and was approached by Bailey K. Ashford about supporting a Puerto Rican school of tropical medicine. Later in life, between 1941 and 1947, Gould donated approximately 1,500 items on Puerto Rico to the United States Library of Congress. Spain and the new world During her stay in South America, Gould became interested in the colonization of the Americas, and began to write an article on the early colonization of Barbados. In 1911, she went to Spain, stopping to do research on Christopher Columbus and Queen Isabella I of Castile at the Archivo de Simancas and other Spanish archives. She spent much of the rest of her life there. =World War I= During World War I Gould went to the United States Embassy in Madrid where she volunteered in the espionage office. She led an effort to send female clerical workers to the embassy to assist staff there. In March 1918, she returned to Boston, expecting to remain there for only a few months. When she realized that she would not be able to return to Spain for some time, she tried to obtain war work in the United States that would allow her to use her mathematical training. Few options were available, but she eventually had the choice of assisting Forest Ray Moulton at the Ordnance Department in Washington, D.C., doing \\"routine and monotonous\\" work as a \\"computer\\", or helping her former advisor, E. H. Moore, to teach classes in navigation to Naval ROTC students at the University of Chicago. She chose to work with Moore, and enjoyed being useful to the war effort. She became particularly interested in the mathematical techniques of great-circle navigation, and began to write her own text on the subject. By 1919, she was no longer needed at the University of Chicago. She did not complete her proposed text. =Columbian researches= Gould's first published paper on Spanish colonization of the Americas appeared in the Bulletin of the Real Academia de la Historia (the Bulletin of the Spanish Royal Academy of History) in 1924. In 1925, she returned to Spain to continue her Columbian researches. Over the next 42 years, the results of her research were predominantly published there. In 1984, those publications were collected and republished as Nueva lista documentada de los tripulantes de Colon 1492. =Spanish Civil War= During the Spanish Civil War in 1936 Gould returned briefly to Boston. During this stay in Boston she supported another philanthropic cause. In 1937, she was a major contributor when the historical Josiah Quincy House became the property of the Society for the Preservation of New England Antiquities. After the Spanish civil war, Gould again returned to Spain. =Crist√≥bal Col√≥n and his men= As a result of her researches, Gould was able to specifically identify the crew members who accompanied Columbus on his transatlantic voyage in 1492, to describe them and their historical situation in detail, and to correct a number of historical errors. Gould's articles identified 87 of the 90 crewmen. Her studies showed that only four of the Columbus crew had problems with the law, destroying the version that most of them were criminals and jailbirds. She also demonstrated that no Englishman, Irishman or other North European was aboard the Columbus ships. and proved that Pedro de Lepe, whose existence had long been disputed, had sailed with Columbus on the Santa Mar√≠a. Gould found a certified copy of the document that recognized Columbus's descendants rights to his privileges,Crist√≥bal Col√≥n, Yakov Svet, Jaime Pe√±a Novoa. Libresa, 1996. Page 26 and was praised particularly for ability to read the penmanship of the court scribes. She is credited with saving documents that would otherwise have been discarded and destroyed. Samuel Eliot Morison, who won the Pulitzer Prize for his biography of Christopher Columbus, Admiral of the Ocean Sea (1942), described Gould as follows: a \\"distinguished, gray- haired lady, dressed usually in black bombazine with a vintage hat, striding resolutely into the Archive of the Indies to find some document for me that the archivist insisted did not exist.\\" He strongly praised her scholarship, which he considered \\"the most valuable piece of Columbian research in the present [20th] century.\\" Awards In 1942, Gould became the only female corresponding member of Real Academia de la Historia. In 1947, she became an honorary member of the Colonial Society of Massachusetts, the first woman to be accepted into membership. In 1952, she was awarded the Order of Isabella the Catholic, presented in Seville by Joaquin Ruiz Jimenez, the Spanish Minister of Education. Later life Six years before her death, Gould collapsed of sunstroke in the street, and was told to spend less time working. Gould died of a cerebral hemorrhage on July 25, 1953, in the garden at Simancas Castle, near the archives. Being of Congregationalist Protestant extraction, she is interred in the English Cemetery of Madrid, which is reserved for non-Catholics. A stone book on her grave is inscribed with her name. After her death, a plaque was placed at the entryway to honor \\"Miss Alice B. Gould illustrious North American researcher and a great friend of Spain. She worked in this archive for forty years and died at its entrance on the 25 of July 1953‚Äù. The original Spanish reads: \\"A miss Alice B. Gould, ilustre investigadora norteamericana y gran amiga de Espa√±a. trabaj√≥ en este archivo durante cuarenta a√±os y muri√≥ a su entrada el d√≠a 25 de julio de 1953\\". A square in Simancas, Spain was named after her. Works Gould's papers and collected materials are contained in a number of archives, including the Massachusetts Historical Society, the United States Library of Congress, the Elmer Holmes Bobst Library in New York City, and the Spanish Royal Academy of History.

Since Lausanne 1974, integral mission has influenced a significant number of evangelicals around the world.  Terminology  It is generally known in Spanish as misi√≥n integral, coined in the 1970s by members of the evangelical group Latin American Theological Fellowship (or FTL, its Spanish acronym). The word \\"integral\\" is used in Spanish to describe wholeness (as in wholemeal bread or whole wheat). Theologians use it to describe an understanding of Christian mission that affirms the importance of expressing the love of God and neighborly love through every means possible. Proponents such as C. Ren√© Padilla of Ecuador, Samuel Escobar of Peru, Orlando E. Costas of Puerto Rico, Vinay Samuel of India, and John Stott from the UK, have wanted to emphasize the breadth of the Good News and of the Christian mission, and used the concept of \\"integral\\" or \\"holistic\\" mission to signal their discomfort with conceptions of Christian mission based on a dichotomy between evangelism and social involvement. The proponents of integral mission argue that the concept is nothing new. Rather, it is rooted in Scripture and wonderfully exemplified in Jesus‚Äô own ministry. \\"Integral mission\\" is only a distinct vocabulary for a holistic understanding of mission that has become important in the past forty years in order to distinguish it from widely held but dualistic approaches that emphasize either evangelism or social responsibility. History The process of defining integral mission and the journey of its acceptance by significant numbers of Evangelicals has taken place over a period of just over 40 years. Its progress can be observed through a number of significant international Evangelical congresses. In 1966, the Congress on the World Mission of the Church, held in Wheaton, Illinois, brought together Evangelicals from 71 countries. The Wheaton Declaration confessed that ‚Äúwe [Evangelicals] are guilty of an unscriptural isolation from the world that too often keeps us from honestly facing and coping with its concerns‚Äù and the ‚Äúfailure [of the church] to apply scriptural principles to such problems as racism, war, population explosion, poverty, family disintegration, social revolution, and communism.‚Äù By contrast, that same year the World Congress on Evangelization in Berlin continued to emphasise a traditionally Evangelical conception of mission, as articulated by Billy Graham: ‚Äúif the church went back to its main task of proclaiming the gospel and people converted to Christ, it would have a far greater impact on the social, moral and psychological needs of men than it could achieve through anything else it could possibly do. However, the question of Christian social involvement came up repeatedly during the ensuing regional congresses. The International Congress on World Evangelization in Lausanne in 1974 is regarded by some as \\"the most important world-wide evangelical gathering of the twentieth century.\\" The Lausanne Covenant affirmed that: > God is both the Creator and the Judge of all men. We therefore should share > his concern for justice and reconciliation throughout human society and for > the liberation of men from every kind of oppression‚Ä¶ we express penitence > both for our neglect and for having sometimes regarded evangelism and social > concern as mutually exclusive. Following the Lausanne Congress, support for the concept of integral mission grew amongst evangelicals, particularly in the Two-Thirds World. A number of declarations which emerged from international evangelical conferences in the ensuing years (some of them organized by the Lausanne Movement and chaired by John Stott) revealed similar concerns for a holistic understanding of mission. Of critical importance for the development of the theology of integral mission were the various Latin American Congresses on Evangelism (CLADE, their Spanish acronym‚ÄîConsejo Latinoamericano de Evangelizaci√≥n). Beginning with the Second Latin America Congress on Evangelism, held in Peru in 1979, the CLADES (III, Quito, 1992; IV, Quito, 2000) were organized by the Latin American Theological Fellowship (FTL). In the UK, the International Consultation on Simple Lifestyle in 1980 resulted in a document entitled \\"An Evangelical Commitment to Simple Lifestyle,\\" again affirming a commitment to justice within an Evangelical conception of mission. In 1982 the International Consultation on the Relationship of Evangelism and Social Responsibility concluded that the latter is a consequence of, a bridge to and partner of the former. The document published maintained the primacy of evangelism however, despite its affirmation that the two are, in practice, ‚Äúinseparable‚Äù. In 1983, the Consultation on the Church in Response to Human Need in Wheaton, Illinois, led to the publication of \\"Transformation: The Church in Response to Human Need,\\" perhaps the strongest evangelical affirmation of integral Mission. It is explicit in its denunciation of injustice, and churches and Christina organisations who \\"by silence give their tacit support\\" to \\"the socio-economic status-quo.\\" The last decade A commitment to integral mission is often reflected in particular concern for those living in poverty and a commitment to pursuing justice. The concept of integral mission is advocated largely by Evangelical Christians, many of whom are related to the Micah Network.http://www.micahnetwork.org/resource-topics?topic=integral+mission In 1999 a global network of evangelical Christian organisations committed to Integral Mission was established and christened the Micah Network, which owes its name to the centrality of Micah 6:8 to the concept of Integral Mission: > What does the Lord require of you but to do justice, and to love kindness, > and to walk humbly with your God. Their members represent approximately 600 Evangelical service organizations, churches and individual members around the world.

They pursue their mission through a nationwide network of partners involved in a cutting- edge Civic Health Initiative, annual cross-sector conferences, and engagement with a broad spectrum of individuals and organizations interested in utilizing civic engagement principles and practices to enhance their work. Connecting people for the purpose of strengthening civic life is NCoC's goal. At the core of NCoC's joint efforts is the belief that every person has the ability to help his or her community and country thrive. NCoC was chartered by Congress in 1953 to harness the patriotic energy and national civic involvement surrounding World War II. In 2009, Congress named NCoC in the Edward M. Kennedy Serve America Act, expanding their Civic Health Initiative to become the nation's largest measure of civic engagement. For the past 10 years NCoC, together with the Corporation for National and Community Service (CNCS) and state and community level collaborative networks across the nation, has documented the state of civic life in America in city, state, and national Civic Health Index (CHI) reports. NCoC plans to establish CHI partnerships in all 50 states and the District of Columbia by 2020. The Civic Health Initiative has been an incubator for programs such as the Civic Data Challenge and The Civic 50. The Civic Data Challenge was a national competition to turn the raw data of civic health into useful applications and visualizations. The Civic 50 is an initiative to identify the 50 most community-minded companies in the nation. The Annual Conference on Citizenship is NCoC's signature event. Held in proximity to Citizenship Day (also known as Constitution Day) in the fall, NCoC convenes leaders in the field of civic engagement to exchange information and to discuss ways to progress their shared mission of encouraging Americans to become fully involved citizens. In addition to the Annual Conference, NCoC has partnered with institutions to host and convene programs, events, webinars, and discussions throughout the year. After 2013, NCoC expanded their programs to promote national service. They took a leading role in the creation of the Service Year technology platform. They worked in partnership with the Franklin Project at the Aspen Institute. The platform is an online marketplace designed to increase service opportunities for Americans between 18‚Äì28 years old. It brings together young people seeking service positions, organizations seeking service members, and funders looking to support these efforts. Mission statement NCoC is a congressionally chartered organization dedicated to strengthening civic life in America. We believe every person has the power to help their community and country thrive. History =Origin: (1946-1953)= Purpose of NCoC: To Support and Strengthen the Efforts of the People in Maintaining the Blessings of Freedom and Justice and in Protecting and Perpetuating the Principles and Ideals upon which this Nation is Founded; to Develop a More Thorough Knowledge of Citizenship Rights and Responsibilities; to Inspire a Deeper Devotion to Citizenship Obligations; to Encourage Ever More Effective Participation in Citizenship Activities and to Promote a Spirit of Cooperation on the Part of all Citizens ‚Äì to these High Purposes, the National Conference on Citizenship is Dedicated. Founded in 1946, in the aftermath of the Second World War, NCoC was inspired by efforts of a diverse group of Americans and created with the goal of capturing and perpetuating, in peacetime, the spirit of cooperation and civic energy fostered during wartime. With the collective attention of the nation returning to domestic affairs, NCoC was imagined as a vehicle to highlight the critical importance of civic responsibility to the health of our republic so that all citizens might dedicate themselves to upholding continuously our concept of government and the democratic way of life. The First National Conference on Citizenship was held on May 17‚Äì18, 1946 in Philadelphia, PA =Congressional Charter= On August 13, 1953, President Dwight Eisenhower signed a bill that was passed by both houses of Congress that incorporated the Conference; allowing the NCoC to now operate under a Federal Charter. A Federal Charter is federal statue that establishes a co- operation between the government and organizations, agencies, or institutions. In 1953, the goal of the Congressional Charter was to empower ‚Äúthe NCoC to translate its ideals and objectives into realities. Plans for the future include both long-range and immediate projects and activates. The Conference will initiate and conduct some of these activities directly. Other, it will encourage and assist organizations and agencies in States and communities to initiate and carry on.‚Äù There are approximately 1,478,000 non-profits in America‚Äî94 of them are chartered by Congress. =Present: (2004- Present)= In 2006, NCoC convened a working group to create the first ‚ÄúAmerica‚Äôs Civic Health Index.‚Äù Utilizing a variety of indicators, the Civic Health Index (CHI) provides insight into civic trends at the national, state, city, and demographic level. In 2009, Congress named NCoC in the Edward M. Kennedy Serve America Act. This legislation codified and expanded NCoC's CHI helping it become the nation's largest and most definitive measure of civic engagement. In 2012, NCoC launched two new programs: * The Civic 50 is an initiative to identify the 50 most community-minded companies in the nation. The Civic 50 surveys and ranks S&P; 500 corporations on how they engage with the communities they serve and institutionalize these practices in their corporate culture. 2013 Rankings * Civic Data Challenge is a nationwide online competition that brings together tech, design, and nonprofit professionals together with local community leaders and organization to create apps, websites, and other tools to be used to increase civic participation. View the 2013 winners. In 2013, NCoC started its partnership with the Franklin Project at the Aspen Institute to develop a Service Year technology platform. This system aims to be a 21st-century tool that will increase the number of organizations that can provide national service opportunities and make it easier for young Americans to identify those positions. Structure =Staff= *Sterling Speirn, CEO *Jeff Coates, Research and Evaluation Director *Lisa Matthews, Program Director *Cameron Blossom, Communications Consultant *Angela Holden, Office Manager & Special Projects =Board of Directors= The National Conference on Citizenship's current Board of Directors consists of Barry Byrd, Lattie Coor, Philip Duncan, Paula Ellis, Eric Federing, Garrett Graff (Chair), Hon. Bob Graham, Gail Leftwich Kitch, A.G. Newmyer, Craig Turk, Michael Weiser (Chair Emeritus), and Erica Williams. =Board of Advisors= The National Conference on Citizenship's Board of Advisors consists of the following individuals: :Diana Aviv, Independent Sector :James Basker, Barnard College :John Bridgeland, Civic Enterprises (Chairman) :Jean Case, The Case Foundation :Frank Damrell, U.S District Court Judge (CA) :John J.

At NCoC, ‚Äúcivic health‚Äù is considered the way that communities are organized to define and address public problems. Communities with strong indicators of civic health have higher employment rates, stronger schools, better physical health, and more responsive governments. For the past 10 years NCoC, together with the Corporation for National and Community Service (CNCS) and state and community level collaborative networks across the nation, has documented the state of civic life in America in city, state, and national CHI reports. CHIs use a range of indicators including volunteering, voting, connections to civic and religious organizations, trust in other Americans and key institutions, and other civic behavior and attitudes. CHI partnerships have changed the way governments go about their work, reintroduced civics to classrooms, redirected investments, influenced national and local conversations resulting in enhancing civic life, and bolstered a network of civic leaders across the country. By 2020, NCoC's goal is to integrate this pioneering initiative into ongoing partnerships in all 50 states and the District of Columbia. America's Civic Health Index received a new level of recognition through its inclusion in the Edward M. Kennedy Serve America Act, which was signed into law in May 2009. The Act formalized a partnership between NCoC, the U.S. Census Bureau, and the Corporation for National and Community Service to develop, refine, and implement an annual civic health assessment. In addition to the America's Civic Health Index report, the National Conference on Citizenship partners with local institutions to release state and city specific reports. NCoC currently works with over 30 local partners. =Annual Conference= The National Conference on Citizenship hosts an annual conference on or around Citizenship Day. NCoC convenes leaders in the field of civic engagement along with other individuals and organizations interested in utilizing civic engagement principles and practices to enhance their work. Connecting people for the purpose of strengthening civic life is the goal. Each year's conference revolves around a different theme that concerns various aspects of civic engagement on a multitude of levels, including corporate, institutional, and individual responsibility. Featured Annual Conference Speakers have included: Justice Antonin Scalia, former Justice Sandra Day O'Connor, Justice Anthony Kennedy, Senator Robert Byrd, Senator Harris Wofford, Senator Bob Graham, Jean Case, Sonal Shah, Minnesota Secretary of State Mark Ritchie, Scott Heiferman, Craig Newmark, & Sean Parker.

It is endemic to three of the Channel Islands of California, where it grows in coastal scrub habitat. This is a small shrub or subshrub generally growing up to one or 1.5 meters tall, and taller when in erect form, with a branching, woolly stem. The whitish, woolly oval leaves may be up to 20 centimeters long and are divided into many narrow lobes with edges curled under. The inflorescence is a cluster of 10 to 50 or more small flower heads, each on a short peduncle. The flower head has a center of hairy, glandular, star-shaped yellow disc florets and a fringe of four to nine yellow ray florets each about 2 millimeters long. The fruit is an achene a few millimeters long with a small pappus at the tip. Like many Channel Islands endemics, this plant was threatened with extinction by the herbivory of the feral goats living on the islands; the goats have since been removed and the plant is recovering.California Native Plant Society Rare Plant Profile Genetic analyses indicate that this species, previously called Eriophyllum nevinii, did not come from the same common ancestor as the other Eriophyllum species and so is not a close enough relative to be included in that genus.Rosatti, T., Ed.

On 30 August 1975, during construction, there was a flood, and the scaffolding and shuttering for the westernmost span collapsed. The completed bridge has already required strengthening due to flood damage, showing that the Tyne has lost none of its capability for attacking bridge structures.

Armenians had a historic presence in Nakhchivan (, ). According to an Armenian tradition, Nakhchivan was founded by Noah, of the Abrahamic religions. During the Soviet era, Nakhchivan saw a significant demographic shift. The Armenian population saw a great reduction in their numbers throughout the years repatriating to Armenia. Nakhchivan's Armenian population gradually decreased to around 0%. Still some Armenian political groupings of Armenia and the Armenian diaspora, claim that Nakhchivan should belong to Armenia. The Medieval Armenian cemetery of Jugha (Julfa) in Nakhchivan, regarded by Armenians as the biggest and most precious repository of medieval headstones marked with Christian crosses ‚Äì khachkars (of which more than 2,000 were still there in the late 1980s), was completely demolished by 2006. History =6th century BC to 4th century AD= Nakhchivan became part of the Satrapy of Armenia under Achaemenid Persia c. 521 BC. In 189 BC, Nakhchivan was part of the new Kingdom of Armenia established by Artaxias I. The area's status as a major trade center allowed it to prosper, though because of this, it was coveted by many foreign powers. According to historian Faustus of Byzantium (4th century), when the Sassanid Persians invaded Armenia, Sassanid King Shapur II (310-380) removed 2,000 Armenian and 16,000 Jewish families in 360-370.ARMENIA, by Richard Gottheil, Herman Rosenthal, Louis Ginzberg =5th to 18th century= In 428, the Armenian Arshakuni monarchy was abolished and Nakhchivan was annexed by Sassanid Persia. In 623 AD, possession of the region passed to the Byzantine Empire. Nakhchivan itself became part of the autonomous Principality of Armenia under Arab control.Mark Whittow. The Making of Byzantium, 600-1025, p. 210. After the fall of the Arab rule in the 9th century, the area became the domain of several Muslim emirates of Arran and Azerbaijan. Nakhchivan became part of the Seljuk Empire in the 11th century, followed by becoming the capital of the Atabegs of Azerbaijan in the 12th century. In the 1220s it was plundered by Khwarezmians and Mongols. In the 15th century, the weakening Mongol rule in Nakhchivan was forced out by the Turcoman dynasties of Kara Koyunlu and Ak Koyunlu. Great Soviet Encyclopedia. Nakhchivan Autonomous Soviet Socialist Republic In the 16th century, control of Nakhchivan passed to the Safavid dynasty of Persia. Because of its geographic position, it frequently suffered during the wars between Persia and the Ottoman Empire in the 14th to 18th centuries. In 1604, Shah Abbas I Safavi, concerned that the lands of Nakhchivan and the surrounding areas would pass into Ottoman hands, decided to institute a scorched earth policy. He forced the entire local population, Armenians, Jews and Muslims alike, to leave their homes and move to the Persian provinces south of the Aras River.The Status of Religious Minorities in Safavid Iran 1617-61, Vera B. Moreen, Journal of Near Eastern Studies Vol. 40, No. 2 (Apr, 1981), pp.128-129 Many of the deportees were settled in the neighborhood of Isfahan that was named New Julfa since most of the residents were from the original Julfa (a predominantly Armenian town). In the 14th and 15th centuries, residents of 28 Armenian settlements in Nakhchivan converted to Roman Catholicism influenced by preachings of a Dominican priest from Bologna named Bartholomew. Services in the Armenian language were delivered to them by Dominican priests for at least the next 350 years. At the time of the French traveller Jean Chardin's visit to Nakhchivan in the 1670s, only 8 of the original 28 villages remained loyal to Catholicism, and the rest had returned to the jurisdiction of the Armenian patriarch due to \\"heavy impositions upon them\\" with the remaining Catholics \\"not likely to hold out long.\\" The largest of the remaining Catholic villages was Abrener.Chardin, John. \\"The travels of Sir John Chardin, by the way of the Black Sea, through the countries of Circassia, Mingrelia, the country of the Abcas, Georgia, Armenia, and Media, into Persia proper: 1643-1713.\\" Voyages and Travels in All Parts of the World.

Brockhaus and Efron Encyclop√¶dia. =19th century to early 1920= After the last Russo-Persian War and the Treaty of Turkmenchay, the Nakhchivan khanate passed into Russian possession in 1828. Aleksandr Griboyedov, the Russian envoy to Persia, stated that by the time Nakhchivan came under Russian rule, only 17% of its residents were Armenians, while the remainder of the population (83%) were Muslims. After the resettlement initiative which encouraged massive Armenian immigration in the South Caucasus from the Ottoman Empire and Iran, the number of Armenians had increased to 45% while Muslims remained the majority at 55%. Armenian migrants mainly arrived to Nakhchivan from Urmia, Khoy and Salmas.On the History and Ethnography of Nakhchivan. K.N. Smirnov. Tiflis, 1934 With a dramatic increase in the Armenian and Muslim population, Griboyedov noted friction arising between them. The Nakhchivan khanate was dissolved in 1828, its territory was merged with the territory of the Erivan khanate and the area became the Nakhchivan uyezd of the new Armenian oblast, which later became the Erivan Governorate in 1849. According to official statistics of the Russian Empire, by the turn of the 20th century Azerbaijanis made up 57% of the uyezd's population, while Armenians constituted 42%. At the same time in the Sharur-Daralagyoz uyezd, the territory of which would form the northern part of modern-day Nakhchivan, Azeris constituted 70.5% of the population, while Armenians made up 27.5%. Brockhaus and Efron Encyclopedic Dictionary. \\"Sharur- Daralagyoz uyezd\\". St. Petersburg, Russia, 1890-1907 During the Russian Revolution of 1905, conflict erupted between the Armenians and the Azeris, culminating in the Armenian-Tatar massacres. In the final year of World War I, Nakhchivan was the scene of more bloodshed between Armenians and Azerbaijanis, who both laid claim to the area. By 1914, the Armenian population was at 40% while the Azeri population increased to roughly 60%.Ian Bremmer and Ray Taras. New States, New Politics: Building Post-Soviet Nations, p. 484. After the February Revolution, the region was under the authority of the Special Transcaucasian Committee of the Russian Provisional Government and subsequently of the short-lived Transcaucasian Democratic Federative Republic. When the TDFR was dissolved in May 1918, Nakhchivan, Nagorno-Karabakh, Zangezur (today the Armenian province of Syunik), and Qazakh were heavily contested between the newly formed and short-lived states of the First Republic of Armenia and the Azerbaijan Democratic Republic (ADR). In June 1918, the region came under Ottoman occupation. Under the terms of the Armistice of Mudros, the Ottomans agreed to pull their troops out of the Transcaucasus to make way for the forthcoming British military presence. Under British occupation, Sir John Oliver Wardrop, British Chief Commissioner in the South Caucasus, made a border proposal to solve the conflict. According to Wardrop, Armenian claims against Azerbaijan should not go beyond the administrative borders of the former Erivan Governorate (which under prior Imperial Russian rule encompassed Nakhchivan), while Azerbaijan was to be limited to the governorates of Baku and Elisabethpol. This proposal was rejected by both Armenians (who did not wish to give up their claims to Qazakh, Zangezur and Karabakh) and Azeris (who found it unacceptable to give up their claims to Nakhchivan). As disputes between both countries continued, it soon became apparent that the fragile peace under British occupation would not last. In December 1918, with the support of Azerbaijan's Musavat Party, Jafargulu Khan Nakhchivanski declared the Republic of Aras in the Nakhchivan uyezd of the former Erivan Governorate assigned to Armenia by Wardrop. The Armenian government did not recognize the new state and sent its troops into the region to take control of it. The conflict soon erupted into the violent Aras War.Dr. Andrew Andersen, Ph.D. Atlas of Conflicts: Armenia: Nation Building and Territorial Disputes: 1918-1920. By mid-June 1919, however, Armenia succeeded in establishing control over Nakhchivan and the whole territory of the self-proclaimed republic. The fall of the Aras republic triggered an invasion by the regular Azerbaijani army and by the end of July, Armenian troops were forced to leave Nakhchivan City to the Azerbaijanis. Again, more violence erupted leaving some ten thousand Armenians dead and forty-five Armenian villages destroyed. Meanwhile, feeling the situation to be hopeless and unable to maintain any control over the area, the British decided to withdraw from the region in mid-1919. Still, fighting between Armenians and Azeris continued and after a series of skirmishes that took place throughout the Nakhchivan district, a cease-fire agreement was concluded. However, the cease-fire lasted only briefly, and by early March 1920, more fighting broke out, primarily in Karabakh between Karabakh Armenians and Azerbaijan's regular army. This triggered conflicts in other areas with mixed populations, including Nakhchivan. In mid-March 1920, Armenian forces launched an offensive on all of the disputed territories, and by the end of the month both the Nakhchivan and Zangezur regions came under stable but temporary Armenian control. =1920 to present= In July 1920, the 11th Soviet Red Army invaded and occupied the region and on July 28, declared the Nakhchivan Autonomous Soviet Socialist Republic with \\"close ties\\" to the Azerbaijan SSR. A referendum was called for the people of Nakhchivan to be consulted. According to the formal figures of this referendum, held at the beginning of 1921, 90% of Nakhchivan's population wanted to be included in the Azerbaijan SSR \\"with the rights of an autonomous republic. The decision to make Nakhchivan a part of modern-day Azerbaijan was cemented March 16, 1921, in the Treaty of Moscow between Bolshevist Russia and Turkey. The agreement between the Soviet Russia and Turkey also called for attachment of the former Sharur-Daralagez uyezd (which had a solid Azeri majority) to Nakhchivan, thus allowing Turkey to share a border with the Azerbaijan SSR. This deal was reaffirmed on October 23, in the Treaty of Kars. During the Soviet era, Nakhchivan saw a significant demographic shift. Its Armenian population gradually decreased as many emigrated to the Armenian SSR. In 1926, 11% of region's population was Armenian. Some Armenian-populated locales of Nakhchivan were transferred under Armenia's jurisdiction by 1936, which decreased that number further.Andrew Andersen and George Egge. Armenian SSR - Territorial Adjustments in 1925-1936. 2010. By 1979, it shrunk to 1.4%. The Azeri population, meanwhile increased substantially with both a higher birth rate and immigration (going from 85% in 1926 to 96% by 1979). The Armenian population saw a great reduction in their numbers throughout the years repatriating to Armenia. Armenian political claims to Nakhchivan Some Armenian political groupings of the Republic of Armenia and the Armenian diaspora, most notably the Armenian Revolutionary Federation (ARF) claim Nakhchivan as part of United Armenia. The ARF programme for example states: The borders of United Armenia shall include all territories designated as Armenia by the Treaty of S√®vres as well as the regions of Nagorno-Karabakh (Artsakh), Javakhk, and Nakhchivan. However, Nakhchivan is not officially claimed by the government of Armenia. Armenian Foreign Minister Vardan Oskanyan reaffirmed this by stating that Armenia, as the legal successor to the Armenian SSR, is loyal to the Treaty of Kars and all agreements inherited by the former Soviet Armenian government. Destruction of Armenian khachkars in Nakhchivan According to an Institute for War and Peace Reporting (IWPR), the Medieval Armenian cemetery of Jugha (Julfa) in Nakhchivan, with its medieval Armenian headstones called khachkars (2,000 were still extant in the 1980s), was destroyed in 2006. The European Parliament have taken an interest in the fate of the cemetery and passed a resolution in February 2006, condemning the destruction of the cemetery, but its delegation has not been allowed to visit the site itself.Azerbaijan: Famous Medieval Cemetery Vanishes, Institute for War & Peace Reporting, 2006  Notable Armenians from Nakhchivan  *Hovnatanian (17th‚Äì19th centuries), a family of painters originally from Shurut village *Christapor Mikaelian (1859‚Äì1905), one of the three founders of the ARF, born in Agulis village *Stepan Sapah-Gulian (1861‚Äì1928), intellectual and leader of Social Democrat Hunchakian Party born in Djahri village *Manuk Abeghian (1865‚Äì1944), scholar of literature and folklore, born in Astabad village *Stepan Zorian (1867‚Äì1919), one of the three founders of the ARF, born in Tsghna village *Hasmik (Taguhi Hakobyan, 1878-1947) born in Nakhichevan city *Garegin Nzhdeh (1886‚Äì1955), military commander, statesman, born in Kznut village *Yakov Davydov (1888‚Äì1938), Soviet official, born in Verin Agulis *Aram Khachaturian (1903‚Äì1978), composer, born in Tbilisi, parents from the villages of Lower Aza and Upper Aza *Yervand Manaryan (b. 1924), actor, born in Iran, ancestors from Nakhchivan *Vladimir Sargsyan (1935‚Äì2013), mathematician *Argam Aivazian (b. 1947), historian and researcher, born in Arinj village *Aghvan Vardanyan (b. 1958), ARF politician, born in G√∂m√ºr village *Arthur Abraham (b. 1980), professional boxer, former IBF Middleweight Champion, born in Yerevan, ancestors from Nakhchivan See also *Nakhchivan Autonomous Republic *Armenians in Azerbaijan References Category:History of Nakhchivan ","title":"Armenians in Nakhchivan"},{"id":"23143358","text":"Stephen Marche (born 1976) is a Canadian novelist, essayist, and cultural commentator.

The bridge used to carry the Border Counties Railway over the River Tyne at Border Counties Junction with the Newcastle and Carlisle Railway. History The Border Counties Railway was authorised by Parliament in 1854. The bridge was part of that railway and linked the Newcastle and Carlisle Railway, near Hexham, with the Border Union Railway at . The first section of the route was opened between and in 1858, the remainder opening in 1862. The bridge was beset with problems from its construction when the temporary wooden structure erected initially to allow a crane access, was swept away by floods. The abutments at the south end had to be moved eastwards to avoid scouring of the river at its original site. Both weight and speed restrictions have always been a feature of the bridge. The bridge was reportedly damaged by floods in August 1948 and was given temporary repairs sufficient to keep the line open for a time. The condition of the bridge was a major factor in the eventual closure of the line, the cost of repairs being considered prohibitive. Regular passenger trains ceased on 13 October 1956 although the line (and the bridge) remained open for goods traffic until 1 September 1958. The bridge was demolished in 1959.

On March 17, 2009, North Korean Soldiers detained two American journalists, Euna Lee and Laura Ling, who were working for the U.S. independent cable television network Current TV (defunct since August 2013), after they crossed into North Korea from China without a visa. They were found guilty of illegal entry and sentenced to twelve years' hard labor in June 2009. North Korean leader Kim Jong-il pardoned the two on August 5, 2009, the day after former U.S. President Bill Clinton arrived in the country on a publicly unannounced visit. Background The Tumen River on the PRC-DPRK border, where the journalists were arrested. Korean American Euna Lee and Chinese American: \\"Ling is Chinese-American and a native of California\\"; : \\"The two women journalists Euna Lee, a Korean-American, and Laura Ling, a Chinese-American, were arrested two weeks ago\\" ... Laura Ling were journalists for Current TV, based in San Francisco, California. Lee was the news editor of the channel and Ling was one of the agency's reporters. Laura Ling is the younger sister of Lisa Ling, a special correspondent for The Oprah Winfrey Show and CNN, who did a documentary in 2005 for National Geographic Explorer about North Korea which involved entry into North Korea without disclosing she was a journalist. The two reporters were accompanied by two men, an American cameraman (Mitch Koss ) and a guide who was an ethnic Korean citizen of China. Pastor Chun Ki-won of refugee aid organization Durihana, who was interviewed in the 2005 National Geographic documentary Inside North Korea, had helped Lee and Ling organize their trip to China. After their arrival in China, Chun introduced Lee and Ling to Kim Seong-cheol (ÍπÄÏÑ±Ï≤†), an ethnic Korean citizen of China who served as a guide and escort for the two reporters during their work. Arrest and trial An unnamed diplomatic source was quoted by South Korea's Yonhap news agency on March 18 as stating: \\"Two reporters working for a US-based Internet news media outlet, including a Korean American, were detained by North Korean authorities earlier this week, and they remain in custody there.\\" Reports said that the journalists were both warned several times by the soldiers of Korean People's Army about crossing the border. They were said to have been reporting on the trafficking of women and shooting video of the border region of China and North Korea when they were arrested at the Tumen River. They were caught by two Korean People's Army soldiers, Son Yong-ho and Kim Chol. Their guide Kim Seong-cheol and cameraman Mitch Koss evaded capture by running away faster but were later detained by officers of China's Public Security Bureau. Koss departed China soon afterwards. In an interview in March, Chun speculated that the two reporters might have entered into North Korean territory. However, other sources such as Reporters Without Borders, echoing reporting by South Korean television station YTN, claim that North Korean border guards crossed the Tumen to the Chinese side to detain Ling and Lee. On April 23, 2015, Laura Ling herself released a story on a YouTube channel called Seeker Stories. She mentions that she was filming North Korea on Northeastern China's borders to report a story about North Korean defectors. While she was filming along the frozen Tumen River with the other crew, they were chased by North Korean soldiers. She was eventually knocked unconscious and dragged into North Korea by the soldiers and then was imprisoned until her release. On March 30, the Korean Central News Agency (KCNA), the state news agency of North Korea, reported that preparations were under way for indictments and a trial, saying, \\"The illegal entry of US reporters into the DPRK (Democratic People's Republic of Korea) and their suspected hostile acts have been confirmed by evidence and their statements.\\" The two faced trial on June 4. Sentencing and imprisonment On June 8, North Korean media reported that the two reporters had been found guilty of illegal entry and subsequently sentenced to twelve years of hard labor. Conditions in North Korea's prison camps are described as \\"extremely harsh\\". Prisoners in North Korean camps are subject to exposure, torture (including water torture), routine starvation, summary execution, daily beatings, and extended sentences without evidence. Following the trial, KCNA broadcast footage taken from Lee and Ling, which it claims showed them in the courtyard of a North Korean house. They reported that an investigation proved Lee and Ling to have crossed into North Korean territory with the intent to produce and broadcast a \\"documentary slandering the DPRK\\", and that the two admitted to committing \\"criminal acts\\". Lisa Ling read a statement on July 9 in which she stated her sister had indeed broken North Korean law; the two had recently spoken by telephone for the third time. Because the United States has no diplomatic relations with North Korea, the contact was handled through the Swedish ambassador in Pyongyang, Mats Foyer, who also visited the two reporters. Han Park, a professor of political science at the University of Georgia, went to North Korea to negotiate their release, but Hillary Clinton refused to say whether Park traveled on behalf of the U.S. government. Park stated that the two journalists were staying at a guest house and had not yet been transferred to prison. =Reactions= Vigils for journalists Laura Ling and Euna Lee were held throughout the United States on June 3, 2009. Reporters Without Borders characterized the trial and sentencing as a \\"sham trial\\". U.S. Secretary of State Hillary Clinton said at first that the charges against the journalists were \\"baseless\\". She had been considering sending an envoy to the country in an attempt to negotiate the journalists' release. However, it was later reported that the State Department would call on North Korea for \\"amnesty\\" for the two journalists; The Washington Post interpreted this as an admission by the U.S. government that the two are indeed guilty of an offense. The State Department had previously called for their release on \\"humanitarian\\" grounds. The co-founder of Current TV, former U.S. Vice President Al Gore, was also considered for travel to North Korea. According to Kim Tae-woo of the Korea Institute for Defense Analysis, a South Korean institute, \\"[t]he journalists considerably weakened their government's leverage against the North\\" in ongoing negotiations over the DPRK's nuclear program. William Stanton, the deputy chief of mission at the U.S. embassy in Seoul, reportedly expressed a similar but stronger view, calling the two journalists \\"stupid\\" and arguing that their arrest was \\"distracting from bigger issues\\" in April 8 remarks to several U.S. congressional staff visiting South Korea. One of Stanton's guests was so upset by his remarks that he wrote a memorandum of complaint to a member of Congress, which sparked wide discussion. Other South Koreans, including religious and human rights figures, similarly blamed Lee and Ling for actually endangering the subjects of their reporting. Lee Chan- woo, a Christian pastor who ran various North Korean refugee aid programs in China, had his house searched by Chinese police on March 19 and was then deported from the country in April. Five refugee safe-houses he ran were also shut down.  Bill Clinton's visit to North Korea  Former President Bill Clinton made an unannounced trip to Pyongyang on August 4, 2009. Clinton was accompanied by his personal physician Roger Band, Doug Band, Justin Cooper, David Straub, and former White House Chief of Staff John Podesta.Brown, Hayes (October 27, 2017). \\"That One Time Kim Jong Il Invited Bill Clinton To Vacation In North Korea\\" BuzzFeed News.\\"John Podesta: Stealth player in North Korean release?\\" Los Angeles Times.

Although the official news agency of North Korea, the Korean Central News Agency (KCNA), did not announce the reason for Clinton's arrival, Western and South Korean media speculated that Clinton went to Pyongyang in order to negotiate the release of Euna Lee and Laura Ling. White House spokesman Robert Gibbs confirmed that Clinton was on a \\"solely private mission to secure the release of two Americans.\\" Clinton met with North Korean leader Kim Jong-il and, according to KCNA, conveyed a verbal message to Kim from President Barack Obama although Robert Gibbs denied that Clinton was carrying any message from the Obama administration. Clinton and Kim had \\"an exhaustive conversation\\" that included \\"a wide-ranging exchange of views on the matters of common concern,\\" KCNA reported. KCNA also reported that the National Defence Commission of North Korea hosted a dinner in honor of Clinton, but did not go into detail about what was discussed at the reception. In the early morning hours of August 5, KCNA announced that Kim Jong-il had issued a pardon to Lee and Ling.

Return and aftermath  After being released from custody by the North Koreans, Lee and Ling were flown back to Los Angeles with Clinton and his delegation in a Boeing 737 owned by Hollywood producer and Clinton friend Steve Bing's company Shangri-La Entertainment. They landed at Bob Hope Airport on August 5, shortly before 6:00 a.m. local time (UTC‚àí7), where they were met by family and friends, as well as Al Gore. Ling spoke to the media, where she confirmed that they had not been sent to a hard labor camp, yet they lived in fear of being sent to one. Laura Ling spoke at the airport. In addition to thanking President Obama, President Clinton and Secretary Clinton, Vice President Gore, their loved ones, and others, she stated: > Thirty hours ago, Euna Lee and I were prisoners in North Korea. We feared > that at any moment we could be sent to a hard labor camp, and, then, > suddenly, were told that we were going to a meeting. We were taken to a > location and when we walked through the doors, we saw standing before us > President Bill Clinton. We were shocked but we knew instantly in our hearts > that the nightmare of our lives was finally coming to an end and now we > stand here home and free ... We are very grateful that we were granted > amnesty by the government of North Korea, and we are so happy to be home, > and we are just so anxious right now to be able to spend some quiet, private > time getting reacquainted with our families. Thank you so much. Gore told reporters that \\"President Obama and countless members of his administration have been deeply involved,\\" in the effort to bring the journalists home. According to an unnamed Obama administration official, the trip had been in the works for months, and Lee and Ling told their families that the North Koreans specifically asked for Bill Clinton to come to North Korea, and that they would be freed if he made the trip. Ling's husband, Iain Clayton, confirmed that sending Clinton to Pyongyang was the idea of the North Koreans. Hillary Clinton, on a multi-nation trip in Africa when Lee and Ling returned to the U.S., said that the Obama administration was \\"extremely excited\\" to see the two journalists reunited with their families. However, she denied that Bill Clinton apologized on behalf of the U.S. government to the North Koreans for Lee and Ling's actions. The Obama administration has stressed that Bill Clinton's trip was private, and only about the two journalists, not about other issues such as Pyongyang's nuclear program. \\"We have been working hard on the release of the two journalists, and we have always considered that a separate issue,\\" the Secretary of State said. The future of the United States' relationship with North Korea was \\"really up to them,\\" she concluded. On August 6, 2009, Laura Ling's sister, Lisa, stated that her sister had told her subsequent to the return that the two former prisoners had entered North Korea without permission, but after about \\"thirty seconds\\", they were arrested by border guards. Lisa Ling indicated that her sister plans to write an editorial about their treatment while detained by the North Koreans subsequent to the arrest. The two North Korean soldiers who caught Ling and Lee, Son Yong-ho and Kim Chol, were reportedly treated like heroes by their government; in December 2009, the Pyongyang-based Korean Central Television broadcast aired a special program with them, in which they discussed their experience of arresting the two journalists. They received a special award from Kim Jong-il, as well as extra leave time. Claims regarding border crossing Christian missionaries active among North Korean refugees in northeast China claim that the guide was involved in a scheme by North Koreans to set a trap and capture a \\"foreign prize\\" -- a journalist. Chun also had warned the reporters to avoid the border area. However, in a statement made after their release, Laura Ling denies Chun ever having warned them, \\"Among other things, Chun claimed that he had warned us not to go to the river. In fact, he was well aware of our plans because he had been communicating with us throughout our time in China, and he never suggested we shouldn't go.\\" After their return to the United States, Ling and Lee claimed, in a written statement posted on Current TV's web site, that they had spent only a brief time in North Korean territory before crossing the river back into China, but were pursued by North Korean soldiers who dragged them once again onto North Korean soil. A statement released by the Chinese government rejected these claims and a report by North Korea alleges footage from the journalists' camera showed the two knowingly entered North Korea and even intended to take home souvenirs. Kim Chol, one of the North Korean soldiers who arrested the two journalists, claimed in interviews on North Korean television that they attempted to bribe him for their release after they were caught, but that he rejected their offer.

The church building and rectory were listed together on the National Register of Historic Places in 1980. They were both included as contributing properties in the Jefferson Street Historic District in 2004. The parish's first rectory, which is now a private home, is also listed on the National Register as St. Mary's Rectory. It is located a few blocks to the east of the present church location at 610 E. Jefferson St. History Rev. Samuel Charles Mazzuchelli, OP Original rectory The first Mass in what is now Iowa City was celebrated by a frontier missionary, the Rev. Samuel Charles Mazzuchelli, OP, on December 20, 1840. It was attended by 28 people in a building that doubled as a private home and a hotel owned by Fred Haberstroh. The University of Iowa‚Äôs School of Business is currently on that location. The previous day, Mazzuchelli had arrived from St. Paul's Church in Burlington and bought two lots for $2,000 on which the church and rectory stand today. St Mary's parish was established by Mazzuchelli in 1841, and he designed a small frame building that would serve as a church. The cornerstone for the Greek Revival structure was laid on July 12, 1841, by Bishop Mathias Loras of Dubuque. The building, named St. Mary of the Assumption, was largely completed by 1842. Several priests, including the Rev. J.A.M. Pelamourgues from St. Anthony's in Davenport celebrated Mass in the new church. In 1844 the parish had grown to about 70 families and the Rev. Anthony Godfert was assigned the parish's first pastor. A year later he established St. Joseph Cemetery to the northeast of the city. Godfert left the parish in 1846 and the parish was served by visiting clergy again for the next two years. Father Pelamourgues came again, as did J.G. Perodin, Joseph Cretin, and John Alleman. In 1848 the Rev. F.B. Poyet was named pastor and the parish has not been without a pastor since then. In the 1850s the parish's first choir was organized and a gallery was added to the interior of the church. The original rectory was built during the pastorate of the Rev. Mathias Hannon in 1853. When Hannon arrived in 1852, the foreign-born Catholic population in Iowa City was growing, especially the Germans and the Bohemians. In 1862 St. Francis Xavier Church was established for the pastoral care of Bohemian immigrants. That church burned to the ground in 1869 and the parishioners returned to St. Mary's. The Rev. William Emonds became the pastor in 1858. During his pastorate of 32 years saw the expansion of Catholic education and the building of the present church. He also served more than the Iowa City parish. He is credited with establishing 44 parishes, and he built churches in many of them. Initially, Father Emonds extended the original church to the north for more space, but it became obvious a new church was needed. The cornerstone for the present church was laid on October 27, 1867. Hugh Gilles of Dubuque, Iowa and A. Groebel of Chicago were contracted to build the new church. The new building was built over the old church as the parish continued to worship there. When the new building's roof was completed the old structure was torn down. with It took two years to build the church, although the tall spire would be completed at a later date. By the time it was dedicated the main altar, pews, pulpit, and stained glass windows were in place. The new church was dedicated by Bishop John Hennessey of Dubuque on August 15, 1869, as St. Mary of the Visitation Church. It was the first consecrated church in the Diocese of Dubuque. The construction costs of the new church were $75,000. The tower was completed in 1873 and the spire and cross were added in 1874. A 17-bell carillon was added to the tower in 1885. St. Mary's parish was divided when other parishes were established in Iowa City. St. Patrick's was founded in 1872 and their church was built a few blocks south of St. Mary's in 1879. Another parish to serve the Bohemian community was established in 1891 when St. Wenceslaus was founded. St. Thomas More was founded in 1944 as the Newman Center before it became an independent parish. The current Rectory The parish became a part of the Diocese of Davenport when it was established in 1881. The parish's rectory was moved four blocks to the east in 1891 by the Rev. John F. Kempker and the following year the present rectory was built during the pastorate of Msgr. A.J. Schulte, who would serve the parish for nearly 50 years. The rectory was designed to match the church, and was built for $8,000. Renovations were done to the church building in 1908 under Msgr. Schulte. The work included sixteen buttresses to strengthen the building, a new cross and spire were built, a basement was dug below the church, and the church interior was redecorated. A local builder and parishioner J.J. Hotz did the buttressing. The church was once again redecorated for the parish centennial in 1941 during the pastorate of Msgr. Carl Meinberg. The present pews were added at that time. Liturgical changes were made after the Second Vatican Council during the pastorate of the Rev. John Morrissey. Changes included a new altar so the priest could face the congregation. Masses were now celebrated in English rather than Latin. Another renovation of the church occurred in the early 1980s under the leadership of the Rev. Henry Griener. The pipe organ was rebuilt in 1981. A parish hall was built in the basement of the church in 1982, and the church interior was redecorated in 1983. The church renovation included removal of the communion rail, new carpet, reconciliation rooms, altar, ambo and chairs. The tabernacle was moved from the high altar to a side altar. Another redecorating project occurred around 2000 by the Rev. Kenneth Kunz, which included moving the baptismal font near the front door and new carpeting. The parish council was initiated by Father Morrissey in 1969. From 1971-1980, Father Morrissey and the Rev. Carlos Leveling served the parish as co-pastors. In 1986 the concept of sacrificial giving was introduced to the parish and it started the practice of tithing a percentage of the parish income. About the same time, the parish offices were moved out of the rectory to a house just east of the church. In 1988 the church tower was reconstructed. Another house was added to the parish offices and the two buildings were renovated for expanded office space by the Rev. Thomas Doyle in 1992. At the same time, the parish hired its first youth minister. Today, approximately 1,700 families belong to the parish. The interior of St. Mary's Church. The Moline pipe organ of St. Mary's Church. Architecture The church was constructed of red brick on a stone foundation, and it has stone trim. The Romanesque Revival style is evoked by the use of the round arch for the entrance portals, the windows, and bell tower elements. Its form and verticality, however, are more prevalent of the Gothic Revival style. The side elevations are seven bays in length and are divided by buttresses that are flanked by flat brick pilasters. Each bay contains a stained glass window and a corbel table just below the eaves. The east side of the church building has two brick structures that cover side entrances into the basement. On the west side is a brick structure that covers a handicap entrance into the church itself. The main facade is dominated by a two-stage, central bell tower that is capped by an octagon-shaped spire. At the base of the tower is the main entrance into the church. The tower is flanked by narrower side entrances. The three entrance portals are framed by compound round arches that feature limestone keystones and impost blocks. Above the main entrance is two pairs of round arch windows, and above them is the bell chamber whose cornices are arched to accommodate a clock on each face of the tower. The building is capped by a gable roof with no exterior apse on the rear of the building. The rectangular structure features a large open interior without columns. The arches of the vaulted ceiling rise from impost blocks that are set high on the walls. The tall wooden high altar created by Alert and Kloustie of Cincinnati features a painting of the Visitation, which is flanked by statues of Saint Patrick and Saint Boniface. Above the painting is a statue of Saint Anne with Mary as a child. On the lower level of the reredos are statues of the Four Evangelists. The small crucifix in the center is flanked by statues of angels holding grapes and wheat in reference to the elements of the Eucharist. The former altar frontal bears the images of the four great Western Church Fathers Saints Jerome, Augustine of Hippo, Ambrose, and Gregory the Great. They flank an image of the Lamb and the scroll with seven seals from the Book of Revelation. The altar of the Blessed Virgin Mary was installed in 1872. The main statue of Mary is flanked by statues of Saints Bernard of Clairvaux and Bonaventure. Below them are bas-reliefs of Old Testament Prophets Moses, David, Isaiah, and Ezekiel. The Saint Joseph altar was installed in 1900. The main statue of Joseph is flanked by statues of Saints Aloysius Gonzaga and Anthony of Padua. The Moline pipe organ, which is still in use, was installed in 1883 in the rear gallery. The Stations of the Cross are plaster bas-reliefs that were purchased by Father Emonds on one of his trips back to his native Germany. Along the side walls of the nave are statues of the Twelve Apostles. The rectory is a wood-frame structure that is covered with brick veneer. The house is essentially a large box capped with a pointed hip roof. There are large gabled wall dormers that end in shoulder parapets on the east and south elevations. The main facade is asymmetrical and is dominated by a projecting window bay of the southeast corner and the large porch on the southwest corner. The porch features large semicircular brick arches that complement the church's Romanesque Revival style. St. Mary's School The former convent, now a part of the Newman Center, was located next to the school building. In 1844 Father Godfert started the parish's first school in the basement of the church with Miss Norma O'Connor as the first teacher. The Sisters of Charity of the Blessed Virgin Mary arrived in Iowa City in 1860 to teach at St. Mary's. They also opened St. Agatha's Seminary, a school for girls, in 1861. In 1865 St. Joseph Institute, a school for advanced learning, was established by Father Emonds. It was taught by lay teachers and closed around 1890. In 1892 the parish acquired property on the corner of Clinton and Jefferson Streets. The cornerstone for the new school was laid on September 11, 1892 on that location. The new school opened in 1893 with Franciscan Sisters teaching there until 1895, when the Sisters of Charity of the Blessed Virgin Mary again started teaching in the school. In 1897 high school grades were added to the school, and it was the first Catholic high school in Iowa to be accredited by the State University of Iowa. In 1911 an addition was built onto the school, which contained an auditorium and cafeteria. A convent was also built to house the sisters. It was replaced by the current building, now a part of the Newman Center, in 1926. The new convent was built for $33,000. St. Mary's and St. Patrick's high schools were consolidated in 1958 when Regina High School was opened. The St. Mary's School building started to deteriorate, and it was closed in 1968. The school itself consolidated with the school at St. Patrick's and used its building. The sisters remained in the St. Mary's Convent. In 1975 the St. Mary's school buildings and convent were sold to the diocese for use by the Newman Center. In the early 1990s, an addition was made to Regina High School and the elementary and junior high school grades were moved from St. Patrick's. The school building had been listed on the National Register of Historic Places as St. Mary's High School in 1977. It was removed in 1997 after the buildings had been torn down. Pipe organ The Moline pipe organ (1883) is located in a gallery-level case at the back of the church. It features a traditional style console with a keyboard cover that can be lifted to become the music rack and an attached keydesk en fen√™tre. It is equipped with three manuals, 31 stops, 30 ranks, slider chests, mechanical key action, and mechanical stop action. The drawknobs are arraigned in horizontal rows on terraced/stepped jambs. The balanced swell shoes/pedals are not in standard AGO position. The combination action is a fixed mechanical system and there is a flat straight pedalboard. The historic pipe organ was restored in 2015.

Education, career Pavel Djidjov was born to a Latin rite Catholic family in Plovdiv. He was baptized on 2 August and given the name Joseph. He took the name Pavel (Paul) when he entered the Assumptionist novitiate in Nozeroy, France, in October 1938. To achieve his childhood ambition of attaining priesthood, he entered the Assumptionist-sponsored St. Augustine College in Plovdiv, where he was considered a good student, especially in mathematics. After his novitiate, he went on to study theology in Lormoy, France, near Paris, during World War II. For health reasons he returned to Bulgaria in 1942 to complete his theological studies and was ordained on 26 January 1945. He later continued his studies in economics and social sciences. His first assignment was as a teacher at the Assumptionist high school in Varna, where he was closely watched by the secret police. Not long thereafter he was named to be the treasurer at St. Augustine College in Plovdiv and served there until the institution was closed by the Communists in 1948. He was particularly appreciated by students and others for his piety, sense of humor, deep faith, ecumenical spirit, and bravery before the Communist regime. Often he risked personal safety by defending the rights of the Church in public and visiting political prisoners. Arrest and trial As a Soviet satellite, Bulgaria suffered from the wave of anti-Church legislation that swept the bloc in the years after World War II (e.g. the arrest of Archbishop Aloysius Stepinac in Yugoslavia in 1946, of Cardinal J√≥zsef Mindszenty in Hungary in 1948, of Archbishop Josef Beran in Czechoslovakia in 1950, and of Cardinal Stefan Wyszy≈Ñski in Poland in 1953). Already as a student in 1945, Djidjov had engaged in polemics with Communist students and professors and was placed on a blacklist. A month before his arrest in July 1952, he wrote to the Assumptionist procurator in Rome, Fr. R√©mi Kokel, concerning a colleague they hadn't heard from in a long time: \\"We are distressed, having heard nothing of Fr. Josaphat (Chichkov) for six months now. There will be three trials within a week against Catholic priests. The first one is already over: death penalty for a diocesan priest of the Latin rite. Tomorrow it will be the trial of a diocesan priest of the Slavonic rite, in Sofia; the day after tomorrow, that of a Capuchin. And these will not be the last ones, surely. May God‚Äôs will be done.\\" One month later he, too, was imprisoned. Besides Djidjov, two other Assumptionist brothers were imprisoned: Fr. Joseph Chichkov and Fr. Kamen Vitchev. The latter followed the Byzantine Rite, whereas the others followed the Latin Rite‚Äîin their martyrdom, they united the two main Catholic rites, a point reiterated by Pope John Paul II in 2002. All three had been schooled in Belgium and France, and were accused of spying for the French government. After what international organizations universally considered a show trial, which began on 29 September 1952, and ended with a guilty verdict and a death sentence on 3 October, the three, together with the Passionist bishop Eugene Bossilkov, were shot to death in prison, without public notice, at 11:30 PM, on 11 November 1952. Their bodies were buried in a communal grave and have not been recovered. Fr. Pavel Djidjov was declared a martyr for the faith and beatified by Pope John Paul II in Plovdiv on 26 May 2002. The pope delivered a homily on the occasion, during his 2002 visit to Bulgaria. Later, he commented that the Eucharistic celebration during which he beatified Djidjov, Vitchev, and Chichkov was \\"the high point of my brief but intense visit in Bulgaria.\\" On 28 July 2010 the Bulgarian parliament passed a law officially rehabilitating all of those who had been condemned by the People's Republic of Bulgaria in 1952, including Fr. Djidjov. References *Guissard, Lucien. The Assumptionists: From Past to Present, Bayard Publications, 2002 (). *.

Plot  After retirement from Indian Railways, as station master, Raghavan Nair (Thilakan) is back at his home. His long cherished dream to spend his retired life with his family consisting of his wife (Kaviyoor Ponnamma), three sons and two daughters gets a blow after seeing his two sons brawling with each other over their political differences as well as the debilitating effect this has on the family. Prabhakaran (Sreenivasan), the elder one is a staunch leftist, and an active worker of the Revolutionary Democratic Party (RDP), which has just lost the Kerala state Assembly elections and relinquished office. Prakashan (Jayaram), popularly known as KRP, his younger brother is involved with the Indian National Secular Party (INSP), which has now come to power. Though they are both educated, neither has any plans to earn a living on their own and are fully immersed in petty politics, sponging off their parents for their needs. Raghavan Nair becomes deeply worried about their future, and tries to advise his sons, but his admonitions fall on deaf ears. Anandan (Mala Aravindan), his son-in-law is a police sub-inspector, but is now on suspension. When RDP was in power, he had arrested and beaten up several of the opposition party workers on instruction from the ruling party officials. Now that the previous opposition is in power, they exact their revenge, first by transferring him repeatedly to stations as far from civilisation as is possible, and then by suspending him. As part of his retired life, Raghavan Nair decides to focus his attention on his agricultural activities and meets the new young agricultural officer Udayabhanu (Siddique) and, with his wife's approval, wants their younger daughter Latika to marry him, but his elder sons oppose it for flimsy and petty reasons. Prakashan, whose party is in power, pulls strings and get him transferred immediately to a remote location in order to prevent the marriage, but Nair gets them married at the registrar's office. In the meantime, Anandan and his wife Latha, Raghavan Nair's eldest daughter, demand partition of the property and their share, which Raghavan Nair objects to. The last straw is when their mother falls ill and is hospitalised for a day or so, and none of her children, especially the two older sons, show up at the hospital. Raghavan Nair, when he sees all of them milling around his house on returning from the hospital, loses his temper. He throws out all his children and orders them never to enter his house again. But to his surprise, he finds both Prakashan and Prabhakaran at the gate, fully repented. He calls them in and they begin a new life. Some time later we see Prabhakaran who has started working going to court as a lawyer and Prakashan going for a job interview as part of his efforts to change and gain employment. At the same time, it is also seen that Prasanthan, the school-going youngest son of Raghavan Nair, has decided to form a student political organisation to conduct a protest at his school. But, both his brothers having learnt their lesson the hard way scold him and destroy the flag and banners he was busy making. It is here the film ends with the message clear.

The regiment consisted of 561 men, many mounted on their own farm horses.

On October 22, the Confederates arrived at the edge of Mockbee Farm where federal forces were waiting. The Confederates scattered the militia, many of whom retreated towards Westport (present-day Kansas City).

Ferrugia received a Bachelors in Journalism from the University of Missouri School of Journalism in 1975. Personal John Ferrugia has been married to his wife Mona since 1975. They have two children and live in Denver, Colorado. Professional career After graduating from the University of Missouri School of Journalism in 1975, Ferrugia worked as a reporter/photojournalist at WTVT-TV in Tampa, Florida where he was a member of a team (including producer Ray Blush and photojournalist-editor Jewell McGee) reporting and filming half- hour programs highlighting issues of public importance. He was later briefly the city hall reporter. In 1977, Ferrugia moved to KCMO-TV in Kansas City, Missouri where he established himself as a top investigative and political reporter. He received a Peabody Award in 1977 at age 26 for tracking flood damaged cars after a major flood in the Kansas City metro area. The results of his investigation were aired nationally on the CBS Evening News. He produced several other stories that aired on the \\"CBS Morning News\\". In 1980, he caught the eye of executives at CBS News, including Chicago bureau chief Jack Smith, and producer Joe Peyronnin during his coverage of the National Political Conventions. In 1980, Ferrugia was hired by CBS News Washington Bureau Chief Ed Fouhy. He was assigned to cover important domestic and international stories including the inauguration of President Ronald Reagan; the assassination attempt of Reagan in March 1981 and subsequent investigation; the kidnapping of U.S. General James L. Dozier in Italy by the Red Brigades terrorist group; and the civil war in Lebanon. In 1982, Ferrugia was assigned to the White House (replacing veteran correspondent Nelson Benton) working with correspondents Lesley Stahl, and Bill Plante. In addition to his reporting for the \\"CBS Morning News\\" and the daily \\"syndicated\\" stories from the White House for CBS affiliates, Ferrugia filed reports for CBS Radio and produced a nationally aired \\"First Line Report\\" from the White House each week.

He also produced a number of stories focused on educating the public about HIV and AIDS. Three years later he joined KMGH-TV where he initially anchored the midday news with co-anchor Anne Trujillo and continued to investigate issues of public policy. As the station's only investigative reporter, he initially worked alone. By 2002 KMGH-TV had hired investigative producer Jeff Harris and News Director Byron Grandy who, with Ferrugia, began to build the station's investigative reporting profile. The investigative team added producer Kurt Silver (now an FBI special agent) and producer Tom Burke. Jason Foster was the team's Photojournalist/Editor. With Ferrugia as lead reporter, the team's investigation into sexual assaults of female cadets at the U.S. Air Force Academy in 2003 and 2004 prompted Congressional hearings; a complete change in leadership at one of the world's most prestigious military institutions; and new initiatives for protecting and caring for sexual assault victims in the military. The investigation won 4 major national journalism awards including the Alfred I. duPont‚ÄìColumbia University Award, Peabody and the Investigative Reporters and Editors Award (IRE).

The investigative reports prompted Colorado's governor to appoint a child welfare committee that recommended sweeping changes in the state system including a new case worker academy where all county caseworkers are now trained to make sure all are accountable for their actions. The state also established the State Office of the Child Protection Ombudsman as an independent third party to investigate complaints. Ferrugia's two-year investigation into deaths at the Colorado Mental Health Institute at Pueblo in 2010 prompted an outside third-party review of the forensic unit where patients died, the resignation of the hospital's director, and a criminal grand jury investigation. He and the team (Producers Arthur Kane and Tom Burke, and photojournalist Jason Foster) earned a 2011 national Edward R. Murrow Award for the series. The grand jury found the staff responsible for the death of a patient who was restrained face-down and suffocated. As a result of the death brought to light by the investigation, the Director of the Colorado Department of Human Services has banned the used of prone (face down) restraint in all CDHS funded facilities in Colorado and all contractors that receive public funding. The reports caused the resignation of the hospital's long time director; prompted major changes in state policies for dealing with the mentally ill in Colorado; and prompted the state legislature to add funding for 50 additional staff at the state's largest mental health facility. In early 2016 Ferrugia moved to Rocky Mountain PBS in Denver to head an investigative team as anchor and managing editor. In 2019, an RMPBS \\"Insight with John Ferrugia\\" investigation into unlimited access to firearms by mentally ill persons entitled ‚ÄúImminent Danger‚Äù was honored with the Alfred I. duPont-Columbia University Awardfor public service journalism. Elements of the investigation were aired by the PBS Newshour and shown in a Colorado legislative hearing to explain why a law allowing temporary removal of firearms from the mentally ill is necessary. A so-called \\"red flag\\" bill was signed into Colorado law in 2019. The RMPBS team has also been honored with a national Gracie Award, a national Emmy nomination, and multiple regional Emmy awards. While his principal job is investigative reporting, Ferrugia has been involved in reporting major national stories for the past three decades, including the Columbine school killings and subsequent investigation; reporting from the courtroom of the Oklahoma City bombing trials; reporting from the floor of both the Democratic National Convention (DNC) and the Republican National Convention (RNC); producing and reporting a series on Homeland Security after the 2001 September 11 attacks including his first person reports of humanitarian aide, flying over Afghanistan following the U.S. invasion; and investigating the 2012 Aurora, Colorado shooting at a local theater.

The crater was later buried by sediments, of which it has been partly recovered. The structure was first discovered as a possible (suspected) impact crater in 2000 by geologist Fridtjof Riis. The Research Council of Norway has funded scientific research of the crater. In 2009, scientists from the University of Oslo considered it proven that the crater was formed by meteorite impact, according to Professor Henning Dypvik from the Institute for Geological Sciences at the University of Oslo. Details The sediments and fossils at Ritland have been studied by geologists since the 1950s. The depth of the circular structure is about , with a diameter of about . Research has focused on trying to find evidence that the crater resulted from a meteoric impact. In 2008 it was announced that microscopic evidence was found, and that the structure is an impact crater. The crater dates from before mid Cambrian, as fossils from mid Cambrian are found in sediments that have accumulated in the crater. The evidence for the structure being an impact crater stems from identification of shocked quartz particles, which only form under the very high pressures (5-10 GPa) present during a meteoric impact. The sediments in the crater are described as landslides in the bottom of the crater, followed by shale sediments deposited during a period when the sea had invaded the area. On top of the clay sediments are coarser sediments. During the Caledonian orogeny the crater was buried under a several kilometre thick mountain chain. The overlaying mountains were later eroded, and the crater was again exposed.

Early life  Marie-Louise was born into a free black family; her father was the owner of a hotel, Hotel de la Couronne, Cap-Ha√Øtien. She married Henri Christophe in Cap- Ha√Øtien in 1793, having had a relationship with him from the year prior. They had four children: Fran√ßois Ferdinand (born 1794), Fran√ßoise-Am√©thyste (d. 1831), Ath√©na√Øs (d. 1838) and Victor-Henri. At her spouse's new position in 1798, she moved to the Sans-Souci Palace. During the French invasion, she and her children lived underground until 1803.  Queen  In 1811, Marie-Louise was given the title of queen upon the creation of the Kingdom of Haiti. Her new status gave her ceremonial tasks to perform, ladies-in-waiting, a secretary and her own court. She took her position seriously, and stated that the title \\"given to her by the nation\\" also gave her responsibilities and duties to perform. She served as the hostess of the ceremonial royal court life performed at the Sans-Souci Palace. She did not involve herself in the affairs of state. She was given the position of Regent should her son succeed her spouse while still being a minor.Louis Marceau, Marie - Louise d'Haiti, Publi√© √† Buenos Aires, Se, 1953, pages 2 √† 18. However, as her son became of age before the death of his father,but this was never to materialize. After the death of her spouse in 1820, she remained with her daughters at the palace until they were escorted from it by the followers of her spouse together with his corpse; after their departure, the palace was attacked and plundered. Marie-Louise and her daughters were given the property Lambert outside Cap. She was visited by president Jean Pierre Boyer, who offered her his protection; he denied the spurs of gold she gave him, stating that he was the leader of poor people. They were allowed to settle in Port-au-Prince. Marie- Louise was described as calm and resigned, but her daughters, especially Athenais, were described as vengeful.  Exile  The Queen was in exile for 30 years. In August 1821, the former queen left Haiti with her daughters under the protection of the British admiral Sir Home Popham, and travelled to London. There were rumours that she was searching for the money, three million, deposited by her spouse in Europe. Whatever the case, she did live the rest of her life without economic difficulties. Marie Louise lived the rest of her life discreetly with her daughters in Pisa in Italy, where they were somewhat bothered by fortune hunters and throne claimers who wanted their fortune. They made a grand visit to Rome in 1828. Shortly before her death, she wrote to Haiti for permission to return. She never did, however, before she died in Italy.

He co- created, produced and wrote several episodes for the one-season ABC series Probe. Career Wagner was a military brat. He was born in Ohio, but grew up on Air Force bases in New York, Illinois, Japan, Germany, Nebraska and Texas. He graduated in 1965 from Randolph High School at Randolph Air Force Base, Texas. He attended the University of Missouri and moved to California, holding various jobs in Los Angeles, while writing scripts and selling some of his paintings. In 1975 he sold his first television script to CBS for the series The Blue Knight, a crime drama based on the Joseph Wambaugh novel of the same name. He quickly became an established television writer, scripting episodes of Jigsaw John, The Six Million Dollar Man, Kojak, Man from Atlantis, Starsky & Hutch and The Rockford Files, among others. In 1982 a script he wrote for the TV crime drama series Hill Street Blues, \\"The World According to Freedom,\\" was aired and he was quickly hired as a regular staff writer for the series. His story introduced the character \\"Captain Freedom,\\" a street vigilante dressed absurdly as a superhero. His follow-up episode, \\"Freedom's Last Stand,\\" won him the 1982 Emmy Award as co-writer for Outstanding Writing in a Drama Series.\\"Total Television\\" (1996) Alex McNeil, Penguin Books, p.1084. In fact, three of the scripts he co-wrote for that season were nominated in the same category. Wagner went on to co-write 35 episodes of Hill Street Blues for the next two years, and began a long association with Steven Bochco and several of his projects. Wagner was asked by ABC in 1987 to help develop a new science fiction series, Probe, a light-hearted series about a scientific crime fighter named Austin James. Isaac Asimov, the renowned science fiction writer, had created the basic idea of a young man who solved mysteries using scientific concepts, somewhat in the vein of Tom Swift or Rick Brant. Wagner wrote the two-hour pilot TV movie, \\"Computer Logic,\\" and became Executive Producer for the series, which lasted one season. Parker Stevenson, who played the lead character, stated in a later interview that he patterned his character after Wagner's mannerisms and physical behavior.\\"Science Fiction Television Series\\" (1996) Mark Phillips & Frank Garcia, McFarland & Co., Inc. The series ran on Thursday nights in the Spring of 1988 during the same time slot as NBC's The Cosby Show, and with that competition could not attract a sufficient audience to get renewed for the following season. The following TV season, Wagner wrote three scripts for the Gene Roddenberry series Star Trek: The Next Generation, and served briefly as Executive Producer for the series. He worked with Steven Bochco on Bochco's Hooperman, starring John Ritter. Wagner helped develop and write the Bochco animated series Capitol Critters, he also wrote and served as supervising producer for the NBC series Mann & Machine in 1992. In 1992, Wagner died from brain cancer in Agoura Hills, California.

Biography  P√°l Sz√©csi was born on 19 March 1944 in Budapest. His father Ferenc Sz√©csi, a professor of linguistics, was shot in the last months of World War II. His mother gave one-year-old Sz√©csi and his two siblings to foster parents, and during the Revolution of 1956, fled the country for the United States through Austria. She traveled with Sz√©csi's older sister until the train station of Vienna, but she left her there, eventually leaving Kati and P√°l in Hungary. These events later resulted in serious psychological illness and nerve problems for Sz√©csi as he grew up. The orphaned boy was taken into state care, where he remained until age 16. After leaving, he worked as a laborer at several places, until at a workplace meeting, his engaging style and motion were taken notice of by the assembled members. Inspired by this, Sz√©csi became a model and quickly became quite successful. At New Year's Eve, 1965 he took part in a fashion show organized in Hotel Gell√©rt. After the event, he went into the hotel bar and sang three songs. Soon afterward, through the efforts of one of the patrons of the bar, Sz√©csi was introduced to J√∫lia Benk who would become his singing teacher and under whose tutelage Sz√©csi would begin his professional career. In consulting Benk, L√°szl√≥ B√°nki (a talent-scout working at the National Television in search of young talent for the upcoming T√°ncdalfesztiv√°l) was recommended Benk's favorite student, Sz√©csi. Invited to perform at the festival, Sz√©csi sang Csak egy t√°nc volt at the show and this performance lifted him into immediate popularity, becoming a household name in the country. His success was further established through his creation of covers for Italian pop songs like Sergio Endrigo's L' arca di Noe which became K√≥sza sz√©l. Trying to gain international fame, Sz√©csi also produced an album released in Germany under the name Paul Moro, but it was unsuccessful. Sz√©csi's growing domestic popularity was increasingly harder to bear for the mentally fragile singer, and this coupled with severe alcoholism and several failures in private life - including the suicide of one of his loves, actress Edit Domj√°n - led to Sz√©csi becoming more and more closed off from the outer world. He attempted suicide eight times, but always asked for help at the last minute. His ninth attempt on 30 April 1974, was successful. Sz√©csi was 30 years old. He was buried in the Farkasr√©ti Cemetery in Budapest. His burial turned into a hysterical scandal with hundreds of fans, maddened by the pain of loss, trying to rush to his catafalque.  Legacy  His death shocked the masses of fans, creating legends, myths, and conspiracy theories immediately after his death. The play Sz√©csi P√°l szerelmei was written to his memory, describing his 6 love, framed by 6 suicide attempts, featuring 17 of his songs. The Sz√©csi P√°l award, founded by his relatives is handed out every year starting from 2007.

Dealers specialise in antiques, jewellery, watches and collectables. The centre is home to nearly 100 dealers on 2 levels. History The Grays dealers are situated in a grade-two listed building on Davies Street designed by the Edwardian architect Reginald Bloomsfield. The building was originally commissioned by water closet manufacturers, John Bolding and Son. In 1977 it was restored by Bennie Gray, the founder of Grays from a near-derelict site to the former glories of the water closet showroom. The Mews and the River Tyburn The basement river in Grays Antique Centre The Mews section is now closed and many of the dealers from that part of the building now trade from the sister company Alfies Antique Market located in Marylebone. The Mews section of Grays was built circa 1900 and was also taken over by Bolding in 1931. The basement of the Mews had been under six feet of water for many years, and on closer inspection it was found that a spring arose from one end of the building. Now renovated, the shop claims that the water flowing through a conduit in its basement is the River Tyburn, which rises in Hampstead and flows underground towards the River Thames. The Londonist website describes this suggestion as \\"fanciful\\", as the modern Tyburn is a sewer.

Etymology and origins The name comes from the Sanskrit ‡§™‡§µ‡§® pavan, \\"wind\\", ‡§Æ‡•Å‡§ï‡•ç‡§§ mukta, \\"free\\" and ‡§Ü‡§∏‡§® asana, \\"posture\\" or \\"seat\\". The pose is unknown in medieval hatha yoga, appearing in the 20th century, for example as one of the set poses in the basic sequence of Bikram Yoga. Description This asana is practiced in three stages: # In the first stage, the yogi lies on their back stretching their legs straight. The yogi bends their right knee and holds it with their hands, pressing it towards their abdomen. Breathing out, the yogi lifts up their head and touches their knee with their chin. Breathing in, the yogi stretches their legs straight. # In the second stage, the yogi presses their abdomen with their left leg. # In the third stage, the yogi presses their abdomen with both legs, placing their chin between their knees. From this position, the yogi swings their body back and forth 5 to 10 times, and then swings their body left to right and right to left 5 to 10 times. The three stages above form one round. Three or four rounds should be practiced. Variations Some sources differentiate between double leg, Dvi Pada Pavanamuktasana (dvi = \\"two\\", pada = \\"leg\\"), and single leg, Eka Pada Pavanamuktasana (eka = \\"one\\", pada = \\"leg\\") forms.

It is native to southern North America and can grow up to 100 cm tall. The leaves are lanceolate or oval-lanceolate. The plant is perennial and self-fertile. Its young lemon scented leaves are used in herbal teas and the leaves are also often used in flavoring foods. This plant can thrive in arid or semi-arid regions, but it is necessary for the seed to pass a cold and humid season which break dormancy in order to produce germination. For a proper development it requires alkaline or neutral, aerated and light soil, otherwise the excessive humidity, compactness and damping will putrify the root system. This species requires direct sunlight or partial shade, but doesn't do well in interior corners or under taller plants; these situations will make the plant tend to yellowing and loss of leaves, absence of flowering and even death. Sunny days and cooler nights will produce more intense aroma in the leaves. It can produce flowers when it reaches 1 month old, but requires at least 3 days of natural or artificial watering for two weeks. Infusion of Agastache mexicana areal parts has been used for jaundice therapy in the Mexican ethnomedicine. Detail of flower References *Harold Lint and Carl Epling (1945).

Having previously spent his entire senior career at Randers FC, Fenger holds the record for most first team appearances in the history of said club. Club career =Early life= Mads Fenger grew up in Aarhus, Jutland and started his football career at local club IK Skovbakken. In 2007, he joined Randers FC youth academy but soon started to play senior football with their reserve team Randers Freja. =Randers FC= Fenger made his competitive debut for Randers in the 2008‚Äì09 season, making three appearances. During the 2009‚Äì10 season, Fenger formed a strong central-defence with Anders Egholm as part of a Randers-team that miraculously avoided relegation after being 13 points under the relegation- line half way through the season. Fenger and Randers ultimately ended up 10th and avoided relegation, in a season that has since been described as the most dramatic in the history of the club. The upcoming 2010‚Äì11 season, Fenger played 16 league games as Randers had a hard time following up on their results from the previous season. Ultimately the club finished 11th, thus facing relegation to the Danish 1st Division. Staying with the club despite of the relegation, Fenger, once again, played a vital part in a team that secured a second place in the Danish 1st Division and thereby earned a promotion to the Danish Superliga in the 2011‚Äì12 season. Fenger played a total of 25 league games throughout the campaign. In the 2012‚Äì13 season, Fenger was a key player in the central defence, playing a total of 32 league games. The season ended with Randers securing a third place ‚Äì the best league result in the history of the club. Fenger also helped the club to reach the final of the Danish Cup, where the team lost 0-1 to Esbjerg FB. Following several strong seasons, Fenger was promoted to vice-captain of Randers during the 2014‚Äì15 season, marking his growing influence in the squad. Fenger played a total of 32 out of 33 league games, as Randers finished 4th in the league. On August 16, 2015 in a match against OB, Fenger made his 200th appearance the club, becoming only the second player in the club's history to reach this milestone. In March 2016, Fenger was promoted to captain at Randers. =Hammarby IF= On 17 February 2017, Fenger agreed to join the Swedish Allsvenskan club Hammarby IF on a pre-contract. His three year-deal came to effect on 15 July the same year. Fenger made his competitive debut for the side on 17 July, playing the whole game in 3‚Äì0 loss against Elfsborg. He quickly established himself as an important member in manager Jakob Michelsen's side, usually pairing up with compatriot Bj√∏rn Paulsen in the central defence. After making 10 appearances for Hammarby, Fenger was ruled out for the remainder of the season following a serious groin injury, which he attracted in a 2‚Äì1 win against IFK G√∂teborg on 20 September. Fenger went under the knife in October, with an expected return in early 2018. On 7 October 2018, Fenger scored his first goal for Hammarby, from a spectacular free kick, in a 4‚Äì2 away win against Brommapojkarna. After an impressive 2019 season, where Fenger played a key part as Hammarby finished 3rd in the league, he signed a new four-year contract with Hammarby lasting until the end of 2023.

Synopsis In his reappraisal of the famed president, DiLorenzo is highly critical of Lincoln. Within the book he argues that states within the union had the right at the time of the American Civil War to secede and that the more centralized government that emerged after the war was incompatible with democracy. DiLorenzo also claims that most scholars of the Civil War are biased in their approach to the history because, as DiLorenzo reminds the reader, \\"in war the victors get to write the history\\". Dilorenzo also argues that Lincoln was opposed to racial equality, and that many abolitionists, including Lysander Spooner, bitterly hated him.https://mises.org/story/607 Criticisms Several reviewers of the book have concluded that while there is room for discrepancy, the overall interpretation of President Lincoln by other historians has sided towards truth. One such critic is Justin Ewers, a senior editor at U.S. News & World Report, who reviewing the book for The Washington Post noted: \\"Of course, Lincoln's presidency had its dark side. Most infamously, the Great Emancipator suspended habeas corpus in 1861‚Äì62, allowing the indefinite detention of citizens without trial. Still, DiLorenzo's work is more of a diatribe against a mostly unnamed group of Lincoln scholars than a real historical analysis.\\" https://www.washingtonpost.com/wp- dyn/content/article/2007/01/12/AR2007011200119_2.html Other reviewers, like Publishers Weekly, while calling the book a \\"laughable screed,\\" suggest that DiLorenzo's main target are \\"scholars who dominate American universities (most notably Eric Foner)\\".http://www.publishersweekly.com/article/CA6359374.html?q=Lincoln+Unmasked Notes Category:2006 non-fiction books Category:Biographies of Abraham Lincoln Category:American biographies ","title":"Lincoln Unmasked"},{"id":"23144116","text":"Ivan Vladimirovich Pazyomov (; born 23 July 1973) is a former Russian professional footballer.

Citizenship of Monaco is based primarily on the principle of jus sanguinis. In other words, citizenship is conferred primarily by birth to a Mon√©gasque parent, irrespective of place of birth. Acquisition for Mon√©gasque citizenship =By descent= Children who at the time of birth had a Mon√©gasque father or mother that was born Mon√©gasque (regardless of the place of birth) are eligible for Mon√©gasque citizenship. In addition, children born to a mother of whom one of the ancestors in the same line was born Mon√©gasque are eligible for Mon√©gasque citizenship. If the child is born out of wedlock, then he/she will only qualify for Mon√©gasque citizenship once recognised/legitimised by the marriage of his/her parents. =By birth= Any person who is born in Monaco to unknown parents is Mon√©gasque at birth. =By marriage= A foreign woman can apply for Mon√©gasque citizenship through a right of option after ten years of marriage on condition that the spouses live together. In the case of the husband's death, she has to provide evidence that her widowhood was not followed by remarriage. =By declaration= After the age of 18, a person who was born in Monaco of a parent who was either also born Mon√©gasque or who had ancestors of the same branch born Mon√©gasque but who has since renounced Mon√©gasque citizenship can make a declaration before a Registrar provided that he lived in the Principality and proves that he has had his legal domicile or habitual residence there during his childhood. In addition, those who were born before July 11, 1975, before the acquisition of Mon√©gasque nationality by his father can also make a declaration without conditions concerning the place of birth or habitual residence or legal domicile. =By naturalisation= Those seeking to become Mon√©gasque citizens via naturalisation are required to fulfill the following criteria and send their request on stamped paper addressed directly to the Prince: * renounce any foreign nationality * no longer be required to perform national service abroad * has resided in Monaco for a minimum of 10 continuous years since the age of 18 at the time of making the application (the Prince is entitled to waive this requirement if he considers the applicant to be \\"worthy of this favour\\") Mon√©gasque nationality is granted automatically to children who are under 18 when their father or mother surviving her husband (in the event of the death of the latter) obtains naturalization. Loss of citizenship A Mon√©gasque automatically forfeits his/her citizenship if he/she: * acquires a foreign nationality * performs foreign military service without the prior authorisation of the government of Monaco * is deemed to have \\"harmed the internal or external security\\" of Monaco A Mon√©gasque will retain their nationality upon adoption by a foreigner, if the adoptor's country doesn't automatically grant the adoptee nationality. A Mon√©gasque citizen may voluntarily renounce his citizenship. Former Mon√©gasque citizens may restore their former citizenship if their request on stamped paper directly to the Prince is successful. Dual citizenship The voluntary acquisition of a foreign nationality is subject to the renunciation of Mon√©gasque nationality. The naturalization of a person as a Mon√©gasque is subject to that person's renunciation of the foreign nationality or nationalities. Dual Mon√©gasque and foreign nationalities remain possible. However, in certain cases, special provisions may exist. For example, after 10 years of marriage to a Mon√©gasque person, an applicant may obtain Mon√©gasque nationality. In this case, the applicant is required to retain his or her original nationality. It is not possible for an applicant who has acquired Mon√©gasque nationality in this way to pass it on to his or her children. However, if the applicant is a woman, not being herself born with Mon√©gasque nationality, but having an ascendant born Mon√©gasque, transmission to the children is automatic. Visa requirements for Mon√©gasque citizens Visa requirements for Mon√©gasque citizens In 2016, Monaco citizens had visa-free or visa on arrival access to 160 countries and territories, ranking the Mon√©gasque passport 16th. Any Mon√©gasque citizen may live in France without visa.https://www.service- public.fr/particuliers/vosdroits/F16162 See also *Mon√©gasque identity card References Category:Monegasque law M Category:Monaco stubs ","title":"Mon√©gasque nationality law"},{"id":"23144173","text":"Friends of Mine is an album by American folk musician Ramblin' Jack Elliott, released in 1998.

On 29 November 1943, it was presented to Marshal Joseph Stalin by British Prime Minister Winston Churchill at a ceremony during the Tehran Conference, in the presence of President Franklin D. Roosevelt and an honour guard.  Description  The sword is a double-edged, two-handed longsword, approximately four feet long, with a solid-silver crossguard. The acid-etched inscription in Russian and English reads: > –ì–†–ê–ñ–î–ê–ù–ê–ú –°–¢–ê–õ–ò–ù–ì–†–ê–î–ê ‚Ä¢ –ö–†–ï–ü–ö–ò–ú –ö–ê–ö –°–¢–ê–õ–¨ ‚Ä¢ –û–¢ –ö–û–†–û–õ–Ø –ì–ï–û–†–ì–ê VI ‚Ä¢ –í –ó–ù–ê–ö > –ì–õ–£–ë–û–ö–û–ì–û –í–û–°–•–ò–©–ï–ù–ò–Ø –ë–†–ò–¢–ê–ù–°–ö–û–ì–û –ù–ê–†–û–î–ê > TO THE STEEL-HEARTED CITIZENS OF STALINGRAD ‚Ä¢ THE GIFT OF KING GEORGE VI ‚Ä¢ > IN TOKEN OF THE HOMAGE OF THE BRITISH PEOPLE The hand grip is bound in 18 carat gold wire and has a pommel of rock crystal with a gold rose of England. Each end of the crossguard is fashioned in the likeness of the head of a leopard and finished with parcel gilt.Olof Janson, The Sword of Stalingrad Page, with original pictures & information courtesy of Robert Wilkinson Latham, son of John Wilkinson Latham of the Wilkinson Sword Co. The double-edged blade is lenticular in cross section and hand-forged out of the finest Sheffield steel. The scabbard was made from Persian lamb skin dyed crimson, although some sources suggest it was of Morocco leather.Ed Levin, The Sword of Stalingrad Description, Russianswords.com. It is decorated with the Royal arms, the Crown and Cypher in silver gilt with five silver mounts and three rubies mounted on golden stars. In its time it was celebrated as one of the last masterpieces in swordmaking craftsmanship from the modern age.\\"Sword of Stalingrad...Perfection in its Field\\", Sklar advertisement, July 1944, in The Journal of Bone and Joint Surgery, Vol. XXVI, No. 3, Boston MA. p. 11.  Manufacture  The original design was by R. M. Y. Gleadowe, a University of Oxford fine arts don, and approved by the King. A commission of nine expert craftsmen from Goldsmiths' Hall supervised the execution of the works. The Russian wording was cleared by Sir Ellis Hovell Minns, a Slavonic iconographer and the President of Pembroke College, Cambridge.Elizabeth Hill, \\"Obituary: Sir Ellis Hovell Minns (1874-1953),\\" The Slavonic and East European Review, 1953, pp. 236-238. The Wilkinson Sword Company was the fabricator, with the principal craftsmen being swordsmiths Tom Beasley and Sid Rouse, the calligrapher M. C. Oliver and silversmith Corp. Leslie G. Durbin from the Royal Air Force. The steel for the blade came from Sanderson Brothers and Newbould of Sheffield. The project took about three months to complete. Tom Beasley, one of the Wilkinson Sword craftsmen, left his hospital bed to make this sword. Upon its completion, he returned to hospital. Tom died in 1950, as his grave surround states. He is buried in Acton Cemetery, London, and his overgrown grave has been found and restored.  Presentation  The presentation of the Sword of Stalingrad at the Tehran Conference The official presentation was made while the Big Three wartime leaders were meeting in the Soviet embassy at the November 1943 Tehran Conference, where the final plans for Operation Overlord were being settled.Paul D. Mayle (1987), Eureka Summit: agreement in principle and the Big Three at Tehran, 1943, University of Delaware Press, pp. 89-90 . After a three-hour delay, the principals and their delegations gathered in the large conference room of the embassy with a British and Soviet honour guard lining either side of the hall. Winston Churchill entered wearing his blue Royal Air Force air commodore's uniform, and a Soviet military band played \\"God Save the King\\" and \\"The Internationale\\". Churchill took the sword from a British lieutenant and turning to Joseph Stalin declared, \\"I am commanded to present this sword of honour as a token of homage of the British people\\". Stalin kissed the scabbard and quietly thanked the British. He then offered the sword for inspection to the seated Franklin Roosevelt, who drew the blade and held it aloft, saying, \\"Truly they had hearts of steel\\". (In Russian, Stalin's name approximates to \\"man of steel\\"). Marshal Kliment Voroshilov drops the Sword of Stalingrad The sword was replaced in its scabbard by either Churchill or Stalin. At the end of the ceremony, Stalin unexpectedly handed it off to one of his oldest and most loyal comrades, Marshal Kliment Voroshilov. He seemed to have been taken by surprise and took it the wrong way up so that the sword slipped out and fell.Gladwyn Jebb's eyewitness account recorded in the 16 December 1943 diary entry of Harold Nicolson (1967), The War Years, 1939-1945, Vol. II of Diaries and Letters, Atheneum, New York, p. 334. Observers differ on whether it struck his foot, clattered onto the floor, or was caught in time to be returned to its scabbard with a deft move.Mayle, p. 90. In literature The sword figures eponymously in Evelyn Waugh's Sword of Honour trilogy, in which Waugh contrasts the sword, symbol for him of the betrayal of eastern Europe to the atheist Stalin, with the sword of honour of the crusading ancestor of the central character of the trilogy, Guy Crouchback.  Disposition  Before its presentation, the sword was exhibited around the United Kingdom like a religious icon, including at Westminster Abbey, which formed a pivotal scene in Evelyn Waugh's wartime trilogy Sword of Honour.Alan Sinfield (1983), Society and Literature, 1945-1970, Taylor & Francis, London, p. 23 .

In 2010, he won the Second Prize at the 16th International Queen Elisabeth Piano Competition, and a few months later was awarded Fourth Prize at the XVI Fryderyk Chopin International Piano Competition. Whether he refused his prize and the attendant monetary award is a matter of ongoing speculation fueled by the fact that he did not participate in the Prize Winner's concerts \\"for reasons outside the competition\\". The Chopin Competition jury had decided at the time of the final round to suddenly change the rules of judging by discarding the point system, where Bozhanov was consistently in 2nd place through the 3rd round, in favor of a ranking system for the final (concerto) round and competition. The latest published jury voting details on the final round provides proof of the large variation in judgment of Bozhanov's performances, with his being ranked first or second place by some and 9th or 10th place by others.

It works as a virtual station where sound radio-like productions are presented in a Web 2.0 site, created by the University students themselves, who have the opportunity to acquire and develop new knowledge on information technology as well as digital radio and hypermedial content management. It was founded on April 2000, under the name of Radio Altair, Created by student Luz Dary Gil Cort√©s under the advice of Professor Lucia Restrepo Cuartas. It is a Net radio pioneer project in Latin America, and a very strong predecessor on the free culture. In the year 2004, Altair was awarded with the University Journalism Award in the best digital feature category due to its proposals on hypermedia field. Some of the programs that have been produced and broadcast on Altair have had recognition on the Emission Awards, which is a Faculty of Communications‚Äô exhibit that gathers some of the student's most significant academic works. History The suggestion for a digital radio broadcast system in the Faculty was given by a group of students, created and headed by Luz Dary Gil Cort√©s. In the beginning, Altair was conceived as a research, extension and teaching support place in virtual communication media. Its consolidation took place in 2001, with the Hypermedial educational contents through Altair for the Antioquia Department project proposal. The project was cofinanced by the Faculty of Communications, the University of Antioquia and Edatel, and it had the approval by the Research Development Committee. The project application took place between 2002 and 2003, and it allowed the physical, technical and human resources acquisition. From that moment on, the theory groundwork in the hypermedial mainstream strengthens, keeping the online radial content production. The laboratory is now known as Radio Altair ‚Äì Altair Hypermedia. This new orientation's first components are Antioquia Channel and Educational Altair. The first one refers to the web-based content creation for Antioquia using graphics, text, sound and audiovisual elements regarding the department sub regions. The second module, Educational Altair, was constituted as the first virtual education effort in the Faculty of Communications. It consists on platforms used by many undergraduate students in the University. The online seminars were Mother tongue and Literature Introduction, certifying 30 students both. Between 2003 and 2005, the site's technological development was focused on the Net Radio unit improvement. Engineer Whitman Quintero's work, from 2004 to 2005, made live online broadcast possible using Icecast and RealPlayer software. With this new platform, beginning May 2005, the audio streaming was able to be online all day, every day, significantly increasing the production offer. Thus, the content creation ceases to be limited for the Faculty students, being extended to other University sections. A year later, after observing and analyzing these new offers, a new content diffusion strategy begins. Three custom channels were created to satisfy the differed theme preferences. These three channels were Radio Altair Musik, Radio Altair University, and Radio Altair Colombia. The two first signals were live streaming. The last one emitted an automatic signal. Altair has managed several hypermedia channels targeted to several audiences: Antioquia Channel, Educational Altair, Altair Kids (which in its moments was the only hypermedial proposal for children in the country), interactive Quixote (released in 2005, during the novel's IV centenary commemoration) and products for the University of Antioquia Cultural Radio Station. Generally, the Altair hypermedia global operation was carried out in these fronts: *Research: contribution to academic events and research groups, both by students and teachers. *Extension: radial and hypermedial content creation for University sections and other particular organizations. *Teaching support: attention to an average of 30 students of radio-related subjects by means of classes, training and advising for students and teachers regarding tools and concepts in audio production, and advising scholar students in digital radio and hypermedia subjects. *Teaching school: Students‚Äô participation who acquire advantages in teaching experience as: collaborator, assistant, teacher, researcher. *Internet radio station: program production regarding operation, preproduction, recording and publishing the student's work. *Web site: constant information update by digitalizing, publishing and managing the archives.

The 20 member body advises the government, secular under its 1999 constitution, of the regulation of Islamic festivals, organization of the hadj, protection of religious sites, Mosque construction, oversight of Muslim charities and schools, and the zakat.

Portions are used here verbatim. The CIN is a successor organization of the 1974 Islamic Association of Niger (AIN), which itself succeeded the Islamic Cultural Association of Niger (f. 1960). Each of these organizations were created under single party governments to accredit and manage religious teaching and institutions, and each contained only representatives of the Sufi Muslim brotherhoods which form the majority of Niger's Islamic community. The dominant Sufi order in Niger is the Tijaniyya.Pearl T. Robinson. ISLAM AND FEMALE EMPOWERMENT AMONG THETIJANIYYA IN NIGER . Research Note: September 2005. Tufts University. With the coming of democracy in 1990, Muslim associations multiplied, including those representing religious minorities, and those funded by foreign groups, including Wahhabi groups funded by Saudi Arabia. The 1990s saw several sensational incidents of conflict between minority Muslim groups and both the government, more secular members of society, and the mainstream Sufi leaders. Mandate and actions The Council's mandate is to meet and advise the Government on issues of concern to Muslims, including preaching, mosque construction, and zakat. The council was also charged with promoting a culture of tolerance and social peace. During the installation of the council, Prime Minister of Niger Hama Amadou noted that the organization was also intended \\"to address behaviors and practices inspired by foreign countries.\\" This remark was broadly interpreted to mean that the council would promote the practice of the moderate, tolerant Islam that the country has known for centuries, while countering extremist interpretations imported from, or influenced by, other Islamic countries. The minister of the interior also announced that a Christian council would be established in the near future. The CIN sets the dates for religious observances, licenses religious education and training, and asserts the right to oversee sermons and the building of Mosques‚Äîalthough foreign governments have questioned their ability to do the last two in practice.

The Bruce Trail links the reserve to other protected areas of the Niagara Escarpment. Landform The topography of the area was greatly influenced by glacial processes, followed by fluvial erosion. The reserve is characterized by a till moraine and other glacial features, such as kames and kettles. A deeply cut tributary valley to the Nottawasaga River bisects the reserve through its centre. The Niagara Escarpment's dolomite caprock (the Amabel Formation) can be seen in the upper parts of the gorge; rapids and waterfalls expose stratigraphic succession down to the Queenston Shale. Flora and fauna Within the reserve, 417 species of vascular plants, many of which are rare, have been identified. This includes the regionally rare cuckoo flower and the sand violet, as well as the nationally endangered butternut, population of which has dwindled due to the butternut canker disease. Fauna includes the locally rare northern long-eared bat, the nationally vulnerable Louisiana waterthrush and the northern brook lamprey, as well as the nationally threatened Jefferson salamander. Activities Recreation in the park is limited. Due to the park's designation as a nature reserve, permitted activities are limited to hiking, and snowshoeing; no visitor facilities are present or planned.

Publicado en Pablo de Rokha. Genio del pueblo, p√°g. 341. . His family was middle class farmers from a rural area and de Rokha's father did various jobs to earn a living, such as a farm manager and a chief customs officer in the Andes border crossings. De Rokha spent his childhood on the farm \\"Pocoa de Corinto\\" (Pocoa of Corinth farm) where his father was working as manager, and used to accompany his father to the Andes border crossings. In 1901, de Rokha joined Public School Number 3 in the town of Talca. The following year he joined the San Pelayo de Talca Seminary, from which he was expelled in 1911 for reading 'forbidden' authors like Rabelais and Voltaire and showing them to his classmates. His classmates give him the nickname \\"El amigo piedra\\" (The Stone/Rock Friend) which he would later transform into \\"Pablo de Rokha\\" (Pablo of Stone), although in this early period his work was signed under the pseudonym of Job D√≠az. Having been expelled from the seminary gave him the chance to move to Santiago, Chile, where he finished the last year of secondary school and enrolled to study Law and Engineering at the University of Chile. However, he soon left the university and dedicated his life to poetry and bohemian Santiago. Around that time he made friends with other intellectuals like Pedro Sienna, √Ångel Cruchaga Santa Mar√≠a and Vicente Huidobro, the latter of whom would become the father of the creationism movement. De Rokha also discovered the philosophy of Friedrich Nietzsche, the po√®te maudit and Walt Whitman, with whom he identified strongly. He also worked as journalist for two newspapers \\"La raz√≥n\\" (Reason) and \\"La ma√±ana\\" (The Morning), and published some of his first poems in the magazine \\"Juventud\\" (Youth). De Rokha returned to Talca in 1914 feeling that he had failed in his goals. There, he read the collection of poems \\"Lo que me dijo el silencio\\" (What the silence told me) by Juana In√©s de la Cruz, the first pseudonym of Luisa Anabal√≥n Sanderson. Despite criticizing the poetry harshly, he fell in love with their writer and returned to Santiago in search of her. In 1916, Luisa Anabal√≥n became his wife, changing her pseudonym to Win√©tt de Rokha.Winett de Rokha (1892-1951) www.memoriachilena.cl Direcci√≥n de Bibliotecas, Archivos y Museos may 16, 2009 Retrieved September 03, 2013 The poet went to the house of his future in-laws with a determined attitude, introducing himself as \\"a poet, and a very proud one\\". He was not welcomed by the family and became an enemy of his future father-in-law, Don Indalecio, to the point where they challenged each other to a duel. Before the agreed date of the duel, the young poet kidnapped Luisa and married her immediately. Years later the poet remembered the incident with his in-laws: \\"¬°Qu√© se hab√≠a cre√≠do! El coronel Anabal√≥n ense√±√°ndole urbanidad a mi hero√≠smo, como un elefante que le tirase la barba al mundo y m√°s encima la suegra peluda y metaf√≥rica como el pat√≠bulo.\\" \\"Who did he think he was! The colonel Anabal√≥n teaching manners to my heroism, like an elephant pulling his beard at the world, and, on top of that, the mother in law hairy and metaphoric as the gallows.\\" That year (1916) the poet published a collection of poems, \\"Versos de infancia\\" (Verses from childhood), in the anthology \\"Selva l√≠rica\\" (Lyric Jungle). Between 1922 and 1924, de Rokha lived in San Felipe and Concepcion, where he founded the magazine Dynamo. Times were turbulent both in Chile and abroad, with the old oligarchic order declining in Chile and the powers of Fascism, Nazism and Stalinism in the ascendency in Europe, leading gradually to the Second World War. It was also a time when working-class people began to be able to participate in political life, empowered by the advance of industrialization and democracy in Latin America. By 1930, Pablo de Rokha was already a strong supporter of Marxism‚ÄìLeninism and Soviet Stalinism, which he linked to Christian ethics. This led him to join the Communist Party of Chile in 1936 and adhere to the Popular Front of Chile that brought to power President Pedro Aguirre Cerda in 1938. The Communist Party made him a congressional candidate but was then expelled from the party in 1940, after his disinterest in following party discipline and his attacks on older comrades made him unpopular with the party leaders. Statue of de Rokha in his hometown of Licant√©n, Chile De Rokha edited, published and sold his own books, never accepting the support of publishing companies, and bought, sold and bartered a variety of goods to support his family. The family was growing fast with the birth of many children: Carlos (the poet known as Carlos de Rokha), Luk√≥ (the painter known as Luk√≥ de Rokha), Tom√°s, Carmen, Juana In√©s, Jos√© (the painter known as Jos√© de Rokha), Pablo, Laura and Flor. Several of them died prematurely: Carmen and Tom√°s very young, while Carlos and Pablo both died. When the poet was older, legally adopted a baby girl called Sandra. In 1944, de Rokha was named Cultural Ambassador of Chile in the Americas by President Juan Antonio R√≠os and began a long trip through the 19 countries of the continent. While he was in Argentina, he heard that a new president had been elected, President Gabriel Gonz√°lez Videla, who, soon after his election, created the \\"Law in Defence of Democracy\\", which began a period of persecution of the Communist party. In 1949, de Rokha returned to Chile, accompanied by his wife Win√©tt de Rokha, who was suffering from cancer. She died in 1951, and in 1953, de Rokha published \\"Fuego Negro\\", a love elegy dedicated to his late wife. The death of Win√©tt was first of a series of tragic events for the family. In 1962, his son Carlos de Rokha (part of the literary generation of 1938 and one of the youngest members of La Mandragora group) died at the age of 42 from a drug overdose. It is not known if his death was an accident or suicide. The death of Carlos affected de Rokha deeply, and he wrote \\"Carta perdida a Carlos de Rokha\\" (Lost Letter to Carlos de Rokha): \\"The mark of genius of Win√©tt de Rokha pursued you, like a great eagle of fire, from the cradle to the grave, but did not influence you, because no one on earth influenced you. Forgive me for having given you life.\\" \\"El sello del genio de Win√©tt de Rokha, te persigui√≥, como una gran √°guila de fuego, desde la cuna a la tumba, pero no te influy√≥, porque no te influy√≥ nadie, encima del mundo.

Retrieved September 20, 2013 Then, in 1968, de Rokha's son Pablo shot himself. Four months later, de Rokha killed himself in the same way, with a Smith & Wesson .44 revolver, a gift from the Mexican muralist David Alfaro Siqueiros. That same day, two hours after his death, officials from the municipality of La Reina arrived at his house at 160 Valladolid to inform him that the authorities had decided to change the name of the street to his name in his honour.

Work In Chile, important critics of the time such as Hern√°n D√≠az Arrieta (\\"Alone\\") and Raul Silva Castro despised de Rokha's work. However, today his writing is widely studied and the poet is considered one of The four greats of Chilean poetry, along with Neruda, Huidobro and Mistral. The literary critic Na√≠n N√≥mez divides de Rokha's work into three stages. The first covers the period from 1916 to 1929, characterized by the influence of romanticism and his anarchic ideas,El anarquismo en Chile (1890-1953) www.memoriachilena.cl Direcci√≥n de Bibliotecas, Archivos y Museos may 16, 2009 Retrieved September 03, 2013 mixed with biblical and religious elements.

He was largely ignored by the critics, who were more interested in modernism, the popular trend of the time. The 1930 to 1950 period was marked by political activism, exemplified by \\"Canto de trinchera\\" (Trench song, 1929‚Äì1933), \\"Imprecaci√≥n a la bestia fascista\\" (Curse the fascist beast, 1937), \\"Cinco cantos rojos\\" (Five red songs, 1938), \\"Morfolog√≠a del espanto\\" (Morphology of terror, 1942), \\"Arenga sobre el arte\\" (Rant about art, 1949) and \\"Carta magna de Am√©rica\\" (Magna Carta of America, 1948). In 1939, de Rokha founded his own magazine, \\"Multitud: revista del pueblo y la alta cultura\\" (Multitud: magazine of the people and high culture), which would later become a publishing house. In the third stage, covering his last two decades, de Rokha's works showed a mixture of optimism, social protest and lost love following the death of his wife, as can be seen in his work \\"Fuego negro\\" (Black fire, 1953).Fuego negro : po√©tica : facsimilares (Downloadable pdf) www.memoriachilena.cl Direcci√≥n de Bibliotecas, Archivos y Museos may 16, 2009 Retrieved September 19, 2013 His famous rivalry with Pablo Neruda was heightened by the publication of the essay \\"Neruda y Yo\\" (Neruda and I, 1955), in which de Rokha referred to Neruda as a \\"bourgois artist\\" and accused him of plagiarism.PABLO DE ROKHA Na√≠n N√≥mez retrieved October 15, 2013 The controversy continued with his book \\"Genio del pueblo\\" (Genius of the people, 1960), an imagined conversation between 111 characters from high and popular culture including Neruda, who appears under the name Casiano Basualto. In 1961, de Rokha released \\"Acero de Invierno\\" (Winter steel), which included the poem \\"Canto del macho anciano\\" (Song of the elder male). In 1965, he won the National Prize for Literature, and said at the ceremony: \\"It came late, almost as a compliment, and because they believed I was not going to cause any more trouble\\".\\"Por Unanimidad fue Otorgado Premio Nacional de Literatura 1965 al Poeta Pablo de Rokha\\", El Mercurio (25 Sept. 1965), p. 31 In 1967 he published his last book, Mundo a mundo: Francia (World to world: France).

He won the Chilean National Prize for Literature in 1974.  Life  Sady Za√±artu Sady Za√±artu was born in the town of Taltal, Chile, the younger of two sons. His parents, V√≠ctor Za√±artu de la Cruz and Edelmira Bustos Fr√≠as, were farmers in the Copiap√≥ Valley who also worked for a good part of their lives as miners. When he was very young, he moved to Santiago to study at the Internado Nacional Barros Arana, the Instituto de Aplicaci√≥n, and the Instituto Nacional. Although he did not go on to a college career, Za√±artu dedicated himself to research, and he always remained close to the intellectual circles of the era, such as the salons held by Delia Matte. He was also the founder of the Sociedad de Escritores de Chile, the Pen Club de Chile, and the Instituto de Conmemoraci√≥n Hist√≥rica. Za√±artu was motivated by a passion to search for ever greater knowledge, and he had a sharp understanding of literary currents. He said of his own life: > I began to write when I was completing my military service, at 20 years old. > When I left for the military camp, I sent stories to the newspaper La > Ma√±ana. I gathered up these chronicles in 1915, and put together the book > Desde el Vivac. By that point he had also written the official song of the Buin Regiment, which would make it famous. This may be where his affinity for patriotic themes, historical stories, and nationalistic motifs originated. In his work, Za√±artu would search through archives, consult documents, read everything there was to read on a subject that interested him, speak with the people involved, and travel to the locations where the action had happened. His literary work was precise and faithful. Za√±artu was the director of the magazine Zig-Zag from 1925-1929. He also contributed to the newspapers La Naci√≥n and Los Tiempos. He was actively involved in the publications of the Gaceta Literaria in 1944. For his distinguished work as a writer and journalist, he received the Athena Award of the University of Concepci√≥n. The famous Chilean critic Omer Emeth said in 1927 of Za√±artu's novel La sombra del corregidor: > With four or five novels like that of Sady Za√±artu, we could make an > excellent study of the history of Chile. In 1940, he took up the post of cultural attach√© in Lima during the administration of Pedro Aguirre Cerda. He died in 1983, in Valpara√≠so, and was buried in Santiago. = A controversial National Prize = Za√±artu received the Chilean National Prize for Literature in 1974, but his selection raised suspicion and controversy on Chile's intellectual and political left. The historical context of the award was the first years of Chile's military dictatorship under Augusto Pinochet, and the opinion spread widely that the writer, who was considered by some to be a minor author, was only given the National Prize because he was one of the few intellectuals who were close to the newly installed regime. Left-leaning critics protested against the awarding of the prize to Za√±artu and, the following year, to Arturo Aldunate Phillips, the author of essays on popular science. They also subsequently protested the prize going to the linguist Rodolfo Oroz, whose best-known work was a Scholastic Dictionary of the Spanish Language. However, in explaining its selection of Za√±artu, the jury argued that it had been \\"very clear in specifying our motives for the unanimous selection: 1. For his broad and deep literary activity over 54 years. 2. His representation of Chilean identity across his works, such as La sombra del corregidor and others, that add up to a total of 20 literary and historical books. 3. In honor of his work to protect the great values of the nation and because Sady Za√±artu, at 82 years of age, continues to actively produce artistic work.\\"  Works  * Desde el vivac, 1915. * Sor Rosario, 1916. * La danzarina del fuego, 1918. * La sombra del corregidor, 1927. * Llampo brujo, 1933. * Lastarria, el hombre solo, biography, 1938. * Chilecito, regional stories, 1939. * Mar hondo, memoir, 1942. * El Tile viejo y sus cuentos, stories, 1963. * Tomelonco, agrarian poetry, 1968. * Color Am√©rica, stories, 1969.

It is part of the Buffalo Grove Park District and an award-winning member of the Illinois Association of Museums. History The village of Buffalo Grove began as a German dairy farming community in the 1840s. The families of Melchoir Raupp and Jacob Weidner were among the first to settle the area. The community grew steadily and was incorporated as a village in 1958. As it became more suburban, farms were sold off to developers. While selling off their land in 1964, Philip, Carl and John Raupp (three bachelor brothers and descendants of Melchoir Raupp) also donated three acres and their farmhouse to the Village of Buffalo Grove. The land was later transferred to the Buffalo Grove Park District on the condition that the land would be used for either a museum or library.http://bgparks.org/facilities/museum.aspx The Park District moved forward with plans to turn the area into a museum dedicated to the history of Buffalo Grove and renovations commenced on the farmhouse. The project was moving along until 1972, when the farmhouse caught fire and burned to the ground. The Levitt Company, a local subdivision developer, having completed building all three of its subdivisions, agreed to donate its sales office to serve as the new museum building. In 1975, the building was moved and rolled down Arlington Heights Road to its current location on Dunham Lane http://rauppmuseum.wordpress.com/about/ This Illinois museum officially opened to the community and dedicated on September 16, 1979. The building has undergone several major renovations since its dedication. Construction in 2002 added a large main gallery wing, a lower level gallery, and collection storage area. In 2013, the museum received a state grant to overhaul the old Town Square in the original Levitt building and make it ADA compliant. The gallery was completely gutted and replaced as The Crossroads, which opened in April 2014.https://www.dailyherald.com/article/20140308/news/140308475/ Exhibits The museum offers a variety of educational programs for scouts and schools that correspond with rotating exhibits and meet state Common Core Standards. The museum's collection contains over 3000 local history artifacts that are displayed and stored on-site in the three interactive gallery spaces. The main gallery depicts the chronological social history of Buffalo Grove starting in the 1830s. This follows the stories of early people that settled in the area including the Potawatomi and farm families. Then it explores the growth of the area as an incorporated village suburb through the 1950s and 1960s. The second gallery used to feature walk-in environments from Town Square businesses in the 1880s including: the Gerschefske Barber Shop, a pharmacy, Weidner Store, a saloon and Tripp School. This had been on exhibit since the museum's dedication. It was replaced in 2014 after a year-long renovation. Today, the space features environments to tell new stories from the 1910-1930s. It includes a greenhouse representing nurseries in the area like Geimer and Fiore, the Prairie View train station, the Welter gas station, and Weidner General Store. The third gallery holds temporary exhibits that rotate several times a year. Past exhibits have included local painters' showcases, kites, the American Civil War, and women's suffrage. This space is also used for programming and special events.

History ATG Stores was founded in 1999 with the launch of its first website, Lighting Universe, with the goal to consolidate lighting catalogs and pricing online for designers, homeowners and contractors. In 2000 LightingUniverse.com went live, and two years later ATG Stores launched FixtureUniverse.com, targeting plumbing fixtures and decorative bath products. In 2003 Allied Trade Group, Inc. was formed as the parent company of Lighting Universe and Fixture Universe with the goal to grow into a full line home furnishings supplier. ATG Stores added 50 stores in the beginning of 2008 and at one point encompassed around 500 websites in multiple home furnishing, utility and paraphernalia categories, specializing in product sales of a variety of brand name manufacturers. ATG Stores opened their first brick and mortar showroom in May 2004 in Kirkland, Washington; and their second showroom was purchased from The Lighting Co in August 2004. There were as many as seven ATG retail showrooms, all of which have closed. Lowe's Home Improvement acquired ATG Stores on December 29, 2011 with the intention of expanding the product variety available to Lowe's stores and Lowes.com while also bringing more traffic and credibility to ATG Stores as an online e-tailer.

Rilla is known for directing Village of the Damned (1960). He wrote many books for students, such as The Writer and the Screen: On Writing for Film and Television and The A to Z of Movie Making. Early life and career Rilla was born in Berlin, where his father Walter Rilla was an actor and producer. (Originally published in the Reference Guide to British and Irish Film Directors In common with many others in entertainment and the arts, Walter recognised the dangers when Hitler came to power, and the family moved to London in 1934 when Wolf was 14.) He completed his schooling at the enlightened co-educational Frensham Heights School, Surrey, and went on to St Catharine's College, Cambridge. In 1942, he joined the BBC External Service's German section, beginning as a script editor, but transferred to television in the late 1940s. Film and television career Rilla left the BBC staff in 1952 to pursue a career making films, but continued to take on television productions as a freelance. For television, he directed episodes of series such as The Adventures of Aggie, a sitcom, and The Adventures of the Scarlet Pimpernel (both 1956), both produced for ITV, but also aimed at the American market. Later, he wrote episodes of the Paul Temple television series. Meanwhile, in the cinema he worked for Group 3, a production company set up by the National Film Finance Corporation with Michael Balcon, John Baxter and John Grierson in charge. The intention was to give young talent a chance to make modestly budgeted films (those costing less than ¬£50,000), but the arrangement only survived until 1956. By 1960, Rilla was working regularly for MGM-British Studios. His best remembered film, Village of the Damned (1960), dates from his period with the American studio's British subsidiary. Derived from John Wyndham's sci-fi novel The Midwich Cuckoos. As well as directing the film, Rilla collaborated with producer Ronald Kinnoch (using the pseudonym Geoffrey Barclay) and Stirling Silliphant on the adaptation. George Sanders co-starred with Barbara Shelley. In his other film for MGM-British, Rilla directed his father, along with George Sanders and Richard Johnson, in Cairo (1963), a remake of John Huston's The Asphalt Jungle, with Tutankhamun's jewels in a Cairo museum now the target of the robbers. His novels included Greek Chorus, The Dispensable Man, The Chinese Consortium and one simply entitled Movie. Rilla also wrote an episode of Doomwatch entitled The Devil's Demolition however the series was cancelled before it was produced. Personal life Rilla married the actress and director Valerie Hanson after they appeared together in a BBC television production of The Portugal Lady; the couple had a daughter, Madeleine, in 1955. In 1967, he married Shirley Graham- Ellis, a publicist for tea suppliers Jacksons of Piccadilly and London Films. Rilla and Graham-Ellis had a son, Nico, who has been a filmmaker and chef. His daughter Madeline died in a car crash in 1985. After Rilla had held office in both the film technicians' union ACTT and the Directors' Guild, he and Shirley moved to the south of France, to buy and run a hotel at Fayence in Provence.

Retrieved February 2014.  Early life  She was born in Darmstadt, Germany on 2 May 1911 to Margarete Neumann (1885‚Äì1954) and Julius Joel Goldstein (1873‚Äì1929), a philosopher.Lipman, Maureen \\"Elsbeth Juda: Portrait of a Role Model\\" The Jewish Chronicle. Retrieved January 2014. As a young woman, she moved to Paris, where she found work as secretary to a banker. In 1931, Elsbeth married her childhood love, Hans Peter Juda (1904‚Äì1975), and they went to live in Berlin where he was a financial editor at the Berliner Tageblatt. In 1933, they fled Nazi Germany for London with nothing but two suitcases and a violin.  Career  Juda studied photography under the Bauhaus photographer Lucia Moholy, the wife of the artist L√°szl√≥ Moholy-Nagy. At the time Juda and her husband Hans lived in London, where Hans was the publisher of a British trade magazine called The Ambassador, for which L√°szl√≥ Moholy-Nagy was the Art Director. Lucia Moholy would visit Juda at her home to teach her photography. Soon after, Juda did a stint as a \\"dark room boy\\" at the Scaioni Studio in London. She later worked as a photographer for advertising companies and fashion magazines, including Harper's Bazaar . = The Ambassador = Hans and Elsbeth Juda originally opened a London satellite office for the Dutch trade magazine International Textiles.Pohl, Uscha.\\"Elsbeth Juda ‚Äì Jay Very Magazine. Retrieved January 2014. After 1940, however, when Amsterdam came under control of the Germany army, the magazine proved too difficult to continue. In March 1946 the Judas changed the name of the publication to The Ambassador and changed its focus to British industry, trade and exports. The magazine was influential from its inception and encouraged by the British Government, who helped by ensuring a continual supply of paper during the war. Indeed, The Ambassador, The British Export Magazine became the voice of British manufacturing for export when the nation's trade was struggling to emerge after 1945. It was published monthly in four languages (English, German, French and Portuguese), had subscribers in over ninety countries, and a circulation of 23,000 copies. Juda's husband, Hans, coined the official motto \\"Export or Die\\" for The Ambassador. Later, as the magazine became an essential marketing and press journal for a Britain desperate to reestablish itself as a global exporter in the post-war era, the phrase would become a mantra for the national manufacturing industry. Throughout their work during the 1940s, 1950s and 1960s, Juda and her husband became two of the United Kingdom's greatest champions for export, constantly promoting every facet of British manufacturing, culture and the arts and, in the process, coming into close contact with a host of distinguished artists, writers, designers and photographers. The critic Robert Melville described Ambassador as \\"the most daring and enterprising trade journal ever conceived...no other magazine...has so consistently and brilliantly demonstrated the relevance of works of art to the problems of industrial design.\\"Hodgson, Francis. \\"Glamour meets commercial photography\\" FT Magazine. Retrieved January 2014. Juda's shoots for The Ambassador combined elements of fashion, modernism and trade. Her series of photos of the famed British model Barbara Goalen modeling Scottish textiles among the heavy machinery of working textile factory are especially representative of her unique visual aesthetics. Together they built a considerable art collection from the many artists that they came in contact with at The Ambassador. It is a much wider circle of friends, however, which would allow Jay to capture every facet of a reemerging post-war Britain through the lens of her camera. The magazine was bought by Thomson Publications in 1961 and continued to be published until 1972. Exhibition ‚Äì L‚ÄôEquipement des Arts In 2009 the gallery L‚ÄôEquipement des Arts held a long overdue and immensely successful exhibition of Elsbeth Juda's Photographs from 1940 to 1965. L‚ÄôEquipement des Arts coordinated an extensive research and academic project to find and retrieve materiel from The Ambassador Archive at the V&A; Museum to make the exhibition possible. This culminated with negatives being loaned by the V&A; Museum and National Portrait Gallery to produce 140 historic prints, many of which had never been seen or shown before. These include a unique record of Graham Sutherland's ill-fated portrait of Sir Winston Churchill commissioned by the House of Commons to celebrate his 80th birthday. The exhibition also showed for the first time, a series of photographs which illustrate Elsbeth Juda's unprecedented access to Henry Moore and his studio as he worked on the sculpture King and Queen. The exhibition featured dramatic photographs of a model draped in only fabric and photographed on the roof of Lancashire mill to promote the British textile industry. Other images include Joe Tilson, William Scott, Lynn Chadwick, Osbert Lancaster and Peter Blake are among many leading artists of the day photographed by Elsbeth. So were the era's leading models including Barbara Goalen, Fiona Campbell-Walter, Lisa Fonssagrives-Penn, Shelagh Wilson and Marla Scarafia. While headline personalities of the time such as Margot Fonteyn, Richard Burton, Anthony Armstrong-Jones and Peter Ustinov and friends like Norman Parkinson, Mark Boxer and Madge Garland were all affectionately portrayed. Elsbeth used locations to provide unexpected theatrical backdrops to her work and was able to take full advantage of the new age of jet to travel. She was sent to worldwide destinations on assignments for The Ambassador Magazine. Elsbeth's photographs display wit and a wild humor. However and more importantly her work reveals a creativity that pushed the perceived boundaries of fashion photography at the time. Her images are poignant, they reflect a bygone era, but remain ahead of their time and are especially relevant today. L‚ÄôEquipement des Arts presentation of Elsbeth Juda photographs in 2009 was the first and only major exhibition of her photographic work. A number of articles cited below in notes and references were for the most part a result of this exhibition. =Portraits= Juda was a portraitist who photographed many British artists of the 1950 and 1960s, including Henry Moore, John Piper (artist), Graham Sutherland, Kenneth Armitage, and Peter Blake (artist). = Churchill portrait by Graham Sutherland = Juda was present to photograph and document Graham Sutherland's portrait of Sir Winston Churchill, which was commissioned in 1954 by the past and present members of the House of Lords and the House of Commons of the United Kingdom in celebration of Churchill's eightieth birthday.Lichtig, Toby.\\"The afterlives of art\\" The Times Literary Supplement. Retrieved January 2014. Sutherland's resulting controversial portrait became infamous because Churchill openly hated it and stated that it \\"makes me look half-witted\\". After it was publicly unveiled in Westminster Hall on 30 November 1954 Sutherland's portrait was hidden and then destroyed (by order of Lady Churchill). Juda's photographs record the day when an elderly Churchill can be seen being posed by Sutherland. Churchill's vigour was fading; in the previous year he had suffered a stroke and, although he had recovered, the effects of age and illness were increasingly apparent. He also drank heavily at lunchtime. According to Juda, during the session Graham Sutherland would say, 'A little more of the old lion, sir' and he'd sit up and then flop after a minute.Rose, Hilary.\\"Contacts -Churchill poses for Sutherland\\" The Times Magazine. Retrieved January 2014. =British Fortnights= Juda started themed months called British Fortnights at the American department stores Lord and Taylor and Neiman Marcus in an effort to promote British brands and goods. Juda was initially approached to create a British Fortnight at Neiman Marcus in Dallas, Texas by Stanley Marcus, who was a fan of The Ambassador Stanley Marcus and Juda eventually become close friends, with Marcus even setting up a trip for Juda to visit the Kodak company in Rochester, New York and the studios of Richard Avedon and Irving Penn. Legacy In 1980 Juda presented the National Portrait Gallery a collection of bromide prints, negatives, contact sheets, and news cuttings relating to her photographs of Winston Churchill and Graham Sutherland. In 1987 Juda donated The Ambassador archives to the Victoria and Albert Museum. The most complete sets of Juda's archives can be found in the British Library and the Victoria and Albert Museum.

He won the Chilean National Prize for Literature in 2000. Biography Ra√∫l Zurita was born in Santiago de Chile in 1950, where he spent his childhood and school years. In 1967 he began his studies of Civil Engineering at the Federico Santa Mar√≠a Technical University in Valparaiso as well as Mathematics at the School of Technical Engineering in Santiago. When on 11 September 1973, Chile's socialist's government was overthrown by a military coup, Ra√∫l Zurita was arrested and detained with almost one thousand others in the hold of a ship; a traumatic experience for the then 22-year-old. At that time he got married with Myriam Mart√≠nez and had three children. Zurita spent four years earning his living as a computer salesman during a period of financial hardship. At the same time he was a guest reader at the Faculty of Philosophy at the Universidad de Chile in Santiago, where he met writers and intellectuals such as Nicanor Parra, Ronald Kay, Christian Hunneus and Enrique Lihn. The first of his poems to be published appeared in 1975 in \\"Manuscritos\\", the Philosophy Faculty's publication. Four years later \\"Purgatorio\\" was published, the first part of a poetic trilogy which Zurita would not conclude for another fourteen years. The book became a huge success. Together with friends Ra√∫l Zurita founded the artists action group \\"Colectivo de Acci√≥n de Arte\\", CADA, in protest against the Pinochet government, but despair in the face of the dictatorship's regime of terror gradually took hold. No longer wanting to witness the pain surrounding him, he attempted to burn his eyes with ammonium acid but fortunately failed. He got married with his second wife and together had his fourth child. In 1982, the second part of Zurita's poetic trilogy entitled \\"Anteparaiso\\" was published. Completion of this book went hand in hand with the project to have 15 verses of the poem written by five aeroplanes in eight- kilometre high letters across the sky over New York. These verses which Zurita had written to draw attention to the minorities of the world could be seen throughout large parts of New York. In 1984, Ra√∫l Zurita was awarded a scholarship by the John Simon Guggenheim Memorial Foundation for his poetical works. Afterwards he gave readings at held lectures at several North American universities, including Harvard, Yale, Stanford and Berkeley. In 1989 he was granted the Pablo Neruda Award for his lifetime poetical achievements. In 1990, Zurita lectured as visiting professor at the Universidad de Chile and in the same year he was made his country's cultural attach√© to Rome by Chile's democratic government under President Patricio Aylwin. At that time he lived with Amparo Mardones for 16 years. During the Expo '92 in Sevilla his works were chosen to represent Chilean poetry. In 1996, he bulldozed the verse, no pain no fear among five kilometres of the Atacama Desert, which can only be seen from the sky. In 2000 he received Chile's national prize for literature. In 2002 he met and then married his present wife, Dr. Paulina Wendt. In 1993 an extensive third volume concluded Ra√∫l Zurita's poetic trilogy. \\"La Vida Nueva\\" draws on Dante's Divina Commedia in tracing and appraising the Chilean people's twenty-year odyssey of suffering and hope and fits its author into place in line with the literary and political tradition of Gabriel Mistral, Pablo Neruda, Nicanor Parra, and other formidable Chilean poets. \\"Zurita\\", a volume of poetry, appeared in 2011. Ra√∫l Zurita, who has suffered from Parkinson's disease since 2002, declared this to be his last publication. However, he has published many more books. In 2014, Copper Canyon Press, with support from The Poetry Foundation, published Pinholes in the Night: Essential Poems from Latin America, an intensely focused bilingual anthology of Latin American poetry, published as a part of \\"Poet in the World,\\" a book series of poetics from around the world, edited by Ilya Kaminsky. This anthology, selected and compiled by Zurita and edited by Forrest Gander, contains one poem by each of eighteen poets, ranging from Pablo Neruda to Ernesto Cardenal to Cesar Vallejo, and spans the twentieth century. He has been married to Paulina Wendt since 2002, to whom he has dedicated all of his recent works. In 2011, he published Zurita, considered a masterpiece. His books have been translated into many languages, among others, English, French, German, Swedish, Bengali, Hindi, Chinese, Italian, Russian, Greek and Slovenian. Currently he is translating the Divina Commedia into Spanish.

The church has a general attendance between 15,000 and 20,000 individuals per week. According to Christian News Report, it is the largest Hispanic church in the United States. While the church has long been known as El Rey Jes√∫s, as the church continues to reach out to a multicultural region, the anglicized name of King Jesus Ministry is becoming known throughout the Miami area.  Structure  = Church founders = The founders of the church are Apostle Guillermo Maldonado and his wife, Prophetess Ana Maldonado. Maldonado arrived in Miami from Honduras, Central America, while his wife, Ana, arrived from Colombia, South America. After nine years of traveling and preaching throughout Central and South America, Maldonado believed that God had called him to establish a ministry in Miami, as a central base, in order to expand the Gospel to the nations of the world. In June 1996, the Maldonado family started the church in the living room of their home with 12 members.Andre Viljoen, gatewaynews.co.za, SA pastors heading for East London for healing equipping, South Africa, July 25, 2011 Maldonado believes that he has been given a mandate by God to carry out a specific mission in south Florida. His goal is to convert 12 percent of the population in Miami to the Christian faith. He believes that his life is set apart to establish the Kingdom of God in Miami, the United States, and throughout the world. His specific mission includes working to evangelize and affirm the community and disciple church members, while preparing them to use their newfound faith to in turn, reach out and perpetuate the process of continued evangelization of south Florida and the city of Miami. Pastor Maldonado's wife, Ana, is considered a prophet by church members at the local, national, and international level. Ana Maldonado serves the church and community, through intercession and spiritual warfare. Pastor Maldonado has authored books on the kingdom of God, anointing, and healing in various areas of an individual's life; while his wife has authored books on prayer, worship, and spiritual warfare. = Church growth = Within three months, the small congregation in the Maldonado home grew from 12 to 40 people. They could no longer fit in the living room, necessitating a move to a small neighborhood building. Almost immediately after moving, it became clear to the members that the small building could no longer accommodate the growing congregation. With over 150 people attending the church, a remodeling projection was undertaken, requiring the pastors to temporarily hold services in a banquet hall, since the city, for safety purposes, would not allow remodeling in the midst of regularly scheduled public gatherings. The banquet hall became a transitional stage in which the faith of the pastors and the church members were tested. The trials served to challenge them to seek God at deeper levels and to care for the people throughout the community who had waited on God for answers to their daily struggles and trials of life. Church development and construction continued to grow at a steady pace. The increasing congregants quickly outgrew their location when attendance surpassed 250 people. By 1998, the membership grew to over 650 people and four services on Sunday. Over the next ten years, the church membership continued to grow exponentially. In 2010, King Jesus Ministry has the capacity to reach 7,000 individuals during each service, with general attendance exceeding 15,000 per week. While the majority of the congregants are Hispanic, the church is transitioning into a multicultural, bi-lingual church, offering services in both English and Spanish. The goal of King Jesus Ministry is to reach the nations of the world by using every means of communication possible, including Internet, radio, television, missionary trips, and by offering missions and evangelistic training for church members, thereby sending them out to continue the ministry of the Church in other areas of the world. To that end, the church has developed affiliated (or daughter) churches based in Naples, Florida; Cape Coral, Florida; Hialeah, Florida; Peque√±a Habana, Florida; Orlando, Florida; Marietta, Georgia; Astoria, New York; and Broward, Florida.  Ministries  = Orphanage = On August 19, 2010, the church founded an orphanage in Honduras in the municipality of Langue, in the department of Valle. The town is located near the border of El Salvador. The orphanage, known as Home House (translated as Casa Hogar in Spanish) has room for about 60 children. Services provided beyond food, clothing, and shelter include spiritual and intellectual education. Together with Apostle Guillermo Maldonado, the home was inaugurated by Honduran President Porfirio Lobo Sosa. Following the dedication ceremony, President Lobo stated the following. > All this contributes to a better Honduras. It is a show of solidarity from a > Langue's son, who is a man stationed abroad, but God always keeps he in the > very important fact to not forget their roots and not forget his people, > especially children who are most vulnerable. ‚ÄîPresident Porfirio Lobo Sosa = Media ministry = King Jesus Ministry has a growing media ministry that includes internet, radio and television. Television programs are broadcast on Enlace, Daystar, Telemundo Miami, Church Channel, Word Network, Trinity Broadcasting Network, and Mega TV Miami. The radio station is broadcast 24 hours per day in Spanish on Radio Zoe 1430 AM.Radio Zoe 1430 AM Google translate from Spanish to English. Retrieved 2010-08-31. = Music ministry = One of the hallmarks of King Jesus Ministry is the praise and worship music. The music ministry is led by a band called New Wine, offering spiritual and biblically-based lyrics, enhanced by contemporary rhythms and a high quality sound. The worship time is often accompanied by visual multimedia effects, including with light and color. = Conference of the Apostolic and Prophetic = King Jesus Ministry has an annual conference, called CAP (Conferencia Apost√≥lica y Prof√©tica in Spanish, Conference of the Apostolic and Prophetic in English). This conference consists of sessions for several days, where speakers are widely known guest preachers in the Pentecostal Christian world. One of the prominent speakers in recent years has been Benny Hinn. In the last years this event has taken place in the American Airlines Arena, located in Downtown Miami. = Community involvement = Apostle Guillermo Maldonado participated in the inauguration of Honduran President Porfirio Lobo, leading the prayer for the president. During the 2010 Florida Republican Party Gubernatorial primary elections, King Jesus Ministry was visited by the two most prominent candidates, Bill McCollum and Rick Scott, who spoke to the congregation and presented their stand on the issues. Associate Pastor John Laffite served as translator to the mostly Hispanic congregation, encouraging church members to pray for their leaders and exercise their right to vote. Also, Rick Scott attended the church two Sunday's away from Election Day as the then Republican candidate for governor. = Building development = On June 1, 2004, the church began to actively develop a vision for the expansion of the church property and buildings in order to effectively meet the needs of the church and community. The congregation continued to grow more each service which made the transition into the next level strategically and feasibly inevitable. The church attendance eventually grew to the point that six worship services plus a youth service were not enough to accommodate the people or meet their needs. With a sanctuary capacity of 7,000, over 8,000 active members attempted to fill the church each week. While everybody was welcomed, the church was required to comply with legal Fire Marshall codes. Unfortunately, hundreds of people each week were turned away, due to lack of parking or seating space in the sanctuary and overflow rooms provided with televised feed. The current church property includes worship facilities comprising with a capacity to simultaneously reach 7,000 people, at a final cost of 18 million dollars; in today's market, the property is worth well over 30 million dollars. In 2010, King Jesus Ministry expanded their vision beyond the current facilities. Plans include the development and construction of a church campus and temple resembling a sporting stadium or arena with capacity to accommodate a high volume of visitors exceeding 20,000 people. Church facilities of this magnitude would establish King Jesus Ministry as one of the largest church campuses in the United States.  Affiliated churches  The church has many affiliated churches, primarily in Florida but a handful outside the state.Geoff Surratt, Greg Ligon, Warren Bird, A Multi-Site Church Roadtrip: Exploring the New Normal, Zondervan, USA, 2009, p. 141 = Homestead, Florida = * King Jesus International Ministry of Homestead ** Pastors: Lisandro and Sandra Parra = Hallandale, Florida = * King Jesus International Ministry of Hallandale ** Pastors: Adam and Andrea Tice = Coral Gables, Florida = * King Jesus International Ministry of Coral Gables ** Pastors: Michael and Ericka Rodriguez = Carrollton, Texas = * King Jesus International Ministry of Dallas ** Pastors: Daniel and Carolina Sandoval = Little Havana, Florida = * Ministerio Manases ** Pastors: Carlos & Clara Valenzuela = Naples, Florida = * King Jesus International Ministry of Naples ** Pastors: Fredy and Blanca Lagos = Cape Coral, Florida = * King Jesus International Ministry of Cape Coral ** Pastors: Kerwin and Gloria Castillo = Hialeah, Florida = * King Jesus International Ministry of Hialeah ** Pastors: Edgar and Monica Ord√≥√±ez = Doral, Florida = * King Jesus International Ministry of Doral ** Pastors: Dublas and Jessica Rodriguez = Orlando, Florida = * King Jesus International Ministry of Orlando ** Pastors: Pablo and Alis Vega = Broward, Florida = * King Jesus International Ministry of Broward ** Pastors: Tommy & Sarah√≠ Acosta = Miami Beach, Florida = * King Jesus International Ministry of Miami Beach ** Pastors: Frank & Melina Hechavarria = Marietta, Georgia = * King Jesus International Ministry of Georgia ** Pastors: Mario and Ana Villa = Astoria, New York = * King Jesus International Ministry of Queens, New York ** Pastors: Leonardo and Liliana Gomez  References   External links  * El Rey Jesus * El Rey Jesus en Vivo * King Jesus Ministry * King Jesus Ministry Live * Official Facebook page * El Rey Jes√∫s Google translate from Spanish to English * Radio Zoe 1430 AM Google translate from Spanish to English * El Rey Jes√∫s - Hialeah Google translate from Spanish to English * El Rey Jes√∫s - Gran Peque√±a Habana Google translate from Spanish to English * El Rey Jes√∫s - Cape Coral Google translate from Spanish to English * El Rey Jes√∫s - Queens Google translate from Spanish to English Category:Evangelical megachurches in the United States Category:Churches in Miami Category:Pentecostal churches in Florida Category:Christian organizations established in 1996 Category:1996 establishments in Florida ","title":"El Rey Jes√∫s"},{"id":"23144490","text":"The 18th Kansas Militia Infantry was an infantry regiment that served in the Union Army during the American Civil War.

History  Wings of Hope was founded by four businessmen from St. Louis, Mo., who had heard of a young woman, Sister Michael Therese Ryan, who was the pilot of a small, fabric-covered Piper PA-18 Super Cub in the Turkana Desert region in Kenya. The founders are William Edwards (St. Louis businessman), Joseph Fabick (Fabick Tractor Company), Paul Rodgers (V.P., Ozark Air Lines), and George Haddaway (famous aviation advocate and publisher of Flight magazine). The story of Sister Ryan using aircraft to bring relief to impoverished famine victims in a vast, remote region of Kenya inspired the men to raise money for a stronger, all-metal aircraft to better aid the effort. After the founders raised the necessary capital for a new Cessna U206, legendary aviator Max Conrad piloted the plane on an epic journey across the Atlantic from St. Louis to Nairobi, Kenya. The story was well publicized and brought about a large response from the international community ‚Äì from people seeking assistance and needing aircraft, to those who wanted to help by offering their time, money and services. From this initial effort of four men on a mission to help those in need, Wings of Hope has grown into a global aviation nonprofit working in 47 countries since its birth in 1962.

Geography A view to the village. Slavyanovo is situated in a flat region with a small inclination from the west to the east. There are four little rivers that flow through the village, three of them have their sources in the village. It is located at 11 km to the south-west of Popovo at an altitude of 330 m. There is a train station on the railway line Sofia-Varna and the main road between Popovo and Antonovo runs through the village. It borders with the lands of the villages Medovina, Baba Tonka and Posabina as well as the neighbourhood of Popovo, Seyachi. The village consists of the following small neighbourhoods, called mahali: Sredna mahala, Krayna mahala, Bolnishka mahala, Bradishka mahala, Vladovska mahala, Cherkovna mahala, Kamburska mahala, Mihalevska mahala, Mutafska mahala, Noevska mahala, Papurska mahala, Srabska mahala, Stoynovska mahala, Tiholska mahala and Chukata. History The village was first mentioned in Ottoman documents of 1524 and 1541 under the name Kara Agach as part of the nahiya Chernovi (Cherven). In a document of 1573 the name was slightly changed to Kara Agadzh. There used to be another village nearby which disappeared. According to a legend the first house in the village was built under an elm (which in Ottoman Turkish was karaaƒüa√ß) and hence its name. In 1894 the village was renamed to Borisovo with a decision of the municipal hall in honour of the birth of the future Tsar Boris III and after the communist regime took power in 1947 it was once again renamed to Slavyanovo. Before the Liberation of Bulgaria the village was populated by Turks and had around 220-250 houses. The Turks used to breed goat and grow crops. In 1877 the village had 211 houses and 1,055 inhabitants. It had a school and a mosque which was burned during the Russo-Turkish War (1877-1878). After the advance of the Russian army in the summer of 1877 the local population fled to the village of Berkovski for a month and then went to the villages in the region of Shumen. After the fall of Pleven they returned to the village but soon started to settle down in Turkey. There were no battles in the area of the village although there were some Turkish forces in the vicinity and after the war the Russians sent troops to cope with the Turkish bands which took refuge in the forests around the village. The first Bulgarians arrived in the village in 1882 from the village of Voditsa in the Teteven Balkan Mountains and in 1883 came people from 70 houses from the area of Tryavna, Elena and Strazhitsa. In 1898 there were 118 Bulgarian and 24 Turkish houses. The first Bulgarian school was opened in 1885 with the first teacher being Angel Gavrailov.

He is a right-handed batsman and occasional legbreak bowler. Born to an Australian father and English mother, Robson played under-19 cricket for Australia but qualified for England in August 2013. In 2012 he became the first batsman to score a first-class hundred in England in the month of March. Career Born 1 July 1989 in Paddington, New South Wales, Robson was educated at Marist College Pagewood before moving to Marcellin College Randwick. Robson had also attended Sydney Boys High School in Year 10, playing in the school's 1st XI in the GPS. His Australian father, Jim Robson, played for Worcestershire County Cricket Club against Ireland in 1979 and now works at the Sydney Cricket Ground. Sam's younger brother Angus plays for Leicestershire. Robson played cricket for New South Wales Under-17s, New South Wales Under-19s, the Australia Under-19 cricket team, the University of New South Wales, and Eastern Suburbs. He left Sydney after school as he was stuck behind Usman Khawaja, his schoolmate Phillip Hughes, and others in the NSW pecking order. He started to play for the Middlesex 2nd XI in 2008, and played his first List A match for Middlesex against Worcestershire in the NatWest Pro40 League on 14 September 2008. He played Grade cricket in Sydney in 2008-9. Robson made his first-class debut in June 2009, scoring 43 and 23 for Middlesex against Essex County Cricket Club at Chelmsford. He is a \\"wiry Australian who loves the circuit\\" and, according to Cricinfo's Mark Pennell, \\"With an English mother and a UK passport to his name, he looks to be a decent find.\\" In his debut season of 2009, he recorded his maiden first-class century, opening the batting against Essex at Lord's in August. He was eventually out for 110 On 31 March 2012, on the first day of a three-day match against Durham MCC University, Robson made cricket history by becoming the first batsman to score a first-class hundred in England in the month of March. Six other batsmen emulated this feat later the same day. International qualification Robson has British and Australian nationality but played for Australia in nine Under-19 ODIs against Pakistan in April and October 2007. He was expected to qualify for England by residency in the summer of 2014 but achieved it unexpectedly early, in August 2013. In order to play for Middlesex on his British passport he signed a document stating his desire and intention to play for and qualify for England but by 2013 had not committed to either Australia or England at senior level. His captain at Middlesex, fellow Aussie Chris Rogers, said that Robson considered a return to Australia but \\"I think his future is in England\\", while the Middlesex director of cricket Angus Fraser said in August 2013 \\"I'm pretty sure that it'll be playing for England\\". Robson has expressed a clear commitment to Middlesex as he views the County Championship as the best tournament for his development as a cricketer, but under current rules as a dual national he would be treated as an Australian player if he played for an Australian state side and thus would be treated as an overseas player at Middlesex. Cricket Australia changed their rules in August 2013 to allow dual nationals to be treated as overseas players in Australia, so that he could play for NSW in the 2013‚Äì14 Sheffield Shield season without compromising his status at Middlesex, which could lead to him playing for the Australian Test side. However, in June 2014 he was named in the England Test squad for their series against Sri Lanka, before making his debut in the first Test. Robson scored 1 and 19 on his Test debut, before making his maiden Test century with 127 in the first innings of the second Test. International career Robson has played in seven Test matches for England, all in 2014. He was named in the England squad to face Sri Lanka on their tour of England in June, making his debut in the first Test. In his second international he scored his only Test cricket century, making 127 runs in England's first innings. Robson retained his place for the first Test against India, making a half century in the match. He went on to play in the other four matches of the tour, although he was not able to make more than 37 runs in an innings.

Originally published in 1956 and still in print today,The Idries Shah Foundation page on Oriental Magic it was the first of this author‚Äôs 35 books. The work was launched with the encouragement of the anthropologist, Professor Louis Marin,Member of the Institut de France, Director of the Ecole d‚ÄùAnthropologie de Paris and Deputy-President of the International Institute of Anthropology \\"Dr. Louis Marin hailed his anthropological text Oriental Magic as an important work‚Äîand he is head of the Paris School of Anthropology.\\" who in his preface to the book stressed its ‚Äúscholarly accuracy‚Äù and ‚Äúreal contribution to knowledge‚Äù. Magic had long been considered outside the discipline of academic study, but Shah‚Äôs approach, which involved five years of study and field work, was ‚Äì very unusually for the 1950s ‚Äì multi-disciplinary and cross- cultural. His documented material came from archaeology, anthropology, history, religion, and psychology, as well as from artefacts, obscure manuscripts, and an impressive range of expert informants, who made (often unpublished) specialist material available to him. As a result, the secrecy and obfuscation around magical operations and practitioners was defused by the author‚Äôs informed, dispassionate approach to the array of arcane information he had assembled, some of it printed for the first time. Oriental Magic seems also to have been a clearly stated invitation for magic in general to be investigated as any other subject in the West would be, with coolness, objectivity and scientific method. The book in itself can be seen as providing a ground plan for future researchers, signalling useful directions their investigations might take, and specifying topics which might yield to further study. Content The author examines a vast accumulation of materials on human beliefs, magical practices and ceremonies, from North Africa to Japan. Among much else, these include a conspectus of Jewish, Tibetan, Arabian, Iranian and Indian magic, an account of Sufism and its origins, legends of the sorcerers, examples of alchemy, talismans and magical rites found in the cultures studied, and topics such as love magic, the witchdoctors of the Nile Valley, the ‚Äòsinging sands‚Äô of Egypt, subcutaneous electricity, and the prehistoric sources of Babylonian occult practices. There are also personal accounts of, for instance, Shah‚Äôs ‚Äòtraining‚Äô under a Ju-Ju witch doctor, a demonstration of Hindu levitation, and translations of what were considered secret alchemical and magical formulae. Shah finds that magical origins in High Asia have influenced communities halfway across the world, and that the westward drift from that original source might explain the great similarity in magical beliefs, practices and terminology in places as diverse as China, the Near East, Scandinavia and Africa. The type of witch-doctoring (shamanism) practised in the east, for example, is duplicated among the Finns, the Sami, and even the American Indians. The author tracks distortions from original sources, winnows fact from supposition, allows for alternative explanations of phenomena, such as physiological and psychological responses which are separate from the apparent ‚Äúmagic‚Äù, and shows how much dross has accumulated around many of the practices he inspects. But he suggests there also remains a residue of what, in magical terminology, could be called ‚Äúpure gold‚Äù, and that some of this ‚Äúgold‚Äù is likely to reflect hitherto little-understood forces ‚Äúwhich may very possibly be harnessed to individual and collective advantage‚Äù. Idries Shah Reception Oriental Magic has been in print for more than 50 years. The Book Exchange, referring to its re-publication in 1968, said the book had ‚Äúcome to be regarded as essential reading for those concerned with research in the fields of human beliefs‚Äù. At the time of first publication, The Times Literary Supplement described it as containing a ‚Äúwealth of illustrative material‚Äù for which the lay reader might be grateful. The religious periodical, Hibbert Journal, called it ‚Äúfascinating and illuminating‚Äù, with ‚Äúa great deal of interesting information‚Äù, and said that ‚Äúthe accounts of personal experience in the Sudan and Tibet were ‚Äúespecially ‚Ä¶ fascinating‚Äù. Time & Tide, a general circulation weekly, said it was ‚Äúa most interesting collection of facts concerning magical practices and their history‚Äù, with ‚Äúan admirable bibliography‚Äù and also ‚Ä¶. ‚Äúheaped with various jewels‚Äù ‚Ä¶ [which] ‚Äúshould provide a rich source of data for psychologists, anthropologists and psychical research‚Äù. The scientific journal Nature said Shah‚Äôs approach was ‚Äúa point of view of which too little has been heard in the past‚Äù, and recommended the work as ‚Äúvaluable and entertaining reading‚Äù. Contemporary Review called it ‚Äúa serious work of considerable anthropological interest.‚Äù Professor Louis Marin wrote: ‚ÄúOriental Magic deserves to find a wide audience of educated readers‚Äù.Amazon.com page on Oriental Magic In a review in the Journal of Bible and Religion (1958), Swami Akhilananda of the Ramakrishna Vedanta Society in Boston, Massachusetts, wrote that Shah had been \\"the first to write on Oriental Magic as it is presented in this fascinating book.\\" He praised the breadth of the book's coverage, noting that it covered many different religious traditions, and commented on the fact that Shah had evidently travelled widely to collect his source material. Reviewing the book in the Journal of Asian Studies (1958), Alan J. A. Elliot wrote that \\"Shah obviously has a profound personal interest in the occult, and has gone to very great lengths to collect a great amount on interesting information. His method of exposition is, however, most likely to appeal to the reader without a strongly developed scientific interest in the subject.\\" Elliott considered the book too short to do justice to the wide range of practices and traditions it sought to cover, spanning all of Europe and much of Africa and Asia; nevertheless he concluded Oriental Magic was a \\"well-written and interesting book\\", and a \\"contribution to the study of the occult, whatever the source of a student's interest in the subject may be.\\" See also *Eleven Naqshbandi principles References External links * Official Idries Shah Foundation website * Free online read Category:Magic (supernatural) Category:Cross- cultural studies Category:Books by Idries Shah Category:Occult books Category:1956 non-fiction books ","title":"Oriental Magic"},{"id":"23144535","text":"The 20th Kansas Militia Infantry was an infantry regiment that served in the Union Army during the American Civil War.

In the 1999‚Äì2000 season, Lannemezan earned promotion to Pro D2 for the first time, but its promotion was blocked by the Ligue Nationale de Rugby (LNR), administrator of the French professional leagues. Stadoceste Tarbais, from the nearby community of Tarbes, which had just earned promotion to the second amateur level, F√©d√©rale 2, offered a merger. While CAL's board strongly opposed the merger, its president pushed the plan through, and the newly merged Lannemezan Tarbes Hautes-Pyr√©n√©es (also known as LT65) took Lannemezan's place in Pro D2, although CAL kept its youth teams and its charter. However, tensions quickly arose between the two merged clubs, exacerbated by the fact that all home games were played in Tarbes. The merged club soon changed its name to Tarbes Pyr√©n√©es Rugby. In 2003, CAL decided to relaunch its senior side, starting in F√©d√©rale 3, the third level of French amateur rugby.

Born in Yahatahigashi-ku, Kitaky≈´sh≈´ to parents from Kumamoto and Okinawa, Yuhnagi grew up in the city and began both professional and commercial fashion modeling at the age of 11. Her early commercial appearances were for Fukuoka- local teen magazines.Nishinippon Shimbun (Kitakyushu & Kyochiku) January 7, 2001 Biography =History= After being discovered by a Shogakukan's magazine editor, at the age of 12, she began appearing in a number of well- known fashion magazines such as Vivi and Seventeen under her several stage names, and also in several TV / print ads. She signed exclusive contracts with at least 9 fashion houses in her first 3 years of modeling. She was notorious for her violence against people especially men such as male designers, and her alcohol issues as she was a heavy drinker. One of her alcohol-related incidents took place in August 2000, when she was arrested together with another fashion model, allegedly her friend Anna Tsuchiya, after running full- naked on Omiya's mainstreet and in a public high school filled with hundreds of students, while under the influence of a large amount of alcohol. Tsuchiya (also naked but shown only from the waist up for short times) chased Yuhnagi but failed to catch her, and then Yuhnagi assaulted a policeman who subdued Tsuchiya, and eventually she was arrested.Jitsuwa Nuckles '06 May Gohgai [P.121] - Million Publicing TV Saitama's News 930 channel reported this incident, but sank their names for a voluntary restraint related to the Youth Act law, describing Yuhnagi as a \\"rampaging young girl with dyed, pink-colored hair and some heavy accent, a professional model\\". In late 2000, as a high- featured teenage model with a rapidly rising popularity, she appeared on several television programs which included TV Asahi's Tonight 2 and TBS's Wonderful. =Death= On January 4, 2001 after drinking too much Shochu, Vodka and Dom Perignon, Yuhnagi slept in a park located near her condominium and was frozen, eventually died of hypothermia, at the age of 17. She was not an alcoholic in medical terms, but some witnesses assumed that she in her later days would drink not for pleasure, as it seemed more like an obsession as if she was possessed by something. =Legacy= Near the end of 2010, according to Natsuki Kato's column on the Nikkei BP magazine, several Kyushu- born fashion models, including Rena Takeshita, paid tribute to Yuhnagi with a special banquet in Otsu. As of 2011, ten years after her death, her name has still not been forgotten in her homeland, the Northern Kyushu area. A Fukuoka- based lifestyle magazine named Fukuoka-mon conducted a poll in March 2011, on which Yoshika was named one of the five most popular fashion models among women in their twenties there.

Biography Funkghost was born in Newport News, Virginia on June 26, 1972. In 1986, his family relocated to Tampa, Florida. After graduation from Bloomingdale High School in 1990, he began performing in and around Tampa's Ybor City commercial district with various bands/DJ's helping form the emerging hip hop scene in the Tampa Bay Area. Career Funkghost began his career in the early 1990s as a studio apprentice under the tutelage of keyboard/organ player Edwin Birdsong, who had worked extensively in the 1970s and early 1980s with Jazz Musician Roy Ayers. In the summer of 1999, Funkghost traveled to New York City and collaborated with Tampa Native Celph Titled who at the time was working as an in-house producer and A&R; for the now-defunct BUDS International and Bronx Science Records. They would go on to release Funkghost's 1st 12' single \\"Instructions\\" b/w \\"Tampa International\\". In 2000 Funkghost released his debut LP \\"Ultra Boogie Highlife\\". The LP was well received by critics but failed commercially. Only 20,000 copies were circulated. Ultra-Boogie Highlife is now considered a hard to find Cult Classic. The album cover for Ultra-Boogie Highlife features a young and (at the time unknown) Real World alumna Melissa Howard. In early 2009 he formed his own independent imprint \\"Grand Extravagant Entertainment\\" and released the single and video \\"The Way I Rock My Clothes\\" in February 2009. The song was produced by Symbolyc One \\"S1\\" who would go on to co- produce Kanye West's 2010 single \\"Power\\" a year later. \\"The Way I Rock My Clothes\\" was well received by critics and has since garnered mix show airplay on FM stations across the United States. On July 1, 2009, Funkghost released the single and video for \\"Vintage Futuristic\\". The song was produced by Australian hip hop producer M-Phazes. \\"Vintage Futuristic\\" spawned several remixes and again, was well received by critics. On April 19, 2010, Funkghost released the single and music video for \\"I'm Your DJ\\". The song was produced, written, arranged and performed by Funkghost. Although a critical success, \\"I'm Your DJ\\" was not a significant commercial success. On September 5, 2010, Funkghost teamed up with music video director Jason Colvin (who directed his \\"I'm Your DJ\\" Music Video) and released a short film to his song \\"As Long As You Rock\\". The song \\"As Long As You Rock\\" again was produced, written, arranged and performed by Funkghost. On October 31, 2014 Funkghost released his second full- length studio album entitled Caviar Taste.

He was a Member of the European Parliament (MEP) for South West England & Gibraltar. He was leader of the Conservatives in the European Parliament from 2014 to 2019. Life and history Educated at The King's School, Worcester, Fox studied law at Bristol Polytechnic before working for a year as an English assistant in France. He took his solicitors finals at Chester College of Law. After completing his articles, he qualified as a solicitor in 1994. Before being elected as an MEP, Fox worked for 15 years as a solicitor in Bristol, specialising in insurance litigation. He was a partner at Badhams Thompson and an associate at Morgan Cole. From 1998 to 2000 Fox was chairman of Bristol West Conservative Association. He stood as the Conservative candidate for Bath at the General Election in 2001. In 2002 he was elected as councillor for Westbury-on-Trym on Bristol City Council, a position he held for 8 years. He was appointed a Knight Bachelor in Theresa May's resignation honours on 10 September 2019. Fox lives in Bristol with his wife and two children. In the European Parliament Fox was first elected to the European Parliament in 2009 and was re-elected in 2014 before losing his seat in 2019. Fox served as Chief Whip of the European Conservative & Reformists Group (ECR) 2010-2014 before being elected Leader of the British Conservative Delegation in November 2014 ‚Äì a position he held until the end of his term. In his first mandate (2009-14) Fox served on the Economic & Monetary Affairs, Internal Market and Constitutional Affairs Committees. In his second mandate (2014-19) he served on the Industry, Research & Energy, Economic & Monetary Affairs, and the Constitutional Affairs Committees. He was the leading British campaigner in the ‚ÄòOne Seat Campaign‚Äô. This was a cross Party effort to scrap the expensive practice of the European Parliament moving from Brussels to Strasbourg every month. As part of this campaign he co-authored the Fox-Hafner report which received widespread support and changed the official position of the Parliament in favour of having a single seat in Brussels. This will require a change to the European Treaties the next time they are up for review. In 2011/12 Fox was rapporteur on Corporate Governance in Financial Institutions. In 2016 he was the shadow rapporteur for Energy Efficiency Labeling. In 2018 Fox was the rapporteur on the Crowdfunding Report. His final report in January 2019 was on the need for a Comprehensive European Industrial Policy on Artificial Intelligence and Robotics. During his time in Parliament Fox campaigned on numerous issues and helped steer legislation through the Parliament. * He supported efforts to encourage the development of new financial technologies such as block chain and fintech. * He was a vocal supporter on free trade, voting in favour of Trade Deals between the European Union and other bodies such as Canada, South Korea and Japan. * He opposed efforts to increase the European Union Budget believing that the EU needed to show fiscal responsibility rather than continually demand more money from Member States. * He argued against the gradual creep of European Union sovereignty, in particular he opposed efforts by the European Union to be granted ‚ÄòTax Setting Powers. * He has campaigned on numerous animal welfare causes such as against puppy smuggling and has supported the Dogs Trust UK as well as BirdLife Malta in its campaign against the hunting of migrating birds. He was Chairman of the European Parliament Innovation Group 2017‚Äì19. In the South West & Gibraltar Fox was active across the South West on a wide range of issues ‚Äì from farming and environmental to industrial and business. He supported the region's cider makers against attempts by the European Union to levy additional taxes on small scale cider producers. Similarly he supported residents in North Somerset against plans by the Environment Agency to move the sea defences a mile inland to create salt marshes and mudflats between Clevedon and Kewstoke. This would have led to the deliberate flooding of prime agricultural land. He opposed plans to build an offshore wind farm off the Jurassic Coast in Dorset on the grounds that it would have damaged the local tourist industry. The proposal was finally rejected by the UK Government. Fox was one of the most vocal opponents. He pushed for reform of the Common Fisheries Policy and supported efforts to help the region's fishing industry. In addition Fox regularly visited Gibraltar to meet with representatives of the Government, business community and the public. He was a firm believer in the right of Gibraltarians to determine their own future.

Active mainly in the 1930s he was greatly influenced by the works of Paul Nash and the Vorticism movement, experimenting with form and developing a style which was very much his own. Biography Whitehead was encouraged in art by teachers at school, and at the age of 15 joined Alfreton Art Club. However, on leaving school he joined the family haulage business, becoming a driver for the firm, which widened his horizons as he drove around the countryside. He also became the firm's bookkeeper, but lacking training for the task, he made errors, leading to an investigation in 1935 by the Inland Revenue. His mother blamed him, and banished him to the coal-house, where he lived for years. In the meantime he had started to paint, and through this began to mix with socially liberal people, through whom he became aware of the growing pacifist movement, to which he was attracted. In 1938 Whitehead visited London for the first time, to attend a Peace Pledge Union (PPU) rally at Friends' House, Euston Road. The following year he went to London again, to seek advice from the PPU about registering as a conscientious objector in the likely event of war. While there, he met Mrs Jan Gordon, art critic of The Observer, who illustrated her article in the newspaper with his paintings, describing his work as 'touched by genius'. Whitehead's pacifism was now confirmed, and in World War II he was registered by the Local Tribunal as a conscientious objector, conditional upon driving an ambulance in Derbyshire. He later regretted his decision not to \\"stand up to Fascism\\". This perceived lack of action and the rift with his mother, during which a number of his paintings were destroyed, conspired to frustrate his ambition to become a professional artist and perhaps prevented his being recognised in British Modernist art. After 1947 he never painted again. The majority of Whitehead's paintings were stored in the loft of the family home until shortly before his death,Early history , NormanWhitehead.com, accessed September 2009 when he attempted to catalogue them. In 1998 his widow donated his work (1933‚Äì1939), a few hundred paintings, to local museums.

The term \\"Pinkernidsq\\" derives from the Greek verb (epiker√°nnymi, \\"to mix [wine]\\"), and was used to denote the cup-bearer of the Byzantine emperor. In addition, descriptive terms such as (ho tou basile≈çs oinochoos, \\"the emperor's wine-pourer\\"), (archioinochoos, \\"chief wine- pourer\\"), Œ∫œÖŒªŒπŒ∫ŒπœÜœåœÅŒøœÇ (kylikiphoros, \\"bearer of the kylix\\"), and, particularly at the court of the Empire of Nicaea, (ho epi tou kerasmatos, \\"the one in charge of the drink\\") were often used instead. The position is attested already in the Klƒìtorologion of 899, where a pinkernƒìs of the emperor (, pinkernƒìs tou despotou) and of the Augusta (, pinkernƒìs tƒìs Augoustƒìs) are listed among the eunuchs of the palace staff. As the name suggests, the principal charge of the pinkernƒìs was the pouring of wine for the emperor; he accompanied the emperor, bearing a goblet suspended on a chain, which he gave to the emperor when the latter wanted to drink. His position at court was not very high, but he had an extensive staff, the œÄŒ±œÅŒøŒπŒΩŒøœáœåŒøŒπ (paroinochoi, \\"assistant wine-pourers\\"). The post was imitated in the staff of the Patriarch of Constantinople and in the households of great magnates. The spouse of a pinkernƒìs bore the feminine form of his title: pinkernissa (œÄŒπŒ≥Œ∫Œ≠œÅŒΩŒπœÉœÉŒ±). During the early Komnenian period, the post ceased to be restricted to eunuchs, and gradually became a title of distinction, even awarded to the Byzantine emperor's relatives. Several senior generals of the Palaiologan period, such as Michael Tarchaneiotes Glabas, Alexios Philanthropenos and Syrgiannes Palaiologos, were awarded the title. According to pseudo-Kodinos, in the 14th century, the pinkernƒìs had risen considerably, and occupied the 14th place in the palace hierarchy, between the pr≈çtosebastos and the kouropalatƒìs. According to Rodolphe Guilland, this rise to the highest ranks of the emperor's cup-bearer, along with the rise of the masters of the hunt (pr≈çtokynƒìgos) and of the falcons (pr≈çtoierakarios) is an indication that the Byzantine court of the time resembled more and more the chivalric mores of the Western feudal courts. At the same time, the pinkernigs also had assumed some of the responsibilities of the defunct position of the domestikos epi tƒìs trapezƒìs, having under his command some of the domestikoi of the domestikion, the household service. By the 15th century, however, it had apparently become a purely honorific charge, since holders of the post are attested being sent on missions to the provinces.

He plays the harmonica, sings, and is a street icon in New Orleans. Early life Growing up in the Lafitte Housing Projects, Small developed a love of music as a young boy, in part to deal with the pains of an unhappy home life. Small's uncle was a professional musician who worked with Lloyd Washington of the Ink Spots, and often let his nephew come to the Dew Drop Inn to hear them play. One day when his uncle left for work without his harmonica, Small picked it up and put it to his mouth. \\"Oooh, it was awful,\\" he said, laughing. \\"He chewed tobacco. I had to sterilize that thing.\\" The uncle gave young Elliott a harmonica, and he fell in love with the sound of the mouth harp, teaching himself by playing along with the music on his mama's radio. At home, Small's mother favored classical music, giving the youngster diverse tastes at an early age. Teaching himself to dance from watching Fred Astaire movies on television, Small began performing on street corners for change, dancing while singing and playing his harmonica. \\"They brought me to New York to tap on Broadway when I was 6 or 7, and my mama got killed up there,\\" he said. The man they lived with beat them both and ended up killing his mother. After it happened, his grandmother brought Small back to New Orleans and gave him and his older sister Frances a good life. \\"She was a sweet old lady,\\" he said. \\"My stepfather was a man who did not love his child,\\" he said. \\"But my uncle would come to the house, and play the harmonica to me.\\" Early career As a young man, Small then made the rounds as a soul singer in local clubs. He recorded singles with arranger Wardell Quezergue, some of which are available on Malaco and Tuff City Records compilations of New Orleans funk. In the early '60s, Small's family relocated to New York City, where he took his first steps as a professional entertainer. Small once again played on the streets in between regular gigs, which included a role in a stage revival of Show Boat, helped the Louisiana vocal group The Dixie Cups go up to New York, opened on tour with The Temptations, and cut a few of his own R&B; singles. One was entitled \\"I'm a Devil,\\" recorded for Bang! Records. and Small promoted the record with live appearances while wearing what some fans remember as a red devil's suit complete with horns and pitchfork. \\"Well, it wasn't called a devil suit,\\" he said. \\"It was a pretty, silk red suit, that looked good. It was a nice show.\\" At the time, Small remembers, he was billed as \\"The Harmonica King.\\" He also recorded his own \\"Girls Are Made for Lovin'\\" in 1969, a Wardell Quezergue (‚ÄúBig Q‚Äù) production which has the feel of something by Curtis Mayfield, maybe, or Smokey Robinson. It‚Äôs not an identifiably New Orleans record, although it was made there, originally released on the New Sound label and picked up by Bang. The song \\"E-Ni-Me-Ni-Mi-Ni-Mo\\" is a fine funk groove recorded at Sea-Saint Studio in New Orleans, probably in 1975. Small produced the session and co-wrote the song along with Quezergue and guitarist Teddy Royal. According to Rob Bowman's notes to the box set, The Last Soul Company, Small, who had recorded previously for Malaco when Quezergue was working there, brought the master tape to that Jackson, MS studio early in 1976, hoping they could find a company to release it. Instead, they purchased the master and released it themselves. However, nobody went for the funkified children's chant, no matter how danceable it was, and the song sank with hardly a ripple. By the '80s, Small had become dissatisfied with life in New York, the grueling schedule of performing in local clubs and on the road, and the music business in general. Bad decisions and unfair contracts had soured him on the industry. When the sight in his good eye started to go and everything got fuzzy, he signed away the rights to one of his songs. \\"It was to a guy I had taken a liking to, a guy I trusted,\\" he said. Small moved back to New Orleans and took his music to the streets, where it would belong only to him and to the passersby who heard it. Small developed the persona of Grandpa Elliott, an old man dressed in blue denim overalls, a bright red shirt, Santa beard, and a floppy hat who played blues harp and sang for the street traffic on his corner at Royal and Toulouse streets in the French Quarter, right where he started out. He often teams with guitarist Michael ‚ÄúStoney B‚Äù Stone and they have become an institution in New Orleans for the people who stop to listen to them and throw change in their bucket. His act was even written up in The New York Times in 1995. He arrives here most mornings by taxi and spends his days singing his soulful songs and playing his harmonica.

His listeners reward him with dollar bills and treasures, like the gold wedding band he wears on his finger. \\"A lot of people walk around with plastic now instead of cash, so they throw what they can,\\" he said. \\"Some of the rings I get out of my bucket even have diamonds on them.\\" Playing for Change Small did not completely lose his sight to glaucoma until 2005. It was in that year that recording engineer and producer Mark Johnson launched a project called Playing for Change, dedicated to promoting international unity through music. He began recording performances by street performers from around the world. Johnson heard Small sing the Ben E. King hit \\"Stand by Me\\" and immediately recorded him singing the tune on Royal Street, making his performance the centerpiece of a video featuring performances of the number by a handful of artists. In 2009, after the \\"Stand by Me\\" video was posted online, it racked up 142,506,330 plays on YouTube (21 March 2020), and suddenly Small had an international audience. Small signed on for a tour with a band of musicians affiliated with the Playing for Change project, He has also been on The Tonight Show and The Colbert Report. He performed to a crowd of more than 40,000 at Dodger Stadium, Los Angeles, California, on June 30, 2009, playing the \\"Star Spangled Banner\\" on harmonica and singing \\"God Bless America.\\" Later that same year, the Playing for Change Band came to New Orleans to accompany Small on his debut CD Sugar Sweet, released November 3, 2009, an eclectic collection that includes gospel, blues, soul and what Small calls \\"some strong love songs.\\" Keb Mo' also accompanied on the album. Small is the first artist to be signed to Playing for Change Records/Concord Music Group. The whole experience taught him to trust people again. \\"Mark Johnson changed my life,\\" he said. \\"He made me lift my head up.\\" Small has been featured on Playing for Change in several episodes.

They have also been called Additional Charge Labels and Added Charge Labels.Palmer, Lars. \\"Added Charge Labels\\" in Journal of Chinese Philately, Vol.56, No.2, December 2008, pp.20-25  Background  In China, local provincial governments collect and supply the postal services but the charges are set by the national government. Increasing inflation meant that by 1987 the amount charged for postal services was less than the cost of providing those services. Local governments therefore requested an increase in postal rates but this was refused by the national government. The local governments were allowed, however, to levy an additional charge on certain outgoing mail items to defray their costs and in January 1987 the first local postal surcharge label was used in Guangdong.  Use  The labels quickly became popular and, eventually, labels were issued in 25 different provinces. Around 1500 different labels are known. The rules set for their use were as follows: *The charges were to be created and collected locally. *The charges only applied to items that had already had postage applied above the lowest rate, e.g. parcels and registered letters. *The charges were not to apply on international mail. *The additional charge was to be noted on the item and the sender given a receipt. *The labels were not to resemble postage stamps. (In practice many did) Recording the extra charge was done in a variety of ways, including manuscript marks, postal chop marks, extra postage stamps and printed labels. Where printed labels were used they were of widely varying designs and could be of one, two or three parts to enable record keeping. Some were multi-coloured, perforated and similar to postage stamps like the label from Ankang shown above, others were crude productions in one colour similar to tickets or store receipts. Local governments and postal officials successfully seized the opportunity to raise additional funds. Hubei province, for instance, introduced a rule that from 1 January 1993 a charge be made to finance postal developmentStanley Gibbons Stamp Catalogue: Part 17, China, 7th edition, 2006, p.216. and a label was issued by a postmaster in Susong in support of China's bid for the 2000 Olympic Games. As time went on more stamp-like labels were produced and they were often banned by the central government within days of issue. Some may well have been purely philatelic issues with no genuine function. The use of the labels was never popular with the Chinese government and eventually it was banned completely in 1999.  Classification  The wide variety of the labels and their varying use mean that they defy easy philatelic classification. They are not strictly local stamps, although locally produced, and not stamps of the central government of China. The charge levied may be seen as a form of local tax on each letter originating in a particular province, in which case they fall into the category of fiscal or revenue stamps. Labels produced purely for philatelic purposes or outside of the rules are cinderella stamps.  Collecting  Philatelists prefer to collect these labels on cover as this gives the fullest information about the label and confirms genuine postal use. No definitive catalogue exists of all the labels used as the Chinese government initially suppressed their display at stamp exhibitions and it is likely that many items remain to be discovered and catalogued. Much of what has been published in this area is in Chinese. Collectors have used postcodes printed on the labels to indicate probable origins and as a method of classification.

W. L. C. Beaumont or ‚ÄúBuster\\" Beaumont, was the heir to the Seigneur of Sark, a Royal Air Force officer, film producer and the husband of actress Mary Lawson. He and Lawson were killed in 1941 during the Liverpool Blitz. Family background Francis William Lionel Collings Beaumont was born on 6 August 1903 at Lawshall in Suffolk. He was the second child of Dudley and Sibyl Beaumont, daughter of William Frederick Collings, who ruled the island of Sark as seigneur (feudal lord). Sark is a self-governing territory that is part of the Bailiwick of Guernsey, a British Crown Dependency in the English Channel off the coast of Normandy. The island has been called one of the last feudal outposts in Western Europe, a term used by Beaumont's mother to describe the island's political system. Beaumont was named after his grandfather, William Frederick Collings, the 20th Seigneur of Sark, but was often called by his nickname, Buster. On his father's side of the family, Beaumont descended from a line of notable British Army officers. His father served in France during the First World War and died in 1918 during the Spanish flu pandemic. His grandfather, William Spencer Beaumont, was a captain in the 14th King's Hussars cavalry regiment, while his great-great grandfather, John Thomas Barber Beaumont was a well known miniature painter who in 1803, during the Napoleonic Wars, raised The Duke of Cumberland's Sharp Shooters corps. In 1927, Beaumont's grandfather died and his mother inherited the fief. As the oldest son, Beaumont was the heir apparent to the seigneurship.  Education and early military career  Beaumont was educated at Elizabeth College, in St Peter Port, Guernsey. Beaumont's mother wanted her son to study at the Royal Air Force College at Cranwell, but she faced financial difficulties following her husband's death. She was forced to sell her farm on Sark and relocate to Guernsey and then Cologne, Germany in order to support her family. While still a cadet, Beaumont became an able pilot and participated in an RAF aerial show at Hendon. In December 1923 Beaumont graduated from Cranwell, was commissioned as a pilot officer on 19 December, and posted to No. 207 Squadron at Eastchurch; on 19 June 1925 he was promoted to flying officer. While serving Beaumont accumulated personal financial debts that threatened to end his career. His mother intervened with contacts in the RAF and pleaded for her son to be deployed abroad where he would be \\"away from the crowd of young irresponsibles he is running around with.\\" In November 1925 Beaumont was assigned to No. 45 Squadron in Iraq, where the British had established the Mandate of Mesopotamia. In 1928 Beaumont was assigned to the RAF depot at Uxbridge near London, and resigned his commission in the RAF on 3 October 1928.  Marriages  In 1924, while serving in the RAF, it was announced that Beaumont was engaged to Enid Corinne Ripley of Outwood, Surrey and in October 1926 the couple were married in London. In December 1927, Enid Beaumont gave birth to a son, John Michael Beaumont, who would become the 22nd Seigneur of Sark in 1974. Beaumont met his second wife, actress Mary Lawson, while producing the 1936 film Toilers of the Sea, a film adaption of Victor Hugo's 1866 novel Les Travailleurs de la mer. Hugo's book is set in Guernsey and Beaumont's mother writes in her 1961 autobiography that scenes from the film were shot on Sark and that her son provided backing for the film, along with French director/producer Jean Choux;Hathaway incorrectly writes that the film was shot in 1938. in the film credits the production company L. C. Beaumont is mentioned, but not Choux. At this time Beaumont was still married to his first wife. It is uncertain when the affair between Lawson and Beaumont began, but Beaumont's wife purchased an announcement in the 30 November 1937 edition of The Times asking for a \\"dissolution\\" of their marriage \\"on the ground of his adultery with Miss Mary Lawson.\\" That year the Beaumonts were divorced,Catalogue description for Document No. J 77/3752/4301. Divorce Court File: 4301. Appellant: Enid Corinne Beaumont. Respondent: Francis William Lionel C Beaumont. Type: Wife's petition for divorce [wd] 1937\\\\. The National Archives, Kew and on 22 June 1938 Beumont and Lawson were married in Chelsea. In her memoirs, Beaumont's mother makes no mention of her son's second wife, rather she praises his first wife as a \\"charming girl\\" Upon marriage Lawson legally changed her name to Mary Elizabeth Beaumont, but she continued to use Mary Lawson as her stage name.  Fascist connection and the Second World War  In 1937 Beaumont reportedly met with Oswald Mosley, founder of the British Union of Fascists, to discuss the opening of a private radio broadcast station on Sark. In the 1930s, the British Broadcasting Corporation had a government sanctioned monopoly in Britain on broadcasting television and radio and private commercial broadcasts funded by advertisers were illegal. Mosley wanted to challenge this monopoly in order to raise funds for his fledgling party by setting up broadcast stations outside of the BBC's jurisdiction. Mosley and Beaumont reportedly came to an agreement for a thirty-year lease to set up a Radio Sark broadcast station on the island.Amato quotes national archive document HO 283/11, which states that among the property seized following Mosley's arrest by the British government in 1940 was correspondence between Mosley and Beaumont dating from 1937. There have been claims that Beaumont was sympathetic to the Mosley's movement and that he and Mosley were amiable. Beaumont is also reported to have hidden the source of the funding of the radio station from his mother in order to obtain her approval. In addition, British government documents opened to the public in the 1990s reveal that Mosley sought funding from the German Nazi government for Radio Sark, though Beaumont is not implicated in these dealings. Despite his connections with British fascists, Beaumont promptly rejoined the RAF at the outset of the Second World War in 1939; he was recommissioned as a pilot officer on probation on 26 September, and on 1 June 1940 he was promoted to war substantive flying officer. He seems later to have been promoted flight lieutenant. He was assigned to the Administrative and Special Duties Branch, which includes the RAF's intelligence section. During the war the Channel Islands were occupied by German forces and contact was severed between Beaumont and his relatives on Sark, including his mother, who remained on the island for the duration of the war.  Death  In May 1941 Beaumont received a week's leave and he, Lawson, friends and family travelled to Liverpool, where they stayed at a hotel at 126 Smithdown Road in the Sefton Park district. On 1 May the German Luftwaffe began a bombing campaign on Liverpool that would last more than a week. On 4 May, as the warning sirens went off, family and friends at the hotel, including Lawson's sister Dorothy, took safety in a shelter, while Lawson and Beaumont stayed in their room. The hotel was destroyed, killing the couple, while all those who sought safety in the shelter survived. The death of Beaumont and Lawson was announced in newspapers around the globe, but news of Beaumont's death was slow to reach Sark because of the German occupation. Beaumont's elder sister, Amice, who was in England at the time, contacted the embassy of the United States of America, which had yet to enter the war, and ask them to convey the news of her brother's passing to German authorities. Beaumont's mother was notified of her son's death by the German Commandant in Guernsey, Colonel Rudolf Graf von Schmettow, who conveyed the news in a manner that she described as \\"gently as possible.\\" Beaumont and Lawson are buried in Kirkdale Cemetery, Liverpool. A memorial plaque with names of Beaumont and other former pupils of Elizabeth College that fell during the Second World War is located on the school grounds in Guernsey.

Development  In 1930 the LIIPS ( ‚Äì Leningrad institute for sail and communications engineers) formed a UK GVF ( ‚Äì training centre for civil air fleet), in turn the UK GVF formed the NIAI (Naoochno-Issledovatel'skiy Aero- Institoot ‚Äì scientific research aero-institute) which became the focus of several good design engineers who were given command of individual OKB (Osoboye Konstrooktorskoye Byuro ‚Äì personal design/construction bureau). One of the most prolific designers at NIAI was Grigorii Ivanovich Bakshayev, who was assigned the lead in the design of the LK two-seat sport aircraft in 1936. Constructed from welded steel truss fuselage and wooden wings, the low-wing LK had a fixed tail-wheel undercarriage, a tandem two-seat greenhouse cockpit, and was powered by a single M-11 radial engine. Innovations on the LK included relatively large end-plates on the wings and interceptor spoiler type roll controls extending over the top surface of the wings. The sole prototype LK was completed in July 1936, flight tests began in August 1936, and the LK also carried out a long-range flight to Moscow.  Variants  * LIG-8 ‚Äì The LIG-8 was derived from the LK with a re-stressed structure, a 300 hp (223.7 kW) MG-31 engine and a five-seat cabin.

They are the first members of Crocodylomorpha to possess many of the features that define later relatives. In 1988, Michael J. Benton and James M. Clark argued that all traditional names for well-known groups of animals should be restricted to their crown clades, that is, used only for natural groups comprising all living members of any given lineage. This posed a problem for the crocodilians, because the name Crocodylia, while used in various ways by various scientists, had always included not only living crocodilians but many of their extinct ancestors known only from the fossil record.Benton, M.J. and Clark, J.M. (1988). \\"Archosaur phylogeny and the relationships of the Crocodylia.\\" Pp. 295‚Äì338 in Benton, M.J. (ed.), The phylogeny and classification of the Tetrapods, volume 1. Oxford: Clarendon Press. Benton and Clark's solution to this issue was to restrict the name Crocodylia to the group containing modern alligators, crocodiles, and gharials, plus any extinct members of those specific families. The traditional group \\"Crocodylia\\" was replaced by the name Crocodyliformes, which included many of the extinct families that the new definition left out. Clark and Benton did not initially provide an exact definition for Crocodyliformes; but, in 2001, Paul Sereno and colleagues defined it as the clade including Protosuchus richardsoni and the Nile crocodile, plus all descendants of their common ancestor. Chris Brochu agreed with the assessment that Crocodylia as a name has never had stable contents, and that a series of clades larger than the crown group Crocodylia (including Crocodyliformes and the slightly more inclusive clade Crocodylomorpha) was a good solution. However, in a 2008 paper, Jeremy Martin and Benton reversed the previous opinion (co-authored by Benton) that Crocodylia should be restricted to the crown group, suggesting that Crocodyliformes should be considered a synonym of a more inclusive Crocodylia, and thus replaced. Brochu and colleagues rejected this proposal, arguing that the crown definition of Crocodylia is the standard meaning both within and beyond the crocodyliform systematics community.  Ecology  While all extant crocodilians are carnivorous, the ecological roles of Mesozoic crocodyliforms were more diverse, and included omnivory and herbivory. Herbivorous forms were present from the early Jurassic to the late Cretaceous and are thought to have evolved at least three times.  Fossil tracks  Tracks of a crocodyliform are known since Cretaceous, at least. Tracks representing the ichnofamily Batrachopodidae are described from the Early Cretaceous (late Aptian) Calonda Formation (Angola) by Mateus et al. (2017), who name a new ichnotaxon Angolaichnus adamanticus. Phylogeny Below is a simplified cladogram based on Fiorelli and Calvo (2007). In 2012, paleontologists Mario Bronzati, Felipe Chinaglia Montefeltro, and Max C. Langer conducted a broad phylogenetic analysis to produce supertrees of Crocodyliformes, including 184 species. The most parsimonious trees were highly resolved, meaning the phylogenetic relationships found in the analysis were highly likely.

The uncertainty principle also says that eliminating uncertainty about position maximises uncertainty about momentum, and eliminating uncertainty about momentum maximizes uncertainty about position. A probability distribution assigns probabilities to all possible values of position and momentum. Schr√∂dinger's wave equation gives wavefunction solutions, the squares of which are probabilities of where the electron might be, just as Heisenberg's probability distribution does. In the everyday world, it is natural and intuitive to think of every object being in its own eigenstate. This is another way of saying that every object appears to have a definite position, a definite momentum, a definite measured value, and a definite time of occurrence. However, the uncertainty principle says that it is impossible to measure the exact value for the momentum of a particle like an electron, given that its position has been determined at a given instant. Likewise, it is impossible to determine the exact location of that particle once its momentum has been measured at a particular instant. Therefore, it became necessary to formulate clearly the difference between the state of something that is uncertain in the way just described, such as an electron in a probability cloud, and the state of something having a definite value. When an object can definitely be \\"pinned down\\" in some respect, it is said to possess an eigenstate. As stated above, when the wavefunction collapses because the position of an electron has been determined, the electron's state becomes an \\"eigenstate of position\\", meaning that its position has a known value, an eigenvalue of the eigenstate of position. The word \\"eigenstate\\" is derived from the German/Dutch word \\"eigen\\", meaning \\"inherent\\" or \\"characteristic\\". An eigenstate is the measured state of some object possessing quantifiable characteristics such as position, momentum, etc. The state being measured and described must be observable (i.e. something such as position or momentum that can be experimentally measured either directly or indirectly), and must have a definite value, called an eigenvalue. (\\"Eigenvalue\\" also refers to a mathematical property of square matrices, a usage pioneered by the mathematician David Hilbert in 1904. Some such matrices are called self-adjoint operators, and represent observables in quantum mechanicsQuantum Mechanics: A graduate level course, 20 Feb 2010)  See also  * Superposition principle * List of textbooks on classical and quantum mechanics  References  Related reading: * For wave mechanics ** ","title":"Introduction to eigenstates"},{"id":"23145206","text":"Andrea Elliott is an American journalist and a staff writer for The New York Times.

Elliott is also the recipient of the George Polk Award, the Scripps Howard Award, the David Aronson Award and prizes by the Overseas Press Club, the American Society of Newspaper Editors, the Society of Professional Journalists and the New York Press Club. Her work has been featured in the collections ‚ÄúBest Newspaper Writing‚Äù and ‚ÄúIslam for Journalists: A Primer on Covering Muslim American Communities in America.‚Äù In May 2014, Elliott received an honorary doctorate from Niagara University, which cited her ‚Äúcourage, perseverance, and a commitment to fairness for those without a public voice rarely demonstrated among writers today.‚Äù In May 2015, Elliott was awarded Columbia University's Medal for Excellence, awarded to one alumna under 45 every year. In 2018, Elliott received a Whiting Creative Nonfiction Grant to complete her book Invisible Child.

As a player, Snyder never reached the Major Leagues, peaking at the Triple-A level in 1963 with the Denver Bears of the Pacific Coast League ‚Äî a season which also saw his debut as a minor league manager in the Braves' farm system. Snyder, however, was a strong hitter in his playing days, compiling a lifetime batting average of .318 during his seven-year active career.

Significance In a country with only one television channel, T√°ncdalfesztiv√°l was the premier chance for young musicians to showcase their skills and become well known in the Hungary of the '60s. It was the starting point in the career of the era's most popular performers, like Kati Kov√°cs, P√°l Sz√©csi, Kl√°ri Katona or Zsuzsa Koncz. As television sets were just becoming widespread, it also meant a good opportunity to musicians already popular from the radio, but never seen performing live. Performers who gained fame through the show include √âva Mikes, M√°ria Toldy, Katalin S√°rosi, J√°nos Ko√≥s, and L√°szl√≥ Aradszky. According to J√°nos Br√≥dy, the T√°ncdalfesztiv√°l series played a key role in the renewal of the contemporary Hungarian music scene, which spread beyond national borders. The TV show had similar, equally successful radio counterparts called Tess√©k V√°lasztani and Made in Hungary.

The recorded history of Jhelum (), a district of modern-day Pakistan, covers thousands of years. Since its creation, Persian, Greek, Hindu, Buddhist, Muslim, Sikh, and British dominates the influences to present-day Pakistan. Jhelum is near the site of the famous Battle of the Hydaspes between the armies of Alexander the Great and Raja Porus. This battle took place a few miles downstream from the city centre, along the river banks. The city was founded to commemorate the death of Alexander's horse, Bucephalus, and was originally called Bucephala. Nearby there is also the historic 16th-century Rohtas Fort, another historic fort since Sikh era located at the backside of the main bus stand near Railway Phatak Jhelum City. It is now being used as stores under Railway Authorities and also Tilla Jogian; a centuries-long history of the area. Early history The history of the district dates back to the semi-mythical period of the Mahabharata. Hindu tradition represents the Salt Range as the refuge of the five Pandava brethren during their exile. Every salient point in its scenery is connected with some legend of the national heroes. Modern research has fixed the site of the conflict between Alexander and Porus as within Jhelum district. However, the exact spot at which the Macedonian king affected the passage of the Jhelum (or Hydespes) was hotly disputed. Greek period Ancient graveyard of Alexander's period. Alexander moved from ancient Taxila of Raja Ambhi, whom he subdued without a fight, to Kalar Kahar. He moved over the Salt Range, turning left, along the western bank of River Jhelum, which he called Hydaspes. Opposite him on the other bank was a Raja Porus. They fought one of the biggest and most fierce battles of Alexander's whole campaign, which eventually Alexander won, after using a surprise move against the valiant Porus but with great difficulty and a heavy loss of life on Alexander's side too. Before moving further, Alexander established a village on the west bank of the River and ordered the construction of 2000 boats. Greek Admiral Nearches was to arrange wood from nearby higher hills, which would be floated down the River and hauled up at this point. He called this village as Boucephila (present-day Jhelum City). The Jhelum River passes vying with the residential areas of the city. The mosque inside the river is a famous landmark most commuters on the Grand Trunk Road even today. Alexander's Naval Chief was assigned the task of boats building on a very large scale. Therefore, the craftsmen were gathered, hence the modern colonies in the city named as Machine Mohallahs (Number 1, 2 and 3), because of the saw mills. Jhelum became timber market for the whole of Punjab over the millenniums. It was only after the construction of Mangla Dam that log wood does not float down the river, and the city has lost this privilege. There is a plywood factory also, which is flourishing. Greeks left marks of their chivalry and martial spirit, which mixed up well with the races and clans dwelling in the area.Greek era of Jhelum Early Muslim period In 997 CE, Sultan Mahmud Ghaznavi, took over the Ghaznavid dynasty empire established by his father, Sultan Sebuktegin, In 1005 he conquered the Shahis in Kabul in 1005, and followed it by the conquests of Punjab region in including the Jhelum District. The Delhi Sultanate and later Mughal Empire ruled the region. The Punjab region became predominantly Muslim due to missionary Sufi saints whose dargahs dot the landscape of Punjab region. The Janjuas and Khokhars, who now hold the Salt Range and its northern plateau respectively, appear to have been the earliest inhabitants.Jhelum District Imperial Gazetteer of India, v. 14, p. 152 The Gakhars, who appear to represent an early wave of conquest from the west, and who still inhabit a large tract in the east of the District; while the Awans, who now cluster in the western plain, are apparently later invaders, the Gakhars were the dominant race during the early Muslim era and they long continued to retain their independence, both in Jhelum itself and in the neighbouring District of Rawalpindi. Sikh era A Fort in Jhelum City, built during Sikh era. In 1765 Gujar Singh defeated the last independent Gakhars Chief, Muqarrrab Khan, and reduced the wild mountaineers of the Salt Range and the Murree Hills to subjection. After the decline of the Mughal Empire, the Sikh invaded and occupied Multan District. The Muslims faced severe restrictions during the Sikh rule. Gujar Singh's son succeeded to his dominions until 1810, when it fell to Ranjit Singh. Under the Lahore government the dominant classes of Jhelum suffered much from fiscal actions; and the Janjua, Gakhar and Awan families who had a feudal and aristocratic influence in the area, gradually lost their landed estates, which passed into the hands of their Jat dependents. British era In 1847 Jhelum passed with the rest of the Sikh territories into the power of the British.In 1857 the 14th Native Infantry stationed at Jhelum town mutinied, and made a vigorous defence against a force sent from Rawalpindi to disarm them, but decamped on the night following the action, the main body. Being subsequently arrested by the Kashmir authorities, into whose territory they had escaped. British established administration at district level and Jhelum District, which originally was covering large area including Pindigheb and territory up to Indus river, was delimited later to include tehsils of Jhelum, Chakwal and Pind Dadan Khan, with District Headquarters shifting from Pind Dadan Khan to Jhelum. During the 20th Century, this city has a proud history of chivalry and achievements.http://pakistaniat.com/2007/02/24/pakistan-jehlum-alexander- taxila-hydaspes-porus-boucephila/ During British rule, Jhelum was a district of Rawalpindi Division, and was larger than the current district of Jhelum. On April 1, 1914, the tehsil of Talagang was detached from the District and incorporated with the new District of Attock. The old Jhelum district (minus Talagang) covered an area of 2,813 square miles (7285 km2) and included Chakwal tehsil - it was bounded by Shahpur and Attock to the west, and by Rawalpindi to the north - the Jhelum River separated it from Kashmir to the north-east and from Gujrat and Shahpur to the south-east and south. During British rule, Jhelum was connected by the North-Western Railway to other cities in the Indian empire, 1,367 miles from Calcutta, 1,413 from Bombay, and 849 from Karachi. The population according to the 1901 census of India was 14,951.Imperial Gazetteer of India, v. 14, p. 159-160 According to the Imperial Gazetteer of India: :\\"The present town is of modern origin, the old town, which may have been the Bucephala of Alexander having been, on the left or opposite bank of the river. Under Sikh rule the place was quite unimportant, being mainly occupied by a settlement of boatmen, and at the time of annexation contained about 500 houses. It was then chosen as the site of a cantonment and as the headquarters of the civil administration. For some years it was the seat of the Commissioner of the Division, but in 1859 his headquarters were transferred to Rawalpindi. Under British rule Jhelum has steadily advanced in prosperity; and it is the entrep√¥t for most of the trade of the District, though, since the completion of the Sind-SƒÅgar branch of the North-Western Railway; the salt trade no longer passes through it. It is an important timber d√©p√¥t, the timber from the Kashmir forests which is floated down the river being collected here. A good deal of boat-building is carried on. The cantonment, which is 3 miles from the civil station, contains the church and post office. The normal strength of the garrison is one Native cavalry and four Native infantry regiments. The municipality was founded 1867. During the ten years ending 1902-3 the receipts averaged Rs. 32,100, and the expenditure Rs, 31,900. Receipts and expenditure from cantonment funds in the same period averaged Rs. 31,900 and Rs. 6,100 respectively. The chief income of the municipality in 1903-4 was Rs. 34,200 chiefly from octroi; and the expenditure was Rs. 41,000. The town has two Anglo vernacular schools, a municipal high school, and a middle school maintained by the American Presbyterian Mission.

During the Indian Rebellion of 1857, also known as the Indian Mutiny, 35 British soldiers of the Regular 24th Regiment of Foot were killed at the Battle of Jhelum by mutineers from the Honourable East India Companies 14th Bengal Native Infantry (roughly 500 of the soldiers mutinied with roughly 100 of the Sikh soldiers remaining loyal). Among the dead was Captain Francis Spring, the eldest son of Colonel William Spring.The London Gazette, 19 May 1858 http://www.london- gazette.co.uk/issues/22141/pages/2492/page.pdf A lectern inside St. John's Church Jhelum shows the names of those 35 soldiers. St. John's Church is located in the Jhelum Cantonment, Pakistan beside the river Jhelum. It was built in 1860 and remains a landmark in the city. It was built as a Protestant church, and was in use throughout the British period. For the past forty years it has been closed to the public and in poor condition, however it has since been renovated and reopened and is now maintained. The British soldier William Connolly won a Victoria Cross for his bravery during this battle. Mirza Dildar Baig, also known as Khaki Shah, took part in the mutiny at Jhelum and was later celebrated by Indian Nationalists. He was captured and arrested with the remaining mutineers by authorities in Kashmir and later hanged near the river Jhelum. His grave is in a shrine in Jhelum Dildarnagar, and a small town in Uttar Pradesh is also named after him. The railway bridge on the river Jhelum was built in 1873 by the British engineer William St. John Galwey. He also made the great Empress Bridge over the river Sutlej. Independence The predominantly Muslim population supported both the Muslim League and the Pakistan Movement. After the independence of Pakistan and partition from India in 1947, the minority Hindus and Sikhs were displaced to India while the Muslim refugees from India settled in the Jhelum District. Military history Jhelum has long been a key recruiting ground for the Armed Forces and has a history of providing many soldiers in particular. It has sent men to serve first in the Honourable East India Company Army then the British Army and, more recently, to the Pakistan Armed Forces. As a result, it is known locally as the city of soldiers or land of martyrs and warriors.BBC NEWS - City of Soldiers During the First World War, Jhelum was notable for providing a significant number of recruits to the Indian Expeditionary Force and, as a result, became a strong source of recruits for the British Indian Army right up to independence. The first Victoria Cross to be awarded to a son of Jhelum (the highest Imperial, British and Commonwealth award for gallantry) was earned by Subedar Khuda Dad Khan during the First World War whilst fighting in Belgium. Later another son of Jhelum was to be awarded its equivalent; the Nishan-e-Haider of Pakistan. Major Muhammad Akram (Shaheed) received his award posthumously for his actions during the Indo-Pakistani War of 1971. It is of note that when Pakistan declared independence in 1947, three out the four senior major generals of the new Pakistan Army were from Jhelum: Major General Muhammad Akbar, Major General Nazir Ahmed and Major General Muhammad Iftekhar. Other senior Pakistani military officers of note, who have originated from Jhelum, are; Air Commodore Muhammad Khan Janjua, General Asif Nawaz Janjua and Admiral Tariq Kamal Khan. Colonel Muhammad Khan, the author of Bajang Amad and Bazam Araian, also came from Jhelum. Soldiers, Sailors and Airmen from Jhelum have distinguished themselves in combat from the time of the British Raj through the World Wars and the more recent conflicts with India. As a result several have won gallantry awards and accolades.Jhelum history Etymology Anjum Sultan Shahbaz records some stories of the name Jhelum in his book Tareekh-e-Jhelum as:Tareekh-e-Jhelum, page 92 by Anjum Sultan Shahbaz ()  References  Category:Jhelum Category:History of Punjab, Pakistan ","title":"History of Jhelum"},{"id":"23145282","text":"Housing protest on Rothschild Boulevard, Tel Aviv, 2011 Homelessness in Israel is a phenomenon that mostly developed after the mid-1980s. Homelessness increased following the wave of Soviet immigration in 1991. As many as 70 percent of homeless people in Tel Aviv are immigrants from the former Soviet Union, nearly all of them men. According to homeless shelter founder Gilad Harish, \\"when the recession hit Israel in the early 90s, the principle of 'last in, first out' kicked in, and many Russian immigrants lost their jobs. Being new to the country, they didn't have a strong family support system to fall back on like other Israelis do. Some ended up on the street with nowhere to go.\\"Israeli cultural critic takes homeless problem into his own hands The number of homeless people in Israel grew in the 2000s, and the Association for Civil Rights in Israel claimed that the authorities were ignoring the issue. Some 2,000 families in Israel lose their homes every year after defaulting on their mortgage loans. However, a law amendment passed in 2009 protects the rights of mortgage debtors and ensures that they are not evicted after failing to meet mortgage payments. The amendment is part of a wider reform in the law in the wake of a lengthy battle by the Association for Civil Rights in Israel and other human rights groups. Mortgage debtors will not remain homeless In 2007, the number of homeless youth was on the rise. More than 25% of all homeless youth in 2007 were girls, compared to 15% in 2004. A report by Elem, a non-profit organization that helps youth at risk, pointed to a 5% rise in the number of youths either homeless or wandering the streets late at night while their parents worked or due to strained relations at home. The organization estimated that in 2007 it provided programs or temporary shelter to roughly 32,000 youths in some 30 locations countrywide.Number of homeless female teenagers soar In 2014, the number of homeless individuals in Israel was estimated at 1,831, about 600 of whom were living on the streets of Tel Aviv.http://www.molsa.gov.il/CommunityInfo/ResearchAndEvaluation/tb_ResearchesAndPublications/2015%20-◊ì◊ï◊ó%20◊°◊ï◊§◊ô%20◊û◊ô◊§◊ï◊ô%20◊ì◊®◊ô%20◊®◊ó◊ï◊ë.pdf, p. 97 This makes up 0.02% of the country's population, a low figure compared to other developed nations. In July 2015, the Welfare Ministry estimated the number of homeless to be between 800 and 900, including 450 receiving services and treatment from their municipalities but continuing to live on the streets. Elem claimed the true figure was much higher. In December 2015, a large study by the Welfare Ministry found that 2,300 people in Israel were homeless.http://www.jpost.com/Israel-News/Over-800-homeless-people-living-in- Israel-410396http://www.jpost.com/Israel-News/Study-2300-homeless-in-Israel- half-from-former-USSR-436588 Homeless people in Israel are entitled to a monthly government stipend of NIS 1,000.

In the 1920s and 1930s, the Domaine d'Orv√®s, his house at La Valette-du-Var, was a gathering place for French artists who worked along the C√¥te d'Azur and in Provence.  Youth and Education  Pierre Jean Charles Deval was born August 20, 1897 in Lyon, the third child of a silk merchant, Gustave Deval (1853‚Äì1943). Pierre was of fragile health, and his parents took him frequently to the countryside or beach resorts for rest and a change of air, or to Paris to visit the galleries of the Luxembourg Palace and the Louvre. He also frequented the musee Saint Pierre in Lyon, where he was deeply impressed by the drawings and sculpture of Auguste Rodin, and visited the Institute of Archeology, where he saw the reproductions of Greco-Latin statues and developed a passion for Greek and Roman myths, which was to play a large part in his later work. In 1914, at the beach at LeBaule, he became friends with Rene Chomette, who became famous much later as a film director under the pseudonym of Ren√© Clair. The two boys began a long friendship and corresponded frequently about their discoveries in art. At the age of 14, Deval was particularly impressed by the exoticism of the colors, sets and costumes of the Ballets Russes, which visited Lyon.  Career as an artist  He began to study art seriously in Paris as student of painter √âmile-Ren√© M√©nard and Lucien Simon. Deval had his first show of drawings, portraits of young women, at the Lyon salon of 1918. In 1921, he became a friend of the French surrealist poet Jacques Rigaut, who introduced him into the circle of the Dadaism, and of Tristan Tzara, and writers Andr√© Breton and Louis Aragon. He briefly edited an artistic review in Lyon between February 1921 and June 1922. At the 1921 Salon d‚ÄôAutomne in Paris he had his first success with the painting Ariane, a realistic painting of the back of a woman lying on her side, looking at a cityscape, which was purchased by the French Government for the Musee Luxembourg, and hung in the Jeu de Pomme. Other painters in the salon that year included Henri Matisse, Claude Monet, Pierre Bonnard, Paul Gauguin, Roussel and Cross. In the autumn of 1922, the success of his painting Ariadne earned him a two-year fellowship at the Villa Abd-el-Tif in Algiers, a residence for painters. He was 25. He had become disenchanted with the Dada group and began looking for a new style of his own. In Algeria he encountered fauvist Albert Marquet, twenty-two years older, and became a friend of that painter. He also met his future wife, Henriette Bergerat, in February 1923, and they lived together in the villa. His paintings ranged from landscapes of Algiers and scenes of Algerian women preparing to bathe and dressing, to ventures in modernism. In 1924 he was selected to participate in the Venice Biennale, with a group of French artists that included Albert Marquet, Pierre Bonnard, and Maurice Denis. His works of this period featured exotic scenes from Algeria, and odalisques, as well as cityscapes of Algiers. His modernist paintings and drawings of blacks and whites together were condemned by traditional critics as too radical, while his other paintings were condemned by modernist critics as too traditional.Michele Gorrenc, pg. 78 When his fellowship ended he returned to Paris and moved into the studio at 19 quai St. Michel which Matisse had just vacated. He experimented with different styles, and in 1926 he painted five watercolors of modern Parisian life for a book L‚Äôecole des indifferents‚Äô by Jean Giraudoux. He worked as an illustrator for several journals, and showed his work in Paris galleries.  Deval in Provence In 1925 he decided to move to the South of France, and purchased a 17th-century bastide at Valette-du-Gard, near Hyeres. He installed his studio on the first floor and painted murals of mythological scenes on the walls of the dining room and entry hall. He welcomed to his house other artists who had moved to Provence, including writer and poet Henri Bosco, and the painters Raoul Dufy, Marquet, Jean Puy and Willy Eisenschitz. In the years that followed he painted realistic scenes of Marseille and Toulon, and sensitive paintings of women, children and families. He took part in a show in Marseille in 1933 on Provence seen by painters. During World War II, he saw his home occupied by a German artillery unit, who cut down most of the trees to have a clear view for their guns. He was finally able to return to his house in 1944. After the war he ran into trouble with the French Communist Party, who dominated the Paris art world, when he did not sign a petition opposing the re-armament of Germany, saying that he was an artist and he preferred to sign only paintings. Thereafter he showed his work mostly at galleries in Provence.see Michele Gorenc for his letter about the event He died at his house in LaVallet-du-Var in 1993, little known by the public, but respected by his fellow artists in Provence.

The building is a part of the Brownington Village Historic District, a district of ten historic buildings added to the National Register of Historic Places in 1973. History The Old Stone House, or Athenian Hall, was built in 1836 by Alexander Twilight, the nation's first African-American college graduate.Old Stone House Museum, Brownington, Vermont. Orleans County Historical Society, Inc. (1996). Twilight was the minister of the Brownington Congregational Church and the principal of the Orleans County Grammar School. The Orleans County Grammar School was the only high school in the county which required many students to travel long distances for their education. They boarded with families in town, including Twilight's. Athenian Hall was built to accommodate the larger number of students attending the Grammar School. Twilight pressed his board of trustees for a larger building but failed to receive support from the majority. He alienated many of the trustees by his adamancy, and the building was left completely to Twilight.Ferrin, Rev. C. E.. \\"Rev. Alexander L. Twilight.\\" Vermont Historical Gazetteer; ed. Abby M. Hemenway. III(1877): 100-104 In 1834, he laid out a foundation plan for land donated by Cyrus Eaton across the road from his house. It called for a four- story granite building measuring . Over the following two years the present stone house was erected following the lines and general appearance of a similar building, quite possibly Painter Hall at Middlebury College; however, detailed information is not available on how the granite structure was built. View from the side Twilight began building in 1834 and finished two years later. From 1836 to 1859, the building was used as a dormitory for school children, boys and girls. Due to diminishing school enrollment Athenian Hall was closed for good in 1859. For a brief time Mercy Ladd Merrill Twilight continued to live there with a few boarders.Ferrin, Rev. C. E.. \\"Rev. Alexander L. Twilight.\\" Vermont Historical Gazetteer; ed. Abby M. Hemenway. III(1877): 104 She then continued alone until she moved to Derby in 1865. When she died in 1878 she was buried next to her husband in Brownington. The building stayed vacant until in 1918 when the Stone House was put up for auction. A representative of the railroad in the state of Vermont bid on the structure with the hopes of using the granite stones for bridge abutments. The Orleans County Historical Society bid at the price of $500 (the equivalent of $ in current dollars) and won the auction. The building was opened as a museum in 1925. The attached barn was torn down in the 1920s. The building has four floors with twenty-two rooms of exhibits. It is dedicated to the history of the last two centuries in Orleans County, Vermont, and to the life of Alexander Twilight, the first African-American college graduate in the U.S. and state legislator.http://www.oldstonehousemuseum.org Old Stone House Museum. 2009-06-08.

Sikh festivals are largely focused on the lives of the Sikh gurus and Sikh martyrs. Their martyrdoms are regarded as instructional ideals for Sikhs, and have greatly influenced Sikh culture and practices. The Fifth Guru, Guru Arjan Dev, is generally regarded as the first Sikh martyr. Martyrdom Martyrdom is a fundamental institution of the Sikh faith. When one calls an individual a shahid, this connotes more than its definition in Arabic vocabulary or Islamic faith, which is death in battle with the infidels. For the Sikh, the perfect martyr or shahid is one who died not just in battle but also one who suffered death by refusing to renounce his faith, tenets and principles.Kohli, p. 54. The Sikh experience through the years gave rise to this type of ideal martyrdom. Bhai Taru Popat was the first Sikh at the time of Guru Nanak Dev (1469-1539). Bhai spoke against Babur, the Mughal emperor and he was set on fire by soldiers of Babur. The martyrdom of Guru Arjan in the 17th century is regarded as a key moment in Sikh tradition which has influenced Sikh practices and beliefs, helping define a deliberately-separate and militant Sikh community. The later martyrdom of Guru Tegh Bahadur, who refused to convert to Islam in an effort to protect Hindu religious practice, is credited with making respect for freedom of conscience a key part of Sikh identity. The emperor tried to convert Guru Teg Bahadur to Islam hoping that it would be easier to convert his followers if he relented. The guru was executed because he refused. Experts stated that these events galvanized the concept of Sikh martyrdom in the sense that Guru Arjan's death brought the Sikh Panth together while Guru Teg Bahadur's execution finally gave Sikh martydom its identity. Guru Teg Bahadur's death provided the impetus for his son, the tenth Guru Gobind Singh, to impose an outward form of Sikh identity as well as pride in his father's martyrdom.Singh & Fenech, p. 237. To avoid fear and demoralization, he instituted a new Sikh order called Khalsa founded on discipline and loyalty, and martyrdom became one of its foundations. Succeeding Gurus built on this new orientation, establishing a strong, self-governing warrior group.

He is known as editor of three large newspapers Adresseavisen, Verdens Gang and Aftenposten, and has also held other positions in the Schibsted media conglomerate. Early life He was born in B√¶rum as a son of newspaper editor Realph Norland (1903‚Äì1963) and pharmaceut Aasta Sigrun S√¶ther (1903‚Äì1968). Following miscellaneous education, he was hired in T√∏nsbergs Blad in 1958, where his father was editor-in-chief. In September 1959 he married journalist Sonja Hammer.

Later career After ten years in Aftenposten, and then one year as a subeditor in Verdens Gang from 1973 to 1974, he was hired as editor-in-chief of Adresseavisen. The newspaper had two chief editors at the time, and his co-editor was Fridtjof √Öldstedt. In 1977 he was headhunted to become a new chief editor in Verdens Gang as well as board member of Schibsted. Norland took over for Vegard Sletten, and his co-editor Tim Greve succeeded long-time editor Oskar Hasselknippe. In 1981 Verdens Gang surpassed Aftenposten to become Norway's largest newspaper. In 1987, Norland left to become editor of the new Schibsted-owned newspaper Osloavisen. Einar Hanseid took over Verdens Gang; from now there was only one chief editor. Reportedly, the idea of a local newspaper in Oslo came from Hanseid. However, Osloavisen was perceived by its owners as a failed venture and was discontinued after less than one year. Norland was brought back to Aftenposten where he succeeded Egil Sundar as editor-in-chief. Norland stepped down in 1993, but worked as an advisor from 1994.

Bentley Senior High School, also referred to as Bentley High School, was a public high school in the city of Livonia, Michigan, a western suburb of Detroit. The first public high school in the Livonia Public Schools district, it was open from September 1947 through June 1985. The school's first graduating class in June 1950 had 95 students. The school closed because of low enrollment. History =Beginnings= Before the school was built, high school students in the district attended either Redford Union High School in Redford Township or Plymouth High School in nearby Plymouth. Because the city was growing, the decision was made in 1945 to build a high school in the city. Most in the community wanted to call the school Livonia High School, but it was eventually named after George N. Bentley, a former student at Elm Elementary School in the district and a school board member at the time of the school's groundbreaking in 1946. The original two-story building also housed seventh and eighth graders during the first few years of operation. As the population of Livonia grew during the 1950s, the school required expansion. During the 1950s, two wings, a gymnasium, auto shop area, pool, auditorium and multi-purpose room were added to the school. =1960s= Because of continued growth in the district (approximately 2,500 students per year district-wide), ground was broken for a second high school named Franklin High School, which opened in the 1962-63 school year. During the 1961‚Äì62 school year, over 600 Franklin High School sophomores shared Bentley High School with the school operating on a dual schedule: Franklin teachers and students began classes later than the Bentley students. During the 1960s, the school underwent additional expansion as another wing, a library, addition to the cafeteria, music rooms, and home economics classrooms were added. In the later part of the sixties Bentley also shared a late schedule with the 1st graduating class of Adlai E. Stevenson High School while it was being built. =1970s and 1980s= The 1970s started with strong and steady enrollment, peaking during the 1974‚Äì75 school year (the school district itself actually peaked in enrollment during the 1970‚Äì71 school year). As the decade progressed and the Detroit economy experienced a downturn, the school and district were losing students rapidly. By the early 1980s the district had lost 51% of its peak enrollment. A freshman class was added to Bentley High School for the 1979‚Äì80 school year, the first ninth grade class in over 20 years. Faced with operating four public high schools and shrinking enrollment, the Board decided to close a high school. Bentley was the obvious choice as it was the oldest facility, its operational costs were the highest, and major renovations were needed for the entire building. The decision to close the school was announced in May 1983 and the school finally closed with the graduation of its final class in June 1985. All remaining underclassmen were distributed among the other three public high schools based on residential proximity to each school. After closure Livonia Community Recreation Center After the school closed, the building and facilities were used for adult education, youth sports, and community groups. Most of the building was demolished in 1998, removing roughly 70% of the structure. The remainder was still used for adult education until the rest of the school was demolished in 2001. The Livonia Recreation Center, which was built on the site, opened its doors in 2003. A senior lounge in the new building is dedicated to preserving the memory of Bentley High School. Keepsakes in the room include pictures of the school, the midcourt of the former gymnasium floor and composite photos of all graduating classes of Bentley High School. The Bentley track and field was also preserved for use by Livonia sports teams, as was the baseball diamond, which was last used by Madonna University but currently sits idle.

This approach to agricultural innovation is used in international development and rural community development for improving adoption of appropriate technology and the development of sustainable agriculture. The approach involves collaboration and joint decision-making among extension agents, farmers and researchers to develop locally acceptable farming practices and accelerate their adoption. Farmer Research Committees also produce a broad set of benefits that are generally referred to as empowerment,including the increased self-esteem and effectiveness of farmers to organise and negotiate with extension service and agricultural input providers, market chain actors, banks and politicians. Farmer Research Committees do adaptive research experiments to help farmers manage the risk of trying something new that extension has not validated under local conditions. In Latin America, numerous Farmer Research Committees have been particularly effective in evaluating and selecting new varieties and multiplying seed, enabling large numbers of farmers to access a new variety at low cost, improve their food security, generate employment and increase their income. On a lesser scale, Farmer Research Committees have worked on small machinery, fertilisers or pest and disease control regimes, enabling the adoption of cost-effective strategies in which local farmers have confidence. Farmer Research Committees may have an important role to play in rural communities' adaptation of their agriculture to climate change and globalization because they increase community-level innovative and adaptive capacity by strengthening its human and social capital. In contrast to Farmer Field Schools which are intended to transmit proven extension recommendations to farmers using experimentation for discovery learning, Farmer Research Committees set out to generate new recommendations. Their results are usually a novel blend of what was already known and what was unknown, drawing on both indigenous technical knowledge and external resources. Farmer research committees and farmer field schools can be highly complementary, as is discussed in more detail below  Costs  Most of the costs of establishing a Farmer Research Committee are a one-off investment incurred during the first year for training and a petty cash or inputs fund for operations. * Training of a facilitator, who may be a salaried extension professional or a para- professional farmer, involves a 5-day, on-site course and then follow-up visits by trainers to reinforce field practice. In Latin America, trainers use cellphones and the internet to mentor trainees. Numerous professionals experienced in Farmer Research Committee training exist in Latin America.For further information see Andean Change Program (Cambio Andino) Directory of Trainers http://www.cambioandino.org/directoriocapacitadores.shtml * Training a Farmer Research Committee involves learning by doing: in the first planting season (usually 4‚Äì6 months in the tropics), the facilitator mentors the Committee through a six step process. In the second season, the majority of steps in the process are delegated to the committee, the facilitator's visits are reduced significantly and costs drop by as much as 50 percent. By the third planting system, a Committee is mature and can run its own process with minimal contact with a facilitator.Ashby, J.A., Gracia, A.T., Del Pilar Guerrero, M., Quiros, C.A., Roa, J.I. and Beltran, J.A. 1995. Institutionalizing farmer participation in adaptive technology testing with the ‚ÄúCIAL.‚Äù ODI Agricultural Research and Extension Network. Network Paper 57. Some mature Committees in Latin America have been running their own process in this way for over 5 years.J. A. Ashby, A. Braun, T. Gracia, M.P. Guerrero, L.A. Hernandez, C.A. Quiros & J.I. Roa. 2001.Investing in Farmers as Researchers: Experience with Local Agricultural Research Committees in Latin America. CIAT, Cali, Colombia. * In Latin America the start-up fund for Committee operations can range from US$25 to US$200 in cash or kind, depending on the costs of experimental inputs not available locally.Ashby et al., 1995; World Bank Agriculture Investment Sourcebook. Module 2 - Local Agricultural Research Committees The average yearly cost for running a Committee was estimated at US$325 over six years in the late 1990s.A. R. Braun, G. Thiele and M. Fernandez.2000. Farmer field schools and local agricultural Research committees: complementary platforms for integrated decision-making in Sustainable agriculture. ODI Agricultural Research and Extension Network .Network Paper No.105:12 In approximately 50% of the 200 or so farmer research committees established in Latin America by 2003, 50 percent had maintained or increased the size of this fund, in some cases by selling seed of new varieties they were recommending, in other cases from local contributions. Farmer Research Committees need a lively and sustained communication with external sources of information and technology to keepon bringing innovations into their experiments. When cellphone coverage exists this can be achieved through cellphone contact and this helps to reduce costs further. A facilitator can support from 20 to 50 mature Farmer Research Committees, depending on distances between them and the availability of cell phones.  Reduced cost  Farmer Research Committees enable a research and extension program to improve its relevance and at the same time, expand its coverage at low cost, or reduce its costs for existing coverage. Extension costs can be reduced while quality improves because the Committee is a mechanism which encourages farmers to assume some of the costs of adaptive testing and extension of technologies. After training, a Farmer Research Committee takes over the implementation and evaluation of on-farm trials over a multi-year period with minimal outside facilitation, and assumes the job of informing its community of its results on a regular basis. When Farmer Research Committees recommend locally-proven seed and input-use practices, they and their neighbors know they can have confidence in this information, and this accelerates adoption and innovation. At least 200 pilots of this methodology in Latin America demonstrate the type of support needed to keep a mature farmer research committee running over time and how this enables a small number of technical professionals to accelerate and expand acres of the poor to innovation. Why are farmers organized in farmer Research Committees willing to assume some of the costs of adaptive testing and extension? The answer lies in thousands of studies of agricultural technology adoption by poor farmers in developing countries. These show how some farmers in a community will always conduct small-scale experiments on their farmsRichards, P. 1985. Indigenous Agricultural Revolution.Ecology and food production in West Africa. London:Hutchinson; B. Haverkort, J. van der Kampand A. Waters-Bayer (eds) 1991. Joining Farmers‚ÄôExperiments: Experiences in participatory technology development. London: Intermediate Technology Publications to check out whether a blanket recommendation or a technology package from an extension agent actually works in their conditions These studies also show how other farmers will wait to see how these experimenters fare before they too take the risk of innovating. This makes sense because the poor are usually farming in highly unpredictable and risky production environments, for which it is extremely expensive for an extension system to develop precise recommendations. The best these services can do is to come up with technologies that, on the average, are likely to do well. But poor farmers need‚Äìand practise‚Äîprecision farming: they deliberately maximise diversity within small areas on their farms to protect themselves from the risk of a bad season in one micro-environment, or one disease or pest or crop or variety. As a result, farmers are rightly cautious about adopting blanket recommendations, and they do their own on-farm testing to check these recommendations out. Farmer Research Committees harness a huge, underutilized resource: the time and money poor farmers spend tinkering with technologies they don't fully trust or understand. This is why experimenting farmers willingly volunteer as Committee members, even if they are very poor, and why they are willing to absorb the costs of adaptive testing done in Committee. A Farmer Research Committee socializes the local experimentation that is ongoing on every farm to some degree, and makes this activity more systematic, better informed and more efficient for a larger number of beneficiaries. Farmers who volunteer and are elected to be members of Farmer Research Committees are nominated by their communities because they are known to be already investing in a lot of their own local experimentation. When these farmers experiment in a group, they can replicate their experiments and learn much faster, so the return on their time and other investments increases in group experimentation compared with the idiosyncratic experimentation they do on their own.  Function  A Farmer Research Committee can be elected by any kind of client group or organizations wanting to test and adapt agricultural technology: for example, a community, a rural self-help group,a producer association or a cooperative. The Committee enables the farmers it serves to express their demand for new technology and to participate in setting priorities for local testing, as well as in designing, evaluating and disseminating appropriate technologies. Because a Committee is elected (and members can be replaced) and has to report back regularly on its results and its use of funds to its clients, this service is accountable and so ensures that only appropriate technologies are recommended locally. =Formation= The proper motivation of client groups and the nomination of committee members are crucial to success. Like all group formation processes in rural communities, Farmer Research Committees are vulnerable to being captured by an elite unless the appropriate precautions are taken to ensure a Committee represents a reasonably homogeneous set of interests in a shared agro-ecological recommendation domain. A committee can include a few as four or as many as 40 members, depending on the socio-cultural context. Members who do not put in the time or effort considered necessary by the community or client group can be replaced. Planning Farmer Research Committees can be greatly assisted by combining the use of a Geographical Information System (GIS) with wealth ranking, a participatory rural appraisal (PRA) tool. An extension system should have at least one Farmer Research Committee per recommendation domain and organize regular contact among Committees for exchange of results. =Diagnosis and planning= Once elected, a committee organizes a diagnostic process in which all its clients participate to identify a local priority for research.Topics include for example, testing crop varieties, pest control regimes, fertilisers, livestock feeding strategies, producing and marketing new products or alternate soil erosion control technologies. The most important feature of a Committee's research topic is that it tries to solve an important local problem and that there is no readily-available and reliable knowledge of how to solve it already in existence. The diagnostic process involves the Committee in talking to experienced farmers in their locality and visiting experiment stations, agricultural input suppliers and extension offices. By the end of the diagnosis they either have found a solution to the problem or have found several alternative solutions and are not sure which one will be best. =Experimentation= If the Committee finds that locally-proven technologies are available, it asks farmers experienced with the technology to help them with community-wide training. If however, Committee members are not sure about what will work locally, then they then work with their facilitator or extension agent to design an experiment that will compare several unproven solutions. These may be of local or external origin. Farmer Research Committee experiments typically begin with several treatments compared with local practice tested on a very small scale. Over time, the number of treatments is reduced and the size of the experimental plots is increased until one or more technologies are being validated at commercial scale. Committee experiments are usually replicated on the members own farms but the Committee members may also ask other farmers to join in and plant or evaluate experiments. Farmer Research Committee experiments are evaluated using methodology for farmer evaluation of technology (Guererro, Ashby & Gracia, 1993). This can be applied by farmers to very large or small numbers of treatments to generate a qualitative ranking based on their own criteria for evaluation. The ranking is easy for farmers to understand and report back to the Committee's clients. At the same time a statistical packagefro the analysis of rankings is available for use by technical extension staff, if desired. =Reporting back= Reporting back involves a Farmer Research Committee in making a regular, formal report on its activities, its results and how it has used its funds to its community or client group. This is a crucial activity that socializes what has been learned from the diagnosis and experimentation by the Farmer Research Committee. Sometimes facilitators neglect this step and focus on developing the capabilities of the committee members, but this gravely under-exploits the Committee's potential for wider impact and means that dissemination of the knowledge they generate is unnecessarily restricted to the Committee. In addition, reporting back is essential for keeping the Committee accountable for its use of funds and relevant to local priorities. Committees that are reporting back often invite extension, local politicians, input suppliers, business people and experiment station researchers to this meeting. This is especially useful once a Farmer Committee has validated technology at commercial scale and farmers want to expand production. Some Committees have in this way, convinced local politicians to contribute to their operational costs or to sponsor more committees. Some Committee members have been elected as local political representatives, expanding the credibility of Farmer Committees and demand for their services. =Farmer Field Schools= The principal mechanisms for dissemination of Farmer Research Committee's results and recommendations are their day-to-day contact with neighbors and their Report Back meeting. However, local farmers may need training in how to implement the Committee's recommendations or if the Committee finds a solution that needs no further experimentation, nobody in the community may know how to use it. Running Farmer Field Schools to provide training using Farmer Research Committee recommendations is highly advantageous as it gets locally-relevant, locally validated knowledge out to a larger number of farmers than the Committee can usually contact on its own.

LIG-7) was a two- seat cabin aircraft designed and built in the USSR from April 1936.  Development  In 1930 the LIIPS ( - Leningrad institute for sail and communications engineers) formed a UK GVF ( - training centre for civil air fleet), in turn the UK GVF formed the NIAI (Naoochno-Issledovatel'skiy Aero- Institoot - scientific test aero-institute) which became the focus of several good design engineers who were given command of individual OKB (Osboye Konstrooktorskoye Byuro ‚Äì personal design/construction bureau). Along with contemporary aircraft designers, in the USSR and abroad, Grigorii Ivanovich Bakshayev was interested in the concept of variable geometry aircraft, where the size and/or shape of wings are altered according to the stage of flight, or desired characteristics. One methods of achieving this was with a telescopic wing, where wing sections of bigger aerofoil section and area are telescoped out over the original wing. He designed the RK to use a telescopic wing with six sections, of gradually increasing size, extending outwards from the fuselage to the demands of the pilot. The airframe of the RK was a simple structure of steel tube fuselage and a wire braced monoplane wing of constant M-6 section constructed of wood. The extending wing sections were each 460 mm wide and were extended by the observer in the rear cockpit operating a hand- crank connected to cables via a pulley system to pull each section out in turn, with each section pulling the next behind it. Successful flight tests starting in 1937 led to authorisation for a fighter with telescopic wings to be designed and built; The RK-I (Razdvizhnoye Krylo - Istrebitel ‚Äì extending wing fighter).

Not to be confused with an advance of someone's expected distribution from an estate currently in probate. Example Suppose person P had two children, A and B. Suppose also that P had $100,000, and gave $20,000 to child A before P's death, leaving $80,000 in P's estate. If P died without a will, and A and B were P's only heirs, A and B would be entitled to split P's estate evenly. If the doctrine of advancement were not applied, then each child would receive half of the remaining $80,000, or $40,000. However, if the doctrine of advancement is applied, then the $20,000 already given to A would be considered part of P's estate advanced to A. Thus, the estate would still be valued at $100,000, and each heir would be entitled to $50,000, with the $20,000 already given to A being counted as part of his share. Of the remaining $80,000, A would take $30,000 and B would take $50,000. History The principle is of ancient origin; as regards goods and chattels it was part of the ancient customs of London and the province of York, and as regards land descending in coparcenary (under which only one heir can claim an inheritance) it was always part of the common law of England under the name of hotchpot. Land which belongs or would belong to a child as heir need not be brought in to the common fund, even though such land was given during the father's life. The widow can gain no advantage from any advancement. No child can be forced to account for his or her advancement, but instead he will be excluded from a share in the intestate's estate. The usual judicial view was that any considerable sum of money paid to a child at that child's request is an advancement; thus payment of a son's debts of honour has been held to be an advancement. On the other hand, trivial gifts and presents to a child were undoubtedly not advancements. Contemporary law A number of jurisdictions have enacted statutes which ameliorate the doctrine of advancement by requiring, for example, that the person giving the gift must indicate in writing that it is intended to be counted as an advancement against the estate. The Uniform Probate Code, which has been adopted in whole or in part by a number of states, limits the doctrine by requiring a contemporaneous writing from the deceased, or any writing from the property recipient, indicating that the property is intended to be treated as an advance upon the estate.Uniform Probate Code hosted at the University of Pennsylvania, ¬ß 2-109 (accessed June 9, 2009).

Dr√®ze (born 1929) is a Belgian economist noted for his contributions to economic theory, econometrics, and economic policy as well as for his leadership in the economics profession. Dr√®ze was the first President of the European Economic Association in 1986 and was the President of the Econometric Society in 1970. Jacques Dr√®ze is also the father of five sons. One son is the economist, Jean Dr√®ze, who is known for his work on poverty and hunger in India (some of which has been in collaboration with Amartya K. Sen); another son, Xavier Dr√®ze, was professor of Marketing at UCLA. Contributions to economics Dr√®ze's contributions to economics combine policy-relevance and mathematical techniques. > Indeed, models basically play the same role in economics as in fashion: they > provide an articulated frame on which to show off your material to advantage > ... ; a useful role, but fraught with the dangers that the designer may get > carried away by his personal inclination for the model, while the customers > may forget that the model is more streamlined than reality.*JHD. > \\"(Uncertainty and) The Firm in General Equilibrium Theory\\". The Economic > Journal, Vol. 95, Supplement: Conference Papers (1985), pp. 1‚Äì20. =Economics of uncertainty and insurance= Preferences depending on the state of nature Between games of strategy and games against nature, there remains a middle ground where uncertainties are partially controllable by the decision-maker‚Äîsituations labelled \\"games of strength and skill\\" by von Neumann and Morgenstern, or \\"moral hazard\\" in subsequent work. Such problems of moral hazard have been discussed by Jacques Dr√®ze in his dissertation, leading to the 1961 paper (8), whose analysis was generalized in 1987 (76), and simplified in 2004 (123). Dr√®ze's theory allows for preferences depending on the state of the environment. Rational behaviour is again characterised by subjective expected utility maximisation, where the utility is state- dependent, and the maximisation encompasses the choice of an optimal subjective probability from an underlying feasible set. Willingness to pay With reference to state-dependent preferences and moral hazard, a natural application of long-standing interest to economists concerns the provision of safety, for instance through road investments that are aimed at saving lives. In this area, Jacques Dr√®ze introduced in 1962 (12) the \\"willingness-to-pay\\" approach, which is now widely adopted. That approach rests on individual preferences aggregated as per the theory of public goods. The willingness to pay approach thus fits squarely in economic theory. Essays on Economic Decisions Under Uncertainty The work of Jacques Dr√®ze on the economics of uncertainty through the mid-eighties is collected in his volume of Essays on Economic Decisions under Uncertainty (B2), published in 1987. The book is organised in seven parts, covering successively decision theory, market allocation, consumption, production, the firm under incomplete markets, labor and public decisions. Under market allocation comes an important paper (21) on the interpretation and properties of the general equilibrium model pioneered in Arrow (1953). The more significant piece in the next part is a classic paper with Franco Modigliani on savings and portfolio choice under uncertainty (28). There follow three papers on industry equilibrium (17, 42, 62). =General equilibrium economics with price rationing: Dr√®ze equilibria= Price rigidities In the early seventies, motivated by the potential role of price rigidities for enhancing risk-sharing efficiency, Jacques Dr√®ze undertook to define equilibria with price rigidities and quantity constraints and to study their properties in a general equilibrium context. His 1975 paper (36, circulated in 1971) introduces the so-called \\"Dr√®ze equilibrium\\" at which supply (resp. demand) is constrained only when prices are downward (resp. upward) rigid, whereas a preselected commodity (e.g. money) is never rationed. Existence is proved for arbitrary bounds on prices, through an original approach repeatedly used ever since. That paper is a widely cited classic. It was followed by several others (51, 55, 63, 75), exploring properties of the new concept. Of particular significance to future developments is a joint paper with Pierre Dehez (55), which establishes the existence of Dr√®ze equilibria with no rationing of the demand side. These are called \\"supply-constrained equilibria\\". They correspond to the empirically relevant macroeconomic situations. Macroeconomic consequences of microeconomics In the meantime, Jean-Pascal B√©nassy (1975) and Yves Youn√®s (1975) had approached the same problem from a macroeconomic angle, for the more restrictive case of fixed prices. There developed a lively interest in fixed price economies, and specifically in a three-good macroeconomic model, first formulated by Robert Barro and Herschel Grossman (1971) and then studied extensively by Edmond Malinvaud (1977). That model invited empirical estimation. The new statistical challenges posed by \\"disequilibrium econometrics\\" were attacked at CORE by two students of Jacques Dr√®ze, namely Henri Sneessens (1981) and Jean-Paul Lambert (1988). Following a joint paper by Dr√®ze and Sneessens (71), a major project (the European Unemployment Program) directed by Jacques Dr√®ze and Richard Layard led to estimation of a common disequilibrium model in ten countries (B4, 93, 94). The results of that successful effort were to inspire policy recommendations in Europe for several years.Dehez 2006. Supply-constrained equilibria The next steps in the theoretical research came with the work of John Roberts on supply-constrained equilibria at competitive prices, and then with the dissertation of Jean-Jacques Herings at Tilburg (1987, 1996). In both cases, there appear results on existence of a continuum of Dr√®ze equilibria. Following the work of Roberts and Herings, Dr√®ze (113) proved existence of equilibria with arbitrarily severe rationing of supply. Next, in a joint paper with Herings and others (132), Dr√®ze established the generic existence of a continuum of Pareto-ranked supply-constrained equilibria for a standard economy with some fixed prices. An intuitive explanation of that surprising result is this: if some prices are fixed and the remaining are flexible, the level of the latter prices relative to the former introduces a degree of freedom that accounts for the multiplicity of equilibria; globally, less rationing is associated with a higher price level; the multiplicity of equilibria thus formalises a trade-off between inflation and unemployment, comparable to a Phillips curve. In this analysis, the continuum is interpreted as reflecting co-ordination failures, not short-run price dynamics √† la Phillips. The fact that price-wage rigidities can sustain co-ordination failures adds a new twist to explanations of involuntary unemployment. At the same time, multiple equilibria create problems for the definition of expectations, and introduce a new dimension of uncertainty.

Incomplete markets and money Theory of the firm =Finance and the diversification of risk= Dr√®ze gave a public lecture on \\"Human Capital and Risk Bearing\\" (48). The innovative idea here is the transposition of the reasoning underlying the theory of \\"implicit labour contracts\\" to the understanding of wage rigidities and unemployment benefits. When markets are incomplete, so that workers cannot insure the risks associated with their future terms of employment, competitive clearing of spot labour markets is not second-best efficient: wage rigidities cum unemployment benefits offer scope for improvement. The lecture develops this theme informally. The conclusion, stated with specific reference to labour markets, has more general validity. It applies to any situation where the uninsurable uncertainty about future prices results in welfare costs. Even though price rigidities entail a loss of productive efficiency, this can be more than offset by a gain of efficiency in risk-sharing. What may be specific to the labour market is the realistic possibility of controlling (minimum) wages and organising unemployment compensation. The analysis implies that the claim that wage flexibility is efficient requires qualification. For \\"price-wage rigidities\\", the presence of rigidities receives an explanation in Section Seven of Dr√®ze's lecture: Under incomplete markets, wage rigidities contribute to risk-sharing efficiency. The theme of the 1979 lecture (48) is taken up in several papers (91, 95, 101), exploring the definition and implementation of second-best wage rigidities. Since then, Jacques Dr√®ze has examined ways of reconciling flexibility of labour costs to firms with risk-sharing efficiency of labour incomes, if needed through wage subsidies (119, 125, 131). =Labor managed firms= Disequilibrium Dr√®ze has suggested that research needs both to search for \\"microeconomic foundations for macroeconomics\\" and to consider the \\"macroconomic consequences of microecononomics\\", and Dr√®ze had contributed to the latter project of macroeconomic consequences of microeconomics =Theory= In the early seventies, motivated by the potential role of price rigidities for enhancing risk-sharing efficiency, Jacques Dr√®ze undertook to define equilibria with price rigidities and quantity constraints and to study their properties in a general equilibrium context. His 1975 paper (36, circulated in 1971) introduces the so-called \\"Dr√®ze equilibrium\\" at which supply (resp. demand) is constrained only when prices are downward (resp. upward) rigid, whereas a preselected commodity (e.g. money) is never rationed. Existence is proved for arbitrary bounds on prices, through an original approach repeatedly used ever since. That paper is a widely cited classic. It was followed by several others (51, 55, 63, 75), exploring properties of the new concept. Of particular significance to future developments is a joint paper with Pierre Dehez (55), which establishes the existence of Dr√®ze equilibria with no rationing of the demand side. These are called \\"supply- constrained equilibria\\". They correspond to the empirically relevant macroeconomic situations.

There developed a lively interest in fixed- price economies, and specifically in a three-good macroeconomic model, first formulated by Robert Barro and Herschel Grossman (1971) and then studied extensively by Edmond Malinvaud (1977). That model invited empirical estimation. The new statistical challenges posed by \\"disequilibrium econometrics\\" were attacked at CORE by two students of Jacques Dr√®ze, namely Henri Sneessens (1981) and Jean-Paul Lambert (1988), whose dissertations were published and widely read. Dr√®ze and Sneessens proposed and estimated a disequilibrium model of Belgium's open economy (71). This model became the prototypical model estimated by the European Unemployment Programme, which under the guidance of Dr√®ze and Richard Layard developed similar models for ten countries (B4, 93, 94). The results of that successful effort were to inspire policy recommendations in Europe for several years. =Economic policy= Following the emergence of European unemployment in the 1970s, Jacques Dr√®ze worked with Franco Modigliani on macroeconomic policies. There resulted a paper (56), which contains some methodological innovations (an early formulation of the \\"union-wage model\\", and Bayesian synthesis of classical estimates from several models). It also contains an innovative discussion of work sharing, a topic to which Dr√®ze returned in (73). In the 1980s and early 1990s, Dr√®ze wrote about the policy front, campaigning for two-sided policies of demand stimulation and supply-side restructuring (100). With Edmond Malinvaud, Dr√®ze organized a group of thirteen Belgian and French economists who wrote \\"Growth and employment: the scope for a European initiative\\" (103, 104): This position paper advocated an ambitious program of public investments coupled with elimination of social security contributions by employees on minimum wages. That paper has influenced the programs of reduced contributions on low wages introduced recently in several countries, especially France and Belgium. The logic of these two-handed policies stands out more sharply in the light of the work on co-ordination failures (124, section 6). These failures are more naturally remedied through demand stimulation. But the failures are apt to be recurrent, so that deficit spending could lead to continued growth of the public debt. Accordingly, demand stimulation should take the form of socially profitable investments, with returns covering the debt service. Substituting profitable investments and variable social security contributions for deficit spending and straight wage rigidities, the proposed two-handed policies differ from either orthodox Keynesianism or New Keynesian policies. =Public economics= > I am impressed by the depth and breadth of knowledge that a serious public > economist dreams of commanding. The methodological spectrum includes at one > end practical and institutional aspects of public utility pricing, taxation > or health care provision, which give the field its substantive content.

At the > far end of the spectrum is abstract modelling of economies with non-convex > technologies or uncertainty and incomplete markets. Confronted by this > spectrum, duly illustrated here, I feel neither despairing nor resigned to > narrow specialization, but probably over-extended. =Bayesian econometrics of simultaneous equations= One important by-product of the theory of rational decisions under uncertainty has been the emergence of the Bayesian approach to statistics, which views problems of statistical decision as no different from other decision problems, and problems of statistical inference as concerned with the revision of subjective probabilities on the basis of observations. Bayesian analysis of structural econometric models raises specific difficulties, linked to the so-called \\"identification problem\\", readily illustrated by a single market: we observe prices and quantities at the intersection of supply and demand, whereas we wish to estimate the demand and supply curves. The development of suitable Bayesian methods for this problem followed circulation in 1962 of a Discussion Paper by Jacques Dr√®ze, fully developed in several subsequent papers (34, 39, 41, 61). The \\"Dr√®ze Prior\\" is introduced in (39). Leadership Jacques Dr√®ze has been involved in helping to found several institutions that have strengthened economic research in Europe, notably the Center for Operations Research and Econometrics (CORE), the European Doctoral Program in Quantitative Economics (EDP) and the European Economic Association (EEA). =CORE= CORE was created in 1966, and rapidly grew into a leading research centre of international significance. Jacques Dr√®ze was the instigator, the organiser, the first Director and a long-time President of CORE. His outside connections were critical in gathering outside support and in attracting foreign members or visitors. As expressed by Robert Aumann, CORE is \\"a unique breeding ground; a place where cross-fertilisation leads to the conception of new ideas, as well as a womb ‚Äì a warm, supportive environment in which these ideas can grow and mature\\". The research output at CORE since 1966 consists to date of some 110 books, 125 doctoral dissertations, 1700 published articles; Discussion Papers now average 85 per year. Also, CORE has served as a model, emulated in other European countries, often at the hands of former CORE members or visitors: Bonn, for GREQAM in Marseille, CentER at Tilburg or Delta in Paris. =Doctoral study and the European Doctoral Program in Quantitative Economics= It is also at CORE, and again at the initiative of Jacques Dr√®ze, that EDP was conceived in 1975. Two ideas came together: *An institution should not organise its own doctoral program if it cannot do as well as leading institutions elsewhere. *Education for research is greatly enhanced if students attend at least two institutions, being thereby led to hear confronting opinions and form their own! These ideas were realised under EDP, where several universities organise a joint doctoral program, with all students attending at least two institutions and having access to supervisors from both. Some 120 students have graduated under this program, which again has been emulated by others in Europe. =European Economic Association= In 1985 the EEA was conceived by Jean Gabszewicz and Jacques Thisse, both of CORE. The first secretary was CORE's Louis Phlips and Jacques Dr√®ze was the first President. Today the EEA sponsors the Journal of the European Economic Association (JEEA), holds annual meetings, and organizes summer schools for young researchers. Personal biography Born in Verviers (Belgium) in 1929, Jacques Dr√®ze did undergraduate economics at the nearby Universit√© de Li√®ge, and then a PhD at Columbia University, with a thesis on \\"Individual Decision Making under Partially Controllable Uncertainty\\" supervised by William Vickrey. After a first academic job at Carnegie Mellon University in Pittsburgh, he joined Universit√© Catholique de Louvain in 1958, and has been there ever since‚Äîapart from visiting appointments at Northwestern University, the University of Chicago, and Cornell University‚Äîuntil his retirement from teaching and administration in 1989. Since his nominal retirement, he remains active in research. In 1980 he became Foreign Member of the Royal Netherlands Academy of Arts and Sciences. Jacques Dr√®ze has five sons,Five sons are listed in the dedication to *JHD. 1989. Labour Management, Contracts and Capital Markets: A General Equilibrium Approach. [1983 Yrj√∂ Jahnsson Lectures].

Johanson is known for her large-scale art projects that create aesthetic and practical habitats for humans and wildlife. She designs her functional art projects, created with and in the natural landscape, to solve infrastructure and environmental problems, but also to reconnect city-dwellers with nature and with the history of a place. These project designs date from 1969, making her a pioneer in the field of ecological-art (or eco-art.) Lippard, p. vii Johanson's work has also been classified as Land Art, Environmental Art, Site-specific Art and Garden Art. Her early paintings and sculptures are part of Minimalism. Early life & education Johanson's enthusiasm for nature and for art began in childhood. She grew up in New York City, where she spent countless hours in Frederick Law Olmsted parks. Her mother, a former model, introduced her to the arts. As a high school student, she excelled at music, but at Bennington College (1958‚Äì1962) she was a painting major.; Munro, Originals, p. 462; Kelley, pp. 141-42, 149; Balken, p. 23 Through her contacts at Bennington, Johanson became part of the 1960s New- York art-world. Her Bennington instructor, Tony Smith (sculptor), was a close friend and her art-history professor, Eugene Goossen, a mentor and later her husband. At this time she met fellow-artists Kenneth Noland, David Smith (sculptor), Helen Frankenthaler, Franz Kline, Philip Guston and Joseph Cornell.Balken, p. 23; Kelley, pp. 47-48, 143-44; She also came to know art- critic Clement Greenberg and visionary architect Frederick John Kiesler.Kelley, pp. 143-44 Johanson earned a Master's in art history at Hunter College, New York in 1964. There she studied with Tony Smith, Eugene Goossen and Ad Reinhardt and met fellow art students Robert Morris, Carl Andre and Robert Barry.Kelley, p. 144; Balken, p. 23 At this time, she worked as a researcher for New York publisher Benjamin Blom on a compendium of 18th and 19th century American artists. The project led to an opportunity to catalogue the work of Georgia O'Keeffe, who became an important mentor.Kelley, pp. 101, 104,150-52; Balken, p. 23 Her husband, art critic and historian Eugene Goossen, died in 1997.Dobryznski, Judith H. \\"Eugene Goossen, 76, Art Critic\\", The New York Times, July 17, 1997. Accessed July 25, 2010. Minimalist art works Johanson's paintings and sculptures of the 1960s have been classified as Minimalism and they were included in some of the earliest shows of Minimal Art: ‚Äú8 Young Artists‚Äù (1964), ‚ÄúDistillation‚Äù (1966) and ‚ÄúCool Art‚Äù (1968).Goldstein, p. 20, 249-52, 383, 388; Battcock, p. 165 Her Minimalist paintings used simple lines to explore the optical effects of color.Goldstein, p. 249; Kelley, p. 50 These were shown at the Tibor de Nagy Gallery in New York in the 1960s and her oil painting, William Clark, was included in the 1968 Museum of Modern Art contemporary art survey, ‚ÄúThe Art of the Real‚Äù Kelley, p. 145 Johanson began making large-scale, Minimal sculpture in 1966 with William Rush, consisting of of painted steel tee-beams laid flat in a clearing.Kelley, pp. 49-50 In 1968 she increased her scale to with Stephen Long (inspired by the 19th century topographical and railway engineer), where , painted plywood segments were installed along an abandoned railroad track in Buskirk, New York.Kelley, pp. 5, 50; Goldstein, p. 249 This was followed by other large-scale Minimalist sculptures sited outdoors.Wu, House & Garden, vol. 1, pp. 18-19; Kelley, pp. 65-72 Johanson's Minimalst sculptures introduced the idea of artworks that cannot be experienced all at once, still an important value in her work.Goldstein, p. 252 Cyrus Field (1970‚Äì71), while still a large Minimalist sculpture, marks a transition. Using marble, cement and redwood slabs in their natural state, she created a maze of lines that lead visitors through a forest to reveal the changing, natural landscape. With this piece she began thinking of line as a compositional device to incorporate, rather than displace, nature. She also invented a way to mediate between human scale and the vastness of nature.Munro, p. 467; Kelley, p. 70; Patricia Johanson, A Selected Retrospective, no. 13; Balken, p. 19 The House and Garden Commission (1969) In 1969, House & Garden (magazine) invited Johanson to design a garden. While this was never built, the commission prompted an outpouring of visionary ideas‚Äî150 small sketches‚Äîwhich she has continued to draw upon over the years. The drawings, accompanied by essays and explanatory notes, were a departure from traditional garden designs and also a rejection of the formalist orientation of the 1960s art world. Instead of art- for-art's sake, her garden designs embodied meaningfulness and functionality.Wu, House and Garden, vol. I, p. 9, 13, 15; Kouwenhoven, p. 229 Johanson's move from making objects to working with the natural world‚Äîat first in drawings and later in actual commissions‚Äîhas parallels (as well as differences) with the emergence of Earthworks by artists in her circle of friends, such as Robert Smithson and Nancy Holt.Wu, House and Garden, vol. I, p. 21; Munro, ‚ÄúEarthwork Odyssey,‚Äô‚Äò pp. 30-31 The similarity is working large- scale with the land itself. A difference is that many of Johanson's designs were meant to serve practical functions, such as flood control, habitat for local wildlife, and green roofs that absorb rainwater.Oakes, p. 150 Johanson also designed for urban, rather than remote locations.Kelley, p. 6; Munro,‚ÄùForeword,‚Äù p. 3 Another difference is that most of her designs are dominated by a simple, large image of a plant or animal.Wu, House and Garden, vol. I, p. 25 The House and Garden designs mark a reorientation in Johanson's career. She gave up painting and sculpture and now focused on designs that are simultaneously art and landscapeWu, House and Garden, vol. I, p. 9 To prepare herself for translating project designs into large-scale sculptural landscapes, she began studying civil engineering and architecture at City College School of Architecture, New York, in 1971, receiving her B. Arch. in 1977.Balken, pp. 24-25; Kelley, p. 7 Plant drawings for projects: 1974-78 In the 1970s, Johanson began a family and settled in upstate New York, where she has lived ever since.Lippard, ‚ÄúPanorama‚Äù, pp. viii-xi She left the vibrant New York art scene for a 19th-century farmhouse on the rural Buskirk property of Eugene Goossen. Her first son, Alvar, was born in 1973 (followed by Gerrit in 1978 and Nathaniel in 1980). Here she was in constant touch with the natural seasons, but childrearing left only snatches of time to work.Kelley, pp. 7, 9, 148 Her solution was to make tiny drawings of plants during the day and at night to transform them into designs for large-scale projects.Kelley, p. 9; Russell, \\"Projects from Plant Forms\\" At this time, she also studied botany texts.Kelley, p. 148 This was a new process: instead of depending on inspiration, she rendered nature in a straightforward way.Kelley, p. 148; Patricia Johanson: Plant Drawings for Projects Water and color garden designs: 1980-85 In the 1980s, even as Johanson began her first built projects, she created several series of project drawings for gardens and fountains that emphasize water and color in the form of gigantic flowers, butterfly wings or snakes. For example, Tidal Color Gardens (1981‚Äì82) increase the visibility of tides, with images of butterfly wings or flowers changing as water flows in and out.Balken, p. 10 The O‚ÄôKeeffe/Equivalents-Color Garden are drawings for earth sculptures in the form of a butterfly wing with color patterns based on Alfred Stieglitz photographs of O‚ÄôKeeffe.Kelley, p. 131; Balken, p. 11 Project commissions: 1981-present =Leonhardt Lagoon, Dallas (1981-1986) = Saggitaria platyphylla (Delta Duckpotato) at Fair Park's Leonhardt Lagoon Johanson's first built project was commissioned in 1981 to restore Fair Park's Leonhardt Lagoon, which was then in a badly degraded state.Kelley, p. 20; Oakes, p. 150 To solve the problems of an eroded shoreline, murky water and algal bloom, Johanson devised large sculptural forms that broke up wave action and selected indigenous plantings as microhabitats for wildlife.Oakes, pp. 150, 152; Garris, p. 59 The gigantic, terra cotta-colored gunite sculptures, which doubled as pathways for human visitors and perches for birds and turtles, take the form of a Delta Duck- potato (Sagittaria platyphylla) and a Spider Brake Fern (Pteris multifida).Kelley, p. 21; Oakes, pp. 150, 152 Today Leonhardt Lagoon is a functioning ecosystem in the heart of Dallas, where it also serves as a place of education and recreation.Oakes, p. 153 This is one of the earliest examples of art as bioremediation.Spaid, p. 67 For this and other large-scale urban projects, she works with a variety of experts, including scientists, engineers, and city planners, as well as local citizen groups.Kelley, p. 3 =Endangered Garden, San Francisco (1987-97)= When San Francisco needed a new pump station and holding tank next to the Bay, Johanson was invited to co- design a facility that would be sensitive to the site.Kelley, p. 26; Oakes, p. 15, 154; Matilsky, p. 64 She wanted something aesthetic, but also useful in ways beyond mere sewage treatment, so she designed a series of habitats to nourish threatened species.Kelley, p. 28; Oakes, p. 154 The roof of the sewer is a one-third-mile-long baywalk whose colors and patterns derive from the endangered San Francisco garter snake.Kelley, p. 26; Oakes, p. 154 The head of the serpent is a mound that serves as a microhabitat for butterflies. The Ribbon Worm Tidal Steps fills with water at high tide, creating homes for small marine life. =Park for the Amazon Rainforest, Obidos, Brazil (1992)= In 1992, the Brazilian government invited Johanson to attend the Earth Summit and to create a project for a park in the Amazon Rainforest. Her model for this shows a ramp, in the form of a Brazilian aerial plant, that allows visitors to experience a range of microhabitats at various levels. The ramp itself is intended to become encrusted by tropical vegetation. This project has been disrupted several times by changes in government and is currently on hold.Kelly, pp. 57, 61; Oakes, p. 156 =The Rocky Marciano Trail, Brockton, Massachusetts (1997-1999)= This project, which art critic Lucy Lippard calls a favorite, began as an effort to stimulate Brockton's economy.Lippard, ‚ÄúPanorama‚Äù, p. xi; Kelley, p. 75; Johanson, ‚ÄúBrockton Reborn‚Äù, pp. 15-16 Johanson developed a master plan to connect disparate neighborhoods and districts and to restore ecological functioning.Rotella, p. 203; Kelley, p. 77 Since Rocky Marciano is a Brockton celebrity, she planned to use his training routes as a way to connect neighborhoods and nature.Lippard, ‚ÄúPanorama‚Äù, p. xi; Rotella, pp. 203-04 The Rocky Marciano Trail begins at the Marciano home and leads visitors to various ‚Äúmagnet sites,‚Äô‚Äò such as Thomas McNulty Park and Battery Wagner, both enhanced by Johanson‚Äôs cultural and environmental designs.Rotella, pp. 203, 213-15; Kelley, p. 82 She also planned to daylight the many buried or disrupted streams throughout the town and to revive forest corridors to create a continuous public landscape.Rotella, pp. 211, 215; Kelley, p. 77 This project was rejected by the city of Brockton.Kelley, p. 83; Rotella, pp. 218-24 =Millenium Park Landfill Site, Seoul, Korea (1999)= In 1999, Johanson was part of an international team of experts asked to propose sustainable solutions for Seoul‚Äôs main dumpsite, which closed in 1990. To reclaim the site her idea was to transform it into a park and to restore ecological communities. As a unifying image, she chose the haetae, a mythical animal that wards off evil. She borrowed decorative patterns of haetae sculptures to create designs for terraces, microhabitats, and pedestrian and vehicle access to the summits.Kelley, p. 100, 103 =Petaluma Wetlands Park and Ellis Creek Water Recycling Facility, Petaluma, California (2001-09)= Aerial view of the Ellis Creek Water Treatment Facility in Petaluma, CA completed in January 2009 Working as a member of the Carollo Engineers design team, Johanson helped create a new water treatment facility. By overlaying art, public access, sewage treatment, habitat restorations, and agriculture, she embedded major urban infrastructure within living nature. Her design has been credited with \\"re-inventing art and reforming civil engineering\\".Xin Wu, \\"Petaluma Wetlands Park: Re-inventing Art, Reforming Engineering\\", LANDSCAPE ARCHITECTURE CHINA, vol. 11, no. 3, June 2010, p. 134-136, online at http://patriciajohanson.com/download/Patricia-Johanson-LAC-03-2010.pdf The project includes natural systems to treat sewage, allowing millions of gallons of water to be reused. Johanson used the form of the endangered Salt Marsh Harvest Mouse to create the shapes of the polishing ponds, which contain islands that direct the flow of water and provide nesting habitat for birds. Other plantings support local wildlife. An additional area of tidal wetlands was acquired for the park and wildlife sanctuary.Kelley, pp. 95-96; Clarkson, p. 107; http://cityofpetaluma.net/wrcd/ellis-creek.html; Johanson,\\"Fecund Landscapes\\", pp. 28-29, online at http://www.landviews.org/la2003/fecund- pj.html This multi-purpose landscape provides more than of walking trails for educational programs, nature study and tourism. Petaluma Wetlands Park coincides with a $150 million sewage treatment facility, while also serving as a highly visible model for converting sewage into recycled water, which is stored in a deep reservoir at the end of the \\"mouse's tail\\".http://www.landscapeonline.com/research/article/12627; Wu, ‚ÄúContemporary Landscape Criticism‚Äù, p. 140 =The Draw at Sugar House, Salt Lake City, Utah (2003-2018)= The Draw at Sugar House with Sunflowers The Salt Lake nonprofit, Parley's Rails, Trails and Tunnels Coalition commissioned Johanson to create safe passage under a major expressway and connect two sections of the planned eight-mile (13 km) Parley's Trail. The design encompasses two gigantic sculptures based on the native Sego Lily (Calochortus nuttallii) and an historic canyon, which are respectively located east and west of the expressway and connected by an underpass. As practical infrastructure, the Sego Lily serves as a diversion dam, while the canyon functions as flood wall, spillway, and provides wildlife habitat. Simultaneously, the sculptures serve as climbing walls, overlooks, a trail and plaza. The underpass will mimic a Utah canyon, with embedded coal seams and fossil formations. The design is multilayered to offer visitors opportunities to connect in a variety of ways with references to local ecology, geology, and specific sculptural formations to recall the Mormon journey through Echo Canyon.Wu, ‚ÄúWalk through the Crossing‚Äù, pp. 141-60; Conan, p. 14; Kelley, pp. 36-39 Like other projects designed by Johanson, The Draw at Sugar House, is a multilayered creation. It is simultaneously large-scale gunite sculpture, habitat for native flora and fauna, a compendium of references to Utah's cultural and natural history, and finally an element of Salt Lake City's flood control system. The project is notable not only for its conceptual complexity, but also for the structural complexity which necessitated a sophisticated engineering design using I-beams and reinforced concrete.For a time-lapse video of the Sego Lily Plaza construction see https://www.parleystrail.org/updates/ ‚ÄúSego Lily Plaza Construction,‚Äù Alex Mager, Parley‚Äôs Trail, October 13, 2018 [retrieved Jan. 1, 2019].

The Draw began in 2003 as an award-winning design for a safe bicycle and pedestrian passage under a busy seven-lane highway. The underpass also connects two sections of Parley's Creek Trail in Sugar House Park and the Hidden Hollow natural area. The original design evolved over the next 15 years in significant ways, notably in the augmentation of its flood- control functions and the elimination of two significant features of the original plan.The original plan consisted of the Sego Lily, underpass and a wet meadow with a gigantic rattlesnake-shaped conduit purifying stormwater run-off into Parley‚Äôs Creek west of the highway. This was not included in the final project because the easement granted was too narrow; email from Patricia Johanson to Patricia Sanders, Jan. 29, 2019. For the artist‚Äôs description of the original design see https://landviews.org/articles/snake-pj.html Patricia Johanson,‚ÄúSnake & Lily‚Äù, copyright 2003, Land Views(retrieved Jan. 11, 2019). The juried competition was sponsored by Salt Lake City, with funding from the National Endowment of the Arts.

There are many published commentaries on The Draw at Sugar House. For a detailed description and interpretation of the project prior to construction see Xin Wu, Patricia Johanson and the Re-Invention of Public Environmental Art, 1958-2010, Farnham, Surrey and Burlington, VT: Ashgate, 2013. The final artwork consists of three contiguous sections: the Sego Lily plaza and walkway, the underpass, and the Echo Canyon ‚Äúliving wall‚Äù. It can be entered and explored either from Sugar House Park on the east or from the Hidden Hollow natural area on the west. The Sego Lily Plaza serves a variety of functions and contains a multiplicity of meanings. Utah's state flower, the sego lily, is the basis for the design of this section of The Draw situated at the west side of Sugar House Park. The shapes of the flower form an amphitheater with the stem creating a pathway extending to a bulb-shaped overlook above Parley's Creek, which at that point flows beneath the highway to emerge five blocks away in Hidden Hollow. The three petals of the monumental lily are layered with sculpted rock-like forms creating little terraces for native plants and for visitor seating. In times of flooding the bowl-shaped amphitheater serves as a basin, that calms and direct water through the underpass and down the sculpted spillway ‚Äúcanyon.‚Äù The petal on the north side rises 30 feet to create an overlook, while the east petal is striated with irrigation channels and food crops. The south petal contains winding pathways up to the highway.The Sego Lily Plaza was begun in 2017 and completed in 2018; https://www.deseretnews.com/article/900003646/sego-lily- dam-project-combines-art-and-history-with-disaster-prevention.html Lee, Jasen, ‚ÄúProject Combines Art, History with Disaster Plan‚Äù, Deseret News (Salt Lake City, Utah), November 8, 2017, p. B1, B5 (retrieved Jan 11, 2019) Entering the underpass from Sego Lily Plaza, the visitor encounters references to Utah's subterranean geology‚Äîa slice of rocky strata with a prominent coal seam and small details, such as fossils and roots, to be discovered.The underpass was completed in 2014; https://www.deseretnews.com/article/865598626/The-Draw-at- Sugar-House-unveiled.html Jasen Lee, ‚ÄúThe Draw at Sugar House Unveiled,‚Äù Deseret News (Salt Lake City, Utah), March 13, 2014 [visited 11 Jan 2019] To the west of the tunnel lies a sculpted floodwall which helps lead water overflow to Parley's Creek. The shapes of the wall reference natural landmarks and forms of Utah's historic Echo Canyon, which helped guide Mormon pioneers to their new land. This miniature Echo Canyon is not only part of the flood- control system and a historical reference, but also a vertical garden with nesting places, water catchment basins and ledges that provide habitat for native animals and plants.The Echo Canyon sculpted floodwall was constructed in 2015; http://archive.sltrib.com/article.php?id=2640248&itype;=CMSID Christopher Smart, ‚ÄúElaborate Canyon Wall Art Dresses up Tunnel from Sugar House Park, Provides Flood Barrier,‚Äù Salt Lake Tribune, June 22, 2015; (retrieved Jan. 11, 2019). Johanson‚Äôs original design for the Canyon included a second wall on the north which would have evoked the feeling of a slot canyon. This unfortunately was not constructed due to lack of funding; email of Jan. 29, 2019 from Patricia Johanson to Patricia Sanders.Aerial photo of the Sego Lily diversion dam at the Draw at Sugarhouse, Salt Lake City, Utah. =Mary‚Äôs Garden, Marywood University, Scranton, Pennsylvania (2008-present)= Mary‚Äôs Garden is designed to remediate a coal mining site, which was purchased by the Sisters, Servants of the Immaculate Heart of Mary in 1969. The garden incorporates elements that purify water and provide wildlife habitat while also referencing the cultural, geological and natural history of the place. Two large sculptural formations, Madonna Lily and Mary‚Äôs Rose, based on traditional religious symbols, shape the two main areas of the five-acre site. Remnants of mining activity and forms made of local stratified rock reference the previous, industrial uses of the land and geological eras. Seating and pathways offer opportunities for relaxation and contemplation of plants and wildlife at close range. What others have said about Patricia Johanson ‚ÄúOf all the artists (so many of them women) who have become known over the last few decades for large-scale public art in/with nature‚Äîwhat is now called ‚Äòeco-art,‚Äô Johanson stands out as a seldom-acknowledged pioneer. Her writings of the late 1960s, when she was still in her twenties, are a cornucopia of possibilities for environmental art and planning that are still being ‚Äòdiscovered‚Äô today.‚ÄùLucy Lippard, ‚ÄúPanorama‚Äù, p. vii ‚ÄúJohanson‚Äôs working model is the ecosystem and survival is her core theme, one she knows all too well, personally and politically‚Äù.Lippard, ‚ÄúPanorama‚Äù, p. xi ‚ÄúPatricia Johanson was one of the first artists to think of art as a means to restore habitats and her work is an outstanding model for maintaining biodiversity. By creating art that revitalizes natural ecosystems and introduces them to urban dwellers, she has become an innovator in art, ecology, and urban renewal.‚Äù Barbara Matilsky, p. 60 ‚ÄúJohanson teaches that artists can be vital, visionary forces in creating social and environmental change.‚ÄùCaffyn Kelley, p. 136 Public collections with works by Patricia Johanson Allen Memorial Art Museum, Oberlin College, Oberlin, Ohio Dallas Museum of Art, Dallas Metropolitan Museum of Art, New York Museum of Modern Art, New York National Museum of Women in the Arts, Washington, D.

The tower, which was built around 1480, is high, in four stages with set-back offset corner buttresses. It is thought that the work was supervised by William Wynford, master mason of Wells. To meet the growing size of Yeovil and the increased population, work on Holy Trinity Church began on 24 June 1843 to relieve the pressures on St John's. In 1863, pressures on space in the graveyard were alleviated by the opening of Preston Road cemetery. The church is capped by openwork balustrading matching the parapets which are from the 19th century, when major reconstruction work was undertaken from 1851 to 1860. The tower has two-light late 14th century windows on all sides at bell-ringing and bell-chamber levels, the latter having fine pierced stonework grilles. There is a stair turret to the north-west corner, with a weather vane termination. Among the fourteen bells are two dating from 1728 and made by Thomas Bilbie of the Bilbie family in Chew Stoke. Another from the same date, the \\"Great Bell\\", was recast in 2013, from to . Because of the state of some of the external masonry the church has been added to the Heritage at Risk Register. In the Church of St John the Baptist, Yeovil one stained glass window depicts Judas with a black halo. Unusually, the stained glass windows include a depiction of a lone Judas Iscariot with a dark halo. Inside the church is a brass reading desk originally made in East Anglia. The parish is part of a benefice with St Andrew with the Diocese of Bath and Wells.

History The British Academy Of Stage & Screen Combat (BASSC) has its roots in the now defunct Society of British Fight Directors. In the early to mid nineties the Society of British Fight Directors went through a transitional period, as its focus began to shift towards the teaching of Stage Combat. In 1996, the Society of British Fight Directors voted to change its name to the British Academy of Dramatic Combat (BADC). The British Academy of Stage & Screen Combat was formed in 1993, many founding members being of the former S.B.F.D. The organisation set about creating its current reputation as the invigorating and driving force behind stage combat in the United Kingdom. In 1997, British Equity recognised the BASSC‚Äôs Advanced Certificate as a valid qualification for entry onto the Equity Fight Directors‚Äô Training Scheme and, in 2001, the BASSC was appointed by the Equity Council for the training and assessment of Fight Directors candidates applying to join the Equity Fight Directors‚Äô Register. The BASSC is currently respected, both nationally and internationally, as a provider of professional level stage combat training. Richard Ryan was appointed the first Master Teacher of the BASSC. Since then he has gone on to become an established Hollywood Fight Director. His film credits include: Sherlock Holmes, Troy, The Dark Knight, Stardust, Ironclad, The Eagle, The Last Legion, Fallen & The Hammer of The Gods. As well as television & theatre, his work extends as far as video games; Notably, he was the Fight/Combat Consultant for the best- selling Xbox 360 game Fable 2 from Lionhead Studios. Today BASSC teachers can be found at many leading UK Drama & Arts Schools, including the Royal Academy of Dramatic Art, Royal Birmingham Conservatoire of Music and Acting , East 15 Acting School, London college of Music, Royal Academy of Music, Central School of Speech and Drama, Italia Conti, Guildhall School of Music & Drama, Drama Studio, Fourth Monkey Theatre Company, British American Drama Academy and the City Lit. Classes and Workshops are also held across the UK and are open to the public and other actor/combatants. BASSC now has training schemes in place which allow for development from Actor/Combatant to Certified Teacher as well as assessment and training of Fight Directors for the Equity register. Fight Performance Tests For Actor/Combatants, the BASSC offers 'Fight Performance Tests' in core stage combat weapon systems from the BASSC syllabus. The test requires actors to perform a dramatic scene containing a stage combat fight, choreographed and taught by a BASSC certified teacher. Students are marked on both stage combat technique and the acting within the scene. Based upon marks the awards available are: Fail, Pass & Pass with Distinction.

In other words, the computer model runs at the same rate as the actual physical system. For example, if a tank takes 10 minutes to fill in the real world, the simulation would take 10 minutes as well. Real-time simulation occurs commonly in computer gaming, but also is important in the industrial market for operator training and off-line controller tuning.The Succsssful development process with MATLAB Simulink in the framework of ESA's ATV project Computer languages like LabVIEW, VisSim and Simulink allow quick creation of such real-time simulations and have connections to industrial displays and Programmable Logic Controllers via OLE for process control or digital and analog I/O cards. Several real-time simulator are available on the market like xPC Target and RT-LAB for mechatronic systems and using Simulink, eFPGASIM and eDRIVESIM for power electronic simulation and eMEGASIM, HYPERSIM and RTDS for power grid real-time (RTS) simulation. What is real-time simulation In a real-time simulation the simulation is performed in a discrete time with constant step also known as fixed step simulation as time moves forward in equal duration of time, other techniques having variable step are used for high frequency transients but are unsuitable for real time simulation. In a real time simulation the time required to solve the internal state equations and functions representing the system must be less than the fixed step. If calculation time exceeds the time of the fixed step, an over run is said to have occurred. In simple words, real-time simulation must produce the internal variables and output within the same length of time as its physical counterpart would. Configuring models to run in real time enables you to use hardware-in-the-loop simulation to test controllers. You can make design changes earlier in the development process, reducing costs and shortening the design cycle.  Real-time simulation in academic curricula  Real-time simulators are used extensively in many engineering fields. As a consequence, the inclusion of simulation applications in academic curricula can provide great value to the student. Statistical power grid protection tests, aircraft design and simulation, motor drive controller design methods and space robot integration are a few examples of real-time simulator technology applications.

Playing career =Rugby union career= Davies began playing rugby union as a schoolboy playing for both Aberavon Council School and Port Talbot County School. The first notable club that Davies represented was Aberavon, and it was from Aberavon that Davies was first selected to represent the Wales national team. Davies played two international games for Wales, both as part of the 1912 Five Nations Championship. Davies' first cap was against Scotland played at St Helen's, which Wales won 21-6. Davies was selected for the next Wales match of the tournament, an away encounter to Ireland. The game started well for Wales, with Davies scoring his only international points, a try in the first half which was converted by Jack Bancroft. Despite Wales leading 5-0, the more experienced Irish team came back in the second half winning 12-5. By the end of 1912, Davies had switched clubs from Aberavon to Swansea, and in October he was selected to play for county team Glamorgan when they faced the second touring South African team. Davies was not originally a first choice for the team, with Cardiff's Billy Spiller chosen not only as centre but also team captain. Three of the backs selected for the encounter, Spiller, Swansea centre Alf Thomas and fullback Jack Bancroft were all withdrawn injured after the teams met in a club clash the previous Saturday. Davies was called in to replace Spiller and was also given the captaincy. The match was a one-sided competition with the South Africans running out winners by 35 points to 3. Davies played in his rugby in two parts of the United Kingdom, in Wales it was for Swansea, Glamoragn and Wales, while in the South of England he played for Exeter University, Plymouth Albion, and county rugby for Devon. In 1913 he was suspended by both Wales and Devon for alleged professionalism, and in March he decided to sever links with the union game by 'Going North' and joining Leeds R.L.F.C. =Rugby league honours= Davies won two caps for Wales while at Leeds in 1914 and 1921, and won caps for Great Britain in 1914 against Australia, and New Zealand. Davies played right-, i.e. number 3, in Leeds' 2-35 defeat by Huddersfield in the Championship Final during the 1914‚Äì15 season, and in the 11-3 victory over Dewsbury in the 1921 Yorkshire County Cup Final during the 1921‚Äì22 season at Thrum Hall, Halifax on Saturday 26 November 1921.

It stands at Carrer Montsi√≥, 3, Barcelona. Striking features of the building, more northern-European than Catalan in appearance, are the large pointed arches on the ground floor containing stained-glass windows, the curious ornamentation of the upper-floor windows and the balconies in Flamboyant style. The exterior is also notable for sculptures by Eusebi Arnau, wrought ironwork by Manuel Ballar√≠n and, on a pedestal on the corner, a statue of Saint Joseph by Josep Llimona. The existing one is a reproduction of the original, which was destroyed during the Civil War and replaced by the City Council in 2000. The building has not been preserved in its entirety. The original lintel of the door by Puig i Cadafalch disappeared in one of the modifications that the building has undergone in its more than one hundred years of history. On the ground floor there is the Quatre Gats tavern, which was one of the artistic and cultural epicentres of Barcelona between 1897 and 1903. Ramon Casas, Santiago Rusi√±ol and Pablo Picasso were amongst the illustrious figures who ate and drank here. The interior decor was financed by Ramon Casas, who paid for the circular chandeliers and the mediaeval furniture designed by Puig i Cadafalch. Another of his ‚Äúpresents‚Äù was the painting showing two men, the owner of the establishment Pere Romeu and Casas himself, pedalling a tandem; the one now in the bar is a copy, the original being in the Museu Nacional d'Art de Catalunya.

According to this Biblical verse, the Jew is obligated to be holy, ...\\" An example of this is public self-sacrifice in accordance with Jewish practice and identity, with the possibility of being killed for no other reason than being Jewish. There are specific conditions in Jewish law that deal with the details of self-sacrifice, be it willing or unwilling. The opposite or converse of kiddush Hashem is chillul Hashem (\\"Desecration [of] God's Name\\" in Hebrew) and Jews are obligated to avoid it according to Halakha (Jewish religious law). There are instances, such as when they are faced with forced conversion to another religion, when Jews should choose martyrdom and sacrifice their lives rather than commit a chillul Hashem which desecrates the honor of God. Martyrdom in Judaism is thus driven by both the desire to Sanctify God's Name concurrently and the wish to avoid the Desecration of God's Name. In Hebrew a martyr is known as a kaddosh which means \\"[a] holy [one]\\", and martyrs are known as kedoshim meaning \\"holy [ones]\\". Thus the six million Jews who were murdered in the Holocaust are known as the Kedoshim. Jewish history is replete with many episodes in which Jews who lived in different times and places chose to become individual and mass martyrs. In the Hebrew Bible Judaism, and the Abrahamic religions such as Christianity and Islam, all draw their notions of martyrdom from the Jews' Hebrew Bible as put forth in the Torah. Christian martyrs and Islamic martyrs, known as Shahids, both draw from the original Judaic sources for the concept or Mitzvah or commandment that calls upon one to unconditionally sacrifice one's life for one's God and religion if called upon and if circumstances so dictate, not to betray one's God, religion and beliefs. =Binding of Isaac= An angel prevents the sacrifice of Isaac. Abraham and Isaac, Rembrandt, 1634 The events described in the Bible known as the Binding of Isaac is the primal and archetypal example of martyrdom in the Torah. Abraham is called upon to fulfill God's commandment to slaughter his son Isaac, and Isaac to willingly submit to this and offer his life up as a korbanJewish Virtual Library. \\"Akedah\\". or \\"sacrifice\\" and hence, if need be, dying as a martyr because God had so commanded it. At the last minute God instructs Abraham to stop and to slaughter and offer up a ram instead. This was the worst of the ten tests of Abraham and the fact that Isaac was willing to give up his own life serves as a role model for all subsequent people who are called upon to sacrifice their lives for their God, religion and beliefs. =Martyrs during war= There are times that the Hebrew Bible records that the Children of Israel, also known as the Israelites, the ancestors of the Jews are instructed to wage war against their enemies in the Bible sometimes as instructed by God or their leaders or both. Examples are wars against Amalek and the Seven Nations. Such wars are known as Milkhemet Mitzvah (\\"war by commandment\\" in Hebrew, or \\"Holy War\\") and any Israelite or Jew who is killed in the course of fighting for the cause is automatically regarded as having died al Kiddush Hashem (\\"for Sanctifying God's Name\\") and is hence a Jewish martyr. =Some Biblical examples of martyrs= In Kabbalah Nadab and Abihu as described in the Book of Leviticus are consumed by fire and are sanctified by God and are examples of what God wants out of the death of martyrs. Samson in the Book of Judges is regarded as a martyr because he ultimately sacrificed his life to sanctify God's Name. In the Book of Samuel both King Saul and his sons especially Jonathan are regarded as martyrs because they sacrificed their own lives rather than being captured and humiliated by the Philistines. Zechariah ben Jehoiada a righteous priest who spoke up for justice was stoned to death on the orders of an evil king of Judah, as described in the Book of Chronicles. Shadrach, Meshach, and Abednego known in the Book of Daniel as Hananiah, Mishael, and Azariah were thrown into a fiery furnace for disobeying the Babylonian king who had commanded his subjects to worship an idol. By a miracle they survived but are nevertheless treated as heroes who risked martyrdom. Jewish-Babylonian War The Jewish-Babylonian War lasted from 601 to 586 BCE. It included many battles and two sieges of Jerusalem, the Siege of Jerusalem (597 BCE) and the Siege of Jerusalem (587 BCE). The final siege resulted in the complete destruction of the First Temple by the Babylonian Empire. Since these events took place so long ago the main records are Biblical as well as some information gleaned from archaeology. Certainly many thousands, if not hundreds of thousands, of Jews were killed and martyred during this period in history. An indication of how seriously Jews and Judaism regard the scope, tragedy and impact of the destruction of the First Temple and the catastrophic impact on their land, the Kingdom of Judah, and their subsequent Babylonian Exile. Many Jewish fast days and mourning periods were instituted and observed since ancient times, all of which also commemorate the martyrdom of Jews in those times: * Tenth of Tevet * Seventeenth of Tamuz * The Three Weeks * The Nine Days * Ninth of Av * Fast of Gedalia Maccabean Revolt and Book of Maccabees 1 Maccabees and 2 Maccabees recount numerous martyrdoms suffered by Jews resisting Hellenization, being executed for such crimes as observing the Sabbath, circumcising their children or refusing to eat pork or meat sacrificed to foreign gods. During the Maccabean Revolt from 167 to 160 BCE, during at least seven wars between the Jews and the Seleucid Greeks, tens of thousands of Jews died in battle or were killed as martyrs, including some of the original Maccabees. Some of the best known Jewish martyrs of this period is the story of the woman with seven sons and Eleazar (2 Maccabees). The Jewish holiday of Hanukkah commemorates and celebrates the miracle of the triumph of the Jews against the ancient Greeks and of Judaism and Torah over classical Greek culture. A number of Maccabees died as martyrs. Judah Maccabee, the leader of the Jewish revolt against the Seleucid Greeks was killed in the Battle of Elasa (160 BCE) and together with his men, they died as martyrs. Jonathan Maccabee was captured by a Seleucid king and executed. Eleazar Maccabee was killed in the Battle of Beth Zechariah (162 BCE). Simon Maccabee was assassinated in 135 BCE. Jewish-Roman Wars and the destruction of the Second Temple Martyrdom of Jews is a prominent aspect of the three major Jewish- Roman wars fought between the Jews in and out of ancient Judea and the Roman Empire in 66 CE to 136 CE that resulted in between one to two million Jewish casualties who are regarded as Jewish martyrs, such as Lulianos and Paphos. Among other massacres Jews were massacred during the Alexandrian riots (38) and later during the Jewish revolt against Constantius Gallus (351-352). During the Roman Siege of Jerusalem (70 CE) alone, according to Josephus, over one millions Jews died. In Judaism and Jewish liturgy, recounting the killing of the Ten Martyrs, as taught in Midrash Eleh Ezkerah, by the Romans is considered by many a solemn high point of the Yom Kippur prayer service. The most prominent of these martyrs was Rabbi Akiva, the famous Talmudic sage. Jews and Judaism commemorate the tragedies leading up to and including the destruction of the Second Temple, its catastrophic aftermath, and the martyrdom of so many, on the solemn fast day of Tisha B'Av. Under the Byzantines The Jewish revolt against Heraclius (602-628) during the era of the Byzantines resulted in the deaths and martyrdom of thousands of Jews. See the section Jewish revolt against Heraclius: Massacre of the Jews as one example. Under Christianity There have been times of great upheaval between Jews and Christians and hence between Judaism and Christianity starting from the inception of Christianity as a religion independent and apart from its Judaic roots. This has resulted in the death and martyrdom of countless Jews and Jewish communities dating from Roman times to the present as outlined in the various sections of this article. Crusades The Crusades took place from the 11th to the 17th century during which time tens of thousands of Jews were martyred. Rabbi Ephraim of Bonn (1132-1196) chronicled the fate of Jewish communities in Germany, France and England from 1146 to 1196. Examples of this are: =Germany= :See History of the Jews in Germany: A period of massacres (1096-1349) Jews burned alive for the alleged host desecration in Deggendorf, Bavaria, in 1338, and in Sternberg, Mecklenburg, in 1492; a woodcut from the Nuremberg Chronicle (1493) There are testimonies about these events such as the Solomon bar Simson Chronicle, the Eliezer ben Nathan Chronicle, Mainz Anonymous Chronicle. During the Rhineland massacres (1096) and the Worms massacre (1096) thousands of Jews were martyred notable amongst them was Kalonymus ben Meshullam and his sons (died 1096) and Minna of Worms (died 1096). A special Hebrew prayer, Av HaRachamim (\\"Father [of] Mercy\\") still recited in Ashkenazi synagogues today was composed commemorating the Jewish martyrs resulting from the First Crusade (1096-1099). The Rintfleisch massacres (1298) notably Mordechai ben Hillel (1250-1298). Erfurt massacre (1349) notably Alexander Suslin (died 1349). =England= :See History of the Jews in England (1066‚Äì1290) There were massacres of Jews and their subsequent martyrdom in London, where Jacob of Orleans was murdered in 1189, and York, where notable victims were Rabbi Yom Tov of Joigny and Josce of York both of whom died in 1190. The hatred of Jews in England culminated with the Edict of Expulsion of 1290. =France= Crusaders led by Peter the Hermit ravaged Jewish communities in Speyer, Worms, and Mainz during the Rhineland massacres of 1096. Jews in the areas of modern-day France were subject to the Crusades and many suffered martyrdom. Historian Ephraim ben Yaakov (1132-1200) describes Crusaders' massacres of Jews, including the massacre at Blois, where approximately forty Jews were killed following an accusation of ritual murder: > As they were led forth, they were told, 'You can save your lives if you will > leave your religion and accept ours.' The Jews refused. They were beaten and > tortured to make them accept the Christian religion, but still they refused. > Rather, they encouraged each other to remain steadfast and die for the > sanctification of God's Name.Chabad.org Spain and the Inquisition Jews who refused to convert to Christianity or leave Spain were called heretics and would be burned to death on a stake. There were many instances of anti-Jewish violence under both the Muslim and Christian regimes in Spain with the subsequent killing and martyrdom of Jews, such as the. Sacks of C√≥rdoba (1009‚Äì13), 1066 Granada massacre and the Massacre of 1391. Some examples of martyred famous Jews are Israel Alnaqua (died 1391) in Toledo and Joseph ibn Shem-Tov (died 1480). During the Spanish Inquisition, many of those who were executed were Jews who refused to convert to Christianity. The status of those crypto-Jews who had pretended to adopt Christianity in an attempt to avoid persecution is unclear in Jewish Law that forbids Apostasy in Judaism under all circumstances. True adherents of Judaism were expelled from Spain following the Alhambra Decree of 1492 while remaining in Spain would mean death and martyrdom. Maria Barbara Carillo (1625-1721) was burned at the stake for seeking to return to Judaism. Blood libels and scapegoating Jews were falsely accused of anti-Christian or anti-Muslim acts and activities and were often scapegoated and consequently thousands of Jews were killed and martyred over many centuries. Examples are the Brussels massacre (1370), 1910 Shiraz blood libel, Kunmadaras pogrom (1946). During the Khmelnytsky Uprising The Khmelnytsky Uprising was known to Jews as Gezeiras Tach VeTat, meaning the \\"Decree of [years] 408 and 409\\" (corresponding to 1648 and 1649). Some historians estimate that between 100,000 and 500,000 Jews were slaughtered during the Khmelnytsky Uprising from 1648 to 1658. See the section Khmelnytsky Uprising: Jews for an outline of the discussion about the actual numbers of Jews killed by the Cossacks. Notable martyrs of this period include Rabbi Yechiel Michel ben Eliezer (died 1648) who is also known as the Martyr of Nemirov. Rabbi Samson ben Pesah Ostropoli (died 1648) was martyred together with 300 of his followers. Pogroms =Black Death= During the time of the Black Death in the mid-1300s, Jews in Europe were scapegoated and martyred by the thousands. Notable were the Strasbourg massacre and the Basel massacre of 1349 and the Erfurt massacre (1349). =Russian Empire= Photo believed to show the victims, mostly Jewish children, of a 1905 pogrom in Yekaterinoslav (today's Dnipro) Jews with bodies of their comrades killed in Odessa during the Russian revolution of 1905. The modern notion of Pogroms began mostly in the Russian Empire during the early 19th century, beginning with the Odessa pogroms. Over more than a hundred years, tens of thousands of innocent Jewish civilians, men women and children were massacred by rampaging mobs. Those who were murdered in this barbaric fashion are regarded as Jewish martyrs. The Pogroms overlap with the beginnings of the Holocaust as well as happening during and after the Holocaust. The 1991 Crown Heights riot in Brooklyn, New York is regarded as a latter day Pogrom that resulted in the killing of Yankel Rosenbaum and another man who looked like a Hasidic Jew. The Holocaust The murdered approximately six million Jews who died during the Holocaust during the period of the Second World War are regarded as martyrs by most Jewish religious scholars. In Hebrew they are referred to as kedoshim (\\"holy ones\\") who died al kiddush Hashem (\\"for [the] sanctification [of] God's name\\"). Some famous rabbis who chose martyrdom al Kiddush Hashem (\\"for the sanctification of God's Name\\") immediately before they were murdered by the Nazis include Avraham Yitzchak Bloch, Elchonon Wasserman, Azriel Rabinowitz, Kalonymus Kalman Shapira, Menachem Ziemba, and Ben Zion Halberstam. The State of Israel has instituted a Holocaust Memorial Day known as Yom HaShoah (\\"Day [of] the Holocaust\\") in Hebrew, to memorialize the six million Jewish martyrs murdered by the Nazis and their cohorts. There are various religious observances and liturgy. Other nations have various other Holocaust Memorial Days such as Days of Remembrance of the Victims of the Holocaust in the United States. Under Islam Many Jews have perished and been martyred during the rise, and under the rule, of Islam in various countries such as the destruction of the Banu Qurayza (627 CE) in Saudi Arabia, the 1066 Granada massacre in Spain, during the Mawza Exile (1679-1680 CE) in Yemen, in Allahdad (1839 CE) in Persia, during the Farhud (1941 CE) in Iraq, in the 1945 Anti-Jewish riots in Tripolitania in Libya, the 1948 Anti-Jewish riots in Oujda and Jerada in Morocco. For more examples see Anti-Jewish pogroms by Muslims. =Muslims and the Holocaust= Haj Amin al-Husseini meeting with Adolf Hitler (28 November 1941). During the Second World War, some Muslim leaders such as Amin al- Husseini colluded with the Nazis and hence contributed to the Holocaust and hence to Jewish martyrdom. Arab-Israeli conflict There are special Jewish memorial prayers, known as hazkaras in Hebrew, (see El Malei Rachamim), that are recited in synagogues and at special gatherings for the thousands of Jewish Israeli soldiers and civilians who are regarded as martyrs (kedoshim meaning \\"holy ones\\" in Hebrew) who have been killed in the course of the Arab- Israeli conflict and the Israeli-Palestinian conflict. Modern Israel has instituted and dedicated a special day known as Yom HaZikaron (\\"Day [of] the Remembrance\\") in memory of those Jews killed in the service of building up and defending the state of Israel as well as in memory of those killed in terrorist attacks. Victims of Antisemitism and Anti-Judaism Jews who are murdered because of their race or religion (victims of antisemitic or anti- Judaic hate crimes), as in the 2019 Jersey City shooting, the 2019 Poway synagogue shooting, the 2018 Pittsburgh synagogue shooting, the assault against the Chabad house at Nariman House in India (one of the 2008 Mumbai attacks), the 1946 Kielce pogrom, are all regarded as martyrs by most Jewish religious scholars, and they are known as kedoshim (\\"holy ones\\") in Hebrew, Jews who have died al kiddush Hashem (\\"for [the] sanctification [of] God's Name).

It was located at the Bader Field airport and was referred to by the same name as the airfield. It was named after the former mayor of Atlantic City Edward L. Bader, who purchased the land for the airfield. The New York Yankees held spring training at Bader Field in 1944. The Philadelphia Athletics considered using the ballpark for 1944 spring training. On November 17, 1943, Connie Mack examined Bader Field and the National Guard Armory as one possibility. But he knew the Yankees were already considering it. The A's went to McCurdy Field in Frederick, Maryland when the Yankees chose Atlantic City. The Yankees made the 300-room Senator Hotel their headquarters and practiced indoors at the Atlantic City Armory. They played their first exhibition game in Atlantic City on April 1, 1944, and beat the Philadelphia Phillies 5-1, behind a home run by Johnny Lindell. The following day, 4,000 fans saw the Yankees beat the Brooklyn Dodgers, 4‚Äì3. In 1945, the Boston Red Sox based their spring training at Ansley Park in nearby Pleasantville. The last spring exhibition played at Bader Field was a Red Sox-Yankees game on April 8, 1945. A municipal stadium, John Boyd Stadium, with a football field and track was opened at Bader Field on October 22, 1949. It stood just north of the ballpark's left-field wall and was built at a cost of $350,000. John Boyd Stadium was the home of Atlantic City High School football from 1949 until 1994, and was demolished in February 1998. In 1998, The Sandcastle baseball stadium was built at Bader Field, returning professional baseball to the airport site. The Atlantic City Surf played at the ballpark through 2008.

In Hidden Words, Bah√° ºu'll√°h's revelation incites believers towards martyrdom: \\"O son of being! Seek a martyr's death in My path, content with My pleasure [‚Ä¶] To tinge thy hair with thy blood is greater in My sight than the creation of the universe and the light of both worlds. Strive then to attain this, O servant!\\" However, Bah√° ºu'll√°h, the founder of the Bah√° º√≠ Faith, discouraged the literal meaning of sacrificing one's life, and instead offered the explanation that martyrdom is devoting oneself to service for humanity.  ªAbdu'l-Bah√°, Bah√° ºu'll√°h's son and appointed interpreter, explained that the truest form of martyrdom is a lifelong sacrifice to serve humanity in the name of God. While the Bah√° º√≠ Faith exalts the station of its martyrs, martyrdom is not something that Bah√° º√≠s are encouraged to pursue; instead one is urged to value and protect one's life. In the history of the Bah√° º√≠ Faith there are many who are considered martyrs. The Bah√° º√≠ Faith grew out of a separate religion, B√°bism, which Bah√° º√≠s see as part of their own history. In B√°bism, martyrdom had the literal meaning of sacrificing one's life and was seen as a public declaration of sincerity and devotion to God. During the 1840s and 1850s the B√°b claimed to be the return of the Mahdi and gained a strong following. The Persian clergy tried to stop the spread of the B√°b√≠ movement by denouncing the B√°b√≠s as apostates; these denouncements led to public executions of the B√°b√≠s, troop engagements against the B√°b√≠s, and an extensive pogrom where thousands of B√°b√≠s were killed. In addition, the B√°b himself was publicly executed in 1850. The B√°b√≠s that were killed during these times are seen as martyrs by Bah√° º√≠s, and the date of execution of the B√°b, who Bah√° º√≠s see as a Manifestation of God equal to that of Bah√° ºu'll√°h, is considered a holy day in the Bah√° º√≠ calendar as the Martyrdom of the B√°b. Also among the B√°b√≠ executions was the poet T√°hirih, one of the B√°b's eighteen disciples, who Bah√° º√≠s consider the first woman suffrage martyr. After Bah√° ºu'll√°h abstracted the meaning of martyrdom, gave it a new meaning, and abolished holy war, the B√°b√≠s who became Bah√° º√≠s stopped seeking martyrdom as a public declaration of devotion. An early sequence of incidents with the religion in the West related to martyrdom begins in 1901. A small group of women sought a diplomatic intervention to a particular wave of persecutions. This did not lead to fruition. However a significant step forward was then undertaken by Lua Getsinger. In her fervor to become a martyr for the religion like T√°hirih she enlisted two friends to pray for her with B√°b√≠ prayers and asked  ªAbdu'l-Bah√° to grant her request on her behalf.  ªAbdu'l-Bah√°'s response paraphrased was that martyrdom was a high station which Bah√° ºu'll√°h conferred on whomever he chose and that the physical fact of being killed was not the point, for there were those who had not been killed but were counted as martyrs, and also those who had been killed but who had not attained the station of a martyr. The essence of martyrdom was service, and she had, \\"thanks be to God\\", arisen to serve. Documentation is lacking but somehow a particular mission came to mind.  ªAbdu'l-Bah√° saw the time, place, and person of Lua appropriate to the task. On July 5, 1902, Lua got a passport in her own name in New York. Lua was then France before September 28.Kindle:4359 She was there to present a petition to Mozaffar ad- Din Shah Qajar, then ruler of Iran, with Mariam Haney, while he was in Paris.She was not immediately welcomed. Lua began prolonged prayer vigils to be allowed to present a petition in person. assisted Lua by translating the petition into French, and to gain an audience,Kindle:3200 and, refusing to be put off by his Grand Vizier, Lua finally met directly with the Shah himself. The petition was primarily that he protect the Bah√° º√≠s of Persia from the persecution that was going on. ‚Äú‚Ä¶in the grand reception hall of the Elysee Palace hotel where the entire suite of one hundred and fifty Persians were awaiting His Majesty, this one American woman, the only woman in this large group of men, stepped forward and handed to His Majesty the petition she had faithfully written. Lua also delivered a forceful speech suggesting that such 'uncivilized' cruelty was shaming Persia, and that if the mull√°s examined the history of Islam, 'they would soon see that the shedding of blood is not a means of annulling, but rather the cause of promulgating every religious movement.' Lua then told the assembled men a heartrending story of a woman whose husband, brother and eleven year-old son were viciously killed by mobs, and when the woman 'throws herself upon their mangled corpses' she 'is beaten into insensibility'. Lua asked the Shah, '‚Ä¶is it justice on the part of your Majesty to allow such heinous crimes to go unpunished?\\"‚Ä¶ For the sake of justice, in large part for women, [Lua] boldly puts herself forward to stand alone in a group of men against the orthodoxy of the mullahs and the state, ‚Ä¶ considered of little account, and, moreover, a western woman, stereotypically morally suspect in eastern male eyes‚Ä¶, considered ritually 'unclean' by Muslims, and worse, a Bah√° º√≠, maligned in Persia ‚Ä¶ relied only on words, ‚Ä¶[her] 'motherhood'[, h]er irresistible charm, her remarkable gifts as a teacher, her forceful character and unique personality‚Ä¶.\\" The Shah agreed to intercede on behalf of the Bah√° º√≠s though conditions in Iran only subsided a few years. Bah√° º√≠s continued to be persecuted in predominantly Muslim countries, like Morocco in 1962-3 and especially in Iran where over 200 Bah√° º√≠s were executed between 1978 and 1998. Among these executions include two sets of nine people who were part of the National Spiritual Assembly of the Bah√° º√≠s of Iran, the national governing body of the Bah√° º√≠s, who were arrested and killed solely for their religious beliefs. Such deaths are also considered martyrdom. Mona Mahmudnizhad, one of the martyrs, is the subject of the Mark Perry play A Dress for Mona and Doug Cameron's song \\"Mona With the Children\\".

Its purpose is to engage the drive train of an automobile without introducing shock to the drive train components by engaging too quickly. By preventing drive train shock, CDVs also prevent an automobile's balance from being upset, which aids in handling characteristics. Clutch delay valves operate on the principle that engagement only needs to occur at a certain rate to be efficient and that engaging at a quicker rate can damage the drive train components of an automobile. Engaging the drive train to the engine too quickly can damage drive train parts, including the transmission, differential, half shafts, axles, and CV joints. Engaging the drive train too slowly can damage the clutch friction disc and cause clutch slippage. Clutch delay valves operate as one-way restrictor valves that limit the volume of fluid that can move through the lines in a given time. This ensures a steady quick and firm engagement without being too fast for the drive train to handle since clutches can quickly disengage but re-engagement is damped. The clutch delay valve slows clutch engagement and was intended to reduce drivetrain shock in the event that an inexperienced driver quickly engaged the clutch at higher revs. BMW have used clutch delay valves on the E39 and E46 models, and others, from 1997. These valves have been unpopular with some drivers and they are sometimes removed to leave a conventional clutch action. The BMW valve is a separate pipe fitting and easily removed. Honda have also used such valves on some Civic models, but these are integral to the clutch slave cylinder and must be dismantled in situ.

It is the third generation iPhone and the successor to the iPhone 3G. It was unveiled on June 8, 2009 at the WWDC 2009 which took place at the Moscone Center in San Francisco. This iPhone is named \\"3GS\\" where \\"S\\" stood for Speed (Phil Schiller had mentioned it in the launch keynote). Improvements include performance, a 3-megapixel camera with higher resolution and video ability, voice control, and support for 7.2 Mbit/s HSDPA downloading (but remains limited to uploading as Apple had not implemented the HSUPA protocol). It was released in the United States, Canada, and six European countries on June 19, 2009, in Australia and Japan on June 26, and internationally in July and August 2009. The iPhone 3GS runs Apple's iOS operating system. It was succeeded as Apple's flagship smartphone in 2010 by the iPhone 4. On June 24, 2010 an 8GB model was released, discontinuing the 16 and 32GB models. However, the 3GS continued in production until September 2012 when the iPhone 5 was announced. History The iPhone 3GS was released on June 19, 2009 in the United States, Canada, France, Germany, Italy, Spain, Switzerland, and the United Kingdom. Within the first weekend of its release, over one million (1,000,000) iPhone 3GS units were sold. It reached its first million units sold as quickly as its predecessor, the iPhone 3G. Features The new features of the iPhone 3GS are mainly internal changes regarding speed. The iPhone 3GS is 2x faster than its predecessor. Though in addition to the upgrades mainly regarding performance, various software features were also introduced exclusively to the iPhone 3GS such as video recording, voice control, and digital compass. =Operating system and software= The features iOS, Apple's mobile operating system. The user interface of iOS is based on the concept of direct manipulation, using multi-touch gestures. Interface control elements consist of sliders, switches, and buttons. Interaction with the OS includes gestures such as swipe, tap, pinch, and reverse pinch, all of which have specific definitions within the context of the iOS operating system and its multi-touch interface. Internal accelerometers are used by some applications to respond to shaking the device (one common result is the undo command) or rotating it vertically (one common result is switching from portrait to landscape mode). =Hardware= The LCD display on the device was designed by Apple and made by LG. It features a capacitive touchscreen with a pixel density of 163 pixels per inch (ppi) on a 480-by-320 display. Improvements over its predecessor's screen include 24-bit color emulation (18-bit color display plus dithering) for a more color rich display and oleophobic coating to help reduce fingerprints on the display. The capacitive touchscreen is designed for a bare finger, or multiple fingers for multi-touch sensing. The iPhone 3GS features an improved 3-megapixel camera manufactured by OmniVision. In addition to the higher pixel count, it also features auto- focus, auto white balance and auto macro and is capable of capturing VGA video. The iPhone 3GS's camera app features a slider which allows users to switch between capturing photos and recording videos, a tap-to-focus feature which allows users to tap on an area of the camera image to auto-focus on, 5x digital zoom (iOS 4 or later), autofocus and auto exposure lock when holding an area down (iOS 5 or later), and gridlines for composition (iOS 5 or later). The iPhone 3GS is powered by the Samsung APL0298C05 chip, which was designed and manufactured by Samsung. This is the first iPhone with a system-on-a-chip. This system-on-a-chip is composed of an ARM Cortex-A8 CPU core underclocked to 600 MHz (from 833 MHz), integrated with a PowerVR SGX 535 GPU. It has 256 MB of package on package (PoP) DRAM, twice the amount of the 3G, allowing for increased performance and multi-tasking. Apple claims the iPhone 3GS is 2x faster than its predecessor, showing demonstrations of various apps loading in half the time its predecessor does. As on previous models, all data is stored in flash memory and not in the SIM and it does not offer any options to expand storage. Initially, it was only available in 16 and 32 GB though an 8 GB model was later released, with Apple discontinuing the 16 and 32 GB models, forcing those needing more storage to select an iPhone 4, or buy an older model 3GS. The iPhone 3GS is powered by an internal 3.7 V 1220 mAh rechargeable lithium- ion polymer battery and is designed to retain up to 80% of its original capacity after 400 full charge and discharge cycles. A battery life indicator in percentage was also exclusive to the iPhone 3GS. Apple claims that the 3GS can last for up to ten hours of video, nine hours of web browsing on Wi-Fi, twelve hours of 2G talk time, or five on 3G, 30 hours of music, or 300 hours of standby. A magnetometer is also built-in the iPhone 3GS, which is used to measure the strength and/or direction of the magnetic field in the vicinity of the device. Sometimes certain devices or radio signals can interfere with the magnetometer requiring users to either move away from the interference or re- calibrate by moving the device in a figure 8 motion. The iPhone 3GS also features a Compass app that was unique at the time of release, showing a compass that points in the direction of the magnetic field. In addition to the iPhone 3G's Tri-band UMTS/HSDPA radio and quad-band GSM/GPRS/EDGE radio, the 3GS also adds support for 7.2 Mbit/s HSDPA allowing faster downlink speeds though upload speeds remain the same as Apple had not implemented the HSUPA protocol. Other updates include the addition of a built-in Nike+iPod sensor which eliminates the need for an external sensor and allows native Nike+iPod support. The Bluetooth server on the iPhone 3GS has also been slightly improved adding support for Bluetooth 2.1 specifications. Voice Control was introduced as an exclusive feature of the iPhone 3GS and allows for the controlling of the phone and music features of the phone by voice. There are two ways to activate Voice Control: hold the Home button while in the home screen for a few seconds; or, change the effect of what double-clicking the home button does so it will activate Voice Control (only on iOS 3.x; on iOS 4 or later, double-clicking the Home button opens the multitasking bar). VoiceOver, Color Inversion, and Text Zoom were introduced as exclusive features to the iPhone 3GS. VoiceOver is a feature that dictates music details, system menus, text, and other things that were first introduced on the third generation iPod shuffle. Color inversion reverses the color scheme from black on white to white on black, while Text Zoom allows users to zoom into a text on the screen. The reverse of the iPhone 3G (left) is almost identical to that of the 3GS, except for the latter's reflective silver text which now matches the silver Apple logo, replacing the 3G's grey text. The iPhone 3GS retains the design of the 3G, with a glossy plastic back with tapered edges and metal buttons. The 3GS has reflective silver text on the reverse side which matches the silver Apple logo, replacing the 3G's grey text. The iPhone 3GS was available in white and black for 16 GB and 32 GB, although the 8 GB model was only available in black. Critical reception Reviews of the iPhone 3GS have been mixed. Walt Mossberg of The Wall Street Journal described the device packed with \\"new features that makes a great product even better, but for many users, the software may be enough of a boost to keep them from buying the new model.\\" Engadget also said that \\"the additions of video recording, a compass, and a speed bump just don't seem that compelling to us.\\" The device managed to receive numerous favorable reviews. CNET gave the iPhone 3GS 4 out of 5 stars, citing battery life improvements and speed bump. Engadget praised the performance improvements. The 8 GB version received more favorable reviews mainly because it comes pre-installed with iOS 4. Jason Snell of Macworld praised the iPhone 3GS, saying that \\"the device's internal changes shines in the iOS 4 update, making the iPhone 3GS a worthwhile upgrade compared to its predecessor although a little too late compared to the iPhone 4.\\" TIPB stated that \\"aside from hardware-specific features like FaceTime, Retina Display, and gyroscope support, the bottom line is iPhone 3GS users are getting the same software that makes the iPhone 4 great.\\" Issues Shortly after the release of the iPhone 3GS, some users reported overheating of the device while in heavy use, and others reported discoloration of the device due to heat (particularly on the white models). The discoloration issues were largely discounted as being as a result of iPhone covers rubbing against the back of the iPhone. Apple responded to the heat issue reports by warning users against leaving their iPhones in a car on a hot day, leaving it in direct sunlight for extended periods of time, and refraining from heavy usage while in a hot/sunny environment. It is also worth pointing out the temperature specifications in which the iPhone should be operated, which follows safety standards in the countries the 3GS was released. Continued support = iOS 4 = After the release of the iPhone 4, the iPhone 3GS received an update for iOS 4. =iOS 5= After the release of the iPhone 4S, the 3GS was still offered for free on a contract until November 2011, when AT&T; raised the price to 59 cents with no explanation. The 99¬¢ price was only available with a two-year contract on AT&T; in the United States and a three-year contract on Telus, Rogers, Bell and Fido Solutions in Canada. This was a departure from Apple's previous trends, in which only two phones were sold. =New bootrom and 2011 baseband update= On September 9, 2009, Apple launched an updated model of the iPhone 3GS that patched a segment overflow in the SecureROM of the Device that had allowed loading an unsigned LLB. After the release of the iPhone 4S, Apple updated baseband hardware from an Infineon Baseband chip to a Toshiba Baseband chip in week 2 production in 2011 which removed the end-user's ability to change basebands. Although the new chip uses the same modem firmware as the Infineon chip, it cannot be updated to iPad baseband 06.15.00 that is still vulnerable to the AT+XAPP exploit. =iOS 6= The 3GS received iOS 6, making it the first iOS device to receive updates for four major iOS releases. Although the 3GS was still supported, some major features of iOS 6 were not supported. The 3GS had generally positive reviews of smooth performance on iOS 5 (some even claim better performance), making it still a good candidate for iOS 6. On September 12, 2012, Apple announced that they would no longer be selling and supporting the iPhone 3GS and the device did not receive iOS 7, due to hardware limitations. On February 21, 2014, Apple issued iOS 6.1.6 to fix the infamous \\"goto fail;\\" SSL security bug.

The film is based on the novel Cecilia Vald√©s by Cirilo Villaverde. It was entered into the 1982 Cannes Film Festival. Plot The film takes place in 19th-century Cuba. Cuban society is split over race, as there are deep divisions between the whites, their black slaves, and the mulattos, people of mixed race, that are caught in between. The story follows Cecilia (Daisy Granados), her experiences with love, and the beginnings of the Cuban slave rebellion.Answers.com Cast * Daisy Granados * Imanol Arias * Raquel Revuelta * Miguel Benavides * Eslinda N√∫√±ez Critical reception Sol√°s's 1982 megaproduction, the most expensive project undertaken by ICAIC to date, was released simultaneously as a six-hour miniseries for Spanish television, a four-hour motion picture for Cuban audiences, and a two-hour film for international release. According to Michael Chanan, \\"no Cuban film ever prodded a raw nerve more insistently that this one, revealing in the process the dangers of interfering with certain types of cultural icons.\\" Chanan, Michael. Cuban Cinema. Minneapolis: U Minn. Press, 2004. 380. Critics were unanimous in their outrage and disgust at Sol√°s's versi√≥n libre of a canonical work and, yet, Sol√°s consistently spoke of Cecilia as a successful film in personal terms until his death in 2008. Sol√°s erased the most shocking element of the novel - that, unbeknownst to them, Cecilia and Leonardo were sister and brother and, thus, incestuous lovers - and inserted, instead, a subtext that emphasizes Santer√≠a as the force that shapes the destiny of the characters. While the film shares with the novel an abolitionist stance and an abhorrence of the racist practices that permeated colonial Cuban society, it highlights the importance of religious syncretism and transculturation in a way that Villaverde's work could not. Sol√°s's film is a 20th-century response to a canonical text, grounded in the teachings of Fernando Ortiz, Lydia Cabrera, Natalia Bol√≠var, Miguel Barnet and other scholars who claim that Afro-Cuban culture is an integral part of Cuban national identity. By bringing Santer√≠a into the open and casting Cecilia as a practitioner of it, Sol√°s makes visible that which was invisible in the 19th century novel. He resurrects the belief system of Villaverde's black and mulatto characters, making it central to the plot of his film and drawing clear parallels between it and Catholicism as contentious systems of reference in colonial society. Equally important, the projection of a religious theme on to a 19th-century-storyline allows Sol√°s to look at something suppressed and driven underground in Cuba at the time his film was made: the continued presence of Santer√≠a as an undercurrent in contemporary Cuban culture and its power to subvert dominant paradigms. It was this aspect of the film that agitated and inflamed critics like Mario Rodr√≠guez Alem√°n, who called the ending of the film \\"repulsive,\\" condemned it for its \\"excessive religious charge,\\" the predominance of the \\"sacred,\\" and \\"the priority given to myth, oneiricism, mysticism, and folklore,\\" which relegated \\"the political and social connotations of Villaverde's original to the background.\\"Chanan, Michael.

It is a member of the Network of African National Human Rights Institutions and is accredited at the United Nations through the International Co-ordinating Committee of NHRIs. Constitutional powers Article 33 of the constitution of 1999 created an official Commission to investigate and report upon human rights abuses. Its members are elected from several human rights associations, legal bodies, and government offices. The Committee is composed of 19 members, elected for three-year terms by a variety of bodies set out in the constitution. It has no power to arrest, but it may investigate abuses either on its own volition or when charged by a victim. It reports to the President of Niger.Niger:Country Reports on Human Rights Practices, 2001. United States Bureau of Democracy, Human Rights, and Labor. March 4, 2002Niger:Country Reports on Human Rights Practices, 2008. United States Bureau of Democracy, Human Rights, and Labor. February 25, 2009 Establishment The article which created the Commission on Human Rights was actually first created in the 1996 Constitution of the Fourth Republic of Niger (as Article 33), and its creation was passed into law by decree 98-55 of 29 December 1998. Before the Commission was created, President Ibrahim Bar√© Ma√Ønassara was overthrown and killed on 9 April 1999, and the Fourth Republic's constitution suspended. The July 1999 constitution of the Fifth Republic of Niger included identical wording mandating the Commission on Human Rights.Binaifer Nowrojee, Human Rights Watch/Africa. Protectors Or Pretenders?: Government Human Rights Commissions in Africa. Human Rights Watch, (2001) p.58. The commission was first established in March 2000. In 2000 the Commission published what the United States called \\"a credible, well-researched report\\" on the 2000 case of two army sergeants, who disappeared after they were arrested by other soldiers for their alleged involvement in the June 2000 kidnapping and disappearance of Major Djibrilla Hima, the commander of the army's only armor squadron. In late May 2001, the 18 other soldiers arrested for suspected involvement in the kidnapping were released pending further investigation; however, it is unknown if any action was taken against the soldiers who allegedly beat and tortured 3 of the detained soldiers in 2000. The prosecutor with overall responsibility for the kidnapping case investigated the torture and disappearance allegations; however, he was removed from the case in mid-2000 following a month of intensive investigation, and there was no further investigation into the incident. Also during its first year, the Commission issued a report that found that the Government violated laws and regulations concerning traditional chiefs when it removed the Sultan of Zinder. Elements of civil society successfully opposed a government attempt to alter the composition of the Commission during 2001, but it was eventually restructured in 2002 to include greater government representation by adding civil servants from the Ministries of Justice, Interior, Social Development, and Labor to the Commission and reducing the representation from civil society organizations.Niger:Country Reports on Human Rights Practices, 2007. United States Bureau of Democracy, Human Rights, and Labor. March 11, 2008 Lompo chairmanship Garba Lompo was elected as the commission's Chairperson in 2001, and re-elected in 2004. His tenure was marked by foreign criticism of the work of the commission. When Timidria, an anti-slavery group, attempted to organize a ceremony to liberate 7,000 slaves in Inat√®s in early 2005, the CNDHLF said that the group should instead characterize the ceremony as a \\"campaign for public awareness and popularisation of the law criminalising slave practices\\". At the ceremony, held on 4-5 March 2005, CNDHLF President Lompo was present and stated that \\"any attempt to free slaves in the country [remained] illegal and unacceptable\\"; he also said that \\"any person celebrating a slave liberation [would] be punished under the law\\". In its report released on 28 April 2005, the CNDHLF stated that slavery did not exist in the area and accused those who spread the slavery \\"rumours\\" of secretly working to \\"tarnish the image of the country\\" and deter donors. In its recommendations, the CNDHLF report called for the arrest of Timidria leaders (two of them were arrested on the day of the report's release), the dissolution of the organization and the freezing of its bank accounts. Lombo urged the Interior Ministry to \\"ensure a more regular monitoring of NGOs and associations activities in the country\\".\\"Observatory for the Protection of Human Rights Defenders Annual Report 2005 - Niger\\", International Federation for Human Rights (UNHCR.org), 22 March 2006. Later in 2005, Lompo said that \\"slavery doesn't exist\\" in Niger. The remaining social relationships that could be classified as slavery were effectively voluntary arrangements, based on tradition and continued because the slaves felt \\"at ease with the master\\", according to Lompo.Robyn Dixon, \\"Secret Lives of Servitude in Niger\\", Los Angeles Times, 3 September 2005. On 14 September 2006, Lompo addressed the United Nations General Assembly meeting on the High- level Dialogue on International Migration and Development.\\"Niger Addresses General Assembly Meeting on International Migration and Development\\", UN.org, Photo # 124761, 14 September 2006. He announced on 9 November 2007 that the government had initiated a probe to determine whether slavery actually existed or \\"whether these are just baseless allegations\\".\\"Niger launches slavery probe\\" , AFP (Clutchmagonline.com), 10 November 2007.

By 2007 government-established National Commission on Human Rights and Fundamental Liberties operated without government interference but lacked resources, was generally considered ineffective, and issued few reports or recommendations. During 2007 new commission elections were held but controversy over the selection process continued, with representatives of two human rights associations contesting each other's participation. The government attempted to mediate the controversy, but one of the groups requested the Supreme Court's arbitration, while representatives of the second group had assumed seats on the commission.Niger:Country Reports on Human Rights Practices, 2004.

The first science flight of Sunrise yielded high-quality data that reveal the structure, dynamics and evolution of solar convection, oscillations and magnetic fields at a resolution of around 100 km in the quiet Sun. Overview The strong absorption of UV radiation by the Earth's atmosphere makes it challenging to carry out ground-based observations at these wavelengths. A balloon mission reaching altitudes of above 30 km benefits from a reduction of UV absorption by 99%, making engineering solutions for the telescope easier. The launch site was in the arctic region to make uninterrupted observation of the Sun over several days possible. The telescope has a 1 metre primary mirror that directs the 1 kW of solar radiation to the first focal point where 99% of the radiation is reflected out of the telescope, the remaining light is transferred into several instruments. The one metre diameter primary mirror is made from a glass ceramic zerodur, it is the central part of the gondola of nearly 2 tons. Solar panels of 1.5 kW output power are used to power the onboard equipment and a hard disk array of 2 x 2.4 Terabyte is used to store the data during flight.

It was discovered in November 1890 by the American astronomer Edward Emerson Barnard, who described it as \\"a new and comparatively bright round cometary nebula close south and following Merope (23 Tau) ... about 30\\" in diameter, of the 13 (magnitude), gradually brighter in the middle, and very cometary in appearance.‚Äù The British astronomer Charles Pritchard, however, disputed Barnard's discovery announcement, claiming to have discovered it himself on a photographic plate obtained at Oxford on 29 January 1889. Pritchard dismissed IC 349 as an \\"apparently insignificant fleck,\\" dismissing a distinct identity for the object and instead regarding it simply as the brightest part of the broader reflection nebulosity enveloping the Pleiades. Sherburne Wesley Burnham agreed with Barnard's estimation of the importance of the nebula, calling it \\"far more interesting than any of the nebulae heretofore discovered in the Pleiades by visual and photographic method\\" and \\"one of the most singular objects in the heavens.\\" Burnham further speculated as to whether IC 349 was kinematically related to the Pleiades, suggesting that its proper motion might provide a definitive answer. IC 349 may be an example of a cold, dense, very small-scale condensation of the interstellar medium. Morphologically, it appears to have a roughly pentagonal shape with a bright knot situated closest to Merope. This knot was examined for evidence of an embedded protostar, but none was found to a luminosity upper limit of 0.23 ¬± 0.05 times the luminosity of the Sun. This implies an upper limit of 0.15 times the mass of the Sun for a deuterium-burning protostar embedded in the knot, whose existence is further rendered dubious by a lack of emission lines characteristic of pre‚ÄìMain Sequence stars in its optical spectrum. Further searches in the near-infrared also failed to show any evidence of an embedded protostar in the bright knot, showing only wavelength-dependent scattering of light consistent with the presence of very fine dust particles. Analysis of the nebula's space motion indicate it does not share the velocity and direction of the Pleiades, suggesting a chance encounter between the objects. Because IC 349 shares the velocity of molecular gas in the nearby Taurus Molecular Cloud complex, it may have originated there. IC 349 is now sufficiently close to Merope that its envelope is undergoing disruption by either the star's radiation pressure, a stellar wind, or both.

She was the principal founder and executive director of Catholics in Alliance for the Common Good. Education and career Kelley graduated with a B.A. in Religion with honors from Haverford College in 1989. Her thesis focused on the writings and speeches of the Quaker abolitionist and suffragist Lucretia Mott. After college, she worked at the Friends Committee on National Legislation (FCNL) in Washington, D.C., a Quaker social justice lobby and one of the oldest ecumenical lobby organizations in the United States. From there, she attended Harvard Divinity School, graduating in 1993 with a Master of Theological Studies. Following graduate school, Kelley worked for the Catholic Campaign for Human Development, a national Catholic anti- poverty initiative, for nearly a decade. During her tenure at CCHD, Kelley co- edited Living the Catholic Social Tradition: Cases and Commentary with Dr. Kathleen Maas Weigert. The book profiles community organizing projects across the country that had received support from CCHD, and it explores the principles of the Catholic social tradition that undergird support and participation in such projects. Following her tenure at CCHD, Kelley worked for three years at Environmental Resources Trust (ERT), a business unit of the non-profit organization Winrock International dedicated to promoting renewable energy development and climate change mitigation. There she worked on renewable energy policy and development projects, including a partnership between ERT and Verdant Power.

This high density of the population is the result of the fertile soil found in the sector. The main economic activity is agriculture. Beans, maize, peanuts, sorghum, pineapples are grown there. The sector contains large banana plantations. As part of the Umutara region, the sector is also known for cattle husbandry. Gatunda Sector is divided into seven cells: Nyangara, Nyarurema, Cyagaju, Rwensheke, Nyamikamba, Nyamirembe and Kabeza. The office of Gatunda Sector is located in Nyamirembe Cell in the extreme North East section of the Sector. Gatunda is mainly a rural sector. It is however very densely populated with 535 inhabitants per square kilometer, which is the double of Nyagatare District density, and higher than the national population density. Major settlements in the sectors are Muhambo and Ku Muhanda in Nyangara; Nyarurema, Buguma and Shabana in Nyarurema cell; and Kirindimure in Nyamirembe cell.

He came from a large and fervent Latin rite Catholic family. He entered the Assumptionist high school seminary in Adrianopolis and entered the Assumptionist novitiate in Phanaraki, Turkey in 1900. His name in religion was Josaphat. He was ordained a priest in the Latin rite in Malines, Belgium, in 1909 after studying philosophy and theology at Louvain University. Once back in Bulgaria, he taught at St. Augustine College in Plovdiv and at St. Michael College in Varna. Later he moved to Yambol where he served as superior and rector of the high school seminary of Saints Cyril and Methodius, as pastor of the local Latin rite parish, and as chaplain to the Oblate Sisters of the Assumption. In 1937 he returned to the college in Varna where he served as rector and teacher until he was arrested in 1951. He was responsible for enlarging the Yambol seminary to include seminarians of both rites, Latin and Byzantine-Slav, and found ways to integrate students into one community. He organized fundraising activities for the institution and taught French to teachers, civil servants, and Bulgarian army officers. He had a particular interest in the latest technology and introduced a ham radio and movie projector at the seminary. Josaphat Chichkov was arrested in December 1951. After what international organizations universally considered a show trial which began on 29 September 1952 and ended with a guilty verdict and a death sentence on 3 October, Fr. Chickov, two of his Assumptionists companions, Fr. Kamen Vitchev and Fr. Pavel Djidjov, and a Passionist bishop, Most Rev. Eugene Bossilkov, were shot to death, without public notice, at 11:30 PM the evening of 11 November 1952. Fr. Chichkov was declared a martyr for the faith and beatified by Pope John Paul II in Plovdiv on 26 May 2002. On 28 July 2010 the Bulgarian parliament passed a law officially rehabilitating all of those who had been condemned by the People's Republic of Bulgaria in 1952, including Fr. Chichkov.

History =The founding of Woolwich Polytechnic= Woolwich Polytechnic School for Boys has its roots in the Polytechnic movement of the late 19th century. These polytechnics, of which Woolwich was the second, were set up with the aim of educating and 'improving' adult members of the working classes. Quintin Hogg, a successful London sugar merchant and philanthropist, had been involved in the ragged school movement for many years, but in 1871 focused his efforts on forming an Evening Institute for those at work in the day. This was to approach the whole person, both by education, but also by moral example, giving access to meetings, opportunities for physical activities and enriching debates. There was a strong evangelical Christian input in these aims. Hogg's early aims were realised by the establishment of the London Polytechnic at Regent Street, which was set out to improve the whole person. An early student at the Royal Polytechnic Institution at Regent Street was Francis (Frank) Didden. In 1884 Didden moved to Woolwich to take up a job as a fitter at the Royal Arsenal. He also had a burning ambition to set up a polytechnic in the Woolwich. In 1884 Woolwich had a population of about 34,000 people, many of whom were employed as engineers at the Royal Arsenal, or the other large factories in the area. Despite its industries Woolwich had many slums, drunkenness was widespread, and many jobs offered little or no real security. For many people a lack of education and dissolute habits prevented them from \\"getting on\\". Didden saw a polytechnic as a way forward, and in 1886 he asked Hogg for support (Hogg had founded a ragged school in Castle Street, Woolwich). Hogg's reply is illuminating. > ‚ÄúYou certainly require, as a minimum, a gymnasium, a few class rooms, a > reading room and a coffee bar, besides some small hall where meetings can be > held.‚Äù Didden campaigned passionately, raising some funding through a sports meeting held in July 1888 in Charlton Park, supported by the London Polytechnic, the Royal Arsenal and Royal Arsenal Co-operative Society. In 1890 T.A. Denny, a Woolwich bacon merchant, provided most of the ¬£1,000 needed to buy a house in William Street (now Calderwood Street). Woolwich Polytechnic had its foundation. It grew rapidly. In 1891 it offered 38 courses to 504 students. In 1892 there were 80 courses offered to nearly 800 students. True to Hogg's model, Didden ensured that there was a very strong sporting and social side to attract and reform the habits of members. =The school in Woolwich= Woolwich Polytechnic founded a number of day schools and junior technical schools, partly in response to the fact that much of its premises was left empty during the day as much of the teaching and activities took place in the evenings. In September 1897 a day school for boys was opened, Woolwich Polytechnic Boys Secondary School; Woolwich's first secondary school started with 72 boys.AIM 25 London Archives Woolwich Polytechnic Day Schools. Retrieved 12.05.08 Woolwich Polytechnic Junior Technical School for Boys was established in MacBean Street in 1912 to train boys for jobs at engineering works. The school became the responsibility of London County Council in 1956, as Woolwich Polytechnic Boys School. In 1974 the Poly was reorganised as a six-form entry comprehensive school spread over two sites. Years 1 and 2 (now 7 and 8) remained in MacBean Street, while the Upper School occupied the premises of the old Woolwich Central School in Sandy Hill Road. =History since 1997= In 1997 the school was designated a Technology College. The school maintained a presence in Woolwich up to 1999 when the Upper and Lower Schools were combined in the former Waterfield School buildings in Thamesmead. The Upper school site was turned into a modern apartment complex; the Lower school was demolished and the site currently stands empty. The school gained a good reputation for the quality of its pastoral care. Until the re-formation of its sixth form in 2011, it was (at 8 forms of entry) the largest all-boys 11‚Äì16 comprehensive in England. Exam results improved and the Poly was the most improved boys' school in England in 2010. Woolwich Polytechnic was inspected by Ofsted in October 2011 and judged as 'outstanding'. The school got top marks in 21 out of 24 indicators on the report. Previously a community school administered by Greenwich London Borough Council, Woolwich Polytechnic School converted to academy status on 1 August 2014. However the school continues to co-ordinate with Greenwich London Borough Council for admission. From the 2012/13 academic year the school decided to elect a Head Boy, two Deputy Head Boys and a Head Girl. These are assisted by sixth form prefects, headed by a Senior Prefect.

RK-2) was a two-seat cabin aircraft designed and built in the USSR from October 1938.  Development  In 1930 the LIIPS (Leningrad institute for sail and communications engineers) formed a UK GVF (training centre for civil air fleet), in turn the UK GVF formed the NIAI (Naoochno- Issledovatel'skiy Aero-Institoot - scientific test aero-institute) which became the focus of several good design engineers who were given command of individual OKB (Osboye Konstrooktorskoye Byuro ‚Äì personal design/construction bureau). Along with contemporary aircraft designers, in Russia and abroad, Grigorii Ivanovich Bakshayev was interested in the concept of variable geometry aircraft, where the size and/or shape of wings are altered according to the stage of flight, or desired characteristics. There are many methods of achieving this but one of the simplest is the telescopic wing, where wing sections of bigger area and, possibly, aerofoil section, are telescoped out over the original wing. Bakshayev designed the RK-I to use a telescopic wing with fifteen sections, of gradually increasing size, extending outwards from the fuselage to the demands of the pilot. The RK-I fuselage was of light-alloy semi-monocoque construction with a conventional tail unit. The retractable tail-wheel undercarriage was attached to the fuselage, giving the aircraft a very narrow track, retracting into the fuselage and covered by doors. To reduce drag the engine sat in the nose, under a closely fitting cowling, and cooling radiators sat in ducts either side of the rear fuselage fed by long pipework. The wings of the RK-I were very unusual in having tandem main- planes, used as guide tracks and supports for the hydraulically extending wing sections, which more than doubled the wing area when fully extended. The wings were of light-alloy and steel structure with 30KhGSA steel skins, only the rear wing having flaps and ailerons. Unfortunately for the RK-I Joseph Stalin was very interested in the project and insisted that the most powerful engine then available was used in the aircraft. This was the death-knell for the RK-I as the most powerful engine then available was the M-106 which was, unfortunately, a complete failure, not progressing further than bench testing. Construction of the RK-I was complete by 1940, but the aircraft remained un- flown in the workshop due to the unreliable engine.

Like abscisic acid, it is a plant hormone associated with photosynthesis arrestSharkey, T.D. \\"Effects of Phaseic Acid and Dihydrophaseic Acid on Stomata and the Photosynthetic Apparatus\\". Plant Physiol. 65(2): 291--297. and abscission. Function Abscisic acid (ABA) is a multifunctional plant hormone, playing roles in germination, seasonal growth patterns, and stress response. ABA levels are believed to be regulated in part by control of ABA catabolism, specifically by oxidation to form phaseic acid.Milborrow BV. (1969). \\"Identification of 'Metabolite C' from abscisic acid and a new structure for phaseic acid\\". Chem Commun 966-967. Phaseic acid can therefore be thought of as a degradation product of ABA, although it may have other functions. The introduction of high phaseic acid concentrations have been found to impede stomatal closure and reduce photosynthesis in Arabidopsis but this may be a result of product inhibition rather than recognition of phaseic acid by a receptor. Phaseic acid inhibits glutamate receptors in mouse brain. Biosynthesis =Early precursors= Phaseic acid is an isoprenoid, which means that it is derived from isoprene units. The activated terpene geranylgeranyl pyrophosphate is combined with itself to produce the common carotenoid precursor, lycopene. Two geranylgeranyl pyrophosphates are combined to form phytoene phytoene is isomerized and cyclized to produce Œ≤ carotene =Carotenoid precursors= Phaseic acid is a product of abscisic acid, which is itself the product of the C40 carotenoid zeaxanthin via at least four enzymatic steps. Zeaxanthin is epoxidized to form violaxanthin or neoxanthin. The C15 end of the molecule is then cleaved by an epoxycarotenoid epoxygenase to form xanthoxin, an aldehyde.Œ≤ carotene is hydroxylated and epoxidated to form violaxanthin The biosynthesis of xanthoxin =Modification of xanthoxin= Xanthoxin is reduced at the epoxy group and then hydroxylated at the aldehyde group, producing abscisic acid.Cutler and Krochko (1999). Formation and breakdown of ABA. Trends in Plant Science, 4: 472-478 The 8' hydroxylation of abscisate, abscisic acid's conjugate base, produces 8'-hydroxyabscisate. 8'-hydroxyabscisate cyclizes via nucleophilic attack of the existing ring by the 8' hydroxy group to interconvert with phaseate. The former process is known to be mediated by 8' abscisic acid hydroxylases, a family of NADPH-dependent enzymes. Saito et al. have demonstrated that, in the case of arabidopsis, these hydroxylases are independent of any regulatory mechanism downstream of translation itself.Saito S.

It was the first production car offered for sale by the company. Name origins The name referred to the car‚Äôs fiscal horsepower, which was a function of the cylinder diameter. Fiscal horsepower was used in the UK, as in other European countries, by government to determine how much tax they would levy on the cars‚Äô owners. It was differently defined in each country: the common feature was that there was no arithmetical correlation between tax horsepower and actual horsepower. Fiscal horsepower categories were used to name cars in many parts of Europe until well into the 1950s, and they effectively defined the class within which the car competed. Thus a Lanchester Ten from the 1950s was approximately the same size as the Ford Model C Ten, the Morris Ten, the Standard Ten and a plethora of cars from other manufacturers carrying the \\"Ten\\" name during the same period. Lanchester 10 (1900‚Äì1904) The original Lanchester 10 was introduced in 1900, and was designed by Frederick Lanchester, the eldest of the three Lanchester brothers, while the third brother, George, took responsibility for designing the production processes.

A single engined biplane, the AB-4 was intended to carry out night reconnaissance for the Imperial Japanese Navy. Six were built and accepted into service as the Experimental 6-Shi Night Reconnaissance Flying boat, three of which were converted to civil transports. Development and design In 1931, the Imperial Japanese Navy instructed the Aichi Tokei Denki Seizo KK. (Aichi Watch and Electric Machinery Company, Ltd), who had been involved in aircraft manufacture, particularly for the Navy, since 1920, to design a small catapult-launched night reconnaissance aircraft, intended to observe nocturnal shipping movements, spot naval gunfire during night engagements and to direct friendly submarines.Mikesh and Abe 1990, pp.70‚Äì71. The resulting design, designated AB-4 (\\"Aichi Biplane\\") by Aichi was a single-engined pusher biplane flying boat of all-metal construction. Its single-bay wings folded backwards for storage aboard ship, while its crew of three were housed in open cockpits. It was powered by a single Gasuden Urakaze water-cooled six-cylinder inline engine driving a two blade propellor. The first prototype flew in May 1932, and while handling was generally good, it had poor control during take-off and landing, and a poor view for the pilot. Despite this, a further five prototypes were ordered for evaluation.

In this case 6-Shi stood for 1931. were subject to extensive testing and evaluation by the Japanese Navy. While the Navy decided not to order further production of the AB-4, it had a continued requirement for a dedicated night reconnaissance aircraft, which resulted in the Specification that led to the Aichi E10A, which entered service in 1936.Mikesh and Abe 1990, pp.76‚Äì77. In 1935, three of the six AB-4s were sold to the Japanese Airline Nippon Koku Yuso Kenkyusho, (NKYK). The first aircraft was converted to a cargo transport, while the second and third aircraft were converted to passenger airliners, with the pilot's cockpit moved to the extreme nose (replacing the existing gunners position) and an enclosed passenger cabin, for five and six passengers respectively, added. The third prototype replaced the Gasuden engine with a more powerful Napier Lion.Mikesh and Abe 1990, pp.71‚Äì72. The three AB-4s were used by NKYK in scheduled services from Osaka, and for sightseeing flights. One crashed into a factory chimney on 27 May 1937, killing all five aboard.Mikesh and Abe 1990, p.72.

Biography, D A T A In 2010, he was elected Mayor of Kremenchuk.Oleg Babaev Life and career  Babaiev was born in 1965 in Kursk, Russian SFSR. He was of Azerbaijani descent. After completing high school in Kursk in 1982, he studied at the Higher Military- Political College in Minsk and graduated in 1986. He eventually moved to Ukraine, while his parents remained residents of Kursk. In 2000, he graduated from Kiev University. From 1986‚Äì1990 Babaiev served in the Soviet Army. He was stationed in the Soviet Union's far east and later in Czechoslovakia. After the fall of communism in Eastern Europe, Babaiev's unit withdrew from Czechoslovakia and he was stationed in Kiev. In 1990, he obtained Ukrainian citizenship. After the dissolution of the Soviet Union, Babaiev served as a reserve officer in the Ukrainian army until 1996, eventually reaching the rank of colonel. He became Chairman of JSC Kremenchukm'yaso in 1998 and President of a football club, FC Vorskla Poltava, in 2005. He was also honorary president of FC Kremin Kremenchuk (lower leagues). 270px Babaiev was elected to the Verkhovna Rada (Ukrainian Parliament) in the 2007 parliamentary election. He was a member of the All-Ukrainian Union \\"Fatherland\\", but left the party in late 2010 after he was elected Mayor of Kremenchuk (with 42.34% of the votes), stating that \\"The mayor should be apolitical\\". As mayor, Oleh Babaiev was perhaps best known for the recreational projects he promoted within the city. Being an avid sportsman, Babaiev invested heavily to rebuild the aging Soviet-era parks and sports stadiums within the city. Some of the most notable parks to be restored under Babaiev's tenure as mayor of Kremenchuk were the October Square, later renamed Babaiev Square after his honor, and the Pridneprovsky Park in the city's center.

In 1890 Rutland Railroad Station President Dr. William Seward Webb commissioned the building of the railroad station near the center of Shelburne village to conveniently serve passengers on the Central Vermont and Rutland Railroads. History Designed by Robert Henderson Robertson, architect of the Vanderbilt-Webb estate on Shelburne Farms, the Railroad Station reflects the popular Shingle style, which developed out of the Queen Anne and Colonial Revival styles in the last quarter of the nineteenth century. The Shingle style accentuates the asymmetrical planning and prominent gables common to Colonial and Queen Anne revival structures, while the overhanging eaves, eyebrow windows, and the obligatory shingle siding blanket the structure's exterior to emphasize its fluid, continuous form. In the case of the Railroad Station, the shingled roof, which extends from the chimney peak to the edge of the overhanging porch, dominates the structure and unifies the building. Iterations of the Shingle style became common in the design of wealthy Northeasterners' summer \\"cottages\\", such as the house at Shelburne Farms. In applying the Shingle style to the Railroad Station, Robertson guaranteed stylistic consistency between the station and his nearby Vanderbilt-Webb estate. Robertson originally divided the interior of the Railroad Station into individual waiting rooms for men and women, with the stationmaster's office in between. In 1953, when the Rutland Railroad discontinued passenger service to Shelburne, Dr. Webb's son, Vanderbilt Webb, and son-in-law, Cyril Jones, gave the station to Shelburne Museum. The museum moved the station to its present site in 1959 and renovated the building, restoring the interior to Robertson's original plan in the process. That year the museum constructed the adjacent Freight Shed, which mimics the Railroad Station stylistically and reflects the type of outbuildings that every railroad would have maintained. Collection =Railroad equipment and memorabilia= Railroads brought great changes in commerce and communications to New England in the second half of the nineteenth century. Before the advent of railroads, New Englanders depended on the region's lakes and rivers and the seacoast as their primary avenues of travel. Traveling inland proved difficult over roads that were muddy in spring, dusty and rutted in summer and fall, and littered with tree stumps year-round. Beginning in the late 1840s railroads brought new settlers to Vermont and helped the state's fledgling dairy industry flourish by providing access to markets for milk, butter, and cheese. Railroads connected once- remote New England communities to the rest of the country, improving mail delivery and bringing newspapers from Boston and New York City the next day instead of weeks later. William Seward Webb served as president of the Wagner Palace Car Company and the Rutland Railroad at the turn of the twentieth century. The Shelburne Railroad Station, now at the museum, was constructed for Webb to serve the town and his estate at Shelburne Farms. Today it houses part of the museum's collection of railroad equipment and memorabilia. The communication devices displayed range from the simple message hoops and \\"high- speed delivery fork\\" to technological innovations like the telegraph and telephone. Other items in the collection include historic photographs and locomotive portraits, maps of the rail network in Vermont and the United States in the nineteenth century, broadsides, and timetables for Vermont railroads, and models of early locomotives. The museum's collection also includes a large group of railroad lanterns and glass globes from railroads around the Northeast. Railroad lanterns served as a method of communication between conductors, brakemen, signalmen, and engineers. Also in the collection are track-setting equipment, semaphore flags, handcars, and other track maintenance equipment. The wooden replica of Old Ironsides, the first locomotive built by the Baldwin Locomotive Works, was first displayed at the Columbian Exposition in Chicago in 1893. Part of the collection is the Gertie Buck, a self-propelled inspection car built and used by the Dewey family on the Woodstock Railway in eastern Vermont in the last decades of the nineteenth century.

David Johnson of DVD Verdict heavily criticized Curse of the Zodiac, writing, \\"The movie plays out like this: Zodiac Killer wanders around, the camera shakes a lot, he kills a girl, the camera shakes a lot, the psychic gets a headache and has a vision of the crime scene, the camera shakes a lot, Zodiac calls the journalist and talks trash, the camera shakes a lot and repeat x4. Even if you're able to penetrate the insane editing, the narrative within will almost certainly bore your migraine-having ass. Add to that, the acting is universally atrocious‚Äîthe scenes with the psychic and her boyfriend are a case study on how to miss cues and flub lines\\". Bloody Disgusting's Brian W. Collins included Curse of the Zodiac on his 10 Worst Horror Films of 2007 list, in which he stated, \\"Not getting a single detail right about the Zodiac (other than the setting) is the least of its problems. It took effort to even get through the entire film, which consisted mainly of 3 scenes repeated over and over (killer taunts the cop, killer taunts the girl, killer kills some hippies we have never seen before)\\". Garrett and Sean Neil Something Awful awarded a near \\"perfect\\" score of -49/-50, and described the film as nothing more than \\"a twisted labyrinth of spinning, out-of-focus cameras and pointless gibberish\\".

Born in St Tudy, Cornwall and educated in England, Kempthorne moved to the United States, where he was for many decades a professor of statistics at Iowa State University. Randomization analysis Kempthorne developed a randomization-based approach to the statistical analysis of randomized experiments, which was expounded in pioneering textbooks and articles. Kempthorne's insistence on randomization followed the early writings of Ronald Fisher, especially on randomized experiments.Randomization-based inference and randomized experiments were introduced by Charles S. Peirce, whose writings were recognized by Kempthorne (in later years). Kempthorne praised Peirce repeatedly in Hinkelmann and Kempthorne (2008), for example as being \\"the foremost philosopher of science\\" (page 8 in the first edition, 1994). Answering the question \\"What do you see as the important problems of statistics?\\", Kempthorne replied finally, \\"I feel that much of philosophy needs to be read‚Äîparticularly the writings of the great American philosopher, C. S. Peirce.\\" (Folks, p. 336) Kempthorne is the founder of the \\"Iowa school\\" of experimental design and analysis of variance.The \\"Iowa school\\" is named on page 262 in Bailey and Speed: * Kempthorne and many of his former doctoral students have often emphasized the use of the randomization distribution under the null hypothesis. Kempthorne was skeptical of \\"statistical models\\" (of populations), when such models are proposed by statisticians rather than created using objective randomization procedures. Kempthorne's randomization-analysis has influenced the causal model of Donald Rubin; in turn, Rubin's randomization-based analysis and his work with Rosenbaum on propensity score matching influenced Kempthorne's analysis of covariance.See Chapter 8 in Hinkelmann and Kempthorne 2008. Model-based analysis Oscar Kempthorne was skeptical towards (and often critical of) model-based inference, particularly two influential alternatives: Kempthorne was skeptical of, first, neo-Fisherian statistics, which is inspired by the later writings of Ronald A. Fisher and by the contemporary writings of David R. Cox and John Nelder; neo-Fisherian statistics emphasizes likelihood functions of parameters.Kempthorne often distinguished between the randomization-based analysis of early Fisher and the model-based analysis of (post-Neyman) Fisher, for example in Kempthorne's comments on Debabrata Basu's paper \\"The Fisher randomization test\\" in the Journal of the American Statistical Association (1978). Second, Kempthorne was skeptical of Bayesian statistics, which use not only likelihoods but also probability distributions on parameters.However, Kempthorne recognized that the planning of experiments used scientific knowledge and beliefs, and therefore Kempthorne was interested in optimal designs, especially Bayesian experimental design: > The optimal design is dependent upon the unknown theta, and there is no > choice but to invoke prior information about theta in choosing the design. I > would like to say there has never been the slightest argument about this. In > the design of experiments, one has to use some informal prior knowledge. > (Folks, 334) Kempthorne's skepticism towards Bayesian inference focused on the prior's use in analyzing data from randomized experiments; for analyzing data from randomized experiments, Kempthorne advocated using the objective randomization-distribution, which was induced by the randomization specified in the experimental protoocol and implemented in the actual experimental plan. Nonetheless, while subjective probability and Bayesian inference were viewed skeptically by Kempthorne, Bayesian experimental design was defended. In the preface to his second volume with Hinkelmann (2004), Kempthorne wrote, > We strongly believe that design of experiment is a Bayesian experimentation > process, ... one in which the experimenter approaches the experiment with > some beliefs, to which he accommodates the design.

In December 1961, the selection of female cosmonaut trainees was authorized by the Soviet government, with the specific intention of ensuring the first woman in space was a Soviet citizen. In February 1962, Yorkina was selected as a member of a group of five female cosmonauts to be trained for a solo spaceflight in a Vostok spacecraft. Like several others in the group, she was an amateur parachutist. In 1963, she married Valery Sergeychik, which whom she had two children, Valery and Svetlana, in violation of Korolyov's rule that female cosmonauts must put off having children and dedicate themselves to the space program. The honor of being the first woman in space was eventually given to Valentina Tereshkova, who was launched into Earth orbit in June 1963 aboard Vostok 6. Tereshkova's backup was Irina Solovyova, with Valentina Ponomaryova in a supporting 'second backup' role. Yorkina had been taken out of the running for the mission as she had performed poorly in the simulator. Yorkina was considered one of the least capable of the five female cosmonauts, and Kamanin specifically complained that she was \\"too fond of chocolate and cakes\\". She was included in plans for Voskhod 5, an all-female duration and EVA mission, but only as the secondary member of the backup crew. Following cancellation of the Voskhod Program, Yorkina worked at the Gagarin Cosmonaut Training Center, and was one of the cosmonauts involved in development of the Spiral spaceplane. She retired from the space program on 1 October 1969, and from active military duty in 1989. References External links *–ñ–∞–Ω–Ω–∞ –î–º–∏—Ç—Ä–∏–µ–≤–Ω–∞ –Å—Ä–∫–∏–Ω–∞ (–°–µ–≥—Ä–µ–π—á–∏–∫).

It is a major nodal point and junction for both the Z√ºrich S-Bahn network and the Swiss railway network as a whole. Trains on 11 lines of the S-Bahn serve the station, as do frequent inter- regional trains. Inter-city passenger and freight traffic also passes through the station without stopping. Serving approximately 85,000 daily passengers, Z√ºrich Oerlikon is the seventh busiest railway station in Switzerland. Oerlikon station lies close nearby Hallenstadion and Messe Z√ºrich in the centre of Oerlikon, a suburb of Z√ºrich that was once an independent town, and still remains an important business and retail centre. The Swiss√¥tel Z√ºrich lies immediately opposite the front of the station. The station building is listed in the Swiss inventory of cultural property of national and regional significance as a Class B object of regional importance.  History  On 27 December 1855 the line from Oerlikon to Winterthur via Wallisellen station was established by the Schweizerische Nordostbahn (NOB), and a temporary wooden railway station was built by A. Beckh and Jakob Friedrich Wanner. The following year the line was extendend to Z√ºrich Hauptbahnhof through the Wipkingen Tunnel. Lines from Wallisellen to Uster (1856) and Oerlikon to B√ºlach via Glattbrugg station (1865) followed. The opening of these lines triggered the industrialisation of Oerlikon, and a massive population growth. In particular the large works of Maschinenfabrik Oerlikon was established immediately to the west of the station. In 1865, the wooden railway station was replaced by a stone building. In 1877, the Schweizerische Nationalbahn (SNB) opened the Furttal railway line from Wettingen to Effretikon, via Seebach and Opfikon stations. This line was conceived as a freight bypass for Z√ºrich and whilst it passed close to Oerlikon station, it did not serve it. In 1878 the SNB became insolvent, and was taken over by the NOB. In 1881, a link between the Oerlikon to B√ºlach line and the Furttal line was constructed to allow trains to run from Oerlikon to Opfikon, and in 1909 a curve was added to also allow trains to run from Oerlikon to Seebach. In 1912, the current station building replaced that of 1865. In June 1969 the K√§ferberg Tunnel was opened, providing a second route to Hauptbahnhof. In October 1979 the line from Oerlikon under Zurich Airport and on to rejoin the main line to Winterthur at Bassersdorf (the Flughafenlinie) opened, including a new station directly under the airport terminal. In June 2014, the Weinberg Tunnel opened, providing a third route to Hauptbahnhof. To complement the opening of the Weinberg tunnel, the station's infrastructure was renewed, with the provision of two additional platform tracks and the rebuilding of the station's bus and tram stops. The additional platforms and tracks were constructed on the north- western side of the station, partially on land occupied by the former office building of Maschinenfabrik Oerlikon, dating from the late 19th century and now a restaurant complex known as Gleis 9. Because of its cultural importance to the region, plans to demolish the building were rejected, and instead the building was moved to the west on specially laid tracks. The move took place in May 2012 and took 19 hours.  Layout and facilities  The station is aligned on a south-west to north-east axis, and, following its expansion, has eight through platform tracks serving two side platforms and three island platforms. At the centre of the station the platforms are at or about street level, but the slope of the land means they are significantly above street level at the north-eastern end of the station, whilst the south-western approaches descend into a cutting and, eventually, tunnels. There are station entrances on both sides of the station, but the main station buildings are on the south-eastern side of the station, the same side as the centre of the suburb of Oerlikon. Pedestrian subways link both sides of the station and all platforms. To the south-west of Oerlikon station, the line through the station divides into three lines, with fly-overs and dive-unders providing non- conflicting access routes to and from the different lines. The three lines all link to Z√ºrich Hauptbahnhof by different tunnels through the intermediate ridge, these being the Wipkingen Tunnel, the K√§ferberg Tunnel and the Weinberg Tunnel. The first two of these approach the Hauptbahnhof from the west, giving access to both its upper level terminal platforms and its low level through platforms, whilst the Weinberg Tunnel enters the low level through platforms from the east. To the north-east of Oerlikon station, the line divides into two within the station limits. The south-easternmost two platform tracks serve the line to Wallisellen station and beyond. The remaining platform tracks run together for further, but eventually divide to serve the routes to Seebach, Glattbrugg, Opfikon and Zurich Airport stations respectively. Trams of both the Z√ºrich tramway system and the Glattalbahn operate from a number of stops adjacent to both sides of the station, as do buses of both the Verkehrsbetriebe Z√ºrich and Glattalbus. A stop complex on the south-eastern side of the station and known as Bahnhof Oerlikon is served by tram route 11, and buses 61, 62, 94, 768 and 781. A second stop complex to the north-east of the station and known as Bahnhof Oerlikon Ost is served by tram routes 10 and 14, and buses 75, 768 and 781. A third stop complex to the north-west of the station and known as Bahnhof Oerlikon Nord is served by buses 64 and 80. Between them these connect the station to much of the city of Z√ºrich and to the Glatt Valley between Oerlikon and Zurich Airport. The renovation of the station underpasses, completed in 2016, added more than 20 store fronts to the Bahnhof Oerlikon complex mostly below ground level. Prior to 2016, only two food vendors and one store were located on the station grounds itself. In Switzerland, the law requires that most stores close on Sundays; however, stores located in airports and railways are exempt, allowing the stores in Bahnhof Oerlikon to remain open year-round.  Operation  The station is an important and busy one. It is served by lines S2, S3, S6, S7, S8, S9, S14, S15, S16, S19, S21, and S24 of the Z√ºrich S-Bahn. It is also called at by trains on the InterRegio (IR) lines from Zurich Airport to Basel SBB and Zurich Airport to Luzern, and the RegioExpress (RE) line from Z√ºrich to Schaffhausen. Train connections to Oerlikon from Z√ºrich Hauptbahnhof are very frequent, and the ride takes only a few minutes. All trains stopping at Oerlikon also serve Hauptbahnhof providing, for most of the day, more than 20 trains per hour (tph) in each direction. Other stations served (with typical daytime frequencies) include (S14; 2 tph), (IR/S6; 3 tph), (IR; 1 tph), (IR; 1 tph), (RE/S9; 3 tph), (S7/S8/S19/S24; 8 tph), (S2/S8/S24; 6 tph), (S6/S7/S9/S15/S16; 10 tph), (S6/S16; 4 tph), (S14; 2 tph), (S7; 2 tph), (IR; 1 tph), (S15; 2 tph), (S2/S8; 4 tph), (S9; 2 tph), (S7/S15; 4 tph), (S6/S7/S9/S15/S16; 10 tph), (RE/S9/S24; 3 tph), (IR/S2/S8/S24; 7 tph), (S6/S7; 4 tph), (S9/S14/S15; 6 tph), (S8/S14/S19; 6 tph), (S6; 2 tph), (S14/S15; 4 tph), (S7/S8/S24; 6 tph), (S24; 2 tph), (S2; 2 tph), (IR/S24; 3 tph), and (IR/S2/S16/S24; 8 tph).

The goal of the center is to give immediate response and relief to the emergency needs of disenfranchised people and help them resolve the conditions that placed them at risk. Since its founding, the center has offered comfort and guidance to thousands of needy Baltimoreans. The basis of the Franciscan Sisters' ministry is recognizing the dignity of every human being and serving all people with respect. The center serves people in need regardless of age, race, creed or national origin. Most clients live in Baltimore City but city residency is not a requirement. The Franciscan Center is a 501(c)(3) organization.  History  The Franciscan Sisters have fed the hungry and cared for African American orphans since their arrival in Baltimore in 1881. They were the first white religious order with a mission to serve blacks in Baltimore.Gillard, John Thomas (1930). \\"The Catholic Church and the American Negro\\", p. 163, St. Joseph's Society Press When, in 1968, a $200 donation of stock shares coincided with the availability of a rowhouse that had previously been home to missionary priests, the sisters turned to the community for guidance; neighbors requested emergency food and clothing services. In its first month of operation, with a budget of $200, the Franciscan Center served 30 people. Sister Irene Marshiano, O.S.F., was the center's first director, aided by Sister Gertrude Brennan, O.S.F., and volunteers. In the early years, the center was staffed by the Franciscan Sisters, with the assistance of members of the Third Order of Saint Francis and lay volunteers. Beginning with the baby boom generation, the number of young women entering religious orders has not been sufficient to replace retiring sisters. This threatened the long-term viability of the Franciscan Sisters of Baltimore. In 2001, they merged with another congregation, the Sisters of St. Francis of Assisi in Wisconsin. Today, the Franciscan Center is staffed primarily by lay people, including the current president and CEO, Karen Heyward-West.  The Franciscan Center today  The center's operating budget was $1.1 million in 2008, and 22 paid staff plus more than 350 volunteers served thousands of clients. Because of the transient circumstances of many of the people who seek the center's help, an exact number of clients is impossible to gauge. In 2008, between 400 and 650 meals were served each day; 2,300 clients received clothing or hygiene products; 370 clients used the Technology Resource center; and 7,100 clients were interviewed and screened to determine eligibility for emergency or support services. Of the clients served, more than 3,700 were homeless.2008 Annual Report. The Franciscan Center. Retrieved 2011-02-15.

History Fred \\"Silo\\" Quimbly constructed the Round Barn, a three-story building measuring in diameter, in 1901 in Passumpsic, Vermont. Round barns enjoyed a brief period of popularity in the late nineteenth and early twentieth centuries. The Shakers designed and built the first round barn in America in 1826 in Hancock, Massachusetts. The publication of the building's plans in a nationally distributed farm journal in 1896 sparked the construction of approximately 24 comparable barns in Vermont beginning in 1899. Economy of labor was the fundamental aim of a round barn's design. Feed chutes connecting the upper and middle levels allowed for easy distribution of hay, stored in the spacious loft, and silage, stored in the central silo. Farmers could stanchion up to sixty cows around the center silo for feeding and milking and easily remove manure through trap doors that opened to the basement below, where it could be collected and removed by horse-drawn wagons. In 1985 and 1986 the Shelburne Museum relocated the Round Barn to the museum grounds. A helicopter flew the upper segment of the silo, which weighs nine thousand pounds, from Passumpsic to Shelburne, while workmen dismantled the remainder of the building piece-by-piece and transported it on flatbed trucks to museum grounds. After reconstruction, new materials replaced what had aged beyond use. While the roof of the barn was being replaced in April 2009, workers noted the signature of a painter, John Morency, on the silo. Bibliography *Wilson, Robert and Victoria Blewer.

Lower Merion School District case, plaintiffs charged two suburban Philadelphia high schools secretly spied on students by surreptitiously and remotely activating webcams embedded in school-issued laptops the students were using at home, and therefore infringed on their privacy rights. The schools admitted to secretly snapping over 66,000 webshots and screenshots, including webcam shots of students in their bedrooms. LANrev software was used in the Lower Merion school district's student laptop program, overseen by network technician Michael Perbix. In February 2010, Perbix and other administrators in the district were accused of using the software to take undisclosed and unauthorized photographs of students through the webcams on their Macintosh laptops. The lawsuit was brought by the parents of 15-year-old sophomore, Blake Robbins, who was allegedly accused of illicit behavior seen through his computer's webcam of him in his bedroom. The photographs, taken from a laptop that was not reported stolen, were then allegedly used as evidence in a disciplinary action. The FBI investigated the incident, and a Philadelphia federal judge intervened to sort out issues relating to the lawsuit. Perbix had previously praised Theft Track, the name of the feature that lets administrators remotely photograph potential thieves if a computer is reported stolen, noting in a YouTube video he produced that: > It‚Äôs an excellent feature. Yes, we have used it, and yes, it has gleaned > some results for us.

LANrev's new owner, Absolute Software denounced the use of their software for any illegal purpose, emphasizing that theft recovery should be left to law enforcement professionals. They further denied any knowledge of or complicity in either Perbix's or the school district's actions. Absolute stated that the next update of LANrev would permanently disable Theft Track.

The Stella branch of the family combined agricultural and mercantile interests with large scale involvement in the coal trade via Newcastle upon Tyne in the late 16th and 17th centuries, with many members being noted recusants, adherents to the old Catholic faith after the Reformation.James, M., Family, Lineage and Civil Society: A Study of Society, Politics and Mentality in the Durham Region, 1500‚Äì1640, p. 74 Thomas Tempest (1530‚Äì1578) was the son of the above; he married Elizabeth Place of Halnaby, Yorkshire and was of Stanley.

A leading Royalist, during the Civil War he commanded a Regiment of Foot in the Marquess of Newcastle's army.The Royalist Army in Northern England, 1642‚Äì45, Ph.D thesis, University of York, 1978) During 1644 his regiment fought at Northallerton, where its Lt. Colonel Gerard Salvin was killed and in July at Marston Moor where the royalist cause in the north was irretrievably lost. Retreating into Lancashire with the remnants of Prince Rupert's forces he joined the small band of volunteers defending Lathom House, home of the Earl of Derby. Despite fierce resistance this was forced to capitulate December 1645 with the defenders allowed to march to the nearest friendly forces. John Tempest occurs as Governor and defender of Skipton Castle which surrendered to Parliament 21 December 1645.This was the second siege. The house was eventually captured by the Roundhead General Egerton on 6 December 1645 Labeled an \\"obstinate delinquent\\" by the Parliamentary Commissioners alongside his father and father-in-law who compounded for their estates in 1647. He himself did so in 1649. With his cousin, Sir Richard Tempest Bt. of Stella, he took part in the second Civil War and is listed among the prisoners following the action at Cartington Castle, Northumberland in 1648.He or his cousin Sir Richard may be the Colonel Tempest surprised and captured with a party of Royalist horse at Whalley near Clitheroe prior to the Battle of Preston later that year During the Commonwealth, in 1656 he is mentioned by Marmaduke Langdale as among those Cavaliers of the Bishopric whom he deems \\"eminently reliable\\" and conversely by Cromwell's agents as the \\"leader of a cabal whose members include Col. Ralph Millot and William Davison\\". After the restoration of Charles II he was nominated a Knight of the Royal Oak in 1661, the order being \\"set aside for fear of inciting the heats and jealousies of the late times\\". In October 1662 he was appointed by John Cosin, Bishop of Durham, as a Deputy Lord Lieutenant and Receiver for County Durham, he seems already to have been Colonel of the Train Bands as on 17 September 1662 he is ordered by the Bishop to \\"search houses and arrest George Lilburne and Thomas Brown of Sunderland\\". The former was Mayor of Sunderland and brother of the Parliamentarian, General Robert Lilburne of Thickley, the most powerful man in Durham in the 1650s. From 1666, along with other Durham freeholders, Tempest petitioned for representation for the county, as distinct from the City, of Durham in Parliament, a privilege steadfastly opposed by the Bishop. A successful bill was eventually brought and on 21 June 1675 after a three-day election, John Tempest was declared elected as the first Member of Parliament for the County. An anonymous libel on the Earl of Danby's organisation published in 1677 observes that \\"John Tempest a papist, a pensioner and a court dinner man hath secured a customers place at Hull for his son\\".20 January 1675 ‚Äì Grant for John Tempest and Rowland Tempest, sons of Colonel John Tempest to be Customers of Hull port in reversion after Sir Matthew Appleyard and Thomas Lyons. 29 May 1688 ‚Äì Royal Warrant to the Attorney General constituting Rowland Tempest and John Tempest to customers of Hull in place of Matthew Appleyard.

In 1680 he and his son William Tempest sold The Isle to William Bigg. In 1680 and 1683 he is listed as a witness as to the Roundhead sympathies of John Blakiston of Newcastle and a JP, son of the regicide John Blakiston.Calendar of State Papers, 30 May 1680 In 1683 he and William Tempest purchased the manor of Little Hutton near Hutton Magna (Gilling West Wapentake) Yorkshire from the Edens.Feet of Fine Yorkshire Mich.35 Charles II In July 1688 he is reappointed as Deputy Lord Lieutenant of Durham with his son William.Calendar of State Papers 1688 He was buried at Forcett, North Yorkshire, on 26 July 1697, his daughter Margaret having married Richard Shuttleworth of Forcett and Gawthorpe Hall (Lancashire) William Tempest (31 January 1653 ‚Äì 16 March 1700), second son of John Tempest of The Isle and Old Durham and Elizabeth daughter and sole heiress of John Heath, represented the City of Durham as Member of Parliament in 1678, 1680 and 1689. [2] He was a defeated candidate in the elections of 1675,Tempest polled more votes than the successful candidate John Parkhurst but upon scrutiny it was discovered that 12 of Mr. Tempest's voters were not freemen and that 3 had voted twice (Surtees, Robert.

Guitar Hero is a series of rhythm video games published by Activision in which players use guitar-shaped controllers to mimic the playing of numerous popular rock music songs in a score attack gameplay; later games in the series have included support for both drums and vocals and playing as a full band. With over $2 billion in total sales worldwide, the game series has made a significant cultural impact, becoming a \\"cultural phenomenon\\" and recognizable in the popular culture. The series has been found to influence younger players into learning real instruments, and has found application within the health care industry to help recovering patients. Both Guitar Hero and Rock Band (a similar series of games developed by Harmonix, who originally developed Guitar Hero), have altered the video game and music industries. For video games, the introduction of Guitar Hero has led rhythm games to become one of the industries' largest growing markets. The series has also sparked the creation of both commercial and independently developed games with similar gameplay mechanics as well as learning tools using a real guitar in place of the controller. Older artists featured in Guitar Hero and Rock Band have experienced a surge in the popularity of their music, and the games have been seen as a way for younger audiences to experience the classic rock songs featured in the games. Newer bands and unsigned artists have also found success by being included in the game. This has led several bands to actively seek placement of their songs within the games. The impact of Guitar Hero on the music industry has caused music publishers to re-evaluate their approach to music licensing and their relationship with the video game industry. In entertainment The series' titles became very popular party games, which led them to be played in a variety of locales. In the wake of the series popularity several bars in the United States & Canada began offering \\"Guitar Hero nights\\" as an alternative to karaoke; one New York City bar experienced triple the business on such nights. Many concert tours, including the Family Values Tour feature Guitar Hero booths and contests between sets. Guitar Hero is responsible for introducing people to rock music and inspiring them to learn how to play guitar. A study by Youth Music found that 2.5 million out of 12 million children in the United Kingdom have begun learning how to play real instruments after playing music video games such as Guitar Hero; the group believes that these video games can be incorporated into music educational programs. Activision has teamed with the United Service Organizations to provide monetary support and copies of Guitar Hero III to the United States armed forces around the world. In health and treatment Guitar Hero has proven to be a useful tool in the development of children and as recovery for various injuries. Salon.com states that the games helped an 8-year-old guitarist learn sensitivity to rhythm, as well as develop the dexterity and independent hand usage necessary to play the instrument. Guitar Hero has been used alongside physical therapy to help recovering stroke patients as the games help with multiple limb coordination between fretting and strumming. Blondie drummer Clem Burke has worked with researchers at the University of Chichester and the University of Gloucestershire to determine how games like Guitar Hero can address issues of \\"child and adult obesity, autism, stroke patients and health and mental well-being in the workplace\\". Researchers at Johns Hopkins University have used Guitar Hero III and its controller to help amputee patients and to develop new prosthetic limbs for these patients. Researchers at Nevada Reno University have been able to modify a haptic feedback glove to work with the Guitar Hero freeware clone, Frets on Fire, to create Blind Hero, a music game that works on touch and audio only to appeal the game to visually impaired players. Guitar Hero was used as part of a Trent University youth sleep study which showed that players generally were better on replaying a song they had just been introduced to twelve hours later if that period included normal sleep. On the video game industry Activision stated on January 21, 2008 that North American sales from all of the Guitar Hero franchise have exceeded one billion dollars with over 16 million units sold, excluding downloadable content. Over 20 million songs have been sold as downloadable content as of July 2008, and 34 million by May 2009. As of October 9, 2008, the series has sold 23 million units with sales of US$1.6 billion, and as of May 2009 has earned US$2 billion at retail. Activision claims that Guitar Hero is the third largest video game franchise after the Mario and Madden NFL series, and is present in over 15 million households. Guitar Hero: World Tour along with other music games such as Rock Band 2 have surged the video game market in 2008; NPD Group reports cited that music video games made up 19% of the overall software industry sales in July 2008, and 16% through November 2008, and contributing to a 32% year-to-date sector growth through July 2008. Total sales of music games doubled in 2008, with total sales of US$1.9 billion. Guitar Hero represented about half of that figure, with a total of $992M of retail sales in 2008, and was the highest selling brand of the year. At the 2009 Consumer Electronics Show, Activision CEO Mike Griffith stated that Guitar Hero III is the first video game to exceed one billion dollars in total sales. Activision reported that the Guitar Hero franchise had 55% of the United States and European markets during the first quarter of 2009. Analysts expect 2009 to be a critical year to determine the future direction of music games, whether the sector will continue to grow or will remain stagnant. Early analysis of the first half of 2009 showed that sales of both Guitar Hero and Rock Band franchise games were down by half from the same period in 2008, likely due to fewer purchases of the more expensive game bundles that include one or more controllers, as well as large discounts on the prices of older games. Viacom, parent company of MTV Games, reported a 32% drop in 2009 second quarter profits, partially driven by weak sales of Rock Band amid the poor economy of the period. The series has created a market for products outside of the video games. McFarlane Toys has developed a series of six-inch-tall figurines based on the characters from the game. Brett Ratner, director for Rush Hour and X-Men: The Last Stand, has stated that he wishes to bring a movie based on Guitar Hero to theaters. However, Activision, the publisher of the series, did not approve the idea of a film adaptation. Frets on Fire is one of the many clones based on the success of the Guitar Hero series. The popularity of the Guitar Hero series has led to the development of several commercial and independent clones. Besides Harmonix' Rock Band series, Konami released Rock Revolution in 2008 which features drums and guitar (the game does not include vocals) similar to Guitar Hero World Tour. PopStar Guitar for the PlayStation 2 and Wii systems, developed by XS Games, features gameplay similar to the Guitar Hero series, but features pop music, as opposed to rock and metal. Digital Praise released a Christian rock- themed guitar-based game called Guitar Praise also in 2008. Guitar Rising, to be published for personal computers by Game Tank by 2009, is based on using a real guitar in order to perfect one's skills. We Rock: Drum King is a game promoted by Rolling Stone for the Wii that uses two Wii remotes as virtual drumsticks. Frets on Fire is an open-source clone of Guitar Hero for personal computers that features freely available independent songs and allows users to create their own note tracks, Clone Hero features the same aspects of freedom of song choice and community-made note tracks, but aims to almost exactly recreate Guitar Hero, rather than imitate it. Other games based on Guitar Hero include Battle of the Bands and Ultimate Band. Guitar Hero has also influenced other games outside of the music game genre. Tim Schafer credits Harmonix and the first Guitar Hero game to help establish his pitching of his heavy metal- inspired game, Br√ºtal Legend, due to the increase in popularity of metal music from the success of Guitar Hero. Guitar controllers have been repurposed as controls for an independently developed platform game, Fret Nice. Rock of the Dead for the Wii is based on combining the aspects of The Typing of the Dead with using a Guitar Hero guitar controller to fend off zombies. A PlayStation Home themed space based on Guitar Hero, called \\"Guitar Hero: Backstage\\", was released on March 26, 2009 in North Americas version, and includes a \\"Simon says\\"-like minigame called \\"Guitar Hero-Master of Rock\\", themed objects, and videos for the user. Guitar Hero has also been considered to have made the use of special peripherals more commonplace and acceptable for consumers for games that followed, including Nintendo's Wii console and games such as Mario Kart Wii and Wii Fit. Fan sites have also arisen to provide news and forums related to the Guitar Hero series. Scorehero is one such site that includes both forums and informal tracking of players' scores for both the Guitar Hero and Rock Band series; the site has received donations from Harmonix president Alex Rigopulos, and site members have been invited to pre-release demonstrations of upcoming games, often leading to information about tracks in these games. Guitar Hero now holds a place in the Guinness World Records in their Gamers Edition, tracking the highest score on a single song (Dragonforce's \\"Through the Fire and Flames\\") in Guitar Hero III; the record has held by both Chris Chike and Daniel Johnson, each outdoing each other in subsequent attempts; Johnson is the present holder of the record. Chike has received additional notice for performing a full combo playthrough of Dragonforce's \\"Through the Fire and Flames\\". Both players' reputations have earned them spokespersons deals, Chike for The Ant Commandos, a third-party peripheral controller maker, and Johnson for eMazingGaming.com, a video game event promoter. Guinness also awarded the series ten world records in the Gamer's Edition 2008, including \\"Best Selling Guitar Based Game\\" and \\"Biggest Funeral for a Fictional Object\\", when in November 2006 a funeral for the air guitar was held in London, England as a publicity stunt for Guitar Hero IIs release. On the music industry The band Aerosmith has made more money from Guitar Hero: Aerosmith than from sales of any single album. Guitar Hero and Rock Band have been considered a boon to the music industry in a manner similar to music videos in the 1980s. Both licensed and indie bands whose works have been included in the Guitar Hero games have gained further popularity from this inclusion. Both record companies and retailers have experienced increases of 200% to 300% in sales of songs after their inclusion in the series. Every Guitar Hero III song tracked by Nielsen SoundScan (62 of 70) saw an increase in digital download sales the week ending December 30, 2007, when many who got the game as a gift were playing it, and every song included in Guitar Hero III and Rock Band saw downloaded sales increase during 2007 between 15% to 843%. A survey conducted by Brown Universitys Kiri Miller found that 76% of the players of Guitar Hero bought the music they heard in the game. Indie group Bang Camaro's recognition increased after their song \\"Push Push (Lady Lightning)\\" appeared in Guitar Hero II. The band DragonForce, whose song \\"Through the Fire and Flames\\" is featured as a bonus song in Guitar Hero III: Legends of Rock, saw a 126% increase in CD sales in the week after the release of the game, and downloads of the song, selling fewer than 2,000 weekly, rose to more than 10,000 after Guitar Hero III's release and approached 40,000 the week ending 2007-12-30. Even older, established groups such as Aerosmith saw an increase in sales at the same time Guitar Hero games containing their songs were released, such as a modest increase in download sales for its \\"Same Old Song and Dance\\", which rose to 2,041 from 374 copies the previous week; a 40% increase in the band's catalog was seen in the weeks following the release of Guitar Hero: Aerosmith. According to Activision CEO Bobby Kotick, Guitar Hero: Aerosmith has made more money for Aerosmith than any of their previous albums. Both Guitar Hero and Rock Band are seen as new methods of music distribution; an analysis for market research company NPD Group states that \\"As the video games industry grows, it's becoming an ever-more attractive promotional outlet for all kinds of industries.\\" The games have also been seen as a way to introduce younger generations to music of the past; bands such as Living Colour, Warrant, The Grateful Dead, Poison, and Ratt have seen interest in their music rise due to the inclusion of their songs in the Guitar Hero or Rock Band, as well as other music video games. Joel Peresman, president and CEO of the Rock and Roll Hall of Fame, attributes surges in attendance to the museum in 2008‚Äì2009, particularly in families with young children, in part to the success of Guitar Hero and Rock Band. The popularity of downloadable content for music games has led the UK Official Download Chart to consider including these sales in their compilation of sales performance data. Bands or those that control the copyrights on bands' works have been in talks with the makers and distributions of both Guitar Hero and Rock Band as methods of achieving more exposure for the band. Following the announcement of Guitar Hero: Aerosmith, Martin N. \\"Marty\\" Bandier, executive for Sony/ATV which owns the copyrights on The Beatles compositions, stated he was very interested in helping Activision bring a Beatles-themed Guitar Hero title to the market in a similar fashion. Both Activision and MTV Games were in talks with representatives of the Beatles to create a Beatles-themed game, until MTV Games secured an exclusive license with Apple Corps, Ltd. to produce The Beatles: Rock Band. Groups such as Van Halen, The Eagles, Steely Dan and Guns N' Roses have working deals with these companies to include their songs within future games. Other artists, having playing Guitar Hero or Rock Band, may approach the game developers to ask for inclusion of songs specifically for their adaptability into playable tracks. However, not all bands are comfortable with this: Led Zeppelin has turned down offers from both games to include their music due to concerns that Jimmy Page and other members of the band have with releasing the master recordings of their music. There are also cases where bands want to be included, but the master recordings have been lost or are unusable. Some bands such as the Sex Pistols, Living Colour, and Aerosmith have rerecorded these songs, while other bands have been able to provide concert \\"live\\" master recordings. However, some larger artists are unable to do so. Neversoft director Brian Bright states that they do not expect to acquire songs from Pink Floyd and Prince due to such reasons. With the pending release of The Beatles: Rock Band, Pink Floyd is also in active discussions to include its music in either Guitar Hero or Rock Band, according to representatives for EMI. Guitar Hero and other rock music-based games work with record companies to license each song for its use, costing a per-song average of $25,000 for the rights to use a master recording and $10,000 for the rights to make a cover. The impact of Guitar Hero and Rock Band has caused record companies to create dedicated video game liaisons to handle the inclusions of songs in these games. The record and game companies work together to tie in releases of downloadable content with album releases and concert appearances, such as by the simultaneous release of Metallica's Death Magnetic album and as playable Guitar Hero tracks. However, some in the music industry have raised concerns that the music labels are not receiving fair compensation considering the success of the games. Edgar Bronfman Jr., chairman and chief executive for Warner Music Group, stated that \\"The amount being paid to the industry, even though their games are entirely dependent on the content that we own and control, is far too small.\\" Tim Riley, vice president of music affairs at Activision, believes that the increase in popularity of the game series has led more people, including musicians and music labels, to want to be part of the success: \\"The number of people interested in being associated with the game is probably a thousand times more than we can get into the game.\\" Activision CEO Robert Kotick has stated, in response to the record company's claims, that the impact that the Guitar Hero games have caused game developers and publishers to question if they \\"should be paying any money at all and whether it should be the reverse.\\" M√∂tley Cr√ºe manager Allen Kovac noted that artists make a larger share of the sale of each downloaded game song compared to iTunes, and that bands that own their own master recordings earn even a larger percentage from music licensing rights. Michael Pachter, an industry analyst for Wedbush Morgan, noted that Guitar Hero is not dependent on a single record label, as there is nearly a 2000-year supply of songs available at the current rate of content releases, and a full music industry denial to the game series could lead to anti-trust measures. Patcher also contrasted Bronfman's view, stating that users are not buying the games for the songs, but for the game, with each song providing its own challenge. However, analysis believe that Activision's attitude on music licensing may have influenced the decision of Apple Corps, Ltd. to give the lucrative licensing agreement for The Beatles' music to MTV Games, who were more flexible in their negotiations. Some musicians have been critical of Guitar Hero's impact on the industry. Jack White of The White Stripes stated that he was disappointed to learn that video games are the most likely venue where younger audiences will be exposed to new works, while Jimmy Page of Led Zeppelin does not believe that people can learn how to play real instruments from their video game counterparts. Similarly, Prince has turned down opportunities to have his music in the series, stating that he felt that it was \\"more important that kids learn how to actually play the guitar\\". In popular culture Guitar Hero has made several appearances in popular culture. Guitar Hero II is the centerpiece of an episode of South Park titled \\"Guitar Queer-O\\", in which Stan and Kyle overindulge in Guitar Hero II and become treated as though they were real-life rock stars. The episode was first broadcast on November 7, 2007, ten days after the American release of Guitar Hero III: Legends of Rock. Metalocalypse (created by Titmouse Studio, who also provided cutscene animations within the Guitar Hero game) has made reference to Guitar Hero; in one example, the episode \\"Dethkids,\\" a sick child composes a song for Dethklok rhythm guitarist Toki Wartooth using a Guitar Hero controller. Ellen DeGeneres has played Guitar Hero several times in 2008 during the monologue of her syndicated talk show. In the January 25, 2008, episode she is seen playing along to \\"Barracuda\\", which segues to Heart performing the song for the audience. During the season 7 finale of American Idol, finalists David Cook and David Archuleta appeared in separate commercials for the games, where they each parodied Tom Cruise dancing to \\"Old Time Rock and Roll\\" in the movie Risky Business. This parody has been used by director Brett Ratner to create advertisements for Guitar Hero World Tour, featuring celebrities such as Kobe Bryant, Tony Hawk, Alex Rodriguez, Michael Phelps, Corbin Bleu, Heidi Klum, and Marisa Miller. Political cartoonist Steve Breen illustrated a cartoon where Queen Elizabeth II received Guitar Hero as a gift from visiting President Barack Obama, a parody of Obama's visit to England in April 2009 during which he gave Queen Elizabeth II an iPod. A 2009 Close to Home comic strip portrayed a young boy blowing into a tuba-shaped joystick while playing a video game, as his parents cover their ears, with the caption: \\"Despite the success of Guitar Hero, Tuba Hero bombs big-time.\\" During Halftime of MLS Cup 2009 two league players, Jimmy Conrad of the Kansas City Wizards and Freddy Montero of Seattle Sounders FC faced off to Michael Jackson's \\"Beat It\\" in Guitar Hero World Tour. A scene, written into the script by Vince Vaughn, in Couples Retreat features Vaughn's character challenging a resort employee to a Guitar Hero 5-faceoff. MC Lars' This Gigantic Robot Kills includes a song called \\"Guitar Hero Hero (Beating Guitar Hero Does Not Make You Slash)\\", poking fun at frequent players of GH. It features a solo from Paul Gilbert. (The song's lyrics reference the following real-guitar players in addition to those two: Robert Johnson, Dimebag Darrell, Eric Clapton and Jimi Hendrix.) Mariah Carey's music video for her song \\"Touch My Body\\" features a nerd strumming on a Guitar Hero controller.

Koenigsmark, who batted and threw right-handed, came in as a reliever in the top of the eighth on September 10, 1919 against the Brooklyn Robins with an 11-2 lead. He walked a batter, then gave up two consecutive hits -- and was then relieved, and never played in the majors again. The Cardinals hung on to win the game 11-8, in front of a crowd of only 500 fans. As two of the runners Koenigsmark allowed came around to score, Koenigsmark retired with an ERA of infinity. He was born in Belleville, Illinois, and died in Waterloo, Illinois.
