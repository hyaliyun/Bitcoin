Martin Circus was one of the first French bands set up with the aim of writing and performing rock music with French language lyrics. Encouraged by English musician Mick Jones, who had played in Johnny Hallyday's backing group, the band was established by G√©rard Pisani (b. 1941, saxophone) - who had also been in Hallyday's band - and Jean-Pierre \\"Bob\\" Brault (b. 1945, bass, vocals), soon joined by Patrick Dietsch (vocals, guitar), Paul- Jean Borowsky (vocals, keyboards), and Jean-Francois Leroi (drums).

The band toured widely, performed at many festivals, and appeared in the 1971 movie Les Bidasses en folie.

He serves as convener of pro-democracy organisation Civil Human Rights Front (CHRF) and as a secretary for LGBT rights organisation Rainbow of Hong Kong. He is a longtime member of the League of Social Democrats. In 2019 he was elected to the Sha Tin District Council by residents of Lek Yuen constituency.  Biography  Sham grew up in a single-parent family and completed secondary school in 2006. He worked as a legislative assistant for a period after graduating from secondary school. He later joined Rainbow Action, a member organisation of Civil Human Rights Front that advocates for LGBT rights. He started assisting with CHRF's work in 2008, hosting events and managing affairs with human and police rights. He occupied Connaught Road Central along with other protesters after the 1July march in 2011, after which he was arrested for unlawful assembly. He participated in the 2014 Hong Kong protests and became CHRF's convener in 2015, for one year. After Sham left the post of convener, he studied at the Hong Kong Community College, graduating in October 2018 with a higher diploma in social work. He immediately rejoined CHRF, again as convener. This came at a difficult time for the organisation, as it had only in funding with a monthly expenditure of HK$20,000. He is a longtime member of the League of Social Democrats and joined its executive committee in 2018. He first joined the party because it was the first in Hong Kong to include LGBT issues in its platform. In 2020, Time magazine named Sham one of \\"20 people to watch\\", the only Hong Kong citizen on the list. He responded, \\"Hong Kong people deserve more attention from the outside world than themselves.\\" = Sexuality = Sham is openly gay; he married his husband, a flight attendant, in New York in 2014. He is an active campaigner for LGBT rights in Hong Kong. As a secretary, he manages daily operations for Rainbow of Hong Kong, helps organise annual LGBT rallies and hosted an LGBT programme on Citizens' Radio. Sham was also the spokesperson for the 2018 Hong Kong Pride Parade, which drew 12,000 people, a record high. = 2019‚Äì20 Hong Kong protests = As convener of Civil Human Rights Front, Sham helped organise the first and second protest marches against the 2019 Hong Kong extradition bill on 31 March and 28 April, and helped organise the protest march against the bill on 9June. The number of participants at this march exceeded his expectations: CHRF set a target of 300,000 protesters, and he estimated that more than a million people participated. On 13 June, after the Hong Kong government's announcement of its intention to restart debating the bill, as well as the clashes at the Legislative Council (LegCo), Sham decided to organize another protest march on 16 June, which meant they had only four days to advertise it. He estimated that there were close to two million participants at the 16 June protest. Sham noted that CHRF is unable to mobilise large numbers of people to participate in protests, and that the high number of protesters in the 2019 protests was caused by public awareness and poor governance by the Hong Kong government. He described CHRF's role in the protests as providing a platform for citizens to express their views. He said that CHRF estimates participants at protests by counting the participants from footbridges. Sham organised the 1July march in 2019, demanding a full retraction of the amendment bill and for Chief Executive Carrie Lam to step down. = 2019 District Council elections = Sham speaking to the press after winning his seat on the Sha Tin District Council. Sham was elected to the Sha Tin District Council during the 2019 District Council elections. He represents the pro-democracy League of Social Democrats in Lek Yuen constituency. His campaign activities were temporarily disrupted by the October 2019 attack, but he returned to the streets to campaign on crutches. Sham was elected on 24 November 2019, unseating incumbent Michael Wong Yue-hon of the pro-Beijing Civil Force. = 2020 pro- democracy primaries = Sham ran as a candidate of the League of Social Democrats for Kowloon West during the pro-democracy primaries of July 2020 and won the election with 24,144 votes, 31.82% of the electorate. = 2020 legislative council election = On 30 July 2020, 12 candidates were disqualified by the Hong Kong government, and it was also announced that the rest of the candidacies were still being reviewed, with some saying that most of the pro-democracy camp were to be disqualified. On 31 July, Chief Executive Carrie Lam announced that due to the COVID-19 pandemic in Hong Kong, the elections would be postponed for a year without setting a new date. On 3 August, HK01 reported that Sham and other four others had also been disqualified. Sham said that he was not afraid of disqualification and that he would continue his protests against the national security law. He also received a letter from the electoral commission telling him his nomination was being reviewed.  Harassment and physical attacks  = Attack over sexual orientation = On 7 July 2019, DAB politician and LegCo member Ann Chiang uploaded a video to Facebook slamming Sham for being gay and alleging that he intentionally concealed his sexuality to gain status with the pan-democracy camp in Hong Kong. The video showed him in drag at an event, with captions \\"Deliberately concealing that, for power, money or fame?\\" and \\"Corrupting social morals, just disgusting.\\" Sham is openly gay and participates in LGBT rights organisations. He responded on social media, criticizing Chiang's attacks and encouraging those remaining in the closet not to feel ashamed of their sexualiity. The video was instantly criticized by gay groups and was removed by Facebook for violating its community standards. On 19 July, Sham and LegCo member Raymond Chan Chi-chuen protested in front of the Equal Opportunities Commission together with a number of LGBT rights organisations. The pair submitted a petition with more than 2,000 signatures demanding that EOC chairman Ricky Chu Man-kin condemn Chiang's statements. Chiang later accused Sham of not being \\"ready\\" if he considered her comments to be an attack. Sham was one of the coordinators of a demonstration on 8 December 2019. His attempts to communicate with the Hong Kong Police Force about the demonstration were rejected by the police, who called him a \\"damn gay man\\" (Ê≠ªÂü∫‰Ω¨). = Attacks during the 2019‚Äì20 Hong Kong protests = On 29 August, around 30 people gathered near Rainbow of Hong Kong's headquarters in Jordan, Hong Kong at 11 a.m. for a \\"Denounce Civil Human Rights Front\\" demonstration. Sham said the organisers wrongly listed CHRF's address as Rainbow of Hong Kong, and arrived at the venue 10 minutes earlier to talk to the protesters. Some protesters said they were there to oppose CHRF and scolded Sham using foul language. They also pushed apart and scolded reporters there, saying reporters at the scene were \\"fake\\". Some supporters of Sham were at the scene as well. During the chaos, several plainclothes law enforcement officers who attempted to separate the two groups of people were also scolded. A group of protesters continued to chant slogans after Sham left the premises, and stopped only after passersby shouted at them to leave. Sham later explained that Rainbow of Hong Kong was not a member organisation of CHRF, and he thought it was funny that protesters insisted on staying there. At 12:50 p.m. that day, Sham and his friend Lo were assaulted by two masked men in a restaurant in Jordan with a softball bat and an iron tube. Sham's friend was hit three times in his arm resulting in swelling, and was sent to hospital; Sham was unharmed. Two men, aged 15 and 44, were later arrested over the attack. On 16 October, while on the way to a CHRF meeting, Sham was attacked on the street with a hammer by four to five people in Tai Kok Tsui, Kowloon. He was taken, bleeding heavily, to Kwong Wah Hospital. On 27 July 2020, the trial for the first attack began. The 15-year-old boy charged with attacking Sham and his friend in the first incident told the court that he was given HK$3,000 to attack him while the other defendant, a 29-year-old man, pleaded guilty to conspiracy to cause bodily harm. On 29 July, the 29-year-old said in court that a HK$2 million bounty was offered to \\"cripple\\" Sham saying that \\"some Hongkonger in Tuen Mun wanted to cripple his leg.\\" On 21 September, the 29-year-old was sentenced to 46 months in prison and the teenager to a training centre.

Background  On 24 September 2019 it was announced that FORUM was selected to become ESA's ninth Earth Explorer mission, beating the Sea surface KInematics Multiscale monitoring (SKIM) proposal following a two-year feasibility study phase The main scientific purpose of FORUM is to better understand the Earth's radiation budget - the balance between the incoming radiation mostly from the Sun at short wavelengths, and outgoing radiation, which is a combination of reflected radiation from the Sun and radiation emitted by the Earth system, much of it a longer wavelengths - and the way this exchange is affected by the changes in the Earth's atmosphere caused by human activity. FORUM will especially be measuring the long-wavelength outgoing energy, which is strongly influenced by water vapour and thin ice clouds in the Earth's atmosphere. According to available data, about 50 percent of the total energy emitted by the Earth is in this long-wavelength range, but these emissions were not monitored in detail from space until now. These insights will offer a better understanding of the climatic changes taking place on Earth and improve climate predictions. According to ESA, the FORUM mission was selected over SKIM specifically because it promises to \\"fill in a critical missing piece of the climate jigsaw\\". The mission is planned for a 2025 or 2026 launch and its budget, which will be decided in November 2019, is expected to cost a maximum of 260 million euros.

He is a member of the KID party, and represents the Artibonite department. Cantave was first elected to the Senate in the 2015‚Äì16 Haitian parliamentary election, one of three KID candidates to win Senate seats that election, along with Dieupie Cherubin and Onondieu Louis. He was elected President of the Senate on January 17, 2019, when he received 16 votes from the Senate, defeating his opponent Senator Pierre Francois Sildor, who received 12. After ex-Haitian rebel leader Guy Philippe was arrested on drug- trafficking charges and deported to the United States, Cantave led the push for a resolution \\"energetically condemning\\" the action, saying the Senate was \\"humiliated\\" by it. Cantave was President of the Senate when Prime Minister Jean-Henry C√©ant was ousted, and was involved with talks with President Jovenel Mo√Øse about the choice of a new prime minister in 2019. During contentious efforts to install Jean-Michel Lapin as Prime Minister, opposing senators accused Cantave of siding with the county's executive office in violation of the Constitution of Haiti; Senator N√®nel Cassy said Cantave \\"has refused to listen to the voice of reason\\". Following Lapin's resignation, Cantave opposed Mo√Øse's preferred candidate his replacement as Prime Minister, and instead Cantave and Lower Chamber President Gary Bodeau put Fritz-William Michel forward as a compromise. Confirmation proceedings for Michel in 2019 were contentious, with politicians engaging in physical fights in the national assembly, and Cantave provided instructions to police that only senators would be allowed into the Senate precinct for the proceedings. Cantave himself was forced to retreat to his car as protesters threw rocks at him outside of Parliament, and his foundation offices in Gona√Øves were attacked and destroyed during protests. Prior to his election to the Senate, Cantave worked as Minister of Health in Artibonite. During his time in that position, Cantave worked to secure financial assistance from nongovernmental organizations to renovate La Providence Hospital in Gona√Øves after it was severely damaged by Hurricane Jeanne in September 2004. In 2017 Cantave introduced a measure banning same-sex marriages in Haiti. Offenders could face up to three years in prison. The measure would also make ‚Äúpublic demonstration of support‚Äù for homosexuality illegal. The bill was approved by the Haitian Senate. In September 2019 Cantave was involved in a scandal concerning bribery accusations. Senator Sorel Jacinthe publicly accused Cantave of offering him and four other Senators money to vote in favor of President Jovenel Mo√Øse's new prime minister Fritz William Michel. Cantave denied the accusations.

Strack also confessed to killing his grandfather in December 2003, but this claim hasn't been conclusively proven. Early life Born into a family with German roots, Strack lived his with his mother and older brother, a security guard, as his father lived separately from them and rarely saw Ivan. At school, he was described as a handsome, well-mannered boy with a nerdy appearance, although a rather quiet one. In November 2004, his mother passed away suddenly, and little Ivan was taken under the care of his older brother, who took full custody of him. It's unclear how this tragedy affected Strack, but it presumably had a taxing effect on his psyche. Murders =Andrei Strack= Andrei Andreyevich Strack, Ivan's 64-year-old grandfather, had a past littered with crime: since around the mid-1960s of the Soviet era, he was tried for several types of crimes, including hooliganism, possession of weapons and drugs (a rare offence for that time). After the regime's fall, Andrei began running a legitimate business as the owner of a parking lot, but rumors persisted that he had illegally acquired a number of cafes and enterprises around the city. On December 6, 2004, the former convict was brutally murdered in his apartment. According to the investigators, Andrei likely knew his killer, as he had opened his door to them; it was highly unlikely to be a break-in, as his door was equipped with magnets and was opened using a remote control. The elder Strack had suffered injuries to the back of his head and his occipital lobe, inflicted with a sharp weapon, as he was likely bled out on the carpet after being struck. Upon discovery by his sibling Nikolai and his wife Nelly, a large kitchen knife covered in blood was found lying nearby, the walls stained with blood, along with the grim detail of Andrei's fingers being cut off. Robbery was ruled out as a motive, as a massive gold chain, an expensive watch and two signet rings were found laying on a table next to the body. According to Ivan's confession, on that day he had visited his grandfather to exchange some videotapes. During his stay there, the two started a trivial argument over some buckwheat porridge, which Ivan had dropped on the carpet, along with a plate. After allegedly killing Andrei, Ivan continued to live on as if nothing had happened, even acquiring a newspaper article about the murder from a classmate who had brought it to school. Out of respect, the other student handed it over to the supposedly grieving grandson. Doubt was quickly cast over this confession, as it was likely that Andrei - a tall, healthy man weighing around 120 kilograms - would've been able to prevent his 14-year-old attacker from harming him just by raw strength. Authorities interpreted it as Strack just taking the blame for a crime he hadn't committed, a theory supported by his relatives. =Katya Shkurko and Anya Shibaeva= Both students of the 10th-secondary school, the 13-year-old Katya was a love interest for Ivan, who also studied in the school. She was considered his girlfriend by her classmates, as they often talked together, with Strack also visiting her house. At some point, she broke up with him, and they no longer saw each other as often. On March 6, 2005, Shkurko was called by Strack so they could take a walk through the forest, to which she agreed, bringing the 11-year-old Anya along. The trio were together for a long time, taking in the beautiful surrounding scenery and talking to each other. At some point, Strack pulled out a knife and starting stabbing Katya a total of 10 times in the face, neck and chest. Frightened, Shibaeva ran away in horror, but Ivan caught up to her and stabbed her 4 times until she was dead. He then hid the body behind some bushes, and stole both of the girls' phones, which he had wanted to have for a long time. The following day, Shkurko's body was found by a retired military doctor named Nikolai Kirilenko, who had a country house in the area. He immediately realized that she was dead, and called the authorities, who soon found Shibaeva's body around 10 meters away. Noting that their phones were missing, police started an investigation into the possible clues, which led them back to Ivan Strack, who had put up one of the phones for sale. While conducting a search of his home, the other phone was also located. Soon after, the young Strack confessed to the murders in detail, without much of an expression, including that of his grandfather. Soon after the events, he was sent off to a psychiatric hospital in Tula, where he would remain for another 12 years. =Ekaterina Frolova= In 2017, Strack was released from prison, and started work in a salon. His workplace was shared with a store, where 20-year-old Ekaterina Frolova worked. It is alleged that Ivan might've developed feelings for Frolova, but he only confessed to wanting her phone. He was also mad at her, as she hadn't paid him for some kind of repairing he had done. Brandishing a knife, on July 8th, he broke into Ekaterina's apartment and killed her, also attacking her 19-year- old Anastasia Khlebnikova.

March 1957) is Professor of Psychological Science, University of California, Irvine. She specializes in life-span developmental psychology, motivation, individual agency and social context. She expanded her education at the Center for Social and Behavioral Science, Stanford University and at the Center for Interdisciplinary Research, University Bielefeld, Germany. At the Department of Psychological Science at University of California, Irvine, she teaches in the areas of life-span development and motivational psychology. Heckhausen worked with Richard Schulz and formulated the life-span theory of control, their journal article was published in 1995 as A life-span theory of control. Further developments of their conceptual framework into a motivational theory of life-span development were published with co-author Carsten Wrosch in 2010 and 2019.  Biography  Jutta Heckhausen is the daughter of German psychologist Heinz Heckhausen. Heckhausen grew up in M√ºnster/Westfalen and Bochum, Germany. She maintains her permanent residency in the United States. Heckhausen earned both her Vordiplom (B.A.) in Psychology and Philosophy and Diplom in Psychology (M.A.) at Ruhr-Universit√§t Bochum, Germany in 1997 and 1980, respectively. In the following years from 1981 to 1983, she completed her graduate studies and research on child development at the University of Strathclyde, Glasgow, Great Britain. Heckhausen earned two graduate scholarships between 1981 and 1984, they were the Graduate scholarship of the German Academic Exchange Service (1981 to 1983), and the Graduate scholarship of the Doctorate Program for Developmental Psychology funded by the Volkswagen-Foundation (1983-1984). She earned her Ph. D. in Psychology in 1985 at the University of Strathclyde where she studied development in infants through the joint-interactions with their mothers. From 1984 through 1986, Heckhausen worked as a post-doctoral fellow at the Center for Life-Span Psychology at the Max-Planck-Institute for Human Development in Berlin. During these years, she taught undergraduate and graduate courses in developmental psychology, motivation, personality, and educational psychology at the Technical University and Freie Universit√§t in Berlin. She worked as a research scientist from 1987 to 1996 and became a senior scientist with her own research group in 1996. This same year, she earned her Habilitation (Venia Legendi) in Psychology at Freie Universit√§t Berlin, Germany. She was an associate member of the John D. and Catherine T. MacArthur Foundation Research Network on Successful Mid-Life Development from 1991 to 1998. Between these years, from 1995-1996 Heckhausen worked as a fellow at the Center for Advanced Study in the Behavioral Sciences at Stanford. In December 2000, Heckhausen joined the University of California, Irvine as a professor of the Department of Psychology and Social Behavior. She established the research laboratory on Life-Span Development and Motivation. She was a part-time visiting professor at the Ruprecht-Karl University Heidelberg, Germany in 2013 and 2014. From 2015 to 2016, Heckhausen worked as a fellow at the Center for Interdisciplinary Research University of Bielefeld, Germany. She is currently a member of the Board of Trustees of the Leibniz Institute for Educational Trajectories in Bamberg, Germany . She is a fellow of the Gerontological Society of America since 2011 and a fellow of the Association of Psychological Science since 2016.  Awards  Heckhausen received the 1999 Max Planck Research Award for International Cooperation, and the 2014 Baltes Distinguished Research Achievement Award from the American Psychological Association. and the 2020 Distinguished Career Contribution to Gerontology Award, Behavioral and Social Sciences Section, Gerontological Society of America In 2012 Heckhausen presented the Paul B. Baltes Lecture at the Berlin- Brandenburg Academy of Sciences and Humanities. Awards Heckhausen received from the University of California, Irvine include the Teaching Excellence Award in 2005, Faculty Mentor of the Month for the Undergraduate Research Opportunity Program in May 2014, and the 2014 Chancellor's Award for Excellence in Fostering Undergraduate Research for her work with her undergraduate student Cynthia Sanchez.  Research  Jutta Heckhausen's research revolves around motivational processes and their relation to the development of individuals as they transition through different stages and confront various challenges in their lives. Much of her current research, for example, addresses social mobility in the context of transitions from school to college to the workplace. In 1999, Heckhausen published a monograph Developmental regulation in adulthood: Age-normative and sociostructural constraints as adaptive challenges, which comprises her work on the life-span theory of control and related empirical studies in the 1990s. In 2008 and 2018, Heckhausen co-edited the second and third edition of the book Motivation and Action with Heinz Heckhausen (first edition published in German in 1980). The book includes an in-depth presentation of the history of motivation and presents new theories and research findings pertaining to motivation, implicit and explicit motives, volition, self-regulation, and their development. The book also discusses the role of motivation in school and college, work environment, and sports. Heckhausen and her collaborator Richard Schulz, formulated the life-span theory of control and tested its premise and relation to developmental in adulthood. They co-authored the journal article A life- span theory of control in 1995. This theory is based on the concepts of primary control and secondary control. Primary control refers to behaviors directed at the external environment, involves individuals' attempts to change the environment to fit their needs, and has functional primacy over secondary control. Secondary control involves the internal environment of motivation, emotion, and cognition, which helps the individual cope with failure and direct the individual toward life goals using motivational resources and processes. In the following year, Schulz and Heckhausen published the article A life span model of successful aging which discusses the development of the model in relation to conceptions of successful aging. The article proposes a key role of primary control for adaptive aging, and lays out processes of optimization which guide the selection of goals and the compensation of control loss. Heckhausen co-authored A motivational theory of life-span development with Schulz and Carsten Wrosch in 2010. This article presents new developments of the theory, specifically the model of optimization in primary and secondary control and the action-phase model of developmental regulation. A set of 15 theoretical propositions based on these models are discussed and the relevant empirical evidence is reviewed. In 2019, Heckhausen, Wrosch, and Schulz published an updated review of their theory and relevant empirical research in the Annual Review of Psychology. The article discusses individual agency in life-span development in terms of the pursuit of long-term goals and their action cycles from goal selection to goal engagement, disengagement and goal adjustment in anticipation of and response to life-course changes in the controllability of these goals. Empirical research shows that individual differences in the capacity to regulate own motivation and action throughout such long-term action cycles have consequences for people's development, life course, health, and well-being.

Symptoms can initially mimic common pulmonary diagnoses like pneumonia, but individuals typically do not respond to antibiotic therapy. Individuals usually present for care within a few days to weeks of symptom onset. Starting, in September 2019, the US Centers for Disease Control and Prevention (CDC) has been reporting on a nation-wide outbreak of severe lung disease linked to vaping, or the process of inhaling aerosolized substances with battery-operated electronic cigarettes (e-cigarettes), ciga-likes, or vape mods. The cases of lung injury date back to at least April 2019. , 2,758 cases of VAPI have been reported to the CDC, with 64 confirmed deaths. All CDC-reported cases of VAPI involve a history of using e-cigarette, or vaping, products, with most samples testing positive for tetrahydrocannabinol (THC) by the US FDA to date and most patients reporting a history of using a THC-containing product. Recent CDC data shows that the outbreak peaked in September 2019, and has declined steadily to a low level through January 2020. In late February 2020, a CDC publication in the NEJM stated that the VAPI outbreak was \\"driven by the use of THC-containing products from informal and illicit sources.\\" The CDC says that the additive vitamin E acetate is very strongly implicated in VAPI, but evidence is not yet sufficient to rule out contribution of other chemicals of concern to VAPI as of January 2020. Signs and symptoms Commonly reported symptoms include shortness of breath, cough, fatigue, body aches, fever, nausea, vomiting, and diarrhea. Additional symptoms may include chest pain, abdominal pain, chills, or weight loss. Symptoms can initially mimic common pulmonary diagnoses like pneumonia, but individuals typically do not respond to antibiotic therapy. In some patients, gastrointestinal symptoms can precede respiratory symptoms. Individuals typically present for care within a few days to weeks of symptom onset. At the time of hospital presentation, the individual is often hypoxic and meets systemic inflammatory response syndrome (SIRS) criteria, including fever. Physical exam can reveal rapid heart rate or rapid breathing. Auscultation of the lungs tends to be unremarkable, even in patients with severe lung disease. In some cases, the affected individuals have progressive respiratory failure, leading to intubation. Several affected individuals have needed to be placed in the intensive care unit (ICU) and on mechanical ventilation. Time to recovery for hospital discharge has ranged from days to weeks.  Mechanism  alt=Schematic of a typical e-cigarette with a cartridge containing nicotine dissolved in propylene glycol. Vaping refers to the practice of inhaling an aerosol from an electronic cigarette device, which works by heating a liquid that can contain various substances, including nicotine, tetrahydrocannabinol (THC), flavoring, and additives (e.g. glycerin (sold as vegetable glycerine (VG)), propylene glycol (PG)). The long-term health impacts of vaping are unknown. Glycerin was long thought to be a safe option. However, the carcinogen formaldehyde is known as a product of propylene glycol and glycerol vapor degradation, these ingredients may also cause lung inflammation. Most individuals treated for VAPI report vaping the cannabis compounds THC and/or cannabidiol (CBD), and some also report vaping nicotine products. In addition to vaping, some individuals have also experienced VAPI through \\"dabbing.\\" Dabbing uses a different type of device to heat and extract cannabinoids for inhalation. It is a process that entails superheating and inhaling particles into the lungs that contain THC and other types of cannabidiol plant materials. VAPI appears to be a type of acute lung injury, similar to acute fibrinous pneumonitis, organizing pneumonia, or diffuse alveolar damage. VAPI appears to be a general term for various causes of acute lung damage due to vaping. There is no evidence of an infectious etiology causing VAPI. No single compound or ingredient has emerged as the cause of these illnesses . Many different substances and product sources are still under investigation. The CDC stated that the latest national and state findings suggest products containing THC, particularly from informal sources like friends, family, or in-person or online dealers, are linked to most of the cases and play a major role in the outbreak. The CDC states that vitamin E acetate is a very strong culprit of concern in VAPI, having been found in 29 out of 29 lung biopsies tested from ten different states, but evidence is not yet sufficient to rule out contribution of other chemicals of concern to VAPI. The CDC states that previous research suggests inhaled vitamin E acetate may interfere with normal lung functioning. A 2020 study found that vaped vitamin E acetate produced exceptionally toxic ketene gas, and carcinogic alkenes and benzene.  Diagnosis  High clinical suspicion is necessary to make the diagnosis of VAPI. As of October 2019, VAPI is considered a diagnosis of exclusion because no specific tests or markers exist for its diagnosis, as of October 2019. Healthcare providers should evaluate for alternative diagnoses (e.g., cardiac, gastrointestinal, rheumatologic, neoplastic, environmental, or occupational exposures, or causes of acute respiratory distress syndrome) as suggested by clinical presentation and medical history, while also considering multiple etiologies, including the possibility of VAPI occurring with a concomitant infection. All healthcare providers evaluating patients for VAPI should consider obtaining a thorough patient history, including symptoms and recent use of e-cigarette, or vaping, products, along with substances used, duration and frequency of use, and method of use. Additionally a detailed physical examination should be performed, specifically including vital signs and pulse-oximetry. Laboratory testing guided by clinical findings, which may include a respiratory virus panel to rule out infectious diseases, complete blood count with differential, serum inflammatory markers (C-reactive protein [CRP], erythrocyte sedimentation rate [ESR]), liver transaminases, and urine toxicology testing, including testing for THC should be acquired. Imaging, typically a chest X-ray, with consideration for a chest CT if chest X-ray results do not correlate with the clinical picture or to evaluate severe or worsening disease should be obtained. Consulting with specialists (e.g. critical care, pulmonology, medical toxicology, or infectious disease) can help guide further evaluation. The diagnosis is commonly suspected when the person does not respond to antibiotic therapy, and testing does not reveal an alternative diagnosis. Many of the reported cases involved worsening respiratory failure within 48 hours of admission after the administration of empiric antibiotic therapy. Lung biopsies are not necessary for the diagnosis but are performed as clinically indicated to rule out the likelihood of infection. Bronchoalveolar lavage sample from a patient with acute lung injury associated with vaping, showing alveolar macrophages laden with vacuoles (A) and extensive lipid deposits (B). There are non-specific laboratory abnormalities that have been reported in association with the disease, including elevations in white blood cell count (with neutrophilic predominance and absence of eosinophilia), transaminases, procalcitonin, and inflammatory markers. Infectious disease testing, including blood and sputum cultures and tests for influenza, Mycoplasma, and Legionella were all found to be negative in the majority of reported cases. Imaging abnormalities are typically bilateral and are usually described as \\"pulmonary infiltrates or opacities\\" on chest X-ray and \\"ground-glass opacities\\" on chest CT. Bronchoalveolar lavage specimens may exhibit an increased level of neutrophils in combination with lymphocytes and vacuole-laden macrophages. Lavage cytology with oil red O staining demonstrated extensive lipid-laden alveolar macrophages. In the few cases in which lung biopsies were performed, the results were consistent with acute lung injury and included a broad range of features, such as acute fibrinous pneumonitis, diffuse alveolar damage, lipid-laden macrophages, and organizing pneumonia. Lung biopsies often showed neutrophil predominance as well, with rare eosinophils. = Case definitions = Based on the clinical characteristics of VAPI cases from ongoing federal and state investigations, interim surveillance case definitions for confirmed and probable cases have been developed. The CDC surveillance case definition for confirmed cases of severe pulmonary disease associated with e-cigarette use: * Using an e-cigarette (\\"vaping\\") or dabbing during the 90 days before symptom onset AND * Pulmonary infiltrate, such as opacities on plain film chest radiograph or ground-glass opacities on chest computed tomography AND * Absence of pulmonary infection on initial work-up. Minimum criteria include: ** A negative respiratory viral panel ** A negative influenza polymerase chain reaction or rapid test if local epidemiology supports testing. ** All other clinically indicated respiratory infectious disease testing (e.g., urine antigen for Streptococcus pneumoniae and Legionella, sputum culture if productive cough, bronchoalveolar lavage culture if done, blood culture, human immunodeficiency virus‚Äìrelated opportunistic respiratory infections if appropriate) must be negative and * No evidence in medical record of alternative plausible diagnoses (e.g., cardiac, rheumatologic, or neoplastic process). The CDC surveillance case definition for probable cases of severe pulmonary disease associated with e-cigarette use: * Using an e-cigarette (\\"vaping\\") or dabbing in 90 days before symptom onset AND * Pulmonary infiltrate, such as opacities on plain film chest radiograph or ground-glass opacities on chest computed tomography AND * Infection identified via culture or polymerase chain reaction, but clinical team believes this is not the sole cause of the underlying respiratory disease process OR minimum criteria to rule out pulmonary infection not met (testing not performed) and clinical team believes this is not the sole cause of the underlying respiratory disease process and * No evidence in medical record of alternative plausible diagnoses (e.g., cardiac, rheumatologic, or neoplastic process). These surveillance case definitions are meant for public health data collection purposes and are not intended to be used as a clinical diagnostic tool or to guide clinical care; they are subject to change and will be updated as additional information becomes available. = Differential diagnosis = As VAPI is, as of October 2019, a diagnosis of exclusion, a variety of respiratory diseases must be ruled out before a diagnosis of VAPI can be made. The differential diagnosis should include more common diagnostic possibilities, such as community- acquired pneumonia, as well as do-not-miss diagnoses, such as pulmonary embolism. Other commonly documented hospital diagnoses for cases of severe pulmonary disease associated with e-cigarette use have included acute respiratory distress syndrome (ARDS), sepsis, acute hypoxic respiratory failure, and pneumonitis. As of September 2019, distinctions are still being made between processes occurring in association with vaping or the use of nicotine-containing liquids and those considered as alternative diagnoses to VAPI. These processes include the following: * Acute eosinophilic pneumonia * Hypersensitivity pneumonitis * Respiratory bronchiolitis interstitial lung disease * Organizing pneumonia * Lipoid pneumonia * Diffuse alveolar hemorrhage * Giant cell pneumonitis The use of imaging and other diagnostic modalities, including chest CT, bronchoscopy with bronchoalveolar lavage, and lung biopsy, may provide additional information to determine the presence of these processes and potentially establish a definitive diagnosis, but are generally not performed unless clinically indicated.  Treatment  =CDC recommendations for primary care= , the CDC has published updated interim guidance based on the most current data to provide a framework for healthcare providers in their management and follow-up of persons with symptoms of VAPI. Initial management involves deciding whether to admit a patient with possible VAPI to the hospital. Currently, the CDC recommends that patients with suspected VAPI should be admitted if they have decreased O saturation (<95%) on room air, are in respiratory distress, or have comorbidities that compromise pulmonary reserve. Once admitted, initiation of corticosteroids should be considered, which have been found to be helpful in treating this injury. Several case reports describe improvement with corticosteroids, likely because of a blunting of the inflammatory response. In a group of patients in Illinois and Wisconsin, 92% of 50 patients received corticosteroids, and those that began glucocorticoid therapy continued on it for at least 7 days. The medical team documented in 65% of 46 patient notes that \\"respiratory improvement was due to the use of glucocorticoids\\". Among 140 cases reported nationally to the CDC that received corticosteroids, 82% of patients improved. In patients with more severe illness, a more aggressive empiric therapy with corticosteroids as well as antimicrobial and antiviral therapy may be warranted. As a large proportion of patients were admitted to an intensive care unit based on data submitted to the CDC, many patients require supplemental oxygen via nasal cannula, high-flow oxygen, bilevel positive airway pressure (BiPAP), or mechanical ventilation. During influenza season, health care providers should consider influenza in all patients with suspected VAPI. Decisions on initiation or discontinuation of treatment should be based on specific clinical features and, when appropriate, in consultation with specialists. Special consideration should be given to high-risk patients such as the elderly, those with a history of cardiac or lung disease, or pregnant individuals. Patients over 50 years old have an increased risk of intubation and might need longer hospitalizations. CDC says patients should be advised to discontinue the use of vaping products upon hospital admission and during outpatient follow-up, to speed recovery and avoid potential recurrence of symptoms or lung injury. Evidence-based tobacco product quitting strategies include behavioral counseling and U.S. Food and Drug Administration (US FDA)-approved cessation medications. = Follow-up care = Due to reports of relapse during corticosteroid tapers after hospitalization, the CDC recommends scheduling a follow-up visit no later than one to two weeks after discharge from inpatient hospital treatment from VAPI, with considerations for performing pulse-oximetry testing and repeat CXR. In one to two months, healthcare providers should consider additional follow-up testing, including spirometry, diffusion capacity testing, and another repeat CXR. In patients with persistent hypoxemia (O saturation <95%) requiring home oxygen at discharge, consider ongoing pulmonary follow-up. In patients treated with high-dose corticosteroids, consider endocrinology follow-up to monitor adrenal function. As it is unknown whether patients with a history of VAPI are at increased risk for severe complications with influenza or other respiratory infections, follow-up care should also include annual vaccination against influenza for all persons over 6 months of age, including patients with a history of EVALI, as well as administration of the pneumococcal vaccine according to current guidelines. An important part of both inpatient and follow-up care for VAPI involves advising patients to discontinue use of e-cigarette or vaping products. = Public health recommendations = The CDC and the FDA recommend that people not use e-cigarettes or other vaping products that contain THC, particularly products purchased off the street or obtained from informal sources like friends, family, or online sellers. In addition, CDC recommends that individuals not modify or add any substances to e-cigarettes or other vaping products that are not intended by the manufacturer. Avoiding e-cigarettes entirely avoids the risk of VAPI as well as other negative health consequences of vaping, but some health advocates promote e-cigarettes for certain populations as a means to help smokers of conventional cigarettes to quit. Research into the effectiveness of this approach is still incomplete.Hartmann-Boyce J, McRobbie H, Bullen C, Begh R, Stead LF, Hajek P. Electronic cigarettes for smoking cessation.

Epidemiology  An outbreak of vaping-related lung injuries in 2019 and 2020 has mainly affected young people, primarily in the United States. , there have been 2,758 cases of VAPI reported from all 50 states, the District of Columbia, Puerto Rico, and the US Virgin Islands. The CDC has received complete gender and age data on these cases with 70% of cases being male. The median age of cases is 24 years and ranges from 13 to 85 years. 79% of cases are under 35 years old. There have been 64 confirmed deaths in 28 states and the District of Columbia from this outbreak ranging from ages 15‚Äì75 years old. Of the 2,051 cases reported to the CDC, information on substance use is known for 867 cases in the three months prior to symptom onset as of October 15, 2019. About 86% reported using THC-containing products; 34% reported exclusive use of THC-containing products. About 64% reported using nicotine-containing products; 11% reported exclusive use of nicotine-containing products. On September 28, 2019, the first case of vaping- associated pulmonary injury was identified in Canada. A number of other probable cases have been reported in British Columbia and New Brunswick as of October 2019. In September 2019, a US Insurance Journal article stated that at least 15 incidents of vaping related illnesses have been reported worldwide prior to 2019, occurring from Guam to Japan to the UK to the US. 12 cases of health problems with nicotine-containing e-cigarettes were reported to the UK's Medicines and Healthcare products Regulatory Agency (MHRA), with at least one case bearing high similarities to the lipid pneumonia cases reported in the US. One lipoid pneumonia-related death in the UK was associated with e-cigarettes in 2010. Medical officials in continental Europe have not reported any serious medical problems related to vaping products except one early case related to e-cigarettes documented in Northern Spain in 2015. Since many of the cases in North America were traced to THC-cartridges as well as the use of e-cigarette vape products, but THC remains illegal in European countries, the disease burden related to vaping has been significantly lower in Europe despite the prevalence of e-cigarette use. Before the outbreak, one lipoid pneumonia-related death in the UK was associated with e-cigarettes in 2010. 18 year-old Rapha√´l Pauwaert from Brussels died on November 6, 2019, after developing pneumonia and being placed in a medically induced coma because he was unable to breathe on his own. He received an e-cigarette as a gift for his 18th birthday. His doctor stated Pauwaert's fatal lung infection probably resulted from the CBD vapor. This was considered the first death tied to vaping in Belgium. Pauwaert's CBD oils he also used were tested for vitamin E at the Saint-Luc Hospital in November 2019. The death is under investigation by the Brussels Public Prosecutor's Office. A friend of Pauwaert's was also hospitalized with the identical symptoms after using the same type of e-cigarette, but he survived. The first case of a vaping-related lung illness in the Philippines was reported in November 2019. A 16-year-old girl from central Philippines was vaping e-cigarettes for half a year. She had difficulty breathing and was admitted to the hospital in October 2019. She was discharged after she received treatment from a pediatric pulmonologist.

Biography  Born studied psychology, mathematics, and medicine at the University of T√ºbingen and the University of Ulm from 1976-1980. He was a research fellow from 1980-1981 in the Department of Biological Psychology at the State University of New York at Stony Brook. He attended the University of T√ºbingen where he obtained his Ph.D. in Psychology in 1985. As a graduate student, Born investigated the use of potential-related events in studying brain function in humans. After completing his doctorate, Born completed his habilitation in psychology at the University of Ulm (1985-1989). Born was Professor of Physiological Psychology at the Otto-Friedrich-University Bamberg (1989-1998) and Professor of Neuroendocrinology at the University of L√ºbeck (1999-2010) before joining the faculty of the University of T√ºbingen as Chair of Medical Psychology in 2010. Born's work has been supported by Deutsche Forschungsgemeinschaft and by the Federal Ministry of Education and Research.  Research  Born researches and publishes in the field of memory formation during sleep. He was one of the first researchers to show that sleep was causally related to memory. He showed that procedural memories are not consolidated by REM sleep, as has been previously assumed. Instead, he showed that procedural memories are improved when REM sleep is pharmacologically suppressed. Born found that slow-wave sleep reactivates recently encoded memories while REM sleep stabilizes them. As well, his research demonstrated that slow-wave sleep actually consolidates immunological memories (it helps the immune system to identify antigens) as well as psychological memories. He also found that sleep especially assists in consolidating memories that involve a promise of reward. His other work focuses on the metabolic and behavioral control of body weight.

The third named storm of the 2019 North Indian Ocean cyclone season, Hikaa formed on September 22 west of India in the Arabian Sea. The storm reached peak intensity on September 24, with maximum sustained winds estimated over 140 km/h (85 mph). Later that day, the storm made landfall in eastern Oman south of Duqm, and quickly dissipated over the Arabian Peninsula. Meteorological history An area of convection, or thunderstorms, persisted along the west coast of India on September 19. A distinct low pressure area developed a day later off the coast of Maharashtra. By September 21, a circulation was consolidating within the system, located east of the heaviest convection. The system moved slowly westward across the Arabian Sea, steered by a ridge to north. Warm water temperatures favored further development, despite moderate wind shear. Early on September 22, the India Meteorological Department (IMD) designated the system as a depression, and soon upgraded it to a deep depression. Late on September 22, the American-based Joint Typhoon Warning Center (JTWC) initiated advisories on the system, designating it Tropical Cyclone 03A. At the time, the storm had a compact area of thunderstorms, supported by outflow from the south. Due to decreasing wind shear and warm, moist air, the system quickly intensified on September 23, prompting the IMD to upgrade the system to Cyclonic Storm Hikaa; later that day the agency upgraded the storm further to a severe cyclonic storm. During the strengthening phase, an eye feature formed in the center of the convection, indicative of strengthening. Considering the storm a \\"midget tropical cyclone\\", the JTWC upgraded Hikaa to the equivalent of hurricane status late on September 23, while the storm was approaching eastern Oman. The IMD followed suit, upgrading Hikaa to a very severe cyclonic storm on September 24, estimating peak winds of 140 km/h (85 mph). Around the same time, the JTWC estimated peak 1 minute winds of 155 km/h (100 mph), based in part on the 26 km (16 mi) eye in the center of the convection. As Hikaa was nearing land, the eye deteriorated, and the JTWC assessed that the storm weakened. The IMD meanwhile assessed that the cyclone maintained its peak intensity. Around 14:00 UTC on September 24, Hikaa made landfall in eastern Oman just north of Duqm, becoming the first very severe cyclonic storm on record to strike the country in September. Before Hikaa, only two depressions had struck Oman in the month of September, in 1929 and 1979. The storm quickly weakened over land, as dry air and land interaction diminished the convection. Early on September 25, the IMD downgraded Hikaa to a deep depression, and later to a low pressure area, by which time the storm was near the border of Oman and Saudi Arabia. Preparations and impact While Hikaa was first forming, the IMD warned fishermen of the potential of high waves. Officials in Oman advised residents to prepare for the storm and to avoid low-lying areas.https://timesofoman.com/article/1969376/Oman/Environment/Breaking- Cyclone-Hikaa-to-make-landfall-in-Oman-imminently In advance of the storm, all schools were closed in Al Wusta and South Sharqiyah governorates. Ferry service to the offshore Masirah Island was canceled. About 750 people evacuated to nine shelters in Al Wusta Governorate, where Hikaa moved ashore. In Duqm near where Hikaa struck Oman, the airport recorded sustained winds of 96 km/h (60 mph), with gusts to 124 km/h (77 mph). Hikaa dropped heavy rainfall as it struck eastern Oman, reaching in some locations. The storm also produced waves. A deep-sea fishing boat with a crew of 11 capsized off of Masirah Island during the storm; there were five confirmed fatalities from the shipwreck, and one person was rescued. On the Omani mainland, Hikaa flooded roads and wadis - typically dry riverbeds. In Haima, six people required rescue when they were trapped on a bus in floodwaters. Aon estimated the damage total in the \\"millions\\", based on hundreds of properties reporting damage.

Founded in 2017 before the commencement of the 2017 FIFA U-17 World Cup, which was held in India, the group based their name on the nickname of the national team, the \\"Blue Tigers\\". They consider travelling with the national teams to wherever the teams play as their pilgrimage. They often display flags, banners, and tifos in support of the national team.  History  national flag and their own banners at the 2018 Intercontinental Cup Until the 2000s, India football fans were mostly scattered, being widely based in West Bengal, North-East India, Goa, and Kerala. Other than matches at the Asian Games, Nehru Cup, or SAFF Championship, fans showed up in small numbers when the team played, and fans of different clubs used to support the team in their respective local venues. In 2017, the Blue Pilgrims were established as the first organised fan club for the national team. The Blue Pilgrims were formed with a motive to support the national team and the U-17 team during the historic 2017 U17 World Cup, India's first-ever FIFA competition participation. Begun with some 300 fans, the group grew to encompass thousands, with fans from different regions and with different allegiances coming together to support the Blue Tigers. They call themselves the devotees of the Blue Tigers, and their objective is to support India national football teams of all genders and ages, wherever they play. For their dedication, they have been called the \\"12th man\\" of the team.  Chants, slogans, and banners  The Blue Pilgrims's most common chants are: \\"Oh India!\\", \\"In Unity we stand\\", \\"Oh India we stand for you!\\", and \\"Vande Mataram\\". Their sports anthems are \\"Oh when the blues go marching in, I wanna be in that number!\\" (sung to the tune of \\"When the Saints Go Marching In\\"), and \\"Hum honge kaamyab\\" (We Shall Overcome). Since their formation, the Blue Pilgrims celebrate after every match with the Viking clap together with national team members. Fans of the India national football team display the country's tricolour national flag and also wear blue jerseys in solidarity with the team. They use to display banners inscribed with Blue Pilgrims along with their motto \\"Inquilab-e-Indian football\\" (Revolution of Indian football), a catchphrase which signifies their ongoing effort and struggle as a movement for supporting the national team. They often shouted their common slogan, \\"We love you, wherever you go, we follow!\\".  Notable events  = Response to captain's call = The 3D Blue Tiger tifo displayed by Blue Pilgrims in June 2018 On 2 June 2018, then-team captain Sunil Chhetri posted a video on social media urging the fans to come out at Mumbai to support the team after a poor crowd appearance of only 2,569 at a match against Chinese Taipei in the 2018 Intercontinental Cup. India achieved a significant victory in that match, winning by 5‚Äì0 with Chhetri scoring a hat- trick, but few fans were present to celebrate. Responding to the captain's call, the Blue Pilgrims and football supporters made sure that the stadiums were full during the next few matches. In the final of that tournament, the Blue Pilgrims displayed a tall 3D tifo of a Blue Tiger, the first ever in the team's history. = Protest against AIFF and FSDL = Blue Pilgrims's protest against AIFF and FSDL During the 2019 Intercontinental Cup on 13 July, the Blue Pilgrims unveiled a banner inscribed \\"Football Doesn't Matter, Money Does?\\" before India's match against North Korea at the TransStadia Arena in Ahmedabad. Their protest was against the All India Football Federation (AIFF) and the Football Sports Development (FSDL) due to their failure to resolve the issues related to the two simultaneous top tier leagues in Indian football; the Indian Super League (ISL) and the I-League. The protest was mainly due to the unfair treatment of I-league clubs with respect to media, visibility and coverage, and further to highlight the then circumstances of Indian football where multiple clubs were shutting down or at the juncture to shut down. The AIFF's plan was also to give the premier league position in the country to the ISL, played by newly-formed clubs in India, ahead of the popular I-League, which is played by long-established football clubs of India. This decision would give the ISL winner the AFC Champions League's preliminary round allocated berth, and also the AFC Cup's group stage allocated berth, which were previously given to I-league winners for being the top league of the country. When match organisers at the stadium asked the fans to refrain from displaying these banners, they wore shirts instead which displayed the words \\"GREED > FOOTBALL?\\" to protest against the FSDL. = Homage to T. Ao = Tifo of Talimeren Ao, unveiled by Blue Pilgrims in Guwahati, 2019 On 5 September 2019, the Blue Pilgrims in collaboration with the Highlander Brigade, displayed a huge tifo of the former India national football team captain Talimeren Ao during the 2022 World Cup qualifying match against Oman. With that they unveiled their banner \\"The Revolutionary\\", and also displayed a mosaic forming the words \\"AO 1\\" with the help of a card stunt to pay homage to the legendary captain. Ao had led India at the 1948 Olympics in the match against France, the first match India played after Independence. Ao hailed from Nagaland, a state in the northeastern region of India, and because the anniversary of his death was in September and to encourage the ardour of the people of that part of the country towards football, the Blue Pilgrims decided to unfurl the tifo at Indira Gandhi Athletic Stadium, located in Guwahati, Northeast India. = Uniting Kolkata Derby fans = Mohammedan, Mohun Bagan, and East Bengal united as the \\"12th man\\" of the national team. For India's 2022 FIFA World Cup qualification home leg match against Bangladesh at Salt Lake Stadium in Kolkata on 15 October 2019, the coach and players of the national team expressed their desire to see a \\"full house\\" of fans, as often witnessed during Kolkata Derbies. The Blue Pilgrims decided to create a tifo depicting a united group of Mohammedan (in black and white), Mohan Bagan (in green and maroon), and East Bengal (in yellow and red) fans as the \\"12th man\\" for the national team. The creation of the tifo was a collaborative work among all groups of fans, as Mohun Bagan fans painted the East Bengal jersey and East Bengal fans painted the Mohun Bagan jersey; both sets painted the Mohammedan jersey. Funding for the creation of the tifo was raised through crowdfunding; the Blue Pilgrims exceeded their goal of Rs 60,000, raising a total of Rs. 87,507 from 274 donors. Approximately 54,000 fans attended the match where the tifo was displayed. The match ended in a draw between India and Bangladesh.

In 1985, he became the first person to climb all the Munros (mountains in Scotland over in height) during a single winter excursion. In 1993, he and his climbing partner became the first people to make a continuous traverse of all the Alpine 4,000-metre mountains in a single continuous trip, and without using any form of motorised transport. He created over a hundred new winter climbing routes in Scotland, and made a number of first ascents in the Himalayas. Moran died whilst leading a mountaineering expedition in India. Early life Born on 19 February 1955, Moran spent his childhood on Tyneside. There he met his future wife, Joy, when both were 18 years old. Moran studied geography at Cambridge University and subsequently qualified as a chartered accountant, basing himself in Sheffield. In 1985, Moran and his partner moved to Scotland and established a mountaineering instruction and guiding business, 'Moran Mountain' based in Lochcarron. For the next twenty years they ran summer alpine mountaineering courses, based out of Argenti√®re in France, and Evol√®ne in Switzerland. Their children, Hazel and Alex, subsequently assisted in running the guiding business. Achievements During the winter season of 1984/85, Moran became the first person to climb all the Scottish mountains listed as 'Munros' in one single trip during winter. The 277 peaks that were listed at the time are all over 3,000 feet in height, and were climbed over 83 days. He was supported along the route by his wife Joy. He subsequently published a book which described the undertaking. In 1985, Moran qualified as a professional mountain guide. In summer 1993, Moran and his climbing partner Simon Jenkins climbed all 75 summits of the Alps that were then listed as being over in height. They did this in one continuous journey, travelling on foot or by bicycle to get between mountain ranges, but without using any motorised transport. Again, Moran published a book recounting this challenging journey.There was no officially approved listing of summits at that time. The UIAA published an official list of 82 summits later that year. As a climber and runner, Moran made numerous traverses of the -long Cuillin Ridge on the Isle of Skye. This mountaineering undertaking normally takes a full day of climbing and scrambling but, in 1993, Moran set a new record of completing the traverse in 3 hours and 33 minutes. He is reported to have attempted this challenge around twenty times, failing it as many times as he succeeded. In 2010, Moran made the first British ascent of Vettisfossen, Norway‚Äôs highest waterfall. In March 2016, Moran made a full winter solo-traverse of the Cuillin ridge in under 24 hours. By 2016, Moran had made the first ascents of 14 summits within the Indian Himalayas, including the 1995 ascent of the south face of Nanda Kot () and the first ascent in 2000 of the west ridge of Nilkanth (). Moran also led mountaineering trips to Kamet and Trisul, and to summits in the Uttarakhand region. =Selected first ascents= Scotland As a winter climber, Moran has set up over a hundred new routes in Scotland. His 2002 route, The Godfather (Grade VIII, 8) on Beinn Bh√†n, is regarded as a \\"sought-after test-piece\\" and a \\"winter prize\\". *Sg√πrr B√†n, North-East Face: Scarred for Life 85m VIII,9 ***.

ISYS Outdoors (CDROM) Death In May 2019 Moran was guiding an expedition in India to climb Nanda Devi East (). Having trekked in to Nanda Devi East base camp on 18 May, they established a higher base camp at three days later. The party of twelve climbers then split; one group to fix ropes to the main route on Nanda Devi East, whilst Moran's party of eight attempted an acclimatisation climb and first ascent of an unnamed, subsidiary peak at . On 25 May, Moran confirmed that a camp had been established around and his party would set off for the summit the next morning. All contact was subsequently lost with Moran's group, and a search by the other party failed to find them, but noted evidence of a large avalanche on their route. The alarm was raised on 31 May. Seven bodies from the group of eight were subsequently recovered in June, but a further search was called off because of monsoon conditions. On 8 July, a GoPro camera, found close to where one of the bodies was retrieved, revealed some of the last movements of the party on 26 May as they traversed a delicate snow ridge, which is believed to have collapsed beneath them, triggering an avalanche which killed them. On the same day, British Mountain Guides Association announced that Martin Moran's body is still missing.

Though varsity sports were not formally organized until 1895, interscholastic athletics became a fixture at the school earlier in the 19th century.Leonhart (1939), p. 198 In the late-1890s, City competed in the Maryland Intercollegiate Football Association (MIFA), a nine-member league consisting of colleges in Washington, D.C. and Maryland.Kings of American Football: The University of Maryland, 1890‚Äì1952, p. 28, Columbia Publishing Co., 1952. City College was the lone secondary school among MIFA membership. The 1895 football schedule included St. John's College, Swarthmore College, the United States Naval Academy, University of Maryland, and Washington College.Leonhart (1939), p. 200. Between 1894 and 1920, City College regularly faced off against the Johns Hopkins Blue Jays and the Navy Midshipmen in lacrosse. Baltimore City College began competing against other secondary schools in 1919 when it was invited to join the Maryland Scholastic Association (MSA) as a founding member. After 75 years of governing Baltimore- metro area boys' high school athletics, the Maryland Scholastic Association dissolved in 1993 when its 15 public school members, including City College, withdrew from the league to join the Maryland Public Secondary Schools Athletic Association (MPSSAA). The Knights currently compete with other public secondary schools in the MPSSAA (Class 3A, North Region, District 9), more commonly referred to as the Baltimore City League (Division 1), but routinely schedule contests against area private schools in various sports. The current City College varsity athletic program consists of 18 sports: six for boys, eight for girls, and five coeducational teams. The boys' sports includes baseball, basketball, football, lacrosse, soccer, and wrestling. The girls' sports are badminton, basketball, lacrosse, field hockey, soccer, softball, and volleyball. The five co-ed sports are cross country, indoor track and field, swimming, outdoor track and field, and tennis. Girls' sports were added to City's athletic department in the fall of 1978 when the school became coeducational for the first time in its then-139-year-old history. The school's athletic teams are currently outfitted by Under Armour.  Championships  Baltimore City College's championship pedigree predates World War I. Since winning its first championships (baseball and ice hockey) in 1903, the Knights' athletic success has spanned every sport offered by the school.

One of the earliest recorded results in program history is a one-point overtime road loss to the University of Maryland Terrapins (then known as the Maryland Agricultural College Aggies) on January 25, 1913. The most successful head coach in school history was George Howard \\"Jerry\\" Phipps, who led the Knights to a record of 133‚Äì27, four Maryland Scholastic Association (MSA) championships, and a streak of forty straight games without a loss spanning two seasons between 1960‚Äì1968. In all, the school won twelve MSA A-Conference basketball championships (1922, 1923, 1934, 1935, 1938, 1939, 1940, 1961, 1963, 1965, 1966, 1967, 1969). Baltimore City College currently competes in District 9 (Baltimore City League) of the MPSSAA. Since 2007, City College has earned berths in every MPSSAA state tournament and has posted seven 20+ win seasons. The Knights have won three MPSSAA state championships (2009, 2010, and 2014), one of just five schools in Maryland that have won three or more boys' basketball state titles since 2000. City has advanced to the MPSSAA state tournament semifinals six times (1997, 1998, 1999, 2009, 2010, and 2014), third most all-time among Baltimore City League teams. The Knights won the Baltimore City League Division I championship in 2014 and also appeared in the district championship game in 2011. With a record of 27‚Äì0 in 2014, City College posted the third undefeated season in school history (1966, 1967) and became the first Baltimore City League team since 2008‚Äì2009 to finish the season without a loss. The Knights ended the 2014 season as the No. 18-ranked team in the country in the final USA Today Super 25 and Student Sports Fab 50 national boys' basketball polls, the team's highest national ranking since beginning the 2011‚Äì12 season as the No. 21-ranked team in the preseason USA Today national poll. Daryl Wade, who coached the Knights to the 2014 MPSSAA state championship, three additional MPSSAA state semifinal appearances, and a 30-game win streak between December 2013 and December 2014, was replaced as head coach in 2017. The current City College head coach is Omarr Smith, B.C.C. '98, a long-time Wade assistant.  Football  The Baltimore City College football program began in the mid-1870s, and has won more than 20 MSA A-Conference and MPSSAA championships in its history. The Knights primarily competed against are colleges and universities throughout the 1880s and 1890s because few secondary schools existed at the time. The program began competing against other high schools at the beginning of the 20th century, and has held since 1941 the record for the longest streak of games played without a loss in MSA and MPSSAA history. The Knights played 54 consecutive games without a loss between 1934‚Äì1941. Harry Lawrence, who guided the Knights to a 38-game undefeated streak between 1936 and 1940 (including 35 wins, three ties, and four MSA championships), remains City College's most successful head football coach. George Young became head football coach in 1959 and guided the Knights to six Maryland Scholastic Association A-Conference championships. Young left the program after the 1967 season to join the National Football League as an offensive line coach for the Baltimore Colts and would later become the general manager of the New York Giants. One of his star players was quarterback Kurt Schmoke, who later became States' Attorney for Baltimore City and served two terms as the Mayor of Baltimore, the first elected African-American mayor in the history of Baltimore City. George Petrides was named head football coach in 1975 and remained in the same position for 40 years. Petrides, a 1967 graduate of the school, retired in 2015 with a coaching record of 257‚Äì144‚Äì1 and as the second winningest active coach in Maryland high school football. During his tenure, City had a 29-game winning streak en route to two Maryland Scholastic Association A-Conference championships in 1991 and 1992. Coach Petrides guided City College to appearances in the semifinals of the MPSSAA state football playoffs in 1996, 2001, and 2005. The Knights finished the 1987 and 1992 seasons ranked in the top-20 nationally in the USA Today high school football poll. = City‚ÄìPoly rivalry (1889‚Äìpresent) = The City-Poly football rivalry is the oldest American football rivalry in Maryland, and one of the oldest public school football rivalries in the United States. The rivalry began in 1889, when City College met the Baltimore Polytechnic Institute (Poly) at Clifton Park for a football scrimmage in which City's freshman team beat Poly.Leonhart (1939), p. 219. City remained undefeated in the series until 1908.Leonhart (1939), p. 221. In the 1920s, the rivalry turned so fierce that riots erupted on the streets of downtown Baltimore on the day before \\"The Game\\" when opposing parades clashed resulting in the sons of both the Mayor of Baltimore and the Governor of Maryland were arrested in 1928. By the 1930s a \\"Peace Pact\\" was sworn annually and signed by student government leaders of both schools before the cameras of the press in the Mayor's Ceremonial Office in City Hall. Several student disturbances at games or on transit buses afterwards in the late-1960s and early-1970s threatened to put an end to the athletic tradition reflecting the tense tenor of the times, but goodwill eventually prevailed again by the quieter 1980s. By the 1950s, it had become a Baltimore tradition that after a morning of church services, parades and rallies, the two Catholic high school football powers of Loyola High School (Loyola Blakefield) and Calvert Hall College would play on Thanksgiving Day morning at 10 a.m., followed at 2 p.m. by City-Poly as the two public school rivals at Memorial Stadium on 33rd Street. That evening's TV news and sports casts led off with the scores and highlights of \\"The Game\\" and half-time shows and parades. Next day's The Sun and The News-Post and American had special sections and stories covering all facets of the day before. One of the most memorable City-Poly games occurred on Thanksgiving Day 1965, at Baltimore's Memorial Stadium, with some 25,000 fans in attendance. City beat Poly 52‚Äì6, and completed a 10‚Äì0 season with the team finishing the season ranked eighth in the nation by a national sports poll. City's 52‚Äì6 victory over Poly in that game is the largest margin of victory in the history of the series. Former Baltimore Mayor Kurt Schmoke was the quarterback and Maryland Delegate Curt Anderson was the captain. The game is no longer played on Thanksgiving or at Memorial Stadium, but is now located at the home of the Baltimore Ravens, M&T; Bank Stadium, at Camden Yards in downtown Baltimore. City College won the 127th meeting in 2015 by routing Poly by a final score of 42‚Äì6, the school's fourth consecutive victory in the series. Poly now leads the series 62‚Äì59‚Äì6.

Location Hienheim is located at an altitude of above sea level on the left bank of the Danube opposite the village of Eining, on the road connecting Neustadt to Essing in the Altm√ºhl valley. Regensburg is about to the east, Ingolstadt to the west. Munich is approximately south. History Foundation of a Roman limes watchtower on the Hienheim Woods Excavations by Leiden University revealed that there was a Neolithic settlement, dating from around 5000 BC, in the area of Hienheim. The place is referred to in several sources as early as 1097/98 as \\"Hohenheim\\" (\\"village on the hill\\"). The Roman limes, the border fortification against the Germanic tribes, began near Hienheim. The long Rhaetian Limes, from Hienheim to Lorch, consisted primarily of stone walls up to three meters (ten feet) high and wooden watchtowers, while the Upper Germanic Limes (running from Lorch northwest to Bonn) was mostly composed of earthen ramparts, trenches and palisades. While the construction of Roman Limes fortifications was already begun in 1 AD, the Germanic Limes dates from 84 AD. From the year 260 AD, the Limes had to gradually be abandoned because of Alemannic raids. The beginning of the border wall is marked by the so-called \\"Hadrian's Column\\" (Hadrians√§ule), a monument erected in 1856 on the road to Kelheim. The heyday of the limes occurred under the Emperors Trajan and Hadrian, 98 to 138 AD. The Upper Germanic-Rhaetian Limes has been declared an historic monument, and since 2005 a World Heritage Site by UNESCO. In 1979, the small , part of the fortifications, was discovered by aerial archaeology. Nearby is a monument of a very different kind, the 17th‚Äì18th century \\"Iron Hand\\" (Eiserne Hand). According to legend, a seamstress on her way to work regularly met a wolf for whom she always brought a piece of bread. One time she had no bread, and the wolf was said to have mangled and devoured her, all except for her right hand, which had always fed him. The previously independent municipality of Hienheim was dissolved on 1 January 1978. The larger portion was assigned to the city of Neustadt; a smaller part with fewer than 25 inhabitants went to Kelheim. Infrastructure Hienheim is an elongated village with approximately 700 inhabitants and a predominantly rural character. Some craft shops have located here or carry on the traditions. There is also a sports field for the local football club. Beyond the borders of Hienheim is a sail plane facility near the village, which attracts aviation fans from all over Germany in summer. A ferry across the Danube connects Hienheim with Eining. On May 4, 2006 this ferry sank; However, the four people on board were rescued without major injuries. The German Limes Cycle Route leads through the village. This follows the Upper Germanic-Rhaetian Limes over from Bad H√∂nningen on the Rhine to Regensburg on the Danube. The German Limes Road (Deutsche Limes-Stra√üe) runs through the town, and the Limeswanderweg (Limeswanderweg) also leads through Hienheim. Churches Hienheim's Catholic Church of St. George has a Romanesque choir tower, probably dating from the 12th century. In the 16th and again in the 19th centuries, the church was further expanded, provided with a cemetery wall, and last restored in 1985. North of the church is the Sebastianskapelle, originally Late Gothic but later structurally altered into the Baroque style.

Career  Lage started his musical career in the 90's with the band Arkaes as lead singer and guitarist. Later, he was recruited as a singer for the band Paco Jones with which he recorded the album \\"Invisible\\" in 1999. In early 2002 he became the lead vocalist of Avalanch, having already worked with them in the past as a roadie and background vocalist. Ram√≥n showed an interest in singing from a very early age, but professionally started when he joined Avalanch, which led him to perform multiple tours in Spain and all around the world. In parallel, Lage also lent his voice to the bands Stunned Parrots and Geysser, working in both side projects alongside former bandmate Alberto Rionda. His voice has often been described as greatly versatile, easily able to switch \\"from an aggressive sound to some very calm and very pleasant singing\\" In 2006, he was the first vocalist ever to receive one of the official Asturian Music Awards, by winning in the category of Best Singer in the first edition of the AMAS Awards. In 2011, he worked as a vocal coach at Derrame Rock School in Oviedo, Asturias. Avalanch entered an indefinite hiatus on 2012 after performing two farewell shows in Mexico supporting Scorpions. On February 2013, he was announced as the new vocalist and guitarist for Human, an Asturian thrash metal band he had previously collaborated with. The following years the band went through some line up changes, and then focused on working on their third studio album; the first one with Lage as a frontman and songwriter. After a long silence, in 2016 Human announced the return of their original line up for a farewell tour in Asturias and then disbanded. On December 2016, Avalanch's leader Alberto Rionda unilaterally announced a comeback with a completely new line up. Shortly after, in February 2017, all the rest of musicians from the previous line up, including Lage, signed an official statement confirming they had not taken part in any decision regarding the band's return.

The major consideration in on women and their low turnouts in most sporting events. This write-up tends to address the issue.  Representation in Sports Leadership  Despite an increase in the number of women involved in sports in recent times, there remains low representation of women in sports executive bodies and inadequate policies meant to increase equal participation. The Equal Pay Act of 1963 passed by the United States Congress was an effort to bridge the gender pay gap, though the use the 'same establishment' clause failed to separate different ownership of male and female teams. This made its effort to balance pay ineffective. The 2010 World Cup in South Africa was a major sporting event that was mainly organized and managed by men. The women involved in organizing the 2010 World Cup were not recognized by the media and predominately participated as assistants and receptionists. The United Nations found that gender discrimination is still inherent in sports, as only 23 percent of women were represented in leadership positions in 2007. Some success of the efforts to bridge gender inequality in representation can be traced to Norway and Germany which produced the first female representative in international football organisations. Norway had an equal status council which put a committee in place to encourage more women to take part in the management structure of sports organisations. The committee had a goal of equal men and women participation in sports organisations in the nearest future. The election of Nsekera Lydia from Burundi into the executive committee of FIFA is a major success in respect to equal Gender participation in sports leadership. The International Olympic Committee also recognizes the importance of establishing gender equality in sports, both through athletic participation and leadership roles, and created the International Olympic Committee Gender Equality Review Project in March 2018. The project includes 25 solution-based approaches and resulted from the Olympic Agenda 2020‚Äôs goal to improve gender equality in sports.

Yang was quoted at the time as saying: \\"As the nation's first female general, I will do my best for the military and the country. I hope this promotion will encourage other female officers\\" The press coverage around Yang's appointment has been used as an example of gendered news reporting: South Korean press reports complimented Yang on her skill at making kimchi soup and in applying her make-up, rather than any military expertise. Yang retired from the military in 2004.

She first served as a heavy sailing frigate. Next she was rebuilt as a steam frigate, but she was never finished as such. She was finally rebuilt and served as a Casemate ironclad comparable to the CSS Virginia. Context On 1 June 1842 J.C. Rijk became head (Dutch: Directeur-generaal) of the Dutch navy. On 18 June 1843 he became Secretary for the Navy. At the time the navy had been severely neglected because of the secession of Belgium and the war and tensions that followed. Under Rijk the navy would have to economize, to become smaller, and to modernize. Rijk wrote about his policy early in a letter that was approved by the king on 25 January 1843, and known as 'Plan Rijk' (Dutch: Stelsel Rijk). The Plan Rijk called for 2 ships of the line 84 guns and 4 ships of the line of 74 all of them existing or under construction. Rijk noted that he did not want to build more ships of the line, but also did not want to razee the existing ones for the moment. The number of heavy frigates should be raised to 4. One of these was already in service, two were already in the water, and the fourth should be found by razeeing either the existing small ship of the line Kortenaar, or the small ship of the line De Ruyter, still under construction in Vlissingen. Rijk also observed that the caliber of the guns on a ship seemed to become more important than the number of guns on a ship. This is in line with his proposition to razee a ship instead of building another heavy frigate according to the existing models. By the time that the De Ruyter was finally launched screw propulsion had made sail-only frigates obsolete. In the late 1850s a reconstruction along the lines of the HNLMS Wassenaar (1856) fit the new Dutch naval system (Plan 1855) calling for a fleet of steam frigates of 400 hp, steam corvettes of 250 hp, and steam sloops of 100 hp. Characteristics =Design= Model of the De Ruyter as a small ship of the line of 74 guns in 1831 Model of the De Ruyter as a razeed frigate first class of 51 guns in 1843 The initial design of the Ruyter was that of a small ship of the line. A so-called ship of the line of the second class of 74 guns. She was laid down in 1831. Other small ships of the line laid down at about the same time were the Wassenaar (1833), and the Tromp (1830). These might all have been of the same class. While still under construction the De Ruyter and the Wassenaar were razeed, or redesigned as heavy frigates, known in the Dutch navy as 'frigates 1st class'. This might have been done according to the same plan, implying that for some time there was a 'De Ruyter class' of razees comprising the De Ruyter and the Wassenaar. The fact that in 1851 the De Ruyter was finished 30% and the Wassenaar was 35% ready, gives credence to this theory. The De Ruyter was not similar to the frigates first class laid down at about the same time which had been designed as such from the start. These were the Prins van Oranje (ex-Waal) and Doggersbank. These had about the same beam as the De Ruyter and Wassenaar, but they were balanced designs. The Doggersbank was designed for 30 medium 30-pounders and 30 30-pounder carronades, that is two batteries in a neat lay-out. The De Ruyter had the main battery of a ship of the line. =Machinery= As a sail only frigate the De Ruyter of course did not have engines. In her planned and almost completed conversion to a frigate with auxiliary power, she got a 400 hp steam engine. = Sails = =Armament= The De Ruyter and Wassenaar were planned to mount 54 guns. On the De Ruyter the main battery was that of a ship of the line, i.e. 36-pounders. The Wassenaar would mount the 30-pounder long No 4. Both guns were comparable to the heaviest guns that foreign ships of the line traditionally mounted. In 1853 there was a general order for the armament of ships. The Razee De Ruyter would mount: 22 long 36-pounders and 8 20 cm grenade guns No 1. On the upper deck she would have 22 medium 30-pounders No 3, and 1 long 60-pounder. Note that the 36-pounder was the same gun traditionally found on the lower decks of French ships of the line. = Criticism = The decision first to convert De Ruyter to use auxiliary steam power, and then to cease the conversion following the expenditure of around eight hundred thousand guilders, attracted criticism. She was next converted to a casemate ironclad, another expensive process which failed to render a ship comparable to the modern ships in foreign service. Between them, these two conversion projects amounted to a great deal of expenditure on a single ship with limited results.  Construction and Commissioning = Construction of the De Ruyter = The De Ruyter was laid down as a ship of the line in Vlissingen in 1831. On 5 August 1853 she was launched as a heavy sailing frigate. On 2 August 1854 captain F.X.R. 't Hooft was known to become her first commander. = Commissioning = The De Ruyter was commissioned on 21 August 1854 On 27 August 1854 it became known that De Ruyter would bring the new Naval commander of the East Indies to his post. This would be Rear Admiral J.F.D. Bouricius. Bouricius and other passengers would stay in the captain's quarters, and therefore new cabins were added on the upper deck. A hundred extra sailors would also take the De Ruyter to go to the East Indies. On 11 September the paddle steamer Cycloop brought sailors from Nieuwediep/Willemsoord. By mid September a marine from Nieuwediep brought Cholera on board. Of 26 patients, four had died by 19 September. One of the measures that was taken was to disembark half of the crew, which had grown to 531 men.  Service  Jan Frederik Dani√´l Bouricius (1799-1859) = First voyage to the Dutch East Indies = On 21 October 1854 the De Ruyter left the dock of Vlissingen and anchored in the harbor (roadstead) of Vlissingen. On 24 October the Secretary for the Navy arrived in Vlissingen. On the 25th the Cycloop arrived with 60 more sailors. On the 26th the secretary christened the Evertsen, that had been laid down on the 25th, but he did not inspect the De Ruyter or the Doggersbank. On 9 November the commander of the naval base Vlissingen inspected the frigate. On 10 November Rear Admiral J.F.D. Bouricius, his daughter and ADC arrived at Hotel Wellington. On 15 November a first attempt to sail was discontinued because of fog. On 16 November at 8 in the morning the De Ruyter set sail with a powerful South East wind. The crew consisted of 650 men of whom 56 officers. On 27 November 1854 the De Ruyter was seen on 23.4 N 22.3 W. On 9 December she was hailed on 9.33 N 24.22 W. On 19 January 1855 she anchored in Table Bay from whence she left on 29 January. After colliding with a Danish barque during a dark night in Sunda Strait she anchored at Batavia on 21 March 1855. On 28 March Bouricius took over command of the navy in the Dutch East Indies. His predecessor VA E.G. van der Plaat and wife would return home with the De Ruyter together with many other officers and sailors. On 22 April 1855 the De Ruyter left Batavia again for the Netherlands. On 18 June she arrived in Saint Helena, from whence she left on the 24th. On 5 August she arrived before Nieuwediep. She entered the harbor on 22 August = First cruise to the Mediterranean = In October 1855 captain Stavenisse de Braauw was known to become the next commander of the De Ruyter. Her next trip would go to the Mediterranean. In November the day of departure for her and the brig Zeehond was set on the 15th. On 28 November the De Ruyter and the Zeehond finally left Texel for the Mediterranean. On 30 December both arrived in La Spezia. On 16 February 1856 the De Ruyter arrived in Alexandria. On 8 March she was in Malta. While dressing for a ball on the evening of the 10th, Stavenisse de Braauw got a stroke. The De Ruyter nevertheless arrived in Genoa on 13 March. Captain H.J. van Maldeghem travelled to Toulon to take over command on the arrival of the De Ruyter in that place. On 10 May or shortly before the De Ruyter arrived in Toulon. The De Ruyter was expected to sail from Toulon to the Netherlands on 18 May. On 7 June she left Malaga. On 13 June she was hailed near Lisbon. On 1 July she was sighted near Lizard Point, Cornwall. On 7 July the De Ruyter anchored before Nieuwediep. On 1 August many spectators came to hear the music of the De Ruyter while it prepared to leave the harbor of Nieuwediep. She was tugged out by a private tugboat and then left Nieuwediep for a six-week cruise on the North Sea. She first sailed to Cherbourg, and on 15 August she arrived in Spithead. On 17 August she was near Dungeness (headland). On 30 August the De Ruyter was back in Texel, and in the afternoon she was tugged in. On 3 September she would be brought into the harbor. = Second cruise to the Mediterranean = In mid-October there were plans for the De Ruyter to make a second cruise in the Mediterranean starting 1 November. On 5 November she indeed sailed from Texel, and on 6 November she passed Dungeness. On 26 November she arrived in Malta. On 20 December 1856 she arrived in Smyrna. On 4 January 1857 the commander of the De Ruyter sent a report about shipping in the Levant to The Hague. On 9 January she left for Scala Virulate and Athens. She was expected to leave Athens for Malta on 23 February. On 8 March the frigate Doggersbank was waiting in Mahon. The plan was that it would transfer part of its crew and supplies to the De Ruyter before returning home. By 5 April this had been done, and the Doggersbank would return home on the 6th. On 1 May the De Ruyter arrived in Toulon. On 19 May she arrived in Marseille, towed in by the Bulldog. On 26 May she sailed for Tripoli. On 2 June the De Ruyter arrived in Tripoli, the first Dutch warship to do so in 20 years. She had on board the Dutch consul Ridder de Testa (probably Jhr. mr. Emilius Franciscus Eliodorus Testa (1821-1896)) and his family, who had been on leave in the Netherlands. On 3 June the officers and cadets went on shore, and the consul introduced them to the Pasha and the consuls of other powers. Local authorities then made a counter visit to the Dutch consulate. On the 4th there was a dinner and music at the consulate. In the evening of the 5th the De Ruyter left Tripoli. On 20 June the De Ruyter arrived back in Toulon from Tripoli. = Squadron in the Mediterranean = One of the ambitions of the Dutch navy was to train maneuvers with a squadron. The Mediterranean was the preferred location for these maneuvers, because it was better for the health of the sailors. On 18 July the De Ruyter arrived in Lisbon, where she would wait for the steam corvette Groningen, which had the Prince of Orange on board. After the Groningen had arrived, the new frigate with auxiliary power Wassenaar arrived on 15 August. Next there were a lot of reciprocal visits, and an inspection of the Wassenaar and De Ruyter. On 30 August the brig Zeehond brought some cadets to the frigates. On 27 September the De Ruyter arrived in Madeira. Plans were that she would continue to Tenerife. She indeed visited the Canary Islands and on 6 November she arrived in Cadiz. On 20 December she left Cadiz for Mahon. Contrary winds made that the Wassenaar anchored in Cagliari on 26 January, instead of reaching Mahon. The planned rendez-vous in Mahon with Wassenaar therefore failed. On 20 February the De Ruyter finally arrived in Mahon. On 4 April 1858 the De Ruyter was near Dungeness, having a pilot for Vlissingen on board. On 9 April she anchored in The Downs (ship anchorage). On 11 she continued her journey. On 15 April she anchored in Vlissingen. On 18 April she was brought into the harbor. = Second voyage to the Dutch East Indies = In 1 May 1858 Captain J.C. du Cloux became the new commander of the De Ruyter. Meanwhile, the ship was hastily prepared for a trip to the East Indies. In early June 150 soldiers were ordered to go to Vlissingen and to embark on the De Ruyter. On 10 June 120 barrels of silver coins worth 1,200,000 guilders arrived to be transported to the Indies. She was planned to sail on the 20th. On 25 June Prince Lobanoff, ADC of Grand Duke Konstantin Nikolayevich of Russia, who was modernizing the Russian fleet. visited the De Ruyter and dined on board the Evertsen. On 30 June the De Ruyter was still at anchor waiting for a favorable wind. She finally sailed for Batavia on 9 July. On 10 July she passed Dover. On 10 October she anchored in Simonsbaai, from whence she continued on 1 November. On 21 December she arrived in Batavia. Apart from bringing the money and 150 soldiers, the De Ruyter also exchanged most of her 350 men crew for sailors that had been waiting to return home. On 23 January 1859 the De Ruyter left Batavia again for the Netherlands. She had VA Bouricius on board, who passed away during the trip on 4 May. During the trip she was commanded by Captain-lt G. Fabius (son in law to Bouricius). On 20 May the De Ruyter anchored before the Schelde. On 1 June she was towed into the harbor, effectively ending her career as a sailing ship.  Conversion to frigate with auxiliary steam power  = Context = Already in September 1858 there was talk that the De Ruyter would be converted to steam in Hellevoetsluis as soon as she returned from the East Indies. In the budget for 1859 there was indeed a sentence about changing the De Ruyter in a frigate with 400 hp and 45 guns. The logic is obvious. From August 1857 the Dutch had gained experience with their first frigate with auxiliary power. This was the Wassenaar, she was a successful ship, and a near sister to the De Ruyter. This was all the more reason to suppose that a like reconstruction of the De Ruyter would be just as successful. = Work = The De Ruyter would be decommissioned on 15 June 1859. On 1 June she had been brought into the dock, where she would be stripped of masts, spars and rigging. She would then be towed to Hellevoetsluis, where she would be converted to possess auxiliary steam power. The whole bow and stern of the ship would need to be removed, and the ship lengthened by 25 feet. On 17 August the De Ruyter arrived in Hellevoetsluis towed by the Cycloop. When the bow and the stern of the De Ruyter were removed in Hellevoetsluis, not a single piece of rotten wood was found, something ascribed to the good quality of the wood and to the long original construction time (laid down in 1831). On 18 September 1861 the De Ruyter was launched for the second time when the dry dock of Hellevoetsluis was filled with water. She left the dry dock and work continued in Hellevoetsluis. In early October she was towed to Vlissingen by the Cycloop. On 7 October they were in Brouwershaven, and on 8 October before Vlissingen. On 9 October she was towed into the dock. That same month it became known that converting the De Ruyter was to cost almost one million guilders, or about seventy-five percent of the cost of building a new frigate.  The End  = Battle of Hampton Roads = On 8 March 1862 the Battle of Hampton Roads proved that an unarmored frigate did not stand a chance against any armored ship. This was even more the case for frigates like the De Ruyter, who had only auxiliary power, and therefore could not run away. = Decision to stop the conversion to steam frigate = On 9 April a commission was appointed to give an advice about what to do with regard to armoring ships. She advised that none of the existing ships could be made into a seaworthy armored ship. A handful of ships could be transformed for a coastal defense role, among them the De Ruyter. In March 1862 the De Ruyter was still 200,000 guilders away from getting completed. On the other hand, her transformation to a casemate ironclad would cost 298,000 guilders for the armor plate alone. It was a difficult decision, further complicated by the fact that the Dutch already had other frigates with auxiliary power, by what the national industry could do, and by the wish to have an ironclad as soon as possible. By August 1862 the Rijkswerf Vlissingen was busy removing the upper deck and some of the gun ports. = The casemate ironclad De Ruyter = The De Ruyter would later be commissioned as a casemate ironclad. Because almost everything except the lower hull was stripped and replaced, it might be best to cover this in a separate article about the Ironclad De Ruyter.

Synopsis  Xue Wenxi comes from a poor family, and disguises as a guy to make ends meet by helping to transcript and copywrite books. She meets Feng Chengjun, the son of the Prime Minister, during a business transaction. Coming to admire her talent, Feng Chengjun secretly sets a plan in motion that leaves her with no choice but to enroll in the Yun Shang Academy. As the school only accepts male students, Xue Wenxi disguises herself as a boy (using her brother's name Wenbin), and lives everyday on thin ice to guard her secret. Fortunately, she has Feng Chengjun to come to her aid, allowing her to focus on her studies. Using her wit, kindness and charm, she also become close friends with the rebellious and unrestrained Yu Lexuan and the cold and aloof Lei Zexin. The four become known as the \\"Yun Shang Quartet\\".

Biography Emery grew up in Texas and studied engineering at North Texas Agricultural College. He then studied geology at the University of Illinois, where he received in 1935 a B.S. and in 1939 an M.S. In 1937 he and another graduate student, Robert S. Dietz, moved with their mentor Francis Parker Shepard from the University of Illinois to the Scripps Institution of Oceanography in La Jolla, California. There Emery pursued doctoral research on the California continental margin. He received in 1941 his Ph.D. in geology from the University of Illinois. During WW II, he worked in San Diego and produced maps for the U.S. Navy of sediment types from oceanographic surveys. The maps were important for acoustic submarine warfare and scientific understanding of continental margins. At the end of WW II he moved to Los Angeles and joined the faculty of the University of Southern California (USC) as an assistant professor and was later promoted to full professor. For the academic year 1958‚Äì1959 he was on a leave of absence as a Guggenheim Fellow. His 1960 book, The Sea Off Southern California, A Modern Habitat of Petroleum is considered a classic. In 1962 he left USC and joined the marine geology group of Woods Hole Oceanographic Institution (WHOI). At WHOI he was a senior scientist from 1963 to 1975, the acting dean of the joint WHOI/MIT graduate program in 1968, and the Henry Bryant Bigelow Oceanographer from 1975 to 1979, retiring as scientist emeritus in 1979. He was the author or co-author of about 360 scientific publications, including 15 books. Emery and his wife lived for many years at the head of Oyster Pond in Chatham, Massachusetts. At his home there he maintained an orchard and apiary and produced his classic 1969 monograph A Coastal Pond Studied by Oceanographic Methods. He is the namesake of the \\"Emery rod method\\" used in studies of the dynamics of sand dunes and coastal beaches. His marriage of 42 years ended with the death of his wife in 1983. Upon his death he was survived by two daughters and a granddaughter. Awards and honors * 1958 ‚Äî Guggenheim Fellow * 1968 ‚Äî Foreign member of Academia Sinica * 1969 ‚Äî Francis P.

The track, which was written by the duo and produced by Sabath, was released on September 27, 2019, as the second single from the album. Backed by panoramic piano and ostentatious background vocals, the electropop and house song lyrically tells the story of the emotional fallout of a failed relationship. The song received mixed reviews from critics, with some of them praising the lyrics as mature and anthemic, while others were critical of its production. Commercially, it charted at number 35 on the New Zealand Hot Singles chart. Mathew Cullen directed the music video for \\"Wave\\", which features an earthy color palette and Trainor dancing atop a group of people that rock around her like waves. Trainor has performed the song on The Ellen DeGeneres Show and The Voice. Background and release Meghan Trainor delayed her August 2018-scheduled third major-label studio album, Treat Myself, to January 25, 2019, because she wanted to add more songs to it, and removed it from iTunes that month. Trainor had written \\"Wave\\" in 2016, and held onto it until 2019. She approached Mike Sabath to produce the song. As the two became close while working on it in the studio, Trainor asked him to record a verse for the song. Sabath stated that he was \\"super inspired\\" by her voice and the energy of the people in the studio, and finished his verse in one take and filled in the lyrics, concluding the recording of the song on March 5, 2019. Sabath went on to produce five of the fifteen tracks from the album, co-writing four of them. About the inspiration for \\"Wave\\", Trainor said that \\"there was this guy that was -- this poor dude, I'm probably talkin' 'bout him everywhere. But he was like, 'We can't ever be together 'cause it won't last!' But he'd be like, 'I love you' and I was like 'Ok, why are you calling then? Like why is this a thing?' So I don't know how to express myself with words, so I wrote this song and I sent it to him\\". She has stated that she has \\"never worked harder on a song\\" and that Sabath took it to a whole new level. Trainor announced the release date along with the single artwork for \\"Wave\\" on September 25, 2019. The song was digitally released two days later, as the second single from Treat Myself. On October 7, 2019, a solo version of it was serviced to hot adult contemporary radio stations in the United States. A Remix EP to promote \\"Wave\\" was released on November 22, 2019, featuring remixes of the song by R3hab, Justin Caruso and Arkadi. Composition An electropop and house song, According to Dani Blum of Pitchfork, \\"Wave\\" begins with Trainor delivering \\"titanic vocals over a panoramic piano\\" instrumentation, which transitions into an electronic dance music pulse that was compared to the work of Cascada. The song features \\"ostentatious\\" background vocals with gospel-inflected harmonies that she stated were inspired by her visits to Kanye West's Sunday Service Choir shows. Described as a \\"frothy electro-bop\\", its lyrics detail the highs and lows of a dramatic love story. \\"Wave\\" talks about the emotional fallout of a relationship that has failed, with lyrics like \\"And I shouldn't beg for more/But I don't want it to end\\". It has been called a drastic departure from Trainor's traditional doo-wop sound by PopMatters Jessica Brant. Critical reception The song received mixed reviews from music critics. Idolator's Mike Nied wrote that \\"Wave\\" finds \\"the duo [riding] the waves of their love story\\", adding that \\"the end result feels more mature and graceful than some of Meghan's more saccharine bops\\" and that he loved the creative direction. Nied stated that it may very well be Trainor's best song yet, and is the \\"sort of mature anthem that could very easily take her career to another level\\". Heran Mamo of Billboard opined that \\"the backing choir adds an ethereal layer over the electronic impressions\\" on \\"Wave\\", and that \\"the chorus is a powerfully sweeping recital that emphasizes just how overwhelming her desire to get this love back is\\". Writing for Entertainment Tonight Canada, Corey Atad described it as \\"anthemic and danceable\\". In a negative review, Hannah Mylrea of NME stated that the song \\"starts slow before erupting into a tacky house mess that would sound at home soundtracking Love Island. Pitchforks Dani Blum called it \\"a Cascada remix for a middle school dance in a sweaty gym\\". Promotion =Music video= Directed by Mathew Cullen and choreographed by Charm La'Donna, the music video for \\"Wave\\" was released on October 7, 2019. It features an earthy color palette and depicts Trainor in an abstract dance party where she glides above the hands of several people. Trainor, who is dressed in a nude-colored leotard, dances atop a group of people that rock back and forth. They catch and release her body in rhythm with quivering synths, so as to simulate a human wave. The dancers are dressed in neutral tones and form a giant pyramid shape. The dancers crash like waves around Trainor, as if she were a rock in the water. Sabath joins in later, donning a leopard print headband. The music video received positive reviews from critics. Rolling Stones Claire Shaffer wrote that the abstract dance party in the video \\"transform[s] into an almost spiritual experience for Trainor\\". Writing for MTV News, Madeline Roth described the choreography as \\"pristine\\", adding that the singer looked \\"absolutely ethereal in a tulle gown\\". Jessica Brant of PopMatters was positive of the video, stating that the dance moves were executed with \\"short, military precision\\" and elaborated that the visuals see Trainor \\"evocatively stage a physical representation of the enduring power of a shipwrecked romance shared between two partners\\". =Live performances= Trainor and Sabath performed \\"Wave\\" for the first time, on The Ellen DeGeneres Show, on November 6, 2019. They also performed the song at The Voice on December 3, 2019. Trainor performed a stripped-back version of it during her Billboard Live At-Home concert on April 10, 2020, which aimed to raise money for Feeding America.

Warren (September 17, 1962 ‚Äì July 30, 2005) was an assistant professor of biochemistry and molecular biology at the University of New Hampshire. Early life and education Warren was born on September 17, 1962, in Guildford, UK. He was son of Joan (Staples) Warren and the late Charles Peter Warren. He was educated at Oxford University, where he received his PhD in 1989 under the tutelage of Raymond Dwek, an eminent early leader in glycobiology. His thesis was entitled Glycosylation in Mice and Rats. Research After graduation he helped establish the first commercially focused effort in glycotechnology: Oxford Glycosystems, Ltd. He subsequently moved to Toronto, Canada, to broaden his interest in glycosyltransferase and spent his postdoctoral time with Dr. Harry Schachter at the Hospital for Sick Children in Toronto, and two years later across the street with Dr. Jim Dennis at the Lunenfeld-Tanenbaum Research Institute. Charles Warren moved to the University of New Hampshire in 2002 as an assistant professor in the Department of Biochemistry and Molecular Biology. He conducted research on the structure-function relationships of glycosylation. These specific efforts focused on evolution, animal development and human diseases. He used C. elegans as his model organism. Awards After only three years at the University of New Hampshire, he was nominated for a named professorship, the Class of 1944 Award. This university-wide award recognizes outstanding faculty members. Death Charles Warren died prematurely on July 30, 2005, in a paragliding accident. Warren Workshops Since 2006, Warren Workshops are held every second years in Warren's memory. The initial purpose of the Warren Workshop series on Glycoconjugate Analysis was to bring together concerned analysts in the field to discuss the various methodologies in use with the aim to share and appraise protocols for carbohydrate sequencing. Discussion among the experts in the discipline would hopefully lead to establishing a working framework and course of action to bring unanimity to the goals and requirements of glycoconjugate structural analysis. The growing need, aspirations of automation and high throughput analysis, made open discussion among experts very timely and important.

Her research career has focused on identifying and preventing harms to children from prenatal and early childhood exposures to environmental chemicals and pollutants. She is internationally recognized for pioneering the field of molecular epidemiology, an approach that incorporates molecular techniques into epidemiological studies to measure biologic dose, preclinical responses and susceptibility to toxic exposures.  Biography  Born in Boston, Massachusetts, Perera received her bachelor's degree in Liberal Arts from Harvard University/Radcliffe College in 1963. She received her DrPH in Environmental Health Sciences from Columbia University in 1976 and a PhD in Environmental and Social Policy from Columbia University in 1981. In 1982, Perera joined the faculty of Columbia University Mailman School of Public Health in the Department of Environmental Health Sciences. In 1998, she founded the Columbia Center for Children's Environmental Health to conduct community-based research on environmental risks to childhood's health. = Research = Since the late 1980s, Perera has led studies applying molecular and imaging techniques within longitudinal cohort studies of pregnant women and their children in the U.S., Poland, and China, with the goal of identifying preventable environmental risk factors for developmental disorders, asthma, obesity, and cancer in childhood. These exposures include toxic chemicals, pesticides, and air pollution, with particular focus on the adverse effects of prenatal and early childhood exposures. This research has revealed that the prenatal period of development is especially vulnerable to toxic environmental exposures and that prenatal exposures such as air pollutants, chemicals in plastics, pesticides and flame retardants are linked to neurodevelopmental problems, obesity and/or asthma in childhood. The research also found that stress and maternal hardship can increase the harm from chemical exposures. The research has demonstrated the benefits of policies and other interventions to reduce or eliminate such exposures. In 1982, Perera co-authored a seminal paper that defined the nascent field of molecular epidemiology, which uses biomarkers such as DNA adducts to understand the links between environmental exposures and disease with the goal of prevention‚Äîan approach she uses in her own research. Perera was also among the first to report evidence that prenatal exposures to environmental toxicants result in adverse health outcomes in childhood and adolescence. Perera has written extensively on the multiple threats to children's health and future well-being from fossil fuel combustion emissions, both from climate change and toxic air pollution, and the benefits of government action on health, the economy, and equity. Research findings by Perera and colleagues have been used to support, pass, and enforce laws that protect environmental and public health. Through a longstanding partnership with WE ACT for Environmental Justice, the Center's findings have been used to influence policy in the areas of air pollution, asthma initiatives, secondhand smoke, residential pesticides, and chemical reform. Perera has received numerous honors, including the 20th Annual Heinz Award in the Environment for her lifetime achievement in research for the protection of children's health.

It was discovered by John Herschel on November 28, 1837. It is moving away from the Milky Way 1341 km/s.  Distance and size  At a distance of nearly 63 million light-years, it is a member of Fornax Cluster. Its size on night sky is 1.4' x 1.0' which is proportional to its real size of 30,000 light-years, which makes it one of the smaller galaxies in Fornax Cluster.  Characteristics  NGC 1460 has a Hubble classification of SB0, which indicates it is a barred lenticular galaxy. But, this one contains a huge bar at its core. The bar is spreading from center to the edge of the galaxy, as seen on Hubble image in the box. This bar is one of the largest seen in barred lenticular galaxies. NGC 1460 is also an early-type galaxy. Despite their name, early-type galaxies are much older than spiral galaxies, and mostly comprise old, red-colored stars. Very little star formation occurs in these galaxies; the lack of star formation in elliptical galaxies appears to start at the center and then slowly propagates outward. This galaxy is early-type lenticular, but lenticular galaxies have as same process as elliptical galaxies.

History  The Democratic Conservative Party emerged in the context of the Syrian Civil War. In course of this conflict, the Syrian government lost control of the country's northeast, where the mostly Kurdish Democratic Union Party (PYD) assumed power. It founded an unrecognized proto-state, widely known as \\"Rojava\\", with its own constitution, government, and military. In order to safeguard and expand this proto-state and gain recognition and acceptance among the region's population of Kurds, Arabs, and other ethnic as well as religious groups, the PYD forged alliances with other regional actors. One of the PYD's most important allies was the Syrian branch of the Shammar tribe, led by Humaydi Daham al-Hadi. He organized a tribal militia, known as Army of Dignity and later al-Sanadid Forces, to fight alongside the PYD's armed wings (YPG/YPJ) against other militant groups during the civil war. In August 2017, Humaydi Daham al-Hadi met at Qamishli with representatives of several Arab tribes that lived in Rojava's Jazira Region. Anticipating the upcoming regional elections, the tribal representatives agreed to organize a party which they dubbed the \\"Democratic Conservative Party\\" with the motto \\"Syria is a homeland for all Syrians.\\" Humaydi Daham al-Hadi was chosen as secretary general, and Akram Mahshoush, a Jubur tribal leader, was appointed deputy secretary general. The party participated in the regional elections of December 2017 as part of the PYD-led Democratic Nation List. Since then, the party established a presence throughout the Jazira Region, such as at al-Qahtaniyah, but also in other areas including Raqqa. The party sent representatives to the \\"Meeting and Progress\\" Dialogue in late 2018, and the 2nd Middle East Youth Conference at Koban√Æ on 20 February 2019. It has repeatedly voiced support for talks between the northeastern administration under the PYD and the Syrian government, and has condemned the Turkish occupation of northern Syria. In March 2020, the Democratic Conservative Party was one of 31 parties which signed a statement rebuffing President Bashar al-Assad's claim that the ruling elements in northeastern Syria did not represent the area's majority.

She wrote for over twenty years itemizing the dangers of chemical substances on the human body. She campaigned against the use of poison gas in warfare.  Early life  Woker was born on 16 December 1878 to \\"Old Catholic\\" theology and history professor Philipp Woker. She came from a well-educated family as besides her father being a professor, her maternal grandfather taught history. Woker was keen to continue her studies but her father sent her to Erfurt to learn to cook. Undeterred, Woker studied mathematics secretly at night with the brother of a fellow student. Leading a double life proved to be an exhausting and Woker fell ill with chlorosis, a form of anaemia.  Education and career  Woker went on to obtain her PhD and school teaching qualification in chemistry, physics and botany from the University of Berne. Upon her graduation in 1903, she was the first Swiss woman to earn a PhD at the University of Berne. Upon her return to Bern, Woker was unable to find a position in her field and became a high school gymnastics teacher. This was short-lived, however, as she then chose to study at Berlin University as a guest, since women were forbidden to be students. She returned home and worked in Konstanecki's laboratory and synthesized a-naphthoflavanol, flavanone, and flavone. By 1907, she held the title of Probleme der katalytischen Forschung at the University of Bern. She was soon promised an adjunct professorship, which would make her the first woman in Switzerland with that title. However, soon World War 1 struck and the government said that because of financial strain they could not promote her. Between 1910 and 1931, Woker wrote four volumes of books regarding the dangers of chemical substances on the human body. From 1911 until her retirement, Woker was the head of the physical- chemical biology laboratory at the University of Berne. In her lab, she conducted studies on peroxidase and catalase, detection methods for natural products and in particular color reactions on sterols. However, her main focus of interest was poisonous gas in war. In 1916, Woker was denied the title of professorship again, this time by a tied vote. In April 1924, Naima Sahlbom and Woker attended the conference of the American Chemical Society in Washington. During a practice of chemical weapons at an arsenal, they surveyed the severity of scientific warfare. Due to a shift in wind, Sahlbom, Woker, and several scientists were exposed to tear gas. In November 1924, the Fourth International Congress of the WILPF convened in Washington, D.C. At the meeting, Ester Akesson-Beskow, Sahlbom, and Woker announced the formation of the Committee Against Scientific Warfare, of which Sahlbom was the chairwoman. In 1925, Woker published \\"The coming war of Poison Gas\\" and sent appeals to Women's International League for Peace and Freedom. This was a result of apprehension from parties to appeal the Geneva Convention. She was specifically concerned about the use of mustard gas and the effect it had on the body. In 1933, she was granted the title of professorship. She retired in 1951 and wrote a two-volume book on the \\"chemistry of natural alkaloids 1953-1956\\". She eventually died on 13 September 1968.

The character first appeared in Zombie's 2003 horror film House of 1000 Corpses, portrayed by Sid Haig. Haig reprised his role as Spaulding in the sequels The Devil's Rejects (2005) and 3 from Hell (2019). Haig also voiced Spaulding in the 2009 animated film The Haunted World of El Superbeasto. The character is depicted as a vulgar and murderous clown. In House of 1000 Corpses, Spaulding is portrayed as the proprietor of a gas station and fried chicken eatery that also houses a roadside attraction known as Captain Spaulding's Museum of Monsters and Madmen. In The Devil's Rejects, he is revealed to be the patriarch of the Firefly family. The character, and Haig himself, have been called icons of modern horror cinema. Fictional character biography Captain Spaulding has a lengthy criminal history, and earned the nickname \\"Cutter\\" for stabbing a man to death. Spaulding met Eve Wilson, also known as Mama Firefly, in 1947, and they had a daughter named Vera-Ellen (also known as Baby Firefly). Years later, Spaulding met Otis B. Driftwood and invited him to become a member of their family. In House of 1000 Corpses, Spaulding is portrayed as the proprietor of a gas station in Texas that also sells fried chicken. The establishment also harbors a roadside haunted house attraction known as Captain Spaulding's Museum of Monsters and Madmen. At the beginning of the film, the establishment is targeted by robbers, whom Spaulding kills. Later in the film, when a group of four people visit his establishment and learn of the local legend of Dr. Satan, Spaulding directs them in the path of the murderous Firefly family. Spaulding's ties to the Firefly clan are kept ambiguous throughout most of the film. In The Devil's Rejects, Spaulding is revealed to be the patriarch of the Firefly family. In the film's opening sequence, Mama Firefly is taken into custody when the Firefly home is subjected to a search and destroy mission by Sheriff John Wydell and a number of state troopers, but Spaulding is elsewhere during the raid. In prison, Wydell stabs Mama Firefly to death as revenge for the murder of his brother George Wydell, whom she fatally shot in the previous film. Spaulding, Otis, and Baby are eventually captured by Wydell and brought to the Firefly house, where Wydell tortures them. Wydell sets the house on fire and leaves Otis and Spaulding to die, while he hunts Baby for sport outside. Tiny, another member of the Firefly clan, intervenes, killing Wydell and saving the trio. Spaulding, Otis, and Baby escape in a 1972 Cadillac Eldorado belonging to Spaulding's half-brother Charlie Altamont, and are shot by authorities while speeding towards a police barricade. In 3 from Hell, Spaulding, Otis, and Baby are revealed to have just barely survived the shootout with the police, and are put on trial and imprisoned shortly after their recovery. A decrepit Spaulding is executed by lethal injection sometime later, leading to Otis and Baby attempting an escape. Development Spaulding was originally supposed to have a bigger role in 3 from Hell, but Sid Haig's real life health issues stopped him from completing the role as it was written, forcing Zombie to greatly reduce his role. Concept and characteristics In the commentary for House of 1000 Corpses, director Rob Zombie describes Spaulding as a \\"lovable asshole\\", and ensured that the character's motivations and connection to the Firefly family would be ambiguous in the film. Spaulding is described in the script for House of 1000 Corpses as a \\"crusty looking old man in a filthy clown suit and smeared make-up\\". Just as several characters from the series are named after characters from Marx Brothers films, Spaulding is named for Groucho Marx's character Captain Jeffrey T. Spaulding from the 1930 film Animal Crackers. Reception Captain Spaulding has been referred to as a modern icon of horror cinema, and Haig himself has been called a \\"horror icon\\" for his portrayal of Spaulding. In describing Spaulding for his review for The Devil's Rejects, film critic Roger Ebert wrote \\"He is a man whose teeth are so bad, they're more frightening than his clown makeup. He plays such a thoroughly disgusting person, indeed, that I was driven to www.sidhaig.com to discover that in real life Sid looks, well, presentable [...] This was a relief to me, because anyone who really looked like Captain Spaulding would send shoppers screaming from the Wal-Mart.\\" References Further reading  Category:Film characters introduced in 2003 Category:Fictional people sentenced to death Category:Fictional serial killers Category:Fictional clowns Category:Male horror film villains Category:Firefly (film series) ","title":"Captain Spaulding (Rob Zombie character)"},{"id":"61874905","text":"Erik Frandsen (12 November 1923 - 19 June 1974) was a Danish field hockey player.

Academic career From Emanuel School, in south-west London, Rose matriculated at St Edmund Hall in the University of Oxford in 1960. He took part in the Oxford Expedition to Cyrenaica 1961, later captained the St Edmund Hall fencing team, became Hall representative for the Oxford University Officers Training Corps, was elected secretary and later chairman of the Oxford University Geological Society, and in 1963 graduated as an Honorary Scholar of St Edmund Hall with First Class Honours in Natural Sciences: Geology. He remained at the Hall but transferred academic studies from the Department of Geology and Mineralogy to the Department of Zoology, funded by a research studentship from the UK Department of Scientific and Industrial Research, to undertake research on fossil echinoids (sea urchins) which he collected from Cenozoic limestones near Derna in Cyrenaica, north-east Libya. On completing studies and submitting his thesis for a DPhil (Doctor of Philosophy) degree in 1966, Rose was immediately appointed to an Assistant Lectureship in Geology at Bedford College in the University of London. Granted tenure and promoted to Lecturer in 1968, he taught palaeontology and stratigraphy in this small department, sharing a heavy teaching and administrative load and additionally being elected to serve for two years as Secretary to the Bedford College Faculty of Science and its subordinate and associated committees, and for two periods as a member of the College's Academic Board. In 1985 Bedford College merged with Royal Holloway College to form Royal Holloway and Bedford New College (now commonly known as Royal Holloway, University of London), and the formerly separate geology departments of Bedford, Chelsea and King's Colleges merged on the Royal Holloway site. Rose prepared the detailed feasibility plan for departmental merger, chaired the committee set up to formulate plans for a new building to accommodate the new geology department (much later to be renamed as the Department of Earth Sciences), and chaired the teaching committee that formulated its first degree programmes. He then led teaching of palaeontology and stratigraphy to first, second and third year undergraduates, chaired the department's undergraduate teaching committee for 12 of the next 15 years, and served as the department's ‚Äòacademic co-ordinator‚Äô (effectively director of undergraduate studies) for the final eight of those years, having been promoted to Senior Lecturer in 1987 under ‚Äòold regulations‚Äô (whereby only 40% of staff in any university were allowed to hold status higher than that of lecturer). Between 1976 and 1999 nine PhD students and one MPhil student successfully completed research degrees under his supervision. He retired to a ‚Äòteaching only‚Äô position in 2000, on reaching the age of 60, and to an honorary research fellowship at Royal Holloway on full retirement in 2003. Palaeontology Various echinoderms Rose's interest in palaeontology began as a schoolboy. He cycled from his parental home in south London to collect fossils, especially echinoids, from the many quarries in Cretaceous chalk then accessible to the south and east of London. Encouraged by palaeontologists at the Natural History Museum in London (then known as the British Museum (Natural History)), he also developed an interest in Cenozoic fossils, on request donating several specimens collected from the London Clay to the Museum's collection ‚Äì his name first appeared in a scientific paper when he was only 14 years old: in the ‚Äòacknowledgements‚Äô within ‚ÄòAdditions to the London Clay fauna of Oxshott, Surrey‚Äô by M.M. Brown and C. P. Castell, published in 1955 in The London Naturalist. Echinoids that Rose found when participating in the Oxford Expedition to Cyrenaica 1961 prompted him to return to Libya in 1964 and to develop studies in the Derna District for his doctoral thesis. He continued research on echinoids after appointment to Bedford College, being a regular contributor (as a speaker and frequently a session chairman) to the series of International Echinoderm Conferences initiated in 1972, and to the European Echinoderm Conferences formally instituted in 1979 (following an earlier conference which he co-convened at Bedford College): at the Smithsonian Institution, Washington DC, USA (1972), Rovinj Marine Institute, Yugoslavia (1976), Free University of Brussels, Belgium (1979), University of South Florida, USA (1981), University College Galway, Ireland (1984), University of Victoria, Canada (1987), University of Burgundy, France (1993), California Academy of Sciences, San Francisco, USA (1996), and the University of Milan, Italy (1998). His participation ended only with his retirement from funded academic life in the year 2000. As sole or joint author, he published 29 articles on fossil or living echinoderms between 1972 and 1999, including the section on echinoids within Chapter 25 Echinodermata of The Fossil Record 2 (ed. M.J. Benton, 1993), a benchmark book published by the Palaeontological Association (). Rose became an active member of the Palaeontological Association, elected to its Council (1969‚Äì1972) only three years after his appointment to Bedford College, elected as Membership Treasurer (1973‚Äì1978) and finally as a Vice-President (1978‚Äì1980), serving on the Council and its Executive and Publication Committees. He similarly served for ten years on the Council of the Palaeontographical Society (1975‚Äì1985), the final four of those years as a Vice-President. In 1981 he was appointed a trustee of the International Trust for Zoological Nomenclature (that from 1947 to 2015 facilitated the work of the International Commission on Zoological Nomenclature) on the recommendation of its secretary, R.V. Melville, who had served as the external examiner for his DPhil thesis, and was elected to serve on its committee of management from 1982 until his resignation in 2006, prior to potential house move. Three of Rose's PhD students completed theses on fossil echinoids, four more theses on other palaeontological topics. Geology An 1875 geological map of Europe, compiled by the Belgian geologist Andr√© Dumont (colors indicate the distribution of rocks of different ages and types across the continent, as they were known then)From 1971, Rose extended work on limestones in the Mediterranean area begun by his DPhil thesis by contributing to the work of the IUGS (International Union of Geological Sciences) Regional Committee on Mediterranean Neogene Stratigraphy (RCMNS). He presented papers at the 5th International Congress on the Mediterranean Neogene (Lyon, France, 1971), 6th Congress (Bratislava, Czechoslovakia, 1975), 7th Congress (Athens, Greece, 1979), 8th Congress (Budapest, Hungary, 1985), and 9th Congress (Barcelona, Spain, 1990), as well as at an ad hoc Ecostratigraphy Colloquium (Montpellier, France, and Barcelona, Spain, 1987). He was co-convener, session chairman and speaker at a ‚ÄòColloquium on Marine Neogene Megafaunal Palaeoenvironments and Biostratigraphy‚Äô at the University of Athens in 1984; elected UK representative on the RCMNS Council for 1984‚Äì1985; and at the 7th Congress elected co-leader of the working group on ‚ÄòMarine Megafaunal Palaeoenvoronments and Biostratigraphy‚Äô. From 1977 to project completion in 1983, Rose served (by invitation of the then Royal Society's British National Committee for the IUGS/UNESCO International Geological Correlation Programme) as UK national correspondent for Project 25 (Stratigraphic Correlation of the Tethys-Paratethys Neogene) and Project 117 (Correlation of events at the Mio- Pliocene Boundary). From 1978 to 1986 he was appointed a member of the IUGS Commission on Stratigraphy's ‚ÄòWorking Party on the Palaeogene-Neogene Boundary‚Äô. Rose was an invited speaker at the Second Symposium on the Geology of Libya, at Tripoli, in 1978; helped lead fieldwork for petroleum consultancies in Libya in 1978 and Oman in 1982; was briefly a visiting lecturer at the University of El Minia, Egypt, in 1985; and under the auspices of the British Council, a visiting lecturer and D-√®s-Sc examiner at the University of Tunis, Tunisia, in 1987. Rose's research interests in limestone stratigraphy and palaeoenvironments were focused for some years on the Maltese islands (he was co-author of a Field Guide to Mid-Tertiary Carbonate Facies of Malta published by the Palaeontological Association for a field trip for which he was convening leader, in 1981), but subsequently and even more productively on Gibraltar. From 1989 he has, as sole or joint author, generated over 40 publications on the geology of this famous ‚ÄòRock‚Äô, including the first large- scale printed map of the peninsula and an accompanying field guide, plus papers on topics including the stratigraphy, depositional palaeoenvironments, dolomitisation, brachiopod palaeontology, micropalaeontology, hydrogeology, and tunnelling excavation of the Jurassic ‚ÄòGibraltar Limestone‚Äô, aspects of its Quaternary geomorphology and sedimentary cover, and the history of research by British pioneers of Gibraltarian geology. Rose was elected a Fellow of the Geological Society of London (FGS) in 1963, and a Senior Fellow in 2013, having been accredited as a Chartered Geologist (CGeol) in 1991. Two of his PhD students completed theses on Cenozoic limestones (one for Malta and the other Sicily), and an MPhil student completed a thesis on Cenozoic sediments of northern Iraq. Military aspects of geology Royal Engineers' Surveyors in EuropeRose began an association with the military as with geological research at the age of 14. He joined Emanuel School Combined Cadet Force (CCF) as a cadet in September 1954, as soon as he was old enough (and so then expected to do so), winning the annual recruit's prize at the end of the academic year in 1955. He completed his CCF service in December 1959, as the senior cadet (Flight Sergeant) leading the school's Royal Air Force section. On admission to the University of Oxford in autumn 1960, Rose joined the Oxford University Officers Training Corps as a cadet, gaining a commission as a 2nd Lieutenant (General List, Territorial Army: TA) in 1962. On graduation in 1963, he transferred to Q (Queen's Own Oxfordshire Hussars) Battery, 299 Field Regiment Royal Artillery (TA), being promoted Lieutenant in 1963 and to the senior subalterns‚Äô post of Gun Position Officer ‚Äì being selected to march through London, sword reversed, in the State Funeral of the QOOH Honorary Colonel, Sir Winston Churchill, in 1965. On reorganisation of the reserve army in 1967, he transferred to B (Oxford Rifles) Company of the Oxfordshire Battalion, Royal Green Jackets. On further reorganisation in 1969, he transferred to the Engineer Specialist Pool at Central Volunteer Headquarters Royal Engineers (CVHQRE), as a military geologist. In this role he was promoted Captain in 1970, acting Major in 1974 (and substantive Major on achieving the minimum age), acting Lieutenant Colonel in 1978 (and substantive Lieutenant Colonel on achieving the minimum age). He served from 1987 to 1990 as a Colonel, as Commander of the RE Specialist Advisory Team and the ten Specialist Teams RE(V) then administered by CVHQRE to help provide technical expertise necessary to bring the British regular army from peace to war strength. He was awarded the TD (the Long Service Decoration of the Territorial and Army Volunteer Reserve) in 1974, a 1st clasp in 1980, a 2nd clasp in 1986. During his 21 years as a military geologist (the last 16 of these as the senior geologist with call-out liability), Rose was briefly attached to units of the regular army, Royal Air Force, Royal Navy or United Nations to participate in projects, exercises or operations in the UK and many overseas territories ‚Äì for the regular British armed forces have no geologists who serve as such. He notably conducted fieldwork in Thailand (1969, 1970), Malta (1973, 1974), Gibraltar (1973‚Äì1975, 1981, 1983, 1987), Hong Kong (1978, 1979, 1981), Cyprus (1983, 1985, 1986), Belize (1984) and Germany (1971, 1977‚Äì1982, 1985‚Äì1987), and generated some 60 unpublished reports, mostly not in the public domain. He also contributed a chapter (on geological maps and other information sources) to the textbook Manual of Applied Geology for Engineers, published in 1976 jointly by the Ministry of Defence and the Institution of Civil Engineers, and for its time influential in educating both military and civil engineers (). On completion of the tenure of his appointment as Commander RESAT (Royal Engineers Specialist Advisory Team) in 1990, in the highest rank then obtainable in the TA by a Royal Engineers officer, Rose transferred to the Regular Army Reserve of Officers, reaching the age limit for his rank in September 1998. In 1996 he was appointed by the University of London Council to its Military Education Committee (MEC), and subsequently elected Deputy chairman, and finally Chairman of the MEC, prior to resignation in 2009 preparatory to moving home from Amersham near London to Christchurch in Dorset, closer to the region in which his wife of 40 years had her family roots. In his MEC role he was active in monitoring the activities of the University of London Officers Training Corps, Royal Naval Unit, and Air Squadron. From 1999 to 2009 he served additionally as the Universities‚Äô Representative Member of the Reserve Forces and Cadets Association for Greater London, and from 2005 to 2009 as a member of the Executive Committee of the Council of Military Education Committees of the Universities of the United Kingdom (COMEC), thus extending his association with university and military activities long beyond his retirement from lecturing. Subsequent career and interests Following his retirement from the TA in 1990, Rose has been active in promoting an understanding of the military applications of geology, contributing to the development of what is now an established series of International Conferences on Military Geosciences. He was the only person to attend all the conferences pre 2011 (when an operation for cancer prevented his travel to Las Vegas in the USA): he presented papers in Seattle, USA (1994), Warwick, UK (1996), Toronto, Canada (1998), Chatham, UK (2000), West Point, USA (2003), Nottingham, UK (2005), Quebec, Canada (2007), and Vienna, Austria (2009). He co-convened the Warwick meeting and co-edited its subsequent proceedings book; co-led field trips to Normandy after the Warwick and Nottingham meetings; gave keynote addresses in Nottingham and Quebec; served on the Advisory Committees for meetings at Nottingham, Quebec, Vienna, and Las Vegas; and chaired sessions at most of the conferences in this series. His contributions to the success of the conference series and the international significance of his publications were honoured by a dedicatory article in the Vienna post-conference book: H√§usler, H. 2011. Celebrating the 70th birthday of the senior British military geologist Dr Edward P F Rose. In: H√§usler, H. & Mang, R (eds) International Handbook Military Geography Vol. 2. Truppendienst, Vienna, pp. 287‚Äì297. He resumed attendance in 2013, presenting an opening paper and chairing a session at the next conference in the series (the 10th International Conference on Military Geosciences), at Aviemore in Scotland, and being elected Honorary President of the International Association for Military Geosciences (IAMG) founded at that meeting. He presented two papers and chaired the IAMG Biennial General Meeting at the 11th ICMG, at the US Naval Academy, Annapolis, in June 2015, where he was re- elected President of the IAMG, to complete a four-year term. At the 12th ICMG, at the University of Stellenbosch in South Africa, he presented three more papers and again chaired the Biennial General Meeting of the IAMG, before handing over to his successor as President and being re-elected to the IAMG Council as Past-President for a further four-year term. He gave the opening keynote address and a second paper at the 13th ICMG, at the University of Padua in Italy in June 2019, and served on the conference's organising committee. Rose is a member of the British Commission for Military History. Publications Including 20 of his publications on Gibraltar, but excluding abstracts, book reviews and conference reports, Rose has contributed (mostly as sole or first author) to over 120 articles on military aspects of geology, mostly in the Royal Engineers Journal, Geological Society of London Special Publications, Quarterly Journal of Engineering Geology and Hydrogeology, Earth Sciences History, Cartographic Journal, Channel Islands Occupation Review, Geology Today, Proceedings of the Geologists‚Äô Association, and Reviews in Engineering Geology of the Geological Society of America. Overall these contribute to an understanding of military aspects of geology from their first perception during Napoleonic times at the turn of the 18th/19th centuries; introduction of geology into the curriculum at all the military officer training establishments in England during the 19th century and influence in the establishment of what is now the British Geological Survey; use by uniformed officers of opposing armies to guide groundwater abstraction and military tunnelling during World War I; and use to guide groundwater abstraction and terrain evaluation (especially by specialist maps to guide rapid construction of temporary airfields and choice of routes for cross- country movement by tracked or wheeled vehicles) during World War II. The book Geology and Warfare (published by the Geological Society of London in 2000), for which Rose was the senior of two editors, was the first of its kind in the UK; additionally, his published case histories of German military geological work during occupation of the Channel Islands have provided a unique insight into German expertise deployed on British terrain during World War II; and a 2003 Geologists‚Äô Association Guide to the Geology of the D-Day landings in Normandy, 1944 (for which he was the senior of two authors), together with related articles, have provided an exceptionally detailed record of the influence of geology and geologists on the greatest amphibious assault in world history. Rose was the senior co-editor of and a major contributor to the book Military Aspects of Hydrogeology (published by the Geological Society of London in 2012) and also its companion volume, Military Aspects of Geology: Fortification, Excavation and Terrain Evaluation, published by the Society online in 2018 (to help mark the centenary of the end of the First World War) and in hard copy in January 2019.

Location The Watshishou River originates in Lake Watshishou, and flows south via Lake Holt and Little Lake Holt to enter the Gulf of Saint Lawrence. The river is long, and receives water from many lakes. It drains a basin of . Quebec Route 138 crosses the river near its mouth. It enters the Jacques Cartier Strait between Havre-Saint-Pierre and Natashquan, west of the Little Watshishou River. In its upper course the river flows through the unorganized territory of Lac-J√©r√¥me. Lower down it flows through the municipality of Aguanish. The river's mouth is in the municipality of Baie-Johan-Beetz in Minganie Regional County Municipality. The river basin lies between the basins of the V√©ronique River to the west and the Little Watshishou River to the east. The river basin contains the Nabisipi River Old Forest (For√™t ancienne de la Rivi√®re Nabisipi) and the Lake Davy Old Forest (For√™t ancienne du Lac Davy). In the last none of the land of the coastal region exceeds in elevation. The terrain is fairly smooth, sloping gently down to the Gulf of Saint Lawrence. To the east of Watshishou Harbor the Morne Watshishou stands out at over . Name The topnym Watshishou is probably the same as the \\"R. Oueachechou\\" on Boish√©bert's 1715 map, and Oydchechou on Bellin's 1744 map. Later maps spell it Watcheeshoo, Watsheeshou, Watscheeshoo, Watsjishu and Watchichou. The Dictionary of Rivers and Lakes of the Province of Quebec (1914 and 1925) gives it as Watshishou. In the Innu language it means \\"white mountain\\" or \\"bright mountain\\". It probably refers to the landmark polished granite Watshishou Hill, high to the east of the mouth of the Watshishou River. Others say the word comes from watsh (mountain) and shu (small), meaning small mountain. Another Innu name for the river is Uetiheu Hipu, meaning \\"it rejoins\\". Fishing Lac Holt Fishing Lodge provides access to the Watshishou, Big Holt and Little Holt lakes, and can be reached by float plane from Havre-Saint-Pierre. The lodge offers fishing from boats or wading below rapids. Fish include brook trout (Salvelinus fontinalis), Arctic char (Salvelinus alpinus), and landlocked Atlantic salmon (Salmo salar). A 2018 North Atlantic Salmon Conservation Organization (NASCO) Rivers Database Report gave the status of the river as \\"Not Threatened With Loss\\". In May 2015 the Ministry of Forests, Wildlife and Parks of Quebec announced a sport fishing catch-and-release program for large salmon on sixteen of Quebec's 118 salmon rivers. These were the Mitis, Laval, Pigou, Bouleau, aux Rochers, Jupitagon, Magpie, Saint-Jean, Corneille, Piashti, Watshishou, Little Watshishou, Nabisipi, Aguanish and Natashquan rivers. The Quebec Atlantic Salmon Federation said that the measures did not go nearly far enough in protecting salmon for future generations. In view of the rapidly declining Atlantic salmon population catch-and-release should have been implemented on all rivers apart from northern Quebec.

She holds the position of Professor and Head of the Department of Speech, Language, and Hearing Sciences (SLHS) at the University of Arizona (UA) and is the principal investigator at the eponymous Plante Laboratory at UA. Plante is also affiliated with the Cognitive Science program at UA. In 2018, Plante received Honors of the American Speech-Language-Hearing Association (ASHA) at their annual convention. Plante is co-author (with Pelagie M. Beeson) of the textbook Communication and Communication Disorders: A Clinical Introduction. She also co-authored Human Communication and its Disorders (with Daniel Boone).  Biography  The second of five children, Elena Margaret Plante was born in 1961 in Baltimore, Maryland, to Kenneth Louis and Carmen (n√©e Hechmer) Plante. Plante received her Bachelor of Arts in Speech-Language Pathology from Loyola University Maryland (formerly Loyola College) in 1984. In 1985, Plante completed her Master of Science, also in Speech-Language Pathology, at the same university. Plante received her Ph.D. in Speech and Hearing Science with a minor in Neuroscience at UA in 1990. Completed under the supervision of pediatrician Anna Binkiewicz, Plante's dissertation, \\"Cerebral configurations among the parents and siblings of language-disordered boys,\\" analyzed the neuroanatomy of four language-impaired children and provided evidence for the theory that language impairments have a genetic basis. From 1990 to 1992, Plante was a postdoctoral fellow in Speech and Hearing Science at UA before joining the faculty of the department. With her colleague Rebecca Vance, Plante runs Talk MOORE, a six-week summer camp for preschool-age children with speech and language impairments. Children in the program are exposed to structured, individualized therapies and group activities designed to improve reading readiness. Much of her research at UA aims to develop effective therapies for children with developmental language disorders; this work has been funded by grants from the National Institute of Health. In 2018, Plante was elected to serve as the Vice President for Science and Research of the 2019 ASHA Board of Directors.  Research  Plante is a co-author of the Test of Integrated Language & Literacy Skills (TILLS) (with Nickola Nelson, Nancy Helm-Estabrooks, and Gillian Hotz). The TILLS is a standardized assessment tool with fifteen subtests that is used to evaluate language and literacy skills and associated deficits in listening, reading, writing, and speaking skills. With her colleagues, Plante developed the Pediatric Test of Brain Injury (PTBI), a standardized assessment tool used to measure deficits in school readiness after brain injury in children ages 6‚Äì16. Plante and her colleagues' articles have won three Editor's Awards from the ASHA journals in which they were published. This award is given annually to the most meritorious single article that appeared in the journal in the previous year. Plante and her colleagues Tammy J. Spaulding and Kimberly A. Farinella were honored in 2007 for their article, \\"Eligibility criteria for language impairment: Is the low end of normal always appropriate?\\" published in Language, Speech, and Hearing Services in Schools (LSHSS). This paper outlined difficulties associated with the use of low scores on standardized tests as a means of identifying children with language impairments, and emphasized how sensitivity and specificity rates may assist clinicians in making accurate diagnoses. Plante and her coauthors Janne von Koss Torkildsen, Natalie S. Dailey, Jessica M. Aguilar, and Rebecca G√≥mez received the 2014 Editor's Award for \\"Exemplar variability facilitates rapid learning of an otherwise unlearnable grammar by individuals with language-based learning disability,\\" published in the Journal of Speech, Language, and Hearing Research. This paper replicated and extended previous research demonstrating the importance of exemplar variation in supporting generalization of the grammatical patterns of an artificial language. Plante and colleagues reported that adults with language-based learning disabilities generalized grammatical patterns only when the input was highly variable, with many different words exemplifying the grammatical patterns. A third Editor's Award came in 2017 for Plante's LSHSS article \\"Dose schedule and enhanced conversational recast treatment for children with specific language impairment,\\" co-authored with Christina N. Meyers-Denman. This paper demonstrated benefits of conversational recasts in supporting children's learning of grammatical morphology, where the therapist adds or corrects grammatical elements (e.g., word endings) while repeating back what the child has just said.

Education  Ham grew up in York, Pennsylvania and graduated from York High School. She received a BA in history from Howard University in 1970 and received her Masters from Boston University in 1971. She also completed a PhD at Howard University.  Career  After graduating, she spent the summer as an intern at the National Archives. In 1972, Ham began work as an archivist and Black History Specialist at the National Archives. While there, she helped co-found the Afro-American Historical and Genealogical Society in 1977. She also compiled and prepared finding aids for the Social Security Administration, the Office of Economic Opportunity and the Department of Labor. In 1986 she moved to the Library of Congress, working as the specialist in African American History and Culture in the Manuscript Division. Under her care were papers of influential people such as Booker T. Washington, Frederick Douglass and Thurgood Marshall. While at the Library of Congress, she was the curator of the exhibit, \\"African American Odyssey: Quest for Full Citizenship,\\" and edited the catalog of the exhibit. In 1995, she left the Library of Congress to become a professor of history at Morgan State University, a position she held til her retirement in 2016. Her special interests include the study of African Americans, women, public history and archival methods. She commands her classrooms and even takes students on visits to local archives and museums. She is passionate about putting African Americans in the narrative and not treating them as victims. Instead, \\"I plan to focus on African Americans as overcomers.‚Äù She has worked to disrupt the myth that black history isn't taught because of a lack of records. She states in an interview with Jim McClure, ‚ÄúThere is an unbelievable ocean of African-American history resources for people who are interested in viewing them or studying them.‚Äù One of her most well-known works is The African-American Mosaic which was published through the Library of Congress. The guide lists many examples of pieces at the Library of Congress that examine African-American life, including \\"government documents, manuscripts, books, photographs, recordings and films.\\" Ham also includes work on African Americans, or by African Americans, from other notable historians. Many archivists and historians use her guide in the study of African American history. When asked about her impact on the archival profession, she responded: > I would say that I honestly believe that the resources that I have provided > in these 30 years of my doing historical work, the resources that I have > identified have deepened and broadened the scope of African-American history > ‚Ä¶ because my people didn‚Äôt know about the availability of these resources. During her career, Ham served on a number of professional bodies. She was a member of the Association for the Study of African American Life and History, and served on the executive council from 1989 and was national secretary from 1992. She was on the editorial board of the Society of American Archivists from 1989 and she was publications director of the Association of Black Women Historians from 1986-1990. Ham was also involved with the Oral History Association. = Recognition = In 2011, Ham received an Avoice award from the Congressional Black Caucus Foundation, for excellence in historical research. Her publication Black History: A Guide has won several awards, including awards from the Society of American Archives and the Mid-Atlantic Regional Archives Conference.

Introduction of the SI system in Norway  In 1683, Norway was in union with Denmark and standardized on a common measurement system with Denmark, but old Norwegian measurements continued to be used locally in Norway. After the union ended in 1814, the Norwegian professor and director for geographic measurements Christopher Hansteen asserted that it was inconvenient having to travel to Copenhagen in Denmark to calibrate Norwegian measurement standards, and also claimed that the Danish system had some crucial flaws. He succeeded in getting an own Norwegian measurement system approved by Norwegian law in 1824. The unit \\"foot\\" (Norwegian fot) was defined as 12/38 of the length a pendulum with a period of 1 second, and a \\"trade pound\\" (handlespund) was defined as the weight of 1/62 cubic feet of water. Norway was in union with Sweden, and the new special Norwegian measurement system was very unpopular with the Swedes, being viewed as an act of stubbornness. The Swedish instead wanted the Norwegians to switch to the Swedish system. Between 1860 and 1863, Hansteen explained in a series of articles in the Norwegian magazine Morgenbladet that he had been pressured by the Swedish Stadtholder and other official Swedish representatives, who complained that the \\"Norwegians were unwilling to fulfill Swedish requirement\\" (\\"Norm√¶ndenes Uvillie til at opfylde Sveriges Fordringr\\"). Hansteen instead publicly defended the Norwegian system, saying it was based on natural measurements, claiming that it was better than the Swedish system, and that it would be more natural for Sweden to switch to the Norwegian system. No solution was found; Norway and Sweden mainly produced the same types of products for export, so there was little trade between the two countries. Besides, it was also argued that it would be very costly to change the measurement system so shortly after its introduction. \\"All in all\\", Hansteen said, \\"Norway would lose all the above-mentioned benefits of our system, without Sweden gaining any discernible advantage\\" (\\"Alt i alt ville Norge tabe alle de ovenom talte Fordele ved vort System, uden at Sverige herved vandt nogen m√¶rkelig fordeel\\").Morgenbladet 10. mai 1860. In 1873, Norwegian politician Ole Jacob Broch entered the measurement system debate by becoming the leader of a commission which was to evaluate the introduction of the metric system in Norway. Broch was educated as a mathematician, and was working as a politician both in his municipality and as a state council at the Storting. Late in his life he had become engaged in debates about weights and measures. His commission asserted that the Norwegian measurement system was antiquated, and that a material standard (using prototypes) would give a much greater precision than the pendulum standard. Additionally, the decimal based meter system was so simple that it could be learned in a few minutes, as opposed to the Norwegian system. However, the conclusion of the commission met resistance, since \\"as with any sudden change in something that has existed for a long time, change results in confusion, and therefore stubborn resistance among the crowd\\" (\\"da det som enhver pludselig Forandring i det Bestaaende i lang Tid frembrin ge Forvirring og derfor m√∏de haardnakket Modstand blant M√¶ngden\\"). There was also fierce opposition in other countries towards the metric system, both in regards to its introduction, but also towards the principle on international collaboration to manage it. From when Broch met as the Norwegian representative on an international conference in 1872, he played a key part by becoming a bridge builder on the issue internationally by using his academic expertise, energy and diplomatic skills. The French had insisted on introducing the metric system under their control, but other countries wanted an international organisation to manage it. As a compromise, an international committee of 12 members was set up, with Broch being one of the members. This was seen as a de facto recognition of Norway as an independent nation, who were in union with Sweden at the time. By Broch's strategy and thorough work, the international committee achieved the \\"meter convention\\" in 1875. Here it was decided that an international institute would be set up to be responsible for the meter system, and for keeping prototypes for length and weight. Representatives from 17 countries signed the convention. Sweden was long opposed, and Denmark had little interest, but both countries eventually signed. Broch avoided Nordic coordination on the matter, which could only harm Norway's views.  A \\"coup\\"  At the same time, Broch worked with two issues nationally: * Introduction of the metric system in Norwegian law. * Norwegian membership in the meter convention. His national committee presented a bill on the transition to the meter system, which was passed on 22 May 1875. Already in 1873 he had the Norwegian government accept an international measurement institute \\"in principle\\", and in the spring of 1875 he made sure that the necessary decisions were made in a \\"unprecedented haste\\".J. A. Seip: ¬´Ole Jacob Broch og hans samtid¬ª, Gyldendal 1971 The Conference on the Meter Convention started on 1 March, and on 15 April Broch sent a preliminary announcement to the Norwegian government from Paris. The Norwegian Cabinet was able to have a recommendation ready on 27 April, and the royal council order was ready on 5 May. Broch sent a report on the outcome of the conference on 5 May, despite the fact that the convention was not signed until 20 May. Norwegian participation in the meter convention was ratified, and financial contribution to the establishment and operation of an international measuring institute was granted by the Storting on 26 May. Norway was the first country to ratify the treaty, and this is probably the fastest treatment ever done in the Norwegian parliament in peacetime. Swedish objections first reached 17 June and did not matter. Sweden ratified the meter convention three years later, and Denmark 32 years later in 1907.  Continued importance of the meter convention in Norway  The development of the units of measurement and the introduction of the meter convention gave Norway the opportunity to demonstrate its independence. In 1879 Broch gained the recognition of becoming the third director of the International Bureau of Weights and Measures (BIPM), serving until 1888. Later, the metric system has been expanded, and is known today as the SI system. Through scientific innovations, the whole SI system has been fully defined based on fixed natural constants since 2019, with the help of the theory of relativity, quantum mechanics and atomic physical phenomena. SI units can be realized in universal experiments that can be performed in national laboratories, so that new measurement prototypes can be realized. International trade, environmental agreements and research are based on confidence in measurements, the SI system and cooperation in the meter convention. Justervesenet is Norway's representative in the international measurement technology community, and are regularly required to demonstrate their expertise in the national laboratory of measurements.

History  The 213th Rifle Division began forming on 15 December 1941 at Kattakurgan, assigned to the Central Asian Military District. It was commanded by Major General Pyotr Shevchenko. The 213th included the 585th, 702nd, and 693rd Rifle Regiments, the 671st Artillery Regiment, and the 387th Sapper Battalion, along with other smaller units. It remained in the district until early 1943, guarding the Soviet‚ÄìAfghan border near Kerki and Termez. The 213th was transferred to the Reserve of the Supreme High Command (RVGK) on 25 February of that year. In mid-March, it joined the 64th Army (soon to become the 7th Guards Army) of the Voronezh Front and was sent to the Gremyachye area. At the end of March, its units fought in fierce offensive battles to seize the railway station of Kreyda, then in April and May, as part of the 25th Guards Rifle Corps of the army, defended the line of the Seversky Donets near Belgorod. Shevchenko was sent to the rear for treatment of an illness in June and was replaced by Colonel Ivan Buslayev. The 213th fought against the attacks of the 4th Panzer Army and Army Detachment Kempf during the Battle of Kursk in July. Remaining with the 7th Guards Army for the Soviet offensive that began in August, it transferred to the 37th Army of the 2nd Ukrainian Front in November after the Battle of the Dnieper. The division spent most of 1944 with the 48th Rifle Corps of the 52nd Army. After advancing through Romania in August and September of that year, the 52nd Army transferred to the RVGK and was moved north to join the 1st Ukrainian Front by November. With the 52nd Army, the division fought in the Vistula‚ÄìOder Offensive in January, the Upper Silesian Offensive in March, the Siege of Breslau, and the Prague Offensive in May. After the end of the war, from late June, the 52nd Army was withdrawn to Poland and then to western Ukraine. Later that year, the 213th was stationed at Lvov, still with the 48th Rifle Corps. When the headquarters of the 52nd Army became that of the 8th Tank Army on 12 June 1946, the division was disbanded with its corps.

Sa! Sa! Due to Sukuna bikona's gift of liquor to the people, he is sometimes paired with the goddess of food Uke Mochi. The reference to the standing stone in the song refers to his worship as a sacred stone. Both Sukuna bikona and Ohona-mochi are enshrined as sacred stones in a temple in Noto Province. Shrines In Shinto, it is believed that the god resides within a sacred object housed at the shrine. It is possible for a deity to be in more than one place at a time, as such a Kami may be housed at many shrines, as well as being omnipresent and omniscient. Sukuna Hikona is enshrined at, Oarai Isosaki-jinja. In the Montoku Jitsuroku, a book of Japanese history, ≈åkuninushi and Sukuna Hikona descended in 856 A.D., proclaiming that they had returned to help the people of the land and a shrine was built to honor their arrival.

It is endemic to New Zealand. It is found in the South Island and is regarded as being uncommon.  Taxonomy  This species was first described by Edward Meyrick in 1883 using specimens collected at Castle Hill and Dunedin and given the name Arsinoe prionota. Meyrick described the species in more detail in 1884. In 1886 Meyrick recognised that the genus name he had used for this species had been used previously and renamed the genus in which he placed this species as Anachloris. In 1917 Meyrick synonymised Anachloris with Hydriomena. George Hudson described and illustrated the species both in his 1898 book New Zealand Moths and Butterflies (Macro-lepidoptera) and in his 1928 book The Butterflies and Moths of New Zealand using the name Hydriomena prionota. In 1971 J. S. Dugdale placed this species within the genus Austrocidaria. Dugdale suggested that A. prionota may actually be the same species as Austrocidaria lithurgia. The lectotype specimen is held at the Canterbury Museum.  Description  Hudson described the species as follows: A. prionota is likely variable in appearance. This species has been confused with Austrocidaria cedrinodes as the two species are similar in appearance. However they can be easily distinguished from each other as A. prionota has a complete lack of antennal pectinations.  Distribution  This species is endemic to New Zealand. This species occurs in the South Island and has been collected at Gouland Downs in the Kahurangi National Park, as well as at Castle Hill in Christchurch and in Dunedin. It is regarded as not common and difficulty has been had sourcing specimens good enough for the addition of this species into a photographic database.  Biology and behaviour  The larvae of A. prionota have been recorded feeding on Myrsine divaricata as well as on species of Coprosma. This species is on wing in January and October. The adult moth is regarded as being a medium flyer with the ability to remain active in light breezes. An adult moth is attracted to light and has been collected via Robinson light trapping.

It was founded in 1988 by members of the Muslim Students Association at the University of Pennsylvania (Penn MSA). Eight years later, the mosque became independent from the Penn MSA and, around 2009, acquired ownership of the building. Located at 4228 Walnut Street, in a historic building formerly occupied by the Commodore Theatre, the mosque currently serves a large and diverse Muslim population in the neighborhood. The mosque's name itself signals its importance to the community, as the Arabic etymology suggests. In Arabic, Masjid Al-Jamia means ‚Äúthe congregational mosque‚Äù, typically where Muslims meet for Friday prayers. Worship and services Side door of Masjid Al-Jamia The Masjid Al-Jamia offers religious services for the five daily prayers common to Muslims, and for the Friday congregational prayer. It also sponsors regular lectures, an annual Ramadan program associated with the month of fasting, and prayers for the ‚ÄòEid holidays. The mosque also provides an Islamic School for children. As of 2019, the imam was Yahaya A Adam. Ownership and administration As a non-profit organization, Masjid Al-Jamia is independently administered. According to City of Philadelphia property records, the owner of the mosque building, which is located at 4228 Walnut Street and which covers 12,541 square feet, is the North American Islamic Trust, Inc. This organization, NAIT, identifies the building as an Islamic charitable endowment, or waqf. Founded in 1973 by the national Muslim Students Association ‚Äì an umbrella organization that helps to coordinate Muslim student activities on college and university campuses throughout the United States ‚Äì NAIT declared on its website in 2019 that it was holding titles to mosques as waqfs in over forty U.S. states, with the goal of ensuring their long-term stability. Building Masjid Al-Jamia occupies the site of a former movie theater, the Commodore Theatre, which opened in 1928 and originally held 1,105 seats. The building has a distinctive architectural style. Designed by the Ballinger Company, in association with the architects Hoffman & Henon, the edifice reflected the Spanish Revival or Moorish architectural style, which was popular in the 1920s. After its closure in the late 1950s, the building briefly held a live theater. As indicated in a photograph from the Urban Archives of Temple University Libraries, the building housed a church called the ‚ÄúMiracle Revival Tabernacle‚Äù in 1964. History Historically the Masjid Al-Jamia has had a close relationship with sections of the Muslim community at the University of Pennsylvania, whose campus is located in West Philadelphia. As part of a community history project aided by Scribe Video Center, interviewees recalled many occasions when members of the Masjid Al-Jamia community gathered with Penn Muslim students for Islamic study circles, social events, Friday prayers and holiday celebrations.Muhga Eltigani, Director. Muslim Voices of Philadelphia. Philadelphia, PA: Scribe Video Center, 2014. URL: https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-rkTu8i4Hsg In particular, the mosque has had relations with the Penn Muslim Students Association (‚ÄúPenn MSA‚Äù), which is the University of Pennsylvania chapter of the nationwide organization, MSA National. MSA National was founded in 1963 to facilitate Muslim life among students in diverse campus settings. Today, the MSA chapters ‚Äì Penn‚Äôs included ‚Äì work under the umbrella of the Islamic Society of North America, which declares its mission to ‚Äúfoster the development of the Muslim community, interfaith relations, civic engagement, and better understandings of Islam.‚Äù Community Masjid Al-Jamia stands at the heart of what has become ‚Äúthe city‚Äôs biggest and most diverse Muslim community‚Äù, including members who have immigrated from many countries including Bangladesh, Mali, and Egypt. An article published in 2011 in The Philadelphia Inquirer featured the mosque and described members like Mohammed Mahsin Khan, a 39-year-old Bangladeshi, who explained that prior to its establishment, he drove to New Jersey or to Northeast Philadelphia to pray.

It had a magnitude of 5.6 and a maximum felt intensity of VII (very strong) on the Modified Mercalli scale. There was severe damage in Mirpur District, causing the deaths of 40 people and injuring a further 850. The epicentre of the shallow quake was near the city of Mirpur, Pakistan. The tremors were felt in the Kashmir region, Punjab (Pakistan), Punjab (India), Uttarakhand and northern parts of India including New Delhi. Tectonic setting Kashmir lies at the southern margin of the broad zone of continental collision between the Eurasian and Indian Plates. The rate of convergence between these plates near this location is 38 mm per year. The main structures involved in accommodating this convergence are large thrust faults, such as the Main Central Thrust and the Main Frontal Thrust. Within the frontal thrust zone, there are many individual thrust faults. Many damaging earthquakes have resulted from movement on such thrust faults, such as the 2005 Kashmir earthquake which caused the deaths of around 87,000 people. Damage The earthquake caused severe damage to 135 houses in Mirpur District, with a further 319 being partially damaged, most in Mirpur and just four in Bhimber District. Two bridges were reported damaged and parts of several roads were affected, particularly 14 km of the Main Jatlan Road. According to the chairman of Pakistan's National Disaster Management Authority (NDMA), \\"In Mirpur, besides the city, a small town Jatlan, and two small villages Manda and Afzalpur\\" were among the worst-hit areas. According to him, the main road which runs alongside a river from Mangla to Jatla suffered major damage. According to the officials, the Mangla Dam, Pakistan's major water reservoir, was spared. However, the dam's power house was closed, which resulted in a loss of 900 megawatts to Pakistan's national power grid. At 7:20 pm, power generation at Mangla was resumed, restoring 700 MW to the national grid. According to a media report, cracks and fissures had appeared in the Upper Jhelum canal. Flood water had managed to enter the Chak Nigah village in Jatlan town. The canal was subsequently shut as a precautionary measure. Casualties Forty people have died and more than 850 injured as per the reports published on 26 September. Of those who died, thirty-three were in Mirpur District, four in Bhimber District, and one more in Jhelum District. Reuters reported, citing architects, that the large number of casualties were due to shoddy building construction methods and weak construction standards in Pakistan. Sardar Gulfaraz Khan, the deputy inspector general of police for Mirpur district, stated that a large number of deaths were caused due to the collapse of old houses in the villages. Response The Prime Minister of Azad Jammu and Kashmir, Farooq Haider Khan, cut short a visit to Lahore and went back to his native region immediately after the reports of the damage emerged. NDMA vehicles laden with 200 tents, 800 blankets, 200 kitchen sets and 100 medical kits were dispatched to affected areas. Aftershocks On 26 September at 12:30, two days after the major earthquake, another earthquake struck Mirpur, which led to a further 67 people being injured and one death reported. It was of magnitude 4.7 and centered at Thothal Mirpur at the depth of .

Her pioneering research elucidated the roles of cognition, emotion, and social behavior in language acquisition. Bloom is the author of several books on language acquisition, including One Word At a Time: The Use of Single-Word Utterances Before Syntax, the culmination of Bloom's first longitudinal study, and the first-ever published study of language acquisition to use video-recorded data. Language Development From Two To Three a collection of findings from research studies spanning two decades, highlights the tremendous achievements in language acquisition that occur during this period of childhood. For Language Development and Language Disorders, which she co-wrote with Margaret Lahey, Bloom connected her research with her early experience as a speech therapist working with language-delayed children. It offers guidelines for speech therapists assessing and assisting children with language delays. The Transition From Infancy to Language: Acquiring the Power of Expression was the inaugural winner of the Eleanor E. Maccoby Book Award from the American Psychological Association, Division 7, which recognizes the author of influential books in the field of developmental psychology. Bloom received the Distinguished Achievement Award by the New York City Speech-Hearing-Language Association in 1986, and received honors from the American Speech‚ÄìLanguage‚ÄìHearing Association in 1992. She received the G. Stanley Hall Medal from the American Psychological Association for Distinguished Contributions to Developmental Psychology in 1997, and the Distinguished Scientific Contribution Award from the Society for Research in Child Development in 2003.  Education  Bloom received her B.A. in 1956 from Pennsylvania State University, where she is a distinguished alumna. Today, the Penn State Child Study Center holds annual Lois Bloom Lecture on child development, funded by gifts from Bloom and psychologist Edward Lee Thorndike. Bloom earned her M.A. at the University of Maryland in 1958, and her Ph.D. with distinction at Columbia University in 1968. Her dissertation, Language Development: Form and Function in Emerging Grammars, was supervised by sociolinguist William Labov. Her research, involving case studies of the early utterances of three children, was highly influential in the field of language acquisition.  Research  Bloom's research helped ushered in a semantic revolution in the field of language acquisition. Linguist and philosopher Noam Chomsky hypothesized a ‚Äúlanguage acquisition device‚Äù‚Äîhard-wired structures in the brain dedicated to language acquisition‚Äîto account for the speed with which infants learn language. In contrast, Bloom's research, according to The New York Times, \\"pioneered the new trend\\" of examining children's two-word utterances for semantic intent as well as word distribution. By focusing on the semantics of children's utterances, she demonstrated that language reflects how children make meaning out of their previously non-linguistic representations of knowledge. Throughout her career, Bloom remained focused on placing the child, and his or her environment, at the center of her research. In her keynote address at Boston University's 25th Conference on Language development, Bloom discussed her concern that advances in technology allowed researchers to study a child's utterances while ignoring the context in which the child produces that language. In The Intentionality Model and Language Acquisition, she refers to the \\"authority of the child\\"‚Äîof central importance is the child's contents of mind, which he or she expresses through language and behavior. According to Bloom's theory, interaction with the world, and the feedback that results, drives development. The intentionality model Bloom developed with researcher Erin Tinker depicts language development as the result of engagement and effort. It takes work to acquire language, and engagement with one's environment motivates the child to do that work. Knowledge of language, according to this model, exists at the intersection of use, content, and form‚Äîall are necessary for language to develop. Based on her findings that highly emotional babies are slower to learn language, Bloom theorized that babies learn best when they are able to focus on the environment, rather than on their own feelings. Bloom contributed two corpora in the CHILDES database. The Bloom70 corpus comprises recordings and transcripts she collected for her dissertation, and Bloom 73 consists of recordings of her daughter Allison as a child.  Selected articles  * Bloom, L.

It is notable for being the predecessor to synth pop band a-ha. The band released their debut album Fakkeltog in 1980. Their second album V√•kenatt was recorded within the following year, but not released until 2018. History Paul Waaktaar-Savoy and Magne Furuholmen both grew up in Manglerud, a suburb of Oslo, Norway. During fifth grade, Waaktaar, then a drummer, recruited Furuholmen as a guitarist and vocalist for his band. Waaktaar later learned to play the guitar and the band briefly changed their name to Spider Empire. After recruiting Viggo Bondi on bass guitar and Erik Hagelien on drums, the band started to record demos. Waaktaar later convinced Furuholmen to play keyboards on their new songs. The band played live several times during 1978 and 1979, including one notable concert where Morten Harket was in the audience. Harket would later go on to form a-ha with Waaktaar and Furuholmen. √òystein Jevanord replaced Hagelien on drums as the band went into the studio to record their debut album Fakkeltog. The band financed the recording and the publishing of the album, which was released in 1980. The band went into studio again and had finished their second album, V√•kenatt, by the summer of 1981. However, the mood within the band had deteriorated during the recording process, and the band played their last concert later that summer, without releasing their newly finished album. Waaktaar and Furuholmen planned to continue their musical careers in London, but Bondi and Jevanord declined, and Bridges split up.

Upon completion in March 2021, the tower will be the fourth tallest in Austin at 554 feet. It will be the largest office tower in Austin at 709,000 total square feet as well as the tallest, rising 38 feet higher than the predecessor Frost Bank Tower. Indeed Tower is made up of a 683,000-square-foot Class AA office tower with two rooftop terraces and ground floor retail, a historic 1914 post office re-positioned into a 25,000 square-foot retail and restaurant destination, and a 20,000 square-foot urban greenspace. There be will five levels of underground parking and 12 floors of above-ground parking as part of the structure.  History  Block 71 is a 1.75-acre downtown site owned by the University of Texas and bordered by West Seventh, Colorado, West Sixth and Lavaca Streets. It contains Claudia Taylor Johnson Hall, which was built as a post office in 1914, later named for President Lyndon B. Johnson's wife, and recently used as office space for the university. The nine-story Ashbel Smith Hall was constructed on the site in 1974 as administrative offices for the University of Texas System. Ashbel Smith Hall was replaced by a new office building at 210 West Seventh Street, and was then demolished in the largest implosion in Austin history on Mar 26, 2018. Beginning in 2015, the University of Texas sought plans from developers for a new office tower on the Block 71 site and decided on Trammell Crow Company. Trammell Crow and architect Page Southerland came up with a design for a new 36-story office tower and complex that integrates the historic Claudia Taylor Johnson Hall. The glass street-level design on the south side of the tower is intended to maximize views of the post office from all angles, with a large setback that doesn't obscure the original building. The two structures are connected through the post office's former loading dock on its eastern side, leading into the office tower's large open lobby. On May 17, 2018, Indeed announced that it had signed a lease to occupy the top 10 floors as part of its plan to hire an additional 3,000 employees in Austin. It was later announced that Indeed had purchased the naming rights to the building, giving it the official name of Indeed Tower instead of Block 71.

Einspruch translated Christian literature into Yiddish, Hebrew, Polish, Russian, and English. His most notable work was a translation of the Christian New Testament into Yiddish. Early life His father Mendel was a scholar, an iron merchant, and a Santser Hassid. His mother Mirl was the daughter of the cantor of the main synagogue in the city of Jaros≈Çaw. As a teenager, Einspruch was drawn to Christianity. Raised in a Yiddish-speaking home, he was a yeshiva student who studied under the rabbi of Barnov. Einspruch attended a Baron Hirsch School and the Tarn√≥w High School. Along with other Jewish socialists, Einspruch was active in the Poale Zion movement and helped organize a strike of clerks, tailors, and teachers at religious elementary schools. In 1909, at the age of 17, he made aliyah to Ottoman Palestine and worked at Merhavia, a moshav in Galilee. In 1911, he immigrated to the Khedivate of Egypt. After living in Egypt, he returned to Poland and converted to Christianity under the guidance of the Jewish-born Messianic missionary Khayem (Lucky) Yedidiah Pollak. By 1913, he had immigrated to the United States and lived in Cleveland and New York City, working at a restaurant and an iron factory. Moving to Chicago, he studied at McCormick Theological Seminary. He moved to Baltimore in 1920 and studied at Johns Hopkins University. Career as Christian missionary in 1923, Einspruch founded the Salem Hebrew Lutheran Mission in East Baltimore, located at the intersection of South Caroline and East Baltimore streets in Baltimore's historic Jewish quarter close to Corned Beef Row. The Salem Hebrew Lutheran Mission's church building has a Magen David above its entrance with the Greek letters iota eta sigma (IHS, a monogram for \\"Jesus Christ\\"). Einspruch founded Lederer Messianic Jewish Communications, which became the largest publisher of \\"Hebrew-Christian\\" literature in the world. On Shabbat, Einspruch was known to regularly stand on a soapbox in front of various Baltimore-area synagogues and deliver Christian sermons in the Yiddish language.

It is part of the Cascade Range. Skyscraper Mountain is situated northwest of the Sunrise Historic District, from which a four-mile hike leads to the mountain, mostly on the Wonderland Trail. However, the trail does not reach the summit, but it is still a walk up to the top from Skyscraper Pass. The summit provides views of Burroughs Mountain, Sluiskin Mountain, and Mount Rainier. Mount Fremont is its nearest higher peak, to the east. Access is limited by snowpack closing the Sunrise Road much of the year. July, August, and September are typically the months when the Sunrise Road is seasonally open for vehicle traffic. Precipitation runoff from Skyscraper Mountain drains into tributaries of the White River. History The descriptive name Skyscraper Mountain came from its supposed resemblance to a modern style of architecture according to Edmond S. Meany.Mount Rainier National Park Place Names. Gary Fuller Reese (author), 2009. The name was officially adopted in 1932 by the United States Board on Geographic Names. Climate Skyscraper Mountain Skyscraper Mountain is located in the marine west coast climate zone of western North America.Beckey, Fred W. Cascade Alpine Guide, Climbing and High Routes. Seattle, WA: Mountaineers Books, 2008. Most weather fronts originate in the Pacific Ocean, and travel northeast toward the Cascade Mountains. As fronts approach, they are forced upward by the peaks of the Cascade Range (Orographic lift), causing them to drop their moisture in the form of rain or snowfall onto the Cascades. As a result, the west side of the Cascades experiences high precipitation, especially during the winter months in the form of snowfall. During winter months, weather is usually cloudy, but, due to high pressure systems over the Pacific Ocean that intensify during summer months, there is often little or no cloud cover during the summer.

Born in Hungary, he went to Australia as a child refugee and grew up in Adelaide, where he played for a number of local clubs, including Adelaide Juventus, who paid an Australian record transfer fee for him. He was the first player from South Australia to represent the national team. Early life Born in Kecskem√©t, Hungary, on 24 July 1944, Herczeg was one of four children. His family fled the Soviet-occupied country in 1949, when he was 5 years old, and were amongst 20,000 displaced Hungarians who eventually went to Australia as refugees. After a spell at a migrant hostel in Woodside, South Australia, the family settled in Croydon Park, a suburb of Adelaide. Inspired by the success of his homeland's \\"Golden Team\\" during the 1950s, Herczeg preferred to play \\"real football\\" rather than take up the Australian rules version. Club career After playing for Orange-Sturt at junior level, Herczeg made his debut in senior soccer for Adelaide Budapest in 1960, aged 16. He spent a single season with Adelaide Croatia in 1963 before joining Adelaide Juventus for a then Australian record transfer fee of ¬£1,500. He later played for Adelaide Polonia and Port Adelaide. He ended his career with Croydon Park in amateur football, retiring in 1981. He later coached youth teams at Polonia, including his son Josh. International career Herczeg was called up to represent Australia in November 1965, for the 1966 World Cup qualifying matches against North Korea. As a part-time footballer, he had to arrange time off from his job with TNT to travel to the matches, which were played in Phnom Penh, Cambodia. He made his international debut in the second match against North Korea, a 3‚Äì1 defeat, becoming the first player from South Australia to represent the national team. Australia subsequently toured South East Asia and Herczeg made his second and final international appearance as a substitute in a friendly match against Taiwan. The match, played in Hong Kong, was a \\"spiteful and bruising encounter\\" that ended with Australia leaving the field under police escort while being pelted with bottles. In addition to his international career, Herczeg made fifteen appearances for South Australia in representative matches, scoring six goals. Playing style Herczeg was a quick player with a powerful left-foot shot who played either as a winger or a striker. Former teammate John Kundereri Moriarty described him as \\"a great team man\\" and \\"an excellent tactician\\", and praised his accuracy as a free kick taker. Personal life Outside of his part-time football career, Herczeg worked as a long-haul truck driver for TNT and later as a driver and forklift operator for Coopers Brewery and import firm Stonecraft. He was married to his first wife Margaret, a state-level ice skater, from 1965 to 1972 and had one son with her, Steve junior. He married his second wife Kristine, who was of Polish descent, in 1979 and had two more sons, Chris and Josh. Kristine died in 2015. Herczeg continued to speak fluent Hungarian but never returned to visit his birth country. Death Herczeg was admitted to The Queen Elizabeth Hospital in Adelaide on 19 September 2016 after a fall, and suffering from hallucinations and with a urinary tract infection. His condition was uncomplicated, but after his catheter tube was wrongly connected to an oxygen supply he died later that day in what the State Coroner described as \\"awful and macabre circumstances... his body filled much like a balloon\\". The death was ruled as \\"entirely preventable\\", with the coroner highly critical of the standard of medical care but unable to establish who was responsible for interfering with the equipment.

It is classified as an exceptional forest ecosystem. Location The Nabisipi River Old Forest is in the unorganized territory of Aguanish in Minganie Regional County Municipality of the C√¥te-Nord region. It is northeast of Havre-Saint-Pierre. It is to the northeast of Lake Watshishou. It is in the watershed of the Watshishou River. It is to the west of the Nabisipi River, from which it takes its name. The ground is mainly covered by undifferentiated glacial till of variable depth. The forest is administered by Quebec ªs Ministry of Natural Resources, Wildlife and Parks, Forest Environment Directorate. It was designated old-growth forest in 2005, and has IUCN management category III. A map of the ecological regions of Quebec shows the Nabisipi River Old Forest in the east spruce/moss subdomain. Flora The Nabisipi River Old Forest contains balsam fir (Abies balsamea) trees 200 years old, a remarkable age for this species, and black spruce (Picea mariana) trees up to 270 years old. It has not been seriously affected by natural disturbances such as fire, wind storms or outbreaks of insects, and avoided the hemlock looper (Lambdina fiscellaria) outbreak in the C√¥te-Nord region in 1998‚Äì2001. It has also not been disturbed by forestry or other human activities. The wet climate has helped produce a long cycle of more than 500 years between fires. This has allowed massive stands of balsam fire to become established and to grow to their high proportion of the forest trees. The mature old-growth forest includes very old, senescent trees and the greatly decomposed debris of tree trunks as large as any now living. Renewal occurs when small gaps are created by the fall of isolated trees or small groups of trees. The spruce and fir are roughly equal in numbers, and there are also some white spruce (Picea glauca) and paper birch (Betula papyrifera). The understory and regenerating areas contain the same trees as the canopy, as well as shadbush (Amelanchier) and alder (Alnus incana). Herbaceous cover is thin but very diverse, with the most common species being Canadian bunchberry (Cornus canadensis), creeping snowberry (Gaultheria hispidula) and mountain woodsorrel (Oxalis montana). Mosses cover much of the ground, particularly red-stemmed feathermoss (Pleurozium schreberi), knights plume moss (Ptilium crista-castrensis) and glittering woodmoss (Hylocomium splendens). Sphagnum covers the remaining space.

It was the exclusive radio broadcaster of the Kingdom of Italy.  History  = Establishment = On 8 February 1923, the Royal decree n. 1067 gave to the State the exclusive rights for the radio broadcasts to be exercised through a concessionaire company. In consequence, three companies were born in order to achieve the licence, all of them were related to American and British manufacturers of radio devices: * The \\"Societ√† italiana radio audizioni circolari\\" (SIRAC), founded by Riccardo Gualino and representative of RCA for Italy * The \\"Societ√† Anonima Radiofono - Societ√† italiana per le radiocomunicazioni circolari\\" (Radiofono), founded in September 1923 by Guglielmo Marconi through the British Marconi Company * The third competitor was engineer Luigi Ranieri, publisher of L'Araldo Telefonico and, accordingly to a provisional licence, the experimental Radio Araldo, formed after an agreement with Western Electric. Negotiations lasted more than a year, but Minister of Post Giovanni Antonio Colonna di Cesar√≤ seemed to want to give the licence to Ranieri. However, at the beginning of 1924, Di Cesar√≤ resigned from the government and he was replaced by Costanzo Ciano, who preferred Marconi. Ranieri succeed to achieve a technical test. On 20 March 1924, Radiofono installed a test station in the Centocelle district of Rome, but it failed to broadcast a speech of Benito Mussolini in the Costanzi theater on the next 23 March probably due to electric interferences. On 3 June 1924, Minister of Communications Costanzo Ciano addressed a letter to the companies who requested the licence, inviting them to find an agreement. A compromise was reached with the formation of a united company, without however the joining of Radio Araldo which did not have enough capital in order to take part to it. On 27 August 1924, the URI was founded by Radiofono and SIRAC through the subscription of a share capital of 1,400,000 lire (82.9% of Radiofono e 17.1% of SIRAC). Enrico Marches from FIAT was appointed as president, while Luigi Solari, close to Guglielmo Marconi, as deputy president. = Broadcasts = On 6 October 1924, at 9 pm, the first URI station of San Filippo in Rome, produced by Marconi, broadcast the first regular announcement read by Maria Luisa Boncompagni: Shortly after, Ines Viviani Donarelli, from the Roman station of Corrodi Palace, presented the first programme: The programme, lasted one hour and half, broadcast opera, chamber and classical music along with a weather report and news about the stock exchange. On 27 November 1924, the government gave to URI private company the exclusive licences of radio broadcasting for six years (extendable to other four), accordingly to an agreement signed on 27 November 1924 and the Royal Decree n. 2191 of 14 October 1924. With that decree, URI was considered as the only Italian radio broadcaster to be authorized to spread news of public interest and the government was the only to approve the news broadcasting from press agencies different from Agenzia Stefani, the official source as well as the first Italian press agency founded in 1853 by Camillo Benso, Count of Cavour. The URI announcer was Maria Luisa Boncompagni from L'Araldo Telefonico and Radio Araldo. On 18 January 1925, URI published the first issue of Radiorario, a weekly magazine which provided the broadcast schedules and publicized the new media to the public. The radio station of Rome was followed by the one of Milan (8 December 1925) and Naples (14 November 1926). In October 1926, adverts began to be broadcast and the advertising space was provided by Sipra. The radio broadcasting phenomena, initially hindered by prohibitive costs for a very poor Italy, took of in the thirties due to the initiatives promoted by the Fascist regime which gave to each casa del Fascio a radio device and promoted the spread of economical devices like Radiorurale and radio Balilla. According to the Royal Law Decree n. 2207 of 17 November 1927, URI became the Ente Italiano per le Audizioni Radiofoniche (EIAR) in January 1928.

It was made a minor basilica in 1960 by pope John XXIII History The church and an attached monastery were founded by an order of Carmelite monks, hence the name. The order became established in Padua by the late 13th-century, and we have the first documentation of a church at the site by 1212. The adjacent monastery was refurbished in 1295, and the church was rebuilt in 1335 under the design of Lorenzo da Bologna. It was consecrated as Santa Maria del Carmine in 1446. In 1491, an earthquake nearly razed the building, requiring reconstruction in 1494. The bare brick facade only gained partial marble facing in the 18th-century; formerly, the facade had an open loggia. The church structure suffered various damaging events over the centuries, including another earthquake collapsing the roof in 1696; a fire during festivities burned the cupola in 1800; and two aerial bombardments hit the church, in 1917 and 1944. Among the former parishioners of this church was the beatified Elisabetta Vendramini, who founded the order of Elisabethan sisters. Description of Exterior Three statues above the portal by Tommaso Bonazza. The main portal was competed in 1412, with statues by Bonazza added in 1736‚Äì1737. The piazza in front of the church has a statue of Petrarch. On the left flank of the church is a commemorative plaque dedicated to parishioners who died during the second world war. Description of Interior Interior The counterfacade has a canvas depicting the Annunciation by Dario Varotari the Younger. The water fonts at the entrance were sculpted by Giovanni Bonazza. The main altar has a detached fresco depicting the Virgin and child by Stefano Dall'Arzere. In 1576, while the bubonic plague afflicted the town, this venerated image was carried in procession through the city from its original location near the Palazzo del Capitanio to this church. The ebbing of the plague was attributed to the miraculous icon. Every February 2nd, during the Festa dei Lumini recalls this event. An 18th-century bas-relief depicts the Last Supper while the organ on the left depicts Stories of the Image of the Madonna of the Carmine by Battista Bissoni. The apse was richly decorated by Antonio Noale. The walls have large 17th-century canvases, depicting Saints of the Carmelite order and Stories of the Old Testament. A recent restoration of the central nave, revealed Renaissance frescoes depicting prophets and sybils. One of the chapels to the right of the entrance has the processional statue of the Madonna del Carmine, which is carried through the streets of the quarter, every July 16. Other works in the interior include: * Statue, third altar on right by Giovanni Bonazza; * Mother of Zebede before Christ, 6th altar on right by Padovanino; * Funeral monument of Tiberio Deciani, a Paduan lawyer, on the right pilaster of below the dome, sculpted by Francesco Segala, addossato al pilastro destro di sostegno della cupola. Funeral plaque of Ludovico Justachini The pavement is made from polychrome marble. The Polyptych of Lazarus by Francesco Squarcione, now in the Museo Civici of Padua, was originally in this church. Scuola del Carmine Giulio Campagnola frescoes dall'Arzere frescoes Adjacent to the basilica is a 15th-century cloister and a small prayer hall of the confraternity of the Carmine, known as the Scuola or Scuoletta del Carmine.

It premiered on 18 July 2019 and is a production of Pineapple Street Media and Gimlet Media. In 2009, April began to suspect her father of the 1980 murder of Tim Hack and Kelly Drew. Following her report to the police, Edwards was arrested and confessed to several other murders. He later became the subject of conspiracy theories accusing him of involvement in famous unsolved crimes. Featuring interviews from April and private recordings made by Edwards while he was living, The Clearing discusses April's journey to discover the truth about her father's life. Background In 1980, teenagers Tim Hack and Kelly Drew were murdered by Edward Wayne Edwards in Wisconsin. In 2009, Edwards's daughter April Balascio saw a new article about the murders and became suspicious that her father was involved; she called in a tip to the police. In 2010, Edwards (then 77 years old) was sentenced to life in prison for the murders. After his arrest, Edwards pled guilty to three more murders, including that of his foster son. Edwards died in prison in 2011. Several years after Edwards died, veteran journalist Josh Dean reached out to Balascio. Dean was investigating conspiracy theories which tied Edwards to the deaths of several other high- profile crime victims, such as JonBen√©t Ramsey and Laci Peterson. He knew that these conspiracies were untrue, but he suspected that Edwards was involved in other killings. April suspected her father of more murders and was frustrated with the media for focusing on famous cases instead of cases which she believed he actually could have committed. Balascio and Dean became friends and began to investigate her father's life and crimes. Episodes Reception The Guardian called The Clearing \\"an immense achievement\\", comparing it positively to shows such as Serial. The reviewer stated that Balascio's emotional articulacy provided the show with authenticity. It stated that the show is \\"not like the movies\\", focusing on the difficulties of solving cold cases in the face of police disinterest. The review praised the podcast's discussions of the mythologization of serial killers, as well as the trauma for family members of victims of unsolved murders. Some true crime podcasts have been accused of exploiting the families of crime victims for fame. However, a reviewer for Rolling Stone found that April Balascio's involvement with The Clearing's production elevated the show. The review also stated that The Clearing critiques other true crime podcasts by setting out to debunk rumors about Edwards, in contrast to shows which may promote theories not based on evidence. A reviewer in Vulture found that the use of Edwards's personal tapes helped to focus the show on Edwards as a human being, pushing past the \\"conventional elements of standard true-crime fare\\". The same reviewer wrote that The Clearing's dedication to fighting conspiracy theories is admirable, but that like all true crime stories it ran the risk of glorifying the violence it seeks to condemn. Notes Although Ed Edwards never legally adopted Dannie, Dannie changed his last name to Edwards and called him \\"dad\\".

First of all, Janus has two faces, which we interpreted as the duality of SM (one‚Äôs dominant and submissive sides). Second, he‚Äôs the Roman god of portals, and more importantly, of beginnings and endings. To us, it represents the beginning of one‚Äôs acceptance of self, the beginning of freedom from guilt, and the eventual ending of self-loathing and fear over one‚Äôs SM desires.

Description Route 1856 follows the south bank of the San Juan River on the Costa Rica side, covering completely the northern border of the Heredia province with the eastern segment starting west of Boca San Carlos in Alajuela province. History The route number designation corresponds to the year 1856, when the Battle of Santa Rosa and Second Battle of Rivas took place and stopped the advances of the filibusters going from Nicaragua to Costa Rica during the Filibuster War. The name alludes to the president at that moment, Juan Rafael Mora Porras. The route was created due to the Costa Rica‚ÄìNicaragua San Juan River border dispute between 2010 and 2015, and it is an officially designated national road, it was deemed a strategic necessity and granted emergency status by presidential decree, because the border dispute put in jeopardy the access of the river by Costa Rica citizens who made daily use of the water body for transportation. Construction started in 2011, with a projected cost of CRC ‚Ç°7,000 million, but as of 2019 the accumulated cost has been of up to CRC ‚Ç°30,000 million. Its construction and political origins were highly controversial and surrounded by corruption issues with 26 indicted individuals, no design or environmental plans were made at all, not even a topographic survey, several of the bridges used old containers instead of proper concrete culverts, and tree trunks as bridges. The road has not been finished, but an inaugural act on the segment between F√°tima and Delta Costa Rica took place on February 17, 2012. Due to the fiscal crisis of the latter half of the 2010s in Costa Rica, it is currently abandoned as of April 2019 and there are no active plans to continue its construction, meanwhile the government tries to allocate the required funds.

Background During the war in Bosnia, Konjic was an important strategic location due to a railway line which passed through Konjic from Ploƒçe, Croatia to central Bosnia, and the M17 highway, located between Mostar and Sarajevo which consisted of many tunnels and bridges, while the municipality also served as an important line of communication from Sarajevo to many other parts of the state in addition to constituting a supply line for Bosnian troops. By mid-April 1992, Serb forces had effectively surrounded Konjic, setting up checkpoints at Bradina to the north, thus controlling the Mount Ivan saddle pass on the M17 road to Sarajevo and also blocking the highway to Mostar from the village of Donje Selo to the west. The Bosnian Territorial Defence Forces (TO) and Croatian Defence Council (HVO) at that time had a common interest in uniting against Serb forces and launched a joint military operation on May 20, 1992, primarily intended to de-block routes to Sarajevo and Mostar after apparent negotiations with Serb leadership failed. Operations and killings The village of Bradina was shelled on May 25, 1992, and soldiers in both camouflage and black uniforms appeared, firing their weapons and setting fires to buildings. The local Orthodox church and the village itself was burned to the ground. 48 Serb civilians were killed during the assault. As many as 54 victims are thought to have been killed in three day offensive, during which the perpetrators also dumped 26 of the bodies inside a pit in front of the Orthodox church. Witnesses reported cases in which Muslim fighters forced Serb men to kneel and say Allahu Akbar (God is great) before executing them. Prior to the Bradina offensive, joint Bosnian Territorial Defense and Croatian Defence Council forces also targeted the surrounding villages of Donje Selo, Cerici, Bjelovcina and Brdani. Many of the men were taken to the ƒåelebiƒái camp and Musala camp in Konjic. Most of the women and children in Bradina were incarcerated at a local elementary school where they were reportedly mistreated. Approximately 3,000 Serb civilians from Bradina and at least five other villages were also held in a dark railroad tunnel for several days without food or water. Arrests and trial On December 4, 2017, the State Investigation and Protection Agency of Bosnia arrested 13 men suspected in taking part in a widespread and systematic attack on the local Bosnian Serb community in the spring and summer of 1992 aimed at expelling them from Konjic, Bradina and surrounding villages. 14 men who held command positions in the Bosnian and Croat forces as well as local police went on trial, charged with the murders, detentions, rape, torture and mistreatment of the Serb population in Konjic, as well as burning their property and the local Orthodox church.

It takes its name from Max Kaluza, who made an influential observation on the metrical characteristics of unstressed syllables in Beowulf.Max Kaluza, 'Zur Betonungs- und Verslehre des Altenglischen', in Festschrift zum. Siebzigsten Geburtstage Oskar Schade (K√∂nigsberg: Hartung, 1896), pp. 101-33. His insight was developed further in particular by Alan BlissThe Metre of Beowulf (Oxford: Blackwell, 1958), ¬ß¬ß34‚Äì7 and 118‚Äì21. and R. D. Fulk.R. D. Fulk, A History of Old English Meter (Philadelphia: University of Pennsylvania Press, 1992), ¬ß¬ß170‚Äì83 and ¬ß¬ß376‚Äì8. The name 'Kaluza's law' itself appears to have been bestowed by Fulk.Eric Weiskott, 'A Semantic Replacement for Kaluza's Law in Beowulf', English Studies, 93.8 (2012), 891-96 (fn. 1) . The significance of Kaluza's observations for the dating of Beowulf has been extensively debated. The law Like other Old Germanic alliterative verse, the metre of Beowulf exhibits the phenomenon of resolution, whereby, under certain conditions, two syllables count as one for metrical purposes. These conditions are: # The first of the two syllables must be stressed and the second unstressed. # The vowel (or diphthong) of the stressed syllable must be short. # The stressed syllable must be followed by only one consonant... # ... and then by an unstressed vowel that is part of the same word. # If the syllable before the stressed syllable in question was itself heavily stressed, resolution might not take place. Kaluza's observations suggested that Beowulf exhibits a further constraint on condition 5, concerning the unstressed syllable in the pair of syllables that are to resolve. When the two potentially resolving syllables immediately follow a stressed syllable, resolution does not happen if: # The unstressed syllable ends in a consonant; and/or # The vowel of the unstressed syllable is reconstructed as having been long in the earliest stages of Old English. Thus in lines categorised in Sievers' theory of Anglo- Saxon meter as A2a, such as Beowulf line 222a ('brimclifu blƒ´can') or 1171a ('goldwine gumena'), the second and third syllables (in these examples '-clifu' and '-wine' respectively) resolve, and in these cases they consistently end in an etymologically short vowel, with no consonant. (These are sometimes known as 'Kaluza Type I verses' and there are sixty-two examples in the poem.) Yet in lines of type D2 and D*2, such as Beowulf line 2042a ('eald √¶scwiga') or 2912b ('feorh cyninges') the potentially resolving syllables (in these examples '-wiga' and 'cynin-') follow a stressed syllable (in these examples '√¶sc-' and 'feorh') and might in theory resolve. If they did, however, the line would contain only three syllables, too few to meet the four-syllable minimum requirement of Old English alliterative metre. In such verses in Beowulf, the unstressed syllable consistently includes a consonant and/or has an etymologically long vowel. (These are sometimes known as 'Kaluza Type II verses' and there are forty-four examples in the poem.) R. D. Fulk developed Kaluza's observations to argue that they show that at the time when Beowulf was composed, poetic varieties of Old English still distinguished between long and short vowels in unstressed syllables. There is no precise evidence for when these distinctions were lost, but there is a range of evidence for other kinds of unstressed vowel reduction in the history of Old English. This evidence suggests that vowel-length distinctions in unstressed vowels could not have persisted beyond c. 725 in Mercian Old English or c. 825 in Northumbrian Old English. This implies a relatively early date for Beowulf. No other Old English poem coheres to Kaluza's law to any significant degree. Alternative explanations Most linguists who have considered Kaluza's law hold that the patterns in Beowulf reflect a phonological constraint in early Old English poetic metre. However, several scholars have argued that the appearance of Kaluza's law patterns in Beowulf specifically may not reflect the continued distinction between long and short vowels in unstressed syllables at the time of Beowulf's composition, but a residual conformity to older patterns arising from any of a range of postulated factors.Leonard Neidorf and Rafael J. Pascual, 'The Language of Beowulf and the Conditioning of Kaluza‚Äôs Law', Neophilologus, 98.4 (2014), 657‚Äì73 (pp. 659-60); . * Knowledge that certain inflexions were appropriate to Kaluza Type I verses and others to Type II verses. * The poem's extensive deployment of traditional poetic formulae, which may have led to the retention of verse patterns conforming to Kaluza's law after the language had changed. * A tendency of words suitable for Kaluza Type I verses to denote different kinds of things from words suitable for Kaluza Type II verses. Leonard Neidorf and Rafael J. Pascual contend that these alternative explanations are weaker than the phonological explanation preferred by Kaluza and Fulk.Leonard Neidorf and Rafael J.

After his senior year, he was drafted by the Minnesota Twins in the 39th round of the 2015 Major League Baseball (MLB) draft. Tillo chose to honor his commitment to Kentucky, and not sign with the Twins. In 2016, his freshman year, he pitched only innings. Following the year, he transferred to Iowa Western Community College in order to be closer to home and to transition back into a starting pitcher. In 2018, his sophomore year and first year at Iowa Western, he went 5-1 with a 2.86 ERA, striking out 57 over 44 innings and nine games (five starts).

The series follows the life of Jeffree Star, the founder and CEO of Jeffree Star Cosmetics. The series also follows Dawson and Star as they plan and design a new makeup and merchandise collection called The Conspiracy Collection. The series ran for seven episodes, premiering on October 1, 2019, and ending on November 22; and an extra episode that showed bloopers and deleted scenes was released on January 21, 2020. The series, excluding the trailer, has garnered over 130 million views. Production of the series began in January 2019 and continued after the airing of the second-to-last episode, \\"The Conspiracy Collection Reveal\\". The series is the second season of The Secret World of Jeffree Star and follows a similar format. The series' trailer was released on Dawson's YouTube channel on September 24 and garnered more than 10 million views in the first week of its release. The series premiered on Dawson's YouTube channel on October 1, 2019. On October 15, Dawson's online merchandise store was launched; it was sold out in under thirty minutes and accrued over half a million dollars in sales. Reception of The Beautiful World of Jeffree Star varied throughout the series but was generally mixed. Dawson's hesitance to include a past controversy concerning James Charles and Tati Westbrook resulted in criticism; Dawson included the events in the finale of the series. Before the finale, reporters criticized the series for focusing too much on The Conspiracy Collection and compared the series' influence to that of Dawson's past works, such as The Mind of Jake Paul and The Truth about TanaCon. The Conspiracy Collection, the main focus of the series, was highly successful after its launch on November 1, 2019; according to Star it set multiple records for the beauty industry and Jeffree Star Cosmetics. Dawson's and Star's collaborative eye shadow palette received a positive reception and the collection sold out immediately after technical issues were resolved. Some palettes were contaminated with ribbon fibers, resulting in criticism. In July 2020 4 episodes from the series were blocked following a copyright claim by Sony ATV Publishing.

Episodes   Background  Jeffree Star, the owner of Jeffree Star Cosmetics, is the main focus of Dawson's first documentary series, The Secret World of Jeffree Star, during which Dawson and Star discuss ideas for a collaboration. Star announced The Beautiful World of Jeffree Star in December 2018, saying the series is one \\"that's never been done before\\". Star also owns Killer Merch, a clothing manufacturing company. The merchandise store sells hoodies, phone cases, pig-shaped backpacks, hats, joggers, sandals, and t-shirts. In the second episode, \\"The Secrets of the Beauty World\\", Star and Dawson discuss the shares of the collection's profits that Star, Dawson, and other contributors would be receiving. During the episode, Star comments about NikkieTutorials' collaboration with Est√©e Lauder's Too Faced Cosmetics. Anonymous sources claimed Nikkie only made from the collaboration that made a profit of at least . According to Nikkie, she was \\"naive\\" for signing the contract with Too Faced. About two weeks after the publication of the sixth episode, Dawson commented about the production of the second episode, stating, \\"Sorry it's taken a while but we just needed some time to figure out how to end it right and give u guys everything we promised\\". In 2019, James Charles was involved in a controversy with Tati Westbrook about her \\"BYE SISTER...\\" video that accused James Charles of predatory behavior and sexual harassment of a straight man. Charles responded with a video called \\"tati\\" and later \\"No More Lies\\", which explained how the situation occurred and refuted many of Westbrook's claims. The \\"No More Lies\\" video said Jeffree Star harassed and threatened Charles through iMessage, and Charles' brother through Twitter. Star deleted his tweets and apologized, and Charles lost three million subscribers in May 2019. Dawson provided more information about the finale using Instagram's live streaming feature, expressing concern about the footage containing reactions to Charles' quarrel and doubt he would be able to include the footage in the finale. He stated there was no new information about the quarrel and that publishing the footage would hinder people from moving on from it. Dawson stated the series was originally going to have nine parts, with three episodes dedicated to the quarrel, which he regretted including in the series' trailer. After constant complaints from fans, however, Dawson eventually covered Charles' and Westbrook's falling out.  Production  The trailer for the series was released on September 24, 2019; it includes footage of Dawson and Star and of Dawson reacting to Charles' controversy with Tati Westbrook. Some viewers expressed concern about the inclusion of Charles' controversy in the series. The trailer did not include additional information about the series and received a positive reception. Before the sixth episode \\"The Conspiracy Collection Reveal\\" premiered, Star announced filming by Siwicki was still occurring. Star also said of the launch week, \\"[t]his week will be one of the most insane weeks of our lives\\". Star stated that filming of the series began in January 2019. Music is a major part of the series so Dawson created a Spotify playlist that included all of the songs used during the series. Notable artists such as Catie Turner, Hoodie Allen, and Ricky Montgomery had multiple songs featured throughout the series. \\"Time of the Season\\" by The Ben Taylor Band served as the theme song of the series. On January 7, 2020, Dawson announced the planned to make a final episode of the series that featured bloopers and deleted scenes from the first seven episodes. On January 21, 2020, Dawson released the extra episode on his secondary makeup channel, \\"ShaneGlossin\\". This episode includes footage of an attempted break-in of Dawson's house. The scene also includes the arrival of police and the intruder's arrest.  The Conspiracy Collection  After the publication of most of the episodes of The Beautiful World of Jeffree Star, its viewers anticipated the launch of The Conspiracy Collection. According to Star in the fourth episode of the series, Dawson could have earned from the deal. The collection consists of liquid lipsticks, mirrors, an eye shadow palette, lip gloss, makeup bags and lip balm. Prices of The Conspiracy Collection ranged from to . Soon after its launch, all of the products sold out. A partial restock occurred on November 8, 2019, and all other products were restocked on Black Friday. On November 1, 2019, at 10 a.m. PST, Morphe stores, online makeup stores and retailers, and Star's website started selling The Conspiracy Collection. Almost immediately, Shopify, the company that hosts Star's website, crashed due to high levels of traffic. Morphe and other smaller beauty sites sold out within fifteen minutes. An hour after the launch, there were still two and a half million people waiting in the queue for Star's website. Initial reactions to the launch were mixed; at stores, some stated that they had difficulty, while others were successful in getting the collection‚Äîhowever, most reacted negatively to the website crashing. Some stores claimed to have sold out of products before the official launch. A few hours after the launch, Star's website was back online and customers could complete their purchases. Within three hours the collection had sold out. During the launch of The Conspiracy Collection, the hashtag \\"#ShaneDawsonxJeffreeStar\\" started trending on Twitter and became the most- trending topic for several hours. Other hashtags and mentions, such as \\"#ConspiracyPallete\\", \\"#ConspiracyCollection\\", and \\"Morphe\\", also began trending but never reached number one. A pre-order for the restocked collection contained 60,000 \\"Mini Controversy\\" and \\"Conspiracy\\" eye shadow palettes, and the pre-order also sold out. Star said the entire collection would be restocked in early 2020. On November 10, 2019, Star released a video announcing the collection had broken several records. Six days after the collection's launch, over one million eye shadow palettes had been sold. Star also said the launch was the biggest e-commerce launch in the history of the internet. During the finale of the series, Star said The Conspiracy Collection set a record for most Morphe sales and that the Mini Controversy palette would change for the March and May 2020 restocks. An untitled green shade shown in the series was replaced with other shades. After fans pleaded on social media for the shade to be replaced, Dawson and Star relented, substituting \\"Cry On My Couch\\" with the new shade, titled \\"Put it Back!\\". Star also discussed a packaging revamp for the Mini Controversy palette. However, due to the COVID-19 pandemic, the restocks were delayed until June 20, 2020. = Ribbon fibers issue = After the launch of The Conspiracy Collection, some customers who bought the palette complained on social media it contained tiny hairs or fibers. An investigation found the foreign inclusions came from \\"the cut ribbon sheets that were pressed into the product\\". Star stated the company would no longer use scissor-cut ribbon and that they would start using a black light to identify fibers. He and his team \\"have sent out new palettes and [have] also given a full refund\\" to everyone who received a bad palette. Star stated on his Instagram Stories only thirty-five of the more-than-one million palettes produced were affected by this mistake, which had been resolved.  Reception  The Beautiful World of Jeffree Star had a mixed reception from fans, which varied during the course of the series' publication. The eponymous first episode of the series was relatively uncontroversial; fans praised it for \\"feeling like a movie\\" and including Star's and Dawson's discussions about personal insecurities. Commentators criticized the first six episodes; most fans thought that the series should focus less on The Conspiracy Collection and more on the arguments shown in the trailer for the series. Alex Casey and Jihee Junn, writing for The Spinoff, criticized the series for focusing too much on Jeffree Star Cosmetics rather than the makeup industry as a whole, and also criticized the series' cinematography for being disorienting. They considered it \\"the smartest advertising campaign of the influencer age\\" and praised the series for covering the business of the makeup world in detail. Casey added, \\"I have never seen anything that better untangles, re-tangles and then sets on fire the ... rat king of money, power, influence and eyeshadow at this particular point in time in the hell world, whether they are doing it consciously or not\\". Initially, critics considered the series to be an advertisement for The Conspiracy Collection and reporters had mixed reactions to it. In an article about Star, Scaachi Koul of BuzzFeed News stated the producers \\"used [the series] as an opportunity to promote a new 'Conspiracy Collection' makeup collaboration to their vast combined audience\\". Koul hailed the collection for being \\"a resounding, almost preposterous success\\". Koul mentioned a Killer Merch collection with Dawson that also sold and said the collection would have been successful without The Beautiful World of Jeffree Star. Brittney Rigby, writing for the Australian news website Mumbrella, considered the advertisement-like nature of the series to be positive. Rigby praised Dawson and Star for The Conspiracy Collection, and considered the advertisements for the collection and the series itself to be \\"an overwhelming success\\". Rigby states; \\"The series is a story, but also a very long ad for Jeffree Star Cosmetics and Dawson's own make-up collection and merch. Yet it doesn't feel like an ad at all.\\" She said the fanbase of Star and Dawson is one that \\"brands can only dream of\\". Julia Alexander, writing for The Verge, initially perceived the series to be one that follows Star's personal issues and makeup line, and one that discusses the Westbrook-Charles spat. She also noted there was wide anticipation for the new series as there had been for The Mind of Jake Paul, The Return of Eugenia Cooney, and The Truth about TanaCon; Alexander stated the reason for such anticipation was that Dawson provides \\"insider access\\" into the documentaries. In a later review, Alexander discussed The Conspiracy Collection and James Charles' collaboration with Morphe Cosmetics. She noted the criticism of Charles' palette and compared the palette's price ranges and revenue, and notes that \\"regardless of who wins this season's palette battle ... Morphe gets a slice\\". Alexander also commented on the changed nature of the series: \\"Dawson's documentary was supposed to be about Star, ... but it turned into a six-hour-long sales pitch for their new palette\\". She also noted some viewers thought Dawson was \\"hopping on a popular YouTube trend to make a quick buck\\" but she considered the series to be \\"structured to fight\\" those thoughts. Virginia Glaze of Dexerto said the exclusion of the Westbrook-Charles squabble was \\"for the better\\". Zooey Norman, writing for Screen Rant, considers it the seventh-best series created by Dawson for venturing into the \\"business aspect of the makeup world\\"; Norman considers Conspiracy Series with Shane Dawson to be his best. The first episode was highlighted in YouTube Rewind 2019: For the Record as the second-most liked beauty video behind Charles' \\"Makeup Tutorial en Espa√±ol\\". Most episodes of The Beautiful World of Jeffree Star reached the number-one spot on YouTube's trending page when published.

Ada Street in the West Town neighborhood of Chicago, Illinois. It was built in 1884 to serve the growing neighborhood, as an influx of immigrants and Illinois' 1883 Compulsory Education Law had greatly increased its student population. John J. Flanders, who became chief architect of the Chicago Board of Education in 1884, designed the school according to a standardized plan which was used throughout the city. The Renaissance Revival school has an asymmetrical layout and includes several small side entrances, ornamental brickwork on its chimneys, and a metal cornice. Flanders' design was a stark change from the symmetrical Italianate plans of earlier Chicago public schools. The district's student population continued to increase in the following decades, and the Board of Education built an addition onto the school in 1898 as a result. The school operated continuously until closing in 2013. The building was added to the National Register of Historic Places on September 5, 2017.

The book provides a list of 100 potential solutions and ranks them by the potential amount of greenhouse gases each could cut, with cost estimates and short descriptions. The Guardian notes that the author has had influence in corporate sustainability efforts and that companies such as Interface and Autodesk have backed the project. It was intended that the book be supplemented with an online database, Project Drawdown, which was to compile the numerous types of solutions.  Reception  Drawdown has been a New York Times bestseller and has received favorable reviews. For example, Kirkus Reviews called the book \\"an optimistic program for getting out of our current mess\\".

The film features Dhanush, Aishwarya Lekshmi and James Cosmo in lead roles, while Joju George and Kalaiyarasan portray supporting roles. The film, which has music composed by Santhosh Narayanan, began production in London during September 2019. The film's dubbed Telugu version has been titled Jagame Tantram.https://twitter.com/StudiosYNot/status/1230176554270912512?s=20  Cast  *Dhanush as Suruli *Aishwarya Lekshmi *James Cosmo *Joju George *Kalaiyarasan *Soundararaja *Deepak Paramesh *Devan *Vadivukkarasi *Chinni Jayanth *Ramachandran Durairaj *Roman Fiori *Muthukumar *Sanchana Natarajan *Ashwanth Ashokkumar  Production  In April 2016, director Karthik Subbaraj announced that he would make a film starring Dhanush in the lead role. The gangster film was initially set in New York, and the makers unsuccessfully approached Hollywood actors Morgan Freeman, Robert De Niro and Al Pacino about playing a key role in the film during late 2016. Subbaraj later lamented that the process of reaching out to the actors was difficult, and that it was often difficult to get past casting agents. However, the film was delayed after the producers, Thenandal Studio Limited, opted to prioritise the making of other big-budget films such as Mersal (2017) and Sangamithra. The production house later ran into financial problems and exited the project. In February 2018, the project's production was taken up by Y NOT Studios. After the actor and director had finished their other ventures, the film was officially relaunched in August 2019, with the shoot beginning in London during September 2019. James Cosmo was signed on to play a foreign character, while several other cast members including Aishwarya Lekshmi, Joju George, Kalaiyarasan and Roman Fiori worked in the London schedule. By mid-September 2019, twenty days of the film had been shot. Filming started in September in Faversham, Kent a village in the south-east of England. The crew filmed for about a week before they set off for their next location.  Soundtrack  The film's soundtrack is composed by Santhosh Narayanan, with lyrics are written by Vivek, Dhanush, and Anthony Daasan. The theme music which was featured in the film's motion poster, received positive response from fans, and the makers decided to release the song as a single. While the album was originally slated to release under the record label YNOT Music, the subsidiary of the production house YNOT Studios, the film's audio rights were acquired by Sony Music in mid-July 2020. The first single track \\"Rakita Rakita Rakita\\" was released on 28 July 2020, coinciding with Dhanush's birthday.  Marketing  The film's title refers to the song \\"Sambo Siva Sambo\\", written by Kannadasan, from the 1979 film Ninaithale Inikkum, starring Kamal Haasan and Rajinikanth.  Release  Jagame Thandhiram was scheduled to release on 1 May 2020, but has since been indefinitely delayed due to the COVID-19 pandemic.

The most common application of the concept was to embed precious stones within open-backed jewelry.

The club was founded in early 1921 and competed in the first and second tier leagues of the Victorian state soccer system throughout its existence, until dissolving at the conclusion of the 1936 season. The club is known for winning the 1931 state championship, then known as the 'Metropolitan League Division One' Off the field, little is known about the club itself, with the club's home venue and playing colors remaining a mystery. This club appears to have had no link to the Brunswick Soccer Club that competed only in the 1915 tier two season, and no connection to the other Brunswick named soccer clubs that would follow. The 1930s saw multiple football clubs dissolve in the state of Victoria with Brunswick folding in 1936. Fellow tier one champions St Kilda, Windsor and Melbourne Thistle all folded in the mid-1930s, at a time of economic stress resulting from the Great Depression in Australia. Brunswick's first competitive game was played on 7 May 1921 and resulted in a 2-0 win against the St Kilda reserves team which played in the Second Division for that season. Brunswick went on to win the Victorian Second Division at its first attempt in 1921 and attain promotion to First Division. On 27 June 1936 Brunswick played its last game defeating Box Hill 2-1 in the final round of the Victorian Second tier league, then known as 'Metropolitan League Division Two'.

It flows into the Gulf of Saint Lawrence Location The Nabisipi River rises in Lake Saumur. It flows for to the Gulf of Saint Lawrence west of Aguanish. The river drains an area of . It lies between the basins of the Pashashibou River to the west and the Aguanish River to the east. It crosses the Canadian Shield, and has many rapids. At first it flows through the unorganized territory of Lac-J√©r√¥me. The mouth of the river is in the municipality of Aguanish in the Minganie Regional County Municipality. The name in the Innu language means \\"man's river\\". Description The Dictionnaire des rivi√®res et lacs de la province de Qu√©bec (1914) says, Fishing The river has always been fished by the aboriginal people. Huard (1897: 349) wrote of the Nabisipi River, \\"It was about 1855 that the Rochette families settled there, after the Hudson's Bay Company had abandoned the salmon fishing station it had on the little Nabisipi River ... in the latter years [before 1897] the whole of the Nabisippians embarked to seek fortune under a more favorable sky.\\" In the 1960s there was a research station on its banks. There is an old fish ladder that the salmon still use. The Nabisipi Outfitter, co-managed by the Innu, protects the resource, and encourages catch and release of all salmon. Atlantic salmon typically do not return to the river until July. The last of the river has five pits that can be used for sport fishing by boat or wading. The average catch weighs . As of 2019 the Nabisipi UenapeuHipu outfitters, based at the mouth of the river, arranged for salmon fishing trips with guides and a cook. In May 2015 the Ministry of Forests, Wildlife and Parks of Quebec announced a sport fishing catch-and- release program for large salmon on sixteen of Quebec's 118 salmon rivers. These were the Mitis, Laval, Pigou, Bouleau, Aux Rochers, Jupitagon, Magpie, Saint-Jean, Corneille, Piashti, Watshishou, Little Watshishou, Nabisipi, Aguanish and Natashquan rivers. The Quebec Atlantic Salmon Federation said that the measures did not go nearly far enough in protecting salmon for future generations. In view of the rapidly declining Atlantic salmon population catch-and-release should have been implemented on all rivers apart from northern Quebec.

The season premiered on September 26, 2019, and consisted of 14 episodes. The season is produced by Fremulon, 3 Arts Entertainment, and Universal Television. The series focuses on Eleanor Shellstrop (Kristen Bell), a deceased young woman who wakes up in the afterlife and is welcomed by Michael (Ted Danson) to \\"the Good Place\\" in reward for her righteous life; however, she eventually discovers that Michael's \\"Good Place\\" is a hoax, and she is actually in the \\"Bad Place\\", to be psychologically and emotionally tortured by her fellow afterlife residents. Eleanor and Michael claim that \\"the points system\\" for assigning humans to the Good Place or Bad Place is fundamentally flawed; in the real world, assigning a certain action as categorically Good or Bad is practically impossible due to unintended consequences. In the fourth season, they are given a chance to prove their hypothesis. They design an experiment meant to demonstrate that humans in a simulated Good Place can show moral development. One of the experiment subjects is Eleanor's boyfriend, Chidi (William Jackson Harper), who has volunteered to have his memory erased to preserve the integrity of the experiment. Jameela Jamil, Manny Jacinto, and D'Arcy Carden also star as Eleanor and Michael's friends and collaborators in the experiment. Each of the episodes is listed as \\"Chapter (xx)\\" following the opening title card; the final episode is listed as \\"The Final Chapter\\". Cast =Main= Kristen Bell portrays series protagonist Eleanor Shellstrop and directed episode eight. * Kristen Bell as Eleanor Shellstrop, a deceased, selfish saleswoman from Phoenix, Arizona. She pretends to be the architect of the Good Place after Michael becomes overwhelmed and has a panic attack. * William Jackson Harper as Chidi Anagonye, a deceased professor of ethics and moral philosophy from Senegal. After having his memories of the afterlife erased, Chidi serves as one of the human participants in the team's experiment. * Jameela Jamil as Tahani Al-Jamil, a deceased, wealthy English philanthropist who believes she belongs in the Good Place. She forms an unlikely friendship with Eleanor, who initially dislikes her positive attitude, condescending way of speaking, and tendency to name drop. * D'Arcy Carden as Janet, a programmed guide and knowledge bank who acts as the Good Place's main source of information and can provide its residents with whatever they desire. Later, Janet gains a more humanlike disposition, and begins to act differently from the way she was designed. Carden also plays various versions of Janet: ** Bad Janet, a disrespectful version designed not to respond to residents properly. She pretended to be Good Janet after the real Good Janet was kidnapped until Jason saw through the deception. She is released by Michael and is given a manifesto about the experiment. ** Neutral Janet, an emotionless Janet who works in the neutral zone between the Good Place and the Bad Place. ** Disco Janet. According to Michael, she was \\"fun, but a lot\\". * Manny Jacinto as Jason Mendoza, a deceased amateur DJ and drug dealer from Jacksonville, Florida who winds up in the Good Place by mistake. He is introduced as Jianyu Li, a Taiwanese monk who took a vow of silence. Later, Jason proves to be an immature and unintelligent, but kindhearted Jacksonville Jaguars and Blake Bortles fan. * Ted Danson as Michael, an architect who runs the Good Place neighborhood in which Eleanor, Chidi, Tahani, and Jason reside. Michael has a deep affinity for the mundane aspects of human life, like playing with paper clips or searching for one's car keys. \\"Michael\\" is a Hebrew name meaning \\"who is like God?\\" =Recurring= * Marc Evan Jackson as Shawn, Michael's wicked boss. Shawn gives Michael two chances to pull off the torture experiment, and later turns against him when he finds out about Michael's betrayal. * Maya Rudolph as the eternal Judge who rules on interdimensional matters between the Good Place and the Bad Place. * Kirby Howell-Baptiste as Simone Garnett, an Australian neuroscientist and, briefly, Chidi's girlfriend. She dies and becomes the experimental Good Place's second test subject, complicating the test and causing the erasure of Chidi's memories. When she arrives, she is in complete denial of her surroundings, believing them to be hallucinations of her dying brain. * Tiya Sircar as Vicky, a Bad Place demon who is introduced as the \\"real Eleanor Shellstrop\\" in the first attempt of Michael's torture plan. Though Shawn subsequently encased her in a cocoon as a punishment, she was shown at the end of season 3 and beginning of season 4 to be wearing a body suit which made her identical in appearance to Michael. Shawn created the suit to enable the demons to torment the four humans upon the seemingly inevitable failure of the new experiment. She is later exploded into goo while posing as Michael during a ceremony to celebrate the skinsuits, but is bought back to redeem herself for a new experiment. Vicky later becomes in charge of the rehabilitation Bad Place. * Maribeth Monroe as Mindy St. Claire, a deceased corporate lawyer and cocaine addict who just barely toed the line of earning enough Good Place points before her death and thus was awarded her own private Medium Place. When Derek was sent to her during season 3, she rebooted him repeatedly, which made him smarter, more sophisticated and refined. * Jason Mantzoukas as Derek, a wacky artificial rebound boyfriend created by Janet who was later sent to Mindy St. Claire. Through subsequent and repeated reboots, he is shown to be evolved in his capacities, intelligence, and refinement. * Luke Guldan as Chris, a muscular Bad Place demon who is sent by Shawn to thwart Michael's experiment by posing as Linda Johansson (Rachel Winfree), a sweet, but boring, old lady from Norway. * Brandon Scott Jones as John Wheaton, the first test subject sent to the experimental Good Place. In life, he was a gossip columnist, and especially published trashy articles about Tahani. * Benjamin Koldyke as Brent Norwalk, the fourth test subject sent to the experimental Good Place, a privileged and entitled chauvinist. * Jama Williamson as Val, Shawn's secretary. * Bambadjan Bamba as Bambadjan, an underling for the Bad Place. * Josh Siegal as Glenn, an underling for the Bad Place, who later became a traitor after realizing how good humans are. He is exploded into goo by Bad Janet (who was posing as Good Janet). * Brad Morris as Matt, a suicidal accountant who works in a neutral office between the Good Place and the Bad Place. He is assigned as the accountant for Eleanor and Michael's experiment. * Joe Mande as the voice of Toddrick Hemple, a lava monster who refuses to wear a human suit. * Paul Scheer as Chuck, a member of the Good Place committee. =Guest= * Timothy Olyphant as himself, dressed as his Justified character Raylan Givens, who is conjured up by Janet for the Judge. * Lisa Kudrow as Hypatia / \\"Patty\\", one of the residents of the Good Place. * Nick Offerman as himself, teaching Tahani woodworking. * Mary Steenburgen as Michael's guitar teacher. Steenburgen is also the real-life wife of Ted Danson, who plays Michael. * Pamela Hieronymi as herself, attending a philosophy class held by Chidi. Hieronymi was also a philosophical advisor to the show. * Todd May as himself, attending a philosophy class held by Chidi. May was also a philosophical advisor to the show. * Mitch Narito as Donkey Doug, Jason's dopey father. * Eugene Cordero as Steven \\"Pillboi\\" Peleaz, Jason's best friend and partner in crime. * Angela Trimbur as Madison, Eleanor's roommate. * Meryl Hathaway as Brittany, Eleanor's roommate.

Plot A man (Cantinflas) who works as a window cleaner in the city is eventually presented with the opportunity to clean the windows of a famous French actress, Lulu Duval (Christiane Martel), who is starring in a musical revue in an important theater. The actress's agent Juli√°n (Alejandro Ciangherotti) steals her most precious jewel, a very valuable necklace, and the window cleaner is unjustly accused because he was cleaning the windows at the time, though the assistant and confidant of the famous actress, Anita (Beatriz Saavedra) believes in his innocence.

Her research has considered fault propagation and rift basins. She was awarded the 2016 Geological Society of London Coke medal.  Early life and education  Cowie was born in the United Kingdom. She studied geology at Durham University and graduated in 1985. During her undergraduate degree she took part in field trips and became more interested in geological research. Cowie moved to the Lamont‚ÄìDoherty Earth Observatory at Columbia University for her graduate studies and earned master's degree in 1989. She remained there for her doctoral degree and completed her PhD under the supervision of Christopher Scholz in 1992. She moved to the University of Nice Sophia Antipolis as a postdoctoral research fellow in 1992, where she spent one year before joining the University of Edinburgh.  Research and career  Cowie moved to the University of Edinburgh in 1993, initially supported by a Natural Environment Research Council research fellowship. She was awarded a Royal Society University Research Fellowship in 1994. Her research considers the surface process responses to active faulting. These include studying the physical laws responsible for river erosion, how sediment is dispersed in rift basins and developing field testing models using source-to-sink approaches. She uses a range of research approaches, including data collected during field visits, theoretical and mathematical models. This includes the use of Lidar and ground-penetrating radar to monitor seismic slip. In 2003 Cowie was made an adjunct researcher at the Woods Hole Oceanographic Institution. She was promoted to Professor of Geodynamics at the University of Edinburgh in 2008. In 2011 Cowie joined the University of Bergen as a Professor of Geodynamics. Here she is co-leader of the Statoil-Norwegian Multi-Rift Project. Cowie has intensively investigated geological faults. She has studied the way that faults propagate, the variations in space and time due to the interactions of faults, the rates at which they slip and how damage zones develop in high porosity sandstones. Her recent work has considered the geomorphology of the Apennine Mountains in Italy and mainland Greece. Alongside work on geological faults, she has studied subsidence in rift basins, rates of erosion and how sediment is routed across rift basins. She has studied the evaluation of Late Jurassic rifting in the North Sea. She co-leads MultiRift, a Research Council of Norway program that uses surface process modelling. Cowie has investigated the origins of earthquakes, and was the first to identify that fault zones deform the same way predicted by experiments in laboratories. The Geological Society of London recognised the contributions that Cowie has made to geology in 2016 and awarded her the Coke medal. The citation read, \\"Patience Cowie‚Äôs research career has been outstanding from its outset: her seminal PhD work, carried out with Chris Scholz at the Lamont-Doherty Earth Observatory, produced novel insights into the way faults grow and interact, and explained the physical mechanisms behind fault linkage and the reason why fault displacement-length scaling occurs in natural systems... Patience‚Äôs research is characterised by deep clarity of thought, and represents a judicious combination of numerical modelling, seismic analysis and field observation... Patience Cowie, you are an inspirational and far-sighted geoscientist, who has revolutionized our understanding of the growth and interaction of faults\\". = Selected publications = Her publications include;  She has served as the editor of the Geological Society of America journal Geology.

In 1963, he worked unsuccessfully to save the life of American President John F. Kennedy after he was fatally shot, and, two days later, the life of Kennedy's assassin, Lee Harvey Oswald. Early life and education Robert Nelson McClelland was born on November 20, 1929 in Gilmer, Texas. His father, Robert, was a butcher, and his mother, Verna McClelland Nelson, worked for a federal relief agency. He graduated from University of Texas at Austin in 1950 and University of Texas Medical Branch in 1954. Career McClelland was a medical officer in the United States Air Force for two years and was stationed overseas in Germany for a time. After completing a residency at Parkland Memorial Hospital, he was hired as a faculty member at the University of Texas Southwestern Medical Center. His specialism was in surgery related to the liver, pancreas and biliary tract. In 1974, McClelland created and was the first editor for the very successful Selected Readings in General Surgery, aiming to present to students and surgeons the most useful of medical journal articles (now published by the American College of Surgeons). After forty-five years on the faculty at Southwestern Medical Center, McClelland retired in August 2007. In September 2007, he was appointed Professor Emeritus of Surgery at the UT Southwestern Medical Center, remaining involved in medical student education. =Assassination of John F. Kennedy and aftermath= On November 22, 1963, McClelland was working at Parkland Memorial Hospital in Dallas, Texas, when President John F. Kennedy was brought in grievously injured. Despite the efforts of the three attending surgeons (McClelland, Malcolm Perry and Charles R. Baxter), he died shortly after arriving. McClelland was the only member of Kennedy's surgical team who supported the idea that Kennedy had been shot from the front, thus the idea that there was a second gunman. Two days later, McClelland saw on the news that Kennedy's assassin Lee Harvey Oswald had been shot; McClelland immediately went back to the hospital. Along with George Shires, McClelland worked unsuccessfully to save Oswald's life, as he was pronounced dead two hours after being shot. McClelland preserved his blood-stained shirt from attempting to save President Kennedy for the rest of his life. Personal life and death McClelland married Connie Logan in May 1958. She was the head nurse at Parkland Memorial Hospital, and the two also attended the same church. They had two daughters and a son. McClelland enjoyed reading, and insisted on having a bookcase in every room of his house. McClelland died from kidney failure on September 10, 2019, at an assisted living facility in Dallas. He was 89. Honors In 1990, McClelland became the namesake for the Parkland Surgical Society's Robert N. McClelland Lectureship.

The 10-year-old girl disappeared on Tuesday, 15 September, 1981, between her cousin's house and her home, a ten-minute ride on her bicycle. Herrmann's disappearance triggered an immediate search which yielded nothing. After two days, cryptic calls were made to her home, consisting only of a radio jingle. After three days a ransom note arrived, apparently later than the kidnappers had intended, demanding DM 2 million, and explaining that the jingle was meant to elicit a yes-or-no response concerning payment of the ransom. On the next call, Ursula's mother affirmed that the ransom would be paid, but received no communication from the kidnappers. Instead, a letter arrived on Monday, September 21, with ransom payment instructions for an unstated location. The ransom sum was raised, but no further instructions arrived. Two weeks after Ursula's disappearance, a grid search was undertaken in the forest where Ursula disappeared. After four days of searching, police found Ursula Herrmann's dead body in a box buried in the woods. The box was furnished with ventilation, food, lights, reading material, a radio and a toilet bucket, but the ventilation pipes that had been provided did not allow sufficient air exchange. The autopsy concluded that she had died of suffocation within hours of being placed in the box, and that she had probably been sedated. The investigation identified Werner Mazurek, a neighbor of the Herrmanns, as a person of interest in the case. Investigation revealed that he had skills and motivation, but he had an alibi. However, a friend of Mazurek, Klaus Pfaffinger, stated to police that he had been hired by Mazurek to dig a hole in the forest but later recanted his claim. The case stalled, with no progress until 2007. With the thirty-year statute of limitations approaching, Mazurek was placed under surveillance and eventually arrested and charged, along with his wife. By this time, Pfaffinger was dead. The 2008 trial introduced Pfaffinger's statements and forensic evidence that a tape recorder found at Mazurek's house could have been the device used to play the radio jingle in the calls to the Herrmanns. Mazurek was convicted and sentenced to life imprisonment but his wife was acquitted. In 2015 a civil action was brought for damages by Ursula's brother Michael Herrmann. Michael had expressed reservations about Mazurek's conviction and used the proceeding to re-examine the case. In 2018 the court effectively affirmed the criminal trial verdict and awarded Herrmann partial damages.  Crime and police investigations  Ten-year-old student Ursula Herrmann, from Eching am Ammersee in Bavaria, was on her way home from her cousin's house in Schondorf am Ammersee on September 15, 1981 around 19:35, when she was kidnapped and placed in a prepared hiding place in the Weingarten forest. She was buried in the forest floor in a box measuring 72cm √ó 60cm √ó 139cm, which had lights, blankets, food, reading material, a radio tuned to Bayern 3 and a toilet bucket. A system of pipes was provided for ventilation, covered with leaves. However, with wet leaves and no forced air movement, it did not provide sufficient exchange of air, so that the girl suffocated between 30 minutes and five hours after she was placed in the box. Autopsy results indicated that she had not struggled or moved during her time in the box, and that she may have been drugged. The perpetrators made coded telephone calls to Ursula's family on September 17, playing the distinctive Bayern 3 radio jingle in an attempt to elicit a response concerning a ransom payment. However, the letter demanding the ransom, composed from cut-out letters, was not received until September 18, a day after the calls started. The note explained that the jingle should be answered with an affirmation that the ransom would be delivered. Denial, or an attempt to call the police, would result in the girl's death. Police had been called as soon as Ursula had disappeared, but the initial search had only found her bicycle. On September 21 another letter arrived with detailed instructions to hand over the money, but without stating a location for the delivery. After that, no further communications were received. Two weeks after Ursula's disappearance, the forest was searched by officers with metal rods, probing for disturbances, and after four days the box was found. The box was too large for one person to have transported to the site, weighing 60kg, and police assumed that more than one person was involved. Tips led to Werner Mazurek, a 31-year-old television repairman, who was a neighbor of the Herrmann family and known to be in debt. After a day without recalling his whereabouts, Mazurek eventually offered as his alibi that he had been playing Riskwith his wife and two friends. Nevertheless, Mazurek was arrested in January 1982 and questioned for several days before being released. In February Mazurek acquaintance Klaus Pfaffinger stated during questioning that Mazurek had asked him to dig a hole in the forest, and that he had seen a box in the hole. However, Pfaffinger could not lead police to the burial location and recanted his admission. No further progress was made in the investigation, apart from the discovery of a wire in the forest, apparently used to provide an alert during the kidnapping. In 2005, DNA analysis was used to examine evidence found in the box, but no useful matches were found. By then, the thirty year statute of limitations for kidnapping with fatal consequences was approaching, and the prime suspects were re- examined. Pfaffinger had died, but Mazurek was placed under surveillance, and in October 2007 his house was searched and Mazurek provided a saliva sample. No match was obtained between evidence and Mazurek. During the search of Mazurek's house, police confiscated a tape recorder. Police developed a theory that the tape recorder had been used to play the Bayern 3 jingle in the calls to the Herrmanns. Mazurek and his wife were arrested on 28 May 2008 and charged with the crime.  Trial  The trial began in February 2009. Police presented evidence of Mazurek's prior legal difficulties, including a 2004 fraud conviction, and of animal cruelty. It was established that Mazurek had the means to construct the box, that he had listened to police communications during the search, and that he was in debt. Surveillance evidence showed that Mazurek had discussed the statute of limitations with a friend. The Grundig Model TK 248 tape recorder was the subject of an elaborate forensic report. According to the report, the tape recorder had technical abnormalities which were identifiable in the jingle codes that appeared in the recorded phone calls to Herrmann family. Prosecutors also introduced Pfaffinger's abortive confession, with testimony that Pfaffinger had been deliberately misleading, and that he had accurately described the box and its burial site. Evidence was entirely circumstantial, and the tape recorder's distinctive noises when played were emphasized by the prosecution. Mazurek maintained that he had bought it at a flea market the week before the raid, but no corroboration from sellers could be found. The defense examined Pfaffinger's statement and revealed that Pfaffinger's confession had not been recorded contemporaneously: it had been written down by investigators weeks later, and had never been signed. Ursula's brother Michael took the extraordinary measure of making a written statement to the court, stating that the tape recorder analysis was \\"incomplete or one-sided.\\" The Augsburg public prosecutor demanded a sentence of lifelong imprisonment. The criminal court, composed of three judges and two jurors, found Mazurek guilty, and on March 25, 2010, Mazurek was sentenced to life imprisonment for extortionist human robbery with fatal consequences. His wife was acquitted.  Civil case  Ursula's brother, Michael Herrmann, brought a civil case before the district court of Augsburg against Mazurek in 2013, demanding ‚Ç¨20,000 in compensation, because he had suffered sustained damage to his health through the criminal case. Michael had become increasingly convinced that Mazurek had been wrongfully convicted on faulty evidence, and that a court action would be a means of re-examining the case. The case came to trial in 2016. Despite opposition from judges who were aware of Michael Herrmann's motives in the proceedings, the trial continued for two years. Evidence debunking the tape recorder analysis was introduced, along with forensic analysis of the ransom notes that concluded that the author of the note was an educated native German speaker who was pretending to be a foreigner, and that the writing could not have been produced by Mazurek. The case was concluded in May 2018, with a verdict that ordered Mazurek to pay Herrmann ‚Ç¨7000. In doing so, the court effectively affirmed that Mazurek had kidnapped Ursula Herrmann. In May 2019, Michael Herrmann presented new evidence to the judicial authorities concerning the ransom note. Herrmann alleged that traces of pressure from mathematical sketches corresponding to class work at the upper secondary level could be discerned in the note.

She is known for her research in the field of brain development, which focuses on how cognitive and social behaviors change from childhood to adulthood. She also currently holds the position of director of the Galv√°n Laboratory for Developmental Neuroscience at UCLA.  Biography  Galv√°n completed her bachelor's degree in Neuroscience and Behavior at Barnard College, Columbia University in 2001. She then received her Ph.D. in neuroscience at the Cornell University Weill Medical College in 2006 and later on went onto becoming the director of the Developmental Neuroscience Laboratory. From 2001 to 2006, Galv√°n engaged in training as a PhD student under the guidance of B.J. Casey at the Sackler Institute for Developmental Psychobiology at Weill Medical College. She also worked under the supervision of Russell Poldrack and Susan Bookheimer at the Semel Institute for Neuroscience and Behavior at UCLA from 2006 to 2008.  Research  Galv√°n has been conducting research in the Galv√°n Laboratory for Developmental Neuroscience at UCLA. Her research consists of the brain and its correlation to the processing and understanding of its development through childhood and adolescence leading up to adulthood. Her research received funding from the National Institute of Child Health and Human Development, National Institute of Mental Health, National Science Foundation, and the National Institute on Drug Addiction. The main point of Galv√°n's research program is to understand what neural mechanisms are being used during certain interactions, such as social interactions, risk-taking, and decision-making and how these experiences change their behavior and brain function. Currently, Galv√°n is working on a few different projects such as Brain Development and Learning, Neural Correlates of Adolescent Decision- Making, Sleep and Emotion, Sleep Habits and Risk-taking Behaviors, and Stress and Brain Function. Galv√°n's focus on the brain and decision making in adolescents is guided with the help of brain imaging to detect any psychological, neurobiological, and biological changes from childhood to adulthood in adolescents. In her studies, Galv√°n has addressed many environmental factors that can affect behavior in adolescents. Her work has also helped support the idea that adolescence is considered a transition out of childhood and into becoming an adult. Galv√°n's recent research has shown that the brains of adolescents have the ability to learn and process new information. Galv√°n's work has presented a different outlook on the human brain and has impacted science, law, and social policy. In one of her studies, Galv√°n examined the neural systems of neurobiological development in behavior and how fatal outcomes from risk-taking behavior can characterize adolescence. Her study suggests that accumbens activity in adolescents correlated with activity in adults, but the orbital frontal cortex activity in adolescents looked more similar to those of children instead of adults. Another one of her studies shows how Galv√°n examined the neural correlates in adolescents, children, and adults of risk-taking behavior to compare the activity in each brain and see who is at the greatest risk. This study suggests that individuals are most likely to develop risky behaviors when going through adolescence due to developmental changes in agreement with variability in a person's inclination to engage in this type of behavior. Galv√°n is the author of \\"The Neuroscience of Adolescence.\\" and has worked on over 97 manuscripts from the years 2004‚Äì2019. On June 25, 2020, she was named University of California, Los Angeles's new dean of undergraduate education; her deanship begins on July 1.  Awards  Galv√°n has received numerous awards throughout her life such as the William T. Grant Young Scholars Award in 2013, the American Psychological Association Division 7 Boyd McCandless Award in 2014, the Department of Psychology Distinguished Teaching Award in 2015, the Cognitive Neuroscience Society Young Investigator Award and the American Psychological Association Early Career Distinguished Scientific Contribution Award in 2016, the Fellow of the Association for Psychological Science and the U.S. Fulbright Scholar in 2018, and the National Academy of Sciences Troland Award and the Presidential Early Career Award for Scientists and Engineers in 2019.

The film looks at the effects of climate change over the next 20 years and what technologies that exist today can reverse the effects. Synopsis 2040 follows Gameau's imagining of a future for his four-year old daughter Velvet, where climate change has been solved. Described as ‚Äúan exercise in fact-based dreaming‚Äù the film is structured as a letter to his daughter whereby Gameau travels around the world investigating numerous solutions that can contribute towards climate mitigation and imagining what a future would be like where they have been implemented at scale. In choosing what to feature in the film, Gameau restricted it to solutions that are either already available or have a realistic potential to greatly contribute to reversing climate change by the year 2040. The film features interviews with numerous academics, ecological experts and entrepreneurs and covers five broad areas. It examines how renewable energy, like rooftop solar, have enabled micro-grids to form in Bangladesh enabling communities to produce, own and trade their own energy. The film addresses mobility and how a move away from car-ownership through self-driving cars and ride-sharing can enable the redesign of urban areas by promoting green spaces and more livable cities. It also examines the role of agriculture and how a shift towards regenerative agricultural practices can not only stop emitting greenhouse gas emissions but also contribute to carbon sequestration while enabling greater resilience, such as through increased water retention. The climate benefits of adopting plant-rich diets are also discussed. The film also looks at the many uses of seaweeds and how bringing seaweed ecosystems to the open ocean through Marine Permaculture can enable the sustainable harvest of seaweeds and fish to help guarantee food security while regenerating marine life and sequestering carbon. Finally, Gameau considers the cascading societal benefits of the empowerment of women and girls, notably through education, as it enables women to have greater control over their life-decisions thereby providing a non-coercive, human-rights based means to reduce population growth. Cast Along with Gameau, the film features interviews with Paul Hawken, Kate Raworth, Tony Seba, Neel Tahmane, Eric Toensmeier, Genevieve Bell, Brian Von Herzen, Amanda Cahill, Colin Seis and Helena Norberg-Hodge. Reception 2040 received a positive response from critics. Review aggregator Rotten Tomatoes reports so far that 100% of 22 film critics have given the film a positive review, with a rating average of 6.88 out of 10. The site's critics' consensus reads: \\"With 2040, documentarian Damon Gameau entertainingly surveys possible solutions to the climate change crisis, offering an unusually optimistic way forward.\\" In his review for The Guardian, Luke Buckmaster was generally positive, saying \\"Damon Gameau‚Äôs upbeat documentary predicts our best selves saving the planet but would have been better as a TV series\\". Although doubtful of Gameau‚Äôs on-screen persona, Ben Kenigsberg of the New York Times was mostly positive describing it as an ‚Äúaccessible, informative and optimistic look at solutions to the climate crisis‚Äù. In a review oriented towards parents, Sandie Angulo Chen of Commonsense Media was also positive, giving the film a four-star review in a review that emphasized its educational value and positive messaging. The film has also received some international attention having been selected for the Seattle, Stockholm, Berlin and Gold Coast film festivals.

She has released four studio albums on Portland-based Fluff & Gravy Records. Her 2017 album Small Believer received positive reviews and was named a \\"Top 10 underheard album of 2017\\" by Ann Powers of NPR. In 2019, NPR called her album The Question \\"one of the most ambitious folk records of 2019\\"; it was also listed by Paste as one of \\"10 essential folk albums from 2019\\". Rolling Stone listed her as a standout performer at the 2019 AmericanaFest in Nashville, writing \\"In a week of countless songsmiths showcasing their attempt at that exact type of singer-songwriter storytelling, Tivel's winding, largely chorus- less tales shined and shimmered.\\" The magazine also named the lead single from The Question, \\"Fenceline\\", a \\"song you need to know\\". Tivel was born in La Conner, Washington and grew up in a musical family, learning violin and fiddle as a child. After moving to Portland at age 18, she developed an interest in songwriting and began to write and perform her own material. Many of her songs are vignettes about the lives and struggles of ordinary people; she said in an interview \\"I'm drawn over and over to the small stories of people (myself included) just trying to get by, to do a little better, to feel some sort of beauty in an ugly world.\\" Tivel's songs are often somber in tone as she has said that she \\"just [doesn't] trust happy songs as much\\".

He worked primarily at the University of Milano (1971-1995) and at the Department of Chemistry of the Politecnico di Milano in Milan, Italy (2005-2011). He has served as the President of the Societ√† Italiana di Proteomica (Italian Proteome Society, IPSo). A special issue of Electrophoresis was published in Righetti's honor in 2006, recognizing his work developing new methods and techniques for electrophoresis. His contributions have been described as \\"paramount in the ability to separate biomolecules electrophoretically\\". Righetti uses those techniques to study proteomes, sets of proteins that are expressed in organisms. He focuses particularly on animals and foods. Proteomics describes the proteins that can exist in a given type of cell and their interactions, form and structure. Proteins can remain intact for hundreds or even thousands of years. One of many applications of Righetti's techniques is the study of historical artifacts, analyzing minute amounts of protein left on them to learn more about their owners and the conditions under which they were used. Education and career Righetti attended the University of Pavia in Italy, from which he received a Ph.D in Organic Chemistry in 1965. He also did compulsory military service, in the Mountain Artillery. Between 1966 and 1970 he held postdoctoral positions: first at Massachusetts Institute of Technology for three years and then at Harvard Medical School for one year where he studied electrophoresis with James W. Drysdale. They developed techniques for isoelectric focusing (IEF) using soluble carrier ampholytes and polyacrylamide gels. In 1971, Righetti accepted a position at the University of Milano as a professor of biochemistry. He remained there for the next 24 years. He then worked for two years at the University of Calabria with Roberto Bartolino, and for another eight years at the University of Verona with Franco Tagliaro and Mahmud Hamdan. Finally he returned to Milan to work at the Politecnico di Milano, where he established a proteomics lab. He became professor emeritus at age seventy, under mandatory retirement laws. Righetti has consulted with NASA, the European Space Agency and the Italian Space Agency on experiments in microgravity. Research In 2012, Righetti was awarded the 2012 Beckman award for \\"outstanding career achievement in the field of electrodriven separations and technologies with particular consideration given to developments of new methods and techniques in electrophoresis.\\" The methodologies that Righetti developed include isoelectric focusing in soluble buffers and immobilized pH gradients; multicompartment electrolyzers for isoelectric membranes and membrane‚Äêtrapped enzyme reactors, and temperature‚Äêprogrammed capillary zone electrophoresis (CZE). In 2017, researchers stated \\"The work of P.G. Righetti has been paramount in the ability to separate biomolecules electrophoretically, particularly according to isoelectric point.\\" Righetti has published more than 750 papers, with an H-index of 60. He has created 10 patents and written 11 books. Several of his works are considered classic sources for electrophoretic methods. Righetti was closely involved with the journals Electrophoresis (founded 1980), and its sister journal Proteomics (founded 2001). He served as a member of the editorial board of Electrophoresis from its founding by Bertold J. Radola onwards. He has also worked on the editorial boards of the Journal of Chromatography, the Journal of Capillary Electrophoresis, the Journal of Biochemical and Biophysical Methods, BioTechniques, and the Journal of Proteomics. He has served as the President of the Societ√† Italiana di Proteomica (Italian Proteome Society, IPSo). Applications Righetti has applied his methods to biomedical and clinical problems, including the study of hemoglobin and the development of neonatal screening for the inherited blood disorder Beta thalassemia. His work on immobilized pH gradients led to pioneering mapping of human proteins using two-dimensional gel electrophoresis. His multicompartment electrolyzer (MCE) for purifying proteins using amphoteric buffering membranes, has been used for pre- fractionation in proteome analysis. His work on capillary zone electrophoresis (CZE) supports the identification of DNA point mutations. He has been involved in the development of large hexapeptide libraries for the identification of unique protein sequences, and in combinatorial peptide ligand capture. Beginning in 2011, Righetti's methods also have been used for the examination of historical artifacts. In 2011, Righetti was asked by Alberto Melloni to determine the composition of a Bible, believed to have belonged to the Italian explorer Marco Polo in 1271. After four centuries in Shangdu, China, the Bible was given to Cosimo III de' Medici, Grand Duke of Tuscany, in 1685, and became part of the holdings of the Laurentian Library in Florence, Italy. Fragmented into almost ten thousand pieces, the bible was slated for conservation. The ultrathin sheets of parchment, barely 80 microns thick, were suspected to be made from the skin of lamb fetuses. A team led by Lucia Toniolo examined a fragment from the manuscript, microwaving it, dissolving it with trypsin, and purifying it. They identified eight proteins from the genus Bos taurus indicative of calf tissue. They suggested that the parchment dated to southern France before 1250, and was likely a livre de poche, or pocket Bible, produced by scribes at the University of Paris. Next, Righetti sought to develop non- invasive techniques for analyzing the proteins left on manuscripts and diaries. In 2015 he, Gleb Zilberstein and others reported an analysis of pages from an original manuscript by Mikhail Bulgakov: Master and Margarita. They used resin beads which were placed on the page to extract proteins. From the margins of the manuscript, the team detected protein biomarkers indicative of kidney disease and the painkiller morphine. Bulgakov finished the novel a few weeks before he died of an inherited kidney disorder. When it was suggested that the beads might cause damage, Righetti, Zilberstein, Alfonsina d‚ÄôAmato and others immobilized them within diskettes of ethylene-vinyl acetate (EVA) film, which is used to lift acids and proteins during manuscript preservation. Inspired by The Betrothed, Alessandro Manzoni's account of the Great Plague of Milan, a devastating 1630 outbreak of bubonic plague in which nearly half the population died, the researchers examined the city's death registries. They found evidence of proteins from the plague bacterium, Yersinia pestis, rat droppings, and corn, rice, carrots, and chickpeas, suggesting that the scribes ate their lunches at their desks. There were also indications that sheep and goats may have been housed in the lazaretto near the sick. In 2017, Righetti, Zilberstein, d‚ÄôAmato and others analyzed five letters and a blood-stained shirt that was worn by Anton Chekhov as he died. The researchers used beads in EVA films to collect proteins. Then they extracted and purified them, and used liquid chromatography and mass spectrometry to analyze the results. They found traces of spittle, saliva, 108 proteins found in human blood, and proteins characteristic of Mycobacterium tuberculosis, from which Chekhov was known to have suffered. Unexpectedly, they also found ITIH4, a protein associated with blood clots. Their results open up the possibility that the immediate cause of Chekhov's death may have been a stroke.

His term saw continued divisions between the plebeians and the patricians. His father was named Publius Veturius Cicurinus, possibly identifying him with the consul of 499 BC. Biography =Consulship= In 455 BC, he was elected consul with Titus Romilius Rocus Vaticanus.Diodorus Siculus, Bibliotheca Historica, XII. 4 They issued orders during a period of high tension between the patricians and the plebeians. The tribunes of the plebs, representatives of the people, demanded in vain for many years that the power of the consuls be limited in written law. The Lex Terentilia, first drafted in 462 BC, was deferred each year by the tribunes who proposed numerous identical drafts of the law. =Proceedings= In the wake of their decision, Veturius and Romilius were taken to court by the plebeian aedile Lucius Alienus and by the tribune of the plebs, Gaius Calvus Cicero, in early 454 BC. The testimony of Lucius Siccius Dentatus implicated Titus Romilius, but Siccius retracted his testimony when the old consul offered to send an ambassador to the Greek cities as a sign of appeasement during political tensions. Nevertheless, Romilius and Veturius were found guilty and ordered to pay a considerable indemnity of 10,000 asses. This proved impracticable, and so a law was passed allowing the indemnity to be satisfied by an equivalent value in cattle and bronze. = Augur = In 453 BC Veturius was elected as augur to replace Gaius Horatius Pulvillus who had died in a large pestilence that ravaged Rome.Livy. iii, 32.3Broughton, vol i, pp.44 References Category:Roman Republican consuls Category:5th-century BC Romans Category:Roman patricians ","title":"Gaius Veturius Cicurinus"},{"id":"61877472","title":"Nia DaCosta"},{"id":"61877476","title":"An Ode"},{"id":"61877478","title":"2019‚Äì20 Campbell Fighting Camels basketball team"},{"id":"61877482","text":"The Vancouver Warriors is a professional lacrosse team based in Vancouver, British Columbia.

Biography The daughter of Carlos Madariaga Pizarro and Laura Guti√©rrez Ugarte, and granddaughter of a Chilean Army general, M√≥nica Madariaga studied with the Ursulines Nuns, at the Colegio Compa√±√≠a de Mar√≠a, and at in Providencia. She entered the law school of the University of Chile and graduated in 1966 with the thesis Derecho administrativo y seguridad jur√≠dica (Administrative Law and Legal Security). She worked at the office of the Comptroller General from 1962 to 1977. When Augusto Pinochet headed the Governing Board, she was appointed Minister of Justice, serving from 1977 and 1983. At this time the Constitution of 1980 and Decree Law 2.191, better known as the ‚Äì which was drafted by Madariaga herself ‚Äì were enacted. M√≥nica Madariaga apologized in an interview granted in 1985 to the journalist M√≥nica Gonz√°lez for the magazine ', claiming to have lived in a \\"micro-reality\\" that did not allow her to see what was really happening in the country with regard to human rights violations. At the same time she blamed Jaime Guzm√°n and Jos√© Pi√±era for some of their actions. After the country's return to democracy, she became the rector of Andr√©s Bello University. She was a Union of the Centrist Center candidate for senator for O'Higgins Region in the 1997 parliamentary election, but received 16.65% of votes and was not elected. Later she was director of the Law School of the University UNIACC. From 2001 to 2003, she was active in the Independent Democratic Union (UDI). Death In 2004, M√≥nica Madariaga contracted an aggressive form of bone and breast cancer, which was initially contained, but then returned and metastasized to her lymphatic system. She died from cancer at 6:00 a.m. on 8 October 2009 at her home in the municipality of Las Condes. Controversies M√≥nica Madariaga was characterized by her strong personality, frank character, and divisive revelations and statements, which landed her in several controversies in the press. She was a frequent guest on television programs precisely because of her openness to unveiling some episodes of the military regime, such as indicating the great influence that Luc√≠a Hiriart exerted on her husband. She caused a stir when, in an interview with the newspaper La Tercera in 2000, she affirmed that the leaders of the rightist UDI were indoctrinated in Colonia Dignidad. In 2009 she returned to the public spotlight by affirming, in an interview with of San Antonio, that in 1982 she would have interceded to free Sebasti√°n Pi√±era, then general manager of the Banco de Talca, from his imprisonment for fraud and infractions to the General Bank Law. Pi√±era denied the accusations, but Madariaga reaffirmed her statements, calling the Coalition for Change's presidential candidate a \\"liar\\".

Early life  Schumann was born to Ernst \\"Max\\" Schumann, a circus proprietor, and Vivi Merete Mikkelsen, the daughter of a Danish veterinarian.  Career  = Circus = Schumann rides a bison at the Big Apple Circus' 1989 production of Grandma Goes West Schumann made appearances with her family's circus in Denmark, Cirkus Schumann, representing the fifth generation of her family to perform in the circus. She starred in her own act at 10, and made appearances in her family's show through 1983. In 1974, Schumann was awarded La Dame du Cirque at the International Circus Festival in Monte Carlo. In 1976, Schumann was awarded the Gold Medal at the Circus World Championships in London. In 1981, she made her first appearance in Paul Binder's Big Apple Circus, marrying Binder in 1985, the year she also became the first woman in the United States to perform 'The Courier of St. Petersburg', originated by Andrew Ducrow. She also performed haute √©cole. In 1992, she performed at the Big Apple Circus with her father and daughter, and would in later years perform with her son and niece. The term \\"Schumannship\\" was coined for the Schumann family, meant to invoke \\"superb equestrian skills.\\" While working in the United States, Schumann has presented a wide variety of horses, with a particular interest in Arabian and American Saddlebred horses. According to R.J. Candranell of Arabian Visions magazine, \\"The [Arabian] horses go back in all lines to the 1906 Davenport importation of Arabian horses from the Anazeh and Shammar tribes.\\" Schumann says of horses, ‚ÄùThey are our colleagues, not our pets. We and the horses depend on one another. I think the bedouins and cowboys did the same.‚Äù Schumann would also occasionally lend her horses to other shows and their performers, such as bareback rider Timi Loyal of the Loyal-Suarez equestrian troupe, and pasture the animals on local farms when they were not working. = Film = Schumann working behind the scenes on the Danish film Gooseboy, 2019 In 1965, Schumann appeared in a documentary short about her family, directed by her cousin, Benny Schumann. In 1990, scenes for Woody Allen's film Alice were shot at the Big Apple Circus; Schumann makes an appearance presenting horses. In 1991, she appeared in the HBO documentary The Big Apple Circus, commemorating the 15th anniversary of the show, narrated by her husband at the time, Paul Binder. In 2019, she worked behind the scenes of Gooseboy, a family film about a young Danish boy and his goose guide; Schumann provided her trained goose and was credited as \\"animal handler.\\"  Retirement  In 2015, Schumann purchased a dilapidated former pig farm in L√∏kken-Vr√•, Denmark, a tourist town in the northern part of Jutland. She and her partner, Jens Oluf \\"Luffe\\" B√∏gh, renovated the property into a working animal farm, seasonal circus, and museum showcasing Schumann's family history and artifacts.  Personal life  Schumann has two children with Paul Binder, Katherine (b. 1985) and Max (b. 1987). Max was born in her family's RV, without a doctor or midwife present, after Schumann performed two shows earlier that day, experiencing \\"a couple of contractions during the act.\\" Said Schumann at the time, \\"I caught him before he hit the floor. He quacked and snorted a little and I thought, 'this boy looks just fine to me!' so I tucked him in with me under my bathrobe and waited for the midwives to arrive.\\" Max was born on a Wednesday, and Schumann took off the Thursday morning circus show before returning to perform that evening.

Life and murder  Cherish Lily Perrywinkle was born in Jacksonville, Florida on Christmas Eve of 2004 to Rayne Perrywinkle and Billy Jarreau, whose marriage ended in divorce and subsequent custody battles. On June 21, 2013 around 8 pm, Rayne, Cherish, and her two younger sisters went shopping when they first met Donald Smith at a Dollar General, where he offered to buy them clothes they could not afford with a $150 Walmart gift card. The Perrywinkles then got into his white van and went with him to Walmart, where they shopped for the next 2 hours. At 10:30 pm, Smith offered to get them cheeseburgers at the store‚Äôs McDonald's and convinced Cherish to go with him. However, surveillance footage shows that they walked out of the store instead, which was the last time Cherish was seen alive. About half an hour later, Rayne called the police to report that her daughter had been abducted and an amber alert was later issued. The next morning Cherish‚Äôs body was found in a creek behind Highland‚Äôs Baptist Church. It is believed that Smith had bound her in the back of his van, where she was sexually assaulted and strangled to death.  Smith‚Äôs arrest  Police immediately identified Smith as the abductor, with his van being one of the main focuses. Around 9 am the next day, officers saw his van on the interstate and cornered him before he surrendered and was promptly arrested. Smith was known to police as a local sex offender with a long criminal history including numerous offenses against minors. He had been released from jail only three weeks before Cherish‚Äôs murder.  Trial  Smith‚Äôs trial began in February 2018. He was found guilty of first-degree murder and sexual battery and was sentenced to death in May 2018. The jurors were in tears after witnessing crime scene photos of the murder as the defense tried to suppress the images. Julie Schlax, the defense attorney, urged the jurors to focus on the law and not their raw emotions.

The division is tasked to carry out special operations. The AFSOD draws personnel from all three special warfare branches of the Armed Forces. Indian Army Major General A. K. Dhingra, who is a war veteran from the Para SF, was appointed in May 2019 as the first head of the AFSOD. The division is expected to be converted into a full sized tri-service command in future.  History  = Origins = The Naresh Chandra Task Force was set up in July 2011 by National Security Advisor Shivshankar Menon to review the recommendations of the Kargil Review Committee, assess the implementation progress and further suggest new reforms related to national security. The task force was led by Naresh Chandra, retired Indian Administrative Service officer, and comprised 13other members, including Gopalaswami Parthasarathy, Air Chief Marshal Srinivasapuram Krishnaswamy (Retd), Admiral Arun Prakash (Retd), Lieutenant General V. R. Raghavan (Retd), Anil Kakodkar, K. C. Verma and V. K. Duggal. The committee conducted the first holistic review of national security since the Kargil Review Committee and submitted its classified report to Prime Minister Manmohan Singh on 23May2012. Among its recommendations, the Task Force recommended the creation of a cyber command, an aerospace command and a special operations command. All three units were proposed to be tri-service commands in order to bring the various special forces units of the military under a unified command and control structure. The AFSOD is a downsized implementation of this proposal. The creation of the AFSOD was approved by Prime Minister Narendra Modi during the Combined Commanders' Conference at Jodhpur Air Force Station on 28 September 2018. = Initial exercises = The division concluded its first exercise, code named 'Smelling Field', on 28 September 2019. The exercise was carried out in the district of Kutch in the state of Gujarat. The exercise was meant to help in ironing out, and subsequently addressing the challenges faced by the division. A second exercise, code named 'DANX-2019', was subsequently held in the Andaman and Nicobar Islands.  Organisation  The AFSOD will function under the Integrated Defence Staff. Units from all the three special forces of the Indian Armed Forces will be stationed in the division. The division is expected to be fully operational by November 2019. = Role = The AFSOD is expected to serve as the main organisation responsible for carrying out special operations within and outside India. They are expected to carry out missions such as targeting high-value installations and degrading the war- fighting capabilities of hostile nations. The rationale behind the creation of this division is to pool the special abilities of each of the special forces units of the Armed Forces and enable them to operate together. The division will also help in reducing operational costs, since it will enable each of the special warfare units to utilise common equipment. = Components = Garud Commandos The division is expected to have around 3,000 soldiers. The main components of the AFSOD are: :*Para (Special Forces): The Para SF is the special warfare branch of the Indian Army. They will form a major portion of the AFSOD. :*MARCOS: The MARCOS is the special warfare branch of the Indian Navy. It is specialised in operations in a maritime environment, although it can operate in all environments. :*Garud Commando Force: The Garud Commando Force is the special warfare branch of the Indian Air Force. They are tasked to undertake missions in support of air operations. They are deployed at important military bases and assets and conduct search and rescue missions during wartime. :*Other systems: The division will be given operational control of transport aircraft, specialised weapon systems and surveillance equipment.

Rising to a height of above the sea and extending some , with seventy columns, an intercolumniation of , and a width from column to wall of , the form, inspired by a Roman arcade, is said to be without parallel. History In accordance with the 1905 Treaty of Portsmouth, South Sakhalin was incorporated into the Empire of Japan and governed as Karafuto Prefecture. To improve maritime connections between Wakkanai and Sakhalin, between 1910 and 1919 plans were laid for the redevelopment of the old fishing port of Wakkanai, with civil engineer in charge. Measures included a north breakwater to protect the port from windstorms and high waves, paired with a sand groin to the south to enclose the port, together with land reclamation and the construction of moorings. Initial plans for the north breakwater were for its parapet to rise to a height of , but this was considered insufficient to withstand winter storms. A revised design was formulated by twenty-six year- old , a graduate of the Department of Civil Engineering at Hokkaid≈ç Imperial University. Construction of the breakwater began in 1920, with works on the North Breakwater Dome carried out from 1931 and completed in 1936. The superstructure is supported by reinforced concrete piles on the inner side and rests on the reinforced concrete body of the breakwater facing the sea; it is topped with a parapet nearly high. The shipping route to Korsakov opened in 1923, that to Nevelsk the following year. From 1938 to 1945 there was a railway station in the Dome. With the end of the war and interruption of ties with Sakhalin, the station closed, and the Dome came to be used for coal storage. By the late 1960s the concrete of the Dome was deteriorating, with the volumetric expansion of the corroding steel used for reinforcement, after many cycles of freezing and thawing, and the action of salts. Reconstruction began in 1978 and was completed in 1981. In 2001, the North Breakwater Dome of Wakkanai Port was among the first assets to be listed as Hokkaid≈ç Heritage.

Both associations brought him into contact with members of the Communist Party of Germany (KPD). A major commission at GeSoLei was followed by two paintings for the Department of the History of Science, depicting Albertus Magnus and the witch-hunt opponent, Johann Weyer.

It was published by Harper on September 24, 2019. It tells the story of a brother and sister over the course of five decades. The novel was a finalist for the 2020 Pulitzer Prize for Fiction. Plot The Dutch House is a mansion located in Elkins Park, Pennsylvania, a suburb of Philadelphia. It was built in 1922 by the VanHoebeek family, a husband and wife originally from the Netherlands who made their fortune in the tobacco industry. Cyril Conroy, a self-made real estate mogul, bought the mansion in 1946 to surprise his wife Elna. Their children, Danny and Maeve, were raised in the Dutch House. Elna dislikes the Dutch House and, when Danny is 3 and Maeve is 10, she abandons the family to work with the poor in India. After their father dies, the two siblings are forced out of their home by their stepmother, Andrea. Left with no one else, the two siblings rely on each other. Maeve discovers a scholarship trust and uses it to send Danny to Choate Rosemary Hall, Columbia University and to medical school. He finishes medical school despite being uninterested in working as a doctor, hoping to please Maeve. The novel is narrated by an adult Danny Conroy. Background Patchett was inspired to use Elkins Park as the novel's setting because when she was a student at Sarah Lawrence College she would spend holidays and weekends in Wyncote, Elkins Park, and Jenkintown. She also chose Elkins Park given its proximity to New York, which she already knew would feature in the novel. Reception At the review aggregator website Book Marks, which assigns individual ratings to book reviews from mainstream literary critics, the novel received a cumulative \\"Positive\\" rating based on 31 reviews: 15 \\"Rave\\" reviews, 13 \\"Positive\\" reviews, and 3 \\"Mixed\\" reviews. Publishers Weekly gave the novel a rave review, writing, \\"Patchett's splendid novel is a thoughtful, compassionate exploration of obsession and forgiveness, what people acquire, keep, lose or give away, and what they leave behind.\\" Kirkus Reviews gave the novel a rave review, writing, \\"Casually stated but astute observations about human nature are Patchett's stock in trade, and she again proves herself a master of aging an ensemble cast of characters over many decades. In this story, only the house doesn't change. You will close the book half believing you could drive to Elkins Park and see it.\\" Donna Seaman of Booklist praised the novel, comparing it the works of F. Scott Fitzgerald and Alice McDermott and saying, \\"Patchett is at her subtle yet shining finest.\\" Writing for The New York Times Book Review, author Martha Southgate gave the book a positive review, saying, \\"This novel takes a winding road through the forest and doesn't rush to a finish, nor is the ending wholly surprising. But if you allow yourself to walk along with Patchett, you'll find riches at the end of the trail.\\" Donna Liquori of the Associated Press wrote, \\"Patchett's storytelling abilities shine in this gratifying novel.\\" References Category:Novels by Ann Patchett Category:2019 American novels Category:HarperCollins books Category:Novels set in Pennsylvania ","title":"The Dutch House (novel)"},{"id":"61878730","text":"The 2003 Fort Wayne mayoral election was held on November 4 to elect the mayor of Fort Wayne, Indiana, US.

She has promoted the visibility of asexuality, aromanticism, and of LGBTQ+ people of colour and has worked as a lingerie and alternative model. As Aislin Magazine wrote, in \\"the predominantly White alternative branch of modeling, [Benoit has] become one of the UK's most prominent Black alternative models.\\" Early life Benoit is from Reading, Berkshire. She is of Trinidadian, Jamaican, and Barbadian descent. She attended Reading Girls' School and Padworth College. She has a Bachelor of Science in Sociology from St Mary's University, Twickenham and a Master of Science in Crime Science from University College London. Career Benoit began modeling at age 16, focusing her efforts on alternative fashion despite the industry's emphasis of Eurocentric beauty standards. Her first modeling breakthrough was in 2015 with Scottish brand CRMC. Her gigs following that included Love Sick London, Dethkult Clothing, Seduced By Lilith, Kuki London, Pin Up Girl Clothing, and Teen Hearts. In March 2018, Benoit collaborated with African-American-owned gothic fashion brand, Gothic Lamb. Benoit appeared in a BBC Three documentary on asexuality, but was critical of the experience, claiming the way the documentary framed asexuality was a misrepresentation. She later appeared in a Sky News documentary on asexuality in February 2019. Regarding her work as a lingerie model whilst being asexual, she told Sky News, \\"I'm literally here to show off the clothes and make it look good. I'm not trying to sell myself, I'm trying to sell a product.\\" Benoit has written for several publications including HuffPost UK and given talks at several events and universities, including the University of Cambridge, the UK Asexuality Conference in 2018, Reading Pride, King's College London in February 2019, and National Student Pride. In collaboration with Asexual Visibility and Education Network (AVEN), Budweiser, and Revolt London, Benoit hosted the first asexual-themed bar at Pride in London in 2019. Benoit walked the runway in the London Queer Fashion Show that year. In October, she joined the Board of Directors of the AVEN. In a December 2019 issue of Attitude titled \\"The Activists\\", Benoit became the first openly asexual woman to appear on the cover of a UK magazine. Benoit has an upcoming BBC Sounds radio series. Personal life Benoit is asexual and aromantic. \\"I may not be the first four letters, but I do not relate to the heterosexual experience in the slightest,\\" she told The Nopebook in March 2019. She came out publicly in a video on YouTube in 2017 titled \\"Things Asexual Girls Don't Like to Hear\\", which began her journey as an activist.

Founded in 1953 by the Terragni brothers, it also included the companies Corima spa, GBF spa, GBF iberica, RIAP srl, FIRS spa, Covepla Spain (specialized in thermosetting machines), Italproducts srl, Omam spa, TPA srl, AGRIPAK srl, Floraplant srl, Interfinance SA, Technical Die spa, Covema SAE. The technology that Covema has developed since the 1950s is merged into Agripak srl based in Milano and managed by the sons of Marco Terragni: Fabio Terragni (president), Patrizia Terragni and Massimo Terragni (managing directors). History Founded in Milan in 1953, Covema (Commissionaria Vendita Macchine) first devoted itself to the commercialization of plastic processing machinery. This marketing activity was a great help to the growth and development of the Luigi Bandera spa in Busto Arsizio, which at the time was making the first blown film extrusion lines to produce plastic bags and films. One of the most successful markets of this initial activity of Covema was the US market where, thanks to Covema's intermediation, the Luigi Bandera spa exported dozens of blown film extrusion lines during the 1950s. Marco Terragni was the main proponent of such sales success towards the North American market.Registro delle imprese, Camera di commercio di Milano In the late 1950s, the Covema began the production and sale of its blown film extrusion lines. In the meantime, exports to the Latin American markets began and Marco Terragni was asked during his missions abroad to produce in plastic various objects made so far of wood or paper or glass. Thus began a phase of research and development that led Covema to create two poles for specific research such as the FIRS for the production of machines for window and door profiles and the RIAP (Research Industrial Applications Polyolefin) of Zingonia (Bergamo) for the development of polypropylene (PP) applications recently polymerized by Professor Giulio Natta at the Milan Polytechnic. Thus were born the first plants for the production of synthetic raffia and monofilaments: the first fair in which Covema showed in operation a raffia plant in PP was Equiplast of Barcelona in 1969.Resoconto fiera Equiplast 1969 Montecatini intensively collaborated with RIAP for the development of various grades of polymers and copolymers of PP. In RIAP some downstream plants were also developed to produce raffia or monofilament articles (fabrics, ropes, woven bags, etc.).Interview of Marco Terragni Modern Plastic International, 1999 Still at the RIAP at the beginning of the 1970s a group of researchers coordinated by Marco Terragni created a first pilot plant for the production of Cartonplast (PP alveolar sheets). Many other developments in technology were made in those years by Covema, including the extrusion in flat head of PP sheets and the thermoforming of these sheets to produce disposable cups. Various other technologies for the production of pipes, machines for covering electric cables, extrusion lines for WoodPlast (synthetic wood), multi-filaments spinning plants of the POY type (Partially Oriented Yarns) or FDY type (Fully Drawn) or BCF type (Bulky Continuous Filaments) for nylon, PA, PP, PET were also developed by Covema for the production of upholstery, fabrics for the automotive industry, carpets and rugs, industrial filters, technical garments. At the company Corima at Cassano Magnago, Covema realized the specific development of multi-filament plants and systems to cover electric cables.Estratto del senato della Repubblica Italiana del 30 Luglio 1980Estratto Della camera dei Deputati Italiana del venerd√¨ 27 febbraio 1981 Cartonplast logo The Plastiform of Paderno Dugnano was instead created by Covema for the development of technologies for thermoforming both from sheet and board. The FC series machines were developed to form and cut in the same station using match metal system; the Rotoform series, which formed and cut with a separate cutting press and the Multiform series that formed, die cut, and stacked in line. Plastiform also produced thermoforming machines for board to produce, for example, counterdoor and inside of refrigerator cells, bathtubs. Also at Plastiform, the first in line extrusion and thermoforming were developed and a compact extrusion / calendering system (named subsequently Compact) was designed to be put in line with thermoformers especially for the FC and Rotoform series.Estratti del consiglio di amministrazione conservati presso l'archivio storico della Camera di Commercio di Milano The Rotoform machines were the first ever used by the Swiss group Ovotherm for the production of polystyrene (PS) egg containers. During the 1970s, Ovotherm opened several factories all over the world for the production of eggs in PS and Covema was the partner who supplied the necessary machines for thermoforming. Other companies belonging to the Covema group were Ombia spa of Solbiate Arno, which specialized in the start of the production of pipe systems and the GBF of Milan, which dedicated itself to the production of injection molding machines. GBF Spa worked intensely with Basell Polyolefins of Milan and developed with it some important patents. Also worthy of note is the collaboration of Covema with the company Magic s.p.a. of Monza specialized in the production of extrusion / blow molding lines for plastic bottles.

The quality is determined by the maturity of the oocyte and the cells that it comprises, which are susceptible to various factors which impact quality and thus reproductive success.This is of significance as an embryo's development is more heavily reliant on the oocyte in comparison to the sperm.  Factors  = Age = Advanced maternal age represents a significant consideration for ovum health, and is currently regarded as the largest risk factor underlying instances of aneuploidy in human populations. The mechanisms by which ovum health degenerates with age are incompletely understood. Extended meiotic arrest, a decline in mitochondrial function, and oxidative stress are key factors associated with ageing that are damaging to oocyte quality, identified in studies utilising both human and animal oocytes.  Meiotic arrest and loss of cohesion  The formation of human gametes involves two separation events, known distinctly as Meiosis I, in which paired homologous chromosomes are separated, and Meiosis II, in which sister chromatids are divided. Meiosis I is a slightly elongated process, during which homologous chromosomes align, pair, and recombine. While male gametes (sperm) are continuously produced throughout life, the female ovarian reserve is fully formed during early development. Oocytes (but not spermatocytes) then undergo a prolonged arrest at the end of diplotene, until meiosis resumes at the beginning of the menstrual cycle. It is during this prolonged arrest that age-dependent changes or deterioration may occur. During the oocyte's prolonged arrest, chromosomes exist as bivalents. This means that homologous chromosomes have paired, and are being held together by chiasmata (the physical crossovers between chromosome arms). The cohesin complex, a ring like structure associated with sister chromatids, helps to hold them in close proximity, therefore generating sister chromatid cohesion. This cohesion is later broken by the enzyme separase, allowing the chiasmata to be broken and homologous chromosomes to segregate in a normal way. Age-related degeneration of the inhibitors and regulators of separase, may lead to inappropriate and premature cohesin degradation before anaphase. As a result, homologous chromosomes may align independently on the meiotic spindle, risking aneuploidy that represents a key mechanism of reduced reproductive success.  Mitochondrial changes  As the most mitochondria-dense cells in the body, ova depend upon these organelles for early embryonic development, proliferation and their competence for fertilisation. Therefore, age-related changes to mitochondrial function naturally represent a significant influence on ovum quality and female fertility. Specific changes that occur with age include a reduction in quantity of mitochondrial DNA, as well as an increase in mitochondrial DNA mutations. Animal studies have demonstrated these genetic abnormalities, in addition to physical changes in the mitochondria themselves and reduced ATP production. Further investigation is required to establish definitive evidence for decreasing developmental potential as a result of aging mitochondria, however the accumulation of mitochondrial abnormalities over time in the female ovum has been established, and appears linked in some way to declining ova health. = Obesity = Studies show that obesity affects the quality of the ovum. It is a disease which decreases the fertility of the female. This is mainly due to causing a disturbance to maternal hormonal levels. It is also possible for the uterus to have different levels of receptivity with regards to oocyte attachment, as a result of a disturbance to the function of the endometrium. Furthermore, ingesting higher levels of carbohydrates and increased levels of glucose in the diet has been related to a higher chance of infertility because of the ovary failing to release oocytes at ovulation. Obesity also has been linked to early miscarriages, deaths of the foetus, new- born or deaths where the baby is born dead and there is an increased chance of the babies having birth defects. In the IVF procedure a hormone called gonadotropin (GnRH) is given to the female to stimulate the ovaries to release oocytes. In obese patients, their obesity negatively affects the ovaries responsiveness to this hormonal stimulant leading to doctors having to administrate an increased dose of the hormone and the duration of stimulation is increased. Less mature oocytes are harvested. Moreover, obesity leads to decreased pregnancy rates after IVF and a smaller chance of the oocyte implanting to the uterine wall. They also have an increased chance of the cycle being cancelled.  Damage from lipotoxicity  An overload of fatty acids in the body due to increased ingestion can lead to lipotoxicity. These extra fatty acids are not stored by the body and instead they circulate and damage the surrounding tissue. Levels of excess Fatty acids are higher in obese women. The fatty acid will damage other cells, except for the adipocytes, by producing more reactive oxygen species. This causes the cell to self-destruct (apoptosis). = Stress =  Psychological stress  Psychological stress can contribute both directly and indirectly to decreased oocyte quality. Increased stress leads to an increased production and release of cortisol, a stress hormone, which directly inhibits the biosynthesis of estradiol in the ovary. A decrease in estradiol as well as oxidative stress leads to apoptosis of the granulosa cells off the oocyte which deteriorates oocyte quality.

In female mammals each ovulatory cycle , or menstrual cycle in humans, a set number of ovarian follicles ovulate, each follicle releasing an egg that can be fertilised. If that female become pregnant, this is the number of offspring she would have. The ovulated follicles come from a larger pool of growing follicles Follicle dominance results from competition between follicles from this growing pool, as only some will be selected for further development. These selected follicles are known as the dominant follicles. In humans, there is usually only one dominant follicle per cycle. Understanding this system allows medical practitioners to manipulate this process in women in order to help those who have reduced fertility though assisted reproductive technologies (ART). These treatments are able to help women with conditions such as polycystic ovary syndrome (PCOS) who have reduced fertility be able to conceive. These techniques can also be used in animal conservation and agriculture.  Underlying biology  = Ovary = The ovary is a female reproductive organ which produces eggs for reproduction and hormones that are essential for this process. Within the ovary, there are ovarian follicles which contain immature eggs. = Ovulation = Ovulation is a process where ovarian follicles rupture, releasing eggs that can be fertilized. Follicle dominance results due to competition between follicles, as only some will be selected for further development, which are known as the dominant follicle(s). During development some follicles are further ahead in development. The more developed follicles will have more blood vessels in theca of follicle, which means they will have more hormones such as FSH available to cross over the basement membrane into the follicle. They also have more FSH receptors and their mural granulosa cells have started to express LH receptors. Follicles that have these properties become dominant which occurs just as circulating FSH levels are falling. Dominant follicle selection is driven by multiplication of cells (proliferation) and cell death (apoptosis) events. Only the largest, most developed follicles are able to withstand the drop in hormones, therefore only the selected follicles survive, the rest go through atresia (follicle death). In humans, when follicles mature, usually only one becomes dominant. Only the dominant follicle(s) goes through ovulation, therefore there is usually only a single ovulation during each human menstrual cycle. The more mature follicles that are more sensitive to FSH, can use it to produce inhibin and estrogen through increasing aromatase activity. When levels of circulating FSH drop in response to estrogen levels rising, only the most sensitive follicles to FSH will be able to survive on these low levels. When levels of FSH fall, it is too low to stimulate the other follicles which then go through atresia = Feedback loop = The hypothalamic-pituitary-ovary axis controls female reproduction. The fall in FSH occurs through an endocrine loop that the dominant follicle causes.  Disorders  In polycystic ovarian syndrome (PCOS), the follicle dominance process is disrupted, and a large number follicles continue to develop each menstrual cycle  Applications  Sometimes follicular dominance is manipulated to allow more follicles to ovulate. This manipulation is known as Assisted Reproductive Technology (ART). It is a group of scientific techniques used to help infertile couples conceive. This happens via in-vitro fertilization (IVF). IVF is the process of fertilizing an egg with sperm outside of the body in a laboratory which will then be planted into the mother‚Äôs or a surrogate‚Äôs womb. There are several steps involved in IVF. The first is oocyte collection. This is done by hyperstimulation of the ovary to produce multiple ovarian follicles that will release oocytes into the fallopian tubes. These oocytes are then collected via transvaginal oocyte retrieval. The oocytes are then combined with spermatozoa and fertilized. Sometimes the sperm may need to be directly injected into the oocyte via intracytoplasmic sperm injection. The embryos are the grown in the laboratory for 2‚Äì5 days before being implanted into the cavity of the uterus  References  Category:Reproduction in mammals Category:Menstrual cycle ","title":"Ovarian follicle dominance"},{"id":"61879104","text":"Novokiyevka () is a rural locality (a selo) in Altaysky Selsoviet, Tabunsky District, Altai Krai, Russia.

This number is at its peak in early pregnancy but declines at parturition.  Morphology  = General = Most studies of uNKs use murine cells to model the human equivalent: unless stated otherwise, this section focuses on murine uNKs only. uNKs are large, granular, rounded or oval lymphocytes. On microscopic examination, they may have one or more cytoplasmic projections and/or be binucleate. Characteristically they contain eosinophilic granules that stain darkly with PAS, indicating the presence of glycoproteins. These granules usually appear regular (but some can be irregularly shaped), and they grow in size and number until approximately 2 weeks of gestation. Granules differ between species, with rat uNK cells displaying an increased number of small granules than murine cells. Rat uNK morphology also differs from the mouse due to the common occurrence of myelin within the granules. In all species, as active cells, they have numerous prominent organelles including mitochondria, well-developed golgi apparatus, free ribosomes and rough endoplasmic reticulum. = Receptors and surface proteins = Human uNKs share many of the surface receptors and proteins of circulating Natural Killer (cNK) cells, exhibiting high levels of CD94 and CD56. However, they possess a unique expression profile of certain proteins, specifically CD9, CD103 (an integrin) and killer immunoglobulin-like receptors (KIRs). Notably, mouse models suggest that they lack CD16 and L-selectin, proteins that are prominent on pNKs. There are also integrin families present in the membrane of uNK cells (Œ±5Œ≤1, Œ±4Œ≤1 and Œ±6Œ≤1), the binding of which (by ligands fibronectin, VCAM-1 and laminin respectively) induces certain uNK-specific effects (see ‚ÄòFunctions of uNK cells‚Äô). As with cNKs, uNKs also express ILT genes (immunoglobulin-like transcripts) and the recently discovered NCRs (natural cytotoxicity receptors).  Origin  In humans, the uNK cell population is low during the proliferative phase of the menstrual cycle. The number of uNK cells increases post-ovulatory by the migration of circulating NK cells, as well as differentiation of haematopoietic stem cells. The population of NK cells in the uterine tissue will only persist if pregnancy occurs. = Origin of uNK cells during pregnancy = Based on studies using mouse models, both tissue resident Natural Killer (NK) cells and cNK cells are thought to contribute to the uNK cell population during pregnancy. The origin of uNK cells has been suggested to occur in two phases dependent on the stage of uterine tissue remodelling. At the onset of decidualisation, local proliferation of tissue resident NK cells occurs with little involvement from circulating NK cells. During the formation of the placenta (placentation), circulating NK cells are recruited.  Functions  uNK cells have an important role during pregnancy in both, humans and in mice. However, unlike NK cells, uNK‚Äôs do not have a fundamental role in the innate immune system and therefore, are not cytotoxic. Throughout pregnancy, there is adaptation of the uterus to allow the growth of the foetus to occur. Studies in mice have shown that uNK have a key role in this remodelling. During the remodelling, spiral arteries undergo structural changes to allow adequate nutritional substances to supply the growing foetus. In the mouse uNK cells were also found to produce growth-promoting factors which are important in early development before the placenta is fully formed.  Localisation  uNKs accumulate during pregnancy, and this is thought to be the result of a two-wave process, beginning with proliferation of tissue resident natural killer cells (trNK) in the decidua basalis, with minimal contribution to this pool from circulating natural killer cells (cNK) from the blood stream. Later during placentation, cNKs are thought to be recruited to aid with vascular remodelling. These cells are attracted to the uterus during pregnancy independent of chemokine receptors CCR-2 and CCR-5 in spite of these being important in recruitment of other inflammatory responses, and the exact method of their homing is yet to be understood.  Role in disease  uNKs secrete trophoblast invasion promoting cytokines (IL-8 and IP-10) and various angiogenic factors required for remodelling maternal spinal arteries in order to support sufficient perfusion of the placenta in later pregnancy. Failure of this to occur can lead to miscarriage or pre-eclampsia.

After 1945 she became one of the country's leading ballet teachers. She was a founder of the National Ballet School (\\"Szko≈Ça Baletowa\\") in Pozna≈Ñ. Biography Olga Prorubnikow- Lipczy≈Ñska was born in Lviv, which at that time was the principal city of Galicia, a frontier region of the Austro-Hungarian empire. It was widely regarded as a Polish city and after 1918 most of the German minority left as Lviv was incorporated into the newly re-established Polish Republic. Olga Prorubnikow's decision to become a dancer came early, and when she was seven she became a pupil at the Warsaw Ballet School, attached to the Grand Theatre. Piotr Zajlich was among her first teachers. She graduated in 1932 at which point she took \\"Olga S≈Çawska\\" as her stage name. She worked as a soloist dancer at the Grand Theatre from 1932 till 1937, becoming a \\"prima ballerina\\" (\\"primabalerina\\") in 1935. From 1934 she was taking part, with the Warsaw Opera Company, in ballet performances of Copp√©lia (alternating with Barbara Karczmarewicz in the lead role as Swanildƒô) and Nutcracker. She was also featuring from early on in the ballet sequences incorporated into classic opera performances, including Carmen, Aida, Traviata and Faust. In 1933 she took part in the International Dance Competition held that year in Warsaw, winning a gold medal. On that occasion, she also won a special prize as the best Polish dancer, which was funded personally by the jury chairman, Rolf de Mar√©. She also won a bronze medal at a dance competition held in Vienna and an \\"Olympic Ring\\" in the Dance Olympics held as part of the 1936 Berlin Olympic Games. In the light of her international success it was only to be expected that when, in 1937, the Polish National Ballet was revived, S≈Çawska became one of its stars. The new company traveled abrod extensively: she and appeared with them on stages in Paris, London, Berlin, Marseilles, Lyons, Brussels, Luxembourg, Kaunas and New York. Commentators noted her \\"girlish bneauty\\" (\\"dziewczƒôco piƒôkna\\"). The National Ballet was, among other things, an instrument of \\"soft-power diplomacy\\" at a time when the \\"hard power\\" of Poland's neighbouring states was growing ever more menacing, and S≈Çawska made a particular feature, before the international audiences, of dancing to the opening theme of the iconic Chopin E-Minor Piano Concerto. In September 1939, at the dawn of what would otherwise have been the peak decade of Olga S≈Çawska's career, the invasion of Poland from the west by Nazi Germany and, two weeks later, from the east and south by Soviet Russia marked the start of the Second World War and put an end to her professional ambitions for the foreseeable future. She also faced a second personal tragedy at this time. She had recently become engaged to be married to the wealthy industrialist- politician Tadeusz Karszo-Siedlewski. Rejecting the opportunity to go abroad, Tadeusz Karszo-Siedlewski remained in Warsaw following the German and Soviet invasions and was killed there in a German air-raid on 24 September 1939. A couple of weeks before he was killed Karszo-Siedlewski drew up a new will in which he left a substantial amount of property to his finac√©e. She, therefore, found herself the owner of K.R.Vetter, a substantial brewery in Lublin, and of \\"Mon Plaisir\\", a comfortable villa in the then fashionable suburb on the edge of Warsaw known at that time as B≈Çota. It is not clear how much practical benefit she received from her new property, however, since her late fianc√©'s will was only finalised in 1946, by means of a court settlement with the Karszo-Siedlewski family, shortly after which the brewery was taken over by the new Polish government. Olga S≈Çawska(-Lipczy≈Ñska)'s marriage to Micha≈Ç Lipczy≈Ñski in 1941 was followed by the births of the couple's three sons, Grzegorz, Pawe≈Ç and Piotr. After the war S≈Çawska-Lipczy≈Ñska, now retired completely from her stage work, devoted her energies to teaching, working at the fringes of the theatre world to create love and respect for the theatrical arts. As part of this she organised dance groups in community centres. In 1945 the frontiers of Polish had changed dramatically, with the eastern third of the country (including Lviv, where S≈Çawska had been born) becoming part of the Soviet Union and the eastern third of Germany becoming part of Poland. The changes were accompanied by massive ethnic cleansing programmes of during 1944/46. In the north, Danzig, which since 1308 had functioned (not without recurring tensions) as a multi-cultural city, became Polish, and it was here that in 1950 Olga S≈Çawska-Lipczy≈Ñska took a post as a teacher of classical dance at the Choreographic Academy (\\"Liceum Choreograficznym\\" ). In 1951 plans were unfolded for an equivalent institution to be opened in Pozna≈Ñ. Olga S≈Çawska-Lipczy≈Ñska became a founder and creator of the National Ballet School (\\"Szko≈Ça Baletowa\\") in Pozna≈Ñ, managing the school in the key position as artistic director till 1970, following which she stayed on as a teacher of classical dance (\\"...od ta≈Ñca klasycznego\\") till 1973. One of the ways in which she was able to ensure the highest standards at the Pozna≈Ñ ballet school involved recruitment. She was able to attract and select some of Poland's leading exponents of dance. Her appointees to the teaching staff included Barbara Kostrzewska and Teresa Kujawa. Celebrities from the world of Polish ballet from among her former pupils include Ewa Wycichowska and Juliusz Sta≈Ñda. Polish ballet is also indebted to S≈Çawska-Lipczy≈Ñska for her 1952 translation of Agrippina Vaganova's text book \\"Zasady ta≈Ñca klasycznego\\" (\\"Principles of Classical Dance\\") which has become a near-universal primer for Polish teachers of classical dance. Olga S≈Çawska-Lipczy≈Ñska died at Pozna≈Ñ on 29 April 1991 meaning that, perhaps appropriately, her death coincided with that year's International Dance Day. The dance academy was renamed in her honour, \\"Og√≥lnokszta≈ÇcƒÖca Szko≈Ça Baletowa im. Olgi S≈Çawskiej-Lipczy≈Ñskiej\\".

He was a leader of the East River Column, an anti-Japanese guerrilla force in Guangdong during the Second Sino-Japanese War. From 1981 to 1983 he served as Governor of Guangdong, where he was a strong supporter of economic reform and worked to exonerate Guangdong cadres who had been unjustly punished during the \\"anti-localism movement\\" in the 1950s.  Early life and wartime career  Liu was born in Guang'an, Sichuan, in October 1908, during the late Qing dynasty. He joined the Communist Youth League of China in 1934, and participated in anti-Japanese movement in Shanghai. In December 1935, he was arrested by the Kuomintang government for his activities. After Japan launched a full-scale attack on Shanghai in August 1937 at the beginning of the Second Sino-Japanese War, Liu was released and enlisted in the 8th Group Army of the National Revolutionary Army to fight in the war. In May 1939, Liu transferred to Guangdong province, where he helped organize Communist guerrillas to fight the Japanese. He served as Political Commissar of the Guangdong People's Anti-Japanese Guerrillas, also known as the , commanded by Zeng Sheng. After the surrender of Japan in 1945, the East River Column moved north to Shandong, and was reorganized as the Liangguang (Guangdong-Guangxi) Column of the Communist Party's Third Field Army. Liu served as Deputy Director of the Political Department of the Liangguang Column. During the Chinese Civil War, Liu fought in major battles including the , the Battle of Jinan, and the Huaihai campaign. In September 1949, he moved with the Liangguang Column back south to participate in the battle for Guangdong.  People's Republic of China  After the founding of the People's Republic of China in October 1949, Liu was appointed Party Chief of Gaozhou- Leizhou prefecture, and organized logistical support for the Battle of Hainan Island. He worked in economic development of Guangdong province after 1956. Liu served as Secretary of Guangdong Provincial Party Committee from 1960 to 1965, as well as Vice Governor of Guangdong from 1963 to 1965. After the Cultural Revolution, when Governor Xi Zhongxun was transferred to Beijing in November 1980, he appointed Liu, then 72 years old, as his successor. As governor, Liu advocated the cause of the Guangdong cadres who had suffered during the \\"anti-localism movement\\" in the 1950s. As an outsider who had worked for four decades in the province, he proclaimed that there were no anti-outsider sentiments among native Cantonese cadres. Without explicitly naming him, he blamed Tao Zhu for the unfair treatment of the Cantonese. Partly due to intervention from Liu and Hu Yaobang, the Central Committee of the Communist Party of China set up a special committee to reinvestigate the matter. In 1994, the committee exonerated the victimized Guangdong cadres, especially their leader , who had died in prison during the Cultural Revolution. Liu was a stalwart supporter of economic reforms and Guangdong's local interests. However, he only served as governor for two years due to his advanced age. He was replaced by Liang Lingguang in 1983, and became a member of the Central Advisory Commission. Liu and his successors Liang and Ye Xuanping were all considered reform pioneers who propelled the economic development of Guangdong in the 1980s. Liu was a member of the 12th and 13th National Congress of the Communist Party of China. He was also a delegate to the 5th National People's Congress. Liu died on 21 April 2002 in Guangzhou, aged 93.

She ceded it in turn to her youngest son, Conrad Ditlev, Baron Knuth of Conradsborg. He spent much of his time at Fredsholm after his retirement from the Supreme Court and died on the estate in 1805. He was succeeded by his son, Carl Conrad Gustav Knuth, who died in 1819. =19th century= The old building seen on a lithography by Ferdinand Richardt Fredsholm was then sold to Simon Andersen Dons and Johan Ferdinand de Neergaard who later that same year sold the estate to S√∏ren Henrik Lund- Lund immediately embarked on reclaiming the bay between Vejl√∏ and Fredsholm and the project was later completed by his son Henrik August Lund. The successful endeavour inspired Henrik August Lund to engage in further reclamation projects, but this resulted in a dispute with the citizens of Nakskov. Lund lost the trial which was appealed all the way to the Supreme Court. =20th century= In 1840, Henrik August Lund sold Fredsholm to August Villads Bech. Bech tried to continue the reclamation project but soon relented and sold the estate to Carl Henrik Jacob Jensen in 1847. In 1865, he sold the reclamation right to two brothers named Casse. They managed to reclaim approximately 300 hectares of new land. Carl Henrik Jacob Jensen struggled with economic difficulties. In 1890, he had to ceded Fredsholm to Lollands Spare- og Laanebank. The bank later that same year sold the restate to Frederik Georg B√∏ttern. Lars og Peter Rasmussen, two brothers who had already leased Fredsholm for some time, bought the estate in 1908. Lars Rasmussen's descendants owned it until 1991. Architecture The current main building was constructed in 1917-1918 from designs by Daniel Rasmussen. It is a simple, two-storey red brick building with a tower-like central projection on the western facade. The building has a half-hipped red tile roof. Today Fredsholm is today owned by Fredsholm Gods A/S. The estate covers 501 hectares of land.

It was officially established on January 14, 1836 and modeled after the United States Marines Corps.  History  The Republic of Texas Marine Corps, also known as Texas Navy Marine or Marine Corps of the Republic of Texas, was a branch of the Texas Navy, based heavily on the United States Marine Corps of the time. The branch was only suggested under the Act and Decree Establishing a Navy, which was passed on 25 November 1835. Nonetheless, after Governor James W. Robinson wrote to the General Council, urging for the formal establishment of a Marine Corps on 14 January 1836, did the commissioning and recruiting of officers and enlists begin. However, the Marines were lacking in numbers, with over 350 enlists and 18 officers in the Corps before the Texas annexation into the United States. Every vessel of the Texas Navy had a dedicated Marine Guard composed of several marines and a commander. These guards were responsible for maintaining appropriate behavior among seamen on their respective vessels; and for ensuring the protection of their vessels when docked. However, Marines were also sharpshooters and boarders during engagements, with the sole duty of securing the enemy vessel's deck and then moving in to secure other areas of the ship. A worthy representation of this would be with the guard aboard the Liberty vessel, which swiftly boarded and secured the Mexican Pelicano on 3 March 1836. Despite being a well-respected branch during the second phase of the Texas- Mexican conflict, the reputation of the Marine Corps deteriorated when, on 11 February 1842, the guard aboard the San Antonio mutinied along with some of the crew, killing Lieutenant Charles Fuller, the only person killed during the mutiny. The mutiny on the San Antonio was the only one in the branch's history. On 29 December 1845, President of the United States James Polk signed a joint resolution, which admitted Texas as the twenty-eighth state of the Union, as of that resolution, the Texas Navy and Marine Corps ceased to exist.  Horse Marines  The Horse Marines were a volunteer Texas Ranger group formed in 1836. They were led by Major Isaac Watts Burton and ordered by General Thomas J. Rusk to patrol the Texas coast between the mouth of the Guadalupe and Mission Bay for defense against retaliatory raids and expeditions by Mexico following the Battle of San Jacinto.
