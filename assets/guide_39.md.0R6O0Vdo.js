She was associated with the Group of Seven early in her career, but later moved away into a more individualistic style. She was active in associations of artist and worked for the professionalization of their occupation. Life Roselyn Margaret Kenny was born in Renfrew, Ontario, in 1891. She was one of the first women to be admitted to the Ontario College of Art to study under Arthur Lismer. She won a scholarship each year from 1920 to 1924. Courtice was the librarian at the Ontario College of Art from 1925 to 1926, and for ten years was assistant instructor for children's classes under Lismer. She also studied puppets and stagecraft under Tony Sarg at the Art Institute of Chicago in 1927, and continued to study these subjects in New York, London and Paris. She was assistant instructor to John William Beatty at the Port Hope Summer School. She taught at the Doon School of Art. She and John Alford taught the teachers' summer course. In 1950 Courtice studied at Hans Hofmann‚Äôs summer school in Provincetown, Massachusetts. Courtice was first married to Henry Lloyd Hammond, a lieutenant in the Royal Air Force who was killed in action on 4 August 1918. Her second marriage was to Andrew Roy Courtice. She died in 1973. Work Whitefish Falls in 1936. Top row: Randolph Hewton, Mr. Whittall, Charles Comfort, Yvonne McKague Housser. Middle row: Isabel McLaughlin, Gordon Webber, Bennie Hewton. Bottom row: Hal Hayden, Audrey Taylor, Prudence Heward, Rody Kenny Courtice, Mr. Macdonald. Courtice was one of the first women to participate in the Canadian modernist movement. She was invited to exhibit with the Group of Seven. Courtice made many landscapes in a similar style to the members of the Group of Seven. She was not always serious about this. Yvonne McKague Housser remembers going with Courtice on a sketching trip in the north where they could not find any scenery that interested them. Courtice assembled a tree trunk, branches and rocks into a still life, which she called \\"a Lawren Harris\\". The two women each painted it as though it were a panoramic landscape, and described it as a landscape when they sold their paintings. Later Courtice moved away from the Group of Seven, and exhibited solo or with other women artists. She became a member of the Canadian Group of Painters, which was founded in 1933. Courtice contributed illustrations to The Kingdom of Saguenay (1936) by Marius Barbeau, as did A. Y. Jackson, George Pepper, Kathleen Daly, Peter Haworth, Bobs Cogill Haworth, Andr√© Charles Bi√©ler, Arthur Lismer, Gordon Edward Pfeiffer, Yvonne McKague and Albert Edward Cloutier. She accompanied Housser and Isabel McLaughlin on trips to locations such as Cobalt, Gowganda, Nipissing and Kirkland Lake in the 1930s, where they painted industrial subjects. Her work could have a political content. The Game () depicts war as a game in a toy theatre, with black, white and red chess pieces on a board decorated with a hammer and sickle. Courtice exhibited at the Tate Gallery, London, in Brazil, in New York at the World‚Äôs Fair of 1939, at the Riverside Museum and at the American- British Gallery, New York. She had a solo show at Victoria College, Toronto in 1951. A review of the work by the Canadian Group of Painters at the 1939 World Fair said \\"These ... are vital and young and imaginative ... Some of the artists are rather more expressionistic ... still others are more interested in highly inventive sophisticated pattern, among them Rody Kenny Courtice with his Just Cows, or in near-primitive fantasy, like Paraskeva Clark.\\" Associations Courtice was a member of the Royal Canadian Academy of Arts, the Ontario Society of Artists, the Canadian Society of Painters in Water Colour and the Canadian Society of Graphic Art. She became an executive member of the Heliconian Club. She was president of the Ontario branch of the Federation of Canadian Artists from 1945 to 1946. The Federation was a lobbying organization founded after the Kingston Conference of Canadian Artists in 1941. Courtice, women artists such as Yvonne McKague Housser and Elizabeth Wyn Wood, and their male colleagues, worked towards gaining increasing public support for the arts, leading to state sponsorship of professional artists.

History A small villa previously stood at the site. Prince Giuseppe Beretta, Duke of Simari and Marquis of Mesagne, commissioned designs for a new building from the architect Ferdinando Fuga, and in 1762 the villa was completed. In 1768, the prince gave a sumptuous party in honour of the King Ferdinand IV of Naples and his new wife, the Habsburg Maria Carolina of Austria, just arrived from Vienna. The Queen liked the villa that reminded her of Vienna's Sch√∂nbrunn palace and since then was called ‚ÄúFavorita‚Äù (favoured). In 1792, the King acquired and expanded the villa, and obtained access to the sea through a great park from the main building on the street to the sea and a pier for the access by boat. It was frequently used by the royal couple and their children. The second son of the King, Prince Leopold, Prince of Salerno, while living there enlarged the palace and built some pavillons for entertainment, such as the Casino of mosaics (so called after its interior decoration with mother-of-pearl and porcelain scraps). He created an amusement park in the grounds. From 1879 and 1885 Villa Favorita hosted the exiled Isma'il Pasha, former Khedive of Egypt who had presided over the inauguration of Suez Canal. He decorated the interiors of some of his apartments with a Moorish style. With a facade overlooking an urban street, the much dilapidated palace is a prime examples of the villas in the Miglio d'Oro or Golden Mile of Villas that occupied the eastern slopes of Vesuvius. The interiors were decorated and frescoed by Domenico Ascione and Filippo De Pascale. The interiors were highly decorated in a florid Rococo style, with stucco, woodwork, mirrors and glasswork. Rooms and halls were painted in various themes and styles, including Etruscan decorations, a stanza of Bacchus and Story of Abraham, and a room (c. 1765) in chinoiserie style. Much of this decoration has been lost. Some stanza retain their fresco decoration including ones by Crescenzo Gamba.Villa Favorita ad Ercolano , StoriaCity, Storia dell'Architettura e della citt√† Fabio cerrao e Cerbone degli errichiello - 2012.InCampania entry on villa.

The film stars Bateman, Nicole Kidman and Christopher Walken. The film was released on April 29, 2016, by Starz Digital. Plot The film opens on Baxter and Annie Fang (Jack McCarthy and Mackenzie Smith) holding hands in the back of their parents' car as their father Caleb (Jason Butler Harner) dons a security guard uniform. The family enters a bank and Baxter uses a gun to rob a teller of all her lollipops. Baxter shoots his gun when Caleb rushes him, while posing as a security guard. Their mother Camille (Kathryn Hahn) pretends to be shot, and Annie grieves over her prone body. When the family gets up and leaves, Caleb gives a speech to the bank patrons about cherishing life and takes a bow. The adult Annie (Nicole Kidman) is a successful actress on a film set where the director has surprised her by asking her to go topless in a scene. After initially refusing, she returns to the set without her top. A crew member snaps her photo and sells it to a tabloid. The adult Baxter (Jason Bateman) sees the photos in a convenience store. He is out of sorts after having published two novels, and he accepts a job writing about potato guns. Baxter gets drunk with his subjects and allows them to perform the William Tell trick on him, which results in him getting shot in the ear and hospitalized. The Fangs reunite due to Baxter's injury. Caleb enlists Annie and Baxter, whom he calls \\"A and B\\", into a new piece of performance art. Annie hands out fake coupons for free chicken sandwiches at an open air food court. Caleb tasks Baxter with filming the chaos that will ensue when the cashier declines to honor them and customers get mad. To his dismay, the cashier gives free sandwiches to everyone who asks for one. Caleb becomes irate, while Annie and Baxter feel that their parents have lost whatever artistic merit they used to have. During their reunion, Annie watches old tapes of the family's performance art, as well as a documentary about her parents shot by Hobart Waxman (Harris Yulin). The film captures Caleb's sophomoric and didactic performance pieces, like shooting Hobart with a crossbow. Annie also recalls another piece that featured her and Baxter performing outsider music in Central Park with songs like \\"KAP (Kill All Parents)\\". Camille and Caleb heckle the kids, which horrifies the small crowd of onlookers. Later, the family laughs about the piece. After a short while, Caleb and Camille disappear. Their car is found with blood on the dashboard. Annie tells the cops that the blood is fake and the disappearance is just another of Caleb's pieces. Baxter does not think it matters either way and is simply convinced that they have probably seen the last of their parents. Annie becomes obsessed with solving their disappearance. Annie recalls a performance of Romeo and Juliet in her senior year of high school where Romeo could not make the performance. Baxter was tasked with standing in for him, but he balked at having to kiss his sister onstage. He reluctantly agrees to do it, but when the audience laughs at his attempts to avoid kissing Annie, she is humiliated. Baxter finally gives Annie a fully romantic kiss onstage to the horror of the principal. He fires the drama teacher, Miss Delano (Linda Emond), who reveals to Annie and Baxter that losing her job was worth it to be a part of one of Caleb and Camille's more elaborate pieces. Annie and Baxter are horrified to realize that they were unwittingly made to kiss, and that was the beginning of the end of their performances with their parents. Later, in the documentary, Caleb confesses that until he realized he could use his children as living art, he was uninterested in being a father. When the siblings are having a yard sale, they put on one of their parents CDs by a band called the Vengeful Virgins. They are stunned to hear a cover of \\"KAP\\", which was known only to the Fangs. They track down the teenage twin brothers in the band, and Annie interrogates them about the song while Baxter searches their house. He finds a videotape of Caleb cutting open his arm and smearing blood on the dashboard of his car. A short time later, Miss Delano comes home and reveals she is the boys' mother. Caleb enters the house behind her, and he reluctantly agrees to take Annie and Baxter to see their mother. Caleb and Camille reveal that they have been planning this final piece for years. Caleb has spent time living together with Miss Delano as husband and wife, and accidentally fathered the twin boys. Camille has been spending time in a remote small town, posing as a widow for several months of each year. They had each established separate identities and believed that this final piece would be a fitting end to their career. They beg Annie and Baxter to help them keep their secret. The siblings are bitter over the betrayal but agree to hide the truth. The film shows Annie and Baxter seemingly happier and more well- balanced after letting go of their parents.

Coolhaus ice cream is made at a 20% overrun compared to the 50% industry standard for super-premium ice cream, giving it a creamier, smoother and richer taste. In a People and Things Mag interview, Case explains that Coolhaus products are \\"all-natural, handmade and organic whenever possible\\". Coolhaus uses hormone-free, Real California Milk, and fair-trade chocolate. Coolhaus supports responsible sourcing by using seasonal ingredients to maximize the flavors and engage customers with seasonally- themed marketing campaigns. Coolhaus is also a certified woman-owned business. As of September 2017, Coolhaus distributes in 6,000+ grocery stores ranging from Whole Foods Market to Safeway stores with 24 SKU's including hand-crafted ice cream sandwiches, artisan pints and chocolate-dipped bars. Coolhaus also operates food trucks in Los Angeles, New York City and Dallas, and two scoop shops in the region of Greater Los Angeles (a flagship shop in Culver City and a kiosk at Indiana Colony in Old Town Pasadena). In an Inc. Magazine interview by Laurel Mintz, Founder and CEO of Elevate My Brand, Case describes how Coolhaus plans to become \\"the signature millennial ice cream brand\\". Coolhaus and its entrepreneurial story has received coverage from CNN Money, CNBC, and USA Today. With inventive flavors such as Milkshake and Fries and Street Cart Churro Dough, InStyle called Coolhaus the \\"ice cream brand for every craving imaginable\\". History Norman Bananas Foster pint, named after British architect Norman Foster and composed of banana ice cream and a butter-y rum dulce de leche reduction swirl While studying architecture at UC Berkeley and then in graduate school at UCLA, co-founder Natasha Case explored a concept she called \\"Farchitecture\\", or Food + Architecture. After graduation, she worked as a Disney Imagineer and continued toying with Farchitecture as a hobby‚Äîshe made cookies and ice cream, and named the combinations after architects. Case met business partner Freya Estreller through friends, who told them they had \\"the same kind of brain\\". Estreller liked the idea of architecturally-themed ice cream sandwiches and together they turned the \\"art project\\" into a business. Having studied finance at Cornell and worked in real estate development, Estreller helped greatly with financial modeling and business operations. Coolhaus was founded in April 2009 on the principle of using Farchitecture to \\"bring architecture to the people\\". By playfully naming Coolhaus creations after architects and architectural movements, Case hoped to inspire people to talk and learn more about architecture. \\"We think of ourselves as a marketing company for architects,\\" Case told Architect Magazine. Flavors like \\"Mintimalism\\", \\"Frank Behry\\", and \\"Norman Bananas Foster\\" pay tribute to the Minimalist architectural movement and architects Frank Gehry and Norman Foster. The company name, Coolhaus, is itself a triple entendre, playing off of: \\"There's definitely an architecture to the sandwich,\\" Case told NPR. The bottom cookie is the foundation and must be pliable enough not to crumble, and the top cookie must be soft enough not to push the ice cream out when bitten. Case expressed her desire to use the concept of Farchitecture to \\"bring architectural knowledge to the masses\\" and shows her interest in design by creating marketing material and packaging for Coolhaus products. Mintimalism sammie, composed of Double Chocolate cookies and Dirty Mint Chip ice cream The co-founders launched the company with a $10,000 initial investment: they bought a 20-year-old postal van off Craigslist, converted it into a food truck, and used it to sell ice cream sandwiches at the popular Coachella Valley Music and Arts Festival. Although the truck had a faulty engine‚Äîit had to be towed to the festival and back‚Äîexposure to an audience of 160,000 made the outing a success. Coolhaus subsequently went viral with Twitter followers and inquiries from the Los Angeles Times and other media outlets. Case left her job at Disney within a month and a half and committed full-time to Coolhaus. After Coachella, Coolhaus fixed its silver and bubblegum-pink truck and continued to grow. Like Kogi Korean BBQ and other new-wave food trucks entering the scene, Coolhaus' \\"reinvention\\" of the ice cream truck was hip and social-media savvy, using Twitter to broadcast locations and engage customers. Coolhaus added trucks in Austin, Texas, in 2010 and New York City in 2011, and opened its first storefront in Culver City, California, in 2011. By 2012, Coolhaus' fleet of ten trucks and one food cart had expanded to Miami, Florida, and Fast Company described Coolhaus as \\"the first gourmet branded truck with a national reach\\". Since then, Coolhaus has rapidly expanded its range of products and distribution channels, with an increased focus on retail distribution of prepackaged goods. In an interview with Entrepreneur, Case explained that retail distribution allows Coolhaus to reach as many consumers as possible, and gives the company a scalable business model in which \\"you grow the revenue tremendously without necessarily increasing overhead.\\" Coolhaus went from 3 Whole Foods retail partner stores in spring 2011 carrying 4 SKU's, to over 2,000 by June 2014 and 2,500 by September 2014, carrying 24 SKU's as of December 2017. According to Case, Coolhaus stands apart from its competitors \\"because of our tri-fold approach in the marketplace: trucks, brick and mortar AND wholesale distribution. I haven't seen any truck diversify like with have with channels in grocery stores, movie theaters, stadiums and fashion retailers.\\" Estreller estimates that over one million Coolhaus sammies were consumed in 2013 and projects nearly $6 million in revenue for 2014. Forbes magazine named Case to its \\"30 Under 30\\" for Food & Wine, a list of \\"the field's brightest stars under the age of 30\\", in 2012. That same year, restaurant surveyor Zagat also recognized Case on its \\"30 Under 30\\" list of \\"rising stars\\" in New York City's food scene. Co-founders Case and Estreller became engaged in 2011, married in 2012, and made Zagat's Valentine's Day list of \\"LA's 10 Sweetest Culinary Power Couples\\" in 2014. Reception Assorted flavors of Coolhaus prepackaged sammies Coolhaus and its entrepreneurial story have received coverage from Good Morning America, Forbes, Entrepreneur, and other nationwide media outlets. With inventive flavors such as Fried Chicken & Waffles and Goat's Milk Caramel Mascarpone Rosemary, Coolhaus has received widespread attention in newspapers, magazines, television, and social media. Vogue Road Food critic Jeffrey Steingarten stated that Coolhaus \\"...produces and sells the best ice cream sandwiches in culinary history\\". Every Day with Rachael Ray conducted a taste test of frozen chocolate desserts, and selected Coolhaus' IM Pei-Nut Butter (named after architect I. M. Pei) as the Best Sandwich. Coolhaus has earned recognition in various Zagat features, and placed second in Zagat editors' 2012 ranking of New York's 8 Best Food Trucks. ABC's morning television show Good Morning America posted Coolhaus recipes on its website and teamed with the company to create its own, exclusive ice cream flavor, chosen by audience votes. Coolhaus also garnered attention from Martha Stewart Living Omnimedia, which hosted co-founders Case and Estreller on Everyday Food, and picked the pair as finalists for Martha Stewart's 2014 American Made awards. The Food Network show Kid in a Candy Store also followed Case behind the scenes to show Balsamic Fig & Mascarpone ice cream in the making. Coolhaus' public recognition can be attributed in part to its active participation on social media to engage its customers and cultivate a following. Case explained to Entrepreneur that Instagram is helpful for \\"sell[ing] people on well-styled images of artfully-prepared food\\", while Facebook is a great way to address the \\"clubhouse\\" of loyal fans. The company's national and local Twitter accounts are used to draw customers to Coolhaus food truck locations and alert them to special flavors of the day. The company also posts videos to its official YouTube channel, and engages customers on Pinterest and Tumblr with product, event, and architectural photos. Celebrities such as Justin Bieber, Zooey Deschanel, Brad Pitt, Angelina Jolie, and Johnny Depp have enlisted Coolhaus to cater events and have followed the company on social media. Distribution Co-founders Natasha Case and Freya Estreller in a Coolhaus ice cream truck , Coolhaus runs two Los Angeles-area storefronts in Old Town Pasadena and the Culver City Arts District, and operates a fleet of eleven mobile ice cream trucks and carts in Southern California, New York City, and Dallas. Prepackaged Coolhaus ice cream sammies, ice cream pints, and ice cream bars are sold in more than 2,500 retail stores and gourmet markets in over 45 states, including Whole Foods, Gelson's Markets, Sprouts Farmers Market, Earth Fare, Fairway Market, Safeway, Publix and Wegman's. Coolhaus ice cream sandwiches are also available on the dessert menu at all Umami Burger restaurants in California, and prepackaged products are sold in select Urban Outfitters and Quiksilver stores. Customers can also order Coolhaus products and services online, directly from Coolhaus' official website or via third-party websites such as FreshDirect and Goldbely, which allows ordering of customized sammies. Coolhaus ships frozen desserts by FedEx overnight, packed inside insulated shipping boxes with dry ice. Coolhaus Ice Cream Book The Coolhaus co-founders wrote Coolhaus Ice Cream Book with the help of Kathleen Squires, an established food writer. Published by Houghton Mifflin Harcourt in May 2014, it features easy recipes for recreating Coolhaus desserts at home, as well as the story of the company and biographies of famous architects who inspired some creations. In reviewing the book, the recipe editor for The Kitchn wrote: The book includes chapters for ice creams, gelatos, sorbets, cookies, toppings, and shakes. Ice cream recipes include Chocolate Orange Cointreau, Whiskey Lucky Charms, and Vegan Horchata.

Among its characters were Locomotive, Captain Tan, Valentina, Uncle Achilles, and the Malasombra Brothers. In 1970, when they had moved on to have their own program, the Locomotive character was removed and the clown Poquito, Filetto, Capocomico and the boy Barullo added. It was a popular series in Spain until the arrival of Los Payasos de la Tele in the early 1970s.

In direct lending, the borrowers are usually smaller or mid-sized companies, also called small and medium enterprises, rather than large, listed companies, and the lenders may be wealthy individuals or asset management firms. Peer-to-peer lending networks such as crowdfunding are sometimes considered part of the direct lending market and lend to very small companies. However, most asset managers involved in direct lending will consider loans only above a certain size, typically ‚Ç¨5 million or more. Aside from peer-to-peer networks, direct lending is therefore mainly focused on middle market borrowers. The market has grown in importance since around 2009 in response to banks reducing their lending activities to companies in the wake of the Financial crisis of 2007-08. There is little comprehensive data on the size of the market and the scale of the opportunity is disputed. The need for direct lending has been put at ‚Ç¨100 billion in Europe alone between 2013 and 2015. However, other sources report that in 2014 asset managers are struggling to find enough direct lending opportunities to invest in. Asset managers cite the higher returns available from direct lending strategies as a main reason that people should invest in direct lending. US pension funds are among the investor who are reported to have made allocations to direct lending strategies, especially in Europe. Several European governments have taken initiatives to boost direct lending to smaller companies since the financial crisis. For example, in 2012 the UK government introduced a scheme to lend ¬£700 million of public money to smaller companies in partnership with asset managers. A large number of asset management firms have started funds to invest in direct lending, and several US firms have targeted European direct lending since around the start of 2013.

The Honeywell Level 6 was a line of 16-bit minicomputers, later upgraded to 32-bit, manufactured by Honeywell, Inc. from the mid 1970s. In 1979 the Level 6 was renamed the DPS 6, subsequently DPS 6 Plus and finally DPS 6000. Description As initially introduced the Level 6 consisted of three models: the 6/06, the 6/34, and the 6/36. The CPU featured a real-time clock, a ROM bootstrap loader and 64 interrupt levels. The architecture provided a variety of addressing modes and 18 programmer-visible registers. Rack-mount and tabletop versions were available. These systems supported up to 64 K words (KW) of MOS memory with a cycle time or 650 nanoseconds. All three models all featured the Megabus, which was a proprietary asynchronous bus architecture. By 1978 the line had been extended downwards with the introduction of the 6/23 and 6/33, and upwards with the 6/43, 6/47, 6/53, and 6/57. The 6/23 did not support the Megabus. The 6/33 was the new entry-level upgradable model. The other four models supported up to 1 MW (Mega Words) of memory and 26 registers. A memory management unit (MMU), optional on the 6/43 and 6/47, and standard on the 6/53 and 6/57, supported memory segmentation and four protection rings. An optional Scientific Instruction Processor (SIP) added single- and double-precision hardware floating-point instructions. The 6/47 and 6/57 were enhanced versions of the 6/43 and 6/53 respectively which added a Commercial Instruction Processor (CIP) including 30 additional instructions for character-string manipulation and decimal arithmetic. Among the final developments in the line were the high-end 32-bit 6/95-1, 6/98-1 and dual processor 6/95-2 and 6/98-2 models. In the 1980s, Honeywell's Datanet 8 line of communications processors, often used as front-end processors for DPS 8 mainframes, shared many hardware components with DPS 6. Another specialised derivative of the Level 6 was the Honeywell Page Printing System. In June 1986, following Honeywell Information Systems' merger with Bull, Honeywell Bull introduced the DPS 6 Plus line of symmetric multiprocessing 32-bit systems, models 410 and 420 (code named MRX - Medium Range eXtended) with up to four processors.In 1987 they introduced the uniprocessor models 210 and 220 (code named LRX - Low Range eXtended), announced the HRX (High Range eXtended), and Computerworld reported that there were more than 50,000 DPS 6 systems installed worldwide. The HRX was introduced as the DPS 6000 600 series. Recognising the commercial success of Unix, in 1988 Honeywell Bull introduced an 80386-based Unix co-processor for the DPS 6 Plus 400 series. Software The operating system for the Level 6 was GCOS 6. * GCOS 6 Mod 200 was an entry version of the system oriented toward interactive data entry. * GCOS 6 Mod 400 was a batch operating system also used to run process-control applications. * GCOS 6 Mod 600 was a time- sharing operating system.

Lyrics The album's lyrics contain humor and wit, focusing on topics such as playing computer games and hanging out with friends. The lyrics are also more self-deprecating and apathetic than those of Let's Wrestle's previous songs. Critical reception The album received generally favorable reviews from critics.

She is currently signed with WWE on the NXT brand. She was the first woman to qualify for the finals of the television sports show American Ninja Warrior and the first woman to complete a City Finals course. Since signing with WWE, she has competed in the 2018 Mae Young Classic and participated in the 2019 Royal Rumble match.  Early life and education  Born in Glen Ridge, New Jersey, Catanzaro grew up and attended high school in nearby Belleville and is of Italian descent. She stands about 5 ft (1.524 m) tall and weighs . She began doing gymnastics at age 5. She attended Towson University in Towson, Maryland, from 2009 until 2012, studying early childhood education on an athletic scholarship.  Gymnastics career  = Junior Olympic = Catanzaro was a Junior Olympic gymnast, having started training at age 6. She reached level 10 in 2007 and competed at the 2007 New Jersey Level 10 State Championships where she placed fifth in the Senior-A division. The following year Catanzaro competed at the 2008 New Jersey Level 10 State Championships where she placed third and advanced to the 2008 Junior Olympic National Championships. She finished 23rd overall but finished 6th on the balance beam. = NCAA = Catanzaro competed in gymnastics for Towson in Division I of the National Collegiate Athletic Association. She made her debut in the 2009 season. Catanzaro helped the Towson Tigers gymnastics team win the Eastern College Athletic Conference Championships in 2009 and 2010. In her senior year she was named the Southeast Regional Gymnast of the Year in 2012. She was also named the 2012 Eastern College Athletic Conference Gymnast of the Year and was the top-ranked competitor in that conference for that year.  Obstacle competitor career  = Ninja glory = She worked for Alpha Warrior, an obstacle-course gym in San Antonio, Texas, from February 2013. Catanzaro spent two years training for American Ninja Warrior alongside her then-boyfriend and co- competitor Brent Steffensen. She did not complete the qualifying course in Venice, California, but was an invited wildcard at the 2013 finals, where she fell early on the Giant cycle/ring. In 2014, Catanzaro became the first woman to complete the qualifying course of American Ninja Warrior (season 6), making it up the warped wall on her second try at 5:26.18 at the Dallas qualifiers, ranking her 21 out of 30; this also makes her the first woman to make it up the warped wall in competition. Later in 2014, Catanzaro competed in the Dallas finals of American Ninja Warrior. She was the first woman ever to complete a city finals course (and the second woman to attempt it after Jessie Graff in season 5), qualifying for the national finals in Las Vegas with a time of 8 minutes, 59 seconds. (Not until five years later, during the 2019 season, was her accomplishment of a woman completing a City Finals course matched.)By Ninja veterans Michelle Warnky and Jesse \\"Flex\\" Labreck. Of the 2014 city finals run, host commentator Akbar Gbaja-Biamila remarked \\"I've seen greatness during my NFL career...And I've been in awe of people, but I am really in awe of Kacy\\". The run had been especially notable because due to her short stature, many of the obstacles looked difficult to manage and in one case, she had to leap between boards whereas other competitors could traverse them. Her achievement made her a social media phenomenon, with her run being viewed over 100 million times; supporters on Twitter coined the hashtag #MightyKacy. Kacy Catanzaro failed to complete the first round of the National Finals in Las Vegas. She made it past the first three obstacles, including the Giant Ring and the Silk Slider, before she fell attempting the Jumping Spider, where her full extension was simply too short to hold the position. = Subsequent seasons = In the 2015 Houston Qualifying round (season 7), Catanzaro failed to complete the course after falling on the cargo crossing. She was given a wild card spot in Vegas and she failed due to a mistimed trampoline jump at the Propeller Bar at Stage 1 of The Finals on September 7. By this time the pressure she felt to live up to her broadcast reputation as Ninja's greatest female competitor was reportedly showing and she was tearful in the post-run interview. In 2016, Catanzaro was invited to compete in the 32nd competition of the original Japanese version of ANW, Sasuke. Catanzaro performed well, completing 8 of the stage 1 obstacles before timing out on the final obstacle, the Lumberjack Climb. Since the course's renewal and increased difficulty, Catanzaro set the record for the furthest a female athlete has gone and the closest a female athlete has gotten to completing stage 1 since the 2nd competition (until 2017 when Jessie Graff completed stage 1 and became the first woman ever to complete stage 2.) In the 2016 Oklahoma City Qualifying round (season 8), Catanzaro failed to complete the course after falling on an early obstacle, the Log Runner, on June 20; however, she was again given a Wild Card spot in Las Vegas. In the Las Vegas National Finals, Stage 1, she fell on the second obstacle. In December 2016 Catanzaro co-hosted as a broadcaster the Team Ninja Warrior College Madness series of shows. In 2017, Catanzaro competed in American Ninja Warrior season 9 in the San Antonio city qualifier and finals. In the former she failed on the fourth obstacle, but did well enough to qualify for city finals under the show's new rules. In that latter run she had her best performance since 2014, making it past the Sky Hooks and the fifth obstacle to get the now-higher Warped Wall, which she failed to surmount. Nonetheless she qualified for the national finals. At the national finals, she failed on Stage 1 at the Double Dipper. In 2017, Catanzaro announced her retirement from American Ninja Warrior, with season 9 being her last.  Professional wrestling career  =WWE= NXT (2017‚Äìpresent) On January 4, 2017, Catanzaro received a tryout with WWE at their WWE Performance Center. It was announced on August 27 during the Mae Young Classic that Catanzaro had been signed to a contract with WWE. On January 18, 2018, WWE officially announced Catanzaro had reported to the WWE Performance Center. She made her in-ring debut at a NXT live event on April 19, in Sanford, Florida, in a losing effort to Reina Gonz√°lez.NXT Sanford, FL, live results: Kacy Catanzaro makes her debut Catanzaro continued to make appearances during 2018, both in house shows and on NXT television; she wrestles as a face and takes inspiration from WWE's Alexa Bliss's slogan \\"Five Feet of Fury\\", making reference to Catanzaro's own diminutive size. The 2nd episode of the Mae Young Classic aired on September 12, Catanzaro made her televised debut in a winning effort against Reina Gonzalez in the first round match. On Episode 5, she lost in the second round to Rhea Ripley. On January 27, 2019, Catanzaro made her main roster debut, entering the Royal Rumble at number 19 and lasting 10:45, before being eliminated by Ripley. She would make her NXT debut afterwards, on March 13. In September 2019, it was reported that Catanzaro had resigned from WWE and retired from professional wrestling due to an ongoing back injury she suffered. She returned on the January 15, 2020 episode of NXT as a surprise entrant in a women's battle royal. Catanzaro revealed in an interview that she took some time off because she had doubts about continuing in the Professional Wrestling business.https://solowrestling.mundodeportivo.com/new/86945-kacy-catanzaro- revela-el-motivo-de-ausencia-en-wwe-nxt On the September 16 episode of NXT, Catanzaro teamed with Kayden Carter in a winning effort against Jessi Kamea and Xia Li. The following week, she competed in a battle royal to determine the number one contender for the NXT Women's Championship, eliminating Indi Hartwell to become one of the final four before being eliminated by Dakota Kai, with help from eventual winner Candice LeRae.

Chicago Tribune. Retrieved 29 August 2014.  Life and career  Weinberg was born in Odessa, Ukraine, to Dora and Wolf (Zev) Weinberg, a middle-class family. His father was a merchant who died when Jacob was only 12. Jacob wrote a touching essay about how he had been sent to a synagogue to say the Kaddish prayer in mourning for his father. He wrote that he had not been raised in an Orthodox home and he was not familiar with the sounds of the Hebrew language in the prayer but he fell in love with the music of the language and the rhythm of the prayer. This sparked his interest in Jewish religion and Jewish music. His uncle was Peter Weinberg, a prominent translator of Shakespeare and Heine into Russian. Jacob completed law school at Moscow University, but he never practiced, preferring his piano studies. He studied at the Moscow Conservatory of Music from 1901-1906, under many prominent teachers including Taneyev and Ippolito-Ivanov. In addition, he studied composition for a year in Vienna, under Sergei Taneyev.Levin, Neil M. Biography: Jacob Weinberg 1879‚Äì1956. Milken Archive. Retrieved 29 August 2014. He taught piano as well; among his students were Josef Yasser, with whom he remained friends for many years to come. Weinberg toured Russia as a pianist and also toured with Emil Rosenoff in their two-piano concerts from 1912‚Äì1916. He adapted Rachmaninoff's works to create a two-piano piece he called Rachmaniana. It was published and performed by Weinberg and Rosenoff. He was also very interested in preserving the unique melodies and music scales of Jewish religious and secular folk tunes. When the St. Petersburg Society for Jewish Folk Music was formed in 1908 by Joel Engel, Lazare Saminsky, and others, Jacob Weinberg and his Moscow-based peers formed the Moscow branch of this society.* Then he returned to Odessa, where he taught at the Odessa Conservatory of Music. With the advent of the Bolshevik Revolution, Weinberg spent two months in prison and then fled with his wife Theresa (n√©e Bernstein) and his only child, a son, Walter, in 1922 to Palestine (now Israel). There he composed the first Hebrew opera, The Pioneers (Hechalutz). It won First Prize in an international composition contest, sponsored by the Philadelphia Sesquicentennial. There was a performance in Jerusalem in April, 1925. He taught piano; among his students was the pianist Mordecai Sandberg. With the competition prize money of $1500, Weinberg took his family to New York.Jewish Telegraphic Agency (5 November 1956). \\"Dr. Jacob Weinberg, Noted Jewish Composer, Dies in New York\\". Retrieved 29 August 2014. Weinberg produced concert versions of his opera The Pioneers at Carnegie Hall in 1941 and 1947, and at the Mecca Temple (now New York City Center) in the 1930s. In addition, there was a performance in Berlin, Germany in the 1930s, by the Kulturbund, the soprano Mascha Benya in one of the leading roles. It was performed in a synagogue since the Nazi party banned Jewish works, even masterpieces, from being performed in a proper concert hall. His many other works include religious Jewish works; he set the Sabbath service to music in several versions. These works are still performed at Temple Emanu-el, a prominent Reform synagogue in Manhattan.Congregation Emanu-El of New York. Composers. Retrieved 29 August 2014.

Weinberg died of lung disease in New York on November 2, 1956 at the age of 77. His remains are buried at the Stephen Wise Cemetery in Ardsley, New York. Jacob Weinberg's widow, Theresa Bernstein Weinberg, was a brilliant woman who spoke four languages and raised their only child, Walter, when Jacob was pursuing his work. After Jacob's death, Theresa donated his music papers to Jacob Michael, the collector and philanthropist, whose foundation, in turn, donated the collection to the National Library of Israel, which is located on the campus of Hebrew University at Givat Ram, in Israel. There are over 10,000 pages in this archive which has been carefully curated by its director, Dr. Gila Flam, a distinguished musicologist. Theresa Weinberg also donated a second large volume of Weinberg's musical scores, personal letters, academic papers, and photos to the archive at the Glinka Museum of Music in Moscow, at 4 Fedeeva St. These papers can be viewed by request. Among the Glinka collection are Jacob Weinberg's masterpiece \\"Sonata for Two Pianos\\", and \\"Encyclopedia of Piano Technique, Part I and Part II.\\" His papers from his student days at the Moscow Conservatory of Music (1901-1906)are also donated here. In addition to being Jacob's helpmate and supporter, Theresa Bernstein Weinberg was a gifted watercolor artist and avid maker of scrapbooks. In 1960 she formally signed a paper donating 67 scrapbooks of her clippings (of Jacob's work and also popular culture) to the NY Public Library system. These have yet to be found. Her grandchildren have been searching extensively for them. They are most likely in the basement storage areas of the NY Public Library at Bryant Park. Theresa passed away in 1962 and is interred at Ferncliff Cemetery, in Westchester County. Jacob Weinberg's works continue to be enjoyed and performed today. His Klezmer works for clarinet, in particular, are widely performed. These include \\"Canzonetta\\" and \\"The Maypole\\". Weinberg was one of the in-house composers at Temple Emanu- el in Manhattan.

As part of this work, he wrote the LUARM tool which is a live/volatile digital forensics engine that targets misuse detection. The LUARM research prototype has already been used with success on a number of notable cases detecting insiders and external computer intrusion attempts, however its main usefulness as a research prototype is to create data sets for researchers to further understand the nature of insider threats. A latter commercial version of the tool has been developed under his supervision by Steelcyber Scientific, an IT consulting firm that focuses on information security and scientific computing. This version contains performance, security and forensic data accuracy improvements over the originally developed LUARM prototype and is suitable for auditing various IT infrastructure components. Further details of the redeveloped LUARM engine are not publicly available. Magklaras also pioneered the use of Domain Specific Languages in the field of misuse detection and prediction, in order to strengthen the data mining capabilities of information security researchers. His work on the Insider Threat Prediction and Specification Language (ITPSL) forms the only known XML based DSL language that attempts to produce semantics capable of combining techniques that mine and interpret misuse data with tags that provide the likelihood of a misuse threat occurring.Towards an Insider Threat Prediction Specification Language, Magklaras G., Furnell S., Brooke P.

He was the author of several popular plays (some co-authored by Alexey Suvorin), novels and opera librettos (Tchaikovsky's Mazepa; Cui's Angelo). Biography Viktor Burenin was born in Moscow, the twelfth child in the family of architect Pyotr Petrovich Burenin. As a student of the Moscow College of Architecture (1852-1859), he became friends with some amnestied Decembrists (Ivan Pushchin, Ivan Yakushkin, Gavriil Batenkov among others) who introduced the young man to the Russian literary circles. A strong influence proved to be petrashevets Sergey Durov who advised him to translate Barbier's Iambes et poemes for the Geneva-based The Word of the Underground magazine. In 1861 Burenin spent several months in Germany, Switzerland and France; since then his visits to the Western Europe became yearly. In the early 1860s Burenin drifted towards the Russky Vestnik- centered literary society; attended Alexey Pleshcheev's \\"Meetings\\" (it was there that he met for the first time Suvorin, Lev Tolstoy, Mikhail Saltykov- Shchedrin) and also Ivan Aksakov's \\"Fridays\\", the meeting place for the Moscow slavophiles. Burenin assisted Nikolai Nekrasov in gathering the historical data on the Decembrist revolt for the latter's poem Russian Women. At 20 he debuted with an article in Alexander Hertzen's Kolokol,The Saving of the Censorship in Moscow / –°–ø–∞—Å–µ–Ω–∏–µ —Ü–µ–Ω–∑—É—Ä—ã –≤ –ú–æ—Å–∫–≤–µ. –ö–æ–ª–æ–∫–æ–ª. 1861. Nos. 112, 113. - Anonymous. in 1862 started contributing satirical poems to magazines Iskra and Zritel, writing under the pseudonym Vladimir Monumentov. In 1863 Nekrasov, Burenin moved to Saint Petersburg and a year later became a professional author. His 1864 poem \\"July 13, 1864\\" about Chernyshevsky's trial circulated in hand-written versions and could be published only in the Soviet Russia (Vestnik Literatury, 1920, No. 6). Three favorite targets for Burenin's wit in the 1860s were Prussian militarism, medical education for women and the corrupt Russian advocacy. Viktor Burenin, Alexey Suvorin and N.Gey, 1901 After Dmitry Karakozov's attempt on the life of Tsar Alexander II in 1866, Burenin's flat was searched by the police and the publication of his highly popular feuilletons in Saint Petersburg's Vedomosti was stopped. Nekrasov invited him to Otechestvennye Zapiski where he started publishing poems, several of which (including an epic \\"Thirteen Generals\\") were banned by censors. The drawn-out feud with Nikolai Mikhaylovsky led to his departure from Otechestvennye Zapiski in 1872. In 1876 Burenin joined Novoye Vremya, led by Alexey Suvorin (with it he stayed up until the newspaper's closure in 1918) and made a political U-turn. In the years to come Ivan Goncharov and Nikolai Leskov referred to him as an \\"unscrupulous cynic\\",I.A.Goncharov. Puskin House Yearly, 1976. Leningrad, 1978. P.212 several lawsuits have been filed against him and numerous literary luminaries (including Maxim Gorky, Anton Chekhov, Alexander Blok, Vladimir Korolenko, Leonid Andreev, Ivan Bunin) complained about the critic's unacceptably violent style of attacking opponents. Still, his satires were immensely popular: Blok admitted to having known by heart Burenin's parodies of his poems and was often entertaining his friends reciting them. Personal tragedy, the death in 1884 of 20-year-old son Konstantin (a gifted poet and translator, known as K.Renin), made Burenin totally alienated from the outside world. The office of Novoye Vremya (which he lived nearby) for years became his real home. Highly detrimental to his reputation was the quarrel with dying Semyon Nadson. Having construed the latter's criticism towards himself as an 'ingratitude' (Burenin assisted Nadson's debut publication; the latter felt uneasy with the fact) he published fragments from Nadson's personal correspondence, then accused the poet of simulating his illness in order to receive financial support from friends. According to popular myth the shock Nadson received was fatal and in several days' time he died. \\"Since then Burenin's been treated [by the literary elite] so much more cruelly than he'd treated Nadson and [the latter's] fan Eleonora Obmokni,\\" according to the theatre critic Alexander Kugel. So insistent was the liberal and left press in their obstruction that Burenin's name became a token one: Vladimir Lenin mentioned it regularly as a symbol of 'dirty' methods in leading the polemics. Burenin's \\"Critical Sketches\\" in Novoye Vremya were immensely successful: general readership loved his irreverent manner of ridiculing both authors and their works. Paradoxically, the Sketches did a lot to inform the readership about the new literary events. \\"Violating every norm of manner and behavior in his attacks on Merezhkovsky, Volynsky, Gippius... Burenin has done more than anybody else to popularize the new trends he slagged each Fridays in his brilliant buffoonery,\\" argued critic Pyotr Pertsov.Pertsov, P.P.

Pp.172, 241. \\"While in the liberal circles to read Novoye Vremya was considered mauves ton, Berenin's feullietons were read by everybody, clandestinely,\\" wrote author and publisher Boris Glinsky.Glinsky, P.P. Novoye Vremya: The History (1876-1916). Petrograd, 1916. P.61. Burenin's novels and novellas had considerable commercial success (mainly due to their sensationalist nature: the characters were easily recognizable real people) but, according to biographer Lepyokhin, hold little artistic merit. More substantial were Burenin's plays, based on antique and Middle Ages plots (Medea, with Suvorin as co-author, 1883; Messalina, 1885; The Death of Agrippina, 1887; The Comedy of Princess Zabava Putyatishna and Boyar-lady Vasilisa Mikulishna, 1889), all staged by Maly and Alexandrinsky theatres. Burenin translated several plays, by William Shakespeare, Niccolo Machiavelli, Alexander Dumas, Karl Gutzkow, Gerhart Hauptmann, among others. For many years Burenin was taking an active part in the life of Maly Theatre before founding (again with Suvorin) The Literary and Arts' Society Theatre. After the 1917 Revolution Burenin stayed in the Soviet Russia and fared relatively well despite the false obituary published in 1921 by Belgrade-based Novoye Vremya, re-newed by Suvorin's son. He was helped a lot by Maxim Gorky whom he mercifully lampooned in the 1900s. Legacy Viktor Burenin was one of the most controversial Russian authors of the early 20th century. The nature of his reputation was well described by Dmitry Minayev's epigram: \\"A dog runs down the street / Followed by Burenin, looking quite and nice / Watch out, the policemen, though / So as he won't bite the dog!\\"¬´–ü–æ —É–ª–∏—Ü–µ –∏–¥–µ—Ç —Å–æ–±–∞–∫–∞, / –ó–∞ –Ω–µ–π –ë—É—Ä–µ–Ω–∏–Ω —Ç–∏—Ö –∏ –º–∏–ª. / –ì–æ—Ä–æ–¥–æ–≤–æ–π! –°–º–æ—Ç—Ä–∏, –æ–¥–Ω–∞–∫–æ, / –ß—Ç–æ–± –æ–Ω –µ–µ –Ω–µ —É–∫—É—Å–∏–ª!¬ªLepekhin, M.P., Reitblath –ê. –ò. –ë—É—Ä–µ–Ω–∏–Ω –í–∏–∫—Ç–æ—Ä –ü–µ—Ç—Ä–æ–≤–∏—á // Russian Writers. –†—É—Å—Å–∫–∏–µ –ø–∏—Å–∞—Ç–µ–ª–∏. 1800‚Äî1917.

According to the 1911 edition of the Brockhaus and Efron Encyclopedic Dictionary, \\"Burenin‚Äôs literary character is defined... by the peculiar methods this critic used for his invectives, the methods that cannot be characterized in academic terms.\\" Many of Burenin's parodies found their way into Soviet satirical poetry anthologies.

P.337 \\"Objectively speaking, he was one of the most gifted authors of the literary right wing,\\" wrote Korney Chukovsky. According to biographer M.P.Lepyokhin, though, Burenin was not a right wing sympathizer, and his satires often clashed with Suvorin-dictated general line of the newspaper. Never motivated by corporative or ideological interests, he was relying totally on his own ideas and concepts, one of which was that all Russian writers (and the new generation of them, in particular) were charlatans tending to fool their readership with nonsense which had nothing to do with reality. Burenin \\"despised [Russian] literature and lampooned it,\\" Alexey Suvorin maintained.A.S.Suvorin's letters to V.V.Rozanov //–ü–∏—Å—å–º–∞ –ê.–°.–°—É–≤–æ—Ä–∏–Ω–∞ –∫ –í.–í.–†–æ–∑–∞–Ω–æ–≤—É. Saint Petersburg, 1913. P.136. Suvorin considered Burenin to be a victim of censorship which prevented him realizing his true potential. \\"Had we any freedom of the press, he'd have become the unique pamphleteer, using his wit to expose corrupt ministers, people like that. What he does now instead, is squander his gift on petty quarrels,\\" he wrote.The Diary of A.S.Suvorin. Moscow // –î–Ω–µ–≤–Ω–∏–∫ –ê.–°.–°—É–≤–æ—Ä–∏–Ω–∞. –ú., 1999.

His work focuses on storytelling and engaging audiences through emotion and technology. Early career In college, Jake Barton majored in performance studies (Bachelor in Science of Speech) at Northwestern University in Chicago. After graduating, he first worked doing set design work on Broadway productions. Eventually Barton started as an intern at the museum design firm, Ralph Appelbaum Associates. Working his way up, he eventually stayed at the company for seven years, and then in 2001 he left his job at Appelbaum and started graduate school at New York University, for a M.P.S. Interactive Telecommunications. He simultaneously launched Local Projects as a design firm for museums and public spaces. Local projects Barton was named by Crain‚Äôs as one of the Top Entrepreneurs of 2013, and his company, Local Projects, which he founded in 2002, has won awards such as the National Design Awards for Interaction Design in 2013, the AIGA Design Competition for Effective Design in 2013 and multiple MUSE Awards in 2013. Barton‚Äôs work touches on the overlap of physical and digital, creating a range of applications for museums, education, architecture, and memorials. For the Bill and Melinda Gates Foundation, Local Projects created a next-generation application around experiencing physics on the playground, and has worked with Frank Gehry on the Eisenhower Memorial in Washington D.C. As the head of Media Design for the National September 11 Memorial & Museum, Local Projects led a team of designers to create multi- media experiences that focus on using visitor‚Äôs own stories as well as the use of algorithms to curate up-to-the moment journalism around the post 9/11 world. During his time working with the 9/11 Memorial, he also led a team, in partnership with Jer Thorp, to create an algorithm that solved the names arrangement on the panels. The names are not listed alphabetically or chronologically, but through personal relationships between the victims themselves. Jake has spoken about visitor participation in museums and \\"The Museum of You\\", and Local Projects credited with bringing emotional storytelling and innovation to architecture. Local Projects has partnered with architects such as Frank Gehry, Diller Scofidio + Renfro and Bjarke Ingels to create new approaches in media and physical spaces. In March 2019, Local Projects was sold to MTM, an independent network dedicated to creating value between people and brands.

The division into four quadrants allows the localisation of pain and tenderness, scars, lumps, and other items of interest, narrowing in on which organs and tissues may be involved. The quadrants are referred to as the left lower quadrant, left upper quadrant, right upper quadrant and right lower quadrant. These terms are not used in comparative anatomy, since most other animals do not stand erect. The left lower quadrant includes the left iliac fossa and half of the flank. The equivalent in other animals is left posterior quadrant. The left upper quadrant extends from the umbilical plane to the left ribcage. This is the left anterior quadrant in other animals. The right upper quadrant extends from umbilical plane to the right ribcage. The equivalent in other animals is right anterior quadrant. The right lower quadrant extends from the umbilical plane to the right inguinal ligament. This in other animals is the right posterior quadrant. The nine regions offer more detailed anatomy and are delineated by two vertical and two horizontal lines.  Quadrants  Quadrants of the abdomen Diagram showing which organs (or parts of organs) are in each quadrant of the abdomen The left lower quadrant (LLQ) of the human abdomen is the area left of the midline and below the umbilicus. The LLQ includes the left iliac fossa and half of the left flank region. The equivalent term for animals is left posterior quadrant. Important organs here are: *the descending colon and sigmoid colon *the left ovary and fallopian tube *the left ureter The left upper quadrant (LUQ) extends from the median plane to the left of the patient, and from the umbilical plane to the left ribcage. The equivalent term for animals is left anterior quadrant. Important organs here are: *Stomach *Spleen *Left lobe of liver *Body of pancreas *Left kidney and adrenal gland *Splenic flexure of colon *Parts of transverse and descending colon The right upper quadrant (RUQ) extends from the median plane to the right of the patient, and from the umbilical plane to the right ribcage. The equivalent term for animals is right anterior quadrant. Important organs here are: *Liver *Gall bladder with biliary tree *Duodenum *Head of pancreas *Right kidney and adrenal gland *Hepatic flexure of colon The right lower quadrant (RLQ) extends from the median plane to the right of the patient, and from the umbilical plane to the right inguinal ligament. The equivalent term for animals is right posterior quadrant. Important organs here are: *Cecum *Appendix *Ascending colon *Right ovary and Fallopian tube *Right ureter Regions Regions of abdomen Regions shown on left in side-by-side comparison with quadrants. Nine regions of the abdomen can be marked using two horizontal and two vertical dividing lines. The vertical lines are the mid-clavicular lines taken from the mid-point of each clavicle. The upper horizontal line is the subcostal line taken from the inferior parts of the lowest costal cartilages. The lower horizontal line is the intertubercular line connecting the tubercles of the pelvis. The three main centrally positioned regions are the epigastric region, the umbilical region, and the hypogastric region also known as the pubic region. On the sides of the abdomen the other six regions are the left and right hypochondriac regions, on either side of the epigastrium; the left and right lumbar flank regions, on either side of the umbilical region, and the left and right iliac or inguinal regions on either side of the hypogastrium. (\\"Hypo-\\" means below; \\"epi-\\" means above; \\"chondron\\" means cartilage (in this case, the cartilage of the rib) and \\"gaster\\" means stomach. The reversal of \\"left\\" and \\"right\\" is intentional, because the anatomical designations reflect the patient's own right and left.) Clinical significance If abdominal pain or signs of peritonitis are localised in the LLQ, colitis, diverticulitis, ureteral colic or pain due to ovarian cysts or pelvic inflammatory disease may be suspected. Examples of tumors in the left lower quadrant include colon cancer and ovarian tumor. The LUQ may be painful or tender in the case of intestinal malrotation. The RUQ may be painful or tender in hepatitis, cholecystitis, and peptic ulcer. The RLQ, in particular the right inguinal region or right iliac fossa may be painful and tender in conditions such as appendicitis. =Differential diagnosis= Children *gastroenteritis, mesenteric adenitis, Meckel's diverticulitis, intussusception, Henoch‚ÄìSch√∂nlein purpura, lobar pneumonia Adults *regional enteritis, renal colic, perforated peptic ulcer, testicular torsion, rectus sheath hematoma, pelvic inflammatory disease, ectopic pregnancy, endometriosis, torsion/rupture of ovarian cyst, appendicitis T3s4s Elderly *diverticulitis, intestinal obstruction, colonic carcinoma, mesenteric ischemia, leaking aortic aneurysm See also *Murphy's sign *McBurney's point *Superficial anatomy References Category:Abdomen ","title":"Quadrants and regions of abdomen"},{"id":"43335528","text":"Andrea Giordana (born 27 March 1946) is an Italian actor.

He was probably a member of the family Mule from Denmark. Mule's parents have not been identified, but claims that he was the illegitimate son of the unpopular Hans Kristensson Mule were disputed by Edvard Bull the elder. Christian was the father of Thomas, Severin (Soren), Kristen, Bertel, and possibly Niels Mule. Mayor The first mention of Mule is in 1555, when he is already a central figure in Oslo. He was an advocate for Oslo to the King in connection with the equipment of a Bosun. He appeared to have close ties to centurion in Oslo, and was appointed mayor by him in 1567. In 1579 he donated the site of the ruins of the old Bishop's residence and erected a new building there. Accommodation of prominent guests was a key aspect of belonging to the city's elite. The highlight in this respect was undoubtedly when the retired mayor hosted the autumn 1589 house wedding of Christian IV's sister Anne of Denmark and James of Scotland. Mule shared the mayoral office first with Niels Stub and later with Oluf Eriksson Glad, and is noted as mayor for the last time in 1585. One of Mule's sons Niels Kristensson Mule was Bailiff from 1572 to 78. Son Bertel Mule was mayor of Oslo from 1605 to 1610, when he was appointed to the Court in the Uplands. He is the only example known of a father and son in the mayoral chair in Oslo before the fire in 1624. Seven Years' War The favors that Mule received were largely motivated by his work during the siege of Akershus in 1567 during the Nordic Seven Years' War. Mule probably played a key role in the city's citizen militias and the funding of the defense of Akershus. Among other things, Mule's debt of 1000 krone to a Swede transferred to the Crown and after the war a loan to the lord of 250 krone. He took large losses when the city was burnt during the siege, and estimated the damage to house and property alone at 7000 krone. Trading Details of Mule's trading activities are limited but it is known that he bought salt for 30 krone in 1557 and, in partnership with several others, bought hides and skin for 436 valleys and 20 shillings. During and after the war he claimed to have lost three large ships, respectively 100, 200 and 300 lasts. Mule was involved in the import of German beer. During the war he got a tariff exemption on imports of up to 2 lasts (24 barrels) tyst√∏l. A few years later he asked the King for favor for his four sons, in theform of duty-free import of 6.4 lester Rostocker√∏l for each man.

Though he was not the distiller of the whiskey, which was originally sold under the brand name \\"Cascade\\", his wholesaling firm played an important role in its distribution and marketing, and his name appeared on its labels throughout the late 19th and early 20th centuries. When Cascade's new owners reopened the original Cascade Hollow distillery in the 1950s, they renamed the whiskey for Dickel. Though he valued anonymity and preferred to work in the background in business dealings, Dickel was a prominent resident of his adopted hometown of Nashville, Tennessee. He owned a number of smaller business enterprises, at various times, in addition to his liquor wholesaling business. Early life Dickel was born out of wedlock to Elisabeth Dickel in Gr√ºnberg, Germany. He is believed to have been the illegitimate son of Anton Fischer, who lived in Marktheidenfeld. He was named after his godfather (and probable uncle) Georg Adam Fischer. Anton Fischer's father, Adam Fischer, was a W√ºrzburg-area master cooper who specialized in wine casks. Dickel migrated to the United States in 1844, and relocated to Nashville in 1847. By the mid-1850s, Dickel was operating a boot and shoe manufacturing business on Union Street in Nashville. He continued in this line of work until about 1860. During this period, he married Augusta Banzer, who was twenty years his junior. Dickel first began selling liquor in 1861. During the Civil War, rampant smuggling took place in Nashville after Union soldiers occupied the city in 1862 and banned the sale of liquor. While there is no direct evidence linking Dickel to wartime smuggling, the Schwabs, a family of Alsatian immigrants with whom Dickel would long be associated, were heavily involved in Nashville's illicit whiskey trade. A son-in-law of Abram Schwab, Meier Salzkotter (1822-1891), who had been a business associate of Dickel since 1859, was caught by Union authorities in possession of a large quantity of contraband liquor. Salzkotter argued that his in-laws had saddled him with the whiskey, but was nevertheless arrested and jailed. Upon his release, he divorced his wife, Cecilia Schwab. Liquor wholesaling and other endeavors At the end of the war in 1865, Dickel opened a liquor store on South College Street in Nashville. He had relocated to South Market Street (modern Second Avenue) by the following year. He hired Salzkotter as a superintendent, and Salzkotter's former brother-in- law, Victor Emmanuel Shwab (1847-1924), as a bookkeeper. Shwab, who had dropped the \\"c\\" from his surname in an attempt to Americanize it, would eventually marry Emma Banzer, a sister of Dickel's wife, Augusta. In 1867, Dickel began blending whiskey, and was arrested and charged in federal court for rectifying liquor without a license.\\"Circuit Court of the United States\\", Nashville Union and Dispatch, 15 May 1867, p. 3. In spite of these charges, Dickel's liquor retail continued to thrive. By 1870, Dickel had established a liquor wholesaling firm, George A. Dickel and Company, which was headquartered at 2 North Market Street. Typical of liquor wholesalers of the day, Dickel and Company purchased whiskey directly from distillers from around the region, and sold it in barrels, jugs and bottles.Kevin Cason, \\"George Dickel Distillery\\", Tennessee Encyclopedia of History and Culture. Retrieved: 18 July 2014. The company also sold beer from Nashville-area brewers, including ales and lagers produced by South Nashville brewer Stifel and Pfeiffer,\\"South Nashville Brewery\\", Nashville Union and American, 6 April 1869, p. 3. as well as wines and brandies.\\"New Advertisements\\", Nashville Union and American, 8 July 1873, p. 4.\\"River News\\", Nashville Union and American, 16 December 1873, p. 4. The company was one of the first in Nashville to directly import liquor, including Scottish and Irish whiskeys, Dutch gin, and champagnes.\\"Imported in Bond\\", Nashville Union and American, 8 November 1872, p. 4. An 1875 advertisement described the company's specialties as \\"copper distilled sour mash whiskies\\" and imported champagnes, and noted the company shipped nationwide.\\"Wholesale Liquor Trade\\", Nashville Union and American, 14 March 1875, p. 5. On March 17, 1874, a fire swept through Market Street, destroying the Dickel and Company headquarters, and just missing its large warehouse, which was filled with $60,000 worth of whiskey.\\"Fire!\\" Nashville Union and American, 18 March 1874, p. 1. Another fire in May 1881 destroyed the warehouse, however, which represented for the company a $75,000 loss (though partially insured).\\"Nashville Ablaze\\", Public Ledger, 18 May 1881, p. 2. In reporting on this second fire, one newspaper described Dickel as \\"the great whiskey dealer\\".\\"Nashville's Great Fire\\", The Pulaski (TN) Citizen, 19 May 1881, p. 2. In 1882, Dickel and Company built a new five-story headquarters on Market Street.James A. Hoobler, A Guide to Historic Nashville, Tennessee (The History Press, 2008), p. 39. While it's unknown when exactly Dickel and Company began distributing whiskey produced at the Cascade Hollow distillery near Tullahoma, there is no evidence to support the oft-told story that Dickel established the distillery while on a trip to the area in 1870. John F. Brown and F.E. Cunningham were operating a distillery in the valley by 1879, when Brown sold his shares to Matthew Sims. In 1883, McLin Davis became the Cascade operation's distiller, and instituted a number of innovations that greatly increased the whiskey's quality. Shwab, who had become a full partner in Dickel and Company in 1881, purchased Sims's share of the distillery in 1888. With this purchase, Dickel and Company became Cascade's sole distributor. Along with his successful liquor enterprise, Dickel was engaged in a number of endeavors in Nashville. He lived just outside the city in a home on Dickerson Pike,Nashville Directory, Vol. 16 (Marshall and Bruce, 1880), p. xciv. where he operated a sizable pear orchard.\\"Mammoth Pears\\", Nashville Union and American, 25 August 1871, p. 4. He was also a volunteer fireman with Nashville's Deluge Company No. 3. Dickel became a Master Mason in 1852, and was a member of the Knights Templar.\\"The Tennessee Knights Templar in Baltimore\\", Memphis Daily Appeal, 25 September 1871, p. 4. He endorsed photographer and fellow German-American Carl Giers for the state legislature in 1874.\\"The Legislature\\", Nashville Union and American, 3 September 1874, p. 4. In 1886, Dickel was badly injured in a horse-riding accident, and never fully recovered. His health declined rapidly during the last two years of his life, and he died on June 11, 1894. He is interred in Nashville's Mount Olivet Cemetery. Legacy As Dickel's health declined, Shwab gradually took over Dickel and Company's daily operations. Dickel's will left his share of the company to his wife, Augusta, with instructions to sell it at the first opportunity. While she declined to sell, she took no active part in the company's operations, and spent her later years dividing her time between Nashville, her summer home in Charlevoix, Michigan, and annual trips to Europe. Upon her death in 1916, she left her share of the company to Shwab. As the distributor of the increasingly popular Cascade brand, Dickel and Company's name appeared on the Cascade label into the 20th century, when the operation was forced to close with the onset of prohibition. In the late 1950s, Schenley Industries, which had bought the Cascade brand from Shwab's descendants, rebuilt the Cascade Hollow distillery, and renamed the brand \\"George Dickel\\". A bust and monument to Dickel now stands outside the general store and visitors' center at the new distillery. Dickel and Company's headquarters, built in 1882, still stands at 201‚Äì203 Second Avenue in Nashville.

He designed many churches in Glasgow and Edinburgh, especially those for the Free Church of Scotland. He was three times President of the Glasgow Architectural Association and Vice President of the Royal Institute of British Architects in 1891. He was also active in politics, being a member of the Scottish Liberal Club, Glasgow Liberal Club and National Liberal Club (in London). He was also a Justice of the Peace in Argyllshire.Dictionary of Scottish Architects: Campbell Douglas Early Life He was born in 1828 the son of the Rev.

In 1842 he was articled to John Thomas Rochead, architect, who was based in Glasgow. In 1843, together with his father, they left the established Church of Scotland and joined the Free Church, following the Disruption of that year. This led to many later commissions.

It combines a romantic drama with a military adventure story, set against the contemporary background of British operations against a rebellion in the kingdom of Iraq. Plot In the Kingdom of Iraq in 1935, British troops are stationed to protect the convoy route to India from rebel incursions. After spending three years in under-cover activities in the region, Lieutenant Brent, a British officer, has fallen under suspicion of treacherous dealings with the enemy but has been cleared by a military tribunal. He joins the garrison in Iraq commanded by Colonel Stark, but is embarrassed to meet there his former lover, Joyce, who is now the colonel's wife. During an operation to recapture the rebel stronghold of Ksour, Brent is inadvertently compromised with Joyce, and when he and her brother Dan attempt to protect her reputation, Brent becomes suspected of treason by the cynical Major Hudson. Brent escapes during a rebel attack, and using his experience to infiltrate the enemy fortress he disables its armaments and facilitates its capture. Cast * Kate de Nagy, as Joyce Stark * Pierre Richard-Willm, as James Brent * Jaque Catelain as Dan Grant * Aim√© Clariond, as Colonel Stark * Pierre Renoir, as Major Hudson * Kissa Kouprine, as Alia * Jean Forest, as Lieutenant Drake Production The subject of the film was proposed to Marcel L'Herbier by the producer Pierre O'Connell, of Film Union. It came as part of a wave of enthusiasm for colonial adventures on film, such as The Lives of a Bengal Lancer and La Bandera. The play from which the film was adapted was La Maison cern√©e by Pierre Frondaie, written in 1919 and staged in Paris soon afterwards; it was a romantic melodrama set in Palestine during World War I. L'Herbier revised the plot, renamed the characters, and relocated the story to Iraq in 1935, where the recently independent kingdom was still under British influence, with British troops stationed in the country.Mireille Beaulieu. Interview included on the DVD of La Route imp√©riale produced by Les Documents cin√©matographiques in 2014. Filming took place in May and June 1935, at the Billancourt studios in France and in Algeria at Bou Sa√¢da and Boghari for exterior scenes. At Bordj El Kiffan, on the outskirts of Algiers, they used the remains of a film set built for Julien Duvivier's biblical film Golgotha; it now served to represent the rebel fortress of Ksour and was blown up in the final scenes of the film. L'Herbier's assistant director was √àve Francis who had previously worked on many films with him both as actress and assistant. The music for the film was composed by Marius-Fran√ßois Gaillard who had written the orchestral score for L'Herbier's silent film El Dorado. Another regular collaborator with the director was the costume designer Jacques Manuel, who created several elegant gowns to be worn by the leading actress Kate de Nagy (introducing an element of luxury and glamour in the stark setting of an army garrison in the desert). Reception The film was released in September 1935 and had some commercial success. It was shown in various countries across Europe and in Quebec. Critical responses were generally favourable, but there was some adverse comment among French reviewers that it should not be the business of the French to make films which glorified the British Empire. It was also noted that the film held echoes of another contemporary conflict in the developing Abyssinia crisis and its implications for British control of the Suez Canal zone. The film's later survival was threatened when the original negative was burned by the German occupying forces in 1940. After the war, a surviving interpositive copy was discovered, from which further prints could be made.Jaque Catelain. Jaque Catelain pr√©sente Marcel L'Herbier. Paris: Vautrin, 1950. p. 118.

It consisted of six 43 minute episodes, grouped into three chapters of two episodes each. The show was created by Philip Levens and Adrian A. Cruz. The pilot was written and executive produced by Philip Levens, who served as the showrunner. On July 9, 2014, CBC added Ascension to its fall programming roster. It had originally been scheduled to premiere in November 2014. In October 2014, CBC announced that the premiere date had been moved to January 2015. The show started airing on CBC on Monday nights starting February 9, 2015. Syfy had originally announced plans to debut the show on November 24, 2014, airing one episode per week for six weeks. Instead, the series premiered on December 15, 2014, airing one chapter consisting of two episodes each night for three consecutive nights. The story takes place aboard a generation ship launched in the 1960s and now half-way into its 100-year journey to Proxima Centauri. A murder on board sparks off a series of events that leads some of the crew to begin second-guessing their real mission. Plot The premise of the show is that in 1963 President John F. Kennedy and the U.S. government, fearing the Cold War will escalate and lead to the destruction of Earth, launched the Ascension, an Orion-class spaceship, to colonize a planet orbiting Proxima Centauri, assuring the survival of the human race. The USS Ascension is a massive, self-sustaining generation ship. The journey will take 100 years, so only the children and grandchildren of the original crew of 600 volunteers will be alive when they arrive. The story begins 51 years into their journey (i.e., in the present), as they approach the point of no return (when the ship would flip and begin the deceleration to their final destination, after which time they would have insufficient fuel to initiate a return trip). The action begins with the mysterious murder of a young woman ‚Äì the first homicide since the Ascension was launched.

(see below: Comments by the cast and crew) On October 13, 2014, the network announced that instead of airing as a weekly series for six weeks, Ascension would air as a three-night \\"event\\" starting on December 15, 2014, with two of the six episodes airing each of three consecutive nights. =Potential future seasons= Although the show was ordered as a miniseries, it could have continued, similar to the network's popular series Battlestar Galactica. On March 10, 2015, Syfy announced that they would not be producing more episodes, \\"We were very happy with Ascension as an event series, but with so much high profile development in the works, we have decided not to pursue a full series\\". Comments by the cast and crew Upon the official announcement, on March 13, 2014, that Syfy had picked up the miniseries, Bill McGoldrick, Executive Vice President of Original Content for Syfy stated: \\"Phil Levens has crafted a bold and surprising spin on the space opera. We are equally excited to embark on this journey with our partners at UCP, Sea to Sky, Lionsgate, Jason Blum and his Blumhouse Productions and also with Mark Stern who shepherded this project while at Syfy\\". On July 14, 2014, at the Television Critics Association summer press tour, Jason Blum, Tricia Helfer, Philip Levens, and Brian Van Holt commented on the upcoming show. Executive producer Jason Blum said that: > What piqued [his] interest was the originality of EP Philip Levens' story > idea, which was inspired by Freeman Dyson's Project Orion to design a > nuclear-propelled spacecraft. Levens pointed out that President Kennedy > squashed the development of Orion soon after the Bay of Pigs as the military > began equipping the spaceship with weapons. He was terrified that they were > turning it into a Death Star. About the starship he said that \\"it feels like a cruise ship. Essentially the ship is like a time capsule, another civilization that continued for 50 years parallel to our civilization.\\" Blum added that: > The people on the ship, only some of their children, but most of their > grandchildren, are the only people who are going to arrive at this new > world. A lot of the people who started on this ship have died. It's their > children, their children's children, who are going to get to where they're > going. And there are a lot of conflicts going on. Should they turn around > and go back to Earth, which they've lost touch with? So they have no idea of > what Earth even looks like now. Should they continue? Also there's been a > murder on the ship, which never happened before. So that's kind of what > starts it. Tricia Helfer said about Viondra that her \\"manipulative\\" character considers herself the \\"mother of the people on the ship, the mother of humanity in one way if Earth did blow itself up\\". \\"Brian [Van Holt] and I play a married couple and as the wife, I'm definitely the woman behind the man more than we would see in our society here on Earth today\\", Helfer added. She explained about the ship's crew that: > Their morals and the values that they're dealing with are still from the > '60s. The society on the ship is very hierarchical and uses genetic linking- > arranged marriages, basically to sustain human life (three generations will > be born during the trip to Proxima). [My] character Viondra started out on > the lower decks but rose through the ranks, as did her husband. They're a > power couple. Viondra will do anything to stay in power. Creator Philip Levens said that: > Ascension will explore how technology has evolved on the ship and the way > morality is still rooted in an early '60s, pre-Civil Rights Act view [of] > humanity. Issues of class ‚Äì the ship is divided into decks, with people in > positions of power living on the upper ones ‚Äì will also come into play. > There's much more of a sense of obeying your parents because, you know, for > the ship to really work, everybody has to cooperate. The murder is kind of > the starting of the unravelling, so to speak. And kids start to question > choices made by their grandparents. There's a thing on board the ship called > \\"the crisis\\". It's this existential dilemma that everyone has to go through > when they realize that, you know, their life has been circumscribed for > them. You know, everybody they ever know or ever will know is already around > them. So there's lots of issues like that kind of play [as] a coming of age > thing with the kids and their parents. \\"Because the series is set on a ship that is self-contained and self- sustained, the people have evolved and developed differently than they would have if they'd remained on Earth. Not only is the technology different, but they think differently, too\\". Brian Van Holt described his character as \\"a man caught in the middle, aware that his legacy as the ship's 'middle route' captain won't probably go down in the record books. The one who launches the ship and the one who lands it will be remembered. No one in the now will be remembered. So he struggles with that\\". He concluded by saying that \\"he's a very ambitious character who sought out a leadership role, which was presented to him after an act of heroism on the ship\\". Reception Ascension has been met with mixed reviews from critics. Rotten Tomatoes gives the show a rating of 65%, based on 20 reviews, with an average rating of 5.8/10. The site's critical consensus states, \\"The characters in Ascension lack the depth necessary for its dramatic elements, but its premise may be smart enough to hold the interest of sci-fi fans.\\" On Metacritic, the show has a score of 56 out of 100, based on reviews from 14 critics, indicating \\"mixed or average reviews\\".

Gene drives can arise through a variety of mechanisms. They have been proposed to provide an effective means of genetically modifying specific populations and entire species. The technique can employ adding, deleting, disrupting, or modifying genes. Proposed applications include exterminating insects that carry pathogens (notably mosquitoes that transmit malaria, dengue, and zika pathogens), controlling invasive species or eliminating herbicide or pesticide resistance. As with any potentially powerful technique, gene drives can be misused in a variety of ways or induce unintended consequences. For example, a gene drive intended to affect only a local population might spread across an entire species. Gene drives used to eradicate populations of invasive species in their non-native habitats may have consequences for the population of the species as a whole, even in its native habitat. Any accidental return of individuals of the species to its original habitats, through natural migration, environmental disruption (storms, floods, etc.), accidental human transportation, or purposeful relocation, could unintentionally drive the species to extinction if the relocated individuals carried harmful gene drives. Gene drives can be built from many naturally occurring selfish genetic elements that use a variety of molecular mechanisms. These naturally occurring mechanisms induce similar segregation distortion in the wild, arising when alleles evolve molecular mechanisms that give them a transmission chance greater than the normal 50%. Most gene drives have been developed in insects, and notably mosquitoes, as a way to control insects-borne pathogens. Recent developments however designed gene drives directly in viruses, and notably herpesviruses. These viral gene drives can propagate a modification into the population of viruses, and aim to reduce the infectivity of the virus.  Mechanism  In sexually-reproducing species, most genes are present in two copies (which can be the same or different alleles), either one of which has a 50% chance of passing to a descendant. By biasing the inheritance of particular altered genes, synthetic gene drives could spread alterations through a population. = Molecular mechanisms = Molecular mechanism of gene drive. At the molecular level, an endonuclease gene drive works by cutting a chromosome at a specific site that does not encode the drive, inducing the cell to repair the damage by copying the drive sequence onto the damaged chromosome. The cell then has two copies of the drive sequence. The method derives from genome editing techniques and relies on the fact that double strand breaks are most frequently repaired by homologous recombination, (in the presence of a template), rather than non- homologous end joining. To achieve this behavior, endonuclease gene drives consist of two nested elements: * either a homing endonuclease or a RNA-guided endonuclease (e.g., Cas9 or Cpf1) and its guide RNA, that cuts the target sequence in recipient cells * a template sequence used by the DNA repair machinery after the target sequence is cut. To achieve the self-propagating nature of gene drives, this repair template contains at least the endonuclease sequence. Because the template must be used to repair a double-strand break at the cutting site, its sides are homologous to the sequences that are adjacent to the cutting site in the host genome. By targeting the gene drive to a gene coding sequence, this gene will be inactivated; additional sequences can be introduced in the gene drive to encode new functions. As a result, the gene drive insertion in the genome will re-occur in each organism that inherits one copy of the modification and one copy of the wild-type gene. If the gene drive is already present in the egg cell (e.g. when received from one parent), all the gametes of the individual will carry the gene drive (instead of 50% in the case of a normal gene). = Spreading in the population = Since it can never more than double in frequency with each generation, a gene drive introduced in a single individual typically requires dozens of generations to affect a substantial fraction of a population. Alternatively, releasing drive- containing organisms in sufficient numbers can affect the rest within a few generations; for instance, by introducing it in every thousandth individual, it takes only 12‚Äì15 generations to be present in all individuals. Whether a gene drive will ultimately become fixed in a population and at which speed depends on its effect on individuals fitness, on the rate of allele conversion, and on the population structure. In a well mixed population and with realistic allele conversion frequencies (‚âà90%), population genetics predicts that gene drives get fixed for selection coefficient smaller than 0.3; in other words, gene drives can be used to spread modifications as long as reproductive success is not reduced by more than 30%. This is in contrast with normal genes, which can only spread across large populations if they increase fitness. = Gene drive in viruses = Because the strategy usually relies on the simultaneous presence of an unmodified and a gene drive allele in the same cell nucleus, it had generally been assumed that a gene drive could only be engineered in sexually reproducing organisms, excluding bacteria and viruses. However, during a viral infection, viruses can accumulate hundreds or thousand genome copies in infected cells. Beside, cells are frequently co-infected by multiple virions and recombination between viral genomes is a well-known and widespread source of diversity for many viruses. In particular, herpesviruses are nuclear-replicating DNA viruses with large double-stranded DNA genomes and frequently undergo homologous recombination during their replication cycle. These properties have enabled the design of a gene drive strategy that doesn‚Äôt involve sexual reproduction, but relies on co-infection of a given cell by a naturally occurring and an engineered virus. Upon co-infection, the unmodified genome is cut and repaired by homologous recombination, producing new gene drive viruses that can progressively replace the naturally occurring population. In cell culture experiments, it was shown that a viral gene drive can spread into the viral population and strongly reduce the infectivity of the virus, which opens novel therapeutic strategies against herpesviruses.  Technical limitations  Because gene drives propagate by replacing other alleles that contain a cutting site and the corresponding homologies, their application has been mostly limited to sexually reproducing species (because they are diploid or polyploid and alleles are mixed at each generation). As a side effect, inbreeding could in principle be an escape mechanism, but the extent to which this can happen in practice is difficult to evaluate. Due to the number of generations required for a gene drive to affect an entire population, the time to universality varies according to the reproductive cycle of each species: it may require under a year for some invertebrates, but centuries for organisms with years- long intervals between birth and sexual maturity, such as humans. Hence this technology is of most use in fast-reproducing species.  Issues  Issues highlighted by researchers include: * Mutations: A mutation could happen mid- drive, which has the potential to allow unwanted traits to \\"ride along\\". * Escape: Cross-breeding or gene flow potentially allow a drive to move beyond its target population. * Ecological impacts: Even when new traits' direct impact on a target is understood, the drive may have side effects on the surroundings. The Broad Institute of MIT and Harvard added gene drives to a list of uses of gene-editing technology it doesn't think companies should pursue. = Bioethics concerns = Gene drives affect all future generations and represent the possibility of a larger change in a living species than has been possible before. \\"I don't care if it's a weed or a blight, people still are going to say this is way too massive a genetic engineering project,\\" [bioethicist] Caplan says. \\"Secondly, it's altering things that are inherited, and that's always been a bright line for genetic engineering.\\" In December 2015, scientists of major world academies called for a moratorium on inheritable human genome edits that would affect the germline, including those related to CRISPR-Cas9 technologies, but supported continued basic research and gene editing that would not affect future generations. In February 2016, British scientists were given permission by regulators to genetically modify human embryos by using CRISPR-Cas9 and related techniques on condition that the embryos were destroyed in seven days. In June 2016, the US National Academies of Sciences, Engineering, and Medicine released a report on their \\"Recommendations for Responsible Conduct\\" of gene drives. Models suggest that extinction-oriented gene drives will wipe out target species and that drives could reach populations beyond the target given minimal connectivity between them. Kevin M. Esvelt stated that an open conversation was needed around the safety of gene drives: \\"In our view, it is wise to assume that invasive and self-propagating gene drive systems are likely to spread to every population of the target species throughout the world. Accordingly, they should only be built to combat true plagues such as malaria, for which we have few adequate countermeasures and that offer a realistic path towards an international agreement to deploy among all affected nations.\\". He moved to an open model for his own research on using gene drive to eradicate Lyme disease in Nantucket and Martha's Vineyard. Esvelt and colleagues suggested that CRISPR could be used to save endangered wildlife from extinction. Esvelt later retracted his support for the idea, except for extremely hazardous populations such as malaria-carrying mosquitoes and isolated islands that would prevent the drive from spreading beyond the target area.  History  Austin Burt, an evolutionary geneticist at Imperial College London, introduced the possibility of conducting gene drives based on natural homing endonuclease selfish genetic elements in 2003. Researchers had already shown that such genes could act selfishly to spread rapidly over successive generations. Burt suggested that gene drives might be used to prevent a mosquito population from transmitting the malaria parasite or to crash a mosquito population. Gene drives based on homing endonucleases have been demonstrated in the laboratory in transgenic populations of mosquitoes and fruit flies. However, homing endonucleases are sequence-specific. Altering their specificity to target other sequences of interest remains a major challenge. The possible applications of gene drive remained limited until the discovery of CRISPR and associated RNA-guided endonucleases such as Cas9 and Cpf1. In June 2014, the World Health Organization (WHO) Special Programme for Research and Training in Tropical Diseases issued guidelines for evaluating genetically modified mosquitoes. In 2013 the European Food Safety Authority issued a protocol for environmental assessments of all genetically modified organisms. = Funding = Target Malaria, a project funded by the Bill and Melinda Gates Foundation, invested $75 million in gene drive technology. The foundation originally estimated the technology to be ready for field use by 2029 somewhere in Africa. However, in 2016 Gates changed this estimate to some time within the following two years. In December 2017, documents released under the Freedom of Information Act showed that DARPA had invested $100 million in gene drive research.  Control strategies  Scientists have designed multiple strategies to maintain control over gene drives. The drosophila drive requires at least thousands of insects for the drive to begin. A few individuals escaping the target region would be unlikely to spread the drive. In 2020 researchers reported the development of two active guide RNA-only elements that, according to their study, may enable halting or deleting gene drives introduced into populations in the wild with CRISPR-Cas9 gene editing. The paper's senior author cautions that the two neutralizing systems they demonstrated in cage trials \\"should not be used with a false sense of security for field-implemented gene drives\\".  CRISPR  CRISPR is a DNA editing method that makes genetic engineering faster, easier, and more efficient. The approach involves expressing an RNA-guided endonuclease such as Cas9 along with guide RNAs directing it to a particular sequence to be edited. When the endonuclease cuts the target sequence, the cell repairs the damage by replacing the original sequence with homologous DNA. By introducing an additional template with appropriate homologues, an endonuclease can be used to delete, add or modify genes in an unprecedentedly simple manner. , it had been tested in cells of 20 species, including humans. In many of these species, the edits modified the organism's germline, allowing them to be inherited. In 2014 Esvelt and coworkers first suggested that CRISPR/Cas9 might be used to build endonuclease gene drives. In 2015 researchers published successful engineering of CRISPR-based gene drives in Saccharomyces, Drosophila, and mosquitoes. All four studies demonstrated efficient inheritance distortion over successive generations, with one study demonstrating the spread of a gene drive into laboratory populations. Drive- resistant alleles were expected to arise for each of the described gene drives, however this could be delayed or prevented by targeting highly conserved sites at which resistance is expected to have a severe fitness cost. Because of CRISPR's targeting flexibility, gene drives could theoretically be used to engineer almost any trait. Unlike previous designs, they could be tailored to block the evolution of drive resistance in the target population by targeting multiple sequences within appropriate genes. CRISPR could permit a variety of gene drive architectures intended to control rather than crash populations.  Applications  Gene drives have two main classes of application, which have implications of different significance: * introduce a genetic modification in laboratory populations; once a strain or a line carrying the gene drive has been produced, the drive can be passed to any other line by mating. Here the gene drive is used to achieve much more easily a task that could be accomplished with other techniques. * introduce a genetic modification in wild populations. Gene drives constitute a major development that makes possible previously unattainable changes. Because of their unprecedented potential risk, safeguard mechanisms have been proposed and tested. = Disease vector species = One possible application is to genetically modify mosquitoes and other disease vectors so that they cannot transmit diseases such as malaria and dengue fever. Researchers have claimed that by applying the technique to 1% of the wild population of mosquitoes, that they could eradicate malaria within a year. = Invasive species control = A gene drive could be used to eliminate invasive species and has, for example, been proposed as a way to eliminate invasive species in New Zealand. Gene drives for biodiversity conservation purposes are being explored as part of The Genetic Biocontrol of Invasive Rodents (GBIRd) program because they offer the potential for reduced risk to non-target species and reduced costs when compared to traditional invasive species removal techniques. Given the risks of such an approach described below, the GBIRd partnership is committed to a deliberate, step-wise process that will only proceed with public alignment, as recommended by the world's leading gene drive researchers from the Australian and US National Academy of Sciences and many others. A wider Outreach Network for Gene Drive Research exists to raise awareness of the value of gene drive research for the public good. Some scientists are concerned about the technique, fearing it could spread and wipe out species in native habitats. The gene could mutate, potentially causing unforeseen problems (as could any gene). Many non-native species can hybridize with native species, such that a gene drive afflicting a non-native plant or animal that hybridizes with a native species could doom the native species. Many non- native species have naturalized into their new environment so well that crops and/or native species have adapted to depend on them.  Predator Free 2050  The Predator Free 2050 project is a New Zealand government program to completely eliminate eight invasive mammalian predator species (including rats, short-tailed weasels, and possums) from the country by 2050. The projects was first announced in 2016 by New Zealand's prime minister John Key and in January 2017 it was announced that gene drives would be used in the effort. In 2017 one group in Australia and another in Texas released preliminary research into creating 'daughterless mice', using gene drives in mammals.  California  In 2017 scientists at the University of California, Riverside developed a gene drive to attack the invasive spotted- wing drosophila, a type of fruit fly native to Asia that is costing California's cherry farms $700 million per year because of its tail's razor- edged ‚Äúovipositor‚Äù that destroys unblemished fruit. The primary alternative control strategy involves the use of insecticides called pyrethroids that kills almost all insects that it contacts. = Wild animal welfare = The transhumanist philosopher David Pearce has advocated for using CRISPR-based gene drives to reduce the suffering of wild animals. Kevin M. Esvelt, an American biologist who has helped develop gene drive technology, has argued that there is a moral case for the elimination of the New World screwworm through such technologies because of the immense suffering that infested wild animals experience when they are eaten alive.

Currently PharmAccess employs a multidisciplinary team of professionals in Tanzania, Kenya, Nigeria, Ghana and the Netherlands. The PharmAccess Group PharmAccess was founded in 2001 by HIV/AIDS researcher Prof. Joep Lange. He took an important first step for the organization by distributing life-saving medicines against HIV/AIDS in Africa in cooperation with multinationals. In 2007, PharmAccess was one of two organizations that won a competition for a World Bank funding partnership. Other leading individuals in the organization are Onno Schellekens, MsC, the managing director of the Investment Fund for Health in Africa, and Professor Tobias Rinke de Wit of the Amsterdam Institute for Global Health and Development. All of the activities are co-funded by the Health Insurance Fund (HIF). In October 2006, the Health Insurance Fund signed a contract with the Dutch Ministry of Foreign Affairs to finance programs that provide access to affordable and quality healthcare among low income populations in sub-Saharan Africa through the introduction of financing mechanisms (including health insurance) and the improvement of healthcare quality.  History  Prof. Joep Lange of the Academic Medical Center (AMC) initiated PharmAccess in 2001, with support from the Dutch Aids Fonds, to bring life-saving antiretroviral therapy for HIV/AIDS treatment to Africa. Highly active antiretroviral therapy (HAART) was introduced in the developed world in the mid-nineties and immediately led to dramatic reductions in AIDS- related morbidity and mortality. In Africa, for the great majority of the population, adults and children, treatment was not available and many of the HIV/AIDS patients died of the disease. Map of activities in Africa Initially, PharmAccess focused on the introduction of HIV/AIDS treatment programs for employees and dependents of Heineken in sub-Saharan Africa, which was revolutionary at the time. Soon they realized that these programs could be broadened to lay a foundation for the development of functional general health systems. The Dutch government, Dutch multinationals and PharmAccess joined forces to launch an alternative mechanism to the traditional development approach: a donor fund established to pilot health insurance for the currently uninsured in sub-Saharan Africa through the local private sector. In order to enable the private companies in sub-Saharan Africa to grow and deliver the necessary services, a private investment fund (Investment Fund for Health in Africa, IFHA) was endorsed in 2007. In the years after this led to additional offshoots which all contribute to general health system strengthening and support to the health insurance schemes.  Approach  The PharmAccess Group employs an integrated approach in order to improve access to quality health care. The group mobilizes public and private resources for the benefit of doctors and patients through insurance, loans to doctors, clinical standards and impact research. The PharmAccess Group state they have a different approach to development cooperation, by making use of public-private partnerships. PharmAccess works with various different African and international partners, donors and investors from both the private and the public sector. The PharmAccess Group headquarters is located in the Netherlands. The group currently works from five country offices located in Tanzania, Kenya, Namibia, Nigeria and Ghana.  Business lines  Members of the group that each play a crucial role in the funding and implementation of this approach are Health Insurance Fund, Medical Credit Fund, SafeCare and our independent research partner the Amsterdam Institute for Global Health and Development. The PharmAccess Group works with different business lines: = Supporting health plans = They work with local partners to make health insurance available for low income groups (such as cooperatives of farmers, organizations of market women or company employees). Members pay an insurance premium according to their means. The health plans and related initiatives are financed with public grants from the Dutch Government and World Bank, with increasing local government involvement. = Enabling investments = Medical Credit Fund provides loans to doctors and clinics in the private sector, enabling them to improve the quality of their services, develop their business potential and service more low-income patients. Medical Credit Fund aims to contribute to a healthier investment climate and increase the bankability and thus scalability of the private healthcare sector. = Improving quality = Sub-Saharan Africa has a shortage of institutions and standards that can ensure objective measurement of quality. SafeCare is a quality improvement program designed for resource-restricted healthcare facilities. SafeCare‚Äôs internationally recognized set of standards aims to create a transparent improvement path that offers clinics positive incentives to move steadily upwards in quality. The mHealth Program's 'mobile health wallet' allows people to pay for healthcare services by using their mobile phone. = mHealth innovations = The PharmAccess mHealth Program manages healthcare payments from both public and private donors to healthcare providers for providing quality healthcare services to patients. = Implementing and initiating = PharmAccess Foundation acts as a coordinating, implementing and advising (consultancy) partner for each of its organizations. In addition, PharmAccess aims to regularly develop new initiatives to strengthen the integrated approach. = Funding = All of these activities are co-funded by the Health Insurance Fund. In October 2006, the Health Insurance Fund signed a contract with the Dutch Ministry of Foreign Affairs to finance programs that provide access to affordable and quality healthcare among low income populations in sub-Saharan Africa through the introduction of innovative financing mechanisms (including health insurance) and the improvement of healthcare quality.  Impact  The Kwara State Health Insurance Program has been recognized as a best practice model for taking innovation to scale by the Development Assistance Committee (DAC) of the OECD. Charlotte Petri-Gornitzka, Director General of the Swedish International Development Cooperation Agency (SIDA), presents the award to His Excellency Abdulfatah Ahmed, Governor of Kwara State The programs of the PharmAccess Group and its partners have had impact on different communities, for example in the Kwara State in Nigeria, where the Kwara State Community Health Program was launched in 2009. The Kwara State Government subsidizes 60% of the premiums and has committed to extend the program to 600,000 people over the next five years. The program is also funded by the Dutch Health Insurance Fund with support from the Dutch Ministry of Foreign Affairs, and implemented by PharmAccess and the Nigerian health maintenance organization Hygeia. During a visit to Nigeria, UN Secretary General Ban Ki-moon spoke about the program‚Äôs unique character: ‚ÄòThe groundbreaking Community Health Insurance of the Kwara State Government is exactly the kind of innovative partnership that we should replicate ‚Äì here in Nigeria and beyond.‚Äô This program represents the first time that a state government in Nigeria has partnered with the private sector and an NGO to provide statewide health insurance for its citizens. The organization‚Äôs work has attracted considerable international attention including a G20 prize (G20 Small Medium Enterprise Finance Challenge 2010) that President Obama presented for their healthcare financing model.

He was born in Liverpool, England in 1946 and was educated at University of Wales Swansea. After receiving the BSc (1967), MSc (1968) and PhD (1971) at Swansea he joined the faculty of the Department of Civil Engineering where served until his death in 1999.  Career  Ernest Hinton received the BSc Honours in Civil Engineering at Swansea in 1967. His studies at Wales continued with the award of the MSc in 1968 (Least squares analysis using finite elements.) , and the PhD in 1971 (Design of reinforced concrete slabs.). In recognition of his many contributions to his field of research he was awarded the D.Sc. in 1988. . In 1989 he was also awarded a personal chair in recognition of his world class research. Dr. Hinton was a Charted Civil Engineer (C.Eng.), Member of the British Computer Society (M.B.C.S.) and Member of the Institution of Structural Engineers (M.I.Struct.E.).  Contributions  One of the early pioneers of the finite element method and computational mechanics, Prof. Hinton had an extremely prolific career. His early paper with Professor Bruce Irons (1968) was titled \\"Least squares smoothing of experimental data using finite elements\\" and proved to be the beginning of a career in computational mechanics at Swansea. He went on to supervise the doctoral research of over 40 students many of whom choose to join diverse universities and continue the work begun with Prof Hinton. In addition he published around 250 journal and conference papers and was author, coauthor or editor of more than ten books. In recounting the significance of Hinton's work on structural topology optimisation, Akin and Arjona-Baez wrote \\"Like several of his colleagues at the University of Wales, Swansea Prof. Hinton made significant contributions to the field of engineering computations. He was among the first to be concerned with reducing the error in a FEA (Finite Element Analysis) and with quantifying overall and local errors.\\" He and colleagues continued to make notable contributions to the emerging computational mechanics field led at Swansea by O. C. Zienkiewicz. Especially significant are the series of books he coauthored with D. R. J. Owen, one of the most widely respected and referenced of these is the 1980 book \\"Finite Elements in Plasticity\\". Professors Hinton and Owen also collaborated to edit 17 international conference proceedings and together with Prof. K. J. Bathe were chief editors of the journal \\"Engineering Computations\\". Of his many journal papers a series of three on the subject of homogenisation and topology optimisation published together with B. Hassani in 1998 in \\"Computers and Structures\\" have been extremely influential and widely cited. \\"His legacy will always be remembered by future generations of researchers, and by the many present students who have benefited from his research work. The MSc and PhD students who were supervised by Ernie benefited from his seemingly infinite motivation and inspiration. He also spent a tremendous amount of energy on lecturing students on both the undergraduate and the postgraduate level and students appreciated his efforts to explain difficult subjects in understandable form. His door was always open, and anybody who wanted help with a difficult subject, or with other problems was always welcome. Despite his personal fight with illness he had lots of time and encouragement for the people around him.\\" Ernest Hinton died in Swansea in 1999 at the age of 53 after a protracted illness.

She was one of the founders of the Handweavers Guild of America. Early years Berta Frey was born on 8 November 1893 in Texas. During World War I (1914‚Äì18) she was an occupational therapist specializing in woodworking in the army's Walter Reed Hospital in Washington, D.C.. She learned handweaving at this time. When she found that no handlooms were being made in the USA she used her woodworking skills to make looms for her patients and then for herself. Frey began by following Colonial weaving designs, but soon started to experiment with other patterns. Inter-war period After the war Frey moved to New York City with her parents, and worked in the textile industry. She eventually opened a design studio in the city and began to teach weaving there. In 1934, Frey, already known as an author of technical works on handweaving, attended a summer session of the Penland Weaving Institute in the Blue Ridge Mountains of North Carolina. She was one of the initiators of construction of a new building for the school, which was outgrowing its facilities. Subscriptions were raised to build the Edward F. Worst Craft House, which had both classrooms and sleeping facilities. Many of the students at the Institute came from the local community. An informal study group began to meet monthly at Frey's New York studio. On 11 November 1940 the New York Guild of Handweavers was established there at an organizational tea, and was headed by Frey. Most of the initial members worked in areas related to textiles as teachers, designers or occupational therapists. In 1941 Frey resigned from her position with the guild and returned to providing occupational therapy for the army. Post war After World War II (1939‚Äì45) Frey became Chair of the New York Guild's Program Committee. She often gave talks on different subjects, and frequently contributed to Handweaver and Craftsman, a national magazine launched in 1940. In May 1946 Frey conducted a conference on weaving at the YMCA in Milwaukee sponsored by the Milwaukee Weaver's Guild. She gave demonstrations of how to prepare the warp for the loom. In the years just after the war, Frey taught weaving at the Arrowmount school in Gatlinburg, Tennessee, in summer workshops organized by Pi Beta Phi and the University of Tennessee. Frey was an instructor at the Fletcher Farm School in Vermont. In 1948 she published a second edition of her small book, Seven Projects in Rosepath. This was one of the first American guides for beginner handweavers. On 8‚Äì9 April 1955 a meeting of 135 members of Ontario weaving guilds was held at the Heliconian Club in Toronto. Frey gave a talk and demonstrated putting on a multicolored warp. The group formed an advisory committee to look into setting up a provincial organization, leading to the foundation of the Ontario Handweavers & Spinners (OHS) the next year. She returned to Ontario in 1960, when she was the principal speaker at the OHS conference organized by the Ottawa Valley Weavers Guild. She talked about handweaving from ancient times until the present, and later showed how ancient designs could be used in modern settings. In 1967 she was again in Ontario as one of the judges of the OHS exhibition Fashion Fabrics, which opened in Kingston, Ontario in October 1967 and circulated for the next two years. In 1969 Frey was one of the founders of the Handweavers Guild of America (HGA), and served on its first board of directors. At this time she was teaching weaving at Woodstock, New York. She died on 1 February 1972 at the age of 78 in Bearsville, New York, just to the west of Woodstock. The HGA held its first convention, in Detroit, Michigan, on 8‚Äì11 June 1972. Garnette Johnson announced the HGA Scholarship fund, established in memory of Frey.

The deficit, or underproduction crisis, is a theoretical problem, arising from comparing observations of ultraviolet light emitted from known populations of galaxies and quasars to theoretical predictions of the amount of ultraviolet light require to simulate the observed distribution of the hydrogen gas in the local universe in a cosmological simulation. The distribution of hydrogen gas was inferred using Lyman-alpha forest observations from Hubble Space Telescope‚Äôs Cosmic Origins Spectrograph.Danforth et. al, \\"on arXiv\\", Submitted to ApJ, The amount of light from galaxies and quasars can be estimated from its effect on the distribution of hydrogen and helium in the regions between galaxies. Highly energetic ultraviolet photons can convert electrically neutral hydrogen gas into ionized gas. A team led by Juna Kollmeier reported an unexpected deficit of roughly 400% between ionizing light from known sources and the actual observations of intergalactic hydrogen. Kollmeier and her team wrote in their scientific report, ‚ÄúWe examine the statistics of the low-redshift Lyman- alpha forest from smoothed particle hydrodynamic simulations in light of recent improvements in the estimated evolution of the cosmic ultraviolet background (UVB) and recent observations from the Cosmic Origins Spectrograph (COS). We find that the value of the metagalactic photoionization rate required by our simulations to match the observed properties of the low- redshift Lyman-alpha forest is a factor of 5 larger than the value predicted by state-of-the art models for the evolution of this quantity.‚Äù Cosmological simulations start at very high cosmological redshift z (such as z=100 or larger) and are evolved to z=0. According to Benjamin D. Oppenheimer, who is one of the report's coauthors, ‚ÄúThe simulations fit the data beautifully in the early universe, and they fit the local data beautifully if we‚Äôre allowed to assume that this extra light is really there. It's possible the simulations do not reflect reality, which by itself would be a surprise, because intergalactic hydrogen is the component of the Universe that we think we understand the best.‚Äù Kollmeier and her team state that \\"... either conventional sources of ionizing photons (galaxies and quasars) must contribute considerably more than current observational estimates or our theoretical understanding of the low-redshift universe is in need of substantial revision.‚Äù Similar study, led by Michael Shull, found that the deficit is only factor 2 large and not a factor 5 as previously claimed.Shull, Moloney, Danforth, Tilton 2015 , Astrophysical Journal, A potential resolution to the photon underproduction crisis is presented by a series of recent papers. Khaire & Srianand Khaire & Srianand 2015, , MNRAS Letters, showed that a factor 2 to 5 times large metagalactic photoionization rate can be easily obtained using updated quasar and galaxy observations. Recent observations of quasars indicate that the quasar contribution to ultraviolet photons is factor 2 large as compared to previous estimates. The revised galaxy contribution is also factor 3 higher. Furthermore, the Kollmeier GADGET-2 simulations did not include heating from active galactic nuclei (AGN) feedback. Including AGN feedback was shown to be an important element for heating in the low redshift intergalactic medium (IGM) (Gurvich, Burkhart, & Bird 2016.). This implies that the low redshift COS data can be used to calibrate AGN feedback models in cosmological simulations.

The film features Karthik and Radha in lead roles. The film, had musical score by Sankar Ganesh.  Plot Major Kuppusamy, is a wealthy millionaire, but a widower. He is very strict with his daughter Radha(Radha) and makes her live a military- like lifestyle (getting up very early in the morning, being punctual in every small thing etc.) She isn't allowed even to venture out of their bungalow. However, one day Kuppusamy announces Radha's wedding with Ravi(Thiagarajan), who is, unbeknownst to him, a criminal. Disheartened, Radha runs away from home. She hides in a small house to escape from those pursuing her. The house happens to be that of a quirky, hapless journalist, Raja(Karthik). Radha, in the pretense if being an orphan, requests him to give her shelter. A reluctant Raja is initially hesitant, but eventually falls in love with her. He goes to Veeraiah(Karate R. V. T. Mani), a Karate master, for advice on how to win her heart. On the other hand, his press manager asks him to find a missing girl, promising him a huge reward, and gives him Radha's photo. Raja, however, doesn't want to send her back to her strict father and wicked fianc√©e though it involves forgoing the prospective reward.

Headquartered in New York City, the company is mainly known for Enigma Public, a now defunct library of public data. Using machine learning and artificial intelligence, the company organizes and connects internal and external data for customers in a variety of use cases, from financial services compliance to pharmaceutical safety monitoring and healthcare to insurance underwriting and lending. Enigma works with a number of Fortune 500 companies, including American Express, ADP, BB&T;, Celgene, Merck, and PayPal.  History  Enigma Technologies, Inc. was founded by Marc DaCosta (Chairman, co-founder) and Hicham Oudghiri (CEO, co- founder). The founders' curiosity was drawn into focus by the 2008 financial crisis and the effects of climate change. They were frustrated that relevant public data was available, and should have shed light on these two occurrences, but the world still struggled to connect the dots to understand how and why these crises happened or to stop both altogether. They sought to make data connected, open, and actionable ‚Äì and Enigma was born. The company currently has more than 100 employees and is headquartered in NYC's Silicon Alley. Enigma was launched at the three-day 2013 TechCrunch Disrupt Conference, and was the winner of the event's Startup Battlefield.Velazco, Chris. \\"And The Winner Of TechCrunch Disrupt NY 2013 Is‚Ä¶ Enigma!\\", TechCrunch, Wednesday May 1, 2013Dickey, Megan Rose. \\"This TechCrunch Disrupt Winner Could Be The Future Of Search\\", Business Insider, May 2, 2013 In February 2013 they announced a $1.1 million seed funding round backed by TriplePoint Capital and Crosslink Capital, among others.Lawler, Ryan. \\"Enigma.io Raises $1.1 Million To Structure The World Of Big Data\\", TechCrunch, February 27, 2013 This was augmented in early 2014 by a $4.5 million funding round which included additional investors The New York Times Company, Comcast Ventures, and American Express Ventures.Novet, Jordan. \\"Enigma reels in $4.5M to collect and organize loads of the world‚Äôs public data\\", VentureBeat, January 30, 2014\\"Early Stage Investments - New York Times Company\\" In June 2013, the company announced a long-term beta testing partnership with Stanford University and Harvard University, granting full access to their students and academic communities.Marostica, Matt. \\"Enigma statistical data mining tool now available to Stanford community\\", Stanford University Libraries Blog, June 25, 2013 In October 2013, the company was a finalist in the NYCEDC-sponsored \\"Take the HELM: Hire + Expand in Lower Manhattan\\" contest,Weiss, Lois. \\"Helming Downtown\\", New York Post, October 22, 2013 and in June 2014 they were selected as participants in the FinTech Innovation Lab program.\\"Six Entrepreneurs Showcase Cutting-Edge Financial Services Solutions at 2014 FinTech Innovation Lab Demo Day in New York\\", Partnership for New York City, June 26, 2014Crosman, Penny. \\"Six Fintech Startups That Wowed Bankers\\", American Banker, July 1, 2014 In August 2014, Enigma announced that Jeremy Bronfman would step down as CEO and be replaced by Hicham Oudghiri.\\"Hicham Oudghiri named Enigma CEO\\", Enigma Blog, August 26, 2014 In June 2015, Enigma secured a $28.2 million Series B funding roundSeries B Funding led by New Enterprise Associates (NEA) with participation from Two Sigma Ventures and New York City Investment Fund, as well as existing investors including American Express Ventures, Comcast Ventures and The New York Times Company. In April 2017, Enigma moved its website to Enigma.comEnigma \\"Say hello to the new Enigma.com\\", Enigma (Company), April 5, 2017 from its previous site, Enigma.io, and ceased referring to itself with the \\".io\\" qualifier. Enigma was named to Forbes FinTech 50 List in February 2018. In September 2018, Enigma announced $95 million in new funds to expand its network and platform that connects real-world and enterprise data to power key workflows. Existing investor NEA led this funding, which included new investments from strategic FinTech investors BB&T;, Capital One Growth Ventures, MetLife and Third Point along with venture firm Glynn Capital. Early investors Comcast Ventures, Crosslink Capital, Two Sigma Ventures, and the Partnership Fund for NYC also participated. This was the inaugural investment for both BB&T; and MetLife.  Enigma Public  Enigma Public was a data warehouse website which provided an aggregated collection of public data from international government agencies, organizations, and businesses. It was at one point the broadest collection of public data that is open and searchable by everyone, and could be accessed through Enigma's web-based user interface, which also provided a collection of data analytics tools. Users could register for a free rate-limited account to receive programmatic access via their web API, while unfettered or commercial access was available for a fee.Singer, Natasha. \\"A Harvest of Company Details, All in One Basket\\", New York Times, March 15, 2014 Data republished by Enigma was reusable (with attribution) for free by journalists, so it was occasionally used as a primary or corroborating source for analyses on everything from FBI aerial surveillanceAldhous, Peter. \\"Spies in the Skies\\", \\"Buzzfeed\\", April 6, 2016 to house fire incidentsSwanstrom, Ryan. \\"Collaboration and Open Data Helping to Prevent House Fires\\", \\"Datakind\\", October 2, 2015 to U.S. government shipping records. The company redesigned and updated Enigma Public in June 2017 in an effort to make public data more accessible and easy to use. This redesign included features that enabled users to identity connections and interpretations within the data quickly and easily by focusing metadata and linked datasets. The updated platform also curated featured datasets and collections, including those obtained by Freedom of Information Act requests. In August 2018, Enigma released a Python SDK for Enigma Public, designed to make it easier to locate and import public data into a Jupyter notebook or any other Python project using the Enigma Public API. Enigma Public was deactivated on March 24th, 2020.  Enigma Labs  Enigma has built a number of open data tools that serve a public good, called Enigma Labs. Each project sheds light on critical topics of the day and enables and informs civic action. The company's first Lab was launched in October 2013, as a real-time visualization tracking how the United States federal government shutdown of 2013 impacted employees of every government agency. In 2014, Enigma partnered with the City of New Orleans to better identify which neighborhoods were least likely to have smoke alarms. This project, called Smoke Signals, was soon scaled to cities across the United States in partnership with DataKind and the American Red Cross. The tool uses data from the American Housing Survey and American Community Survey to create a block-level assessment of whether residents are likely to have a working smoke alarm in more than 175 cities in the United States and is available as an interactive map and downloadable CSV files. Cities can also upload their own historical fire incident data to improve the model for their area.  Datasets  Enigma's now defunct data warehouse contained over 100,000 datasets from over 1,000 sources, including government agencies, organizations, and businesses. Notable examples include bills of lading for all United-States-based shipments from the US Customs Service, the log of visitors to the White House, and campaign finance records. Enigma has obtained a vast amount of data via Freedom of Information Act (FOIA) requests, including New York Metropolitan Transit Authority accident reports and a log of all FOIA requests made to the Securities and Exchange Commission  Features  Enigma provides access to its datasets through a web-based graphical user interface and an API. Tools are provided in the interface for performing basic statistical analysis, such as finding the minimum, maximum or mean value of any numerical data column. For further analysis, users may either use the interface to export data to a CSV file or make HTTP requests to the provided API. The company also produces interactive data visualizations which provide visual interfaces for particular individual datasets.Hickey, Walter. \\"The Whole Government Shutdown In One Simple, Beautiful Chart\\", Business Insider, October 8, 2013\\"U.S. Daily Temperature Anomalies 1964-2013\\", Accessed July 21, 2014 On May 11, 2016, Enigma announced the launch of ParseKit, now called \\"Concourse\\", their proprietary software for ETL and data integration, which had been developed internally via dogfooding to acquire their public datasets. In September 2018, Enigma announced its use of knowledge graphs as the vehicle for ingesting, standardizing, and adapting data from tables into representations of relationships delivered to users. Enigma uses linking, ontology mapping, and entity resolution capabilities to uncover new information about people, places, and companies and deliver linked information through an API. Enigma‚Äôs knowledge graphs integrate machine learning of Elasticsearch results, to improve entity resolution. References Further reading * \\"C-SUITE: Enigma CEO Jeremy Bronfman\\".

He said, Basic quotes *\\"The social well-being of our country requires our constant effort for the amelioration of race prejudice and the extension to all elements of equal opportunity and equal protection under the laws which are guaranteed by the Constitution. The Federal Government especially is charged with this obligation in behalf of the colored people of the Nation. Not only their remarkable progress, their devotion and their loyalty, but, our duty to ourselves under our claim that we are an enlightened people requires us to use all our power to protect them from the crime of lynching.\\" *We need ideals that can be followed in daily life, that can be translated into terms of the home. We can not expect to be relieved from toil, but we do expect to divest it of degrading conditions. Work is honorable; it is entitled to an honorable recompense. We must strive mightily, but having striven there is a defect in our political and social system if we are not in general rewarded with success. *To relieve the land of the burdens that came from the war, to release to the individual more of the fruits of his own industry, to increase his earning capacity and decrease his hours of labor, to enlarge the circle of his vision through good roads and better transportation, to lace before him the opportunity for education both in science and in art, to leave him free to receive the inspiration of religion, all these are ideals which deliver him from the servitude of the body and exalt him to the service of the soul.

Krause‚Äôs Food and the Nutrition Care Process. 13th ed. St. Louis, MO; Saunders: 2012.The Kidneys and How They Work. National Kidney and Urologic Diseases Information Clearinghouse. Accessed 26 july 2014. However, when the kidneys are damaged, they are no longer able to do this. Dialysis, used in end stage kidney disease (also referred to as kidney failure, chronic kidney disease, and renal failure), it is a process where a machine filters the blood since the kidneys are no longer able to.Escott-Stump, Sylvia. Nutrition and Diagnosis-Related Care. 7th ed. Baltimore, MD; Lippincott Williams & Wilkins: 2012. In addition to the inability to filter blood, kidney failure results in the body‚Äôs inability to make some vitamins and minerals (example: vitamin D), as well as difficulty excreting excessive amounts of certain vitamins and minerals (example: phosphorus). The kidney‚Äôs role in vitamin and mineral metabolism Normally, we are able to get adequate amounts of vitamins and minerals by eating a wide variety of foods. However, many patients on dialysis must follow dietary restrictions, making it difficult for them to get the necessary amounts of certain vitamins and minerals to stay healthy.Nutrition. Dialysis Clinic, Inc. 2010. Accessed 17 July 2014. < http://www.dciinc.org/nutrition.php> In addition to this, many vitamins and minerals are lost during the process of dialysis. Therefore, many dialysis patients are at risk for vitamin and mineral deficiencies. Since vitamins are necessary for proper metabolism, protein building, and growth it is important for the health of dialysis patients that they are supplemented with any vitamins or minerals that they may be deficient in.Vitamins. The Nephron Information Center. 2013. Accessed 17 July 2014. < http://nephron.org/nephsites/adp/vits.htm> General overview of vitamins and minerals Vitamins can be divided into two groups: water-soluble vitamins and fat-soluble vitamins.

However, vitamin D is sometimes an exception to this generalization. A doctor will prescribe vitamin D if it is necessary.Vitamin Supplement for Kidney Disease. Accessed 26 July 2014. < http://depts.washington.edu/nutr/student_projects/dietetic/Supplements/2011/Renal%20Supplements_2011.PDF> Nutrients to avoid in dialysis There are some nutrients that are restricted in kidney failure patients because of the body‚Äôs inability to excrete excessive amounts of them due to the kidneys not functioning properly. In general, these nutrients include: *Potassium: The kidneys help to regulate potassium levels. When the kidneys are damaged, potassium levels can become elevated. Elevated potassium levels can cause the heart to beat irregularly or even stop. *Phosphorus: The kidneys also help to regulate phosphorus levels in the body. When the kidneys are damaged, they aren‚Äôt able to remove excessive phosphorus, causing it to build up in blood. Your doctor may prescribe a phosphate binder that is taken with meals to help remove excess phosphorusVitamins and Minerals in Kidney Disease. The National Kidney Foundation. 2014. Accessed 17 July 2014. < http://www.kidney.org/atoz/content/vitamineral.cfm> *Sodium: In patients with kidney failure, sodium can cause excessive fluid retention, which can lead to elevated blood pressure, edema, heart failure, and shortness of breath. *Fluid: As kidney damage worsens so does the ability to excrete fluid. In kidney failure patients, excessive fluid intake can result in the same conditions that excessive sodium intake does. Vitamins and minerals to supplement in dialysis Many foods that contain phosphorus and potassium (restricted in dialysis patients) also contain folate, niacin, riboflavin, and vitamin B6 (water-soluble vitamins).. Mahan, K., Escott-Stump, S., and Raymond, J. Krause‚Äôs Food and the Nutrition Care Process. 13th ed. St. Louis, MO; Saunders: 2012. Therefore, restricting foods that contain phosphorus and potassium can lead to deficiencies in other important vitamins. In general, the following vitamins and minerals are supplemented in dialysis patients: *B vitamins- Water-soluble vitamins that play a role in red blood cell development to prevent anemia and contribute to metabolism to help change the foods you eat into energy.Vitamins and Minerals in Kidney Disease. The National Kidney Foundation. 2014.

Accessed 17 July 2014. < http://www.kidney.org/atoz/content/vitamineral.cfm> *Vitamin D- Normally, the kidney changes vitamin D into its active form, vitamin D3, which helps you absorb calcium. Many dialysis patients have low intakes of calcium due to avoidance of foods containing phosphorus and potassium. Lack of calcium can lead to renal osteodystrophy (bone weakening). On the other hand, too much calcium can cause calcification or calciphylaxis (calcium deposits in places such as the heart.. Mahan, K., Escott-Stump, S., and Raymond, J. Krause‚Äôs Food and the Nutrition Care Process. 13th ed. St. Louis, MO; Saunders: 2012. Vitamin D is a fat-soluble vitamin, meaning that excessive amounts can be damaging so it should be prescribed and monitored by a doctor. *Iron- Kidney damage results in inability of the kidney to produce erythropoietin, which stimulates red blood cell production.. Mahan, K., Escott-Stump, S., and Raymond, J. Krause‚Äôs Food and the Nutrition Care Process. 13th ed. St. Louis, MO; Saunders: 2012. Thursday, 5 January 2017 Nutrition for patients on dialysis varies on an individual basis. It can be very confusing trying to determine which vitamins and minerals need to be supplemented and which do not so it is important for dialysis patients to speak with a doctor before making any changes to their nutritional plan.

An unusually strong late-season storm, Gilda developed on December 13 from a disturbance first identified southeast of Chuuk State three days prior. Steadily intensifying, Gilda reached typhoon strength the next day and proceeded in a general westward track towards the Philippines. On December 18, the typhoon peaked with maximum sustained winds of 280 km/h (175 mph) shortly before the storm made landfall on Samar with a slightly weakened intensity. After passing into the South China Sea, Gilda steadily weakened and made a final landfall in southern Vietnam before dissipating on December 22 over Cambodia. Damage in the Philippines was extensive, and in some locations telecommunications were cut. Impacts in Samar were particularly severe, and in some areas the damage was the worst in 30 years. Homes and crops sustained significant losses. Overall, Gilda caused the deaths of 23 in the Philippines and US$1.5 million in damage. Meteorological history On December 10, surface observations from Chuuk State suggested that a tropical cyclone was potentially developing to the island's southeast. As a result, the Joint Typhoon Warning Center (JTWC) requested aircraft reconnaissance on the system, which located a defined but weak circulation center 640 km (400 mi) southeast of Guam associated with the disturbance. Over the next few days, the system slowly intensified, with the Japan Meteorological Agency (JMA) determining the storm to have reached tropical depression strength at 1800 UTC on December 11 and the JTWC indicating tropical storm intensity by December 13. That day, reconnaissance indicated that the storm had two distinct circulation centers, both weak in intensity. However, these vortices later consolidated, allowing for Gilda to quickly intensify to typhoon status at 0000 UTC on December 14; by this time a small eye had been identified within the cyclone. After reaching typhoon status, Gilda assumed a west-northwesterly course at a steady pace while gradually intensifying. The development of a trough in the Luzon Strait caused the forward motion of the typhoon to slow on December 16, prompting the JTWC to forecast a recurvature to the north and northeast at the time. However, the trough remained weak, allowing for Gilda to accelerate westward towards the Philippines. At 1800 UTC, the JMA indicated that Gilda had peaked with a minimum barometric pressure of 925 mbar (hPa; 27.32 inHg). Twelve hours later, the storm attained its peak maximum sustained winds of 280 km/h (175 mph), which Gilda maintained for another twelve hours. Shortly after 0000 UTC on December 18, Gilda made landfall on Samar Island in the Philippines with a slightly weakened intensity. By the day's end, the typhoon emerged into the South China Sea, where it began to steadily weaken. At roughly 1200 UTC on December 21, the system was downgraded to tropical storm status, at which time it made a final landfall near Phan Rang‚ÄìTh√°p Ch√†m in Vietnam. Weakening inland, the tropical cyclone was last noted over western Cambodia on December 22. Preparations and impact On December 19, a LORAN station in the western Philippines documented maximum sustained winds of 150 km/h (90 mph) in addition to gusts as high as 260 km/h (160 mph). Across nine provinces in the central Philippines, at least 23 people were killed and another 60,000 were displaced, and Gilda was considered one of the country's worst tropical cyclones in recent memory. The sinking of the motorship Rizal in the waters off of southern Luzon resulted in the deaths of 14 people, though 64 others survived the capsizing. Homes and public work projects sustained heavy damage from the storm. On Samar, damage to crops, homes, and communication lines totaled US$500,000. Some of the damage on the island was considered the worst in 30 years. About 2,500 homes were swept away by storm surge and flood in 27 towns. The coconut industry suffered a major blow from the typhoon, and local authorities indicated that coconut production would take roughly four years to recovery to pre-typhoon levels. The fallen lines disrupted telecommunications during the storm's passage. A group of 100 teachers attending a convention were feared to have been killed in Zumarraga, Samar but were later found. Overall, damage from Gilda in the Philippines amounted to US$1.5 million. Following the storm, Philippine government welfare agencies quickened recovery efforts due to the approach of Christmas. Damage from Gilda in Vietnam, if any, remains unknown.

Z√© Povinho became first a symbol of the Portuguese working-class people, and eventually into the unofficial personification of Portugal.

The company folded in October 2001 when their official website went offline. In 1996 the company signed a sales and distribution agreement with Broderbund, giving the company exclusive North American retail distribution rights for all Headbone CD-ROMs. History Susan Lammers graduated from Stanford University in 1979. After working for Microsoft for around eight years, she formed Headbone Interactive with her husband, investing her own money to create and design edutainment CD-ROMs for children. In 1995, the first title, Elroy Goes Bugzerk, was released. It was followed by a sequel, Elroy Hits the Pavement, in 1996. Around that same time, a collection of software called The Gigglebone Gang was created. Four titles were released under that collection (see below). In 1997, a educative and creative website, the Headbone Zone, was created. Around 1998, Headbone Interactive left the CD-ROM business, citing mediocre success despite positive reviews of eight titles, and cut down its staff. That same year, Headbone created Headbone Television and began creating televised programming. Lammers left the company a few months later. In 1999, two television series produced by Headbone began to air: first, \\"Fidgetmore Academy\\" on Fox Family, then \\"Hugo Takes a D-Tour\\" on Discovery Kids. Headbone was purchased by Bonus.com in 2000 and shut down in October that same year as the Headbone Zone website went offline. Awards PC Gamer US named Elroy Goes Bugzerk the \\"Best Educational Product\\" of 1995. The editors wrote, \\"The game's sense of humor is perfectly aimed at its intended audience, and the story is well-written and engaging. Elroy Goes Bugzerk does a better job of hiding educational content in an entertaining game than any other title from 1995.\\" MacUser gave Bugzerk a score of 4 out of 5, and named it one of 1995's top 50 CD-ROMs. The magazine proceeded to nominate the game for its award for the best children's software of 1995, which ultimately went to Thinkin' Things Collection 3.

He was awarded the Empire Gallantry Medal (EGM) for actions on the cargo ship on 6 September 1939. The ship was one of the first British merchantmen sunk during the Second World War. The award of the EGM was gazetted on 13 October 1939, and the medal was exchanged for the George Cross (GC) in 1943. Turner was also awarded the Lloyd's War Medal for Bravery at Sea, and a gold medal by the Liverpool Shipwreck and Humane Society. Turner was the radio officer on SS Manaar, a cargo steamer of built in 1917 and operated by the Brocklebank Line. En route from Liverpool to Calcutta, the vessel was attacked by the German submarine U-38 at , in the northern Atlantic Ocean about northwest of Cape St Vincent and about west of Cape Roca. The merchant vessel returned fire, the first time that a merchantman had fired at a U-boat in the war. Turner remained at his post, sending an SOS. When most of the crew abandoned the stricken ship, Turner was accidentally left behind with two wounded crewmates, described in the medal citation as lascars. He was ordered to escape to the master's boat, but refused to go until the two other crewmen had also been rescued. While under fire from U-38, Turner tried to launch two lifeboats, but one filled with water and the other was destroyed by enemy action with one of the wounded crew inside. He put the other man in the waterlogged boat, and they both escaped to the master's boat. U-38 sank Manaar with torpedoes. Seven of the 62 crew were killed, and survivors were rescued by the merchantmen , and . When a ship on which Turner subsequently sailed was also torpedoed he lost a leg, then spent the remainder of the war in a German prisoner-of-war camp. Turner survived the war, but was one of the 49 people killed in the Hither Green rail crash on Sunday 5 November 1967. At the time of his death, he was living in Staplecross in Sussex. He was survived by his wife and two children. A painting of Turner by Bernard Hailstone is in the Government Art Collection, on display at the Ministry of Defence in London.

Investigating Innocence was founded in 2013 by private investigator Bill Clutter to assist nationwide Innocence Project groups in investigating innocence claims. \\"Once we have a case that meets our criteria, we'll put private investigators to work on it. A lot of these cases need investigators,\\" said Kelly Thompson, executive director of Investigating Innocence. Prior to his work on Investigating Innocence, Clutter was one of the founders of the Illinois Innocence Project. Investigating Innocence also has a board composed of exonerees that reviews incoming cases. Clutter is also advocating for the creation of a statewide conviction integrity unit for the state of Illinois, where Investigating Innocence is based. Conviction integrity units, which investigate innocence claims, have popped up in recent years in major metropolitan areas such as Dallas, New York, and Chicago. As government organizations, these groups have a greater ability to access evidence and assist defendants than independent innocence organizations. Illinois has a conviction integrity unit, which has seen over 70 convictions overturned since 2017, but it serves only the Chicago area and smaller counties lack funding for such units. \\"It would be a financial burden for this office to have a truly independent staff of at least one investigator and one attorney to review the claims, and there are not enough claims like this in a county like Sangamon to warrant those resources,\\" Clutter said. \\"But on a state level, it makes sense to have it housed in the attorney general's office.\\"  Notable Cases  = David Camm (Exonerated) = One of the organization's most prominent cases was the exoneration of David Camm, a former Indiana state trooper who was wrongfully convicted of the murders of his wife and two children. Approximately five years after he was arrested, DNA evidence identified a convicted felon named Charles Boney as having been at the crime scene. Boney is currently serving 225 years for the murders. On October 24, 2013, David Camm, walked free after 13-years in prison after a jury in Lebanon, Indiana found him not guilty in a third re-trial. His case was the first exoneration for Investigating Innocence, which was started earlier that year. Bill Clutter, who started the project, was a member of Camm‚Äôs defense team and suggested conducting an animated crime scene reconstruction, which helped persuade the jury that David Camm is innocent. Students at the University of Indiana assisted Clutter and the Camm defense team in reviewing the case and provided a fresh set of eyes. Clutter simulated how the actual killer, Charles Boney, infamously known as the \\"Shoe Bandit\\" who had been released from prison a few weeks before the murders after serving nearly a decade for holding women at gunpoint, braced his left hand leaving a palm print on the outside of Kim Camm‚Äôs Ford Bronco as he knelt on the floorboard and extended his right hand to fire the gun that killed five year- old Jill, and her brother Brad, age 7. David Camm, a decorated Indiana Police Officer, was wrongfully charged with the murders of his family based on junk science. On September 28, 2000, David Camm came home at approximately 9:26 p.m. and found his wife Kimberly, and his two children Bradley, 7, and Jill, 5, shot to death in the garage of their home in Georgetown, Indiana. His wife and two children were last seen leaving swim practice and heading home around 7:00 p.m.; which was about the same time David arrived at the Georgetown Community Church to play basketball. David, a former Indiana State Police trooper, had been playing basketball with 11 other people at the time his wife and children were killed. Three days later, David Camm was charged with his family‚Äôs murder based on a misinterpretation of bloodstain patterns on his t-shirt. There were 8 small stains of blood that were mistakenly interpreted as high velocity impact spatter by a crime scene photographer who had no formal training or experience in bloodstain pattern analysis. The photographer, Robert Stites, was sent to the crime scene by Rodney Englert, who was hired by Floyd County prosecutors as a blood stain and crime scene expert, since Englert was not available to visit the crime scene, he sent his photographer, Stites instead. Some of the leading experts in the country on bloodstain pattern analysis analyzed the bloodstains on David‚Äôs t-shirt. They have concluded that the 8 tiny bloodstains were actually transfer stains rather than high velocity impact stains from a gun. These transfer stains occurred when David‚Äôs t-shirt came into contact with his daughter‚Äôs hair when he removed his injured son from the vehicle. The main expert used to convict David Camm, Rodney Englert, was also involved in convicting another innocent person, Julie Rea. Katherine Liell, who represented Camm after he was convicted, contacted private investigator Bill Clutter in June 2000 because her other client, Julie Rea was under investigation by a Special Prosecutor Edwin Parkinson (the same person who wrongfully charged Curtis Lovelace in Quincy, Illinois). Clutter was investigating serial killer Tommy Lynn Sells for the 1986 murders of Dyke and Karen Rhoads in Paris, Illinois, that led to two innocent men being framed for that murder, Randy Steidl and Herb Whitlock. Clutter recognized similarities in Julie Rea‚Äôs case (a knife from the kitchen of the victims was used in both cases, and the time was identical, with both crimes occurring at 4 a.m.). Since her client was facing the death penalty if she were charged, Liell planned to hire Clutter under a new reform called the Capital Litigation Trust Fund that was enacted as one of the death penalty reforms. Clutter suggested if her client was charged, the first suspect that fit the MO was a serial killer Tommy Lynn Sells who targeted children after his release from prison in 1997, the year Joel was murdered. Special Prosecutor Parkinson, like prosecutors in New Albany did in the Camm case, relied on bloodstain \\"expert\\" Rod Englert to provide probable cause to arrest and convict both Camm and Rea in 2002. Englert claimed that there was evidence of cast-off stains on Julie‚Äôs nightshirt. Clutter was never hired by Liell because Special Prosecutor Parkinson filed notice of his intent not to seek the death penalty a few weeks before additional reforms by the Illinois Supreme Court went into effect that required that appointment of two capital qualified attorneys and enhanced discovery, allowing for depositions in cases where the death penalty was charged. Clutter conducted the post-conviction investigation for the Illinois Innocence Project, which Clutter started in 2001. His investigation found two key witnesses who placed Sells in Lawrenceville at the time of the murders, convincing Texas Ranger John Allen, who investigated Sells‚Äô other crimes, to sign an affidavit in support of Julie‚Äôs petition to overturn her conviction. She was freed from prison and received a certificate of innocence. On June 2, 2003, an ethics complaint with the American Academy of Forensic Science was lodged against Englert by a number of other bloodstain experts alleging that Englert misrepresented his education, training and experience. This prompted Englert to sue them for slander. The bloodstain experts who signed the complaint included Herb MacDonell, (who established the professions of blood stain pattern experts in 1971, with the publication of his book \\"Flight Characteristics and Stain Patterns of Human Blood.\\") Stuart James, Terry Laber, and Bart Epstein. MacDonell was also sued for slander for calling Englert among other things \\"a forensic whore\\", \\"liar-for-hire\\", \\"a very smooth charlatan\\" and \\"The Bin Laden of Bloodstains\\". All of these bloodstain experts that Englert sued have expressed opinions in support of David Camm‚Äôs innocence. Almost five years after David Camm was arrested, forensic science identified the real killer; a man named Charles Boney, a career criminal who was released from prison a few months before he killed the Camm family. Yet, despite this evidence, David Camm remains in jail today awaiting a third re-trial. This case is fraught with tunnel vision. Police and prosecutors ignored a sweatshirt found at the scene that had been purchased from the Indiana Department of Corrections that had the moniker \\"BACKBONE\\" written in black ink on the inside collar. A male DNA profile indicating the wearer‚Äôs DNA was discovered when forensic scientists from Cellmark, a private lab, swabbed the collar of the sweatshirt and obtained a full male DNA profile. In February 2005, Charles Boney, was identified by CODIS, which is a criminal offender DNA data base. His prison nickname was BACKBONE! In addition to this evidence, Boney‚Äôs palm print was identified on the outside passenger door of the Camm‚Äôs Ford Bronco, where he placed his left palm as he leaned in with his right hand holding the gun to shoot and kill both children. The children had been seated in the backseat when they were shot. Jill was still wearing her seatbelt. Her brother Brad was attempting to escape to the back-cargo area when he was shot. Known as \\"The Shoe Bandit\\", Boney had spent almost a decade in prison for a series of crimes in Bloomington, Indiana, in which he held women at gunpoint while he satisfied his foot fetish by stealing their shoes. David Camm‚Äôs wife had struggled with her attacker, who made her remove her shoes and her pants during the attack. Another key piece of forensic evidence is Kim Camm‚Äôs DNA that was found on the shirt sleeve of the sweatshirt, consistent with Boney‚Äôs arm around her neck and coming into contact with her mouth. When Boney was first interviewed by the Indiana State Police, he denied knowing David Camm. Police investigators were the ones who suggested that Boney had met David Camm playing basketball when they questioned him. Boney initially denied ever playing basketball with Camm. He also claimed to have given his clothing to the Salvation Army when he was released from prison, which he later admitted was a lie. When police discovered Boney‚Äôs palm print on the outside passenger door of Kim Camm‚Äôs Ford Bronco a few weeks later, he changed his story again. At this point, he was given two choices. He could be either a witness for the prosecution to help prosecutors re-convict David Camm, or he could be a defendant facing the death penalty. After giving several contradictory statements, Boney claimed that he met David Camm playing basketball at a community park, after which he agreed to sell David Camm the gun that killed his family. He said he gave the gun to Camm wrapped in his sweatshirt. However, this story fails to account for how Kim Camm‚Äôs DNA from saliva got on the sleeve of his sweatshirt or how Boney‚Äôs hand print was found on the Camm family Bronco at the scene of the crime. Prosecutor‚Äôs admitted that the credibility of its star witness Charles Boney is doubtful.  Darlie Routier  Like the case of David Camm who was finally exonerated after serving 13 years in prison, Darlie Routier was accused and convicted of the brutal murders of her two precious children‚Äîbased solely on controversial forensic evidence known as bloodstain pattern analysis.Like the case of David Camm who was finally exonerated after serving 13 years in prison, Darlie Routier was accused and convicted of the brutal murders of her two precious children‚Äîbased solely on controversial forensic evidence known as bloodstain pattern analysis. She suffered the trauma of having been awakened by an intruder who slit her throat. This unknown assailant also stabbed her two boys sleeping next to her. Darlie's 911 call is chilling and horrific. Stricken with panic, fear, and the shock of having to watch the life drain out of the bodies of her two small boys, she nearly bled to death waiting for help to arrive. And to make matters worse, she was tried, convicted and sentenced to death based on the testimony of Tom Bevel, a hired bloodstain pattern expert. Bevel testified that he magnified small patterns of stains on the mother's nightshirt that he interpreted as cast-off patterns, which to him suggested that it was the mother who wielded the knife that killed her two children. Bevel was the same bloodstain expert who was responsible for the wrongful conviction of David Camm. Camm, a ten year veteran of the Indiana State Police, was acquitted and set free on Oct. 24, 2013, after spending 13 years in prison for a crime he did not commit. A reconstruction of the crime scene, including a palm print and DNA, proved that the murder of his wife and two children was committed by a career criminal who was motivated by shoe fetish. Bevel interpreted eight tiny dots of blood on Camm‚Äôs t-shirt and concluded these were created by high velocity impact spatter from having fired the gun that killed his family. Some of the most respected bloodstain analyst in the county came to a different conclusion‚Äîthat these stains were transferred from the hairs of his daughter when David attempted CPR on his son. Bloodstain scientists Terry Laber and Bart Epstein, who assisted with the defense of David Camm, were hired by Darlie Routier‚Äôs public defenders. They analyzed the bloodstain interpretations of Bevel and came to a different conclusion about these patterns. They provided a favorable report to her defense attorneys. However, the testimony of the prosecution‚Äôs bloodstain expert, Tom Bevel, went unchallenged. A private attorney was hired by Darlie‚Äôs family a month before trial and failed to call Laber or Epstein. He told the family he thought he could handle this through his cross-examination of Bevel. The attorney kept the retainer for himself, and spared the family the expense of flying the experts to Dallas. Darlie‚Äôs case is very similar to another mother who was wrongfully convicted of stabbing her 10 year-old son. On Oct. 13, 1987, in Lawrenceville, IL, Julie Rea was awakened at 4 a.m. to the sound of her son‚Äôs scream. When she rushed to his room across the hall, in the dark of the night, she collided with a child serial killer, Tommy Lynn Sells. He dropped the knife on the floor, and began beating her with his fists. Despite physical injuries, including a gash on her arm, a black eye, bruises and abrasions, Julie became the prime suspect. She was charged with capital murder three years later, after the elected prosecutor who resisted pressure to arrest her left office. A new prosecutor hired bloodstain \\"expert\\" Rodney Englert, who examined Julie‚Äôs nightshirt and found what he interpreted as evidence of \\"cast-off\\". After she was convicted in March 2002, True crime author Diane Fanning published Through the Window: The Terrifying True Story of Cross-Country Killer Tommy Lynn Sells. Sells told Fanning about a murder in Illinois in which he had killed a child and was startled by the mother who came into the room. Two years later, Texas Ranger John Allen provided an affidavit in support of Julie‚Äôs petition for a new trial. The Illinois Innocence Project had corroborated the serial killer‚Äôs confession. Julie was acquitted in a new trial, and the courts have issued her a Certificate of Innocence. Darlie Routier, however, remains on death row in Texas, awaiting execution based on the same bloodstain interpretation evidence that convicted Julie Rea. Private investigator Gary Dunn commented after the release of his client, David Camm: \\"Bloodstain evidence is mostly subjective. One bloodstain expert said it‚Äôs like looking at the clouds, they all see something different\\". In 2009, the National Academy of Sciences released a critique of forensic science practices in U.S. courtrooms, noting that since the introduction of DNA testing in 1989 that \\"faulty science\\" was found to be responsible for the wrongful convictions in a number of post-conviction DNA exonerations. Bloodstain Pattern Analysis (BPA) was one of the disciplines that was criticized because of the interjection of \\"examiner bias\\". The report noted \\"many sources of variability arise with the production of bloodstain patterns, and their interpretation is not nearly as straightforward as the process implies\\". The report found, \\"some experts extrapolate far beyond what can be supported\\", and went on to conclude that \\"extra care must be given to the way in which the analyses are presented in court. The uncertainties associated with bloodstain pattern analysis are enormous\\". (Source: Strengthening Forensic Science in the United States: A Path Forward, The National Academies Press, Washington DC (2009), pp. 42, 177-179.)  Curtis Lovelace (Exonerated)  In 2017, Investigating Innocence was also instrumental in the defense of Curtis Lovelace, a former prosecutor who was charged with murder in Quincy, Illinois, in the death of his first wife Cory Lovelace. The organization referred the case to the Exoneration Project, based at the University of Chicago, which agreed to represent Lovelace pro bono. Lovelace was indicted eight years after his wife died of liver failure, a condition known as fatty liver. Investigating Innocence helped develop key evidence that contributed to his exoneration. In 1990, Lovelace was team captain of the Fighting Illini football team that won the Citrus Bowl. On a change of venue, a Springfield, Illinois jury took less than two hours to acquit Lovelace on March 10, 2017.  Rodney Lincoln (Exonerated)  Investigating Innocence conducted the investigation that linked serial killer Tommy Lynn Sells to the April 27, 1982 murder of JoAnne Tate in St. Louis for which Rodney Lincoln was wrongfully convicted. The investigation of Bill Clutter was featured on Crime Watch Daily, which triggered the recantation of Melissa DeBoer who was seven-years-old and left for dead when she witnessed the murder of her mother. Melissa‚Äôs mistaken identification of Rodney Lincoln led to his conviction in 1983. This new evidence persuaded Missouri Governor Eric Greitens to commute Rodney Lincoln‚Äôs sentence. On June 3, 2018, Lincoln was freed from prison.  Randy Steidl  Bill Clutter, who founded Investigating Innocence, conducted the post-conviction investigation that helped free Randy Steidl from death row. Clutter‚Äôs pre-trial investigation also helped free Rolando Cruz and Alejandro Hernandez from death row in Illinois. Clutter was among a handful of private investigators and lawyers who were credited by Chicago Tribune columnist Eric Zorn for helping to abolish the death penalty in Illinois.  Tom McMillen  As of 2019, the group is advocating for Tom McMillen, who was convicted and sentenced to life in prison for the 1989 murder of Melissa Koontz. Clutter says that two key witnesses were never called to testify in the case. Their testimony would have contradicted key testimony against McMillen. The Crime: On June 24, 1989, at 10:06 p.m., 19-year-old Melisa Koontz left work at Cub Foods where she worked as a cashier on the Southwest edge of Springfield, Illinois. Her decomposed body was found a week later July 1, 1989, laying face-up in a cornfield approximately 1.5 miles away. She had been stabbed multiple times. Multiple witnesses observed a suspicious young white male lurking in the employee parking lot around the time Melisa exited the store. Less than an hour later, at 10:50 p.m., her vehicle, a black Ford Escort hatchback, was discovered abandoned on the Waverly Blacktop Road, a rural country road that led to her parent‚Äôs home in Waverly, IL, approximately 15.2 miles from Cub Foods. There was circumstantial evidence of a sexual assault. The buttons of the victim‚Äôs shirt were torn off and the clasp of her bra was broken. Her skirt had been rolled up. DNA testing on the bra and shirt have identified a partial male DNA profile eliminating Tom McMillen and his co-defendants Gary Edgington and Donald Johnston as the source. Tom McMillen was charged with capital murder on May 15, 1990, accused of the murder of 19-year-old Melissa Koontz. He was convicted in July 1991 and sentenced to life in prison. His conviction hinged on the testimony of Donald \\"Goose\\" Johnston, an alcoholic and intellectually disabled person who falsely confessed to the crime and later identified McMillen as the killer in a plea deal that resulted in Johnson serving less than 7 years in prison. McMillen was convicted by a jury based on the false testimony of Donald Johnston and was given a life sentence. Gary Edginton was tried separately. He was also convicted and received a life sentence based on the testimony of Donald \\"Goose\\" Johnston. He is being represented by the Innocence Project in New York. Donald \\"Goose\\" Johnston Four days after Melissa Koontz disappeared, Donald Johnston sees a missing person poster and tells a police officer he had seen the missing woman in Carlinville, Illinois, 46 miles from where she disappeared. This was the first of many false statements Johnston would make about the case. McMillen was denied access to Donald Johnston‚Äôs mental health records by the court when his defense attorney requested the records. Johnston recanted his testimony in a video-recorded statement in 2008, and signed a medical authorization allowing for the release of his mental health records. These records show he has an IQ of 54. According to the U.S. Supreme Court, \\"These persons are a special risk of wrongful conviction.\\" (Hall v. Florida). Tom McMillen‚Äôs defense attorney Michael Costello provided an affidavit as to the significance of Donald Johnston‚Äôs mental health records. \\"Had the mental health records of Donald Johnston been disclosed prior to trial I would have challenged Donald Johnston‚Äôs mental competency to testify.\\" Richard Leo is one of the nation‚Äôs leading experts on the psychology of false confessions. He conducted a video-taped forensic interview of Donald Johnston in 2008. \\"In evaluating whether a witness is providing police with reliable information, a person who claims to have witnessed a murder should be able to accurately relate details to police that match up with the crime scene evidence. They should be able to provide facts of the crime that would not be generally known to the public. Based on my review of all available statements, Donald Johnston was never able to provide accurate details to police.\\" Danny Pocklington Danny was 15-years-old when his cousin Donald Johnston told police that Danny was with him when Melissa Koontz was abducted and killed. Danny receives social security disability for intellectual disability since he was a teenager. He too, falsely confessed to the murder of Melisa Koontz. He served 6 years in a juvenile correctional facility until he turned 21. He brought a silver necklace to school and claimed it had been taken from Melisa Koontz. Police reports indicate the Koontz family was shown this silver necklace, but it didn‚Äôt belong to their daughter. There was no evidence at the time of the investigation that a silver necklace was missing. At autopsy the medical examiner removed a gold necklace that victim was wearing when her body was found. Pocklington provided another silver necklace to police claiming that he got it from Donald Johnston. Police failed to document whether this necklace had been shown to the family. Danny was mentally unfit to testify and was not called as a witness at the trials of McMillen or Edgington. Mary Pocklington The mother of Danny, she was charged with providing false statements to police. She is the one who gave police the silver necklace that she got from her son. This silver chain was offered as a key piece of evidence at trial corroborating the testimony of Donald Johnson. The mother of the victim testified that the silver chain was similar to one that her daughter had. However, she made this statement for the first time in court and never told police about her daughter having silver necklace. The biggest forensic lead in the case was an unknown thumb print on the rear-view mirror of the victim‚Äôs car. In 2008, the Sangamon County Sheriff agreed to run the print in AFIS, which identified an identified an individual who had never been investigated in the original investigation. The investigation by police at the time of the crime interviewed the victim‚Äôs family to identify people who may have driven the car. The individual whose thumb print was identified the Sangamon County Sheriff in 2008 was never mentioned as a person who had been inside the vehicle. His name never surfaced in the original investigation. He has refused to voluntarily provide a sample of his DNA so it can be compared to the unknown male profile from the bra that recent DNA testing has identified. This DNA is significant because who ever killed Melissa Koontz grabbed the front of her bra and ripped it open. The DNA profile excludes Tom McMillen, Gary Edgington and Donald Johnston.  Jamie Snow  This violent and senseless crime occurred in Bloomington, Illinois on Easter Sunday 1991. The murderer walked away with approximately $60, as Jamie Snow ate dinner with his children. The tragedy was compounded when, after several years without a clear suspect, Jamie Snow was arrested and improperly charged by police and prosecutors willing to convict him by any means necessary, even after passing a polygraph exam. The conviction was only possible using testimony of unreliable witnesses, many who had their own legal issues, people easily coerced into accepting deals, some more than willing to give false testimony. Jailhouse informants claimed that Snow \\"confessed\\" to them while awaiting trial. Many of which have now recanted their testimonies in sworn affidavits. There has never been any physical evidence tying Jamie Snow to this case. Information has also come forward that at least one jury member knew Jamie Snow and did not inform the court of same. Jamie has spent the last 14 years in prison fighting to present new evidence demonstrating his innocence. The original trial violated his constitutional rights in several ways, many which stem from a lack of representation by his public defender, who presented little to no defense. Not surprisingly, this attorney has since been disbarred, yet Jamie‚Äôs conviction remains. With an over-zealous prosecution and no proper defense, Snow had no more chance at trial than William Little did when faced with an armed gunman. The Prosecution relied on one \\"star witness\\" who provided critical eye-witness identification. Yet this same witness was UNABLE to identify Snow in photo books or during a line-up which occurred soon after the crime. It wasn‚Äôt until 1999, 8 years later and AFTER Snow‚Äôs arrest, that the \\"star witness\\" identified Snow upon seeing his photograph in a local newspaper. Only at the trial, 10 years after the fact, did the \\"star witness\\" speak of Snow‚Äôs \\"eyes\\" being \\"unforgettable,\\" yet he had seen Jamie in numerous close up photos and the in person line-up not long after the incident occurred. Approximately 4 years after conviction police radio tapes disclosed to Snow that \\"star witness\\" could NOT have seen what he testified to seeing. Jamie has always maintained his innocence, and continues to do so. Jamie is represented by Tara Thompson with The Exoneration Project.  Christopher Vaughn  On June 14, 2007, the Vaughn family from Oswego loaded up the family vehicle and headed for Springfield, IL to spend the day at Knight‚Äôs Action Park. Just after 5 a.m., his wife asked him to pull off the highway because she was feeling sick, a side-effect of having stress related migraine headaches. A passing motorist stopped to render assistance to Christopher Vaughn, who was found walking along frontage road of Interstate 55 south of Joliet. He had been shot twice. Their three children, Abigayle, 12, Cassandra, 11, and Blake, 8, were found dead in the rear passenger seat when paramedics arrived. Each had been shot twice. His wife, found in the front passenger seat of the family vehicle had a single gunshot wound under her chin. A 9 mm handgun belonging to her husband was found on the floorboard near Kimberly Vaughn‚Äôs feet. Vaughn initially told a man who stopped to render assistance that he believed he had been shot by his wife. However, when later interviewed by Illinois State Police investigators he had no memory of the incident. During the interview, he defended his wife and told investigators \\"she couldn‚Äôt have done it. . . She‚Äôs not that type of person\\". Vaughn was arrested on the morning of the funeral for his family. Probable cause to arrest Vaughn was based on blood stain interpretations that were later discredited by DNA testing. A psychiatrist later explained that Vaughn may have been experiencing dissociative amnesia. This is a form of memory loss caused when a person witnesses a traumatic event like watching his entire family die in an automobile crash and being the sole survivor, according to the Diagnostic and Statistical Manual of Mental Disorders published by the American Academy of Psychiatric Association. A forensic pathologist retained as an expert witness for the prosecutor later described Kimberly Vaughn‚Äôs injuries as consistent with a self-inflicted gunshot wound when he was deposed prior to trial. Vaughn faced the death penalty. More than a year after he was arrested, the Food and Drug Administration issued an alert in Dec. of 2008, warning that patients taking the prescription medication Topamax had a statistically significant risk of suicidal ideation and behavior. Kimberly Vaughn had been prescribed the medication Topamax for the treatment of stress related migraine headaches. A week before her death, Kimberly Vaughn reported experiencing symptoms that the FDA would later identify as early warning signs of adverse side effects from the medication. On May 24, 2007, Kimberly Vaughn told her doctor that she was experiencing anxiety and a big change in her personality. Other family members reported witnessing agitation and an episode of a panic attack during a recent family outing. Nearly two years later, on May 9, 2009, the FDA issued new warning labels and medication guides for Topamax. The warning label inserted into medications sold after that date advised patients to immediately call their health care provider if they are experiencing: \\"new or worse anxiety; feeling agitated or restless; panic attacks; new or worse irritability; other unusual changes in behavior or mood.\\" A state police crime scene investigator described how he was persuaded by his interpretation of the crime scene evidence that this was a case of murder-suicide committed by the wife during a deposition that was taken in the weeks before Gov. Quinn signed legislation abolishing the death penalty. Former ISP Crime Scene Investigator Robert Deel said, \\"every time I would come up with something that the evidence would suggest or support or you would be able to at least follow the evidence to come to a logical conclusion, basically I was just given some other crazy way that this could have occurred or they would change their theory of what happened to try to match the evidence rather than letting the evidence dictate to you the events that occurred\\". Deel said he cautioned investigators to wait before leaping to any conclusions. However, after voicing his concerns, Deel was isolated from the investigation by the Will County State‚Äôs Attorney‚Äôs office. \\"What he described was tunnel vision that infected the investigation of the Vaughn case\\", said Bill Clutter, who is director of investigations for the newly formed innocence project. Clutter was involved in the investigation that helped exonerate former death row inmates Randy Steidl, Rolando Cruz and Alejandro Hernandez. There were 20 men who were freed from death row in Illinois who were actually innocent. A Governor‚Äôs Commission would later study the causes of why these men had been wrongfully convicted, and concluded that most of the cases had been plagued with tunnel vision. This is when police investigators leap to conclusions about a suspect‚Äôs guilt, while disregarding evidence that points toward other suspects. The Will County State‚Äôs Attorney‚Äôs office has been involved in other high profile cases where it arrested and convicted the wrong person. Most notable is the case of Kevin Fox, a father who was mistakenly arrested in 2004 and convicted of the murder of his three year old daughter. More recently, a police officer was arrested as the alleged Honey Bee Killer in Will County, but charges were later dismissed after his alibi was corroborated. A seminar called \\"Side-effects: Homicidal and Suicidal Behavior Influenced by Prescription Medications\\" was presented on February 18, 2013, at Chicago-Kent College of Law from 1-3 p.m., featuring Dr. David Healy. A Wales physician, Healy was the first doctor to link suicidal and homicidal behavior as a side effect of some prescription medications. He was one of the experts hired to testify by Vaughn‚Äôs defense team. However, after the death penalty was abolished in Illinois the resources of the Capital Litigation Trust Fund were no longer available to help defend Vaughn. His defense team was discharged from the case in March 2011, after the Will County Board refused to provide funding for his defense team. The case was handed off to a new attorney, who refused pro bono assistance from a major law firm that had been recruited by Rob Warden of the Center on Wrongful Convictions based at Northwestern Law School. Vaughn was convicted eight months later, in August 2012.  Notable Members  Prominent Investigating Innocence members are exoneree Randy Steidl, exoneree Ray Krone, private investigator Paul J. Ciolino, Cyndy Short, a Kansas City attorney who recently freed Reggie Griffin, and attorney Jose Baez. = See also = *List of wrongful convictions in the United States *Darlie Routier *David Camm = References = = External links = * Official site Category:Wrongful conviction advocacy Category:Government watchdog groups in the United States Category:Legal advocacy organizations in the United States Category:Non-profit organizations based in Illinois Category:Overturned convictions in the United States Category:Criminal defense organizations ","title":"Investigating Innocence"},{"id":"43336993","title":"1998 Ibero-American Championships in Athletics ‚Äì Results"},{"id":"43337002","text":"Play-mate of the Apes is a 2002 American direct-to-DVD erotic film directed by John Bacchus.

It consisted of a region surrounding modern-day Taipei in northern Taiwan, including modern-day Hsinchu, Hsinchu County, Taoyuan City, New Taipei City, Taipei, Keelung, and Yilan County. The reorganization started after Imperial Commissioner Shen Pao-chen demanded that another prefecture be added in Taiwan to revamp the administrative organization of the northern area of the island. The walls of the prefecture capital were completed in 1884. In 1885, work commenced to establish Fokien- Taiwan Province and the island's capital, which had formerly been in the south, was temporarily moved north to Taipeh (Taipei), which was under construction. In 1887, the province was declared and reorganized into four prefectures: Taipeh, Taiwan, Tainan, and Taitung. Taipeh Prefecture included the districts of , Gilan (ÂÆúËò≠Á∏£), and Hsinchu (Êñ∞Á´πÁ∏£), plus the sub-prefecture of Keelung (Âü∫ÈöÜÂª≥). Due to multiple factors, the island's capital permanently remained at Taipeh-fu; modern-day Taipei carries on the name of this prefecture. After Japanese rule began in 1895, most areas included in the prefecture (other than modern-day Hsinchu and Hsinchu County) were included in the new Taihoku Prefecture in 1920.

Designed by Adrian Smith + Gordon Gill Architecture, the building rises and is the second-tallest skyscraper in the United States and the Western Hemisphere, the 15th tallest building in the world, the tallest residential building in the world (the much taller Burj Khalifa in Dubai has 900 residential units, but is mixed-use), and the tallest building outside Asia by roof height. The site of the Central Park Tower was formerly occupied by two buildings at 225 West 57th Street and 1780 Broadway, which were demolished in 2011‚Äì2012. In mid-2012, Nordstrom committed to opening their first store in New York City within the base of the tower. A proposed cantilever above the Art Students League of New York's building at 215 West 57th Street, intended to maximize views of nearby Central Park, resulted in several lawsuits, but was later allowed because construction had already started. Despite uncertainty about the final design and complications relating to the tower's financing, excavations at the site started in May 2014. Actual construction started in February 2015, with the building topping out in September 2019. History =Planning= In the summer of 2005, Extell purchased the former home of the Hard Rock Cafe and Broadway Dance Center at 221 West 57th Street and the neighboring property fronting 58th Street for a total of $67.5 million. Combined, the two parcels yielded over of buildable space. The Broadway Dance Center, which occupied five stories of the building in a lease that ran until 2012, was served a notice of default by Extell in September 2005 for operating without the required public assembly permit. Extell also revoked the Center's use of the building's internal staircases due to theft concerns and offered the Center $1 million to move to a new home on 55th Street. In January 2006, Extell added to the assemblage by purchasing of air rights from the landmarked Osborne Apartments at 205 West 57th Street. The purchase of the former B. F. Goodrich Company showroom at 1780 Broadway and two contiguous properties for $57.5 million in June 2006 added of development rights. Extell added another 58th Street parcel in September 2006, paying $14 million for the 20 foot wide site which held of development rights. Two months later, Extell paid $2.23 million for of air rights from the Saint Thomas Choir School at 202 West 58th Street. In January 2007, the estate of developer Sol Goldman sold Extell the remaining air rights from the 13-story apartment building at 200 West 58th Street. Combined, these purchases created an assemblage which could yield a building. The site at 225 West 57th Street was originally home to an eight-story building built in 1909 as part of Manhattan's \\"Automobile Row\\" on 57th Street. Designed by Howard Van Doren Shaw, the New York City Landmarks Preservation Commission attempted to protect the building and the neighboring 1780 Broadway in 2009, after a failed attempt at landmarking the structures in 1994. However, after pushback by Extell and Speaker of the New York City Council Christine Quinn, the Preservation Commission allowed Extell to tear down the structures while protecting only the facade of 1780 Broadway in a 6 to 3 vote. Some preservationists such as the Historic Districts Council and New York Landmarks Conservancy expressed dissatisfaction that the New York City Council had influenced the decision by making clear that they would veto any designation the Landmarks Preservation Committee made on the properties. The American Institute of Architects, New York State Assembly member Richard N. Gottfried, and the Landmarks Preservation Council of Illinois spoke in favor of the building's designation while the Real Estate Board of New York and City Council members Melinda Katz, Daniel Garodnick, and Jessica Lappin spoke against landmark status. Extell demolished 225 West 57th Street in 2011 and tore down the interiors of 1780 Broadway at the end of 2012. In the summer of 2012, Nordstrom committed to opening their first store in New York City, signaling their intent to occupy at the base of the tower. The company initially paid a $102.5 million down payment to occupy the first five floors of the building along with two basement floors. Around the same time, Extell purchased the neighboring building at 223 West 58th Street for $25 million and took out a new $300 million mortgage from The Blackstone Group on the assemblage. The new mortgage allowed Extell to repay a $250 million loan from HSBC on the properties. At the end of the year, Extell revealed that Adrian Smith + Gordon Gill would design the tower and that it would rise to become the second-tallest building in New York City. Adrian Smith's firm, which had been recommended by Nordstrom, beat out other notable contenders for the design including Herzog & de Meuron, SHoP Architects, Jean Nouvel, Foster and Partners, and Rogers Stirk Harbour + Partners. At the time, the building was expected to rise , open in 2018, and contain a hotel on floors seven through twelve. In July 2013, Extell also completed the site's assemblage by paying $25 million for the 20 foot wide lot at 232 West 58th Street, adding another of development rights. In October, Extell purchased of air rights from Peter Fine's Atlantic Development Group using New York's inclusionary zoning program to support affordable housing. Atlantic Development Group had earned the air rights after building an affordable apartment building on 35th Street in Murray Hill, Manhattan in 2005. Cantilever controversy In order to maximize views of Central Park, whose southern border is located two blocks north, Extell paid $31.8 million for of air rights and the ability to build a cantilever roughly above the Art Students League of New York's building at 215 West 57th Street. The cantilever would extend from the eastern side of Extell's building and cover roughly one third of the space above the Art Students League building. Extell had already purchased of air rights from the League in 2005 for $23.1 million. Without the cantilever, Vornado Realty Trust's under construction 220 Central Park South would have blocked the first of the tower. In October 2013, Manhattan Community Board 5 voted against allowing the cantilever, although the vote was merely advisory and final power over the decision rested with the Landmarks Preservation Commission. Weeks later, the Landmarks Preservation Commission approved the air rights sale and cantilever in a 6-1 vote. At the same meeting, Extell revealed a revised design which would rise tall. In February 2014, the Art Students League also approved the deal in a 1,342-227 vote among all members despite opposition from several third parties including the Municipal Art Society. Afterwards, over 100 members of the Art Students League filed suit against Extell and the Art Students League organization itself to attempt to stop the air rights sale, but the lawsuit was dismissed in the summer of 2014. Nearly two years later, 300 members of the League filed another lawsuit, this time against the leadership of the League, claiming that instructions on how to vote on the sale were misleading and that the publicized voting procedure was not followed correctly. According to the lawsuit, materials distributed by the League's leadership indicated that abstaining from voting would count the same as a \\"no\\" vote which allegedly led many members not to vote on the issue. Thus, the vote's tally should have been 2,603‚Äì1,342 against the air rights sale, if the members not voting had been counted the same as a \\"no\\" vote. The second lawsuit was dismissed through summary judgment when a judge ruled that the League's leadership had acted in good faith while interpreting the League's by-laws regarding voting procedures. When the members appealed, the appeals court upheld the decision since construction had progressed to a point where it could not be undone without causing undue hardship that would cost Extell more than $200 million. =Early construction and financing difficulties= In the middle of 2013, the state-owned Export-Import Bank of China was reportedly in negotiations to provide a $1 billion construction loan for the project. The loan would have been the largest construction loan in New York City since the Financial crisis of 2007‚Äì2008 and also the Chinese bank's first loan in the United States. As part of the deal, fellow state-owned enterprise China State Construction Engineering would have acted as the co-general contractor on the project's construction alongside Australian Lendlease Group. By November, Extell had demolished all the previous buildings on the site and the company began excavating the building's deep foundations in May 2014. A new design for the tower was leaked in July 2014 that revealed a tower with a spire reaching , just a foot shy of One World Trade Center's pinnacle. After nearly a year of excavation, the building's concrete foundation was poured in February 2015. New renderings were revealed on April 20, 2015, showing a roof height of and an architectural height of with the spire. However, new permits filed several months later showed the building without a spire but increased the roof height to . At the same time, the building's official name of \\"Central Park Tower\\" was unveiled and the completion date was pushed back to 2019. The building's tower crane was installed in July 2015 and the structure reached street level by the end of September. The structural steel for Nordstrom's retail base was complete by the middle of 2016. Central Park Tower under construction in October 2015 In August 2016, Extell faced the maturation of the $285 million land loan from Blackstone. In June 2016, Extell announced they were seeking to raise $190 million in financing for the tower from foreign investors through the EB-5 visa program. The company had previously raised $400 million by selling the retail portion to Nordstrom and an additional $300 million by issuing bonds on the Tel Aviv Stock Exchange. Around the same time, Extell also brought in the Shanghai Municipal Investment Group as an additional equity investor for roughly $300 million. With the additional cash in hand, Extell repaid $50 million of the Blackstone loan and extended the maturity on the remaining $235 million another six months to December 2016. The additional capital didn't put an end to Extell's financing struggles as the building still required a roughly $1 billion construction loan. If the loan was not secured by May 2017, SMI could force Extell to repay its $300 million equity investment with interest. SMI was also entitled to an annual interest of 4.5% in monthly payments, as well as 30% of the development fees, and held final say over all major decisions. Additionally, the interest rate on Extell's bonds on the Tel Aviv Stock Exchange soared from 6% to over 16%, effectively turning them into junk bonds. Most pressingly, the refinanced Blackstone land loan was maturing in December 2016 and the interest rate would jump from 8% to 14% if Extell defaulted. By December 2016, Extell still did not have the cash to repay the land loan and secured only a one-week extension from Blackstone. On December 17, the day the land loan was due, Extell closed a new $235 million bridge loan with JPMorgan Chase and hedge funds Fortress Investment Group and Baupost Group in order to repay Blackstone. By March 2017, Extell disclosed that it had spent $939 million on the development of the tower since 2014 including over $300 million in 2016 alone. The tower's completion date was also pushed back another year to November 2020. At the same time, the company raised another $25 million from Nordstrom, bringing the company's total commitment to $426 million. However, Nordstrom included a put option on its investment which allowed the company to force Extell to repurchase the space if the store was not delivered by December 2018. A further $168 million came from EB-5 investors and Extell hoped to raise that number to a total of $340 million, $150 million above their original goal. At the end of May, Extell received approval to begin sales at the development. The company was targeting a total $4.02 billion sellout for the project's 179 condominiums, down from a $4.4 billion target two years earlier. However, the average unit price of $22.5 million was twice as much as the average sales price for a top New York City luxury apartment. Additionally, Extell hoped to sell 20 of the units for more than $60 million a piece, including a $95 million penthouse. An additional three duplex penthouses at the top of the tower were unpriced. In May 2017, SMI could have exercised their put option to require Extell to repay their $300 million equity investment with interest, but instead the company extended the deadline. The new terms required Extell to secure a construction loan by the end of 2017. In June 2017, Israeli bondholders became concerned that Extell would be unable to meet its bond obligations as it held only $120 million in cash and still had not closed a construction loan for Central Park Tower. The yield on the bonds jumped by 7% to 13%, below their 2016 peak of 16% but still well into junk bond territory. A month later, over 40 private and institutional bondholders met to discuss whether to force early repayment on the bonds. Extell was scheduled to repay $180 million in December 2018 but investors were worried that the company could not raise the cash due to unrealistic pricing at Central Park Tower given the state of the luxury market. Following the bondholder's meeting, Extell signed a term sheet for a $900 million construction loan with JPMorgan Chase in August 2017 after negotiating with lenders for over 18 months. Despite the term sheet, in August all of Extell's bonds' credit rating were downgraded by an Israeli bond rating agency after the company revealed it had just $36 million in cash on hand. In response, Extell revealed that they intended to close on the loan with JPMorgan before the end of the year. However, the company also admitted that while cash on hand was enough to cover construction costs in the \\"short term\\", they would not be able to sustain construction through 2018 without a loan. SMI also agreed to push back the deadline on their put option for a third time, from December 2017 to June 2018. =Final financing and construction= The first glass was installed on the building in September 2017 when the building was roughly a third of the way to its peak. At the end of 2017, Extell announced they closed on $900 million in construction financing from JPMorgan Chase and an additional $235 million preferred equity investment from a hedge fund. The preferred equity carried an interest rate of 11% while the senior loan carried the unusually high rate of Libor plus 4.5%. JPMorgan required repayment of the loan by December 2021 and also stipulated that Extell must sell $500 million worth of apartments in three years by December 2020 or face default. In March 2018, Extell announced they would be selling 17% of the equity in the tower to a group of investors for $107 million. The news sparked another downgrade of Extell's bonds, the second in less than a year. The same month, the tower's sales director left to rejoin Brown Harris Stevens after less than 6 months on the job. The tower reached the mark in the spring of 2018 and approximately by the end of the year. In October 2018, Extell officially launched sales at the project. By the end of 2018, Extell had spent $1.7 billion on construction of the tower and expected to spend another $1.3 billion before the building opened. This total project cost of $3 billion was over $1 billion higher than the $1.9 billion that Extell expected construction to cost in 2016. Extell also increased the projected sellout of the building's condominiums to $4.5 billion or $7,450 per square foot, up from projections of $4.02 billion in May 2017 and higher even than the $4.4 billion in sales Extell expected in 2016. The company also unveiled new buyer's incentives in early 2019, offering to waive three years of common charges and pay 50% of broker's commissions. Central Park Tower surpassed 432 Park Avenue in March 2019, reaching . Central Park Tower reached over by the end of July 2019, surpassing Willis Tower in Chicago. In a September 2019 interview with Bloomberg Television, Extell founder Gary Barnett admitted that, \\"[condos aren't] flying off the shelves like One57 did when we started six or seven years ago, when we were the only game in town. There's certainly much more competition.\\" He also signaled an openness to discounting units to increase sales in addition to the existing buyer's incentives. Barnett reaffirmed this sentiment in a December interview with The Real Deal, stating \\"we don't have the velocity we'd like to see, but we are signing deals. We are chipping away at the inventory.\\" Central Park Tower topped out on September 17, 2019, the same day as One Vanderbilt. By the end of the year, the building's glass curtain wall had been almost completely installed. However, further construction was temporarily halted in March 2020 due to the COVID-19 pandemic in New York City. = Incidents = On July 12, 2017, a crate containing window panes fell from the building's 16th floor after a ramp connecting the construction hoist to the building collapsed. The New York City Fire Department closed 58th Street for the rest of the day to investigate. On December 18, 2019, ice falling from Central Park Tower injured a pedestrian, who required hospitalization. Multiple blocks near the building were closed to traffic and pedestrians by the Department of Emergency Management, and the Department of Buildings stopped construction on the building indefinitely. The falling ice was considered problematic because ice sliding down a flat facade, such as that of Central Park Tower, could reach a maximum speed of from a height of as little as 15 stories.  Security guard death  At 10:25 am on May 26, 2018, a glass panel standing at the ground floor was accidentally hit with a forklift while a teamster attempted to move a piece of ducting and tipped over on top of a security guard. A construction worker at the scene had tried to rescue the security guard, and ended up fracturing his right foot. Emergency medical technicians were called at 10:31 and arrived at 10:36 to find a ‚Äúcompletely crushed patient\\" who was in cardiac arrest when they arrived. A group of between 15 and 20 men were able to lift the glass off him at which point the paramedics tried CPR and gave him an IV. The security guard, 67-year old Harry Ramnauth from the Bronx, was rushed to Mount Sinai Hospital where he was pronounced dead at 11:02. The autopsy listed the cause of death as blunt force trauma of the neck and torso. After the incident, the New York City Department of Buildings ordered a temporary halt to construction, though work soon resumed. Ramnauth's family also sued Extell, contractor Pinnacle Industries, and the developer's insurer AIG for the pain and suffering Ramnauth endured between the time the glass panel fell on him and when he lost consciousness six to eight minutes later. The family proposed a $4.75 million settlement, but Extell initially refused. In January 2020, Lendlease Group, contractor Pinnacle Industries, and Extell paid the guard's family $1.25 million to settle the family's wrongful death claim. Following an investigation by the federal Occupational Safety and Health Administration (OSHA), both general contractor Lendlease and subcontractor Permasteelisa North America were cited and fined $12,934 each. According to OSHA, the contractors failed to keep the construction site's aisles and passageways clear so that material handling equipment or employees could move freely, leading to the guard's death. Both contractors filed disputes with OSHA's findings and appealed the fines. Lendlease was also fined $25,000 by the New York City Office of Administration Trials and Hearings for failing to adequately safeguard the construction site which led to the guard's death. Lendlease later filed a lawsuit seeking to overturn the City's findings, arguing that the security guard did not qualify as a \\"member of the public\\" and that the City did not inspect the site until three days following the incident and therefore lacked direct knowledge of what occurred. Design The building is designed by Adrian Smith + Gordon Gill Architecture. The first seven floors of the tower are anchored by New York City's first Nordstrom department store. Floors eight to twelve will house amenity spaces for residents.

While many reviewers appreciated the attempt to stretch the jukebox musical format in new directions, going beyond the safe parameters of Baby Boomer hits, most found the story of racism, poverty, crime, violence, community and redemption mired in plot cliches and stock characters....It was apparent from the outset that not only was the show's marketing not working, but also that producers had made a mistake in bypassing the developmental opportunities of an out-of-town tryout and the fine-tuning window of a longer preview period.\\" References External links *Internet Broadway Database *Official Site Category:2014 musicals Category:Broadway musicals Category:Works about Tupac Shakur Category:Cultural depictions of Tupac Shakur Category:Rap operas ","title":"Holler If Ya Hear Me (musical)"},{"id":"43337329","text":"The LX and FX are ranges of purpose-designed tactical military trucks manufactured by what is now Rheinmetall MAN Military Vehicles (RMMV). They were replaced in production by the HX range. There was also an MX range, but this was only produced in very small numbers for the German Navy. Luxembourg Army LX range (6x6) truck in recovery configuration in Kosovo with KFOR  Development  Production of the LX range ran from 1988 until 2004. Production of the FX range ran from 1990 until around 2005. Both ranges were replaced by the HX range. LX, FX and HX ranges were available/remain available alongside the SX range of high mobility tactical trucks. LX and FX trucks were manufactured by MAN. HX trucks are manufactured by RMMV. In 2009 Germany‚Äôs MAN Nutzfahrzeuge AG (now MAN Truck & Bus) and Rheinmetall AG announced their respective intentions to form a joint wheeled military vehicles company, this becoming a reality in January 2010. RMMV is essentially the merger of Rheinmetall's wheeled military vehicle activities with the military truck business of MAN. The merger brings together MAN's automotive expertise in volume commercial vehicle manufacture with Rheinmetall's technological know- how in the military land sector/systems field.  LX range  LX range 6x6 truck demonstrating the speed advantage off-road of an individually sprung rear axle pair Introduced in 1988, the LX range was designed to be relatively light weight, C-130 Hercules transportable, and possess a good level of cross country mobility. LX range were based on MAN's then current M2000 medium weight commercial truck chassis, these modified and militarized as required. Two- and three-axle chassis were available, these having maximum carrying capacities including body/superstructure of 3.5- to 10-tonnes. On three axle chassis the rear axle pair are not sprung by the more conventional shared inverted leaf spring, but are sprung individually by leaf springs. According to the manufacturer this is a more complex option but it does improve off-road mobility. MAN's modular military cab was fitted to all LX models. To keep the overall height as low as possible, MAN's small block diesel engines were fitted. Engines were located in the standard place, but the cooling pack was situated behind the cab. The LX range was replaced in production from 2004 by the MAN TG-based HX range. The LX range was occasionally presented as LX 2000.  FX range  MAN's 40.633 FX range DFAETX tank transporter is in service with UAE Armed Forces. A similar vehicle (with a different trailer) is in service with Greece badged Steyr Introduced in 1990, the FX range complemented the lighter LX range and was designed for heavier gross vehicle and gross combination weights. The FX range were initially based on chassis from MAN's F90 heavy commercial range, production of which ran from 1986-1992. From 1992 onwards, FX range trucks were based on the F2000 heavy commercial range. All FX range trucks were fitted with MAN's modular military cab and most had a conventionally positioned engine. The cooling pack, and for certain applications (heavy tractor trucks for example) the engine, was located behind the cab. The MAN FX range of tactical trucks was replaced in production from 2005 by the MAN TG-based HX range. The FX range was occasionally presented as FX 2000. MX range The MX range is included for completeness. The MX range was based on F90 commercial chassis and was not produced in quantity, the only known production batch delivered to the German Navy in 4√ó2 cargo truck configuration during 1993-1994. The only two MX range trucks known to have been developed had the internal MAN codes of X53 and X56. German Navy trucks were X53, these based on the M05 F90 commercial chassis and fitted with leaf suspension all-round and a large purpose-designed steel front bumper/radiator guard. Motive power is provided by a 230 hp engine, and payload is 14,000 kg. The X56, of which a single prototype was built, featured air-suspension on the rear axle.

He played college basketball for Rutgers and Florida. On international duty, he represented Puerto Rico in the 2012 Olympic Qualifying Tournament and FIBA Under-19 World Championship, never medaling in either competitions.  High school career  Rosario attended St. Anthony High School and was coached by the legendary Bob Hurley. He spent four years with the Friars and helped maintain their position as a nationally recognized basketball powerhouse. In his senior season, St. Anthony came inches from a rare state tournament loss, a matter that was featured in the 2010 documentary, The Street Stops Here. He averaged nearly 19.0 points and 4.0 rebounds in this final year, and propelled the team to a 32‚Äì0 record along with the country's No. 1 ranking according to the USA Today Super 25 and ESPN High Elite 25 polls. The Friars eventually won the state championship upon Hurley's comments on the year, \\"If you don't win a state championship, you will never be remembered.\\" Following his years with St. Anthony, he took part in the 2008 McDonald's All-American Boys Game with several other future stars, including Tyreke Evans, Kemba Walker, and Al-Farouq Aminu. It made him only the sixth player from his high school to compete in the reputable game. At its conclusion, Rosario scored eighteen points and recorded five steals in 19 minutes on the court. On April 6, 2007, Rosario committed to play for the Rutgers Scarlet Knights men's basketball team in college, being coached by Fred Hill. Some of his other possible destinations included Georgetown, Penn State, Seton Hall, St. John's, and St. Joseph's. He was rated a four-star recruit by Rivals.com and 247Sports.com.  Collegiate career  = Freshman = During the summer prior to Rosario's matriculation with Rutgers University, future head coach Fred Hill made the comment, \\"This honor is further confirmation that Mike Rosario is one of the nation's premier players.‚Äù He also said, \\"Our mission at Rutgers is to build a National Championship-caliber program and Mike is the type of individual who helps further this process.\\" Rosario debuted for Rutgers on November 14, 2008 with 17 points, 4 rebounds, 2 steals, and 1 assist against Marist. His performance helped him be the first freshman Scarlet Knight to score 17 or more points in the team's season opener since Mike Jones in 1993. On November 21, 2008, Rosario recorded a season-high 27 points against the Robert Morris Colonials after being given 35 minutes of playing time. Despite his electric scoring display, he finished with just 1 rebound and 0 assists. He had his first 7-rebound game on November 26, 2008 against Lehigh. This would meet his season-high. Rosario would manage to do the same against Bryant on December 20, 2008. He played his first game as the starting small forward on December 3, 2008 against Rider, scoring 25 points total. On March 7, 2009, vs the South Florida Bulls, Rosario scored zero points for the first time in his college career on 0-of-5 shooting from the field. He played his sole postseason game in the Big East Tournament first round, against Notre Dame, finishing with 12 points, 4 rebounds, and 2 assists. At the end of the season, Rosario set the Rutgers freshman scoring record with 517 points. He led all Big East players with his amount of college experience scoring-wise as well. Rosario also ranked 5th in points among all freshman playing basketball in NCAA Division I. His forceful season brought his name to the conference's All-Rookie Team for the 2008‚Äì2009 season along with Yancy Gates, Kemba Walker, Greg Monroe, Samardo Samuels, and Devin Ebanks. Rutgers finished the year with an 11‚Äì21 record, 2-16 in their conference play. Apart from his Big East honors, Rosario was named Metropolitan Basketball Writers Association Rookie of the Year and a CollegeInsider.com Freshmen All-American. = Sophomore = After averaging over 16 points in his first season in college, Rosario made the decision to return to Rutgers for his sophomore year. He was listed as one of the possible factors in the rebuilding of the Big East Conference along with Greg Monroe, Yancy Gates, and many other members of the 2008-09 All-Rookie Team. Rosario made his first appearance as a sophomore on November 14, 2009 against Marist, recording 17 points, 4 rebounds, 4 assists, and 1 steal. He also saw 35 minutes of action. He finally broke the 20 point barrier against Vermont on November 22, 2009. This was his second Legends Classic appearance, the first one in which he scored 13 points against the Drexel Dragons at the Louis Brown Athletic Center (RAC). Due to his strong performance through the tournament, Rosario was named to the All-Tournament Team with Anthony Gurley, Erving Walker, Vernon Macklin, and Kalin Lucas. On December 22, 2009, he broke his personal scoring record against Saint Peter's with 28 points total. Rosario also added four rebounds and five assists, shooting 10-of-16 on field goals. He, again, scored a career-high 33 points against St. John's, recording 5 rebounds and steals as well. This performance helped him make his first appearance above the 30-point barrier with Rutgers. Rosario made his second postseason display on March 9, 2010 against Cincinnati, with 26 points, 3 rebounds, and 0 assists. The team, however, finished the season 15-17 and 5-13 in conference play. Seeing to the fact that the team was not winning at a reasonable rate, Rosario decided to transfer to Florida for his junior year. He said, \\"The biggest thing that Florida offered me was, 'We're going to win'‚Ä¶ that's something I've missed doing.\\" Nevertheless, Rosario became the second sophomore in Rutgers' history to join the 1,000 point club. Throughout the season, he was named to the Big East Conference Honor Roll on two occasions. = Junior = Rosario was forced to redshirt his third season with Florida because of NCAA transfer rules. He said, \\"Oh, man, I wanted to grab a uniform so bad sometimes.\\" However, since the preseason, Rosario endured a disc problem in his lower back that caused numbness in the area, but did not require surgery according to Billy Donovan. As Florida's 2010-11 season came to a close, Rosario, with Erving Walker, became one of just two players on the roster to enter their fourth year. He debuted with Florida on November 11, 2011, tallying for 19 points, 2 rebounds, 2 assists, and 2 steals against Jackson State. This would also become his season-high total due to his lack of influence on the strong basketball team. Rosario posted seven rebounds against Wright State on November 21, 2011, making for a season's high. Through the season, he did not start in a single game, generally coming off the bench for Bradley Beal, Erving Walker, and Kenny Boynton. In the SEC Men's Basketball Tournament, Rosario averaged just 1.0 points, 0.5 rebounds, and 6.0 minutes per game. He also most notably scored 12 points in his NCAA Tournament appearance against Norfolk State. = Senior = Rosario made his first display as a senior after being given a start against Alabama State on November 11, 2012, with 14 points, 2 rebounds, 2 assists, and 3 steals. Due to the departures of several players from the previous season's roster, including Bradley Beal, Rosario started in all of his games. On December 19, 2012 against Southeastern Louisiana, he posted 20 points, 6 rebounds, and 4 assists, his career-high on Florida. He, again, broke his personal record with his new team on February 16, 2013 against Auburn, with 22 points. On March 24, 2013 against Minnesota, he recorded a season-high 25 points. By the end of the season, Rosario garnered All-SEC Second Team honors and was named to the South Regional all-tournament team with Mitch McGary, Ben McLemore, and Nik Stauskas.  Professional career  On January 2013, Rosario was selected by Leones de Ponce, one of the most successful franchises in Baloncesto Superior Nacional. He was the third overall pick in the entire draft. Rosario made his professional debut with Leones de Ponce on May 17, 2013 against Mets de Guaynabo, with 11 points and 4 rebounds as the starting shooting guard. He played off the bench in the majority of his rookie season in Puerto Rico, but posted a career-high 19 points vs Vaqueros de Bayam√≥n on June 13, 2013.

Prior to the 2014 BSN season, Rosario took part in three games of the FIBA Americas League. Through the competition, he averaged 11.7 points, 3.7 rebounds, and 1.7 assists.

Having been on 106 & Park's Freestyle Friday for seven weeks undefeated, earning a place in the program's Hall of Fame by 2006.Freestyle Friday#List of Hall of Famers .28in order of year.29 In 2007, he put up a strong performance in the Houston division of Jumpoff's World Rap Championships, earning an MVP nomination with an 8-2 record. Hollow's career took off with the birth of the new-gen battle rap leagues where MCs could blend their freestyle raps with written rhymes. Making his debut at NYC's Fight Klub in 2008, Hollow displayed freestyle ability, rhyme schemes & punchlines that overwhelmed most of the competition, winning ten straight battles before finally falling to New Jersey's Arsonal in a controversial matchup. At the same time, Hollow was tearing through the newly formed East Coast division of Grind Time and making trips out to the Fresh Coast and St. Louis to clash with their veterans. A student of the game, Hollow claimed that his knowledge of battle rap and its fans allowed him to succeed in any environment. Hollow debuted on SMACK/URL against Chicago's Big T in 2010. Since 2013, he has been consistently rated one of the best battle rappers by battle rap fan communities. More recently, Hollow da Don participated on SMACK/URL's 'Nome 3' vs Tsu Surf then he had a judged battle on Eminem's Total Slaughter battle rap league against Grammy Award-nominated rapper Joe Budden, whom he defeated by unanimous decision. He competed against Loaded Lux in a highly anticipated and controversial UW Battle League event on January 26, 2014. Hollow da Don faced Charlie Clips on May 9, 2015 and most spectators and battle rap bloggers have hollow winning. Hollow da Don faced Pat Stay, the previous KOTD champion, on Dec. 6th, 2015 in London. Fans were led to believe was going to be a traditional three round battle, only to discover at the last minute that it would be a one-round battle instead. Although battle rap is highly subjective, many sources agree that Hollow's round against Pat Stay was one of his best, and that he won the match. A rematch between Hollow Da Don and Pat Stay took place in May on KOTD's Massacre event. Hollow also had a surprise one-round battle against Dizaster at KoTD's Massacre 3 event. This was a very controversial battle, as it sparked a rivalry between once good friends Hollow Da Don and Math Hoffa. Hollow and Diz reportedly have a full three-round battle slated. Hollow recently went against Tay Roc for Summer Madness 6. Many Sources believed Hollow won that close match. Recently, Hollow has been on a path of grudge matches. First, Hollow had his rematch with Arsonal a decade later after their original at the URL event \\"Smack Volume 2\\" on March 31, 2018. In November, Hollow returned to URL at their \\"Summer Madness 8\\" event to battle John John Da Don, fellow battle rapper and founder of Atlanta's Bullpen Battle League. The two had a physical exchange during the face off at the UDUBB event where he battled Loaded Lux. The battle is considered highly debatable with many pointing at John John Da Don as edging the win over Hollow. In 2018, Hollow founded \\"Hidden Label Clothing\\" with hip hop producer Mike Zombie On Feb 16, 2019, Hollow debuted in Rare Breed Entertainment, and battled his old colleague Math Hoffa in a highly anticipated and heated battle with Math Hoffa, whom many were expecting to lose pulled the battle to his table. A very controversial battle. Later that summer, Hollow was slated to perform in a 2 on 2 match with former opponent turned friend, Loaded Lux as the group Loaded Hollowz after the 2 appeared in a 2 on 2 match in the battle rap film Bodied. Their opponents were supposed to be the team Guntitles, composed of Tay Roc and Tsu Surf, 2 opponents Hollow faced in the past. However, weeks before the battle, Tsu Surf was arrested leaving the young battle rapper Chess to replace him, forming the group Gunz N Cake. The battle took place August 9th, with many battle rap fans and critics having Loaded Hollowz winning after a critically acclaimed performance from both Hollow Da Don and Loaded Lux.

It was almost impossible for any senior Irish Crown official of the era to avoid being drawn into the feud: everyone was forced to take sides. Dyke was a Butler partisan, and is said to have particularly offended Archbishop Talbot: among a long list of charges made against Talbot in 1442 was one that he had assaulted Dyke. Since Talbot, despite his clerical office, was notoriously hot-tempered, the charge may well be true.Graves, James ed.

Background and education At the age of eleven Diehl moved with his family from Pittsburgh to Pleasant Hill, California In 1968 he started taking courses in the art department at Diablo Valley College and then studied under Mel Ramos, one of the originators of figurative Pop Art at Cal State University, Hayward, earning a BA in 1973. Diehl says that Ramos taught him \\"discipline and professionalism\\" and, crucially, to incorporate the camera as a tool in his painting practice. Ramos also encouraged Diehl to attend San Francisco State University for graduate work. Respected first generation photorealist painters Robert Bechtle and Richard McLean, along with photographer and painter John Gutmann, served as mentor figures for Diehl at San Francisco State as he earned a master's degree. After graduating with honors in 1976, he immediately took a position as an instructor at Diablo Valley College, teaching painting, drawing, and watercolor. Methods and collaborations Diehl continued painting in a style heavily influenced by his photorealist mentors for several years: a 1980 review in Artweek notes a reverence for Wayne Thiebaud in both the title of Diehl's 1980 watercolor Thiebaud Towel and the execution of his acrylic painting Green Deck Chair from the same year. However, the artist's approach changed after he had a self-described \\"epiphany\\" at a 1982 show of still lifes by Gordon Cook at Charles Campbell Gallery in San Francisco. Cook's work then led Diehl toward a greater appreciation of the intimate scale of the work of Italian still life painter Giorgio Morandi. These two artists have inspired Diehl's work for more than twenty-five years; Cook and Morandi, writes Landauer, \\"continue to serve as Diehl's guideposts.\\" The subject matter of his paintings has remained largely consistent since the early 1980s: San Jose Museum of Art curator Susan Landauer wrote in 2007 that \\"for the past fifteen years, (Diehl's) repertoire has consisted mainly of hardcover books, typically on art or other subjects... often accompanied by some related iconic element.\\" Los Angeles Times art critic Leah Ollman writes that Diehl \\"practices painting as an act of homage,\\" citing \\"visual quotes\\" and references to artists including Morandi, Rothko, Zurbaran, Ingres, Goya, Modigliani, Demuth and Joan Brown in a 2004 review of Diehl's paintings at Schlesinger Gallery. Diehl's work also incorporates references to artists in other disciplines, including musicians such as Dave Brubeck, Thelonious Monk and Billie Holiday. When painting, Diehl works almost exclusively in acrylic on canvas or watercolor on paper. His still life compositions are painted from source photographs taken by the artist in his studio. His work has generally taken a serial form, with paintings or prints issued in a series connected by some common theme, from his 1970s images of figures in swimming pools to his more recent series of book paintings. In 2012, on the occasion of the seventy- fifth anniversary of the Golden Gate Bridge, Diehl and designer Michael Rylander published GGB75, a series of photographs by Diehl of the bridge as seen from across the Bay in Tiburon, California. Since 1988, Diehl has collaborated with Donald Farnsworth at Magnolia Editions in Oakland, California on a variety of print projects including lithographs, etchings, woodcuts, pigmented inkjet prints and mixed-media editions. Magnolia Editions has also published a series of editioned Jacquard tapestries by Diehl. Exhibitions, collections and public art Diehl is currently represented by Dolby Chadwick Gallery in San Francisco; he was previously represented by Hackett-Freedman Gallery in San Francisco. Recent solo shows include A Dialogue with Tradition at Dolby Chadwick Gallery in 2013; Guy Diehl: Still Life Painting at Dolby Chadwick Gallery in 2011; and a 2007 exhibition at the Sonoma Valley Museum of Art in Sonoma, California. He has also had solo exhibitions at San Francisco venues including Modernism (in 1993, 1994, and 1997); Jeremy Stone Gallery (1986, 1988, and 1990); and Hank Baum Gallery (1979, 1980, 1982, and 1984), as well as exhibiting in Stockton, Redding, Pittsburgh, and Concord, California, and at the Shepard Art Gallery in Reno, Nevada.

TSG Entertainment) is an American film financing entity which primarily funds live action films. TSG stands for parent company The Seelig Group. TSG was established after the U.S. theatrical release of Parental Guidance to replace Dune Entertainment as a result of Dune not renewing their deal with 20th Century Fox. Fox was looking for a new long term co-financing arrangement and made a deal with TSG Entertainment. The financing entity was founded by former Dune partner Chip Seelig with majority funding from Magnetar Capital with additional funding from Seelig and others. Seelig had left Dune in May 2011 to launch a new funding company. TSG was also looking for some ($300‚Äì400 million) debt financing from banks at this time. In November 2015, Bona Film Group, a Chinese film studio, invested $235 million in TSG. Because of The Walt Disney Company‚Äôs acquisition of 21st Century Fox (sans certain units) on March 20, 2019, Disney inherited Fox‚Äôs deal with TSG for 20th Century Fox.

In 1887 he was named aide de camp of King Umberto I, then from 1893 to 1897 military attache to the Italian embassy in Wien, then he was appointed commander of the Siena brigade and then of two different divisions of the Italian army. He wrote an essay on Napoleon and his Waterloo campaign, and one on the Battle of Custoza (1866), which drew praise even from abroad. = Chief of Staff = In 1908, when the Chief of Staff of the Italian Army Tancredi Saletta retired, the position was offered to General Luigi Cadorna; however, he requested that his supreme authority be affirmed in peacetime as well as in wartime, and the leeway to appoint and release high officers at his discretion. This conditions proved unacceptable to the government and the First Adjutant of the King Roberto Brusati, and Pollio was named in his stead.Ibidem During his tenure he oversaw the Italian expedition in Libya; considered a supporter of the Triple Alliance, he was held in high esteem by his German and Austro-Hungarian counterparts, Helmut Von Moltke and Conrad von H√∂tzendorf. Despite this, he also ordered new plans for mobilisation to be drawn in case of war against Austria-Hungary. He died on 1 July 1914, just as World War I was about to begin; the circumstances of his death have led some authors to claim that the apparently austrophile general was actually murdered, to make way for Cadorna, who succeeded him as Chief of Staff. = Personal life = Pollio was married with Eleonora Gormasz, an Austrian noblewoman.

It was formerly endemic to the Ashmore and Cartier Islands of Australia, having thought to have become extinct there. In 2015, the snake was discovered in seagrass beds of Shark Bay off Western Australia.  Taxonomy  The species was first described in 1926. The combination Smithohydrophis foliosquama (Kharin 1981) is recognised as a synonym.  Description  The recorded length is around 800 millimetres and coloration is purple brown. A poorly known species, the diet is known to consist of wrasse and gudgeon fish that are pursued through coral outcrops and crevices. Distribution and habitat  The distribution range of the species has contracted since its first identification, and is currently known from a declining population inhabiting Shark Bay on the western coast of Australia. The leaf-scaled sea snake prefers waters up to 10 metres in depth. In December 2015 a population of the snakes was found living in seagrass beds of Shark Bay off Western Australia. Previously, its only known habitats were some 1,700 km away in the Ashmore and Hibernia Reefs in the Timor Sea, from where it had since disappeared.

It operated from 1946 to 1962. The Meadowlark was the C&EI;'s last train to Southern Illinois.  History  The Meadowlark was one of two new streamliners introduced by the C&EI; in late 1946, the other being the short- lived Whippoorwill which served Evansville, Indiana. The C&EI; billed the train as a \\"Chicago-liner\\" and promised \\"quieter, smoother, roomier lounge-car luxury.\\" The new streamliner made the journey from Chicago to Cypress, Illinois in seven hours. The train departed Cypress at 5:15 AM, arriving at Chicago's Dearborn Station at 12:25 PM. Five hours later the train began the journey back to Cypress, arriving after midnight. Writing in 2006, railroad historian Joe Welsh called the Meadowlark \\"inviting\\" while noting that the destination of Cypress was \\"obscure.\\" On the train's first anniversary the C&EI; claimed total ridership of 150,000 passengers and that the train had \\"girdled the globe 10 times in her daily travels.\\" In the early 1950s the Meadowlark continued south to Joppa, on the Ohio River, but by the middle of the decade it was cut back to West Vienna, Illinois, north of Cypress. The C&EI; discontinued the Meadowlark altogether on January 5, 1962, ending the railroad's service to Southern Illinois.  Equipment  Pullman-Standard delivered four cars for the original Meadowlark: a baggage/mail/grill car (the Sparhawk Inn) and three 60-seat coaches. In 1956 the C&EI; replaced the streamlined equipment with a Budd Rail Diesel Car (RDC). In a 1957 company publication C&EI; touted the \\"comfort and speed\\" of the RDC and touted its suitability for operation in \\"sparsely settled areas.\\" While the language echoed earlier advertisements, the downgrade was obvious.

The first bomb hit the port side and penetrated the superstructure deck, causing extensive damage to the casemates below. Secondary explosions of the ammunition stored in the casemates caused serious fires there and in the galley deck below them. The second bomb struck the rear superfiring turret roof; it penetrated but failed to explode. She sunk on her keel in shallow water at Pearl Harbor. West Virginia was raised and sent to Puget Sound for major reconstruction. She rejoined the Pacific fleet on 23 September 1944.

During Second Naval Battle of Guadalcanal, the ship lost power right as combat was initiated with a Japanese surface task force. South Dakota was illuminated by burning ships and fired upon by the Japanese task force, including battleship Kirishima. It is estimated she was hit by one 14\\", one 5\\", six 6\\", and eighteen 8\\" caliber shells. Most of the enemy shells were aimed at the ship's superstructure, thus not threatening the ship's survival. 40 men were killed and 180 wounded from this action. The ship returned to the states for repairs shortly afterward. During the Battle of the Philippine Sea, a D4Y dive bomber hit South Dakota with a 500 lb bomb, disabling a 40 mm mount, killing 24 and wounding another 77 men.

The starboard wing of the plane was thrown far forward, starting a gasoline fire at five-inch Gun Mount No. 3. The battleship suffered only superficial damage, and the fire was brought quickly under control. The remains of the pilot were recovered on board the ship just aft of one of the 40 mm gun tubs. The dent made by the Zero in the Missouris side remains to this day. Missouri was the only Iowa-class ship that was damaged in the war. Today Missouri is a museum ship in Pearl Harbor, watching over the sunken USS Arizona. Aircraft carriers (CV) was hit by two armor-piercing bombs and two torpedoes on 8 May 1942 during the Battle of Coral Sea.

Wasp was struck by three torpedoes fired from Japanese submarine I-19 which hit the vicinity of the ship's gasoline and magazines. Wasp was rocked by several catastrophic explosions over the next few minutes and it quickly became apparent that her condition was beyond saving. The order to abandon ship was given ten minutes after the torpedoes hit. Wasp sank with the loss of 193 dead and 366 wounded. was hit by multiple bombs, torpedoes, and damaged aircraft during the Battle of Santa Cruz on 26 October 1942 after repeated strikes by Japanese carrier aircraft. Although an effort was made to tow the ship to safety, further air attacks prompted her abandonment and scuttling. 140 sailors from Hornet died as a result of her sinking. was hit by a low-flying kamikaze along the port edge of her flight deck on 25 November 1944. The kamikaze crashed among planes waiting for takeoff, causing extensive damage, killing 15 men and wounding 44. The ship resumed flight operations a few hours later. She was scrapped in 1975 after a prestigious career. was struck by a torpedo bomber during Operation Hailstone which killed 11 men. During raids on Luzon on 25 November 1944, Intrepid was hit by two kamikaze aircraft which left 66 men dead, sending the ship home for repairs. On 16 April 1945, a kamikaze aircraft dove through the flight deck, killing eight and wounding 21, but the ship was landing planes again within three hours. Today she is a museum ship in New York City. was damaged by aircraft bombs on 19 March 1945, 50 miles south of Shikoku, Japan during the Battle of Okinawa. She survived over 40 huge explosions of her own munitions but was able to make it back to the states under her own power, despite suffering 798 killed and 487 wounded. Although repaired, the ship did not return to active service and was scrapped in 1969. was hit by two kamikazes on 21 January 1945. The first crashed through her flight deck and its bomb went off just above the hanger deck, setting afire several aircraft. Minutes later the second kamikaze struck the island superstructure, causing extensive damage and wounding or killing many high-ranking officers. The carrier suffered 143 killed and 202 wounded. She was scrapped in 1975 after a prestigious career. was hit by a Japanese twin-engine \\"Frances\\" type flying level on the starboard side. The plane impacted the edge of the flight deck 15 ft from the stern. The bomb load penetrated the hull and below the flight deck before exploding violently, killing 27 men. Pieces of the Japanese plane as well as the three bodies of its crew were scattered across the flight deck. Randolph was scrapped in 1975 after a prestigious career. was struck by a torpedo bomber off Kwajalein on 4 December 1943, killing nine men. She was back in action by early March after repairs. On 5 November 1944, a kamikaze aircraft struck the ship's island, causing extensive damage and killing 50 men. Today she is a museum ship in Corpus Christi, Texas. was severely damaged by two kamikaze planes striking the carrier within 30 seconds on 11 May 1945 off Okinawa, killing 390 men and wounding 264. The ship was knocked out of the war and although repaired, she did not see active service after World War II. She was scrapped in 1973. , on 19 March 1945, was hit with a 500 lb armor- piercing bomb which penetrated both the flight and hangar decks, then exploded in the crew's galley. Many of her shipmates were having breakfast after being at general quarters all night. 102 crewmen were lost. Despite the losses, Wasp continued operations with 27 minutes of the strike. She was scrapped in 1973 after a prestigious career. : On 25 November 1944, a fire exploded an incoming kamikaze some 300 ft (90 m) above the ship, but a section of its fuselage landed amidships and burst into flames. On January 21, a plane returning from a sortie made a normal landing, taxied forward abreast of the ship's island and disintegrated in a blinding explosion that killed 50 men and wounded 75. On 7 April 1945, a kamikaze cartwheeled across the flight deck and crashed into a group of planes, while its bomb hit the port catapult causing a tremendous explosion, killing 62 and wounding 71. The ship was scrapped in 1977 after a prestigious career. Aircraft carrier, light (CVL) was attacked on 20 November 1943 by a group of aircraft low on the water. Six were shot down, but the aircraft launched at least five torpedoes, one of which hit the carrier's starboard quarter. Seriously damaged with 17 dead and 23 wounded, the ship steamed to Funafuti on 23 November for emergency repairs. Independence returned to San Francisco on 2 January 1944 for more permanent repairs. She survived the war and atomic bomb tests at Operation Crossroads to be scuttled off California in 1951. was off the Philippines when on 24 October 1944, shortly before 10:00 am, she was attacked by a lone D4Y 'Judy' dive bomber which dropped a single bomb, striking the carrier between the elevators, and punching through the hangar before detonating. Although structural damage was minor, a fire broke out and quickly spread due to burning gasoline, thus causing further explosions. USS Birmingham and USS Irwin approached and attempted to fight the fire and rescue crew members. A few hours later, a second, larger explosion shook the Princeton, possibly caused by an explosion of one or more bombs in the magazine. Birmingham suffered extensive damage to her superstructure and numerous casualties. Irwin was also damaged, but stayed close to rescue survivors. By 16:00, the fires were out of control and the remaining personnel were evacuated. At 17:49, after being torpedoed by USS Reno, an enormous explosion destroyed the entire forward section and sent flames and debris up to 2,000 feet into the air. Princeton sank at approximately 17:50 with a loss of 108 men; however, 233 men were killed and 426 wounded on the USS Birmingham. : On 30 October 1944 off the Philippines, gunners on Belleau Wood shot down a kamikaze over the ship which fell on her flight deck aft, causing several fires and igniting ammunition in planes on deck awaiting take off. 92 men were killed during this attack. She survived the war to serve for a short time in the French Navy, then was sold for scrap in 1960. : On 25 November 1944, Cabot had fought off several kamikaze when one, already flaming from hits, crashed into the flight deck on the port side, destroying the still-firing 20 mm gun platform, disabling the 40 mm mounts and a gun director. Another kamikaze crashed close aboard and showered the port side with shrapnel and burning debris. 62 men were killed or wounded, but she continued to maintain her station in formation and operate effectively. Temporary repairs were made. She served in the Spanish Navy after World War II for 22 years and was finally scrapped in 2002 after preservation attempts failed. Aircraft carrier, escort (CVE) was torpedoed off the Canary Islands at 20:13 on 29 May 1944. U-549 had slipped undetected through her screen. The submarine put three torpedoes into the carrier before being sunk herself by depth charges. The carrier lost six men in the attack; the remaining 951 were picked up by the escort screen. This was the only American carrier sunk in the Atlantic during the war. USS Sangamon (CVE- 26) was rearming at Kerama Retto during the battle of Okinawa on 4 May 1945, when at 19:55 a Ki-45 kamikaze crashed into the center of her deck; its bomb penetrated the flight deck and exploded in the hanger. Initial damage was extensive, fires broke out on the flight deck, the hangar deck, and in the fuel deck, communications from the bridge were lost within 15 minutes, and the ship was soon out of control. By 20:15, however, steering control had been established, and the ship was brought back to a course that helped the crew fight the myriad fires scattered over the CVE. By 22:30, all fires were under control. The attack killed 46 and wounded 116. was operating off Samar when at 07:40 on 25 October 1944, her task force \\"Taffy 1\\" was jumped by land-based planes from Davao in the first deliberate suicide attack of the war. After shooting down several kamikazes Suwanee was hit by an enemy plane at 08:04 about 40 feet forward of the after elevator. The plane's bomb compounded the fracture when it exploded between the flight and hangar decks, tearing a 25-foot gash in the latter and causing a number of casualties. Within two hours, her flight deck was sufficiently repaired to enable the escort carrier to resume air operations. Just after noon on 26 October, another group of kamikazes jumped \\"Taffy 1\\". A Zero crashed into Suwanees flight deck at 1240 and careened into a torpedo bomber which had just been recovered. The two planes erupted upon contact as did nine other planes on her flight deck. The resulting fire burned for several hours, but was finally brought under control. The casualties for 25‚Äì26 October were 107 dead and 160 wounded. USS Santee (CVE- 29) was sailing as part of \\"Taffy 1\\" off the northern coast of Mindanao on 25 October 1944 when at 07:40, a kamikaze managed to sneak over the formation and dove into the center of Santee, crashing through the flight deck and starting fires in the hanger deck. These fires were quickly brought under control and by 07:51 the ship was fully operational. 16 men were killed and 27 wounded. Minutes later at 07:56, a torpedo fired from Japanese submarine I-56 struck the ship, causing flooding of several compartments and creating a 6¬∞ list to starboard. Emergency repairs were completed by 09:35 and the carrier had kept station with the other ships in the group. was operating off the Gilbert Islands, 24 November 1943 when she was torpedoed by Japanese submarine I-175 around 05:10. The torpedo struck behind the after engine room, and detonated the ship's bomb magazine, causing a devastating explosion that engulfed the ship and sent shrapnel flying as far as 5,000 yards (4,600 m) away. The entire task force was rocked by the explosion, but no other ships were significantly damaged. A mushroom cloud erupted, rising thousands of feet above the wreck of Liscome Bay. The detonation sheared off nearly the entire rear end of the carrier, killing everyone behind the forward bulkhead of the aft engine room. Both the hangar and flight decks were heavily damaged. The forward part of the hangar was immediately engulfed in flames, igniting the few remaining planes on the flight deck. Planes fell off the carrier's deck. Steam, compressed air, and fire-main pressure were lost throughout the ship. Fires on the flight deck caused ammunition within the burning aircraft and anti-aircraft guns to detonate, further complicating matters. The gasoline- coated water surrounding Liscome Bay caught fire, hampering survivors' efforts to escape. At 05:33, only 23 minutes after the explosion, Liscome Bay listed to starboard and sank; 53 officers and 591 enlisted men were killed, while 272 survived. was operating off the Philippines when on 5 January 1945 she was attacked by kamikazes. Two A6M Zeros headed for Manila Bay, evading anti- aircraft fire and strafing as they approached. The first plane hit at the base of the island superstructure, its bomb penetrating the deck and exploding in the hangar. The second plane hit the sea just a few yards from the carrier. Fires were quickly extinguished and within 24 hours the ship was back in action. 22 men were killed and 56 wounded by this attack. was operating off Okinawa when at 06:35, on 7 June 1945, after having maneuvered through typhoon weather, Natoma Bay was closed by an A6M Zero, broad on the port quarter and low on the water. Changing course, it came in over the stern, fired incendiary ammunition at the bridge, and on reaching the island structure, nosed over and crashed the flight deck. The engine, propeller and a bomb tore a hole in the flight deck, 12 by 20 feet, while the explosion of the bomb damaged the deck of the forecastle and the anchor windlass beyond repair and ignited a nearby fighter. Four of Natoma Bays crew were wounded while one officer was killed. A second Zero was splashed by the ship's port batteries. The damage control party immediately extinguished the blaze and set about emergency repairs. The next strike was cancelled, but the following one, against Miayako Shima, took place as scheduled at 10:30. was operating 60 miles east of Samar on the morning of 25 October 1944 as a part of \\"Taffy 3\\" when a huge Japanese task force of four battleships, seven heavy cruisers, two light cruisers, and 19 destroyers appeared on the horizon. Leading the Japanese force was the super- battleship Yamato, the largest battleship of all time, which weighed more than all the ships of \\"Taffy 3\\" combined. \\"Taffy 3\\" was pitifully weak in comparison, boasting only six escort carriers, four destroyers, and four destroyer escorts. Nevertheless, the Americans accepted battle and many of the escorting destroyers would valiantly sacrifice themselves to prevent the Japanese from sailing into Leyte Gulf where the bulk of transports for the Philippines invasion was. Throughout the battle, St. Lo would avoid damage from Japanese shells. After several hours of pursuit, the confused Japanese task force reversed course and retired from battle, much to the bewilderment of the Americans. Just 90 minutes after the engagement ended with Japanese surface forces, \\"Taffy 3\\" was attacked by the first organized kamikaze attack of WWII. At 10:51, a A6M Zero kamikaze dove on White Plains but was hit by AA fire and turned towards St. Lo. The plane came homing in on the carrier from a low angle directly astern and crashed into the flight deck aft, its burning wreckage skidding across the flight deck while its 500lb bomb penetrated the flight deck to explode among rearming and refueling aircraft. A gasoline fire erupted, followed by six secondary explosions, including detonations of the ship's torpedo and bomb magazine. St. Lo was engulfed in flames and sank 30 minutes later. Of the 889 men aboard, 113 were killed or missing and approximately 30 others died of their wounds. St. Lo became the first major warship to sink as the result of a kamikaze attack. was sailing as a part of \\"Taffy 3\\" about 60 miles east of Samar on 25 October 1944 when a powerful Japanese task force surprised the outnumbered and outgunned Americans. The enemy formation included the Yamato, the heaviest battleship ever built, armed with 18.1 inch naval rifles. Yamato opened fire at 06:59 at an estimated range of 34,544 yards, targeting White Plains with her first four salvos. Yamato's third salvo was a close straddle landing at 07:04. One shell from this salvo exploded beneath the turn of White Plains port bilge near frame 142, near her aft (starboard) engine room. While the ship was not struck directly, the mining effect of the under-keel explosion severely damaged her hull, deranged her starboard machinery and tripped all of the circuit breakers in her electrical network. Prompt and effective damage control restored power and communications within three minutes and she was able to remain in formation by overspeeding her port engine to compensate. Fortunately, the black smoke resulting from the sudden loss of boiler intake air pressure had convinced the crews of Yamato and Nagato they had scored a hit and subsequently shifted their fire. White Plains five-inch gun crew claimed six hits on heavy cruiser Ch≈çkai. For the next two and a half hours, the Japanese force chased \\"Taffy 3\\" southward and subjected the escort carriers and their counterattacking screen to a heavy-caliber cannonade before miraculously giving up the pursuit and retiring from the Battle off Samar. The retreat by Kurita's surface force, however, did not end the ordeal for White Plains and her fellow warships. After a 90-minute respite, they suffered harassment from a different quarter. At 10:50 hours, a formation of nine Japanese Navy Zero kamikaze planes attacked in the first organized suicide attack of the war. Two of them singled out White Plains as their victim. Her antiaircraft gunners responded, hitting one of the intruders, which immediately changed course and crashed into USS St. Lo, which eventually sank. The other aircraft continued on toward White Plains, but her antiaircraft guns finally brought it down yards astern, scattering debris all over the ship's deck and sides, but causing only 11 relatively minor casualties. After the battle, White Plains was repaired and returned to service to ferry fighters to Okinawa. After the war she participated in Operation Magic Carpet. was steaming about 60 miles east of Samar before dawn 25 October 1944 as a part of \\"Taffy 3\\" when a huge Japanese surface task force of battleships and cruisers came across the much weaker American force of escort carriers and destroyers. As the trailing ship in the escort caravan, Kalinin Bay came under intense enemy shell fire. Though partially protected by chemical smoke, a timely rain squall, and valiant counterattacks of screening destroyers and destroyer escorts, she took the first of 15 direct hits at 07:50. Fired from an enemy battleship, the large- caliber shell (14-inch or 16-inch) struck the starboard side of the hangar deck just abaft the forward elevator. By 08:00, the enemy cruisers, which were steaming off her port quarter, closed to within 18,000 yards. Kalinin Bay responded to their straddling salvos with fire from her five-inch gun, which only intensified the enemy fire. Three eight-inch, shells struck her within minutes of each other. At 08:30, five enemy destroyers steamed over the horizon off her starboard quarter. The closing ships opened fire from about 14,500 yards, and, as screening ships engaged the cruisers and laid down concealing smoke, Kalinin Bay shifted her fire, trading shots with Japan's Destroyer Squadron 10. Many salvos exploded close aboard or passed directly overhead; and, though no destroyer fire hit Kalinin Bay directly, she took ten more eight-inch hits from the now obscured cruisers. One shell passed through the flight deck and into the communications area, where it destroyed all the radar and radio equipment. At 09:30, the enemy fleet suddenly broke off action and turned northward. Just 90 minutes after the Japanese fleet turned away, \\"Taffy 3\\" came under attack from kamikaze planes. Four diving A6M Zeros attacked Kalinin Bay from astern and the starboard quarter. Intense fire splashed two close aboard, but a third plane crashed into the port side of the flight deck. The fourth hit destroyed the aft port stack. Kalinin Bay suffered extensive structural damage during the morning's furious action, and counted five dead among her sixty casualties. Following her repairs, the ship served as a replenishment carrier and eventually in \\"Magic Carpet\\". was supporting the invasion of Saipan when on 17 June 1944 when at 18:52, a Japanese bomber made a run for Fanshaw Bay, dropping a 250 lb bomb as it flew 1,500 ft above the carrier. The bomb penetrated into her aft aircraft elevator, and detonating within the hangar bay, some 5 ft below the flight deck. Shrapnel was launched through the hangar, instantly killing eleven men who had taken up position forward of the elevator. The blast had enough force to rupture a fire main, sever electrical cables, and even eject depth charges from the bomb bays of the Avengers stored within the hangar deck. In addition, several fires were kindled, total steering control was lost, and the ship acquired a 3¬∞ list to the port. Although the fires were quickly put under control by the crew, several of her aircraft were compelled to land on other carriers as a result of the blazes. The ship suffered 14 dead and 23 wounded from the attack. Fanshaw Bay retired from operations and proceeded to Pearl Harbor for a long period of repairs. She returned to duty in September. On 25 October 1944 while sailing as a component of \\"Taffy 3\\" off Samar, Fanshaw Bays task force came into direct contact with a much more powerful Japanese task force of several battleships and cruisers. Fanshaw Bay launched as many planes as possible to harry the Japanese ships while fleeing to the safe concealment of rain squalls. At 7:50, four eight-inch shells made impact with her hull, with another two missing just in front of her bow. One shell penetrated through a ventilator, killing two men as it tore into the carrier. Another shell passed under one of her Bofors guns, tearing the face off of one of her crew. Deflected by the gun's shield, the shell ricocheted over her flight deck. Another shell destroyed her catapult track, and resulted in a small explosion within her flag office. Four small fires were kindled by these shells, but they were quickly put under control, along with a minor issue with flooding. Although four men were killed in the attack, her operational capability was not significantly compromised. Rather, Fanshaw Bays own single five-inch gun responded by firing against one of the leading Japanese cruisers, landing at least five hits against its superstructure. Despite the addition of smoke screens, and the heroic defense of her escorts, by 08:55, the Japanese had already closed the distance to only 6.25 miles. During the intervening period, the Japanese shells had sparked a series of fires, which the damage control parties struggled to contain, and the situation seemed to be deteriorating. She was also forced to dodge torpedo attacks launched by the Japanese destroyer screen. Fortunately for the crew of Fanshaw Bay, the Japanese turned and retired from battle, having lost several ships themselves. During the action Fanshaw Bay suffered four killed and four wounded, but the damage was not threatening to the hull of the ship. She would finish the war, later participating in \\"Magic Carpet\\". had been dodging shells from Japanese cruisers off Samar on the morning of 25 October 1944 when her task force \\"Taffy 3\\" was hit by suicide planes. One A6M Zero rolled into a dive, crashed into the port catwalk and fell into the sea. The kamikaze punctured more than 100 holes in the bulkheads, doors, and gasoline lines. One man was killed and four were wounded. Damage was minimal and the ship stayed in action. On 7 January 1945, the ship was targeted by a Ki-43 \\"Oscar\\" kamikaze at 18:57. The enemy plane crashed through the port side at the waterline amidships tearing a hole in the ship's side approximately 20 feet long and nine feet high. An explosion and large fire flared up simultaneously with a hit by a five-inch round from one of the other ships, which burst close to the carrier's bow below a gun sponson, killing and wounding several men. The attack killed 16 men and wounded another 37. The ship was sent home for repairs but eventually rejoined the fight against Japan. was fired on and hit by multiple Japanese warships during the Battle off Samar when the highly outgunned and outnumbered task force \\"Taffy 3\\" was engaged by a surface group consisting of four battleships, including Japanese battleship Yamato, the largest battleship ever built. Around 08:20, Gambier Bay was severely damaged by a shell hit which flooded her forward engine room, cutting her speed in half. While most US accounts report this as an eight-inch shell from the Japanese heavy cruiser Chikuma, Japanese sources report it was more likely a damaging near-miss from Yamato as both Yamato and Kong≈ç claimed hits on an aircraft carrier at this time but Yamato had the shorter range and a better target angle. Gambier Bay was soon dead in the water as the battleship Yamato closed to point-blank range. Yamato is clearly seen in the background of photographs taken during the attack on \\"Taffy 3\\". Fires raged through the riddled escort carrier, and she capsized at 09:07 and sank at 09:11. The majority of her nearly 800 survivors were rescued two days later by landing and patrol craft dispatched from Leyte Gulf. Sharks killed many drifting crew members. Gambier Bay was the only US Navy aircraft carrier to be sunk by surface naval gunfire during WWII. She lost 147 of her crew. was operating off Luzon on 8 January 1945 when at 07:46 a Ki-43 Oscar plunged down towards the carrier. The aircraft came under heavy anti-aircraft fire but it continued aiming directly for the carrier's bridge. Perhaps as a result of the concentrated fire, it then plunged down, striking below the bridge at the waterline, tearing a 9 ft by 17.5 ft hole, destroying the junior officers' quarters. A brief gasoline fire broke out, which was quickly put under control. A more pressing concern was flooding, which was accentuated by the ship's turn. Her gasoline system was inoperative, and her bow sank 7 ft below design specifications. Remarkably, no one was killed, and only three crewmen were wounded. Kadashan Bay would have to retire for repairs before finishing the war. was hit by a kamikaze attack south of Mindoro, Philippine Islands, on 4 January 1945. At 17:12, a Yokosuka P1Y penetrated the screen undetected and made for Ommaney Bay, approaching directly towards the ship's bow. The enemy plane's approach was partially concealed by the blinding glare of the sun. The plane sliced across the superstructure with its wing, collapsing it onto the flight deck. It then veered into her flight deck on the forward starboard side. Two bombs were released; one of them penetrated the flight deck and detonated below, setting off a series of explosions among the fully gassed planes on the forward third of the hangar deck. The second bomb passed through the hangar deck, ruptured the fire main on the second deck, and exploded near the starboard side. Men struggling with the terrific blazes on the hangar deck soon had to abandon it because of the heavy black smoke from the burning planes and exploding .50 caliber ammunition. Destroyer escorts found it difficult to assist Ommaney Bay, because of the intense heat, the ammunition going off, and the real possibility that a catastrophic detonation could be triggered by the blaze. At 17:45, wounded crew began to be taken off the ship, and by 17:50 the entire topside area had become untenable. In addition, the stored torpedo warheads threatened to detonate at any time. The order to abandon ship was given. Captain Young was the last man to evacuate the burning wreck. At 18:18, the torpedoes stored in the aft end of the ship finally detonated, collapsing the flight deck and launching debris onto the destroyers who were rescuing survivors. Two crewmen from the USS Eichenberger were struck and killed by airborne debris. At 19:58 the carrier was scuttled by a torpedo from the destroyer USS Burns, taking with her 95 men. Seven survivors were killed by a kamikaze attack a few days later on USS Columbia. was operating off Iwo Jima, Volcano Islands, on 21 February 1945 when her task force was hit by kamikazes. Despite the heavy gunfire, a kamikaze approached Bismarck Sea from the starboard side at a low angle, which the anti-aircraft guns could not depress sufficiently to fire at. The plane plowed in under the first 40mm gun (aft), crashing through the hangar deck and striking the ship's magazines. The fire was nearly under control when about two minutes later, a second plane, likely attracted by the ship's glow against the darkness, struck the aft elevator shaft, exploding on impact, killing the majority of the fire-fighting party and destroying the fire fighting salt-water distribution system, thus preventing any further damage control. At 19:00, the crew assembled at their \\"abandon ship\\" locations, and the engines were cut. Captain John L. Pratt issued the order to abandon ship at 19:05. As the crew abandoned ship, a large explosion, likely from the detonation of the torpedoes within the hangar deck, rocked the ship. This explosion tore much of the aft-end of the ship to shreds, and she quickly acquired a list to the starboard. At 20:07, the ship's island detached from the hull and slid into the water. Two hours after the dual kamikaze attacks, at 21:15, Bismarck Sea sank with the loss of 318 men, the last US Navy aircraft carrier to be lost during World War II. Heavy cruiser (CA) was sailing on 29 November 1942 with TF 67 to intercept a Japanese destroyer-transport force expected off Guadalcanal the next night. Just before midnight of the 30th, the American ships transited Lengo Channel and headed past Henderson Field on Guadalcanal as the Japanese task group steamed on a southerly course west of Savo Island to enter \\"Ironbottom Sound\\". In the Battle of Tassafaronga that followed, American destroyers launched torpedoes as the enemy range came within 5 miles of Pensacolas cruiser formation. Now gun flashes, tracers, and star shell candles stained the black inky darkness. Pensacola turned left to prevent collision with two damaged American ships ahead of her. Silhouetted by the burning American cruisers, she came into the Japanese line of fire. One of 18 torpedoes launched by Japanese destroyers hit her below the mainmast on the portside. Her engine room flooded, three gun turrets went out of commission, and her oil tanks ruptured to make a soaked torch of her mast. The oil-fed flames engulfed Pensacolas main deck aft where ammunition exploded. Only supreme effort and skillful damage control by her men saved the ship. The fire punctuated by the frightful explosion of eight-inch projectiles in her Number 3 turret gradually subsided. Pensacola made steady progress toward Tulagi. She arrived there still aflame. After 12 hours the last fire was quenched. Her dead numbered 125 men and 67 men were wounded. She would be out of action for several months. On 17 February 1945 Pensacola was bombarding Iwo Jima when she was hit enemy gun batteries on shore which killed 19 men and wounded 119. Despite the damage, she was temporarily repaired and resumed bombardment and counter-battery fire of enemy positions. Pensacola would finish the war and survived Operation Crossroads to be sunk as target ship in 1948. was sailing with TF 64 on the night of 11 October 1942 to intercept a Japanese resupply convoy headed for Guadalcanal. The American task force sent up a surprise ambush in the dark of night to \\"cross the T\\" and inflict several losses to the Japanese in the resulting Battle of Cape Esperance. During the battle, Salt Lake City fired on multiple Japanese ships scoring many hits. Kinugasa and Salt Lake City exchanged fire with each other, each hitting the other several times, causing minor damage to Kinugasa and damaging one of Salt Lake Citys boilers, reducing her speed. Salt Lake City would spend the next four months undergoing repairs and replenishment at Pearl Harbor. She would take part in an operation to prevent the Japanese from reinforcing their island garrisons on Attu and Kiska Islands in the Aleutians. Operating with TF 8, contact was made with Japanese ships on 26 March 1943 leading to the Battle of the Komandorski Islands. Despite being outnumbered two to one, the Americans pressed their attack, hoping to get shots at transports. The enemy responded by opening fire at 20,000 yards. The ensuing battle was a retiring action on the part of the Americans, for the Japanese foiled their attempt to get to the auxiliaries. Salt Lake City received most of the attention and soon received two hits, one of them amidships, mortally wounding two men, but she responded with very accurate fire. Her rudder stops were carried away, limiting her to 10¬∞ course changes. The starboard seaplane caught fire and was jettisoned. Another hit soon flooded forward compartments. Under cover of a thick smokescreen and aggressive torpedo attacks by the destroyers, the American cruisers were able to make an evasive turn, which for a while allowed the range to open. Salt Lake City soon began taking hits again and her boiler fires died one by one. Salt water had entered the fuel oil feed lines. There was now cause for grave concern; she lay dead in the water, and the Japanese ships were closing fast. Luckily, she was hidden in the smoke, and the enemy was not aware of her plight. The destroyers charged the Japanese cruisers and began to draw the fire away from the damaged Salt Lake City. Her engineers purged the fuel lines and fired the boilers. With fresh oil supplying the fires, she built up steam and gained headway. Salt Lake City would be repaired and participated in several more campaigns in the war, earning 11 battle stars for its service. Like her sister, she was sunk as a target ship in 1948. was operating with a cruiser-destroyer force on 30 November 1942 to prevent the Japanese from reinforcing their garrison on Guadalcanal. During the Battle of Tassafaronga, Northampton along with four additional cruisers and four destroyers all opened fire on an unsuspecting Japanese task force of eight destroyers. The Japanese did not return fire for several minutes as the Americans stunning cannonade scored many hits and sinking one destroyer; Takanami. The Japanese destroyers began laying a smokescreen and launched more than 45 \\"Long Lance\\" torpedoes towards the American column. Four of the five American cruisers were hit by torpedoes, killing hundreds of men. Northampton which was the last ship in the column was hit by two torpedoes most likely launched from Kawakaze. One hit 10 feet below the waterline abreast the after engine room, and four seconds later, the second hit 40 feet further aft, ripping away decks and bulkheads. The after engine room flooded, three of four shafts ceased turning, and flaming oil sprayed over the ship; she took on water rapidly and began to list. Three hours later, as she began to sink stern-first, she had to be abandoned. So orderly and controlled was the process that loss of life was surprisingly light. 50 men were killed during the battle. Most of the survivors were picked up within an hour by destroyers of Task Force 67. About 40 crewmen spent the rest of the night in two life rafts. had been bombarding Taroa Island on 1 February 1942 when she came under heavy air attack from land based dive bombers. The ship was hit with a 135lb bomb in the well deck which killed 8 and wounded 38. The ship returned to Pearl Harbor for repairs. While cruising in support of the operations in the Solomons, specifically north of the New Hebrides Islands, Chester was hit by a torpedo from I-176 on the starboard side, amidships on 20 October which killed 11 and wounded 12. She returned to Espiritu Santo under her own power for emergency repairs on 23 October. Chester would earn 11 battle stars for her service in WWII. The ship would be scrapped in 1959 after years in mothball. was operating with TF 38 on 5 January 1945 off Lingayen Gulf when she was hit by a kamikaze which crashed into the No. 2 eight-inch gun turret, killing 1, wounding 17, including the captain, and knocking the turret out of commission. A second kamikaze hit the ship the next day on 6 January 1945, crashing into the starboard side signal bridge, and fatally injuring Rear Admiral Theodore E. Chandler commander of cruiser Division 4. 42 crewmen were killed and 125 wounded by the attack. Despite the damage, Louisville continued bombarding enemy positions and shot down several planes before she put in for repairs. The ship rejoined the fleet in time for the battle of Okinawa. On 5 June 1945, she was again hit by a kamikaze (initially identified as a friendly plane). Four twin 20 AA cannon opened up to set the kamikaze ablaze prior to hitting Louisville which killed eight sailors on a quad 40 mm AA gun mount, injured 45 sailors, bent the number 1 smoke stack, cut Louisvilles seaplane off and left only the pontoon on the catapult. Louisville was back on the gun line by 9 June. She survived the war to be scrapped in 1959. She was awarded 13 battle stars for her WWII service. was patrolling the waters just south of Savo Island on the night of 10 August 1942 when at 01:43 flares dropped from Japanese planes illuminated Chicago in the dark night, giving her position away to a Japanese surface task force of 5 heavy and 2 light cruisers which had managed to sneak into firing range undetected. At 01:47, a torpedo, probably from Japanese cruiser Kako, hit Chicagos bow, sending a shock wave throughout the ship that damaged the main battery director. A second torpedo hit but failed to explode, and a shell hit the cruiser's mainmast, killing two crewmen. Chicago steamed west for 40 minutes away from the battle to tend her torpedo damage. After repairs in San Francisco, Chicago returned to the theater of combat. On 29 January 1943 while escorting a convoy south of Guadalcanal her task force came under repeated air attacks from Japanese G4M and G3M torpedo bombers in what would be known as the Battle of Rennell Island. During the attacks, two burning Japanese planes silhouetted the American ships, providing enough light for further torpedo runs; at 19:38 two hits on Chicago caused severe flooding and loss of power. The ship came to a dead stop. In pitch darkness, Louisville managed to take the crippled Chicago under tow and slowly headed south, away from the battle area, escorted by the rest of the task force. The next morning of 30 Jan, the fleet tug Navajo took over the tow job from Louisville, which was accomplished at 08:00. At 16:00 eleven G4M torpedo bombers launched an attack on the damaged cruiser. Although sustaining several losses, the G4M bombers managed to hit Chicago with four torpedoes at 16:24; one forward of the bridge and three others in her engineering spaces. Captain Ralph O. Davis gave the order to abandon ship shortly before Chicago sank stern first 20 minutes later, taking 62 of her crew with her, most of them killed by the torpedo detonations. Escorting ships rescued her 1,049 survivors. and her task force were sailing to intercept a Japanese invasion convoy bound for Makassar on 4 February 1942 when she became the target of an enemy aerial bomb that put Turret 3 out of commission, killing 48 men and wounding 20. Houston subsequently sought refuge at Tjilatjap to work on repairs and to tend to wounded sailors. Receiving word that the major Japanese invasion force was approaching Java protected by a formidable surface unit, Houston sailed on 26 February 1942 with a task force of one other heavy cruiser, three light cruisers and ten destroyers to intercept. The Japanese force consisted of 2 heavy cruisers, 2 light cruisers, 14 destroyers and 10 transports. Both sides sighted each other at 16:00 on 27 February and opened fire soon after closing range; marking the start of the Battle of Java Sea. Poor accuracy affected both sides, but the Allied fleet took more damage and was unable to attack the Japanese transports. At 18:00 the Allied force disengaged, having lost several ships with no success attacking the transports. After dispatching all remaining destroyers back to Surabaya, the Allied task force commander attempted to evade the Japanese escort group but at 23:00 encountered the enemy warships again. The Allied flagship and another cruiser were sunk by torpedoes, leaving Houston and alone. Both ships managed to make it to Tjilatjap on 28 Feb, but were unable to resupply or refuel completely. While attempting to navigate through the Sunda Strait the two cruisers ran into a Japanese invasion task force with 5 cruisers and 12 destroyers around 23:30. During the desperate battle, the two cruisers managed to sink and ground four enemy transports and inflicted damage on four other warships, but Houston and Perth were both severely outnumbered and fought a fierce battle at close range with the Japanese. At midnight, Perth attempted to force a way through the destroyers, but was hit by four torpedoes in the space of a few minutes, then subject to close range gunfire until sinking at 02:40 on 1 March. Houston was engaged on all sides at ranges never greater than 5000 yards, taking many hits, including a hit on the bridge which killed the captain. After being struck with two torpedoes, with Japanese destroyers that were firing less than 1500 yards away with cannon and machine guns, the order to abandon ship was given. She rolled on her side and went down at 03:00 after receiving a final torpedo hit. 693 men went down with Houston, while 368 survived the sinking to become prisoners of the Japanese. 77 more of Houstons crew would die while in captivity. was sailing on 30 November 1942 as part of a task force to interpret Japanese destroyers resupplying Guadalcanal. The two sides clashed in the Battle of Tassafaronga. When the flagship Minneapolis was struck by two torpedoes, New Orleans, next astern, was forced to sheer away to avoid collision, and ran into the track of a torpedo which detonated the ship's forward magazines and gasoline tanks. The blast severed the ship's entire bow forward of turret two. The bow twisted to port, damaging the ship's hull as it was wrenched free by the ship's momentum, and sank immediately off the aft port quarter. Everyone in turrets one and two perished. New Orleans was forced into a reverse course to starboard and lost steering and communications. A total of 183 men were killed. With one-quarter of her length gone, slowed to 2 knots, and damage control parties managed to repair the ship enough to sail to Tulagi Harbor near daybreak on 1 December. The crew camouflaged their ship from air attack, jury-rigged a bow of coconut logs, and worked clearing away wreckage. Eleven days later, New Orleans sailed stern-first to avoid sinking to Sydney, Australia, arriving on 24 December While docked in Sydney, the damaged propeller was replaced and other repairs were made, including the installation of a temporary stub bow. On 7 March 1943, she left Sydney for Puget Sound, sailing backward the entire voyage, where a new bow was fitted with the use of Minneapoliss No. 2 Turret. All battle damage was repaired and she was given a major refit. New Orleans would finish their war with 17 battle stars for her service in WWII, among the highest in the US Navy. She spent her final days in the navy transporting prisoners of war back home. The ship was scrapped in 1959. was among a force of five cruisers and eight destroyers under Daniel J. Callaghan on the night of 12 November 1942 which steamed to counter an approaching Japanese force. They spotted a Japanese force of two battleships, one cruiser and eleven destroyers and immediately opened fire, sinking the Japanese destroyer Akatsuki. Shortly thereafter, Portland was struck by a torpedo fired by either the destroyer Inazuma or the destroyer Ikazuchi at 01:58, causing heavy damage to her stern. The torpedo struck the starboard side, which blew off both inboard propellers, jammed the rudder five degrees to starboard, and jammed her Number Three turret in train and elevation. A four-degree list was quickly corrected by shifting ballast, but the steering problem could not be overcome and the ship was forced to steam in circles to starboard. The blast disrupted her steering column, forcing her to steer in a circle. At the end of her first circle, she fired on the battleship Hiei, with her forward turrets. The Japanese ship returned fire, but all salvos passed over the cruiser. In the four six-gun salvos returned by Portland, she succeeded in starting fires in the Japanese ship. At dawn, she was one of three U.S. ships still too damaged to withdraw on her own power. Then again at 06:30, still circling, Portland opened fire on the abandoned hulk of the destroyer Y≈´dachi at a range of 6 miles. After the sixth salvo, Y≈´dachi exploded, rolled over, and sank within five minutes. Portland was eventually able to correct the steering problem and withdraw on her own. She suffered 18 killed, 17 wounded in the battle. After six months of stateside repairs, Portland rejoined the fleet in early June 1943. She would earn 16 battle stars for her service in WWII, and was sold for scrap in 1959. on the morning of 7 August 1942 entered the waters between Guadalcanal and Florida Islands in the southern Solomons. Throughout the day, she supported the Marines as they landed on Guadalcanal and several smaller islands nearby. The Japanese launched air counterattacks on the 7th‚Äì8th, and Astoria helped to defend the transports from those attacks. On the night of 8/9 Aug, a Japanese force of seven cruisers and a destroyer under Vice Admiral Gunichi Mikawa sneaked by Savo Island and attacked the American ships. At the time, Astoria had been patrolling to the east of Savo Island in column behind Vincennes and Quincy. The Japanese came through the channel to the west of Savo Island and opened fire. The Japanese then divided into two separate groups and turned northeast, passing on either side of Astoria and her two consorts. The enemy cruisers began firing on that force at about 0150, and the Astoria began returning fire immediately. She ceased fire briefly because her commanding officer temporarily mistook the Japanese force for friendly ships but soon resumed shooting. Astoria took no hits in the first four Japanese salvoes, but the fifth ripped into her superstructure, turning her into an inferno amidships. In quick succession, enemy shells put her No. 1 turret out of action and started a serious fire in the plane hangar that burned brightly and provided the enemy with a self-illuminated target. From that moment on, deadly accurate Japanese gunfire pounded her unmercifully, and she began to lose speed. Turning to the right to avoid Quincys fire at about 0201, Astoria reeled as a succession of enemy shells struck her aft of the foremast. Soon thereafter, Quincy veered across Astorias bow, blazing fiercely from bow to stern. Astoria put her rudder over hard left and avoided a collision while her battered sister ship passed aft, to starboard. As the warship turned, Kinugasa's searchlight illuminated her, and men on deck passed the order to No. 2 turret to shoot out the offending light. When the turret responded with Astorias 12th and final salvo, the shells missed Kinugasa but struck the No. 1 turret of Ch≈çkai. Astoria lost steering control on the bridge at about 02:25, shifted control to central station, and began steering a zig-zag course south. Before she made much progress, though, the heavy cruiser lost all power. Fortunately, the Japanese chose that exact instant to withdraw. By 03:00, nearly 400 men, including about 70 wounded and many dead, were assembled on the forecastle deck. Suffering from the effects of at least 65 hits, Astoria fought for her life. A bucket brigade battled the blaze on the gun deck and the starboard passage forward from that deck, and the wounded were moved to the captain's cabin, where doctors and corpsmen proceeded with their care. Eventually, however, the deck beneath grew hot and forced the wounded back to the forecastle. Bagley came alongside Astorias starboard bow and, by 0445, took all of the wounded off the heavy cruiser's forecastle. Since it appeared that the ship could be saved, a salvage crew of about 325 able-bodied men went back aboard Astoria. Another bucket brigade attacked the fires while the ship's first lieutenant investigated all accessible lower decks. A party of men collected the dead and prepared them for burial. Nevertheless, the fire below decks increased steadily in intensity, and those topside could hear explosions. Her list increased, first to 10¬∞ and then 15¬∞. Her stern lowered in the dark waters, and her bow was distinctively rising. All attempts to shore the shell holes, by then below the waterline due to the increasing list, proved ineffective, and the list increased still more. With the port waterway awash at noon, Commodore William G. Greenman gave the order to abandon ship. Astoria turned over on her port beam, rolled slowly, and settled by the stern, disappearing completely by 12:16. Not one man from the salvage crew lost his life. Officially, 219 men were reported missing or killed. was operating off Okinawa on 31 March 1945; when Indianapolis lookouts spotted a Japanese Nakajima Ki-43 \\"Oscar\\" fighter as it emerged from the morning twilight and dived vertically towards the bridge. The ship's 20 mm guns opened fire, but within 15 seconds the plane was over the ship. Tracers converged on it, causing it to swerve, but the pilot managed to release his bomb from a height of 25 ft, then crashing his plane into the sea near the port stern. The bomb plummeted through the deck, into the crew's mess hall, down through the berthing compartment, and through the fuel tanks before crashing through the keel and exploding in the water underneath. The concussion blew two gaping holes in the keel which flooded nearby compartments, killing nine crewmen. The ship's bulkheads prevented any progressive flooding. Indianapolis, settling slightly by the stern and listing to port, steamed to a salvage ship for emergency repairs. Here, inspection revealed that her propeller shafts were damaged, her fuel tanks ruptured, and her water-distilling equipment ruined. But Indianapolis commenced the long trip across the Pacific, under her own power, to the Mare Island Navy Yard for repairs. After major repairs and an overhaul, Indianapolis received orders to undertake a top secret mission: to deliver enriched uranium and other important components of the Little Boy atomic device. After leaving San Francisco on 16 July, she arrived at Tinian Island on 26 July. After leaving Tinian the ship stopped at Guam where a number of her crew who had completed their tours of duty were relieved by other sailors. The ship left Guam headed for Leyte on 28 July 1945. At 00:15 on 30 July, Indianapolis was struck on her starboard side by two Type 95 torpedoes, one in the bow and one amidships, from the Japanese submarine I-58. The explosions caused massive damage. Indianapolis quickly took on a heavy list and settled by the bow. Twelve minutes later, she rolled completely over, then her stern rose into the air and she sank. Some 300 of the 1,195 crewmen aboard went down with the ship. Many of the survivors were wounded, and all suffered from lack of food and water. Exposure to the elements, dehydration from the hot sun during the day and hypothermia at night, as well as severe desquamation due to exposure to oily salt water, and frequent shark attacks slowly whittled down the survivors. Some killed themselves or other survivors in various states of delirium and hallucinations. Navy command did not know of the ship's sinking until survivors were spotted in the open ocean three and a half days later. Only 316 of the nearly 900 men set adrift after the sinking survived. 2 more crewmen would die of their wounds. was sailing on 30 November 1942 as flagship of TF 67 which consisted of Fletcher, Perkins, Maury, Drayton, Minneapolis, New Orleans, Pensacola, Honolulu, Northampton, Lamson, and Ladner to intercept a Japanese task force consisting of 8 destroyers; six of them carrying drums full of supplies in a midnight attempt to reinforce and resupply Guadalcanal. At 23:21, Minneapolis opened fire on the destroyer Takanami, which quickly sank after several hits. At 23:27 after firing her ninth salvo, Minneapolis took two torpedo hits. One of the warheads hit her port side, exploding the aviation fuel storage tanks forward of Turret 1 and folding the bow down to over 70 degrees. The second torpedo hit portside aft and knocked out three of the ship's four fire rooms, opening two of them to the sea. 37 of her crew were lost. The ship was saved by skillful damage control work and was able to reach Tulagi where she was temporarily repaired by her own crew. From August 1943 Minneapolis would go on to serve in every major American operation in the Pacific save Iwo Jima. For her service in WWII she was awarded 16 Battle Stars. was protecting unloading transports near Lunga Point, Guadalcanal on 12 November 1942 when a group of Japanese torpedo bombers attacked at 14:08. At 1416, an already-damaged torpedo bomber dropped its torpedo off San Franciscos starboard quarter. The torpedo passed alongside, but the plane crashed into San Franciscos control aft, swung around that structure, and plunged over the port side into the sea. 16 men were killed, and 29 wounded. Control aft was demolished. The ship's secondary command post, Battle Two, was burned out but was reestablished by dark. The after anti-aircraft director and radar were put out of commission. Three 20 mm mounts were destroyed. At about midnight on 13 November 1942, San Francisco, in company with heavy cruiser USS Portland, the light cruisers Atlanta, Helena, and Juneau, and eight destroyers, entered Lengo Channel. At 0125, a Japanese naval force was discovered about 27,000 yd to the northwest. Rear Admiral Callaghan's task group maneuvered to intercept in what became the first engagement in the Naval Battle of Guadalcanal. At 0148, in almost pitch darkness, San Francisco opened fire on an enemy cruiser 3,700 yd off her starboard beam. At 01:51, she trained her guns on a small cruiser or large destroyer 3,300 yd off her starboard bow. Then in an attempt to locate other targets, San Francisco accidentally targeted Atlanta. San Franciscos gunfire caused extensive damage to Atlanta, killing Admiral Scott and most of Atlantas bridge crew. At about 0200, San Francisco trained her guns on Kirishima. At the same time, she became the target of Nagara off her starboard bow and of a destroyer which had crossed her bow and was passing down her port side. The enemy battleship joined the cruiser and the destroyer in firing on San Francisco, whose port 5 in battery engaged the destroyer but was put out of action except for one mount. The battleship put the starboard 5 in battery out of commission. San Francisco swung left while her main battery continued to fire on the battleships which, with the cruiser and the destroyer, continued to pound San Francisco. A direct hit on the navigation bridge killed or badly wounded all officers, except for the communications officer. Steering and engine control were lost and shifted to Battle Two which was soon also knocked out was out of commission by a direct hit from the port side. Control was again lost. Control was reestablished in the conning tower, which soon received a hit from the starboard side. Steering and engine control were temporarily lost, then regained. All communications were now dead. Soon thereafter, the enemy ceased firing. San Francisco followed suit and withdrew eastward along the north coast of Guadalcanal. 77 sailors, including Rear Admiral Daniel J. Callaghan and Captain Cassin Young, had been killed, and 105 wounded in the night's action. The ship had taken 45 hits. Structural damage was extensive, but not fatal. No hits had been received below the waterline. Twenty-two fires had been started and extinguished. The ship reached San Francisco for repairs on 11 December 1942. She would return to the Pacific by 26 February 1943. San Francisco was one of the Navy's most decorated ships, being awarded 17 Battle stars for her service. She was scrapped in 1961. While on patrol in the channel between Florida Island and Savo Island, in the early hours of 9 August, Quincy was attacked by a large Japanese naval force during the Battle of Savo Island. Quincy had seen aircraft flares dropped over other ships in the task force, and had just sounded general quarters and was coming alert when the searchlights from the Japanese column came on. Quincys captain, Samuel N. Moore, gave the order to commence firing, but the gun crews were not ready. Within a few minutes, Quincy was caught in a crossfire between Aoba, Furutaka, and Tenry≈´, and was hit heavily and set afire. Quincys captain ordered his cruiser to charge towards the eastern Japanese column, but as she turned to do so Quincy was hit by two torpedoes from Tenry≈´, causing severe damage. Quincy managed to fire a few main gun salvos, one of which hit Ch≈çkai‚Äôs chart room 20 ft from Admiral Mikawa and killed or wounded 36 men, although Mikawa was not injured. At 02:10, incoming shells killed or wounded almost all of Quincys bridge crew, including the captain. At 02:16, the cruiser was hit by a torpedo from Aoba, and the ship's remaining guns were silenced. Quincy sustained many direct hits which left 370 men dead and 167 wounded. She sank, bow first, at 02:38, being the first ship sunk in the area which was later known as Ironbottom Sound. was patrolling as a screen off Savo Island for unloading transport ships on the night of 9 August 1942 when at about 0145, lookouts spotted flares and star shells to the southward, accompanied by the low rumble of gunfire. The sound of the general quarters alarm soon rang throughout the ship and stirred her to action. Unbeknownst to the men manning the ships to the northward, a powerful enemy force was heading in their direction. The first Japanese cruiser searchlight beams illuminated Vincennes shortly after 0155, and the American cruiser opened fire with her main battery at the troublesome lights. Within a minute, however, Japanese shells bracketed the ship and Vincennes shuddered under the impact of Japanese eight-inch armor-piercing shells. The bridge, carpenter shop, \\"Battle II,\\" and radio antenna trunks all were hit by the first salvo. The ship reeled under the impact of a second salvo of direct hits which set fire to the volatile aircraft in Vincenness hangar space, and the resultant flames became uncontrollable. A direct hit knocked the aft antiaircraft director overboard. At 02:00, Vincennes heeled to starboard in an attempt to evade enemy gunfire, only to be hit by Japanese torpedoes. One or two \\"Long Lance\\" torpedoes ripped into the ship's number 4 fireroom and put it out of action. In moments the report came \\"Both engine rooms are black and dead.\\" At 0210, the Japanese retired, leaving Savo Island and the burning hulks of three American cruisers in their wakes. As Vincenness list increased to port, the order to abandon ship was given at 0230. Serviceable life jackets and rafts were broken out, and the crew began abandoning ship. 332 of her men would go down with her as she rolled over and sank 2.5 miles east of Savo Island at 02:50. joined TF 38 in October 1944, which was tasked with performing air raids on Okinawa and Taiwan, in preparation for the landings at Leyte. On 13 October 1944, an air- dropped torpedo from a Japanese aircraft hit the cruiser below her armour belt. The explosion killed 23 personnel and exposed the engineering spaces to the ocean, stalling the ship. The ship was docked for repairs from February until October 1945. Light cruiser (CL) was moored on the west side of Ford Island when the Japanese made their surprise attack on Pearl Harbor. In the first attack wave a torpedo passed ahead and a second hit Raleigh portside amidships. The cruiser took such a list to port that it appeared she might capsize. As crew jettisoned topside weight to keep her upright, her gunners helped to destroy five Japanese planes. Several of her crew were wounded, but none were killed. was on a tour to survey the potential use of a number of southeast Pacific islands in national defense and commercial aviation when during this cruise, she suffered a gasoline explosion which killed 24 men including her executive officer, and caused considerable damage, which was repaired at Balboa, Panama. was attempting to intercept a Japanese invasion convoy in the Makassar Strait on 4 February 1942 when her task force was attacked by 60 Japanese bombers. Marblehead successfully maneuvered through three attacks. After the third, an enemy plane spiraled toward the cruiser, but her gunners splashed it. The next minute a fourth wave of seven bombers released bombs at Marblehead. Two were direct hits and a third a near-miss close aboard the port bow causing severe underwater damage. Fires swept the ship as she listed to starboard and began to settle by the bow. Her rudder jammed, Marblehead continuing to steam at full speed, circled to port. Her gunners kept firing, while damage control crews fought the fires and helped the wounded. By 1100, the fires were under control. Before noon the enemy planes departed, leaving the damaged cruiser with 15 dead or mortally wounded and 84 seriously injured. Marblehead underwent extensive repairs before being sent to the Atlantic theater for the rest of the war. was providing gun support for US troops attacking Salerno Bay as a part of Operation Avalanche on 11 September 1943 when her task force came under assault from the German Luftwaffe unit KG-100. Savannah was hit by a Fritz-X radio-guided bomb at 10:00. The bomb pierced the roof of Turret 3, passed through three decks into the lower ammunition handling room, where it exploded, blowing a hole in her keel and tearing a seam in the cruiser's port side. For at least 30 minutes, secondary explosions in the turret and its ammunition supply rooms hampered firefighting efforts. Savannahs crew quickly sealed off flooded and burned compartments, and corrected her list. With assistance from the salvage tugs Hopi and Moreno; Savannah got underway under her own steam by 17:57 hours and steamed for Malta. She lost 175 crewmen from the attack and ship would be out of action for 10 months. was shelling Vila airfield on Kolombangara when on the night of 12 May, she suffered a powder charge explosion in one of her forward turrets, killing 18 and injuring 17. She returned to the states for two months of repairs and modernization. On 13 December 1944, she was struck by a kamikaze off Negros Island at 14:15. The plane smashed into the ship's port main deck waist, both of its bombs went off on the deck and gasoline fires engulfed the area near the crash. Ammunition for 5 in, 40 mm, and 20mm cooked off causing more casualties. In this attack 135 men were killed and another 190 wounded. The ship would be sold to the Chilean Navy and would serve until 1985. was with the task force which on the night of 11‚Äì12 October 1942, encountered a force of Japanese cruisers and destroyers to the west of Guadalcanal. In the engagement now known as the Battle of Cape Esperance, Boise was hit a number of times, twice by fire from a Japanese heavy cruiser from about 7,500 yards range. One hit exploded upon impact on her armor causing little damage. The other exploded in the six-inch magazine located between Number I and II turrets causing a powder fire and flooding, putting Turrets I, II, and III out of action and causing a number of casualties including 107 killed. Boise would be repaired and returned to a lengthy service with the Navy during WWII. The ship would be sold to the Argentine Navy and eventually made its way back to the US and finally Japan (ironically) for scrapping in 1978. was damaged by a near-miss bomb during the attack on Pearl Harbor, requiring repairs. The ship suffered no casualties during the raid. While operating as part of TF 67 off Kolombangara Island on 13 July 1943 shortly after midnight, contact was made with an enemy cruiser-destroyer force. At 0110, Honolulu opened fire on a Sendai-class cruiser. After three salvos, the target burst into flame and was soon dead in the water. Honolulu shifted fire to an enemy destroyer, which was immediately hit and disappeared. At 0211, a torpedo struck the starboard side of Honolulu, blowing off her bow. Luckily the ship suffered no casualties during the battle. The task force then retired to Tulagi for temporary repairs, and then departed for the large naval base at Pearl Harbor. On 16 August, Honolulu arrived at Pearl Harbor for major repairs and a new bow. She then proceeded to the shipyard at Mare Island, near San Francisco, for more work. On 20 October 1944 she was screening the invasion force of Leyte when she was attacked by a Japanese torpedo bomber. She was hit on the port side, and once again suffered damage that required a return to the US for repairs. After the war, Honolulu would be mothballed and sold for scrap in 1959. engaged an enemy force on 12 July 1942 consisting of the Japanese cruiser Jintsu and five destroyers in the Battle of Kolombangara. During the battle, which raged for over an hour, St. Louis was hit by a torpedo that twisted her bow but caused no serious casualties. The ship would be out of action until November 1942. On 13 January 1944, she arrived in the area between Buka and St. George Channel to support landing operations in the Green Islands, off of New Ireland. On the 14th, at 1945 her group was attacked by six D3A \\"Val\\" dive bombers; two of the planes closed on St. Louis. The first plane missed with all three bombs. The second plane scored a hit on the light cruiser. The bomb that hit penetrated the 40 mm clipping room near the No. 6 gun mount, and exploded in the midships living compartment. Twenty-three died and twenty were wounded. Repairs were completed by the end of the month, and in March, St. Louis resumed operations with her division. On 29 November 1944, St. Louis was operating in Leyte Gulf when she was attacked by several kamikazes. A D4Y dove on St. Louis from the port quarter, and exploded with its bomb on impact. Fires broke out in the cruiser's hangar area and spaces. All crew members of 20 mm guns 7‚Äì10 were killed or wounded. At 11:46, there was still no CAP cover over the cruiser's formation, and at 1151, two more enemy planes, both burning, attacked St. Louis. The first was splashed off the port quarter, and the second drove in from starboard and crashed almost on board on the port side. A 20 ft section of armor belt was lost and numerous holes were torn in her hull. By 1152, the ship had taken on a list to port. At 1210, another kamikaze closed on St. Louis but was shot down less than 400 yards away. Sixteen men were lost on St. Louis and 43 wounded. By 1236, the cruiser was back on an even keel. Thirty minutes later, all major fires were out, and salvage work had been started. She would reach California for repairs towards the end of December. St. Louis would earn eleven battle stars for her service in WWII. After the war, the ship was sold to the Brazilian Navy, and sunk in 1980 while being towed to the scrap yard. moored in Pearl Harbor when the base came under attack by Japanese carrier planes. She was mistaken for a battleship and targeted by Japanese torpedo bombers. A torpedo passed underneath Oglala and hit Helena amidships on the starboard side. The blast tore a hole in the hull that flooded the starboard engine and boiler rooms and severed wiring for the main and secondary guns. The ship's crew raced to their battle stations and two minutes after the torpedo hit, the backup forward diesel generator had been turned on, restoring power to the guns. Oglala was less fortunate than Helena, as the blast effect loosened hull plates on the minelayer and caused her to capsize. As Helenas anti-aircraft guns got into action, they helped to fend off further attacks from the second strike wave while other men worked to control flooding by closing the many watertight hatches in the ship. Two days after the attack, Helena was moved into dry dock No. 2 in Pearl Harbor for an inspection and temporary repairs. Steel plates were welded over the torpedo hole and on 31 December, Helena was refloated. She got underway for Mare Island for permanent repairs and modifications on 5 January 1942. In late July 1942 she would rejoin the fleet in time for Operation Watchtower. Helena would participate in many of the surface actions around Guadalcanal, sinking several Japanese ships and destroying many enemy planes. She would emerge through the campaign with negligible shell damage which killed one man. On 6 July 1943 Helena was operating as part of TF 68 which was engaging ten Japanese destroyers that were attempting to resupply garrison troops at Kula Gulf. At 01:57 the Americans opened up with radar directed fire, quickly sinking several enemy destroyers. As the American ships turned to engage a second group of destroyers at 02:03; Helena was hit on the port side below the forward most turret which caused a major explosion. The blast destroyed the No. 1 turret, tore open the hull almost to the keel, and severed the bow from the rest of the hull. The rest of the hull began to flood as the force of the blast collapsed bulkheads below turret No. 2. But even after the severe damage inflicted by the first torpedo, the aft main guns continued to fire, and the ship had not yet been fatally damaged. Two minutes after the first torpedo hit, the second and third torpedoes struck the ship in quick succession, much lower in the hull than the first had hit, as much as 15 ft below the waterline. This was below where the ship's belt armor might have reduced the scale of damage inflicted. These hit further aft in the machinery spaces, breaking the keel, flooding the forward engine and boiler rooms, and breaching bulkheads that allowed water into the aft engine room. The flooding disabled the ship's engines and left her immobilized and without electrical power. Another gaping hole had been blasted into the hull, which exacerbated the flooding caused by the first hit. It quickly became clear that Helena would not be able to survive. Two minutes after the third hit, the captain gave the order to abandon ship. With the keel having been broken by the second and third hit, the girders that supported the hull structure began to buckle, collapsing the entire structure amidships and breaking the hull in half. The center third of the ship quickly sank but the bow and stern remained afloat for some time before flooding caused them both to point upward as they filled with water. During the chaos of battle, it had not been known that Helena was hit and sinking by the other ships in her task force. At 02:30 it was quickly realized that Helena was not responding to radio messages and ships began to search for the missing cruiser. At 03:13, Radford's radar picked up a contact some 5,000 yards away, and confirmed it was Helenas bow pointing up out of the water. Nearly a thousand men were in the water, clinging to life rafts and waiting to be picked up by the destroyers, which reached the men at 03:41. In the course of the night's operations, Nicholas had picked up 291 while Radford had rescued 444. A significant number of men were still in the water; some life rafts remained in the area, while a number of men had climbed onto the still floating bow or clung to pieces of floating wreckage. Other groups of men were pulled there by the current; as the men reached the coral reef that surrounded the island on 8 July, they were met by locals who helped pull the men to shore and put them in contact with the coastwatcher station. Out of a crew of almost 1,200; 168 men were killed, either during the battle or while the men were adrift. was sailing as a part of TF 67 on 12 November 1942 with four additional cruisers and eight destroyers to meet an incoming Japanese surface force consisting of two battleships and eleven destroyers intending on bombarding Henderson Field. In total darkness; the two task forces streamed towards on another until at 01:48, Atlanta was illuminated by searchlights from Japanese battleship Hiei which was only 3,000 yards away, practically point-blank range for the battleship. The two sides began to open fire on one another and the battle quickly turned into a chaotic and confused close-range melee in the pitch-black dark. During the wild fight, Atlanta, being exposed as the lead cruiser in the US formation was hit by several shells and took a torpedo hit to her port engine room, killing almost all power to the ship and leaving her guns inoperable. Right after being torpedoed, Atlanta drifted into the line of fire of San Francisco and took at least nineteen eight-inch shells from the friendly ship, killing Admiral Norman Scott and most of the bridge staff. Captain Jenkins survived the slaughter on the bridge and ordered the crew to began clearing debris, jettisoning topside weight to correct the list, reducing the volume of sea water in the ship, and tending the wounded. As day broke, Atlanta was still without power and drifting about in the sound. She was taken under tow by a tugboat but by 14:00, Captain Jenkins decided the ship was beyond saving and ordered the abandonment of Atlanta. The ship was sunk by demolition charges by her own crew, going down at 20:15 on 13 November 1942. She lies in 400 ft of water, 3 miles west of Lunga Point. was engaged in the Naval Battle of Guadalcanal on 13 November 1942, firing on an enemy destroyer when she was hit by a torpedo on her port side from Amatsukaze causing flooding and a severe list. Juneau withdrew from the action, and after the melee was over proceeded to Espiritu Santo with other ships damaged in the night's action. She was steaming 800 yards off the starboard quarter of San Francisco, down by the bow and making a steady 13 kn when she was spotted by Japanese submarine I-26. At 11:00, two torpedoes were fired at San Francisco but missed and hit Juneau. One of the torpedoes stuck in the same spot Juneau had been hit earlier, setting off an enormous explosion that engulfed the entire ship, breaking her into two halves. She was gone in less than thirty seconds. Owing to the massive explosion and quick sinking, it was assumed by the task force commander that nobody could have survived Juneau's destruction, and fearing more submarine attacks on his damaged force; he made the decision to not stop and pick up survivors. But over 100 of Juneau's crew had survived the sinking, and were left stranded in shark-infested waters for over eight days before only 10 men were finally rescued. In total 687 of Juneau's crew died as a result of her sinking; including all five Sullivan brothers. was struck by a kamikaze \\"Val\\" on 1 January 1945 while operating in Lingayen Gulf. The plane hit the ship's aft quarter, and penetrated two decks before its bomb exploded, killing 13 and wounding 44, and knocking out her rear turrets. Prompt and effective damage control prevented the fires from spreading and causing more explosions, allowing Columbia to remain on station. On 9 January 1945, she was hit again by a kamikaze \\"Tojo\\" fighter which crashed into the forward gun director gun mount, killing 24 and wounding 97 men. Again, Columbia's damage control teams jumped into action and kept the ship in action, able to resume her fire support despite the damage. Columbia would be awarded ten battle stars for her service in WWII. was operating in support of landings at Cape Torokina on 13 November 1943 when at 04:55 she was hit by an air dropped torpedo in her starboard side. Twenty men were killed by the blast which knocked out all power and the ship took on a list. She was towed away to make temporary repairs. The ship would return to service in June 1944, awarded eleven battle stars for her service in WWII, and finally scrapped in 1960. was operating off Bougainville Island on 8 November 1943 when her task force came under air attack by Japanese planes. She was hit by two bombs and a torpedo which blew a 30-foot hole into her port side, although she managed to shoot down all of her attackers. Two men were killed and 34 wounded. On 24 October 1944 while sailing with TF 38, Birmingham came to the assistance of the stricken carrier Princeton, coming alongside to help fight fires, when at 15:24, a magazine detonated on board Princeton causing extensive damage to Birmingham's superstructure. On board Birmingham 239 men were killed and 408 wounded during the attempt to save the carrier. Birmingham had to put in for repairs which were completed by Jan 1945. While operating off Okinawa on 4 May 1945, Birmingham was hit by an \\"Oscar\\" from directly overhead which crashed through her main forward deck, its bomb exploding in the sick bay, killing everyone there. 51 were killed and 81 were wounded. The ship would finish WWII with nine battle stars. She was scrapped in 1959. was hit by a burning \\"Val\\" kamikaze dive bomber which crashed amidships at her port water line. The damage was minor and luckily the plane's bomb was a dud, but two men were injured in the attack. was operating with TF 38 which was conducting air strikes on Formosa when on 14 October 1944 the task force was attacked by Japanese planes. Houston was targeted by four torpedo bombers, three of which were shot down but one managed to score a hit on the cruiser in the engine room, knocking out propulsive power to the ship. Houston was towed away from the battle area along with the cruiser Canberra. They came under a second torpedo bomber attack on the 16 Oct while still under tow. One of the enemy bombers hit Houston directly on the stern, causing flooding in the ship's scout plane hanger. Despite this, the ship was able to remain afloat with excellent damage control and returned to the States for repairs. Houston would receive three battle stars for her service in WWII and was scrapped in 1959. was sailing with TF 38 east of the San Bernardino Strait on the night of 3 November 1944 when she was targeted by Japanese submarine I-41. Reno was hit on her port side by two torpedoes, one of which was a dud. The other warhead detonated four decks below topside, killing 46 men and wounding several others. The ship lost all power and had to be towed over 1,500 miles to Ulithi where she received sufficient repairs to power herself home. She earned three battle stars for her WWII service. Destroyer (DD) =Wilkes class= was acting as a high-speed transport ferrying vital supplies and reinforcements to Guadalcanal when at 01:00 on 5 September 1942, Little and her sister ship Gregory encountered three Japanese destroyers of the \\"Tokyo Express\\". Although outnumbered and outgunned, the small old ship opened fire on the enemy ships until hit by a barrage of shells which set Little ablaze, and caused her to quickly sink. Many of Little's crew were strafed in the water. Four of her crew were killed and 57 missing. was acting as a high-speed transport ferrying supplies to Guadalcanal along with her sister ship Little when at 01:00 on 5 September 1942, the two ships encountered three Japanese destroyers. At the outset of the engagement, a friendly Navy plane dropped flares that illuminated the two American ships in the black darkness. Both ships were on fire and sinking within a few minutes. The Japanese then fired upon the men in the water, many of whom spent several days in shark-infested waters. 11 of Gregory's crew were killed. was acting as a high-speed transport ferrying vital supplies to Guadalcanal when on 30 Aug 1942 while offloading near Kukum Point she was attacked by Japanese dive bombers. The enemy planes were obscured by cloud cover and managed to score numerous hits along the length of the ship. Colhoun was abandoned and sank taking the lives of 51 men. 18 men were wounded in the attack. was acting as a high-speed transport ferrying reinforcements to Guadalcanal when on 17 November 1942 while approaching Empress Augusta Bay, she was attacked by a G4M torpedo bomber. At 03:50 the planes torpedo hit the ship's starboard side, detonating the aft magazine and rupturing fuel oil tanks. McKean was engulfed in raging fire aft of the first smoke stack and sinking by the stern when order to abandon was given at 03:55. The ship went down by 04:18 after several more explosions, taking 64 of her crew and 52 Marines with her. was operating off Okinawa on 27 April 1945 when at 22:00 a lone kamikaze targeted the Rathburne. Despite the ships anti- aircraft fire and evasive maneuvering the plane hit the port side on the water line starting fires and flooding several compartments. Luckily none of Rathburne's crew was hurt in the attack. Damage control was able to save the ship. She would be scrapped after the war. was acting as a high speed transport conducting operations off Leyte when on 7 December 1944 (three years to the day after firing America's first shot in anger of WWII), Ward was attacked by a kamikaze which crashed amidships knocking out power and starting blazing fires. The crew was unable to contain the fires and abandoned ship. Ward would be sunk by gunfire from escorting destroyers. was conducting operations off Okinawa when during the night of 2 April 1945 her group of transports was attacked by a large force of kamikazes. One plane approached in a low glide before striking the base of the bridge and igniting intense fires. Nearly at the same moment; another plane struck the ship's forecastle, tearing a huge hole across the deck. Despite the valiant efforts of her crew, the ship was abandoned with a loss of 54 men killed. Dickerson's hulk was towed to a nearby base where it was later sunk after a brief salvage and recovery of the dead. was part of a sub hunting task force when during a storm on 24 December 1943 at 01:58 she was hit by a torpedo from U-275 on the starboard side. The explosion killed every man in the after engine room and was unable to move in the rough seas. As the ship was being abandoned, Leary was hit by two additional torpedoes which quickly put the ship beneath the waves. 98 of her crew was lost with Leary. was conducting minesweeping operations off Lingayen Gulf when on 7 January 1945 around 15:45 she stuck a mine that knocked out a turbine and she left her formation to make repairs. While making repairs; at 18:40 an enemy twin engine bomber dropped two bombs that scored on Palmer's portside. The ship became engulfed in billowing flames and within a few minutes the crew abandoned the ship. Palmer sank within six minutes, taking 28 men with her and leaving 38 wounded. =Clemson class= was conducting minesweeping operations in Lingayen Gulf on 6 January 1945 when she was attacked by kamikazes in the afternoon. A suicide plane crashed into her stacks; wounding six men, and ricocheted off into the seas causing minor damage. The ship was repaired and continued operating the next day. was sailing with a minesweeper group on 7 January 1945 in Lingayen Gulf when the US ships were attacked by kamikazes. One plane flying low on the water dropped its torpedo and slammed into the ship's starboard quarter after being set ablaze. The instant the plane hit, the planes torpedo struck the ship on the starboard side knocking out all power. The crew abandoned the ship which later broke in two halves. 48 men were killed, 24 of the dead were survivors from other destroyers sunk in the previous days. was conducting minesweeping operations in the Lingayen Gulf on 6 January 1945 when a \\"Zero\\" kamikaze crashed into get portside, below the bridge about 1 ft above the water line. The crew feared the magazine would explode and abandoned ship. It would be struck by another kamikaze later that day, in the same spot the first plane had hit. The resulting explosion broke Long in half. One of her men died and 35 were wounded. was hunting German U-boat \\"U‚Äê405\\" on 1 November 1943 when the submarine surfaced and the vessels engaged each other with gunfire. Borie rammed the U-boat but a wave lifted the ships bow on top of the submarine. The two ships struggled to break free from each other while exchanging small arms fire, but the Borie took major damage to her hull, flooding her forward engine room. was responding to distress calls from USS Pecos near Java on 1 Mar 1942 when she stumbled upon Kido Butai; Japan's fast carrier force escorted by two battleships. Although Edsall brazenly fired her torpedoes and main battery at the enemy ships, she was soon struck by dive bombers and hit by large-caliber naval gunfire. The ship rolled over and sank around 17:31. Although some of her survivors were picked up by the Japanese, not a single man from Edsall would survive the war. was en route to Bali on 19 February 1942, leading a column of Allied ships when they were engaged by Japanese destroyers in the Battle of Badung Strait causing extensive damage. The ship made it to a floating drydock at Surabaya but was abandoned by her crew and left behind after the ship fell over off its keel blocks into 12 feet of water. Surabaya would fall to the Japanese, who would raise the Stewart and commission the ship into the IJN. The ship would survive the war to be returned to the US Navy, and later sunk as a target. was escorting the severely damaged British cruiser Exeter on 1 March 1942, when a Japanese task force of heavy cruisers broke up the rescue effort. Pope sought refuge in a rain squall but was soon spotted by enemy aircraft. A near-miss by dive bombers caused flooding which prompted the crew to abandon ship just as the Japanese cruisers closed for the kill. Most of Pope's crew would endure more than 60 hours in open sea, before spending years in POW camps. was moored at Cavite, Philippines, when she was struck on her superstructure by a high-level bomber which killed 8 men on 10 December 1941. On 19 February 1942, Peary was attacked by dive bombers during the Bombing of Darwin. She was hit five times by bombs which detonated her magazines, started flooding and caused her to sink. 88 of her crew went down with her. was attempting to rendezvous with friendly forces near Java on 2 Mar 1942 when at she was engaged in a night action with the Japanese heavy cruisers Takao and Atago. The ship was sunk with all hands; 116 men were lost. was acting as escort on 18 Feb 1942 off St. Lawrence, Newfoundland when at 04:10 she ran aground amid a storm and immediately broke in half. The extremely violent and freezing seas took the lives of 110 of her crew, 46 were rescued. was hit by a kamikaze on 6 January 1945 in Lingayen Gulf, which struck her port side, starting fires and causing flooding. 3 men were killed and 11 were wounded. The ship was towed back to the states and decommissioned. was operating off Okinawa on 26 March 1945 when the ship was hit by a kamikaze in her galley deckhouse which killed 1 man and wounded 3 more. The ship made temporary repairs and remained on station until 9 April 1945. Gilmer would resume her duties by early July. was operating near Guadalcanal as a tender and transport when on 19 Oct 1942 she was attacked by 9 dive bombers. The ship took a direct hit on her stern, disabling the ship's steering, and killed 11 men. Another 12 were wounded. The ship's crew made temporary repairs while moored at Florida Island and proceeded to Espiritu Santo, and finally back to Pearl Harbor by 29 December 1942. was escorting a convoy off Key West, Florida on 26 April 1942, when the ship unknowingly sailed into an American minefield. The ship struck several mines within minutes and broke into three sections. 15 of her crew were killed in the sinking. was acting as escort for British convoys as a part of the Neutrality Patrol when on 23 October 1941 around daybreak the ship was hit by a torpedo fired from U-552, which was aiming for a cargo vessel. The torpedo hit the ship's bow, causing a magazine explosion that blew off the bow away from the ship. The aft section of the ship sank five minutes later, taking 100 men down with her; 44 were rescued from the sea. was on patrol off Okinawa on 25 May when she was attacked by two kamikazes off Okinawa. One attacker was shot down, but the second plowed into the ship below the bridge. 28 men were wounded. The ship was abandoned but did not sink. A skeleton crew determined the damage was too extensive to repair the ship, so all useful equipment was removed and Barry was towed to be used a decoy. The Japanese took the bait and sank the ship along with its escort (LSM-59) on 21 June 1945. was covering the landings at Lingayen Gulf and Luzon when on 11 January 1945 she was attacked by a kamikaze which struck the ship in the number two stack. The explosion killed 38 men and wounded 49; including members of the Navy's UDTs, and knocked out the ship's engines. The ship was towed to the Admiralty Islands and made enough repairs to sail to the west coast. was supporting operations in Buna as a high speed transport named SS Masaya when on 28 March 1943 she was attacked by five dive bombers, 6 miles off Oro Bay. Dale was hit at least three times and sank at 13:13. 11 of her crew were killed and 4 others wounded. was acting as a high speed transport ferrying supplies to Guadalcanal when on 25 October 1942; Zane and her fellow ship were engaged by Japanese destroyers in Ironbottom Sound in a running battle as Zane and Trever attempted to flee. Zane took a direct hit on the ship's forward battery, killing 3 men, but maintained course until the Japanese ships gave up the chase after an hour. Zane was repaired and continued her service until scrapping after the war. was conducting minesweeping operations off near Anguar on 13 September when the ship struck a second mine in the last 30 hours. However, unlike the first time, the ship was severely damaged. Her engines lost all steam, and a significant list prompted the order to abandon ship only two minutes after the explosion. Perry broke in half and sank, but fortunately none of her crew was lost. was anchored off Darwin, Australia on 19 Feb 1942 when over 240 Japanese aircraft bombed the area in a massive air strike. While attempting to make open sea; William B Preston was struck by a bomb aft near the deckhouse near the living area disabling steering. The ship was able to use its engines to steer itself away from the destruction that wrecked Darwin. 11 of her crew were killed during the engagement. William B Preston would finish the war as a tender and occasional transport. =Farragut class= was supporting the Mindoro landings when on 18 December 1944, her fleet was hit by a hurricane type storm dubbed Typhoon Cobra. Despite the best efforts of her crew, the Hull was not prepared handle the intensity of the storm and after several minutes she rolled onto her side and did not return, being swallowed by the heavy sea. 62 of the ships crew were rescued, unfortunately 202 were lost with the ship. was participating in the [landings at Amchitka] when she was caught in a strong current which pushed the ship into shape edged rocks, which opened her hull and knocked out all power. An attempt to tow the ship failed in the rough seas and the Worden began to break-up, prompting the crew to abandon ship. 13 of her crew would drown in the wintry sea. was supporting the Mindoro landings when on 18 December 1944 her fleet was hit by Typhoon Cobra. The ship had been waiting to refuel and was not prepared to ride out the storm. The ship rolled back and forth in the intense heavy seas until a huge wall of water hammered the vessel, capsizing over to starboard. All except for 6 of Monaghan's crew perished in the sinking, the survivors clinging to rafts for several days, 256 of her men were gone. =Porter class= was sailing as a part of TF16 during the Battle of Santa Cruz on 26 October 1942. During the action, she attempted to come to the aid of a downed TBF Avenger which had crashed nearby, when she was struck amidships in the forward engine room by a torpedo, most likely from the downed Avenger. 15 men were killed and 5 other men were wounded. After all the survivors were picked up the Porter was scuttled by USS Shaw. was attempting to intercept Japanese destroyer transports which were evacuating troops from Vella Lavella. The two task groups engaged each other at 23:00 on 6 October 1943 with gunfire and torpedoes. Selfridge attacked the enemy ships on her own after the O'Bannon and the Chevalier collided during the engagement. A torpedo struck Selfridge on her bow, nearly severing the hull of the ship forward of the bridge. 49 of Selfridge's crew were lost and 11 more men were wounded. The ship would have its bow replaced and she would return to action by May 1944. =Mahan class= was covering landings near Ormoc Bay on Leyte's west side on 7 December 1944 when a group of Japanese kamikazes attacked. Although several of the enemy planes were downed, three planes managed to strike the Mahan. Two planes hit the ship's waterline on both sides of the ship near the Number Two 5-imch gun. A third plane crashed just aft of the bridge. Despite valiant efforts of her crew to save the ship, the fires were out of control and ignited the forward magazine. After the survivors were taken off, Mahan was scuttled with torpedoes; the crew lost 6 men and 31 wounded. was operating in the Philippines near San Pedro Bay when on 7 December 1944 she was attacked by strafing Japanese planes. One of these planes, a \\"Val\\", made a suicide run that struck the Draytons No. One five-inch gun. Six men were killed and another 12 of her crew were wounded in the attack, but Drayton was able to complete her escort mission and return to New Guinea for repairs. was operating picket duty near Ormoc Bay on 7 December 1944 when she was approached by a low-flying kamikaze off her starboard quarter. The ship was unable to train its main guns onto the target, and the plane crashed into the ship, starting a huge fire. The fires were deemed to be out of control and the crew abandoned ship. However, firefighting continued by nearby rescue tug ATR-31 and eventually all fires were extinguished. The ship was towed to San Pedro and would be repaired. Four of her men were killed and 17 wounded. was escorting ammunition resupply convoys headed for Ormoc Bay on 11 December 1944 when at 1700, as many as 12 Japanese aircraft targeted Reid for destruction. In less than a minute, Reid shot down three planes but was struck by four kamikaze's one after another on her port side in several locations. The last plane to hit set off the ship's aft magazines which tore the Reid apart. The ship rolled to starboard and sank at 1702, taking 103 of her crew with her. was in drydock on keel blocks in Pearl Harbor when on the morning of 7 December 1941 the base was attacked by a huge Japanese airstrike. A bomb had struck the Downes which was alongside the Cassin in drydock and started uncontrollable fires. The inferno spread to Cassin and the ship slipped from its keel blocks and rested against Downes. Both ships had their equipment salvaged and installed on all new ships rebuilt with their hull numbers. The Cassin would return to service by April 1944. was in floating drydock at Pearl Harbor when on the morning of 7 December 1941 the base was attacked by a huge Japanese airstrike. The Shaw was singled out by dive bombers during the second wave and hit with three bombs on the forward part of the ship. Firefighting was abandoned at 0925 and five minutes later the forward magazines exploded, wrecking the bow of the ship. Shaw would be repaired, her bow rebuilt and amazingly would return to service by August 1942 to an illustrious career. was escorting a cargo ship into Espiritu Santo on 4 August 1942 when as she was heading in through the western entrance, the ship struck a friendly mine. The explosion killed three of her crew, and broke the ship in half. Most of the crew was rescued and the two halves of the ship sank separately. It would later be determined Tucker's captain had not been notified there would be mines in his ship's path. was in drydock next to Cassin at Pearl Harbor on the morning of 7 December 1941 when the base was attacked by a huge Japanese airstrike. During the second wave of the attack, a dive bomber hit Downes with a 250kg bomb which ruptured the ship's fuel tanks and started a raging fire. The drydock was flooded to prevent the fires from spreading but Cassin fell off her keel blocks and rested against Downes. Both ships had their salvageable equipment removed and installed on brand new hulls. Downes would return to service by March 1943. was sailing with TF 64 en route to intercept a Japanese fleet making for the marine held airbase on Guadalcanal on the night of 13 November 1942. The two fleets met in pitch- black darkness at 0145 and a wild close range gun fight erupted. Cushing was engaged by up to three Japanese destroyers at ranges closer than 3,000 yards. The ship was hit numerous hits in rapid succession and lost power through the fight. The ship continued to fight as best it could and launched several torpedoes at a nearby enemy battleship but fires, loss of power, and exploding ammunition prompted the order to abandon ship at 0230. The ships burning hulk stayed afloat until 1700 that afternoon before it finally sank. 70 men of Cushing's crew were lost. had been operating as part of the New Guinea campaign in the fall of 1943 when on 28 November 1943 she sailed from Milne Bay for Buna. At 0200 on the 29th, she was accidentally rammed by Australian troopship Dundroon amidships on her portside. The ship split in half and sank 2 miles off Ipoteto Island; nine of her men were killed, another man seriously wounded. Her commanding officers were found to be at fault for the accident. was escorting aircraft carrier during the Battle of Santa Cruz when a damaged B5N \\"Kate\\" torpedo bomber made a suicide dive on the small destroyer. The plane smashed into the ship's forecastle with a large explosion; its torpedo detonated a few minutes later, causing more casualties. Despite the billowing flames, the ship's crew was able to put out the fires (with help from the wake of USS South Dakota) by late afternoon, and all guns remained operational. Fifty-seven of her crew were killed, and 12 more wounded. Smith would be repaired and returned to service in February 1943. was sailing with TF 64 on 14 November 1942 en route to intercept a Japanese fleet making for the Marine- held airbase on Guadalcanal. The two fleets engaged each other around 23:15. During the battle, several of the American destroyers bunched together, making easier targets for the Japanese. Preston was hit by numerous heavy shells from Nagara that knocked out her firerooms and started large fires which better illuminated Preston for her enemies to see. The ship rapidly took hits from all sides, and by 12:36 she was ordered abandoned. The ship rolled over and sank ten minutes later, taking 116 crew with her. =Somers class= was sailing from Norfolk to Trinidad Island when on 12 September 1944; the crew was warned that they were sailing straight towards a massive hurricane. The ship made it through the night, but by early morning the storm grew in intensity, and began to severely hamper the Warrington. Water rushed through the ship's vents and knocked out all power. Warrington's crew tried desperately to save their ship but it was apparent the Warrington was taking too much water and would have to be abandoned. The ship sank at 12:50 leaving her crew stranded in the fierce storm. After several days of searching, only 73 of the ships 321 crew were rescued. =Bagley class= was patrolling Ironbottom Sound on the night of 22 Aug 1942 when she picked up the Japanese destroyer Kawakaze on her radar. At that moment a torpedo struck the Blue on her stern nearly blowing it off completely. 9 men were killed and 21 wounded. Over the next 24 hours, attempts were made to tow the ship but after these efforts failed she was scuttled. was covering the 7 Aug 1942 landings on Guadalcanal when at 1320, a large Japanese airstrike attempted to disrupt the landings. Mugford was targeted by several dive bombers who managed to land a 250kg bomb on the stern of the destroyer causing minimal damage. 18 men were killed and another 17 wounded. The ship would remain on station through September 1942. While patrolling the Surigao Strait on the afternoon of 5 December 1944, a lone \\"Val\\" kamikaze managed to slip past her antiaircraft fire and struck the Mugford on her portside. 8 men were killed and 16 wounded. The ship temporarily lost power and had to be towed away until she was able to extinguish fires and proceed under her own power back to the states for repairs. The ship returned to service in March 1945. was on patrol off Savo Island during the night of 7-8 Aug 1942 when at 0215 a Japanese heavy cruiser appeared out of the darkness. The two ships exchanged fire; Ralph Talbot was hit four times which killed 12 men and wounded several more. Ralph Talbot limped away with her bridge on fire and listing heavily to starboard. The crew was able to save their ship and sufficiently patch up to make for major repairs stateside. By January 1943 she was back fighting the war. On the evening of 27 April, Ralph Talbot was screening off Hagushi when two kamikazes attacked her at 2040. One struck her starboard side aft and the other crashed close aboard. The ship began to flood, but was quickly brought under control and the ship headed to Kerama Retto for repairs. Her casualties were 5 dead and 9 wounded.R.Rielly \\"Kamikaze Attacks of World War II \\" 2011; p. 249 was conducting an offensive sweep off \\"Finshafen\\" with two other destroyers on 3 October 1943 when her captain ordered evasive maneuvers to avoid two submarine torpedoes headed for the ship. Henley dodged the first two warheads, but a third torpedo struck the ship on her portside; exploded in her boiler rooms, and broke her keel which nearly halved the ship in two. The crew abandoned their destroyer and were rescued by her fellow tin cans. 15 men went down with Henley. was patrolling with two heavy cruisers south of Savo Island in 9 Aug 1942 when at 0145 she ran head-on into a Japanese task force of 5 heavy cruisers, 2 light cruisers, and a destroyer. After sending by radio and signal lamp: \\"Warning! Warning! Strange ships entering the harbor!\\" Patterson fired star shells and engaged the enemy warships, but was quickly hit by several five-inch shells that knocked out No.4 gun and damaged No.3 gun. 10 men were killed and 8 were wounded. The ship made repairs and remained in action. On 30 September 1943 while engaging Japanese barges in New Georgia Sound (\\"The Slot\\"), a damaged friendly destroyer attempting to rejoin the formation collided with Patterson, nearly breaking off the ship's bow forward of the No.1 gun, which eventually did separate. Three men were killed and 10 were wounded in the accident. The ship had to have a false bow installed for its trip stateside for repairs. The Patterson rejoined the war in March 1944. was defending the Guadalcanal landings on 8 Aug 1942 when 26 Japanese bombers attacked at 1200. Jarvis maneuvered between the enemy planes and the cruiser USS Vincennes when she was struck by an aerial torpedo on her starboard side which knocked out all power and killed 14 of her crew and wounded 7. The ship made sufficient repairs to make for Sydney, Australia during the night to have immediate work done on her 50-foot gash in her side. Her wounded were transferred off at Tulagi before she left. While leaving the Guadalcanal area on 9 August 1942, at 0130 she steamed right past a Japanese task force on their way to meet the Americans near Savo Island. It is unclear if Jarvis crew were aware of the enemy ships, but the Japanese considered an escaping cruiser. The next day while the Jarvis was slowly steaming towards Australia down by the bow, with no radio and few working guns; she was pounced on by 31 Japanese planes. The Japanese recorded that Jarvis \\"split and sank\\" at 1300 on 9 August 1942. Of her 223 crew remaining on board, not a single man survived. =Benham class= was operating with TF 64 on the night of 14-15 November 1942 near Guadalcanal; on course to intercept a Japanese task force headed to bombard Henderson Field. The two sides engaged in combat just before midnight. At 0038, Benham took a torpedo hit off her bow, possibly from the Japanese destroyer Ayanami. The blast carried away the bow of the ship forward of the bridge causing Benham to retreat from the battle. Although she suffered no casualties during the fight, the ship was severely damaged and the crew gave up efforts to save her. Benham would be scuttled by . was conducting anti- aircraft duties off Palermo, Italy on 26 May 1943 when she was attacked by German dive bombers. A near-miss landed just a yard off the port bow which ruptured the hull and flooded the engineering space of the ship. 5 men were killed and another 18 wounded. Despite the serious damage to the ship, her crew was able to save the Mayrant and make it back to a safe port. The ship would return to service in May 1944. was assisting the landings in the Gulf of Salerno on 10 September 1942 when her convoy of ships was attacked by German E-boats shortly after midnight. As Rowan turned to have all her guns engage the enemy, she was struck by a torpedo. Rowan sank in less than a minute, taking 202 of her crew down with her. 71 of her men were rescued. was operating with TF 67 on the night of 13 November 1942, which was heading to meet a Japanese surface task force head-on just off Guadalcanal. The two sides met with one another in the pitch-black night at 0130 and quickly the battle became a frenzied shootout. Sterett was hit numerous times by Japanese battleship Hiei causing extensive damage all over the ship, starting fires and flooding compartments. Despite the hellish conditions her crew toiled to save their ship, and maintained fire on the enemy ships, sinking the Japanese destroyer Harusame. 28 of her crew were killed in the battle, and another 13 seriously wounded. Sterett remained afloat and was able to depart the battle area for emergency repairs. She would rejoin the war on 10 February 1943. On 9 April 1945 while on picket duty off Okinawa, Sterett was attacked by five kamikazes. The crew shot down the first three, but the fourth plane to come in struck the starboard waterline. All power was lost, steering was knocked out and her main guns frozen in place. Two of her men were wounded, but the veteran crew was able to quickly restore power and got the ship underway again to for repairs.R.Rielly \\"Kqamikaze Attacks of World War II\\" 2011; p. 226 was on patrol off Kerama Retto on 16 April 1945 when she observed two Japanese aircraft and took them under fire. One made a run on her and was shot down 75 yards to starboard, ricocheted off the water and hit Wilson in her 40 mm gun tub. It then spun across the deck and landed in the water on the portside. Its 220-lb bomb penetrated the ship, but only the booster charge went off, causing slight damage. It was removed intact from the ship a couple of days later. Wilson had five dead and three wounded in the attack, but the damage was minimal. She was repaired and back in action within a few days.R.Rielly \\"Kamikaze Attacks of World War II\\" 2011; p. 236 =Sims class= was escorting the fleet oiler during the Battle of Coral Sea on 7 May 1942 when the two ships were sighted by a Japanese search plane. The pilot identified the destroyer and oiler as a cruiser and carrier, respectively. A large group of Japanese bombers soon appeared at 09:30 and circled the two American ships searching for the reported carrier but settled on the Sims and Neosho when their fuel ran low. The Sims was hit by three 250kg bombs, two of which exploded in the engine room. In minutes the ship buckled amidships and began to sink stern first. As she went down, Sims exploded, killing many of her men in the water. Of a crew of 192, only 16 men were rescued. was operating off the southern tip of Leyte on 10 December 1944, when she was attacked by a G4M \\"Betty\\" kamikaze which crashed into the ship causing severe damage. The ship's engine room and much of her machinery was demolished. Hughes crew suffered 2 men killed and 21 wounded. She was towed to San Pedro Bay where temporary repairs enabled her to travel stateside. After extensive repairs, Hughes rejoined the war on 4 June 1945. was participating in a diversionary bombardment of Wotje during the Marshall Islands campaign on 30 January 1944 when during the bombardment the ship was hit by a shell fired from a shore battery. The shell hit the Combat Information Center on board; killing six and wounding 14 others. The damage was minimal and Anderson remained on station. On 1 November 1944 while on patrol near Panaon Island, Anderson was attacked by a Ki-43 \\"Oscar\\" which dove at her at 1812. Despite being hit by 20mm and 40mm shells, the plane got through, caught its right wing tip on the ship's stack and hit the ship's portside. Burning gasoline covered the deck area of the crash and the boilers were put out of commission by the impact. The fires were out by 1855; afterwards Anderson counted 16 dead and 20 wounded. was assisting in the effort to save the USS \\"Yorktown\\" (CV-5) on 6 June 1942. Hammann was alongside the stricken carrier transferring damage control parties when after 1200, Japanese submarine I-168 successfully penetrated the screen of protecting destroyers and fired a spread of four torpedoes. One of the torpedoes hit Hammann amidships, breaking her in half. The ship's two halves sank; bow first, within four minutes. After the stern went under, Hammann's depth charges exploded in a violent underwater explosion, killing many more men in the water. 80 of her crew went down with the Hammann. was escorting a convoy of troop transports in company with on 15 September 1942 when the American ships were targeted by Japanese submarine I-19. A spread of six torpedoes was fired which sank the Wasp, and damaged battleship North Carolina. O'Brien evaded one torpedo and was then struck by a second on her port bow. Damage at first did not seem significant and the ship made full power. However, the damage to the ship would haunt the crew despite the repairs they attempted to make at Espiritu Santo. The ship departed for San Francisco for more extensive repairs on 10 October. As she made headway the ship gradually leaked more water. By Oct 18 the crew started jettisoning topside weight to attempt to save the ship, but it became clear the O'Brien would have to make the nearest port. At 0600 on 19 Oct the ship started to come apart prompting the crew to abandon ship except for a small salvage team, who also left the ship 30 minutes later. By 0800 O'Brien slipped beneath the sea after traveling 3,000 miles with torpedo damage, fortunately none of her crew were lost. was sailing with TF 64 on the night of 14-15 November 1942 when around 2330 the American ships engaged a Japanese task force south of Savo Island. Walke was engaging Japanese ships with her main battery when at 0039 the ship was shaken by a tremendous explosion from a torpedo on her starboard side. Additionally, she took a salvo of hits from a nearby enemy cruiser starting catastrophic fires and flooding. The crew was ordered to abandon the fast-sinking ship. Walke's stern was the last part of the ship to sink underwater; as it did several depth charges exploded, killing and wounding several men left in the water. After two encounters with enemy vessels who luckily left without firing, 151 survivors were rescued in the morning by USS \\"Meade\\" (DD-602). Seventy-two men went down with the Walke in her final battle, and 6 more survivors died of their wounds. was operating off Okinawa and Kerama Retto on 6 April 1945 when at 1811 she was targeted by a B5N \\"Kate\\" kamikaze. Despite taking several hits, the flaming plane continued on to crash into the ship on the portside between the No.1 and No.2 five-inch guns. Fires quickly spread and it took over two hours to extinguish them. The Morris suffered 13 dead, 45 wounded.R. Rielly \\"Kamikaze Attacks of World War II\\" 2011; p. 214 The ship's steering was damaged and her bow was demolished, but temporary repairs allowed the Morris to cross the Pacific to San Francisco. The ship was declared neither seaworthy or habitable and was not repaired. was on patrol off Salerno on the night of 9 October 1943 when just after midnight; German submarine U-616 ambushed the destroyer with possibly two torpedo strikes on her forward starboard side. The Buck flooded quickly and sank within four minutes. As the ship sank, her depth charges which had been set to safety detonated causing a severe underwater explosion that killed and wounded many sailors in the water. 95 men were killed when Buck sank. =Benson class= was assisting Allied troops landing at Anzio on 24 January 1944 when at 20:01 the ship struck a mine on her starboard side. 7 men were killed and 25 were wounded by the explosion which almost broke the ship in two.

Mayo required some four months of repairs before she returned to service. was escorting a convoy off the coast of Algeria during the night of 20 April 1944 when the convoy came under concentrated attacks by Luftwaffe bombers. The , steaming ahead of Lansdale, was struck by a torpedo at 21:00 and exploded in an enormous fireball, killing all 580 on board, as well as illuminating all nearby ships in the darkness. Lansdale was attacked on two sides and while turning to avoid torpedoes, she was struck by another on her opposite side by a daring Ju-88 which was shot down as it passed a few feet above the ship. Lansdale was nearly split in two and started listing to port. After hanging on for another ten minutes and continuing to fire at attacking enemy planes, the Captain decided it was time to abandon ship. The destroyer broke in half and quickly sank, taking 47 men down with her. 147 of her crew (and two Germans) were rescued from the water. was operating with TF 67 on the night of 13-14 November 1942 off Guadalcanal when at 0148, combat was initiated with a Japanese force including two battleships, and fourteen destroyers. During the action in a pitch-black night, the two sides of ships mixed, firing on friend and foe alike. Laffey nearly collided with Japanese battleship Hiei, missing the behemoth by 20 feet and then raked the bridge and superstructure of the battleship at point-blank range. Unfortunately, Hiei was able to hit Laffey with its 14-inch guns, causing massive damage to the little destroyer. At the same time Laffey was struck by a torpedo on her fantail. As her crew started to abandon ship, Laffey was ripped apart by a violent explosion and quickly sank with 59 of her crew killed and 116 wounded. was steaming with a task force on the night of 11-12 October 1942 on course to intercept Japanese shipping runs to Guadalcanal. In the ensuring Battle of Cape Esperance, Farenholt was hit by shells below the waterline from both Japanese and American guns causing concerning flooding. The crew shifted weight topside so the ship listed far enough to raise the holes out of the water. 3 men were killed and 43 wounded on Farenholt. After lengthy repairs, she returned to service in March 1943. On 25 February 1944 Farenholt's destroyer squadron made a hit and run bombardment of Japanese facilities and positions on Kavieng. The Japanese responded with a heavy counterfire from shore batteries which holed the Farenholt at the waterline. Fortunately, there were no casualties and the ship's experienced crew quickly brought the flooding under control. was operating with TF 8 on 27 March 1943 attempting to prevent a Japanese convoy from resupplying troops in the Aleutians Islands.

The Nelson returned to duty in November 1944. was on radar picket duty off Okinawa on 16 April 1945 when at 0958 she was attacked by two \\"Val's\\" off her starboard beam. The first was shot down but the second plane, although afire and shedding large pieces, continued to come in. The plane crashed just short of its target in the water, showering debris and water over the ship, however, its bomb exploded underwater; tearing a huge gash into the side of the Harding. The ship began to quickly flood and listed severely to port. She was able to make it make to Kerama Retto under her own power, suffering 22 dead and 10 seriously wounded. Harding would be repaired but missed the end of the war. was performing radar picket duty off Okinawa on 25 May 1945 when she was attacked by a kamikaze. The enemy bogey took fire and missed crashing into the ship but the planes bomb detonated underneath the Butler in the water, damaging her keel and killing 14 men. All steam and electric power was temporarily lost when the forward fire room was flooded. The battleship USS West Virginia provided cover for the Butler while the crew worked to get power working again. The ship was able to make Kerama Retto for temporary patch-ups and eventually back to the states for permanent repairs, arriving 26 Aug 45. was acting as escort to the cruiser on the night of 4 Aug when she was attacked by Italian bombers. The enemy planes scored a direct hit amidships which caused flooding and knocked out all power. 9 crewmen were killed and 20 wounded. The Shubrick was towed to Malta and was able to make the US for permanent repairs on only one screw. After repairs and an overhaul, Shubrick was transferred to the Pacific theater. On 29 May 1945 while performing radar picket duty, she was attacked by two kamikazes at 0010, one of which was shot down. The other plane slammed into the starboard side, its 550lb bomb blasting a 30-foot hole into the side of the ship. The fires set off ammunition and the depth charges, which amazingly put most of the fires out. 35 crewmen had been killed and another 25 wounded. Shubrick was towed back to Kerama Retto for repairs and made it back to the US by 10 August. was performing convoy escort duty in the Mediterranean off the coast of Algeria during the evening of 6 November 1943 when her group of ships came under air attack from Luftwaffe aircraft. While observing attacks on near-by ships, the crew of Beatty spotted an incoming Junkers Ju88 coming in low on the water. Although the ship fired on the enemy plane, it came within 500 yards and dropped a torpedo which struck the ship on her portside. The ship's back was broken by the explosion along with the loss of power, and a 12-degree list. Although the crew battled valiantly to save their ship, Beatty could not be saved and broke in two halves, sinking at 2305. 12 of her crew were killed and 6 seriously wounded. was anchored not far from Ambrose Light on 3 January 1944 after a series of trips escorting convoys across the Atlantic when suddenly at 0650, several internal explosions in her ammunition storage area began to wreck the destroyer. The explosions continued to stagger the Turner until 0750 when a large violent explosion ripped the ship apart. She rolled over and sunk minutes afterwards, the tip of her bow bobbing in the water until 0827. 138 crewmen went down with Turner. =Fletcher class= was bombarding Japanese strongholds defending Manila Bay on 14 February 1945, when Fletcher was hit by Japanese shore batteries at Los Cochinos Point which killed eight and wounded three crewmen. Damage was minimal and fires were extinguished; Fletcher would remain on station continuing bombardment until the 17th when she would make for minor repairs and continued her prestigious career. was operating off Luzon in Mariveles Bay on 14 February 1945, maneuvering to take the mined destroyer in tow when the Radford itself struck a mine. The explosion killed three of the ship's crew. Repairs would send the Radford back stateside and would not return to the war zone. was escorting the torpedoed cruiser on their way out of the combat area near Rennell Island on 30 January 1943, when a wave of Japanese G4M \\"Betty\\" torpedo bombers attacked the American ships. Although several were shot down, at least six bombers were able to launch their warheads. La Vallette was hit by one torpedo in her forward engine room, causing severe damage; 22 men were killed. La Vallette was taken in tow by the tugboat Navajo to Espiritu Santo for temporary repairs, then traveled to Mare Island Navy Yard. She rejoined the fleet on 6 August 1943. On 14 February 1945 while operating off Luzon in Mariveles Bay, the La Vallette struck a mine that seriously damaged the ship and required her to be towed. Six men were killed and twenty-three wounded. The ship was repaired and sent home to San, Diego, California, where she was decommissioned after the war. was operating with two other destroyers attempting to make a surprise interception of nine Japanese destroyers which were evacuating troops from Vella Lavella on 6 October 1943. After opening fire and throwing the Japanese ships into disarray, the Americans continued on course to bear all guns and torpedoes on the enemy. Unfortunately, their course took them into the path of a salvo of Japanese torpedoes, one of which struck Chevalier. Everything forward of the bridge was blown away from the ship by the explosion, and she was accidentally rammed from behind by the O'Bannon. Before giving the order to abandon ship, the crew of Chevalier fired a torpedo at a nearby Japanese destroyer, which exploded and sank soon afterwards. It was clear the ship could not be saved by 23:26, so the crew abandoned the Chevalier and was picked up by O'Bannon's boats. Fifty-four men went down with her, and another thirty-six were seriously wounded. was conducting anti- shipping operations between Kolombangara and Choiseul on the night of 1 October 1943 when she was attacked by Japanese bombers that hit her with several bombs. Two crewmen were killed and eleven were wounded by the attacks. Damage was minimal and the ship remained on duty in the South Pacific. On 29 November 1944, Saufley was performing anti-submarine patrols at the entrance to Leyte Gulf when she was hit by a kamikaze causing considerable hull damage and killing one man. The ship would make repairs in the Admiralty Islands then rejoin the fleet in time for the Invasion of Lingayen Gulf. was operating with TF 18 on 5 July 1943 supporting landings on New Georgia in the Kula Gulf by bombarding Japanese positions near Barioko Harbor. Strong and Nicholas entered the harbor at 0030 and began shelling when ten minutes later, Strong was hit by a torpedo on her portside aft. The damage was clearly severe enough to prompt the captain of Chevalier to ram Strong to give the crew of Strong an escape route from their sinking ship. As Japanese shells from shore began to come in, Strong was left to sink, breaking in half before going down. Forty- six members of her crew were lost with the ship, but luckily two hundred forty one were saved. The torpedo which sank Strong was fired by Japanese destroyers from over 11 miles (20 km) away, believed to be the longest torpedo strike in history. was escorting landing craft near Guadalcanal on 1 February 1943 when her group was attacked by six Japanese planes. Three of the attackers were shot down, but the planes all released bombs together, scoring at least three hits and possibly three near misses. One of the bombs hit the bridge, killing the ship's commanding officer. The De Haven settled rapidly and sank two miles east of Savo Island, taking 167 lives of her crew down with her. Another thirty-four were seriously wounded. was performing radar picket duty off Okinawa on 13 May 1945 when thirteen Japanese aircraft attacked the area Bache was stationed. One plane made a run on the ship; its right wing hitting the No.2 smoke stack spinning the plane around into the deck amidships. Its bomb exploded just before impact with the deck causing extensive casualties and fires. All power and steam was lost and the ship had to be towed back to Kerama Retto. Forty-one of her crew were killed and thirty-six wounded. was performing close support operations off Okinawa on 27 April 1945 when the ship was attacked by a Japanese suicide boat. The fast, nimble little boat managed to sneak into the formation and detonated a charge alongside the hull of the Hutchins. A violent explosion rocked the ship, causing severe structural damage, but fortunately there were no casualties. Damage control was able to check flooding and the Hutchins retried to make repairs at Kerama Retto and eventually the states. was escorting a resupply convoy to Mindoro on 30 December 1944 when she was targeted by a kamikaze. The enemy plane crashed into the ships superstructure and a 40 mm gun mount. Eleven men were killed and another twenty seriously wounded in the attack. Pringle would be repaired and back in service by February 1945. On 16 April 1945, Pringle was performing radar picket duty with and two gunboats off Okinawa when a small group of kamikazes attacked at 0910. After shooting down several planes coming at her, a single D3A \\"Val\\" crashed into the destroyer's bridge superstructure just abaft of the forward stack. The plane's bomb detonated in a violent explosion that buckled the Pringles keel and effectively broke the ship in two. The ship quickly sank in less than six minutes, taking forty-seven crewmen down with her. was performing radar picket duty off Okinawa on 12 April 1945 when she was targeted by two MXY-7 Ohka rocket-powered kamikaze gliders. The first suicide rocket hit the starboard bow at speeds in excess of , but luckily the warhead punched through and exited out the portside of the ship, leaving a huge hole but only minor damage. A second Ohka (or \\"Baka Bomb\\" as the Americans called it) came in but missed the ship, taking off the Stanly's ensign as it went by before disintegrating in the ocean. Three crewmen had been wounded by the attack, but fortunately nobody was killed on board Stanly. was supporting landing operations on the Treasury Islands on 27 October 1943 when she came under attack from several Japanese dive bombers. Despite putting up a fierce storm of anti aircraft fire downing four planes in the process; Cony was suffered at least two hits on the main deck that killed eight and wounded ten. Damage was extensive enough to require a tow to Florida Island and finally on her own to the states. Cony returned to duty by March 1944. was performing anti-submarine patrols near the entrance to Leyte Gulf on 29 November 1944 when at 1750 she was targeted by six \\"Oscar's\\". One of the attacking planes made it through the hailstorm of defensive fire and struck the bridge with its wing and spiraled into the No.2 five-inch gun starting several fires. Thirty-two men had been killed and sixty-four wounded, but the ship was able to make it to San Pedro Bay, then the states for repairs.

Antun Mavrak (1899-1938) was a Croatian revolutionary and top functionary of the Communist Party of Yugoslavia (KPJ). Mavrak was named as organizational secretary of the underground KPJ in August 1930 and remained in that leading post until his removal in December 1931. Although expelled from the Communist Party, Mavrak continued to live in the Soviet Union under the name Karl Yakovlevich, working as a laborer. Mavrak was arrested during the Terror of 1937-38 and was executed as an alleged spy in 1938. Mavrak was posthumously rehabilitated by the Soviet government in 1963. Biography =Early years= Antun Mavrak was born in 1899 in Bosnia, then part of the Austro-Hungarian Empire to an ethnic Croatian family.Branko Lazitch with Milorad M. Drachkovitch (eds.), Biographical Dictionary of the Comintern. New, Revised, and Expanded Edition. Stanford, CA: Hoover Institution Press, 1986; pg. 309. Following completion of his secondary education, Mavrak enrolled at the University of Zagreb, where he studied law. =Political career= Mavrak joined the Communist Party of Yugoslavia (KPJ) in 1924, soon coming to play a leading role in that organization. He was named secretary of the regional committee for Croatia in 1928 and was named a member of the party's delegation to the 6th World Congress of the Comintern held in Moscow that same year. Mavrak's political activity as a member of the illegal Communist Party brought him to the attention of the Yugoslav police, who forced him to flee to Vienna, Austria to avoid arrest shortly after his return from Moscow. The Austrian government in turn sought Mavrak's removal and he was expelled from Vienna, landing in Paris, where he headed the organization of exiled Yugoslav Communists in France. By the end of 1929 the leftist leaders of the Communist Party of Yugoslavia Filip Filipoviƒá and J. Martinoviƒá were the focus of severe criticism in Moscow.Geoffrey Swain, \\"Wreckage or Recovery: A Tale of Two Parties,\\" in Matthew Worley (ed.), In Search of Revolution: International Communist Parties in the Third Period. Palgrave- Macmillan, 2004; pg. 131. At issue was a perceived tendency of the underground Yugoslav party towards putschism at the expense of factory organization, with the first half of 1929 marked by a series of gun battles between KPJ insurgents and the police as party radicals vainly attempted to ignite a mass \\"armed uprising\\" via isolated street fighting. Moreover, sectarian infighting further destabilized the Yugoslav party organization as the ascendent ultra- revolutionary left wing moved towards \\"purging the party of all opportunist renegades.\\"Swain, \\"Wreckage or Recovery,\\" pg. 132. With the KPJ shattered by their tactics and the inevitable reprisals of the Yugoslav government, the Comintern sought a new leadership to bring the factional war revolutionary posturing to an end and to set about rebuilding the organization. In August 1930, Mavrak was called to Moscow and was there named the new organizational secretary of the Communist Party of Yugoslavia. A new focus was made on the organization of underground trade unions, while those seeking an immediate insurrection through armed battles were dismissed as terrorists in the party press.Swain, \\"Wreckage or Recovery,\\" pp. 133-134. Mavrak proved a poor choice as a party leader, however, failing to appeal to the dominant left wing of the KPJ and alienating a large section of the party faithful by attempting to end publication of the party theoretical magazine Klasna borba (Class Struggle) as a \\"waste of time.\\"Swain, \\"Wreckage or Recovery,\\" pg. 134. On December 7, 1931, top officials of the KPJ met with relevant Comintern officials to determine a new leadership for the Yugoslav party, with Filip Filipoviƒá returned for a second stint as the leader of the party organization. Antun Mavrak's career as a top Communist Party official was thus essentially brought to a close. =Final years= Anton Mavrak was expelled from the Communist Party of Yugoslavia by Comintern decision in April 1932. He continued to live in the Soviet Union following his expulsion, assuming the new name Karl Yakovlevich, working in Rostov and Moscow as a laborer. Mavrak was arrested early in 1938 as part of the secret police frenzy which swept the USSR ‚Äî a mass anti- espionage campaign with xenophobic overtones in which former Communist dissidents were especially hard hit. Mavrak was tried along with fellow KPJ leaders Karlo ≈†tajner and Filip Filipoviƒá and was executed immediately thereafter.Karlo ≈†tajner, Ruka iz groba (A Hand from the Grave). Zagreb: Globus, 1985; pg. 40. The Soviet government posthumously rehabilitated Mavrak in 1963, thereby essentially admitting that the charges made against him during the terror of 1937-38 were without basis.

In it, Mizuki describes his experiences as a soldier participating in the New Guinea campaign during World War II. He portrays the final weeks of his infantry service as the soldiers were instructed to die for their country to avoid the dishonor of survival. The manga was first published in Kodansha magazine Sh≈´kan Gendai in 1973, based on Mizuki's work of 1970. After being translated and published by Drawn and Quarterly in 2011, Onward Towards Our Noble Deaths has been well received by English-speaking critics. It also received awards in France and in the United States, and was adapted into a television drama in 2007 by Japanese broadcaster NHK. Overview Shigeru Mizuki is a Japanese manga artist who is best known for his y≈çkai (Japanese folklore monsters)-themed manga, especially GeGeGe no Kitar≈ç. Mizuki enjoyed writing about the monsters' histories, which a local woman related to him; however in 1942, at the age of 21, Mizuki was drafted into the Imperial Japanese Army. He was sent to Rabaul, a city on New Britain island in Papua New Guinea, where his comrades died and Mizuki lost his left arm. Based on these experiences, Mizuki wrote Onward Towards Our Noble Deaths, containing \\"90 percent fact\\". Fictionalizing himself as private Maruyama, Mizuki tells the story by combining drawings with photographs. Release Shigeru Mizuki wrote and illustrated S≈çin Gyokusai Seyo!, which was first published in the August 1973 issue of Sh≈´kan Gendai. In the same year, Kodansha released it in tank≈çbon format with the subtitle . In July 1985, Holp Shuppan published the work, and Kodansha re-released it on June 15, 1995. Ohzora Publishing released the manga on August 9, 2007, as , and on July 30, 2010, as . It was released under the konbini comic format by Shueisha on August 11, 2007, and on August 16, 2008. At the 2010 San Diego Comic-Con International, comic book publisher Drawn and Quarterly announced it had acquired the manga's publishing rights and would release it in North America under the title Onward Towards Our Noble Deaths. The company released the manga in May 2011; it was the first manga by Mizuki published in English. The Drawn and Quarterly edition was 368 pages and had an introduction written by manga commentator Frederik L. Schodt, as well as an interview with Mizuki. The publisher chose the work because they thought it was \\"an excellent introduction\\" to Mizuki's work, and because \\"readers have knowledge of and thus can relate to on a certain level\\". Reception and legacy Onward Towards Our Noble Deaths has been critically acclaimed. At the 2009 Angoul√™me International Comics Festival, the manga won the Prize for Inheritance. In 2012, it was nominated for a Harvey Award in the Best American Edition of Foreign Material category. It was selected for the Eisner Award in the categories Best U.S. Edition of International MaterialAsia and Best Reality-Based Work, winning the former at the Comic-Con. According to a compilation by Deb Aoki of About.com, Onward Towards Our Noble Deaths was considered the best new manga of 2011 because it was included in 18 critics lists of best comics/graphic novels. Aoki said the manga is \\"dense with details, and filled with pathos, humor and horror\\". Pastes Garrett Martin wrote that the \\"realistic depictions of normal men trapped in a horrible situation\\" makes Onward Towards Our Noble Deaths \\"brutally honest\\". Brigid Alverson of MTV Geek said, \\"this is not an easy story to read, but its historical importance and the lessons it holds for the future are undeniable\\". Noel Murray writing in The A.V. Club said the manga's artwork is \\"detailed, often beautiful illustrations of small Pacific islands with characters rendered far less elaborately\\". Karen Green of Comixology wrote that the \\"story is so human and its message so powerful\\" and that is a good book to eliminate the preconceptions American may have of the Japanese Army that are frequently propagated by Hollywood. Among others, Library Journal, Dan Kois and Glen Weldon of NPR, Comic Book Resources, Ed Sizemore of Manga Worth Reading, and Publishers Weekly included it on their lists of best comic books of 2011. Further, in 2014, Joe Gross of the Rolling Stone qualified it as the 46th \\"Best Non-Superhero Graphic Novel\\" of all time. David Maine wrote for PopMatters that \\"there is little here to criticize. Perhaps some of the transitions are a bit abrupt, [and] maybe some of the characterization could be sharper.\\" Similarly, Sean Michael Robinson of The Comics Journal said Onward Towards Our Noble Deaths for its theme \\"as well as its many strengths and virtues, it is a very difficult book to criticize\\". Robinson's critics was that it has \\"loosely characterized\\" characters and that its art \\"can also be a stumbling block\\". He said the art is \\"problematic\\", is \\"the hand-off‚Äîwhen characters suddenly leap modes, bouncy and expressive one moment, and photo- rendered and flat the next\\". Tom Spurgeon, writing for The Comics Reporter, said he had difficulty \\"in not being able to easily track which soldiers are which at any one point in the book\\". =Television adaptation= On August 12, 2007, NHK General TV broadcast , a Japanese television drama based on Onward Towards Our Noble Deaths. It was written by Takuya Nishioka and produced by Tsuyoshi Yanagawa, and starred Teruyuki Kagawa as Shigeru Mizuki. On July 16, 2008, Pony Canyon released the drama in DVD format. The Agency for Cultural Affairs awarded it the Excellence Prize for a television drama during the National Arts Festival. The drama was awarded the Excellence Prize for television program at the 45th Galaxy Awards by the Japan Council for Better Television and Radio. At the 34th Hoso Bunka Foundation Awards, Onward Towards Our Noble Deaths won the awards for Best Television Drama, Best Actor (Kagawa), and Best Production (Yanagawa).

Biography Nicholson was born in Clifton, Gloucestershire, England, the youngest son of Rev. Mark Nicholson and his wife Lucy, n√©e Elcock. He had five sons and two daughters with his cousin with whom he married, Elizabeth Cobham. This was a political move, as Cobham's mother was sister-in-law to Georgiana McCrae, G. W. Cole, and Dr. D. J. Thomas. This allowed Nicholson to become better connected with other people of power and influence during the early years when the Port Phillip District was just forming. In 1848 Superintendent La Trobe requested Nicholson, in an arrangement that would be shared with Thomas Manifold and Henry Foster, to become justices of the peace. Warrnambool was relatively young and thus needed those who had more influence in the Magistrates' Court at Belfast (Port Fairy). Furthermore, a bishop named knew Foster and Nicholson to be prominent churchmen. As such, they were requested to conduct services in the township until Dr. Beamish became the incumbent in 1850. In 1853, Nicholson was elected to represent Belfast and Warrnambool in the Victorian Legislative Council, without his knowing. The nomination was likely filed out of familiarity, as Nicholson had family connections; G. W. Cole, J. Graham, and W. C. Haines were fellow members in the council. He successfully moved for a survey of the ports of Belfast and Warrnambool. He was also responsible for the motion to provide funds in 1854 for a museum of natural history, now the National Museum of Victoria. He resigned in 1854 in order to return to England to educate his children. Colonial Australia Nicholson arrived in the Port Phillip District in June 1840 aboard the Duchess of Kent. Superintendent Charles La Trobe asked Nicholson, Thomas Manifold and Henry Foster to become justices of the peace in Warrnambool in 1848. On 7 June 1853 Nicholson was elected to the unicameral Victorian Legislative Council for Belfast and Warrnambool. Nicholson held this position until May 1854. Nicholson died in Warrnambool on 27 October 1889, he married his cousin, Elizabeth Harvie Cobham in 1845.

She was incarcerated with other Japanese Americans during World War II and during this period was exposed to the Quaker values of peace advocacy and nonviolent conflict resolution by Friends working in camp. After the war, she joined several groups in Seattle working for peace, racial equality, and open housing, and became an award-winning elementary school teacher in the Seattle Public Schools system during her 25-year tenure with the district. She is the namesake of a middle school, a low-income housing community and a peace garden in Seattle, and the local chapter of the Japanese American Citizens League awards the Aki Kurose Memorial Scholarship each year. Early life Born Akiko Kato in Seattle on February 11, 1925, Kurose was the third of four children. Her parents had immigrated separately ‚Äì her father Harutoshi arriving from Miyagi prefecture seeking work, her mother Murako from Kumamoto to study ‚Äì and met through mutual friends in Berkeley, California.Nomura, Gail M. \\"Peace Empowers: The Testimony of Aki Kurose, a Woman of Color in the Pacific Northwest,\\" Frontiers: A Journal of Women Studies, 22:3 (2001), pp75-92. They moved to Seattle soon after marrying and leased an apartment building which Murako managed while Harutoshi took a job as a porter at Union Station. (The Katos were unable to purchase the property due to alien land laws which kept Asian immigrants, prohibited by law from naturalized citizenship, from owning land or real estate in Washington.) From an early age, Kurose was encouraged to think outside expected gender roles by her parents' egalitarian and nontraditional relationship: Her mother obtained an engineer's license, operated the boiler room and furnace, and performed general maintenance around the building, while her father would bake jelly rolls every Friday evening for get-togethers with friends and neighbors. Kurose lived and went to school with a diverse group of children from her working-class neighborhood in Seattle's Central District. Pushed together by red-lining and restrictive covenants that kept most of the city's neighborhoods off limits to Jews and people of color, the Katos frequently hosted African American, Chinese American and Jewish neighbors at social gatherings in their apartment, and Kurose and her friends \\"went in and out of each other's homes all the time\\".Densho Digital Archive, \\"Akiko Kurose Interview,\\" Part I, 17 July 1997. Her parents placed little emphasis on traditional Japanese values and cultural ties, and unlike many other Nisei at the time, she and her siblings attended Japanese language school only once a week instead of each day after their regular classes. Kurose instead spent her free time engaged with the Girl Scouts and her high school band and drama club. World War II The December 7, 1941, attack on Pearl Harbor came during Kurose's senior year at Garfield High School in Seattle, Washington. She later recalled brushing off her father's worries of trouble, unconcerned as she and her siblings were American citizens ‚Äì but at school the next day, she was reminded of her \\"Japaneseness\\" and unequal status when a teacher told her, \\"You people bombed Pearl Harbor.\\" On February 19, 1942, President Franklin Roosevelt issued Executive Order 9066, authorizing military commanders to create zones from which \\"any or all persons may be excluded,\\" and over the next several months approximately 112,000 Japanese Americans were \\"evacuated\\" from the newly established Military Areas 1 and 2. The Katos were removed first to the Puyallup Assembly Center (also known as \\"Camp Harmony\\"), where Aki and her family were assigned a one-room \\"apartment\\" in a barracks on the parking lot of the requisitioned fairgrounds. The family was later transferred to the War Relocation Authority camp at Minidoka, Idaho. Kurose completed her high school education in Minidoka and became involved with the American Friends Service Committee (AFSC), which donated books to the camp schools and helped college-age Nisei obtain leave clearance to enroll in universities outside the exclusion zone. She left camp to attend the University of Utah in Salt Lake City but, after encountering problems with her living situation, she was forced to move and ended up at the LDS Business College instead. Kurose returned briefly to Seattle when the West Coast was reopened to Japanese Americans at the end of the war, but soon moved to Wichita, Kansas, and enrolled at Friends University. She graduated in 1948 and returned to Seattle to marry Junelow (Junks) Kurose, her best friend's brother and her brother's best friend. Junks, recently discharged from the Army, had been living in Chicago, where his parents resettled upon their release from camp, and the couple moved there. Career and activism In 1950, Kurose had their first child (Hugo, named after Junks' older brother, who had been forcibly conscripted into the Japanese army and died in the Pacific Theater of World War II), and the new family moved back to Seattle soon after. The transition was not easy. Discriminatory real estate practices, combined with a shortage of available housing, made it difficult to find a new home, so the family stayed with Kurose's parents until they were able to move into their own place. The local electrical and construction unions would not admit Japanese Americans, so Junks, an electrician, was unable to find work for some time before eventually taking a job as a Boeing machinist. During this time, Kurose worked for an interracial porter's union her father had started upon his return to Seattle. The city's largely Japanese American workforce had been replaced by African Americans during the incarceration, and employers capitalized on tension between the two ethnic groups when former camp inmates began to return and seek out their old jobs. Harutoshi helped organize the union, and Kurose was appointed its secretary. Influenced by the discrimination she and her husband faced during their search for a home, Kurose became involved in the open housing movement in the 1950s, working first with the AFSC and later, in the 1960s, joining the Congress of Racial Equality (CORE). During this time, the Kuroses had five more children; Aki enrolled them at a Seattle Freedom School, and brought them with her to civil rights marches and anti-war demonstrations. Sparking what would become a lifelong passion for education, she began taking classes in early-childhood education and development, started working in preschool programs, and joined a group of neighborhood parents to form the state's first Head Start program in 1965. She began teaching for Seattle Public Schools through Head Start, eventually taking a job at an elementary school in 1974. Two years later, as part of the city's (reluctant and federally-mandated) move to desegregate its public schools, she was transferred from Martin Luther King Jr. Elementary, an urban, predominantly African American school, to the exclusive Laurelhurst Elementary in North Seattle. Her arrival was not welcomed by the parents of the until recently all-white student body, and Kurose was called to a meeting with forty concerned parents to defend her qualifications before she started teaching. (She would later describe the meeting as being \\"on trial\\", and recalled a parent telling her, \\"If you want to bring your rice bowl and chopsticks, it's okay\\".) During her first month, Kurose was monitored in the classroom each day by two parents, but she gradually won over the skeptical Laurelhurst community. When students of color were bused to Laurelhurst from the city's central area beginning in 1978, Kurose worked to ease their integration into the school and push her fellow teachers to promote a multicultural curriculum. Despite the initial resistance to her assignment at Laurelhurst, Kurose eventually became one of its most well-loved and respected teachers, both locally and nationally. In 1980, she was appointed by President Jimmy Carter to the National Advisory Council on the Education of Disadvantaged Children. She continued her own education, enrolling in a University of Washington graduate program in 1981 and receiving a Master of Early Childhood Education degree four years later. In the classroom, she encouraged her students to learn through hands-on experience instead of rote memorization, and she received numerous awards for her innovative teaching style. In 1985, she was named the Seattle Teacher of the Year, and in 1990 she was given the Presidential Award for Excellence in Mathematics and Science Teaching (PAEMST). Her work integrating peace advocacy with education was recognized internationally in 1992, when she received the United Nations Human Rights Award. Legacy Upon her retirement in 1997, Laurelhurst students and parents dedicated the Aki Kurose Peace Garden on the school grounds. Kurose died the following year, on May 24, after a sixteen-year fight with cancer. Aki Kurose Village, a family-friendly affordable housing community in North Seattle, opened in 1999, and in 2000 the Casper W. Sharples Junior High was renamed the Aki Kurose Middle School Academy, the first Seattle school named after an Asian American woman. Additionally, the Seattle JACL created the Aki Kurose Memorial Scholarship after her death, awarded annually to a Seattle Public Schools graduate applying to a Seattle community college or Washington state public university.JACL Seattle, 2014 Aki Kurose Memorial Scholarship application.

Name Augustin Pyramus de Candolle described the species in 1817, from a specimen from the herbarium of Sir Joseph Banks. The species gains its common name from a folk use as a supposed remedy for headaches. The aroma from the crushed leaves is inhaled, appearing to relieve headaches as a result of the highly irritant properties of the resulting fumes. This process was explained by herbalist Cheryll Williams: > The uncomfortable sensation of breathing in the ammonia-like fumes has been > described as \\"the head 'exploding', the eyes 'watering' and intense > irritation of the nasal passages\\" - such that the initial headache was > quickly forgotten. Two varieties are recognised‚ÄîC. glycinoides glycinoides and C. glycinoides submutica. Description Clematis glycinoides is a woody-stemmed vine that can reach long, with simple lanceolate (spear-shaped) to oblong leaves that are long by wide. The cream-white flowers appear from July to December, although these are most abundant in September. The species is dioecious: the plants have either male or female flowers. The seedheads have several feathery 'tails' up to long. Distribution C. glycinoides is found in Queensland, New South Wales, and Victoria. It grows in woodland, forests and rainforests, on basalt, limestone, shale or sandstone soils with good drainage. Open forest species that it grows under include grey myrtle (Backhousia myrtifolia), grey ironbark (Eucalyptus paniculata) and manna gum (E. viminalis), as well as floodplain forest trees such as cabbage gum (Eucalyptus amplifolia) and broad- leaved apple (Angophora subvelutina). Honeybees visit the flowers. C. glycinoides is possibly not as vigorous as other Clematis in cultivation, and requires moist conditions to do well. Its white flowers are considered to be an attractive feature.

Unraced as a two-year-old, she was a Group 3 winner at three when finishing in a dead heat for first place in the Atalanta Stakes. In 2014 she won the Duke of Cambridge Stakes at Royal Ascot, before scoring her first Group One in her next race, the Falmouth Stakes. She went on to record a second Group One success in the Sun Chariot Stakes. In 2015 she failed to win but finished second in the Sun Chariot Stakes and fourth in the Queen Elizabeth II Stakes. Background Integral is a bay filly bred by Cheveley Park Stud and foaled on 13 March 2010. She was sired by Dalakhani, who was named Cartier Horse of the Year in 2003 after wins in the Prix Lupin, Prix du Jockey Club and Prix de l'Arc de Triomphe. As a breeding stallion his offspring have included Conduit, Duncan and Reliable Man. Integral's dam is Echelon, who won a number of Group races over her four-season racing career, including a Group 1 victory in the Matron Stakes in 2007. Echelon's dam Exclusive is a half-sister to the 2000 Guineas winner Entrepreneur. Integral is trained at Newmarket by Sir Michael Stoute. Racing career =2013: three-year-old season= Integral never raced as a two-year-old and started her racing career in a one-mile maiden race at Goodwood on 31 May 2013. Jockey Ryan Moore positioned her behind the leaders, before taking the lead two furlongs from the finish and drawing clear to win by two and three quarter lengths from pre-race favourite Magic of Reality. Her next race was the Distaff Stakes, a Listed race which is run over one mile at Sandown Park. After being at the back of the field for the majority of the race, she made quick progress in the final furlong to take the lead with 100 yards to run, winning the race by one and a half lengths from Light Up My Life. On 3 August, Integral raced in the Nassau Stakes, where she started at the price of 8/1. She was short of racing room over a furlong out and had to be moved out by Moore. She never got on terms with the leaders and finished in seventh place behind winner Winsili. Integral started as the 13/8 favourite for the Atalanta Stakes at the end of August. Moore held her up and was in the last two in the early stages, before moving through the field from three furlongs out to take the lead two out. She was just overtaken by Ladys First with 100 yards to run, but battled back to join her on the line, with the pair finishing in a dead heat for first place, one and three quarter lengths clear of third-placed Shuruq. Integral's final race of 2013 was the Sun Chariot Stakes on 28 September, where she was again held up in the early stages. She began to make headway two furlongs out and was in the lead as the field entered the final furlong, but she was overtaken by Sky Lantern, with about half a furlong to go. Sky Lantern won the race by a length from Integral, who was two lengths ahead of third-placed Duntle. =2014: four- year-old season= Integral started favourite for her reappearance as a four- year-old in the Dahlia Stakes. After being held up at the rear she moved through to challenge the leaders as they entered the final furlong. Esoterique and Integral pulled away from the rest of the field and were neck and neck inside the last 200 yards, but Integral could not quite get to Esoterique, losing by a head. At Royal Ascot, Integral was one of the 14 fillies and mares to line up for the Duke of Cambridge Stakes. Ryan Moore positioned her just behind the leaders in the early stages before quickening to take the lead over a furlong from the finish. She drifted right in the closing stages, but pulled away to win by two lengths from L'Amour De Ma Vie. On 11 July, Integral was ridden by regular jockey Ryan Moore in the Falmouth Stakes. She started the race as the 15/8 favourite and chased leader Sky Lantern in the early stages. Rizeena moved up to join Sky Lantern at the head of the field after three furlongs, with Integral just behind the pair. Sky Lantern began to fade three furlongs from the finish, leaving Rizeena in an outright lead until she was overtaken by Integral over one furlong from the finish. As they entered the final furlong Integral had a two length lead, which she maintained until the finish to win the race, beating runner-up Rizeena by that margin, with Peace Burg a further three quarters of a length behind the runner-up in third place. Integral then traveled to Frances for the Prix Rothschild, where she faced only three opponents. Racing abroad for the first time, she raced in second for much of the race and all four runners were in with a chance with 200 metres to run. Miss France took the lead about 100 metres out, but was soon overtaken by Esoterique, who won the race by three quarters of a length from Miss France, with Integral third and L'Amour De Ma Vie fourth. In October, Integral returned to Newmarket for the Group One Sun Chariot Stakes in which she was one of four 7/2 co-favourites alongside Fintry, Esoterique and Miss France, with Sky Lantern among the other runners. She took the lead from the start and set a steady pace from Esoterique before accelerating in the final quarter mile and winning by a length from Miss France. Integral was matched against colts in the Queen Elizabeth II Stakes at Ascot on 18 October. She started the 9/2 second favourite but never looked likely to win and finished seventh of the eleven runners behind Charm Spirit. =2015: five-year-old season= On her five-year-old debut, Integral finished fourth against male opposition in the Lockinge Stakes and then attempted to repeat her 2014 success in the Duke of Cambridge Stakes. She was made the 8/11 favourite but tired badly in the closing stages and finished fifth of the six runners behind Amazing Maria. After a lengthy break she returned in October for the Sun Chariot Stakes on 3 October. After leading for most of the way she was caught inside the final furlong and beaten half a length by the French-trained Esoterique. Two weeks later she started a 20/1 outsider for the Queen Elizabeth II Stakes in which she was ridden for the first time by Frankie Dettori. She stayed on steadily in the closing stages to finish fourth of the nine runners behind Solow, Belardo and Gabrial. Assessment At the end of 2013, Integral was given an official rating of 115 for her performance in the Sun Chariot Stakes, ranking her as the joint 200th best racehorse in the world.

Although most of the serials are produced in Urdu, an increasing number of them are produced in other Pakistani languages such as Sindhi, Punjabi and Balochi. One of Pakistan's oldest television dramas is the Urdu serial Khuda Ki Basti, which aired in 1969. Pakistani dramas, like serials elsewhere, reflect the country's culture. According to Dr Farooq Sulehria 1970s & 1980 are considered to be golden old days of Pakistani serials. They have helped to attract viewers nationwide to television. The serials are watched in India and are popular in other South Asian countries, including Afghanistan, Bangladesh and Nepal. According to Shailja Kejriwal, an executive at Zee Entertainment Enterprises, Pakistani dramas have a reputation for \\"being slightly classier than the local fare\\" in India.  Origin  Many Pakistani dramas are based on Urdu novels and in the subsequent years after 1969, many authors became television writers such as authors Umera Ahmed and Farhat Ishtiaq; both of whom have written content for digests as well as television serials. In recent years, Pakistani dramas have increasingly begun to tackle social issues that are once considered taboos.  Social impact  Pakistani feminists are usually concerned about depiction of women in Pakistani drama TV serials, they receive many of those with skepticism & reservation. UK based Pakistani feminist Tasneem Ahmar, whose research institute focuses on the women-media relationships, complaints 99.99% of TV drama in Pakistan is misogynist, patriarchal medieval in its depiction and treatment of women issues. Ahmar says there is no doubt that Pakistani Drama TV serials are hugely popular among all strata of Pakistani society, but unfortunately they waste their potential of doing better in projecting progressive values rather than regressive values vis a vis women's depiction & support to equal rights. Popularity outside Pakistan =Middle East= In 2013, the Pakistani drama Humsafar was dubbed into Arabic and broadcast by MBC in the Middle East as Rafeeq-Al-Rooh. The show was immediately successful and, after its first few episodes were broadcast, became the channel's most-watched drama. Before this, Pakistani dramas were not broadcast in the Middle East. After Humasafar, other shows such as Malaal (aired as Hob-Wa-Nadam), Zindagi Gulzar Hai (aired as Asrar Al Hob), Mera Naam Yousuf Hai, Daastan, Kadoorat, Mera Naseeb, Mata-e-Jaan Hai Tu, Noor Bano, Dil-e-Muztar, Khaani, Gul-o- Gulzar, Balaa, Cheekh, Do Bol, Koi Chand Rakh, Aisi Hai Tanhai, and Suno Chanda were also dubbed into Arabic and broadcast by MBC. =India= Dramas such as Deewarein, Waris, and Jungle were popular in India during the 1980s, but the Indian government has imposed a ban on Pakistani television channels in India. In 2009, the Senate of Pakistan's broadcasting division appealed to the Parliament of India to lift the ban. In 2012, India began debating whether to reverse the ban on Pakistani television channels. India assured Pakistan that it would consider a proposal by Pakistani foreign secretary Jalil Abbas Jilani to lift the ban. Zee Entertainment Enterprises (ZEEL) launched an entertainment television channel, Zindagi, on 23 June 2014. The channel aired syndicated television shows from Pakistan, and has been well received. It has been criticized, however, for showing dramas with a smaller number of episodes. To appease viewers, the channel aired Pakistani television shows such as Aunn Zara, Humsafar, Kitni Girhain Baaki Hain, Maat, Meri Zaat Zarra- e-Benishan, Mere Qatil Mere Dildar, Mirat-ul-Uroos, Ullu Baraye Farokht Nahi, Akbari Asghari, Ashk, Azar Ki Ayegi Baraat, Badi Aapa, Behadd, Meray Dard Ko Jo Zuban Miley, Bilqees Kaur, Shehr-e-Zaat, Kadoorat, Mata-e-Jaan Hai Tu, Daagh, Daam, Durr-e-Shehwar, Dil-e-Muztar, Do Qadam Door Thay, Gohar-e-Nayab, Ishq Junoon Deewangi, Ishq Gumshuda, Jab We Wed, Main Abdul Qadir Hoon, Qaid- e-Tanhai, Jackson Heights, Kaash Main Teri Beti Na Hoti, and Zindagi Gulzar Hai. Zindagi Gulzar Hai became so popular that it was re-run one month after it ended its initial run in India. In September 2016, however, Zindagi dropped all Pakistani shows from their line-up. In this way, Zindagi came to its end on television. In July 2020, it was announced that Zindagi will make its comeback digitally and brand will come with its 5 original Web Series including Maan Jogi, Abdullah Pur Ka Devdas, Churails, Aik Jhooti Love Story and Dhoop Ki Deewar. Along with some old and new shows from Zindagi Library. Blockbuster Pakistani Drama Series Baba Jani, Diyar-e-Dil, Mera Naam Yusuf Hai, Mann Mayal, Baaghi, Vasl, Behadd, O Rangreza, Bunty I Love You, Main Abdul Qadir Hoon, Durr-e-Shehwar, Numm, Ullu Baraye Farokht Nahi, Nanhi, Digest Writer, Shehr-e-Zaat, Suno Chanda and many others started to premiere from July 2020 on ZEE5 app with a premium membership. As per research study of Pakistani popular drama conducted by Indian scholar Jyoti Mehra, north Indian audience gets a sense of cultural familiarity which they can relate to while watching Pakistani drama. The study also gives credit to the content of Pakistani dramas for its comparative realism with fast pace with shorter duration and limited number of episodes for its acceptability among Indian audience. =Other countries= Pakistani dramas are shown in Afghanistan, Bangladesh, Nepal. Pakistani television shows are aired on cable television channels in the United Kingdom, Norway, the United States, and Canada, Turkey for the Pakistani diaspora.

The cemetery and the church are both named after the garden parish outside the city walls in front of Aegidien gate. The cemetery, which contains a number of classicising grave markers from the first half of the nineteenth century, was closed in 1864 with the establishment of the Stadtfriedhof Engesohde. Today it forms a park in the middle of inner city Hanover. The graves of Charlotte Buff (inspiration of Goethe's \\"Lotte\\" in The Sorrows of Young Werther), the astronomer Caroline Herschel and the painter Johann Heinrich Ramberg are located here. The Gartenfriedhof lies on Marienstra√üe between Warmb√ºchenstra√üe and Arnswaldtstra√üe.  History  Open Grave of Henriette Juliane Caroline von R√ºling (1756‚Äì1782) (Grave Number 32); c. 1880 The names \\"Gartenfriedhof\\" and \\"Gartenkirche\\" date to the establishment of the parish and its cemetery in the Garden community in the eighteenth century. At the time, the modern ward of S√ºdstadt lay outside the city walls and the Aegidien gate and was used by the \\"Garden folk\\" (Gartenleuten) primarily for growing crops and vegetables for sale in the city of Hanover. Because of their simple homes, called Kates, these farmers were also known as \\"Garden Cossacks\\" (Gartenkosaken, punningly derived from cotter). In 1741, the City of Hanover established the \\"New Churchyard before the Aegidien Gate\\" (Neuen Kirchhof vor dem Aegidientor) for these people. Between 1746 and 1749 a simple aisle church with a fl√®che was built by Johann Paul Heumann as well - later to be known as the Gartenkirche. This was replaced by a new building constructed from 1887 to 1891 by the architect Rudolph Eberhard Hillebrand. At the beginning of the nineteenth century, the Gartenfriedhof was not just used by the Garden folk, but also by townspeople who settled in the nearby Aegidienneustadt from the middle of the eighteenth century: families of officials, soldiers, ministers, professors and councillors, who are commemorated on the stones of the Gartenfriedhof to this day. In their artistic devotion to classicising elements, these grave monuments represent the ethos of the bourgeois class - known in Hann√∂versch as the \\"Hubsche families. The grave monuments of this time, like urns, weeping jugs, the snake eating its own tail (symbolising eternity), the butterfly (transformation), and the extinguished torch are found throughout the Gartenfriedhof in numerous variations. There are also works of art, like the gravestone with acanthus flowers and palmettes designed by Georg Ludwig Friedrich Laves for Charlotte Buff or the four sphinxes pulling Kielmannsegge's stone sarcophagus. Already in the nineteenth century, the Open Grave, subject of numerous horror stories,Landeshauptstadt Hannover, Der Gartenfriedhof (see Bibliography) had developed into an early tourist attractionSee for example this photo from around 1880 and a Hanover landmark.Dirk B√∂ttcher: \\"Ge√∂ffnetes Grab,\\" in Stadtlexikon Hannover, p. 208 Since the 1950s, the Gartenfriedhof has fallen into serious decay, especially the sandstone gravestones and wrought iron fences. Air pollution and also vandalism and the (ongoing) misuse of the Gartenfriedhof as a dog's toilet have contributed to this. Since the old fence was melted down during the Second World War, the former railing of the Kanalbr√ºcke bridge in the Hanoverian suburb of Vinnhorst was recycled as a fence for the cemetery in 1984. Community efforts by various cultural societies finally led to the protection and refurbishment of the space. As a result, a bronze plaque with a map was installed in the entrance area in the mid-1990s by the Hannover- Leineschlo√ü Rotary club, which makes it possible to find the way to the most distinguished surviving tombs. The numbers on this table are the same as those in literature issued by the Parks and Gardens Office (see the bibliography).

The Carlton Complex, covering , began as four separate lightning-caused fires on July 14 in the Methow River valley of Okanogan County: the Cougar Flat, French Creek, Gold Hike, and Stokes fires. These fires merged and rapidly spread southeast on July 17, burning approximately 300 homes in and around the towns of Pateros and Malott as well as in more rural areas. The communities of Brewster, Carlton, and Methow were also threatened by fire. Power was lost to the communities of Twisp and Winthrop. Road closures included State Route 20 east of Twisp towards Loup Loup Pass, State Route 153 between Twisp and Pateros, and U.S. Route 97 between Pateros and Brewster. Rain slowed the fire on July 24, allowing crews to reach 60% containment by July 26. A new fire started along State Route 20 south of Winthrop on August 1. The Carlton Complex was the largest wildfire in Washington state's recorded history, surpassing the 1902 Yacolt Burn. One death, caused by a heart attack, has been blamed on the fire. Fire fighting efforts included nearly 3,000 personnel and numerous aircraft, including seven UH-60 Black Hawk helicopters from the Washington National Guard and a DC-10 Air Tanker. =Chiwaukum Creek fire= Located northwest of Leavenworth in the Chiwaukum Mountains, this fire burned .

It was one of the deadliest battles up-to-date in the war between fighters of the militant group and government troops. Battle On the evening of 16 July 2014, ISIS gathered a small force of 100 veteran militants equipped with small arms and pick-up trucks and launched an assault on the Shaer field, located in the desert region of Palmyra in Homs province. The field was defended by about 400 SAA troops and NDF militia, equipped with tanks and artillery and backed up by on-call air support from the nearby Shayrat Airbase. The attack started with a suicide bombing via VBIED, followed by assaults on Army checkpoints. After 12 hours of fighting, the militants captured all eight military checkpoints and secured the gas field. A total of 363 SAA troops and NDF militiamen present at the start of the attack were killed, wounded, or captured, with only 30 managing to escape to the nearby Hajjar field. Days later, it was reported that some of the military officers committed betrayal at the start of the attack.Ongoing clashes for 48 hours for the Shaer gas field After the raid, ISIS posted online a video purportedly showing two rocket launchers and two tanks that they captured and the bodies of 50 people lying in an open desert space, many apparently executed. It was determined 270 people on the government side, including 11 civilian workers, were killed, with at least 200 of them executed after being captured. Another 200‚Äì250 government fighters and workers remained captured or missing,Clashes have been going on 48 hours in the Shaer gas field while 21‚Äì27 ISIS militants were killed. Government supporters branded the killings of the POWs as a \\"massacre\\" and the pro-opposition Syrian Observatory for Human Rights condemned the killings with the SOHR director stating: \\"The Observatory condemns summary execution as a war crime, regardless of which side it is committed by in the Syrian conflict. Summary execution is a war crime ‚Äî whether of civilians or combatants. They are prisoners of war and must not be executed.\\" Soon after, the military launched an attempt to recapture the gas field, which included air strikes. The next day, Syrian special forces joined the battle as government troops recaptured parts of the Shaer field. 11‚Äì20 soldiers and 30‚Äì40 ISIS fighters were killed during the day's clashes. On 19 July, government aircraft withdrew from the field due to heavy militant fire from 23-mm heavy machine guns, while the fighting settled into hit-and-run attacks after government forces managed to recapture large areas of the gas field but were still trying to take control of the surrounding areas. Later, it was reported 60‚Äì65 soldiers were killed during the day, ether by friendly fire airstrikes or in fighting against ISIS.The killing of 65 of the regime's forces in Shaer gas field On 20 July, government forces pushed ISIS out of the gas field and secured it, while fighting continued on its outskirts. According to another source, the Islamic State was still in control of the gas field, despite efforts of the Army. The next day, new government reinforcements arrived at Tiyas airbase, east of Homs city,6 barrel bombs on Nawa and continuing clashes at Shaer gas field. while more fighting left six soldiers dead. On 26 July, the Army secured the gas field, as well as the surrounding hills. The capture of the field came after ISIS forces retreated. According to the military, this was achieved due to a \\"precise operation in which dozens of terrorists were killed.\\" The ISIS itself claimed they retreated after destroying the field's equipment and capturing at least 15 tanks and dozens of rockets which were used to guard the field, thus achieving their goal. An ISIS spokesman characterized the battle as a successful raid: \\"We pulled out because it was no longer good for us to stay. The goal was to get the tanks and rockets present at the field and we did. There is no point in staying there and becoming an easy target for the regime and its warplanes.\\" Aftermath In late October, ISIS once again attacked the gas field and after three days of fighting captured the field,ISIS gain control in Shaer gas field, and regime forces torture 12 men to death in Homs.

Particularly in Norway, which unlike Denmark had no significant nobility from the 17th century and which formally abolished nobility in 1821, the aristocracy of officials filled the vacant position at the top of society at the local, regional and national levels. This social group, principally constituted by priests, lawyers and doctors, has with reference to the 19th century also been called \\"the thousand academic families\\" by the historian Jens Arup Seip, and they comprised less than one per thousand in the overall population. By the 19th century Norway is widely considered to have been a \\"Civil Servant State,\\" reflecting the role of the civil servants as \\"the most enduring, consistent and visible elite.\\" History A higher official (embedsmand) in Denmark and Norway was by definition an official who had been appointed by the King. They included not only higher central government officials, but also all priests of the state church, all judges, lawyers (until the mid 19th century), county governors, university professors, and other groups. This class is also frequently referred to as the estate of the officials (embedsstanden or embedsmandsstanden with different spellings), although the officials did never formally constitute an estate of the realm in the legal sense (with the exception of the clergy, who until the 19th century de jure formed one of the two privileged estates, although the estates had de facto lost much of their importance with the introduction of absolute monarchy in 1660). The term \\"aristocracy of officials\\" appears to have entered usage in the early 19th century.See for example C. Molbech, \\"Nogle Yttringer om Aristokratie og Adelstand,\\" Historisk Tidsskrift Vol. 3 p. 175, 1842 The \\"aristocracy of officials\\" was distinct from the nobility (adel). Some members of the class of officials were noble, while the vast majority were not. In Norway, \\"what little was left of the Norwegian nobility, which had constituted the elite in the country during the Middle Ages, quickly withered away after 1537.\\"Eliter i Norge i dansketida, Norgeshistorie By 1600 Norway only had about a hundred men considered as nobles, and their number declined to only 30 by 1660. While most European countries were dominated by a noble class, in Norway \\"other social groups came to fill the vacant position at the top of society, burghers and officials.\\" Since the 16th century, offices in Denmark and Norway were also increasingly awarded based on merits and education, leading to the disappearance of the lower nobility as local elites, especially in Norway, as they were very often unable to afford costly university education abroad, and its gradual replacement as an elite by a class of university-educated higher officials, often of Danish or German origin.Lars L√∏berg, Norsk adel, hadde vi det? , Genealogen 2/1998, pp. 29‚Äì32. This development continued with the introduction of absolute and hereditary monarchy in 1660, which significantly weakened the political power of the still influential Danish nobility in favour of the King and the state administration and officials directly subordinate to the King. The kings from the 17th century and later periods tended to increasingly appoint non-nobles to state offices, to which nobles previously had had a monopoly, and noble status in the absolute monarchy came to be seen as mostly symbolic. Norway was different from Denmark in the fact that the Danish nobility still comprised a significant number and were wealthy and at least socially, if not politically, influential, while the nobility as a group was both politically, socially and economically insignificant, and increasingly so, in Norway. Nobility was formally abolished by the Norwegian Parliament in 1821, at which point the nobility comprised only a few families, virtually all of which were recently ennobled or foreign noble families rather than descendants of the original Norwegian nobility. In most rural localities and districts in Norway, the local and regional clergy (such as parish priests and provosts) and the district judge were typically the foremost members of their communities from the 16‚Äì17th centuries and onwards, and in some cases, their offices were in practice semi-hereditary. Very often, the priest's estate was the largest and most prominent farm or estate in any given community. According to Hoffmann, \\"the priests were an important part of the aristocracy of officials.

The firearm is specifically intended for use by seniors, disabled and others with limited hand strength or manual dexterity.  Overview  The gun is intended to be a single-shot weapon held in the palm of the hand with the barrel extending between the fingers. The trigger would be at the top, squeezed by the user's thumb. Carmel stated, \\"I was sitting in my workshop one day, playing around with a T-handled screwdriver. And I was thinking about the recurring problem I have with the seniors I teach, loading cartridges, locking slides and hand weakness‚Ä¶ I was thinking minimalist. If I start with just a cartridge, what is the minimal thing I have to put around it in order to ignite the primer and send this projectile downrange?\\" The T-handled screwdriver made Carmel realize that all he needed was a barrel, a breech, and a short butt or handle.  Classification  In 2008, while the gun was still in development, it was classified as a medical device by the FDA, which would have allowed reimbursements from Medicare if doctors had prescribed the pistol to eligible patients. The classification was overturned on December 8, 2008.

The star was once thought to be a BY Draconis variable with the variable star designation MQ Ser, but has been found not to be. From observations made between 1975 and 1980, Bakos (1983) reported random, small brightness variations with an amplitude of less than 0.03 magnitude, plus three flare events that increased the brightness by 0.1 magnitudes. However, Scarfe (1985) noted that these observations may instead be due to normal observational error. The common proper motion companion, component B, is a magnitude 10.11 star at an angular separation of along a position angle of 35¬∞. It has an estimated orbital period of 3,371 years. According to Hoffleit (1991), if this is a variable star it may account for the observations of Bakos (1983).

They were introduced by . Definition A primitive recursive set function is a function from sets to sets that can be obtained from the following basic functions by repeatedly applying the following rules of substitution and recursion: The basic functions are: *Projection: Pn,m(x1, ..., xn) = xm for 0 ‚â§ m ‚â§ n *Zero: F(x) = 0 *Adjoining an element to a set: F(x, y) = x ‚à™ {y} *Testing membership: C(x, y, u, v) = x if u ‚àà v, and C(x, y, u, v) = y otherwise. The rules for generating new functions by substitution are *F(x, y) = G(x, H(x), y) *F(x, y) = G(H(x), y) where x and y are finite sequences of variables. The rule for generating new functions by recursion is *F(z, x) = G(‚à™u‚ààz F(u, x), z, x) A primitive recursive ordinal function is defined in the same way, except that the initial function F(x, y) = x ‚à™ {y} is replaced by F(x) = x ‚à™ {x} (the successor of x). The primitive recursive ordinal functions are the same as the primitive recursive set functions that map ordinals to ordinals. One can also add more initial functions to obtain a larger class of functions. For example, the ordinal function œâŒ± is not primitive recursive, because the constant function with value œâ (or any other infinite set) is not primitive recursive, so one might want to add this constant function to the initial functions.

Abt and Morrell (1995) gave this star a stellar classification of A6 III, matching an evolved red giant star that has used up its core hydrogen. In contrast, Houk and Swift (1999) classed it A7 IV, which is more in line with an evolving subgiant star that is on its way to becoming a giant.

It is formed from bupropion by the liver enzyme CYP2B6 during first-pass metabolism. With oral bupropion treatment, hydroxybupropion is present in plasma at area under the curve concentrations that are as many as 16‚Äì20 times greater than those of bupropion itself, demonstrating extensive conversion of bupropion into hydroxybupropion in humans. As such, hydroxybupropion is likely to play a very important role in the effects of oral bupropion, which could accurately be thought of as functioning largely as a prodrug to hydroxybupropion. Compared to bupropion, hydroxybupropion is similar in its potency as a norepinephrine reuptake inhibitor (IC50 = 1.7 ŒºM) (and likely also acts as a norepinephrine releasing agent, similarly to bupropion), but is substantially weaker as a dopamine reuptake inhibitor (IC50 = >10 ŒºM). Like bupropion, hydroxybupropion is also a non-competitive antagonist of nACh receptors, such as Œ±4Œ≤2 and Œ±3Œ≤4, but is even more potent in comparison. Pharmacokinetics Bupropion is extensively and rapidly absorbed in the gastrointestinal tract but experiences extensive first pass metabolism rendering its systemic bioavailability limited. Exact bioavailability has yet to be determined given an intravenous form does not exist. Absorption is suggested to be between 80-90%.National Center for Biotechnology Information.

Hydroxybupropion is the most potent of the metabolites. It is formed via the \\"hydroxylation of the tert-butyl group\\" by CYP2B6 and is excreted renally. Cmax vales of hydroxybupropion are 4-7 times that of bupropion, while the exposure to hydroxybupropion is \\"10 fold\\" that of bupropion. Hydroxybupropion's elimination half-life is roughly 20 hours, give or take 5 hours and will reach steady state concentrations within 8 days. Research Although there are patents proposing uses and formulations of this compound, hydroxybuproprion is not currently marketed as a drug in and of itself and is only available for use in non-clinical research. Hydroxybupropion is not a scheduled drug or a controlled substance.orangebook, http://www.deadiversion.usdoj.gov/schedules/orangebook/orangebook.pdf One can access GLP (Good Lab Practice) documents detailing assays/techniques to further research and isolate this drug.VALIDATED ASSAYS FOR HUMAN CYTOCHROME P450 ACTIVITIES, http://dmd.aspetjournals.org/content/32/6/647.full.pdf+html Otherwise, there is little regulatory data available for hydroxybupropion at this time. Moreover, there is little information to suggest hydroxybupropion has an abuse potential. However, it has been studied as a possible therapeutic for alcohol and nicotine abuse as a codrug. There are few clinical trials or toxicology studies assessing hydroxybupropion alone at this time. There are clinical studies which assess hydroxybupropion in conjunction with bupropion suggesting hydroxybupropion to be the primary form of the compound responsible for its clinical efficacy. Also, transdermal delivery of bupropion and hydroxybupropion has been assessed finding bupropion to be the superior candidate given its elevated diffusion rate through skin samples.

Summary  Yoshikawa was born in Sakaide, Kagawa Prefecture. During his enrollment at the University of Tsukuba, he was introduced to the Butoh dance group, Sankai Juku. Over more than thirty-five years, Yoshikawa has been an artistic director for Sankai Juku's music. Yoshikawa has produced music for news programs such as the six- part documentary, The Miracle Planet (Chikyu Dai Kiko) for NHK and for animated television series. In April 2014, Yoshikawa started music production for Baby Steps on the e-Tele anime slot at NHK Educational TV.  History  At three years of age, Yoshikawa started to learn to play the piano. He could listen to music on a hand-turned or electric gramophone imported from the United States by his great-grandfather. Yoshikawa was educated at the Sakaide elementary and lower secondary schools which were associated with the Faculty of Education at Kagawa University. At school, Yoshikawa used a tape recorder to record his piano and guitar compositions and performances. Whilst enrolled at the University of Tsukuba, Yoshikawa met Ushio Amagatsu, who was the organizer of Sankai Juku and a former member of the Kinkan Shonen piano trio. In 1986, Yoshikawa, Takashi Kako, and Yasukazu Sato (Yas Kaz) became the directors of Sankai Juku. Since then, the troupe's work has been performed biennially at the Th√©√¢tre de la Ville, Paris, France. In 2002, Hibiki, Resonance from Far Away won an Olivier award for best new dance production and in 2006, Toki, a Moment in the Weave of Time won the grand prize at the sixth Asahi performing arts awards.

Its function was two-fold: to increase the signal strength of the guitar going into the amplifier, and to increase tones at the high end of the spectrum (a treble booster). The need for a treble booster arose in the mid-1960s as British tube amplifiers such as the Vox AC30 or Marshall JTM45, tended to produce a slightly dark, muddy sound when overdriven, particularly when used with humbucking pickups. A pre-amplifier that also boosted treble proved a solution. Additionally the vintage components in the Rangemaster circuitry could add characteristic distortion and overtones to color the guitar sound, much in the way of the more modern overdrive pedals.  History and description  The Rangemaster Treble Booster was first made in the 1960s by London company Dallas Musical Ltd., incorporated in 1959. It made guitars and amplifiers under different brand names, including Dallas, Shaftesbury, and Rangemaster. The Rangemaster's engineer is unknown. The unit is simple, and consists of a grey metal box with an on/off switch, a potentiometer for the booster setting, and in- and output jacks. It is made to stand on top of an amplifier rather than on the floor. Besides the potentiometer (usually 10k, sometimes 20k) and the on/off switch, the circuitry contains one germanium transistor, four capacitors, three resistors, and a battery. The transistor was a Mullard or unbranded OC44 or Mullard OC71. By the 1980s Treble Boosters had gone out of fashion. How many Rangemaster Treble Boosters were built is unknown. Due to limited supply on the second hand market they are collectible, even if the going rate is only a fraction of what it used to be in the mid-2000s. In Premier Guitar, Kenny Rardin describes his quest for one of the effects, which started with puzzlement over how Eric Clapton and Ritchie Blackmore achieved their tone; he spent years looking for a Rangemaster. Other notable users, whose sound depended heavily on the Rangemaster include Rory Gallagher, Brian May, Tony Iommi, Marc Bolan and Billy Gibbons. Rumours of Eric Clapton having used a Rangemaster during his stint with John Mayall's Blues Breakers have never been confirmed. Photos of the recording sessions of the \\"Blues Breakers With Eric Clapton\\" exist, but a Rangemaster Treble Booster is not visible in any of them. It is assumed the rumours started in the late 1990s when clones of the Rangemaster Treble Booster began to appear.

O. Hollyday (1893-1991) was an American proponent of urban housing renewal. Hollyday graduated from Boys' Latin School of Maryland in 1910 and Johns Hopkins University in 1914. Prior to World War I, he served as the assistant secretary of the Maryland League for National Defense, then served in the Maryland National Guard as a cavalry unit officer. He returned from war and married Louise Este Fisher in 1926. Hollyday started with the Roland Park Company in 1926, leaving in 1932. In 1930, he became the president of the Real Estate Board of Baltimore, followed by the Mortgage Bankers Association of America. During this time he also became chairman of the national title underwriters section of the American Title Association. He also worked as vice president of the Key Realty company from 1932-1935. Hollyday started in the mortgage business with the Washington D.C. based Randall H. Hagner Co. from 1935-1944. In 1936, Hollyday brought in a young future developer, James Rouse, who proposed a FHA mortgage department to back loans in high-risk markets. He would remain a partner in the interest that would become the nationwide mall and land development firm, the Rouse Company. In the last months before WWII, the Citizens Planning and Housing Association was formed by Frances Morton (Froelicher), a Sunday School student of Hollyday. In 1944, Hollyday became the president of the Title Guarantee and Trust Co. He became the chair of the Baltimore Zoning Committee. He formed Fight Blight Inc. to provide FHA-backed loans to property owners who failed to meet the new codes he initiated under the zoning board. Hollyday became the vice president of American Council to Improve Our Neighborhoods (ACTION) in 1951 which marketed public-private housing initiatives as The Baltimore Plan. Despite limited success, the for- profit public-private initiative was taken up by the Eisenhower administration to reduce federal public housing costs. Hollyday was appointed to the head of the Federal Housing Administration from 1953-1954 during the Eisenhower administration. After a year as FHA head, Hollyday was replaced by Albert M. Cole who charged that Hollyday had lost over $75 million in federal housing dollars to \\"fleecing\\" and \\"viciously sharp practices.\\" Over 251 federal loans were given to construction companies far above the actual construction expense. In 1958, former ACTION member James Rouse succeeded Hollyday as head of Guarantee Title. In 1960, the Title Guarantee and Trust Co. merged to become the Maryland Title Guarantee Co. Hollyday retired from the firm as Vice CEO. He would also recommend changes to Baltimore's housing code prior to the Baltimore riot of 1968. Hollyday was a member of many housing industry and banking boards, including the Build America Better Committee of the National Association of Real Estate Boards, chairman of the association's homebuilders and subdividers division, Savings Bank of Baltimore, Loyola Federal Savings and Loan Association, the Hagner Co., the Guilford Realty Co. and James W. Rouse & Co. He was also president of the Fiscal Mortgage Co. and worked for the Roland Park Co., Industrial Bureau of the Board of Trade of Baltimore. He was Vice president of Key Realty Co., to which the James Rouse development Village of Cross Keys was named. Following his federal government work, friends funded a community center in Washington's Adams Morgan neighborhood and named it after Hollyday.
