Background and education Henry de Worms was born on 20 October 1840. His father, Solomon Benedict de Worms (1801‚Äì1882), owned large plantations in Ceylon and was made a Hereditary Baron of the Austrian Empire by Franz Joseph I of Austria (1830‚Äì1916). His mother was Henrietta Samuel. His siblings were Anthony Mayer de Worms (1830‚Äì1864), Ellen Henrietta de Worms (born 1836), and George de Worms, 2nd Baron de Worms (1829‚Äì1902). His paternal grandmother was Sch√∂nche Jeannette Rothschild (1771‚Äì1859), thus his paternal great-grandfather was Mayer Amschel Rothschild (1744‚Äì1812), the founder of the Rothschild banking dynasty. As a result, his paternal great-granduncles were Amschel Mayer Rothschild (1773‚Äì1855), Salomon Mayer von Rothschild (1774‚Äì1855), Nathan Mayer Rothschild (1777‚Äì1836), Carl Mayer von Rothschild (1788‚Äì1855), and James Mayer de Rothschild (1792‚Äì1868). His uncles, who owned plantations in Ceylon with his father, were Maurice Benedict de Worms (1805‚Äì1867) and Gabriel Benedict de Worms (1802‚Äì1881). He was educated at King's College London. He was called to the Bar, Inner Temple, in 1863, and became a fellow of King's College in the same year. Political career de Worms served as Conservative Member of Parliament for Greenwich from 1880 to 1885 and for Liverpool East Toxteth from 1885 to 1895 and held office under Lord Salisbury as Parliamentary Secretary to the Board of Trade from 1886 to 1888 and as Under-Secretary of State for the Colonies from 1888 to 1892. He was also the British Plenipotentiary and President of the Conference on Sugar Bounties in 1888, and later served as a Commissioner for the Patriotic Fund. He was appointed a Privy Counsellor in 1888 and raised to the peerage as Baron Pirbright, of Pirbright in the County of Surrey, in 1895. He was also elected a Fellow of the Royal Society in 1889. His publications include England's Policy in the East, The Earth and its Mechanism, The Austro-Hungarian Empire and Memoirs of Count Beust. Lord Pirbright died in January 1903, aged 62.

She is identified with the morning star and also with the star Alcor which forms a double star with Mizar (identified as Vashista Maharshi) in Ursa Major. Arundhati, though the wife of one of the seven seers, is accorded the same status as the seven seers and is worshipped with them as such. In the Vedic and Puranic literature, she is regarded as the epitome of chastity, conjugal bliss and wifely devotion. In post-Puranic epic poems in Sanskrit and Hindi, she has been described as \\"chaste and revered\\" and with a character that is \\"unblemished, inspiring and worthy of imitation\\". In the Hindu culture, there are several beliefs, practices and traditions centred on Arundhati including a ritual in the marriage ceremony after the Saptapadi, a fast, a belief about imminent death, and a maxim. The name Arundhati, literally in Sanskrit means \\"washed from the rays of the sun\\", Arun; Sun rays, Dhati; Washed. In Hindu scriptures Arundhati's birth and life are mentioned in various Hindu scriptures. The birth of Arundhati is found in the Shiva Purana and Bhagavata Purana. The instruction by Brahma to Arundhati is described in the Uttara Kanda of the Ramcharitmanas. The rivalry between Vishvamitra and Vashista which leads to the death of her hundred sons is described in the Balakanda of Valmiki's Ramayana. The Mahabharata and several Brahmana works describe her sons, including Shakti, and grandson Parashara. Arundhati's meetings with Sita and Rama are mentioned in the Ramayana, Ramcharitmanas and Vinaya Patrika.Rambhadracharya 1994, pp. iii‚Äîvi. Her role in pleading Shiva to marry Parvati is described in the sixth canto of Kumarasambhava of Kalidasa.Kale, pp. 197-199 Life As per the Bhagavata Purana, Arundhati is the eighth among the nine daughters of Kardama and Devahuti. She is the grandmother of Parashara and the great-grandmother of Vyasa. The Shiva Purana describes her as being Sandhya, the mind-born daughter of Brahma, in a previous birth. On the instruction of Vashista, Sandhya pleased Shiva by penance in order to purify herself from passion, and Shiva asked her to jump into Medhatithi's fire. She was then born as Medhatithi's daughter and married Vashista. Some other Puranas describe her as the daughter of Kashyapa and sister of Narada and Parvata, and she was offered in marriage to Vashista by Narada.Garg 1992, pp. 647-648 The Mahabharata describes Arundhati as an ascetic who used to give discourses to even the seven sages. The wife of Agni, Svaha, could, therefore, assume the form of the wives of the other six seers amongst Saptarshi but not that of Arundhati. The epic also narrates how once she pleased Shiva when it did not rain for 12 years and the seven seers were suffering without roots and fruits. Her chastity and service to her husband is mentioned as unparalleled in the Mahabharata. As per the Valmiki Ramayana, she bore a hundred sons, who were all cursed to die by Vishvamitra. She then bore a son named Shakti and later another one named Suyagya, who studied with Rama at Vashista's hermitage. Some sources say she had eight sons including Shakti and Chitraketu. In marriage ritual In traditional Indian astronomy, pair of Mizar and Alcor in constellation Ursa Major is known as Vashista and Arundhati In one of the rituals of a Hindu marriage, the groom shows the bride the double stars of Vashista and Arundhati as an ideal couple, symbolic of marital fulfilment and loyalty. The couples are asked to look up the constellation symbolizing conjugal love and affection. On the second bright day of the lunar month of Chaitra, a fast in her honour is observed in certain regions of India by ladies whose husbands are alive. This fast is observed with the belief that the ladies observing it would not be widowed.Garg 1992, p. 649 Since the Arundhati star is faintly visible, there is a belief that when someone is near death, they can not see the Arundhati star.Apte 2000, p. 51. Due to its faintness, the Arundhati used to be shown in steps, first showing the brighter stars, and then relative to that the faint Arundhati star is directed. The maxim in Sanskrit called the Arundhatƒ´dar≈õananyƒÅya·∏• (IAST: ‡§Ö‡§∞‡•Å‡§®‡•ç‡§ß‡§§‡•Ä‡§¶‡§∞‡•ç‡§∂‡§®‡§®‡•ç‡§Ø‡§æ‡§Ø‡§É), used in the meaning of inferring the unknown from that which is known, is named after Arundhati.Apte 2000, p. 305. In literature The life of Arundhati is described in the eponymous Hindi epic poem Arundhati' composed by Jagadguru Rambhadracharya in 1994.

It is a stylistic designation rather than one based on the laws of kashrut. Generally, kosher-style food does not include meat from forbidden animals, such as pigs and shellfish, and does not contain both meat and milk. In some U.S. states, the use of this term in advertising is illegal as a misleading term under consumer protection laws. Jews who do not keep kosher but wish to restrict themselves to eating \\"traditional style\\" foods, usually not eating forbidden animals or mixing milk and meat, may consider themselves to keep \\"kosher style.\\"  Kashrut law  Some dining establishments, notably delicatessens, serve kosher-style food. This usually means that they serve traditional Ashkenazic Jewish foods, such as bagels with lox, knishes, blintzes, matzo ball soup, and cold cut sandwiches, especially pastrami, corned beef, brisket and beef tongue. Almost always, when a restaurant calls itself kosher style, the food is not actually kosher according to traditional halakhic (Jewish law) standards. The Reuben sandwich, which contains meat and cheese, is not kosher, nor is the Monte Cristo sandwich, made with ham and cheese. Dairy-based desserts such as cheesecake may be offered as complements to a meat dish. However, since fish is pareve (neither meat nor dairy), lox on a bagel spread with cream cheese may be kosher if the lox meets the requirements of kashrut. Several notable restaurants in Lower Manhattan fit into the kosher-style genre, including Katz's Delicatessen and Russ & Daughters. Canter's restaurant in Los Angeles and Montreal's Schwartz's deli also fall into this category. Jews who adhere strictly to the laws of kashrut will not eat at kosher-style establishments. Furthermore, the fact that such establishments appear to be kosher can be deceptive to Jews who are visiting an unfamiliar city and looking for kosher food. Some of these establishments are also open on the Jewish sabbath for business when this is forbidden by halakha. Others may choose to eat at but not consume meat or cheese at such restaurants. In Toronto, several kosher-style restaurants (e.g., Meyers, Shopsy's) now serve pork products, such as bacon, ham, ribs, and sausage, in order to serve a larger number of customers. Some kosher-style hotdog restaurants, such as Max's Famous Hotdogs and The Windmill, use pork as well as beef hot dogs.

She grew up in Germany between World War I and II, where her family faced hardships including her father's death in the 1918 influenza epidemic, severe post-war inflation, and intense anti-Semitic sentiment.Marilyn Bailey Ogilvie and Joy Dorothy Harvey, eds., The Biographical Dictionary of Women in Science: Pioneering Lives From Ancient Times to the Mid-20th Century, 2000. She studied chemistry and zoology in K√∂nigsberg and Berlin before she joined Spemann's laboratory at the University of Freiburg in 1928. She commented on both Spemann's nationalist tendencies and prejudice against women scientists; prejudices she faced as a Jewish woman limited her career options in Germany. Salome started to quietly disagree with Spemann as him and his peers believed adamantly that there was no overlap in genetics and embryonic development. However, it would have not been wise to go against her professor at that time so she kept quiet until later on in her professional career. In 1932 she received her doctorate from the University of Freiburg for her work on the embryological limb development of aquatic salamanders.Gl√ºcksohn, S.: √Ñu√üere Entwicklung der Extremit√§ten und Stadieneinteilung der Larvenperiode von Triton taeniatus Leyd. und von Triton cristatus Laur. Wilhelm Roux' Archiv f. Entwicklungsmechanik d. Organismen. Bd. 125, S. 341-405 In the same year she married the biochemist Rudolph Sch√∂nheimer, with whom she escaped from Nazi Germany in 1933. She went on to become a lecturer at Columbia University in 1936, bringing embryological acumen to Leslie C. Dunn's genetics laboratory, where she remained for 17 years. Gluecksohn-Waelsch attempted to find mutations that affected early development and discover the processes that these genes affected. In 1938, she acquired US citizenship, and after Sch√∂nheimer's death in 1941 she married the neurochemist Heinrich Waelsch in 1943, with whom she had two children. Columbia University's policies would not allow her a faculty position, even after many productive years of research. She left Columbia University in 1953 to commence a professorship in anatomy at the newly founded Albert Einstein College of Medicine (AECOM), where she became a full professor in 1958 and held the chair of molecular genetics from 1963 to 1976. She received emeritus status in 1978, but continued researching actively for many more years, publishing and participating in scientific conferences until the 1990s. She died a month after her 100th birthday in New York City. Scientific career Gluecksohn-Waelsch's scientific career started when L.C. Dunn hired her to his project involving breeding mice with a 'T locus' mutation. She presented her work showing that the T-locus product acted as an inducer of mesoderm and axial development.Gluecksohn-Waelsch worked on the genetics of differentiation, the process by which unspecified cells from a fertilized egg adopt their various specific fates in development. As Gluecksohn-Waelsch combined the embryological expertise she had acquired at Spemann's lab with methods of classical mouse genetics, she is considered the founder of mammalian developmental genetics.Gilbert SF. Induction and the origins of developmental genetics. Dev Biol. 1991;7:181-206. online She co-authored over 100 publications on developmental genetics. Her research showed that mutations in the Brachyury gene of the mouse caused the aberrant development of the posterior portion of the embryo and she traced the effects of this mutant gene to the notochord, which normally patterns the dorsal-ventral axis. From 1968 to 1983 she collaborated with Carl Ferdinand Cori, winner of the 1947 Nobel Prize in Physiology or Medicine. Awards and honors Gluecksohn-Waelsch's scientific work was honored late in life. In 1979, she became a member of the National Academy of Sciences. She was elected a Fellow of the American Academy of Arts and Sciences in 1980. In 1982 the University of Freiburg her with the \\"Goldene Promotion\\", and in 1993 American president Bill Clinton presented her with the National Medal of Science. She became an overseas member of the Royal Society in 1995 and was awarded the Thomas Hunt Morgan Medal for \\"a lifetime contribution to the science of genetics\\" in 1999.

Scientific accomplishments In 1966 Goldreich published a classic paper on the evolution of the moon's orbit and on the orbits of other moons in the solar system. Termed \\"classic\\" by He showed that for each planet there is a certain distance such that moons closer to the planet than that distance maintain an almost constant orbital inclination with respect to the planet's equator (with an orbital precession mostly due to the tidal influence of the planet), whereas moons further away maintain an almost constant orbital inclination with respect to the ecliptic (with precession due mostly to the tidal influence of the sun). The moons in the first category, with the exception of Neptune's moon Triton, orbit near the equatorial plane. He concluded that these moons formed from equatorial accretion disks. But he found that our moon, although it was once inside the critical distance from the earth, never had an equatorial orbit as would be expected from various scenarios for its origin. This is called the lunar inclination problem, to which various solutions have since been proposed. Goldreich and Alar Toomre first described the process of polar wander in a 1969 paper, although evidence of paleomagnetism was not discovered until later. Goldreich collaborated with George Abell to conclude that planetary nebulae evolved from red giant stars, a view that is now widely accepted. In 1979 Goldreich, along with Scott Tremaine predicted that Saturn's F ring was maintained by shepherd moons, a prediction that would be confirmed by observations in 1980. They also predicted that Uranus' rings were held in place by similar shepherd moons, a prediction that was confirmed in 1986. Goldreich, along with Tremaine predicted planetary migration in 1980, which would later be invoked to explain hot jupiters. In 1969, Goldreich published a paper together with William Julian that is now considered a classic work on pulsar magnetospheres. They provided a simple and compelling model for the structure of magnetic fields anchored in a neutron star and showed that these fields can extract the neutron star rotational energy to power electromagnetic emission. Similar considerations were later used to understand the magnetospheres of rotating black holes.

The station served the communities of Heeley, Meersbrook and Lowfield and was situated on the Midland Main Line near London Road on Heeley Bridge, lying between Sheffield Midland station and Millhouses railway station. Plan of Heeley station c.1890 The station opened with the inauguration of the Midland Railway's main line between Chesterfield and Sheffield on 1 February 1870. This new station of 1870 was designed by the company architect John Holloway Sanders. It was built on an embankment between the A61, London Road South and the River Sheaf. During construction both the road and river were diverted to create space for the station and sidings. Railway accident at Heeley station in 1876 (contemporary engraving) On 22 November 1876 an overnight passenger train from London St Pancras to Scotland via Carlisle derailed at Heeley due to a track defect, causing several people to be injured. Initially the station had two platforms but this was increased to four when the line from Sheffield to Dore was widened between 1901 and 1903. Heeley station was the only station on this section of the line that was an elevated station with subway access from below to the platforms. It closed on 10 June 1968 at the same time as Millhouses railway station and all the platform buildings were demolished. The subway is still present although both entrances have been blocked in; the entrance on London Road can be seen and iron railings are present. In July 2017, it was proposed by Local Enterprise Partnership that new stations should be built at Millhouses and Heeley as well as new platforms at Dore & Totley. The plans would be part of a call to have better links in South Yorkshire area as well as plans for a new Woodhead Route reopening.

Its length is between 60 and 180 cm, and it can weigh up to 100 kg. It is sometimes described locally as cod, although that properly refers to other fish.Oxford English Dictionary, 1st ed. \\"cod, n.¬≥\\" Oxford University Press (Oxford), 1891. Description HƒÅpuku are grey in colour with silvery white underbellies, with juveniles generally being blue in colour. They have 10 dorsal spines running along their back, a rounded anal fin and rounded pectoral fins, and a large, powerful, square-shaped tail. Its lower jaw protrudes from the top, and their very large eyes are adapted for hunting and inhabiting low-light conditions.Ocean Hunter Ltd, \\"Hapuku\\" , OceanHunter, n.d.

Habitat and feeding Juveniles are thought to be pelagic, switching to demersal when they are about 50 cm in length. They inhabit temperate and subtropical waters of the southern Indian Ocean and Pacific Ocean, being found in Chile, southeastern Australia and New Zealand. They can be found in waters between 10 m and 800 m deep, but generally prefer waters deeper than 50 m. They are usually found living in cracks, caverns, or caves when found in shallow waters. They are voracious predators, feeding on a large range of other fish species, invertebrates and crustaceans, including red cod and blue cod, hoki, crabs and crayfish.Beentjes, M. P., and Francis, M.

Fishery Bulletin, 1999 97: 227-242. Age and growth HƒÅpuku are a large, slow growing, long-lived species. They reach sexual maturity between 10 and 13 years and have lifespans up to 60 years. They can grow as large as 100 kg, but are usually found around the 25 kg mark. They have an average size of 80‚Äì100 cm but can grow up to 180 cm in length. Human consumption HƒÅpuku are a highly rated eating fish, reaching top value on both the local and international markets. Chefs who have tasted farmed hƒÅpuku have stated that it outperforms wild-caught hƒÅpuku.National Institute of Water and Atmospheric Research, \\"Farmed hapuku a sizzling success with top seafood connoisseurs\\" , National Institute of Water and Atmospheric Research, 2010. Retrieved September 12, 2010. In New Zealand for the year of 2008, hƒÅpuku had a commercial value of NZ$37 million with an export value of $4.29 million at a price of $10.29 per kg. HƒÅpuku is fished both commercially and recreationally in New Zealand. It is highly sought after, but catches are relatively low; this species is managed in the New Zealand Quota Management System (QMS). Currently, no size restriction in New Zealand is in place, but a bag limit of five fish per day exists.Ministry of Fisheries, \\"Fish Identification ‚Äì Hapuku (Groper)\\", Ministry of Fisheries, 2009. Retrieved September 12, 2010. Aquaculture Significant interest has been expressed globally for development of this species for aquaculture. In Europe, a very similar species of wreckfish is highly prized and considered a local delicacy. Because of this, the Polyprion spp. have been overfished in most areas. In New Zealand, the National Institute of Water and Atmospheric Research (NIWA) have embraced hƒÅpuku as an opportunity for New Zealand to expand, and have identified markets for this species locally in New Zealand and Australia, and internationally in Europe and Asia.National Institute of Water and Atmospheric Research, \\"Hapuku\\", National Institute of Water and Atmospheric Research, n.d. Retrieved September 12, 2010. Research and development Since 2003, NIWA has accumulated the world's largest broodstock resource for hƒÅpuku, and these broodstocks are held in large spawning tanks at Bream Bay Aquaculture Park. Each tank has its own controlled environment which is designed to maintain the optimum temperature and light for natural spawning. NIWA have now progressed through every aspect of hatchery technology development for hapuku. The complications encountered in this process were similar to those of other commercialised finfish species, such as halibut, turbot, sea bass, and sea bream. These complications were overcome with specific solutions developed for the early rearing of hapuku. The main technical complications that have been overcome are: * The system design for the successful incubation of egg and yolk-sac larvae. * Initiation of first feeding. * The transition from live feed to formulated feeds to produce weaned juveniles ready for on-growing and transfer to sea cages. Currently, the sea cage trials and tank trials are base-lining the performance for hƒÅpuku. These early on-growing trials and results are revealing considerable growth potential in aquaculture for this species. NIWA has been running a broodstock selection programme since 2007, and the results are showing which broodstock are producing the surviving first generation. With this information, it will soon be possible to start selecting desirable performance traits for the breeding programme. NIWA's aim is to maintain the competitive edge for hƒÅpuku farming as it increases, and become an important species for New Zealand's aquaculture sector.

The project is not currently funded and construction would begin around 2020 at the earliest. Route Three principal route options were considered, mainly concerning the alignment between Avignon, Aix-en-Provence, Toulon and Draguignan. * The option providing the most time saving between Nice and Avignon uses the speed of the Paris-Nice connection to offer the largest potential clientele base (to compete with one of the strongest internal air traffic routes) * The most northern route is the shortest between Avignon and Nice and may have a station serving the 'pole scientifique' close to Cadarache * The longest route passes by Marseille and Toulon, offering the quickest travel time between Marseille and Nice (1:10) Additional connections between the mediterranean coast between Barcelona, Montpellier, Marseille, Nice and Genoa and the southern cross route towards Toulouse and Bordeaux would be affected; the new line would link Marseille to Genoa in 3:15, and Barcelona in 3:35 (thanks to the LGV Perpignan-Figueres). The final route alignment decision and its details were announced by French Ecology Minister Jean-Louis Borloo on 30 June 2009, opting for the longest route via Marseille, Toulon, and Nice. Controversy This project was subject to public debate between 21 February and 8 July 2005. There was much local opposition to the project, particularly by various environmental organisations. Additionally differences of opinion due to the vested interests of the three d√©partements concerned (Bouches-du-Rh√¥ne, Var and Alpes-Maritimes) caused friction. Local elected officials have approved the project and the presidents of the general committees of the three d√©partements have agreed to propose an alternative route in order to reconcile their respective positions.

It can commonly be found in tropical regions, subtropical rainforest, scrub, watercourses and street trees. Since colonisation of Australia, their numbers have decreased but they have thrived on the introduced Camphor laurel (Cinnamomum camphora). The white-headed pigeon's nest generally consists of scanty twigs and is usually placed high in canopy up to 18 metres. It tends to lay one cream-white egg. Breeding is mostly from October to December. The size of the pigeon varies from about 38 to 41 centimetres (15.2 to 16.4 inches). Plumage consists of a white head and breast with a glossy back area. Wings and tail are black. The bill is red with a yellowish tip. The eye ring and legs are red and the eyes are pale orange or yellow. Juveniles have a grey crown and breast. These pigeons are often found alone, in pairs or in small flocks. They are very quiet and elusive. Their flight is swift and direct. Their call is loud and gruff sounding like \\"WHOO!\\" followed by a gruff inhalation sounding \\"uk\\" (repeated three times). Sometimes the call is a low \\"oom\\".

It was one of three new species defined when the slender-billed cuckoo-dove was split up in 2016 and retains the Latin binomial of the former species.[1] Taxonomy In 1760 the French zoologist Mathurin Jacques Brisson included a description of the Amboyna cuckoo-dove in his six volume Ornithologie based on a specimen collected on Ambon Island, one of the Maluku Islands of Indonesia. He used the French name La tourterelle d'Amboine and the Latin Turtur amboinensis. The two stars (**) at the start of the section indicates that Brisson based his description on the examination of a specimen. Although Brisson coined Latin names, these do not conform to the binomial system and are not recognised by the International Commission on Zoological Nomenclature. When in 1766 the Swedish naturalist Carl Linnaeus updated his Systema Naturae for the twelfth edition, he added 240 species that had been previously described by Brisson. One of these was the Amboyna cuckoo-dove which he placed with all the other pigeons in the genus Columba. Linnaeus included a brief description, coined the binomial name Columba amboinensis and cited Brisson's work. The species is now placed in the genus Macropygia was introduced in 1837 by the English naturalist William John Swainson. The Amboyna cuckoo-dove was formerly considered as conspecific with the sultan's cuckoo-dove (Macropygia doreya). The species was split based on an analysis of the vocalisations published in 2016. Nine subspecies are recognized: * M. a. amboinensis (Linnaeus, 1766) \\\\- Central Moluccas: Buru, Seram, Ambon and Seram Laut * M. a. admiralitatis Mayr, 1937 \\\\- Admiralty Island * M. a. carteretia Bonaparte, 1854 \\\\- Bismarck Archipelago (except Admiralty Islands).

Males tend to have a slight rose/green colouration on their nape and neck. In Indonesia and Papua New Guinea, many subspecies have whitish underparts, fine dark barring below and/or a whitish cap. The call of this dove is a very loud \\"whoop-a whoop\\" with some differences depending on the subspecies involved. Distribution and habitat The Amboyna cuckoo-dove inhabits rainforest, woodland, scrubland and rainforest regrowth areas. Behaviour and ecology The doves can often be seen in pairs or groups. Its diet consists of berries from both native plants and introduced weed species. They can be nomadic, depending on the supplies of food. They tend to fly short distances and low to the ground with great strength. Breeding occurs in spring and summer. The nest is a flat platform of sticks and vines, either in a fork of a tree or on top of a low tree. One, creamy white, egg is laid.

His highest rank was komusubi. He is now a sumo coach. Career T≈çki began his career in January 1991 after joining the Takasago stable. Just like ex-sekiwake Takamiyama, who was a member of the same heya during the 1970s and 80s, T≈çki wore long sideburns as a distinctive feature. In 1998 T≈çki managed to enter the top makuuchi division for the first time and quickly became a regular maegashira, although his results were not sufficient to make him a sanyaku wrestler (although he was a komusubi for one tournament in September 2003, he could not retain this rank). He was not a great challenge to the top wrestlers in his makuuchi days, losing every bout he fought against both Musashimaru and Takanohana. He never managed to defeat a yokozuna or win a special prize. On December 18, 2000 in Osaka T≈çki was behind the wheel of a car which hit a pedestrian and killed her. He should not have been driving at all because the Sumo Association had banned all wrestlers from doing so following a previous incident. T≈çki was told by the Sumo Association not to leave his house for two months, and given a 20 percent pay cut. He withdrew from the January 2001 tournament as a result, and fell to the j≈´ry≈ç division. This left the Takasago stable without any top division wrestlers for the first time in its 123-year history. However, T≈çki was immediately promoted back to makuuchi following his return to the ring in March 2001. In 2004, T≈çki suffered a shoulder injury which eventually led to him dropping to j≈´ry≈ç once more. He did not succeed in making a sustained comeback to makuuchi, although he managed to return temporarily twice. He suffered increasingly from back problems related to spinal stenosis, which was the reason why he missed six days of the January 2006 tournament. This also reduced the power of his pushes and thrusts to his opponents. After a disastrous make-koshi in March, T≈çki was demoted to makushita in May 2006 and announced his retirement on the day the tournament started. Fighting style T≈çki relied almost exclusively on slapping and pushing techniques, making his style very predictable, yet often surprisingly successful. However, he was very vulnerable when his opponents got hold of his mawashi. He won only eight matches in his career by yori-kiri, or force out, and lost 132. His most common winning kimarite were the slap down, hataki-komi, and the pull down, hiki-otoshi. Retirement from sumo T≈çki had his official retirement ceremony on January 27, 2007 and worked as a coach at Kokonoe stable. Until January 2010 he used the name Sanoyama Oyakata. However, the elder stock is owned by the stable's former ≈çzeki Chiyotaikai, and upon Chiyotaikai's retirement T≈çki switched to the Asakayama name owned by Kai≈ç. He changed once again, to Oshiogawa Oyakata, in September 2010. In 2012 he became Sendagawa Oyakata and in the same year left Kokonoe stable to take up a coaching role at Nishikido stable.

In 1946 she challenged racial segregation at a cinema in New Glasgow, Nova Scotia by refusing to leave a whites-only area of the Roseland Theatre. For this, she was convicted of a minor tax violation for the one-cent tax difference between the seat she had paid for and the seat she used, which was more expensive. Desmond's case is one of the most publicized incidents of racial discrimination in Canadian history and helped start the modern civil rights movement in Canada. In 2010, Desmond was granted a posthumous pardon, the first to be granted in Canada. The Crown-in-Right-of-Nova Scotia also apologized for prosecuting her for tax evasion and acknowledged she was rightfully resisting racial discrimination. In 2016, the Bank of Canada inaccurately announced that Desmond would be the first Canadian woman to be featured on the front of a Canadian banknote, but that honour went to Agnes Macphail, who appeared along with three men on a small print run commemorative note issued in 2017 to mark the 150th anniversary of Confederation. In late 2018 Desmond became the first Canadian woman to appear alone on a Canadian bank note‚Äîa $10 bill which was unveiled by Finance Minister Bill Morneau and Bank of Canada Governor Stephen Poloz during a ceremony at the Halifax Central Library on March 8, 2018. Desmond was also named a National Historic Person in 2018.Government of Canada Announces New National Historic Designations , Parks Canada press release, January 12, 2018. Biography Viola Desmond (n√©e Davis) was born on July 6, 1914, one of ten children of James Albert and Gwendolin Irene (n√©e Johnson) Davis. Viola grew up with her grandparents who were active in the black community in Halifax, Nova Scotia, despite the fact that her mother was white and her father black, uncommon for the time. Growing up, Desmond noted the absence of professional hair and skin-care products for black women and set her sights on addressing the need. Being of African descent, she was not allowed to train to become a beautician in Halifax, so she left and received beautician training in Montreal, Atlantic City and one of Madam C. J. Walker's beauty schools in New York. Upon finishing her training, Desmond returned to Halifax to start her own hair salon. Her clients included Portia White and a young Gwen Jenkins, later the first black nurse in Nova Scotia. A tin of sepia face powder sold by Viola Desmond In addition to the salon, Desmond opened The Desmond School of Beauty Culture so that black women would not have to travel as far as she had to receive proper training. Catering to women from Nova Scotia, New Brunswick and Quebec, the school operated using a vertical integration framework. Students were provided with the skills required to open their own businesses and provide jobs for other black women within their communities. Each year as many as fifteen women graduated from the school, all of whom had been denied admission to whites- only training schools. Desmond also started her own line of beauty products, Vi's Beauty Products, which she marketed and sold herself. Arrest Viola Desmond joined her husband Jack Desmond in a combined barbershop and hairdressing salon on Street. On November 8, 1946 while on a business trip to Sydney to sell her beauty products, Viola Desmond's car broke down in New Glasgow. She was told that she would have to wait a day before the parts to fix it became available. To pass the time while waiting, she went to see The Dark Mirror starring Olivia de Havilland at the Roseland Film Theatre. There were no formal laws enforcing segregation in movie theatres in New Glasgow, and the theatre had no sign telling its patrons about the policy, but main floor seats were reserved for white patrons. Ms. Desmond was sold a ticket to the balcony unaware of the segregation and, being nearsighted, went to sit in the floor section to be close to the screen. When she was asked to move, she realized what was happening, and refused to move because she had a better view from the main floor there. She was forcefully removed from the theatre which caused an injury to her hip. She was also arrested and spent 12 hours in jail, and had to pay a $20 fine. The tax on the balcony price of 30 cents was two cents; the tax on the floor price of 40 cents was three cents. She was convicted of depriving the government of one cent in tax. Desmond was kept in jail overnight and was never informed about her right to legal advice, a lawyer, or bail. Upon returning to Halifax, Desmond discussed the matter with her husband, and his advice was to let it go. However, she then sought advice from the leaders of her church, the Cornwallis Street Baptist Church, where the Minister William Pearly Oliver and his wife Pearline encouraged her to take action. With their support, Desmond decided to fight the charge in court. Trials Frederick William Bissett ‚Äì Desmond's lawyer Following the decision to fight the charge, Carrie Best broke the story of Desmond in the first edition of The Clarion, the first black-owned and published Nova Scotia newspaper. Best had herself previously confronted the racial segregation of the Roseland Theatre.Mainstreet, CBC Radio Halifax, January 19, 2015. With the help of her church and the Nova Scotia Association for the Advancement of Coloured People (NSAACP), Desmond hired a lawyer, Frederick William Bissett, who represented her in the criminal trials and attempted, unsuccessfully, to file a lawsuit against the Roseland Theatre. During subsequent trials the government insisted on arguing that this was a case of tax evasion. A provincial act regulating cinemas and movie theatres required the payment of an amusement tax based on the price of the theatre ticket. Since the theatre would only agree to sell Desmond a cheaper balcony ticket, but she had insisted upon sitting in the much more expensive main floor seat, she was only one cent short on tax. The statute used to convict Desmond contained no explicitly racist or discriminatory language. Bissett's decision to opt for a judicial review rather than appeal the original conviction proved disastrous. Desmond's lawyer tried to appeal the decision on the basis of her being wrongfully accused of tax evasion, not on the basis of racial discrimination.. When dismissing the case, Justice William Lorimer Hall said: Her lawyer, Bissett, refused to bill Desmond and the money was used to support William Pearly Oliver's newly established Nova Scotia Association for the Advancement of Coloured People (NSAACP). Later life After the trial, Desmond closed her business and moved to Montreal where she could enroll in a business college. She eventually settled in New York City, where she died from gastrointestinal bleeding on February 7, 1965, at the age of 50. She is buried at Camp Hill Cemetery in Halifax, Nova Scotia. Legacy The gravesite of Viola Desmond at Camp Hill Cemetery, Halifax. William Pearly Oliver later reflected on Desmond's legacy: Desmond is often compared to Rosa Parks, given they both challenged racism by refusing to vacate seats in \\"Whites Only\\" sections and contributed to the rise of the Civil Rights Movement. Despite Nova Scotia and other Canadian provinces having Jim Crow laws, for instance in education, there was no law specifically enforcing segregation in theatres.Washington Post  Commemorations  Launch of the Viola Desmond, a ferry operating in Halifax harbour On January 28, 2019, a Nova Scotia school teacher was awarded the Governor General's History Award for her students' proposal to build a statue of Desmond in Cornwallis Park.

On December 8, 2016, Viola Desmond was chosen as the first Canadian woman to appear on her own on the Canadian ten-dollar note after being on a shortlist of five. On November 26, 2018, the Bank of Canada released a new design of the $10 bill, celebrating Viola Desmond's achievements in the civil rights movement. While Agnes Macphail appeared on a note in 2017 with three men, Desmond was the first non-royal woman to appear alone on a regularly circulated note.Bundale, Brett, \\"Canada unveils $10 bill featuring civil rights icon Viola Desmond\\" , The Star, March 8, 2018.\\"ew $10 bank note featuring Viola Desmond unveiled on International Women‚Äôs Day\\" (press release), Bank of Canada, March 8, 2018. Desmond was named a National Historic Person on January 12, 2018. In June 2018, Canada's Walk of Fame star was unveiled at the Halifax Ferry Terminal.  The Arts  In 2000, Desmond and other Canadian civil rights activists were the subject of a National Film Board of Canada documentary Journey to Justice. A documentary film was made about her, entitled Long Road to Justice: The Viola Desmond Story. Her sister, Wanda Robson, wrote a book about activism in her family and her experiences with her sister, titled Sister to Courage. Desmond was also the subject of a children's book Viola Desmond Won't Be Budged by Jody Nyasha Warner. Singer Faith Nolan wrote a song about her. On February 2, 2016, Historica Canada featured Desmond in a Heritage Minute, filmed in High River, Alberta, in June 2015. The video features Kandyse McClure as Viola Desmond. She became the first historical woman of colour to feature in a Heritage Minute. Google's July 6, 2018 Doodle, created by Google artist Sophie Diao, celebrates the life and legacy of Viola Desmond, and was distributed across Canada. Desmond's life and broader issues of racial discrimination in Canada are the subject of a play developed by Toronto playwright Andrea Scott. Controlled Damage was produced by Halifax's Neptune Theatre in association with b current productions of Toronto. The play premiered at Neptune on 4 February, 2020 with Halifax actress Deborah Castrilli in the role of Viola Desmond. Apology and pardon On April 14, 2010, the Lieutenant Governor of Nova Scotia, Mayann Francis, on the advice of Premier Darrell Dexter, invoked the Royal Prerogative and granted Desmond a posthumous free pardon, the first to be granted in Canada. The free pardon, an extraordinary remedy granted under the Royal Prerogative of Mercy only in the rarest of circumstances and the first one granted posthumously, differs from a simple pardon in that it is based on innocence and recognizes that a conviction was in error. Francis, herself a Black Canadian, remarked: \\"Here I am, 64 years later ‚Äì a black woman giving freedom to another black woman\\", about her signing of the pardon. The Government of Nova Scotia also apologized. Desmond's younger sister Wanda Robson and Graham Reynolds, a professor of Cape Breton University, worked with the Government of Nova Scotia to ensure that Desmond's name was cleared, there was a public acknowledgement of the injustice and Nova Scotia reaffirmed its commitment to Human Rights. The provincial government declared the first Nova Scotia Heritage Day in her honour in February 2015. Desmond's portrait also hangs in Government House in Halifax, Nova Scotia.

For a quarter of a century he was the Eugene Higgins Professor of Chemistry Emeritus at Columbia University. He is known for making significant contributions to the total synthesis of natural products, including a lifelong fascination with the synthesis of quinine. In so doing he also made a number of contributions to mechanistic understanding of reactions, and performed pioneering work on enamine chemistry, leading to development of the Stork enamine alkylation. It is believed he was responsible for the first planned stereocontrolled synthesis as well as the first natural product to be synthesised with high stereoselectivity. Stork was also an accomplished mentor of young chemists and many of his students have gone on to make significant contributions in their own right.  Early years  Gilbert Stork was born in the Ixelles municipality of Brussels, Belgium in December 31, 1921. The oldest of 3 children, his middle brother, Michel, died in infancy, but he remained close with his younger sister Monique his whole life. His family had Jewish origins, although Gilbert himself didn't recall them being religiously active. The family moved to Nice when Gilbert was about 14 (circa. 1935) and remained there until 1939. During this period, Gilbert completed his lyc√©e studies, distinguishing himself in French literature and writing. Characterizing himself during those years as \\"not terribly self-confident,\\" and uncertain whether he could find employment in a profession he enjoyed, Gilbert considered applying for a colonial civil service job in French Indochina. However, the outbreak of World War II that year led the family to flee to New York, where his father's older brother, Sylvain, had already emigrated.  Education  Gilbert studied for a Bachelor of Science at the University of Florida, from 1940 to 1942. He then moved to the University of Wisconsin‚ÄìMadison for this PhD, which he obtained in 1945 under the supervision of Samuel M. McElvain. While at Wisconsin he met Carl Djerassi, with whom he would go on to form a lasting friendship.

The steak began to degrade and to dispose of it Stork put it in a hot acid bath used to clean glassware which contained nitric and sulphuric acids. He was then concerned he would produce nitroglycerine due to the glycerine in the steak and the presence of nitric and sulphuric acids. However, due to the high temperature of the bath, the oxidation of glycerol was much faster than the nitration of glycerin thus preventing the formation of explosives.

While often compared with the later LabelFlash and LightScribe technologies, which also offered users consumer-grade computerized disc labeling, DiscT@2 is different in that it required no proprietary media and wrote the graphics to the data side of the disc.  Technical details  Any CD-R or DVD disc can be engraved by a compatible optical drive, and read by any optical drive. However, as discs can be made from multiple different materials, Yamaha recommended at the time that discs made with blue azo dye be used for the best results. Contemporaneous reviews reported that discs made of phthalocyanine resulted in \\"barely discernible\\" images. DiscT@2 writes its label in the unused portion of the data side of the disc. Therefore, as more and more data is written to the disc, the available surface area for the label becomes smaller and smallera full disc would not be able to have any label burned to it at all. According to The New York Times, even having only 50MB free on the disc would still leave a ‚âà wide band where a label could be written. By varying the intensity of the laser while writing, 128 shades of gray were available. Before engraving, the graphics would need to be converted by software from Cartesian to polar coordinates. While a CD-R or DVD cannot be rewritten, when not full new data can be appended to old data in a conventional disc. In a DiscT@2-engraved disc, by contrast, this is impossible; the disc must be closed after writing the label, even if the label doesn't extend all the way to the disc's edge. This is because data on compact discs is written via a process called eight-to-fourteen modulation. As a consequence of this encoding scheme, the \\"pits\\" on the disc can only be between 3T (0.83mm @ 1.2m/s) and 11T (3.05mm @ 1.2m/s). For the fine details in a photograph and in some fonts, for example, 3T is too large; the original DiscT@2 drive, for example, was capable of making pits of less than 0.1mm. Therefore, if the label were able to be read as data, it would be invalid; meaning that some optical drives or consumer equipment might not be able to retrieve data after the label even if it could be written. Therefore, the disc's Table of Contents must always come before the label. As higher precision is needed, engraving an image takes longer than writing data; according to Tom's Hardware, the average time is between six and fifteen minutes.  Drive compatibility  *Yamaha CRW-F1 (July 2002, first to market) *Pioneer DVR-111D, DVR-111L, DVR-111, and DVR-A11XL, DVR-218L *NEC ND-3550A, ND-3551A, ND-4550A, ND-4551A & ND-4571A  Reception  DiscT@2 failed to catch on in the market place; the original drive to support the feature, the CRW-F1, was seen by reviewers as being attractive primarily due to its speed and not due to DiscT@2. In a March 2006 retrospective, PC Magazine primarily blamed the failure of the technology on the impracticality of using the data side for labels, the low speed of label writing compared to data, and the low contrast images it produced. Despite this, optical drives supporting DiscT@2 continued to be released until at least 2010. This is partially because LabelFlash optical drives were backwards compatible with DiscT@2.

He served as Master of Balliol College, Oxford, Regius Professor of Divinity, and Bishop of Salisbury from 1615. Among his four younger brothers, George became Archbishop of CanterburyChambers Biographical Dictionary, , p. 2 and Maurice became Lord Mayor of London. Life He was born in Guildford, the elder brother of George Abbot the future archbishop, and shared the same course of education. He early distinguished himself as a preacher, and a sermon which he preached at Paul's Cross gained for him the living of Bingham, Nottinghamshire, to which he was presented by John Stanhope. King James appointed Abbot one of the chaplains in ordinary. In 1609, he was elected master of Balliol College. In 1613 he became Regius Professor of Divinity at Oxford, and attacked the writings of Petrus Bertius, a Dutch Remonstrant, on the topic of falling from grace. Subsequently, he made a broader attack based on orthodox Calvinism and Augustine of Hippo on the spreading ideas of Jacobus Arminius. In 1615 he attacked John Howson and William Laud, implying Catholic sympathies, and wrapping in those terms the further implication that Laud was Arminian. Howson retorted that the Abbot brothers were Puritans.Nicholas Tyacke, Seventeenth- century Oxford (1997), p. 578. In speaking of secret methods by which certain persons were attempting to undermine the Protestant Reformation, Abbot was clearly referencing Laud, who was present for the lecture. Laud, stung, wrote to his friend, Richard Neile, Bishop of Lincoln, complaining that, \\"he was fain to sit patiently at the rehearsal of this sermon, though abused almost an hour together, being pointed at as he sat,\\" Rushworth's Collection, vol. 1, p. 62. and asking whether he ought to take public notice of the insult. Abbot obtained the see of Salisbury, and his brother George consecrated him. On his departure from the university, he delivered a farewell oration in Latin, which was much admired. Comparing the merits of the two brothers, Robert and George, Thomas Fuller remarksFuller, Thomas. Worthies of England. Surry, p. 82. that Abbot died in Salisbury, being one of five bishops who succeeded to the see of Salisbury within the space of six years. Works Abbot's writings were mainly against the Roman Catholic Church; he also attacked Arminianism. In 1594, Abbot appeared as a writer with A Mirror of Popish Subtilties (1594) which was designed as a refutation of the arguments advanced by Nicholas Sander and Robert Bellarmine against the Protestant theory of the sacraments. The occasion for this work was a disputation in which Abbot had been involved, with a Marian Father Paul Spence who was being held prisoner in Worcester Castle. Antichristi Demonstratio [A Demonstration of Antichrist] (1603), was against Bellarmine once more. It was admired by the new king James I, who ordered material from his own Paraphrase on the Apocalypse to be printed with it in a second edition of 1608. Abbot was concerned to refute Bellarmine's reading of the Book of Revelation as literal and innovative (by comparison with the tradition of Nicholas of Lyra on Revelation 13), and to attack what would be identified later as the futurist approach in the tradition of Francisco Ribera. Abbot's own reading was typically historicist and concerned to argue for the Pope as Antichrist.David Brady, The Contribution of British Writers between 1560 and 1830 to the Interpretation of Revelation 13.16‚Äì18: (the number of the beast) : a study in the history of exegesis (1983), p. 58. His A Defence of the Reformed Catholic of Mr. William Perkins (3 vols, 1606‚Äì1609), won Abbot royal favour and a promise of preferment. It was an intervention defending the late William Perkins from an attack by the Catholic priest William Bishop.Dictionary of National Biography, Bishop, William, D.D. (1554‚Äì1624), bishop of Chalcedon, by Thompson Cooper. Published 1885. The work responded to a royal commission and prompting from Richard Bancroft, and in the first part covered the ground of the Gunpowder Plot. Abbot in the main argument of the Defence indicates his Puritan sympathies by deriving the true tradition of the Early Christian Church through the Albigensians, Lollards, Huguenots, and contemporary Calvinists. In the concluding part Abbot drew \\"the true ancient Roman Catholike\\" as he himself conceived the character. He dedicated the book to Henry Frederick, Prince of Wales, who promised that Abbot should not be forgotten. Abbot returned to the theme of the Plot in his Antilogia (1613), defending the condemnation of Henry Garnet. It used both state papers and scurrility; taking the form of a reply to the Jesuit Eud√¶mon Joannes, it was later considered by David Jardine to be the major historical work of its period on the Plot. A course of anti-Catholic lectures, read in his college, was published after his death aa On the King's Supremacy. He wrote several commentaries on the scriptures which were not printed; among these is a Latin commentary on the Epistle to the Romans, in four volumes folio. Abbot's manuscripts passed to the Bodleian Library by his grandson. Family Abbot was twice married. By his first wife Abbot had sons and a daughter Martha, who was married to Sir Nathaniel Brent; their daughter Margaret Brent was married to Edward Corbet, rector of Great Haseley, and the latter presented some of the bishop's manuscripts to the Bodleian Library. His second wife was the widow Bridget Cheynell, mother of Francis Cheynell. This second marriage is said to have displeased his brother, the archbishop, who regarded it as an infringement of the apostolic injunction that a bishop should be the husband of one wife.

Due to budgetary restrictions, Grierson and co-writer John Lonie were forced to scale down the story, concentrating primarily on the trials and tribulations of one lost patrol. Background In 1942, with the fall of Singapore, Australia lost nearly an entire division captured. The rest of Australia's professional military force ‚Äì the Australian Imperial Force (AIF) ‚Äì were still overseas fighting the Axis forces in North Africa. Australia then only had available conscripts and militiamen who were considered unfit for combat duties. These were known as 'chocos' ‚Äì it was believed that they would 'melt' away in the heat of battle. The chocos had been kept doing menial tasks such as working at unloading cargo. Given the circumstances that these men were the only ones immediately available to defend New Guinea, they were rushed northwards with minimal, or no, combat training. From Port Moresby, they were sent over the torturous Owen Stanley Range along the only track ‚Äì the Kokoda track till they came in contact with Japanese forces coming along the track from the other direction. The story of Kokoda is of men from one of these units, under- trained, under-provisioned sent to face battle-hardened Japanese soldiers in a desperate effort to save Australia. Plot A motley crew of Australian militiamen or 'chocos' from the 39th Battalion are stationed in a New Guinea village just after the Japanese invasion. The 39th Battalion are the only troops available to hold off the Japanese advance until the AIF arrives to relieve them. The story centres on an infantry section of the 39th Battalion. The section with their platoon commander, a veteran AIF lieutenant (Ben Barrack) who has served in North Africa, is on forward patrol when they are attacked by a Japanese force. The lieutenant is killed early in the battle and the section, led only by a recently promoted lance-corporal, Max (Simon Stone), decide to fall back. One of the men, L/Cpl Wilstead (Ewen Leslie), is bayoneted in the face by a Japanese soldier, and a Bren gunner called Blue (Christopher Baker) offers to stay and provide cover. However, the remaining men are cut off and surrounded in the dense jungle, with little hope of escaping. The Australians try to remain hidden until nightfall, when Darko (Travis McMahon) and Jack (Jack Finsterer) decide to go and find out where Blue is. They stumble across Blue, who is tied up and being tortured by Japanese soldiers. Darko and Jack look on helplessly as the Japanese soldiers bayonet him in the stomach and groin, and finally decapitate him with a sword. They return to their hiding place, shaken by what they have seen. The Japanese ambush the section and they run further into the jungle. Caught behind enemy lines in harsh terrain, Jack, to whom the others (including his brother, Max, have deferred) tries to maintain command of a small group of men. Suffering from malaria and dysentery, the remaining six men decide to make their way to Isurava, where the remainder of the 39th are fighting a desperate battle. One of the soldiers, Sam (Steve Le Marquand), has been injured in the leg and orders the rest of the section to leave him behind. They refuse and he struggles along with a crutch. After a full day of walking, the men are exhausted. The next morning they awake to find Sam gone, having hidden himself in a hollow tree stump to avoid holding them up. The men continue and are ambushed by a Japanese patrol. The Japanese soldiers are all killed, but Max is badly wounded by a gunshot to the stomach and is unable to walk. He is carried by all the men. The section makes it to a village that has been destroyed by the advancing Japanese, and the Australians decide to take refuge. They bury the dead native villagers and an argument arises between Jack and Darko, a tough soldier who carries the section's Bren gun, over Max. Darko wishes to leave him behind as he is slowing the section down and they are needed at Isurava. Jack, however, wants to stay with him. However, Max decides to stay and let the others go and Johnno (Tom Budge), who has severe dysentery, stays with him. The men agree, and Jack, Darko and Burke (Luke Ford), Darko's number two, head off to Isurava. The journey becomes treacherous and Burke's dysentery is getting worse. Meanwhile, at the village, a few Japanese soldiers arrive to search the village and in a desperate attempt to save the life of his mate, Johnno fires at the Japanese and runs into the jungle; however, he is tracked down and gunned down by the Japanese. A day or so later a New Guinea tribesman comes back to inspect the village and finds a badly wounded Max in the hut. After a gut-wrenching climb, Jack, Darko and Burke are found by Australian troops, who take them to Isurava, where the situation is in dire straits. The AIF has finally arrived but they too are weak from the trek to Isurava. The 39th is no longer a capable fighting unit, and almost all of the men are too sick or wounded to fight. The three men check themselves into a makeshift field hospital for treatment. However an AIF officer comes in and asks for any available men from the 39th to help hold the line. Jack, Burke and Darko volunteer and they are assigned to a position held by men of the 2/16th Battalion. That night the Japanese attack in waves against the Australian positions. The Australians, who are only equipped with rifles and machine guns, desperately hold off the Japanese. The Japanese are gunned down by the superior firepower of the Australians, but in the final seconds of the fight Burke is shot through the chest and dies in Darko's arms as the fight rages on. The Japanese end the assault and the battle is over. The next day, the scant remainder of the 39th is paraded at Isurava village. The men are tired and haggard and receive news that they will be taken off the line and that they have just saved Australia from an imminent invasion. After the speech by the 39th's colonel (William McInnes), Jack and Darko withdraw with the rest of the soldiers. (The Australians withdrew from Isurava to take up positions at Brigade Hill.) While withdrawing, Jack and Darko spot Max being carried by Fuzzy wuzzy angels to an aid station. He has survived. Based on true story The movie was inspired by the true story of a forward patrol led by Lieutenant Sword that found itself cut off from supply at the beginning of the Battle for Isurava. After many frightening days making their way back to Isurava with no food, carrying the wounded and suffering from the effects of tropical diseases, they emerged from the jungle near Alola. Upon hearing that the 39th Battalion was about to be overrun, they joined a party of severely wounded men and made their way back to the battle.Fitzsimons, Peter. \\"Kokoda.\\" Hodder Headline 2005, p. 295 Style The film barely shows the Japanese themselves in any detail ‚Äì reflecting the claustrophobic jungle warfare ‚Äì when the enemy could be just in front of you but hidden from sight.  Location  Kokoda was shot on location at Mount Tamborine, Queensland. Reception The film received positive reviews from critics and currently holds a 71% \\"fresh\\" rating on Rotten Tomatoes.Kokoda 2007, Rotten Tomatoes, 31 January 2011 Paul Byrnes from The Sydney Morning Herald called the film \\"a glimpse of what this dirty, nasty, very personal corner of the war was like.\\" In Australia the film made over $3 million in its first few weeks and became one of the highest-grossing Australian films of the year. One critic went as far to say that Kokoda was a worthy companion to Peter Weir's film Gallipoli.http://www.theage.com.au/articles/2006/04/19/1145344148980.html Some critics felt that character development was slim except for Jack and his brother who are later found out to be of German-Australian descent. The performances by Jack Finsterer, Travis McMahon and Steve Le Marquand were highly praised by critics, considering most of them had never done a film on this large scale. The film was also praised for its realistic portrayal of the Australian 39th Battalion during the campaign as well as the jungle setting which critics found \\"haunting, scary and very realistic.\\" Many Kokoda veterans have also praised the film, many calling it \\"the closest thing you can get other than experiencing combat on the Kokoda Track yourself\\". Awards The film received 6 nominations. Two 2006 AFI nominations for best costume design and best visual effects, one nomination from the Film Critics Circle of Australia for best cinematography and three from the IF Awards for best cinematography, best editing and best production design. Box office Kokoda grossed $3,138,501 at the box office in Australia.

Nataraja dancing the cosmic dance of creation, destruction and moksha (= ultimate liberation) upon the prone body of ApasmƒÅra, the dwarf demon of avidya (= ignorance or lack of spiritual insight) - Chola bronze, Mus√©e Guimet. According to Hindu mythology, ApasmƒÅra is a dwarf who represents spiritual ignorance (see also ignorance) and nonsensical speech. He is also known as Muyalaka or Muyalakan. To preserve knowledge in the world, ApasmƒÅra must be subdued, not killed, as to do so would disturb the necessary balance between spiritual knowledge and ignorance. Killing ApasmƒÅra would symbolise the attainment of knowledge without the (essential) effort, dedication and hard work involved, and this would lead to the devaluing of knowledge in all its forms. To subdue ApasmƒÅra, Lord ≈öiva adopted the form of ≈örƒ´ Na·π≠arƒÅja - the Lord of Dance and performed the cosmic dance of TƒÅ·πá·∏çava. During this dance, ≈örƒ´ Na·π≠arƒÅja suppressed ApasmƒÅra by crushing him with his right foot. As ApasmƒÅra is one of the few demons destined to immortality, it is believed that Lord ≈öiva forever remains in his ≈örƒ´ Na·π≠arƒÅja form suppressing ApasmƒÅra for all eternity.Knappert, Jan Indian Mythology, a volume in the series Encyclopedias of Myth and Legend pub.

This mythological dwarf is generally depicted with his hand in A√±jali MudrƒÅ. He is often depicted in this posture in depictions of Na·π≠arƒÅja. In some other interpretation it is regarded as the dwarf vamana(vishnu's avatar) depicting a wider sectarian antagonism. Etymology and medical application of name The suffix smƒÅra (from smaranam- 'utterances') signifies 'speech'. The compound apasmƒÅra means 'gibberish' i.e. nonsensical or unintelligible speech. The Ayurvedic disease concept 'ApasmƒÅra' (see below) referred to certain neurological disorders having such speech as a symptom, but, given the absence, at the time, of such modern adjuncts to diagnosis as brain-scanning, it is hard now to determine with any exactitude what all these may have been. Disease concept in Ayurveda The concept of ApasmƒÅra in ƒÄyurveda relates to a group of neurological disorders, one of which may be identified as epilepsy:M.S. Krishnamurthy, Epilepsy - Ayurvedic Understanding and its Treatment'B.V. Manyam (1992), Epilepsy in ancient India. Epilepsia. 1992 May- Jun;33(3):473-5 according to Mahar·π£i Caraka, there are 4 types of apasmƒÅra. These 4 types of apasmara are Vataja, Pitaja, Kapahaja and Sannipataja. Ayurvedic Epilepsy Treatment https://www.epilepsytreatment.org/ayurvedic- treatment-for-epilepsy Charakhas instituted this classification depending upon the different dashas of the body. Usage in Indian astronomical symbolism Recent work by Rupa Bhaty analysing the symbolism of the NatarƒÅja icon of ≈öiva has revealed the presence of imagery relating not only to the mythology and iconography of expanded consciousness, but also to astronomy. Bhaty Rupa, 2017 http://indiafacts.org/cosmic-consciousness-and-astronomical-association-of- natarajas-dance-with-apasmara-and-agastya/ Bhaty interprets the demon ApasmƒÅra, in his astronomical form as the constellation Lepus (Indian Muyala - likewise a rabbit or hare), as representing forgetfulness, specifically forgetfulness concerning the star Canopus (equated in India with the sage Agastya), with ApasmƒÅra / Muyala representing / standing in for Agastya when the latter is not visible in India at certain latitudes; and possibly also forgetfulness of a deluge coinciding with a supernova event commemorated in certain South Indian festivals (celebrated at the New Year / March equinox) in honour of lord ≈öiva. The lunar associations of the hare in many cultures likewise tally with the association of ApasmƒÅra and his constellation Lepus with pathological mental states though the concept of lunacy (i.e. 'moon madness'). Bhaty asserts that Rudra, the hunter (compare Orion (mythology)), and ApasmƒÅra are to be equated with the constellations Kootu and Muyalaka, which were used by the navigators of Malabar and are identifiable with the western constellations Orion the Hunter, and Lepus, the Hare. ≈öiva / Rudra / Orion (as NatarƒÅja - 'Lord of the Dance'), by treading ApasmƒÅra underfoot, delivers Agastya from the clutches of ignorance, by keeping track of the rising of Agastya-Canopus in the night skies of Springtime, as viewed on the horizon at different latitudes on the Indian peninsula.

He taught at the University of Chicago from 1936 to 1954, and at Harvard University from 1953 to 1983, becoming the Morris Loeb Professor of Chemistry in 1960, and Professor Emeritus in 1983. The Westheimer medal was established in his honor in 2002. Westheimer did pioneering work in physical organic chemistry, applying techniques from physical to organic chemistry and integrating the two fields. He explored the mechanisms of chemical and enzymatic reactions, and made fundamental theoretical advances. Westheimer worked with John Gamble Kirkwood on the Bjerrum electrostatic analysis of carboxylic acids; with Joseph Edward Mayer on the calculation of molecular mechanics; explored the mechanisms of enzyme catalysis with Birgit Vennesland and determined the mechanisms of chromic acid oxidations and kinetic isotope effects. He received the National Medal of Science in 1986 \\"For his series of extraordinary, original and penetrating investigations of the mechanisms of organic and enzymic reactions, which have played an unequaled role in the advancement of our knowledge of the ways in which chemical and biochemical processes proceed.\\"  Early life and education  Frank Henry Westheimer was born on January 15, 1912, to Henry F. Westheimer (1870‚Äì1960) and Carrie C (Burgunder) Westheimer (1887‚Äì1972) of Baltimore, Maryland. He graduated from Dartmouth College in 1932. He went on to Harvard University, where he earned his masters in chemistry in 1933 and his doctorate in chemistry in 1935. Westheimer came to Harvard hoping to do research with James Bryant Conant. When told that Conant would not take on new students, Westheimer outwaited him and was finally accepted as his last graduate student. Westheimer did some work on semicarbazone at Conant's suggestion. Conant also suggested that Westheimer work during the summer with Alsoph Corwin at Johns Hopkins University. By doing porphyrin synthesis with Corwin, Westheimer gained needed laboratory experience. In 1933, Conant became president of Harvard in 1933 and ceased doing research. Nonetheless, Conant's interactions with Westheimer had a lasting effect, impressing Westheimer with the need \\"to do important things\\". Westheimer completed his Ph.D. with E.P. Kohler. Although Westheimer described Kohler's organic chemistry class as \\"marvelous\\", Kohler gave Westheimer little direction or feedback about his research, which was largely self-directed. Another of Kohler's students, Max Tishler, expanded upon some of Westheimer's research, leading to a co-publication on the derivation of a furanol. In 1935 and 1936, as a National Research Council Fellow, Westheimer worked with physical chemist Louis P. Hammett at Columbia University. Hammett was a founder of the field of physical organic chemistry. Career Westheimer taught at the University of Chicago from 1936 to 1954, and at Harvard University from 1953 to 1983. He served as Chairman of the chemistry department at Harvard from 1959 to 1962. He became the Morris Loeb Professor of Chemistry at Harvard in 1960. He retired from teaching to become Professor Emeritus in 1983, and retired from research in 1988.  University of Chicago  Westheimer's first academic appointment was an independent Research Associateship at the University of Chicago, from 1936-1937. He became an instructor in 1937 and a Professor in 1948. As a lecturer in chemistry he taught the university's first course in physical organic chemistry. During Westheimer's second year at Chicago, John Gamble Kirkwood taught there. Westheimer worked with Kirkwood on problems in organic chemistry involving electrostatics. Westheimer related electrostatics to their effects on the properties of organic compounds. Kirkwood and Westheimer published four classical papers developing fundamental ideas in enzymology about the theory of the electrostatic influence of substituents on the dissociation constants of organic acids. They developed a Bjerrum electrostatic analysis of carboxylic acids. Their Kirkwood-Westheimer model for an ellipsoid cavity reconciles the work of Niels Bjerrum on dibasic acids with that of Arnold Eucken on dipole substituted acids, showing that they could coexist in the same physical world. Elaborations and fuller testing of their ideas have required forty years and the development of computers. During World War II, from 1943 to 1945, Westheimer worked for the National Defense Research Committee. He was a supervisor at the Explosives Research Laboratory in Bruceton, Pennsylvania. He did research on nitric acid, discovering a new acidity function for nitration reactions. He hesitated to discuss his work on the triphenyl carbinol series with physical chemists because of the secrecy requirements of the project. Other researchers such as Christopher Ingold were first to publish in the area. Westheimer was also influenced by the development of statistical mechanics by physicists Joseph Edward Mayer and Maria Goeppert-Mayer, who moved to the University of Chicago in 1945. Westheimer applied the principles of statistical mechanics to the structure of organic molecules, to better understand the ways in which molecules are assembled from atoms. Westheimer first consulted Mayer about applying techniques from statistical mechanics to the racemization of optically active biphenyls. All of his calculations were worked out by hand. The work became a model for studies of other elements and is considered foundational. The field of molecular mechanics, as it is now known, has wide applications. In 1943, Westheimer began publishing on the mechanisms of chromic acid oxidations, publishing a \\"masterly review\\" of the area in 1949. In 1950, University of Chicago biochemist Birgit Vennesland approached Vennesland about a project she and her student Harvey Fisher were doing, involving isotopes in enzyme reactions. Vennesland had developed a project involving the fate of hydrogen atoms in alcohol dehydrogenase. Vennesland and Fisher's results were puzzling in that a specific hydrogen in the pair at C1 in ethanol appeared to be uniquely reactive in the presence of the enzyme. Westheimer joined the project and helped develop an explanation based on the idea of enantiotopicity to explain how the enzyme alcohol dehydrogenase removed hydrogen from the alcohol molecule, enabling the body to metabolize alcohol. The researchers published two classic papers in 1953, \\"the first demonstration of the enzymatic discrimination between the two enantiotopic hydrogen atoms on the methylene carbon atom of ethanol.\\" The phenomenon they reported was not named enantiospecificity until much later. Westheimer designed additional experiments that proved their initial conjecture and established the isotope- based chirality of enzymes. This work was essential to understanding topicity, the enantiotopic and diastereotopic relationships between groups (or atoms) within molecules. In 2006, their 1953 paper (part I) received a Citation for Chemical Breakthrough Award from the Division of the History of Chemistry of the American Chemical Society.  Harvard University  In 1953, soon after completing the work on alcohol dehydrogenase, Westheimer moved to Harvard University. He continued his interest in reaction mechanisms, isotopes and oxidation. In 1955, Westheimer published the first of many articles on the chemistry of phosphate esters and phosphorus derivatives. He proposed that ATP transfers phosphate through a reactive monomeric metaphosphate species. While this did not turn out to be the literal case, many enzymic reactions do proceed through transition states that have this as a significant component. In a 1961 article, Westheimer applied ideas from statistical mechanics to the effects of isotopic substitution on the reactivity of organic molecules. His work on the magnitude of kinetic isotope effects (KIEs) is still the basis of understanding in the field. Transition state structure's dependence on the kinetic isotope effect is known as the Westheimer Effect. The standard nontunnelling approach to KIEs is developed from Westheimer and Lars Melander. The Melander-Westheimer postulate has successfully predicted the ways in which KIEs and transition state (TS) structures vary. Westheimer introduced the idea of photoaffinity labeling of the active site of proteins. The identification of the \\"active sites\\" of an enzyme is difficult in cases where proteins have hydrocarbon-rich sites. In 1962, Westheimer and others demonstrated the synthesis of p-nitrophenyl diazoacetate and the subsequent acylation of chymotrypsin to form diazoacetylchymotrypsin, which was then photolyzed. The introduction of an aliphatic diazo group into a bifunctional reagent enabled it to react with the enzyme. The photolabel generated a reactive carbenoid species capable of inserting into hydrocarbon C-H bonds. Westheimer also approached the reactions of phosphate transfer through mechanisms that involve five-coordinate intermediates. In 1968, Westheimer examined pseudorotation in phosphate ester chemistry and predicted the occurrence of pseudo-rotation of oxyphosphoranes. He showed the significance of this route and the importance of stereochemical rearrangements of the intermediates. Westheimer developed a set of guidelines, based on experimental observations, also known as Westheimer's rules. They have been widely used for describing and predicting the products and stereochemistry of substitution reactions involving phosphorus. Westheimer's 1987 paper in Science, \\"Why nature chose phosphates\\", discusses the importance of phosphates as signaling and building blocks for living organisms. Phosphates possess a value of pKa that allows them to be doubly ionized at physiological pH. The singly ionized form in the phosphodiester linkages of nucleic acids resists being hydrolyzed by water, but is not so stable that it won't undergo enzymatic hydrolysis. This work continues to challenge and inspire researchers studying biological chemistry and reactions in RNA, DNA, and ribozymes.  Awards and honors  Westheimer became a member of the National Academy of Sciences in 1954 and a foreign member of the Royal Society of London in 1983.Benner, Steven; Corey, Elias J. (2018). \\"Frank Henry Westheimer. 15 January 1912‚Äî14 April 2007\\". Biographical Memoirs of Fellows of the Royal Society. doi:10.1098/rsbm.2018.0009 He chaired the National Academy of Sciences Committee for the Survey of Chemistry from 1964 to 1965. Chemistry: Opportunities and Needs, also known as the \\"Westheimer Report\\", encouraged the federal government to increase spending on fundamental research in chemistry, to achieve parity with other physical sciences. It identified biochemistry as a promising and overlooked area for medical and pharmaceutical research. The report's recommendations were implemented, and it is still considered to be \\"comprehensive, definitive, and forward-looking\\". Westheimer was a member of President Lyndon Johnson's science advisory committee from 1967 to 1970. Westheimer served on the Council of the National Academy of Sciences for two terms, from 1973-1975 and 1976-1978, as well as being a Councillor of the American Philosophical Society (1981-1984), and Secretary of the American Academy of Arts and Sciences (1985-1990). As well as emphasizing the need for fundamental research, Westheimer was concerned about other political issues. He argued against wars in Vietnam and Iraq. He was aware of environmental issues, supporting measures to decrease pollution, combat global warming, increase energy conservation, and develop alternative energy sources. He advocated that science needed to be taught in new ways, to better educate nonscientists about scientific issues. Among Westheimer's many honors are the U.S. National Academy Award in Chemical Sciences in 1980, the Robert A. Welch Foundation Award in 1982, the U.S. National Medal of Science in 1986, the Priestley Medal in 1988; the Repligen Award for the Chemistry of Biological Processes in 1992; and the Nakanishi Prize in 1997. The Westheimer medal was established in his honor in 2002. The medal is awarded by Harvard University \\"for distinguished research into the field of chemistry\\", particularly in the areas of organic and biological chemistry. Family Frank H. Westheimer was married in 1937 to Jeanne E. Friedman (1915-2001). They had two children, Ellen Westheimer and Ruth Susan Westheimer.

It opened on 23 December 1895. According to the Theatres Trust, the \\"magnificent auditorium is probably the best surviving example in the United Kingdom of the oriental style applied to theatre architecture\\". History It was renamed the Palace of Varieties in 1904, although it reverted to its original name in 1909. Variety programmes dominated in the 1920s and 1930s and the theatre saw performances by Gracie Fields, Will Fyffe and Harry Lauder. It became a repertory theatre during World War II and at the celebrations to mark the end of the war, Eisenhower, Montgomery and Alanbrooke attended gala performances at the theatre. The Grand Opera House was acquired by the Rank Organisation, which led to its use as a cinema between 1961 and 1972. \\"The Palace\\" circa 1906 As business slowed in the early 1970s with the onset of the Troubles, Rank initiated plans to sell the theatre to a property developer, who proposed that the building be pulled down and replaced with an office block. However, following the action of Kenneth Jamison (director of the Arts Council of Northern Ireland) and Charles Brett (founder member of the Ulster Architectural Heritage Society and ACNI board member), the building was bought by the Arts Council of Northern Ireland and listed in 1974. The Permanent Secretary of the Department of Education, Arthur Brooke, lent his support to the project and his department provided the funding for extensive renovatation of the theatre. The Grand Opera House reopened in 1980. The building has been damaged by bombs on several occasions, usually when the nearby Europa Hotel had been targeted. It was badly damaged by bomb blasts in 1991 and 1993. The theatre continued, however, to host musicals, plays, pantomimes and live music. 2006 renovation and reopening In 1995 the running of the theatre was taken over by the Grand Opera House Trust. An renovation was undertaken in 2006 with the addition of the Baby Grand performance space together with extended foyers, extended stage wings and artist accommodation and access for customers with disabilities. A restaurant called \\"The Hippodrome\\" was added on the third floor, while on the ground floor a daytime bistro named \\"Luciano's\\" opened, as well as space for corporate meetings and functions. \\"Luciano's\\" closed after several years of poor trading.

Throughout his career, Zare has made a considerable impact in physical chemistry and analytical chemistry, particularly through the development of laser-induced fluorescence (LIF) and the study of chemical reactions at the molecular and nanoscale level. LIF is an extremely sensitive technique with applications ranging from analytical chemistry and molecular biology to astrophysics. One of its applications was the sequencing of the human genome. Zare is known for his enthusiasm for science and his exploration of new areas of research. He has mentored over 150 PhD students and postdoctoral researchers, of whom more than 49 are women or members of minorities. Zare is a strong advocate for women in science, and a fellow of the Association for Women in Science (AWIS) as of 2008. Education Zare earned his B.A. in chemistry and physics in 1961 and his Ph.D. in 1964 in physical and analytical chemistry at Harvard University. As an undergraduate he worked with William Klemperer. Zare moved to the University of California, Berkeley to do Ph.D. work with Dudley Herschbach, then returned 2 years later when Herschbach accepted a position at Harvard. Zare completed his Ph.D. thesis, a theoretical analysis of Molecular fluorescence and photodissociation, with Herschbach at Harvard in 1964. Career Zare joined Massachusetts Institute of Technology as an assistant professor in 1965. From 1966 to 1969, he was jointly appointed in the departments of chemistry, physics and astrophysics at JILA at the University of Colorado Boulder. In 1969 he became a full professor in the Department of Chemistry at Columbia University. He was named the Higgins Professor of Natural Science at Columbia in 1975. In 1977 Zare accepted a position as a full professor of chemistry at Stanford University, becoming the Marguerite Blake Wilbur Professor in Natural Science in 1987. He served as chair of the chemistry department from 2005 to 2011. Zare served on the National Science Board (NSB) of the National Science Foundation (NSF) from 1990 to 1996, and was the board‚Äôs chair from 1994 to 1996. He is a member of the editorial advisory boards of several scientific publications, among them Chemistry World, Angewandte Chemie, Central European Journal of Chemistry, Journal of Separation Sciences and the Chinese Journal of Chromatography. He is Chairman of the Board of Directors at Annual Reviews, Inc., and serves on the Board of Directors of The Camille and Henry Dreyfus Foundation. Research Zare is well known for his research in laser chemistry, particularly the development of laser-induced fluorescence, which he has used to study reaction dynamics and analytical detection methods. His research on the spectroscopy of chemical compounds suggested a new mechanism for energy transference in inelastic collisions. He and his students have developed tools and techniques to examine chemical reactions at the molecular and nanoscale levels. They have explored a wide-ranging variety of problems in physical chemistry and chemical analysis including examination of heterogeneous structures in mineral samples, the contents of cells and subcellular compartments, and the chemical analysis of liquid samples. Early in his career, the question of whether laser-induced fluorescence (LIF) could be used to study aflatoxins spurred Zare to adapt LIF for use on liquids. Work with postdoc Gerald Diebold resulted in the first use of LIF for detection in chemical analysis. This opened up the potential for a wide variety of fluid applications, including the detection of single molecules in liquids at room-temperature and detection methods for capillary electrophoresis. Zare and his coworkers have combined CCD imaging with LIF detection to detect amol and zeptamole amounts of FITC-labelled amino acids. Zare and his students have also developed cavity ring-down spectroscopy (CRDS) for quantitative diagnosis, and for high performance liquid chromatography (HPLC) Zare is also involved in the development of desorption electrospray ionization (DESI) techniques, which are being used for mass spectrometric imaging of lipids, metabolites and proteins in tissue samples, including prostate cancer. Zare has also worked with NASA and others on astrobiology. He is one of the co-authors of a paper that appeared in Science in 1996, raising the possibility that a meteorite from Mars, ALH84001, contained traces of Martian life. Zare used two-step laser mass spectrometry (L2MS), a technique that is particularly sensitive to organic molecules, to examine samples from the interior of the meteorite. He found that the 4.5-billion-year-old Martian meteorite, discovered in Antarctica, contained polycyclic aromatic hydrocarbons. This lead researchers to speculate on the presence of fossilized remains from Mars. Other researchers questioned this interpretation, suggesting that the sample might have been contaminated after its arrival on Earth. Considerable controversy resulted, which Zare felt disrupted his ongoing laboratory research. Zare has also worked with NASA on examinations of organic materials obtained from Comet 81P/Wild by the Stardust Spacecraft. Publications Zare has published several books, including a widely used textbook on the topic of angular momentum in quantum systems that is considered a classic for its explanations of angular momentum algebra and the fundamentals of molecular spectroscopy. He is an author or co-author of more than 1,000 peer-reviewed papers.

Personal life Eliasch was married to Amanda Eliasch, a photographer and filmmaker, from 1988 to 2006; and they have two sons. Their son Charles Eliasch is an opera singer.  Controversy  In June 2008, the Brazilian and international media reported that the company Gethal, owned by Eliasch, had been issued a fine of R$450 million for alleged illegal deforestation in the Amazon region by IBAMA (Brazilian Institute of Environment and Renewable Natural Resources). Gethal was investigated facing a possible fine but after the investigation ended, Gethal was not fined. Eliasch did not own Gethal at the time when the activities under investigation took place. In a press release note, Gethal stated that ‚Äúthe logging activity of Gethal Amazonas S/A had been out under the Forest Steward Council (FSC) guidelines, a certification that was obtained in 2000. The company was one of the first companies in Brazil to obtain such a certification‚Äù. According to Gethal, technical expert reports were produced proving that the company never caused damage to the environment. Gethal stopped the logging activities in 2005, ‚Äúwhen it came under Eliasch's control‚Äù. In 2008, a publication of Brazilian government documents shows IBAMA never made any allegations against Eliasch and cancels R$274.2 million fines against Gethal.

It emphasises the interactions and interdependencies between maturational and environmental determinants in developmental steps. The level that has been reached by the child on the developmental lines represents the result of interaction between drive and ego-superego development and their reaction to environmental influences; thus stressing the influence of the internal structures of the child as well as the environment of the child. An individual is understood to be capable of moving back along developmental lines as well as forwards. This regressing can be necessary at times when the individual has to deal with some current, potentially overwhelming challenge. Once overcome, he or she can then move forward again. When pathology in a person is assessed, there are large discrepancies among the lines and notable lags with respect to normal progress along each line. However, a given behaviour may reflect a temporary aberration rather than a true symptom. Basic developmental line Anna Freud initially distinguished six developmental lines. The line considered most 'basic' is one which describes the progression from dependency to emotional self-reliance and adult object relationship. It describes the changes at the level of observable mother-child relationships alongside the evolution of internal representations of objects that create templates for later relationships. Along this developmental line, the following stages are identified: #Biological unity between the mother-infant couple. The infant is under the assumption that the mother is a part of itself and is under its control, and the mother experiences the baby as psychologically part of her. Separation from the mother in this stage is thought to give rise to 'separation anxiety proper'. This first stage ends with the first year of life. #There is a need-fulfilling anaclitic relationship between the child and its object, which is based on the child's imperative body needs. It has a naturally fluctuating character as the need for the object increases with the arousal of drives, but the importance of the object for the child is reduced when satisfaction has been reached. The extent to which the child's needs are satisfied is thought to determine the images of a good and a bad mother. This stage of the developmental line starts at the second half of the first year of life. #The stage of object constancy: the child achieves a consistent representation of the mother, which can be maintained irrespective of the satisfaction of drives: thus, the representation of the mother is more stable. The child becomes able to form reciprocal relationships that can survive disappointments and frustrations. #The toddler's positive and negative feelings are focused on the same person and become visible (known as the 'terrible twos'). The child is in conflict: wishing both to be independent and to retain the complete devotion of the mother. In this stage, ambivalence is considered to be normal. #The so-called phallic-oedipal phase: this stage is object-centred, characterized by possessiveness of the parent of the opposite sex and jealousy and rivalry with the same sex parent. The child becomes aware that there are aspects of the relationship between the parents from which he is excluded. #The latency period: the urgency of the child's drives is reduced and there is a transfer of libido from parents to peers and others in the child's social environment and the community. #The preadolescent prelude to the 'adolescent revolt'. A regression from the reasonableness of latency children to a demanding, contrary, inconsiderate attitude characteristic of earlier stages, especially the part-object, need-fulfilling and ambivalent attitudes in behaviour. This strengthens oral, anal and phallic drive components, reviving infantile fantasies and intensifying intra-psychic conflict. #Adolescence: representing the ego's struggle to master the upsurge of sexuality and aggression during this period. Two new defence mechanisms (intellectualization and asceticism) emerge in adolescence to defend the individual from the instinctual demands of the body. The adolescent is preoccupied with its internal struggle to transfer emotional investment from parents to new objects. Examples of other developmental lines *suckling to rational eating *wetting and soiling to bladder and bowel control *irresponsibility to responsibility in body management * play: from body to toy to interpersonal activity to reading/sports/etc. Developmental lines and psychopathology Anna Freud, in conceptualising the developmental lines was aware that children could not be expected to proceed evenly across all lines. As the forces determining the child's development are external as well as internal and largely outside the child's control, minor 'developmental disharmonies' are to be expected. However, gross disharmony can predispose to severe psychopathology, neurosis and non-neurotic personality disorders. Anna Freud outlines several examples of phase specific developmental disturbances with reference to the basic line delineated above. As such, in phase 1, an infringement of the biological mother-infant tie for whatever reason, for example through death or neglect, can lead to separation anxiety proper. Similarly, a serious failure on the mother's behalf to be reliable, need fulfilling and comfort-giving in phase 2 will cause breakdowns in individuation. Unsatisfactory libidinal relations to unstable love objects during phase 4 will disturb the balanced integration of libido and aggression which can lead to uncontrollable aggressive behaviour and destructiveness. The framework of developmental lines has been very helpful in allowing us to track 'normal' and 'abnormal' development and has led to some interesting practical lessons. For example, Anna Freud writes that the clinging attitudes at the toddler stage (phase 4) are the result of pre-oedipal ambivalence, not of maternal spoiling as was thought. Further, in the pre-oedipal period (end of phase 4) parents cannot expect a mutuality in object relations as this belongs to the next phase and similarly, no child can be fully integrated in school before libido has been transferred from the parents to the community (phase 6). Developmental lines can also be useful in making predictions as to when particular events will have the greatest impact. For example, she lists the later part of phase 6 as one in which reactions to adoption would be particularly severe. This being because with the normal disillusionment with the parents, all children feel as if adopted and feelings about the reality of the adoption merge with the occurrence of ‚Äúthe family romance‚Äù. The developmental profile On the basis of the concept of developmental lines Anna Freud developed the 'developmental profile'. The profile aims to classifying the individual within a diagnostic schema. A more detailed examination of the internal picture of the child which contains information about: the structure of the personality, the dynamic interplay within the structure, some economic factors concerning drive activity and the relative strength of id and ego forces, the adaptation to reality; and some genetic assumptions. A developmental profile consists of the following parts: #Reasons (and circumstances) for referral. Description of symptoms. #Description of the child #Family background (past and present) and personal history #Possibly significant environmental circumstances #Assessment of development #Assessment of fixation points and regressions #Assessment of the conflicts #Assessment of some general characteristics #Diagnosis  See also  * Anna Freud * Psychoanalysis ReferencesFurther reading  Category:Psychoanalysis ","title":"Developmental lines"},{"id":"4454351","text":"Zaveri is an Indian surname, mainly found among the Gujarati people.

History The first transmission of racing on the channel was on 22 March 1984 from Doncaster, as it took over midweek coverage which had previously been on ITV. On 5 October 1985, it took over ITV's Saturday afternoon coverage (previously The ITV Seven) when World of Sport finished. From the beginning of 1986, however, the amount of racing covered, especially on Saturday afternoons, was substantially reduced, and not until the late 1990s would it reach the scale it had enjoyed when it was on ITV. End of Channel 4 Racing On 1 January 2016 it was announced that Channel 4 had lost their horse racing rights after 32 years to ITV who would have exclusive free to air rights to British horse racing from 1 January 2017. The reason for the change was said to be that ratings had dipped for most of the big meetings that used to be broadcast on the BBC up to 2012 since the move to Channel 4. Under the new deal ITV will show a minimum of 40 days of horse racing live on ITV with a further 60 days a year live on ITV4 with ITV Sport also producing their own coverage rather than Independent Producers. Initially, it was announced that Channel 4 would broadcast their final day of horse racing on 31 December 2016, with the rights moving to ITV on the following day. It was announced at the start of December 2016 however that the last day of racing would not be on 31 December. Owing to logistical problems, the last day of Channel 4 Racing was on 27 December 2016, when Channel 4 screened action from Kempton‚Äôs Christmas meeting as well as the Welsh Grand National from Chepstow. As New Year's Eve fell on a Saturday that year, this meant it was the first Saturday in recent memory that horse racing was not shown on terrestrial television. Instead, pay channel Racing UK made its coverage available free to air for the day. Coverage Major UK events covered by Channel 4 included the 1,000 Guineas and 2,000 Guineas at Newmarket, the Derby and Oaks from Epsom and the St Leger at Doncaster, Royal Ascot and the Cheltenham Festival. These events have moved between the BBC and ITV over the years. Internationally, it has covered the Breeders' Cup in the United States of America, the Prix de l'Arc de Triomphe in France and the Dubai World Cup in the UAE. Recent portfolio Channel 4 Racing mainly, but not exclusively, featured meetings from the Racing UK courses having initially signed a three-year contract which ran between 1 January 2007 and 31 December 2009 - the contract guaranteed 80 days of racing each year on Channel 4.Channel 4 contract signed Racing UK Coverage is sponsored by Dubai. From 2013, Channel 4 Racing became the exclusive home of free-to-air televised racing, having signed a four-year deal in March 2012. Coverage included all major races including The Derby, Cheltenham Festival and for the first time on Channel 4, the Grand National and Royal Ascot, and international races including the Dubai World Cup and the Prix de l'Arc de Triomphe. The Morning Line The Morning Line was a Saturday morning look at the day's live horse racing on Channel 4. It provided tips and advice for the forthcoming day's racing. The show featured contributions from a panel of racing pundits. Every Saturday the team of pundits had a virtual ¬£100 with which they make their charity bet selections for the day. Presenters Since its inception in 1984, Channel 4 Racing featured many of racing's best known journalists and presenters, including Derek Thompson, Lesley Graham, John Francome, John Oaksey, John McCririck, Brough Scott, Mike Cattermole and Stewart Machin. The line-up was refreshed by new production company IMG Sports Media in 2013. Former BBC anchor Clare Balding led coverage of major festivals such as Cheltenham, Aintree and Royal Ascot, whilst the rest of the time coverage was fronted by Nick Luck. Alice Plunkett and Emma Spencer filled in as presenters when both Balding and Luck were absent, and also served as interviewers and reporters on the programme alongside Gina Harding and Rishi Persad. Jim McGrath, Graham Cunningham, Mick Fitzgerald and occasionally former champion jockey AP McCoy provided analysis, whilst Tanya Stevenson, Brian Gleeson and Tom Lee were the programme's betting correspondents. After 2000 the senior commentator was Simon Holt, while Richard Hoiles commentated either at the second most important meeting of the day, or filled in for Holt when he was absent. Very occasionally Hoiles also acted as main presenter of the programme. Ian Bartlett was usually the third choice commentator.

It is based on the clinical observation that adult personality characteristics often bear a considerable similarity to the behavioural patterns of early childhood. Thus the psychoanalytical developmental theories and the classification of behaviour are integrated in the developmental profile. The developmental profile is a matrix consisting of 10 developmental levels (horizontal rows) and nine developmental levels (vertical columns). Each line describes various categories of behaviour and for each line there are various phases in the development of the psychosocial capacities. The lowest six levels refer to maladaptive behaviour. The information for the developmental profile is obtained using a semi-structured interview that explores the patient's habitual behaviour during the previous decade. A developmental profile can be made using a registration protocol. The information from filling in the developmental profile provides guidelines with respect to the goals of treatment and the manner in which they can be pursued. It can also be useful in understanding the behaviour of a patient. Robert B. McCall, Mark I. Appelbaum, and Pamela S. Hogarty argue that \\"since there is no necessary relation between cross-age correlations and the nature of developmental profile contrours, and since individual subjects can display marked changes even though cross-age correlations are high, the investigation of change in developmental profile of mental performance should be considered a separate and important issue.Robert B.

Its inhabitants are called Cucuronnais. Located on the south side of the Luberon mountain range, Cucuron is surrounded by slopes of grapevines and olive trees. There are several cooperatives in the village, including for wine and olive oil production. The present village dates from earlier than the 11th century and suffered a serious plague epidemic in 1720. Its primary features are a long pond (l'√©tang) that occupies its main square, the ruins of a medieval keep, and two churches. Cucuron features in two movies: A Good Year and The Horseman on the Roof (French: Le hussard sur le toit). Geography Cucuron is located on the south side of the Luberon mountain range and includes most of the northern slope of the Aigues valley, sloping gently towards the south. The rural district of Cucuron is part of the Luberon Regional Park (Parc naturel r√©gional du Luberon). The highest point of the village area is located at its northern end, 1,040 m above sea level, on the crest of the Luberon. The village itself is located on a hill dominating the area, consisting of zaffre, with the highest part of the village proper at 375 m. It is surrounded by slopes of grapevines and vegetable crops, cereals (wheat fields) or abandoned agricultural land. The extreme south of the territory is part of the alluvial plain of the Durance. Several rivers irrigate the village area, this includes the Vabre and Hermitage streams - the latter supplies the village. Plots of land \\"in slices\\" may be legacy areas (villae) of the Gallo-Roman period - two sites have been clearly identified and excavated. Distance from major towns The times given in brackets are estimates which include part of the journey by motorway where relevant. * Pertuis: 12 km (15 minutes) * Apt: 26 km (30 minutes) * Cavaillon: 28 km (45 minutes) * Aix-en-Provence: 37 km (35 minutes) * Marseille: 65 km (55 minutes) * Avignon: 66 km (1 hour) The villages closest to Cucuron are Ansouis (5 km), Vaugines (2.2 km) and Lourmarin (7.4 km). Toponymy Local tradition ascribes the origin of the village name to Julius Caesar, like many Provence villages. Caesar, seeing the inhabitants of the place run, was said to have stated the Latin phrase cur currunt? (\\"Why do they run?\\"). In fact Cucuron, under various spellings, is a common placename in southern France, meaning a peak, mound. Many localities are so named, as well as various villages: Coucouron (Ard√®che), Cuguron (Haute-Garonne), Cuqueron (Pyr√©n√©es-Atlantiques). The village name derives from the pre-indo-European root \\"Kuk\\", which means a place located on a high mountain or a round hill. The village has had various names: castro Cucurone and castro Cucuroau in the 11th century, in tertitorio Cucuronis, of Cucurun in the 12th century, Cucuron from the 16th century. History Looking over the village Ramparts The medieval village site was occupied from the Neolithic period (at a place called Castelas). During protohistory, it was on the territory of the Gauls of Dexcivate, established along the Durance, as indicated by Conch graves. A site on the plain, to the south of the village, dates from the Gallo-Roman period: villas were established there benefiting from the fertile land, with several burial grounds and a mausoleum - the Pourri√®res mausoleum, dates from the 1st century BC. In the Middle Ages, a castrum (castle) was built on the hill by the Reillanne-Valence family: the present village dates from earlier than the 11th century and is quoted for the first time in 1024, under the name of castrum cucurone. The castle passed between the hands of several families of seigneurs (lords): the Sabrans in the 12th century, then the Castillon and the Oraison in co-seigneurship and finally the Bruni from La Tour-d'Aigues at the end of the 18th century. Meanwhile, a \\"consulate\\" was created; the village was consequently administered by \\"consuls\\" which controlled the local justices and lower courts. During the late Middle Ages, Cucuron hosted a Jewish community which was officially expelled in 1501. It also accommodated a Vaudois minority, after they repopulated Luberon at the end of the 15th century. In 1534, the archbishop of Aix-en-Provence executed ten of these 'heretics', which included inhabitants of Cucuron. However, at the time of the French Wars of Religion, Cucuron remained predominantly catholic, unlike the surrounding villages. In 1720-1, the village was hit hard by a plague epidemic which spread from Marseille. Coat of arms Arms of Cucuron The arms are emblazoned with the following: Gules background with a silver tower that has a door and arrowslits. The tower is flanked by two savages with a symmetrical profile, who hold the tower; the one on the right with their right hand, the one on the left with their left hand, their other hands hold a club. Cucuron motto: cucurrunt sed vixerunt (they ran but they overcame) List of mayors Notre-Dame-de-Beaulieu - the village church Church door June 1995 - March 2001 Alain Gardon March 2001 - March 2008 G√©rard Livolsi March 2008 - Roger Deranque Demographics The village had almost 1,000 inhabitants at the beginning of the 14th century and there were nearly 2,000 on the eve of the Great Plague of Marseille of 1720-1. The deaths caused by the plague, however, led to a sharp decline in population in the 18th century, that decline was compounded in the 19th century with rural flight. The inhabitants of the village are called Cucuronnais. Economy There are many traders in the village: a grocers, a tobacco shop, two bakeries and a butcher, a pharmacy, restaurants, bars and a hotel. It has had ADSL (broadband internet) since January 2005. Agriculture The viticulture (vineyards) and vegetable crops (asparagus in particular) found on village land, are from post World War I. The village has several cooperatives: one for cherry jam, an agricultural cooperative for wheat and other grains, a viticultural cooperative, and two olive oil mills open their doors to olive growers in mid- November. The village produces C√¥tes du Luberon AOC wines - AOC stands for Appellation d'origine contr√¥l√©e (controlled designation of origin). Wines which are not AOC can be labelled, after approval, vin de pays d'Aigues.The label vin de pays d'Aigues relates to the following village and towns in the Vaucluse department: Ansouis, Apt, Auribeau, La Bastide-des-Jourdans, La Bastidonne, Beaumettes, Beaumont-de-Pertuis, Bonnieux, Buoux, Cabri√®res-d'Aigues, Cabri√®res-d'Avignon, Cadenet, Caseneuve, Castellet, Cavaillon, Cheval-Blanc, Cucuron, Gargas, Gignac, Gordes, Goult, Grambois, L'Isle-sur-la-Sorgue, Joucas, Lacoste, Lagarde-d'Apt, Lagnes, Lauris, Lioux, Lourmarin, Maubec, M√©nerbes, M√©rindol, Mirabeau, La Motte-d'Aigues, Murs, Opp√®de, Pertuis, Peypin-d'Aigues, Puget, Puyvert, Robion, Roussillon, Rustrel, Saignon, Saint-Martin-de-Castillon, Saint-Martin-de-la-Brasque, Saint- Pantal√©on, Saint-Saturnin-l√®s-Apt, Sannes, Saumane, Sivergues, Taillades, La Tour-d'Aigues, Vaugines, Viens, Villars, Villelaure, Vitrolles-en-Luberon. Like the rest of the surrounding area, olive cultivation is growing in Cucuron. Tourism Ruins As with all municipalities in the Luberon, tourism plays a role, directly or indirectly, in the local economy. There are three main kinds of tourism in the Luberon. Firstly cultural, which relies on a heritage of village hilltops and festivals. Secondly, relaxation tourism which has resulted in a significant development of chambres d'h√¥tes (bed and breakfasts), hotels and rental properties; a large concentration of swimming pools and proven√ßale markets. Lastly, walking holidays which benefit from the footpaths and protected countryside of the Luberon and surrounding area. Education The village has a public elementary school, the pupils are then sent to Le Luberon, a lower secondary school in Cadenet, then Val de Durance lyc√©e (upper secondary school) in Pertuis (mainstream education) or Alexandre Dumas coll√®ge in Cavaillon or Alphonse Benoit college in L'Isle-sur-la-Sorgue (technical education). Local life A market is held on Tuesdays and two major holidays punctuate the life of the village: * the votive festival takes place at the beginning of July. * the Feast of Saint Tulle is held on the first Saturday after May 21: the l'arbre de mai ‚Äútree of May‚Äù - a poplar is transported by men through the village and tied-up the front side of the church. This commemorates the occasion of the 'intervention of the saint' to put an end to the plague of 1720. Four night markets are held each year between the months of July and August, around l'√©tang (the pond), generally the last two Fridays of July and the first two of August. Local craftsmen and producers attend these markets. Scenes from the films The Horseman on the Roof and A Good Year were filmed in the village. Places of interest L'√©tang - a large basin of water in the main square of the village Notre-Dame-de-Beauvoir chapel *Bassin de l'√©tang - a large quadrangular basin of water that dates from the beginning of the 14th century, located at the north of the village: it previously supplied a mill in the village. *Notre-Dame-de-Beaulieu church - partly in Romance style of Provence (13th century), partly in Gothic style. *Notre-Dame-de-Beauvoir chapel (early Romanesque), otherwise known as the Hermitage. Initially a small pilgrimage shrine, annex of the parish, quoted in several wills since 1292. All that remains of the Roman chapel is an arch- shaped vault. The last bay was later transformed into a dwelling. At the beginning of the 17th century it was maintained by a confraternity who built a bell tower in 1602, a hermitage in 1613 and a new nave between 1614 and 1620. The chapel became communal property after the French Revolution and was restored in 1957, then again in the middle of the 1970s. *Medieval walls, with gates and towers, including the belfry, or ‚ÄúClock tower‚Äù - 13th-16th centuries.

It provides evidence of trade with West AsiaGlimpses of life in 12th century South India The Periya Puranam is part of the corpus of Shaiva canonical works. Sekkizhar compiled and wrote the Periya Puranam or the Great Purana in Tamil about the life stories of the sixty-three Shaiva Nayanars, poets of the God Shiva who composed the liturgical poems of the Tirumurai, and was later himself canonised and the work became part of the sacred canon.A Dictionary of Indian Literature By Sujit Mukherjee. Among all the hagiographic Puranas in Tamil, Sekkizhar's Tiruttondar Puranam or Periyapuranam, composed during the rule of Kulottunga Chola II (1133-1150) stands first.Medieval Indian Literature By K. Ayyappapanicker, Sahitya Akademi.  Background  Sekkizhar was a poet and the chief minister in the court of the Chola King, Kulothunga Chola II. Kulottunga Chola II, king Anabaya Chola, was a staunch devotee of Lord Siva Natraja at Chidambaram. He continued the reconstruction of the center of Tamil Saivism that was begun by his ancestors. However Kulottunga II was also enchanted by the Jain courtly epic, Chivaka Chinthamani an epic of erotic flavour (sringara rasa) whose hero, Chivaka, combines heroics and erotics to marry eight damsels and gain a kingdom. In the end he realises the transiency of possessions, renounces his kingship and finally attains Nirvana by prolonged austerity (tapas).Criminal Gods and Demon Devotees By Alf Hiltebeitel. In order to wean Kulottunga Chola II from the heretical Chivaka Chintamani, Sekkizhar undertook the task of writing the Periyapuranam.  Periyapuranam  The study of Chivaka Chintamani by Kulottunga Chola II, deeply affected Sekkizhar who was very religious in nature. He exhorted the king to abandon the pursuit of impious erotic literature and turn instead to the life of the Saiva saints celebrated by Sundaramurti Nayanar and Nambiyandar Nambi. The king thereupon invited Sekkizhar to expound the lives of the Saiva saints in a great poem. As a minister of the state Sekkizhar had access to the lives of the saints and after he collected the data, he wrote the poem in the Thousand Pillared Hall of the Chidambaram temple. Legend has it that the Lord himself provided Sekkizhar with the first feet of the first verse as a divine voice from the sky declaring \\"‡Æâ‡Æ≤‡Æï‡ØÜ‡Æ≤‡Ææ‡ÆÆ‡Øç\\" (ulakelam: All the world). This work is considered the most important initiative of Kulottunga Chola II's reign. Although, it is only a literary embellishment of earlier hagiographies of the Saiva saints composed by Sundarar and Nambiyandar Nambi, it came to be seen as the epitome of high standards of the Chola culture, because of the highest order of the literary style.The Home of Dancing ≈öivanÃ≤ By Paul Younger. The Periyapuranam is considered as a fifth Veda in Tamil and immediately took its place as the twelfth and the last book in the Saiva canon. It is considered as one of the masterpieces of the Tamil literature and worthily commemorates the Golden age of the Cholas.  Significance  All the saints mentioned in this epic poem are historical persons and not mythical. Therefore, this is a recorded history of the 63 Saiva saints called as Nayanmars (devotees of Lord Siva), who attain salvation by their unflinching devotion to Siva. The Nayanmars that he talks about belonged to different castes, different occupations and lived in different times.

A keen South Melbourne supporter he attended a preseason training with the club but was told his services would not be necessary. He returned to Ballarat and played locally with Golden Point. He was spotted by Geelong recruiters and he was invited to try out with Geelong. VFL career Nicknamed \\"Woofa\\", Davis was recruited from Golden Point in the Ballarat Football League and played with the Geelong Football Club in the VFL from 1948 to 1958, generally as a half-forward flanker. He made his debut in the opening round of 1948, on a two match permit issued by his club Golden Point. He missed the next two games because Golden Point refused to clear him.

Programming is simulcast on WRCK 1480 kHz in Remsen, New York. Two FM translators also carry the programming, 95.5 MHz W238CA in Utica, relaying WUSP, and 94.1 MHz W231DZ Remsen, relaying WRCK. The stations are owned by the Utica Phoenix, a local alternative newspaper, and air an urban contemporary - hip hop music radio format.  WUSP History  In 1962, WBVM 1550 signed on, owned by Michael and Danial Fusco.Broadcasting Yearbook 1963 page B-127 WBVM was named after the Blessed Virgin Mary. It was a 1,000 watt daytimer, required to go off the air at night to avoid interfering with CBE Windsor, Ontario, the Class I-A station on AM 1550. WBVM became WUTQ in 1980. From the late 1990s onward, WUTQ and sister station WADR were two of the four stations collectively known as the \\"Sports Stars Radio Network,\\" a collection of four AM radio stations (WLFH Little Falls and WRNY Rome being the others) carrying a mix of local and national sports talk. When station owner Clear Channel Communications exited most of its small markets in 2007, the network was broken up: WLFH (now WIXT) and WRNY went to Galaxy Communications (who joined them with WTLB to form a new sports network) while WUTQ and WADR were sold to Ken Roser and became full-service outlets. In 2012, Roser moved WUTQ's programming to FM 100.7, which was rechristened WUTQ-FM. On July 27, 2012, it was announced that Good Guys Broadcasting Corporation, a company led by two former executives at WKTV, would be purchasing WRCK and WUTQ from Roser and converting the two stations to sports radio. The purchase was consummated on December 21, 2012, at a purchase price of $350,000. The stations then began airing programming from Sports Byline USA and the USA Radio Network, with Tom Coyne (one of the two stations' owners) hosting morning drive and longtime radio host Hank Brown returning for his third stint at the station in middays. Since April 2014, the late morning timeslot has featured the Mohawk Valley Memories musical program, featuring music from the 1940s up to the 1980s. Sports included the New York Mets and the New England Patriots. The stations' previous format moved to FM 100.7 and kept the WUTQ call sign and branding, while the former WUTQ was renamed WUSP. Ethnic/specialty programming such as \\"The Saturday Polka Review\\" Polish/American show with Gary Sroka, \\"Radio 202\\" Bosnian Radio Show, The 95.5FM Hispanic Show, all on Saturday, and on Sunday; \\"The Family Rosary Radio\\" followed by \\"The Voice Of The New Italy\\" were retained by WUSP. (When WUSP ceased operations, \\"Radio 202\\" and \\"The Voice of New Italy\\" both returned to WUTQ; Sroka took his polka show to WHCL.) In August 2013, WUSP/WRCK dropped its Sports Byline USA affiliation and affiliated with CBS Sports Radio and Yahoo! Sports Radio. On August 5, 2015, WUSP and WRCK both went silent as a result of financial and some ongoing technical problems. The ownership's last public statement was to quote the last line of \\"A Visit from Saint Nicholas\\" (\\"merry Christmas to all, and to all a good night.\\") put out through its social media pages on Christmas Eve 2015. As of July 2017, the WUSP and WRCK licenses were still active but silent. Good Guys Broadcasting was attempting to sell the stations and had sustained major financial losses during their ownership, having temporarily turned the stations back on to keep the license operational on June 28, 2017.https://www.allaccess.com/net- news/archive/story/167495 Effective March 16, 2018, WUSP found a buyer in Phoenix Radio, Inc, a Utica, New York-based corporation owned by Cassandra Harris-Lockwood, CEO.https://www.955theheat.com/contact.html Ms. Harris- Lockwood is also CEO and president of For The Good, Inc and Editor-in-Chief of the successful Utica Phoenix newsmagazine in continuous publication since 2002. (It is not to be confused with William \\"Wolf\\" Berry's \\"Phoenix Radio\\" that operated radio stations in the Southern Tier of New York.) The purchase, at a price of $125,000, also included WUSP's translator on 95.5 FM.https://www.allaccess.com/net-news/archive/story/168074 WRCK History WRCK was known as WREM from its sign on in 1958 by owners Ed Slusarczyk and Jerry Prouty, until 1966, when it became WADR. WREM was unusual in that it used a shunt fed antenna. 1480 had simulcast 1550 since the late 1990s. In 2012, WADR was renamed WRCK, parking the call letters that had previously been used on FM 107.3 (now a K-Love owned-and-operated station as WKVU). On June 26, 2018, the station separated from WUSP and went silent. On May 31, 2019, WRCK went back on the air in order to keep the license active and perform equipment testing. The station had a \\"we play anything\\" type format during this period. In early November 2019, WRCK launched translator W231DZ 94.1 and began airing \\"Up Music Radio,\\" a Christian Contemporary format. Studios were located at the Big Apple Music Plaza in New Hartford, New York.

She is believed to have danced the LƒÅsya in response to the male energy of the cosmic dance of Tandava performed by Lord Shiva. In a literal sense, LƒÅsya means beauty, happiness, enchanting, and grace. Professor Inayat Khan in his book \\"Munqar Musicar\\"(1912) wrote: \\"Women and men both perform this dance and there are a number of recognized masters (ustad) of it in India. Lasya is accompanied by two sarangi players and a tabid, and sometimes a manjira (small indian cymbals).

It is associated with the dance of women because Parvati, the consort of Lord Shiva taught it to Usha (daughter of Sage Banasura). Then she passed on this art to women. LƒÅsya is mainly of four types: SHRINKALA, LATA, PINDI and BHEDYAKA.Dictionary of Hindu Lore and Legend () by Anna Dallapiccola Etymology The Indian classical music terminology talam has been etymologically derived from the union of the dances of both Lord Shiva and Goddess Parvati (Tandavam and Lasyam).

LajjƒÅ Gaurƒ´ is a lotus-headed Hindu goddess associated with abundance, fertility and sexuality, sometimes euphemistically described as Lajja (\\"modesty\\"). She is sometimes shown in a birthing posture, but without outward signs of pregnancy.\\"Lotus-Headed Fertility Goddess Lajja Gauri\\". Metropolitan Museum of Art. Accessed 24 June 2018 History Early depictions of Lajja Gauri in Shaktism cults were found in the Indus Valley seals, though her later depiction dates to the 1st-3rd centuries, and her worship is prevalent in the Deccan, a region of the Indian subcontinent. Iconography Her fertility aspect is emphasized by symbolic representation of the genitals, Yoni or the Womb, as blooming Lotus flower denoting blooming youth in some cases and in others through a simple yet detailed depiction of an exposed vulva. Added to the fact that she is sitting in a squatting position (malasana) with legs open, as in during childbirth, in some cases, the right foot is placed on a platform to facilitate full opening. She is invoked for abundant crops (vegetative fertility) and good progeny. A blossoming lotus replaces her head and neck, an icon often used in Tantra. The seven Chakras of human energy anatomy are often depicted as blossoming lotuses, and the Goddess is often depicted in her Sri Yantra as a Yoni, shown as a simplified triangle at the centre. Further, most fertility goddesses of the Ancient world are similarly shown headless, while giving prominent focus to the genitals.Iconography Of The Goddesses The arms of the goddess are bent upwards, each holding a lotus stem, held at the level of the head again depicted by the matured lotus flower. Owing to an absence of verifiable text in Vedic traditions on the iconography, she doesn‚Äôt seem to hold any exalted position in Hindu pantheon, despite her strong presence throughout India, especially in the tribal region of Bastar in Central India and downwards to the South, suggesting that the goddess had a cult of her own. The goddess is sometimes called Lajja Gauri, interpreted by some as the Innocent Creatrix, the Creator deity Book Review Forms of the Goddess Lajja Gauri in Indian Art, by Carol Radcliffe Bolon. 1992. . or at times simply \\"Headless Goddess\\", or Aditi Uttanapada Aditi Uttanapada (Lajja Gauri): Creatrix and Regenrator Images of Indian Goddesses: Myths, Meanings, and Models, by Madhu Bazaz Wangu.

Another interpretation as suggested by Dr. Ramachandra C.

It was established in order to counter the influence of the Black Hand, and relied on the People's Radical Party. Background The May Coup (1903) which overthrew Aleksandar Obrenoviƒá was orchestrated by Dragutin Dimitrijeviƒá (called \\"Apis\\") and his group of lower officers, among whom were Petar ≈Ωivkoviƒá. Petar Karaƒëorƒëeviƒá was crowned King of Serbia, and in contrast to the Austrophile Obrenoviƒá dynasty, Karaƒëorƒëeviƒá relied on Russia and France, which provoked rising hostility from Austria-Hungary. The conspiracy group had toppled Obrenoviƒá on the pretext of pursuing the liberation and unification of Serb lands (Pan- Serbism). The retirement of some of the conspirators involved in the May Coup eventually led to the division of the conspiratory group into two quarreling sides: the conspirators that stayed behind the dynasty and those who stood against it; the first was close to the court and government, the second dissatisfied. The split began in 1906, and subsequently spilled over into the Army. Serbian crown prince Aleksandar and Apis had disagreements, and ≈Ωivkoviƒá and Apis had a falling-out. ≈Ωivkoviƒá accused Apis and other members of libel. The division brought about the establishment of the Black Hand and White Hand. The dissatisfied group established Unification or Death (the Black Hand) in 1911. History Military officers led by Colonel Petar ≈Ωivkoviƒá established the White Hand organization in the Belgrade hotel \\"Paris\\", in 1912. The organization held itself as the defender of the dynasty and state from anarchy and pressures. The organization managed to attract many of Apis' opponents and indecisives. Some time prior to the abdication of Petar I, crown prince Aleksandar joined up with the White Hand and Nikola Pa≈°iƒá's People's Radical Party. Pa≈°iƒá was unsatisfied with the politics during the Balkan Wars. With the demise of the Black Hand in the Salonika Trial (1917), the White Hand steadily gained control of the young and ambitious Prince Alexander. ≈Ωivkovic was made the head of the Palace Guard in 1921, and started amassing power. In 1929, King Alexander I, along with officers of the White Hand orchestrated a coup in attempt to control the growing nationalist tensions in the country (especially in Croatia) and the instability of the Parliament. ≈Ωivkoviƒá, now a general, was appointed Prime Minister. The autocracy was eased in 1931, when the King re-instated some constitutional rights after his reforms completely failed in their purpose, and ≈Ωivkoviƒá lost his position in 1932 after organizing numerous show trials against minority leaders, ultra-nationalist groups, and communists. The members of White Hand are also suspected of being involved in the abdication of heir-apparent Prince George in favour of Alexander (1909), the installment of Alexander as a regent during the reign of Peter I, as well as the coup of March 27, 1941 which placed the underage King Peter II Karaƒëorƒëeviƒá in power, effectively putting Yugoslavia in a state of war with Germany. With the victory of the communist forces of Josip Broz Tito during Second World War, members of the White Hand were either executed by the new regime, or fled abroad.

It was the site of a gold rush from November 1859 and up to 16,000 people were on the site. The lead was worked for a distance of nearly 3 miles (5 km) to the point where it ran into the water and was abandoned. Gold history In August 1859, the Mining Surveyor at Maryborough reported Lamplough as a \\"grand attraction; hundreds of miners are arriving daily from the more remote gold-fields. The yield of gold,together with the large extent of the already proven auriferous ground, indicates that the Lamplough presents every appearance of being the largest rush we have yet had in Victoria.\\" MaryBHstry In January 1860, the surveyor reported that \\"Lamplough may safely be classed amongst the permanent and payable gold fields of Victoria\\". He did note that the field was overpopulated, particularly by those in business pursuits: \\"there appears to be nearly one place of business to each miner‚Äôs tent\\". In March 1860, the surveyor reported: \\"Lamplough, during the last few weeks, presents the appearance of one of the settled gold fields. The late departures to the Inglewood rush have materially improved its condition by withdrawing a portion of its surplus population, such as unsuccessful miners, storekeepers, &c.; It may safely be presumed that those now remaining are all making at least a good livelihood\\". In June 1860 he reported: \\"At Lamplough, the Deep Lead (with the exception of minor rushes in the immediate neighbourhood) offers sufficient inducements to remain. The lead appears still to adhere (as originally) to the southern reef, neither do the workings get into deeper or wet ground. It has been found payable more than two miles in length from the original prospectors‚Äô claim, and three claims in width, the average yield being an ounce to the load, with one foot thickness of wash-dirt\\". July 1860: \\"The Lamplough Deep Lead is steadily progressing. Several other shallow workings upon adjacent hills, and many of the neighbouring gullies, are being prosecuted; but, from what I can ascertain, are only attended with wages results. The population at Lamplough is rather on the increase, principally from Inglewood. A new rush occurred a few days ago about eight miles from Lamplough, on the Lexton road; but in the absence of any payable ground (except the prospectors) having been discovered, it has nearly subsided again\\". September 1860: \\"At Lamplough I cannot note any material change in mining since my last. Several of the small rushes in the immediate vicinity appear to give remunerative employment to a large number of miners whilst water for washing purposes is easily obtained; but in the absence of any natural or artificial means for securing it in this dry part of the district, and that when the present supply is exhausted, I predict a considerable decrease in their numbers will result\\". In November 1860: \\"Lamplough (with occasional small rushes, either to the deep lead or to the immediate vicinity) still retains its population.\\" In January 1861, the report was quite different: \\"The population at the new diggings (Mountain Creek) is yet daily increasing, and from the fact of payable ground having already been found extending over a large area, together with new discoveries of frequent occurrence, .... Lamplough, and all the other sections of my division (in consequence of this rush), are now quite denuded of their European alluvial mining population\\". In March 1864, 160 alluvial miners were reported to be working at Lamplough of a total of 1,605 miners working within the Avoca Division. This number remained fairly steady until the end of 1866 and in 1867 shrunk to 70 miners. In 1869, a company was mining in the area. Next gold rush The next rush was to Moonambel, then known as Mountain Creek at the end of the Pyrenees Ranges, north of Avoca.

Buisson is a small, wine-producing, Knights Templar village, dating back at least as far as the 12th century, and linked since its beginning to the nearby village of Villedieu, with which it produces its principal crop, C√¥tes-du-Rh√¥ne wine, which is sold from their joint winery, le Cellier du Templier. Geography Situated above the Aygues River, Buisson lies at the northern edge of the Vaucluse and within sight of the southern border of the Dr√¥me, the d√©partement immediately to its north. Located 9 km (5 mi) northwest of the small, ancient city of Vaison-la-Romaine, known as \\"the French Pompeii,\\" Buisson is one of fourteen communes surrounding that city that share its postal address: 84110 Vaison-la-Romaine. Economy Besides its wine, Buisson produces in small quantities such products as olives, apricots, cherries, figs, lavender, and numerous other vegetables and fruits. It is situated above the same valley as Nyons, the ancient olive capital of France, and within an hour's drive of the Mediterranean, from which fresh-caught seafood is brought to neighboring markets at Vaison, Valr√©as, Nyons, Malauc√®ne, and Tulette, as well as to the nearby cities of Carpentras, Orange, Avignon, and L'Isle-sur-la-Sorgue. Sights Buisson, whose population rises to approximately 360 inhabitants in summer, is a pretty, typically Proven√ßal village, whose annual wine f√™te occurs in July. Its physical attractions include an intact, inner medieval walled section with two entrances, one of which housed a 14th-century portcullis; a church dating from at least the 12th century, Notre Dame Del Bois, whose northern yard affords views of the entire region; and two lavoirs, one, on its main plaza, with an attractive fountain. The site of Buisson's medieval castle now includes a large residence, which was constructed several centuries after the original structure disappeared.

The Tern oilfield is an oilfield situated north east of Lerwick, Shetland Islands, Scotland, in block numbers 210/25a. History The Tern field was discovered in April 1975 in a water depth of . It started production in 1989. Until July 2008, the oilfield was operated by Royal Dutch Shell and licensed by Shell/Esso. On 7 July 2008, it was purchased by TAQA Bratani, a subsidiary of the Abu Dhabi National Energy Company, along with the Eider, North Cormorant, Cormorant Alpha, Kestrel and Pelican fields and related sub-sea satellite fields. Reserves and geology Estimated recovery of Tern oilfield is of oil. The oil has a gravity of 34¬∞API. Structurally, it is a triangular uplifted block of the Brent Group bounded by NNW-SSE and NNE-SSW trending faults and sealed by overlying Kimmeridge Clay (the dominant source rock, with debated contributions from the much deeper Old Red Sandstone) and Shetland Group mudstones. Tern oil platform The Tern oil platform is a steel jacket production and drilling platform. It was built by RGC Offshore at Methil yard and was installed in May 1988. As well as processing the fluids from the Tern reservoir, the platform also processes fluids from the Hudson, Falcon and Kestrel fields. Once processed, the oil is co-mingled and exported to Sullom Voe Terminal via the North Cormorant and Cormorant Alpha platforms by the Brent System pipeline. Well fluids from the Tern wellheads are routed to two parallel separation trains, Train A and Train B.Hydrocarbon Facilities - Oil Process and Export System diagram (March 2000) Train A comprises a 3-phase (oil, gas and produced water) Production Separator. Separated oil is routed to a 2-phase (oil and produced water) Train A Dehydrator where further produced water is removed. Oil from the Dehydrator is cooled and pumped via a metering skid to the export pipeline. Train B comprises a 3-phase Production Separator from which oil is cooled, pumped and mixed with Train A oil prior to metering. Well fluids from the Hudson field are routed to the 3-phase Hudson Production Separator. Separated oil can be routed through the 2-phase Hudson Dehydrator and thence to coolers and segregated metering prior to mixing with the Train A and B oil prior to export. Produced water from the Production Separators and Dehydrators is treated before disposal overboard. Gas from the Separators is co-mingled and compressed in three stages of compression. Fuel gas is taken from the discharge of the second stage of compression. Compressed gas is used for gas- lifting both the Tern and Hudson oil production wells. Gas is treated in a treatment packing prior to metering and export by pipeline. The Hudson Field which is located in 210/24, started producing over the platform in 1993. The peak production was 4.70 million tonnes per year. The Tern platform later added the Kestrel Field, located in 211/21a, this small subsea tieback started production in 2001. The latest addition to the Tern was Cladhan which started producing in 2017.

By 1988 this had increased to 30 and by 2010 to 103 theatre companies, some of which are outside of the UK. The major restriction for membership is that it is open only to those amateur theatres that own or lease the theatre premises upon which productions are mounted. Similar to the National Drama Festivals Association, the LTG organises festivals of amateur drama across the United Kingdom.

Some of these theatres have undergone name changes since they were formed and some have sadly been dissolved. Aims of the Guild The aims of the Guild are: * To extend close co-operation between members in all areas of theatre; to organise national and regional conferences and seminars. * To run regular courses to improve standards and theatrical knowledge. * To act as the co-ordinating body for the development of little theatres, and to lobby on their behalf on matters of national interest, such as Taxation, Charity status, licensing, sponsorship, insurance and royalties. * To help and improve relationships with local authorities and regional arts associations. * To provide a forum for the exchange of ideas regionally, nationally and internationally. * To ensure that the voice of the little theatre movement is heard strongly within national and international bodies, including the Central Council for Amateur Theatre (CCAT) and the International Theatre Exchange (ITE).

It solves the same problem as tools such as JAXB, XMLBeans and JDOM, but uses an alternate approach. It lets developers work with data from XML documents using arbitrarily defined Plain Old Java Objects (POJOs). The JiBX framework uses a binding definition to tell it how the Java objects map to the XML and vice versa. It is designed to perform the translation between internal data structures and XML with very high efficiency, and has been claimed to be the fastest XML data binding framework for Java. JiBX differs from other Java-XML transformation tools such as JAXB, XMLBeans and JDOM in that it is not based on code generation but on \\"Mapped Data Binding\\". In other words, the Java class and the XML document being mapped are both treated as first class objects and one is not generated from the other. This approach decouples the domain model (Java) from the service interface (input and output XML documents) in a way that is consistent with the goals of Service-Oriented Architecture (SOA). Like traditional Java-XML tools, the JiBX framework can produce a set of Java classes but unlike most other XML binding tools for Java, JiBX does not require this step.

The game places Bhogavati in Thailand, and depicts the nƒÅga as giant, venom spitting lizards which inspired the later myths.

The lectures embodied an attempt by Mr. Lewis, an early student of the Stanislavski System, or \\"method\\" of acting, to dispel what he considered to be myths and misinformation surrounding the various interpretations of Stanislavski, which had all become popularly, and in some cases inaccurately, known as \\"The Method.\\" The Book The book, Method -- Or Madness? by Robert Lewis was published in 1958 by Samuel French, Inc..

It is located in the Northgate neighborhood on Interstate 5, adjacent to Northgate Way and the Northgate Transit Center, a future light rail station. The mall is anchored by Bed Bath & Beyond, DSW, and Nordstrom Rack. Northgate opened in 1950 as one of the first modern shopping centers to be built in the post-war United States. The mall was developed by Allied Stores and was initially an open-air facility until being renovated in the 1970s. History Northgate Mall started as an open-air retail hub in the northern environs of Seattle. It was one of the first post-war, suburban mall-type shopping centers in the United States and originally went by the name of \\"Northgate Center\\", in light of its location at the north edge of Seattle (and being beyond the city limits at the time). It began business with 18 stores in April 1950, anchored by The Bon March√©. By 1952, the fully leased structure housed over seventy tenants, and also included an adjoined four-story Northgate Building medical/dental center and Northgate Theatre, which had seating for over 1,300 guests. Northgate was the first of three malls in the Puget Sound region to be developed by Allied Stores (the parent company of The Bon March√©) and designed by Seattle architect John Graham, Jr. The development was built over part of Thornton Creek, on land that had been a cranberry bog in the Maple Leaf neighborhood. \\"NN-1030S\\", \\"NN-1040S\\".jpg dated June 17, 2002. (1) (2) See heading, \\"Note about limitations of these data\\". Northgate was the first regional shopping center in the United States to be described as a mall, in this instance a double row of stores facing each other across a covered pedestrian walkway. It was also the first mall to have public restrooms. In 1952, Redmond sculptor Dudley C. Carter designed and carved the cedar totem pole that decorated the grand entrance to the central retail corridor, known as the \\"Miracle Mall\\". The shopping center was originally anchored by The Bon March√© (which was acquired by Macy's in 2003; it went by the name Bon-Macy's before the Bon name was retired in 2005). There was also a J.J. Newberry 5 and 10, a Butler Brothers variety store and an A & P Supermarket. Other tenants who signed on early included the National Bank of Commerce (eventually bought by Norwest Corporation and renamed Wells Fargo) and locally-owned Nordstrom's Shoes, which was expanded into a full line clothing store in 1965. Opened as a Best's Apparel, a division of the Nordstrom Company since 1963, it was rebranded as Nordstrom Best in 1967 and Nordstrom in 1973. The 1965 expansion that added the Best's Apparel store also included an extension of the south end of the complex. This was anchored by a new JCPenney and QFC (Quality Food Center) grocery. The \\"Miracle Mall\\" concourse had been partially enclosed within a \\"SkyShield\\" structure added in 1962. This was replaced in 1973 and 1974, with the mall corridor becoming fully enclosed. The official name of the shopping complex was changed to Northgate Mall at this time. Seattle-based department chain Lamonts added a store to the northern end of the concourse in 1977. The mall was renovated again in 1997, with Toys \\"R\\" Us opening a store there in October that year. The food court also underwent renovations, and Sam Goody and Foot Locker also opened stores around this time. The new interior was completed in 1998. Gottschalks acquired the Lamonts chain in 2000 and had a location at the mall until September 2006, before having to close due to underperforming sales. Their former location is currently home to DSW and Bed, Bath and Beyond. The Toys \\"R\\" Us store closed in January 2012 when its lease expired. Their place was taken by Nordstrom Rack the following year. Capitalizing on Northgate's success, Allied Stores commissioned Graham to design the fully enclosed Tacoma Mall (opened 1964) and Tukwila's Southcenter Mall (opened 1968). By 1980, there were 123 stores at Northgate Mall. Construction began in the summer of 2006 on a lifestyle-type addition to the mall. It was completed in early 2008.Wilma (2005) The mall is anchored today by Nordstrom Rack, DSW, and Bed Bath and Beyond. On October 8, 2018, it was announced that JCPenney would be closing in 2019. Macy's subsequently announced in January 2019 that it would also close its store in 2020; the closure was ultimately moved up to July 2019, allegedly at the request of Simon Property Group. Nordstrom closed its Northgate store on August 9, 2019, though the Nordstrom Rack remained open. Approximately 40 stores and restaurants at Northgate will remain open through the redevelopment project. Anchor stores=Current *DSW: since 2008, opened as Lamonts in 1977, renamed Gottschalks in 2000 *Bed Bath & Beyond: since 2008, opened as Lamonts in 1977, renamed Gottschalks in 2000 *Barnes & Noble: since fall 2007 Former *Nordstrom: since 1950, closed in 2019 *JCPenney: since 1950, closed in 2019 *Toys R Us: since 1997, closed in 2012 *Macy's: since 2005: opened as The Bon-Marche, renamed Bon-Macy's in 2003, then converted into Macy's in 2005, closed in 2019 Criminal incidents In 1973, the serial- killer Ted Bundy reportedly apprehended a purse-snatcher late at night in the Northgate Mall parking lot, a few weeks before his first documented murder. Many of his subsequent victims were approached in parking lots. On September 12, 1983, Tracy Ann Winston was abducted from Northgate Mall and murdered by Gary Ridgway, the Green River Killer.http://swopeast.org/?q=node/117 The following year, on April 23, 1984, a seven-man force of The Order attacked an armored car at the mall, after first staging a diversionary bombing.  Redevelopment  In 2006, Simon Properties embarked on an expansion of Northgate Mall, in part because of the city's plan for revitalizing the Northgate neighborhood. The expansion plans included a new outdoor \\"urban- village\\" on the western end of the mall facing Interstate 5. This village opened in November 2007. A new five level parking garage at the south end of the mall provides parking for mall users and additional transit parking. The totem pole at the north entrance of the mall was removed in September 2007. Around the same time, the original Northgate Theatre and 4-story Northgate Building were demolished to make space for new tenants. In 2018, Simon Property Group announced their intention to redevelop the mall into a mixed- use center with hotels, housing, offices and the headquarters and practice facility for the upcoming Seattle Kraken in addition to retail space. The redevelopment will replace several parking lots and be completed after the opening of a nearby light rail station in 2021. Construction on the hockey facility, named the Northgate Ice Centre, began in February 2020 and is planned to be completed in 2021. Location The mall is bounded on the north by NE Northgate Way (formerly NE 110th Street), on the west by 1st Avenue NE, on the south by NE 103rd Street, and on the east by 5th Avenue NE. The Northgate informal district and Northgate Way were both named after the mall.Phelps, p.34; Chapter 16, \\"Street Names and House Numbering\\", pp. 225-235 The original mall has itself become the anchor for development of surrounding apartment buildings, retail and light commercial blocks and community spaces, all now part of a more comprehensive plan for growth such as the opportunities and impacts of transit facilities and the light rail station for the district.(1) Langston, for one example of numerous.

Carcinus aestuarii bears some similarities to Carcinus maenas and was sometimes considered to be a subspecies thereof, rather than a species in its own right, but a molecular biological study using the COI gene found the difference between the two taxa to be substantial, supporting their status as separate species. The two taxa can be visually distinguished by the front of the carapace, between the eyes, which is short and toothed in C. maenas but longer and smoother in C. aestuarii. Also, the gonopods of C. aestuarii are straight and parallel, whereas those of C. maenas are curved. Distribution It is found in the Atlantic Ocean around the Canary Islands, all along the coasts of the Mediterranean and the Black and the Azov Seas including the Suez Canal. As invasive species Whereas C. maenas has invaded many shorelines throughout the world, C. aestuarii has only been implicated in one invasion; the coastline of Japan has been invaded by either C. aestuarii or a hybrid of C. aestuarii and C. maenas. Diet C. aestuarii is an omnivorous predator of small bivalves with soft shells, small crustaceans, annelids as well as being a scavenger of dead aquatic animals. Algae is also part of the diet.

Hephaestion offered it to two brothers with whom he lodged, but they declined it, alleging that according to their laws it could only be worn by one of royal blood. Instead, they named Abdalonymus, who, notwithstanding his birth, had fallen into such poverty that he supported himself by the cultivation of a kitchen garden. Hephaestion directed the brothers to carry the royal crown and robes to Abdalonymus. They obeyed and found him weeding in his garden. After causing him to wash, they invested him with the ensigns of royalty and conducted him to Alexander. This prince, who discerned in him an aspect not unworthy of his origin, turning to those around him, said \\"I wish to know how he bore his poverty.\\"--\\"Would to heaven,\\" replied Abdalonymus, \\"I may as well bear my prosperity! These hands have ministered to all my necessities, and as I possessed nothing, I wanted nothing.\\" Alexander was so well pleased with this reply, that he confirmed the nomination of Hephaestion, and gave the new king the palace and private estate of Strato his predecessor, and even augmented his dominions from the neighboring country. The so-called \\"Alexander Sarcophagus\\", discovered near Sidon and now in the Istanbul Archaeological Museum, is now generally thought to be that of Abdalonymus, though some scholars now believe the sarcophagus was that of Mazaeus, a Persian noble and governor of Babylon. While Quintus Curtius confirms this story, as does Justin, Diodorus calls this person Ballonimus, and says he was made king of Tyre, not Sidon.xvii. 46.

The salt mine is closed for extraction purposes, but is open for visitors, featuring a microclimate with natural air- conditioning and constant temperature and atmospheric pressure throughout the year. It is made up of two levels, named Unirea and Mihai. Many of the visitors come for its supposed healing effects due to the purity of the air. Throughout the mine you will find various types of equipment for recreational activity such as playground equipment and some ping-pong tables. One area is sectioned off and is used for medical patients with lung cancer to come and rest in. The main elevator shaft is unique in that it has no metallic parts due to rust. After an elevator accident in 2014, minivans are used to spiral visitors up and down. Unirea mine Unirea Salt Mine - map The work for the opening of the Unirea salt mine started in 1938 and the exploitation of the salt from this mine was performed between 1943-1970. The exploitation was done downward from the ceiling to the basis in successive slices of 2.2 meters with a horizontal cutting at the basis and vertically along the walls. The de- rocking was made through shooting. The transportation of the resulting material was effected with the tubs up the shaft using a cage to the installation of preparation and expedition. The Unirea mine chamber - notice the trapezoidal profile of the chamber and the wooden balcony at the top The mine is composed of 14 chambers with trapezoidal profiles, having a 10 m opening to the ceiling and 32 m to the ground, a height of 54 m and a wall inclination angle of 60 degrees. The shore difference between the surface and the base of the mine is of 208 m and it is covered by the elevator in 90 seconds. Since 2014 the elevator is out of order. The excavated space occupies a volume of 2.9 million m¬≥ and it is extended on a surface of 78,000 m¬≤. After 1970, the mine becomes a touristic objective, offering exceptional natural conditions as a result of its microclimate rich in aerosols, which proved its well-known efficiency in treating the respiratory diseases. The air- conditioning of the mine is natural, with a constant temperature during the whole year of 12 ¬∞C, an atmospheric pressure of 730 mmHg and a humidity with an average of 10% lower than the surface average. Statue of Decebal, in the Genesis Hall One of the chambers is a salt museum named Genesis Hall by its author Iustin NƒÉstase and it hosts the busts in salt of Decebal and Traian. There are also other salt sculptures in the mine, such as the bust of Mihai Eminescu or a bas-relief with Mihai Viteazul, works of the local artist, Oana Brezeanu. Some of the mine chambers were transformed in sport courts where athletes perform their trainings. The ceiling of the mine is bordered by wooden balconies on the whole perimeter. The balconies are used for the circulation of the authorized personnel during the periodical inspection of the stability of the surfaces from the superior zone of the mine construction. The zones with uncertain stability are delimited at the base of the mine, being closed for the public access. Mihai mine Located vertically above the Unirea mine and separated from it by a 40m thick floor, the Mihai level was opened in 1912 and consists of 6 trapezoidal shaped rooms with a 12 m ceiling width, 37 m floor width, 66 m height and a wall inclination angle of 60 degrees. Mining was carried out on a descending track. Until 1942, when the Unirea mine was opened, 462.332 m3 of rock salt had been excavated. This was the first salt mine in Romania provided with electric lighting. After 1970, the Mihai mine has been the host of several national and international aeromodeling contests, occasions on which free access of tourists in the mine is also allowed. Salt dissolution During the fall of 1994 both levels were severely damaged by the natural phenomenon of salt dissolution due to infiltration of ground and pluvial waters, which flooded the Unirea mine. The catastrophic aggressiveness of waters flowing down the shaft gradually created huge cavities and the specialists who evaluated the full scope of the disaster decided to close down the mine. Eugen Scrob, an I.S.P.H. researcher, came up with an idea which was to keep the mine from completely collapsing. He immediately applied a new experimental method, helped by the miners of the Slanic mine. After four years of work, the stream bed was eventually regulated. Constant drillings monitored the dynamics of landslide and the piezometric level. Also, huge amounts of concrete were used to line the shaft and fill the existing cavities. All costs of these works, amounting to a total of over 20 billion Romanian lei (ROL; equivalent to 2 million RON), were exclusively borne by the SlƒÉnic salt mine. After the water was evacuated and the hearth of the flooded mine was completely drained, the site was reopened on July 31, 1998.

He quit the Nazi movement and joined the left-wing party and the peace movement.Renegater - Nils Flyg och Sven Olov Lindholm mellan kommunism och nazism. By Johan Stenfeldt Biography Born in J√∂nk√∂ping Municipality, Lindholm joined the Swedish army at an early age, rising to the rank of Sergeant. Stationed in Stockholm, he was initially drawn to Elof Eriksson, a proto-fascist who emphasised anti-communism and anti- Semitism. He soon joined Konrad Hallgren in setting up the Sveriges Fascistiska Folkparti (Swedish Fascist People's Party) ‚Äì which became known as Sveriges Fascistiska Kamporganisation (Swedish Fascist Combat-Organization) ‚Äì serving as organizer and then leader of the group. Lindholm visited Nuremberg in 1929 and as a consequence abandoned Italian fascism in favour of Nazism and as a result he played a leading role in both the National Socialist People's Party of Sweden and its successor the Swedish National Socialist Party. The 6% Lindholm captured in Gothenburg in the 1932 election represented a high point for the Swedish Nazis. However Lindholm had grown tired of the leadership of Birger Furug√•rd as he had grown more attracted to Strasserism than Furug√•rd's straight Nazism. In 1933 he formed the Nationalsocialistiska Arbetarpartiet to this end. The new group, which adopted the swastika, took, for propaganda reasons, a more anti-capitalist line and organized its own youth group, the Nordisk Ungdom (Nordic Youth). By 1938 Lindholm had become more critical of the government of Germany, and attempted to reorganise the group as a more Swedish version of Nazism, reinventing them as the Svensk Socialistisk Samling (SSS, \\"Swedish Socialist Union\\"). He returned to the army in 1941 as a Fanjunkare in the artillery. He maintained an ambiguous relationship with Germany during war-time, attacking Operation Weser√ºbung, yet also helping to recruit men for Adolf Hitler. During the war, Lindholm and his party was planning for, and in secret hoped for, a German invasion of Sweden that could lead to the creation of a Swedish puppet-state under Lindholm and the party as \\"Swedish Quislings\\". Secret plans to deport Jews and others, and plans to construct camps inside Sweden, was drawn up by the party. They gathered death- lists of hundreds of Jews which was later (probably when Lindholm and the others realized Sweden would remain neutral and that Hitler was losing) hidden well and some most likely destroyed. Such lists was discovered in the 1970s but no documents has been found showing Lindholm was ever questioned about these plans and lists. Svensk Socialistisk Samling continued to be active until 1950, after which Lindholm went into semi-retirement, with only minor involvement in far right youth groups maintaining his activity. In the 1970s and 1980s he stated in public to Swedish media that he no longer was antisemitic, saying that there's good and bad people in all races and that he didn't support his former ideology.Aftonbladet, om Sven Olov Lindholm, 1971-06-06.Aftonbladet, om och med Sven Olov Lindholm, 1987-02-24.\\"Krigsv√•ren 1940: Medl√∂parna\\", SVT (Sveriges Television).

It opened in 1978http://www.library.miami.edu/archives/ohp/perrine/chronology.html as an extension of the Cutler Ridge Shopping Center, which itself was opened in 1960 (shortly after its \\"grand reopening\\", Cutler Ridge Mall moniker was subsequently applied to the entire shopping center complex). Subsequent additions extended the mall in the early to mid-1980s. History The original shopping center opened in 1960, anchored by Food Fair (Pantry Pride) and Richard's, which later became Burdines. In 1978, it was expanded into a full mall anchored by JCPenney, Jordan Marsh and Lord & Taylor, the last of which opened in 1982. Lord & Taylor closed in 1990 and became Mervyns in 1991. Pantry Pride became a Phar-Mor. The mall was nearly destroyed by Hurricane Andrew in 1992. When Cutler Ridge Mall reopened the following year, none of the original Cutler Ridge Shopping Center (except Sears) remained standing. The owner, Simon DeBartolo (now Simon Property Group) declared bankruptcy in the late 1990s and ownership was transferred to Lender Ocwen Federal Bank. Jordan Marsh became an auxiliary Burdines store for a short time, but after the mall was damaged by the hurricane, Burdines consolidated to the former Jordan Marsh. The former Richard's/Burdines building was torn down for J. Luria and Sons, a local catalog showroom chain, which opened at the mall in 1994. The Luria's building later became Garden Ridge Pottery, while Dillard's took the former Mervyns which closed in 1997. Garden Ridge later closed and became smaller stores. Phar-Mor was torn down for a Kmart. In 2002, management of the mall as assigned to T/S Development of Miami, Florida, which changed the name of the mall in November 2003 to Southland Mall. Also, the Dillard's store closed and was torn down in 2004 for Regal Cinemas in 2005, and this was also likewise done at Pompano Citi Centre where the Dillard's was also demolished. T/S Development then bought the property in November 2004, and sold their interests to Investcorp International Realty, a global investment group, in December 2006. Investcorp engaged Gumberg Asset Management Corp in Fort Lauderdale to handle the day-to-day management and leasing of Southland Mall. Southland Mall features JCPenney and Macy's as its anchor stores. The mall also features a movie theater, LA Fitness, DSW Shoe Warehouse, Victoria's Secret, Old Navy, TJ Maxx, Buffalo Wild Wings, Jump A Roos - Inflatable Play & Party Center and Ulta. Additional businesses on the mall property include Ross Dress for Less, SunTrust, Olive Garden, Applebee's, Regions Bank, Churromania, and Baby Elegant. In 2015, Sears Holdings spun off 235 of its properties, including the Sears at Southland Mall, into Seritage Growth Properties.http://www.seritage.com/retail/property/20701-sw-112th- ave/3312503/landing On July 7, 2017, it was announced that Kmart would be closing on October 1 as part of a plan to close 43 Kmart and Sears stores nationwide.

Prior to 1921, Northern Ireland was part of the same legal system as the rest of Ireland. For the purposes of private international law, the United Kingdom is divided into three distinct legal jurisdictions: *English law in England and Wales; *Northern Irish law in Northern Ireland; *Scots law in Scotland. Northern Ireland is a common law jurisdiction. Although its common law is similar to that in England and Wales, and partially derives from the same sources, there are some important differences in law and procedure between Northern Ireland and England and Wales. While influenced by English law, the Northern Irish legal system is distinctive for a number of reasons: it has roots in Irish common law prior to Irish independence in 1921 and the Acts of Union in 1801. Following the formation of the Irish Free State (which became the Republic of Ireland), Northern Ireland became a devolved legal jurisdiction within the United Kingdom as Ireland had been before 1801. Legislation The current statute law of Northern Ireland comprises those Acts of the Parliament of the United Kingdom that apply to Northern Ireland and Acts of the Northern Ireland Assembly, as well as statutory instruments made by departments of the Northern Ireland Executive and the UK Government. Also remaining on the statute books are many Acts of the Parliament of Northern Ireland passed between 1921 and 1972, certain Acts of the Parliament of Ireland made before the Act of Union 1800, and Acts of the Parliament of England, and of the Parliament of Great Britain, extended to Ireland under Poynings' Law between 1494 and 1782. The expression \\"Northern Ireland legislation\\" is defined by statute. The Northern Ireland Act 1998 establishes the legislative competence of the Northern Ireland Assembly. It creates a distinction between excepted matters, reserved matters and other matters (which are transferred i.e. they fall within the NI Assembly's competence). The Northern Ireland Act 1998 functions as a constitution for Northern Ireland as indicated in the Robinson case. The Northern Ireland Parliament was prorogued in 1972; from then until the establishment of the Northern Ireland Assembly following the Good Friday Agreement, the primary method of making legislation for Northern Ireland was by means of orders in council under the Northern Ireland (Temporary Provisions) Act 1972. A number of important legislative measures were adopted using the order in council procedure: this included the Criminal Evidence (Northern Ireland) Order 1988 restricting the right to silence, the Fair Employment and Treatment Order (Northern Ireland) 1998 on religious and political discrimination. Legal publications In 1979, there was a severe shortage of textbooks and of works of authority, such as annotated statutes, law reports and rules of court, because the potential readership of any legal work, no matter how general, was so small that publication was not commercially viable.The Report of the Royal Commission on Legal Services. Cmnd 7648. October 1979. Volume I. Paragraph 42.66 to at page 704. Google Books.

Criminal law=Criminal offencesOffences against the person= *Child destructionArchbold Criminal Pleading, Evidence and Practice lists child destruction as an offence against the person =Abortion= The 1967 Abortion Act does not apply in Northern Ireland. This situation led the Northern Ireland Human Rights Commission to take judicial proceedings which led to a decision in 2015 that Northern Ireland's abortion regime violated Article 8 of the European Convention on Human Rights as it failed to allow for termination in cases of fatal foetal abnormality or when pregnancy was due to a sexual offence. Fatal offences As to the mens rea for murder, see section 8 of the Criminal Justice Act (Northern Ireland) 1966. The following partial defences reduce murder to manslaughter: *loss of controlThe Coroners and Justice Act 2009, sections 54 and 55 *diminished responsibilityThe Criminal Justice Act (Northern Ireland) 1966, section 5 (as amended by section 53 of the Coroners and Justice Act 2009) *suicide pactThe Criminal Justice Act (Northern Ireland) 1966, section 14 See also section 6 of the Criminal Justice Act (Northern Ireland) 1966. The common law defence of provocation was abolished and section 7 of that Act repealed by section 56 of the Coroners and Justice Act 2009. The Infanticide Act (Northern Ireland) 1939 provides a partial defence which reduces murder to infanticide. The penalty for murder is provided by section 1(1) of the Northern Ireland (Emergency Provisions) Act 1973. Sexual OffencesNon-fatal non-sexual offencesOffences against property=Firearms and offensive weapons=Forgery, personation and cheating= See personation: See cheating: *Offences under Part I of the Forgery and Counterfeiting Act 1981 =Offences against the State or Crown or Government and political offences= *High treason *Misprision of treason *Compounding treason *Treason felony *Attempting to injure or alarm the Sovereign, contrary to section 2 of the Treason Act 1842 *Offences under the Official Secrets Acts 1911 to 1989 *Offences under the Incitement to Disaffection Act 1934 *Causing disaffection, contrary to section 68 of the Police (Northern Ireland) Act 1998 *Incitement to sedition or disaffection or promoting industrial unrest, contrary to section 3 of the Aliens Restriction (Amendment) Act 1919 *Offences relating to terrorism *Offences under section 1 of the Unlawful Drilling Act 1819 *Piracy iure gentium *Piracy with violence, contrary to the Piracy Act 1837 *Offences under the Slave Trade Act 1824 *Offences under the Foreign Enlistment Act 1870 *Offences under the Immigration Act 1971 *Coinage offences under Part II of the Forgery and Counterfeiting Act 1981 *Offences relating to public stores under the Public Stores Act 1875 *Offences against postal and electronic communication services *Misconduct in public office *Refusal to execute public office *Offences of selling public offices under the Sale of Offices Act 1551 and Sale of Offices Act 1809 (see section 1 thereof) *Cheating the public revenue *Offences under the Customs and Excise Management Act 1979 *Tax evasion and money laundering offences Abolished offences *Sedition *Seditious libel =Harmful or dangerous drugs=Offences against religion and public worship= *Blasphemy. *Blasphemous libel The Criminal Justice and Immigration Act 2008 abolished blasphemy in England and Wales; this measure did not extend to Northern Ireland. =Offences against the administration of public justice=Public order offences= *Prevention of Incitement to Hatred Act 1970 (Northern Ireland) *Riot *Affray *Offences under the Public Order (Northern Ireland) Order 1987. These include Northern Ireland's incitement to hatred laws. In 2013 the Northern Ireland Human Rights Commission reported, in 'Racist Hate Crime: Human Rights and the Criminal Justice System in Northern Ireland', that authorities were uncertain about the scope of this legislation. *Justice Act (NI) 2011 proscribes sectarian or indecent chanting at regulated matches Historically the Flags and Emblems (Display) Act Northern Ireland 1954 provided special legislative protection for the Union flag. ThThis 1954 Act was repealed by the Public Order (NI) Order 1987. =Offences against public morals and public policy= *BigamyAgain this is the label adopted by Archbold =Protection of children and vulnerable adults=Protection of animals and the environment=Road traffic and motor vehicle offences=Participatory offences= Participatory offences include aiding, abetting, counselling, or procuring the act of some crime or conspiracy. It also includes being an accomplice to criminal behaviour. Defences to crime *Marital coercion Criminal Justice Due to the history of political violence in Northern Ireland, there have been distinctive developments in Northern Irish criminal law and anti-terrorism procedures. These date to the Civil Authorities (Special Powers) Act (Northern Ireland) 1922, commonly called the Special Powers Act. Following the outbreak of violence in the 1960s and 1970s, the Northern Ireland (Emergency Provisions) Act 1973 introduced juryless Diplock courts to try terrorism related offences. The Terrorism Act 2000 retains special provisions for Northern Ireland in respect of anti-terrorism law, and retains the possibility to try certain offences without a jury. Civil law The Defamation Act 2013 does not apply in Northern Ireland. This protections which this Act provides for free expression (e.g. the public interest defence in section 4) do not therefore apply in Northern Ireland. Northern Irish courts have issued a small number of super-injunctions. Discrimination Law Discrimination law in Northern Ireland has evolved somewhat separately to discrimination law elsewhere in the United Kingdom. Most notably, Northern Irish history of legislation on religious and political discrimination. The Government of Ireland Act 1920 prohibited religious discrimination in legislation. In 1976 the UK Parliament passed the Fair Employment (Northern Ireland) Act which prohibited religious and political discrimination in employment. The Fair Employment (Northern Ireland) Act 1989 creates a system to monitor the religious composition of the workforce so as to promote fair participation. In 1998 the Northern Ireland Act 1998 introduced a statutory duty on designated public authorities to promote equality of opportunity on a number of grounds. While in some aspects Northern Ireland's equality law has been in advance of developments elsewhere, there are also examples where it is not as progressive. Racial discrimination in Northern Ireland was only prohibited in 1997. The Equality Act 2010 does not apply in Northern Ireland; this means that Northern Ireland's equality legislation is split across a large number of Acts and Orders.

Dewi Sri (Parvati) with her right hand in abhaya mudra, Bali Indonesia. The AbhayamudrƒÅ \\"gesture of fearlessness\\" is a mudrƒÅ (gesture) that is the gesture of reassurance and safety, which dispels fear and accords divine protection and bliss in many Indian religions. The right hand is held upright, and the palm is facing outwards. This is one of the earliest mudrƒÅs found depicted on a number of Hindu, Buddhist, Jain and Sikh images. The abhayamudrƒÅ represents protection, peace, benevolence and the dispelling of fear. The Hindu god Nataraja is depicted with the second right hand making the Abhaya Mudra, bestowing protection from both evil and ignorance to those who follow the righteousness of dharma. In Theravada Buddhism, it is usually made with the right hand raised to shoulder height, the arm bent and the palm facing outward with the fingers upright and joined and the left hand hanging down while standing. In Thailand and Laos, this mudra is associated with the Walking Buddha, often shown having both hands making a double abhayamudrƒÅ that is uniform. The abhayamudrƒÅ was probably used before the onset of Buddhism as a symbol of good intentions proposing friendship when approaching strangers. In the art of Gandhara, it is present when showing the action of preaching. It was also used in China during the Northern Wei and Sui eras of the 4th and 7th centuries.

It was designed by James F. Dunnigan and originally published by SPI in 1975 as an insert in Strategy & Tactics magazine, issue #50. Popular for its innovative design, the game was revamped and released by Decision Games, which acquired the rights to many SPI games after that company went bankrupt in 1982. Battle for Germany includes design features common in games of its era, such as a hex map and counters representing military units. However, unlike many two player simulations of World War II which simply pit Axis forces against the Allies, Battle for Germany simulates Allied rivalry between the United States and the Soviet Union. Each player commands his own forces as well as the German units which are faced by his opponent. The objective is to control as much German territory as possible by the time Berlin falls to the Allies. Battle for Germany is also unusual in that it is playable by two, three, or four players with no change in setup and little change in play dynamics. Additional players control the German forces.

His rabbinical court handled all kinds of matters, including financial disputes, marriage conflicts, and conversions. He was also a member of the Vaad Halacha (Jewish legal council) of the Maayanei Hayeshua Hospital of Bnei Brak and the av beis din of the Bnei Brak neighborhood of Ramat Aharon.  Biography  Rabbi Karelitz (left) learning after praying in the morning Karelitz was born in 1926 in Kosava (Kossov), Vilnius province, Poland, presently in Belarus. He came to Israel in 1935 with his parents. Karelitz was a nephew of Rabbi Avrohom Yeshaya Karelitz, known as the Chazon Ish. (The latter's sister was Karelitz's mother). The Chazon Ish was a previous rabbinical spiritual leader of Bnei Brak. From the time of the Chazon Ish until Karelitz it was Rav Elazar Shach who was regarded as the pre-eminent leader. In his youth, he studied in the Ponevezh Yeshiva. He also studied with his uncles, the Chazon Ish and the Steipler. His wife Leah (d. 2015) was the daughter of Rabbi Tzvi Hirsch Kopshitz of Jerusalem and the great-granddaughter of Rabbi Yosef Chaim Sonnenfeld. Rav Karelitz died in Bnei Brak on October 21, 2019.

Controversy Karelitz's beit din in Israel performs conversions on people who are residing illegally in the state of Israel. This means several things: (1) The conversion process goes against Israeli law which gives the state more reason to reject such conversions. (2) The converts, who often live many years illegally in Israel, are eventually forced to leave (deportation, or due to lack of financial means to support oneself).

George Moscone, an early proponent of gay rights, in conjunction with his friend and ally in the Assembly, Willie Brown, managed to get the bill passed, 21-20, repealing the existing Californian laws against sodomy. The amendment was signed into law by California Governor Jerry Brown. The Assembly had a much easier time passing the bill, with final vote on AB 489 being 45-26. Gov. Brown signed the bill on May 12, 1975. Assemblyman Brown introduced the bill in 1970, resulting in a five-year fight in the legislature.  History  During the late 19th and early 20th centuries, sodomy was often considered a ‚Äúcrime against nature‚Äù due to the fact that engaging in this form of intercourse disallows any possibility for procreation. Sodomy is defined as being \\"sexual contact that takes place between the penis of one person and the anus of another person.\\" These laws were extended by state legislation to include oral sex performed on a man or a woman. Observations were then made on the people who committed the crime and the majority of offenders did such acts with minors. Despite improvements on laws protecting minors in cases of molestation, sodomy was still the primary charge.  Assembly Bill 489  The bill decriminalized sex that is non-procreational and protected minors who could not legally consent. The 1975 California bill states, \\"This bill removes criminal sanctions from adulterous cohabitation; and it removes specific criminal sanctions from sodomy and oral copulation except: (1) when the sodomy or oral copulation is committed with a minor or by force, violence, duress, menace or threat of great bodily harm.\\" The focus was then set by Brown and Moscone to be on the consent of the adult for the sexual act and not the act itself.  Legal precedents = Bowers v. Hardwick  In Georgia in 1986, two men were walked in on while engaging in consensual sodomy in the privacy of a home. Hardwick, the respondent, took the case to the Court of Appeals after the Federal District Court denied his challenging of the constitutionality of the sodomy laws. After judgment, it was decided that since not all Court of Appeals had the same ruling over Hardwick‚Äôs claim, the matter at hand is whether or not Federal Constitution holds a fundamental right for homosexuals to engage in sodomy (source). Hardwick felt like he was set up for failure as a ‚Äúpracticing homosexual.‚Äù From precedent, the Due Process Law of the Fourteenth Amendment did not extend to private acts in the home for his case. In the end, the rulings of the Appeals Court were reversed.  Lawrence v. Texas  In Texas, 2003, two men were (again) caught engaging in sodomy under the reporting of a gun shooting disturbance. The Bowers v. Hardwick case was re-examined because there were more liberties uncounted for. The US Supreme Court documents the claim: \\"To say that the issue in Bowers was simply the right to engage in certain sexual conduct demeans the claim the individual put forward, just as it would demean a married couple were it said that marriage is just about the right to have sexual intercourse.\\" This case brought to light the right to choose what relationships to engage in as a free adult in the sanctity of their own homes. Following the Hardwick case, the states that had laws prohibiting sodomy had dropped from 25 to 13 while 4 of those states only enforce these laws against homosexuals. This fact was used in order to prove that the Bowers‚Äô ruling was constructed on the largely accepted values of the nation at the time. Finally, The Due Process Law of the Fourteenth Amendment was effective in preventing the government from intruding in the personal lives of citizens.  Modern-Day California: Penal Code 286  The California Penal Code 286 still punishes for sodomy under the following circumstances: # Act is done with someone under the age of 18 (a minor) # Done through violent force, fear tactics, or manipulation # Done on someone who is: :* Intoxicated / under the influence of drugs and therefore unable to consent for a sexual act :* Diagnosed with a physical or mental disability, in which the perpetrator is aware of, that would cause him or her to be unable to consent :*Uninformed of the type of sexual act that was to be engaged in or was asleep These guidelines are in place in order for anyone to be justifiably accused of unlawful sodomy and/or rape. They do not discriminate against people according to their sexual preferences or sexual orientation. The consequences for in illegal act of sodomy are defined in Assembly Bill 489: \\"This bill increases the punishment to not less than three years state imprisonment in cases of sodomy by force, violence, duress, menace or threat of great bodily harm, and in cases where the other person is 14 years of age and 10 years younger than the defendant. If the sodomy is with a person under 18, sodomy is punishable under the bill as a felony-misdemeanor by imprisonment in state prison for not more than 15 years or in the county jail for not more than one year.\\" See also *1975 in LGBT rights *1976 in LGBT rights ReferencesBibliography * *(May 14, 1975). \\"Gov.

Hotel Lafayette Buffalo Meter Company Building, renamed Bethune Hall to honor Bethune, although she was not the building's architect Her work includes the Hotel Lafayette. The Buffalo Meter Company Building was renamed Bethune Hall in her honor by the University at Buffalo. Personal life Bethune was born Jennie Louise Blanchard in Waterloo, New York in 1856. The Blanchard family moved to Buffalo, New York when she was a child. She graduated from the Buffalo Central High School in 1874. In 1881, she wed Canadian Robert A. Bethune (1855-1915), also an architect. Together they had one son, Charles William Bethune in 1883. Bethune reportedly purchased the first woman's bicycle to go on sale in Buffalo. She was an active member of the Women's Wheel and Athletic Club.Ladies of the Wheel, Buffalo Morning Express, August 14, 1892. Reproduced online by fultonhistory.com. Retrieved 2012-03-10. According to the Buffalo Spree, Bethune had feminist leanings. Career Bethune planned on going to architecture school at Cornell. Instead, in 1876, she took a job working as a draftsman in the office of Richard A. Waite and F.W. Caulkins, well known architects in Buffalo, New York. At the time, it was more common to learn architecture while working for a firm rather than in a classroom. In 1881, after five years in Waite's office, she opened an independent office partnering with Robert Bethune in Buffalo, earning herself the title of the nation's first professional woman architect. Bethune was elected a member of the Western Association of Architects (WAA) in 1885. She later served a term as a vice president of the W.A.A. She was named the first female associate of the American Institute of Architects (A.I.A.) in 1888 and in 1889, she became its first female fellow. In 1891, she refused to compete in a design competition for the Women's Building at the World‚Äôs Columbian Exposition in Chicago because men were paid $10,000 to design buildings for the fair while the women got only $1,000. Bethune designed mostly industrial and public buildings. She disliked working on residential projects because they paid poorly. She is especially known for designing public schools. Sadly, much of her work has since been demolished. Her best-known design and masterpiece is the neoclassical Hotel Lafayette, which was commissioned for $1 million and completed in 1904. It has since undergone a $35 million restoration, completed in 2012 by developer Rocco Termini. The Bethune firm also designed the Denton, Cottier & Daniels music store, one of the first buildings in the United States to utilize a steel frame and poured concrete slabs. Three other Bethune buildings are still standing today: the Iroquois Door Plant Company warehouse; the large Chandler Street Complex for the Buffalo Weaving Company; and the Witkop and Holmes Headquarters (1901), which was listed on the National Register of Historic Places in 2014. Bethune retired in 1908 and died in 1915 at the age of 59. In 1910, between the time she retired and the time she died, there were 50 women working professionally as architects.

He is also currently a General Secretary of the Indian National Congress party's All India Congress Committee. Previously, he had served as the 14th Chief Minister of Madhya Pradesh, a central Indian state, for two terms from 1993 to 2003. Prior to that he was a minister in Chief Minister Arjun Singh's cabinet between 1980‚Äì84. In 2019 Lok Sabha elections he was defeated by Pragya Singh Thakur for Bhopal Lok Sabha seat. Personal life Singh was born in Indore in the erstwhile princely state of Holkar (now a part of Madhya Pradesh) of British India, on 28 February 1947. His father, Balbhadra Singh, was the Raja of Raghogarh (under Gwalior State), presently known as Guna district of Madhya Pradesh, and a member of the Legislative Assembly (MLA) as independent candidate for the Raghogarh Vidhan Sabha constituency following the 1951 elections. He was educated at The Daly College, Indore and the Shri Govindram Seksaria Institute of Technology and Science (SGSITS) Indore, where he completed his B.E. in Mechanical Engineering. Since 1969, he was married to Asha Singh, who died in 2013, and with whom he has four daughters and a son Jaivardhan Singh, who is member of Madhya Pradesh's 14th Vidhan Sabha serving as the Cabinet Minister of Urban Development and Housing. In April 2014, he confirmed that he was in a relationship with a Rajya Sabha TV anchor Amrita Rai; they married in late August 2015. Narmada Yatra The sacred Narmada River, the lifeline of Central India, is worshipped as Narmada maiyya (mother) or Ma Rewa (derived from ‚Äúrev‚Äù meaning leaping one). One of the five holy rivers of India, it is the only one which has the tradition of being circumambulated from source to sea and back, on a pilgrimage or yatra. Being the longest west-flowing river, the Narmada parikrama is a formidable spiritual exercise and challenge‚Äîan incredible journey of about 3,300 km. Digvijaya Singh along with his wife started the Narmada Parikrama on 30 September 2017, from Barman Ghat, on banks of river Narmada after taking the blessing of his spiritual guru Shankaracharya Swami Swaroopanand Saraswati ji. The journey took them from Barman Ghat, on River Narmada southern banks, all the way to its mouth at Bharuch in Gujarat. At Bharuch, Mithi Talai is the point where the Narmada joins the Arabian Sea. Here they took a motorboat from the southern to the northern end and begin the return journey along its northern bank. On 9 April 2018 they completed the narmada parikrama at Barman Ghat having covered by foot in 192 days. Political career=MLA and MP, 1977‚Äì1993 Singh was president of the Raghogarh Nagar palika (a municipal committee) between 1969 and 1971. An offer in 1970 from Vijayaraje Scindia for him to join the Jana Sangh was not taken up and he subsequently joined the Congress party. He became a Member of the Legislative Assembly (MLA) as the party's representative for the Raghogarh Vidhan Sabha constituency of the Madhya Pradesh Legislative Assembly in the 1977 elections. This was the same constituency that his father had won in 1951 as member of the Legislative Assembly (MLA) as independent candidate for the Raghogarh Vidhan Sabha constituency following the 1951 elections. Digvijaya was later re-elected from the Raghogarh constituency and became a Minister of State and later a Cabinet Minister in the Madhya Pradesh state government led by Arjun Singh, whom he has called his mentor, between 1980‚Äì84. He was president of the Madhya Pradesh Congress Committee between 1985 and 1988, having been nominated by Rajiv Gandhi, and was re-elected in 1992. He had been elected as a member of the 8th Lok Sabha, the lower house of the Parliament of India, in the Indian general election of 1984, representing the Rajgarh Lok Sabha constituency. He was the first Congress politician to win the constituency, which had been created in 1977. Having won that contest by 150,000 votes, he lost the seat to Pyarelal Khandelwal of the Bharatiya Janata Party (BJP) by 57,000 votes in the 1989 general election. He regained it in 1991, becoming a member of the 10th Lok Sabha. Chief Minister, 1993‚Äì2003 In 1993, he resigned from the Lok Sabha because he had been appointed Chief Minister of Madhya Pradesh. His brother, Lakshman Singh, had been elected in 1993 as a Congress MLA in Madhya Pradesh from the same Raghogarh assembly constituency that Digivijaya had previously held. Lakshman resigned from the seat in favour of Digvijaya, who needed to be elected to the Madhya Pradesh Legislative Assembly in order to fulfill his role as Chief Minister. However, the scheme failed when a petition was filed that challenged the validity of Lakshman's 1993 election. Digvijaya instead won the by-election from Chachoura constituency, which was vacated by the Former MLA Shivnarayan Meena that time for the purpose.

These efforts attempted to arrest the declining support for the INC by those communities, who since the 1960s had increasingly been favouring the Bahujan Samaj Party (BSP), the Jana Sangh and its political successor, the BJP. He followed the example set by Arjun Singh in taking this approach, which was not adopted in other areas of the Belt such as Bihar and Uttar Pradesh. Sudha Pai says, \\"He was driven by both the political imperative to sustain the base of the party among these social groups and ... a commitment to improving their socio-economic position.\\" The \\"Dalit Agenda\\" that resulted from the Bhopal Conference in 2002 epitomised the strategy, which by Digvijaya Singh's time was more necessary than during Arjun Singh's period in power because one outcome of the Mandal Commission had been increased Dalit desires for self- assertion. His approach to reform in what was still largely a feudal society was driven by a top-down strategy to achieve Dalit and Tribal support, as opposed to the bottom-up strategy of other belt leaders such as Mayawati and Lalu Prasad Yadav, who lacked Singh's upper caste/class status and harnessed the desire for empowerment in the depressed communities through identity politics. Among the measures introduced to achieve his aim were the Education Guarantee Scheme (EGS), redistribution of common grazing land (charnoi) to landless dalits and tribals, free electricity for farmers, the promotion of Panchayati Raj as a means of delegating power to villagers and a supplier diversity scheme which guaranteed that thirty percent of government supplies would be purchased from the disadvantaged groups. There was less emphasis than previously on methods of assistance that were focused on reservation of jobs. Returning to the Raghogarh constituency for the 1998 elections, Singh was re- elected and appointed by Sonia Gandhi to serve a second term as chief minister. Census data suggests that Singh's education reforms had become a particularly successful aspect of his government. Those reforms included the construction of thousands of new village schools under the EGS, and may have been significant in increasing the literacy rate in Madhya Pradesh from 45 per cent in 1991 to 64 per cent in 2001. The improvement among girls was particularly high, growing from 29 per cent to 50 per cent. In his second term as Chief Minister, Singh sought to extend his decentralising, socially beneficial ideas by instituting reforms in healthcare that would guarantee a minimum level of care at panchayat level by financing the training of locally nominated healthcare professionals. This mirrored his earlier efforts in education and was known as the Healthcare Guarantee Scheme. Chhattisgarh gained administrative independence from Madhya Pradesh in 2001 under the terms of the Madhya Pradesh Reorganisation Act. Singh was directed by Sonia Gandhi to ensure the selection of Ajit Jogi as the Chief Minister for the new state and this Singh did, although Jogi had been critical of his style of politics and Singh had personally preferred not to see him installed to that office. While Singh managed to convince the majority of Congress Legislator Party members to back Ajit Jogi, the absence of Vidya Charan Shukla and his supporters at the meeting raised questions about the exercise of seeking consensus because Shukla was the other main contender for the post. Subsequently, Singh met with Shukla in order to allay concerns.Jogi govt faces instability . The Tribune, 3 November 2001 Singh won the Raghogarh constituency again in 2003 but his party overall was heavily defeated by the BJP, as it also was in Rajasthan and Chhattisgarh. The defeat in Madhya Pradesh has been attributed in large part to deadlocks in the pursuit of development that had arisen as the Panchayati Raj and central government squabbled about the extent of their respective powers, and to frequent electrical power cuts. The latter resulted from thirty-two percent of what had been the generation capacity of Madhya Pradesh now being in the new state of Chhattisgarh: while Chhattisgarh did not need all of that capacity, much of it had historically been used in the remainder of Madhya Pradesh, which now found itself having only around 50 percent of the power that it required. Aditi Phadnis, a political journalist and author, also notes that in 1985, the state had been producing a surplus of electricity through a process of technical and administrative efficiency that was the envy of other areas and that then \\"The State Electricity Board began to be looked upon as a milch cow by successive politicians, Digvijay Singh included.\\" Power was given away and no money was set aside for repairs and maintenance. One of Singh's last proposals while in office was to write-off the electricity bills of 1.2 million people over the preceding three years. In this, he was thwarted by the Election Commission of India, which ruled the proposal to be a breach of election rules. Singh had claimed that it was desirable because the farmers of the state ‚Äî who needed electricity to power water pumps ‚Äî had suffered three years of drought conditions. Work at national level Following his party's defeat, Singh determined that he would not contest any polls for the next decade and the Raghogarh constituency was won by his cousin, Mool Singh, at the next elections in 2008. Singh shifted his attention to working for Congress from the centre, becoming a general secretary of the AICC and being involved in the party's organisation across several states, including Andhra Pradesh, Assam, Bihar and Uttar Pradesh. In 2012, Singh said that there was a need for younger people to be involved in state assemblies and that he had no further interest in contesting state elections. He expressed a willingness to contest the 2014 Lok Sabha elections if Congress wanted him to do so; he also said that he would like to see his son as the incumbent of the Raghogarh constituency. His son, Jaivardhan, was accompanied by his father when he joined the INC in June 2013 after previous involvement in its youth section. Mool Singh, the incumbent MLA, announced then that he would not be contesting his Raghogarh Assembly seat in the forthcoming elections, paving the way for Jaivardhan to be elected in a form of dynastic succession that is a feature of politics in India. In January 2014, he was elected as a member of parliament to the Rajya Sabha from Madhya Pradesh. Singh has been criticised by his opposition for corruption, which he denied. In 2011, a charge sheet was submitted in court against him but the Central Bureau of Investigation (CBI) determined in March 2014 that there was no case to answer. In June 2015, Singh petitioned the Supreme Court, pleading for a CBI probe into the Vyapam scam. He claimed to have interacted with a whistleblower who had revealed sensitive information to him. The CBI dismissed the claim in November 2017, raising the possibility that Singh could be prosecuted for fabricating evidence. In the 2019 Indian general election, he ran for Lok Sabha in the constituency of Bhopal, but lost to Pragya Singh Thakur. Controversies=1998 Multai farmer massacre In 1998, 19 to 24 farmers were shot dead by Madhya Pradesh police. Singh was Chief Minister of the state at the time and the People's Union for Civil Liberties (PUCL) blamed him for arresting farmers' leaders. Batla House controversy A comment by Singh in 2011 led to disagreements within his party. He suggested that the Batla House encounter case, which led to the death of two terrorists and one police officer, was fake. The Union Home Minister, P. Chidambaram, dismissed Singh's claim and his demand for a further judicial investigation into it. Congress distanced itself and rejected his views that the encounter was stage-managed, stating that the encounter should not be politicised or raked up for political gains. Singh's stand on the Batla House encounter led to criticism from the opposition BJP. Remarks about female MP In 2013, Singh described Meenakshi Natarajan, a female Congress MP from Mandsaur, as \\"sau tunch maal\\" (\\"totally unblemished\\")‚Äîa colloquialism The Times of India described as \\"frequently used loosely to describe a woman as 'sexy'\\". Advocates for women's rights were upset by Singh's comment and called for Congress to act against him. However, the MP backed Singh and said he meant that she was like \\"pure gold\\"; The Times of India commented that \\"tunch maal\\" is \\"also a trade jargon among jewelers to describe the level of purity of the yellow metal\\" and added that Singh prefaced his comment about Natarajan by describing himself as a \\"political goldsmith\\". Criticism of burial of bin Laden's body Singh criticised the United States in 2011 for not respecting Osama bin Laden's religion when it buried him at sea, saying \\"however big a criminal one might be, his religious traditions should be respected while burying him.\\" Congress's leadership distanced itself from his views. Singh later said that his statement should not be interpreted as support for or opposition to bin Laden, adding \\"I had merely said that the worst of criminals should be cremated according to their faith. He is a terrorist and he deserved the treatment that he got.\\" Views on Hindu nationalist groups Singh has said that the right-wing extremism of the kind he said is perpetrated by the Rashtriya Swayamsevak Sangh (RSS) and Students Islamic Movement of India (SIMI) represented a grave threat to national unity. He equated RSS to the Nazis stating that \\"The RSS, in the garb of its nationalist ideology, is targeting Muslims the same way Nazis targeted Jews in the 1930s\\". Israel had taken grave exception to this comment. He accused the RSS of being involved in a number of terrorist strikes across the country. He demanded a CBI enquiry into the murder of Sunil Joshi, an RSS activist accused of being involved in the Ajmer Dargah attack, alleging that Joshi was murdered because \\"he knew too much\\".

For the first 16 years, Gwinnett Place was the leading mall in the region, drawing shoppers from as far away as South Carolina and centering what was then one of the fastest-growing counties in the nation until the openings of Mall of Georgia in Buford and Sugarloaf Mills in Lawrenceville. It was also used as the StarCourt Mall filming location in the third season of Netflix's Stranger Things. History When it first opened in early 1984, its original anchors were Rich's, Davison's and Sears. In 1986, Mervyn's joined the mall and Davison's was changed over to Macy's. Further anchor shuffling occurred in 1995 when Parisian joined the mall and Mervyn's left the mall in 1997, respectively. J. C. Penney took over the Mervyn's spot the following year and closed in 2015, with Beauty Master taking over in 2016. Macy's and Rich's merged in 2003 to form Rich's-Macy's until 2005 when the name was changed to just Macy's. With two Macy's in the mall, the former Davison's closed and in 2010 reopened as the first MegaMart in the U.S. In 2007, Parisian was renamed Belk, which closed in 2013 and remains vacant to this day. In these aspects, the mall developed on a very similar fashion as Town Center at Cobb on the northwest side of Atlanta, and were in many ways sister malls. However, one of the distinct features about Gwinnett Place Mall is the Macy's (former Rich's), which features an exterior almost entirely covered in mirrored glass. Today The mall was seriously challenged and hurt by the openings of Sugarloaf Mills in 2001 (also owned by Simon). Not only did the mall take a large part of its customer base and all of its out-of-state shoppers to these new malls, but the mall was also unable to attract any new anchors for several years although the Macy's moved its location to the defunct Rich's on the west side of the mall and Parisian became Belk. In 2008, Gwinnett Technical College opened an International Education Center there, where students enrolled at Gwinnett Technical College go to take foreign language classes such as Korean. Mega Mart opened a location in the former Macy's. Currently, a number of the mall's store fronts and spots in the food court are empty and for lease. The recent downturn of the mall in 2013 has led to the closure of Belk as well as owner and manager Simon Property Group to lose the mall to foreclosure where it was acquired by retail rehab specialist, Moonbeam Capital Investments LLC. JCPenney closed April 4, 2015 and Beauty Master, the regional beauty department store purchased the former JCPenney building in March 2016. The former Belk is expected to have some redevelopment but may close by 2020. In December 2017 the body of a 19-year-old woman was found in the back room of the food court, where it had gone unnoticed for weeks. The mall has also had ongoing issues with homelessness, gangs, and prostitution in and around the mall and surrounding areas. In January 2018, two mall employees were robbed and assaulted in the Macy's parking lot; in March 2018, a 32-year-old female was arrested for indecent exposure, solicitation of prostitution, and possession of heroin and cocaine in the Sears parking lot. On May 31, 2018, Sears announced that their location there would be closing in September 2018 as part of a plan to close 63 stores across the United States. In late February 2019, The Atlanta Journal-Constitution and Gwinnett Daily Post reported that sports developer CricRealty intends to redevelop the Gwinnett Place Mall site to build a mixed-use development anchored by a 20,000-seat cricket stadium.  In popular culture  On July 16, 2018, streaming service Netflix released a teaser for the third season of its hit series Stranger Things. The ad was made in the style of a 1985 mall advertisement for the fictional \\"Starcourt Mall\\". In reality, the crew of Stranger Things did a cosmetic restoration of a portion of the Gwinnett Place Mall, returning authentic signage and storefronts to the mall to represent many businesses that have since ceased to exist. The transformation took place during May 2018, with production of the series taking place in the mall during the subsequent summer months.Coming Soon: The Starcourt Mall!

It is a type of long stick with a pointed end, also known as the cattle prod. The word is from Middle English gode, from Old English gƒÅd. The crook and flail depicted in Egyptian iconography. In Oedipus the King, the play by Sophocles, Laius, the biological father of Oedipus, tried to kill his son with a goad when they accidentally met at a juncture of three roads. They did not know at the time that they were father and son. Oedipus explains to Jocasta, his mother and wife, what took place: \\"When in my journey I was near those three roads, there met me a herald, and a man seated in a carriage drawn by colts, as thou hast described; and he who was in front, and the old man himself, were for thrusting me rudely from the path. Then, in anger, I struck him who pushed me aside. -- the driver; and the old man, seeing it, watched the moment when I was passing, and, from the carriage, brought his goad with two teeth down full upon my head. Yet was he paid with interest; by one swift blow from the staff in his hand he was rolled right out of the carriage, on his back; and I slew every man of them.\\"  Religious significance  Goads in various guises are used as iconographic devices and may be seen in the 'elephant goad' or 'ankusha' (Sanskrit) in the hand of Ganesha, for example. According to the biblical passage Judges 3:31, Shamgar son of Anath killed six hundred Philistines with an ox goad. Tischler and McHenry (2006: p. 251) in discussing the biblical account of 'goad' hold: > In the early days, before Israel had its own metal industries, farmers had > to rely on the Philistines to sharpen their goads, as well as other metal > tools, the plowshares and mattocks, forks, and axes (1 Sam. 13:20). > The image of prodding the reluctant or lazy creature made this a useful > metaphor for sharp urging, such as the prick of conscience, the nagging of a > mate, or the \\"words of the wise,\\" which are \\"firmly embedded nails\\" in human > minds (Ecclesiastes 12:11-12). Ploughing with oxen: a miniature from an early-16th-century manuscript held at the British Museum. The ploughman on the right appears to carry a goad. The ox on the left appears to react to it. Note the spike or prod at the end of this goad. Saint Paul, recounting the story of his conversion before King Agrippa, told of a voice he heard saying ‚ÄòSaul, Saul, why are you persecuting Me? It is hard for you to kick against the goads.‚ÄôActs 26:14 NKJV Some versions of the actual account of his conversion earlier in the Acts of the Apostles also use the same phrase.Acts 9:5 in some manuscripts In the Latin alphabet, the letter L is derived from the Semitic crook or goad which stood for . This may originally have been based on an Egyptian hieroglyph that was adapted by Semites for alphabetic purposes. Pollack (2004: p. 146), in discussing 'Lamed, Path 22' the path from Gevurah to Tiferet, Justice, in the pathworking of the esoteric Kabbalah, states: > We switch sides now and bring the power of Gevurah to the center. Lamed > means 'goad' and in particular an ox-goad, as if we use the power of Gevurah > to goad that Aleph ox, the silent letter, into a more tangible physical > existence in the heart of the tree [of life]. Lamed begins the Hebrew words > for both \\"learn\\" and \\"teach,\\" and so encompasses the most Kabbalist of > activities, study. Kabbalah has never been a path of pure sensation, but > always has used study to goad us into higher consciousness. Lamed, alone of > the Hebrew alphabet, reaches above the height of all the other letters. > Through learning we extend ourselves above ordinary awareness.

He served under the warlord Yuan Shao from 191 to 200 and then under the warlord and Grand chancellor of the Han Cao Cao from 200 until he was executed by the later in 204 during the End of the Han dynasty. Life Little is recorded about Xu You in history. The first mention of him was in 184, when he plotted with Wang Fen (ÁéãËä¨), the Inspector of Ji Province, and other officials to overthrow Emperor Ling ( 168‚Äì189) and replace him with the Marquis of Hefei (ÂêàËÇ•‰æØ). Xu You tried to persuade Cao Cao, a friend of his, to participate in the plot but Cao Cao refused. Eventually, the plot failed and Wang Fen committed suicide while Xu You fled. Around 191, after the warlord Yuan Shao seized control of Ji Province from its governor Han Fu, he recruited Xu You to serve as an adviser under him. During this time, Xu You advised Yuan Shao to maintain an alliance with Cao Cao, who had also become a warlord based in the Henan region south of Yuan Shao's territories in Hebei. In 195 or 196, Xu You advised Yuan Shao to welcome the figurehead Emperor Xian to Ji Province so that he can control the emperor and use him as a \\"trump card\\" against rival warlords. However, Yuan Shao heeded the advice of his other advisers instead and let the opportunity slip by. Eventually, Cao Cao received Emperor Xian and brought him to his base in Xu (Ë®±; present-day Xuchang, Henan), which became the new imperial capital. Xu You felt disgruntled with Yuan Shao for not heeding his advice. In 200, when the Battle of Guandu broke out between Yuan Shao and Cao Cao, Xu You advised Yuan Shao to adopt a slow, steady and step-by-step approach towards attacking Cao Cao, but Yuan Shao again refused to listen as he preferred an all-out approach. Xu You, who was notorious for being greedy and corrupt, had allowed his family members to solicit bribes and commit crimes. Shen Pei, another of Yuan Shao's subordinates who was in charge of coordinating the mobilisation of troops for the Guandu campaign, had Xu You's family members arrested. Shen Pei then reported it to Yuan Shao, who scolded Xu You. Xu You, fearing that he had fallen out of Yuan Shao's favour, escaped from Yuan Shao's camp and defected to Cao Cao's side. Cao Cao was so overjoyed when he heard of his old friend's arrival that he even forgot to wear his shoes when he came out to welcome Xu You. Xu You pointed out the location of Yuan Shao's supply depot at Wuchao (ÁÉèÂ∑¢) and urged Cao Cao to attack Wuchao and destroy Yuan Shao's supplies to force the enemy to retreat. During the battle Xu You advocated the execution of Yuan Shao's soldiers. Cao Cao led a successful raid on Wuchao and destroyed all of Yuan Shao's supplies, leading to his eventual victory over Yuan Shao at the Battle of Guandu. During the Battle of Ye in 204, Xu You advised Cao Cao to direct the waters of the Zhang River (Êº≥Ê≤≥) to flood Ye city, the capital of Ji Province. Cao Cao was thus able to conquer Ji Province. Xu You became increasingly arrogant as he believed that he had made great contributions in helping Cao Cao defeat Yuan Shao. He often behaved rudely and disrespectfully in front of Cao Cao, including calling Cao Cao by his childhood name. Although Cao Cao appeared to laugh off Xu You's behaviour, he secretly bore a grudge against Xu You. One day, when Xu You passed through the gates of Ye city, he told everyone that Cao Cao would not have been able to enter Ye city without his help. Cao Cao could no longer tolerate Xu You's behaviour so he ordered Xu You's arrest and eventual execution. Romance of the Three Kingdoms In Romance of the Three Kingdoms, Xu You is portrayed as a childhood friend of Cao Cao's. His defection and the events leading up to his death are similar. After the Cao occupation of Jizhou, Xu Chu overhears Xu's boasting. He is killed and his head brought to Cao Cao, who scolds Xu Chu, and orders a lavish burial for his friend. It is not made clear whether Cao's gesture is genuine. In popular culture Xu You was played by Xu Maomao in the 2010 television series Three Kingdoms. He also makes an appearance in the Dynasty Warriors series of video games. See also * Lists of people of the Three Kingdoms References * Chen, Shou (3rd century).

In the fall of 1951 he travelled to Berlin for the World Federation of Trade Unions General Council Meeting and later to Moscow. On returning to Guatemala, Guti√©rrez dissolved PROG on February 2, 1952 and rejoined PCG.

He continued serving in the state of Cao Wei, founded by Cao Cao's successor Cao Pi, during the Three Kingdoms period of China. Life Niu Jin participated in the Battle of Jiangling of 208, during which he volunteered to lead 300 horsemen to attack the enemy, but was only saved by Cao Ren when he got surrounded. Years later, he participated in the counter-attack against the invading Shu forces in 231 and scored a victory over Zhuge Liang's unit, and pursued him to Mount Qi. In 234, he soundly defeated the Shu general Ma Dai on the battlefield and killed thousands of enemies. In 238, he followed Sima Yi on his campaign against Gongsun Yuan and was promoted to General of the Rear (ÂæåÂ∞áËªç). However, Niu Jin's accomplishments in his later years had only earned him the apprehension from the Simas, thus he was ordered to commit suicide by drinking poison. The exact reasons for his death as well as the year he died remain disputed. The Yuan Shi Juan states that the incident happened \\"after the Year of the Horse\\" and that Niu Jin was poisoned by drinking toxic wine. Other records state that it was because Niu Jin committed adultery with one of the Sima relatives and was assassinated with poison arrows \\"during the Year of the Cow\\". This account is somewhat supported by Wei's records as they state that an illegitimate child was born in the Sima family. A story from unknown origin also states that Niu Jin was killed since he was actually a distant relative of the former emperor; his death date and the accuracy of this statement are difficult to verify. In Romance of the Three Kingdoms In the 14th-century historical novel Romance of the Three Kingdoms, Niu Jin was one of Cao Ren's subordinates. He chased Gan Ning back to Yiling during the battle of Jiangling, but was surrounded by reinforcements led by Zhou Yu, and was ultimately defeated. Niu Jin then regrouped and planned a night attack on Zhou Yu's camp, but in the end he was once again beaten, suffering another great loss.

He studied in Geneva in the 1950s and lived there later between his travels. Historisches Lexikon der Schweiz, No 6 Bouvier, Nicolas retrieved 27 December 2018 Life Bouvier was born at Grand-Lancy near Geneva, the youngest of three children. He grew up in \\"a Huguenot milieu, rigorous and enlightened at the same time, intellectually very open, but where the entire emotional aspect of existence was strictly monitored.\\" He passed his childhood in a house where, in his words, \\"the paper-cutter counted for more than the bread-knife\\", a double reference to his librarian father (\\"one of the most amiable beings I should ever have met\\") and his mother, \\"the most mediocre cook west of Suez\\". He grew up indifferent to gastronomy and a hardy traveller as well as an avid reader. Between the ages of six and seven, he devoured Jules Verne, Curwood, Stevenson, Jack London and Fenimore Cooper. \\"At eight years, I traced with my thumbnail the course of the Yukon in the butter of my toast. Already waiting for the world: to grow up and clear off.\\" From 1946, various escapades (Bourgogne, Tuscany, Provence, Flanders, the Sahara, Lapland, Anatolia) got him started on the path of the voyager. Nevertheless, he enrolled at the University of Geneva in the faculty of Letters and Law, indulged an interest in Sanskrit and medieval history, and thought about pursuing a doctorate (which he did not in the end take up) doing a comparative study of Manon Lescaut and Moll Flanders. His travels all over the world incited him to recount his experiences and adventures, the most famous works being L'Usage du monde and Le Poisson-scorpion. His work is marked by a commitment to report what he sees and feels, shorn of any pretence of omniscience, leading often to an intimacy bordering on the mystical. His journey from Geneva to Japan was in many ways prescient of the great eastward wave of hippies that occurred in the sixties and seventies - slow, meandering progress in a small, iconic car, carefully guarded idiosyncrasy, a rite of passage. Yet, it differs in that the travelogues this journey inspired contain deep reflections on man's intimate nature, written in a style very much aware and appreciative of the traditions and possibilities of the language he uses. (He wrote mainly in French, though he does mention writing a series of travel articles in English for a local journal during his stay in Ceylon.) \\"To reach the heart of this man, one must return to the slim volume that contains all his poems,\\" wrote Bertial Galand, Bouvier's editor. The work in question is Le dehors et le dedans, a collection of texts written for the most part on the road and published for the first time in 1982. This is the only book of poetry by Bouvier, who nevertheless said in an interview, \\"Poetry is more necessary to me than prose because it is extremely direct, brutal - full-contact!\\" At the end of the 1950s, the World Health Organisation asked him to find images on the eye and its diseases. Thus Bouvier discovered, \\"through the chances of life\\", his profession of \\"image searcher,\\" which perhaps appealed to him because \\"images, like music, speak a universal language,\\" as suggested by Pierre Starobinski in his preface to Le Corps, miroir du Monde - voyage dans le mus√©e imaginaire de Nicolas Bouvier. Another posthumous work, Entre errance et √©ternit√©, offers a poetic look at the mountains of the world. The iconographer commented on some of his finds in a series of articles for Le Temps strat√©gique, collected together as Histoires d'une image. That Nicolas Bouvier lived in movement does not mean that he did not enjoy himself in Switzerland. Quite the contrary: he was involved in various activities, creating the progressive Gruppe Olten with Frisch and D√ºrrenmatt, after having left the Swiss Writers Society, which he found too conservative. In L'Echapp√©e Belle, √©loge de quelques p√©r√©grins he celebrates a Switzerland \\"rarely spoken of: a Switzerland in movement, a nomadic Switzerland.\\" The Swiss, sedentary? \\"You must be joking! In fact, the Swiss are the most nomadic people in Europe. Every sixth Swiss has chosen to live his life abroad.\\" Reasonable? \\"It remains to be seen! Under the ordered surface, the varnish of the Helvetic 'as it should be,' I sense the passage of great strata of the irrational, a deaf fermentation, so present in the first thrillers of D√ºrrenmatt, in Fritz Zorn's Mars, a latent violence that, to me, renders this country bizarre and engaging.\\" The traveller-writer, a close friend of Ella Maillart, thus sees in the history of his country \\"a constant of nomadism, of exile, of quest, of anxiety, a manner of not staying in place that have profoundly marked our mentality and, therefore, our literature. There has been, for two thousand years, a Switzerland, vagabond, pilgrim, often forced on to the road by poverty, and of which we speak all too rarely.\\" Bouvier received the Prix de la Critique (1982), the Prix des Belles Lettres (1986), and in 1995 the Grand Prix Ramuz for the entirety of his work. On February 17, 1998, suffering from cancer, Nicolas Bouvier died, in the words of his wife, \\"in complete serenity.\\" A few months earlier, he had written these words: \\"Henceforth it is in another elsewhere / that reveals not its name / in other whispers and other plains / that you must / lighter than thistle / disappear in silence / returning thus to the winds of the road\\" (Le dehors et le dedans, \\"Morte saison'\\"). Major voyages=Khyber Pass (1953‚Äì1954) Without even waiting for the results of his exams (he would learn in Bombay that he had obtained his Licence in Letters and Law), he left Switzerland in June 1953 with his friend Thierry Vernet in a Fiat Topolino. First destination: Yugoslavia. The voyage lasted till December 1954. The voyage led the two men to Turkey, to Iran and to Pakistan, Thierry Vernet leaving his friend at the Khyber Pass. Bouvier continued alone. Bouvier recounted the journey in L'Usage du monde, published in English translation as \\"The Way of the World\\".\\"Book review of 'The Way of the World' by Nicolas Bouvier\\" The pilgrim finds the words to express himself, and his feet follow them faithfully: \\"A journey does not need reasons. Before long, it proves to be reason enough in itself. One thinks that one is going to make a journey, yet soon it is the journey that makes or unmakes you.\\" The book was described as a voyage of self-discovery '\\"on the order of Robert M. Pirsig‚Äôs Zen and the Art of Motorcycle Maintenance\\". Sri Lanka/Ceylon (1955) With intermittent company, Bouvier crossed Afghanistan, Pakistan and India before reaching Ceylon.

It took him seven months to leave the island and almost thirty years to free himself of the weight of this adventure with the writing of Le Poisson- scorpion (published 1981, translated into English as The Scorpion-Fish).

These experiences led to Japon, which would become Chroniques Japonaises after a third sojourn in 1970 and a complete re-edition. It was published in English in 1992 as The Japanese Chronicles. In this book, he blended his personal experiences of Japan with Japanese history and rewrote a Japanese history from a Western perspectives. \\"Japan,\\" he says, \\"is a lesson in economy.

His appreciation of the air of the Irish islands is described as that which \\"dilates, tonifies, intoxicates, lightens, frees up animal spirits in the head who give themselves over to unknown but amusing games. It brings together the virtues of champagne, cocaine, caffeine, amorous rapture and the tourism office makes a big mistake in forgetting it in its prospectuses.\\" Works * L'Usage du monde, 1963, translated as The Way of the World, Eland 2007 * Japon, √©ditions Rencontre, Lausanne, 1967 * Chronique japonaise, 1975, √©ditions Payot, 1989, translated as The Japanese Chronicles, Mercury 1992, Eland 2008 * Vingt cinq ans ensemble, histoire de la television Suisse Romande, √©ditions SSR, 1975 * Le Poisson-scorpion, 1982, √©ditions Gallimard, Folio, 1996, translated as The Scorpion-Fish, Carcanet 1987, Eland 2014 * Les Boissonas, une dynastie de photographes, √©ditions Payot, Lausanne, 1983 * Journal d'Aran et d'autres lieux, √©ditions Payot, 1990 * L'Art populaire en Suisse, 1991 * Le Hibou et la baleine, √©ditions Zo√©, Gen√®ve, 1993 * Les Chemins du Halla-San, √©ditions Zo√©, Gen√®ve, 1994 * Comment va l'√©criture ce matin?, √©ditions Slatkine, Gen√®ve, 1996 * La Chambre rouge et autres textes, √©ditions M√©tropolis, 1998 * Le Dehors et le dedans, √©ditions Zoe, Gen√®ve, 1998 * Entre errance et √©ternit√©, √©ditions Zo√©, Gen√®ve, 1998 * Une Orchid√©e qu'on appela vanille, √©ditions M√©tropolis, Gen√®ve, 1998 * La Guerre √† huit ans, √©ditions Mini Zo√©, Gen√®ve, 1999 * L'√âchapp√©e belle, √©loge de quelques p√©r√©grins, √©ditions M√©tropolis, Gen√®ve, 2000 * Histoires d'une image, √©ditions Zo√©, Gen√®ve, 2001 * L'Oeil du voyageur, √©ditions Ho√´beke, 2001 * Charles- Albert Cingria en roue libre, √©ditions Zo√©, Gen√®ve, 2005 See also *Travel writing ReferencesExternal links * *Routard page on Bouvier Category:1929 births Category:1998 deaths Category:People from the canton of Geneva Category:University of Geneva alumni Category:Swiss writers in French Category:Swiss travel writers Category:Icon painters Category:Prix Louis Guilloux winners Category:People from Geneva ","title":"Nicolas Bouvier"},{"id":"4454884","text":"Kotavi, that is, an uncovered woman, is a mythical woman and the tutelary deity of Daityas.

Life Liu Dai was from Mouping County (ÁâüÂπ≥Á∏£), Donglai Commandery (Êù±ËêäÈÉ°), which is in present-day Muping District, Yantai, Shandong. He served as a Palace Attendant (‰æç‰∏≠) and the Inspector of Yan Province (ÂÖóÂ∑ûÂà∫Âè≤) under the Han dynasty. In the spring of 190, Liu Dai joined the coalition of warlords led by Yuan Shao to oppose Dong Zhuo, a tyrannical warlord who controlled the central government and held Emperor Xian hostage. Later Liu Dai had disagreements with Qiao Mao, the Administrator of Dong Commandery, so he killed Qiao Mao and replaced him with Wang Gong (ÁéãËÇ±). Liu Dai then arranged for marriages between his family and the clans of Yuan Shao and Gongsun Zan. Yuan Shao allowed his family members to stay with Liu Dai, while Gongsun Zan sent his follower Fan Fang (ËåÉÊñπ) to lead troops to support Liu Dai. When Yuan Shao later developed a rivalry with Gongsun Zan, the latter broke off relations with Liu Dai as well. Gongsun Zan said to Fan Fang, \\"If Liu Dai does not drive away Yuan Shao's family members, you will lead your men back to our territory. I'll attack Liu Dai after I've eliminated Yuan Shao.\\" Liu Dai was at a loss over how to handle the crisis when his adviser Wang Yu (ÁéãÂΩß) told him to consult Cheng Yu, and Liu Dai heeded his suggestion. Cheng Yu urged Liu Dai to stand on Yuan Shao's side and Liu followed the advice. Gongsun Zan was defeated and conquered by Yuan Shao eventually. In 192, thousands of former Yellow Turban rebels from Qing Province swarmed into Yan Province and gathered in Dongping County. Liu Dai wanted to attack the rebels but Bao Xin advised him against it. Liu Dai ignored Bao Xin and proceeded to attack the Yellow Turbans, and was defeated and killed in battle. In Romance of the Three Kingdoms In the 14th-century historical novel Romance of the Three Kingdoms, when Yan Province was conquered by the warlord Cao Cao, Liu Dai had no choice but to surrender. After losing his domain, he attacked Liu Bei, but was defeated and robbed of his position. Liu Dai followed his adviser Bao Xin's suggestion to join Cao Cao and had since been engaged in suppressing the Yellow Turban remnants. As his achievements increased, Liu Dai became more overconfident and he refused to listen to Bao Xin, which resulted in their deaths.

Its elytra are of a red colour, but punctuated with three black spots each, with one further spot being spread over the junction of the two, making a total of seven spots, from which the species derives both its common and scientific names (from the Latin ' = \\"seven\\" and ' = \\"spot\\").  Biology  A larva of C. septempunctata In addition to insect prey, seven-spot lady-birds consume pollen and nectar C. septempunctata mating C. septempunctata has a broad ecological range, generally living where there are aphids for it to eat. and including, amongst other biotopes meadows, fields, Pontic‚ÄìCaspian steppe, parkland, gardens, Western European broadleaf forests and mixed forests. Both the adults and the larvae are voracious predators of aphids, and because of this, C. septempunctata has been repeatedly introduced to North America as a biological control agent to reduce aphid numbers, and is now established in North America. It has been designated the official state insect of five different states (Delaware, Massachusetts, New Hampshire, Ohio, and Tennessee). Although C. septempunctata is mainly aphidophagous it also feeds on Thysanoptera, Aleyrodidae, on the larvae of Psyllidae and Cicadellidae, and on eggs and larvae of some beetles and butterflies.Savoiskaya, G.I., Coccinellid Larvae (Coleoptera, Coccinellidae) of the Fauna of the USSR (Nauka, Leningrad Branch, Leningrad, 1983) (Keys to the Fauna of the USSR, Published by the Zoological Institute of the Academy of Sciences of the USSR, No. 137) [in Russian]. There are one or two generations per year. Adults overwinter in ground litter parks, gardens, and forest edges, of treelines, and under the tree bark and rocks. In the United Kingdom, there are fears that the seven-spot ladybird is being outcompeted for food by the harlequin ladybird. Conversely, in North America, this species has outcompeted many native species, including other Coccinella. Massive swarms of C. punctata took place in the drought summer of 1976 in the UK. The species has undergone significant declines on the island of Malta, yet it is unclear whether this decline has occurred at the same rate elsewhere.  Anatomy and physiology  An adult seven-spot ladybird may reach a body length of . Their distinctive spots and attractive colours apparently make them unappealing to predators. The species can secrete a fluid from joints in their legs which gives them a foul taste. A threatened ladybird may both play dead and secrete the unappetising substance to protect itself. The seven-spot ladybird synthesizes the toxic alkaloids, N-oxide coccinelline and its free base precoccinelline; depending on sex and diet, the spot size and coloration can provide some indication of how toxic the individual insect is to potential predators.

According to Hindu scriptures, asvattha (, IAST: a≈õvattha) (or Assattha) at is, the Sacred Fig, is a sacred tree for the Hindus and has been extensively mentioned in texts pertaining to Hinduism, mentioned as 'peepul' (Ficus religiosa) in Rig Veda mantra I.164], a tree under which Gautam Buddha meditated and gained enlightenment. Ashvattha is a name of Shiva and Vishnu; according to Sankara this name is derived from the terms, shva (tomorrow) and stha (that which remains). The Atharvan were the recipients of gifts (given to Payu) in the Danastuti from Prince Ashvattha's generosity (Rig Veda mantra IV.47.24); the prince identified with Divodasa by Griffith. Yama while instructing Naciketa describes the eternal Asvattha tree with its root upwards and branches downwards, which is the pure immortal Brahman, in which all these worlds are situated, and beyond which there is nothing else (Katha Upanishad Verse II.vi.1). But Krishna tells us that the Asvattha tree having neither end nor beginning nor stationariness whatsoever has its roots upwards and branches downwards whose branches are nourished by the Gunas and whose infinite roots spread in the form of action in the human world which though strong are to be cut off by the forceful weapon of detachment to seek the celestial abode from which there is no return (Bhagavata Gita Chapter XV Verses 1-4). The former teaches that the Asvattha tree is real being identical with Brahman and therefore impossible to cut-off; the latter insists that the Asvattha tree must be regarded as unreal being identical with existence which needs to be cut-off. The Puranas such as the Padma Purana and the Skanda Purana enumerate the very many advantages to be secured from reverentially approaching and worshipping the Ashvattha (Peepul) tree. The first historical person named in connection with the worship of the Bodhi tree in Bodhgaya is Asoka whose Buddhist name was Piyadasi. The fire sticks used in Hindu sacrificial fire like agnihotra also contain dried wood of ashvatha tree.

Robert Pilkington was born in Dublin, Ireland in 1870. He was educated at Uppingham and Pembroke College, Cambridge, attaining a Bachelor of Arts before being called to the bar at Lincoln's Inn in 1893. In 1894, Pilkington emigrated to Western Australia. He practiced law initially at York in 1895, and then at Perth. He returned to Ireland in 1899, marrying Ethel Longworth-Dames there on 13 December; they would have one daughter before her death in 1920. After returning to Perth, Pilkington was made a King's Counsel in 1906, and practiced in partnership with Walter James from 1907. On 22 July 1917, Pilkington was elected to the Legislative Assembly seat of Perth in a by-election occasioned by the resignation of James Connolly, who had been appointed Agent-General for Western Australia in London. He held the seat until the election of 12 March 1921, when he did not contest the seat. Victor Courtney somewhat uncharitably described him as \\"a tall, austere, aloof English lawyer... quite out of touch with public opinion... He was a dyed-in-the-wool conservative and did not care who knew. I name him as the giver of the most tactless answer to a questioner I have ever heard\\". Robert Pilkington Pilkington returned to England later in 1921, and at the 1922 general election he stood unsuccessfully as a Liberal Party candidate for the two-member House of Commons constituency of Dundee. Pilkington was nominated to oppose Winston Churchill by a rebel group of Liberals including Garnet Wilson. At the 1923 general election he won the seat of Keighley in West Yorkshire, but did not stand again at the 1924 general election. He died at Wimbledon, England, on 30 June 1942, and was cremated at Putney Vale Cemetery.

Part of an urban area with 100,000 inhabitants, it is one of the most densely populated areas along the Adriatic Sea coast. Its port is one of the biggest on the Adriatic; it is the most important centre of Riviera of the Palms, with over 8,000 Phoenix canariensis, Washingtonia and P. sylvestris plants. History The round fountain in Giorgini Square. San Benedetto del Tronto was a martyr and a soldier born in Cupra during the reign of Roman Emperor Diocletian. Shortly thereafter, following the edict of Constantine in 313 AD, some believers built a chapel around the tomb. Since then, San Benedetto has been highly revered by locals. He later built a small church which included an apse facing the east and its entrance facing the west, in accordance with the early Christian tradition that the east, where the sun rises, and the sunrise is symbolic of Christ's resurrection. Historians argue that archaeological findings indicate Roman origins, linking San Benedetto to the ancient city of Alba Picena on the right bank of the Albula river. The first document which indicated the name of the village dates from 998. The document was an act concerning the investiture of the benefice of SS. Vincent and Anastasius in the territory of Acquaviva Piceno by Hubert bishop of Fermo. The document contains the phrase \\"Pede sive terra et silva Sancti Benedicti\\", referring to the city. In 1211, Emperor Otto IV granted the territories ranging from the Tronto River to the Potenza river to the town of Fermo. In 1245, Emperor Frederick II granted Ascoli Piceno a stretch of coast between the Ragnola river and Tronto river to build a fortified port. In the following years, there were disputes between Ascoli and Fermo. In 1478, there was a plague epidemic which decimated the city's population. The area remained virtually uninhabited until refugees from Romagna repopulated San Benedetto where they were granted land leases. From the 16th century until the 19th century, the Turks repeatedly invaded the city where they captured sailors and forced them into slavery. Since 1650, the urban center expanded beyond the city walls. In 1754, the first marine suburbs, Sant'Antonio da Padova and Marina, were created. In 1860, the \\"Cacciatori delle Alpi\\" freed the city from the dominion of the church. The Royal Decree giving San Benedetto the \\"del Tronto\\" attribute was in 1896. In 1936, the village of Porto d'Ascoli was absorbed into the city of San Benedetto del Tronto. During Second World War, the city suffered 144 air raids and 6 naval bombardments. Following the end of the war, the city's economy and businesses prospered. Fishing became a cornerstone of the local economy and in the 1960s and 1970s, the city became one of the largest national fishing ports. After the war, San Benedetto became a tourist destination on the Adriatic coast. Geography Panoramic photo of the urban areas of San Benedetto del Tronto (above) and Grottammare that form a single entity. The city has an ancient nucleus (the \\"high country\\" or \\" su d√®ntr√´ \\" in Sambenedettese) on a modest relief not far from the sea, at the foot of which develops the original settlement of the most recent part \\" Navy '. This is crossed by the Albula torrent and has developed over the years up to the river Tronto, to the south, incorporating the locality Porto d'Ascoli, while at north it joins with the Ischia district of Grottammare, with which it constitutes a single urban agglomeration that reaches almost until Tesino. Southwest following the river bank Tronto merges with the Centobuchi, a frazione of Monteprandone. Borders The municipality borders with Acquaviva Picena, Grottammare, Martinsicuro (TE) and Monteprandone. Metropolitan area of San Benedetto del Tronto The municipality of San Benedetto del Tronto and the neighboring municipalities of Grottammare, Acquaviva Picena, Monteprandone, Colonnella and Martinsicuro are not a single urban entity there being a solution of continuity between the settlements. This agglomeration has undergone a considerable and constant development since the post-war period to the present day: in 1951 it had 47.337 inhabitants, 70.140 in 1971, 96.012 in 2007 and 100.611 in July 2010 distributed on a territory of 125 km2 and with a population density of 805 ab / km2. However, the Metropolitan area (or region) of San Benedetto del Tronto, based on commuter flows and identified with the 'Functional Urban Regions' (FURs) methodology, is much larger. According to this methodology, all the neighboring municipalities that have at least 10% commuting rate towards it must be aggregated to the metropolitan pole. The metropolitan area of San Benedetto del Tronto thus reaches a population of 175,818 inhabitants, distributed in 23 municipalities within a radius of 15 km (including Martinsicuro, Grottammare, Alba Adriatica, Monteprandone and Tortoreto) from the city over a territory of 472 km2 and with a population density of 366 inhabitants / km2. Climate San Benedetto del Tronto enjoys a particularly benign climate Mediterranean, with winters mild (7 ¬∞ C or so of seasonal medium) and Summer C about seasonal average. The temperature annual average is about 15 ¬∞ C while the Precipitation are generally between 700 and 800 mm.Climate San Benedetto del Tronto Main sights Gualtieri Tower Gualtieri Tower The Gualtieri Tower (Torrione) is an old observatory dating back to the 12th‚Äì13th century located on the highest and oldest part of the city known as San Benedetto Alta. The tower is tall and provides a complete view of the city. Monument to the fisherman This statue is located at the point where the waterfront joins the southern dock of the harbor basin and reproduces the fishermen's estate during storms, when, to draw attention to the danger deriving from the looming fog over the sea, they used the trumpet. It is the work of Cleto Capponi, a Grottammarese artist. The Jonathan seagull monument The Jonathan seagull monument Created by the artist Mario Lupo in 1986, the monument to the seagull Jonathan Livingston Seagull, protagonist of the book by Richard Bach, rises along the southern pier promenade, the one that was renamed The Jonathan's way. The work, projected for 10 meters, encloses the life of seagulls and water in a blue circle. It is the symbol of the generous industriousness and tenacity typical of seafarers, people used to face and overcome obstacles and difficulties silently. Museum of the Sea Museum The \\"Polo del Mare\\" museum complex is composed of five sections: the \\"Augusto Capriotti\\" Fish Museum, the Amphora Museum, the Marche Marine Civilization Museum, the Truentinum Antiquarium and the Sea Picture Gallery. The first four are located in the Wholesale Fish Market area. The Pinacoteca del Mare instead is located inside the Palazzo Piacentini. = \\"Augusto Capriotti\\" Fish Museum = It is among the most important museums in the Piceno area. Named after the distinguished Sambenedese scientist Augusto Capriotti, inaugurated in 1956 it now includes over 9,000 specimens divided into: fish, crustaceans, molluscs, cetacea, echinoderms, coelenterates and fossils. Also interesting is the library containing more than 1,000 volumes including rare texts of historical and scientific value. = Museum of Amphorae = Housed near the port, it represents a unique collection of amphoras of disparate ages (Canaanite, Phoenician, Punics, Greek, Roman and Byzantine) collected throughout the Mediterranean from the Sambenedetti fishing boats that they practiced bottom trawling, a technique that had not been permitted for years, which made it possible to recover these lost finds from past civilizations. = Museo d'Arte sul Mare (MAM) = The Museo d'Arte sul Mare (MAM) is a permanent open-air museum that stretches over 1,150 meters along the 'Molo sud' (walkway) (called Jonathan's street ). It contains 189 artworks, of which 165 are sculptures made on the faces of the breakwater blocks of travertine lined up along the walk and 24 murals. The artworks have been created over the years by 164 sculptors and wall painters coming from 37 nations of five continents, guests of the International Art Symposium \\" Festival dell'Arte sul Mare\\" . The course The course of San Benedetto del Tronto The historic Viale Secondo Moretti, built at the beginning of the thirties of the last century by the engineer Luigi Onorati as part of the project that led to the construction of the waterfront, located in the city center, perpendicular to the beginning of the northern waterfront, has been for decades now, the meeting place of the Sambenedettese population and the surrounding area. Pedestrian area, recently renovated, home to the city's historic premises and numerous commercial activities, for some years now it has been enriched by a collection of works of modern art, in particular sculptures, by Ugo Nespolo, Enrico Baj, Mark Kostabi, Paolo Consorti, Marco Lodola, Paolo Annibali. The center of the course, a key meeting place of the town, is the Giorgini square (or Giorgini rotunda), dedicated to Carlo Giorgini, one of the most beloved mayors of the city, located at the intersection of the end of Viale Secondo Moretti and the north start of the waterfront. The fountain located in the center of the square has now become a symbol of the city. Seafront Promenade of San Benedetto del Tronto In 1931, on the project of the engineer Luigi Onorati, the promenade was built which, still today, as well as being an essential means of communication, is the center of San Benedetto. Considered disproportionate at the time of construction, it has a roadway with a total width of 30 meters and starts from the Giorgini roundabout (the rotunda), at the end of the central Viale Moretti, and, in its northernmost part, for the withdrawal of the sea consequent to the continuous enlargement of the port, it is very backward compared to the sea shore. Concludes at the Salvo D'Acquisto roundabout in Porto d'Ascoli for a total length of about 6 km. It is bordered by lush gardens, a pine forest, tennis courts, a skating rink and a building, the \\"Palazzina Azzurra\\", the city's local historian, on the mouth of the Albula stream that determines the end of the first stretch, to the south of which the most touristy area, with beachside resorts on one side and villas and hotels on the other side of the road. A peculiar feature of the waterfront is the abundant presence of palm trees (mainly Phoenix canariensis and Phoenix sylvestris) which have become a bit of a city symbol (today, between public and private gardens and along the city avenues, there are a total of about 8,000 palm trees of various species) in the tourist sense, having taken the same tourist promotion company the name of Riviera delle Palme. In 2001 the cycle path was completed which is a single walk to Cupra Marittima to the north and to Porto d'Ascoli to the south. The southern part of the waterfront has been subject to interventions at different times. In 2004, a radical reconstruction was launched which saw the modernization of the first part of the southern promenade: both the pedestrian area and the cycle path were extended. Then in 2007 the 2nd section was inaugurated. The cycle path is part of the larger project called Ciclovia Adriatica which once completed will connect the entire Adriatic coast. waterfall at the southern promenade of San Benedetto del Tronto In addition to the pedestrian area and the cycle path, there are \\"thematic gardens\\", the \\"oases\\": arid garden, wet garden, palm garden, rose garden, Mediterranean bush garden. The materials chosen are compatible with the new vocation of the waterfront in order to make these features look like real natural spaces on the sea, where to stop to admire the view, or for direct access to the beach. On the official website of the Municipality it is possible to admire the photos of the new waterfront and also make a virtual tour. In 2016, work began on the redevelopment of the northern promenade, which extends for about 2 km and goes from the \\"Palazzo Las Vegas\\" to the Albula stream. Riviera delle Palme The \\"Riviera delle Palme\\" is a beach located in San Benedetto del Tronto. It has annually been awarded a Blue Flag since 1998. The Blue Flag is a certification awarded to beaches and marinas by the Foundation for Environmental Education which qualify with its environmental standards. Economy Fishing boat inside the port of San Benedetto Fishing San Benedetto del Tronto has become, over the centuries, a fishing and tourist center of primary national importance. In 1912 the launch of a motorized fish-carrier began a process of transformation of the propulsion of the ships that, from the sail, reached the ocean fishing vessels. Alongside these events there have also been modernizations and developments also in other sectors directly linked to maritime activities, such as shipbuilding, hemp processing, cable and network construction, naval workshops, on-board instrumentation, fish marketing (San Benedetto boasts the most important wholesale fish market in Italy), the cold chains for the transport of fish. Although in continuous decline, this sector remains a driving force for the local economy if we do not consider only the properly maritime part (note that San Benedetto del Tronto is the second Italian port, behind Mazara del Vallo, for quantity of fish caught and number of fishing boats and one of the largest fish markets in Italy) but all related industries are taken into account and above all the highly developed canning industry which, established to support the marketing of fish, now operates on all food products, mainly fruit and vegetables. In San Benedetto del Tronto we also find a vocational training center for offshore fishing workers.  Tourism  Panoramic view of the beach of San Benedetto del Tronto The tourism represents the most important item of the city income. San Benedetto has established itself, since the early decades of the twentieth century, as a popular seaside resort. Since the second half of the sixties, it has also established itself as the first tourist destination of Marche in terms of number of presences. During the summer San Benedetto, triples and sometimes quadruples its inhabitants, can reach a daily population of between 150,000 and 200,000 inhabitants among tourists housed in accommodation and commuters. It boasts the Blue Flag of the European Community and invests in promoting and consolidating an image acquired not only nationally. This image has been conveyed, for about a decade, with the mark \\"Riviera delle Palme\\", a name which, sharing them under the same Tourism Promotion Company, also encompasses the other two countries bordering the southernmost part of Province of Ascoli Piceno, Grottammare and Cupra Marittima, as well as some villages in the San Benedetto area, Offida, Monteprandone, Acquaviva Picena, Ripatransone and the Lazio municipality of Accumoli (joined the consortium in 2008). Monument to the fisherman San Benedetto del Tronto has over 300 establishments including hotels, residences and Bed and breakfast; 150 Seaside resort and 42 free beaches along the Sambenedetto coast must be added. The proximity of San Benedetto del Tronto to the green hills of Piceno with important medieval villages, allows excursions for art lovers, history and food and wine lovers, within a few kilometers. Gastronomy=Typical local cuisine San Benedetto is in fact the home of \\"Brodetto alla sambenedettese\\", a Fish soup that differs from other recipes in the addition of Bell pepper and Vinegar. It is unique in its kind and has existed, according to the locals, \\"since the fishermen exist\\". Drinks As far as alcohol is concerned, the whole area of Province of Ascoli Piceno is known for the production of Rosso Piceno Superiore, Falerio, Rosso Piceno, Passerina, Vino cotto and Il Caff√® del Marinaio , an ancient recipe of the fishermen of San Benedetto del Tronto.

Airport The nearest airports are the Marche Airport (Raffaello Sanzio of Ancona - Falconara) and the one of Abruzzo Airport in Pescara. Ship The nearest port is in Ancona. Cycle paths Section of the cycle path (south promenade). The city has a large number of cycle paths, so much so that it is possible to follow it without interruption from the north (where it has a connection with the Grottammare cycle path) to the south (plunging into the Sentina Park). From 2001 to 2010, the section that completes a single walk up to Cupra Marittima was completed by extending the long Green Adriatic Corridor. In the coming years the construction of a bridge over the river Tronto is planned, which will make possible the connection between the cycle path inside the Sentina and the waterfront track of Martinsicuro (TE). At the central railway station and the Sentina natural reserve there is a free Bicycle-sharing system, for tourists and residents, called C'entro in Bici . The San Benedetto del Tronto cycle path is part of the Green Adriatic Corridor, the bike path that runs along the Adriatic coast and crosses five regions from Emilia-Romagna to Apulia. From the Ciclovia Adriatica (near the Sentina regional nature reserve) the Ciclovia Salaria branches off, a cycling route that, once completed, will go to connect Adriatic coast with Rome and the coast tirrenica (to Ostia) closely following the route of the ancient Via Salaria.

It is named after Duluth, Minnesota, the city where it was developed. The program was largely founded by Feminist Ellen Pence. , the Duluth Model is the most common batterer intervention program used in the United States. Critics argue that the method can be ineffective as it was developed without minority communities in mind and can fail to address root psychological or emotional causes of abuse, in addition to completely neglecting male victims and female perpetrators of abuse. Origin and theory The Domestic Abuse Intervention Project was the first multi-disciplinary program designed to address the issue of domestic violence. This experimental program, conducted in Duluth in 1981, coordinated the actions of a variety of agencies dealing with domestic conflict. The Duluth model curriculum was developed by a \\"small group of activists in the battered women‚Äôs movement\\" with 5 battered women and 4 men as subjects. The program has become a model for programs in other jurisdictions seeking to deal more effectively with domestic violence. The feminist theory underlying the Duluth Model is that men use violence within relationships to exercise power and control. This is illustrated by the \\"Power and Control Wheel,\\" a graphic typically displayed as a poster in participating locations. According to the Duluth Model, \\"women and children are vulnerable to violence because of their unequal social, economic, and political status in society.\\" Treatment of abusive men is focused on re-education, as \\"we do not see men‚Äôs violence against women as stemming from individual pathology, but rather from a socially reinforced sense of entitlement.\\" The program's philosophy is intended to help batterers work to change their attitudes and personal behavior so they would learn to be nonviolent in any relationship. Effectiveness A U.S. study published in 2002 sponsored by the federal government found that batterers who complete programs based on the Duluth model are less likely to repeat acts of domestic violence than those who do not complete any batterers' intervention program. A 2003 study conducted by the U.S. National Institute of Justice found the Duluth Model to have \\"little or no effect.\\"https://www.ncjrs.gov/pdffiles1/nij/195079.pdf However, this study had considerable shortfalls. The National Institute of Justice said in its introduction, \\"...response rates were low, many people dropped out of the program, and victims could not be found for subsequent interviews. The tests used to measure batterers' attitudes toward domestic violence and their likelihood to engage in future abuse were of questionable validity.\\"http://www.biscmi.org/wp-content/uploads/2014/12/Gondolf-Reply-to- Dutton-on-Duluth-Model-1.pdf A 2003 longitudinal, four-year evaluation by E W Gondolf, covering four cities, shows clear deescalation of reassault and other abuse, with 80% of men reaching sustained non-violence. A 2005 study led by Larry Bennett, a professor of social work at the University of Illinois at Chicago and an expert on batterer intervention programs, found that of the 30 batterer intervention programs in Cook County, Illinois, 15 percent of batterers who completed the programs were rearrested for domestic violence, compared with 37 percent of those who dropped out of the programs. However, Bennett said the studies are largely meaningless because they lacked a proper control group. He added that participants who complete domestic violence programs are likely to be more motivated than others to improve behavior and would be less inclined to offend again. A 2011 review of the effectiveness of batterers intervention programs (BIP) (primarily Duluth Model) found that \\"there is no solid empirical evidence for either the effectiveness or relative superiority of any of the current group interventions,\\" and that \\"the more rigorous the methodology of evaluation studies, the less encouraging their findings.\\" That is, as BIPs in general, and Duluth Model programs in particular are subject to increasingly rigorous review, their success rate approaches zero. A 2014 news report reported zero percent recidivism within 5 years for a batterers intervention program based on Nonviolent Communication, and contrasted this with a recidivism rate of 40 percent within 5 years for a batterers intervention program based on the Duluth Model as reported by the Domestic Abuse Intervention Project. Criticism Criticism of the Duluth Model has centered on the program's insistence that men are perpetrators who are violent because they have been socialized in a patriarchy that condones male violence, and that women are victims who are violent only in self- defense. Some critics argue that \\"programs based on the Duluth Model may ignore research linking domestic violence to substance abuse and psychological problems, such as attachment disorders, traced to childhood abuse or neglect, or the absence of a history of adequate socialization and training.\\"Fisher, Andy, Rick Goodwin and Mark Patton. 2009. ‚ÄúMen & Healing: Theory, Research, and Practice in Working with Male Survivors of Childhood Sexual Abuse.‚Äù The Men's Project, Funded by the Cornwall Public Inquiry Others criticize the Duluth model as being overly confrontational rather than therapeutic, focusing solely on changing the abuser's actions and attitudes rather than dealing with underlying emotional and psychological issues. Donald Dutton, a psychology professor at the University of British Columbia who has studied abusive personalities, states: \\"The Duluth Model was developed by people who didn't understand anything about therapy,\\" and also points out that \\"lesbian battering is more frequent than heterosexual battering.\\"Patriarchy and Wife Assault: The Ecological Fallacy, Violence & Victims 1994,9, (2), 125 - 140. (1994) Philip W. Cook points out that in the case of homosexual domestic violence, the patriarchy is absent: there is no male dominance of women in same-sex relationships, and in fact, female on female abuse is reported more than twice as frequently as male on male abuse. Furthermore, some critics point out that the model ignores the reality that women can be the perpetrators of domestic violence in heterosexual relationships, as well. Its proponents counter that the Duluth model is effective and makes best use of scarce resources.Michael Paymar and Graham Barnes, \\"Countering Confusion About the Duluth Model \\", Battered Women‚Äôs Justice Project, Minneapolis, Minnesota However, Ellen Pence herself has written, The Duluth Model is featured in the documentary Power and Control: Domestic Violence in America with commentary from its authors as well as its main critics, such as Dutton.

He served as a Labour Party Member of Parliament from 1987 until 1997. He briefly served on the front bench as a Whip but was not a prominent figure in politics. Early life Dunnachie was born in Glasgow and educated at St Margaret's School in Kinning Park. His father was a ship's rigger and upon leaving school, he was apprenticed to Fairfield's yard on the River Clyde before becoming a fitter at the Rolls Royce plant at Hillington in 1953. He was already active in the Amalgamated Engineering Union as a shop steward, and joined the Labour Party in 1967. Political career Dunnachie began his political career on Glasgow Corporation in 1972 in Pollokshaws ward. He worked on slum clearance as Chairman of the Clearance and Rehabilitation Committee; he lost his seat in 1977 when the Labour vote in Glasgow slumped. From 1978 he transferred to Strathclyde Regional Council and became Chair of the Social Work committee. Running up to the 1987 general election, Dunnachie was selected to follow James White as Labour candidate for Glasgow Pollok by 50 votes to 41 for Dave Churchley. Churchley was a member of the Militant tendency and there was some surprise at his failure to win the selection owing to the extent to which the local party was dominated by Militant supporters. An earlier round of voting had seen the Militant delegates vote for Dunnachie over Bob Gillespie, a non- Militant left-winger, which was speculated as deriving from their belief that Dunnachie would be easier for Churchley to beat; however it caused resentment among Gillespie's supporters.Mark Crail, \\"First deselection but Militant fails again\\", Tribune, 21 June 1985, p. 18. Parliament Dunnachie easily held the seat in 1987. He was re-elected in 1992, withstanding a challenge from Tommy Sheridan of Scottish Militant Labour who came second. In Parliament Dunnachie was a relatively quiet presence, usually allying with the left. He was appointed as an opposition Whip in 1988 and served until 1992, but opposed Neil Kinnock's move to drop Labour's commitment to unilateral nuclear disarmament. Initially he declared his intention not to pay his Community Charge (or Poll Tax) although he was never prosecuted for the offence, and observers have concluded that he must have decided not to fight. Dunnachie was a strong opponent of animal testing of cosmetics and of fluoridation of drinking water. His Catholicism showed in votes in favour of Bills which restricted abortion and against any lowering in the age of consent for homosexual sex, and he also opposed a deregulation of Sunday trading in 1993. He supported Tony Blair in the Labour leadership election in 1994 (and John Prescott as Deputy Leader). That year it was noted that he was one of the few MPs who had made no Parliamentary speeches in the previous year. Govan selection His attendance suffered as the Parliament went on due to persistent ill health. However Dunnachie did not announce his retirement and when his constituency was altered in boundary changes, declared his intention to seek selection in Glasgow Govan. This move made the selection in Govan much more open and eventually doomed the chances of Mike Watson who was the sitting MP for Glasgow Central, the nomination going instead to Mohammad Sarwar. In the event, Dunnachie died of cancer only a few months after the election.

Unlike many senior journalists of his time, he did not have a background in further or higher education, and instead, had taken a job as a 'messenger' on a national newspaper.Frank Johnson - Obituary The Independent newspaper. Retrieved 2 October 2011. Career He was a junior reporter at the North-West Evening Mail in Barrow-in-Furness from 1965 to 1966. One of the duties of news staff was to cover sport, which was an unwelcome intrusion into the weekend. Johnson once reported the score of a Barrow rugby league match inaccurately and was robustly criticised by his editor on the Monday morning. However, he never had to cover sport again. He was the editor of the conservative Spectator magazine from 1995 to 1999 and was a popular columnist for The Daily Telegraph. He had a particular reputation for his work as a parliamentary sketch writer, as which he was regarded by many as one of the most incisive and amusing commentators of his generation.

The College was a single campus situated in a residential area about one mile from Crewe town centre. It also served students from Nantwich, Alsager, Middlewich, Sandbach, Congleton and throughout South and East Cheshire. The College also provided courses for adults at a range of centres, including high street locations in Middlewich and Congleton.South Cheshire College ‚Äì Course Directory It merged in March 2017 with West Cheshire College to form Cheshire College ‚Äì South & West, which retains the Crewe campus. History The college began in 1843 as the Mechanics' Institution, run by the London and North Western Railway Company. It moved to its current site in 1966 and was officially opened by the Queen Mother in 1968. After several name changes, including Dane Bank College (which it is commonly known as locally), it became South Cheshire College in 1982. The original building was replaced by a brand new single campus building, started in 2008 and completed in 2010. The new campus is 4 stories high, but occupies a larger footprint than the original. New building opened in September 2010 The design of the Crescent shaped atrium was driven by the requirement to retain an oak tree copse within the campus area. The atrium curves around the copse on one side and on the other, a moat separates the copse from other parts of the campus. Five buildings radiate from the Crescent site, including the Library building, the Theatre building and the other three buildings, named East, West and North, based on the general direction each one faces. These contain academic classrooms and vocational workshops. In March 2017, Cheshire College - South and West was formed which was a combination of South Cheshire College in Crewe along with West Cheshire College which has a campus in both Chester and in Ellesmere Port.

It was owned and operated by Quidem. History Launching on Wednesday 26 March 2008, the station was established by the merger of two existing stations which originally launched in the late 1990s: existing Lincs FM Group station Fosseway Radio in Hinckley and the acquisition of Oak 107 FM in Loughborough from the CN Group in October 2007. Fosseway Radio Fosseway Radio was the original holder of the Hinckley licence, awarded to the Lincs FM Group by the Radio Authority in early 1998. It launched on the air on 1 November that year. Oak FM The original Oak FM launched on 14 February 1999. The station went through a number of rebrands and was eventually acquired by the CN Group in the early 2000s. In 2003 the station supported the \\"Give The Luffs a Lease\\" campaign in favour of Loughborough Football Club's attempt to secure a long term lease for the site of its stadium. The Radio Authority ruled that this \\"was acceptable because the station was satisfied that the vast majority of its listeners would support it and the issue was not made into a political controversy.\\" This licence became Lincs FM's first-ever acquisition, in the Autumn of 2007. Ownership history=Lincs FM (2008-2012) According to a memorandum to Ofcom, both stations had never returned a profit in their first decade on-air. To allow the station to become profitable, both studios were moved to a new site near Coalville generally equidistant between the two towns. Following a temporary co-location at the Hinckley studios, the new studios opened in the Summer of 2008. There were originally separate breakfast shows, with localised specialist programmes on Sunday evening. Outside of this schedule, the two services were identical but retained split advertising, allowing clients the opportunity to buy one, the other, or both transmitters if they wished. As networking was introduced in 2008 some presenters left, with others introduced from elsewhere in the group. The breakfast shows merged in 2010. The merge resulted in an increase in pre-recorded programming and redundancies. The weekend specialist shows became pre-recorded in late 2011, including the country show which had run on the Hinckley transmitter since 1998. Quidem Cuts in 2012-2013 did not produce sufficient savings and the station was purchased by Quidem in 2012, becoming the Lincs FM Group's first disposal. The station added Quidem's Hot AC mix with off-peak programmes being networked from the Group HQ in Kenilworth, Warwickshire. Following this most Lincs FM Group presenters left the station, and new presenters were introduced. The drivetime show became voicetracked. The station was sold by Quidem to ATR Media in August 2015 http://radiotoday.co.uk/2015/08/quidem- midlands-sells-two-oak-fm-stations/ Format change and re-brand On 21 March 2014 a loop of the Queen hit \\"Bohemian Rhapsody\\" was played consistently until 10am the following Monday morning, the station having relaunched with a male- orientated rock format. There is no longer any networking taken. Closure Oak FM abruptly closed down at 6 pm on Thursday 28 July 2016. The last song was Coolio's C U When U Get There.

The Act abolished the suspended Parliament of Northern Ireland and the post of Governor and made provision for a devolved administration consisting of an Executive chosen by the new Northern Ireland Assembly devised under the Sunningdale Agreement; the Assembly had already been created by the Northern Ireland Assembly Act 1973, passed two months earlier. \\"Status of Northern Ireland as part of United Kingdom\\" When the Republic of Ireland ceased to be a member of the British Commonwealth, Westminster had responded with the Ireland Act 1949. Amongst its other provisions, the Act had guaranteed that Northern Ireland would not cease to remain a part of the United Kingdom \\"without the consent of the Parliament of Northern Ireland\\" (s. 1(2)); this declaration had proven to be controversial both with the Irish government and with Northern Ireland's nationalist community. Since the 1973 Act abolished the Parliament of Northern Ireland, it replaced the 1949 guarantee with one based on a popular vote rather than a parliamentary vote (s. 1): > It is hereby declared that Northern Ireland remains part of Her Majesty's > dominions and of the United Kingdom, and it is hereby affirmed that in no > event will Northern Ireland or any part of it cease to be part of Her > Majesty's dominions and of the United Kingdom without the consent of the > majority of the people of Northern Ireland voting in a poll held for the > purposes of this section in accordance with Schedule 1 to this Act. A referendum on similar lines had already been held on 8 March 1973, with 98.9% of voters backing the union after a nationalist boycott of the poll. Schedule 1 of the Constitution Act provided that no further referendum was to be held before 9 March 1983. If the result of that or any future referendum meant that Northern Ireland remained part of the United Kingdom, a subsequent referendum on the issue could not be held for a further ten years. The Northern Ireland Act 1998 replaced the 1973 referendum requirement, requiring a referendum if it \\"appears likely\\" to pass and unity negotiations if it does pass, and reducing the gap between referendums to seven years.Northern Ireland Act 1998; section 1 and schedule 1, section 100(2) and schedule 15. Attempts to prevent discrimination Part III of the Act dealt with discrimination \\"on the ground of religious belief or political opinion.\\" Any existing Act of the Parliament of Northern Ireland, any Measure to be passed by the new Assembly, and any secondary legislation was declared to be void if it discriminated against an individual or \\"class of persons\\" on the basis of their religious or political beliefs. It was also said to be unlawful for the Executive or a government body to \\"discriminate, or aid, induce or incite another to discriminate\\" against someone on the same grounds. Discrimination was defined as \\"treat[ing a] person or [a] class [of persons] less favourably in any circumstances than other persons are treated in those circumstances by the law for the time being in force in Northern Ireland.\\" The Standing Advisory Commission on Human Rights (SACHR) was also created. Abolition of the Parliament, etc The Parliament of Northern Ireland, which had been indefinitely suspended on 30 March 1972 by the Northern Ireland (Temporary Provisions) Act 1972, was now permanently abolished. Its staff were transferred to work for the new Assembly. The office of Governor of Northern Ireland was also abolished. Unlike the position with the Parliament, his duties were not transferred to a new role but were mainly absorbed by the Secretary of State for Northern Ireland. Responsibility for appointing (or removing) the Director of Public Prosecutions for Northern Ireland was given to the Attorney General for Northern Ireland (which office was now attached to that of the Attorney General for England and Wales). Devolution Devolution was only to come into effect if an Executive (government) could be formed that had the support of the Assembly and that was \\"likely to be widely accepted throughout the community\\". The Act listed excepted matters and reserved matters; the former were areas in which the Assembly was not permitted to legislate; the latter were areas which the Secretary of State for Northern Ireland could transfer into the Assembly's power when and if he saw fit. Excepted matters *the monarchy *the Westminster parliament *international relations (other than dealings with the Republic of Ireland in a limited set of fields) *certain topics covered by the European Communities Act *the armed forces *dignities and titles of honour *treason and treason felony *nationality and immigration *pre-existing taxes *the appointment or removal of judges *elections *coinage and banknotes *the National Savings Bank *extraordinary powers for dealing with terrorism or \\"subversion\\" The Executive The Northern Ireland Executive was to be headed by a chief executive and was to include a maximum of eleven other members (including the heads of the various government departments). The chief executive was also to be ex officio \\"Leader of the Assembly\\". New members of the Executive were also required to take an oath (or make an affirmation): > I swear by Almighty God [or I affirm] that I will uphold the laws of > Northern Ireland and conscientiously fulfil as a member of the Northern > Ireland Executive my duties under the Northern Ireland Constitution Act 1973 > in the interests of Northern Ireland and its people.

He focuses on industrial organization, game theory, banking and finance, and economics and psychology. In 2014 he was awarded the Nobel Memorial Prize in Economic Sciences for his analysis of market power and regulation.Biography of Jean Tirole  Education  Tirole received engineering degrees from the √âcole Polytechnique in Paris in 1976, and from the √âcole nationale des ponts et chauss√©es in 1978. He graduated as a member of the elite Corps of Bridges, Waters and Forests. Tirole pursued graduate studies at the Paris Dauphine University and was awarded a DEA degree in 1976 and a Doctorat de troisi√®me cycle in decision mathematics in 1978. In 1981, he received a Ph.D. in economics from the Massachusetts Institute of Technology for his thesis titled Essays in economic theory, under the supervision of Eric Maskin.  Career  Tirole is chairman of the board of the Jean-Jacques Laffont Foundation at the Toulouse School of Economics, and scientific director of the Industrial Economics Institute (IDEI) at Toulouse 1 University Capitole. After receiving his doctorate from MIT in 1981, he worked as a researcher at the √âcole nationale des ponts et chauss√©es until 1984. From 1984‚Äì1991, he worked as Professor of Economics at MIT. His work by 1988 helped to define modern industrial organization theory by organising and synthesising the main results of the game-theory revolution vis-√†-vis understanding of non-competitive markets. From 1994 to 1996 he was a Professor of Economics at the √âcole Polytechnique. Tirole was involved with Jean-Jacques Laffont in the project of creating a new School of Economics in Toulouse. He is Engineer General of the Corps of Bridges, Waters and Forest, serving as Chair of the Board of the Toulouse School of Economics, Visiting Professor at MIT and Professor \\"cumulant\\" at the √âcole des hautes √©tudes en sciences sociales since 1995. He was president of the Econometric Society in 1998 and of the European Economic Association in 2001. Around this time, he was able to determine a way to calculate the optimal prices for the regulation of natural monopolies and wrote a number of articles about the regulation of capital markets‚Äîwith a focus on the differential of control between decentralised lenders and the centralised control of bank management. Tirole has been a member of the Acad√©mie des Sciences morales et politiques since 2011, the Conseil d'analyse √©conomique since 2008 and the Conseil strat√©gique de la recherch√© since 2013. In the early 2010s, he showed that banks generally tend to take short-term risks and recommended a change in quantitative easing towards a more quality- based market stimulation policy.  Contributions to economics  Tirole's textbook, The Theory of Industrial Organization, synthesised modern models of oligopolistic competition, analysing various cases where industries consist of a small number of firms with significant market power. He and Oliver Hart published a paper showing the conditions in which a vertical merger can result in foreclosure. Rochet and Tirole analysed the implications of 2-sided markets for competition policy. Fudenberg and Tirole also created a taxonomy of strategic effects in oligopolistic competition models.  Awards  Tirole was awarded the Nobel Memorial Prize in Economic Sciences in 2014 for his analysis of market power and the regulation of natural monopolies. Tirole received doctorates honoris causa from the Universit√© libre de Bruxelles in 1989, the London Business School and the University of Montreal in 2007, the University of Mannheim in 2011, the Athens University of Economics and Business and the University of Rome Tor Vergata in 2012 as well as the University of Lausanne in 2013. Laurea magistrale honoris causa Jean Tirole Tirole also received the inaugural BBVA Foundation Frontiers of Knowledge Award in the Economics, Finance and Management category in 2008, the Public Utility Research Center Distinguished Service Award (University of Florida) in 1997, and the Yrj√∂ Jahnsson Award of the Yrj√∂ Jahnsson Foundation and the European Economic Association in 1993. He is a foreign honorary member of the American Academy of Arts and Sciences (1993) and of the American Economic Association (1993). He has also been a Sloan Fellow (1985) and a Guggenheim Fellow (1988). He was a fellow of the Econometric Society in 1986 and an Economic Theory Fellow (Society for the Advancement of Economic Theory) in 2011. In 2013 Tirole was elected an Honorary Fellow of the Royal Society of Edinburgh. In 2007 he was awarded the highest award (the Gold Medal or m√©daille d'or) of the French CNRS. In 2008, he received the Prix du Cercle d'Oc; in 2009, he received an Outstanding Contributions to the Profession Award (International Association for Energy Economics); in 2010, he was granted the Chicago Mercantile Exchange ‚Äì Mathematical Sciences Research Institute (CME-MSRI) prize in Innovative Quantitative Innovations in Finance, the Tjalling Koopmans Asset Award (Tilburg University), and the \\"Prix Claude Levi-Strauss\\". He is among the most influential economists in the world according to IDEAS/RePEc. Besides his numerous academic distinctions, he was the recipient of the Gold Medal of the city of Toulouse in 2007, a Chevalier de la L√©gion d'honneur since 2007 and an Officer in the Ordre national du M√©rite since 2010.  Publications  Tirole has published about 200 professional articles in economics and finance, as well as 10 books, including The Theory of Industrial Organization, Game Theory (with Drew Fudenberg), A Theory of Incentives in Procurement and Regulation (with Jean-Jacques Laffont), The Prudential Regulation of Banks (with Mathias Dewatripont), Competition in Telecommunications (with Jean-Jacques Laffont), Financial Crises, Liquidity, and the International Monetary System, and The Theory of Corporate Finance.

Bar stools are a type of tall chair, often with a foot rest to support the feet. The height and narrowness of bar stools makes them suitable for use at bars and high tables in pubs or bars. There are many different types, construction materials and models. Bar stools are often made of wood or metal. There are bar stools with and without armrests, backs, and padding or upholstery on the seat surface. Bar stools can range from basic wooden designs to more complex ones with adjustable height. Extra tall and extra short are common features, as well as indoor bar stools and outdoor bar stools. Some bar stools have backs, while most do not. In commercial settings, swivel and floor mounted bar stools are common. Floor mounting renders the stool immovable, so it cannot be stolen or used as a weapon in a bar fight. Floor-mounted stools generally are mounted on a column, but stools with legs can also be secured to the floor using metal brackets. The normal seat height for a bar stool is 30\\" (76 cm) with a 26\\" (66 cm) stool being used against kitchen counters. Extra tall 36\\" (91 cm) stools are increasingly used in contemporary styles with high pub tables to create a visual effect in modern interiors. Counter height bar stools have a seat height of 24\\" (61cm). By comparison a conventional dining chair seat height is 18\\" (46 cm). Some bar stools use polyurethane foam as padding for comfort . Bar stools can be made from rattan or bamboo and these stools can be used to create a tiki bar effect. The retro styling of the 1950 and 1960s is popular in some bars and restaurants, which use chrome and vinyl stools combined with matching benches or diner chairs. Stacking stools are often favored for their space-saving qualities. Some establishments use matching bar stools and chairs. Aluminum is often used outdoors. Stacking aluminum stools and patio chairs are used by commercial premises. Indoors, wood and upholstery are popular in traditional settings. Bar stools are used in pool or billiard halls and the style of chair customized for such use is often called a \\"spectator chair\\". Bar stools are used in Ireland during weekends by followers of the English Premier League, a practice which led to the creation of the pejorative term \\"barstoolers\\" by supporters of the League of Ireland. Bar stools are a growth area in the consumer market and online purchasing is on the increase . Bar stools can be made to order and customers can specify a wide range of fabrics and finishes as well as specifying other options such as height and custom foot rests. Both wooden and metal bar stools, including stainless and chrome styles and adjustable height features are popular.

It can grow to 17 cm in length.  Characteristics of anemonefish  Clownfish or anemonefish are fishes, that in the wild, form symbiotic mutualisms with sea anemones and are unaffected by the stinging tentacles of the host anemone, see . The sea anemone protects the clownfish from predators, as well as providing food through the scraps left from the anemone's meals and occasional dead anemone tentacles. In return, the clownfish defends the anemone from its predators and parasites. Clownfish are small-sized, , and depending on species, they are overall yellow, orange, or a reddish or blackish color, and many show white bars or patches. Within species, color variations may occur, most commonly according to distribution, but also based on sex, age, and host anemone. Clownfish are found in warmer waters of the Indian and Pacific Oceans and the Red Sea in sheltered reefs or in shallow lagoons. In a group of clownfish, a strict dominance hierarchy exists. The largest and most aggressive fish is female and is found at the top. Only two clownfish, a male and a female, in a group reproduce through external fertilization. Clownfish are sequential hermaphrodites, meaning that they develop into males first, and when they mature, they become females. They feed on mainly on planktonic copepods, algae, echiuroid and sipunculoid worms, and pelagic tunicates. Adults generally inhabit reef passages and slopes. They are oviparous, with distinct pairing during breeding. Eggs are demersal and adhere to the substrate. Males guard and aerate the eggs.Breder, C.M. and D.E. Rosen 1966 Modes of reproduction in fishes. T.F.H. Publications, Neptune City, New Jersey. 941 p. Description The fish's body is short and deep; the head is small. Generally yellow in the body edges, it is yellow-brown to dark brown in the middle sides, with two white vertical stripes, the first behind the eye and the second before the anus. The fins are yellow to orange. Juveniles are a dull orange. The tail fins are generally white or yellow and vary depending on the area of origin (fish in the area surrounding Fiji and Tonga have yellow tails, fish from the Marshall and Solomon Islands have white tails). Dorsal spines (total) number 10 - 11; dorsal soft rays (total) are 15-17 in number. Two anal spines and 13-14 anal soft rays are present. It can grow to 17 cm in length. Color variations Fish that are generally blackish are associated with the host anemone Stichodactyla mertensii, Mertens' carpet sea anemone. Heteractis crispa is associated with brown males and juveniles. Only orange or brown juveniles are associated with Heteractis aurora (beaded sea anemone). Similar species A. chrysopterus may be confused with three other species with overlapping distribution, A. akindynos, A. clarkii, and A. tricinctus. A. chrysopterus tends to be darker than A. akindynos and the presence of black pelvic and anal fins eliminates A. akindynos. A wider midbar or tail bar is indicative of A. clarkii.

Opened in 1999, the mall was originally to be anchored by Dillard's, Parisian, Sears, and Upton's. The Upton's chain went out of business prior to the opening of the mall, but the contract to build the store was still completed, resulting in a vacant anchor when the mall opened. A home improvement chain named Dekor took over the Upton's site in 2000. The chain folded in 2001 and once again left the mall with a vacant anchor space. In 2003, JCPenney took over the site. The two-level mall has been very successful and was the first to bring upscale shopping to an underserved area. Shoppers previously had to travel long distances to other Atlanta area malls. Rich's, long planned to open at the mall, finally opened as Rich's-Macy's in 2004, one of only two stores signed with the hyphen. In 2005 the Rich's name was dropped, and became just Macy's. Parisian closed its store in September 2007 and it is bought out by Belk. Belk took over the Parisian store on late of 2007. Arbor Place Mall was built by and is still owned by CBL Properties (formally known as CBL & Associates).

It was published in 2002 by DC Comics' Wildstorm imprint. The series followed the life of Automatic Kafka, an android who had been a member of a mass-marketed superhero group called the $tranger$ during the 1980s. After the team breaks up, Kafka is lost, looking for a new direction in life. The comic follows Kafka as he tries different ways of becoming human: drugs, sex and fame among them. The series also visits Kafka's former teammates who each have adapted to their life post-$tranger$ in their own way. Plot The series begins with Automatic Kafka's first nanotecheroin trip. As Kafka ponders where his life has gone since the $tranger$ disbanded, The Warning is approached by the National Park Service who want to use Automatic Kafka for clandestine missions. Kafka avoids being trapped into service with the NPS by doing celebrity product endorsements and later hosting a lethal gameshow called The Million Dollar Detail. After an issue focusing on a side character, the series moves to The Constitution of the United States, who leads a group of mercenaries in an attack on a jungle camp. As he finishes, a mysterious flight of military planes bombs the camp with exploding babies. He then returns to the United States, where he embarks on a career as a porn star. Meanwhile, Kafka and Helen of Troy are enjoying a tryst when The Warning summons them to a social call with an old arch-enemy, Galaxia. Helen and Kafka both balk at the reunion, but eventually warm to the experience. Shortly thereafter, The Warning tricks Galaxia and kills him to power a machine that manufactures the mysterious exploding babies. As Kafka wrestles with the suicide note left by his drug-dealer/assistant, a phantom butterfly arrives to \\"rescue\\" him \\"from the possible tedium of another so-called 'story arc'.\\" The butterfly takes him to a comic shop, where he meets Joe Casey and Ashley Wood. The authors explain to Kafka that \\"You've been operating under different rules than most superheroes. You're part of an ongoing marketing experiment. Kids aren't flocking to superheroes like the used to, so now we've got superheroes for adults.\\" Because they do not want to share their creation with other writers and artists, Casey and Wood erase Kafka as the last issue ends. Characters * Automatic Kafka: \\"Morphing Mecha-Soldier\\", a nanotecheroin-addicted android capable of morphing his body into nearly any shape, usually guns. Formerly a member of the $tranger$, AK becomes a public celebrity to avoid, in part, having to work for the clandestine arm of the National Park Service. * The Warning: A wealthy government contractor who founded the $tranger$. He has nefarious connections to the National Park Service and is working on a secret project involving exploding babies (the baby plot was not resolved before the comic ended). * The Constitution of the United States: \\"Patriotic Combat Legend,\\" an ultra-violent, hyper-sexual patriotic warrior with red, white, and blue tattoos and a gas mask. The Constitution appears to work for a covert branch of the U.S. military. * Helen of Troy: \\"Feminine Powers of Mystery\\", an extremely sexualized woman whose erotic charms are her superpower.

First released on 12 December 2005, it largely consists of songs taken from Noir's first three releases, Eanie Meany EP, My Patch EP and A Quiet Man EP. Album description AllMusic‚Äôs Tim Sendra described the album as a ‚Äúblending of the cheesy drum machines and bubbling synths of indie electronic, the lo-fi guitars and adult-child vocals of indie pop, and the full-bodied and harmony-drenched arrangements of chamber pop into a swirling, soothing, and truly lovely Technicolor pop confection‚Äù. Album cover art The album cover art features a lighthouse, emitting heart symbols instead of light. There appear to be two versions of the album cover, one with a door in the lighthouse and one without a door. Critical reception The album received by and large positive reviews from music critics. At Metacritic, which assigns a normalised rating out of 100 to reviews from mainstream critics, the album has an average score of 73 out of 100, which indicates \\"generally favorable reviews\\" based on 18 reviews. Calling Noir a ‚Äúmelodic genius‚Äù, The Guardian‚Äòs Dave Simpson described the album as ‚Äúa cross between a classic 1960s album and half-forgotten children's TV themes‚Äù, ‚Äúrich in the sort of melodies you'd think went out with Simon and Garfunkel and Smile-era Beach Boys.‚Äù In similar vein, PopMatters‚Äô Dan Raper described the album as ‚Äúsophisticated pop music with broad appeal‚Äù that ‚Äúhums with 60s pop brilliantine and a slightly uncomfortable childhood nostalgia‚Äù. Speaking about notable influences on the album, Raper wrote that ‚ÄúJim Noir casually allows the history of pop music to inform his arrangements; luckily, he never allows them to overwhelm his natural sense of melody. Somehow, these sweet songs still sound fresh.‚Äù He further praised the album for retaining ‚Äúa sunny optimism that‚Äôs difficult to resist. For that reason alone Tower of Love is worth a listen.‚Äù In his review, Allmusic‚Äôs Tim Sendra especially noted the album‚Äôs ‚Äúcatchy and richly constructed tunes‚Äù, predicting that listeners ‚Äúwill be hard-pressed to keep from walking around all day grinning like a fish once you give the album an airing. In fact, doctors should prescribe a spin of Tower of Love to chase the blues away. The only problem with the record is that it paints Noir into a corner, as it will be hard to top.‚Äù In his review, Drowned In Sound‚Äôs Dom Gourlay concluded that ‚Äú[a]lthough not strictly an album in that it wasn't created for the purpose of such [...], it still wipes the floor with most other albums of a similar genre released this, or indeed any other year in the last ten. [‚Ä¶] Tower Of Love is a tasty entree that merely whets the appetite for the first album proper.‚Äù While praising its melodies, Pitchfork Media‚Äôs Sam Ubl criticised the album‚Äôs ‚Äúsubject matter‚Äù and Noir‚Äôs ‚Äútrying to emphasize the na√Øvety of his na√Øve-sounding music with na√Øve content\\": \\"Let's just say Tower of Love isn't out to offend or challenge or discomfit anyone.‚Äù Media appearances * For the 2007 holiday season, Target featured a commercial in which an adaptation of Noir's song \\"My Patch\\" is playing while windows in a large Advent calendar open and close. The original lyrics, \\"If you ever step on my patch / I'll bring you down, I'll bring you down\\" were modified. In the commercial, a different singer sings \\"Holidays are times of magic / We're counting down, we're counting down\\".\\"Advertising Age\\" * \\"My Patch\\" was used in a trailer for the PlayStation 3 video game LittleBigPlanet, which was shown at the E3 games conference, and the song also appears in the full game. The song is also used as the theme tune to the BBC radio comedy panel game The Unbelievable Truth. * In 2006, Adidas used a remix of \\"Eanie Meany\\" for their World Cup themed advert Jos√® +10, featuring the lyric \\"If you don't give my football back, I'm gonna get my dad on you\\" throughout.

It has 860 full-time and over 4,000 part-time and adult students. Highlands is a Partner College of the University of Plymouth (The University of Plymouth Colleges network), London South Bank University and the University of Sussex. The Principal from September 2019 is Joanne Terry-Marchant, following the successful 5 year tenure of Steve Lewis. The Senior Leadership Team of the college is Dreena Collins (Assistant Principal ‚Äì Students), Lee Johnson (Assistant Principal ‚Äì Quality), Rob Moy (Assistant Principal ‚Äì Business Operations) and Tina Upstell (Assistant Principal ‚Äì Skills). History The College is situated on a campus in St. Saviour on the site of a former French Jesuit training school Notre Dame de Bon Secours that was established in Jersey in 1894 on the site known as Highlands. The school trained sailors for the French navy but when the Jesuits were denied permission by anti-clerical laws to continue teaching, the school was moved to Jersey from Brest. The Jesuit period finished after World War I and the site was purchased by another French group The Brothers of Christian Instruction from Plo√´rmel in Brittany who set up a missionary school. During the second world war Jersey was occupied by the Germans and the site from 1941 was used to house 180 occupying forces. It returned to its previous use in 1945. In the 1950s and 1960s, the States of Jersey established a College of Further Education in a number of different buildings in Saint Helier, the capital of Jersey. The college taught mainly craft skills such as construction, catering, motor vehicle and secretarial courses. In 1970 the demand for missionaries had fallen away and the Brothers of Christian Instruction sold the Highlands site to the States of Jersey. In 1972 the States established Highlands College and over a period moved all further education to the campus that was also occupied by the Education Department. Extensive rebuilding has taken place on the campus to create excellent facilities in a wide range of vocational disciplines. This work was undertaken by the States of Jersey Public Works Department over a period of years under the charge of Architect Michael Dodds. There are plans to build a new campus fit for 21st century study, starting with a feasibility study in 2020. https://www.gov.je/SiteCollectionDocuments/Government%20and%20administration/ID%20Proposed%20Government%20Plan%20HD.pdf (page 64) Description Anchors on the fa√ßade and a statue of the Madonna and Child show the college's past as a naval college and Catholic institution The main feature of the college is its Great Hall.

Background In 1949, the American Jewish Joint Distribution Committee signed an agreement with the Norwegian Ministry of Welfare under which 200 places in a sanitarium for tuberculosis patients was to be evacuated so as to be made available for Jewish children from North Africa in the process of immigrating to the newly independent state of Israel. In April 1949, about 200 children from Morocco transited through the facility on their way to Israel, and this was to be followed by a group of Tunisian Jewish children. In Tunisia, which was then a protectorate of France, Youth Aliyah emissaries had arrived after Israeli independence in 1948, and with the consent of the French authorities, selected children for immigration to Israel with the consent of their parents. Most of these children were from poor families. On 20 November 1949, two DC-3 planes of the Aero Holland company took off from an airport near Tunis. One made it safely to its destination. The other plane, with the registration PH-TFA, stopped at Brussels-Zaventem Airport to repair the radio before setting off for Oslo. On board that plane were 28 children, most of them 8 to 12 years old, and seven escorts and crew. The crash As the DC-3 approached Oslo, the pilot encountered heavy fog, and lowered the plane while still in mountainous terrain. Near Hurum, one of the plane's wings hit a tree. The plane continued another 60 meters and crashed into a mountain at 16:56. The force of the collision overturned the plane, blew most of the passengers out, and ignited the fuel tanks, causing the front of the plane to burst into flames. Of the 35 people on board, 34 were killed. The only survivor was 12-year-old Isac Allal. Allal's sister and two brothers were killed in the crash. Aftermath The children's memorial at Yanuv. At midnight, Norwegian radio announced that contact with the plane had been lost and asked for the public's help. A search operation was initiated, and on 22 November, after 42 hours of searching, the wreckage and bodies were found. Allal was found, having survived the crash and stayed in the bitter cold on the site. The crash was the second deadliest air disaster in Norway at that time, exceeded only by the 35 deaths in the 1947 Kvitbj√∏rn disaster. Public sympathy ran high, and the secretary of the Norwegian Labor Party, H√•kon Lie started a fundraiser to build a Norwegian village in Israel. The funds were used in helping build the moshav Yanuv.Vilnai, Ze'ev (1976). \\"Yanuv\\". Ariel Encyclopedia (in Hebrew). Volume 3. Tel Aviv, Israel: Am Oved. p. 2872.

During his career he played as a striker from 1990 until 2008 notably for Aston Villa, PSV Eindhoven, Coventry City and the Ghana national football team. He is known foremost for his erratic career, in which he became a superstar as a teenager and then suffered a long string of failures which burnt him out well before his time. Lamptey has been used as a byword for a cautionary tale of putting too much pressure on young players to be successful. He also played for Anderlecht, Venezia, Club Atl√©tico Boca Juniors, Uni√≥n Santa Fe, Ankarag√ºc√º, Uni√£o Leiria, Greuther F√ºrth, Shandong Luneng, Al-Nassr, Asante Kotoko and Jomo Cosmos. Early years Nii Lamptey was born in Tema, but grew up in the two biggest Ghanaian cities, Accra and Kumasi. He had a miserable childhood, as his parents abused and neglected him. His father was an alcoholic who often beat and lashed him and sometimes burnt his body with cigarettes. Lamptey often refused to spend the nights home and frequently skipped school, only finding refuge in football. Soon, he began to excel in this sport, despite his father heckling him and hurling verbal abuse from the sidelines whenever he watched his son play football. When Lamptey was eight, his parents divorced, and his stepfather threw him out of the household. Lamptey found refuge in a Muslim football camp and converted from Christianity to Islam to qualify for entry. When his stepfather found this out, he accused his stepson of sacrilege and often quarreled in front of the football camp. But soon, it became evident what talent young Lamptey had, and he was called up to Ghana's junior squads. He was eventually reconciled with his father ‚Äì and readopted Christianity ‚Äì in 1997, only to lose him to an alcohol-related illness. Club career=Anderlecht Lamptey played for the youth team Young Corners in Accra, but wanted to move abroad to play. However, the Ghanaian FA refused and confiscated his passport, wishing to build a team around him in Ghana. He therefore was smuggled into Nigeria by a taxi driver, where he met Nigerian captain Stephen Keshi, who had heard of his skills. Keshi persuaded Lamptey to play in Belgium with him, and took Lamptey with him, giving him a fake Nigerian passport that stated Lamptey was his son. Dutch football Coach Aad de Mos signed Lamptey aged 15 for the Belgian team R.S.C. Anderlecht. He was hailed as the new Pel√© and age limit rules in Belgium were changed to allow him to debut at the age of 16 for Anderlecht. Lamptey signed his first contract at Anderlecht when he was 16, becoming the youngest-ever player to play in the Belgian league. His first season was a success, scoring 7 goals in 14 games. PSV Eindhoven He was loaned to Eindhoven, and quickly established himself as a prolific scorer, and continued to impress, scoring 10 times in 22 games. Aston Villa Ron Atkinson brought Lamptey to Aston Villa in the summer of 1994. This move came as a surprise, as PSV was a more successful club than Aston Villa at the time and Lamptey was one of the star players at PSV. However, Lamptey had signed an exclusive marketing contract with an Italian player agent. The player's agent, Antonio Caliendo, would get 25% of whatever Lamptey's transfer fee was, and accordingly sold him to Villa as that would mean the largest commission for himself. Lamptey's illiteracy allowed Caliendo to take advantage of him, even pocketing a signing on bonus intended for Lamptey. He failed to impress at Villa Park, scoring just three times, all of which came in the League Cup against Wigan Athletic (once in the home leg and twice in the away leg). Coventry City Following Atkinson's dismissal as Villa boss, he re-signed Lamptey for his new club Coventry City. Again Lamptey would score his only goals in the League Cup, netting twice against Hull City (once in the home leg and once in the away leg). His time at Coventry further proved that Lamptey was not cut out for FA Premier League football. However, despite his failure at Coventry, his name was not forgotten. From the start of the 2012‚Äì13 season, a group of Coventry City fans launched a podcast entitled The Nii Lamptey Show in honour of their former player. Later career Lamptey joined Venezia in Italy later was signed by Club Atl√©tico Boca Juniors and went on loan at that same year at Uni√≥n de Santa Fe in Argentina. There, he and his wife had their third child, Diego. But soon, Diego died of a rare disease. A major emotional blow was also the fact that Lamptey wanted to bury his son in Ghana, but the authorities declined. Heartbroken, Lamptey temporarily gave up football. After unsuccessful stints at Ankarag√ºc√º and Uni√£o Leiria, Lamptey got himself a new German player agent who transferred him to SpVgg Greuther F√ºrth. However, Lamptey and his wife were unhappy there, unable to live through the culture shock in Germany. Lamptey was not entirely unsuccessful, being a reliable backup, but was found too fragile for the rough Second Bundesliga. He was also reportedly ignored by his German colleagues, and once, a colleague flat out refused to sleep in the same hotel room as him. This blatant racism shocked Lamptey, but even worse was the fact that his child Lisa also died soon after birth. Also Lamptey's second dead child was buried abroad, in Germany. The Lampteys soon left for Asia. Lamptey then joined Shandong Luneng Tai Shan in China. He described his time there as the happiest time of his life, finally being accepted and loved by fans and experts again. He then moved to Al-Nasr and then back to Ghana to Kumasi Asante Kotoko, becoming the first Ghanaian star to return to his roots again as a player. On 5 March 2007, Lamptey signed for South African side Jomo Cosmos, playing here until 1 December 2007. Retirement Lamptey retired from football in 2008. He now breeds cattle and sheep on a farm on the outskirts of Accra. He served as a pundit on Ghanaian television during the 2014 World Cup. He also founded Glow-lamp International School , so as to give back to society and ensure than children have the chance to learn to read and write: something he was never able to do. As of 2017, his school has almost 400 pupils. He also has a football academy he coaches at in Elmina. Lamptey has said that despite everything, he does not feel like a loser, but rather as a hardened survivor who refuses to be destroyed, and whom God will not punish. Personal life Lamptey married Gloria Appiah in 1993. The marriage was a controversial one, angering his brothers, as Appiah is from a different tribe (Fante) to his (Ga). He had five children, of whom two died to lung diseases. However, a DNA test revealed he was not the biological father of the remaining three children and he divorced her. Appiah filed for an appeal in court, requesting 50% of his assets in the divorce including occupancy at the couple's East Legon apartment, but was refused by the judge. As of 2016, Lamptey is engaged to actress and model Ruweida Yakuba with whom he has two children. He has had a feud with Ghanaian star Abedi Pele, but refuses to disclose the reason. International career Lamptey first began to attract global attention in 1991. He led Ghana to win the 1991 FIFA U-17 World Championship with the team known as the Black Starlets after playing in the 1989 version as a 15-year-old. He won the FIFA Best Player of the tournament ‚Äì the Golden Ball award in a competition that also included Argentina's Juan Sebastian Ver√≥n and Marcelo Gallardo and Italy's Alessandro del Piero, Lamptey's star shone more brilliantly than them all, as he dominated everyone in the competition. He was subsequently touted as the next Pel√©; by Pel√© himself. He scored four goals in that tournament. Lamptey later stated that although appreciated, Pele's praise made life far harder for him, since everyone therefore had extremely high expectations of him that he was not always able to fulfil. The adidas Golden Ball could only go to one of the members of the victorious Ghanaian side, and so it was, with Lamptey taking home a very special souvenir from his Italian sojourn. Lamptey was the beating heart of a very good side. His fast feet, speed of thought, and clever interplay with captain Alex Opoku and fellow midfielders Mohammed Gargo and Emmanuel Duah were on display for all to see. His willingness to get into the box was critical too, and his four goals made him joint top- goalscorer. In recognition of his exquisite football he displayed at the FIFA U-17 Tournament, he was named the 1991 fifth best African Footballer of the Year. Lamptey's brilliance led an enterprising and unpredictable Ghana's U-20 team, known as the \\"Black Satellites\\" to win the African U-20 Cup of Nations and then lost the finalhttps://www.fifa.com/en/comp/report/0,3360,U20M-1993-32-30920-GHA- BRA,00.html of the 1993 FIFA World Youth Championship held in Australia to Brazil, who came from a goal down to win the trophy at the death, 2‚Äì1. He also scored in the matchhttps://www.fifa.com/en/comp/report/0,3360,U20M-1993-19-30939-POR- GHA,00.html against Portugal, which Ghana won 2‚Äì0. In the Summer of 1992, young superstar Nii Lamptey led Ghana to win a Bronze medal at the Barcelona 1992 Summer Olympics football tournament. Ghana, who had the youngest team by far in the competition (the average age of the squad was 18.8 years), were surprise bronze medallists, becoming the first African nation to earn a medal. They did so in a 1‚Äì0 victory over yet another surprise, Australia.https://www.fifa.com/en/comp/report/0,5733,OLY-1992-31-10621-AUS- GHA,00.html Lamptey thus led Ghana to success at any Youth International Tournament in which he played. At just 16 years, Nii Lamptey scored on his senior debut International for Ghana in a 1992 African Cup of Nations Qualifying home match against Togo in the 43rd minute. Ghana won the match 2‚Äì0. He became a regular International and his superb performances earned him a starting spot in the \\"Black Stars\\", forming a potent attacking force together with team captain Abedi Pele and Super striker Tony Yeboah. Ghana lost the final of the 1992 African Cup of Nations to C√¥te d'Ivoire on a marathon penalty shoot-out in Senegal, a game the mercurial Lamptey started at just 17 years. He continued to blossom at senior International level at such a young age, playing any and every Ghana International game since then. His international career with Ghana dried up after he was sent off in the 1996 African Cup of Nations semi-final game against South Africa on 31 January 1996. The Black Stars finished fourth, after losing to Zambia in the 3rd Place play-off game without the suspended Lamptey. Lamptey did not play for Ghana again after they lost 8‚Äì2 to Brazil in S√£o Jos√© do Rio Preto, 27 March 1996 in a Pre-1996 Summer Olympics friendly match. Many observers believe that the numerous back and forth travels to Africa for International matches, stalled his young career at Club level. His career later went into a slump.  Coaching career  On 19 February 2009 signed a contract as Assistant at Sekondi Wise Fighters; here he assisted the new Head Coach Charles Akonnor. He also owns a football academy in Elmina that he coaches at.

Hoch, A.S.C. ( )http://www.sos.mo.gov/wolfner/SayHow/?id=h#guide (July 31, 1905 ‚Äì March 20, 1979) was an American cinematographer. He was earlier a lab technician who contributed to the development of Technicolor before becoming a cinematographer in 1936. His understanding of the color process quickly led to his being hailed as one of Hollywood's premier color cinematographers. Hoch never made a film in black and white. Biography and filmography Hoch was born July 31, 1905 in Storm Lake, Iowa. Moving to California in 1924 and graduating in 1931 as a chemist from the California Institute of Technology,Variety Obituaries Hoch was a research physicist who joined the Technicolor company in 1934. His developing and familiarity with the three-color Technicolor process led to work as a cinematographer in the James A. Fitzpatrick travelogues. He won a technical award from the Academy of Motion Picture Arts and Sciences in 1940 for his contributions to the development of improved equipment for process projection. Hoch's first feature film as an associate cinematographer/Technicolor consultant was Dr. Cyclops, followed by the live-action portions of The Reluctant Dragon and aviation films Dive Bomber and Captains of the Clouds. During World War II, Hoch enlisted in the United States Navy, filming many top secret activities, including work at the atomic testing facilities at Los Alamos. Following the war, Hoch returned to Hollywood features beginning with Tap Roots. He made his first collaboration with director John Ford in 1948 with 3 Godfathers. This was followed with back-to-back Academy Awards for the expensive religious epic Joan of Arc in 1948, and then the elegiac John Ford Western She Wore a Yellow Ribbon in 1949 (an achievement that went unmatched until John Toll picked up Oscars for Legends of the Fall in 1994 and Braveheart in 1995). He received his third Oscar in 1952 for another collaboration with John Ford, this time on the film The Quiet Man, which made him the only cinematographer to share an Oscar with a credited second unit cinematographer, Archie Stout. Filming of The Quiet Man was done during intensive cloudy weather. Ford said of Hoch's work and attention to detail: \\"Never employ a cameraman to direct a film because he never sees what's going on.\\"p.362 Roberts, Randy and Olsen James Stuart John Wayne: American 1997 University of Nebraska Press The two former Navy men also filmed Mister Roberts and The Searchers, his final collaboration with Ford. In 1959, Hoch began his collaboration with producer-director Irwin Allen, photographing The Big Circus, The Lost World, Five Weeks in a Balloon and both Voyage to the Bottom of the Sea and Voyage to the Bottom of the Sea (TV series) where Hoch was awarded an Emmy Award. He also photographed episodes of Lost in Space and The Time Tunnel. Hoch's films included the war films Halls of Montezuma and The Green Berets, the Westerns The Redhead from Wyoming, The Young Land and Sergeants 3, a return to Ireland and Walt Disney for Darby O'Gill and the Little People and the science fiction classic Robinson Crusoe on Mars filmed in Death Valley. However, Hoch stated that cinematography didn't matter in a comedy because the subject matter didn't lend itself to dramatic lighting and overview.p.305 Schaefer, Dennis & Salvato, Larry Masters of Light: Conversations with Contemporary Cinematographers 1986 University of California Press Hoch finished his career on the American television series The Banana Splits and Nanny and the Professor.

Photochrom print c. 1890‚Äì1900. Cork, located on Ireland's south coast, is its second largest city within the Republic of Ireland after Dublin and the third largest on the island of Ireland after Dublin and Belfast. Cork City is the largest city in the province of Munster. Its history dates back to the 6th century. Origins Cork began as a monastic settlement, founded by St Finbar in the sixth century. However the ancestor of the modern city was founded between 915 and 922, when Viking settlers established a trading community. The Viking leader Ottir Iarla is particularly associated with raiding and conquests in the province of Munster. The Cogad G√°edel re Gallaib connects this with the earliest Viking settlement of Cork. The Norse phase of Cork's history left a legacy of family names, such as Cotter and Coppinger, peculiar to Cork which are claimed to have Norse origins. In the twelfth century, this settlement was taken over by invading Anglo-Norman settlers. The Norsemen of Cork fought against the Norman incomers, mounting an expedition of 32 ships against them in 1173, which was defeated in a naval battle. Cork's city charter was granted by Prince John in 1185. Over the centuries, much of the city was rebuilt, time and again, after numerous fires. The city was at one time fully walled, and several sections and gates remain. The title of Mayor of Cork was established by royal charter in 1318, and the title was changed to Lord Mayor in 1900. Settler outpost Map of Cork in 1545 For much of the Middle Ages, Cork city was an outpost of Old English culture in the midst of a predominantly hostile Gaelic countryside and cut off from the English government in the Pale around Dublin. Neighbouring Gaelic and Hiberno-Norman lords extorted \\"Black Rent\\" from the citizens to keep them from attacking the city. The Cork municipal government was dominated by about 12‚Äì15 merchant families, whose wealth came from overseas trade with continental Europe ‚Äì in particular the export of wool and hides and the import of salt, iron and wine. The medieval population of Cork was about 2,000 people. It suffered a severe blow in 1349 when almost half the townspeople died of bubonic plague when the Black Death arrived in the town. In 1491 Cork played a part in the English Wars of the Roses when Perkin Warbeck a pretender to the English throne, landed in the city and tried to recruit support for a plot to overthrow Henry VII of England. The former mayor of Cork John Atwater and several important citizens went with Warbeck to England but when the rebellion collapsed they were all captured and executed. Cork's nickname of the 'rebel city' originates in these events. A description of Cork written in 1577 speaks of the city as, \\"the fourth city of Ireland\\" that is, \\"so encumbered with evil neighbours, the Irish outlaws, that they are fayne to watch their gates hourly...they trust not the country adjoining [and only marry within the town] so that the whole city is linked to each other in affinity\\". Wars of religion The character of Cork was changed by the Tudor conquest of Ireland (c.1540‚Äì1603) which left the English authorities in control of all of Ireland for the first time, introduced thousands of English settlers in the Plantations of Ireland and tried to impose the Protestant Reformation on a predominantly Catholic country. Cork suffered from the warfare involved in the reconquest, particularly in the Second Desmond Rebellion in 1579‚Äì83, when thousands of rural people fled to the city to avoid the fighting, bringing with them an outbreak of bubonic plague. Cork by and large sided with the Crown in these conflicts, even after a Spanish expeditionary force landed at nearby Kinsale in 1601 during the Nine Years War. However, the price the citizens demanded for their loyalty was toleration of their Roman Catholic religion. In 1603, the citizens of Cork along with Waterford and Limerick rebelled, expelling Protestant ministers, imprisoning English officials, seizing the municipal arsenals and demanding freedom of worship for Catholics. They refused to admit Lord Mountjoy's English army when it marched south, citing their charters from the 12th century. Mountjoy retorted that he would, \\"cut King John his charter with King James his sword\\" and arrested the ringleaders, thus ending the revolt. In 1641, Ireland was convulsed by the Irish Rebellion of 1641. Cork became a stronghold for the English Protestants, who sought refuge there after the outbreak of the rebellion and remained in Protestant hands throughout the ensuing Irish Confederate Wars. An ineffective Irish Confederate attempt to take the city in 1642 was beaten off at the battle of Liscarroll. In 1644, Murrough O'Brien, Earl Inchiquinn, the commander of English forces in Cork, expelled the Catholic townsmen from the city. Although most of them went no further than the city's suburbs, this was the beginning of Protestant domination of the city that would last for nearly two centuries. The population of Cork by this times was around 5,000, most of whom lived outside the city walls. In 1649‚Äì53, Ireland was re-conquered by an English Parliamentarian army under Oliver Cromwell. Inchiquin had briefly led Cork into an alliance with the Confederates, in 1648, but the garrison changed sides again in 1650, going over to English Parliamentarian side under the influence of Roger Boyle, 1st Earl of Orrery. In 1690 during the Williamite war in Ireland, Cork was besieged and taken for the Williamites by an English army under John Churchill, 1st Duke of Marlborough. Eighteenth century Cork Cork Butter Exchange (pictured c.1900) was among the largest of its kind worldwide In the late 17th and early 18th centuries French Protestants (Huguenots) arrived in Cork fleeing from religious persecution at the hands of Louis XIV of France. Their influence can still be seen in the names of the Huguenot Quarter and French Church Street. Many new buildings were erected in Cork in the 18th century. Like Dublin, much of Cork's medieval architecture was replaced by neo-classical Georgian buildings. Examples of this include, Christ Church (1720‚Äì26), St Anne's Shandon (1722‚Äì26) and a Customs House (1724). During the 18th century, trade in Cork's port expanded considerably. Cork merchants exported large amounts of butter and beef to Britain, the rest of Europe and North America. Population explosion, famine and emigration King Street, now MacCurtain Street), c. 1900 During the early 19th century the population of Cork expanded. By mid century Cork had a population of about 80,000. The increase was due to migration from the countryside as people fled from poverty and in the 1840s, a terrible famine. This led to extremes of poverty and overcrowding in Cork city during this century. Another effect of this influx was to reverse the denominational character of the city, which became predominantly Catholic again. However, in the later 19th century the population of Cork declined slightly due to emigration, principally to Britain or North America. In 1825, over 1,800 Irish residents departed from Cork to emigrate to Peterborough, Ontario, Canada assisted by Peter Robinson (who organised the scheme on behalf of the British Government). This resulted in the area known as \\"Scott's Plains\\" being renamed \\"Peterborough\\" as a tribute. Cork and also nearby Cobh became major points of departure for Irish emigrants, who left the country in great numbers after the Great Irish Famine of the 1840s. During the 19th and early 20th century important industries in Cork included brewing, distilling, wool and shipbuilding. In addition, there were some municipal improvements such as gas light street lights in 1825, two local papers, the Cork Constitution published from 1823 and the Cork Examiner, first published in 1841 and, very importantly for the development of modern industry, the railway reached Cork in 1849. Also in 1849, University College Cork opened. Much 19th century architecture can still be seen in many areas around the city such as the neo-Georgian and Victorian buildings that now house banks and department stores. The Victorian influence on the city is noticeable in place names such as Victoria Cross (after Queen Victoria), Albert Quay (after Prince Albert), Adelaide Street (after Queen Adelaide) and the Victoria Hospital on the Old Blackrock Road. Since the nineteenth century, Cork had been a predominantly Irish nationalist city, with widespread support for Irish Home Rule and the Irish Parliamentary Party, but from 1910 stood firmly behind William O'Brien's dissident All-for-Ireland Party. O'Brien published a third local newspaper, the Cork Free Press. War of Independence Following the outbreak of World War I in 1914 many of Cork's National Volunteers enlisted to served with the Royal Munster Fusiliers, suffering heavy casualties both in Gallipoli and on the Western Front. In the period 1916‚Äì1923, Cork was embroiled in a conflict between Irish nationalists and the British state in Ireland. The turmoil of this period ultimately led to substantial Irish independence for 26 of the 32 Irish counties in 1922, but also to a bitter civil war between Irish nationalist factions in 1922‚Äì23. In 1916, during the Easter Rising as many as 1000 Irish Volunteers mobilised in Cork for an armed rebellion against British rule but they dispersed without fighting. However, during the subsequent Irish War of Independence 1919‚Äì1921, Cork was the scene of much violence. Burning of Cork\\" in December 1920 In particular, the city suffered from the action of the Black and Tans ‚Äì a paramilitary police force raised to help the Royal Irish Constabulary combat the Irish Republican Army. On 20 March 1920, Thomas Mac Curtain, the Sinn F√©in Lord Mayor of Cork was shot dead, in front of his wife at his home, by policemen. His successor as Mayor, Terence McSwiney was arrested in August 1920 and died on hunger strike in October of that year. On 11 December the city centre was gutted by fires started by the Black and Tans in reprisal for IRA attacks in the city. Over 300 buildings were destroyed and two suspected IRA men were shot dead in their beds by British forces on the night. This atrocity did not stop IRA activity in the city however. Attacks and reprisals continued in the city until the fighting was ended in a truce agreed in July 1921. Another, highly disputed aspect of the War of Independence in Cork was the shooting of informers. Historians such as Peter Hart have written that 'enemy' groups such as Protestants and ex-soldiers were targeted at random by the IRA. Gerard Murphy's book \\"Year of the Disappearances\\" put the number of Protestants killed in Cork at 73. This thesis is disputed by other scholars such as John Borgonovo, who write that their studies suggest that the IRA's 30 or so confirmed civilian victims in Cork do seem to have been targeted because the IRA believed they were passing information to the British and not for any other reason. Civil War The local IRA units, for the most part, did not accept the Anglo-Irish Treaty negotiated to end the war -ultimately repudiating the authority of the newly created Irish Free State. After the withdrawal of British troops in early 1922, they took over the military barracks in Cork and the surrounding area. By July 1922, when the Irish Civil War, broke out, Cork was held by anti-Treaty forces as part of a self-styled Munster Republic -intended to be a stronghold for the preservation of the Irish Republic annulled by the Treaty. Cork however, was taken in August 1922 by the pro-Treaty National Army in an attack from the sea. The Free State forces landed at nearby Passage West with 450 troops and several artillery pieces. There was fighting for three days in the hills around Douglas and Rochestown, in which roughly 20 men were killed and about 60 wounded as the anti-Treaty IRA contested the National Army's advance into the city. However the badly armed anti-Treaty forces did not make a stand in Cork itself and dispersed after sporadic fighting, burning a number of buildings and the barracks they had been holding (for example at Elizabeth Fort and Collins Barracks). Subsequently, they reverted to guerrilla warfare and took to destroying all the roads and bridges connecting Cork with the rest of the country. Michael Collins, commander in chief of the National Army, was killed in an IRA ambush at Beal na mBlath, west of the city on 25 August 1922. Guerrilla warfare raged in the surrounding countryside until April 1923, when the Anti-Treaty side called a ceasefire and dumped their arms. There were attacks on Free State troops in the city, but not on the scale of the campaign against British forces in 1919‚Äì21. Late twentieth century Cork Crowds welcome US President John F. Kennedy to Cork in June 1963 In the post independence period, Cork has been acknowledged as the Republic of Ireland's second city. It has produced a number of political leaders, notably Jack Lynch ‚Äì who became Taoiseach (Irish prime minister) in the 1960s. Its citizens half jokingly refer to it as the \\"real capital\\". Cork's inner city slums were cleared by the municipal authority from the 1920s onwards, and their inhabitants were re-housed in housing estates on the periphery of the city -especially on its north side. Cork's economy dipped in the late 20th century as the old manufacturing industries in Cork declined. The Ford car factory closed in 1984 as did the Dunlop tyre factory. Shipbuilding in Cork also came to an end in the 1980s. As a result of these closures unemployment was high in Cork in the 1980s. However, in the 1990s new industries came to Cork. For instance, Marina Commercial Park was built on the site of the old Dunlop and Ford plants and Cork Airport Business Park first opened in 1999. Cork, like other cities in Ireland benefited somewhat from the Celtic Tiger economic boom, with growth in industries such as information technology, pharmaceuticals, brewing, distilling and food processing. The Port of Cork is also a busy and important port. Into the 21st century, tourism has grown in economic importance, and in 2005 Cork was named European Capital of Culture.

The academy was established in Madison in September 1860 in a white frame building that still stands. The renaming of Convent Station would come later when Mother Xavier provided funding in the 1870s for the Convent Station train station just outside the front gate of the school campus. When the religious order founded the academy, they moved their motherhouse and convent from Newark onto a parcel that was located on the developing \\"Millionaires Row\\" that stretched from Lonataka Parkway to the center of Morristown, described as the \\"inland Newport\\" because of the numerous wealthy families who built grand homes along the route.DePalma, Anthony. \\"If You're Thinking of Living in: Morristown\\", The New York Times, September 5, 1982. Accessed September 23,2020. \\"From 1875 through the beginning of the Great Depression, Morristown and environs attracted dozens of millionaires who erected opulent estates and transformed the quiet town into an inland Newport.\\" In 1865, Morristown changed its incorporation to the new \\"town\\" category with a boundary that then excluded their large land holdings. Thirty years later, that boundary line officially delineated two governmental jurisdictions in 1895 when Morristown was formally set off from the rest of Morris Township. The College of Saint Elizabeth (renamed in 2020 to Saint Elizabeth University) was founded in 1899 as part of the complex and, notably, it is the oldest women's college in New Jersey and one of the first Catholic colleges in the United States to award degrees to women. After the new boundary delineated the governmental jurisdiction of Morristown as a smaller area, a community eventually grew up between Morristown and Madison as a separate entity that eventually took its name from the railway station built on the extensive Saint Elizabeth's property. The first students entered in 1860; the Registration Ledger of September 1 still resides in the principal's office, as do the records of every succeeding year. In 1865, the new Academy building was completed, and its first commencement exercises were held on the growing campus. By then, the school had gained a wide reputation for scholarship and was recognized and accepted throughout the state as an institution of strong academics, culture, and Catholic learning for young women. The Sisters continued to acquire land whenever it became available, allowing for a campus that is today more than and is also the home of Saint Elizabeth University. Initially, the academy served as a boarding school with students from many countries, but in the 1970s it became strictly a day school. The dormitories were converted into classrooms. Campus Today, the campus covers more than and also the home of Saint Elizabeth University, founded in 1899. Covent Station is an approximately three-minute walk from the academy and many of the students make use of NJ transit to commute to and from school. The Shakespeare Garden is located in front of the school. St. Elizabeth's recently held a contest to name the garden located in the rear of the school and decided on the title, \\"Sea of Flowers.\\" The Sisters of Charity live adjacent to the school and frequently participate in activities with the students. The Holy Family chapel is also found next to the academy, and the students often take part in mass on different occasions.

After lunch, students attend three of their four afternoon classes according to the rotating schedule. The school day ends with afternoon prayers. Traditions At the academy, there are many different traditions that are important to the school. One tradition is Spirit Week. During Spirit Week, students show spirit toward their school by participating in different activities. Another tradition is the Mother-daughter tea.

The Alma Mater competition is a competition between all four grades to make videos, skits, or songs to show their love toward the academy and to sing the Alma Mater along with it. The Calendar Party is a tradition where each grade gets a certain season assigned to them and the students create a party to represent something that happens in that season. The academy also has an annual spring trip abroad to all different places. The final annual tradition, the Senior Fashion Show, takes place around the end of the year. Seasterhood Seasters is what the students have come to call each other at the academy. Seasterhood is the term used to represent Sisterhood at The Academy of Saint Elizabeth and students at the academy call their peers seasters to represent that as well as being classmates, they consider themselves as a family. Transportation Students who attend the academy come from many different municipalities. Some of the students take the train to school. The NJ Transit stop, Convent Station, is at the front gate to the academy. The academy provides bus transportation for students who live in Florham Park, Whippany, Hanover, and East Hanover.

There is an assumption that this settlement, donated in 1515, became known as the Town of the Bishop, but the reality refers to several letters in 1329 and 1353, suggesting that the Aldeia do Bispo existed in the 14th century. In fact, Aldeia de Santa Maria do Cabo and Aldeia do Bispo were two distinct localities. Another centre in Vila do Bispo was the locality of Nossa Senhora da Gra√ßa, which was mentioned in a royal charter issued by King Ferdinand,Chancelaria de D. Fernando (Book LIV, fl.151, 25 June 1374), a document cited by Fernando C.C. Corr√™a (A cidade e o Termo de Lagos no Per√≠odo dos Reis Filipes - Lagos ‚Äì Centro de Estudos Gil Eanes - 1994 - p√°gina 19) \\"The initial limits of the churchyard (of Sivles) covers an area between Silves and the Cape of Saint Vincent.

Near this area are toponymic references to ZavialEither Zavia or Az√≥ia: a convent of Muslim origin, occupied by fighting monks. and the strategic Alto da Senhora da Gra√ßa, where, in Ponta da Torre there exists remnants identifying the regions importance. It is assumed that during the Reconquista (around 1248) this area was a difficult battleground for the Christians, who likely invoked the \\"Virgin\\" for protection during their bloody battles. After their victory the settlement began to be referred to as the Aldeia da Gra√ßa (or Nossa Senhora da Gra√ßa) for the grace the obtained in the conquest of these lands. It is likely that the settlement was depopulated following the outbreak of the Black Death (around 1348), even as two-thirds of the population was infected. Another important centre was founded on 19 September 1460 by Infante Henry the Navigator, where he wrote: \\"...I order the construction of a town at the other cape before the cape of Sagres, from the west...that I named town of the Infante\\". This interpretation has been controversial, owing to the particular reference to \\"before\\", which historians have difficulty in realizing. Friar Rosa Viterbo (1744/1822) in the Elucid√°rio suggests that in the old Portuguese, it meant \\"forth, before or in the presence. It is very much used in the 13th century and following\\". Henry's words were that the town was situated \\"forth, before, in the presence\\" of the Cape of Sagres, in a place called \\"ter√ßa naball\\" (an old shed of Muslim origin), where he named it Vila do Infante.

Although these references match the documented proofs, there is still some discrepancy in assuming that the town was built so easily, even as the coast was an active front piracy and lacked potable water. It was a Portuguese, Fern√£o Mendes Pinto, who claimed to be the first European to set foot in Japan, reaching Tanegashima in 1543. Aldeia do Bispo situated initially farther east of the current settlement, from the writings of Father Lu√≠s Cardoso, in the 18th century. The author mentioned that the parochial church existed outside the settlement, and the Aldeia de Santa Maria do Cabo (today extinct) was situated in the Curraes da Granja.Jo√£o Velhinho (2003) Bishop Fernando Coutinho (master of Aldeia do Bispo) received the donation from King Manuel, of the Aldeia de Santa Maria do Cabo and integrated ito into the perimeter of Aldeia do Bispo.Guida Carvalho and Lu√≠s Vidigal (2006) It was probably the privateer Francis Drake who was, later, responsible for the destruction of Aldeia de Santa Maria do Cabo.M.V.Gomes and C.T. Silva (1987), p.40 Vila do Bispo has only been a municipality for a recent period. Separated from the municipality of Lagos, since the reign of King Afonso VI (around 1840), when it included the parishes of Bar√£o de S. Miguel, Bordeira, Budens, Carrapateira, Raposeira, Vila do Bispo and Sagres (which was later carved from the municipality in 1519, and functioned as its own municipality until 1834). Extinguished in 1855, the region was reintegrated into Lagos. But, six years later, as a consequence of Liberal reforms, it was reincorporated in September 1861, with many of the same parishes, except Bordeira and Carrapateira (which were abolished in 1849, integrated into the municipality of Aljezur in 1849). The municipality was, once again, abolished in August 1895, and reincorporated in January 1898. In Sagres (which was a municipality until 1834) a coat-of- arms over the Fortress of Sagres was erected, ordered by the Viscount of S√° da Bandeira in 1839, then Minister of Marine Affairs (). This coat-of-arms included the arms of Infante Henry the Navigator, an armillary sphere and a ship with sails, under a Latin and Portuguese inscription. In honour of the first claimant to land in Japan, and owing to recognition of twinning with Nishinoomote on the island of Tanegashima, the main square in Vila do Bispo was renamed Pra√ßa de Tanegashima.

Part of Faro District, the municipality is bordered in the north by Aljezur (linked by the Estrada Nacional EN120 and Estrada Regional ER268), and to the east by Lagos (across the Estrada Nacional EN125). Due to its geographical location, it is the only municipality in the country with a western and southern coastline. The southern coast, which extends until Cape St. Vincent, includes several bays and sheltered coves, including: the beaches of Praia do Burgau, Cabanas Velhas, Boca do Rio, Praia da Salema, Figueira, Furnas, Zavial, Ingrina, Barranco, Martinhal, Mareta, Tonel and Beliche.

He is currently the head men's basketball coach at the University of Maryland, College Park, a position he has held since 2011. Turgeon served as the head men's basketball coach at Jacksonville State University from 1998 to 2000, Wichita State University from 2000 to 2007, and Texas A&M; University from 2007 to 2011. Personal Mark Turgeon was born and raised as one of five children in Topeka, Kansas. After graduating from Hayden High School, Turgeon attended The University of Kansas, where he earned a bachelor's degree in personnel administration in 1987. He is married to Ann Fowler, whom he met at KU, and together they have three children. Playing career Turgeon played basketball at Hayden High School, helping the team post a 47-3 record and capture two consecutive Class 4A state championships in 1982 and 1983. Turgeon earned All-State Tournament team honors in both of those years. Although only 5 feet 10 inches out of high school, Turgeon earned a scholarship to play basketball at the University of Kansas under Coach Larry Brown. Turgeon played in four straight NCAA tournaments, becoming the first KU player to do so. He was a reserve point guard for the 1985‚Äì86 Jayhawk team that won the Big Eight Conference regular season and tournament title and also advanced to the Final Four in the 1986 NCAA Men's Division I Basketball Tournament. The team finished that season 35‚Äì4 overall. Turgeon was a team captain for both the 1986 and 1987 squads, was a member of the Big Eight All- Freshmen Team in 1984, and was also a Big Eight All-Academic Performer in 1986. Fans called him \\"The Surgeon\\" because, in addition to the phrase rhyming with his surname, he had the ability to \\"carve up defenses.\\" After his freshman year, coach Larry Brown told Turgeon that he would likely never play in the NBA and should consider becoming a coach after college. Turgeon agreed, and Brown soon began asking his advice during games and practices, inquiring \\"What would you do here?\\" Turgeon remembers that he never got the answer right; Brown always sighed, rolled his eyes, and did something differently. Coaching career=Early positions After Turgeon earned a degree from the University of Kansas in 1987, he immediately took a position as an assistant to his former coach, Larry Brown. In his first year of coaching, he helped the team win a national championship in the 1988 NCAA Tournament. That team has been dubbed \\"Danny and the Miracles\\" due to the leadership of National Player of the Year Danny Manning. Turgeon remained on the Kansas staff when Roy Williams took over after Brown left for the San Antonio Spurs in 1989. He also served as the head coach of the junior varsity team. During this time, Kansas won back-to-back Big Eight Conference championships in 1991 and 1992, and also captured the conference tournament championship in 1992. Following the 1992 season, Turgeon left Kansas to become the top assistant to recently hired University of Oregon head coach Jerry Green, who had also been an assistant at Kansas. During his five years as an assistant at Oregon, the Ducks were invited to the NCAA Tournament for the first time in 34 years, earned a spot in the 1997 NIT, and had three consecutive winning seasons for the first time in two decades. Turgeon also served as the team's recruiting coordinator in 1995, and recruited a class that ranked 35th nationally. The following year, he signed two of the top 100 prospects in the country. Turgeon briefly left college coaching in 1997. When head coach Jerry Green left Oregon to coach at the University of Tennessee, Turgeon again chose to work for his former coach, Larry Brown, becoming an assistant for the National Basketball Association's Philadelphia 76ers for a year. Jacksonville State Turgeon accepted his first head coaching position in 1998 with Jacksonville State University in Alabama. In his first year as head coach, the team accumulated an 8-18 record, finishing tied for 10th in the Trans America Conference. The following season, his team improved to 17-11, 12-6 in conference, with a 3rd place conference finish. Wichita State After the 1999‚Äì2000 season, Turgeon returned to his home state as head coach of the Wichita State Shockers, a team which had had only two winning seasons in the previous 11 years. In his first season with the Shockers, the team lost their first 11 games before winning 9 of their last 17 for a 9‚Äì19 record. Of their losses, two came in overtime and four others were decided by fewer than four points. They improved the following season to 15 wins and 15 losses, the most wins the team had had in a season in four years. For the next three seasons, the team steadily improved, earning a berth in the National Invitation Tournament for each of 2003, 2004, and 2005 seasons. During the 2006 season, the Shockers continued to improve, winning the Missouri Valley Conference for the first time since 1983. The team earned a trip to the 2006 NCAA Tournament, the program's first since 1988. The Shockers defeated 10th-seed Seton Hall by 20 points in their first round game and upset 2nd-seed Tennessee to advance to the Sweet Sixteen for the first time in 25 years. The Shockers were then defeated by Final Four-participant George Mason, 63-55. Turgeon and the Shockers started the 2006-2007 season 9-0, winning on the road at George Mason, LSU, and Syracuse. The Shockers were ranked as high as #8 on the AP Poll before entering a slump, ending the season 17-14 and without a postseason. Texas A&M;2007‚Äì08 season= A&M;'s last offensive play in the UCLA game After former head men's basketball coach Billy Gillispie left Texas A&M; to coach at Kentucky, Turgeon was immediately hired as head coach on April 10, 2007. Turgeon acquired all of Gillispie's recruits for the 2007‚Äì08 season, including 5 star-rated DeAndre Jordan. The Aggies started the season ranked 14th in the preseason Coaches Poll. Once the season progressed, they won the 2007 NIT Season Tip-Off to extend their winning streak to 7‚Äì0. They would lose their first game of the season to unranked Arizona, compiling a 7‚Äì1 record after the loss. After the Arizona game, they would then win eight straight home games against unranked opponents. Team performance spiraled down once conference play had begun, losing three straight unranked teams‚Äîat Texas Tech, at Michael Beasley-led Kansas State, and at home to Baylor. The Baylor game took five overtimes, becoming the longest game in Big 12 history. The Aggies could post wins at their next five matchups, including one over the 10th-ranked rival Texas Longhorns and three away games. They then regressed, losing to Oklahoma State and Nebraska at home. Another high point came when they defeated Texas Tech 98‚Äì54 at home, matching their highest margin of victory in school history (set in 1959 against Texas). The Aggies regressed once again, this time losing 64‚Äì37 at Oklahoma. The game had marked the worst loss in history since 1967 and had the third-worst shooting percentage (.255) in history. The team also had only one assist and 18 turnovers in the game. After the blowout, the Aggies were able to revenge Baylor in Waco, though came back home to lose their final regular season game to eventual national champion Kansas to finish 8‚Äì8 in conference play. The team received a No. 6 bid to the Big 12 tournament, defeating Iowa State and Kansas State in the first two rounds, but lost to Kansas again in the semifinals. With their 24‚Äì10 record after the Big 12 tournament, the Aggies received a No. 9 at-large bid to the West Regional of the NCAA tournament. In the first round, they defeated 8th-seeded BYU 67‚Äì62 at Anaheim. In the second round, they faced UCLA at the same site, losing in a close 51‚Äì49 contest. The Aggies finished the season with a 25‚Äì11 record. The 25 wins matches the record for most wins by a first- year coach at a Big 12 school, set by former Texas coach Tom Penders in the 1988‚Äì89 season. =2008‚Äì09 season= Turgeon's Aggies started the year unranked, with senior Josh Carter receiving preseason All-Big 12 honorable mention. The team won its first four games before falling against Tulsa. After that, the Aggies won 10 straight to close out non-conference play with a 14‚Äì1 record. They lost four of their first five Big 12 games, the win coming against then-#21 Baylor. Following a three-game losing streak, A&M; won two straight at home against Texas Tech and Oklahoma State before bookending it with another three-game losing streak. The Aggies then won their final six games to close out the season, including wins over rival Texas, Nebraska (on Carter's three-pointer at the buzzer), and then-#12 Missouri. Finishing the regular season with a 23‚Äì8 record, the Aggies lost to Texas Tech in the first round of the Big 12 tournament. They earned a #9 seed in the NCAA Tournament West Regional and, for the second straight year, a matchup with BYU. After defeating BYU for the second straight year, 79‚Äì66, the Aggies came up short against #1 seed and eventual Final Four participant Connecticut. Texas A&M; finished the season with a 24‚Äì10 record; Turgeon's 49 wins in his first two seasons was the most by any new coach in Big 12 history. Junior Derrick Roland was selected to the Big 12 All-Defensive Team. Turgeon's recruiting class for the Class of 2013 was ranked #25 by ESPN. =2009‚Äì10 season=2010‚Äì11 seasonMaryland Turgeon in 2020 Prior to his last year at Texas A&M;, Turgeon had negotiated a contract extension and salary increase. On the evening of May 9, 2011 at 8pm (local time), Turgeon met with his coaching staff and players to inform them that half an hour earlier he accepted the head coach position at the University of Maryland. He had visited the campus earlier that day and left with an offer. When asked about his decision at an Aggie Athletics press conference, he said \\"Maryland's got a great basketball tradition. [Texas A&M; and Maryland are] real similar. It's a gut feeling.\\" In their meeting earlier that night he told the Aggie players \\"it was the hardest decision [he] ever had to make... because of [them].\\" Turgeon said that fan attendance at A&M; did not factor into his decision. Since his arrival, Maryland students have adopted the phrase \\"Fear the Turgeon,\\" a play on the school's motto, \\"Fear the Turtle.\\"> l Some students, known as the \\"Turgeonites,\\" have created a fan club for the coach and dress like him on game days. Turgeon captured his first win as the University of Maryland head coach on November 13, 2011 after defeating UNC Wilmington 71-62. In his first three seasons, Turgeon led Maryland to one postseason, an appearance in the NIT Semifinals in 2013. In 2015, Turgeon was named Big Ten Coach of the Year, after coaching Maryland to a 14-4 conference record. The 2015-16 Terrapins advanced to the Sweet 16 of the NCAA Tournament, defeating South Dakota State and Hawaii as the #5 seed in the South region.

It was opened in 1876 and rebuilt during 1890-91, and is the oldest theatre still standing in New South Wales. It was added to the New South Wales State Heritage Register on 27 August 1999. The Victoria is only one of several large stage and screen theatres built across the city from the 1870s until the early twentieth-century that have since been closed down. Others of importance were the Central Mission Theatre on King Street, the Theatre Royal on Hunter Street West, as well as the Strand (demolished) and Lyric cinemas.  History  The first Victoria Theatre was built on the site in 1876. This was altered in 1885 and razed in 1890. The third Victoria Theatre was built in 1890 and closed as a cinema in 1966. Early performances at the theatre included Deglorian Acrobats (1880) and the Montague-Turner Opera Company (1881), the latter performing Lucia di Lammermoor, Il trovatore and Faust. In 1886, a company of prominent men including the mayors of both Newcastle (Mr J. Creer) and Maitland met in Newcastle and agreed to buy the theatre. The theatre was extensively rebuilt in 1890. The architect in charge of the 1890 rebuilding was Mr. James Henderson, who elaborately furnished the three level auditorium in neo-Grecian theme. A large stage house and a small first class hotel were also incorporated in the second theatre that could seat 1,700 people. The stalls were steeply sloped and the dress circle could accommodate 500 people. It was fitted with American-style folding seats. The stage was wide, deep and high. The Fletcher Memorial concerts were held in 1893, raising funds for a statue of the late James Fletcher MLA with Alexander Brown, MLC opening the concerts. In May 1897 there was the Grand Concert Governor's Reception under the immediate patronage of His Excellency Lord Hampden and Lady Hampden and the Mayor and Mayoress of Sydney and Newcastle. May/June saw the Flying Jordons American Vaudeville Athletes and Entertainers and also Ireland revisited. On several full moon nights in June the city/region celebrated Her Majesty Queen Victoria's Record Reign. The exterior of the theatre was brilliantly illuminated and a transparency of Her Majesty was exhibited on the front of the theatre while 4th Regiment band played a number of selections in Perkins Street. National Anthem was sung, Mr C. Hannell performed Hamlet and Othello in aid of Newcastle Hospital, Lime light views of 'A day's holiday at Windsor' - life like views of Her Majesty and the Royal Family by G. Hall and T. Simon, concluding with fireworks. July saw Ada Delroy Company with Cobra Di Capello Dance and the Lumeire Cinematographe. During September the City celebrated the Centennial of Lieutenant John Shortland's Discovery of Newcastle and Alfred Dampier's Company presented his plays including: Robbery Under Arms, Monte Cristo, East Lynne etc. October saw Professor D M Bristo, who had his performing Horses, Ponies and Mules on stage. The theatre's facilities were upgraded in 1905 by Architect Mr E. A. Scott of Sydney with Government approval, the auditorium was redecorated and extra dressing rooms were built which allow the stage to be widened. A number of Australian melodramas were staged at the theatre, including Thunderbolt (1906), The Squatter's Daughter (1909), For The Term of His Natural Life (1909), On Our Selection (1913) and Seven Little Australians (1920). The Great Glove Contest Boxing between legendary Les Darcy and Bob Whitelaw was held on Eight Hour Day morning, November 1913. After 20 hard rounds, Whitelaw was awarded the decision. Lilly Lantry had her first appearance in Newcastle in 1913. Another show for charity, Romeo and Juliet, with Miss Essie Jenyns alias Mrs J. R. Wood and Mr Malcolm McEachern of Madam Melba Concert Company with funds in aid of Newcastle Hospital in 1914. Madam Schell's bewildering Lions also appeared in 1914. Subsequent changes to the liquor laws meant that the theatre could no longer contain a hotel, so 1921 there were extensive renovations to convert the theatre into dual stage and screen use. Late 1921 saw a major internal refurbishment costing 20,000 pounds, removing the upper balcony and small hotel, rebuilding the dress circle and making it more suitable for use as a cinema. The auditorium was redecorated by Artist Norman Carter with painted Grecian Murals of Dancing Nymphs. Architects for the refurbishment were Robertson and Marks who later designed the late ornate Prince Edward Theatre and the Bondi Beach Pavilion and builders were James Porter and Sons later builders for the Sydney Capitol, Regent and Melbourne's grand Regent theatres. Mr Will Herbert became the General Manager for northern district. In early 1922, the Victoria was taken over by Sir Benjamin and John Fuller of Melbourne's Princess Theatre fame and they built the large late Sydney St. James Theatre and added the Newcastle Victoria to their national live theatre chain. Hoyts took control of the Victoria in 1942. CinemaScope was installed around 1955, with no widening of the somewhat decorated proscenium. J C Williamson's continued to put on live shows there into the 1950s and 1960s. It was in the Victoria Theatre that the Hunter Region was introduced to theatre companies such as J. C. Williamsons, Fuller's and the Elizabethan Theatre Trust. George Wallace visited the theatre in 1926. Gladys Moncrieff made her first Newcastle appearance with Rio Rita in 1928. It saw an expensive Italian Opera Festival in 1928‚Äì29, with 12 operates in 10 days. Other performances included Odiva and Her Seals (1922), Midnight Frolics with Clem Dawe (1928, 1932), Gilbert and Sullivan collection (1905, 1906, 1927, 1936), the Royal Grand Opera in 1935, and the Gala Patriotic Matinee with Roy Mo Rene in 1940. The theatre was used for films by Haymarket, Union Theatres, Snider and Dean and Hoyts. It is believed that Hoyts repainted the auditorium. Movies shown at the Victoria Theatre included: A Daughter of the Gods, Trader Horn, Gone With The Wind, Seven Little Australians, The 39 Steps, Fantasia, Snow White and the Seven Dwarfs and The White Cliffs of Dover. In the 1950s and 1960s, the theatre saw an ice skating show from the United States (1953), Oklahoma! (1953), National Opera seasons in 1951 with Ivan Menzies and 1954, Joan Hammond singing in Tosca in 1957, Ziegfeld Follies (1962), Snow White and the Seven Dwarfs from London (1963), The Sound of Music (1963) and June Bronhill performing the Merry Widow (1964). After a 90-year career, the theatre quietly closed as a cinema in the late 1960s. It was retained in a certain way as if, it could be reopened for example live theatre.Heritas, 2016, 4Griffin, 1999Movie Theatre Register, Department of Architecture, University of Sydney Since closing the theatre the vestibule (lower foyer) and back stalls area has been subject to alteration for retail purposes. It was bought by W. Eastham for 33,000 pounds in November 1966 and in 1967 it opened as Eastham's Theatre Store. This went into liquidation in 1982. clothing business Jeans Connection rented the building on a weekly basis, creating an internal retail shell. In 1999 the building was bought by Ambrow P/L and opened as a toyshop (Supertoys). In 2004 it was bought by veteran hotelier Arthur Launry, and after being empty and derelict for a decade, it was sold to Century Venues (owners of the Enmore Theatre) in November 2015 with plans to refurbish it to its former glory. Performances When in operation, the Victoria was the principal theatre in Newcastle, and over the course of its history had attracted performers such as Gladys Moncrieff, Lily Langtry, Richard Tauber, Joan Hammond and June Bronhill. Touring companies also performed at the Victoria, notably London's D'Oyly Carte Opera Company, as well as ballet troupes. Australian actor Jim Gerald performed at the Victoria Theatre on 4 September 1915 as a part of his country-wide tour. It was the actor's second last performance before joining the Australian Imperial Forces during the First World War. The dual career of the nation's oldest theatre ended quietly during 1966 with the screening of a Bette Davis 'B' film Who's Buried in my Grave. After 90 years of uninterrupted service, the interior of the Victoria has been left practically untouched by owners to ensure that it maintains the potential to be reopened in the future.  Description  Victoria Theatre, circa 1890s A highly decorated Victorian facade finished in smooth and modelled stucco with some classical decorative elements. The facade forms the front to a large auditorium of undecorated plain finishes. The facade consists of a ground floor, which has been altered to suit progressive tenants. The two levels above the awning is divided by deep string courses and divided into bays by pilasters. The top is terminated by a richly decorated parapet fence, featuring a central tablet with the building's name in moulded lettering. The facade features recessed blind windows, of grand proportions defined by the pilasters. The blind windows reveal the nature of the building, a theatre, designed to exclude daylight. The central bay on the upper floor features a window. The return walls are unusual in that they step upwards from the facade meeting the roof over the auditorium. The decorative elements are relatively intact although the metal awning appears to be a later addition and some of the blind windows have been opened for later screens and vets. The interior dress circle, circle foyer, proscenium, stage, fly tower, dressing rooms, ceilings and walls of the Victoria are all intact. Only the vestibule (lower foyer) and back stalls area has been subject to alteration for retail purposes. The exterior above the awning is also intact, as it was after the 1921 alterations (with the former hotel windows \\"blinded\\" when the auditorium was extended).Movie Theatre Register 1996 It was reported to be in good condition as at 2 June 1999.  Virtual reality recreation  In 2018, the interior of the Victoria Theatre was recreated in virtual reality, as it was in 1891 by Dr Gillian Arrighi and staff from the University of Newcastle. Participants were able to experience the foyers, stalls, circle, gallery and stage.  Heritage listing  The Victoria Theatre is a building of State importance. It is the oldest theatre building still standing in New South Wales. It represents an age of silent pictures, vaudeville and early legitimate theatre that no other building can offer in this State - being over 100 years old. It is virtually intact, except for vestibule/back stalls alterations. Demolition of false shop walls may reveal that even these areas remain unaltered. The theatre represents an 1891 facade, an auditorium that is both 1891 and 1921, with extensive backstage facilities. It is an important part of Newcastle's heritage, but also a significant building for NSW. Victoria Theatre was listed on the New South Wales State Heritage Register on 27 August 1999 having satisfied the following criteria. The place is important in demonstrating the course, or pattern, of cultural or natural history in New South Wales.

Geography The parish is bounded to the west by the River Thames and on other sides by field boundaries. The 2011 Census recorded the parish's population as 200. The parish is on a light escarpment running north-east to south-west. Its highest point is a tiny knoll 100 m above mean sea level, about 500 metres SSW of the clustered-cum-linear village (in Harcourt Arboretum, part of a larger easter woodland). Between these points is Windmill Hill where no evidence of a windmill survives. The minimum elevation is 52m to 53m along the Thames which follows the line of the central eminent land. Most of the nature reserve Bluebell Wood is on the eastern slopes, across Marsh Baldon's straight and touching boundary to the village nucleus. The parish covers about 2 km north to the same south-west of the point shown and just over 1% of South Oxfordshire's 67.85 km¬≤. Its population was 0.15% of the district's total of 134,257. The Oxford Green Belt Way passes through the parish. History The toponym was Newenham from the 11th century on, until it was changed to \\"Nuneham\\" in 1764. Roman Just southeast of Lower Farm, about northwest of the present Nuneham Courtenay village, is the site of a former Romano- British pottery kiln. The kiln was about west of the Roman road that linked the Roman towns at Dorchester on Thames and Alchester. It began production about 100 CE, producing a wide range of fine wares in the 2nd century and increased its product range in the 3rd century. It then declined, and in about the middle of the 4th century it ceased production. The remains of the kiln were discovered in 1991 during excavations to lay a new water main for Thames Water. Newenham‚ÄîNuneham Manor Some time between the Norman conquest of England in 1066 and the completion of the Domesday Book in 1086 William the Conqueror granted the manor of Newenham to one of his Norman barons, Richard de Courcy. It remained in his family until the death of his great-grandson, William (III) de Courcy in 1176. It then passed from William de Courcy's widow Gundreda via her female heirs to Baldwin de Redvers, 7th Earl of Devon. Baldwin died without an heir, so Newenham again passed to a female \\"overlord\\", Isabella de Fortibus, Countess of Devon. She too died without an heir, but in 1310 King Edward II granted Newenham to Hugh de Courtenay, 9th Earl of Devon. Newenham remained in the Courtenay family until the latter part of the 14th century, when Sir Peter de Courtenay, son of Hugh de Courtenay, 10th Earl of Devon sold his inheritance of the estate to Sir Hugh Segrave. Memorial brass of Sir John Drayton (d. 1417), in Dorchester Abbey. Under the terms of the sale Margaret de Bohun, 2nd Countess of Devon retained the use of Newenham Courtenay for life. However, Sir Hugh Segrave died in 1386 and the Countess outlived him, so upon her death in 1391 the manor passed to Segrave's aunt's grandson, Sir John Drayton, who was Member of Parliament for Oxfordshire (October 1404) and Gloucestershire (1410). Sir John died in 1417 leaving the manor to his widow Isabel, younger daughter of Sir Maurice Russell (died 1416) of Dyrham, Gloucestershire and Kingston Russell, Dorset. Isabel then married, as her 4th husband, Stephen Hatfield. After some legal problems concerning good title to the manor, in 1425 Isabel and Hatfield sold the reversion of the manor, reserving a life interest to themselves, to Thomas Chaucer (c. 1367‚Äì1434 or 1435), son of the poet Geoffrey Chaucer and Speaker of the House of Commons on five occasions between 1407 and 1421. Upon Isabel's death in 1437, Newenham Courtenay passed to Alice Chaucer, daughter of Thomas Chaucer. Alice was married to William de la Pole, 1st Duke of Suffolk. The manor remained in the de la Pole family until 1502, when Edmund de la Pole, 3rd Duke of Suffolk was outlawed and forfeited his lands for allegedly plotting a Yorkist rebellion against Henry VII. In 1514 Henry VIII made his brother-in- law Charles Brandon Duke of Suffolk, and granted him the forfeited de la Pole estates. In 1528 Brandon conveyed Newenham Courtenay to Cardinal Wolsey, but the following year King Henry VIII deposed Wolsey. The manor was administered by royal stewards until 1544, when it was bought by John Pollard. Pollard lived at Newenham Courtenay until his death in 1557. He left the use of the manor to his widow Mary, with the estate to pass to two of his male relatives upon her death. Dame Mary, however, remarried in 1561 and lived to be over 100, outliving the heirs whom Pollard had appointed. She eventually died in 1606 and the estate passed to a younger John Pollard. John transferred Newenham Courtenay to his son Lewis, but both men were in debt and in 1634 Lewis sold the estate to the wealthy lawyer Hugh Audley. In 1640, Audley sold Newenham Courtenay to Robert Wright, Bishop of Lichfield and Coventry. Wright supported Archbishop Laud, for which Parliament imprisoned him. He died in 1643 and his son Calvert inherited Newenham Courtenay. Calvert wasted his father's fortune, sold Newenham Courtenay in 1653, was imprisoned as a debtor, and died in the King's Bench Prison in Southwark in 1666. Calvert Wright's buyer was John Robinson, a City of London businessman who reported that it cost him more to clear the debts of Newenham Courtenay than to buy the estate. Robinson left the estate to his two daughters, who in 1710 sold it to Sir Simon Harcourt of Stanton Harcourt. Sir Simon was created Viscount Harcourt in 1721 and died in 1727. He was succeeded by his grandson Simon Harcourt, 2nd Viscount Harcourt, who was created 1st Earl Harcourt in 1749. Upon the death of William Harcourt, 3rd Earl Harcourt in 1830 the earldom became extinct, and the estate, now called Nuneham Courtenay, passed to the first Earl's nephew Edward Venables-Vernon, Archbishop of York, who then changed his name to Venables-Vernon-Harcourt. Manorial rights were in England abated in the 19th century. The estate remained in the family until 1948, when William Edward Harcourt, 2nd Viscount Harcourt (1908‚Äì1979) sold what remained of the manor to the University of Oxford. =Nuneham House and Park= \\"A Nuneham pasture\\", 1860 painting by Edward Lear. The rectory and manor house used to accompany a small village with medieval parish church standing on the most sudden part of the village's river bluff, all with a westward view over the River Thames. The manor house may have dated from the 16th century. The 1st Earl demolished the house, medieval church, and 'tumble-down clay-built' cottages of the village, and built a new parish church with an entirely new Nuneham Courtenay village almost north east to make way for his planned English style landscape park and new Nuneham House. =New village= The new village comprised two identical rows of brick-built semi-detached cottages, each of a single main storey plus an attic floor with dormer windows. The two identical rows face each other across the Oxford‚ÄìReading and Henley-on-Thames (i.e. south-east) main road, which had been made a turnpike in 1736. (It has been classified the A4074 since the 20th century.) As the village population has subsequently grown, additional cottages have been added in similar styles early in the 19th century and again early in the 20th century. The old village had a village green. The new village has none, but was built to a spacious plan with gardens for every cottage and verges between them and the main road. In the 1760s the Irish writer, poet and playwright Oliver Goldsmith witnessed the demolition of a medieval village and destruction of its farms to clear land to become a wealthy man's garden. His poem The Deserted Village, published in 1770, expresses a fear that the destruction of villages and the conversion of land from productive agriculture to ornamental landscape gardens would ruin the peasantry. The Deserted Village gave the demolished medieval village the pseudonym \\"Sweet Auburn\\" and Goldsmith did not disclose the real village on which he based it. He did, however, indicate it was about from London and it is widely believed to have been Nuneham Courtenay. Nuneham House overlooking the Thames. =New Nuneham House= The 'new' Nuneham House was designed by the architect Stiff Leadbetter in 1756. The design was changed and enlarged twice during construction, so that the house when completed in 1764 was far from the compact Palladian villa designed eight years earlier. The Poet Laureate William Whitehead was a visitor, and it was he who coined the change of spelling from \\"Newenham\\" to \\"Nuneham\\" in 1764. The Archbishop of York commissioned the architect Robert Smirke to make unaesthetic but functional extensions to the house in the 1830s. Further alterations to the house were made in 1904. =Gardens= The design of the original landscape garden park owed much to the poet and gardener the Rev. William Mason, who designed its formal flower garden in 1771. George Simon Harcourt, 2nd Earl Harcourt commissioned the renowned Lancelot \\"Capability\\" Brown to make alterations to the landscape garden park in 1779, and the house in 1781. The works were completed in the autumn of 1782, shortly before Brown's death. Whitehead's poem The Late Improvements at Nuneham celebrated Brown's work. Brown had planned a Gothic Revival tower folly for a prominent site overlooking the Thames. In 1787, however, the University of Oxford dismantled Carfax Conduit, which had been built in 1617 in the centre of Oxford. The 2nd Earl re-erected the Conduit building in his park instead of the proposed tower. In the 1830s Edward Venables-Vernon-Harcourt, Archbishop of York, destroyed William Mason's formal flower garden and most of the landscape park's sculptures. He bought and added adjacent land in Marsh Baldon parish to extend the park eastwards as far as the Oxford‚ÄìDorchester main road. On this new land he had the artist W.S. Gilpin design a Doric entrance lodge in the 1830s. The Archbishop had a pinetum botanical garden planted in 1835. In 1963 the pinetum became Harcourt Arboretum, part of the tree and plant collection of the University of Oxford Botanic Garden. It includes of woodland and a wildflower meadow. Parish churches Monument to Anthony and Philippa Pollard, relocated from Abingdon Abbey. =Abingdon Abbey= Abingdon Abbey may have had a Saxon parish church in Newenham. If so, it was destroyed in the Danish invasions of the 10th century. There was then a parish church of All Saints that served the village from the Middle Ages until the 1760s, but little information about it survives. It was demolished in 1764 to make way for Earl Harcourt's landscaping plan (see above). Remains of two windows of the old church and one of the tombs were moved to Baldon House at nearby Marsh Baldon, where the windows were used to create a folly. The Earl removed monuments from both the churchyard and the church, demolished the church building and sold its ring of five bells. The English Baroque style monument to Anthony Pollard (died 1577) and Philippa Pollard (died 1606) was salvaged from the medieval church, and is now displayed in an open-fronted shelter outside the 'new' 1764 church, which is now redundant. 'Old' All Saints Church, designed in the Palladian Greek Revival style. North facade with portico facing the River Thames. It is now redundant. =Old All Saints Church ‚àí 1764= Earl Harcourt had the next All Saints parish church, the Old All Saints Church, built in 1764 about away from the mediaeval one's site. The Earl was an amateur architect and designed the church himself in the Neoclassical Greek Revival style, aided by the Neoclassicist James \\"Athenian\\" Stuart. It is a domed Palladian style temple. It is conventionally oriented, with its entrance on the west facade and altar in the east end, but also has a doorless Ionic portico on its north side overlooking the River Thames. The church is positioned on a slight rise on the river bluff to maximise its effect in the landscape park design. The removal of the village to a new site put the 1764 church almost away by winding, partly wooded footpaths. Its austere Neoclassical Palladian design also became unpopular during the 19th-century Gothic Revival. A new church was completed in 1874, which left the 1764 church to become the Harcourt family chapel. In 1880 ornately-carved Italian fittings were added to its austere interior. The Churches Conservation Trust now cares for the building. Early English Gothic Revival style. =New All Saints' Church ‚àí 1874= In 1871 Edward Vernon Harcourt MP inherited Nuneham Courtenay. He had a new All Saints' Church built for the parish during 1872‚Äì74 that was closer to the relocated village. It was designed in the Early English Gothic Revival style by the architect C.C. Rolfe. All Saints' parish is now part of the Benefice of \\"Marsh Baldon St Peter and Toot Baldon St Lawrence with Nuneham Courtenay, The Baldons\\". In the 1970s the Old All Saints Church, Nuneham Courtenay, of classical design, was declared redundant. Transport and education There are sporadic records of one or more locks on the River Thames at Newenham. One called \\"Bunselock\\" was referred to in 1279. In the 16th century the river seems to have had three locks at Newenham. A map of 1707 shows a flash lock on the channel past a small island opposite the appropriately-named Lock Wood. In 1716 it was repaired at the expense of the first Viscount. By 1707 Newenham Courtenay had a ferry linking it with Lower Radley across the river. This continued to operate after the 1st Viscount removed Newenham Courtenay village (see below). In 1809 the Countess Harcourt opened a school for the village, run by a schoolmistress and supervised by the vicar. In 1835 a new school building was completed and in 1849 the National Society for Promoting Religious Education gave a grant to develop the building. At the end of the 19th century it was noted amongst village schools for the high quality of its education.

Big Bird, Elmo, Ernie and Bert have made cameo appearances. * A Lot Like Birds performed a song named: Sesame Street Is No Place For Me. Major parodies=Avenue Q The hit Broadway musical Avenue Q is a parody of Sesame Street. Four members of the original cast (John Tartaglia, Stephanie D'Abruzzo, Rick Lyon, and Jennifer Barnhart) are all former puppeteers for the Jim Henson Company. The following disclaimer appears in all promotional material, advertising and merchandise for the show: \\"Avenue Q has not been authorized or approved in any manner by the Jim Henson Company or Sesame Workshop, which have no responsibility for its content.\\" Wonder Showzen Wonder Showzen is a sketch comedy television series that began airing in 2005 on MTV2. The show's format is clearly a parody of children's shows such as Sesame Street (e.g. use of stock footage, puppetry, and clips of children being interviewed). MADtv MADtv had a recurring segment that is a parody of the show itself, complete with a Sesame Street-styled opening. There have been seven segments. * In the first segment, \\"Big Bird Gets the Flu\\", Big Bird gets the bird flu and spreads it all over Sesame Street. * In the second segment, \\"Donald Trump Tears Down Sesame Street\\", some construction workers try to take apart Big Bird's nest and destroy Sesame Street in the process. * In the third segment, \\"MyPlace.com\\", Big Bird tries to find out why Billy is so obsessed with a website called \\"MyPlace\\" on his phone. * In the fourth segment, \\"The Dirty Bomb\\", Big Bird doesn't know why he's turning sick and green. * In the fifth sketch, \\"Economic Depression\\", Big Bird finds out that the bank took his nest after he defaulted on his rate mortgage. * The sixth sketch was a commercial for \\"Tickle Me Emo\\". * The seventh sketch, \\"Childhood Obesity\\", is in which Billy gets too fat. Other parodies One of the more famous Internet websites using the effects of Adobe Photoshop and other image-editing software revolves around the Sesame Street character \\"Bert\\". The site (and many variations), entitled \\"Bert is Evil\\", featured the character as part of many horrific acts throughout history, often co-conspiring with terrorists and other world leaders with negative connotations. In the Homestar Runner cartoons, debuting in the Strong Bad E-Mail \\"for kids\\", Homsar (A very unintelligent version of Homestar) hosts a kids show, \\"Whaddaya Know, Haddi- Man?\\" In this show, there seems to be a \\"letter of the day\\". In the episode snippet viewers saw, the letter of the day was \\"G\\", which may have come from Sesame Street episodes that were brought to you by a letter of the alphabet. However, Homsar's comment on the letter G was, \\"I'm not gonna lie to you, that's a healthy piece of real estate!\\" The Houghton Mifflin company's Power Proofreading online game parodied Sesame Street as \\"Cinnamon Street\\" as one of the programs on HME-TV. The description for the show is \\"Big Baby doesn't like sharing his toys. Miss Wiggy teaches him a lesson.\\" Family Guy The FOX show Family Guy has made reference to Sesame Street on some occasions. In the episode \\"The Father, the Son, and the Holy Fonz\\", it showed a short clip of Stewie, who is in a plastic bubble, taking on the role of the pinball from the Pinball Number Count sketch. Other counting sketch parodies have been included, notably Peter's attempt to set up Cleveland with a total of seven prostitutes in the episode \\"Petarded\\". In \\"Model Misbehavior\\", when Brian gets a job at Stewie's Cash Scam, Stewie calls Grover on his Sesame Street phone, then when he hangs up, he tells Brian \\"If the Cookie Monster calls, tell him I'm not talking to him until he gets out of rehab.\\" A cutaway is then shown where Cookie Monster sneaks cookies in his bed while in rehab and denies it to a group of doctors. Later in the episode, Lois sees him as a desperate, jittery addict, seated in a bathroom stall of the rehab center trying to make a cookie by holding raw dough in the bowl of a spoon over a lighter flame as if it were heroin. In the cold opening of \\"I Never Met the Dead Man\\", Stewie talks to Ernie on his Sesame Street phone. In \\"Mind Over Murder\\", Peter spends so much time inside his house that \\"all the TV programs are starting to mesh together\\". The example shown is Homicide: Life on Sesame Street, which mixes Homicide: Life on the Street with Sesame Street. In the episode shown, Bert is a gruff cop living with Ernie, who are shown as a bickering pair. In this scene, Ernie says \\"Bert, I wish you wouldn't drink so much.\\" Which Bert responds with \\"Well Ernie, I wish you wouldn't eat cookies in the damn bed!\\" In response, Ernie says, \\"Bert, you're shouting again, Bert.\\" Bert then sighs in frustration while a comedic musical cue, not unlike those heard on the actual show, plays. The episode \\"A Picture is Worth 1,000 Bucks\\" shows Meg does some bird calls, which leads to Big Bird walking over and asking her what she wants. When she tells him that she wasn't calling him specifically, he gets mad and tells her how hard it is for him to live a normal life, ending with him spitting on her shoes, and walking away, muttering \\"Bitch.\\" In \\"Family Guy Viewer Mail #1\\", Peter and Brian were watching Sesame Street. After the Count had counted out seven bats, Peter asks Brian if \\"they ever show him doin someone in and feedin on em\\", meaning if the Count has ever sucked on someone else's blood. Brian then points out that that has never happened. The Count also appeared in another episode where Meg claims that she dated him, and then flashes back to a time where they were beginning to have sex (showing her taking off her shirt with the camera on to her back) and the Count started counting her nipples, but is repulsed on discovering that she has three (One nipple! HAHAHA! Two nipples! HAHAHA! Three nip-oh, hell no, I'm outta here). American Dad! Seth MacFarlane has also had Sesame Street in his other series American Dad!. In \\"Francine's Flashback\\", Stan Smith is seen watching television, pointing at the screen and yelling for one of the characters to \\"Shoot him!\\". It is then shown that he is actually watching Sesame Street, with Elmo telling Big Bird to share a cookie with Cookie Monster. The 'camera' cuts back to Stan, who is even more furious, shouting \\"Don't trust him! It may look like the Cookie Monster's eating, but he never actually swallows anything!\\". This is, of course, a sly joke at how whenever Cookie Monster eats, he inevitably sprays crumbs everywhere. In \\"Lincoln Lover\\", Stan is invited to a party at a Langley branch of the Log Cabin Republicans (a group of republicans who identify with Lincoln's idea of republicanism, but are also gay). After learning of all the members' orientation, he asks \\"How can you be Republican and gay?\\" to which Greg responds \\"all these pre-conceived notions\\". He begins singing a song titled \\"Red and Gay\\" and sings about how they are gay like Bert, Ernie and Manet. Damn! Show The raunchy TV show Damn! Show featured a segment called \\"Clay Porn\\", which consisted of parodies of the Sesame Street Muppets (and one of Miss Piggy) as people constantly having sex, and it also included Bert and Ernie as a gay couple. Gang t-shirts On May 23, 2006, several T-shirts were banned from a Brockton, Massachusetts high school because they showed Sesame Street characters as gang figures, which violated that schools dress code policy. Because of this, the incident briefly made local and national headlines and the school, which enforced the ban, was awarded $650,000 as part of its anti-gang effort. As of May 2006, it is unknown about the fate of the person or persons who created the offending shirts and if the images on the t-shirt violated any copyright laws.High school bans Sesame Street gang t-shirts WTVD, Raleigh-Durham, North Carolina; URL Accessed: June 2, 2006 Robot Chicken The popular Adult Swim show Robot Chicken made a parody of the MADtv skit in which Big Bird is shown having the bird flu. Snuffy is also seen, although in this skit he really is an imaginary friend. Elmo, Grover and the Count make brief speaking cameos, and Ernie, Bert and Cookie Monster can be seen in the background at one point, receiving vaccines from the Count. A brief parody of \\"One of These Things\\" is seen, with three dancing kids and one dead kid. The Simpsons In The Simpsons episode \\"Missionary: Impossible\\", a pledge drive interrupts Homer's TV watching which causes him to pledge $10,000 after actress Betty White proclaims that $10,000 is what will end the drive. However Homer doesn't have the money and a chase ensues which includes Oscar the Grouch, Big Bird, and Elmo, each who want a piece of Homer which is in contrast to their character's true identity. In \\"Bart Mangled Banner\\", after the Simpson family is sent to Alcatraz (apparently reopened), Elmo is former president Bill Clinton's cellmate. Later, when the family tries to escape, Homer says in a terrified state that \\"he doesn't want to end up like Elmo\\", where the screen is panned to see Elmo's shadow in the jail cell, having hanged himself. In \\"To Surveil with Love\\", security cameras installed in a gay bar capture the antics of several customers all of whom resemble Sesame Street characters. Rhymes With Orange Rhymes with Oranges strip for August 28, 2008 had a reference to Sesame Street. The comic has a girl going to Sesame Street, and she needs directions to go there, so a guy gives her directions to go there. The October 18, 2008 strip had a parody of Sesame Street called \\"Witch Way\\". The logo parodies the Sesame Street logo. The intro has a character named Abbot who asks \\"Which way to Witch Way?\\" Another character named Costello shows her the way. Then, he says \\"Where are you going?\\" Then Abbot responds \\"Witch Way!\\" Mutts Mutts has a character that resembles Oscar the Grouch, but it is a cat who lives in a trash can, who appears in some strips of the comic. Angel In the Angel season 5 episode \\"Smile Time\\", the title character Angel is turned into a puppet. The episode is a direct parody of Sesame Street, in which the Muppets were featured to teach kids on their long running and popular show \\"Smile Time\\", only to be revealed as demons as the episode progresses.

How to get to \\"Sesame Street\\" Some PBS member stations have also given their studios a \\"Sesame Street\\" address, either by renaming the street, or building a new street alongside their new studios. These stations include WCFE-TV Plattsburgh, New York and WCVE-TV Richmond, Virginia. Some communities in the United States also have neighborhoods and subdivisions with a \\"Sesame Street\\", though these streets are not necessarily connected with the show or a PBS station.\\"Sesame Street\\" on Google Maps See also * Sesame Street (comic strip) References Popular culture Sesame Street ","title":"Pop culture influenced by Sesame Street"},{"id":"4455408","text":"On April 21, 1920, during a miners strike in Butte, Montana's copper mines, company guards fired on striking miners picketing near a mine of the Anaconda Copper Mining Company, killing Tom Manning and injuring sixteen others, an event known as the Anaconda Road massacre. His death went unpunished. Strike and massacre On April 19, 1920, the Industrial Workers of the World (IWW) and the Metal Mine Workers Industrial Union called for a strike in the mines around Butte. They hoped the strike would help secure higher wages, an eight- hour day, and end the use of the rustling card, a system that allowed employers to blacklist employees involved in union organizing, among other goals. The strike came at a weak point for the union movement in Butte. World War I had undermined the power of the Butte Miners Union and the mines around the town were open shops. Only six years earlier, in 1914, the Butte Miners Union Hall had been destroyed. Rising copper prices, fatal mining accidents, and recruitment by the IWW had further exacerbated tensions in the town. Three years before the strike, an IWW organizer named Frank Little was beaten and hanged from a railroad trestle by unknown assailants. Thus, the strike began in an atmosphere of tension. The day the strike was called, picketers began blocking roads to mines in the area, including the Anaconda Road. These picketers turned non-striking miners away from the mines. By the second day of the strike, the picketers had succeeded in shutting down nearly all mining in Butte. The same day, a local newspaper called the Butte Daily Bulletin reported that the head of the Anaconda Copper Mining Company had suggested killings and hangings to help end the strike. On the 21st, the local sheriff deputized the Anaconda mine guards in an attempt to contain the strike. That afternoon, a few hundred picketers gathered outside the Anaconda company's Neversweat Mine. The sheriff arrived and apparently attempted to mediate the dispute. However, the Anaconda mine guards opened fire on the picketers, although the reason why the shooting began is unclear. Sixteen miners were hit, and one, Tom Manning, was killed. All were shot in the back as they tried to flee. Federal troops arrived on the 22nd, ostensibly to prevent further violence. A labor newspaper that wrote about the strike was suppressed. Three weeks later, the strike collapsed completely and the miners returned to work. No one was found guilty as a result of the massacre, despite an inquest into the death of Tom Manning. During the inquest, Anaconda employees testified that a shot had been fired at them from a boarding house across the street, something which residents of the boarding house disputed. Cross-examination of witnesses by union attorneys suggested that the Anaconda employees had received coaching to make their stories align. Anaconda attorneys attempted to undermine their accusers by pointing out that some of the miners had recently immigrated to the United States. In the end, the jury declared that Manning had been killed by a bullet but that the bullet had been fired by unknown persons, and his death is still officially unsolved. The strike and massacre were the last major labor conflict in the area until the 1934 passage of the National Recovery Act allowed outside support to help rebuild the weakened Butte Miners Union. Fictional accounts Dashiell Hammett, once a Pinkerton agent stationed in Butte, Montana‚Äîwhere he (allegedly) turned down an offer to assassinate Little‚Äîused some historical background on union troubles and corporate corruption in his novel Red Harvest. The Op summarizes the local history as, \\"The strike lasted eight months. Both sides bled plenty. The wobblies [ Industrial Workers of the World ] had to do their own bleeding. Old Elihu hired gunmen, strike-breakers, national guardsmen and even parts of the regular army, to do his. When the last skull had been cracked, the last rib kicked in, organized labor in Personville was a used firecracker.\\" His client justifies the violence with, \\"Son, if I hadn't been a pirate I'd still be working for the Anaconda for wages, and there'd be no Personville Mining Corporation.\\"Hammet (1965), p 101.

In 1890 it was incorporated as Holy Angels, Collegiate Institute for Young Ladies and Preparatory School for Little Girls. Its motto was then and remains now \\"Vitae Via Virtus.\\" The Holy Angels Board voted to change the name of the school to the Academy of the Holy Angels in 1934 when Sister M. Angeline Hughes was Principal. The school accepted a developer's offer for the school's location in Fort Lee and purchased a large property in Demarest. The school had operated a grammar school in addition to the high school for decades and many graduates were known as \\"12 year Angels.\\" The grammar school was discontinued completely in 1964 prior to the move from Fort Lee.

Students use these tablets during school and at home to complete assignments, access the internet for research, take notes, and communicate with the faculty. Equipped with a pen and with a screen that can function as a notebook, students are able to use these tablets for all subjects such as History and Math. Features such as the Dropbox and Student Commons allow students to access notes and papers from the teachers on the school network, as well as place their own completed assignments within the folders on the network and, in effect, decrease the amount of paper used. In addition, AHA is currently using Turnitin, a website that scans finished papers and assignments for plagiarism and helps prevent it as well.

His death became the catalyst for the passage of Republic Act 9163 or the \\"National Service Training Program Law\\", which removed completion of mandatory ROTC as a precondition for graduation for male college students in the Philippines. Background Chua took his elementary and high school education at Saint Jude Catholic School and his college education at the University of Santo Tomas. As a member of the ROTC unit's intelligence monitoring team, he had first-hand knowledge of corruption within the organization, which he and another student, Romulo Yumol, divulged to UST's official student publication The Varsitarian in January 2001. This resulted in the relief of then-commandant Major Demy T Tejares and his staff. Death Chua received death threats after his revelations. The new ROTC commandant advised him to undergo security training at Fort Bonifacio. On 15 March 2001, he was supposed to meet with an agent but he was never seen alive again. Three days later his decomposing body, wrapped in a carpet, was found floating in the Pasig River near the Jones Bridge. His hands and feet were tied and his face wrapped in cloth and packing tape. The autopsy report showed that sludge was in his lungs, indicating that he was alive when he was thrown into the river. In order to mislead investigators, his abductors had pretended to demand ransom from the Chua family. On 31 March 2004, Arnulfo Aparri, Jr., one of the four suspects in the killing of Chua, was sentenced to die by lethal injection, and was ordered to pay Php 50,000.00 to the victim's family as indemnity. His sentence was later commuted to life imprisonment without parole after the death penalty was abolished in 2006. Another of the accused, Eduardo Tabrilla, pleaded guilty to homicide and was sentenced to 6-14 years of imprisonment in 2006.

The three books are respectively titled Deepwater Black (1992), Deepwater Landing (1993) and Deepwater Angels (1994). The books address a number of current issues like pollution, racism and politics. The most evident theme throughout the series is that of survival, not for oneself only but for a bigger cause. Other notable themes and elements include beauty, color and light among darkness (love and comfort in a time of danger), responsibility at a young age, the importance of the youth in the continued existence of the human race, rebellion, and fear of the unknown. Background How would you react if you were only thirteen or fourteen years old and one day you discovered your entire life that you had been living thus far is only a dream, or a pre- existing hallucination which is a memory from a person who had once been you? A person whom you had been cloned from, whose life you had been living until now. What would you do if you woke up from that life and find yourself on a spaceship, hundreds of years into the future, millions of kilometres from Earth. No one is there to look out for you except an intelligent navigations computer named COL, a handful of unusual-looking teenagers like yourself and a god-like entity named NUN who had raised and educated you but at some point removed its presence for an unknown reason. Welcome to the life of the crew of the spaceship Deepwater, a group of blue, green, red and multicolored youngsters, who find themselves past all known star positions travelling to an unknown destination, facing many unknown dangers, including themselves... Deepwater Black Robbie Mikkelson is an ordinary 13-year-old who goes to school, plays hockey and occasionally dodges the school bullies. He lives with his mom and dad, older sister Sarah and younger brother David. He goes to school with kids like Denie Miles, Meatgrinder and Reeboks. Everything is relatively simple until Yoona, the girl in the gray track suit, appears in his life. This multicolored girl, whom no-one else can see, tells Robbie about things he doesn't understand, that he's needed on Deepwater. Before he can respond he's warped away from everything he's ever known, to discover that he is Reb, second in charge of a sky-scraper sized spaceship, the same person, yet different and told that his life on Earth is only a dream. He is now in charge of Deepwater along with Yoona, Bren, Gret, Lis and Zak, all of them descendants of colonists of the Solar System. Worn out from long shifts of duty in order to stay alive, these teenagers are fighting dangers like trites, amebs, solunks and mag-mets. Then there's also the 'Jel' a dangerous, seemingly live substance that lives deep in the ship's ventilation shafts. Robbie is now forced to live two lives, zooming back to Earth whenever the 'prexes' hit him, his Deepwater life becoming more and more real. To complicate things, distrust among the ship's crew slowly grows out of control and questions about their own identity are answered by only bigger riddles. Who are they really? Why are they alone in space? Where are they heading? What is hidden in the uncharted chambers of Deepwater? What is the mysterious, half-destroyed, dark ship that they encounter on their journey? Robbie has to answer Yoona's plea for help, but how can he when he doesn't even know who he is? Deepwater Landing The second book is the story of Denie Miles, who finds herself on Deepwater as Cei, having woken from one of two caskets that had remained closed in Deepwater Black when the other six opened. Deepwater had to return to space, searching for the one necessary ingredient to complete its mission. Enemies from the past return to follow her back to Earth, where a woman named Chibbi Orduna, helps her to get some answers. Across the gulf of space, there are even worse enemies waiting at their destination, who are horrifyingly not unlike themselves... Deepwater Angels Only one final casket has stayed closed till now. When Conn, an Earthkid, wakes to find himself on Deepwater, the spaceship is stranded on Earth. Life is beginning anew, however, Deepwater has to complete one final mission, right here on home territory. The danger is more overwhelming than ever. Mysteries need to be solved. Join Conn on his quest to re-establish life on a planet that is home, yet filled with perils, both alien and menacing.

Gameplay The players must take up control of four medieval lords who are fighting for control of the land; they have to battle through eight different castles, and try to gain control of each one. When one of the lords wins a battle, he shall receive a medal - and once he has won three medals, he will gain control of the current castle (which means that they can be up to six rooms long) and the game will proceed to the next castle. The gameplay is also similar to that of Hudson Soft's Bomberman series, the initial title of which was adapted by Irem for the arcade in 1991; the lords start out in the four corners of the screen and can only be killed by bombs, but a strike from the whips will temporarily stun them. The objective is to trap the other lords with bombs and kill them or otherwise force them to walk into the path of an exploding bomb - and treasure chests are numerous in each room, and can be broken with the whip. Each treasure chest contains a powerup (such as speed shoes, boomerangs, extra bombs, larger bombs, and more); the game's name is also a reference to the fact that it is a parody of Konami's Castlevania series or Akumaj≈ç Dracula as it was originally known in Japan. Every third room is a \\"dragon room\\", in which an enormous dragon is seen walking around freely; they come in three different colors (red, green and black), become stronger as the lords progress through each castle, and in later castles begin to breathe fire (which is just as lethal as a bomb) and attack the players in other ways. If a dragon is successfully killed, powerups will appear all around him - and other enemies, like blobs of slime and possessed skeletons, appear as the castles progress. They cannot kill the players, but can significantly stun them in various ways and become more numerous with each level; when the time is down to 40 seconds the text \\"DANGER\\" will appear on the screen and Death (who had previously appeared in Sega's Quartet in 1986) appears, flying towards the lords and killing them on impact, and when the time runs out, an evil witch will electrify the room to kill all the surviving lords at a stroke. The final room pits the winning player (the player who has won the most matches and who controls the most castles) against the final boss, the witch, who attacks with lightning spells. Plot The queen of darkness, Erinyes („Ç®„É™„Éã„É•„Çπ), has kidnapped Princess Electra („Ç®„É¨„ÇØ„Éà„É©Âß´). The four heroes: Ward („Ç¶„Ç©„Éº„Éâ), Emilio („Ç®„Éü„É™„Ç™), Charles („ÉÅ„É£„Éº„É´„Ç∫) and Karl („Ç´„Éº„É´) embark on a quest to save the princess. They compete with each other to reach the Castle of Darkness and defeat Erinyes, so one of them might be able to marry the rescued Electra and rule the land (the eponymous \\"Exvania\\"). Each of the lords has their own ending sequence, but Karl's is slightly different from that of the other three (as Princess Electra is horrendously ugly, and when he throws a bomb at her to fend her off, it explodes in her hand and blows both of them up, causing him to mix Greek text with Japanese Kanji in the quotation ŒüŒßŒîÂè£ŒüÂè£Œß! which reads as \\"OCHD Kuchi O Kuchi CH!\\"). Greek text was previously used by Namco for Face Off, in 1988, when one of the members of the losing team said the phrase ŒüŒîŒß (which reads as \\"ODCH\\") on the continue screen in the \\"versus\\" mode.

Similar games - including Up Jenkins - are played elsewhere in Europe and the United States. The game The game is played using a small coin. Two teams of three face each other across a table and toss the coin to decide who goes first. The winning team put their hands under the table and move the coin unseen between the three pairs of hands. When ready, the centre player knocks three times on the underside of the table and all three pairs of clenched fists (one containing the coin) are placed on the table. The opposing team, who can confer, must then attempt to find the coin in the following manner. The person who is trying to find the Tippit taps the hand of an opponent and says either:- *\\"Take your left/right hand away\\". The tapped opponent opens the hand specified and if the coin is not there, the person puts the hand by their side. If the Tippit is revealed, then the team hiding the Tippit have won the round. They score one point and get to hide the Tippit amongst themselves again. *\\"Tippit in your left/right\\". The tapped opponent opens their hand to show whether or not the coin is there. If the Tippit is revealed, then the team searching for the Tippit wins the coin. They score no points but get the opportunity to hide the coin. If the Tippit is not in the fist mentioned, then the searcher has lost and the team with the Tippit score a point and get to hide it over again - once they have revealed who really had it all along. Games are usually played until one team reaches a score of 11. There are minor regional variations in command words and game length but these rules remain essentially the same wherever the game is played. Tactics The point of the game is that the team hiding the Tippit wants to make the opposing team guess the wrong fist. The game gets very tactical particularly in choosing in which hand to place the tippit and particularly skillful players play like good poker players, hiding their emotions or even trying to mislead their opponents using facial gestures, body language and verbal banter. The team guessing can often make an inexperienced player reveal the whereabouts by staring into their eyes or even visually examining hand positions. Where is it played A world championship is held in mid Wales each year. The game is still played in the pubs of mid Wales particularly around Rhayader, parts of Herefordshire / Gloucestershire and by adult leaders in some Wigan scout groups on jamboree weekends. In 2006, Welsh television station S4C produced a gameshow of Tippit, called Tipit.

Early Life Born in Thornhill, Ontario of Ukrainian descent, Larry Uteck attended Jesuit-run Brebeuf College School in Toronto where he was a football star and Athlete of the Year. He then went to the University of Colorado (1970‚Äì73) on scholarship, playing with the Colorado Buffaloes, and then Wilfrid Laurier University (1973‚Äì74). Professional career Following university, Uteck played with the Toronto Argonauts, BC Lions, Ottawa Rough Riders, and Montreal Alouettes in the Canadian Football League and was named Conference All-Star in 1974, 1975, and 1976. He served his fellow players as their League Representative in 1976. One of Uteck's inspirations was John Black, his school teacher from Marmora, Ontario. Coaching career He joined the sports program at Saint Mary's University in 1982, and became Head Football Coach of the Saint Mary's Huskies in 1983 and continued through 1997, compiling a winning record. He was named AUAA Coach of the Year in 1987, 1988, 1989, 1990, and 1992. He was named CIAU Coach of the Year in 1988 and 1992. His teams appeared in five Atlantic Bowls and three Vanier Cups. In 1995, he was named interim Director of Athletics and Recreation and was formally appointed Director in 1997, a position in which he continued until his death. Political career Uteck also worked for the larger Halifax community, notably as Deputy Mayor of the Halifax Regional Municipality, and was a champion of the Halifax Harbour Solutions Project. His deep love for his community took him into municipal politics and he was elected Alderman for the City of Halifax, Ward 5. He served two years (1994‚Äì95) and was elected to the first Halifax Regional Municipal Council for District 13 (Northwest Arm-South End), where he served from 1995‚Äì1999. His quiet, but tenacious and thoughtful leadership saw him elected Deputy Mayor in 1998. He served with distinction on numerous HRM Committees including the Downtown Business Commission, Neptune Theatre, and the Halifax Port Corporation. His wife, Sue succeeded him as Councillor for District 13 in December 1999. Personal life Uteck married Sue Maloney in 1989, and they had two children, Luke (whom he named after Black's son) and Cain. Uteck died on December 25, 2002. Honours Uteck's remarkable leadership and vision were recognized when he was named a Member of the Order of Canada in October 2002. It was one of the few honours he would accept following the diagnosis of amyotrophic lateral sclerosis (ALS, a.k.a. Lou Gehrig's disease) in 1997 (one of his teammates on the Montreal Alouettes, Tony Proudfoot also succumbed to the disease). The only other honour he would accept was the naming of a Halifax road \\"Larry Uteck Boulevard\\" in February 2000, Later a tri town road in 2014. Following his death, and in consideration of his longtime Canadian football career as a professional athlete in the CFL, and coach at Saint Mary's University and as the university's athletic director, it was decided that the Churchill Bowl would be retired, with the Mitchell Bowl taking the place of the Churchill Bowl, and a new championship be named in Uteck's memory. Thus, the Uteck Bowl formally replaced the Atlantic Bowl. His alma mater, Brebeuf College School, honoured him by renaming its sports field the Larry Uteck Memorial Field in 2004.

He may have emigrated to escape Viking raids in his native land. It is possible he may have been part of a Gaelic religious community that was present in Kinneddar in the 10th century, and who placed his cell in a cave in a rocky promontory to the east. The early maps give reference to his having been there by naming the area Holyman's Head near Elgin. His cave became a place of pilgrimage right up to the Reformation and survived into the 19th century before being quarried out. Legends A legend states that he lit flaming torches at night to warn ships away from the dangerous rocks. Another states that once, when Gervadius needed wood to complete the construction of a church, he was miraculously assisted by a river, which washed timber down to where he was working.

Use in biotechnology  Digoxigenin is a hapten, a small molecule with high antigenicity, that is used in many molecular biology applications similarly to other popular haptens such as 2,4-Dinitrophenol, biotin, and fluorescein. Typically, digoxigenin is introduced chemically (conjugation) into biomolecules (proteins, nucleic acids) to be detected in further assays. DIG-binding proteins. Tinberg et al. designed artificial proteins that bind DIG. Their best binder, DIG10.3, was a 141 amino acid protein that bound DIG with a dissociation constant (Kd) of 541 (+/- 193) pM. Anti-digoxigenin antibodies with high affinities and specificity are used in a variety of biological immuno-assays (e.g. ELISA). The antibodies are labeled with dyes, enzymes or fluorescence, directly or secondarily, for visualization and detection. Digoxigenin is thus an all-purpose immuno-tag, and in particular a standard immunohistochemical marker for in situ hybridization. In this case it is conjugated to a single species of RNA nucleoside triphosphate (typically uridine), which is then incorporated into RNA (a \\"riboprobe\\") as it is synthesized by the cellular machinery. It allows to make : * sensitive non- radioactive in situ hybridization probes to detect nucleic acids in plants, able to detect 1 ¬µg of plasmid DNA. * peptide-DIG conjugates, i.e. bradykinin assay by very sensitive chemiluminescence immunoassays. * fluorescent and DIG- labeled tracers for competitive immunoassays, i.e. to limit detect digoxin, a drug used to cure cardiac arrhythmia, down to 0.2 ng mL‚àí1. * Digoxigenin may be conjugated to sugars to study glycosylation events, even in biological systems.

As Hamilton's Foot, it served in Flanders during the Nine Years War and at Namur on 31 August 1695, took part in the capture of the Terra Nova earthwork, later commemorated in the song 'The British Grenadiers.' In recognition, of this, William III renamed the unit as The Royal Regiment of Foot of Ireland. As part of the Irish establishment, it escaped disbandment after the 1697 Treaty of Ryswick and when the War of the Spanish Succession began in 1701, returned to Flanders as part of Marlborough's field army. It served there throughout the war, including major actions at Schellenberg, Blenheim, Ramillies, Oudenarde and Malplaquet. The war ended with the 1713 Peace of Utrecht and in 1718, the regiment joined the garrison of the British-held island of Menorca, where it remained here until 1742, with the exception of a detachment sent to Gibraltar in 1727.Cannon, p.xxx The regiment spent most of the next 25 years on garrison duty in Britain and Ireland; in 1751, reforms ended the tradition of naming units after their current colonel and the regiment was officially ranked as the 18th Regiment of Foot. Based in Ireland for most of the Seven Years' War, in July 1767 it arrived in North America and spent the next eight years on garrison duty in Philadelphia and different parts of Illinois.Cannon, p. 47 When the American War of Independence began in April 1775, most of the unit was in Boston; for the first time in over 50 years, it saw action at Lexington, Concord and Bunker Hill.Cannon, p. 48 Boston was abandoned in early 1776 and the regiment evacuated to Nova Scotia, where many of its men were drafted into other units, then to Dover Castle in England.Cannon, p. 49 In 1782, it moved to Guernsey where in 1783 it helped the local militia put down a mutiny by soldiers of the 104th Regiment based at Fort George. The Government of Guernsey publicly thanked both units and awarded them a cash bounty of 100 guineas.Duncan, p. 163 After this, the unit returned to Gibraltar later in the year, where it remained until the Siege of Toulon in 1793 during the French Revolutionary Wars.Cannon, p. 50 The 19th century The regiment in the Battle of Amoy in China, 26 August 1841 The regiment also saw action at the Battle of Alexandria in March 1801.Cannon, p. 58 The 1st Battalion served in Jamaica and the 2nd Battalion served in Cura√ßao during the Napoleonic Wars.Cannon, p. 61 On 19 November 1807, 120 members of the 18th Regiment of Foot were drowned when HM Packet Ship Prince of Wales sank in Dublin Bay. They were buried at Merrion Cemetery, Bellevue. During the First Opium War in China, the regiment next saw action at the Capture of Chusan in July 1840, Battle of Canton in May 1841,Cannon, p. 69 Battle of Amoy in August 1841,Cannon, p. 70 Second Capture of Chusan in October 1841, Battle of Ningpo in March 1842,Cannon, p. 72 Battle of Tzeki in March 1842, Battle of Chapu in May 1842, Battle of Woosung in June 1842, and Battle of Chinkiang in July 1842.Cannon, p. 74 It took part in the Siege of Sevastopol during the Crimean War; Captain Thomas Esmonde was awarded the Victoria Cross for saving a party of colleagues from a fire of shell and grape. The regiment also took part in the Second Anglo-Afghan War. The 2nd Battalion, which was re-formed on 18 September 1857, began to arrive in New Zealand from 4 July 1863 and served in the Waikato and Taranaki campaigns of the New Zealand Wars. Captain Hugh Shaw won the Victoria Cross when he rescued wounded soldiers during a skirmish at Nukumaru near Whanganui. The regiment was not fundamentally affected by the Cardwell Reforms of the 1870s, which gave it a depot at Victoria Barracks in Clonmel from 1873, or by the Childers reforms of 1881 ‚Äì as it already possessed two battalions, there was no need for it to amalgamate with another regiment. The depot was the 69th Brigade Depot from 1873 to 1881, and the 18th Regimental District depot thereafter Under the reforms the regiment became The Royal Irish Regiment on 1 July 1881. It served as the county regiment of Tipperary, Waterford, Wexford and Kilkenny. Militarily, the whole of Ireland was administered as a separate command within the United Kingdom with Command Headquarters at Parkgate (Phoenix Park) Dublin, directly under the War Office in London.Harris, pp. 2‚Äì3 The 1st Battalion was stationed in British India and Afghanistan from 1875 to 1884, when it were transferred to Egypt to take part in the Nile Expedition. It was back in home barracks from 1885 to 1891, then in Ireland until it was sent to South Africa as part of reinforcements for the Second Boer War in late 1899.Hart‚Ä≤s Army list, 1903 The battalion took part in several battles, and played an important role at the Battle of Slabbert's Nek in July 1900 during the war. The 2nd Battalion saw action in Egypt during the Anglo-Egyptian War in 1882. From 1884 it was stationed at Malta, then in India where it had various postings, including the last in Kamptee until it returned home in late 1902. In 1908, the Volunteers and Militia were reorganised nationally, with the former becoming the Territorial Force and the latter the Special Reserve; the regiment now had two Reserve but no Territorial battalions.These were the 3rd Battalion (Special Reserve) and the 4th Battalion (Special Reserve).

The 2nd Battalion landed at Boulogne- sur-Mer as part of the 8th Brigade in the 3rd Division in August 1914 for service on the Western Front but was almost completely destroyed at the Battle of La Bass√©e in October 1914 with many men being taken as prisoners of war. The battalion was re-formed in October 1914 and, as part of the 22nd Brigade in the 7th Division saw further action at the Battle of the Somme, when it was involved in capturing three miles of the German frontline trenches, in Autumn 1916. The 3rd (Reserve) Battalion, largely made up from local Dubliners, were the first army troops to engage the Irish rebels during the Easter Rising: the rebels were fighting to establish an Irish Republic in Dublin.Caulfield, pp. 76‚Äì80 Eight of the Royal Irish Regiment were killed and sixteen more wounded. Some of these are buried in Grangegorman Military Cemetery. A Royal Irish Regiment officer reported that \\"they regarded, not unreasonably, everyone they saw as an enemy, and fired at anything that moved\\".McGarry, p. 184 =New Armies= The 5th (Service) Battalion (Pioneers) landed in Suvla Bay as pioneer battalion for the 10th (Irish) Division in August 1915 but moved to Salonika in September 1915. The 6th (Service) Battalion landed at Le Havre as part of the 47th Brigade in the 16th (Irish) Division in December 1915 for service on the Western Front. The 7th (South Irish Horse) Battalion was formed in France as part of the 49th Brigade in the 16th (Irish) Division from the dismounted 1st and 2nd South Irish Horse in September 1917. Disbandment Due to substantial defence cuts and the establishment of the Irish Free State in 1922, it was agreed that the six former Southern Ireland regiments would be disbanded,Army Order 78/1922Murphy, p. 30 including the Royal Irish Regiment. On 12 June, five regimental colours were laid up in a ceremony at St George's Hall, Windsor Castle in the presence of HM King George V.Harris, p. 209 The six regiments were then all disbanded on 31 July 1922. With the simultaneous outbreak of the Irish Civil War conflict some thousands of their ex-servicemen and officers contributed to expanding the Free State government's newly formed National Army. They brought considerable combat experience with them and by May 1923 comprised 50 per cent of its 53,000 soldiers and 20 per cent of its officers.Cottrell, p. 23 Regimental Association Initially members of the Regiment came together to form an Old Comrades Association which lasted from the early 1920s to 1984. The banner of the Old Comrades Association was handed to an officer in the British Army who in turn presented it to the museum in Stephens Barracks in Kilkenny, Ireland. In 2010 the 18th Regiment of Foot Royal Irish Regiment (and South Irish Horse) Association was formed. Based in Clonmel, County Tipperary, Ireland it remembers and commemorates the history of the Regiment through social media, events, lectures and trips to visit areas where the Regiment served.

In 1999, the company came under the control of Prada in a US$170 million deal. History Between the two world wars, Church‚Äôs became actively involved in the development of the footwear industry in general. In 1919, the British Boot, Shoe and Allied Trades Research Association was created with Church‚Äôs as a founder-member. As a result of this partnership, the Northampton Technical College was established in 1925. This went on to become the University of Northampton in 2005. The family business was taken over by Prada in 1999, and it has since expanded its outlets overseas. As of 2014, the company employed 650 people. The same year, Church's took over adjacent premises in St James Road, formerly a tram and later a bus depot, in anticipation of further expansion which could add up to another 140 jobs. Location Its main installations are located in the St James area of Northampton, with an estimated production capacity of 5,000 pairs per week, 70% of which are exported all over the world. Besides products sold to resellers and individual customers, the company also has several of its own retail stores, including ones in Jermyn Street, London, George Street, Edinburgh, Pacific Place, Hong Kong, and County Arcade, Leeds.

He made his professional debut in 1992 and reached the top makuuchi division in 1997. He held the second highest rank of ≈çzeki or champion for 65 consecutive tournaments from 1999 until 2009, making him the longest serving ≈çzeki in the modern era. He won three top division y≈´sh≈ç or tournament championships, and was a runner-up on seven other occasions. However, he also held the dubious record of being in danger of demotion from ≈çzeki fourteen times. He wrestled for Kokonoe stable until his retirement in January 2010 at the age of 33. He remained in sumo as a coach at his stable, and became the head coach in August 2016 following the death of Chiyonofuji. Career After his father's death, Chiyotaikai's family moved to ≈åita, which is considered his hometown and listed as such on the banzuke ranking sheets. When he was eleven, his mother remarried, to a local businessman. (In May 2009, Chiyotaikai finally adopted his mother's remarried surname of Sud≈ç as his own.) He was an enthusiastic player of baseball and soccer as well as martial arts. He excelled at karate, and in judo he came third in the All-Japan Middle School Judo Championships. However, he also got into fights and petty crime as a member of a gang of youths. After graduating junior high school, he worked as a construction worker before he decided on his mother's prompting to apprentice himself to Kokonoe-oyakata, the former Chiyonofuji, the 58th Yokozuna and one of the strongest wrestlers in sumo history, who managed the Kokonoe stable. Kokonoe initially refused the new wrestler because of his bleached hair and obliged him to get a haircut before allowing him to join. Chiyotaikai was given his shikona (wrestler name) in honour of his stablemaster and joined professional sumo in November 1992 and became a sekitori in July 1995 upon entering the second highest j≈´ry≈ç division. He remained in j≈´ry≈ç for another two years, but after winning two j≈´ry≈ç championships in March and July 1997 he reached makuuchi, the top division. In May 1998, Chiyotaikai was made komusubi and never left the san'yaku ranks after that. He won the prestigious Technique Prize three times that year. In January 1999, he won his first top division championship, defeating yokozuna Takanohana and Wakanohana on the last two days, and Wakanohana once again in a play-off. He had compiled a three tournament record of 32‚Äì13, and he was promoted to ≈çzeki after the tournament, the first newcomer to the rank since Musashimaru and Takanonami five years earlier. Even though he had to bow out from his very first tournament that he fought as an ≈çzeki in March 1999 after breaking his nose, he retained his rank until November 2009. In July 2007 he broke Takanohana Kenshi's record of fifty tournaments at ≈çzeki rank, which had stood for over 25 years, and extended his record to 65 consecutive tournaments. Chiyotaikai in May 2009 The reverse side of his longevity as an ≈çzeki was his inability to achieve promotion to yokozuna. After his first tournament win he performed at a rather mediocre level for some time; his next big success being the near-winner in the January tournament of 2002, where he lost a playoff to fellow ≈çzeki Tochiazuma having led going into the final day. After finishing as runner-up in May 2002 he then won his second championship in the next tournament in Nagoya. His first title since becoming an ozeki was achieved losing just one match, his best ever result. However, he was able to win only ten bouts in the next tournament, and following injury problems it took him until March 2003 to achieve his third and final tournament victory. After finishing as a runner-up in July 2003, September 2003 and March 2004, he struggled again until the November 2005 tournament where he was runner-up for the sixth time. After another lean couple of years, in November 2007 he was the tournament co-leader until the 14th day when he lost to Hakuh≈ç. He injured his elbow during this match and had to default on the final day. He was still troubled by the injury in the January 2008 tournament and withdrew after losing his first seven bouts. He was never again to produce a winning score in double figures. Chiyotaikai's 2‚Äì13 score in March 2009 was the worst record ever compiled by an ≈çzeki, and meant he was kadoban (in danger of demotion from ≈çzeki status) for a record thirteenth time in May. After bringing a 7‚Äì7 record into the final day's competition, he managed to win his last match and thereby return to full ≈çzeki status. He had been restricted by a left side ache and high blood sugar levels, and sat out the regional tour in April due to a fractured rib. Retirement In September 2009 Chiyotaikai withdrew from the tournament after suffering eight defeats in the first ten days. He had an injury to his left knee in addition to his elbow problem, and commented, \\"I have no power to fight once I get in the ring.\\" Kadoban for the fourteenth time in the Kyushu tournament in November, he won his first two bouts but then lost eight in a row, his demotion from ≈çzeki being confirmed on Day 10 when he was lifted out by Asash≈çry≈´. He withdrew from the tournament after this defeat, but announced that he would return at sekiwake rank in January to try to win necessary 10 bouts designated by the JSA that would allow him to regain his ≈çzeki status. He stated he would retire if he failed to achieve this. After three straight losses in the January 2010 tournament, Chiyotaikai announced his retirement from sumo. His final match was against his longtime ≈çzeki rival Kai≈ç (who also broke the record for most makuuchi wins in this bout.) \\"I gave myself an ultimatum, so I don't have any regrets. I just don't have the power to continue wrestling my brand of sumo anymore,\\" said Chiyotaikai. He remained as a coach at his stable under the toshiyori name of Sanoyama-oyakata. He had his danpatsu-shiki, or formal retirement ceremony, at the Ry≈çgoku Kokugikan on October 2, 2010. Shortly after the death of Chiyonofuji on July 31, 2016, Chiyotaikai was confirmed as the new head coach of Kokonoe stable, changing his name from Sanoyama to Kokonoe-oyakata. Fighting style Chiyotaikai in action, May 2007. Chiyotaikai was somewhat above average in size (1.81 m/158 kg), but was nonetheless a very agile fighter who preferred quick decisions by oshi-sumo. He was known mostly for his explosive charge at the beginning of his matches (the tachi-ai) and his trademark barrage of forward thrusting hand-slaps (tsuppari). Indeed, he was so famous for them that he was sometimes criticized by sumo fans for being a \\"one-trick pony.\\" If Chiyotaikai's opponents managed to grab hold of his mawashi, he usually lost the match. His most common winning kimarite was oshi-dashi, which accounted for roughly a third of his wins. He also regularly used hataki-komi, the slap down, and tsuki-dashi, the thrust out. Only around five percent of his victories were achieved by yori-kiri, the most common overall technique in sumo. Personal life From 2003 until 2005 Chiyotaikai had a relationship with television personality Hikaru Kawamura. His stablemaster reportedly refused to countenance any wedding until he had reached the yokozuna rank. However, in a TV appearance with Kazuko Hosoki in 2007 Chiyotaikai indicated that he was seriously looking for a bride.

Ten to twelve filaggrin units are post-translationally hydrolyzed from a large profilaggrin precursor protein during terminal differentiation of epidermal cells. In humans, profilaggrin is encoded by the FLG gene, which is part of the S100 fused-type protein (SFTP) family within the epidermal differentiation complex on chromosome 1q21.  Profilaggrin  Filaggrin monomers are tandemly clustered into a large, 350kDa protein precursor known as profilaggrin. In the epidermis, these structures are present in the keratohyalin granules in cells of the stratum granulosum. Profilaggrin undergoes proteolytic processing to yield individual filaggrin monomers at the transition between the stratum granulosum and the stratum corneum, which may be facilitated by calcium-dependent enzymes.  Structure  Filaggrin is characterized by a particularly high isoelectric point, which is the result of the relatively high presence of histidine in its primary structure. It is also relatively low in the sulfur-containing amino acids methionine and cysteine.  Function  Filaggrin is essential for the regulation of epidermal homeostasis. Within the stratum corneum, filaggrin monomers can become incorporated into the lipid envelope, which is responsible for the skin barrier function. Alternatively, these proteins can interact with keratin intermediate filaments. Filaggrin undergoes further processing in the upper stratum corneum to release free amino acids that assist in water retention. Some studies attribute Filaggrin an important role in keeping the physiological acidic pH of the skin, through a breaking down mechanism to form histidine and subsequently trans-urocanic acid, however others have shown that the filaggrin‚Äìhistidine‚Äìurocanic acid cascade is not essential for skin acidification.  Clinical significance  Individuals with truncation mutations in the gene coding for filaggrin are strongly predisposed to a severe form of dry skin, ichthyosis vulgaris, and/or eczema. It has been shown that almost 50% of all severe cases of eczema may have at least one mutated filaggrin gene. R501X and 2284del4 are not generally found in non-Caucasian individuals, though novel mutations (3321delA and S2554X) that yield similar effects have been found in Japanese populations. Truncation mutations R501X and 2284del4 are the most common mutations in the Caucasian population, with 7 to 10% of the Caucasian population carrying at least one copy of these mutations. Autoantibodies in rheumatoid arthritis recognizing an epitope of citrullinated peptides are cross-reactive with filaggrin. The barrier defect seen in filaggrin null carriers also appears to lead to increased asthma susceptibility and exacerbations. Filaggrin deficiency is one of the top genome-wide genetic determinants of asthma, along with the variants found that regulate ORMDL3 expression. In early infancy, the penetrance of filaggrin mutations may be increased by household exposure to cats.

It is believed that Falari produces the best feta cheese in Greece. The stretch of mountain includes parts of the municipalities of Lixouri, Pylaros, Sami and Kranaia. At Agia Dynati, during the 16th century, the Holy Monastery of Panagia Thematon was built. Many traditional villages, such as Makriotika, Divarata, Poulata, are built in the mountains. In mythology, Agia Dynati is believed to be the rock that Cronus threw to Earth, after Zeus gained power. Rhea, the wife of Cronus, gave him the rock covered with swadding-clothes to eat it, because Cronus had eaten all of her children. When Cronus swallowed the rock, he suffered. So, Rhea could birth his child Zeus in Crete without Cronus knowing it. When Zeus gained power, he commanded Cronus to throw the rock to the Earth and also the children he had eaten.

On 31 May 2012 the Irish government announced its intention to wind up the Authority. The full dissolution was due to take place in May 2014 with a plan to phase the organisation into the Docklands Consultative Forum. At the time, this plan was postponed due to disengagement of the DDDA leading up to the dissolution date. The Authority was officially dissolved on 1 March 2016. History The stated mission of the DDDA was to 'develop the Dublin Docklands into a world-class city quarter paragon of sustainable inner city regeneration ‚Äì one in which the whole community enjoys the highest standards of access to education, employment, housing and social amenity and which delivers a major contribution to the social and economic prosperity of Dublin and the whole of Ireland'. The Authority was due to work until 2012 on the development of the area and manage the investment of ‚Ç¨7bn from both public and private sources. The broad remit of The Authority included social regeneration which in practical terms resulted in the building of over 11,000 new homes. They also managed several events each year including the Docklands Fun Run which started from Grand Canal Dock. Among the more famous projects it was responsible for overseeing were the Spencer Dock development, the Point Village (which ran into financial difficulties and was taken over by NAMA), and the proposed U2 Tower (which was abandoned). Glass Bottle Plant losses In November 2006, a consortium headed by property developer Bernard McNamara, and including financier Derek Quinlan and the Dublin Docklands Development Authority paid ‚Ç¨412m for the 25 acres former Irish Glass Bottle site in Ringsend in Dublin. However the development never went ahead and the land ‚Äì which ultimately cost ‚Ç¨431 million when the price of acquisition, stamp duty and other costs is included ‚Äì was valued in 2011 at ‚Ç¨45 million. A special report on the DDDA by the Comptroller and Auditor General found that the authority failed to get an independent valuation of the site before committing to the deal, a move which ultimately ended up costing the authority ‚Ç¨52 million. Winding up On 31 May 2012 the Irish government announced its intention to wind up the Dublin Docklands Development Authority. The decision followed the publication of a special report on the DDDA by the Comptroller and Auditor General, which contained \\"damning findings about the authority's conduct\\". The Minister for Environment Phil Hogan, who was responsible for the DDDA, said the Government remained fully committed to the continued regeneration of the Dublin Docklands. However he said that taking account of several reports published about the DDDA, keeping the authority on a standalone basis was no longer viable, financially or otherwise. The authority was to remain in place for a transitional period of up to 18 months under a new board chaired by the then Dublin city manager John Tierney, later chief executive of Irish Water. In November 2013 Phil Hogan announced that he had asked the board to remain in place for an indefinite period. The authority's planning functions had already been transferred to the city council. In December 2013 the D√°il Committee of Public Accounts (PAC) called Paul Maloney (CEO of the DDDA from 2005 to 2009) before it to discuss the developments at the DDDA. The PAC chairman, John McGuinness, stated that the committee wished to discuss Maloney's role in the risk assessment/risks which were identified and advised to the Board by the Executive; his involvement in the selection of Bernard McNamara as a joint venture partner; his involvement in deciding on the tender bid amount and his involvement in allowing Bernard McNamara latitude to increase the bid based on this expertise, and why Mr Maloney submitted a letter to the Department of the Environment citing a valuation of ‚Ç¨220 million when, in reality, the Board was considering a bid of almost double that amount. On 10 June 2014 the Dublin Business Forum decided that the dissolution plan would be postponed due to disengagement of the DDDA leading up to the planned dissolution date of May 2014. There were three main issues: 1) Failure to acknowledge enterprise as the key driver of Docklands success 2) Unclear terms of reference for the membership of the Docklands Consultative Forum 3) Lack of transparency in the transfer the remaining cash and related assets The Authority was fully dissolved on 1 March 2016.

He was assessor of the college of physicians, member of the literary society at Halberstadt, and master of St. John's school in that city. After a classical education at Halberstadt and Wolfenb√ºttel, Abel entered himself at the former place as a student of theology, in 1731, under Johann Lorenz von Mosheim; a year later, he moved to Halle, where he attended the lectures of Christian Wolff and Alexander Gottlieb Baumgarten, and often preached himself with much applause. Though he had a great chance of succeeding to the rectorship of St. John's school in his native place, Abel in a few years gave up theological pursuits altogether, applied to medicine at Halle, and in 1744 was admitted to the degree of doctor at K√∂nigsberg in Prussia. On his return to Halberstadt, he practised as a physician for over half a century before his death in 1794. In the early part of his life, Abel had made a poetical translation of the Satires of Juvenal into German, which, by the advice of his friend Gleim, he retouched a few years before his death, and published in 1788. He intended to correct and publish Ovid's Remedia Amoris, which he had also translated in his youth, and to attempt Persius, but age and other occupations prevented him from accomplishing this. Abel married in 1744, and left three daughters and two sons, one of whom, John Abel, physician at D√ºsseldorf, has distinguished himself as a writer.

Their 2009 album Tales from the Grave in Space was one of the first albums ever released as a completely free download while signed to a record label. History=Beginnings: 2002‚Äì2005 School friends Joe McGuigan (bass guitar) and Philly Byrne (vocals) formed Gama Bomb with the guitarist Luke Graham in Newry in 2002 and soon built up a small but loyal following which they consolidated with a rigorous touring schedule and frequent forays into self-released recording. The band first gained attention with their demo \\"The Survival Option\\" in the same year. In 2003, they toured and released \\"The Fatal Mission\\" single. During this period Byrne often appeared on stage in fancy dress as a chef, priest, pirate or scientist in an increasingly colourful stage show which frequently included a thrash metal version of the theme tune from the 1980s TV show Teenage Mutant Ninja Turtles. Gama Bomb's first tour dates outside Ireland were in 2004, supporting the punk band The Dangerfields on a tour of Scotland. Survival of the Fastest: 2005‚Äì2007 Gama Bomb released their full-length album, Survival of the Fastest, through the European music label Witches Brew in early 2006. The album, which had originally been independently released in a limited edition format in late 2005, included many of the bands then live staples of which many, aside from those present on previous EP releases, had never been commercially available. At this point, the band's line-up changed with the original guitarist Kevy Canavan leaving and the addition of drummer Paul Caffrey. In late 2005, Domo Dixon filled the vacant guitar spot. The 2006 version of the album features the bonus tracks \\"M.A.D.\\" and \\"The Survival Option\\" from their 2004 \\"Fatal Mission\\" single. In April 2006, as the album was released, Gama Bomb embarked on their first UK tour. The \\"Insane Quest for Flesh\\" tour had support from Mutant and Deceptor and is seen as a landmark event in the rise of the resurgent UK thrash scene. =Zombi Brew split 7\\" EP= After live dates in summer 200, as well as coverage in music magazines like the NME and Terrorizer, Gama Bomb self-recorded a demo of their new album Citizen Brain to show to interested labels. Seeking a larger label to help them tour Europe, the demo did the rounds with most of the major metal labels. Around this point Earache Records began to take a serious interest in the band. In May 2007, Gama Bomb joined the Hungarian thrash band Black Sister on a split 7\\" EP released by Problem? Records. The Gama Bomb side had new tracks \\"Zombi Brew\\" (from the Citizen Brain demo) and \\"Frightmare On Hell St.\\", together with a cover of the punk band The Dangerfields' song, \\"Maniac\\". The EP was released exclusively on 7\\" vinyl and limited to 200 copies. Earache and Citizen Brain: 2008‚Äì2009 In September 2007, Gama Bomb announced that they had signed a recording contract with Earache Records. The band contributes the song \\"Zombi Brew\\" to the Thrashing Like A Maniac compilation released by Earache Records, alongside other new thrash artists such as Evile, Municipal Waste, Mutant (London), Short Sharp Shock and Send More Paramedics. In April 2008, Earache confirmed the release for early June of Gama Bomb's first album for the label, Citizen Brain. The album was released in July 2008 to overwhelmingly positive reviews. The band toured Europe extensively to support the album. Since the release of Citizen Brain, the band has been vocal in its support of music downloading, and led a campaign to 'Stamp Out Inferior Metal' on their 2008 Thrashing Like A Maniac Tour, asking fans to bring along CDs they regret buying and to destroy them at shows. In summer 2009, the band played mainstage bookings at the European metal festivals Hellfest in France and Tuska Open Air in Finland alongside M√∂tley Cr√ºe, WASP, Anthrax and Suicidal Tendencies. In January 2009, they were voted best newcomer in a Terrorizer magazine readers' poll, and toured Europe with Exodus and Overkill in early 2009 as part of the Killfest tour. Tales from the Grave in Space and departure from Earache : 2009‚Äì2011 Gama Bomb announced via their MySpace blog in August 2009 that they were returning to the studio to record their third album Tales from the Grave in Space for a November 2009 release. The album was produced by Scott Atkins, who had produced the band's Citizen Brain album. On 8 September the band announced that Tales from the Grave in Space would be released online completely free on November 5 via Rapidshare, making them the first metal band to release an album for free while signed to a record label. Issue 200 of the UK version of Metal Hammer, sold in branches of Tesco, came with a copy of the CD as a free cover mount. A physical version of the album was later released. The bass guitarist Joe McGuigan has said that despite it already being given away for free, Tales from the Grave in Space had actually outsold Citizen Brain physically. In March 2010, Gama Bomb was nominated in the Best Underground Band category of the Metal Hammer Golden Gods Awards, losing to the black metal band Immortal on the night. They supported Sepultura on their July UK tour. The band embarked on its first US tour, in support of Overkill, Forbidden and DRI, from October to December 2010, and played a series of shows in Europe beforehand with the original lead guitarist Canavan back in the line-up, filling in for Domo Dixon. In February 2011, Gama Bomb announced they would undertake a final UK tour to 'say goodbye' to Tales from the Grave in Space before writing a new album in the summer. The band also revealed on Facebook that a possible new track would be titled \\"The Cannibals Are In The Streets (Therefore) All Flesh Must Be Eaten\\". The band played at two shows in Mexico in May, toured the UK in support of Onslaught in September, undertook a European tour in October and played their first-ever South American shows in December, supporting Dark Funeral on a tour of Brazil. The Terror Tapes and AFM records: 2012 ‚Äì present In March 2012, the band revealed via Facebook that vocalist Byrne had undergone surgery for vocal fold nodules, sustained over the last year's touring, and was recovering from the procedure. During this period the band played a show in Enschede, Netherlands, with McGuigan taking on vocals in Byrne's place. On 3 April 2012 the band announced that founding member Graham was leaving after 10 years on rhythm guitar. The amicable split allowed John Roche of Slave Zero (band) to join Gama Bomb as the band's new guitarist, having toured with the band as a live musician in 2011. In July 2012, the band celebrated its tenth anniversary with two shows in Belfast and Dublin, reuniting on stage with the former guitarists Canavan and Graham for greatest hits sets. On 28 January 2013 the band announced that its fourth album, The Terror Tapes, was to be released on AFM Records on 19 April in Europe and 22 April in the UK and Ireland, followed by a US release on 7 May. The album was produced by the band's long-term producer, Scott Atkins, in Dublin and Suffolk. The band announced the album would be preceded by a single, the band's first, called \\"'Terrorscope\\", which would be released as a free download on 26 March, followed by an exclusive 7\\" vinyl maxi-single. Byrne said of the single's free release: \\"It was really important to us to give people some music for nothing. It's how we get our music and we want people to know we're cool with them doing that, as long as they support us. Support comes from a lot of different places, not just the front pocket.\\" The video for Terrorscope was released on 20 March. On 4 March, The Terror Tapes artwork was revealed. It was created by the veteran horror movie poster artist Graham Humphreys, whose work includes posters for A Nightmare on Elm Street and Evil Dead. The band undertook the 'Speed of Sound' European tour with Artillery and Brazilian band Torture Squad in May to support the album, before playing a series of summer festivals. Musical style and lyrical themes Stylistically rooted in 1980s thrash metal the band has stated that its influences include acts such as Nuclear Assault, Kreator, Agent Steel, Sodom, old Slayer and early Megadeth. Allmusic labelled their music as punk metal (crossover thrash). Gama Bomb's lyrics often refer to the horror, action and science fiction movies, cartoons and computer games of the 1980s, as well as paying tribute to many classic heavy metal themes. They also write topical songs on social issues like racism and global warming. The band is known for injecting its own sense of humour into its lyrics, with bizarre song concepts which lampoon classic thrash metal topics. Recurrent themes to be found in Gama Bomb songs are cannibalism, war, zombies, human sacrifice, ghosts and murder.

Remus rose to power during the early days of Prohibition. Early life Remus was born in Landsberg, Germany in 1878 to Frank and Marie Remus. Remus arrived to the United States on June 15, 1882 (departing from Norway on the ship named \\"Fifington\\" to New York) and briefly lived in Maryland, then Wisconsin and finally moved to Chicago in 1885. At age 14, George supported the family by working at his uncle's pharmacy because Remus' father was unable to work. After graduating from the Chicago College of Pharmacy at 19 years of age, Remus became a certified pharmacist, and bought the pharmacy at age 21. Within five years, Remus expanded, buying another drugstore. However, he soon tired of the pharmacy business, and by age 24 he had become a lawyer. Legal and bootlegging careers Remus attended the Illinois College of Law (later merged with DePaul University College of Law) and was admitted to the Illinois Bar in 1904. Remus specialized in criminal defense, especially murder, and became quite famous, due in large part to the highly publicized William Cheney Ellis murder case in 1914. It was in this case that Remus pioneered the \\"transitory insanity\\" defense that would evolve into what is now known as the \\"temporary insanity\\" defense. By 1920, Remus was earning $500,000 a year, approximately $ today. Following the ratification of the 18th Amendment and the passage of the Volstead Act, on January 17, 1920, Prohibition began in the US. Within a few months, Remus saw that his criminal clients were becoming very wealthy very quickly through the illegal production and distribution of alcoholic beverages. He decided to become a criminal himself, using his knowledge of the law to escape punishment. Remus memorized the Volstead Act and found a loophole which allowed him to buy distilleries and pharmacies to produce and sell bonded liquor for medicinal purposes, under government licenses. Remus' employees would then hijack his own liquor so that he could sell it illegally. Remus moved to Cincinnati, where 80 percent of America's bonded whiskey was located within a radius, and bought up most of the whiskey manufacturers. In two years, he had bought and sold a seventh of the bonded liquor in America In less than three years, with the help of his trusted number two man George Conners, Remus made $40 million and had about 3,000 people working for him. He owned many of America's most famous distilleries, including the Fleischmann Distillery. In addition to serving the Cincinnati community, many small towns, such as Newport, Kentucky, became drinking towns where gamblers opened small casinos to entertain their drunken patrons. One of Remus' fortified distilleries was the so-called \\"Death Valley Farm\\", in Westwood, Cincinnati, which he purchased from George Gehrum. The outside world thought it was only accessible by dirt road. The actual distillery was located at 2656 Queen City Ave. The alcohol was distilled in the attic of the house then dumb-waitered below. A trap door was located in the basement, which was the entrance to a tunnel about long and under the ground. The bootleggers would push the products along the tunnel to a waiting car, usually making it safely away. It is believed to be one of the only locations never busted in the Cincinnati area. In 1920, a raid by hijackers took place, but Remus' armed guards, led by John Gehrum, fired heavy volleys at the hijackers and, after a short fight, the wounded attackers left. In addition to becoming the \\"King of the Bootleggers\\", Remus was known as a gracious host. He held many parties, including a 1923 birthday party for his wife Imogene, in which she appeared in a daring bathing suit along with other aquatic dancers, serenaded by a fifteen-piece orchestra. Local children saw Remus as a fatherly figure, and some played on the estate. In 1922, Remus and his wife held a New Year's Eve party at their new mansion, nicknamed the Marble Palace. The guests included one hundred couples from the most prestigious families in the area. As parting gifts, Remus presented all the men with diamond stickpins, and gave each guest's wife a brand new car. He held a similar party in June 1923, while he was having problems with the government, at which he gave each female guest (of the fifty present) a brand new car. Personal life Romola Remus The Fairylogue and Radio-Plays Marriages On July 20, 1899, Remus married Lillian Klauff. Their daughter, born in 1900, was Romola Remus, who became a child actress in silent films, playing cinema's first Dorothy Gale in the 1910 version of The Wizard of Oz when she was eight years old. The marriage ended in divorce in 1920 after Remus began an affair with his legal secretary, Augusta Imogene Holmes (n√©e Brown). Holmes was a young divorc√©e with a young daughter, Ruth. Remus and Holmes were married in Newport, Kentucky in June 1920. Legal issues In 1925, Remus' plan to use his legal knowledge to evade the law went awry. He was indicted for thousands of violations of the Volstead Act, convicted by a jury that made its decision in under two hours, and given a two-year federal prison sentence. He spent two years in Atlanta Federal Penitentiary for bootlegging.Haunted Cincinnati and Southwest Ohio by Jeff Morris, Michael A. Morris; Arcadia Publishing, 2009 While he was in prison, Remus befriended another inmate and eventually confided in him that his wife, Imogene Holmes, had control over his money. The inmate was an undercover prohibition agent, Franklin Dodge, who was there to gather information of that sort. Instead of reporting the information, Dodge resigned his job and began an affair with Remus' wife. Dodge and Holmes liquidated Remus' assets and hid as much of the money as possible. In addition, Remus's Fleischmann Distillery was sold by Holmes. Remus' wife gave her imprisoned husband only $100 of the multimillion-dollar empire he created. Holmes and Dodge attempted to deport Remus, and even hired a hit man to murder Remus for $15,000. The would-be assassin didn't follow through because he feared being double-crossed, and told Remus about the plot instead. In late 1927, Imogene Holmes filed for divorce from Remus. On the way to court, on October 6, 1927, for the finalization of the divorce, Remus had his driver chase the cab carrying Holmes and her daughter through Eden Park in Cincinnati, finally forcing it off the road. Remus jumped out and fatally shot Imogene in the abdomen in front of the Spring House Gazebo to the horror of park onlookers. The prosecutor in the case was 30-year-old Charles Phelps Taft II, son of Chief Justice of the United States and former President William Howard Taft and brother of the future Senator Robert A. Taft. Although he had lost his last big case against another bootlegger, Taft was seen as a man with a bright political future. The trial made national headlines for a month, as Remus defended himself on the murder charge with the help of Charles Elston. His first wife and daughter stayed by him; his step-daughter testified against him and depicted Remus as an abusive husband. Remus pleaded transitory insanity, which he had used previously during his time as a defense lawyer, emphasizing his distress at his wife's betrayal. The jury deliberated only nineteen minutes before acquitting him. The State of Ohio committed Remus to an insane asylum since the jury found him insane, but prosecutors were thwarted by their previous claim (backed up by the prosecution's three well-known psychiatrists) that he could be tried for murder because he was not insane, and Remus was freed from the asylum after only 7 months. Later years and death George Remus later moved to Covington, Kentucky (across the Ohio River from Cincinnati), where he lived out the next twenty years of his life modestly without incident. He married for a third and final time to his long-time secretary Blanche Watson. Remus ran a small contracting firm, Washington Contracting, until he suffered a stroke in August 1950. For the next two years, he lived in a boarding house in Covington under the care of a nurse. Remus died on January 20, 1952 at the age of 73. He is buried beside his third wife at Riverside Cemetery in Falmouth, Kentucky. In popular culture Remus is sometimes credited as the direct inspiration for The Great Gatsby, though he might have been one of several figures such as Arnold Rothstein. Remus is the subject of Craig Holden's novel The Jazz Bird (2001). Remus was featured in the 2011 Ken Burns documentary, Prohibition; texts written by Remus were read by Paul Giamatti. Remus has also been portrayed by Glenn Fleshler as a supporting character on HBO's Prohibition-era series Boardwalk Empire beginning in its second season. In this series, he is portrayed as having the quirk of referring to himself in the third person, which Remus was known to do. Remus was the subject of two books in 2019, The Ghosts of Eden Park by Karen Abbott and The Bourbon King by Bob Batchelor. George Remus Bourbon, named after Remus, is made by MGP of Indiana.

He is the CEO of Financial Advisory at Lazard. Before June 2019, he was the firm's Head of North American M&A; and Global Co-Head of Healthcare. Orszag previously served as a Vice Chairman of Corporate and Investment Banking and Chairman of the Financial Strategy and Solutions Group at Citigroup. Before joining Citigroup, he was a Distinguished Visiting Fellow at the Council on Foreign Relations and a contributing columnist for the New York Times op-ed page. Prior to that, he was the 37th Director of the Office of Management and Budget (OMB) under President Barack Obama and had also served as the Director of the Congressional Budget Office (CBO). Orszag is a member of the National Academy of Medicine of the National Academies of Sciences. He serves on the Boards of Directors of the Peterson Institute for International Economics, the Mount Sinai Hospital, and New Visions for Public Schools in New York. Early life Orszag grew up in Lexington, Massachusetts, the son of Reba (n√©e Karp) and Steven Orszag. His paternal great-grandparents were Jewish immigrants from Hungary who immigrated to New York City in 1903.US News and World Report: \\"10 Things You Didn‚Äôt Know About Peter Orszag\\" By Carol S. Hook November 25, 2008 His father was a math professor at Yale University and his mother was the president and owner of a research and development company.New York Times: \\"Bianna Golodryga, Peter R. Orszag\\" September 24, 2010 His brother is Jonathan Orszag. After graduating from Phillips Exeter Academy with high honors (1987), Orszag earned an A.B. summa cum laude in economics from Princeton University in 1991 after completing an 80-page long senior thesis titled \\"Congressional Oversight of the Federal Reserve: Empirical and Theoretical Perspectives.\\" He then received a M.Sc. (1992) and a Ph.D. (1997) in economics from the London School of Economics. He was a Marshall Scholar 1991‚Äì1992, and is a member of Phi Beta Kappa. Career Orszag became a lecturer at the University of California, Berkeley, and taught macroeconomics in 1999 and 2000. As a senior fellow and Deputy Director of Economic Studies at the Brookings Institution, he co- founded and directed The Hamilton Project and (in conjunction with Georgetown University's Public Policy Institute) the Pew Charitable Trust's Retirement Security Project. He served as Special Assistant to the President for Economic Policy (1997‚Äì1998), and as Senior Economist and Senior Adviser on the Council of Economic Advisers (1995‚Äì1996) during the Clinton administration. He also formed a consulting group called Sebago Associates, which merged into Competition Policy Associates and was bought by FTI Consulting Inc. for a reported $70 million. After leaving the Obama administration, Orszag took a job with Citigroup. A 2011 article in New York Magazine suggested Citi's hiring of Orszag \\"signaled that Citi would be invested in the intellectual marketplace,\\" and that \\"just about anyone will take the call of a former White House budget director.\\" In May 2016, Orszag joined Lazard as managing director and vice chairman of investment banking. He is also an invitee of the Bilderberg Group and attended the conferences in 2010, 2011 and 2012. Congressional Budget Office Orszag was director of the Congressional Budget Office from January 2007 to November 2008. During his tenure, he repeatedly drew attention to the role rising health care expenditures are likely to play in the government's long-term fiscal problems‚Äîand, by extension, the nation's long-term economic problems. \\"I have not viewed CBO's job as just to passively evaluate what Congress proposes, but rather to be an analytical resource. And part of that is to highlight things that are true and that people may not want to hear, including that we need to address health- care costs.\\" During his time at the CBO, he added 20 full-time health analysts (bringing the total number to 50), thereby strengthening the CBO's analytical capabilities and preparing Congress for health-care reform. He was widely praised for his time at CBO for preparing the agency for the debates to come. When he stepped down, National Journal noted that \\"Orszag, who will turn 40 on Dec. 16, has been praised by lawmakers from both parties as an objective analyst with deep knowledge of the most pressing fiscal issues of the day, including health care policy, Social Security, pensions, and global climate change. He is the unusual economist who blends an understanding of politics, policy and communications in ways that wrap zesty quotes around complex ideas.\\" Office of Management and Budget 2009 budget meetingOn November 25, 2008, President-elect Barack Obama announced that Orszag would be his nominee for director of the Office of Management and Budget, the arm of the White House responsible for crafting the federal budget and overseeing the effectiveness of federal programs. Peter Orszag with President Obama in the Oval Office in January 2009 Orszag, in a November 2009 speech in New York, said that deficits, which were expected to add $9 trillion to the existing national debt of $12 trillion over the next decade, are \\"serious and ultimately unsustainable.\\" He said that deficit spending was necessary to help boost the economy when unemployment is hovering around 10 percent. But he said that red ink must be stopped as the economy recovers. During a recovery, private investment will again pick up and compete with the federal government for capital. In 2011, he was described by New York Magazine as a \\"deficit hawk and clashed with Larry Summers, who wasn‚Äôt as focused on the long-term debt crisis.\\" In July 2010 Orszag said that \\"The problem now is weak growth and high unemployment rather than outright economic collapse\\". Still, the deficit would be equivalent to 10 percent of the gross domestic product, the highest level since World War II. The Office of Management and Budget's mid-session review, forecast a smaller deficit and stronger economic growth than the administration's initial budget release. The deficit forecast in 2011 increased to $1.42 trillion, up from the $1.27 estimate in February. For 2012, the deficit estimate rose to $922 billion, up from $828 billion in the previous report. The annual budget shortfall would bottom out in 2017 at $721 billion, or 3.4 percent of GDP, and begin rising again in following years. A review of Orszag's daily schedules shows his sustained focus on healthcare reform as soon as he joined Obama's Cabinet. The daily schedules for Orszag, who left his position as OMB director in July 2010, reveal that he and key White House aides regularly met to discuss healthcare starting in January 2009, within days of Obama entering office. Orszag also had meetings with insurance executives and health experts as the White House made health reform its top legislative priority after enacting the $814 billion stimulus from the American Recovery and Reinvestment Act of 2009. When Orszag resigned, the Progressive Policy Institute summed up his time in office: \\"For an administration numbers-cruncher, he was unusually visible, which was a good thing. With a reputation for impartiality and brilliance, Orszag gave the administration's agenda analytical ballast. There will no doubt be efforts on the right to brush Orszag with the red ink that the administration finds itself swimming in, but that's politics as usual. Inheriting the worst economy since the 1930s, Orszag presided over the Herculean task of preventing a complete meltdown and setting the foundation for a recovery. In many ways, he's a reflection of the administration at its best: a rigorous, pragmatic empiricist.\\" Citigroup Orszag held two jobs at Citigroup: Vice Chairman of Corporate and Investment Banking and Chairman of the Financial Strategy and Solutions Group. He joined Citigroup in 2011. According to New York Magazine, \\"for an ambitious economist like Peter Orszag, going to work for Citigroup represented a choice. As a young staffer working in the Clinton White House, he saw laid before him two different paths: Stiglitzism and Rubinism. There were both intellectual and career-arc components to these. While both are liberal Democrats, Rubin was the consummate insider, whose philosophy was that the free markets, balanced budgets, and limited regulation would create a rising tide that would lift all boats (or at least make Wall Street not complain too much about Clinton's social programs). Stiglitz, the public intellectual, is as concerned with the boats as with the tide. Orszag certainly had a lot in common with Stiglitz's academic mien, having grown up in an intensely intellectual family in Lexington, Massachusetts, outside Boston. His father was the celebrated Yale math professor Steven Orszag. But Orszag possessed an ambition that would take him beyond the ivory tower. He ultimately chose Rubinism. It makes perfect sense that Orszag would have been drawn toward Rubin. It must have been incredibly seductive seeing this world, watching the Rubin wing of the Democratic Party move so easily from government to Wall Street boardrooms to the table with Charlie Rose.\\" Lazard In May 2016, Orszag joined Lazard as Vice Chairman of investment banking and Managing Director. He was later named Global Co-Head of Healthcare and, subsequent to that, Head of North American M&A.; Orszag took over as CEO of Financial Advisory in June 2019, overseeing the firm‚Äôs advisory work for corporations and governments across the globe. Orszag has been charged with \\"breathing new life into Lazard\\" as the firm faces increased competition from copycat advisory firms. As CEO, Orszag led Lazard's team of advisors who worked with Argentina's government during the country's $65 billion sovereign debt restructuring in 2020. Personal life At Sylvan Dale Ranch in 2010 Orszag's first wife was Cameron Rachel Hamill. The Reliable Source.New York Times: \\"Cameron Hamill and Peter Orszag\\" August 31, 1997 They had two children before divorcing. In 2009, he fathered a child with his former girlfriend, Claire Milonas.Mark Leibovich, \\"If Peter Orszag Is So Smart, What Will He Do Now?\\", January 8, 2010, New York Times In 2010, Orszag married Bianna Golodryga, then co-host of ABC's GMA Weekend.

An equivalent formation in the British Army would be the Territorial Army. The Regiment infantry units formerly consisted of 2 series of reservist; the mobilised 300 series and the volunteer 500 series. The 300 series, which consisted of 5 infantry battalions, with mobilised reservists for full-time duty, have since 2008 been converted into a new regular border regiment, the Rejimen Sempadan. The 500 series are reserve volunteers units, based in major towns and cities throughout the whole country. In all there are about sixteen 500 series infantry battalions, in addition to other support and service support reserve units.Official website of Malaysian Army History * Pioneer Units in Malaya Soldiers of Rejimen Askar Wataniah in a shooting course with Heckler & Koch HK33A2, circa 1990s. In 1861, the Penang Pioneers were formed as a volunteer army unit of the Straits Settlement. Similar units were created in Singapore and in the other Malay States. In 1902, the Malay States formed the Malay States Volunteer Rifles (MSVR). The Unfederated Malay States also formed their own volunteer units. With further expansion, the formations were then known as the Federated Malay States Volunteer Force (FMSVF), Unfederated Malay States Volunteer Force (UFMSVF) and the Straits Settlement Volunteer Force (SSVF). * Second World War With the outbreak of the Second World War, the volunteer units were mobilised and fought alongside the regular British, Indian and Australian troops in the defence of Malaya and Fortress Singapore. * Japanese Occupation of Malaya During the Japanese Occupation of Malaya, the Chinese dominated Malayan People's Anti-Japanese Army conducted guerrilla warfare against the Japanese occupiers. As only the regular Malay Regiment led by British officers had acquitted itself well until the surrender in Singapore (February 1942), the British felt it was possible to involve Malays in the resistance against the Japanese but only with extensive training and by working in close co-operation with the stay behind British forces. The British desperately needed Malay resistance fighters to operate in Malay dominated areas. During the Japanese Occupation, a number of local Malays formed resistance groups and carried out guerrilla warfare against the Japanese. Resistance units in Pahang were called WATANIAH, derived from the Arabic word WATAN (state). The Wataniah was led by Yeop Mahidin Bin Mohamed Shafiff (known as the Father of Wataniah). Force 136 of the Special Operations Executive was amongst the British formations that co-ordinated the Malayan resistance (including the Wataniah movement) against the Japanese. * Malayan Emergency After the war, the volunteer units were reformed. With the start of the Malayan Emergency, the Home Guard was raised and tasked with local static defence, thus releasing regular British, Commonwealth and Malayan units for combat operations against the Communist Terrorists. In 1958, with the security situation under control and the threat from the Communist Terrorists diminished, the Home Guard was disbanded. However, many of the members of the Home Guard wished to continue their voluntary service, and the Federation Government agreed to the formation of the Territorial Army with the passing of the Territorial Army Ordinance 1958. The Askar Wataniah was formed on 1 June 1958. * Al-Mau'nah Arms Heist, 2000 The Al-Mau'nah Sauk Arms Heist happened on 2 July 2000 at an outpost and a camp manned by members of Bn 3524 of Rejimen Askar Wataniah was involved in an arms heist by the Al-Mau'nah Militant Group. In the small hours of the morning, 21 members of the militant group visited the outpost and camp of Bn 304 Rejimen Askar Wataniah under the guise of a surprise inspection and relieved the soldiers' weapons or carted away weapons from the armoury. They took away a huge cache of firearms and ammunition, including 97 M16 assault rifles, four GPMGs, five grenade launchers, 9,095 rounds of 5.56mm and 60 rounds of 40mm ammunition. The group was later cornered in the village of Sauk, Perak and involved in a stand-off the Malaysian Army and Royal Malaysian Police forces. Police threw a containment cordon of Bukit Jenalik. The group then took several hostages and holed up for four days in Bukit Jenalik, Sauk before finally surrendering to security forces. However, they brutally tortured and murdered two of the hostages -‚Äî a soldier and a police personnel. The Al-Mau'nah group later surrendered, and the leaders brought to trial for \\"waging war upon the King\\". Mohamed Amin Mohamed Razali and his group were brought to trial for charges of \\"waging war against the King\\", and became the first people convicted of such charges in Malaysia. Mohamed Amin Mohamed Razali and his two lieutenants, Zahit Muslim and Jamaluddin Darus, were sentenced to death. Sixteen others were given life sentences.

Askar Wataniah Specialist Engineering Units are based at the Markas Jurutera (SP) (HQ L of C) in Bukit Haigate, Kuala Lumpur and comprises: * Port Specialist Regiment (Jurutera Pakar Pelabuhan) These port operating units are formed at the main Malaysian ports, and members are drawn from amongst port personnel at the ports of Kuantan, Klang, Penang, Bintulu and Kuching. * Railway Specialist Regiment are tasked with the maintenance and operation of the Malaysian railway system during emergencies. The unit recruits from members of Malayan Railways and the State Railway of Sabah. * Water Specialist Regiment with strength recruited from staff of water supply utility companies. * Power Specialist Regiment are recruited from Tenaga Nasional Berhad and other power generation companies. Pasukan Latihan Pegawai Simpanan (PALAPES) Pasukan Latihan Pegawai Simpanan (PALAPES) or Reserve Officers Training Units (ROTU) were formed at 13 universities and institutions of higher learning all over Malaysia. Its main purpose is to train (diploma and first degree) students to become subalterns or young officers to serve as active reservists in the TA 500 series upon their commission. These students will be known as 'cadet officers' and undergo trainings for the next three (3) years to qualify them for King's Commission. It was said that the cadet's training are as equivalent standard of the 1 year RMC Cadet Wings training. After commission as second lieutenant, they are transferred to any 16 TA 500 series to serve as reservists. Many of them join the Malaysian Army as regular officer under the Graduate Scheme. It had been perceived that the establishment of PALAPES was highly motivated by the American's own ROTC or Reserve Officer Training Corps and UK's own OTC or Officer Training Corps. The ROTC or OTC standards were and are still highly regarded as equivalent to their counterpart at Westpoint or Sandhurst, unlike in Malaysia, the PALAPES standard is yet to be officially recognised as equivalent to the current institutions such Cadet Wings RMC, Airforce College, Naval College, ATMA and now UPNM. Standardisation is importance as to ensure the country's combat readiness is not compromised. Historically, following the Confrontation, the Reserve unit was formed on 3 April 1965 as the 1st Infantry Battalion, Askar Wataniah at University Malaya, mustered from amongst undergraduates and staff of Universiti Malaya. Initially 30 undergraduates from various faculties volunteered and underwent basic training during their semester breaks at the Recruit Training Camp at Kem Latihan Seputih, Batu Gajah, Perak. The majority of the recruits had prior experience in the Army and Police Cadets and many were former students of the Maktab Tentera DiRaja (Royal Military College). The aftermath of 13 May 1969 riots saw the expansion of the Askar Wataniah unit to other universities with A Company formed in Institut Teknologi MARA, B Company formed in Universiti Pertanian Malaysian (UPM) (now called Universiti Putra Malaysia) and C Company formed at Universiti Kebangsaan Malaysia while the unit at Universiti Malaya took on the role of battalion HQ. On 18 December 1978, the Brigadier General Dato' Abdul As Ismail, the Director of Askar Wataniah discussed the formation of the Reserve Officers Training Units with the university Vice-Chancellors and the Director of ITM. Pursuant to the meeting, the Armed Forces Council approved the formation of the Reserve Officer Training Unit ROTU at Malaysian local universities to attract Reserve Officers from amongst staff and undergraduates of the various universities. ROTU is currently known as Pasukan Latihan Pegawai Simpanan (PALAPES). There are currently thirteen (13) Malaysian public universities and institutions of higher education (IPTAs) hosting PALAPES units. Units are formed at Universiti Malaya (PALAPES UM), Universiti Teknologi Malaysia, Universiti Kebangsaan Malaysia, Universiti Sains Malaysia, Universiti Putra Malaysia, Universiti Utara Malaysia, Universiti Malaysia Sarawak, Universiti Malaysia Sabah, Universiti Teknologi MARA, Universiti Tun Hussein Onn Malaysia, Universiti Pendidikan Sultan Idris, Universiti Malaysia Perlis, Universiti Malaysia Terengganu, International Islamic University Malaysia and Universiti Malaysia Pahang. There are several universities hosting tri-services PALAPES units e.g. Army, Navy and Airforce, some hosting Army and Navy and most hosting only the Army. Now, with thirteen (13) universities and IPTAs hosting PALAPES units, around 1,200 up to 3,000 officers or subalterns or commonly known as YO (young officers) are commissioned yearly. The mass commissioning of the new YO yearly had indirectly created some issues to the Armed Forces such as; a) Imbalance number of position available in the TA units compare to the growing number of YOs b) Imbalance of strength between NCOs and YOs c) Many of the YOs are posted to infantry units of 500 series rather than to fill many available subalterns post at combat support elements and services such as Medic Corp, Signal etc. d) The recruitment of Potential Officers (PO) to post directly as Capt, Major or Lt Col within 1 week training had created a gap between the inexperienced and troublesome YOs in term of quality of delivery as platoon commander up until battalion command. Mobilised units The mobilised units before disbanded consists of five 300 series infantry battalions of the Rejimen Askar Wataniah responsible for protecting the northern border of peninsular Malaysia, the security of East-West Highway and Key Points Units tasked in protecting the strategic areas of the country. These units have since been converted into Rejimen Sempadan on 9 February 2008. Valour Although the unit is a reserve force, the unit has produced a soldier awarded the medal of honour. One Private Ielias Ibrahim was awarded the medal Panglima Gagah Berani (PGB) for his action in a firefight at Grik, Perak on 15 August 1977.

Their songs include elements of several different genres, such as Classical, doom metal, Gothic metal, black metal, and folk music. Despite the band's licensed CDs availability exclusively from the CCP Records label in Austria and Akoi Music in South Korea, their music's spread over the Internet over the decades since Estatic Fear albums were released resulted in forming of an international fan community of over 7000 fans hailing from several dozen world countries, which is still active in 2019, twenty years after Estatic Fear's latest album release.  History  The band was founded in 1994 with the intent of combining both classical melodies, Doom metal and Gothic metal styles in an instrumental mixture of lute, flute, piano, synth violins, cello, and soprano vocals singing in English, Latin, and German. In 1995, Estatic Fear took part in the one-hour compilation \\"Exit\\", produced by Martin Auzinger and Peter Kern, together with bands Coffee & Cream, Mortus, Born In The Bottle, Bereavement, Nochtschicht, Herb, Dystrophy, Still No Name, and Out Of Cage. Later, in 1996, an agreement was signed with CCP Records, which led to the debut of their first album, Somnium Obmutum (\\"Muted Dream\\" in Latin), a four track epic which consisted of two short instrumental compositions, and two relatively long songs. In this album, doom metal is combined with orchestral arrangements on piano and cello, and instruments such as the lute, flute, and acoustic guitar. The album was widely observed with interest from local media and underground metal fans alike. After nearly three years of inactivity, Matthias Kogler (who formally acted under the pseudonym of \\"Calix Miseriae\\") recorded the second album A Sombre Dance in its entirety as a solo artist, since the remaining members had previously left the band. Guest musicians were featured on the album to assist with additional instruments. The tracks labeled \\"Chapter I\\" through \\"Chapter IX\\" are meant to be interpreted as if the album was played as a story or concept album, meant to be told consecutively as though each song was a different chapter. Although Estatic Fear have not achieved particular commercial success, they gathered a distinguished cult following after the release of A Sombre Dance. , Kogler had apparently written enough material for two new albums, but was uncertain when he would have time to record them. In 2017 Estatic Fear's extended band biography was published, based on an interview with Stauff, a founding member or Estatic Fear, Astaroth, and PULSE. In 2019, following the YouTube release of a live cover of the Somnium Obmutum epic from Estatic Fear's debut album by Shadow Suite, production of an international tribute to Estatic Fear was announced by the global fan community; it will include Estatic Fear songs covers by bands and one-man-band projects from around 15 world countries. No ETA is set for the tribute release, but according to the organizers by July 2019 it was approximately 50% complete..

Although legitimated in 1512 while still a minor, he continued to be known as the \\"Bastard of Arran\\". As a key member of the Hamilton family, and second cousin of James V, King of Scotland, he became a prominent member of Scottish society. Rise Hamilton was granted the lands of Finnart in 1507 and knighted at a young age in 1511. As a child he joined the king's household and was given gifts of boots and shoes.Accounts of the Lord High Treasurer of Scotland, vol. 4, pp. 53, 82, 99, 233. In 1513 he was accepted as his father's heir, should his father not have legitimate heirs, which he later did. During the winter 1517/18 James was in France and brought back letters from Francis I to Scotland. At the end of March 1518 he returned to France with replies concerning the murder of Antoine d'Arces, sieur de la Bastie and his father's actions against the culprits.Hay, Denys, Letters of James V (HMSO, 1954), pp. 56-58. Arran struggled with Regent Albany and James V later in 1526 formally forgave him, Arran, the Earl of Eglinton, Lord Avandale, Hugh Campbell of Loudoun, and others for bearing arms against Albany with 5000 or 6000 men at \\"Kittycrocehill\\" by Glasgow.Register of the Privy Seal of Scotland, vol. 1 (Edinburgh, 1908), no. 3409. In 1520 Hamilton played a part in provoking the \\"Clear the Causeway\\" fight with the Earl of Angus in Edinburgh's High Street. Hamilton and his father managed to escape from the skirmish by stealing horses and crossing the Nor Loch marshes. In September 1526 Hamilton was the murderer of John Stewart, 3rd Earl of Lennox, who had surrendered to the Hamilton side following the Battle of Linlithgow Bridge. On 22 October 1526, Hamilton was made Keeper and Captain of Linlithgow Palace with a legal ceremony involving the symbolic presentation of stones and earth followed by his entry to the palace and the closure of the doors behind him.Beveridge & Russell, ed., Protocol Books of Thomas Johnson (SRS: Edinburgh, 1920), p. 78-9 no. 384. George Buchanan wrote that in revenge for the murder of Lennox a groom from the earl's stable stabbed Hamilton at the Pend of Holyroodhouse.Buchanan, George, History of Scotland (Glasgow, 1827), pp. 296, bk. xiv, cap. xxxi. Unharmed, at court he was made principal sewer, a noble waiter at the king's table, and master of the king's stables.Cameron, Jamie, James V (Tuckwell, 1998), p. 204, (appointments in 1527 under the Angus regime) He was involved in persecution of the Protestants, including his own cousin Patrick Hamilton, who was burnt at the stake in 1528. When his father died in 1529, he became guardian of his half-brother the nine or ten-year-old James, 2nd Earl of Arran, and was for a time the most influential of the Hamilton dynasty, and one of the most powerful men in Scotland. In November 1528 he was described by an English diplomat Thomas Magnus with disapproval as one of the young king's counsellors, as \\"Sir James Hamylton, whoe did sley the Erle of Lenneux.\\" Magnus thought Finnart and other unsuitable courtiers including the Sheriff of Ayr, the Laird of Buccleuch, Lord Maxwell, and Lord Methven, the husband of Margaret Tudor were responsible for continuing the forfeit and attainder of the Earl of Angus. However, Magnus also heard that Finnart and the Sherrif of Ayr, two \\"cherished servants\\" of James V met the forfeited rebels Archibald Douglas of Kilspindie and George Douglas of Pittendreich at Cockburnspath to discuss the restoration of the Earldom of Angus. This meeting and familiarity with Douglas family would later be used against Finnart.State Papers Henry Eighth, vol. 4 part 4 (London, 1836), pp. 526, 530. Master of Work for building royal palaces and castles Fireplace in Stirling Palace, built for James V by James Hamilton of Finnart, (interior restored 2010) He was appointed Steward of the Royal Household and Master of Works to King James. King James granted Hamilton with the Draffan estate in Lanarkshire, on which he built Craignethan Castle in 1530.Iain McIvor in Apted, Gilyard-Beer & Saunders ed., Ancient Monuments and their Interpretation, Craignethan Castle, 239-261 He probably also built Cadzow Castle near the South Lanarkshire town now known as Hamilton. In Linlithgow, Hamilton acquired the site of a large townhouse from his cousin James Hamilton of Kincavill in January 1531.Beveridge & Russell, ed., Protocol Books of Thomas Johnson (SRS, 1920), pp. 78-9 no.3 84, the site was nos. 77-87 High Street, Linlithgow. In 1536, Hamilton supplied James V with equipment for hunting horses, hounds and hawks, and the King ordered Patrick, Lord Gray, who was indebted to the crown, to pay him 850 Scottish merks.Beveridge & Russell, ed., Protocol Books of Thomas Johnson (SRS, 1920), p. 28. As Master of Works, he was responsible for restorations to the royal palaces of Linlithgow, Blackness Castle and possibly Falkland Palace. His major work was creating the renaissance palace at Stirling for which he was richly rewarded. Some gunloops at Blackness Castle date from Finnart's works In 1537, the treasurer allowed Finnart the composition fee for the Wardship of the heir of Patrick Butter of Gormo against ¬£133-6s-8d he had spent at Linlithgow and Blackness Castle.Accounts of the Lord High Treasurer of Scotland, vol.6 (1905), p.2, 304.(Finnart had owed for this wardship since 1532) This pattern of financing continued, and at Stirling Castle on 22 September 1539, Finnart was given a substantial gift of lands in recompense for his service in completing works at Stirling Palace and Linlithgow Palace, including; Strathaven Castle, Crawfordjohn, Gorgie in Renfrewshire, and other lands made into a barony of Avondale.Register of the Great Seal of Scotland 1513-1546, (1883), 453-454, no. 2021. Finnart's building work continued at Stirling Palace with an advance of ¬£4000 Scots in October 1539, and ¬£300 for works at Linlithgow and Blackness Castle in April 1540.Accounts of the Lord High Treasurer of Scotland, vol.7 (Edinburgh, 1907), pp. 256, 302. At Linlithgow Palace, Hamilton of Finnart reconstructed the entrance fa√ßade A later historian, William Drummond of Hawthornden, mentioned an advance of 3000 Crowns in April 1540 for rebuilding a castle on the Isle of Bute, meaning Rothesay Castle, but this is not recorded in the royal accounts.The Works of William Drummond of Hawthornden (1711), pp. 110-112. After his execution in August 1540, Finnart left debts for the building work at Stirling Palace. The royal blacksmith, William Hill, was paid for the ironwork and yetts he had made in August 1541.Accounts of the Lord High Treasurer of Scotland, vol. 7 (Edinburgh, 1907), 471. As late as January 1542, Edward Lytall's wife was paid ¬£487 for the ironwork and timber she had supplied.Accounts of the Lord Treasurer of Scotland. vol. 8, p. 55 A priest, sir James Nycholsoun, finished off the work at Stirling, which Finnart had begun in May 1538,Accounts of the Master of Works, vol. 1 (HMS0, 1957), pp. 227-228. spending ¬£1459-15s-10d before Christmas 1540,Accounts of the Lord High Treasurer of Scotland, vol. 7 (Edinburgh, 1907), p. 474. and a carpenter Robert Robertson was appointed master of work to complete the palace. Fall In 1540 King James became convinced that Hamilton was plotting against him, although no evidence for this was presented. Arrested on charges of treason in late July, on 16 August Hamilton was tried, convicted and executed. Amongst the charges presented on 16 August, were these, which dated back 12 years, and suggest concerns about the security of the royal bedchamber; > \\"Sir James Hamilton of Finnart, having been convicted of the treasonable > shooting of guns and firing of missiles outside the palace of Linlithgow and > from the bell-tower of the same, at the king and the people in his company, > both at the time the king came to the palace and when he withdrew from the > same, and especially at his lodging place in the same town, the king being > personally present at the time of the firing of the said missiles. And for > art and part in the treasonable imagination, planning, and consultation, > vulgarly called devising, of assassinations, at the time it is said he was > with Archibald Douglas of Kilspindie and James Douglas of Parkhead at the > chapel of St Leonard near Edinburgh, after the forfeiture of Archibald > Douglas, formerly Earl of Angus, George Douglas of Pittendreich his brother, > and the said Archibald Douglas, his father, and also during the siege of > Tantallon Castle in consultation with the said Douglases, how he would enter > by the window near the upper part of the bed, 'the bedhead' (superiorem > thori - literally above the pillows), in the King's palace near Holyrood > Abbey, and how there he would commit the slaughter of the King. And for > common treason and conspiracy against the King, his realm and lieges. > Therefore it was given that this James forfeited his life, lands, rents and > possessions to the king as his escheat, to remain with him in > perpetuity.\\"Acts of the Parliaments of Scotland,vol. 2, (Edinburgh, 1814), > p. 362, Latin, December 1540: translation adapted from Records of the > Parliaments of Scotland to 1707 (RPS) St Andrews University ref: 1540/12/7 After Finnart was beheaded at Edinburgh, James V seized Craignethan Castle, and took the silverwork from the chapel, and this was engraved with the arms of the king's infant eldest son, James, Duke of Rothesay. A chest with Finnart's papers was also brought to Edinburgh, and many of these were destroyed by crown officers.Accounts of the Lord High Treasurer, vol. 7 (1907), 397: HMC, 9th report, appendix, on the Mss of Dalyell of the Binns, part 2 (London, 1884), 231, 234a Cardinal Beaton gave money to his widow, as she was his relative.Hannay, R. K., Rentale Sancti Andree (SHS, 1913), pp. 108, 122. After his death, Finnart is said to have appeared to the James V in a dream, and declared that he \\"would shortly lose both arms, then his head.\\" This prophecy came true, as the King lost both of his young sons in 1541, and died himself in 1542. The story was recorded by John Knox and George Buchanan.Fraser, Antonia (1970). Mary Queen of Scots (Panther), p. 29. Evidence and theories on Finnart's execution The execution of James Hamilton of Finnart has historical interest as an incident that has been cited as evidence of arbitrary cruelty and greed in the behaviour of James V. This and other aspects of the story were discussed in the History of the Five Jameses by William Drummond of Hawthornden first published in 1655. Another theme, which is based on George Buchanan's History of Scotland, sees Finnart as a close associate of Cardinal Beaton and active in the support of the Catholic Church, would identify his enemies as Protestant interests in Scotland. George Buchanan alleges that Finnart was a judge in trials of heresy, and his account of Finnart's arrest and trial mentions particularly the roles of James Learmont of Dairsie, Master of Household, and James Kirkcaldy of Grange as Protestants with the Catholic Secretary Thomas Erskine of Haltoun. In Buchanan's story these three became committed to Finnart's execution after arresting him on the King's orders. John Knox however merely gives the story of the King's haunting, and writes he would not comment whether the execution was just or unjust.Buchanan, George, trans. Aikman, James, History of Scotland, vol. 2 (Glasgow, 1827), pp. 319-320, (Bk. 14, Cap. lvii): Knox, John, History of the Reformation, Book 1, various eds. Finnart was supposed to have prevented James V meeting Henry VIII of England and possibly marrying Princess Mary and then hindering the King's French marriage plans by leading his ships off-course in August 1536. (At the time, the English ambassador William Howard heard that Finnart was working to arrange the King's marriage to his mistress, Margaret Erskine)State Papers Henry VIII, vol. 5, part IV part 2 (London, 1836) 41, where the 1836 footnote suggests the James Hamilton mentioned was the Sheriff of Linlithgow, brother of Patrick Hamilton (martyr), recent writers Charles McKean and Jamie Cameron identify Finnart. An anti-Hamilton narrative account written in 1570 shortly after James Hamilton of Bothwellhaugh had assassinated Regent Moray, gives an insight into Finnart's execution and his possible motivations. This account mentions that the charges against Finnart were old, dating from just after the departure of John Stewart, Duke of Albany in 1524. As noted in the records of the Parliament of Scotland, Finnart was accused of planning to kill James V at Holyroodhouse. Though this plan was not executed, the writer in 1570 added that Finnart persevered to delay the King's marriage so that the Hamilton family would succeed as kings of Scotland. The Hamiltons were supposed to have hoped the King might die by misfortune without heirs. According to this 1570s account, which Cecil noted as an 'Exhortation to the Lords of Council against the Hamiltons,' from that time forth Finnart was in disfavour.Calendar of State Papers Scotland, vol. 3 (Edinburgh, 1903), 75, attributed in the 18th century to George Buchanan. Robert Lindsay of Pitscottie, the writer of a chronicle history, shares this bias against the Hamilton family and Hamilton of Finnart.Ken Emond, The Minority of James V (Edinburgh, 2019), p. 274. The reasons for Finnart's execution remain unclear and some recent writers, such as Jamie Cameron doubt that his role and significance was as pivotal as the author of the 'Exhortation' suggests.Cameron, Jamie, James V (Tuckwell, 1998), pp. 191-227. Some evidence suggests that Finnart was not unambiguously an ally of the Douglases. Letters written by Douglas agents following James V's journey in France in October 1536 (and intercepted by the English) reported that Finnart was not in favour and that the king had said to John Drummond of Milnab when they were aboard ship; \\"If I would but once look merely upon the earl of Angus, Sir James would droop; for by the wounds of God, for all Sir James' bragging, the earl of Angus and he never met but Sir James turned ever the back seams of his hose.\\"Letters and Papers, Foreign and Domestic, Henry VIII, vol. 11 (London, 1888), no. 916, ii Family Finnart married Margaret Livingston of Easter Wemyss some time before 1529, and had issue: # James Hamilton of Crawfordjohn # Agnes Hamilton, who married James Somerville, 6th Lord Somerville # Grissel Hamilton who married Andrew Leslie, 5th Earl of Rothes in 1548. A Somerville family history states that James V attended the wedding of Agnes at Craignethan, perhaps on 8 April 1536, but the modern historian Jamie Cameron doubted this tradition.Cameron, Jamie, James V, Tuckwell (1998), 224 n.168: Scott, Walter, ed., Memorie of the Somervilles, vol. 1 Edinburgh (1815). In addition, James fathered at least ten illegitimate children, to at least three mistresses, Marion Stewart, Elizabeth Murray, and Elizabeth Elphinstone. # Andrew Hamilton # James Hamilton senior # Alexander Hamilton # James Hamilton, junior, (b. 1520) ReferencesSources * Cameron, Jamie, James V, the personal rule, Tuckwell (1998), 191-227. * McKean, Charles, 'Hamilton of Finnart', History Today, (January 1993) * McKean, Charles, 'The Castle of the Bastard of Arran', PSAS, vol. 125, (1995), 1069-1090 * McKean, Charles: 'Sir James Hamilton of Finnart: a Renaissance Courtier-Architect', Architectural History, vol. 42, SAHGB, (1999), 141-72.

K. Chesterton detailing a popular theme both in his own philosophy, and in Christianity, of the \\"holy fool\\", such as in Dostoevsky's The Idiot and Cervantes' Don Quixote. Plot summary This is a book in two parts. The first, \\"The Enigma of Innocent Smith\\", concerns the arrival of a new tenant at Beacon House, a London boarding establishment. Like Mary Poppins, this man (who is tentatively identified by lodger Arthur Inglewood as an ex-schoolmate named Innocent Smith) is accompanied by a great wind, and he breathes new life into the household with his games and antics. During his first day in residence the eccentric Smith creates the High Court of Beacon; arranges to elope with Mary Gray, paid companion to heiress Rosamund Hunt; inspires Inglewood to declare his love for Diana Duke, the landlady's niece; and prompts a reconciliation between jaded journalist Michael Moon and Rosamund. However, when the household is at its happiest two doctors appear with awful news: Smith is wanted on charges of burglary, desertion of a spouse, polygamy, and attempted murder. The fact that Smith almost immediately fires several shots from a revolver at Inglewood's friend Dr. Herbert Warner seems to confirm the worst. Before Smith can be taken to a jail or an asylum, Michael Moon declares that the case falls under the purview of the High Court of Beacon and suggests that the household investigate the matter before involving the authorities or the press. The second part, \\"The Explanations of Innocent Smith\\", follows the trial. The prosecution consists of Moses Gould, a merrily cynical Jew who lives at Beacon House and considers Smith at best a fool and at worst a scoundrel, and Dr. Cyrus Pym, an American criminal specialist called in by Dr. Warner; Michael Moon and Arthur Inglewood act for the defence. The evidence consists of correspondence from people who witnessed or participated in the exploits that led to the charges against Smith. In every case, the defendant is revealed to be, as his first name states, innocent. He fires bullets near people to make them value life; the house he breaks into is his own; he travels around the world only to return with renewed appreciation for his house and family; and the women he absconded with are actually his wife Mary, posing as a spinster under different aliases so they may repeatedly re-enact their courtship. Smith is, needless to say, acquitted on all charges. Film adaptations The book was first adapted in French, as a Belgian film titled Le revolver aux cheveux rouges (1973).

Pettibone was best known as a defendant in trial of three leaders of the Western Federation of Miners for the 1905 assassination by bombing of Frank Steunenberg, former governor of Idaho. Biography Pettibone was convicted of contempt of court and criminal conspiracy in the Coeur d'Alene labor strike of 1892. He was later implicated in the 1905 assassination of Frank Steunenberg, ex-governor of Idaho, by a confession and testimony from Harry Orchard. Western Federation of Miners (WFM) general secretary Bill Haywood and WFM president Charles Moyer were also implicated. Haywood was represented by Clarence Darrow, the most renowned defense lawyer of the day, who obtained an acquittal. Pettibone was tried after Haywood, and was defended by Orrin N. Hilton of Denver. Pettibone was also acquitted, and charges against Moyer were dropped.Carlson, Roughneck: The Life and Times of Big Bill Haywood, 1983. Pettibone fell ill with cancer during his trial.

Ostrea angasi superficially resembles Ostrea edulis and both species may be referred to with the name ‚Äúflat oyster‚Äù. However, the two species do not occur naturally in the same geographic distribution. Habitat This species is found in sheltered, silty or sand-bottomed estuaries at depths between 1 and 30 m. Diet Flat oysters, like all other oyster species, are filter feeders, feeding on, and taking in anything small enough to be filtered in their gills. This may include plankton, microalgae or inorganic material.  Predators  Oyster growers at Coffin Bay, South Australia have observed stingrays eating their experimental commercial stocks of Ostrea angasi. Commercial harvesting Extensive oyster reefs in southern Australia were largely destroyed by over- exploitation during the 19th and early 20th Centuries. Oysters were dredged directly from the seabed.National Library of Australia > Trove: Oyster beds. South Australian Register, 15 December 1884. P 4. Accessed 8 May 2015.Alleway, H. K. and Connell S.D. (2015): Loss of an ecological baseline through the eradication of oyster reefs from coastal ecosystems and human memory. Conservation Biology, Society for Conservation Biology. DOI: 10.1111/cobi.12452 In the 21st century, commercial oyster growers in southern Australia have started experimentally farming O. angasi as a means to diversify their businesses. This was prompted by other growers suffering massive stock losses of Crassostrea gigas resulting from outbreaks of Pacific Oyster Mortality Syndrome (POMS).  Not-for-profit projects  The not-for- profit organisation Estuary Care Foundation was established in South Australia to undertake trials growing Ostrea angasi in the Port River and adjacent waters. The organisation is also involved in seagrass monitoring and restoration work within the Port River.  Windara Reef  Windara Reef was constructed in Gulf St Vincent, offshore from Ardrossan, to promote the reestablishment of Ostrea angasi. The reef was also opened to recreational fishers in 2017. As of April 2019, it was the largest shellfish reef restoration project in the southern hemishere. The Nature Conservancy, the Australian Government, the South Australian Government, the Yorke Peninsula Council, The University of Adelaide and the Ian Potter Foundation have each contributed to funding the project.

Katz) p. 22 (the first high priest to serve in The First Temple), leading scholars to assume the Teacher as a Kohen (priest) of Tzadokite lineage.  Identity = The \\"missing\\" High Priest 159‚Äì152 BCE  One theory initially advocated by Jerome Murphy-O'ConnorJerome Murphy-O'Connor, Teacher of Righteousness, Anchor Bible Dictionary VI, p340f and subsequently by Stegemann is that the Teacher of Righteousness served as High Priest but was subsequently ousted by Jonathan Apphus. In 1 Maccabees, no High Priest is named for the period from the death of Alcimus in 159 BCE to the claiming of the position of High Priest by Jonathan on the authority of Alexander Balas in 152 BCE (1 Macc 10:18‚Äì20). From this it could be concluded that there was no High Priest for these years, and indeed Josephus, drawing heavily on 1 Maccabees at this point in his history, comes to that conclusion (Ant. 20.237). It is improbable, however, that the office remained completely vacant for these years. Stegemann suggests that the reason that nothing is said in 1 Maccabees about a High Priest between Alcimus and Jonathan was apologetic: to conceal the fact that the Hasmoneans obtained the High Priesthood by usurping it from its rightful holder, the Teacher of Righteousness.H. Stegemann, The Library of Qumran: On the Essenes, Qumran, John the Baptist, and Jesus. Grand Rapids MI, 1998 Alvar Elleg√•rd follows this line and argues that the Teacher of Righteousness was not only the leader of the Essenes at Qumran, but was also considered something of a precursor to Jesus Christ about 150 years before the time of the Gospels.Alvar Elleg√•rd; Jesus‚ÄîOne Hundred Years Before Christ: A Study In Creative Mythology, London (1999). Critics of this theory accuse it of being too hypothetical: slotting the Teacher as High Priest into a convenient gap during which no other High Priest is recorded in the few sources available. Neither the Damascus Document, nor 1QS or 4QMMT suggest that the legitimacy of the High Priest was an issue for the split. In addition, the motivation behind the split of the sect from mainstream Judaism appears to have been of a religious rather than political nature.  A 1st Century BC Messiah figure  Michael O. Wise posits that the Teacher of Righteousness was the \\"first messiah\\", a figure predating Jesus by roughly 100 years.Michael O. Wise, The First Messiah: Investigating the Savior Before Christ, HarperCollins 1999 This figure ‚Äì who Wise believes was named Judah ‚Äì rose to prominence during the reign of Alexander Jannaeus, and had been a priest and confidant to the king. However, he became dissatisfied with the religious sects in Jerusalem and, in reaction, founded a \\"crisis cult\\". While amassing a following, the Teacher (and his followers) claimed he was the fulfillment of various Biblical prophecies, with an emphasis on those found in Isaiah. The Teacher was eventually killed by the religious leadership in Jerusalem, and his followers hailed him as messianic figure who had been exalted to the presence of God's throne. They then anticipated that the Teacher would return to judge the wicked and lead the righteous into a golden age, and that it would take place within the next forty years. Wise explains that dating of manuscript copies among the Dead Sea Scrolls shows that the Teacher's postmortem following drastically increased in size over several years, but that when the predicted return and golden age failed to materialize, his following dissipated rapidly.  A Sadducee priest  Other documents from the Dead Sea Scrolls portray the Teacher as involved in heavy conflict against a figure termed the \\"Wicked Priest\\", which has led to several proposals for their identity: A Sadducee (Zadokite) priest as the Teacher, possibly even the legitimate high priest, against a \\"wicked\\" Jonathan Apphus. \\"Zadok\\" in Hebrew (◊¶◊ì◊ï◊ß) translates as \\"righteous.\\" =Hyrcanus II= Somewhat along these lines is the proposal that Hyrcanus II was the Teacher of Righteousness. This was proposed in 2013 by Gregory Doudna.David Stacey, Gregory Doudna, Qumran Revisited: A Reassessment of the Archaeology of the Site and its Texts. BAR international series, 2520. Oxford: Archaeopress, 2013. Gregory Doudna, A Narrative Argument that the Teacher of Righteousness was Hyrcanus II. Excerpted from pp. 95‚Äì107 of the book Hyrcanus was the high priest of the Temple from 76 to 67 BCE and from 63 to 40 BCE. According to Doudna, Hyrcanus II‚Äôs sectarian orientation is now generally understood to have been Sadducee. Further, according to this hypothesis, Antigonus Mattathias would have been seen as the Wicked Priest. Antigonus was the last Hasmonean king of Israel. He ruled only for 3 years, and was executed by the Romans in 37 BCE. Antigonus was supported by the Pharisees.  Hillel against Shammai  Rabbi Harvey Falk identifies Hillel the Elder as the Teacher, against a \\"wicked\\" Shammai, a significant conflict mentioned in the Talmud (Jerusalem Talmud Shabbat 1:4).Rabbi Harvey Falk, Jesus the Pharisee: A New Look at the Jewishness of Jesus, p53f Most scholars date the Damascus Document and many of the Dead Sea scrolls to the decades around the year 100 BCE, vastly predating Hillel and Shammai. James is Jesus, Teacher of Righteousness Robert Eisenman has proposed the Historical Jesus was actually the Nazarene James, the Teacher of Righteousness against a \\"Wicked Priest\\" (Ananus ben Ananus), and a \\"Spouter of Lies\\" which Eisenman identifies as Paul of Tarsus.James the Brother of Jesus, Penguin, 1997‚Äì98, pp. 51‚Äì153 and 647‚Äì816.

He led the union through the Colorado Labor Wars, was accused of murdering an ex- governor of the state of Idaho, and was shot in the back during a bitter copper mine strike. He also was a leading force in founding the Industrial Workers of the World, although he later denounced the organization. Early life Little is known about Moyer prior to 1893.Fink, Biographical Dictionary of American Labor, 1984. He was born near Ames, Iowa. Moyer's parents, William and Maria Drew Moyer, were natives of Pennsylvania who migrated to Indiana by 1852 and on to Iowa by 1860. Charles was the youngest of five brothers and two sisters who survived their mother who died at the age of thirty-nine-years-old in 1870. In 1870, one of the sisters, a sixteen-year-old, had assumed the task of housekeeping for the family and care of Charles who was a sickly infant and youth.Moyer biographical information from Fink, pp. 259-60.U.S 1870 Census, Ontario, Story County, Iowa, MF 1914, M593, reel 420. He attended public school but left after the fourth grade.\\"Glossary,\\" in Samuel Gompers Papers, Volume 7, 1998. Moyer headed West in 1872 and found work as a cowboy in Wyoming. He returned East in 1885 and settled in Chicago, Illinois. He committed robbery, and served a year in the Illinois State Penitentiary. After his release, Moyer became a miner at the Homestake Mine in Lead, South Dakota, and joined the Lead City Miners' Union. In 1893, the Lead City Miners' Union was one of several unions which formed the Western Federation of Miners. Moyer was elected to the Executive Board of the WFM in 1900. After President Ed Boyce declined to run again in 1902, Moyer was elected his successor. WFM presidency Moyer was strongly committed to industrial unionism, and pushed the WFM to organize both underground and surface miners as well as all ancillary mine workers.Jensen, Heritage of Conflict: Labor Relations in the Nonferrous Metals Industry Up to 1930, 1950. Colorado Labor Wars The poster \\"Is Colorado in America?\\", with signature by Charles Moyer (bottom, left), which led to his arrest in 1904. Moyer's push for industrial union organizing involved the union in what came to be known as the Colorado Labor Wars. In August 1902, the WFM organized mill workers in Colorado City, Colorado. The employers planted a labor spy in the union, and 42 union members were fired. Negotiations over the dismissals dragged on into 1903. On February 14, 1903, the WFM struck. The employers claimed a riot was in progress, and Governor James Peabody called out the Colorado militia to suppress the strike. Miners in Cripple Creek and Telluride also struck, and the militia was deployed in those cities as well. Mass arrests began in September 1903 which finally broke the strike.Suggs, Colorado's War on Militant Unionism: James H. Peabody and the Western Federation of Miners, 1972. One of those arrested was Moyer. He had gone to Telluride to protest the mass arrests and deportation of miners. While there, he lent his signature to a WFM poster decrying the arrests. Moyer was arrested on March 28, 1904, for desecrating the American flag. He was released on bail, but re-arrested the following day on the orders of Adjutant General Sherman Bell of the state militia on charges of \\"military necessity\\". When Moyer successfully petitioned for a writ of habeas corpus, the Colorado State Attorney General and the local district attorney refused to release him. Moyer appealed to the Colorado Supreme Court On June 6, 1904, the court ruled in In re Moyer, 35 Colo. 163, that it could not question the governor's finding that insurrection existed in Colorado and that Moyer had not been arrested or imprisoned in violation of his rights. Moyer appealed to the U.S. District Court for the District of Missouri, and obtained a writ of habeas corpus on July 5, 1904. Alarmed by the writ, Governor Peabody revoked the finding of insurrection the same day and ordered Moyer released by 3:45 p.m. (before the federal writ could be served). Moyer was released, but his case continued to the U.S. Supreme Court. On January 18, 1909, the U.S. Supreme Court reaffirmed the decision of the Colorado Supreme Court in Moyer v. Peabody, 212 U.S. 78. Writing for the majority, Justice Oliver Wendell Holmes, Jr. refused to question the governor's assertion of facts which led to the declaration of martial law or grounds for Moyer's arrest. Concluding that the governor's good faith would protect a person's constitutional rights, Holmes held that Moyer's civil liberties had not been infringed. Radicalization The state's use of military power to crush union organizing drives convinced Moyer that no single union could be effective or successful. He concluded that only \\"one big union\\" linked to a strong political party could effectively counteract the anti-union power of the state and employers. Moyer subsequently became a strong supporter of the Socialist Party of America. In January 1905, Moyer participated in a conference in Chicago to consider whether the Socialist Party would be an effective vehicle for labor's goals. It was at this conference that the delegates decided to form a new union, the Industrial Workers of the World (IWW). When the IWW was formed in Chicago on June 27, 1905, Moyer immediately affiliated the WFM with the new labor federation.Dubofsky, We Shall Be All: A History of the Industrial Workers of the World, 2000. The Haywood trial In 1906, Moyer was implicated in the assassination of Frank Steunenberg, ex-Governor of Idaho. On December 30, 1905, Steunenberg, who had clashed with the WFM during several strikes, was killed by an explosion at his home in Caldwell, Idaho. Harry Orchard, a former WFM member who had once acted as Moyer's bodyguard, was arrested for the crime. Using coercion and intimidation (including restricted food rations and threats of immediate execution), Pinkerton agent James McParland wrung a 64-page confession from Orchard. The confession named Moyer and other WFM leaders as the instigators of the bombing plot.Carlson, Roughneck: The Life and Times of Big Bill Haywood, 1983. But Moyer was in Colorado, not Idaho. Idaho authorities were concerned that Orchard's confession would not be enough to persuade a judge to issue extradition papers. Acting in concert with law enforcement leaders, McParland perjured himself to convince a judge to issue the extradition papers against Moyer, falsely representing that Moyer had been in Idaho at the time of the murder, and was a fugitive from justice (under Idaho law, conspirators were considered to be present at the scene of the crime.\\"This fabric under which we have lived\\" (editorial), American Bar Association Journal, May 1968, v.54 p.473.) McParland arrived in Denver on Thursday, February 15, and presented the extradition papers to Colorado Governor McDonald, who, by prior arrangement with the governor of Idaho, accepted them immediately. But they waited until Saturday evening to arrest Haywood, Pettigrew, and Moyer, then held the three overnight in the Denver Jail, and refused requests by the three to contact lawyers and family. Early Sunday morning the prisoners were put on a special train, and guarded by Colorado militia, were sped to Idaho. Although the events were very controversial, the extradition was ultimately upheld by the US Supreme Court.Pettibone v Nichols, Supreme Court Reporter, Dec. 1906-July 1907, v.27 p.111-121. Haywood and Pettibone were acquitted in separate trials, after which charges against Moyer were dropped. Conservatism His experiences with the IWW led Moyer to the conclusion that the federation was too radical. Moyer was especially disturbed by the IWW's refusal to ally with or endorse any political party, which had been the key to Moyer's support for the creation of the IWW. In 1908, Moyer led the WFM out of the IWW, taking most of the IWW's membership (which belonged to the WFM) with him. Concerned that the WFM's reputation for radicalism was making it difficult to reach collective bargaining agreements, Moyer re-affiliated his union with the conservative American Federation of Labor (AFL) in 1911. Moyer pushed for more traditional labor union policies in his last decade in office. He forced the union's locals to agree to contracts which expired after a set period of time.The WFM practice had been to agree to open-ended contracts with no expiration date. Such contracts had been a hallmark of the WFM since its founding. He pushed resolutions through the WFM convention committing the union to the same limited legislative goals favored by the AFL such as the eight-hour day, a ban on child labor, and controls on immigration. He also withdrew his support for the Socialist Party and adopted the policy of nonpartisanship advocated by Samuel Gompers. WFM membership declined sharply from 1911 to 1916. In part, this was due to the continuing intense opposition from mine owners in the West. But conflict with the IWW also led to significant membership losses. Historian Vernon H. Jensen has asserted that the IWW had a \\"rule or ruin\\" policy, under which it attempted to wreck local unions which it could not control. From 1908 to 1921, Jensen and others have written, the IWW attempted to win power in WFM locals which had once formed the federation's backbone. When it could not do so, IWW agitators undermined WFM locals, which caused the national union to shed nearly half its membership.\\"Mine Federation in West Doomed by Faction's War,\\" Chicago Daily Tribune, June 27, 1914; \\"Paid Moyer's Gunmen.\\" Los Angeles Times. February 21, 1915; \\"Armed Guards Posted in Stores of Butte,\\" Los Angeles Times, June 28, 1914; \\"Butte Unions Back Rebels,\\" Los Angeles Times, June 23, 1914; \\"Disrupted by I.W.W.,\\" Los Angeles Times, June 22, 1914. Paul Brissenden noted WFM dissatisfaction with the IWW in Jerome, Arizona in 1913, attributing some of the friction to the fact that the WFM was becoming more conservative, accepting contracts with employers and affiliating with the AFL, while the IWW was becoming more revolutionary.Paul Frederick Brissenden, The I.W.W. A Study of American Syndicalism, Columbia University, 1919, page 318 (The IWW would not begin to accept contracts with employers until 1938.)The I.W.W.: Its First Seventy Years, 1905-1975, Fred W. Thompson and Patrick Murfin, 1976, page 100. The greatest animosity between the two organizations occurred in Butte, and resulted in the Butte, Montana labor riots of 1914. When Moyer went to Butte to mediate differences between the WFM loyalists and a dissident faction sympathetic to the IWW, he barely escaped from the WFM union hall before dissidents destroyed the building with dynamite. Moyer hid from the mob until he left town before dawn the next morning.Paul Frederick Brissenden, The I.W.W. A Study of American Syndicalism, Columbia University, 1919, page 319 Historian Melvyn Dubofsky, however, offers a different perspective. In Minnesota, for example, the miners went on strike in 1916 to abolish the contract system, to secure a minimum wage, and to end exploitation by the company. They approached the AFL and the WFM, both of which failed to respond. Dubofsky notes, \\"IWW headquarters had been advised of employee discontent on the eve of the [strike] ... and the IWW instantly had organizers on the spot.\\" Dubofsky states that the walkout occurred without IWW involvement, and he describes the evidence for this as \\"incontrovertible\\". The IWW was approached for help and, according to Dubofsky, the IWW \\"achieved its aims not by coercion but by giving the striking miners leadership, funds, and publicity.\\"Melvyn Dubofsky, We Shall Be All, A History of the Industrial Workers of the World, University of Illinois Press Abridged, 2000, pages 187-188 With the companies and the press accusing the IWW of sending \\"outside agitators\\", M.E. Shusterich, one of the Mesabi Range strike leaders, attempted to \\"set the record straight\\": > This strike was not started by the I.W.W., but has been underway the past > six years. We have appealed to every labor official in Minnesota to have the > miners on the range organized, but we have been shuttled back and forth > between the Western Federation of Miners and other organizations who passed > us on again until finally the miners took things into their own hands and > went out without organization.Philip Sheldon Foner, History of the labor > movement in the United States, 1980, 4th edition, pages 493-494 According to Marxist historian Philip S. Foner, the issues of socialism and industrial unionism ‚Äî and more specifically, the AFL vs. the IWW ‚Äî had been debated by the Minnesota miners since the WFM's Mesabi Range strike of 1907. Foner concluded that in the 1916 strike, \\"Most of the Range Finns ... backed the I.W.W.\\"Philip Sheldon Foner, History of the labor movement in the United States, 1980, 4th edition, page 493 Whatever the reasons for the decline, the WFM was particularly hard hit in the copper mining industries of Michigan and Arizona, and in the WFM's stronghold around Butte, Montana. In 1916, Moyer led a successful movement to change the union's name to the International Union of Mine, Mill, and Smelter Workers (colloquially known as \\"Mine Mill\\").  Copper Country Strike of 1913-1914 =Organization of workers The Western Federation of Miners began to heavily increase its presence in the Copper Country in 1912. Moyer warned WFM organizer Thomas Strizich on March 25, 1913, against calling a strike prematurely: > I was much pleased to hear of the progress being made in the way of > organizing in Michigan and sincerely trust that the men there will realize > the importance, in fact the absolute necessity, of deferring action that may > precipitate a conflict with the employers until they have practically a > thorough organization.  Initial involvement in the strike  When the Copper Country miners went out on strike on July 23, 1913, Moyer was at a conference in Europe, and so Vice President Charles E. Mahoney had to assume control of the strike until his return to the Copper Country. On August 22, soon after Moyer returned to Denver, he asked American Federation of Labor (AFL) President Samuel Gompers for financial aid for the Michigan strikers. Six days later the AFL Executive Council endorsed the strike; it did not assess affiliates but suggested an immediate appropriation of at least five cents per member. On that same day on which Moyer wrote to Gompers, the WFM sent $25,000 to Michigan, bringing the total to only $36,000 which had to suffice until September 12.Taft, p. 118American Federationist 21 (March 1914): 202AFL-WNL, Aug. 30 and Oct. 4, 1913WFM Expenditure Summary 1910-1933 On Sunday afternoon, August 31, a crowd of 2,700, 800 of them women and children, marched in sweltering heat to pack the Palestra, a \\"colossal oven,\\" where Moyer encouraged them to continue early morning picketing, telling them they had the right to peacefully persuade men to stay away from work. The WFM Executive Board fully sanctioned their strike, he told them. He had told reporters that the WFM had all kinds of money, piles and stacks of it. He assured the strikers that benefits would be forthcoming: the WFM had $161,000 \\"in cash here\\"; an assessment of $2 had been levied for September on each WFM member‚Äî90,000 of them, Moyer had said, doubling the actual membership figure. The $161,000 had included the loans he hoped to procure, but he did not tell them that. Rather, he depicted a financially secure WFM, ready and able to finance the strike, a characterization that was most unreal. The strikers passed resolutions calling for a Senate investigation, protesting the militia, and denouncing the deputies. A Mining Gazette reporter termed Moyer's speech a refreshing change from the \\"radical . . . viciously inflammatory\\" oratory of Miller and Mahoney. Were there \\"a few more conservative talkers such as Moyer there might be a chance, many people believe, for the federation to accomplish something, for the other class of verbal bombs is reacting against the organization,\\" the reporter stated. Moyer was long-winded and not an effective orator, he continued, but he really made \\"a nice little argument from the WFM point of view.\\" Moyer said that he favored having the militia in the district but that \\"the governor should order them to disarm all these thugs and gunmen, load them on trains and dump them without the confines of the state.\\" The reporter commented that \\"in this statement Moyer has the approval of a great many people on both sides of the strike question.\\"  Meeting with Ferris and Darrow  Moyer cut short his visit to the strike zone to confer with Governor Woodbridge Nathan Ferris on September 3. Joining him was Clarence Darrow, who had previously defended Moyer, Haywood, and Pettibone in the Steunenberg murder case. Moyer and Darrow asked the governor to again try to arbitrate the strike. The strikers would not insist on mentioning the WFM in any settlement, but would insist on the right to organize and select representatives. Ferris was skeptical, saying it resembled his earlier rejected proposals: \\"When James MacNaughton says that he will let grass grow in the streets before he will ever treat with the Western Federation of Miners or its representatives, I believe what he says.\\" Moyer countered: \\"I'm not willing to admit yet that James MacNaughton will not recognize organized labor before he dies.\\"Unidentified newspaper clipping in Ferris Scrapbook No. 4, Michigan Historical CollectionsDarrow to Ferris, Sept. 8, 1913, Ferris Records, RG-46, B1, F1 Moyer and Darrow gave Ferris affidavits claiming Waddell men were serving as deputies. He read the telegram he had sent James A. Cruse reminding him of the residency requirement for deputies, and he said: \\"Cruse knows what the law is but in Keweenaw County we have a sheriff that can take care of absolutely nothing. Sheriff Hepping [sic] cannot even take care of his cat.\\" Neither Moyer nor Darrow had criticized Ferris for sending in the militia. Moyer claimed to the governor that almost all \\"of the 16,000 men on strike now belong to the WFM.\\" At Ferris's urging, Darrow accompanied Moyer back to Calumet.  Return to Michigan's Copper district  Moyer returned to the district for a day with Darrow and then went to Chicago to confer with Duncan McDonald of the Illinois division of the United Mine Workers of America about a $100,000 loan. It was approved by the union's executive board and the money was made available in late September. Moyer also obtained a $25,000 loan from the United Brewery Workers of America, and contributions to the WFM's Michigan Defense Fund rose to $18,074 in September.Moyer-McDonald correspondence, WFM Archives, B1, F1-11WFM Michigan Defense Fund LedgersAFL-WNL, Sept. 6, 1913 In mid-September Moyer returned to the district once more, to confer with the Department of Labor investigators. He and John Brown Lennon, AFL treasurer, spoke to a crowd of 2,000 at the Palestra on September 14. Moyer emphasized that any proposal for ending the strike must recognize the WFM.  December of 1913  Tensions grew following the Jane-Dally murders. Special Houghton County Prosecutor George E. Nichols warned Moyer that he would hold him accountable if strikers attacked the Alliance parades. Moyer was said to have acted \\"promptly and creditably in joining with the prosecutor in an effort to prevent anything of that kind.\\" The night before the meetings, Moyer told strikers at Red Jacket to avoid violence, and that the Alliance was looking for any opportunity to make trouble. Organizers Thomas Strizich, Yanko Terzich, Mor Oppman and Ben Goggin translated his message to the strikers. Moyer notified U.S. Representative William Josiah MacDonald and AFL officials that mine operators and the Alliance had announced on December 10 that they would give all representatives of organized labor from outside the state twenty-four hours to leave and that \\"if they fail to do so, they [would] be sent out of the district in a manner most convenient and effective.\\" Moyer urged the AFL to give this the greatest publicity and call it to the immediate attention of President Woodrow Wilson. Moyer also wired Governor Ferris that \\"operators and others, calling themselves law and order citizens, threaten to deport from this district or remove by the quickest possible means of citizens of other states against whom no charges have been made other than that they dare to represent labor.\\" Ferris then advised Nichols at once that \\"citizens must not commit violence on any citizen of Michigan or of any other state . . . protection must be given to all alike.\\" He commanded him to consult with military authorities and to see that peace and dignity were maintained.Rules Committee Hearings, p. 13 Moyer's return to the Michigan copper district in the wake of the Jane-Dally murders marked his fifth trip to the Copper Country during the strike and his first since October. It would be his longest stay. Local newspapers printed names of \\"outside labor agitators\\" still within the district. As the grand jury started its work, Judge Orrin N. Hilton of Denver arrived to reinforce the WFM's legal staff. Moyer, one of the first witnesses before the jury, testified for two days. The jury got possession of the books and records of the Calumet WFM local, but the Ahmeek leaders, alike those over at South Range, claimed that their books had been sent to Denver.Miners' Magazine, January 1, 1914, p. 11Mining Gazette, December 18, 1913 Sheriff Cruse placed notices in the local newspapers reviewing lawlessness, disorder, and intimidation and stating that Moyer had been notified that the right to work must be respected, and that every man who wanted to work would be protected. Law officers appeared to be especially vigilant of activities of the strike leaders. Goggin was \\"run out of Laurium\\" after witnesses identified him as being involved in the beating of Calumet men in Laurium some time previous. On December 10 Judge Patrick Henry O'Brien granted a writ of injunction to WFM attorneys restraining members of the Alliance from interfering with WFM organizers, members, or officers. The Houghton Trades and Labor Council wired Ferris on December 11 saying that it feared bloodshed from the Alliance and asked for an immediate federal investigation of the situation.Labor Council letter in Ferris Records, RG-46, B1.AFL-WNL, December 20, 1913  After the Italian Hall disaster  Moyer was in Hancock, Michigan when he learned by telephone of the Italian Hall disaster,Translations of stories in the Ty√∂mies, extra edition, December 26, and extra edition, December 25, 1913.

Moyer announced that \\"the Western Federation of Miners will bury its own dead . . . the American labor movement will take care of the relatives of the deceased. No aid will be accepted from any of these citizens who a short time ago denounced these people as undesirable citizens.\\"Calumet News, regular and extra additions, December 26, 1913Graham Romeyn Taylor, \\"Moyer's Story of Why He Left the Copper Country\\" (hereafter cited as \\"Moyer's Story\\"), p. 434 The women of the Citizens' Alliance found themselves rejected in home after home. In one household where distress was acute, the family accepted money only to return it the next day. In most of the homes the people said that they had been told to accept aid only from union members. Moyer later denied making such recommendations but the evidence was unmistakable.Detroit Saturday Night, January 10, 1914, clipping in Ferris Scrapbook No. 5, Michigan Historical Collections  \\"Deportation\\"  The Citizens' Alliance relief committee subsequently decided to appeal to Moyer to come before them and explain the situation. Sheriff Cruse rejected that proposal. The feelings at Calumet were running so high that Cruse believed if Moyer \\"appeared there even under my protection he would be lynched.\\" Headlines in the Mining Gazette epitomized the feeling: WHILE COPPER COUNTRY MOURNS FOR ITS DEAD, MOYER TRIED TO MAKE CAPITAL OF DISASTER and USES CHILDREN'S DEATHS TO BENEFIT HIS STRIKE. Cruse telephoned Moyer and arranged for a small committee to meet with him the evening of December 26 in Hancock.

In neurobiology, lateral inhibition is the capacity of an excited neuron to reduce the activity of its neighbors. Lateral inhibition disables the spreading of action potentials from excited neurons to neighboring neurons in the lateral direction. This creates a contrast in stimulation that allows increased sensory perception. It is also referred to as lateral antagonism and occurs primarily in visual processes, but also in tactile, auditory, and even olfactory processing. Cells that utilize lateral inhibition appear primarily in the cerebral cortex and thalamus and make up lateral inhibitory networks (LINs). Artificial lateral inhibition has been incorporated into artificial sensory systems, such as vision chips, hearing systems, and optical mice. An often under-appreciated point is that although lateral inhibition is visualised in a spatial sense, it is also thought to exist in what is known as \\"lateral inhibition across abstract dimensions.\\" This refers to lateral inhibition between neurons that are not adjacent in a spatial sense, but in terms of modality of stimulus. This phenomenon is thought to aid in colour discrimination. History Optical illusion caused by lateral inhibition: the Hermann grid illusion The concept of neural inhibition (in motor systems) was well known to Descartes and his contemporaries. Sensory inhibition in vision was inferred by Ernst Mach in 1865 as depicted in his mach band. Inhibition in single sensory neurons was discovered and investigated starting in 1949 by Haldan K. Hartline when he used logarithms to express the effect of Ganglion receptive fields. His algorithms also help explain the experiment conducted by David H. Hubel and Torsten Wiesel that expressed a variation of sensory processing, including lateral inhibition, within different species. In 1956, Hartline revisited this concept of lateral inhibition in horseshoe crab (Limulus polyphemus) eyes, during an experiment conducted with the aid of Henry G Wagner and Floyd Ratliff. Hartline explored the anatomy of ommatidia in the horseshoe crab because of their similar function and physiological anatomy to photoreceptors in the human eye. Also, they are much larger than photoreceptors in humans, which would make them much easier to observe and record. Hartline contrasted the response signal of the ommatidium when a single concentrated beam of light was directed at one receptor unit as opposed to three surrounding units. He further supported his theory of lateral inhibition as the response signal of one unit was stronger when the surrounding units were not exposed to light. Sensory inhibition A stimulus affecting all three neurons, but which affects B strongest or first, can be sharpened if B sends lateral signals to neighbors A and C not to fire, thereby inhibiting them. Lateral inhibition is used in vision to sharpen signals to the brain (pink arrow). Georg von B√©k√©sy, in his book Sensory Inhibition, explores a wide range of inhibitory phenomena in sensory systems, and interprets them in terms of sharpening. Visual inhibition Lateral inhibition increases the contrast and sharpness in visual response. This phenomenon already occurs in the mammalian retina. In the dark, a small light stimulus will enhance the different photoreceptors (rod cells). The rods in the center of the stimulus will transduce the \\"light\\" signal to the brain, whereas different rods on the outside of the stimulus will send a \\"dark\\" signal to the brain due to lateral inhibition from horizontal cells. This contrast between the light and dark creates a sharper image. (Compare unsharp masking in digital processing). This mechanism also creates the Mach band visual effect. Visual lateral inhibition is the process in which photoreceptor cells aid the brain in perceiving contrast within an image. Electromagnetic light enters the eye by passing through the cornea, pupil, and the lens (optics). It then bypasses the ganglion cells, amacrine cells, bipolar cells, and horizontal cells in order to reach the photoreceptors rod cells which absorb light. The rods become stimulated by the energy from the light and release an excitatory neural signal to the horizontal cells. This excitatory signal, however, will only be transmitted by the rod cells in the center of the ganglion cell receptive field to ganglion cells because horizontal cells respond by sending an inhibitory signal to the neighboring rods to create a balance that allows mammals to perceive more vivid images. The central rod will send the light signals directly to bipolar cells which in turn will relay the signal to the ganglion cells. Amacrine cells also produce lateral inhibition to bipolar cells and ganglion cells to perform various visual computations including image sharpening. The final visual signals will be sent to the thalamus and cerebral cortex, where additional lateral inhibition occurs. Tactile inhibition Sensory information collected by the peripheral nervous system is transmitted to specific areas of the primary somatosensory area in the parietal cortex according to its origin on any given part of the body. For each neuron in the primary somatosensory area, there is a corresponding region of the skin that is stimulated or inhibited by that neuron. The regions that correspond to a location on the somatosensory cortex are mapped by a homonculus. This corresponding region of the skin is referred to as the neuron's receptive field. The most sensitive regions of the body have the greatest representation in any given cortical area, but they also have the smallest receptive fields. The lips, tongue, and fingers are examples of this phenomenon. Each receptive field is composed of two regions: a central excitatory region and a peripheral inhibitory region. One entire receptive field can overlap with other receptive fields, making it difficult to differentiate between stimulation locations, but lateral inhibition helps to reduce that overlap. When an area of the skin is touched, the central excitatory region activates and the peripheral region is inhibited, creating a contrast in sensation and allowing sensory precision. The person can then pinpoint exactly which part of the skin is being touched. In the face of inhibition, only the neurons that are most stimulated and least inhibited will fire, so the firing pattern tends to concentrate at stimulus peaks. This ability becomes less precise as stimulation moves from areas with small receptive fields to larger receptive fields, e.g. moving from the fingertips to the forearm to the upper arm. Auditory inhibition Similarities between sensory processes of the skin and the auditory system suggest lateral inhibition could play a role in auditory processing. The basilar membrane in the cochlea has receptive fields similar to the receptive fields of the skin and eyes. Also, neighboring cells in the auditory cortex have similar specific frequencies that cause them to fire, creating a map of sound frequencies similar to that of the somatosensory cortex. Lateral inhibition in tonotopic channels can be found in the inferior colliculus and at higher levels of auditory processing in the brain. However, the role that lateral inhibition plays in auditory sensation is unclear. Some scientists found that lateral inhibition could play a role in sharpening spatial input patterns and temporal changes in sensation, others propose it plays an important role in processing low or high tones. Lateral inhibition is also thought to play a role in suppressing tinnitus. Tinnitus can occur when damage to the cochlea creates a greater reduction of inhibition than excitation, allowing neurons to become aware of sound without sound actually reaching the ear. If certain sound frequencies that contribute to inhibition more than excitation are produced, tinnitus can be suppressed. Evidence supports findings that high-frequency sounds are best for inhibition and therefore best for reducing some types of tinnitus. In mustached bats, evidence supports the hypothesis that lateral inhibitory processes of the auditory system contribute to improved auditory information processing. Lateral inhibition would occur in the medial and dorsal divisions of the medial geniculate nucleus of mustached bats, along with positive feedback. The exact functions of these regions are unclear, but they do contribute to selective auditory processing responses. These processes could play a role in auditory functioning of other mammals, such as cats. Embryology In embryology, the concept of lateral inhibition has been adapted to describe processes in the development of cell types. Lateral inhibition is described as a part of the Notch signaling pathway, a type of cell‚Äìcell interaction. Specifically, during asymmetric cell division one daughter cell adopts a particular fate that causes it to be copy of the original cell and the other daughter cell is inhibited from becoming a copy. Lateral inhibition is well documented in flies, worms and vertebrates. In all of these organisms, the transmembrane proteins Notch and Delta (or their homologues) have been identified as mediators of the interaction. Research has been more commonly associated with Drosophila, the fruit fly. Neuroblast with slightly more Delta protein on its cell surface will inhibit its neighboring cells from becoming neurons. In flies, frogs, and chicks, Delta is found in those cells that will become neurons, while Notch is elevated in those cells that become the glial cells.

Burroughs. The final book of the trilogy that begins with Cities of the Red Night (1981) and continues with The Place of Dead Roads (1983), its title refers to the western bank of the Nile River, which in Egyptian mythology is the Land of the Dead. Inspired by the Egyptian Book of the Dead, Burroughs explores the after-death state by means of dream scenarios, hallucinatory passages, talismanic magic, occultism, superstition, and his characteristic view of the nature of reality. Summary The prose shifts back and forth between Burroughs' characters and episodes clearly drawn from his own life. Autobiographical scenes include vignettes where Burroughs takes out evidence of amphetamine prescription bottles his mother gave him to sink with a large stone at the bottom of Lake Worth, Florida. The bottles were evidence his mother found in her grandson's, Burroughs' own son's, bedroom. While Burroughs is ankle deep in the water, his aged mother is stalling police investigators in her home. The novel also dives backwards into ancient history, giving the plot a perspective on death that attempts to transcend Christian theology. Burroughs acknowledges being inspired by Norman Mailer's Ancient Evenings, a 1983 novel about ancient Egypt set a thousand years before Christianity. Nevertheless, there are references to contemporary culture; for instance, Mick Jagger appears in some episodes.  Reception  Despite the narrative challenge of the historical framework, the novel is often regarded as Burroughs' best late work and a gratifying culminating episode of the Cities trilogy. According to The Guardian, it is his best work after Naked Lunch (1959).Guardian Unlimited. \\"Books\\" William S. Burroughs. The Guardian and Media Limited 2007. (Accessed 12 May 2007). In his review for The New York Times, the novelist Jonathan Baumbach labels The Western Lands as \\"not an easy work to like\\" and \\"offers us a vision that is viscerally unpleasant and often repellent\\", yet he finds the work to be a success and holds the trilogy to be \\"a comic meditation on death\\". Both Baumbach and Burroughs' biographer Ted Morgan emphasize that Burroughs, in the guise of various characters, is trying to \\"write his way out of death\\". Recording Bill Laswell's band Material collaborated with Burroughs to produce the 1989 album Seven Souls, wherein Burroughs recites passages exclusively from this book to musical accompaniment. The album was reissued in 1997 with three bonus remixes. In 1998, an additional unreleased six remixes (plus one previously released) were introduced on the album The Road To The Western Lands.

In Hawaiian, it is one of two species known as ahi, the other being yellowfin tuna. Bigeye tuna are found in the open waters of all tropical and temperate oceans, but not the Mediterranean Sea. Description Bigeye tuna can grow up to 250 centimetre (98 inches) or 8 feet, in length. Maximum weight of individuals probably exceeds , with the all-tackle angling record standing at . They are large, deep-bodied, streamlined fish with large heads and eyes. The pectoral fins are very long, reaching back beyond the start of the second dorsal fin in juveniles and the space between the first and second dorsal fin in adults. They have 13 or 14 dorsal spines. Physiology Bigeye tuna have a unique physiology which allows them to forage in deeper colder waters and tolerate oxygen-poor waters. Bigeye tuna are reported to tolerate ambient oxygen levels of 1.0 ml/L and routinely reach depths where ambient oxygen content is below 1.5 ml/L, largely due to the presence of blood with a high oxygen affinity. Vascular counter-current heat exchangers maintain body temperatures above ambient water temperature. These heat exchangers are engaged to conserve heat in deeper colder waters and are disengaged to allow rapid warming as the tuna ascend from cold water into warmer surface waters, providing short-latency, physiological thermoregulation. The eyes of bigeye tuna are well developed and with a large spherical lens allowing their vision to function well in low light conditions. Life history Conventional tagging data and counts of growth increments in otoliths (ear bones) of bigeye tuna have recorded a maximum age of 16 years. Recorded lengths at which sexual maturity is attained varies geographically with a length at which 50% of fishes sampled are mature of 135 cm in the eastern Pacific Ocean and 102‚Äì105 cm in the western Pacific Ocean. This translates to an age of maturity of 2 ‚Äì 4 years. Differences in methods of studies may contribute to this variability. Spawning takes place across most months of the year in tropical regions of the Pacific Ocean, becoming seasonal at higher latitudes when sea surface temperatures are above 24 ¬∞C. In the northwestern tropical Atlantic spawning occurs in June and July, and in January and February in the Gulf of Guinea, which is the only known Atlantic nursery area. Behavior=Vertical movement Bigeye tuna undertake a distinct diel shift in vertical behaviour, generally descending at dawn to deeper, cooler waters and returning to shallower, warmer waters at dusk. During the day they can undertake vertical movements into waters of 300‚Äì500 m depth that can be as much as 20 ¬∞C cooler than surface waters. Individuals undertake thermoregulatory behaviour whilst at depth, periodically returning from deeper, cooler waters to shallower, warmer waters to re-warm. Across the Pacific Ocean the depths at which bigeye tuna spend the majority of their time during the day vary: in the eastern Pacific the majority of time is spent at 200‚Äì350 m; around Hawaii the majority of time is spent at 300‚Äì400 m and in the Coral Sea the majority of time is spent at 300‚Äì500 m. These suggest that bigeye tuna (or their prey) are tracking an optimum temperature (10-15 ¬∞C) which is shallower in the eastern Pacific Ocean than in the western Pacific Ocean. The diel shift in the vertical behaviour of bigeye tuna has been suggested to be associated with the diel migration of their prey. This is supported by the identification of a number of diurnally migrating species from the stomachs of bigeye tuna and observations of close associations between bigeye tuna and the sound scattering layer both during the day and at night. Typical vertical behaviour of bigeye tuna shifts when fish associate with seamounts, buoys and fish aggregating devices, with individuals remaining in surface waters. Association with objects has been observed to occur over periods of approximately 10‚Äì30 days. This associative behaviour of bigeye tuna (and also other species of tuna) is taken advantage of by fisheries with approximately 27% of all catches of tunas by purse seine vessels in the western and central Pacific Ocean derived from fish aggregating devices. Migration Results from tagging studies show that bigeye tuna are capable of traversing ocean basins, but can also show a high degree of site fidelity to some regions. One study suggested an annual migration influenced by water temperature, specifically that near the surface. Central Pacific bigeye migrate from subtropical waters in September to tropical waters in March. The fish also briefly travel outside these thermal ranges. Other data indicate similar Pacific-wide variations. Diet Bigeye tuna primarily feed on epipelagic and mesopelagic fish, crustaceans and cephalopods. Commercial fishery Bigeye tuna caught with three-pole one-line rig. Globally, approximately 450,500 metric tonnes of bigeye tuna were caught by commercial vessels in 2012. Commercial fisheries for bigeye tuna are regionally managed within the Pacific Ocean by the Western and Central Pacific Fisheries Commission (WCPFC) and the Inter-American Tropical Tuna Commission (IATTC). In the Indian Ocean catches are managed by the Indian Ocean Tuna Commission (IOTC) and in the Atlantic Ocean by the International Commission for the Conservation of Atlantic Tunas (ICCAT). Regular stock assessments are carried out for bigeye tuna by each of the regional fisheries management organisations with bigeye tuna currently regarded as overfished in the western and central Pacific Ocean and eastern Pacific Ocean, close to or being overfished in the Atlantic Ocean and not overfished in the Indian Ocean. The majority of commercial catches across the Pacific Ocean is by purse seine fleets, while catches are dominated by longline fleets in the Indian and Atlantic Oceans. Various conservation measures have been introduced by the regional fisheries management organisations which apply to particular sized vessels and fleets and include measures such as spatial and temporal closures, trip duration limits, observer requirements and limits on catches File:Fishermen with bigeye tuna.jpg Fishermen with bigeye tuna File:Bigeye tuna on ice.jpg On ice Threats The bigeye tuna catch rates have also declined abruptly during the past half century, mostly due to increased industrial fisheries, with the ocean warming adding further stress to the fish species. Research indicates that increasing ocean temperatures are taking a toll on the tuna in the Indian Ocean, where rapid warming of the ocean has resulted in a reduction of marine phytoplankton. Conservation Most seafood sustainability guides encourage consumption of other types of tuna. In 2010, Greenpeace International added bigeye tuna to its seafood red list. \\"The Greenpeace International seafood red list is a list of fish that are commonly sold in supermarkets around the world, and which have a very high risk of being sourced from unsustainable fisheries.\\"Greenpeace International Seafood Red list NotesReferences *National Marine Fisheries Service, 'Atlantic Bigeye Tuna' *Atlantic bigeye tuna NOAA FishWatch *Pacific bigeye tuna NOAA FishWatch *ScienceDaily (Dec. 3, 2007), 'Turning A Blind Eye To Bigeye Tuna' * * Tony Ayling & Geoffrey Cox, Collins Guide to the Sea Fishes of New Zealand, (William Collins Publishers Ltd., Auckland, New Zealand 1982) * Clover, Charles. 2004.

It was under development as drug candidate for female sexual dysfunction and erectile dysfunction but clinical development ceased by 2003, and as of 2018, no product containing melanotan II was marketed and all commercial development had ceased. Unlicensed, untested, or fraudulent products sold as \\"melanotan II\\" are found on the Internet, and purported to be effective as \\"tanning drugs\\", though side effects such as uneven pigmentation (it makes your already uneven pigmentation more noticeable, doesn‚Äôt create new ones), new nevi (moles), and darkening or enlargement of existing moles have been reported and have led to medical authorities discouraging use. There is no scientific study behind the long term & permanent side effects this peptide causes. Mechanism of action Melanotan II acts as a non-selective agonist of the melanocortin receptors MC1, MC3, MC4, and MC5. To the extent that melanotan II produces melanogenesis, this is thought to be caused by activation of the MC1 receptor, whereas its clinically documented sexual effects are thought to be related to its ability to activate the MC4 receptor (though the MC3 is thought to possibly also be involved). Other effects of melanotan II, mostly regarded as adverse effects, include flushing, nausea, vomiting, stretching, yawning, and loss of appetite (the last via activation of MC4). History Research in the early 1960s showed that in rats, administration of Œ±-MSH caused sexual arousal, and work on this continued in many labs up through the 1980s, when scientists at University of Arizona began attempting to develop Œ±-MSH and analogs as potential sunless tanning agents, and synthesized and tested several analogs, including melanotan-I and melanotan II. Very early in the process one of the scientists, who was conducting experiments on himself with an early tool compound, melanotan II, injected himself with twice the dose he intended and got an eight-hour erection, along with nausea and vomiting. To pursue the tanning agent, melanotan-I (now known as afamelanotide) was licensed by Competitive Technologies, a technology transfer company operating on behalf of University of Arizona, to an Australian startup called Epitan, which changed its name to Clinuvel in 2006. To pursue the sexual dysfunction agent, melanotan-II was licensed by Competitive Technologies to Palatin Technologies. Palatin ceased development of melanotan-II in 2000 and synthesized, patented, and began to develop bremelanotide, a likely metabolite of melanotan-II that differs from melanotan-II in that it has a hydroxyl group where melanotan-II has an amide. Competitive Technologies sued Palatin for breach of contract and to try to claim ownership of bremelanotide; the parties settled in 2008 with Palatin retaining rights to bremelanotide, returning rights to melanotan-II to Competitive Technologies, and paying $800,000. Bremelanotide was approved for use in the United States by the Food and Drug Administration (FDA) in June 2019 under the brand name Vyleesi to treat hypoactive sexual desire disorder (HSDD). Society and culture A number of products are sold online and in gyms and beauty salons as \\"melanotan\\" or \\"melanotan-1\\" or \\"melanotan-2\\" in their marketing. The unregulated products are not legal to be sold for human usage in any jurisdiction. Starting in 2007 health agencies in various countries began issuing warnings against their use.

History The monastery was founded in 1186 by monks from the Cistercian abbey of Loccum on a site given to them by Adolf III, Count of Schauenburg and Holstein. The Cistercians particularly sought wild and desolate sites for their monastic houses, and the site at Reinfeld, then consisting of marshy depressions along the valley of the Heilsau, met this requirement exactly: the foundation charter refers to it as a locus horroris (\\"place of horror\\"). The first community consisted of an abbot, Hartmann, and 12 monks. During their clearance and draining of the swampy ground, the monks dug out a large number of ponds, later used for fish (especially carp), some of which remain to this day. The monastery, once established, became prosperous, and acquired many estates. The community built up a close relationship with the city of L√ºbeck, and the abbot was permitted his own gate in the city walls. With the approach of the Reformation, however, the relationship collapsed: the citizens of L√ºbeck stormed and burnt the abbey in 1534, and although it was re-built, in 1582 it was dissolved, and its assets taken over by the King of Denmark. The buildings were demolished. The site was later used for the construction of a castle, which was itself demolished in 1775, and the stone quarried for other buildings. Little now remains on the site, apart from the fishponds.

Adrian Evans (d. 1992), a structural engineer and the car's designer, built a series of cars called Davrian from 1965, based on components from the Hillman Imp, including the front and rear suspension, the aluminium alloy Hillman Imp engine which was Coventry Climax-based and the Imp transaxle. Davrian 1965‚Äì83 In 1967, the design had settled to a 2-seat glass fibre monocoque coup√©, officially called the Davrian Imp and series production started with a company being formed called Davrian Developments. The cars were sold in kit form. Over time, a variety of power units were offered including the Mini-engined Davrian Demon (mid-mounted), Volkswagen Beetle Type 1 (rear-mounted), Renault (rear-mounted) and Ford Fiesta (mid-mounted). The car weighed in at 8 cwt or 4oo kgs ] Rear view of a 1970 Davrian Mk. V Over the years, a series of improvements led the cars to go through Marks 1 to 8. They proved very popular in amateur hands as rally and circuit racing cars. In 1980, the Mk8 was offered as a complete car called the Davrian Dragon. This was mid-engined and used Ford Fiesta components and engine. The company was insufficiently capitalised for this operation, and went into receivership in 1983. This car was subsequently relaunched as the Corry and the earlier more basic versions continued being made in the same premises but under new ownership as the Darrian. Corry 1983‚Äì85 The rights to the Dragon were bought by Will Corry and production transferred to Lisburn, Northern Ireland, to be built by the newly founded Corry Car Company. The body was restyled by Tony Stevens and the name changed to the Corry Cultra. Ford engines and were used and the suspension was based on that of the Mk III Cortina. The cars were mostly sold for competition use, but a few road-going versions were made. Darrian 1986 onwards The Darrian was a revival of the original Davrian in the old factory. The body was considerably modified and the car became mid-engined. Like the Davrian, the Darrian is built using a glass-fibre composite monocoque body construction. The engine was usually from a Ford, but the Rover V8 or Vauxhall 16-valve units were options. In 1996, Swansea Institute Team Darrian (SITD) took outright honours in the Privilege Insurance British GT Championship.http://www.darrian.co.uk/history.html The company also built a limited number of replicas of the Renault Alpine A110 rally car, known as the Monte Carlo MC220 Berlinette. Now based in Llangybi, near Lampeter and owned by Tim Duffee, Darrians continue to be built and raced with great success, performing many giant-killing acts. The current model is the Darrian T90GTR, usually fitted with the Millington 2.5 16v 4-cylinder racing engine producing 300BHP, mated to a Hewland transaxle.

The most behaviorally sophisticated of the insect societies are found among the ants, termites, bees, and wasps. While these insects are technically classified as eusocial insects they are commonly referred to simply as the social insects. In this scheme of classification, other non-eusocial, gregarious species of insects are referred to as presocial, subsocial, quasisocial, or in some other manner that has the unfortunate consequence of suggesting that are not quite social. Yet a significant number of insect species that do not possess the defining criteria of eusociality are by any other standard of classification clearly social and it is in this sense of the term, that employed by zoologists in general, that larval aggregates of moths, butterflies and sawflies are considered social insects. The sibling societies of caterpillars exhibit collective behaviors that vary from simple interactions to more complex forms of cooperation. Collective and cooperative foraging Social caterpillars exhibit three basic foraging patterns. Patch-restricted foragers obtain all of the food required during the social phase of their larval development from the leaves found in a single contiguous patch or from several such closely spaced patches. The foraging arena is typically well defined by a protective silk envelope or by leaves bound together. On large trees, patches usually consist of the leaves found on a part of a branch, an entire branch, or on several closely situated branches. But on small trees and herbaceous plants the entire host may eventually be enveloped. Although there have been no surveys to determine the proportion of social caterpillars that exhibit each of these foraging patterns, patch-restricted foraging is probably the most common and also the least complex. Well known examples of patch restricted foragers include the Euonymus caterpillar, Yponomeuta cagnagella and the ugly nest caterpillar, Archips cerasivoranus. The fall webworm Hyphantria cunea, is a patch restricted forager during the initial stages of its development. Nomadic foragers establish only temporary resting sites and make frequent moves from one patch to another. The forest tent caterpillar, Malacosoma disstria and the spiny elm caterpillar, Nymphalis antiopa are nomadic foragers. Central-place foragers construct a permanent or semi-permanent shelter from which they launch intermittent forays to distant sites in search of food. Between bouts of feeding the caterpillars rest at the shelter. The best known of the social caterpillars that are central place foragers include the tent caterpillars other than M. disstria, and the processionary caterpillars of Europe (Thaumetopoea) and Australia (Ochrogaster), and the Madrone caterpillars of Mexico. The most sophisticated form of cooperative foraging exhibited by caterpillars is recruitment communication in which caterpillars recruit siblings to their trails and to their food-finds by marking pathways with pheromones much in the manner of ants and termites. The most sophisticated examples of recruitment communication have been described from the tent caterpillars (Malacosoma). Eastern tent caterpillars (M. americanum), for example, utilize a trail-based system of elective recruitment communication that enables the colonies to exploit the most profitable feeding sites. Group defense against predators and parasitoids Aggregation allows caterpillars to collectively defend themselves against the attacks of predators and parasitoids. Such defense may be passive or active. Passive modes of collective defense involve dilution effects since the mathematical probability that any one individual will be randomly singled out by a predator decreases with group size. Individuals also gain protection from predators by surrounding themselves with others. Shelters collectively built by caterpillars play an important role in antipredator defense. The tough silk shell of the nest formed by a colony of E. socialis caterpillars is virtually impregnable to both birds and invertebrate predators. Like many other shelter builders, the resident caterpillars venture from the nest only under the cover of darkness when birds and predatory wasps are inactive. Bound-leaf shelters, and the more loosely spun shelters of the tent caterpillars and the fall webworm, Hyphantria cunea, cannot exclude predators completely but all are likely to be deterred to some degree, providing the residents with greater protection than they would enjoy resting in the open. It is generally thought that aposematic coloration is most effective in deterring predators when insects group together. Indeed, the most common mode of active defense among social caterpillars is aposematic display, often combined with synchronous body rearing, flicking, and ‚Äúen masse‚Äù regurgitation of toxic or unpalatable chemicals. Studies indicate that the spread of alarm through colonies of social caterpillars is mediated largely by tactile and, possibly, visual cues. Caterpillars can detect the airborne sounds generated by the beating wings of flying wasps and flies and respond with rapidly jerking movements. Vibrational signals set up by the agitated caterpillars and propagated by the communal web would appear the most likely means of alerting the colony to danger. Shelter building The preeminent silk-spinners are the lepidopterous caterpillars. Caterpillars spin silk prolifically and in comparison to other non-eusocial insects build large and relatively complex structures from the material. Moreover, they are the only insects outside of the Hymenoptera and Isoptera to exhibit true collective building behavior involving colony-wide synchronization of activity and periodic shelter expansion. Some social caterpillars such as Brassolis isthmia and Archips cervasivoranus employ silk to draw the leaves of their host plants into tightly bound shelters in which they rest between foraging bouts. But the most impressive structures collectively built by caterpillars, such as the remarkable bolsa of the social pierid Eucheira socialis and the tents of the lasiocampid caterpillars, are made exclusively of silk. The communal shelters of caterpillars are multifunctional, serving to facilitate basking and thermoregulation, molting, and antipredator defense. They may also serve as communication centers where hungry caterpillars are recruited to food finds. Little is known of the behavioral mechanisms that give rise to the architecturally distinct, collectively built shelters of caterpillars. Unlike the complex, free-form structures of the eusocial insects, the ultimate shape that the nests of caterpillars take is determined to no small extent by exogenous factors. While colonies may actively select sites prior to the construction of a shelter, or abandon a site that proves inadequate after the shelter-building process has begun, all collectively built caterpillar shelters are formed either by pulling together plant parts or by spinning silk about a framework of branches and leaves. Studies suggest that subtle differences in the intrinsic properties of the silks of caterpillars, or the way they are spun, may be more important than overt differences in larval motor patterns in accounting for interspecific differences in the form of the web-nest. Thermoregulation Many social caterpillars are heliotherms, that is, they elevate their temperature by basking in the sun. Such basking behavior is markedly enhanced by the presence of siblings. Caterpillars that feed at times of the year when air temperatures are low are particularly likely to benefit from aggregative basking. The spring feeding larvae of the nymphalid butterfly Euphydryas aurinia, a non-shelter building species, bask ‚Äúen masse‚Äù in the open, packing their bodies tightly together to minimize convective heat loss. Under high levels of solar radiation on cold days, gregariousness and the darkness of their cuticle enables the larvae to gain temperature excesses (Tbody ‚àí Tambient) as great as 30 ¬∞C. The construction of shelters that trap the heat of the sun enables social species to gain even more control over their body temperature. The extensive shelters of the tent caterpillars (Malacosoma) provide a surface large enough to enable the colony to bask ‚Äúen masse‚Äù and the caterpillars oriented their nests to take full advantage of the sun. The silk walls of the structures are dense enough to serve as barriers to convective heat loss, allowing them to function as miniature glasshouses. When the tents of M. americanum are shielded from the sun the caterpillars are unable to raise their body temperature above the cool ambient temperatures that prevail in the spring and they fail to grow. When tents are exposed to sunlight, their layered structure creates a thermally heterogeneous microhabitat within which the caterpillars can thermoregulate by moving from compartment to compartment. In addition, studies show that caterpillars basking side-by-side in groups on the surface of the tent are able to achieve significantly higher body temperatures, due to boundary layer effects and convective shielding, than solitary caterpillars basking in the open on nearby branches. This behavior is demonstrated by the gregarious caterpillars of Eriogaster lanestris, the small eggar moth. In the absence of a radiant heat source, the body temperature of aggregated social caterpillars may be several degrees Celsius above ambient temperature. This phenomenon was first reported in 1938 in Vanessa caterpillars. Subsequently, other studies showed that the shelter of the pine processionary caterpillar Thaumetopoea pityocampa rose 2 to 3 ¬∞C when occupied by the caterpillars and cooled down when they left the structure to feed. Studies of the social caterpillars of E. lanestris showed that the internal temperature of the nest exceed ambient temperature by as much as 6.7 ¬∞C, though the average temperature gains of 2 to 3 ¬∞C were in line with those reported for other species. These thermal gains reported for these species appear attributable to the trapping of the metabolic heat generated by the caterpillars as they process food. Substrate silking to facilitate steadfastness Caterpillars spin copious quantities of silk as they move over the branches of their host plants. The silk of some species contains a pheromone which channels the movement of the colony as they move from place to place. In other species, a trail pheromone is secreted independently of the silk. In either case, a primary function of the silk appears to be that of enhancing steadfastness as the caterpillars move over the smooth surfaces of the host plant References * Costa, J. T. and N. E.

Challenges in classification for companies A proper classification can save huge amount of money for the company, which is why nowadays importers and exporters strive to find a perfect way to solve those problems: # Variety of products---Companies who do import and export meet challenges of how to classify products with the growing varieties of products. Classification and restrictions, to some extent, has a bad effect on free trading and growing of business. # Risk of loss caused by difference in classification---Firstly, the proper classification of your item is essential to determine any licensing requirements under the Export Administration Regulations(EAR), EU Dual Use Regulation 428/2009. And subsequently exporters and importers need to be aware of how to classify the products accordingly and which category should be classified to. And finally they may be required to obtain a license. A slight difference in classification can mean a huge difference in the duties that are paid.

Variants=Incremental The most basic form of incremental backup consists of identifying, recording and thus, preserving only those files that have changed since the last backup. Since changes are typically low, incremental backups are much smaller and quicker than full backups. For instance, following a full backup on Friday, a Monday backup will contain only those files that changed since Friday. A Tuesday backup contains only those files that changed since Monday, and so on. A full restoration of data will naturally be slower, since all increments must be restored. Should any one of the copies created fail, including the first (full), restoration will be incomplete. A Unix example would be: rsync -e ssh -va --link- dest=$dst/hourly.1 $remoteserver:$remotepath $dst/hourly.0 The use of rsync's \`--link-dest\` option is what makes this command an example of incremental backup. Multilevel incremental A more sophisticated incremental backup scheme involves multiple numbered backup levels. A full backup is level 0. A level n backup will back up everything that has changed since the most recent level n-1 backup. Suppose for instance that a level 0 backup was taken on a Sunday. A level 1 backup taken on Monday would include only changes made since Sunday. A level 2 backup taken on Tuesday would include only changes made since Monday. A level 3 backup taken on Wednesday would include only changes made since Tuesday. If a level 2 backup was taken on Thursday, it would include all changes made since Monday because Monday was the most recent level n-1 backup. Reverse incremental An incremental backup of the changes made between two instances of a mirror is called a reverse incremental. By applying a reverse incremental to a mirror, the result will be a previous version of the mirror. In other words, after the initial full backup, each successive incremental backup applies the changes to the previous full, creating a new synthetic full backup every time, while maintaining the ability to revert to previous versions. The main advantage of this type of backup is a more efficient recovery process, since the most recent version of the data (which is the most frequently restored version) is a (synthetic) full backup, and no incrementals need to be applied to it during its restoration. Reverse incremental backup works for both tapes and disks, but in practice tends to work better with disks. Companies using the reverse incremental backup method include Intronis and Zetta.net. Incremental forever This style is similar to the synthetic backup concept. After an initial full backup, only the incremental backups are sent to a centralized backup system. This server keeps track of all the increments and sends the proper data back to the client during restores. This can be implemented by sending each incremental directly to tape as it is taken and then refactoring the tapes as necessary. If enough disk space is available, an online mirror can be maintained along with previous incremental changes so that the current or older versions of the systems being backed up can be restored. This is a suitable method in the case of banking systems. In modern cloud architectures, or disk to disk backup scenarios, this is much simpler. Data is broken into chunks and placed on a cloud storage system. Metadata about the chunks is stored in a persistent system, which allows the system to assemble a point in time backup from these chunks at restore time. There is no need to refactor tape. Block-level incremental This method backs up only the blocks within the file that changed. This requires a higher level of integration between the sender and receiver. Byte-level incremental These backup technologies are similar to the \\"block-level incremental\\" backup method; however, the byte (or binary) incremental backup method is based on a binary variation of the files compared to the previous backup: while the block-based technologies work with heavy changing units (blocks of 8K, 4K or 1K), the byte-based technologies work with the minimum unit, saving space when reflecting a change on a file. Another important difference is that they work independently on the file system. At the moment, these are the technologies that achieve the highest relative compression of the data, turning into a great advantage for the security copies carried out through the Internet. Other backup types=Synthetic full backup A synthetic backup is an alternative method of creating full backups. Instead of reading and backing up data directly from the disk, it will synthesize the data from the previous full backup (either a regular full backup for the first backup, or the previous synthetic full backup) and the periodic incremental backups. As only the incremental backups read data from the disk, these are the only files that need to be transferred during offsite replication. This greatly reduces the bandwidth needed for offsite replication. Synthetic backup does not always work with the same efficiency. The rate of data uploaded from the target machine to data, synchronized on the storage, varies depending on the disk fragmentation. Differential A differential backup is a cumulative backup of all changes made since the last full or normal backup, i.e., the differences since the last full backup. The advantage to this is the quicker recovery time, requiring only a full backup and the last differential backup to restore the system. The disadvantage is that for each day elapsed since the last full backup, more data needs to be backed up, especially if a significant proportion of the data has changed. Forward incremental-forever A forward incremental-forever backup allows the synthetic operation to create a new full backup, which is limited to the size of the incremental file, instead of the complete size of a full backup file as it would happen in a ‚Äúforward mode with synthetic fulls‚Äù. The overall consumed I/O is the same as the reversed incremental, but during the duration of the backup activity only 1 write I/O is used and the snapshot of the VM is opened for less time than the reversed incremental; the remaining 2 I/O are used to update the full backup file.

Background  Nooke was born in Forst (Lausitz), Germany, a small town in Brandenburg. He grew up there only 150 km (90 mi) southeast of Berlin, in the communist German Democratic Republic (GDR), near the Polish border. He was educated in Forst, Cottbus and at the University of Leipzig, where he studied physics from 1980 to 1985. After graduating Nooke worked as a research assistant, latterly as a head of section from 1985 to 1990 at the industrial hygiene inspectorate in Cottbus. He is married to sociologist Maria Nooke. They have three children.  Political career  Since 1987, Nooke had been a member of a church opposition group and got involved in the growing democracy movement in 1989, which led to the fall of the Berlin Wall. Following the first (and only) democratic election in the GDR, he became Member of the People's Chamber for the opposition group named Alliance 90. From 1990, to 1994 Nooke was a member of the parliament of the state of Brandenburg and was the chairman of the parliamentary group of Alliance 90. In 1996, he joined the CDU with other former civil rights activists. From 1998 to 2005 Nooke was a member of the German Bundestag, deputy chairman (2000‚Äì2002) and spokesperson for cultural and media affairs (2002‚Äì2005) of the CDU/CSU parliamentary group.  Positions in the German government  On March 8, 2006, Nooke was appointed as the Federal Commissioner for Human Rights Policy and Humanitarian Aid in the government of Chancellor Angela Merkel. He was succeeded in this office by Markus L√∂ning in 2010. Since April 2010, Nooke has been serving as Personal Representative of the German Chancellor for Africa in the Federal Ministry of Economic Cooperation and Development (BMZ), under the leadership of ministers Dirk Niebel (2009-2013) and Gerd M√ºller (since 2013).  Controversy  In a 2018 interview with German tabloid BZ, Nooke made a number of allegations that were later criticised as racist and neo-colonial, such as the suggestion that colonialism was beneficial for Africa and that the hot and humid climate was responsible for a lower work productivity amongst Africans; he also suggested African states should lease their land to a foreign entity such as the World Bank to \\"allow free development for 50 years\\" implying that it was solely the incompetence and corruption of African heads of state that were responsible for the death of jobs and opportunities in many African states. His suggestion was widely criticised as reeking of neo-colonialism by academics and journalists. In the ensuing controversy, Nooke allegedly threatened to dismiss a non-tenured faculty member of the University of Hamburg, Raja Kramer, who had served as the voluntary head of a German association of Africa scientists (Fachverbands Afrikanistik).

He was Editor-in-chief of the English daily Balochistan Express (Quetta), The Guardian (Karachi) an Urdu daily Azadi, and the English Weekly Express, (Quetta). He also regularly contributed columns to Dawn, and was an authority on Balochistan's social, political and economic matters. Personal life Balouch was born in the suburb of Lyari, in Pakistan's 'business capital' Karachi, but migrated to Quetta, Balochistan in 1990. He advocated for 'freedom of expression' and, over the years, has spoken openly against dictatorship and bans on the media. When the Pakistan Electronic Media Regulatory Authority (PEMRA) Ordinance was amended in November 2007 by President Pervez Musharraf, placing curbs on the media, Balouch told Weekly Pulse: > PEMRA ordinance is a bid to muffle the right to freedom of expression and > voice of truth. But this voice cannot be stifled in the present age. All the > steps being taken by the incumbent unconstitutional and illegal rulers are > alien to constitution. The way the media and civil society members are > raising voice against it is laudable. He followed the religion of Islam, and was thus a Muslim. Education Balouch attended a neighbourhood primary school in Karachi. He sat his Matriculation examination from the famous Sindh Madrasatul Islam School, in 1959. He joined SM College in 1961, from where he graduated in 1964. Balouch had a master's degree in Economics, which he was awarded in 1966 from the University of Karachi. Politics Balouch took an active part in politics from an early age. As a student, he was elected as the President of the Students' Union at the SM College from 1963‚Äì1964. He had been an active member of the left-wing National Students Federation [NSF], and participated in the Anti-One Unit movement, as well as a campaign against three-year degree courses. He was also one of the founding members of the Baloch Students Organization [BSO], when it was established in 1962, and became its senior vice president in 1966. Balouch was affiliated with the National Awami Party [NAP] and served as Press Secretary to NAP's Ghouse Bux Bizenjo, the then Governor of Balochistan, for four months, between 1972 ‚Äì 1973. When the NAP government was dismissed by President Zulfiqar Ali Bhutto on the alleged charge of implication in the infamous Hyderabad Conspiracy, Balouch was jailed for five years, and released only when Bhutto's government was overthrown by General Zia ul Haq. In August 2008, he accompanied Prime Minister Gillani on a three-day visit to Sri Lanka. When the Pakistan Peoples Party (PPP) government returned to power in February 2008, Balouch was among the leaders who welcomed it, chiefly because new President Asif Ali Zardari was a Baloch, and he had 'defeated a dictator with his political might.' However, he also said that the challenges ahead for the PPP in Balochistan were tough, and that a complete end to military operation and provision of space to all political stakeholders was the only real solution. Journalism Balouch joined Pakistan's oldest and most widely circulated newspaper, Dawn, as its sub- editor in 1966, and worked there in different capacities for 28 years. In 1981, he was elected as President of the Karachi Union of Journalists [KJU]. He took an active part in the freedom of expression movement, and served two terms. He was also elected as President of the Balochistan Newspapers Editors Council, and as a Vice-President of the Karachi Press Club. Over the years, Balouch had written for the Daily Balochistan Express, and also served the Council of Pakistan Newspapers Editors [CPNE] as its Balochistan Vice President. He is one of the most widely quoted journalists by the Pakistani and International media on Balochistan-related issues. He had extensively travelled as a part of his journalistic activities. He was the editor of the Balochistan Express, and publishes an Urdu paper called Azadi [Liberty]. As an author Balouch had authored a book on the politics and economy of Balochistan, titled A Critical Comment on the Political Economy of Balochistan, which was released in January 2004, in a ceremony organised by literary organisation, Daira.

Design  The S-MX was based on the S-MX Concept model first exhibited at the 31st Tokyo Motor Show in 1995, and was similar in appearance to the larger Honda Stepwgn, shortened substantially in length and height. Whereas the Stepwgn had three rows of seating to accommodate eight passengers the smaller S-MX has two rows of seating for four or five passengers. In order to maximize space for passengers the S-MX uses a front bench seat and a column shifter for the four-speed automatic transmission (the only available transmission). The S-MX was powered by a 2.0 L version of Honda's B-series engine featuring double overhead camshafts and four valves per cylinder; it did not use Honda's VTEC system. Peak power output was at 5,500 rpm and peak torque was at 4,200 rpm. This engine was shared with the Honda CR-V and Honda Stepwagon compact crossover. Similar to the CR-V and Stepwagon, the S-MX was available with front-wheel-drive or optional four-wheel-drive. As part of a September 1999 facelift, the engine was upgraded to produce and at the same engine speeds. As was customary of minivans of the time the S-MX features only one (conventional) rear door on the passenger (left) side of the vehicle. Ostensibly this feature was for the safety of passengers, to prevent them from stepping out into traffic. All chassis codes start with RH1 for the Base model and Lowdown (Lowdown is also printed on the chassis plate). All 4WD models have chassis codes starting with RH2.

The chatra in various traditions According to Hindu mythology, it is the emblem of Varuna, also considered an embodiment of kingship. Chatra is also a deity, yidam and ishta-devata. In various Dharmic traditions it is an accoutrement of chakravartin. A number of deities are depicted with chatra, and they include Revanta, Surya, and Vishnu (in his Vamana avatar). The chatra is cordoned amongst the symbols that approach universality within the numerous octavalent suites or sets of Ashtamangala, e.g., in the Digambar Jain tradition, and the Vajrayana tradition. In Dharmic tradition iconography, traditional Tibetan medicine thangkas and Ayurvedic diagrams, the chatra is uniformly represented as the Sahasrara. In Vajrayana Buddhism, the umbrella or parasol is included in the 'Eight Auspicious Signs' or Ashtamangala. The chhatra shares a similar symbolic value to the baldachin, refer image of Vishvakarman.

Retrieved on 2014-06-04. The building was interdicted in 2006 for restoration works and was delivered after seven years on October 23, 2013. History In the nineteenth century, concerns about the hygienic conditions of food marketing created the need to build public markets in several cities, such as Manaus. According to records of the time, the name \\"Adolpho Lisboa\\" is the same name of the mayor who administered the city of Manaus in that period. The central pavilion was inaugurated, on July 15, 1883, by the president of the Province, Jos√© Paranagu√°, at a time when the city of Manaus was experiencing the rubber boom. The market was built in Art Nouveau style, following the characteristics of the old market Les Halles, of Paris, France. Around 1908, an iron pavilion was built for the commercialization, in that time of Amazonian spices, of which it had kerosene lighting and following the same architectural style of the main building. From that time the main building was dated, being a shed of approximately 45 meters of length and 42 meters of width, constructed with iron structure. The structure is supported by 28 columns, being the parapets where these lean, and the two side rooms, in masonry of stone and brick. The side rooms have twenty \\"boxes\\", separated from each other, by iron grills each having wooden counters, with marble top. In 1890, two other equally sized side pavilions (sheds) were built, also with iron structures and zinc roofs. Structure The market is divided into two pavilions, the first and oldest is made of masonry, the second is composed of iron, the Amazon region at that time had an almost unexplored soil and an insufficient amount of raw material, this motivated the importation almost all materials of the building from Europe, as was the second pavilion which had the entire structure built by Walter Macfarlane of Glasgow.

It explores the intellectual development of its protagonist, a young Roman of integrity, in his pursuit of a congenial religion or philosophy at a time of change and uncertainty that Pater likened to his own era.Pater, Marius the Epicurean, Chapter XVI The narration is third-person, slanted from Marius's point of view, added to which are various interpolated discourses, ranging from adaptations of classical and early Christian writings to Marius‚Äôs diary and authorial comment.  Plot summary  Cupid and Psyche by Fran√ßois-Edouard Picot (1817). Pater's much-admired translation of Apuleius's 'Cupid and Psyche' is one of the interpolated texts in Marius the Epicurean Marius, a sensitive only child of a patrician family, growing up near Luna in rural Etruria, is impressed by the traditions and rituals of the ancestral religion of the Lares, by his natural surroundings, and by a boyhood visit to a sanctuary of Aesculapius. His childhood ends with the death of his mother (he had early lost his father) and with his departure for boarding school in Pisae. As a youth he is befriended by and falls under the influence of a brilliant, hedonistic older boy, Flavianus, who awakens in him a love of literature (the two read with delight the story of Cupid and Psyche in Apuleius, and Pater in due course makes Flavian, who is \\"an ardent student of words, of the literary art\\",Pater, Marius the Epicurean, Chapter VI the author of the Pervigilium Veneris). Flavian falls ill during the Festival of Isis and Marius tends him during his long death-agony (end of 'Part the First'). Grown to manhood, Marius now embraces the philosophy of the 'flux' of Heraclitus and the Epicureanism (or Cyrenaicism) of Aristippus. He journeys to Rome (166 AD), encountering by chance on the way a blithesome young knight, Cornelius, who becomes a friend. Marius explores Rome in awe, and, \\"as a youth of great attainments in Greek letters and philosophy\\",Pater, Marius the Epicurean, Chapter XIII is appointed amanuensis to the Emperor Marcus Aurelius. Aurelius's Meditations on Stoicism and on Plato, and the public lectures of the rhetorician Fronto, open Marius' eyes to the narrowness of Epicureanism.Pater, Marius the Epicurean, Chapter XVI ('Second Thoughts') Aurelius's indifference, however, to the cruelty to animals in the amphitheatre, and later to the torments inflicted on people there, causes Marius to question the values of Stoicism (end of 'Part the Second'). Disillusioned with Rome and the imperial court which seem \\"like some stifling forest of bronze-work, transformed as if by malign enchantment out of the living trees\\",Pater, Marius the Epicurean, Chapter XXI puzzled by the source of Cornelius's serenity, still Epicurean by temperament but seeking a more satisfying life-philosophy, Marius makes repeated visits alone to the Campagna and Alban Hills, on one occasion experiencing in the Sabine Hills a sort of spiritual \\"epiphany\\" on a perfect day of peace and beauty (end of 'Part the Third'). Later he is taken by Cornelius to a household in the Campagna centred on a charismatic young widow, Cecilia, where prevails an atmosphere of peace and love, gradually revealing itself as a new religion with liturgy and rituals that appeal aesthetically and emotionally to Marius. The sense of purposeful community there, set against the persecution of Christians by the authorities and the competing philosophical systems in Rome, contributes to Marius' mood of isolation and emotional failure. Overshadowed by thoughts of mortality he revisits home and pays his respects to the family dead, burying their funerary urns, and sets out again for Rome in Cornelius's company. On the way the two are arrested as part of a sweep of suspected Christians. It emerges that only one of the young men is of this sect, and Marius, unbeknown to Cornelius, makes their captors believe it is he. Cornelius is set free, deceived into thinking that Marius will follow shortly. The latter endures hardship and exhaustion as he journeys captive towards Rome, falls ill, and dying is abandoned by his captors. \\"Had there been one to listen just then,\\" Pater comments, \\"there would have come, from the very depth of his desolation, an eloquent utterance at last, on the irony of men's fates, on the singular accidents of life and death.\\" Pater, Marius the Epicurean, Chapter XXVIII Marius is tended in his last days by some poor country people, secret believers who take him to be one of their own. Though he has shown little interest in the doctrines of the new faith and dies more or less in ignorance of them, he is nevertheless, Pater implies, \\"a soul naturally Christian\\" (anima naturaliter christiana Tertullian, Apol. 17) and he finds peace in his final hours as he reviews his life: \\"He would try to fix his mind on all the persons he had loved in life, dead or living, grateful for his love or not. In the bare sense of having loved he seemed to find that on which his soul might 'assuredly rest and depend'. ... And again, as of old, the sense of gratitude seemed to bring with it the sense also of a living person at his side\\" (end of 'Part the Fourth').  Themes  Marcus Aurelius and members of the Imperial family offer sacrifice at the Temple of Jupiter Capitolinus, in gratitude for success against Germanic tribes - an episode described in Marius Marius the Epicurean explores a theme central to Pater's thinking and already examined in his earlier Imaginary Portrait 'The Child in the House' (1878): the importance to the adult personality of formative childhood experiences. In addition, conscious of his growing influence and aware that the ‚ÄòConclusion‚Äô to his Studies in the History of the Renaissance (1873) had been misconstrued as amoral, Pater set about clarifying his published ideas. As he states in the third edition of The Renaissance (1888), Marius the Epicurean \\"deal[s] more fully with thoughts suggested by\\" the 'Conclusion'.Pater, The Renaissance (1888 edition), 'Conclusion', footnote In particular Pater is careful in the novel to distinguish between 'hedonism', as usually understood, and Marius's cerebral, ascetic version of Epicureanism:Pater, Marius the Epicurean, Chapter IX ('New Cyrenaicism') :\\"How little I myself really need,\\" (runs Marius' diary Pater, Marius the Epicurean, Chapter XXV) \\"when people leave me alone, with the intellectual powers at work serenely. The drops of falling water, a few wild flowers with their priceless fragrance, a few tufts even of half-dead leaves, changing colour in the quiet of a room that has but light and shadow in it ...\\" Marius' quest exemplifies Pater's dictum that we should \\"be for ever testing new opinions, never acquiescing in a facile orthodoxy\\":Pater, The Renaissance, 'Conclusion' :\\"Liberty of soul, freedom from all partial doctrine which does but relieve one element of our experience at the cost of another, freedom from all embarrassment alike of regret for the past and calculation for the future: this would be but the preliminary to the real business of education ‚Äì insight, insight through culture into all that the present moment holds in trust for us, as we stand so briefly in its presence.\\" Pater, Marius the Epicurean, Chapter VIII (italics added) Thus the novel elaborates Pater's ideal of the aesthetic life ‚Äì a life based on Œ±·º¥œÉŒ∏Œ∑œÉŒπœÇ, sensation, perception ‚Äì and his theory of the stimulating effect of the pursuit of sensation and insight as an ideal in itself. Centrally, Marius dedicates much time, and Pater much space, to examining the Meditations and character of Marcus Aurelius, who was warmly admired in the 19th century (by Niebuhr, Matthew Arnold, Renan, George Long and many othersWalter Pater, Marius the Epicurean, ed. Ian Small (Oxford, 1986), Introduction pp.ix-xi; Walter Pater, Marius the Epicurean, ed. Michael Levey (Harmondsworth, 1985), Introduction pp.23-24) as a paragon of intellectual and moral virtue, but whose Stoicism Marius ultimately finds too bleak and lacking in compassion.Pater, Marius the Epicurean, Chapter XVIII The Sabine Hills, scene of Marius's epiphany (painting by Thomas Cole, 1846) The appeal of religion ‚Äì whether ancestral paganism or primitive Christianity ‚Äì is another major theme of the novel. Indeed the novel's opening and closing episodes betray Pater's continuing nostalgia for the atmosphere, ritual and community of the religious faith he himself had lost. Michael Levey, a biographer and editor of Pater, writes: \\"Pater is able to depict an early, pure Christianity, not yet sectarian, authoritarian, or established, which offers Marius a vision which is ideal because untarnished.\\" Walter Pater, Marius the Epicurean, ed. Michael Levey (Harmondsworth, 1985), Introduction p.17 Early Christianity, Pater notes, \\"had adopted many of the graces of pagan feeling and pagan custom ... So much of what Marius had valued most in the old world seemed to be under renewal and further promotion\\".Pater, Marius the Epicurean, Chapter XXII Marius, however, having outgrown his childhood piety, dies before he has engaged intellectually with the doctrines of the new faith. He remains essentially Epicurean: :\\"For still, in a shadowy world, his deeper wisdom had ever been, with a sense of economy, with a jealous estimate of gain and loss, to use life, not as the means to some problematic end, but, as far as might be, from dying hour to dying hour, an end in itself ‚Äì a kind of music, all-sufficing to the duly trained ear, even as it died out on the air.\\" Pater, Marius the Epicurean, Chapter XXVIII His epiphany in the Sabine Hills, where he sensed a \\"divine companion\\" and the existence of a Platonic \\"Eternal Reason\\" or Cosmic Mind, is not a prelude to religious faith, though it continues to comfort him. Some readers take the novel at face value, as a conversion narrative;A. C. Benson, Walter Pater (London, 1906), Ch.IV; Gilbert Highet, The Classical Tradition: Greek and Roman Influences on Western Literature (Oxford, 1949) others may feel that Pater makes it hard for them to believe that Marius, with his acute, probing, restless mind, would have embraced Christian doctrines if he had examined them. Instead the novel remains open-ended, leaving us with a provisional ideal of 'aesthetic humanism' while bringing Marius, intuitively if not intellectually, to a Christian end.Walter Pater, Marius the Epicurean, ed. Harold Bloom (New York, 1970), Introduction, p.xiii  Publishing history  Marius was favourably reviewed and sold well; a second edition with minor revisions came out in the same year (November 1885). For the third edition (1892) Pater made extensive stylistic revisions, this version being reprinted regularly until the early 1930s. An edition with introduction and notes by Anne Kimball Tuell was published by Macmillan, Pater's original publishers, in New York in 1929. Two further scholarly editions were published in the mid-1980s to mark the novel's centenary (see Editions below).  Critical reception  In an early review in Macmillan's Magazine the novelist Mary Ward praised \\"the great psychological interest\\" of the book, but identified as a weakness its tendency to depict Christianity from an aesthetic viewpoint, rather than presenting it as life's ultimate truth and reality.Walter Pater, Marius the Epicurean, ed. Michael Levey (Harmondsworth, 1985), Introduction, p.12 T. S. Eliot, with his Stoic and Christian sympathies, concurred in his influential 1930 essay.T. S. Eliot, 'Arnold and Pater', Selected Essays (London, 1932) More recently William F. Shuter has noted that \\"the lack of curiosity exhibited by Marius as to what was actually believed by the Christian community to which he is so strongly drawn\\" matched Pater's own lack of curiosity;William F. Shuter, Rereading Walter Pater (Cambridge, 1997), p.103 ['Cambridge Studies in Nineteenth-Century Literature and Culture' series] it contrasts strongly with Marius' (and Pater's) keen interest in philosophy. Harold Bloom writes, \\"Pater evaded the novel's ultimate problem by killing off Marius before the young man grasps the theological and moral exclusiveness of Christianity. Marius could not remain Marius and renounce [Epicureanism]. Whether Pater earns the structural irony of the novel's concluding pages, as a still-pagan Marius dies a sanctified Christian death, is legitimately questionable.\\" Walter Pater, Marius the Epicurean, ed. Harold Bloom (New York, 1970), Introduction, p.xvi Nevertheless Bloom praises Pater's integrity in his handling of Marius's epiphany in the Sabine Hills: \\"The self knows that it is joined to no immortal soul, yet now believes also that its own integrity can be at one with the system of forces outside it. By de- idealising the epiphany, Pater makes it available to the coming age.\\" Harold Bloom, ed., Selected Writings of Walter Pater (New York, 1974), Introduction p.xv  Literary significance  As well as being of interest to students of Pater's ideas and personality (Marius's diary in Chapter XXV has a Montaigne- like candour unusual for Pater) Marius the Epicurean is of interest as \\"one of the more remarkable fictional experiments of the late nineteenth century\\".Walter Pater, Marius the Epicurean, ed. Harold Bloom (New York, 1970), Introduction, p.x Pater's interspersing of narrative with classical and historical texts ‚Äì borrowings acknowledged and unacknowledged, translations and adaptations ‚Äì makes Marius the Epicurean an early example of a novel enriched by intertextuality. These fragments cover a range of discourses ‚Äì narrative within narrative (from Apuleius), oration (by Fronto), formal dialogue (an abridgement of Lucian's Hermotimus), letters (Eusebius) ‚Äì which, taken with other metafictional devices ‚Äì the comparative lack of plot, action, characterisation, time-line and dialogue ‚Äì make the novel \\"look forward beyond its century to modern works of fiction\\".Walter Pater, Marius the Epicurean, ed. Michael Levey (Harmondsworth, 1985), Introduction p.8  Trilogy  Pater conceived Marius as the first of \\"a trilogy of works of similar character, dealing with the same problems under altered historical conditions\\".Evans, Lawrence (ed.), Letters of Walter Pater(Oxford, 1970), letter 28 Jan. 1886 He began work on the second novel, Gaston de Latour, set in turbulent late 16th- century France, shortly after finishing Marius, but it remained unfinished at his death. In 1896 Pater's friend and literary executor, Charles Lancelot Shadwell, edited and published seven chapters of Gaston; in 1995 Gerald Monsman published Gaston de Latour: The Revised Text, re-editing the seven chapters and editing the remaining six which Shadwell had withheld as too unfinished.Monsman, Gerald, Gaston de Latour: The Revised Text (Greensboro, 1995) \\"Through the imaginary portrait of Gaston and Gaston's historical contemporaries ‚Äì Ronsard, Montaigne, Bruno, Queen Marguerite, King Henry III ‚Äì Pater's fantasia confronts and admonishes the Yellow Nineties, Oscar Wilde not least.\\"Monsman, Gerald, Gaston de Latour: The Revised Text (Greensboro, 1995), dustjacket quotation In an 1891 review of The Picture of Dorian Gray in The Bookman, Pater had disapproved of Wilde's distortion of Epicureanism: \\"A true Epicureanism aims at a complete though harmonious development of man's entire organism. To lose the moral sense therefore, for instance the sense of sin and righteousness, as Mr. Wilde's heroes are bent on doing so speedily, as completely as they can, is ... to become less complex, to pass from a higher to a lower degree of development.\\"Pater, Walter, 'A Novel by Mr Oscar Wilde', The Bookman, 1, Nov. 1891, pp.59-60; reprinted in Walter Pater: Sketches and Reviews (1919) Though unfinished, Gaston throws light on Pater's intentions in Marius, as well as further developing his experimental technique: \\"Dramatic action is filtered by memory, ideas, and multiple perspectives,\\" writes Monsman, \\"dissolved so radically that the fictional protagonist seems almost to be reading about the age in which he lived.\\"Monsman, Gerald, Gaston de Latour: The Revised Text (Greensboro, 1995), Introduction, p.xl The third novel in the trilogy was to have been set in England in the late 18th century.Levey, Michael, The Case of Walter Pater (London, 1978), p.190  Editions  * Walter Pater, Marius the Epicurean, ed.

National Hydrography Dataset high- resolution flowline data. The National Map, accessed May 13, 2011 river in the U.S. state of Kentucky that drains . It begins near Parksville, Kentucky, rising from the north slope of Persimmon Knob south of KY 300 between Alum Springs and Wilsonville, and ends at the Ohio River near West Point. Taylorsville Lake is formed from the Salt River, and Guist Creek Lake is also in its drainage basin. Annual flooding swells the normally quiet waters to a rapidly flooding torrent, especially along the Rolling Fork, which runs largely along the base of steep, shaly knobs that mark the boundary between the Pennyroyal Region (a Mississippian limestone plateau) to the west and south and the Outer Bluegrass. (See the Ohio River flood of 1937 at Louisville, for an example.) The Taylorsville Lake Dam, built in the early 1970s, has tamed the worst of the floods and changed the nature of the river downstream. Some flooding still occurs, especially near the Brashears Creek confluence at Taylorsville, but it is primarily back flow from the Ohio. The river receives the most rain in the month of May and the least in September, according to data from the local National Weather Service office. Dams were proposed on the Rolling Fork at Howardstown and on the Beech Fork at Campground, but were not deemed economically feasible. These two tributaries are marked on maps as the Rolling Fork River and the Beech Fork River. A tributary of the Beech Fork, the Chaplin River, rises near the source of the Salt. Wildlife The Salt River has areas protected by the Nature Conservancy because of several rare creatures and plants. The flood waters created rich bottom lands and support a variety of wetland habitats. Turtles, fish, waterfowl abound, deer, river otters and beaver are some of the typical animals living in the area. However some not so common animals live in the area like the Indiana bat, gray bat, fanshell, and Louisville (Knob Creek) crawfish.Nature.com - Kentucky - Salt River/Rolling Fork Conservancy In addition to the animals, there are several rare or unique plants that live in the area. These include Carex crawei (Crawe's sedge), Cypripedium candidum (small white lady's-slipper), Leavenworthia exigua var. laciniata (glade cress), Sporobolus heterolepis (Prairie dropseed), Symphyotrichum pratense (silky aster), and Viola egglestonii (Eggleston's violet). Geology The river has a drainage area and is the fifth largest watershed in the state.Kleber, John E. The Encyclopedia of Louisville (University Press of Kentucky) page 784 The terrain around much of the river is deeply ridged until it nears its outlet at the Ohio, near West Point. The river itself is roughly above sea level.Groundwater Resources in Kentucky - Salt River The shallow river valley is above sea level, but there are usually steep hillsides that climb quickly to elevations at , a common ground level in the central Kentucky area. This creates areas of flat topped ridges separated by narrow valleys or \\"hollows,\\" often washed out by small creeks or streams draining into the river. Flash floods are common in these narrow valleys, and they complicate travel between ridges, often requiring a circuitous path. It was not uncommon for folks in the valley and folks on the ridge-tops to see each other infrequently. The Salt River in Bullitt County contains class I rapids and is .River Facts.com - Kentucky Whitewater Salt River On cool mornings, fog fills the valley floor, stabilizing and cooling the temperature, while on the ridge, it may be hot and dry. Tobacco, corn and soybeans do well in the lower fields, even while droughts parched the drier, hotter ridges. History Major General Don Carlos Buell's army crossing the Salt River from the Harper's Weekly in October 1862 The river received its name from the Bullitt's Lick settlement that was founded at an animal salt lick in 1779 by Henry Crist. The river has been used for navigation and sustenance since humans occupied the area. Old Indian artifacts are found along the length of the river valley by farmers and new construction work in the area. Log cabins and settlements grew on the banks, using it as a source of water, power and transportation. The river bank flats and water made travel over through the ridged terrain easier. During the American Civil War, an earth-walled fort was established on a tall hill overlooking the Ohio, near the Salt River. It guarded passage through Louisville and south on the road along the Ohio River, which much later became known as the Dixie Highway. It also protected against Southern forces attacking from the Ohio River and up the Salt River. Fort Duffield may be the best-preserved earthen Civil War fort in America and illustrates how important river access via the Salt River and the Ohio was to early travelers. In 1983 the U.S. Army Corps of Engineers completed a dam on the river just above Taylorsville, forming Taylorsville Lake. Economy During early settlements, high water was used to ship timber and local product down stream to the Ohio River. In quieter waters, small boats came upstream, helping settlers move goods to remote farms. It also flooded towns like Taylorsville, Shepherdsville, and to a lesser extent southern Louisville and West Point, changing their architecture and growth pattern. A number of mills used to dot the length of the Salt River and its tributaries, using the water to grind feed and flour, saw lumber and more. These include those of Bullitt's Lick and Bell's Mill on Floyd's Fork. The Salt River was a primary water source for a number of towns and farms. Taylorsville, Mount Washington and Shepherdsville all used to draw water from the river until water lines were extended from Louisville.

The neighborhood is located in the borough of Lerkendal. The area hosts the campus for the faculties of social sciences and humanities of the Norwegian University of Science and Technology (NTNU). Until the 1996 creation of NTNU, it was the social sciences and humanities campus of the Norwegian College of General Sciences. History The barn which burned down in 1981 Farm The site was traditionally a farm. The historic name of Dragvoll has varied, variously being written Draghaull (1519), Dragouldt (1570), Drauold (1621), Dragwoll (1667) and Dragvoll (1723). The first part is derived from the site being located on a creek, Stokkbekken, with the latter being a voll.Grendahl: 23 The earliest records of the farm have it registered with the king owning half and the pastor of Our Lady's Church with the other half. The first known farmer was Joon Draguol and his wife, Ingeborg, in 1645. The farm was privatized between 1661 and 1683. Kaspar Widthagen's odelsrett was registered in 1683. By 1701 it had passed to Wilhelm Sebastian With, who owned but did not run the farm, as he was working as a pastor in Trondheim.Grendahl: 24 The farm continued to be owned by non-farmers. Melcher Br√∏dicher bought the farm in 1727 and it was subsequently owned by Anche Bennickmand, Fredrich Fabich, Charles Omilus Lutzow, Reimer Ulfers, Morten Simonsen Hoff, who in 1774 sold it to Fredrik Christian von Krabbe, who two years later sold it to Johanna Nikolava Ulfers. She kept it until it was transferred to Reiner Ulfers. It then was transferred to M. Spechman in 1839, Engelbright Thun in 1850, Gustav Olsen in 1870, Jacob H√∏e in 1876 and Arnt Clemmetsen Grendahl in 1881. At the time of the last transaction most of the crofts had been split off and the farm retained of fields plus forest and meadows. The ultimate farmhouse was built around 1800 as a tr√∏nderl√•n. It had received a renovation, with a new interior, but with a faithful reproduction of the exterior. The barn is traditionally dated to 1848, although this may not be accurate. Its foundation may date as far back as the Middle Ages.Grendahl: 28 The stable dates from 1938. The farm was bought by the state for use for the university in 1964. In 1981 a group of youth broke into the barn and lit a bondfire. The fire spread to the building and it burned down. A week later the medieval foundations were demolished, in violation with their restriction as being preserved.Grendahl: 29 University Internal view of the Dragvoll campus During the 1960s Norway experienced a period with massive expansion in several areas, including higher education. One of these processes was the establishment of a university in Trondheim. The Ministry of Education and Research contacted the County Governor of S√∏r-Tr√∏ndelag to find a suitable site for a campus. The main concern at the time was to create room for future freedom of expansion.Eriksen: 25 The Norwegian Institute of Technology was at the time the largest educational institution in Trondheim and was estimating that it would need a further of space to expand at Gl√∏shaugen in the following decade.Eriksen: 26 Four main criteria were used to determine the location: a best possible location in relation, especially related to natural surroundings, sufficient land for future expansion, flexible land for campus design, and sufficient land for auxiliary installations, such as parks, sports venues, student housing etcetera.Eriksen: 27 Dragvoll met these criteria. It also allowed the endowed land to be used for agriculture until it was needed for future expansions. The plans and approval of a university were passed by the Parliament of Norway in 1968.

Jenkins that starts the Left Behind series. This book and others in the series give narrative form to a specific eschatological reading of the Christian Bible, particularly the Book of Revelation inspired by dispensationalism and premillennialism. It was released on Sunday, December 31, 1995. The events take place the day of the Rapture and the two weeks following. Plot introduction The story takes place during the Rapture. Millions of people suddenly vanish and frantic \\"survivors\\" of the disappearances begin their search for their friends and families, as well as answers to what has happened. Among them are pilot Rayford Steele, his daughter Chloe Steele and Cameron \\"Buck\\" Williams, and pastor Bruce Barnes, who begin to discover that the Rapture has taken place. Meanwhile, Buck follows an unknown, but charming, Romanian politician named Nicolae Carpathia, who quickly attracts millions of followers - seemingly overnight. Characters * Rayford Steele - The protagonist. 747 captain for Pan- Continental in his mid-forties. He is member, but non-attender, at New Hope Village Church in Mount Prospect, Illinois. * Chloe Steele, Rayford's daughter, who is a student at Stanford University in her early-twenties and skeptical of Christianity. She lost her mother and brother in the Rapture. Chloe resides in California. * Cameron \\"Buck\\" Williams - journalist and senior writer for Global Weekly in New York City who writes the \\"Newsmaker of the Year\\" story on Chaim Rosenzweig. * Bruce Barnes - assistant pastor in his mid- forties at New Hope Village Church who must lead a new congregation. * Joshua Todd-Cothran - international financier, head of the London Stock Exchange, dies in this book. * Jonathan Stonagal - international financier and wealthiest man in history, dies in this book. * Ken Ritz - charter pilot * Chaim Rosenzweig - Israeli botanist and statesman who discovers a formula that makes Israeli deserts bloom; former Global Weekly Man of the Year. * Dirk Burton, Informant, dies in this book * Alan Tompkins, Scotland Yard detective, dies in this book * Steve Plank - publisher of the Global Weekly and old school journalist; Cameron's boss. * Hattie Durham - Senior flight attendant for Pan-Continental Airlines. * Nicolae Carpathia - President of Romania * Stanton Bailey - Publisher of Global Weekly * Mwangati Ngumo, of Botswana, Secretary-General of the United Nations until Nicolae Carpathia takes over * Eric Miller, journalist/writer at Seaboard, dies in this book * Marge Potter, secretary at Global Weekly in New York * Carolyn Miller, Eric Miller's wife * Scott M. Otterness, UN Security Major themes Christian tribulation theory is played out in a context around the theme of the \\"Rapture\\", based on the First Epistle to the Thessalonians. Amongst those who believe there will be a Rapture, there are three main theories on the timing of this event: Pre- Tribulation, Mid-Tribulation, and Post-Tribulation. This book takes the Pre- Tribulation Rapture position. The story is built around such End times themes as the Second Coming, the Antichrist, the Tribulation, and the expected coming Millennium of Messiah. Reception This novel has received a wide range of reactions. The American Evangelical Christian community in general has approved the idea of representing in a worldly language the end times theology. Jerry Falwell said: \\"In terms of its impact on Christianity, it's probably greater than that of any other book in modern times, outside the Bible.\\"Time magazine. Accessed 2007-9-8 Nonreligious reviewers and reviewers with differing religious viewpoints have typically given it unfavorable reviews. The New York Times stated in an article that, \\"The formula combines Tom Clancy-like suspense with touches of romance, high-tech flash and Biblical references.\\" The Chicago Tribune called it \\"...an exciting, stay-up-late-into- the-night, page turner story.\\" Publishers Weekly called Left Behind \\"...the most successful Christian Fiction series ever.\\" A review in the Washington Post called the novels a \\"stodgily written blend of B-movie science fantasy and horror.\\" A review from the Biblical Discernment Ministries claims that, \\"The fictionalizing of Scripture is an egregious offense in and of itself, but the theology presented in the books is intolerable.\\" Controversies and criticisms Some evangelicals object to the message of Left Behind because they say it is not a Christian message, though framed as a Christian series. Loren L. Johns, the Academic Dean of the Associated Mennonite Biblical Seminary, writes: \\"At the end of the day, this series is ultimately a rejection of the good news of Jesus Christ. I say this because it rejects the way of the cross and Jesus‚Äô call to obedient discipleship and a new way of life. It celebrates the human will to power, putting Evangelical Christians in the heroic role of God‚Äôs Green Berets. ... Love of enemies is treated as a misguided strategy associated not with the gospel, but with the Antichrist.\\" The Commission on Theology and Church Relations of the Lutheran Church‚ÄìMissouri Synod reported that \\"the ideas expressed in the Left Behind series are in many ways contrary to the teaching of holy scripture. Though containing a fictional story line, the books promote a theology that is, in important respects, at odds with the biblical revelation.\\" The interpretation of Revelation, as presented in the Left Behind series, also appears to encourage a highly individualistic approach to salvation that eschews responsibility for performing good deeds or missionizing: ‚ÄúBecause, in the novels, those who take the mark of the beast cannot be saved, saving oneself and punishing one's enemies are the only viable courses of action for believers‚Ä¶ Working toward social justice is not necessary and might even distract believers from their steadfast focus on their own salvation and the salvation of their family, friends or community.‚Äù (824-5) According to Kilde and Forbes, the books promotes a violent context for viewing and resolving social problems, one in which the only solution to social problems is to kill those who engage in any practices considered by the authors as \\"evil\\". While both the authors and the publisher have claimed that thousands of readers have experienced a Christian conversion due to the novels, scholars such as Frykholm have been unable to document even a single case in which a reader experienced a Christian conversion. When Frykholm requested evidence of conversion from the publisher, Tyndale submitted only seven cases; four were reportedly hearsay and three were reportedly readers that had reaffirmed their lapsed faith in Christianity. Film adaptations This book has been adapted into a feature film, Left Behind: The Movie, first released on video and DVD, and then to cinemas where it fared poorly.Imdb.com: Left Behind (2004) - Box Office/Business In the movie, Cameron \\"Buck\\" Williams was played by former Growing Pains star Kirk Cameron, who said he finds the series inspiring; he is a practicing evangelist and co-host with Ray Comfort on the TV show The Way of the Master. To date, two sequels have been released straight to video - Left Behind II: Tribulation Force and Left Behind: World at War, the latter of which premiered in churches before its video and DVD release. A fourth installment was announced by Cloud Ten Pictures in 2006, but the development has been placed on hold since the July 2008 settlement of a lawsuit over rights involving the first three films.cloudtenpictures.com In August 2008, a website revealed that LaHaye plans to remake the series and possibly turn all twelve (or sixteen) novels into feature film adaptations.christiancinema.com In October 2014, the second Left Behind remake, starring Nicolas Cage, was released to universally negative critical reviews.

The book takes up where the War of Souls left off. This trilogy will explore the Chaos that is post-war Krynn. It is authored by Margaret Weis, who was a co-founder of the Dragonlance series, along with Tracy Hickman. This is Weis's fourteenth novel in the series, and first solo hardcover since the publication of the extremely popular Dragonlance title The Soulforge in 1998. Publication history Amber and Ashes was written by Margaret Weis and published in July 2005. Other books in the series include Amber and Iron (Volume 2) and Amber and Blood (Volume 3). Plot introduction Amber and Ashes is set in Krynn shortly after the death of Takhisis at the end of the War of Souls. Magic is back, and so are the gods. But the gods are vying for supremacy, and the war has caused widespread misery, uprooting entire nations and changing the balance of power on Ansalon. The mysterious warrior-woman Mina, brooding on her failure and the loss of her goddess, makes a pact with evil in a seductive guise. As a strange vampiric cult spreads throughout the fragile world, unlikely heroes‚Äîa wayward monk and a kender who can communicate with the dead‚Äîjoin forces to try to uproot the cause of the growing evil. It begins with Chemosh talking to himself in an abandoned temple about his plans to rule the pantheon and obtaining living servants as opposed to the dead. Shortly after, Mina and Galdar are seen. Mina is grieving the death of Takhisis and is about to kill herself when Chemosh intervenes and makes her his lover. It is then that the plot to create the Beloved of Chemosh begins. Characters *Rhys Mason - Rhys Mason was a monk of Majere, who has lived his life in an isolated monastery. Rhys's brother, Lleu, a Beloved of Chemosh, is brought by Rhys's parents to the monastery in the hopes that the monks will help set Lleu back on the righteous path. Instead, Lleu poisons all of the monks and his parents during dinner. The only person not poisoned is Rhys, because he does not go to the meal but is outside meditating. Rhys discovers the deaths and is appalled that Majere allowed his worshippers to be killed without lending aid. Rhys is approached by the goddess Zeboim in her attempt to thwart the plans of Chemosh. Rhys agrees to follow her, but never seems to fully embrace her as his god. *Atta - Rhys's closest companion is his dog, Atta, who he trained to shepherd sheep while at the monastery. He noticed that Atta was able to tell that something was not right about Lleu at the monastery. Now, with the assistance of the kender Nightshade, who is able to speak to the dead, the three are searching for Rhys's brother and Mina, the High Priestess of Chemosh. Atta proves to be as skilled a kender herder as she was with sheep. *Lleu Mason - Lleu was a cleric of Kiri-Jolith who is seduced by Mina, the High Priestess of Chemosh. Lleu agrees to worship Chemosh and becomes the first of the Beloved of Chemosh. After killing the monks at the Majere monastery, Lleu is pursued by Rhys, Atta and Nightshade. *Nightshade - Nightshade is a kender nightstalker. As a nightstalker, Nightshade has the ability to speak with the dead as well as cast certain, mystical spells. He is not the normal kender, often not following the common kender instincts to seek adventure or ‚Äúborrow‚Äù from others - although he is kept in line by Atta, who is acts as his ‚Äúsheep dog.‚Äù *Mina - High Priestess of Chemosh, she was originally introduced in the War of Souls trilogy, where she led the armies of the One God (now known to be the goddess Takhisis). After Mina buries Takhisis under a mountain, she starts to feel that her life is useless and contemplated suicide. Galdar, a minotaur and her second-in-command during the War of Souls, tries to comfort her, but soon Sargonnas comes and transports Galdar back to the minotaur homeland to help fight against the elves. Soon, Chemosh comes for her, and she expects to die. However, Chemosh didn't come for her death, but for her life. Soon she is entranced by the handsome Chemosh, and agrees to become his High Priestess. She goes around the world converting people to Chemosh. *Chemosh - the god of death, it the driving immortal force behind the events in Amber and Ashes. Growing tired of being worshiped by the elderly and decrepit, Chemosh concocts a plan to draw younger, attractive worshipers to him. He uses Mina to gain converts by giving her the power to grant all those who declare their loyalty to him, unending life and youth. These undying worshipers are called the Beloved of Chemosh. A Beloved of Chemosh is really a dead person who doesn't realize that they are dead. Instead, they travel through the world, unable to be killed, and looking to create more Beloveds. **Krell - Ausric Krell was a Knight of Takhisis serving under the late Dragon Highlord Ariakan. Historically, Krell is known, as the Betrayer for the hand that he played in Ariakan's death. As punishment, Zeboim, Ariakan's mother, imprisoned him on Storm's Keep, a former island stronghold for the Knights of Takhisis during the Chaos Wars. There she repeatedly tortured and killed the knight, eventually turning him into a death knight. He is rescued by Mina, who tricks Zeboim and forces him to work for Chemosh. *Zeboim - A god of darkness, who has control over the sea, Zeboim forces Rhys to serve her, after Rhys feels that Majere has abandoned him and his fellow monks. *Majere - A god of light, also known as the Mantis God, Majere is the god that Rhys used to worship before Rhys forsook him. *Beloved of Chemosh - A new vampire-like 'race' created to spread the worship of Chemosh to the young and beautiful. Seducing the living with promises of immortality and invincibility, these undead kill by kissing the heart of their victims. They appear as the living, breathing, eating, drinking, etc., but are mere shells of their former selves. Over time they lose their identities, becoming nearly invincible and insatiable killers, filled only with the desire to spread their curse.

Regarded as Malaysia's first theme park, it opened in 1975 and closed down permanently in May 1994, after a landslide damaged the property. The entrance gate and remains of Mimaland still exist today. History Mimaland started operating in 1975. The name Mimaland is actually an acronym of the word combination Malaysia In Miniature Land. Mimaland was built on a hilly area of 300 acres in Ulu Gombak near Kuala Lumpur, served by an exit to the old Gombak-Bentong road. It was owned by Mimaland Berhad, a member of Magnum Group of Companies (now Magnum Corporation). Mimaland's construction was done in phases and the theme park was opened in stages. Mimaland's first phase was completed in 1970, and consisted of 24 motels, 5 chalets and a swimming pool. Among the main attractions, was the 'prehistoric animal park' containing dinosaur models of a very impressive size. Additionally, Mimaland also had a lake for boating and fishing activities, a 'giant maze', as well as a cross-forest area. In January 1993, a 27-year-old Singaporean was killed while using the giant slide at the Mimaland pool. The incident shocked the public and resulted in a temporary closure of Mimaland. After improvement was done to the giant slide, Mimaland was reopened. However, a minor landslide caused damage to the walls of the same pool in May 1994. This incident caused muddy water to seep into the pool, causing the area to close to the public. Several parties, including government agencies, took the management of Mimaland to court on a number of offenses, among which were security control issues. As a result, the court barred Mimaland from continuing its operations. Mimaland was closed permanently in 1994. Mimaland relics still exist to this day.

The Jet was the automaker's response to the popular Nash Rambler and the costs of developing and marketing the Jet ultimately led to Hudson's merger with Nash. Background The Hudson Motor Car Company was one of several independent firms competing with the much larger Big Three U.S. automakers (General Motors, Ford, and Chrysler) that produced mainly \\"standard\\" large-sized models. Hudson had limited financial resources, and management decided to develop a compact-sized model instead of refurbishing its line of full-size cars and developing a V8 engine. The Hudson Jet had exclusive engineering that included a roomy, comfortable, and solid welded unibody, as well as featuring excellent performance for the era along with good fuel economy and low cost maintenance. The Jet was introduced in the middle of the 1953 model year and achieved some success in the crowded compact segment. However, Hudson was unable to foresee the dramatic decline in overall compact car sales during the 1952-1954 period which already included three other makes. As a result, they were only able to produce a little more than 20,000 units for the 1953 model year. It was a car with no real vices, but it effectively destroyed the Hudson Motor Car Company. Consequently, the company was forced to merge with Nash- Kelvinator (forming American Motors Corporation) because of the losses resulting from the Jet project and the falling sales of Hudson's senior line. Development issues The initial inspiration for the new small Hudson car was the 1950 Fiat 1400 sedan. Early clay models of Hudson's new compact car carried the name \\"Bee\\" in keeping with the automaker's Wasp and Hornet models. From the beginning, the Jet project was hampered by Hudson President A.E. Barit, 63 years old in 1953, who disregarded the suggestions of the company's stylists and other advisors. For example, Barit insisted that the compact- sized Jet offer full-size car amenities. While designers attempted to form a car that was lower, wider, and proportionally sleeker to the dimensions of a smaller compact car, Barit would not back away from features such as chair high seating for passengers, and a \\"tall\\" greenhouse with a ceiling that would allow riders to wear their hats while in the car. Barit also decided that the Jet's rear design would incorporate Oldsmobile-like high rear fender and small round tail light design. The design was further changed to accommodate the personal likes of Chicago, Illinois Hudson dealer Jim Moran, whose dealership became number one sales outlet for Hudson, accounting for about 5% of Hudson's total production. Moran fancied the 1952 Ford's wrap around rear window and roofline, and Barit ordered a similar design for the Jet. The final result was that the Jet's styling closely mimicked the larger 1952-1954 Ford in many respects. The strong unitized Monobuilt bodies for the Jet were produced by the Murray Corporation of America of Detroit. One of the reasons for outsourcing the production of bodies \\"was that Murray agreed to amortize the tooling costs over the production run, reducing the upfront investment\\" making the Jet possible because Hudson did not have enough resources to pay for the tooling costs. The new small car was powered by Hudson's new inline L-head straight-six engine that produced at 4000 rpm and of torque at 1600 rpm. Early Studebaker body development mule vehicles suffered damage because the engine produced so much torque. A \\"Twin-H power\\" version with two 1-bbl downdraft carburetors, aluminum cylinder head, and 8.0:1 compression ratio producing was optional. This was more power than available from the standard Ford, Chevrolet, or Plymouth engines at that time. The engine was a reengineered version of Hudson's 1932 \\"3x4.5\\" I8, less two cylinders, de-stroked and configured for full-pressure lubrication. It was a flathead design at a time when the rest of the industry was moving to overhead valves. 1953 The Hudson Jet was unveiled in December 1952 at the Hotel Astor in New York City. Hudson was the only make fully committed to stock car racing, so both the founder of NASCAR, Bill France, Sr., and Hudson driver, Tim Flock, the Grand National champion, participated. For the 1953 model year, the Jet was the only new nameplate among the domestic automakers. In its introductory year, the Jet was available in either Standard or Super-Jet trim levels, with two- and four-door sedan body styles. Unlike the fastback \\"step-down\\" bodied Hudson full-size cars, the Jet was designed as a three-box notchback. Hudson Jet interiors were well trimmed and equipped When the Jet emerged for its introduction, it competed with the Henry J, Nash Rambler, and Willys Aero. It was shorter than the Henry J and the Willys Aero, as well as the narrowest and tallest of all four giving the Jet \\"a boxy look\\". Kiplinger's Personal Finance magazine noted that the Jet has \\"much to recommend it\\" including \\"riding qualities [which] match more expensive models\\", good visibility, quiet operation, and more power than its competition for \\"excellent pickup and a high top speed\\". With its optional \\"Twin-H power\\", the Jet had more horsepower than any standard engine in the regular-sized Fords, Chevrolets, and Plymouth lines. While the 1953 senior Hudsons continued to be based upon the 1948 step- down design, these cars looked sleeker than the smaller, slab-sided Jet models. Unlike the Nash Rambler, which offered premium body styles such as a station wagon, hardtop, and convertible, the Jet was available only in sedan form. Although the Hudson Jet had an advantage by being well appointed, it was priced higher than base-level full-sized Chevrolet, Ford, and Plymouth sedans. Standard equipment was at a high level for an automobile of this era. These features included a heater, theft-proof locks, rotary door-latches, defroster vents, dual horns, full-wheel covers, ashtray, and a lighted ignition switch that were typical extras on the competing makes. While the inclusion of a passenger compartment heater as standard may be unusual to present day car users, even the high-priced Cadillac still counted a passenger compartment heater as extra in 1953, at an option cost of US$199. Total production in the U.S for the 1953 model year was 21,143. The tea cup test Hudson resorted to a variety of marketing ploys to get consumers interested in the Jet, including the \\"Tea Cup Test\\". This fuel economy test utilized special kits comprising a glass cylinder, valves and rubber hoses that Hudson dealers attached to test cars. The glass cylinder was mounted to the inside of the front passenger door, with the hoses feeding into the engine's fuel line. An amount of gasoline equal to the amount held in a teacup was added to the glass cylinder, and the car was driven away by a potential customer while a salesperson monitored the cylinder in an effort to prove how far a Jet could travel on that small amount of gasoline. This novel marketing campaign nevertheless failed to convey the Jet's value as an economical car. 1954 1954 Hudson Jet-Liner sedan 1954 Hudson Jet-Liner convertible A 1954 Hudson Jet 2-Door Utility Sedan For 1954, the Jet received minor trim updates to its two- and four-door sedans. A new luxury model, the Jet-Liner was added making the Jet a three series model line. The Jet-Liner came with chrome trim around the windows and body side, gravel shields, as well as upgraded color-keyed vinyl interiors featuring foam rubber seat cushions. Because convertibles were available in Hudson's full-sized cars, as an experiment a Jet-Liner convertible was built. This sole example was purchased by Hudson's sales manager, Virgil Boyd. Model year 1954 production in the U.S. of the Jet series was 14,224 units. American Motors The estimated $10 to 16 million cost of developing and tooling up for the production of the Jet put Hudson into a precarious position. Without any funds to update the senior Hudson line, Barit convinced the Board that a merger into Nash-Kelvinator represented the best chance of protection for Hudson's stockholders. Barit hoped that the Jet would survive the merger as the resulting new American Motors Corporation focused on the niche market of selling smaller cars. When the merger was completed and Barit assumed his seat on AMC's Board of Directors in 1954, the first Hudson model to terminate production was the Jet. The new company could then focus on the more successful Nash Rambler. Henceforth, Hudson dealers would have badge- engineered versions of Nash's Rambler and Metropolitan compacts to sell as Hudson products. Motorsports The Hudson Jet was fielded in the grueling Carrera Panamericana, described as the world's greatest road race. The 1953 race included Malcolm Eckart finishing in 53rd place, Segurs Chapultepec in 41st, and Enrique Paredes in 42nd, out of the 182 cars that started. Francisco Ramirez finished eighth in the Turismo Especial. In drag racing, an Ike Smith‚Äìprepared Hudson Jet with a \\"Twin H\\" I6 Hornet engine ran consistent low-14-second times. The firewall required modification as the larger engine was not available from the factory, but the National Hot Rod Association (NHRA) made exception to its rules for this car. Legacy Automobile historian Richard M. Langworth has called the Jet \\"the car that torpedoed Hudson\\". While the negative effect of the Jet on the company's financial condition, it was also a time when market forces, including steel prices and labor costs, as well as the sales war between Ford and Chevrolet contributed to the demise of the smaller \\"independent\\" automakers such as Packard, Studebaker, and Willys. The Jet served as the platform for a sleek two- passenger sporty coup√© called the Italia. The Hudson Italia was designed by Frank Spring with the objective of using the body for the Hudson Jet, but Barit wanted a conventional automobile. The limited production Italia featured a body built by Carrozzeria Touring of Milano, with the Jet's standard drivetrain including the I6 engine producing . The Italia is arguably \\"one of the most uniquely designed American sports cars produced during the '50s.\\" One prototype 4-door sedan was also built.  Collectibility  Hudson Jet owners today are part of a small group who enjoy driving a dependable six passenger vehicle from one of the independent automakers. The most desirable collector cars are the 1954 Hudson Jet-Liner in either the two- or four-door sedan versions as these were the top-line offering in the car's second and final year. The relative values of Hudson automobiles in general may make extensive repairs on a worn-out example a relative poor investment value, but combining the simplicity with the relatively low prices of the Hudson Jet \\"make it a great father-son restoration project.\\" NotesReferences  External links * History of Hudson Jet * Hudson-Essex-Terraplane Club * Hudson Car Club * Road Test article from Speed Age magazine, August, 1953 * Jet Hudson Jet Category:Rear-wheel-drive vehicles Category:Sedans Category:Coup√©s Category:Cars introduced in 1953 ","title":"Hudson Jet"},{"id":"4456176","text":"Amblyglyphidodon is a genus of fish in the family Pomacentridae.

It was published in two separate volumes. The first was headed From Home to America (◊§÷ø◊ï◊ü ◊ì◊¢◊® ◊î◊ô◊ô◊ù ◊ß◊ô◊ô◊ü ◊ê÷∑◊û◊¢◊®◊ô◊ß◊¢ ‚Äî fun der heym keyn amerike), relating the protagonist's experiences in Europe, and appearing in 1907. The second was headed In America (◊ê◊ô◊ü ◊ê÷∑◊û◊¢◊®◊ô◊ß◊¢ ‚Äî in amerike), chronicling his life in New York City, and written in 1916. They were printed on numerous occasions in various formats and with differing orthographic conventions. Summary The novel is a first person narrative presented by a boy who, at the outset, is not quite nine years old. He is a member of a Jewish family in Kasrilevke, a fictional shtetl (East European Jewish village) which appears in many works by Sholem Aleichem, and chronicles the daily life of his family and friends. The first volume describes the hardships, poverty, and fears that lead to a decision to emigrate to the United States. The second volume relates their experiences from the immigrant perspective. The narrative presents almost every episode in a humorous manner, even when the events are quite serious. Motl's father, the village's cantor, passes away after a long illness. Motl discovers that being fatherless confers on him certain social privileges, and the more ready forgiveness of the adult community for his pranks. (Although there are repeated references to Motl being an orphan, the term is not used in its present-day sense. His mother is a major figure throughout the entire work.) His older brother Elyahu, recently married, tries to lift the family out of poverty through a series of get-rich-quick schemes he learns from a book, to which Motl is a willing accomplice. However, this effort does not have the desired effect. Together with a group of friends, they depart for America. (It is later told that some time after their departure, Kasrilevke was the target of a particularly severe pogrom, impelling many of the family's neighbors to follow them to America). The route to New York, via Antwerp and London's Whitechapel, is lined with danger, con-artists, other refugees, unfamiliar customs, and a long ocean crossing. At first America only seems to offer new problems, in the form of the austere immigration control on Ellis Island, the sweatshops of the Lower East Side, and the labor riots that often broke out as workers took to the streets to protest working conditions. Life in New York affords Motl unanticipated new experiences (such as smoking and watching Charlie Chaplin movies), and slowly, the family begins to prosper. In the last chapters they buy a grocery store and appear to be moving toward ever greater material comfort. Meanwhile, they are joined in New York by many others of their townspeople, and learn that some time after their departure, Kasrilevke was devastated in a terrible pogrom - impelling many others of its inhabitants to follow them to America. The very last page which Sholem Aleichem ever wrote tells of Motl and his brother getting annoyed with a man who every morning passes and looks at the paper but never buys it. The author's death left this episode forever incomplete. Motl is described as having a natural talent for drawing cartoons ‚Äì sometimes getting into trouble with people feeling insulted by his depiction of them. Some episodes indicate that the author intended to have the character enter a journalistic career.

Carl von Linn√© listed him among the \\"Fathers of Botany\\".  Life  After studying theology and philosophy at the University of Mainz, Brunfels entered a Carthusian monastery in Mainz and later resettled to another Carthusian monastery at K√∂nigshofen near Strasbourg. In Strasbourg he got in contact with a learned lawyer Nikolaus Gerbel (they met in person in 1519). Gerbel drew Brunfels' attention to the healing powers of plants and thus gave the impetus to the further botanical investigations. \\"Christwurz\\" (Helleborus niger) from Herbarum vivae eicones (1530‚Äì1536) After the conversion to the Protestantism (he was supported by Franz von Sickingen and Ulrich von Hutten), upon the insistence of the Dean of Frankfurt Johann Indagine, Brunfels became a minister at Steinau an der Stra√üe (1521) and later, in Neuenburg am Rhein. After that he served for eight years as the head of a Carmelite school in Strasbourg. In the list of most important heretics published by the order of the Emperor by the University of Leuven (1550), Brunfels was listed first. In one of his works he defended Ulrich von Hutten against Erasmus of Rotterdam and published the manuscripts from the Jan Hus heritage. Brunfels' Catalogi virorum illustrium 1527 is considered to be the first book on the history of evangelical Church. After his friend Ulrich von Hutten had died (1523), Brunfels' religious views brought him into a controversy with Martin Luther and Huldrych Zwingli. Later on he began to study medicine at the University of Basel, (MD 1532). In 1532 Brunfels became a City physician in Bern, where he stayed till the end of his life. Besides of his numerous theological works, Brunfels published treatises on pedagogics, Arabic language, pharmaceutics, entomology and botany. He is often called a father of botany, because, in his botanical writings, he relied not so much on the ancient authors as on his own observations and described plants according to the latter. In his Herbarum vivae eicones (1530 and 1536, in three parts) and Contrafayt Kr√§uterbuch (1532‚Äì1537, in two parts), the German plants he himself found during his botanical studies are represented with woodcuts (by Hans Weiditz) under their German vernacular names. However, Duane Isely attributes much of Brunfels' popularity to Weiditz, whose woodcuts set a new standard technically, and were done from life, rather being copied from previous works. Brunfels also introduced information about German plants not found in Dioscorides, and described them independently of their medical values, although the descriptions are often poorly written.Agnes Arber.

A cowling is the removable covering of a vehicle's engine, most often found on automobiles, motorcycles, aircraft, and on outboard boat motors. On planes, cowlings are used to reduce drag and to cool the engine. On boats, cowlings are a cover for an outboard motor. In addition to protecting the engine, outboard motor cowlings need to admit air while keeping water out of the air intake. Etymology \\"Cowling\\" comes from \\"cowl\\", which originated from Middle English coule, from Old English c≈´le, from earlier cugele (‚Äúhood, cowl‚Äù). This, in turn, came from Ecclesiastical Latin cuculla (‚Äúmonk's cowl‚Äù), from Latin cucullus (‚Äúhood‚Äù), of uncertain origin. In aviation In aviation, a cowling may be used for drag reduction or engine cooling by directing airflow. Examples in aviation include the NACA cowling and Townend ring. On a plane, the cowling may also cover part of the fuselage, the nacelles, the engine mount and part of the cockpit.Aviation Machinist's Mates' Manual. Navy Department. Bureau of Aeronautics, 1955. p. 4-15 The cowlings and the fairings are similar, as both streamline airflow, except that cowlings are usually removable (to permit engine inspections and repairs), whereas fairings are bolted in place. Aviation Machinist's Mates' Manual. Navy Department. Bureau of Aeronautics, 1955. p. 4-15 Engine-facing sides of the cowling must be made of metal. Aviation Machinist's Mates' Manual. Navy Department. Bureau of Aeronautics, 1955. p. 4-15 On jets, they are used as an air intake for jet engines. Cowlings may also be used for decorative purposes. On piston-engined planes, the cowling constitutes a symmetric, circular airfoil, in contrast to the planar airfoil of airplane wings. It directs cool air to flow through the engine where it is routed across the engine's hottest parts, that is, the cylinders and heads. Furthermore, turbulence after the air passes the free- standing cylinders is greatly reduced. The sum of all these effects reduces drag by as much as 60 percent. After tests in 1932 proved the effectiveness of NACA cowlings, almost every radial-engined aircraft were equipped with them.Full-Scale Testing of N.A.C.A. Cowlings (Theodore Theodorsen, M. J.

II c. 12) which banned Irish cattle from being sold in England. It was repealed by the Statute Law Revision Act 1863. The Bill was first introduced in 1663 and proved extremely contentious. It was the work of George Villiers, 2nd Duke of Buckingham, who saw it as a means to injure his enemies James Butler, 1st Duke of Ormonde and Edward Hyde, 1st Earl of Clarendon. Ormonde, Lord Lieutenant of Ireland, believed that it would prevent any prloper economic development in Ireland, while Clarendon, though he was not greatly interested in Irish affairs, promised Ormonde, his close friend and ally in Government, to use his authority to see it defeated. Its passage would therefore greatly weaken them politically, and correspondingly strengthen Buckingham. Buckingham said that \\"whoever was against the Bill had either an Irish interest or an Irish understanding\\", giving great offence to Ormonde and his family as a result, but his difficulty was that England did not have a single \\"interest\\". The Bill was strongly supported by those whom Samuel Pepys called \\"the Western gentlemen\\", the landed gentlemen of the North and West of England, and Wales, who believed that the Bill would increase the value of their cattle. It was opposed by the graziers of Norfolk and Suffolk, who made their living partly by fattening Irish cattle, and by Londoners, who were the biggest market for Irish beef. Pepys also reports fears, unfounded in the event, that passing the Bill would lead to a repetition of the Irish Rebellion of 1641. In September 1666, against Government opposition, the Bill was reintroduced in the House of Commons. Pepys thought that this was \\"against the general sense of the House\\" but that the \\"Western gentlemen\\" might carry it by a small majority. Clarendon until too late was confident that the two Houses would reject it or that if all else failed the King would veto it; but preoccupied as he was with the Second Anglo-Dutch War, he seriously underestimated his opponents. Sir William Coventry, more realistically, warned Ormonde that in his view it would pass the Commons, that the House of Lords would make no difficulty, and that the King, embroiled with domestic problems and the Dutch war, would not risk offending Parliament by using his veto. Coventry's predictions were correct: although the King gave his assent with great reluctance, he was acting on Parliament's unofficial pledge to pass two crucial financial Bills on condition that the Importation Bill become law, as it duly did in January 1667. The King's \\"very sharp speech\\" to the Lords on 18 January, which Pepys mentions in his Diary, is an indication of his displeasure at having to assent to the Act.

It is a spur of SR 75 and connects the rest of the state highway system with Naval Air Station North Island. The road is part of a link connecting to the metropolitan area of San Diego via SR 75 and the Coronado Bay Bridge. The entire route uses a one-way couplet, with Third Street in the westbound direction and Fourth Street in the eastbound direction. Third and Fourth streets, as part of the Coronado street system, have existed since the 19th century, and were paved in the early 20th century. SR 282 was designated in 1968, around the time the San Diego‚ÄìCoronado Bridge was opened. Attempts to build first a highway, and later a tunnel, to allow base traffic to bypass the Coronado city streets, were rejected by voters in 1974 and 2010, respectively. Route description SR 282 eastbound at SR 75 in Coronado SR 282 begins at Alameda Boulevard as a one-way couplet consisting of Third and Fourth streets. The portion of Alameda Boulevard between Third and Fourth streets is also part of SR 282 westbound. McCain Boulevard and Tow Way continue west from the Fourth and Third street intersections with Alameda Boulevard into Naval Air Station North Island, respectively. Third and Fourth streets continue through the intersections of I‚ÄìJ avenues, Palm Avenue, and D‚ÄìH avenues, passing through a residential area. Third Street goes by Palm Park, and Fourth Street by Triangle Park; both are at the intersections with Palm Avenue. SR 282 travels slightly southeast towards its terminus at SR 75 (Orange Avenue). SR 282 is part of the National Highway System (NHS), a network of highways that are considered essential to the country's economy, defense, and mobility by the Federal Highway Administration. In 2013, SR 282 had an annual average daily traffic (AADT) of 13,300 on Fourth Avenue between J Avenue and Alameda Boulevard, and 24,200 on Alameda Boulevard between Third and Fourth Streets, the latter of which was the highest AADT for the highway. History The intersection of Third Street and Orange Avenue dates back to at least 1890. Coronado began to commission the paving of much of its street system in the early 1910s. In November 1911, the board of trustees in Coronado approved the paving of Third Street from Orange Avenue to what was K Avenue. It soon became the goal of the city to have all streets paved before the 1915 San Diego World Exposition. The streets west of Orange Avenue were to be handled in one contract, using \\"decomposed granite and oil.\\" Third Street had already been paved with this material by 1913. SR 282 was initially designated in 1967 solely along Fourth Street from SR 75 to the Naval Air Station; however, it was not to be in effect until the San Diego‚ÄìCoronado Bridge was completed. Nevertheless, before the bridge opened, the designation was added in the 1968 legislative session, along with the portion of Orange Avenue from the Coronado Ferry landing to Fourth Street, which was to be removed once the Coronado Bay Bridge opened. The designation came into effect on February 21, 1969. In April, plans were under way to repave Fourth and Third Streets and add signals at the Orange Avenue intersections. The bridge opened on August 3, 1969. In September, the City of Coronado added Third Street as a truck route going westbound to the base, in addition to the already-existing Fourth Street truck route leaving the base. In 1974, Proposition N was proposed to attempt to resolve concerns regarding traffic in Coronado. The plan was to build another highway along the northern and eastern shore of Coronado Island, to bypass the busy residential and commercial districts and provide easy access to the North Island Naval Air Station from the western end of the bridge. The proposition asked voters whether the City Council should \\"actively pursue\\" the matter. Previous proposals had included widening Fourth Street to be able to handle traffic in both directions. Critics contended that the highway would block the view of the San Diego Bay. Coronado Mayor Rolland McNelly opposed the proposal in early November 1974 as it would require approval from over 30 government agencies and would force the city to continue with it, although some declared the road \\"impossible to build.\\" The voters rejected this plan, and the City Council then voted to keep traffic along Third and Fourth streets, closing the gate at First and Second streets. The bridge and the resulting traffic continued to be a hotly debated issue in the early 1980s. A plan in 1981 to convert Fourth Street into an expressway leading to the naval station was strongly opposed by the public due to the required demolition of structures and a lack of evidence that the plan would succeed in reducing traffic; by this time, Third and Fourth streets had been converted into one- way streets between the bridge and the naval station. In April 2006, the Navy commenced construction on an entrance to the Naval Air Station from the intersection of Third Street and Alameda Boulevard. The new entrance was completed in July 2007, and the existing entrance and exit on Fourth Street was made an exit-only station. Before then, traffic entering the base had to continue southwest on Alameda Boulevard, making a left on Fourth Street. This change was expected to reduce congestion in downtown Coronado. The City of Coronado has attempted to have a tunnel built from the Coronado bridge to the San Diego Naval Base numerous times, and hired Ledford Enterprises to help with the lobbying process in 2002 and 2006. The city endorsed a proposed study in 2004 to determine possible alternatives to resolve the traffic issues, which included keeping the status quo. On June 8, 2010, Coronado voters decided against Proposition H, which would have advised the city to undergo further investigation into building a tunnel between the Coronado bridge and the San Diego Naval Base. This concluded ten years of studies and proposals by the city of Coronado to find a way to reduce traffic to the naval station during rush hour. Critics of the proposal did not believe that the tunnel would resolve the traffic issues. Following this, the Coronado City Council voted to abolish the Tunnel Commission.

In other words, the anthroposystem model serves to compare the flow of materials through human systems to those in naturally occurring systems. As defined by Santos, an anthroposystem is \\"the orderly combination or arrangement of physical and biological environments for the purpose of maintaining human civilization...built by man to sustain his kind.\\" The anthroposystem is intimately linked to economic and ecological systems as well. Description Both the anthroposystem and ecosystem can be divided into three groups: producers, consumers, and recyclers. In the ecosystem, the producers or autotrophs consist of plants and some bacteria capable of producing their own food via photosynthesis or chemical synthesis, the consumers consist of animals that obtain energy from grazing and/or by feeding on other animals and the recyclers consist of decomposers such as fungi and bacteria. In the anthroposystem, the producers consist of the energy production through fossil fuels, manufacturing with non-fuel minerals and growing food; the consumers consist of humans and domestic animals and the recyclers consist of the decomposing or recycling activities (i.e. waste water treatment, metal and solid waste recycling). The ecosystem is sustainable whereas the anthroposystem is not. The ecosystem is a closed loop in which nearly everything is recycled whereas the anthroposystem is an open loop where very little is recycled. In contrast to the ecosystem, the anthroposystem's producers and consumers are significantly more spatially displaced than those in the ecosystem and thus, more energy is required to transfer matter to a producer or recycler. Currently, a large majority of this energy comes from non-renewable fossil fuels. Additionally, recycling is a naturally occurring component of the ecosystem, and is responsible for much of the resources used by the system. Under the anthroposystem model, however, recycling does not naturally occur. Outside input is relied on for material and energy supplies, and recycling systems that do exist are artificially created. The process of improving the flow of energy, such that waste can be reused as input resources, is known as industrial ecology. A matrix can be used to describe the anthropological network of producers, consumers and recyclers and the movement of materials between each. However, the matrix model of the anthroposystem - based on a model for the ecosystem - fails in acknowledging the physical redistribution of mobilized matter. In developing the anthroposystem model, there is a trade-off between simplicity and completeness. A simple representative model can be created involving only producers, consumers, and recyclers, but this is an open, incomplete system. More components and analogues (such as a matrix that encompasses the producers, consumers and recyclers) can be added to the system to make a more complete model, but the model loses simplicity in the process. Though the anthroposystem concept is flawed in this manner, it is a very good starting point for analyzing human activities and their effects on the environment. When viewing the Earth as one large anthroposystem, we are essentially eliminating the uncertainty in material flow. All goods (i.e. fossil fuels) will still exist in the system but in a new form (i.e. pollutants). Therefore, the Laws of Conservation of Matter and Conservation of Energy can be applied to analyze how material flow will impact the environment.

It was released to coincide with the band's final tour, as they had announced that they would break up following tours of the United States and Canada that Spring. The album includes tracks from all three of the band's full-length studio albums: The Moon is Down (2001), How to Start a Fire (2003), and Hide Nothing (2004). As such it includes all three of the band's lead vocalists: Chris Carrabba, Jason Gleason, and Jon Bunch. Its title is taken from a lyric in the song \\"Pictures of Shorelines.\\" The album also includes several bonus tracks. \\"Vengeance Factor\\" was the first song the band ever released, having originally appeared on the Deep Elm Records compilation An Ocean of Doubt, and was recorded with original singer Carrabba. \\"There, Now I've Said It\\" is a previously unreleased outtake from How to Start a Fire, recorded with Gleason. This version of \\"Say It Ain't So\\" was recorded with Carrabba for the compilation Rock Music: A Tribute to Weezer and was previously included as a bonus track on the vinyl LP version of The Moon is Down. Carrabba's version did not appear on the final tribute compilation, as by that time the band had re-recorded the song with Gleason. The acoustic rendition of \\"Light Up Ahead\\" was originally included as a bonus track on Best Buy versions of Hide Nothing and was recorded with Bunch. The cover of *NSYNC's \\"Bye Bye Bye\\" was recorded with Gleason and originally appeared on the compilation Punk Goes Pop. \\"Justice Prevails\\" is taken from the band's debut EP From the 27th State and was recorded with Carrabba.

A sequel to the game, titled Zoo Tycoon 2 DS, was released in 2008. Content The graphics and gameplay are somewhat similar to the first Zoo Tycoon game, however, for the DS version, the terrain is in a grid format and does not blend smoothly with other terrain types like they do in the PC and Mac versions. The objects and animals available in the game are also that of the first Zoo Tycoon game. The game has two playing options, either tutorial/scenario or freeform. Tutorial/Scenario mode takes the player through many short games, each with a set goal, increasing in difficulty. Freeform lets players create a zoo free of time restrictions and goals. Reception Zoo Tycoon DS received mixed to poor reviews, with an average score of 44.96% on GameRankings and 44/100 on Metacritic, indicating \\"generally unfavorable reviews\\".http://www.gamerankings.com/ds/927198-zoo-tycoon- ds/index.htmlhttp://www.metacritic.com/game/ds/zoo-tycoon-ds Greg Mueller, reviewing Zoo Tycoon DS for GameSpot, disproved of the game's graphics, criticizing how \\"Of all the 50 animals [in the game], only a few of them actually have distinct looks. You'll see the same brownish blob move around using the same two or three frames of animation over and over, which just doesn't look natural at all.\\". Muller also criticized the near-complete lack of music and sound effects, remarking \\"You could play this game on mute without missing anything. You might be deprived of the sweeping noise maintenance workers make, but you can just grab a broom and make the noise yourself, which, incidentally, would probably be about as much fun as playing this game\\".http://www.gamespot.com/reviews/zoo-tycoon-ds-review/1900-6137177/ Dan Adams of IGN also strongly detested the game, despairingly opening up his review with the words, while sending himself death threads; \\"Please kill me. I just want to die. Zoo Tycoon DS has sucked the will to live out of my eyeballs and left me with nothing but cramped hands. ... I can't remember the last time I saw such an ugly game with so many deficiencies.\\"http://uk.ign.com/articles/2005/11/01/zoo-tycoon-ds The most positive review came from Nintendo Power, who praised the game for \\"faithfully reproducing the Zoo Tycoon experience\\" on the Nintendo DS.Nintendo Power, November 2005 issue, Page 112 Zoo Tycoon DS received a \\"Platinum\\" sales award from the Entertainment and Leisure Software Publishers Association (ELSPA), indicating sales of at least 300,000 copies in the United Kingdom.

Population: . History The Plyussa River in Slantsy The creation of the settlement was proposed in 1930 by Sergey Kirov, when a large oil shale deposit was discovered in the region. The construction began in 1932. The main street was named after Kirov. On December 20, 1934, rural localities of Nikolskoye and Gavrilovskoye, then a part of Polsky Selsoviet of Gdovsky District of Leningrad Oblast, were merged to form the urban-type settlement of Slantsy. On March 11, 1941, Slantsevsky District was split from Gdovsky District and Slantsy became the district administrative center. Between August 1941 and February 1944, Slantsy was occupied by German troops. On April 5, 1949, Slantsy was granted town status. On January 1, 1963, Slantsevsky District was abolished and split between Kingiseppsky and Luzhsky Districts. On November 3, 1965, it was re-established. Administrative and municipal status Within the framework of administrative divisions, Slantsy serves as the administrative center of Slantsevsky District.Oblast Law #32-oz As an administrative division, it is, together with eight rural localities, incorporated within Slantsevsky District as Slantsevskoye Settlement Municipal Formation. As a municipal division, Slantsevskoye Settlement Municipal Formation is incorporated within Slantsevsky Municipal District as Slantsevskoye Urban Settlement.Law #47-oz Economy=Industry The town's name is the Russian word for shale. The town was largely sustained by oil shale mining by Leningradslanets mining company, as depicted on its coat of arms, and shale oil production by Zavod Slantsy. The mines are now largely closed due to decrease in local demand and disagreements over contracts with nearby Estonia. This has resulted in large-scale local unemployment. Furthermore, the disused mines present a serious ecological threat to water supplies in the region. Additionally, there are construction industry (including cement plants), chemical industry, and food industry enterprises. Transportation Slantsy railway station A railway connects Slantsy with Gdov in the south and with Veymarn in the north. Originally, the railway connected Pskov with Veymarn. It was destroyed during World War II and the stretch between Gdov and Pskov was never rebuilt. Slantsy is connected by roads with Pskov via Gdov and with Kingisepp. There are also local roads, with bus traffic originating from Slantsy. Culture and recreation Slantsy contains four objects classified as cultural and historical heritage of local significance. Three of those commemorate events related to World War II, while the fourth one is the building of the first shale mine open in Slantsy. The Slantsy Museum of History and Culture, focusing on the history of Slantsy, is the only state museum in Slantsevsky District.

October Square on 21 March 2006. The Jeans Revolution (, transliteration: D≈æynsavaja revalucyja, ) was a term used by Belarus' democratic opposition to describe their protests following the 2006 Belarusian presidential election.A 2005 Iryna Khalip interview Etymology The Jeans Revolution was also referred to as the Cornflower Revolution (–≤–∞—Å–∏–ª—å–∫–æ–≤–∞—è —Ä–µ–≤–æ–ª—é—Ü–∏—è, in Russian media) and the Denim Revolution, in reference to the color blue as a parallel to the other color revolutions; however, unlike them, the Jeans Revolution did not bring radical changes to Belarusian politics and society. History The term \\"Jeans Revolution\\" originated after a 16 September 2005 public demonstration against the policies of Alexander Lukashenko. On 16 September 1999 popular Belarusian opposition leader Viktor Gonchar had disappeared; the Council of Europe suspects that the present head of the Belarusian SOBR, Dmitri Pavlichenko, had links with Gonchar's disappearance. The Belarusian police seized the white-red-white flags used by the opposition (and banned in the state), and an activist of the youth movement Zubr, Mikita Sasim (Belarusian: –úi–∫i—Ç–∞ –°–∞—Åi–º, Russian: –ù–∏–∫–∏—Ç–∞ –°–∞—Å–∏–º), raised his denim shirt (commonly called a \\"jeans shirt\\" in Russian), announcing this would be their flag instead. http://www.charter97.org/bel/news/2005/09/16/omon Charter97: OMON against Truth In the former Soviet Union, jeans often symbolized Western culture. The Belarusian opposition recognized denim as a symbol of protest against Lukashenko's \\"Soviet-like\\" policies, carrying also the message that Belarusians are \\"not isolated [from the West]\\"Grass-Roots Groups Vying for Change in Belarus' Authoritarian Regime, ABC News Subsequently, Zubr suggested wearing jeans on the 16th day of each month, in remembrance of alleged disappearances in Belarus. 19 March 2006 The term \\"Jeans Revolution\\" came to prominence after the demonstrations held in Minsk, the capital of Belarus, disputing the elections. The protest against the outcome of the 19 March election began as soon as polls closed late Sunday, with more than 10,000 people gathering in the square. Each evening saw a smaller and smaller gathering‚Äî5,000 on Monday, 3,000 to 4,000 on Tuesday. As of 23 March, only about 200 mostly youthful protesters remained concentrated around the opposition's tent camp erected on October Square in Minsk. white-red-white flag of 1918 to 1919 by the independence from Russia, from the independence by the Soviet Union in 1991 to 1995, used by the protestors. On 24 March authorities sent in riot police to clear out the makeshift tent-camp in October Square and ordered the protesters to disperse. State television carried a report from city police stating that no one was hurt in the operation. Some observers remarked on the relatively gentle treatment of demonstrators and suggested that the Belarusian president may have attempted to react more sensibly given Western opinion. President Alexander Lukashenko earlier announced that protests similar to what occurred during the Orange, Rose, and Tulip Revolutions would not take place in Belarus, stating that \\"force will not be [allowed to be] used\\" to claim the presidency. Belarus authorities vowed to crush unrest in the event of large-scale protests following the election. On 20 March, Alaksandar Milinkieviƒç told 7,000 supporters (fewer than in Sunday's gathering) that they faced a long haul with their protests: \\"We, free people of Belarus, will never recognise the election. They are afraid of us. Their power is based on lies\\". However, Lukashenko renewed charges that his rivals had planned pro-Western revolts like those in the ex-Soviet republics of Ukraine and Georgia. \\"Let me say that the revolution that so many people talked about and some were preparing, has failed and it could not be otherwise\\", he stated during the news conference on his victory. On 25 March, approximately 45,000 protesters in Belarus confronted police forces. The police did not clash with the demonstrators, waiting for riot squads to arrive. Later on, there were clashes between protesters and the riot police and the protesters were eventually driven back. More than 100 people were arrested along with Alexander Kozulin, a supporter of the protests and a candidate against Lukashenko. The police allegedly assaulted Kozulin during his arrest. On 14 July 2006, Kozulin was sentenced to five-and-a-half years imprisonment for his actions in the protests. Also on 25 March, Milinkieviƒç stated that he hoped for a month-long pause in protests, apparently hoping that he could build up opposition and calm angst.

A film with the same title was released on December 19, 1981. Production The anime television series was produced by Ashi Productions with a feature film (with a strong environmental theme) and distributed by the Toei Company in 1981. While 39 episodes were intended, only 34 were ultimately finished, with 31 airing on TV. Some, but not all of the events that would have been in the final 5 episodes were compressed into the film. The name of the Baldios mecha was unchanged, although it played a small part in the film. In Italy, the series and film were shown as Baldios, Il Guerriero dello Spazio. In Cuba, another feature-film version of Baldios was released in theaters (including violence removed from the American version) as Yaltus. Story The TV series begins on S-1, a futuristic world whose wartime pollution has forced its occupants to live underground. Its emperor is assassinated by military fanatic Zeo Gattler and his followers, who frame the team of scientists who recently found a solution to their planet's environmental decay. Gattler's followers invade the head scientist's laboratory, killing the environmentalists and destroying their work. He loads the civilian population aboard a fortress, the Algol, and flies off to conquer a new planet. Angered by Gattler's devious actions, the lead scientist's son (protagonist Marin Raygun) tries to escape. Before he can, he is caught in the Algol warp drive and finds himself near Earth in the year 2100. When he sees a Martian colony destroyed by Gattler's Aldebaren Army, Marin joins the military organization Blue Fixer. His ship becomes part of Blue Fixer's mecha, the space warrior Baldios. Marin and the Blue Fixer team (Jamie Hoshino, combat pilots Jack Oliver and Raita Hokuto, researcher Ella Quinstein and commander Takeshi Tsukikage) defend Earth against Gattler and the S-1 force. The conflict ends when Gattler triggers a massive tsunami by melting Earth's polar ice caps with artificial suns, flooding the planet and killing millions. Blue Fixer is helpless to stop it, and Marin watches the waves in horror. They remove the radioactive core of the World Union submarine base, which threatened to contaminate Earth, transporting it to the Aldebaren fleet where it kills Gattler, his troops and Commander Tsukikage. The Baldios film contains a final confrontation between Marin and Gattler. In the series and the film, S-1 and Earth are the same planet. Gattler and his troops' time travel caused the same pollution which forced them to leave S-1, closing the time loop.

It was produced and aired in 1981 in Japan, with a movie special released in 1982 and a film sequel, GoShogun: The Time √âtranger or Time Stranger, in 1985. Its title has been variously translated into English as \\"Demon God of the War-Torn Land GoShogun\\", \\"Warring Demon God GoShogun\\", and \\"Civil War Devil-God GoShogun,\\" but in the US and parts of Europe it is primarily known as Macron 1, the title of its North American adaptation. The GoShogun series and its film sequel, The Time √âtranger, were both written by Takeshi Shudo and directed by Kunihiko Yuyama. The series is noted for its witty dialogue and lighthearted parody of its own genre conventions. The Time √âtranger shifts away from the original genre, leaving the robot aside entirely to focus on the strong and complex heroine. It has been praised for its serious tone, psychological intensity, and handling of mature themes.Toole, \\"Etranger in an Etrange Land.\\" Original story The story is set in the early 21st century, in which a covert evil organization, Dokuga, led by lord NeoNeros, holds near total political, economic, and military control of the world. Dokuga agents try to forcibly recruit a brilliant physicist, Professor Sanada, who sets off a suicide bomb rather than let Dokuga acquire his secret research. His son Kenta becomes Dokuga's next target, but is saved by his father‚Äôs colleague and taken on board a teleporting fortress, Good Thunder. Teleportation is enabled by a mysterious form of energy, called Beamler, which was discovered by Sanada. The same energy also powers a giant battle robot, GoShogun, which is operated by three pilots. The crew of Good Thunder travels the world, repeatedly fighting off NeoNeros's forces with GoShogun and often hampering Dokuga's influence on the local level, whether by destroying their bases and businesses, assisting popular rebellions, or by averting environmental disasters. On at least one occasion GoShogun pilots must team up with Dokuga's three chief officers against a common enemy to prevent the destruction of them all. This sets the stage for an eleventh-hour reversal, in which the three Dokuga generals side definitively against NeoNeros with the GoShogun team. Over the course of the series it is revealed that Beamler energy originates from a meteorite fragment found on the site of the Tunguska impact. It was sent to Earth by a supernatural power and was activated when humans attained the technological capacity for space exploration, in order to test whether humans are worthy of engaging with civilizations from other planets. Beamler's development is closely connected to Kenta, who in the end becomes the incarnate form of the energy and the representative of the earth's collective soul, including not only living things, but also newly sentient robots and machines. NeoNeros turns out to be a negative, evil form of the same energy. After defeating him, Kenta takes GoShogun into space. Adaptations=North America In 1985, Saban Entertainment combined footage from GoShogun and Ak≈´ Dai Sakusen Srungle (Great Military Operation in Subspace Srungle or Mission Outer Space Srungle), a similar show produced by Kokusai Eiga-sha, to form Macron 1. Taking two (or more) unrelated series and re-editing them to appear as one storyline was common practice in adapting anime series to American television, as the number of episodes in a typical anime frequently fell short of the minimum number required for five-days-a-week syndication in the US market (65). Aside from Macron 1, Voltron: Defender of the Universe, Robotech, and Captain Harlock and the Queen of a Thousand Years were also stitched together in this manner. The combined series Macron 1 was produced and released in the United States, using the same voice cast as Carl Macek's Robotech adaptation. In the US version, test pilot David Chance is accidentally transported into a parallel universe controlled by a tyrannical organization called GRIP, led by Dark Star. This allows GRIP to send their forces to Earth, leaving Dark Star's cyborg henchman Orn as deputy in the alternate universe. Fighting against GRIP are two teams comprising \\"Macron 1\\": the first (from the GoShogun footage) battles against Dark Star's legions on Earth; Beta Command (from the Srungle footage) is working to overthrow Orn. The main focus is on the Macron team on Earth, with Beta Command appearing sporadically. The Macron 1 adaptation made use of the so-called \\"Miami Vice formula\\" introduced a year earlier by the eponymous primetime series, incorporating contemporary pop music into the action scenes. Notable musical adaptations included \\"Beat It,\\" \\"Shout,\\" \\"Safety Dance,\\" and \\"The Heat is On.\\" Discotek Media released the series on subtitled-only DVD in November 2017. Central Park Media had licensed the Time √âtranger film and released the film twice on DVD. Discotek has also licensed the film and released it on DVD and Blu-ray in June 2017. Europe Around the same time as the US adaptation, in 1985, Saban released another version of the series in several European countries, also under the title Macron 1. This version, however, did not incorporate any footage from Srungle or the parallel-universe angle, making the international Macron 1 a more straightforward adaptation of GoShogun, though still heavily edited. In Italy the series was broadcast as Gotriniton-Goshogun, il dio della guerra, and was a direct translation of the Japanese original, without recutting. In France the first few episodes of GoShogun were released under the title Fulgutor. Characters=Good Thunder Team *Captain Sabarath (v.b. Osamu Kobayashi): Captain of Good Thunder and senior advisor of the GoShogun team; colleague of the late Professor Sanada.

Formerly a secret agent in France. Knowledgeable in art; hopeless in the kitchen. Renamed Kathy Jamison (v.b. Lisa Michelson, then wife of Gregory Snegoff) in Macron 1. *Killy Gagley (v.b. Hideyuki Tanaka): Pilot of the third jet, Jack Knight, which docks inside GoShogun's right leg. A former gangster from New York, nicknamed the \\"Wolf of Bronx,\\" he is tough, street-smart, and something of a jokester. Has a knack for throwing knives, an eye for the ladies, and is writing an autobiography. Renamed Scott Cutter (v.b. Kerrigan Mahan) in Macron 1. *Kenta Sanada (v.b. Y≈çko Matsuoka): The son of Professor Sanada, the scientist who discovered Beamler and built Good Thunder and GoShogun. Ten years old at the start of the series, highly inventive, but initially a slacker and troublemaker. Over time he develops a paranormal ability to communicate with machines and robots, as well as with spirits of the earth's ecosystems, and finally becomes the living embodiment of Beamler energy. Renamed Nathan Bridger (v.b. Barbara Goodson) in Macron 1. *Father (v.b. Yuzuru Fujimoto): Good Thunder's super-computer and AI, programmed from the mind of Professor Sanada. At times, overrides commands from Sabarath to follow the Professor's instructions and ensure the passing of Beamler energy from one stage of development to the next. Renamed Hugo (v.b. Steve Kramer) in Macron 1. *OVA (v.b. Satomi Majima): Kenta's robot tutor and caretaker, who becomes more like a mother to him. Renamed ND-2 (v.b. Ted Layman) in Macron 1. *TriThree: Small robot formed by the assembly of the three jets, piloted by Remy. Renamed MacStar in Macron 1. *GoShogun: The eponymous robot of the series, renamed MacStar-1 in Macron 1. Its weapons include a gigantic axe, an energy sword, and a photon bazooka. GoShogun can fire laser-like beams from its eyes and other parts of its body. Its most powerful weapon, called GoFlasher, consists of five energy missiles launched from the robot's upper back, giving its head a semi-divine aura. Initially, GoFlasher has a purely destructive power, but as Beamler develops, this power becomes an animating one, giving sentience to enemy robots, which then choose to self-destruct rather than continue fighting. Dokuga Crime Syndicate *NeoNeros (v.b. Yuzuru Fujimoto): The evil leader, renamed Dark Star (v.b. Ike Medlick) in Macron 1. A menacing figure on a dark throne, he is always shown in shadow, and his true form is not revealed until the finale. *Leonardo Medici Bundle (v.b. Kaneto Shiozawa): One of three chief officers of NeoNeros, specializing in intelligence, espionage, and intrigue. Appears as a dandy prince with long blond hair, usually holding a rose or a glass of red wine; judges everything on the basis of beauty or lack thereof, and goes into battle with classical music playing on loudspeakers. Over time, develops a romantic interest in Remy. His first and second names are based on Leonardo da Vinci and Lorenzo de Medici. In The Time √âtranger, he is portrayed as a latter-day samurai, preferring the katana to other weapons. Renamed Prince Eharn (v.b. Gregory Snegoff) in Macron 1. *Suegni Cuttnal (v.b. Sh≈çjir≈ç Kihara): Second henchman of NeoNeros, responsible for military strategy. Portrayed as an older-looking, one-eyed pirate, usually with his pet crow sitting on his shoulder. He runs a business selling his own brand of tranquilizers (\\"Cuttnalizers\\"), which he himself consumes frequently, by the handful.

Daisuke G≈çri): A synthetic human with blue-green skin, and third henchman of NeoNeros, responsible for combat operations. Crude, brutish, and has severe anger management issues. One of his driving ambitions, however, is to open a chain of fried chicken restaurants called \\"Kernagul's Fried Chicken\\" and a hamburger chain called \\"KerDonald's\\". He is shown to have achieved this dream in The Time √âtranger. Renamed Lord Jeraldan (v.b. Robert V. Barron) in Macron 1. *Dr. Jitter (v.b. Mikio Terashima): Scientist working for Dokuga, responsible for inventing destroids intended to destroy GoShogun, as well as other weapons and technological tricks. Often complains about insufficient funding. Renamed Dr. Fritz (v.b. Gregory Snegoff) in Macron 1. *Mother (v.b. Satomi Majima): Dokuga's super-computer, counterpart to Father. *Keruna: Kernagul's stress-relief robot, mainly functioning as his personal punching bag during outbursts of anger.

Movie Special The GoShogun Movie, released in 1982, is a combination of episodes 20 and 17 (in that order) from the original series. It includes a summary of key events, snippets from the daily lives and background stories of the characters, and advertisements for fictional products. The closing credits show images of the main characters as children. The last of these, young Remy, would later make an appearance in The Time √âtranger.Jonathan Clements and Helen McCarthy, The Anime Encyclopedia, Revised & Expanded Edition: A Guide to Japanese Animation since 1917 (Berkeley, CA: Stone Bridge Press, 2006): 245-6. The Time √âtranger A surrealistic follow-up film, known as The Time √âtranger or Time Stranger (1985), is set forty years after the events of the GoShogun TV series. The team has long since disbanded, and most of them have lost touch, but when Remy is rendered comatose in a car crash, her old friends and former enemies gather at her bedside to try to lend her their strength. Meanwhile, in Remy's dream, she and her five friends are in the prime of their lives, and are trapped in a mysterious desert city inhabited by hostile fanatics, who worship a god of fate. All six team members receive anonymous letters that ordain for each of them a brutal death within several days, with Remy set to die first. As they fight back against the forces of fate, Remy is haunted by increasingly disturbing visions of her foretold demise, as well as by flashbacks to her lonely and troubled childhood, designed to drive her to despair. It is notable that the feature-length sequel of a \\"giant robot\\" series barely makes any reference to the giant robot, except for a brief shot of a GoShogun-shaped charm on the rearview mirror of Remy's car and a museum devoted to the former exploits of the GoShogun crew. All the fighting in the dream sequence is done with cold weapons and common firearms, such as Remy's trusty revolver. Video games *The GoShogun team and mecha make several appearances in the Super Robot Wars series with various enemy robots including Debiza , Dogave, Doshard, the GoShogun doppelganger Gonagurl, and the three Dokuga ships and their fighters, the impactors. *In Super Robot Wars Alpha 2 and Super Robot Wars Alpha 3, Leonardo Medici Bundle's ship has \\"The Blue Danube\\" as its default background music. This song is played on enormous speakers, and it is one of the few situations in which Elzam V. Branstein (a.k.a. R√§tsel Feinschmecker)'s theme \\"Trombe!\\" is overridden.

Bricker, the sponsor of the proposed constitutional amendment to limit the \\"treaty power\\" of the United States government The Bricker Amendment is the collective name of a number of slightly different proposed amendments to the United States Constitution considered by the United States Senate in the 1950s. None of these amendments ever passed Congress. Each of them would require explicit congressional approval, especially for executive agreements that did not require the Senate's two thirds approval for treaty. They are named for their sponsor, conservative Republican Senator John W. Bricker of Ohio, who distrusted the exclusive powers of the president to involve America beyond the wishes of Congress. American entry into World War II led to a new sense of internationalism, which seemed threatening to many conservatives. Frank E. Holman, president of the American Bar Association (ABA), called attention to Federal court decisions, notably Missouri v. Holland, which he claimed could give international treaties and agreements precedence over the United States Constitution and could be used by foreigners to threaten American liberties. Senator Bricker was influenced by the ABA's work and first introduced a proposed constitutional amendment in 1951. With substantial popular support and the election of a Republican president and Congress in the elections of 1952, together with support from many Southern Democrats, Bricker's plan seemed destined to Pass Congress by the necessary two thirds vote and be sent to the individual states for ratification by three fourths of the state legislatures. The best-known version of the Bricker Amendment, considered by the Senate in 1953‚Äì54, declared that no treaty could be made by the United States that conflicted with the Constitution; treaties could not be self-executing without the passage of separate enabling legislation through Congress; treaties could not give Congress legislative powers beyond those specified in the Constitution. It also limited the president's power to enter into executive agreements with foreign powers. Bricker's proposal attracted broad bipartisan support and was a focal point of intra-party conflict between the Eisenhower administration, which represented the more internationalist liberal Republican element and the Old Right faction of conservative Republican senators, based in isolationist Midwestern strongholds. Despite the initial support, the Bricker Amendment was blocked through the intervention of President Eisenhower and Senate Minority Leader Lyndon Johnson. It failed in the Senate by a single vote in 1954, and was never voted on by the House. Duane Tananbaum, The Bricker Amendment Controversy: A test of Eisenhower's political leadership ( 1988). Three years later the Supreme Court of the United States explicitly ruled in Reid v. Covert that the Bill of Rights cannot be abrogated by agreements with foreign powers. Nevertheless, Senator Bricker's ideas still have supporters, and new versions of his amendment have been reintroduced in Congress periodically. Historical background=Fears return after World War II Flag of the United Nations. Many Americans were fearful in the 1940s that the United Nations could interfere in the country's internal affairs.

Voting no were William Langer of North Dakota and Henrik Shipstead of Minnesota. Hiram Johnson of California would have voted no had he been able-bodied; he died on August 6, 1945.

While Article II of the United Nations Charter stated \\"Nothing contained in the present Charter shall authorize the United Nations to intervene in matters which are essentially within the domestic jurisdiction of any state,\\" an international analogue to the Tenth Amendment, Holman saw the work of the U.N. on the proposed Genocide Convention and Universal Declaration of Human RightsGladwin Hill. \\"U.N.

The Genocide Convention's text can be found on-line here . Holman cautioned the Genocide Convention would subject Americans to the jurisdiction of foreign courts with unfamiliar procedures and without the protections afforded under the Bill of Rights. He said the Convention's language was sweeping and vague and offered a scenario where a white motorist who struck and killed a black child could be extradited to The Hague on genocide charges.Tananbaum, 13. Holman's critics claimed the language was no more sweeping or vague than the state and Federal statutes that American courts interpreted every day. Duane Tananbaum, the leading historian of the Bricker Amendment, wrote \\"most of ABA's objections to the Genocide Convention had no basis whatsoever in reality\\" and his example of a car accident becoming an international incident was not possible.Tananbaum, 14. Eisenhower's Attorney General Herbert Brownell called this scenario \\"outlandish\\".Herbert Brownell and John P. Burke. Advising Ike: The Memoirs of Attorney General Herbert Brownell. Lawrence, Kansas: University Press of Kansas, 1993. 265. But Holman's hypothetical especially alarmed Southern Democrats who had gone to great lengths to obstruct Federal action targeted at ending the Jim Crow system of racial segregation in the American South. They feared that, if ratified, the Genocide Convention could be used in conjunction with the Constitution's Necessary and Proper Clause to pass a Federal civil rights law (despite the conservative view that such a law would go beyond the enumerated powers of Article I, Section 8). President Eisenhower's aide Arthur Larson said Holman's warnings were part of \\"all kinds of preposterous and legally lunatic scares [that] were raised,\\" including \\"that the International Court would take over our tariff and immigration controls, and then our education, post offices, military and welfare activities.\\"Arthur Larson. Eisenhower: The President that Nobody Knows. New York: Charles Scribner's Sons, 1968. 144. In Holman's own book advancing the Bricker Amendment he wrote the U.N. Charter meant the Federal government could: > control and regulate all education, including public and parochial schools, > it could control and regulate all matters affecting civil rights, marriage, > divorce, etc; it could control all our sources of production of foods and > the products of the farms and factories;... it could regiment labor and > conditions of employment.Frank E. Holman. The Story of the \\"Bricker > Amendment.\\" New York City: Fund for Constitutional Government, 1954. 38. Legal background The Constitution of the United States granted the Federal government control of foreign affairs. The United States Constitution, effective in 1789, gave the Federal government power over foreign affairs and restricted the individual States' authority in this realm. Article I, section ten provides, \\"no State shall enter into any Treaty, Alliance, or Confederation\\" and that \\"no State shall, without the Consent of the Congress . . . enter into any Agreement or Compact with another State or with a foreign Power.\\" The Federal government's primacy was made clear in the Supremacy Clause of Article VI, which declares, \\"This Constitution, and the laws of the United States which shall be made in Pursuance thereof; and all Treaties made, or which shall be made, under the authority of the United States, shall be the Supreme Law of the land; and the Judges in every state shall be bound thereby, any Thing in the Constitution or Laws of any State to the Contrary notwithstanding.\\"In general on treaties and the Constitution, see Roger Lea MacBride. Treaties Versus the Constitution. Caldwell, Idaho: The Caxton Printers, 1953.

Act of February 20, 1792. ch. 7. 1 Stat. 232. Early precedents Constitutional scholars note that the supremacy clause was designed to protect the only significant treaty into which the infant United States had entered: the Treaty of Paris of 1783, which ended the Revolutionary War and under which Great Britain recognized the thirteen former colonies as thirteen independent and fully sovereign states.Definitive Treaty of Peace Between the United States of America and His Britannic Majesty. Treaty of September 3, 1783. 8 Stat. 80. Nonetheless, its wording ignited fear of the potential abuse of the treaty power from the beginning. For example, the North Carolina ratifying convention that approved the Constitution did so with a reservation asking for a constitutional amendment that > No treaties which shall be directly opposed to the existing laws of the > United States in Congress assembled shall be valid until such laws shall be > repealed, or made conformable to such treaty; nor shall any treaty be valid > which is contradictory to the Constitution of the United States.Akhil Reed > Amar.

Early legal precedents striking down State laws that conflicted with federally negotiated international treaties arose from the peace treaty with Britain,See Ware v.

Subsequently, in a case involving a treaty concluded with the Cherokee Indians, the Supreme Court declared \\"It need hardly be said that a treaty cannot change the Constitution or be held valid if it be in violation of that instrument. This results from the nature and fundamental principles of our government. The effect of treaties and acts of Congress, when in conflict, is not settled by the Constitution. But the question is not involved in any doubt as to its proper solution. A treaty may supersede a prior act of Congress, and an act of Congress may supersede a prior treaty.\\"The Cherokee Tobacco, 78 U.S. (11 Wall.) 616 (1870) at 621‚Äì622. See also Doe v.

Likewise, in a case regarding ownership of land by foreign nationals, the Court wrote, \\"The treaty power, as expressed in the constitution, is in terms unlimited, except by those restraints which are found in that instrument against the action of the government, or of its departments, and those arising from the nature of the government itself, and of that of the states. It would not be contended that it extends so far as to authorize what the constitution forbids, or a change in the character of the government, or in that of one of the states, or a cession of any portion of the territory of the latter, without its consent. But, with these exceptions, it is not perceived that there is any limit to the questions which can be adjusted touching any matter which is properly the subject of negotiation with a foreign country.\\"De Geofroy v. Riggs, 133 U.S. 258 (1890) at 267. Justice Horace Gray, in the Supreme Court's opinion in the 1898 citizenship case United States v.

Wong Kim Ark, 169 U.S. 649, 701 (1898). Twentieth century rulingsMissouri v. Holland= Oliver Wendell Holmes' opinion in Missouri v. Holland was cited as a justification of the Bricker Amendment. The precedent most often cited by critics of \\"treaty law\\" was Missouri v. Holland.Missouri v. Holland, 252 U.S. 416 (1920). Congress had attempted to protect migratory birds by statute,An Act Making Appropriations for the Department of Agriculture for the Fiscal Year Ending June 30, 1914, Act of March 4, 1913, 38 Stat. 828, c. 145, at page 847. but federal and state courts declared the law unconstitutional.United States v. Shauver, 214 Fed. 154 (E.D. Ark. 1914), United States v. McCullagh, 221 Fed. 288 (D.Kan. 1915), State v. Sawyer, 94 A. 886 (Maine 1915), and State v. McCullagh, 153 P. 557 (Kan. 557). The United States subsequently negotiated and ratified a treaty with Canada to achieve the same purpose,Convention for the Protection of Migratory Birds of August 16, 1916, T.S. No. 628, 39 Stat. 1702. Congress then passed the Migratory Bird Treaty Act of 1918 to enforce it.Migratory Bird Treaty Act, Act of July 3, 1918, c. 128, 40 Stat. 755. Codified at 18 U.S.C.¬ß703. In Missouri v. Holland, the United States Supreme Court upheld the constitutionality of the new law. Justice Oliver Wendell Holmes, writing for the Court, declared: > Acts of Congress are the supreme law of the land only when made in pursuance > of the Constitution, while treaties are declared to be so when made under > the authority of the United States.

Proponents of the Bricker Amendment said this language made it essential to add to the Constitution explicit limitations on the treaty-making power. Raymond Moley wrote in 1953 that Holland meant \\"the protection of an international duck takes precedence over the constitutional protections of American citizens\\".Raymond Moley, Newsweek, August 10, 1953. 88. In response, legal scholars such as Professor Edward Samuel Corwin of Princeton University said the language of the Constitution regarding treaties‚Äî\\"under the authority of the United States\\"‚Äîwas misunderstood by Holmes, and was written to protect the 1783 peace treaty with Britain; this became \\"in part the source of Senator Bricker's agitation\\".Edward Samuel Corwin. The President: Office and Powers, 1787‚Äì1957. 4th ed. New York: New York University Press, 1957. 421. Quoted in Yong-nok Koo. Politics of Dissent in U.S. Foreign Policy: A Political Analysis of the Movement for the Bricker Amendment. Seoul: American Studies Institute at Seoul National University, 1978. 56‚Äì57. Professor Zechariah Chafee of Harvard Law School wrote, \\"the Framers never talked about having treaties on the same level as the Constitution. What they did want was to make sure a state could no longer flout any lawful action taken by the nation\\". Chafee claimed that the word \\"Supreme\\", as used in Article VI, simply meant \\"supreme over the states\\".Zechariah Chafee Jr., \\"Bricker Proposal Opposed\\" (Letter), New York Times, January 28, 1954. 26. =Belmont and Pink= President Franklin D. Roosevelt (center) at Yalta in 1945, where he made an agreement with Winston Churchill and Joseph Stalin which was asserted to show the need for a constitutional amendment. Two additional cases frequently cited by proponents of the Amendment were both related to the Roosevelt Administration's recognition of the Soviet government in 1933. In the course of recognizing the USSR, letters were exchanged with the Soviet Union's foreign minister, Maxim Litvinov, to settle claims between the two countries, in an agreement neither sent to the Senate nor ratified by it. In United States v. Belmont the constitutionality of executive agreements was tested in the Supreme Court.United States v. Belmont, 301 U.S. 324 (1937). Justice George Sutherland, writing for the majority, upheld the power of the president, finding: > That the negotiations, acceptance of the assignment and agreements and > understandings in respect thereof were within the competence of the > President may not be doubted. Governmental power over external affairs is > not distributed, but is vested exclusively in the national government. And > in respect of what was done here, the Executive had authority to speak as > the sole organ of that government. The assignment and the agreements in > connection therewith did not, as in the case of treaties, as that term is > used in the treaty making clause of the Constitution (article 2, 2), require > the advice and consent of the Senate.United States v. Belmont, 301 U.S. 324 > (1937) at 330. A second case from the Litvinov Agreement, United States v. Pink, also went to the Supreme Court.United States v. Pink, 315 U.S. 203 (1942) . In Pink, the New York State superintendent of insurance was ordered to turn over assets belonging to a Russian insurance company pursuant to the Litvinov assignment. The United States sued New York to claim the money held by the Insurance Superintendent, and lost in lower courts. However, the Supreme Court held New York was interfering with the President's exclusive power over foreign affairs, independent of any language in the Constitution, a doctrine it enunciated in United States v. Curtiss-Wright Export Corp.United States v. Curtiss-Wright Export Corp., 299 U.S. 304 (1936), and ordered New York to pay the money to the Federal Government. The Court declared that \\"the Fifth Amendment does not stand in the way of giving full force and effect to the Litvinov Assignment\\"United States v. Pink. 315 U.S. 203 (1942) at 228. and > The powers of the President in the conduct of foreign relations included the > power, without consent of the Senate, to determine the public policy of the > United States with respect to the Russian nationalization decrees. What > government is to be regarded here as representative of a foreign sovereign > state is a political rather than a judicial question, and is to be > determined by the political department of the government. That authority is > not limited to a determination of the government to be recognized. It > includes the power to determine the policy which is to govern the question > of recognition. Objections to the underlying policy as well as objections to > recognition are to be addressed to the political department and not to the > courts.United States v. Pink, 315 U.S. 203 (1942) at 229, internal > quotations and citations omitted. =Rulings during Congressional debate= Unlike in Pink and Belmont, an executive agreement on potato imports from Canada, litigated in United States v. Guy W. Capps, Inc., another oft cited case, the courts declared an agreement unenforceable.United States v. Guy W. Capps, Inc., 100 F.Supp. 30 (E.D. Va. 1952), affirmed 204 F.2d. 655 (4th 1953), affirmed 348 U.S. 296 (1955) In Capps the courts found that the agreement, which directly contradicted a statute passed by Congress, could not be enforced. But the dissent of Chief Justice Fred M. Vinson in Youngstown Sheet & Tube Co. v. Sawyer (commonly referred to as the \\"steel seizure case\\") alarmed conservatives. President Harry S. Truman had nationalized the American steel industry to prevent a strike he claimed would interfere with the prosecution of the Korean War. Though the United States Supreme Court found this illegal, Vinson's defense of this sweeping exercise of executive authority was used to justify the Bricker Amendment.Youngstown Sheet & Tube Co. v. Sawyer, 343 U.S. 579, 667‚Äì709 (1952) (Vinson, C.J., dissenting). Those warning of \\"treaty law\\" claimed that in the future, Americans could be endangered with the use of the executive powers Vinson supported. =State precedents= Some state courts issued rulings in the 1940s and 1950s that relied on the United Nations Charter, much to the alarm of Holman and others. In Fujii v. California, a California law restricting the ownership of land by aliens was ruled by a state appeals court to be a violation of the UN Charter.Fujii v. State, 217 P.2d 481 (Cal. App. 2d 1950), rehearing denied 218 P.2d 596 (Cal. App. 2d 1950), reversed 242 P.2d 617 (1952). In Fujii, the Court declared \\"The Charter has become 'the supreme Law of the Land... any Thing in the Constitution of Laws of any State to the Contrary notwithstanding.' The position of this country in the family of nations forbids trafficking innocuous generalities but demands that every State in the Union accept and act upon the Charter according to its plain language and its unmistakable purpose and intent.\\"Fujii v. State, 217 P.2d 481, 486 (Cal. App. 2d. 1950). However, the California Supreme Court overruled, declaring that while the Charter was \\"entitled to respectful consideration by the courts and Legislatures of every member nation,\\" it was \\"not intended to supersede existing domestic legislation.\\"Fujii v. State, 242 P.2d 617, 622 (Cal. 1952) Similarly, a New York trial court refused to consider the U.N. Charter in an effort to strike down racially restrictive covenants in housing, declaring \\"these treaties have nothing to do with domestic matters,\\" citing Article 2, Section 7 of the Charter.Kemp v. Rubin, 69 N.Y.S.2d 680, 686 (Sup. Ct. Queens 1947). In another covenant case, the Michigan Supreme Court discounted efforts to use the Charter, saying \\"these pronouncements are merely indicative of a desirable social trend and an objective devoutly to be desired by all well-thinking peoples.\\"Sipes v. McGhee, 316 Mich. 615, 628 (1947). These words were quoted with approval by the Iowa Supreme Court in overturning a lower court decision that relied on the Charter, noting the Charter's principles \\"do not have the force or effect of superseding our laws.\\"Rice v. Sioux City Memorial Park Cemetery, Inc., 245 Iowa 147, 60 N.W.2d 110, 116‚Äì117 (1954) Internationalization and the United Nations John Foster Dulles said restrictions were needed on treaties, until he became Secretary of State in the Eisenhower Administration.Following the Second World War, various treaties were proposed under the aegis of the United Nations, in the spirit of collective security and internationalism that followed the global conflict of the preceding years. In particular, the Genocide Convention, which made a crime of \\"causing serious mental harm\\" to \\"a national, ethnic, racial, or religious group\\" and the Universal Declaration of Human Rights, which contained sweeping language about health care, employment, vacations, and other subjects outside the traditional scope of treaties, were considered problematic by non-interventionists and advocates of limited government. Historian Stephen Ambrose described the suspicions of Americans: \\"Southern leaders feared that the U.N. commitment to human rights would imperil segregation; the American Medical Association feared it would bring about socialized medicine.\\"Stephen E. Ambrose. Eisenhower, Volume 2: The President. New York: Simon & Schuster, 1984. 68. It was, the American Bar Association declared, \\"one of the greatest constitutional crises the country has ever faced.\\"\\"The Bricker Amendment: A Cure Worse Than the Disease?\\" Time. July 13, 1953. 20‚Äì21. Conservatives were worried that these treaties could be used to expand the power of the Federal government at the expense of the people and the states. In a speech to the American Bar Association's regional meeting at Louisville, Kentucky on April 11, 1952, John Foster Dulles, an American delegate to the United Nations, said, \\"Treaties make international law and they also make domestic law. Under our Constitution, treaties become the Supreme Law of the Land. They are indeed more supreme than ordinary laws, for Congressional laws are invalid if they do not conform to the Constitution, whereas treaty laws can override the Constitution.\\" Dulles said the power to make treaties \\"is an extraordinary power liable to abuse.\\" Senator Everett Dirksen, a Republican of Illinois, declared, \\"we are in a new era of international organizations. They are grinding out treaties like so many eager beavers which will have effects on the rights of American citizens.\\" Eisenhower's Attorney General Herbert Brownell admitted executive agreements \\"had sometimes been abused in the past.\\"Herbert Brownell and John P. Burke. Advising Ike: The Memoirs of Attorney General Herbert Brownell. Lawrence, Kansas: University Press of Kansas, 1993. 264. Frank E. Holman wrote Secretary of State George Marshall in November 1948 regarding the dangers of the Human Rights Declaration, receiving the dismissive reply that the agreement was \\"merely declaratory in character\\" and had no legal effect.Tananbaum, 10. The conservative ABA called for a Constitutional amendment to address what they perceived to be a potential abuse of executive power. Holman described the threat: > More or less coincident with the organization of the United Nations a new > form of internationalism arose which undertook to enlarge the historical > concept of international law and treaties to have them include and deal with > the domestic affairs and internal laws of independent nations.Frank E. > Holman. The Story of the \\"Bricker Amendment.\\" New York City: Fund for > Constitutional Government, 1954. viii. Senator Bricker thought the \\"one world\\" movement advocated by those such as Wendell Willkie, Roosevelt's Republican challenger in the 1940 election, would attempt to use treaties to undermine American liberties. Conservatives cited as evidence the statement of John P. Humphrey, the first director of the United Nations Commission on Human Rights: > What the United Nations is trying to do is revolutionary in character. Human > rights are largely a matter of [the] relationship between the State and > individuals, and therefore a matter which has been traditionally regarded as > being within the domestic jurisdiction of states. What is now being proposed > is, in effect, the creation of some super national supervision of this > relationship.Frank E. Holman. The Story of the \\"Bricker Amendment.\\" New York > City: Fund for Constitutional Government, 1954. 6. Holman said the > Commission was \\"controlled by Communists and international socialists.\\" > Story, 71. Frank E. Holman testified before the Senate Judiciary Committee that the Bricker Amendment was needed \\"to eliminate the risk that through 'treaty law' our basic American rights may be bargained away in attempts to show our good neighborliness and to indicate to the rest of the world our spirit of brotherhood.\\"Tananbaum, 54. W.L. McGrath, president of the Williamson Heater Company in Cincinnati, Ohio, told the Senate that the International Labour Organization, to which he had been an American delegate, was \\"seeking to set itself up as a sort of international legislature to formulate socialistic laws which it hopes, by the vehicle of treaty ratification, can essentially be imposed upon most of the countries of the world.\\" Congress considers the proposal President Dwight D. Eisenhower thought the Bricker Amendment would undermine American foreign policy and worked to defeat it. Republican Senator John W. Bricker, an attorney, had served as governor of Ohio and was Thomas E. Dewey's running mate in the 1944 campaign before winning a Senate seat in the 1946 Republican landslide. Author Robert Caro declared Senator Bricker to be \\"a fervent admirer\\" of Senators Robert A. Taft of Ohio, \\"whom he had three times backed for the presidential nomination,\\" and Joseph McCarthy of Wisconsin, \\"whom he would support to the last,\\" and stated that Bricker was \\"a fervent hater of foreign aid, the United Nations, and all those he lumped with Eleanor Roosevelt under the contemptuous designation of 'One Worlders'. He was the embodiment of the GOP's \\"Old Guard,\\" borne out by his voting record: Americans for Democratic Action gave him a \\"zero\\" rating in 1949.Caro, 528; Tananbaum, 22‚Äì23. However, Bricker was not a doctrinaire non-interventionist; he had voted in favor of the Marshall Plan and the North Atlantic Treaty. President Eisenhower disagreed about the necessity of the Amendment, writing in his diary in April 1953, \\"Senator Bricker wants to amend the Constitution . . . By and large the logic of the case is all against Senator Bricker, but he has gotten almost psychopathic on the subject, and a great many lawyers have taken his side of the case. This fact does not impress me very much. Lawyers have been trained to take either side of any case and make the most intelligent and impassioned defense of their adopted viewpoint.\\"Dwight D. Eisenhower. The Eisenhower Diaries. Edited by Robert H. Ferrell. New York: W.W. Norton, 1981. Entry for April 1, 1953, on page 233. Historians describe the Bricker Amendment as \\"the high water mark of the non-interventionist surge in the 1950s\\" and \\"the embodiment of the Old Guard's rage at what it viewed as twenty years of presidential usurpation of Congress's constitutional powers\\" which \\"grew out of sentiment both anti-Democrat and anti-presidential.\\"Robert Caro.

Knopf, 1985. 178‚Äì179. Bricker's pressing the issue, wrote Time just before the climactic vote, was \\"a time-bomb threat to both G.O.P. unity and White House-Congressional accord.\\"\\"On Their Knees\\" Time. January 18, 1954. 20. Senator Bricker warned \\"the constitutional power of Congress to determine American foreign policy is at stake.\\"LaFeber, 179. 82nd Congress In the 82nd Congress, Senator Bricker introduced the first version of his amendment, S.J. Res. 102, drafted by Bricker and his staff. The American Bar Association was still studying the issue of how to prevent an abuse of \\"treaty law\\" when Bricker introduced his resolution on July 17, 1951, without the ABA's involvement, but the Senator wanted to begin immediate debate on an issue he considered vital.Tananbaum, 25. Bricker was not trying to reverse the Yalta Agreement, in contrast to the goals of some of his conservative colleagues; he was worried most about what might be done by the United Nations or under an executive agreement.Tananbaum, 35. A second proposal, S.J. Res 130, was introduced by Bricker on February 7, 1952, with fifty-eight co-sponsors, including every Republican except Eugene Millikin of Colorado.Tananbaum, 42 President Harry S. Truman was adamantly opposed to limitations on executive power and ordered every executive branch agency to report on how the Bricker Amendment would affect its work and to offer this information to the Judiciary Committee.Harry S. Truman. \\"Memorandum on Proposed Bills Dealing With Treaties and Executive Agreements.\\" May 23, 1953. Public Papers of the Presidents of the United States: Harry S. Truman, 1952‚Äì1953. Washington: United States Government Printing Office. 367. Available on-line here (accessed May 2, 2006). Consequently, in its hearings, the Committee heard from representatives of the Departments of Agriculture, Commerce, Defense, Labor, and the Post Office, along with the Bureau of Internal Revenue, the Securities and Exchange Commission, and the Federal Bureau of Narcotics.Tananbaum, 58. Duane Tananbaum wrote the hearings \\"provided the amendment's supporters with a wider forum for their argument that a constitutional amendment was needed\\" and gave opponents a chance to debate the issue.Tananbaum, 60. Bricker's amendment was raised as an issue in his 1952 re-election campaign. Toledo mayor Michael DiSalle railed that the amendment was \\"an unwarranted interference with the provisions of the Constitution,\\" but Bricker was easily elected to a second term.Tananbaum, 64. 83rd Congress: Consideration by the new Republican majority Bricker introduced his proposal, S.J. Res 1, on the first day of the 83rd Congress and soon had sixty-three co-sponsors on a resolution much closer to the language of the amendment proposed by the American Bar Association. This time, every Republican senator, including Millikin, was a co-sponsor, as were eighteen Democrats. Including Bricker, this totaled exactly the sixty-four votes that comprised two-thirds of the full Senate, the number necessary to approve a constitutional amendment. Companion measures were introduced in the United States House of Representatives, but no action was taken on them; the focus was on the Senate. The Eisenhower Administration was caught by surprise as Sherman Adams, Eisenhower's Chief of Staff, thought an agreement had been reached with Bricker to delay introduction of his amendment until after the Administration had studied the issue. \\"Bricker hoped to force the new administration's hand,\\" wrote Duane Tananbaum.Caro, 528; Tananbaum, 67‚Äì69. George E. Reedy, aide to Senate minority leader Lyndon B. Johnson of Texas, said popular support for the measure made it \\"apparent from the start that it could not be defeated on a straight-out vote. No one could vote against the Bricker Amendment with impunity and very few could vote against it and survive at all . . . There was no hope of stopping it through direct opposition.\\"Caro, 528. Johnson told his aide Bobby Baker it was \\"the worst bill I can think of\\" and \\"it will be the bane of every president we elect.\\" Eisenhower privately disparaged Bricker's motives, suggesting Bricker's push for the Amendment was driven by \\"his one hope of achieving at least a faint immortality in American history,\\"Eisenhower, diary entry for July 24, 1953, page 248. and considered the Amendment entirely unnecessary, telling Stephen Ambrose it was \\"an addition to the Constitution that said you could not violate the Constitution.\\" Eisenhower seeks delay Eisenhower publicly stated his opposition in his press conference of March 26, 1953: \\"The Bricker Amendment, as analyzed for me by the Secretary of State, would, as I understand it, in certain ways restrict the authority that the President must have, if he is to conduct the foreign affairs of this Nation effectively. . . . I do believe that there are certain features that would work to the disadvantage of our country, particularly in making it impossible for the President to work with the flexibility that he needs in this highly complicated and difficult situation.\\"Dwight D. Eisenhower. \\"The President's News Conference of March 26, 1953.\\" Public Papers of the Presidents of the United States: Dwight D. Eisenhower, 1953. Washington: United States Government Printing Office. Available on-line here (accessed May 2, 2006). Eisenhower's phrasing, \\"as analyzed for me by the Secretary of State,\\" led Bricker and other conservatives to blame Dulles for misleading Eisenhower, and raised their suspicion that the Secretary of State was a tool of Eastern internationalist interests. Eisenhower sent Attorney General Herbert Brownell to meet with Bricker to try to delay consideration of the resolution while the administration studied it; Bricker refused, noting his original proposal was introduced over a year earlier in the previous session of Congress.Tananbaum, 73. Bricker was willing, however, to compromise on the language of an amendment, unlike Frank Holman, who was intent on a particular wording. However, the administration, particularly Dulles, irritated Bricker by refusing to offer an alternative to his resolution.Tananbaum, 77. Eisenhower privately continued to disparage the Amendment with strong language, calling it \\"a stupid blind violation of the Constitution by stupid, blind non- interventionists\\" and stating \\"if it is true that when you die the name of the things that bothered you the most are engraved on your skull, I'm sure I'll have there the mud and dirt of France during the invasion and the name of Senator Bricker.\\"Geoffrey C. Perrett. Eisenhower. New York: Random House, 1999. 485‚Äì487. Republican infighting Sherman Adams wrote \\"Eisenhower thus found himself caught in a crossfire between the Republican conservatives and the State Department\\"Adams, 106. and stated President Eisenhower thought the Bricker Amendment was a refusal of America \\"to accept the leadership of world democracy that had been thrust upon it.\\"Sherman Adams. Firsthand Report: The Story of the Eisenhower Administration. New York: Harper and Brothers, 1961. 104. In 1954, Eisenhower wrote Senate majority leader William F. Knowland of California stating, \\"Adoption of the Bricker Amendment in its present form by the Senate would be notice to our friends as well as our enemies abroad that our country intends to withdraw from its leadership in world affairs.\\" Adams, 104. The text of the January 25 letter is available online here . Despite the Amendment's popularity and large number of sponsors, Majority Leader Taft stalled the bill itself in the Judiciary Committee at the behest of President Eisenhower. However, on June 10, ill health led Taft to resign as Majority Leader, and five days later, the Judiciary Committee reported the measure to the full Senate.Caro, 530. No action was taken before the session adjourned in August; debate would begin in January 1954. The long delay allowed opposition to mobilize. Erwin Griswold, dean of the Harvard Law School, and Owen Roberts, retired Justice of the United States Supreme Court, organized the Committee for the Defense of the Constitution.Geoffrey C. Perrett. Eisenhower. New York: Random House, 1999. 487. They were joined by such prominent Americans as attorney John W. Davis,Davis, United States Solicitor General under Woodrow Wilson, orchestrated the passage of the Migratory Bird Treaty (the treaty at issue in Missouri v. Holland) after the statute protecting birds was found unconstitutional. former Attorney General William D. Mitchell, former Secretary of War Kenneth C. Royall, former First Lady Eleanor Roosevelt, Governor Adlai Stevenson, former President Harry S. Truman, Judge John J. Parker, Supreme Court Justice Felix Frankfurter, Denver Post publisher Palmer Hoyt, the Reverend Harry Emerson Fosdick, socialist Norman Thomas, and General Lucius D. Clay. The Committee claimed the Amendment would give Congress too much power and make America's system to approve treaties \\"the most cumbersome in the world.\\"Dwight D. Eisenhower. The White House Years: Mandate for Change, 1953‚Äì1956. Garden City, New York: Doubleday, 1963. 283. Roberts dismissed the Amendment, declaring \\"we must decide whether we are to stand on the silly shibboleth of national security,\\" a statement supporters of the Amendment eagerly seized upon. The Committee was joined in opposing the Amendment by the League of Women Voters, the American Association for the United Nations, and the Association of the Bar of the City of New York, one of the few bar associations to oppose the Amendment.Sherman Adams. Firsthand Report: The Story of the Eisenhower Administration. New York: Harper and Brothers, 1961. 106. Conservatives Clarence Manion, former dean of the University of Notre Dame Law School, and newspaper publisher Frank Gannett formed organizations to support the Amendment while a wide spectrum of groups entered the debate. Supporting the Bricker Amendment were the National Association of Attorneys General, the American Legion, the Veterans of Foreign Wars, the Marine Corps League, National Sojourners, the Catholic War Veterans, the Kiwanis, the U.S. Chamber of Commerce, the National Grange, the American Farm Bureau Federation, the Daughters of the American Revolution, The Colonial Dames of America, the National Association of Evangelicals, the American Medical Association, the General Federation of Women's Clubs, and the Association of American Physicians and Surgeons. In opposition were Americans for Democratic Action, the American Jewish Congress, the American Federation of Labor, B'nai B'rith, the United World Federalists, the American Civil Liberties Union, and the American Association of University Women: groups that Holman characterized as \\"eastern seaboard internationalists.\\"Frank E. Holman. The Story of the \\"Bricker Amendment.\\" New York City: Fund for Constitutional Government, 1954. 17, 23. Eisenhower aided by Democrats Senator Lyndon B. Johnson helped President Eisenhower defeat the Bricker Amendment.Faced with essentially united opposition from his own Party's Senate caucus, Eisenhower needed the help of Democrats to defeat the Amendment. Caro summarized the problem: \\"Defeating the amendment and thereby preserving the power of the presidency‚Äîhis first objective‚Äîcould not be accomplished even if he united his party's liberal and moderate senators against it; there simply were not enough of them. He would have to turn conservative Senators against it too, conservatives who were at the moment wholeheartedly for it‚Äîand not just Democratic conservatives but at least a few members of the Republican Old Guard.\\"Caro, 531. President Eisenhower continued his opposition. In January, he claimed that the Bricker Amendment would fatally weaken the bargaining position of the United States because the states would be involved in foreign policy, recalling the divisions under the Articles of Confederation.Dwight D. Eisenhower. \\"The President's News Conference of January 13, 1954.\\" Public Papers of the Presidents of the United States: Dwight D. Eisenhower, 1954. Washington: United States Government Printing Office. 132. Available on-line here (accessed June 28, 2006). Before the Second Session of the 83rd Congress convened, the Amendment \\"went through a complex and incomprehensible series of changes as various Senators struggled to find a precise wording that would satisfy both the President and Bricker.\\" In fact, President Eisenhower himself in January 1954 said that nobody understood the Bricker Amendment, but his position \\"was clear; he opposed any amendment that would reduce the President's power to conduct foreign policy.\\"Stephen E. Ambrose. Eisenhower, Volume 2: The President. New York: Simon & Schuster, 1984. 154. In his opposition to the Amendment, Eisenhower obtained the help of Senate Minority Leader Lyndon B. Johnson, who persuaded Senator Walter F. George of Georgia to sponsor his own proposal in order to sap support from Senator Bricker's. The George Substitute introduced on January 27, 1954, especially infuriated Bricker since George also wanted limits on treaties.Caro, 533‚Äì534. George warned in the Senate, \\"I do not want a president of the U.S. to conclude an executive agreement which will make it unlawful for me to kill a cat in the back alley of my lot at night and I do not want the President of the U.S. to make a treaty with India which would preclude me from butchering a cow in my own pasture.\\"\\"Cats, Cows, Pigeons, Fleas.\\" Time. February 22, 1954. 28. Senator George was ideal as an opponent as he was a hero to conservatives of both parties for his opposition to the New Deal and his survival of President Franklin D. Roosevelt's unsuccessful effort to purge him when he sought re- election in 1938. \\"Democrats and Republicans alike respected him and recognized his influence.\\"Tananbaum, 144. Eisenhower worked to prevent a vote, telling Republican Senators that he agreed that President Roosevelt had done things he would not have done, but that the Amendment would not have prevented the Yalta Agreement. By the time the Senate finally voted on the Bricker Amendment on February 26, thirteen of the nineteen Democrats who had co- sponsored it had withdrawn their support, at the urging of Senators Johnson and George.Caro, 536. The original version of S.J. Res. 1 failed 42‚Äì50. By a 61-30 vote, the Senate agreed to substitute George's language for Bricker's‚Äî if only ninety-one senators voted, sixty-one was the necessary two-thirds vote for final approval. Senator Herbert H. Lehman of New York said in the debate \\"what we are doing is one of the most dangerous and inexcusable things that any great legislative body can do.\\"Caro, 538. However, Johnson had planned carefully and had several votes in reserve. When revised Amendments came to a vote, with Vice President Richard Nixon presiding over the Senate, Senator Harley M. Kilgore of West Virginia arrived to cast the deciding vote of \\"nay.\\" The measure was defeated 60-31. In the final count, thirty-two Republicans voted for the revised Bricker Amendment and fourteen voted against.Caro, 539. Senator Bricker was embittered by the defeat. \\"By the mid-1950s,\\" wrote the Senator's biographer, \\"Bricker had become alienated from the mainstream of his own party... fulminating on the far right of the political spectrum.\\" Decades after his defeat he was still furious. \\"Ike did it!\\" he said. \\"He killed my amendment.\\"Richard O. Davies. \\"John W. Bricker and the Slow Death of Old Guard Republicanism.\\" Chapter 21 of Builders of Ohio: A Biographical History. Edited by Warren Van Tine and Michael Pierce.

Eisenhower made defeating the amendment a high priority.Duane A. Tananbaum, \\"The Bricker Amendment Controversy: Its Origins and Eisenhower's Role.\\" Diplomatic History 9.1 (1985): 73-93. However to secure enough Republican votes he had to abandon American support for the UN human rights initiative.Tony Evans, \\"Hegemony, domestic politics and the project of universal human rights.\\" Diplomacy and Statecraft 6.3 (1995): 616-644. This episode proved to be the last hurrah for the isolationist Republicans, as the younger conservatives increasingly turned to an internationalism based on aggressive anti-communism, typified by Senator Barry Goldwater.Cathal J. Nolan, \\"The Last Hurrah of Conservative Isolationism: Eisenhower, Congress, and the Bricker Amendment, Presidential Studies Quarterly 22#2 (1992) pp. 337-349 in JSTOR. Senator Bricker introduced another proposal later in the 83rd Congress and proposed similar constitutional amendments in the 84th and 85th Congresses. While hearings were held in the 84th and 85th Congresses, the full Senate took no action and the idea of amending the Constitution was never again seriously considered. In part, this was because the Supreme Court issued rulings that undercut arguments for it, notably in Reid v. Covert. The Supreme Court in 1957 declared that the United States could not abrogate the rights guaranteed to citizens in the Bill of Rights through international agreements. Reid v. Covert and Kinsella v. Krueger concerned the prosecution of two servicemen's wives who killed their husbands abroad and were, under the status of forces agreementsSee Administrative Agreement Under Article III of the Security Treaty Between the United States of America and Japan.

Covert, 351 U.S. 378 (1956) and Kinsella v. Krueger, 351 U.S. 370 (1956), both reversed on rehearing as Reid v. Covert, 354 U.S. 1 (1957). See also: Frederick Bernays Wiener. Civilians Under Military Justice: The British Practice Since 1689, Especially in North America. Chicago: University of Chicago Press, 1967. Wiener argued Reid and Kinsella before the Supreme Court on behalf of the convicted women. The Court found the Congress had no constitutional authority to subject servicemen's dependents to the Uniform Code of Military Justice and overturned the convictions. Justice Hugo Black's opinion for the Court declared: In Seery v. United States the government argued that an executive agreement allowed it to confiscate property in Austria owned by an American citizen without compensation.Seery v. United States, 127 F. Supp. 601 (Ct. Claims. 1955). See also Seery v. United States, 161 F. Supp. 395 (Ct. Claims 1958). But this was rejected, the Court of Claims writing \\"we think that there can be no doubt that an executive agreement, not being a transaction which is even mentioned in the Constitution, cannot impair constitutional rights.\\"Seery v. United States, 127 F. Supp. 601, 606 (Ct. Claims. 1955). The United States ultimately ratified the U.N.'s Genocide Convention in 1986.Convention on the prevention and punishment of the crime of genocide. Adopted by the U.N. General Assembly at Paris December 9, 1948. The enabling legislation was the Genocide Convention Implementation Act of 1987, also known as the Proxmire Act, Pub. L. 100‚Äì606, Act of November 4, 1988, 102 Stat. 3045, codified as et seq. The Convention was signed with reservations, which prevented the law being enacted if it contradicted the Constitution. Several states expressed concern that this would undermine the provisions of the convention. The Bricker Amendment is occasionally revived in Congress. For example, in 1997, Representative Helen Chenoweth (R‚ÄìIdaho) offered her version of the Bricker Amendment in the 105th Congress. See also * Presidency of Dwight D.

The story is based on the Middle English romance Sir Gawain and the Green Knight. The opera was a commission from the Royal Opera House, London, where it was first performed on 30 May 1991.Bye, Antony, \\"Birtwistle's Gawain\\" (May 1991). The Musical Times, 132 (1779): pp. 231, 233.Samuels, Robert, \\"First Performances: Birtwistle's Gawain\\" (September 1991). Tempo (New Ser.), 178: pp. 32-33. Rhian Samuel has published a detailed analysis of the opera.Samuel. Rhian, \\"Birtwistle's Gawain: An Essay and a Diary\\" (July 1992). Cambridge Opera Journal, 4 (2): pp. 163-178. Birtwistle revised it in 1994, and the premiere of the revised version was given at the Royal Opera House on 20 April 1994.Adlington, Robert, \\"Birtwistle: Gawain\\" (1994). The Musical Times, 135 (1817): p. 463. Music The plot of Gawain is ideally suited to Birtwistle's approach to musical structure. The repetitious structure of events can be paralleled with a repetitious musical structure. Thus the three hunts in Act 2 use the same musical material, as do the three seductions. The music is varied and adapted every time it is heard, but inner coherence is easily established. The synopsis also indicates many points where recurring motifs are heard: trios of door knocks; the return to the Arthurian court at the end of the opera with the same mood of boredom seen at the beginning; the members of the court gradually recovering from Gawain the items they gave him at the end of act 1. Thus, though the opera is not written with many explicit numbers (i.e. the arias and ensemble pieces characteristic of Classical opera), nor with strongly defined leitmotif in the style of Wagner, there is an overall unity of musical material. There are many occasions when one character will simply repeat one line of text always set it to the same melodic phrase, but this is not the same as using a leitmotif. It does, however, fit well with Birtwistle's standard style of continual variation in the midst of repetition. The conductor Elgar Howarth has arranged the orchestral suite Gawain's Journey from music in the opera.Warnaby, John, \\"Birtwistle at Full Blast\\" (September 1993).

The knights of Arthur's court, along with the Bishop and the fool, are gathered for the celebration. Also present, but invisible to the rest, are Morgan Le Fay and Lady de Hautdesert, who are conspiring to bring down Arthur. Arthur is bored, and asks for someone to demonstrate his courage. Instead, the fool posits a series of identity riddles, while Morgan Le Fay promises him entertainment soon enough. There is a knock at the door, but when opened, no one is there. After another riddle, the knock is heard again, and as before the door opens to reveal no one. After the third knock, the doors open to reveal the Green Knight, who rides into the court. The Knight insults Arthur by asking which member of the court is king. Arthur's knights rush to avenge his honour, but the Green Knight rebuffs them. He is not dressed for combat, but offers instead a challenge: he will accept a blow from his axe that will sever his head, on condition that he may inflict an identical blow in a year and a day's time. While the Bishop chants protections from witchcraft, the court is confused. The Knight reiterates on its terms, and declares that he has come in search of a hero, someone brave enough to take up his challenge. He continues to insult Arthur and the court by declaring that they lack the courage. Arthur is about to accept the challenge when Gawain takes the axe. After they agree, the Knight kneels before Gawain. The present action cuts at this point. When the scene is revealed, it is at the point directly before the Knight's first entrance. The prior action repeats, much compressed and without the discussion. The still unseen Morgan Le Fay and Lady de Hautdesert sing of their plan, focused on provoking Arthur's vanity. The Knight once again kneels before Gawain, who now decapitates him. Instead of dying, the Knight continues to live. The body picks up the head, which now gives Gawain his instructions on where to come for the return blow. Gawain must travel to the north, to the Green Chapel, the instructions echoing as the Knight rides out of the court. Arthur tries to downplay the event, claiming that it was all a Mummers Play. But the axe has been left, and is hung on the wall for all to see. The act ends with an abstract representation of the passing of the year. The court prepares Gawain for his travel and ordeal as the seasons pass. He is provided with armour, as the Bishop blesses the venture. Through it all, Morgan Le Fay continues to chant her one line: 'Now with a single step, your journey starts'. (In the first edition of the opera, this passing of the year took over half an hour. The second version substantially reduced that duration. A third version restores it.) Act 2 Scene 1 The act opens with a new vision on Gawain's year of preparation. This time he is alone, taunted by the (still invisible) Morgan Le Fay. This time it is Gawain who has the repeated single line: \\"Cross of Christ, save me!\\" He sets off on his journey north. Scene 2 The scene shifts to the home of Bertilak and Lady de Hautdesert. They await Gawain's arrival, singing lines of text drawn from Morgan Le Fay's taunting. Gawain arrives, but must knock three times before they answer the door. Bertilak and his wife welcome him warmly, pleased to have a guest from Arthur's court for Christmas to teach them genteel court customs. Gawain refuses, saying that he must travel until he finds the Green Chapel. Bertilak informs him that it lies not two miles from where they are already, so that he may rest with his journey almost over. Gawain is to view everything in Bertilak's home as if it were his own. When he states that his wife will keep Gawain company while he himself is out hunting, Bertilak is struck with jealousy and suspicion. On the verge of revealing the charade, he offers a pact with Gawain. Bertilak will spend each day out hunting, and will give Gawain whatever he has acquired from the day; in return, Gawain is to give Bertilak whatever he has gained. Confused over quite what he could gain, Gawain nevertheless agrees to the pact. The following day, while her husband is out hunting, Lady de Hautdesert comes to Gawain's private chamber. She attempts to seduce him, and commands him to take her. This puts Gawain in a dilemma, with the conflict between obeying the commands of a lady and not committing adultery. He tries to avoid her pursuit of him, but she finally kisses him. In the meantime, Bertilak kills a stag. Bertilak returns with his catch, giving it to Gawain. In return, Gawain kisses Bertilak. Bertilak wants to know how Gawain came by such a trophy, but Gawain insists that this was not part of the bargain. The next day repeats this scenario. Again Gawain is hunted by the lady, who this time kisses him twice; again Bertilak kills his quarry; again Bertilak and Gawain exchange trophies, this time entailing two kisses. The third day continues much as before. Lady de Hautdesert intensifies her seduction of Gawain, dressing skimpily. Gawain is helpless before her, mutely accepting three kisses from her. Then she offers him the sash around her waist, indicating that while he wears it nothing can possibly harm him. Mindful of his ordeal later that day, Gawain accepts it. Bertilak kills his fox, and returns home. However, at the exchange, Gawain kisses Bertilak three times, but mentions nothing of the sash. Scene 3 Gawain departs from their home and travels to the Green Chapel. The Green Knight calls Gawain's name from offstage, exactly as he did when he left Camelot a year earlier. Gawain is afraid, but kneels, ready to take the axe blow. However, he ducks away as it comes down. The Knight is angry, demanding to know if it is truly Gawain he is dealing with. Gawain prepares for another swing, but this time the Green Knight stops short. This time it is Gawain that is angry, demanding that the Green Knight keep the pact as agreed. At the third swing, the knight merely grazes Gawain's neck with a superficial wound. Gawain is angrier still. The Knight explains that his actions have been in response to Gawain's treatment of Bertilak. Twice Gawain was scrupulously honest, but the third time he withheld the sash. The Knight understands that 'fear of death' is what made him lie, but also that this is 'not sin enough to die for'. Gawain is not mollified. He demands the Knight take the sash. But the Knight reties it around Gawain, sending him back to Camelot. Morgan Le Fay removes the enchantment that disguised Bertilak as the Green Knight. Her purpose has been served, for she has revealed the hero for the sham that he is. His real journey is about to begin, as he must come to terms with the 'greed, self-love and cowardice' he has demonstrated. Scene 4 The scene is Camelot, as at the start of the opera. Arthur again wants to see a display of courage, and the fool responds with riddles. Two knocks at the door initially reveal no one present, until the third time, when Gawain enters, his identity obscured by his great coat and the snow. The court is overjoyed and wants to hear his tale of heroism. Gawain retorts with an insult to Arthur. As the court settles down, consoling themselves that 'all is as it was, with nothing changed', they help Gawain remove the garments they gave him at the end of Act 1 for his journey. But Gawain continues angry with their presumption that he has been victorious. This alienates the court, and the opera closes with Morgan Le Fay singing of the discord she has sown. The emphasis here is on the flawed hero, revealed to be fearful for his own life and willing to lie and deceive in order to keep it.

As is the case with most other organ works by Bach, the autograph score does not survive. The earliest manuscript copies were probably made in 1719-1727\\\\. The title of the piece in these copies is given, as expected of organ literature of the time, simply as Toccata in C major (or more precisely, Toccata ped: ex C in one source and Toccata ex C pedaliter, referring to the obbligato pedal part).Williams 2003, 150. The piece is an early work, probably composed in the mid-to-late Weimar years, i.e. 1710-1717\\\\. It shares some similarities with other toccatas composed around the same time, such as BWV 538, BWV 540, and others: all show the influence of concerto style and form.Jones 2007, 160. The work begins with an updated and extended form of the old prelude-type, manual passaggio followed by a pedal solo, and a motivic-contrapuntal section. Bach's extended passaggio which opens BWV 564 may have been inspired by Buttstett's preludes; both the rhetorical rests followed by returns to the tonic and the single pedal notes are part of the older tradition as well.Williams 2003, 151-52. The following pedal solo, however, is unique in organ literature: it is the longest known pedal introduction,Williams 2003, 151. reaching far beyond the scope of Bach's models (Buxtehude, B√∂hm, and others) or his own earlier works (e.g. the pedal solo in BWV 549). The full-voiced section that follows elaborates on motives first introduced in the pedal solo. Various scholars have noted how the construction of this first movement is reminiscent of that of a concerto, if the opening manual and pedal passages are taken as \\"solos\\" and the closing contrapuntal section as a \\"tutti\\". The second movement is again in two sections, one marked Adagio and another marked Grave. The insertion of a middle slow movement in an organ work was unusual for Bach, although traces of this idea can be found in other works from the same period: for example, a surviving early version of Prelude and Fugue in C Major, BWV 545, contains a slow Trio, which was removed from the final version, but found its way into one of the late organ trio sonatas, BWV 529.Wolff, Grove. The Adagio is a melody made of short phrases, characteristic of early Bach, over what may be seen as a realized continuo part. The music has been compared to Giuseppe Torelli's Concerto in C major Op. 8 No. 1, but in Bach's oeuvre, this Adagio stands alone and has no parallels. The abundance of Neapolitan sixths and quasi-pizzicato pedal suggests Italian influence.Williams 2003, 153. The Adagio flows seamlessly into the short Grave section, which, through italiante durezze chromatic progressions, enlarged with several instances of diminished seventh chords suspended over the next chord, leads back to the tonic.Williams 2003, 153-54. The third movement is a four-voice fugue in 6/8. It includes a countersubject typical of permutation fugues, which, unusually, engages in dialogue with the subject. Several features of the fugue suggest that it represented a considerable advance for Bach, especially considering that there are middle entries as far as the mediant and the dominant of the dominant.Williams 2003, 154. Somewhat unusually for Bach, the fugue includes very few episodes, the longest being the coda of the piece, which is based on various style bris√© figures. BWV 564 influenced a number of composers both during Bach's lifetime and after his death. Bach's pupil Johann Ludwig Krebs imitated the work in his Prelude and Fugue in C major (leaving out, however, the slow movement), while in the 20th century, Ferruccio Busoni published a transcription of BWV 564 for the piano (1900; one of many Bach transcriptions by the same author), and the work influenced Busoni's own Toccata for Piano (1920).

The site was overhauled and a new name was given to it as the \\"Dragonlance Nexus\\". Beginning on November 28, 2005, the site began publishing articles written by established authors starting with an article on Jaymes Markham by the author Douglas Niles. Other authors have contributed to the Lexicon, such as Nancy Varian Berberick, Mary H. Herbert, Kevin T. Stein, and more recently Jean Rabe. Some of the articles found in the site have been published in the Dragonlance Campaign Setting by Sovereign Press.  Origins  The Dragonlance Nexus traces its origins past 1996, but its current form was launched in January 2001. The origin of the Nexus begins with a small site called \\"the Dragon's Realm.\\" The site was started in the summer of 1996 as an experiment by long-time staff member Matt Haag aka Paladin to learn HTML and to talk about some of the AD&D; Gold Box videogames he was playing at the time. In late 1996, the Dragon's Realm joined the Forgotten Realms Webring. Paladin started one of the first Dragonlance Webrings to highlight his favorite campaign world. Unfortunately, the Dragon's Realm didn't really fit the Dragonlance mold, so a new site called \\"The Lost Citadel\\" was created. Both sites existed in the same 1 MB directory on Geocities. (To put that in perspective, the current version of the Nexus is over 90 times larger.) The Lost Citadel was invited to join an exclusive Dragonlance Webring called the 'Top 5% of Kender Sites,' run by the Sean MacDonald (aka Kipper Snifferdoo), keeper of the Kencyclopedia website. The Lost Citadel continued to expand to cover other areas of Dragonlance material, beyond its traditional magic focus. Eventually, the site was spun off into a new site called \\"The World of Krynn,\\" which went online in November 1997. The following month, the products and Fifth Age sections were added by Paladin, and the site moved off of GeoCities to a dedicated web host. Late the following year, the site's back end was upgraded to support the then-popular Netscape Communicator 4.0 to simplify some of the site's maintenance.  Dragonlance.com era  The World of Krynn was continually expanded and updated, and outgrew several web hosts between December 1997 and August 1999. In addition, the first of several incarnations of the message boards were put online; around this time, other volunteer staff were added to help out with the message boards and some of the site's content. However, the major change happened in 1999, when Paladin acquired the Dragonlance.com domain name from the previous owner in August 1999. At this point, The World of Krynn disappeared and became simply \\"Dragonlance.com.\\" With the move to Dragonlance.com, the site's mission changed as well: instead of publishing a repository of background information, the main focus of the site became more fan-centric, posting artwork, fiction, poetry and music created by the fans, while keeping all of the reference material and product information. In January 2000, the sheer amount of content prompted Paladin to move much of it into a database, which allowed volunteer staff the ability to directly update and add new content. In June of that year, the site was redesigned once again to make the information easier to understand, and new staff members were brought in to help with the growing amount of content. With that, the pre-history of the Nexus ends and its story begins.  Nexus era  The origins of the Nexus date back to January 2001, when a flurry of events were happening at once. Jim Butler, who was an employee of Wizards of the Coast at the time, announced that Wizards of the Coast would no longer publish Dragonlance gaming materials in December 2000. With the backing of famed Dragonlance author Tracy Hickman, a group of fans on the Dragonlance-L mailing list volunteered to create a new Dragonlance site that would take over where Wizards left off, updating Dragonlance to the Dungeons & Dragons 3rd Edition rules. This group came to be known as the Whitestone Council. Under the guidance of Tracy Hickman, and with feedback from fans from across the world, the Whitestone Council created the Dragonlance Nexus, which was launched in mid January 2001. As previously noted, the key focus of the Dragonlance Nexus was to create a set of Dungeons and Dragons 3rd Edition rules for Dragonlance, which would be the foundation upon which the future of Dragonlance gaming. This online product was called Dragonlance Adventures 3rd Edition, or DLA3e for short. Work continued on the project, and the Nexus expanded to include recipes, artwork, news, and many other features over the course of the next year. However, in March 2002, the Dragonlance gaming line was licensed to Sovereign Press. Beginning in April, the Whitestone Council soon found itself working with Sovereign Press on a new sourcebook, the Dragonlance Campaign Setting (or DLCS for short). Materials from DLA3e were incorporated into the DLCS, and the Whitestone Council continues to serve as an advisory board for future projects Sovereign Press projects to this day. Later that summer, the Nexus partnered with Dragonlance.com to expand the reach of its content. Many of the Nexus's fan gaming rules were hosted on Dragonlance.com; in return, the extensive reference material from Dragonlance.com was added to the Nexus in a sharing agreement set up between the two sites. This arrangement continued until June 2003, when the two sites were formally merged into the current Nexus site, and the Dragonlance.com domain name was transferred to Sovereign Press to promote the d20 Dragonlance gaming line. Today, the Dragonlance Nexus, along with the Whitestone Council, serve as an advisory board to Sovereign Press, and review each product that Sovereign Press releases to check for continuity errors. The site also has well over 15,000 articles of fan artwork, gaming rules, articles, music, recipes, and many other items related to the Dragonlance setting. To further expand to meet the needs of the fans, the Dragonlance Lexicon was launched on September 16, 2005 with high anticipation. Not only was the Lexicon built for the fans, but also it was to assist authors in being able to find information on what they were going to write about. Following the launch of the Lexicon the very first author submission was by Douglas Niles on his character Jaymes Markham, with other authors such as Nancy Varian Berberick, Mary H. Herbert, and Kevin Stein all submitting articles. Following the launch of the Lexicon came the launch of the new Palanthas Herald on October 20, 2005. This was created to allow fans to create adventure ideas in the settings of the city of Palanthas. This would also assist Game Masters in quickly getting ideas on how to run a campaign.  New site address  On April 24, 2006, Trampas and Matt made the decision to change the address of the site from www.dl3e.com (Dragonlance 3rd Edition) to www.dlnexus.com. This was a move because the new address would better reflect the broader mission of the Nexus than just dealing in 3rd edition D&D.; With the inclusion of the Herald and the Lexicon, and the possible change to 4th edition D&D;, the site needed to better reflect what it did. The old site address will still be retained though.  Dragonlance Canticle  On March 7, 2007, launch of the Dragonlance Canticle podcast site and Episode 0, a first of its kind for Dragonlance fans. Six days later, Episode 1 was launched and even had the guest voices of Tracy and Laura Hickman. The plan use of the podcast is to allow for round table discussions, author interviews, book discussion, trivia, and just general information on the Dragonlance world, and was hosted by Trampas Whiteman. In 2010, Tristan Zimmerman became the host. Reception The site won the gold ENnie for best fan site on August 16, 2007 at Gen Con.

Early life He was born in London, the son of Major General Sir Henry Trotter and Lady Trotter, who maintained an estate at Mortonhall, Midlothian. He was a younger brother of Gerald Trotter. Trotter was commissioned into the Grenadier Guards and served in the Sudan expedition of 1898. Military career After the outbreak of the Second Boer War in October 1899, a corps of imperial volunteers from London was formed in late December 1899. The corps included infantry, mounted infantry and artillery divisions and was authorized with the name City of London Imperial Volunteers. It proceeded to South Africa in January 1900, returned in October the same year, and was disbanded in December 1900. Lieutenant Trotter was seconded from his regiment and appointed Staff captain to the corps on 1 January 1900, with the temporary rank of Captain in the Army, and served as such until it was disbanded. He was awarded the Distinguished Service Order (DSO) for his services in South Africa on 29 November 1900. In April 1902, Trotter returned to South Africa with a detachment of men from the Guards regiments. Following the end of the war two months later, Trotter and most of the men returned to the United Kingdom on board the SS Lake Michigan in October 1902. Trotter became the commanding officer of the 18th King's shortly after the battalion was formed by the 17th Earl of Derby on 29 August 1914. The Earl's brother, Lieutenant Colonel F.C. Stanley, secured Trotter's command of the 18th, one of four Liverpool \\"Pals\\" battalions raised. The battalion was initially located at Hooton racecourse, where they were supervised by NCOs from the Grenadier Guards. The new commanding officer was enthusiastic about physical exercise. In spite of a weak knee as a result of a hunting accident, Trotter would often take part in his battalion's daily exercises. The 18th's prowess in inter-battalion competitions earned it the nickname \\"Trotter's Greyhounds\\". After landing at Boulogne, France in November 1915, Trotter's battalion was moved to the Somme area. On 1 July 1916, on the first day of the Somme offensive, the 18th King's advanced with their division towards Montauban. Located on the left flank of the French, to the south of where the British Army sustained most of its casualties on the first day, the 30th Division began its advance at 07:30. An effective French bombardment ensured the advance encountered mostly limited opposition. The 18th King's, however, was subject to relentless fire from German positions during their advance on the Glatz Redoubt. The division's objectives were nevertheless achieved, one of the few successes of 1 July. Trotter estimated the 18th had suffered about 500 casualties on the first-day. Reduced to minimal strength, the 18th was withdrawn from the front and converted to a carrier battalion. When it was ordered to move forward on 8 July, Trotter decided to oversee the movement personally and arrived before the battalion. The troop movements prompted the Germans to bombard the area. A shell landed in the entrance to brigade headquarters, killing Trotter, a lieutenant, two other ranks, and mortally wounding Lieutenant Colonel William Smith of the 18th Manchesters. Trotter is buried at P√©ronne Road Cemetery, Maricourt. One of his brothers, Reginald, was killed on 9 May 1915 while serving with the Cameron Highlanders on the Western Front.

At 1,076 pages, it was the longest Michener novel published by Random House. Given the success of his previous novels, the company did a first printing of 750,000 copies, 'the largest in the company's history.'ALBIN KREBS, 'James Michener, Author of Novels That Sweep Through the History of Places, Is Dead', New York Times, 17 October 1997, accessed 12 October 2014 Background Michener did extensive research on the novel in Texas, receiving much support from the state government. Governor Bill Clements offered him access to numerous state archives and research staff at the University of Texas at Austin. Michener rented 3506 Mt. Bonnell Road for $1 per year to write Texas. Reception Texas Monthly magazine did not like the novel, awarding Michener its 'Bum Steer of the Year Award' (given to people who have done something to merit ridicule or embarrassment) for the work's \\"hackneyed dialogue\\" and \\"tendency to resort to stereotypes\\".'1986 Bum Steer Awards', Texas Monthly, February 1986 The journal, however, made peace with Michener later.'James Michener', Texas Monthly Adaptations The novel was adapted as a 1994 made-for-TV movie of the same name, directed by Richard Lang and featuring actors Stacy Keach, Benjamin Bratt, Rick Schroder and Patrick Duffy.

The league operated for two seasons from 1961 to 1963. For those two seasons the Metro Junior A League champion won the Father John Conway Memorial Trophy and went on to play the OHA champion for the J. Ross Robertson Cup, and the right to continue on the road to the Memorial Cup. After two seasons, the calibre of play in the league was subpar, and many of the franchises were still having serious financial problems, while the two old Toronto teams dominated the promoted junior B teams. The Metro experiment was cancelled in 1963 and many of the teams folded. The Toronto Marlboros and Oshawa Generals were readmitted to the OHA for the 1963‚Äì64 season. 1961‚Äì62 season The league started its first season with five teams, two of which were former OHA Junior A teams, and three promoted Junior B teams. The Toronto Marlboros, who were also owned by Stafford Smythe, were withdrawn from the OHA to play in the new league, and joined by the Toronto St. Michael's Majors who also supplied the Leafs with players. Smythe set about finding more teams to fill his league. The Marlboros and Majors would be joined by promoted Junior B teams, the Whitby Mohawks, the Brampton 7Ups, and the Unionville Seaforths. St. Michael's College School which operated the Majors, chose to play in the Metro Junior A League since it had a shorter schedule with less travel that would impact academic performance of its student athletes.Oliver, Greg (2017), pp. 70‚Äì71 The Marlboros and Majors both supplied players to the new teams in an effort to bring up their standard of competition, but the Majors easily won the league title that year, with the Marlies coming second. The Majors also prevailed in the playoffs against Brampton and the Marlboros. In the 1961‚Äì62 J. Ross Robertson Cup series, the Hamilton Red Wings defeated the Majors 4 games to 1. 1961‚Äì62 standings { border=\\"1\\" cellpadding=\\"3\\" cellspacing=\\"1\\" bgcolor=\\"#ffffff\\" style=\\"border: 1px #aaaaaa solid; border-collapse: collapse;\\" - bgcolor=\\"#efefef\\" align=\\"center\\"  Team Games  Won  Lost  Tied  Points  Goals for  Goals against - align=\\"center\\" Toronto St. Michael's Majors3325715517091 - align=\\"center\\" Toronto Marlboros33189644141103 - align=\\"center\\" Whitby Mohawks361420230123170 - align=\\"center\\" Brampton 7Ups361121426143189 - align=\\"center\\" Unionville Seaforths361021525133157 } Playoff results * Series A: St. Michael's defeated Whitby 8 points to 2. * Series B: Toronto Marlboros defeated Brampton 8 points to 2. * Finals: St. Michael's defeated Toronto 8 points to 6. 1962‚Äì63 season By 1962 financial constraints had forced a re- organizing of the league. The Marlboros and 7Ups remained, but the Whitby Mohawks were renamed the Whitby Dunlops, the Unionville Seaforths became Toronto Knob Hill Farms, and the Majors became the Toronto Neil McNeil Maroons. The new sixth team in the league was the reborn Oshawa Generals team, featuring future Hockey Hall of Fame inductee, 14-year-old Bobby Orr, and playing in Bowmanville as there was no suitable arena in Oshawa. As opposed to the first season of the league, there was little effort to spread teams around the Toronto area, as Knob Hill, Neil McNeil and the Marlboros all called Maple Leaf Gardens home, usually playing doubleheader games on Tuesdays and Sundays. St. Michael's College School decided to end the Majors program in 1962. The Toronto Maple Leafs prospect playes were transferred to Neil McNeil High School with Jim Gregory remaining as coach and director of the Maple Leafs' farm system.Oliver, Greg (2017), p. 71 The Maroons won the league title, then defeated the Dunlops and Marlboros in the playoffs.

It was created on 4 May 1880 for Charles Frederick Abney-Hastings. Born Charles Frederick Clifton, he was the widower of Edith Mary Abney-Hastings, 10th Countess of Loudoun. He and his wife had in 1859 assumed by Royal licence the surname of Abney-Hastings on succeeding to the Abney-Hastings estates after the death of his wife's kinsman Sir Charles Abney-Hastings, 2nd Baronet in 1858 (see Abney-Hastings baronets). They were both succeeded by their eldest son Charles Edward Rawdon-Hastings, 11th Earl of Loudoun and 2nd Baron Donington. However, on his death in 1920 the titles separated. The Scottish earldom was inherited by his niece Edith, daughter of his second brother the Hon. Major Paulyn Francis Cuthbert Rawdon-Hastings. The barony of Donington, which could only be inherited by male heirs, passed to his third brother Gilbert Theophilus, who became the third Baron. He had four daughters but no sons, and on his death in 1927 the barony became extinct. The first Baron was descended from John Clifton, brother of Sir Thomas Clifton, 1st Baronet (see Clifton baronets).

History The hotel was built after Exeter Hall was demolished in 1907. It opened in 1909 and was refurbished in the Art Deco style during the 1930s, but has now been modernised. Strand Hotel Limited was incorporated on 31 October 1907, with some 4,000 shareholders. Created by the Salmon & Gluckstein families, it was established to fund the building of the Strand Palace Hotel. J. Lyons & Co. acquired shares in this enterprise in 1922, and also bought the adjoining Haxells family hotel in order to expand and improve the Strand Hotel. After extensive redevelopment, the hotel became an art deco showcase, and re-opened in 1928, with 980 bedrooms. The same year, some not-so-prominent changes were being made behind the scenes. Two secondhand coal-fired steam boilers, salvaged from World War I battleships, were installed in the boiler house. The rear of the property was occupied by the Winter Garden Restaurant. The Winter Garden Restaurant had a large domed ceiling and could seat over 500 guests, which were served by over one hundred staff. Due to its large number of bedrooms, the hotel became popular with American forces before they were sent into action in World War II. Indeed, the hotel was, in fact, commissioned as an official U.S. rest and recuperation residence. Once again, the hotel became an important social venue, as Londoners and war-weary soldiers jived and jitterbugged long into the night. Over the years, many of these service personnel have returned to relive memories, and today their families and relatives still visit the Strand. The post-war era saw the Strand Palace Hotel implement a number of improvements. The introduction of private bathrooms in all guest rooms in 1958 reduced the overall number of rooms at the hotel to 786. The increased number of bathroom facilities meant that oil-fired boilers had to be installed, in order to cope with the demand for hot water. In 1968, the front hall and ground floor restaurants, including the Winter Garden, were redesigned, and the first computerised billing system in London was installed. The revolving doors and other parts of the foyer designed by Oliver Bernard were removed in this redesign, but were of such fine quality and historic interest, that the curators at the Victoria and Albert Museum requested them for their collection in 1969. The pieces were dismantled and stored in the museum's Battersea depot. The doors were exhibited in 2003 in the museum's major exhibition 'Art Deco: 1910‚Äì1939', following reconstruction. The Strand Palace hotel photographed on 25 August 1981 In 1976, Forte bought the lease of the Strand Palace Hotel from the Lyons Hotel Group. Over the next ten years, minor refurbishment took place throughout the hotel. In 1985, a more in-depth refurbishment was undertaken on all floors of the new hotel and this included new furniture, new bathrooms and a redecoration of the bedrooms. London and Regional Properties took over the hotel in 2006. They contracted Michael Gallie to delivered an updated floor plan, online the external elevations, and much of the area referencing, contributing to what the hotel is today.

Early childhood and education  Schaechter-Viswanath was born in The Bronx, New York, USA. She grew up in a Yiddish-speaking home and attended Yiddish schools as a child. She attended school at the Sholem Aleichem Folkshul 21 and has degrees from Barnard College in Russian, Columbia University in nursing, and New York University in health administration. She also has a teaching diploma from the Jewish Teachers Seminary.  Career  She began writing poetry, much of which was published in the journals Yugntruf and Afn Shvel, in 1980. Several poems were published in English and Yiddish in Hadassah magazine, the literary journal Five Fingers Review, and various anthologies. While her poems range widely in subject matter, her lyric technique is remarkably consistent. She tends towards short poems of no more than two pages, exploring single incidents or observations fully but using highly compressed language. She uses rhyme in many but not all poems, and varies rhyme scheme within a poem when necessary. She uses a variety of meter as well as unmetered verse. While her technique produces poems of unusual intensity, they are leavened with playfulness and puns. Her subject matter includes big questions such as marriage and grief; and small questions such as baking a failed loaf of bread. A poem about the day following the September 11, 2001 attacks is eerily still. Her 2003 book Plutsemdiker Regn/Sudden Rain is a bilingual edition of about 40 of her poems in Yiddish and English. Although Schaechter-Viswanath is a native speaker of both languages, she does not write poetry in English and does not translate her own Yiddish works into English. Her translators are Zackary Sholem Berger, himself a poet in both English and Yiddish, and Jeffrey Shandler, associate professor of Jewish Studies at Rutgers University and a well-known translator. The magazine Hadassah called her poems \\"introspective and witty,\\" and the book was hailed as \\"that rarest of miracles: a first book of poetry in which every poem is a gem\\" by the Newsletter of the Association of Jewish Libraries. In 2016, Indiana University Press published the Comprehensive English-Yiddish Dictionary, which was co-edited by Schaechter-Viswanath and Dr. Paul Glasser.Comprehensive English-Yiddish Dictionary, accessed October 27, 2017.

She is a member of the Jewish People's Philharmonic Chorus, conducted by her brother. Family Schaechter-Viswanath is a member of a leading family in Yiddish language and cultural studies. Her father, Mordkhe Schaechter, was an influential linguist of the Yiddish language. Her aunt Beyle Schaechter-Gottesman is a poet and songwriter; sister Rukhl Schaechter is a journalist with the Yiddish Forward; sister Eydl Reznik teaches Yiddish and directed a Yiddish chorus among the ultra-Orthodox community in Tsfat, Israel; and brother Binyumen Schaechter is a Yiddish composer and performer.

The area is part of the Washwood Heath ward, and was previously part of the Nechells ward. It is part of the Ladywood constituency in the city. History Saltley was originally an unverified parish within the estate of the Adderley family and their descendants, who had built their original residence Saltley Hall on the site of what is now Adderley Park. As water became a key resource, the family moved their residence to Hams Hall for better access to the River Tame. When the English Civil War occurred, the Adderleys like most gentry chose the Royalist side, and paid heavy fines afterwards for choosing the wrong side. In 1845 railway carriage makers Joseph Wright and Sons relocated from London to a factory built on meadowlands in Saltley; the company eventually became Metro- Cammell, who remained in Saltley until 1962. As Birmingham developed as an industrial location, Saltley became an overspill area for workers, although still owned by the Adderley family. Charles Bowyer Adderley (later 1st Baron Norton) in 1855 donated land for the development of Adderley Park, as well as churches. It was Lord Norton who oversaw the then modern layout of the square- set streets and well spaced houses of the late 19th century, later seen as slum development post World War II. St Peter's College was both a teacher training college and school, which was developed from 1852. The school closed in 1941 post destruction by a Luftwaffe bomb, while the college closed in 1978 to become part of Aston University. The building today encompasses houses, meeting rooms and council facilities. Present day Saltley is a largely business area with a high level of outlets in a densely populated area. Saltley begins at the Saltley Viaduct, marked with the Saltley Gate, a local landmark, at the entrance to Alum Rock Road and Washwood Heath Road. There are many older houses from around the turn of the 20th century still in existence around Saltley. During the 1950s and 1960s, many of these houses were bought by immigrants from the Commonwealth of Nations (mostly from Pakistan and Bangladesh) who have formed a strong ethnic community over the last half a century. The neighbourhood is home to mainly terraced properties and some new housing projects, trade and Christian and Muslim places of worship. Situated in the area are a number of primary schools and St. Peter's College. (St Peters College is no longer used as a college but the site is used for sheltered housing, small business offices, such as CSV Environment, and a small playing field). Recreation includes the Wheel's Adventure Park and smaller domestic parks. The area was host to an annual parade, known as the Saltley Festival. The future of Wheel's Adventure Park is under threat as a result of a proposed major redevelopment to construct a sports village and City of Birmingham Stadium. The proposal for the City of Birmingham Stadium has fallen through. Places of interest Adderley Street was the site of the 1890 discovery of the Saltley Handaxe, the first paleolithic human artefact to be found in the English Midlands. Saltley Gate Coke Depot was the site of the Battle of Saltley Gate, one of the largest mass pickets during the 1970s. On Thursday 10 February 1972 30,000 Birmingham engineers walked out on strike. They struck to deliver solidarity to striking miners. Up to 15,000 then marched to join 2,000 miners who were picketing Saltley Coke Depot. The blockade forced the police, who had kept the depot open all week, to close the gates. The victory at Saltley was the turning point in the miners' strike. Militant picketing involving tens of thousands of miners had shut down power stations, docks and coke and coal depots. Power cuts forced the Tory government to call a state of emergency. After seven weeks the government was defeated. Transport Saltley is served by the Adderley Park railway station on the Birmingham New street to Coventry railway line and just half a mile up the road in Duddeston the Duddeston Station on the cross city line. Bus routes into the area include the 8A/8C, 14, 55 and 94. Saltley was served by Saltley railway station between 1854 and 1968.

An airport surveillance radar (ASR) is a radar system used at airports to detect and display the presence and position of aircraft in the terminal area, the airspace around airports. It is the main air traffic control system for the airspace around airports. At large airports it typically controls traffic within a radius of 60 miles (96 km) of the airport below an elevation of 25,000 feet. The sophisticated systems at large airports consist of two different radar systems, the primary and secondary surveillance radar. The primary radar typically consists of a large rotating parabolic antenna dish that sweeps a vertical fan-shaped beam of microwaves around the airspace surrounding the airport. It detects the position and range of aircraft by microwaves reflected back to the antenna from the aircraft's surface. In the US the primary radar operates at a frequency of 2.7 - 2.9 GHz in the S band with a peak radiated power of 25 kW and an average power of 2.1 kW. The secondary surveillance radar consists of a second rotating antenna, often mounted on the primary antenna, which interrogates the transponders of aircraft, which transmits a radio signal back containing the aircraft's identification, barometric altitude, and an emergency status code, which is displayed on the radar screen next to the return from the primary radar. It operates at a frequency of 1.03 - 1.09 GHz in the L band with peak power of 160 - 1500 W. The positions of the aircraft are displayed on a screen; at large airports on multiple screens in an operations room at the airport called in the US the Terminal Radar Approach Control (TRACON), monitored by air traffic controllers who direct the traffic by communicating with the aircraft pilots by radio. They are responsible for maintaining a safe and orderly flow of traffic and adequate aircraft separation to prevent midair collisions. antenna. The curving lower reflector is the primary radar, while the flat antenna on top is the secondary radar. Radio frequency energy enters and leaves the antenna via the two small orange horn feeds visible on the right foreground, and is guided to and from the radar processing circuitry through the black waveguides curving from the feeds into and down through the rotating central mount. An early LP23 airport surveillance radar antenna at Orly airport, near Paris, France, in 1964 Types Due to its crucial safety mission, extreme uptime requirements, and need to be compatible with all the different types of aircraft and avionics systems, the design of airport surveillance radar is strictly controlled by government agencies. In the US the Federal Aviation Administration (FAA) is responsible for developing airport surveillance radar. All ASRs have the common requirements of detecting aircraft out to a range of 60 miles and an elevation of 25,000 feet. Upgrades are released in \\"generations\\" after careful testing: ASR-7 P7 CRT having a non-rotating deflection yoke, vector monitor technology, and built-in electronics to provide drive signals for the familiar rotating PPI sweep. This is an obsolete system that is completely out of service. ASR-8 ASR 8 is the analog precursor to the ASR 9. It is an aging radar system that is obsolete, not logistically supported, do not provide digital inputs to new terminal automation systems, and do not provide a calibrated precipitation intensity product nor any storm motion information. It is a relocatable, solid-state, all-weather radar with dual-channel, frequency diversity, remote operator controls, and a dual beam tower mounted antenna. The radar provides controllers with range azimuth of aircraft within a 60 nautical mile radius. ASR 8 used a klystron as transmitters power amplifier stage with a load of 79 kV and 40A. The two operational frequencies have a minimum separation of 60 MHz. The US Army/Navy designator AN/GPN-20 refers to a modified version of the ASR 8 used by the USAF containing a magnetron tube as transmitter. To improve the magnetron's frequency stability the magnetron tuning is driven by the AFC. ASR-9 The current generation of radar is the ASR-9, which was developed by Northrop/Grumman and first installed in 1989, with installation completing in 1995. Currently it is operating at 135 locations and is scheduled to continue in use until at least 2025. The ASR-9 was the first airport surveillance radar to detect weather and aircraft with the same beam and be able to display them on the same screen. It has a digital Moving Target Detection (MTD) processor which uses doppler radar and a clutter map giving advanced ability to eliminate ground and weather clutter and track targets. It is theoretically capable of tracking a maximum of 700 aircraft simultaneously. The klystron tube transmitter operates in the S-band between 2.5 and 2.9 GHz in circular polarization with a peak power of 1.3 MW and a pulse duration of 1 Œºs and pulse repetition frequency between 325 and 1200 pps. It can be switched to a second reserve frequency if interference is encountered on the primary frequency. The receiver has the sensitivity to detect a radar cross-section of 1 meter2 at 111 km, and a range resolution of 450 feet. The antenna covers an elevation of 40¬∞ from the horizon with two feedhorns which create two stacked overlapping vertical lobes 4¬∞ apart; the lower beam transmits the outgoing pulse and is used to detect distant targets near the horizon, while the upper receive-only beam detects closer higher elevation aircraft with less ground clutter. The antenna has a gain of 34 dB, beamwidth of 5¬∞ in elevation and 1.4¬∞ in azimuth. It rotates at a rate of 12.5 RPM so the airspace is scanned every 4.8 seconds. The electronics is dual-channel and fault tolerant. It has a remote monitoring and maintenance subsystem; if a fault occurs a built-in test detects and isolates the problem. Like all airport surveillance radars it has a backup diesel generator to continue operating during power outages. ASR-11 or Digital Airport Surveillance Radar (DASR) The Digital Airport Surveillance Radar (DASR) is the new generation of fully digital radar that is being developed to replace the current analog systems. The US Air Force Electronics Systems Center, the US Federal Aviation Administration, US Army and the US Navy procured DASR systems to upgrade existing radar facilities for US Department of Defense (DoD) and civilian airfields. The DASR system detects aircraft position and weather conditions in the vicinity of civilian and military airfields. The civilian nomenclature for this radar is ASR-11. The ASR-11 will replace most ASR-7 and some ASR-8. The military nomenclature for the radar is AN/GPN-30. The older radars, some up to 20 years old, are being replaced to improve reliability, provide additional weather data, reduce maintenance cost, improve performance, and provide digital data to new digital automation systems for presentation on air traffic control displays.FAA ASR-11 Website The Iraqi Air Force has received the DASR system.Advanced Radar Improves Iraqi Air Surveillance American Forces Press Service (Oct. 30, 2009). ASR 910, a German derivate of AN/TPN-24, Radartower in Neubrandenburg (Western-Pomerania/ Germany)  Display systems  ASR data is displayed on Automated Radar Terminal System (ARTS), Common Automated Radar Terminal System (CARTS), and Standard Terminal Automation Replacement System (STARS) display consoles in control towers and Terminal Radar Approach Control (TRACON) rooms, usually located at airports. CARTS will be replaced with STARS at all TRACONs during TAMR Phase 3 - Segment 1 as announced by the Federal Aviation Administration (FAA) in the Spring of 2011. All remaining ARTS (IIE) sites will be replaced with STARS during TAMR Phase 3 Segment 2 as announced by the FAA in the Spring of 2013. The Standard Terminal Automation Replacement System (STARS) is a joint Federal Aviation Administration (FAA) and Department of Defense (DoD) program to replace Automated Radar Terminal Systems (ARTS) and other capacity-constrained, older technology systems at 172 FAA and up to 199 DoD terminal radar approach control facilities and associated towers. STARS will be used by controllers, at facilities who already have it installed, to provide air traffic control (ATC) services to aircraft in terminal areas. Typical terminal area ATC services are defined as the area around airports where departing and arriving traffic are served. Functions include aircraft separation, weather advisories, and lower level control of air traffic. The system is designed to accommodate air traffic growth and the introduction of new automation functions which will improve the safety and efficiency of the US National Airspace System (NAS) as the legacy systems are replaced.FAA STARS website Airport Surveillance Radar is beginning to be supplemented by ADS-B Automatic dependent surveillance-broadcast in the US and other parts of the world. As of Spring 2011, ADS-B is currently operational and in use at the Philadelphia, PA TRACON and Louisville, KY TRACON. ADS-B is a GPS based technology that allows aircraft to transmit their GPS determined position to display systems as often as once per second, as opposed to once every 4 seconds for a short range radar, or once every 13 seconds for a slower rotating long range radar. The FAA is mandating that ADS-B be fully operational and available to the NAS by the year 2020. This will make possible the decommissioning of older radars in order to increase safety and cut costs. As of 2011, there is no definitive list of radars that will be decommissioned as a result of ADS-B implementation.

Many other stories contain geese that lay golden eggs, though certain versions change them for hens or other birds that lay golden eggs. The tale has given rise to the idiom 'killing the goose that lays the golden eggs', which refers to the short-sighted destruction of a valuable resource, or to an unprofitable action motivated by greed. Story and moral Avianus and Caxton tell different stories of a goose that lays a golden egg, where other versions have a hen, as in Townsend: \\"A cottager and his wife had a Hen that laid a golden egg every day. They supposed that the Hen must contain a great lump of gold in its inside, and in order to get the gold they killed [her]. Having done so, they found to their surprise that the Hen differed in no respect from their other hens. The foolish pair, thus hoping to become rich all at once, deprived themselves of the gain of which they were assured day by day.\\" The Goose that Laid the Golden Eggs, illustrated by Milo Winter in a 1919 edition In early tellings, there is sometimes a commentary warning against greed rather than a pithy moral. This is so in Jean de La Fontaine's fable of La Poule aux oeufs d'or (Fables V.13), which begins with the sentiment that 'Greed loses all by striving all to gain' and comments at the end that the story can be applied to those who become poor by trying to outreach themselves. It is only later that the morals most often quoted today began to appear. These are 'Greed oft o‚Äôer reaches itself' (Joseph Jacobs, 1894) and 'Much wants more and loses all' (Samuel Croxall, 1722).Available on Google Books, pp.228-9 books.google.co.uk It is notable also that these are stories told of a goose rather than a hen. The English idiom \\"Kill not the goose that lays the golden egg\\", sometimes shortened to \\"killing the golden goose\\", derives from this fable. It is generally used of a short-sighted action that destroys the profitability of an asset. Caxton's version of the story has the goose's owner demand that it lay two eggs a day; when it replied that it could not, the owner killed it. The same lesson is taught by Ignacy Krasicki's different fable of \\"The Farmer:\\" There is another variant on the story, recorded by Syntipas (Perry Index 58) and appearing in Roger L'Estrange's 1692 telling as \\"A Woman and a Fat Hen\\" (Fable 87): A good Woman had a Hen that laid her every day an Egg. Now she fansy‚Äôd to her self, that upon a larger Allowance of Corn, this Hen might be brought in time to lay twice a day. She try‚Äôd the Experiment; but the Hen grew fat upon‚Äôt, and gave quite over laying. His comment on this is that 'we should set Bounds to our Desires, and content our selves when we are well, for fear of losing what we had.' Another of Aesop's fables with the moral of wanting more and losing everything is The Dog and the Bone. Eastern instances An Eastern analogue is found in the Suvannahamsa Jataka, which appears in the fourth section of the Buddhist book of monastic discipline (Vinaya). In this the father of a poor family is reborn as a swan with golden feathers and invites them to pluck and sell a single feather from his wings to support themselves, returning occasionally to allow them another. The greedy mother of the family eventually plucks all the feathers at once, but they then turn to ordinary feathers; when the swan recovers its feathers they too are no longer gold. The moral drawn there is: North of India, in the formerly Persian territory of Sogdiana, it was the Greek version of the story that was known. Among the 8th-century murals in Panjakent, in the western Sugdh province of Tajikistan, there is a panel from room 1, sector 21, representing a series of scenes moving from right to left where it is possible to recognize the same person first in the act of checking a golden egg and later killing the animal in order to get more eggs, only to understand the stupidity of his idea at the very end of the sequence. A local version of the story still persists in the area but ends differently with the main character eventually becoming a king.See Matteo Compareti's description of the murals at vitterhetsakad.se In the Mahabharata a story is recounted of wild birds that spit gold, and were discovered by a man who soon strangled them \\"out of greed\\".Mahabharata 2.55.10, Buitenen translation vol. 2, p. 132 Use in the arts The French text was set as the fourth of Rudolf Koumans' Vijf fabels van La Fontaine for children's choir and orchestra (Op. 25 1968). Yassen Vodenitcharov (1964-) has created a chamber opera from the story (2004). The majority of illustrations of \\"The Goose that Laid the Golden Eggs\\" picture the farmer despairing after discovering that he has killed the goose to no purpose. It was also one of several fables applied to political issues by the American illustrator Thomas Nast. Captioned Always killing the goose that lays the golden eggs, it appeared in Harpers Weekly for March 16, 1878. There the picture of the baffled farmer, advised by a 'Communistic Statesman', referred to the rail strike of 1877. The farmer stands for the politically driven union members whose wife and children sorrow in the background. References *Aesop's Fables, a new translation by V. S. Vernon Jones (London: W.

In particular, it is used to refer to the theft of a magic cookie used to authenticate a user to a remote server. It has particular relevance to web developers, as the HTTP cookies used to maintain a session on many web sites can be easily stolen by an attacker using an intermediary computer or with access to the saved cookies on the victim's computer (see HTTP cookie theft). After successfully stealing appropriate session cookies an adversary might use the Pass the Cookie technique to perform session hijacking. A popular method is using source-routed IP packets. This allows an attacker at point B on the network to participate in a conversation between A and C by encouraging the IP packets to pass through B's machine. If source- routing is turned off, the attacker can use \\"blind\\" hijacking, whereby it guesses the responses of the two machines. Thus, the attacker can send a command, but can never see the response. However, a common command would be to set a password allowing access from elsewhere on the net. An attacker can also be \\"inline\\" between A and C using a sniffing program to watch the conversation. This is known as a \\"man-in-the-middle attack\\". History of HTTP HTTP protocol versions 0.8 and 0.9 lacked cookies and other features necessary for session hijacking. Version 0.9beta of Mosaic Netscape, released on October 13, 1994, supported cookies. Early versions of HTTP 1.0 did have some security weaknesses relating to session hijacking, but they were difficult to exploit due to the vagaries of most early HTTP 1.0 servers and browsers. As HTTP 1.0 has been designated as a fallback for HTTP 1.1 since the early 2000s‚Äîand as HTTP 1.0 servers are all essentially HTTP 1.1 servers the session hijacking problem has evolved into a nearly permanent security risk. The introduction of supercookies and other features with the modernized HTTP 1.1 has allowed for the hijacking problem to become an ongoing security problem. Webserver and browser state machine standardization has contributed to this ongoing security problem. Methods There are four main methods used to perpetrate a session hijack. These are: * Session fixation, where the attacker sets a user's session id to one known to them, for example by sending the user an email with a link that contains a particular session id. The attacker now only has to wait until the user logs in. * Session side jacking, where the attacker uses packet sniffing to read network traffic between two parties to steal the session cookie. Many web sites use SSL encryption for login pages to prevent attackers from seeing the password, but do not use encryption for the rest of the site once authenticated. This allows attackers that can read the network traffic to intercept all the data that is submitted to the server or web pages viewed by the client. Since this data includes the session cookie, it allows them to impersonate the victim, even if the password itself is not compromised. Unsecured Wi-Fi hotspots are particularly vulnerable, as anyone sharing the network will generally be able to read most of the web traffic between other nodes and the access point. * Cross-site scripting, where the attacker tricks the user's computer into running code which is treated as trustworthy because it appears to belong to the server, allowing the attacker to obtain a copy of the cookie or perform other operations. *Malware and unwanted programs can use browser hijacking to steal a browser's cookie files without a user's knowledge, and then perform actions (like installing Android apps) without the user's knowledge. An attacker with physical access can simply attempt to steal the session key by, for example, obtaining the file or memory contents of the appropriate part of either the user's computer or the server. After successfully acquiring appropriate session cookies an adversary might leverage the Pass the Cookie technique to perform session hijacking. Exploits=Firesheep In October 2010, a Mozilla Firefox extension called Firesheep was released that made it easy for session hijackers to attack users of unencrypted public Wi-Fi. Websites like Facebook, Twitter, and any that the user adds to their preferences allow the Firesheep user to easily access private information from cookies and threaten the public Wi-Fi user's personal property. Only months later, Facebook and Twitter responded by offering (and later requiring) HTTP Secure throughout. WhatsApp sniffer An app named \\"WhatsApp Sniffer\\" was made available on Google Play in May 2012, able to display messages from other WhatsApp users connected to the same network as the app user. At that time WhatsApp used an XMPP infrastructure with encryption, not plain-text communication. DroidSheep DroidSheep is a simple Android tool for web session hijacking (sidejacking). It listens for HTTP packets sent via a wireless (802.11) network connection and extracts the session id from these packets in order to reuse them. DroidSheep can capture sessions using the libpcap library and supports: open (unencrypted) networks, WEP encrypted networks, and WPA/WPA2 encrypted networks (PSK only). This software uses libpcap and arpspoof. The apk was made available on Google Play but it has been taken down by Google. CookieCadger CookieCadger is a graphical Java app that automates sidejacking and replay of HTTP requests, to help identify information leakage from applications that use unencrypted GET requests. It is a cross-platform open-source utility based on the Wireshark suite which can monitor wired Ethernet, insecure Wi-Fi, or load a packet capture file for offline analysis. Cookie Cadger has been used to highlight the weaknesses of youth team sharing sites such as Shutterfly (used by AYSO soccer league) and TeamSnap. Prevention Methods to prevent session hijacking include: * Encryption of the data traffic passed between the parties by using SSL/TLS; in particular the session key (though ideally all traffic for the entire session). This technique is widely relied-upon by web-based banks and other e-commerce services, because it completely prevents sniffing-style attacks. However, it could still be possible to perform some other kind of session hijack. In response, scientists from the Radboud University Nijmegen proposed in 2013 a way to prevent session hijacking by correlating the application session with the SSL/TLS credentials * Use of a long random number or string as the session key. This reduces the risk that an attacker could simply guess a valid session key through trial and error or brute force attacks. * Regenerating the session id after a successful login. This prevents session fixation because the attacker does not know the session id of the user after they have logged in. * Some services make secondary checks against the identity of the user. For instance, a web server could check with each request made that the IP address of the user matched the one last used during that session. This does not prevent attacks by somebody who shares the same IP address, however, and could be frustrating for users whose IP address is liable to change during a browsing session. * Alternatively, some services will change the value of the cookie with each and every request. This dramatically reduces the window in which an attacker can operate and makes it easy to identify whether an attack has taken place, but can cause other technical problems (for example, two legitimate, closely timed requests from the same client can lead to a token check error on the server). * Users may also wish to log out of websites whenever they are finished using them.See See also However this will not protect against attacks such as Firesheep.

Its mission is to collaborate with licensing boards to facilitate the licensure and credentialing of architects to protect the health, safety, and welfare of the public. NCARB recommends model law, model regulations, and other guidelines for adoption by its member jurisdictions, but each makes its own laws and registration requirements. As a service to its members, NCARB develops, administers, and maintains the Architectural Experience Program (AXP) and the Architect Registration Examination (ARE) as well as facilitates reciprocity between jurisdictions through the NCARB Certificate. History Illinois became the first state in to enact laws regulating the practice of architecture in 1897. In May 1919, during an American Institute of Architects (AIA) convention in Nashville, TN, 15 architects from 13 states came together to form an organization that would become NCARB. Emil Lorch from Ann Arbor, MI, was elected the organization's first president in May 1920. As expressed by its founding members, NCARB's stated goals were: * To facilitate the exchange of information on examining, licensing, and regulating architects * To foster uniformity in licensing and practice laws * To facilitate reciprocal licensing * To discuss the merits of various examining methods as well as the scope and content of licensing examinations * To strive to improve the general education standards of the architectural profession in the United States Organization NCARB is led by a Board of Directors elected by the member registration boards at its Annual Business Meeting each June. It has six officers (president/chair of the Board, first vice president/president-elect, second vice president, treasurer, secretary, and the past president) and eight directors (one from each of the six regions, a member board executive director, and a public director). Additionally, a chief executive officer, chief operating officer, and chief innovation and information officer lead the headquarters in Washington, DC. The office is split into two divisions, programs and operations. Over 100 people are on staff in Washington, DC. NCARB Regions Today, NCARB comprises the registration boards from the 50 U.S. states, the District of Columbia, and four U.S. territories (Guam, the Northern Mariana Islands, Puerto Rico, and the U.S. Virgin Islands). These boards are organized into six regions: * New England: Connecticut, Maine, Massachusetts, New Hampshire, Rhode Island, Vermont * Middle-Atlantic: Delaware, District of Columbia, Maryland, New Jersey, New York, Pennsylvania, Virginia, West Virginia * Southern: Alabama, Arkansas, Florida, Georgia, Louisiana, Mississippi, North Carolina, Puerto Rico, South Carolina, Tennessee, Texas, the U.S. Virgin Islands * Mid-Central: Illinois, Indiana, Iowa, Kentucky, Michigan, Minnesota, Missouri, Ohio, Wisconsin * Central States: Kansas, Montana, Nebraska, North Dakota, Oklahoma, South Dakota, Wyoming * Western: Alaska, Arizona, California, Colorado, Guam, Hawaii, Idaho, Nevada, New Mexico, the Northern Mariana Islands, Oregon, Utah, Washington Services Each U.S. jurisdiction grants individuals an architectural license. To become licensed, there are three essential components required by most jurisdictions: education, experience, and examination. NCARB maintains licensure candidate and architect records as a service to their customers and their member registration boards. Additionally, NCARB develops and administers the programs most often required to complete jurisdictions‚Äô experience and examination requirements. NCARB also facilitates reciprocity between jurisdictions and acts on behalf of its Member Boards when negotiating international agreements. Education Most U.S. jurisdictions require a professional degree from a program that is accredited by the National Architectural Accrediting Board (NAAB). NCARB publishes the NCARB Education Standard as a recommendation to its Member Boards, but requirements often vary between jurisdictions. Those who do not have a degree from a NAAB-accredited program may have their degree evaluated through the NAAB's Education Evaluation Services for Architects (EESA) if they would like to earn an NCARB Certificate. More information on the education requirement can be found in the NCARB Education Guidelines. Architectural Experience Program All U.S. jurisdictions accept completion of NCARB's Architectural Experience Program (AXP) to help satisfy their experience requirements. The AXP is a comprehensive training program that was created to ensure that licensure candidates in the architecture profession gain the knowledge and skills required for the independent practice of architecture. Architect Registration Examination The Architect Registration Examination (ARE) is required by all U.S. jurisdictions and accepted by 11 Canadian provinces to satisfy examination requirements for licensure. It is a computerized exam that assesses candidates for their knowledge, skills, and ability to provide the various services required to practice architecture independently. NCARB Record An NCARB Record is a detailed, verified record of education and training, and is used to establish qualifications for examination, registration, and certification. A licensure candidate must have an NCARB Record to participate in the Architectural Experience Program (AXP), the Architect Registration Examination (ARE), or apply for the NCARB Certificate. NCARB Certificate The NCARB Certificate facilitates reciprocal registration among all 55 NCARB Member Boards, and can be used to support an application for registration in other countries including Australia, Canada, Mexico, and New Zealand. Although certification does not qualify a person to practice architecture in a jurisdiction, it does signify that he or she has met the highest professional standards established by the registration boards responsible for protecting the health, safety, and welfare of the public. The standard requirements for the NCARB Certificate are: # A professional degree from a NAAB-accredited or CACB-accredited program. If you were educated in a foreign country, you must have your foreign education evaluated by the National Architectural Accrediting Board through the Education Evaluation Service for Architects (EESA). # Complete the Architectural Experience Program (AXP) training requirements. # Pass all divisions of the Architect Registration Examination (ARE). # Receive a license to practice from one of the U.S. registration boards. There are two alternative ways to earn an NCARB Certificate: the Education Alternative and the Foreign Architect Path to Certification. Earning an NCARB Certificate through one of these alternatives is not accepted by all jurisdictions. Architects interested in earning the NCARB Certificate through one of these programs should verify acceptance with the jurisdiction in which they wish to be licensed prior to pursuing certification. Education Alternative Architects who do not hold a professional architecture degree from a NAAB-accredited architecture program are eligible to apply for an NCARB Certificate through the Education Alternative. The alternative includes two pathways: the Two Times AXP option and the NCARB Certificate Portfolio option. To be eligible for the Two Times AXP option, applicants must: * Have at least three years of continuous licensure for the last three consecutive years in any U.S. jurisdiction without disciplinary action. * Hold bachelor's degree in an architecture- related program. ** This is defined as a baccalaureate degree in an architecture-related program from an institution with U.S. regional accreditation (or the Canadian equivalent) that is awarded after earning less than 150 semester credits or the quarter hour equivalent. ** The program must include 60 semester credit hours (90 quarter hours) of coursework in the degree program major. ** We do not have a list of accepted degrees, since the amount of architecturally defined content may vary from institution to institution. Applicants then document two times the required hours of the Architectural Experience Program (AXP). To be eligible for the NCARB Certificate Portfolio option, applicants must have at least three years of continuous licensure for the last three consecutive years in any U.S. jurisdiction without disciplinary action, and any education other than a four- year, architecture-related degree. Applicants then create an online portfolio documenting past work experience in all areas of the NCARB Education Standard. Foreign Architect Path to Certification The Broadly Experienced Foreign Architect (BEFA) program has been phased out and is no longer available as a path to NCARB certification for foreign architects. Foreign architects who are registered and in good standing in a country outside of the United States or Canada can seek NCARB certification through the Foreign Architect Path to Certification. The program has the following requirements: * Education: Have a recognized degree or education credential in an architecture program that leads to registration/credential to practice architecture in a foreign country. ** To have your education verified, please download the Transcript Request Form. You should fill in items 1-12 and submit to your academic institution. All transcripts must come directly from the academic institution. * Foreign Registration: Hold an active registration/licensure credential to practice architecture in a foreign country that has a formal record-keeping mechanism for disciplinary actions in the practice of architecture. ** To have your foreign registration verified, please download the Credential Verification Form. You should complete part A, and your credentialing authority must complete part B and submit the final form to NCARB. ** If your country does not have a regulatory body or system for taking disciplinary action, you will need to follow the licensure path for foreign-educated applicants. * Experience: Complete the AXP. Some of your foreign experience (up to 1,860 hours) may count toward the AXP requirement, but you will only be able to complete the AXP outside of the United States if you are working under an architect licensed in the United States or Canada. If you are following this path, the AXP's five-year reporting requirement does not apply to you. Learn more about the AXP. * Examination: Pass the ARE. You can begin scheduling ARE divisions after NCARB has verified your transcript and foreign credential and you have paid your Certification application fee. After these requirements have been documented, NCARB evaluates the applicant's record and issues a Certificate.https://www.ncarb.org/advance-your-career/ncarb- certificate/get-certified/foreign-architects Continuing Education NCARB assists architects in keeping their skills and knowledge up to date through its Monograph series of self-study courses. The objective of the NCARB monograph and mini-monograph series is to provide a quality continuing education resource, both economical and convenient, that investigates current and emerging topics of interest to practicing architects. The series explores everything from sustainable design to fire safety in buildings to professional conduct to post-occupancy evaluation. All learning units are American Institute of Architects (AIA) Learning Units, and most qualify as Health, Safety, and Welfare (HSW) or Sustainable Design (SD) units. International Practice NCARB has established reciprocal registration for architects in the United States, Australia, Canada, Mexico, and New Zealand, and is engaged in similar discussions with additional countries. NCARB also administers the Asia-Pacific Economic Cooperation Architects program in the United States.

It is the capital of Pleszew County (powiat pleszewski). Population is 17,892 (2004). History Guild document from Pleszew from 1630 The oldest permanent human settlements in the present-day Pleszew and its surroundings date back to the 9th century BC. The oldest known mention of Pleszew, already as a town, comes from a 1283 document of - in the document of Duke and future King of Poland Przemys≈Ç II of the Piast dynasty. In the following centuries it was a private town owned by Polish nobility, located in the Kalisz Voivodeship in the Greater Poland Province of the Polish Crown. King John I Albert in the privilege of 1493 permitted the organization of two weekly markets and two annual fairs. In the early 16th century, there were nine craft guilds in the town. Pleszew was a local center of Reformation. In the 18th century, one of two main routes connecting Warsaw and Dresden ran through Pleszew and Kings Augustus II the Strong and Augustus III of Poland traveled that route numerous times. Polish insurgents in Pleszew in January 1919 During the First Partition of Poland, in 1793, Pleszew was annexed by Prussia. It was regained by Poles as part of the short-lived Duchy of Warsaw in 1807, before it was re-annexed by Prussia in 1815. It was an important center of the unsuccessful Polish Greater Poland uprising (1848). In the following decades, to resist Germanisation, Poles founded various organizations, including agricultural, industrial and educational societies, the Cooperative Bank (Bank Sp√≥≈Çdzielczy.), a printing house, scout troops and a local branch of the \\"Sok√≥≈Ç\\" Polish Gymnastic Society. In the second half of the 19th century, new industrial factories were established. Many inhabitants took part in the Greater Poland uprising (1918‚Äì19), which aim was to reintegrate the town along with the region of Greater Poland with Poland, after the country regained independence in 1918. The Poles took control of the city in January 1919. On the day of the German invasion of Poland (World War II), on September 1, Germany unsuccessfully air raided Polish military barracks, killing 13 civilians insdead. Wehrmacht troops entered the town a week later. During the German occupation of Poland, the Polish population was subject to mass arrests, executions and expulsions. Shortly after capturing the town, the Germans established a prison for Polish people in the town.Maria Wardzy≈Ñska, By≈Ç rok 1939. Operacja niemieckiej policji bezpiecze≈Ñstwa w Polsce.

Higher Institute of Engineering in Advanced Systems and Networks  Grenoble Institute of Technology (Institut National Polytechnique de Grenoble) INPG has 9 schools - Esisar being the most recent. Each year it confers 1000 degrees in engineering, 300 Master's degrees as well as 200 PhD theses. It has 31 research laboratories which are associated with the CNRS (the French National Scientific Research Centre). Esisar opened its doors in 1995 to satisfy a new need expressed by many firms: to have engineers mastering all the abilities required to achieve and to put into operation advanced systems, in particular electronics, automation and industrial information technology. In fact, Advanced Systems constitute the future of the industry. They allow the more rapid creation of new products (analysis & design), manufacturing at a lower cost while ensuring good quality (regulation and a constant supervision of the processes) and they make them distinct from competing products - \`smart' items and innovative functions, for example. With this ambition in mind, Esisar was born from a unique alliance in France - Grenoble University of Technology (INPG), the leading French centre for the training of engineers and the CCI for the Dr√¥me region. These two partners have developed an original teaching method, giving the same value to the classic teachings of an engineering school as to the realities of the industrial world. Esisar is, for example, the only school which offers fourth year students the opportunity to complete an industrial project, carried out for a client company which defines the content. The INPG/ESISAR engineering diploma was entitled and certified by the National Commission in November 1994.  First and second years At Esisar students are in contact with the reality of the engineering field during the first two years: electronics, automation and computer science. In the same way, early apprenticeship of industrial skills (accountancy, marketing, project management, etc.) is given to them and this continues for five years. Mathematics and physics are taught from the first to the fourth year, and are considered as basic, necessary tools for technical disciplines.  Third year  Esisar proposes a multi- disciplinary apprenticeship, carried out with constant concern for balance. Electronics, automation, industrial computing and all industrial equipment, all benefit from generous periods of study time. For the students who join the school in the third year, their cycle starts off with six weeks of class on technical disciplines, while the students who joined in the first year are on technical training. Therefore, the different levels are harmonised.  Fourth year  In fourth year, all student-engineers have the chance of experiencing during a six-month industrial project. This project, commissioned by a client company, is based on a feasibility study, a model or a prototype. It contributes to the creation of a product or a new function, with industrial stakes which are also imposed on the student-engineers. Organised in teams of three, supported by an appointed study supervisor, they experience a stirring time for six months. The knowledge they get is both pedagogical (a study of real meaning, a project to manage) and professional contact with technology transference. Some projects have led to products which are highly commercialised today.  Fifth year  With the industrial project, the student-engineers have learnt how to use their many skills to carry out a project. The teaching in the 5th year is conceived in keeping with the same logic using electronics, computer science and other industrial techniques, with importance attached to synthesis, effective pooling of knowledge and the deepening of scientific understanding. After following a common programme, the student engineers choose between two \\"in depth\\" modules. The ISE module - embedded computer science, is oriented towards software aspects of advanced systems. The ISD module - command and integration of the systems and devices, is oriented towards the material aspects. Conferences led by industrialists and researchers allow students to benefit from high level coaching on the \\"state of the art\\" in their future field of activity. The year ends with a six-month industrial project.

Early years Born in Toronto, Smythe played hockey for Upper Canada College and Runnymede Collegiate Institute in the 1930s and then went to the University of Toronto where he graduated with an engineering degree. He played one season with the Varsity Blues men's ice hockey team. In the 1940‚Äì41 season, he briefly played with the Toronto Marlboros, managed by Harold Ballard, whom Smythe had known since he was a young boy. Smythe enlisted in the Royal Canadian Navy during World War II. After the war, he became a partner in his father's gravel business. In the late 1940s, he was hired as coach of the Marlboros by Ballard, the team president. Smythe was later promoted to managing director. Managing the Maple Leafs In March 1957, Smythe became chairman of a seven- person committee appointed by his father to run hockey operations for the Leafs. He had been a critic of assistant general manager Hap Day, who had run the Leafs' hockey operations from 1955 to 1957 while Conn Smythe retained the title of general manager. Stafford accused Day of mismanaging younger players, especially those coming up from the Marlboros, and of sticking with an outdated defensive style of hockey. Smythe's committee became known as the Silver Seven. Initially, all members were in their 30s or early 40s, but before the end of the year, 54-year-old Ballard was appointed to the committee to fill a vacancy. The committee hired Howie Meeker as general manager, but fired him before the start of the season, leaving the Leafs without a general manager for the 1957‚Äì58 season. Smythe, as committee chairman, was effectively the team's general manager that year. In 1958, they hired Punch Imlach to run hockey operations while the committee focused on the business side. Stafford frequently clashed with his father over the next few years. However, in November 1961, along with partners Ballard and John Bassett‚Äîboth members of the Silver Seven‚ÄîStafford Smythe bought control of the Maple Leafs from his father, paying $2.3 million for 45,000 of his father's 50,000 shares. Conn later claimed that he believed he was only selling the team to his son, but it is not likely that Stafford would have been able to raise the money on his own. Stafford succeeded his father as president of Maple Leaf Gardens and governor of the Maple Leafs. Ballard, who had fronted most of the purchase money, became executive vice-president and alternate governor. Bassett became vice-chairman of the Gardens board of directors. The Leafs, who had gone 11 years without winning a Stanley Cup, won the trophy four times in their first six seasons under the new owners. Profitability was increased through expanded seating capacity at Maple Leaf Gardens and the sale of advertising to sponsors throughout the building. Stafford Smythe name appears on the Stanley Cup 5 times - 1932 (as Mascot), 1962, 1963, 1964, 1967 (as President) all with Toronto. In 1932 Smythe became youngest person engraved on the Stanley Cup at age 11. Scandal and arrest Following an RCMP raid at the Gardens in 1968, Smythe was charged with income tax evasion and accused, along with Ballard, of illegally taking money from Maple Leaf Gardens Ltd. to pay for renovations of their houses and other personal expenses. Just before the charges were laid, Bassett, who had succeeded Conn Smythe as chairman of the board in 1962, argued to the board that Smythe and Ballard should be removed from their posts. Following an 8‚Äì7 vote of the board of directors on June 26, 1969; Smythe and Ballard were both fired, and Bassett was appointed president of the Gardens. The move came just a couple of months after Smythe had fired Imlach after an unimpressive season from the Leafs. However, Bassett did not force Smythe and Ballard to sell their shares, and both men remained on the board. This proved to be a serious strategic blunder; Smythe was the largest single shareholder in Maple Leaf Gardens, and he and Ballard controlled almost half the company's stock between them. They were thus able to stage a proxy war and regain control of the board in 1970. Smythe was once again appointed president. Facing an untenable situation, Bassett sold his shares in the Gardens to Smythe and Ballard for $6 million in 1971. Ballard would be convicted of tax evasion, but Smythe died of a bleeding ulcer at age 50 just before his trial was scheduled to begin.

In some Church of England dioceses rural deans have been formally renamed as area deans. Origins The title \\"dean\\" (Latin decanus) may derive from the custom of dividing a hundred into ten tithings, not least as rural deaneries originally corresponded with the hundreds or commotes or cantrefi in Wales. Many rural deaneries retain these ancient names.Cross, F. L., ed. (1957) The Oxford Dictionary of the Christian Church. London: Oxford University Press; p. 1188. The first mention of rural deans comes from a law made by Edward the Confessor, which refers to the rural dean being appointed by the bishop \\"to have the inspection of clergy and people from within the district to which he was incumbent... to which end [he] had power to convene rural chapters.\\"General Synod Misc Paper 984 2011 The first known rural dean is Robert de Eclesfield who was appointed to the position in the diocese of York in 1148.Chichester Diocese Guidelines for Rural Deans 2009 In medieval times rural deans acted as officers of the diocesan bishop and prepared business for the archdeacons to determine at their visitations. Archdeacons gradually took over most of the duties of rural deans and the office was allowed to become a sinecure by the 16th century.Cutts, E. L. (1895) A Dictionary of the Church of England; 3rd ed. London: S. P. C. K.; pp. 532-33 Roman Catholic usage In the Roman Catholic Church, a dean or rural dean is a priest, usually pastor of a parish within the deanery area. The dean serves as a liaison between the diocesan bishop and the priests and parishes of the deanery, and chairs meetings of the clergy of the deanery. He serves many of the same functions, with somewhat less canonical authority, than an episcopal vicar does. Church of England usage In the Church of England, the office of rural dean was revived by the Bishop of Norwich in 1836/1837. During the nineteenth century the office became more significant, and by the middle of the century rural deaneries were established in law, which also made provision for the modification of deanery boundaries, through the provisions of the Archdeaconries and Rural Deaneries Act of 1874 (37 & 38 Vict., cap. 63). Canon C23 sets out the legal basis of the current role of rural deans. It sets out that rural deans will report to the bishop on significant matters, including illness and vacancies, and will investigate if there are problems in the parish. It also sets out that the rural dean will be joint chair, with the Lay Chair, of the deanery synod.Canons of the Church of England section C The current role of the rural dean has been summarised by the Diocese of Chichester as: # helping the Bishop in his episcope and care of the deanery # providing a supportive and collaborative leadership for mission and ministry in the deanery # convening Chapter and co-chairing Deanery Synod and its work; being a friend to clergy and lay leaders of the parishes; # sometimes deputising for the archdeacon in his parish visitations Rural deans also usually have a significant role during clergy vacancies, along with the churchwardens and are often involved in the selection of new clergy.Carlisle Diocese job description It is also becoming increasingly common to appoint assistant rural deans, to reduce the workload of rural deans.Diocese of Bath and Wells Handbook 2012 The Church of England (Miscellaneous Provisions) Measure 2000 2.12(4) allows the diocesan bishop to officially rename a rural dean as an area dean.The Church of England (Miscellaneous Provisions) Measure 2000 See also *Dean (religion) *Archpriest for historical context References . . .

A deanery is either the jurisdiction or residence of a dean.  Catholic usage  In the Catholic Church, Can.374 ¬ß2 of the Code of Canon Law grants to bishops the possibility to join together several neighbouring parishes into special groups, such as vicariates forane, or deaneries.Particular Churches and the Authority Established in Them (Cann. 368‚Äì430) from the 1983 Code of Canon Law at the website of the Holy See Each deanery is headed by a vicar forane, also called a dean or archpriest, who is‚Äîaccording to the definition provided in canon 553‚Äîa priest appointed by the bishop after consultation with the priests exercising ministry in the deanery. Canon 555 defines the duties of a dean as:Vicars Forane (Cann. 553‚Äì555) from the 1983 Code of Canon Law at the website of the Holy See * promotion and coordination of the common pastoral activity within the deanery; * seeing that the clerics of the deanery lead a life in harmony with their state in life and perform their duties with diligence; * seeing that religious functions follow Church norms; * seeing that the good appearance of churches and sacred furnishings are maintained; * seeing that parish books are correctly managed; * seeing that the parish rectory is well maintained; * seeing that clerics, following the norms of the diocese and the norms of Canon 272, attend theological lectures, meetings, or conferences; * making sure that the priests of the deanery have access to spiritual helps and aid in difficult pastoral circumstances; and * making sure that pastors in his deanery are well cared for when they are sick or dying. Additionally, the dean must follow the particular norms of the diocese. Canon 555 also particularly mentions that a dean must visit the parishes of the district in accord with the regulations made by the diocesan bishop.  Anglican usage  In the Church of England and many other Anglican churches a deanery is a group of parishes forming a district within an archdeaconry. The more formal term, rural deanery, is less often used, though the superintendent of a deanery is the Rural Dean. Rural deaneries are very ancient and originally corresponded with the hundreds. The title \\"dean\\" (Latin decanus) may derive from the custom of dividing a hundred into ten tithings. In medieval times rural deans acted as officers of the diocesan bishop, but archdeacons gradually took over most of their duties. However, the office was revived during the 19th century. Modifications to deanery boundaries may be made according to the provisions of the Archdeaconries and Rural Deaneries Act of 1874 (37 & 38 Vict., cap. 63).Cross, F. L., ed. (1957). The Oxford Dictionary of the Christian Church. London: Oxford University Press; p. 1188.Cutts, E. L. (1895). A Dictionary of the Church of England; 3rd ed. London: S. P. C. K.; pp. 532‚Äì33. The deanery synod has a membership of all clergy who are licensed to a parish within the deanery, plus elected lay members from every parish. They were established in the 1970s. The term is also often used to refer to the house, or official residence, of the dean of a cathedral. The term is also used to apply to the ecclesiastical districts of Jersey and Guernsey, which are Royal Peculiars and whose deans hold a status more nearly equivalent to an Archdeacon than a rural dean. In the Episcopal Church, deaneries are synonymous with convocations and are headed by deans.  Eastern Orthodox usage  Deaneries also exist in the Eastern Orthodox Church, where they are subdivisions of a diocese.  References  Further reading  * MacMorran K. M. & Briden T.

In early September, a trough of low pressure moved south into the Gulf of Mexico, and became stationary. A low pressure center developed along this trough, and on September 5, a Hurricane Hunter airplane reported that the system had gained sufficient organization to be a tropical depression, southeast of Galveston. The depression drifted south-southwest while strengthening, reaching its peak strength of on the morning of September 6. The system then made an abrupt turn to the west-northwest, and remained steady in strength and course until landfall the next day, near Matagorda. The system weakened at a fast rate after landfall, but its circulation would not totally dissipate for three more days. The storm caused extremely heavy rainfall in inland areas; damage totalled $4.5 million (2002 USD; $5.2 million USD in 2007); no deaths occurred as a result of Fay. Meteorological history In the first few days of September 2002, an upper-level trough emerged in the Gulf of Mexico and stalled. Thunderstorms developed along the trough and concentrated around a weak low pressure system. Gradually, the trough and associated low pressure drifted south into the warm waters of the Gulf of Mexico. A low pressure area in the northwest Gulf of Mexico became the dominant circulation and slowly developed persistent convection near the center. On September 5, a reconnaissance aircraft investigated the system. During the flight, a low-level center became evident and some deep convection persisted; as a result, it was classified as a tropical depression. Wind shear within the Gulf of Mexico was weak and remained favorable to tropical cyclone formation. A reconnaissance flight later that day discovered an ill-defined circulation which led to low confidence of the location of the center of circulation. However, enough convection persisted for the depression to be upgraded into Tropical Storm Fay that evening. Stationary in movement, the associated convection became removed from the center of circulation; despite this, the system gradually intensified. On September 6, the storm reached its peak intensity of 60 mph (100 km/h). Light wind shear prevented Fay from intensifying further, and the gradual movement was dictated by a weak mid- level ridge to the north. A low pressure system to the south of Fay produced wind shear and resulted in decreased convection on the southern half of the circulation, with the majority of convective activity located on the northern half. Fay soon became disorganized which prompted National Hurricane Center forecaster Avila to state, \\"[Fay] rather resembles a subtropical storm\\". Fay moved little, and intensified slightly late on September 6. On September 7, Fay began to drift northwest towards the Texas coast as rainbands reached the northwest portion of the Texas coastline. Fay accelerated towards the Texas coast and made landfall early on September 7. The storm meandered throughout inland Texas, and as the system moved inland, forward speed decreased and Fay weakened to a tropical depression. The last advisory was issued on Fay on September 7, although the depression persisted for several days just inland of the Texas Coast. Preparations Coinciding with the development of the tropical depression, forecasters issued a tropical storm warning for parts of the Texas coast. When the depression was upgraded into Tropical Storm Fay, the warnings were extended from Matagorda, Texas to coastal Louisiana. On September 8, forecasters extended the warnings to Port Aransas, Texas, and areas from Port O'Connor to High Island, Texas were put under a hurricane watch as the storm was forecast to reach hurricane strength before making landfall. However, the hurricane watch for those areas were discontinued when Fay failed to reach hurricane strength. In addition, coastal Texas as well as coastal Louisiana were under a coastal flood warning, while parts of inland Texas were under flash flood warnings and flood warnings. Schools closed in Galveston and High Island on September 6 in anticipation of the storm, and voluntary evacuation orders were put into effect along low-lying coastal areas. Some grocery stores in Angleton reported supply shortages. Impact Rainfall totals from Tropical Storm Fay In Louisiana and Mississippi, effects were minor, and limited to moderate rain up to three inches (76 mm). The effects in Texas were moderate to severe in some locations, with flooding being the main source of damage. In total, 400 houses sustained damage from flooding. Along the coast, a waterspout spawned by Fay made landfall, and caused minor damage along the northern end of Galveston Island. Storm surge along the Texas coast was 4.5 feet (1.1 m) above the normal high tide. Peak rainfall throughout the area was in the range of 10-15 inches (250‚Äì380 mm). Severe damage resulted from Fay in Sweeny, where about 1,000 homes and businesses were damaged by the storm, and there was $3.5 million (2002 USD; $4.1 million 2007 USD) in damage. Rainfall totals up to 24 inches (600 mm) caused severe flash flooding there, and in areas near there. Another area that received severe damage from Fay was Matagorda County, where flooding from the storm left $1.3 million (2002 USD; $1.5 million 2007 USD) in damage to roads and public facilities. Twelve tornadoes were reported during Fay's landfall; the most notable one destroyed a mobile home, and damaged a barn. Heavy rain from Fay's remnants also dropped 2-3 inches (50‚Äì75 mm) of rain over Frio County. Rainfall of 8 inches (200 mm) was reported near the Atascosca County line with an isolated report of 12 inches (300 mm) in other areas. The rainfall caused severe flashflooding which forced people to flee to roof tops. Damage to buildings, roads and crops totaled up to $800,000 (2002 USD; $940,000 2007 USD). In Mexico, effects were mostly related to rainfall; up to 16 inches (400 mm) fell in some areas. When Fay flooded areas such as Nuevo Laredo, Tamaulipas, 100 families were evacuated from their homes, and 120 people were stranded in hotels. It is reported that in that town, 10 trees fell causing little or no damage. Also, the Rio Grande flooded its banks to 3.3 meters (10 ft) above flood stage. It is reported that 300 families were not able to return to their homes for several weeks as a result of the flooding. Aftermath Nine counties in Texas were declared disaster areas after Tropical Storm Fay: Brazoria, Frio, Galveston, La Salle, Live Oak, Matagorda, Nueces, San Patricio and Wharton. The declaration enabled business owners and residents to apply for federal and state government aid programs. Disaster housing checks handed out after the storm totaled to over $2.7 million (2002 USD; $3.1 million 2007 USD) and the Federal Emergency Management Agency (FEMA) had carried out over 2,700 home and building inspections. Non- government relief programs such as The Individual and Family Grant Program had distributed over $400,000 (2002 USD; $469,000 2007 USD) in checks, and over $1 million (2002 USD; $1.2 million 2007 USD) in relief funds. The Small Business Administration also funded over $250,000 (2002 USD; $294,000 2007 USD) in relief aid. After Tropical Storm Fay, the Internal Revenue Service (IRS) announced that they would apply special tax relief for the nine counties in Texas that were declared disaster areas.

Hart, Charlie Ray, Bryant Washburn, Wally Reid and others. She was five feet three inches high, weighed a hundred and ten pounds, and had blond hair and greyish blue eyes. She was an able sportswoman. With the advent of sound, Hawley's movie career largely ended; her last film was released in 1932.

It was constructed in 1904, with the horseshoe shape designed to fit the approach ramps into a constricted site. The bridge was closed from the end of 2009 to early 2010 to enable conversion to two-way traffic flow. Description A section of the Horseshoe Bridge The Horseshoe Bridge is a classically inspired brick and stucco traffic bridge located in the central business district of Perth, Western Australia. The bridge connects the Perth CBD to Northbridge by allowing traffic to continue along William Street and pass over the railway lines, to the west of Perth railway station. The bridge's name is derived from its shape: a horseshoe. This design was an innovative solution to the problem of bridging a railway within tight urban constraints. The bridge is a handsome structure of its period and a very sophisticated piece of urban design. The main structural elements of the bridge are of steel, and it is supported by a series of semi-circular arches with rendered decorative treatment. Many of the arches on the Wellington Street elevation have been enclosed with glass, which in the past created shop fronts to retail spaces behind. The balustrades are rendered concrete and sculptures of swans decorate the end piers. These were specifically designed for the bridge project.City of Perth Heritage. Accessed 21 March 2006. It is well integrated within its context and its value goes beyond mere transport. The winding form adds vitality to the Perth railway station precinct and the architecture contributes to the streetscape of Wellington Street. The bridge has four traffic lanes, which, in 1986, carried approximately 18,000 vehicles per day into the city. The western footpath of the bridge has an entry point to Yagan Square. The eastern footpath formerly gave direct access to the train station which was later removed when it became a gated station. History Horseshoe Bridge The bridge was constructed in 1904 to reduce train-induced traffic congestion in William Street. During the last decade of the 19th century, WA's Engineer-in-Chief, C. Y. O'Connor, had overseen the construction of Perth's suburban railway system, which radiated out from a central railway station in Wellington Street in the city. As the line effectively cut the city off from its northern suburbs, a number of bridges and level crossings had to be built to connect the two areas. A bridge over the railway was constructed between Barrack and Beaufort Streets in 1894, as well as two pedestrian crossings, however by the mid 1890s there were seven lines and the William Street crossing was closed for most of the day as railway traffic continued to increase. In a site with no land for approaches, the shape of the proposed William Street bridge was chosen as the only viable option for achieving the necessary gradients for horsedrawn vehicles. It was initially unpopular in some circles because it replaced the two pedestrian overpasses and the shape of the new bridge meant that pedestrians had to walk a great deal further to pass over the railway lines. Overall however, traffic increased strongly, with a favourable impact on the commercial development of William Street. Traffic could now pass between the northern and southern parts of the city independently of railway traffic and without the delays at the William Street crossing. The bridge is one of the oldest surviving bridges in central Perth. Structurally it has been modified to accommodate heavier vehicles, but the work has been undertaken in a manner that preserves the authenticity of the original design. The bridge enjoys heritage recognition, including listings on the Heritage Council‚Äôs State Register of Heritage Places,Register of Heritage Places. Accessed 12 December 2013 the Register of the National Estate, City of Perth‚Äôs Municipal Inventory and the National Trust. Perth City Centre, Perth, Australia. Accessed 21 March 2006 The bridge was closed on 30 November 2009 for restoration and conversion to two-way traffic.

He made his major league debut on May 18, 1991 with the Indians, and played his final game on October 7, 2001. He is known primarily for being the player received by the Astros from the Indians in exchange for outfielder Kenny Lofton, a trade that many consider to be one of the most lopsided moves made in the 1990s, as Lofton went on to have an excellent career, while Taubensee played less than three full seasons with the Astros before he was traded to the Reds. Taubensee had a solid season in 1995 with the Reds, and he had the last postseason hit (an NLCS 8th inning single vs. the Braves) the Reds would have until 2010. Taubensee's best season came in 1999 as a member of Cincinnati Reds, when he surprisingly became one of club's best hitters for a team which was a surprise contender and nearly made the playoffs (ultimately losing an extra regular season game to go to the wildcard game to the New York Mets).

The Kohn‚ÄìSham equation is defined by a local effective (fictitious) external potential in which the non- interacting particles move, typically denoted as vs(r) or veff(r), called the Kohn‚ÄìSham potential. As the particles in the Kohn‚ÄìSham system are non- interacting fermions, the Kohn‚ÄìSham wavefunction is a single Slater determinant constructed from a set of orbitals that are the lowest-energy solutions to : \\\\left(-\\\\frac{\\\\hbar^2}{2m} abla^2 + v_\\\\text{eff}(\\\\mathbf r)\\\\right) \\\\varphi_i(\\\\mathbf r) = \\\\varepsilon_i \\\\varphi_i(\\\\mathbf r). This eigenvalue equation is the typical representation of the Kohn‚ÄìSham equations. Here Œµi is the orbital energy of the corresponding Kohn‚ÄìSham orbital œÜi, and the density for an N-particle system is : \\\\rho(\\\\mathbf r) = \\\\sum_i^N \\\\varphi_i(\\\\mathbf r)^2. The Kohn‚ÄìSham equations are named after Walter Kohn and Lu Jeu Sham (Ê≤àÂëÇ‰πù), who introduced the concept at the University of California, San Diego in 1965. Kohn‚ÄìSham potential In Kohn‚ÄìSham density functional theory, the total energy of a system is expressed as a functional of the charge density as : E[\\\\rho] = T_s[\\\\rho] + \\\\int d\\\\mathbf r\\\\, v_\\\\text{ext}(\\\\mathbf r) \\\\rho(\\\\mathbf r) + E_\\\\text{H}[\\\\rho] + E_\\\\text{xc}[\\\\rho], where Ts is the Kohn‚ÄìSham kinetic energy, which is expressed in terms of the Kohn‚ÄìSham orbitals as : T_s[\\\\rho] = \\\\sum_{i=1}^N \\\\int d\\\\mathbf r\\\\, \\\\phi_i^*(\\\\mathbf r) \\\\left(-\\\\frac{\\\\hbar^2}{2m} abla^2\\\\right) \\\\phi_i(\\\\mathbf r), vext is the external potential acting on the interacting system (at minimum, for a molecular system, the electron‚Äìnuclei interaction), EH is the Hartree (or Coulomb) energy : E_\\\\text{H}[\\\\rho] = \\\\frac{e^2}{2} \\\\int d\\\\mathbf r \\\\int d\\\\mathbf{r}'\\\\, \\\\frac{\\\\rho(\\\\mathbf r) \\\\rho(\\\\mathbf r')}{\\\\mathbf r - \\\\mathbf r'}, and Exc is the exchange‚Äìcorrelation energy. The Kohn‚ÄìSham equations are found by varying the total energy expression with respect to a set of orbitals, subject to constraints on those orbitals, to yield the Kohn‚ÄìSham potential as : v_\\\\text{eff}(\\\\mathbf r) = v_\\\\text{ext}(\\\\mathbf{r}) + e^2 \\\\int \\\\frac{\\\\rho(\\\\mathbf{r}')}{\\\\mathbf r - \\\\mathbf r'} \\\\,d\\\\mathbf{r}' + \\\\frac{\\\\delta E_\\\\text{xc}[\\\\rho]}{\\\\delta\\\\rho(\\\\mathbf r)}, where the last term : v_\\\\text{xc}(\\\\mathbf r) \\\\equiv \\\\frac{\\\\delta E_\\\\text{xc}[\\\\rho]}{\\\\delta\\\\rho(\\\\mathbf r)} is the exchange‚Äìcorrelation potential. This term, and the corresponding energy expression, are the only unknowns in the Kohn‚ÄìSham approach to density functional theory. An approximation that does not vary the orbitals is Harris functional theory. The Kohn‚ÄìSham orbital energies Œµi, in general, have little physical meaning (see Koopmans' theorem). The sum of the orbital energies is related to the total energy as : E = \\\\sum_i^N \\\\varepsilon_i - E_\\\\text{H}[\\\\rho] + E_\\\\text{xc}[\\\\rho] - \\\\int \\\\frac{\\\\delta E_\\\\text{xc}[\\\\rho]}{\\\\delta\\\\rho(\\\\mathbf r)} \\\\rho(\\\\mathbf{r}) \\\\,d\\\\mathbf{r}. Because the orbital energies are non-unique in the more general restricted open-shell case, this equation only holds true for specific choices of orbital energies (see Koopmans' theorem).

Right, a cross section of the ventral nerve cord, illustrating input and output. Adapted with permission from The ventral nerve cord (VNC) is a major structure of the invertebrate central nervous system. It is the functional equivalent of the vertebrate spinal cord. The VNC coordinates neural signaling from the brain to the body and vice versa, integrating sensory input and locomotor output Decapitated insects can still walk, groom, and mate, illustrating that the circuitry of the VNC is sufficient to perform complex motor programs without brain input. Structure The VNC contains ascending and descending neurons that relay information to and from the brain, motor neurons that project into the body and synapse onto muscles, sensory neurons that receive information from the body and environment, and interneurons that coordinate circuitry of all of these neurons. The neurons of the VNC are organized into segmental ganglia with the nerve cords running down the ventral (\\"belly\\", as opposed to back) plane of the organism. Ventral nerve cords from anterior to posterior (the thoracic and abdominal tagma in the arthropods) are made up of segmental ganglia that are connected by a tract of nerve fibers passing from one side to the other of the nerve cord called commissures. The complete system bears some likeness to a rope ladder. In some animals the bilateral ganglia are fused into a single large ganglion per segment. Evolution Ventral nerve cords are found in some phyla of the bilaterians, particularly within the nematodes, annelids and the arthropods. They are well-studied within insects, and VNCs have been described in over 300 species covering all the major orders. The presumed common ancestral structure is rarely observed; instead the VNCs of most insects show extensive modification as well as convergence. Modifications include shifts in neuromere positions, their fusion to form composite ganglia, and, potentially, their separation to revert to individual ganglia. Development The insect VNC develops according to a body plan based on a segmental set of 30 paired and one unpaired neuroblasts. A neuroblast can be uniquely identified based on its position in the array, its pattern of molecular expression, and the suite of early neurons that it produces. Each neuroblast gives rise to two hemilineages: an \\"A\\" hemilineage characterized by active Notch signalling, and a \\"B\\" hemilineage characterized by an absence of active Notch signalling. Research in the fruit fly D. melanogaster suggests that all neurons of a given hemilineage release the same primary neurotransmitter. Engrailed is a transcription factor that helps regulate the gene _frazzled_ in order to separate neuroblasts during embryonic development. The segregation of neuroblasts is essential for the formation and development of the VNC.

Early height finders were optical range finder devices combined with simple mechanical computers, while later systems migrated to radar devices. The unique vertical oscillating motion of height finder radars led to them also being known as nodding radar. Devices combining both optics and radar were deployed by the U.S. Military.  Optical  In World War II, a height finder was an optical rangefinder used to determine the altitude of an aircraft (actually the slant range from the emplacement which was combined with the angle of sight, in a mechanical computer, to produce altitude), used to direct anti-aircraft guns.The Gunnery Pocket Book, paragraph 428. Examples of American and Japanese versions exist. In the Soviet Union it was usually combined with optical rangefinders.  Radar  A height finder radar is a type of 2-dimensional radar that measures altitude of a target. The operator slews the antenna toward a desired bearing, identifies a target echo at a desired range on the RHI display (RHI = range height indicator), then bisects the target with a cursor that is scaled to indicate the approximate altitude of the target. Such systems often complement 2-dimensional radars which find distance and direction (search radar); thus using two 2-dimensional systems to obtain a 3-dimensional aerial picture. Height finding radars of the 1960s and 70s were distinguished by their antenna being tall, but narrow. As beam shape is a function of antenna shape, the height finder beam was flat and wide horizontally (i.e., not very good at determining bearing to the target), but very thin vertically, allowing accurate measurement of elevation angle, thus altitude. Modern 3D radar sets find both azimuth and elevation, making separate height finder radars largely obsolete.
