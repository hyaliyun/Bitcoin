The population was 464 at the 2000 Census. Willet, now a ghost town, was located in Adams. History The earliest settlers were Cornish lead miners; they were followed by settlers from New England, Ireland, Switzerland and Norway. The town has been the home of a Lutheran and a Catholic parish. Saint Francis Catholic Church was formed and built by Catholic immigrants from Ireland, but later merged with Saint Joseph Catholic Church in Argyle, Wisconsin, and the church was eventually torn down; only the cemetery remains. Adams Lutheran Church, Evangelical Lutheran Church in America (ELCA), was formed by Norwegian immigrants from the Valdres and Hadeland areas of Norway and was originally served by clergy of the Church of Norway. It later became a member of the Conference of the Norwegian-Danish Evangelical Lutheran Church of America. Under the increasing influence of the Haugean pietist movement among Norwegian American clergy and parishes, it joined a group originally called the Friends of Augsburg, which subsequently became the Lutheran Free Church. Later, when it began to call its pastors from clergy of The American Lutheran Church, it became a member of that body. It became a member of the ELCA when the American Lutheran Church merged with two other Lutheran synods. The original church was built by the first parishioners during the American Civil War from limestone quarried from a site below the ridge on which the church stood. Later, the inside walls of the sanctuary were covered with a darkly varnished wooden wainscoting) of a very distinctive herringbone pattern. After serving the parish for almost a century and a half, the church burned and a new one was built on a site immediately adjacent to the original within a year.Dictionary of Wisconsin History.

The museum curator said that the railroad was being wooed by two different towns and decided to split the difference and created Brodhead. A nearby race way was dredged off of a branch of the Sugar River that diverted a long canal to a hydroelectric generator that supplied electricity to the town. This gave Brodhead the distinction of having electrical service before other larger cities such as Chicago, and perhaps the first electrical service in Wisconsin.Contact the Brodhead Museum and Historical Society for details and verification.

It was part of a large outbreak of storms that started the evening before with tornadoes also touching down in Kansas, Missouri, Iowa, and Minnesota. Although a tornado watch had been issued late on the night of June 7, most residents were unaware that a storm was approaching until they were awakened by a lightning strike and an instantaneous clap of thunder just before 12:41 AM CDT. The 0.4-mile (0.60-km) wide tornado caused F5 damage, the highest level on the Fujita scale. Two hundred of the village's 584 residents were injured and nine were killed. Seventeen of the 18 businesses in Barneveld were destroyed, including all the government offices, the fire station, library, and post office. The town's three churches were all flattened: the Congregational United Church of Christ, pastor Rev. Jann Cather Weaver, the Lutheran Church, pastor Rev. Robert Twiton, and the Roman Catholic Church. The Congregational UCC church also lost its parsonage. In all, about 170 of the village's 225 commercial, agricultural, and residential buildings were either destroyed instantly or damaged seriously enough that they were unable to be rebuilt. The only remaining and largely undamaged structure was the water tower, which had to be repaired and repainted. Damage to the village of Barneveld was estimated at $25 million with damage to the surrounding area put at about $40 million. Rebuilding began immediately, and by 2000, the population of Barneveld was almost exactly double what it was at the time the tornado nearly destroyed the town. The thunderstorm that created the tornado also put on one of the brightest lightning shows in recorded history, generating 200 strikes per minute.

Historically, this included cities such as Rome, Athens, Carthage, and the Italian city-states during the Renaissance. Only a few modern sovereign city- states exist, with some disagreement as to which qualify; Monaco, Singapore, and Vatican City are most commonly accepted as such. Singapore is the clearest example, with full self-governance, its own currency, a robust military, and a population of 5.6 million. A number of other small states share many of these characteristics, and are sometimes cited as modern city-states, such as Qatar,Parker, Geoffrey. 2005.

Historical background = Ancient and medieval world  Historical city-states included Sumerian cities such as Uruk and Ur; Ancient Egyptian city-states, such as Thebes and Memphis; the Phoenician cities (such as Tyre and Sidon); the five Philistine city-states; the Berber city-states of the Garamantes; the city-states of ancient Greece (the poleis such as Athens, Sparta, Thebes, and Corinth); the Roman Republic (which grew from a city-state into a great power); the Mayan and other cultures of pre- Columbian Mesoamerica (including cities such as Chichen Itza, Tikal, Cop√°n and Monte Alb√°n); the central Asian cities along the Silk Road; the city-states of the Swahili coast; Venice; Genoa; Florence; Ragusa; states of the medieval Russian lands such as Novgorod and Pskov; and many others. Danish historian Poul Holm has classed the Viking colonial cities in medieval Ireland, most importantly Dublin, as city-states.Holm, Poul, \\"Viking Dublin and the City- State Concept: Parameters and Significance of the Hiberno-Norse Settlement\\" (Respondent: Donnchadh √ì Corr√°in), in Mogens Herman Hansen (ed.), A Comparative Study of Thirty City-State Cultures . Denmark: Special-Trykkeriet Viborg. (University of Copenhagen, Polis Center). 2000. pp. 251‚Äì62. The Republic of Ragusa, a maritime city-state, was based in the walled city of Dubrovnik In Cyprus, the Phoenician settlement of Kition (in present-day Larnaca) was a city-state that existed from around 800 BC until the end of the 4th century BC. Some of the most well-known examples of city-state culture in human history are the ancient Greek city-states and the merchant city-states of Renaissance Italy, which organised themselves as small independent centers. The success of small regional units coexisting as autonomous actors in loose geographical and cultural unity, as in Italy and Greece, often prevented their amalgamation into larger national units. However, such small political entities often survived only for short periods because they lacked the resources to defend themselves against incursions by larger states (such as Roman conquest of Greece). Thus they inevitably gave way to larger organisations of society, including the empire and the nation-state.Sri Aurobindo, \\"Ideal of Human Unity\\" included in Social and Political Thought, 1970. Southeast Asia In the history of mainland Southeast Asia, aristocratic groups, Buddhist leaders, and others organized settlements into autonomous or semi-autonomous city-states. These were referred to as mueang, and were usually related in a tributary relationship now described as mandala or as over-lapping sovereignty, in which smaller city-states paid tribute to larger ones that paid tribute to still larger ones‚Äîuntil reaching the apex in cities like Ayutthaya, Bagan, Bangkok and others that served as centers of Southeast Asian royalty. The system existed until the 19th century, when colonization by European powers occurred. Siam, a regional power at the time, needed to define their territories for negotiation with the European powers so the Siamese government established a nation-state system, incorporated their tributary cities (Lan Xang, Cambodia and some Malay cities) into their territory and abolished the mueang and the tributary system. Winichakul, Thongchai. 1997. Siam Mapped: A History of the Geo-Body of a Nation. Honolulu: University of Hawaii PressBaker, Chris and Pasuk Phongpaichit. 2009. A History of Thailand: 2nd ed. Sydney: Cambridge University Press In early Philippine history, the barangay was a complex sociopolitical unit which scholars have historically considered the dominant organizational pattern among the various peoples of the Philippine archipelago. , . These sociopolitical units were sometimes also referred to as barangay states, but are more properly referred to using the technical term polity. Evidence suggests a considerable degree of independence as city states ruled by Datus, Rajahs and Sultans. Early chroniclers record that the name evolved from the term balangay, which refers to a plank boat widely used by various cultures of the Philippine archipelago prior to the arrival of European colonizers. Central Europe Free imperial cities as of 1792. In the Holy Roman Empire (962‚Äì1806) over 80 Free Imperial Cities came to enjoy considerable autonomy in the Middle Ages and in early modern times, buttressed legally by international law following the Peace of Westphalia of 1648. Some, like three of the earlier Hanseatic cities ‚Äì Bremen, Hamburg and L√ºbeck ‚Äì pooled their economic relations with foreign powers and were able to wield considerable diplomatic clout. Individual cities often made protective alliances with other cities or with neighbouring regions, including the Hanseatic League (1358 ‚Äì 17th century), the Swabian League of Cities (1331‚Äì1389), the D√©capole (1354‚Äì1679) in the Alsace, or the Old Swiss Confederacy ( 1300 ‚Äì 1798). The Swiss cantons of Z√ºrich, Bern, Lucerne, Fribourg, Solothurn, Basel, Schaffhausen, and Geneva originated as city-states. After the dissolution of the Holy Roman Empire in 1806, some cities ‚Äì then members of different confederacies ‚Äì officially became sovereign city-states, such as the Free Hanseatic City of Bremen (1806‚Äì11 and again 1813‚Äì71), the Free City of Frankfurt upon Main (1815‚Äì66), the Free and Hanseatic City of Hamburg (1806‚Äì11 and again 1814‚Äì71), the Free and Hanseatic City of L√ºbeck (1806‚Äì11 and again 1813‚Äì71), and the Free City of Krak√≥w (1815‚Äì1846). Under Habsburg rule the city of Fiume had the status of a corpus separatum (1779‚Äì1919), which ‚Äì while falling short of an independent sovereignty ‚Äì had many attributes of a city-state. Italy Italy in 1494, after the Peace of Lodi In northern Italy during the medieval and Renaissance periods, city-states - with various amounts of associated land - became the standard form of polity, achieving de facto independence from the Holy Roman Empire and from its constituent Kingdom of Italy. Examples: Republic of Venice, Republic of Genoa, Republic of Amalfi, Republic of Florence, Duchy of Milan, Duchy of Ferrara, San Marino, Papal States, Republic of Pisa. 20th- century cities under international supervisionDanzig= The Free City of Danzig was a semi-autonomous city-state that existed between 1920 and 1939, consisting of the Baltic Sea port of Danzig (now Gda≈Ñsk, Poland) and nearly 200 towns in the surrounding areas. It was created on 15 November 1920 under the terms of Article 100 (Section XI of Part III) of the 1919 Treaty of Versailles after the end of World War I. =Fiume= After a prolonged period where the city of Fiume enjoyed considerable autonomy under Habsburg rule (see Corpus separatum (Fiume)), The Free State of Fiume was proclaimed as a fully independent free state which existed between 1920 and 1924. Its territory of 28 km2 (11 sq mi) comprised the city of Fiume (now in Croatia and, since the end of World War II, known as Rijeka) and rural areas to its north, with a corridor to its west connecting it to Italy. =Shanghai= The Shanghai International Settlement (1845‚Äì1943) was an international zone with its own legal system, postal service, and currency. =Tangier= Tangier The international zone within the city of Tangier, in North Africa was approximately 373 km2 (144 sq mi). It was at first under the joint administration of France, Spain, and the United Kingdom, plus later Portugal, Italy, Belgium, the Netherlands, Sweden, and the United States. The international zone was initially attached to Morocco. It then became a French- Spanish protectorate from 1923 until 29 October 1956 when it was reintegrated into the state of Morocco. =Memel= The Klaipƒóda Region or Memel Territory was defined by the Treaty of Versailles in 1920 when it was put under the administration of the Council of Ambassadors. The Memel Territory was to remain under the control of the League of Nations until a future day when the people of the region would be allowed to vote on whether the land would return to Germany or not. The then predominantly ethnic German Memel Territory (Prussian Lithuanians and Memellanders constituted the other ethnic groups), situated between the river and the town of that name, was occupied by Lithuania in the Klaipƒóda Revolt of 1923. =Trieste= The Free Territory of Trieste was an independent territory situated in Central Europe between northern Italy and Yugoslavia, facing the north part of the Adriatic Sea, under direct responsibility of the United Nations Security Council in the aftermath of World War II, from 1947 to 1954. The UN attempted to make the Free Territory of Trieste into a city state, but it never gained real independence and in 1954 its territory was divided between Italy and Yugoslavia. =Jerusalem= Under the United Nations Partition Plan for Palestine of 1947, Mandatory Palestine was to be partitioned into three states: a Jewish state of Israel, an Arab state of Palestine, and a corpus separatum (Latin for \\"separated body\\") consisting of a Jerusalem city-state under the control of United Nations Trusteeship Council. Although the plan had some international support and the UN accepted this proposal (and still officially holds the stance that Jerusalem should be held under this regime), implementation of the plan failed as the 1948 Palestine war broke out with the 1947‚Äì48 Civil War in Mandatory Palestine, ultimately resulting in Jerusalem being split into West Jerusalem and East Jerusalem. Israel would eventually gain control of East Jerusalem in the Six-Day War in 1967. = West Berlin = In the 20th century West Berlin, though lacking sovereignty, functioned from 1948 until 1990 as a state legally not belonging to any other state, but ruled by the Western Allies. They allowed ‚Äì notwithstanding their overlordship as occupant powers ‚Äì its internal organisation as one state simultaneously being a city, officially called Berlin (West). Though West Berlin maintained close ties to the West German Federal Republic of Germany, it never legally formed a part of it. Modern city-states=Monaco The Principality of Monaco is an independent city-state. Monaco-Ville (the ancient fortified city) and Monaco's well-known area Monte Carlo are districts of a continuous urban zone, not distinct cities, though they were three separate municipalities (communes) until 1917. The Principality of Monaco and the city of Monaco (each having specific powers) govern the same territory. Though they maintain a small military, they would still have to rely on France for defence in the face of an aggressive power. Singapore Singapore is an island city-state in Southeast Asia. About 5.6 million people live and work within , making Singapore the 2nd-most-densely populated country in the world after Monaco. Singapore was part of Malaysia before it was expelled from the federation in 1965, becoming an independent republic, a city and a sovereign country. The Economist refers to the nation as the \\"world's only fully functioning city- state\\". In particular, it has its own currency and a full armed forces for deterrence to safeguard the nation's sovereignty against potential aggressors. Vatican City Vatican City, a city-state well known for being the smallest country in the world Until September 1870, the city of Rome had been controlled by the pope as part of his Papal States. When King Victor Emmanuel II seized the city in 1870, Pope Pius IX refused to recognize the newly formed Kingdom of Italy. Because he could not travel without effectively acknowledging the authority of the king, Pius IX and his successors each claimed to be a \\"Prisoner in the Vatican\\", unable to leave the papal enclave once they had ascended the papal thrones. The impasse was resolved in 1929 by the Lateran Treaties negotiated by the Italian dictator Benito Mussolini between King Victor Emmanuel III and Pope Pius XI. Under this treaty, the Vatican was recognized as an independent state, with the Pope as its head. The Vatican City State has its own citizenship, diplomatic corps, flag, and postage stamps. With a population of less than 1,000 (mostly clergymen), it is by far the smallest sovereign country in the world.  Non-sovereign city- states  The city of Basel, located on the Rhine, is a historic city-state and a Swiss canton. Some cities or urban areas, while not sovereign states, may nevertheless enjoy such a high degree of autonomy that they function as \\"city-states\\" within the context of the sovereign state to which they belong. Historian Mogens Herman Hansen describes this aspect of self-government as: \\"The city-state is a self-governing, but not necessarily independent political unit.\\" A city with more limited self-government may be referred to as an independent city. Some non-sovereign cities which have been described as city- states include: *Spain: Ceuta and Melilla *China: Hong Kong and Macau *United Kingdom: GibraltarEurope Since 1945: An Encyclopedia, Bernard A. Cook p.506, *Switzerland: Basel-StadtCanton of Basel-Stadt Welcome * Germany: Bremen, Berlin and Hamburg  Proposed city-states  The London independence movement seeks a city-state separate from the United Kingdom. Non-sovereign city-states have been proposed inside Canada in the form of the Province of Toronto, Province of Montreal, as well as the National Capital Region.  New York  There have been various proposals for New York City to secede from the state of New York. In the period of national crisis immediately preceding the American Civil War, Democratic Mayor Fernando Wood proposed the secession of the city as a sovereign city-state to be called the Free City of Tri-Insula (Tri-Insula meaning \\"three islands\\" in Latin), and incorporating Manhattan, Long Island and Staten Island. In an address to the city's Common Council on January 6, 1861, Mayor Wood expressed a Copperhead sympathy with the seceding states and a desire to maintain profitable cotton shipping, confidence that the city state would prosper on the import tariffs that then supplied 2/3 of federal revenue, and especially dissatisfaction with the state government at Albany. But the idea of leaving the United States proved too radical even in the turmoil of 1861 and was poorly received, especially after the Southern bombardment of Fort Sumter starting on April 12. The war, and especially conscription, was nevertheless often unpopular in the city, sparking the deadly New York Draft Riots. The neighboring City of Brooklyn, in contrast, was staunchly Unionist. In 1969, writer Norman Mailer and columnist Jimmy Breslin ran together on an independent ticket seeking the mayoralty and City Council Presidency, challenging Mayor John Lindsay with an agenda to make New York City the 51st state. When questioned as to the name of the new state, Breslin said the city deserved to keep \\"New York\\" and that upstate should be renamed \\"Buffalo\\", after its largest city. On February 26, 2003, a bill was introduced by Astoria, Queens Council Member Peter Vallone, Jr., and sponsored by 20 of 51 City Council members, reviving the idea of referendum for secession from New York State in the context of the red state vs. blue state divide and opposition to the policies of Governor George Pataki. A committee report was written but otherwise little action was taken, and the bill was reintroduced with one additional sponsor on the same date in 2004. Like Mayor Wood, Council Member Vallone emphasized the fiscal benefits of secession, with revenue now derived not from tariffs, but from Wall Street. Council Member Vallone reintroduced the bill in 2006. In January 2008, Vallone again offered a bill for the secession of New York City from New York state. After Mayor Michael Bloomberg testified to New York state legislators that New York City gives the state $11 billion more than it gets back, Vallone stated: \\"If not secession, somebody please tell me what other options we have if the state is going to continue to take billions from us and give us back pennies? Should we raise taxes some more? Should we cut services some more? Or should we consider seriously going out on our own?\\" The New York City council planned to hold a meeting on the topic.Benjamin Sarlin, A Secession Plan Is Floated for New York City, New York Sun, January 30, 2008.

Random House Webster's Unabridged Dictionary. ; ; ‚Äì ) was a Russian novelist, short story writer and playwright of Ukrainian origin. According to Vissarion Belinsky and Nikolay Chernyshevsky, Gogol became the founder of the literary direction of the \\"Natural School\\" of the 1840s and had a huge influence on Russian and world literature. Gogol's influence was ackowledged by Mikhail Bulgakov, Fyodor Dostoevsky, Ry≈´nosuke Akutagawa, Flannery O'Connor, Franz Kafka and others.Nikolai Gogol // Concise Literary Encyclopedia in 9 volumes. Early life Gogol was born in the Ukrainian Cossack town of Sorochyntsi, in the Poltava Governorate of the Russian Empire. His mother descended from Leonty Kosyarovsky, an officer of the Lubny Regiment in 1710. His father Vasili Gogol-Yanovsky, a descendant of Ukrainian Cossacks (see Lyzohub family) and who died when Gogol was 15 years old, belonged to the 'petty gentry', wrote poetry in Ukrainian and Russian, and was an amateur Ukrainian-language playwright. As was typical of the left-bank Ukrainian gentry of the early nineteenth century, the family spoke Ukrainian as well as Russian. As a child, Gogol helped stage Ukrainian-language plays in his uncle's home theater.Edyta Bojanowska. 2007). Nikolai Gogol: Between Ukrainian and Russian Nationalism. Cambridge Mass: Harvard University Press. In 1820, Gogol went to a school of higher art in Nizhyn (now Nizhyn Gogol State University) and remained there until 1828. It was there that he began writing. He was not popular among his schoolmates, who called him their \\"mysterious dwarf\\", but with two or three of them he formed lasting friendships. Very early he developed a dark and secretive disposition, marked by a painful self-consciousness and boundless ambition. Equally early he developed a talent for mimicry, which later made him a matchless reader of his own works and induced him to toy with the idea of becoming an actor. In 1828, on leaving school, Gogol came to Saint Petersburg, full of vague but glowingly ambitious hopes. He had hoped for literary fame, and brought with him a Romantic poem of German idyllic life ‚Äì Hans K√ºchelgarten. He had it published, at his own expense, under the name of \\"V. Alov.\\" The magazines he sent it to almost universally derided it. He bought all the copies and destroyed them, swearing never to write poetry again. Gogol was in touch with the \\"literary aristocracy\\", had a story published in Anton Delvig's Northern Flowers, was taken up by Vasily Zhukovsky and Pyotr Pletnyov, and (in 1831) was introduced to Pushkin. Literary development Cover of the first edition of The Government Inspector (1836). In 1831 Gogol brought out the first volume of his Ukrainian stories (Evenings on a Farm Near Dikanka), which met with immediate success.Krys Svitlana, ‚ÄúAllusions to Hoffmann in Gogol‚Äôs Ukrainian Horror Stories from the Dikan'ka Collection.‚Äù Canadian Slavonic Papers: Special Issue, devoted to the 200th anniversary of Nikolai Gogol'‚Äôs birth (1809‚Äì1852) 51.2‚Äì3 (June‚ÄìSeptember 2009): 243‚Äì266. He followed it in 1832 with a second volume, and in 1835 by two volumes of stories entitled Mirgorod, as well as by two volumes of miscellaneous prose entitled Arabesques. At this time Russian editors and critics such as Nikolai Polevoy and Nikolai Nadezhdin saw in Gogol the emergence of a Ukrainian, rather than Russian, writer, using his works to illustrate supposed differences between Russian and Ukrainian national characters.Edyta M. Bojanowska. (2007). Nikolai Gogol: Between Ukrainian and Russian Nationalism. Cambridge, Massachusetts: Harvard University Press. pp. 78‚Äì88 The themes and style of these early prose works by Gogol, as well as his later drama, were similar to the work of Ukrainian writers and dramatists who were his contemporaries and friends, including Hryhory Kvitka-Osnovyanenko and Vasily Narezhny. However, Gogol's satire was much more sophisticated and unconventional. At this time, Gogol developed a passion for Ukrainian history and tried to obtain an appointment to the history department at Kyiv University. Despite the support of Pushkin and Sergey Uvarov, the Russian minister of education, his appointment was blocked by a Kyivan bureaucrat on the grounds that Gogol was unqualified. His fictional story Taras Bulba, based on the history of Ukrainian cossacks, was the result of this phase in his interests. During this time he also developed a close and lifelong friendship with another Ukrainian, the historian and naturalist Mykhaylo Maksymovych. In 1834 Gogol was made Professor of Medieval History at the University of St. Petersburg, a job for which he had no qualifications. He turned in a performance ludicrous enough to warrant satiric treatment in one of his own stories. After an introductory lecture made up of brilliant generalizations which the 'historian' had prudently prepared and memorized, he gave up all pretence at erudition and teaching, missed two lectures out of three, and when he did appear, muttered unintelligibly through his teeth. At the final examination, he sat in utter silence with a black handkerchief wrapped around his head, simulating a toothache, while another professor interrogated the students.\\" This academic venture proved a failure and he resigned his chair in 1835. Commemorative plaque on his house in Rome Between 1832 and 1836 Gogol worked with great energy, and though almost all his work has in one way or another its sources in these four years of contact with Pushkin, he had not yet decided that his ambitions were to be fulfilled by success in literature. During this time, the Russian critics Stepan Shevyrev and Vissarion Belinsky, contradicting earlier critics, reclassified Gogol from a Ukrainian to a Russian writer. It was only after the presentation at the Saint Petersburg State Theatre, on 19 April 1836, of his comedy The Government Inspector (Revizor) that he finally came to believe in his literary vocation. The comedy, a violent satire of Russian provincial bureaucracy, was staged thanks only to the intervention of the emperor, Nicholas I. From 1836 to 1848 Gogol lived abroad, travelling through Germany and Switzerland. Gogol spent the winter of 1836‚Äì37 in Paris, among Russian expatriates and Polish exiles, frequently meeting the Polish poets Adam Mickiewicz and Bohdan Zaleski. He eventually settled in Rome. For much of the twelve years from 1836 Gogol was in Italy developing an adoration for Rome. He studied art, read Italian literature and developed a passion for opera. Pushkin's death produced a strong impression on Gogol. His principal work during the years following Pushkin's death was the satirical epic Dead Souls. Concurrently, he worked at other tasks ‚Äì recast Taras Bulba and The Portrait, completed his second comedy, Marriage (Zhenitba), wrote the fragment Rome and his most famous short story, \\"The Overcoat\\". In 1841 the first part of Dead Souls was ready, and Gogol took it to Russia to supervise its printing. It appeared in Moscow in 1842, under the title, imposed by the censorship, of The Adventures of Chichikov. The book instantly established his reputation as the greatest prose writer in the language. Creative decline and death One of several portraits of Gogol by Fyodor Moller (1840) After the triumph of Dead Souls, Gogol's contemporaries came to regard him as a great satirist who lampooned the unseemly sides of Imperial Russia. Little did they know that Dead Souls was but the first part of a planned modern-day counterpart to the Divine Comedy of Dante. The first part represented the Inferno; the second part would depict the gradual purification and transformation of the rogue Chichikov under the influence of virtuous publicans and governors ‚Äì Purgatory.Gogol declared that \\"the subject of Dead Souls has nothing to do with the description of Russian provincial life or of a few revolting landowners. It is for the time being a secret which must suddenly and to the amazement of everyone (for as yet none of my readers has guessed it) be revealed in the following volumes...\\" In April 1848 Gogol returned to Russia from a pilgrimage to Jerusalem and passed his last years in restless movement throughout the country. While visiting the capitals, he stayed with friends such as Mikhail Pogodin and Sergey Aksakov. During this period, he also spent much time with his old Ukrainian friends, Maksymovych and Osyp Bodiansky. He intensified his relationship with a starets or spiritual elder, Matvey Konstantinovsky, whom he had known for several years. Konstantinovsky seems to have strengthened in Gogol the fear of perdition (damnation) by insisting on the sinfulness of all his imaginative work. Exaggerated ascetic practices undermined his health and he fell into a state of deep depression. On the night of 24 February 1852 he burned some of his manuscripts, which contained most of the second part of Dead Souls. He explained this as a mistake, a practical joke played on him by the Devil. Soon thereafter, he took to bed, refused all food, and died in great pain nine days later. Gogol was mourned in the Saint Tatiana church at the Moscow University before his burial and then buried at the Danilov Monastery, close to his fellow Slavophile Aleksey Khomyakov. His grave was marked by a large stone (Golgotha), topped by a Russian Orthodox cross.–ú–æ–≥–∏–ª–µ –ì–æ–≥–æ–ª—è –≤–µ—Ä–Ω—É–ª–∏ –ø–µ—Ä–≤–æ–∑–¥–∞–Ω–Ω—ã–π –≤–∏–¥: –Ω–∞ –Ω–µ–µ –ø–æ—Å—Ç–∞–≤–∏–ª–∏ \\"–ì–æ–ª–≥–æ—Ñ—É\\" —Å –º–æ–≥–∏–ª—ã –ë—É–ª–≥–∞–∫–æ–≤–∞ –∏ –≤–æ—Å—Å—Ç–∞–Ω–æ–≤–∏–ª–∏ –∫—Ä–µ—Å—Ç.

The authorities moved the Golgotha stone to the new gravesite, but removed the cross; in 1952 the Soviets replaced the stone with a bust of Gogol. The stone was later reused for the tomb of Gogol's admirer Mikhail Bulgakov. In 2009, in connection with the bicentennial of Gogol's birth, the bust was moved to the museum at Novodevichy Cemetery, and the original Golgotha stone was returned, along with a copy of the original Orthodox cross.–ú–æ–≥–∏–ª–µ –ì–æ–≥–æ–ª—è –≤–µ—Ä–Ω—É–ª–∏ –ø–µ—Ä–≤–æ–∑–¥–∞–Ω–Ω—ã–π –≤–∏–¥: –Ω–∞ –Ω–µ–µ –ø–æ—Å—Ç–∞–≤–∏–ª–∏ \\"–ì–æ–ª–≥–æ—Ñ—É\\" —Å –º–æ–≥–∏–ª—ã –ë—É–ª–≥–∞–∫–æ–≤–∞ –∏ –≤–æ—Å—Å—Ç–∞–Ω–æ–≤–∏–ª–∏ –∫—Ä–µ—Å—Ç.

Joseph Stalin did not like it, however, and the statue was replaced by a more orthodox Socialist Realism monument in 1952. It took enormous efforts to save Andreyev's original work from destruction; it stands in front of the house where Gogol died.For a full story and illustrations, see –†–æ—Å—Å–∏–π—Å–∫–æ–µ –æ–±—Ä–∞–∑–æ–≤–∞–Ω–∏–µ. –§–µ–¥–µ—Ä–∞–ª—å–Ω—ã–π –æ–±—Ä–∞–∑–æ–≤–∞—Ç–µ–ª—å–Ω—ã–π –ø–æ—Ä—Ç–∞–ª: —É—á—Ä–µ–∂–¥–µ–Ω–∏—è, –ø—Ä–æ–≥—Ä–∞–º–º—ã, —Å—Ç–∞–Ω–¥–∞—Ä—Ç—ã, –í–£–ó—ã, —Ç–µ—Å—Ç—ã –ï–ì–≠. and –ú–æ—Å–∫–≤–∞ –∏ –º–æ—Å–∫–≤–∏—á–∏ Style Pyotr Sokolov. D. S. Mirsky characterized Gogol's universe as \\"one of the most marvellous, unexpected ‚Äì in the strictest sense, originalGogol's originality does not mean that numerous influences cannot be discerned in his work. The principle of these are: the tradition of the Ukrainian folk and puppet theatre, with which the plays of Gogol's father were closely linked; the heroic poetry of the Cossack ballads (dumy), the Iliad in the Russian version by Gnedich; the numerous and mixed traditions of comic writing from Moli√®re to the vaudevillians of the 1820s; the picaresque novel from Lesage to Narezhny; Sterne, chiefly through the medium of German romanticism; the German romanticists themselves (especially Tieck and E.T.A. Hoffmann); the French tradition of Gothic romance ‚Äì a long and yet incomplete list. ‚Äì worlds ever created by an artist of words\\".D.S. Mirsky. A History of Russian Literature. Northwestern University Press, 1999. . p. 155. The other main characteristic of Gogol's writing is his 'impressionist' vision of reality and people. He saw the outer world strangely metamorphosed, a singular gift particularly evident from the fantastic spatial transformations in his Gothic stories, \\"A Terrible Vengeance\\" and \\"A Bewitched Place\\". His pictures of nature are strange mounds of detail heaped on detail, resulting in an unconnected chaos of things. His people are caricatures, drawn with the method of the caricaturist ‚Äì which is to exaggerate salient features and to reduce them to geometrical pattern. But these cartoons have a convincingness, a truthfulness, and inevitability ‚Äì attained as a rule by slight but definitive strokes of unexpected reality ‚Äì that seems to beggar the visible world itself.Mirsky, p. 149 According to Andrey Bely, Gogol's work influenced the emergence of Gothic romance, and served as a forerunner for absurdism and impressionism. The aspect under which the mature Gogol sees reality is expressed by the Russian word poshlost', which means something similar to \\"triviality, banality, inferiority\\", moral and spiritual, widespread in some group or society. Like Sterne before him, Gogol was a great destroyer of prohibitions and of romantic illusions. He undermined Russian Romanticism by making vulgarity reign where only the sublime and the beautiful had before. According to some critics, Gogol's grotesque is a \\"means of estranging, a comic hyperbole that unmasks the banality and inhumanity of ambient reality\\". See: Fusso, Susanne. Essays on Gogol: Logos and the Russian Word. Northwestern University Press, 1994. . p. 55. \\"Characteristic of Gogol is a sense of boundless superfluity that is soon revealed as utter emptiness and a rich comedy that suddenly turns into metaphysical horror.\\"\\"Russian literature.\\" Encyclop√¶dia Britannica, 2005.

A more conventional statue of Gogol at the Villa Borghese gardens, Rome. Gogol burning the manuscript of the second part of Dead Souls, by Ilya Repin Gogol in philately, Russian Wikipedia It stunned Gogol when critics interpreted The Government Inspector as an indictment of tsarism despite Nicholas I's patronage of the play. Gogol himself, an adherent of the Slavophile movement, believed in a divinely inspired mission for both the House of Romanov and the Russian Orthodox Church. Similar to Fyodor Dostoyevsky, Gogol sharply disagreed with those Russians who preached constitutional monarchy and the disestablishment of the Orthodox Church. After defending autocracy, serfdom, and the Orthodox Church in his book Selected Passages from Correspondence with his Friends (1847), Gogol came under attack from his former patron Vissarion Belinsky. The first Russian intellectual to publicly preach the economic theories of Karl Marx, Belinsky accused Gogol of betraying his readership by defending the status quo. Influence and interpretations Even before the publication of Dead Souls, Belinsky recognized Gogol as the first Russian-language realist writer and as the head of the Natural School, to which he also assigned such younger or lesser authors as Goncharov, Turgenev, Dmitry Grigorovich, Vladimir Dahl and Vladimir Sollogub. Gogol himself appeared skeptical about the existence of such a literary movement. Although he recognized \\"several young writers\\" who \\"have shown a particular desire to observe real life\\", he upbraided the deficient composition and style of their works.\\"The structure of the stories themselves seemed especially unskilful and clumsy to me; in one story I noted excess and verbosity, and an absence of simplicity in the style\\". Quoted by Vasily Gippius in his monograph Gogol (Duke University Press, 1989, p. 166). Nevertheless, subsequent generations of radical critics celebrated Gogol (the author in whose world a nose roams the streets of the Russian capital) as a great realist, a reputation decried by the Encyclop√¶dia Britannica as \\"the triumph of Gogolesque irony\\".The latest edition of the Britannica labels Gogol \\"one of the finest comic authors of world literature and perhaps its most accomplished nonsense writer.\\" See under \\"Russian literature.\\" The period of literary modernism saw a revival of interest in and a change of attitude towards Gogol's work. One of the pioneering works of Russian formalism was Eichenbaum's reappraisal of \\"The Overcoat\\". In the 1920s a group of Russian short-story writers, known as the Serapion Brothers, placed Gogol among their precursors and consciously sought to imitate his techniques. The leading novelists of the period ‚Äì notably Yevgeny Zamyatin and Mikhail Bulgakov ‚Äì also admired Gogol and followed in his footsteps. In 1926 Vsevolod Meyerhold staged The Government Inspector as a \\"comedy of the absurd situation\\", revealing to his fascinated spectators a corrupt world of endless self-deception. In 1934 Andrei Bely published the most meticulous study of Gogol's literary techniques up to that date, in which he analyzed the colours prevalent in Gogol's work depending on the period, his impressionistic use of verbs, the expressive discontinuity of his syntax, the complicated rhythmical patterns of his sentences, and many other secrets of his craft. Based on this work, Vladimir Nabokov published a summary account of Gogol's masterpieces.Nabokov, Vladimir (2017) [1961]. Nikolai Gogol. New York: New Directions. p. 140. The house in Moscow where Gogol died. The building contains the fireplace where he burned the manuscript of the second part of Dead Souls. Gogol's impact on Russian literature has endured, yet various critics have appreciated his works differently. Belinsky, for instance, berated his horror stories as \\"moribund, monstrous works\\", while Andrei Bely counted them among his most stylistically daring creations. Nabokov especially admired Dead Souls, The Government Inspector, and \\"The Overcoat\\" as works of genius, proclaiming that \\"when, as in his immortal 'The Overcoat', Gogol really let himself go and pottered happily on the brink of his private abyss, he became the greatest artist that Russia has yet produced.\\" Critics traditionally interpreted \\"The Overcoat\\" as a masterpiece of \\"humanitarian realism\\", but Nabokov and some other attentive readers argued that \\"holes in the language\\" make the story susceptible to interpretation as a supernatural tale about a ghostly double of a \\"small man\\".Dostoevsky, at least, appears to have had such a reading of the story seems in mind when he wrote The Double. The quote, often apocryphally attributed to Dostoevsky, that \\"we all [future generations of Russian novelists] emerged from Gogol's Overcoat\\", actually refers to those few who read \\"The Overcoat\\" as a double-bottom ghost story (as did Aleksey Remizov, judging by his story The Sacrifice). Of all Gogol's stories, \\"The Nose\\" has stubbornly defied all abstruse interpretations: D.S. Mirsky declared it \\"a piece of sheer play, almost sheer nonsense\\". In recent years, however, \\"The Nose\\" became the subject of several interesting postmodernist and postcolonial interpretations. Gogol's oeuvre has also had a large impact on Russia's non- literary culture, and his stories have been adapted numerous times into opera and film. The Russian composer Alfred Schnittke wrote the eight-part Gogol Suite as incidental music to The Government Inspector performed as a play, and Dmitri Shostakovich set The Nose as his first opera in 1930 ‚Äì a peculiar choice of subject for what was meant to initiate the great tradition of Soviet opera.Gogol Suite, CD Universe More recently, to celebrate the 200th anniversary of Gogol's birth in 1809, Vienna's renowned Theater an der Wien commissioned music and libretto for a full-length opera on the life of Gogol from Russian composer and writer Lera Auerbach.

The punk band Gogol Bordello take their name from Gogol; he serves as an ideological influence for the band because he \\"smuggled\\" Ukrainian culture into Russian society, which Gogol Bordello intends to do with Gypsy/East-European music in the English- speaking world.https://www.npr.org/templates/story/story.php?storyId=5371385 BibliographyNotesCitationsReferences * Townsend, Dorian Aleksandra, From Upyr' to Vampire: The Slavic Vampire Myth in Russian Literature, Ph.D. Dissertation, School of German and Russian Studies, Faculty of Arts & Social Sciences, University of New South Wales, May 2011. * External links  * * Gogol : Magical realism * * Nikolay Gogol in Encyclop√¶dia Britannica * * –ú–µ—Ä—Ç–≤—ã—è –¥—É—à–∏ [Dead Souls] From the Collections at the Library of Congress * A quiz on Gogol at Goodreads * Gogol House at Google Cultural Institute Category:1809 births Category:1852 deaths Category:People from Myrhorod Raion Category:People from Poltava Governorate Category:Eastern Orthodox writers Category:Magic realism writers Category:Mythopoeic writers Category:Imperial Russian dramatists and playwrights Category:Russian male dramatists and playwrights Category:Imperial Russian monarchists Category:Russian male novelists Category:Russian male short story writers Category:Russian writers of Ukrainian descent Category:Nizhyn Gogol State University alumni Category:Saint Petersburg State University alumni Category:Burials at Novodevichy Cemetery Category:19th-century Russian short story writers Category:19th-century Russian writers ","title":"Nikolai Gogol"},{"id":"139178","text":"Cold Spring is a town in Jefferson County, Wisconsin, United States.

History The first non-Native American settlers in the region consisted entirely of settlers from New England as well as settlers from Upstate New York whose parents had moved to that region shortly after the American Revolution. These were \\"Yankee\\" settlers, meaning they were descended from the English Puritans who settled New England during the colonial era. They were primarily members of the Congregational Church though due to the Second Great Awakening many of them had converted to Methodism and some had become Baptists before coming to what is now Jefferson County. The Congregational Church subsequently has gone through many divisions and some factions are now known as the Church of Christ, United Church of Christ and Church of God. When the New England settlers arrived in what is now Concord there was nothing but a dense virgin forest and wild prairie. New Englanders and New England transplants from Upstate New York were the vast majority of Jefferson County's inhabitants during the first several decades of its history. As a result of this heritage Concord, Wisconsin was named after Concord, New Hampshire.The History of Jefferson County, Wisconsin: Containing a History of Jefferson County, Its Early Settlement, Growth, Development, Resources, Etc....Western Historical Company, 1879 On February 1, 1860, Charles Ingalls married Caroline Quiner in Concord.

It is on the Rock River, a few miles upstream from Lake Koshkonong. The population was 12,368 at the 2010 census.  History  Fort Atkinson was named after General Henry Atkinson, the commander of U.S. forces in the area during the Black Hawk War (1832) against a mixed band of Sauk, Meskwaki and Kickapoo peoples. The city developed at the site of Fort Koshkonong, which was used during that war. A replica of the original 1832 stockade has been built just outside town, although not at the original site. The fort was located to control the confluence of the Rock and Bark rivers. The settlement grew rapidly in the mid-19th century, after the migration of pioneers from the east, especially New York State and the northern tier. They were among the many migrants carrying New England Yankee culture west across the northern tier of states.David Hackett Fischer, Albion's Seed: Four British Folkways in America. 1989). The history and natural history of Fort Atkinson and the surrounding area are presented at the Hoard Historical Museum and National Dairy Shrine Museum.Hoard Museum information William Dempster Hoard founded the nationally distributed dairy farm magazine Hoard's Dairyman in Fort Atkinson in 1885. The museums include the Frank and Luella Hoard House, the Dwight and Almira Foster House, and the Knox Research Library and Archive. The Dairy Shrine portion of the complex portrays the past, present, and future of the dairy industry. The oldest manmade features near Fort Atkinson are a cluster of prehistoric earthworks indigenous mounds just south of town. In a curious honor, settlers named them the General Atkinson Mound Group. The mounds are a remnant of the Woodland Period in present-day Wisconsin. They are effigy and geometric mounds, different from the platform mounds at nearby Aztalan State Park, built by peoples of the Mississippian culture, which reached its peak around 1300. They had settlements throughout the Mississippi Valley and its tributaries, extending from central Illinois northward to the Great Lakes and also to the Southeastern United States. Materials were traded within the culture from the Great Lakes to the Gulf of Mexico. A long panther intaglio appears on a mound west of town, the last remaining intaglio in the state. \\"Indian Mounds\\", Wisconsin Stories website] Fort Atkinson's 19th- and early 20th-century building history is preserved in the Main Street and Merchants Avenue historic districts.

The region about the Yahara River was called Gishkzhegonang (Catfish Place) by the Potawatomi peoples, and was transcribed into English as \\"Koshkonong.\\" The Potawatomis called Lake Koshkonong as √ândayang-zagegen (Lake Where-we-live-on), but the early settlers began calling this lake in the Koshkonong region as Lake Koshkonong.Cassidy, Frederic G. (2009) \\"Lake Koshkonong\\" in Dane County Place-Names, p. 87. The first settlers for farming arrived around 1836. In 1840, Norwegian families from Telemark settled near Lake Muskego in Waukesha County. In 1841, what would become for a time the largest Norwegian-American community in America was founded at Koshkonong in eastern Dane and western Jefferson counties. It was started by settlers from the Jefferson Prairie Settlement and the Fox River settlement.

Most of the city's population is in Jefferson County. Division Street, several blocks north of downtown, marks the county line. The population of Watertown was 23,861 at the 2010 census. Of this, 15,402 were in Jefferson County, and 8,459 were in Dodge County. Watertown is the largest city in the Watertown-Fort Atkinson micropolitan area, which also includes Johnson Creek and Jefferson. History=Origin Watertown was first settled by Timothy Johnson, who built a cabin on the west side of the Rock River in 1836. He was born in Middleton, Middlesex County, Connecticut, on the 28th of June, 1792. A park on the west side of the city is named in his honor. The area was settled to utilize the power of the Rock River, which falls in two miles (two dams). In contrast, the Rock River falls only in upstream from Watertown.Upper Rock River Basin ‚Äì WDNR. Dnr.state.wi.us. [archived] The water power was first used for sawmills, and later prompted the construction of two hydroelectric dams, one downtown (where the river flows south) and one on the eastern edge of the city (where the river flows north). Watertown was a New England settlement. The original founders of Watertown consisted entirely of settlers from New England, particularly Connecticut, rural Massachusetts, Vermont, New Hampshire and Maine, as well some from upstate New York who were born to parents who had migrated to that region from New England shortly after the American Revolution. These people were \\"Yankees\\", that is to say they were descended from the English Puritans who settled New England in the 1600s. They were part of a wave of New England farmers who headed west into what was then the wilds of the Northwest Territory during the early 1800s. Most of them arrived as a result of the completion of the Erie Canal as well as the end of the Black Hawk War. When they arrived in what is now Watertown there was nothing but dense virgin forest and wild prairie, the New Englanders laid out farms, constructed roads, erected government buildings and established post routes. They brought with them many of their Yankee New England values, such as a passion for education, establishing many schools as well as staunch support for abolitionism. They were mostly members of the Congregationalist Church though some were Episcopalian. Due to the second Great Awakening some of them had converted to Methodism and some had become Baptists before moving to what is now Watertown. Watertown, like much of Wisconsin, would be culturally very continuous with early New England culture for most of its early history.Proceedings of the State Historical Society of Wisconsin at Volumes 45-49 By State Historical Society of Wisconsin pg. 132Proceedings of the State Historical Society of Wisconsin, Volumes 45-47 By State Historical Society of Wisconsin pg. 132 It was incorporated as a village in 1849, and chartered as a city in 1853. In the 1850s, immigrants arrived in Watertown from Germany. These people were fleeing revolutions and turmoil in Germany which often saw pogroms against the wealthy. It was deemed better to be poor or middle class in America than it was to be wealthy in Germany. Most of the German immigrants who arrived in Watertown brought with them the trappings of the German middle class, including a proclivity for classical music, the Latin language and ornate furniture. Unlike instances in other parts of the country in which they faced discrimination and xenophobia, they were welcomed with open arms by the English-Puritan descended \\"Yankee\\" population of Watertown and Jefferson County as a whole. This warm reception led to chain migration, which in turn greatly increased the German population of the region. Culturally they had much in common with the New England derived population. For instance both groups unanimously opposed slavery and both had a pronounced love for commerce and industry. Economically both communities would thrive in Watertown for the entirety of the 19th century, not facing any measurable economic hardships until the Great Depression in the following century.Charles J. Wallman. The German-speaking Forty-eighters: Builders of Watertown, Wisconsin. Madison: Max Kade Institute for German-American Studies, 1990. Milwaukee and Rock River Canal A canal from Milwaukee to the Watertown area was once planned, but was replaced by railroad before any work had been completed, other than a dam in Milwaukee.Geo. W. Peck. Wisconsin: comprising sketches of counties, towns, events, institutions, and persons, arranged in cyclopedic form. Madison, Wis.: Western Historical Association, 1906, p. 72. The territorial legislature incorporated the Milwaukee and Rock River Canal company in 1836, but the plan was abandoned in 1848. The canal would have provided a waterway between the Great Lakes and the Mississippi River, but even if completed, it may not have seen much success because railroads had already become the preferred mode of transportation. 19th century growth In 1853, a plank road was completed from Milwaukee to Watertown.Watertown Historical Society. Watertown Wisconsin History Timeline. Retrieved April 22, 2014. After plank roads were no longer used, the route was replaced by highway (Wisconsin Highway 16) and a railroad. A street named \\"Watertown Plank Road\\" survives in Milwaukee. It is referred to in the \\"Plank Road Brewery\\" family of beers, produced by Miller Brewing Company in Milwaukee. The downstream of Watertown's two dams, with a portion of downtown in the background Watertown's Octagon House There was an influx of German immigrants in the late 19th century. The city is the home of the first kindergarten in the United States, started in 1856 by Margarethe Schurz, wife of statesman Carl Schurz; the building that housed this kindergarten is now located on the grounds of the Octagon House Museum in Watertown. City railroad bond default Growth of the city was substantially hampered when Watertown issued almost half a million dollars in bonds to support the building of two railroads to town to encourage further growth: the Chicago & Fond du Lac Company and the Milwaukee, Watertown & Madison Road.Ben Feld, \\"City Government 101\\" in Ken Riedl (ed.), History of Watertown, Wisconsin. The success of the plank road convinced residents that a railroad would be even more beneficial, and bonds were issued from 1853 to 1855. The Milwaukee and Watertown Railroad, as it was called before it extended to Madison, was completed in 1855, only the second line in the state.M. Wyman. The Wisconsin Frontier. Bloomington: Indiana University Press, 1998. Soon after, in the Panic of 1857, the two railroads went bankrupt. The bonds were sold by the original investors to out-of-town speculators at a small fraction of their face value. Since the railroads were never built and did not produce revenue, the city was unable to pay off the bonds. Moreover, the city did not feel compelled to do so because the creditors (those who held the bonds) were not only from out of town, but weren't even the original holders. Yet the creditors exerted so much pressure on the city to pay off the bonds that Watertown effectively dissolved its government so that there was no legal entity (the government as a whole or officers) that could be served a court order to pay or appear in court. The case was not resolved until 1889, when it had risen all the way to the Supreme Court of the United States, which essentially dismissed the case of the creditors. A small amount remained to be paid, and this was not paid off until 1905, half a century later.Milwaukee and Watertown Railroad. Watertown History. Geography and climate Watertown is located in southeastern Wisconsin, approximately midway between Madison and Milwaukee, at 43¬∞12'N 88¬∞43'W (43.193, ‚àí88.724).

The city originally developed inside the horseshoe, though it has long since grown beyond. Silver Creek adjoins the river in the city, as does a short creek on the west side. The most notable geographical feature is a high density of drumlins, long hills formed by the glaciers of the Wisconsin glaciation as they retreated northwards. Hills in the area are elongated in the north-south direction. Weather=Demographics As of the census of 2010, there were 23,861 people living in the city.2010 Demographic Profile.
